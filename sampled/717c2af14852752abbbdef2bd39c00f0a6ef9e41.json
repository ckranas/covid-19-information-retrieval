The overlapping populations are customarily drawn with a smooth, continuous, Gaussian curve as if the underlying samples were very large, tn f'act, however, most ROC curves are based on data from finite samples which should be depicted as D+ and D-histograms, With the histogram model it is evident that perfect separation could occur by chance, an event impossible with the Gaussian model. We set out to determine whether realistic histogram models might lead to overestimation of test performance by ROC analysis.",

The effect is subtle but consistent, on the order ot ~ 3-5X (max. 10X) of the standard deviation of the AUC, In most practical settings the SSS error would be masked by the standard deviation, However, as new imaging systems are developed and evaluated by RQC studies involving finite and sometimes small samples, one should expect a small but systematic bias making the ROC curve look better than it will later when larger samples are studied. The SSS effect is a mathematical characteristic of the ROC curve that to our Knowledge has not previously been reported.",

Evidence exists that sulfhydryls (SH) obtained by reduction of MAb disulfide (S-S) groups provide high a~finity binding for Tc-99m. When AA was incubated (22 C, 60 min, pH 6.4) with MAb at molar ratio 3500:1 (e.g. 68 ug AA for 100 ug IgM), 2.7+0.2% S-S groups were reduced as determined by spectrophotometric assay of SH-ninhydrin complex (abs. max 520 nm). W~en AA treated MAb was incubated with reduced Tc-99m (22vC, 5 min.), labeling efficiency determined by HPLC was 96+3% for IgG and 98+5% for IgM. In presence of cysteine, at molar ratios 1:1 and 100:1 to AA reduced IgM, Tc-99m incorporation decreased by 81% and 36% resply. suggesting MAb SH as binding sites for Tc-99m. When Tc-99m MAb was challenged with DTPA and HSA, in 500:1 molar ratios, <1% Tc-99m was transchelated indicating high stability of the tracer. Association of two Tc-99m MAbs with specific cell surface and immobilized antigens was 84+1% and 82.6+1% resply. Immunoreactivity of Tc-99m MAb~--determined~by specific (84+1%) and nonspecific (16+0.5%) antigen assay remained unaltered. Four hr tissue distribution of Tc-99m MAb in mice was similar to that of 1-125 labeled MAb (Liver, 4.8+3.2% vs 6.8+2.5%).

Twenty-eight patients (162) with an abdominal aneurysm were considered as controls based on history and unchanged exercise ECG. LVEF and a cumulative regional wall motion score (RWHS) for 3 regions were obtained. LVEF-PEx improved significantly compared to maximal exercise (LVEF-Ex) in all 4 different diagnostic groups (p < 0.001), as applied to cumulative RWMS-PEx compared to RWHS-Ex in the recent and old myocardial infarction groups (p < 0.001). In the abdominal aneurysm group and the valvular group, however, no significant change was noted in cumulative RWMS-Ex to RWMS-PEx (p = 0.031 and p = 0.428 respectively).

This study was performed to test the reproducibility of a standard protocol for the relative quantification of myocardial blood flow in repeated stress studies in the same patient using SPECT and the new tracer Tc-99m Sestamibi. So far, 56 studies in 14 patients with known coronary artery disease were obtained prospectively within a coronary drug study. On day 1, a standard Tc-99m Sestamibi rest-exercise SPECT protocol was performed. On day 3, exercise was repeated twice at the same level before and after a dilatative agent, so that 2 stress perfusion sets were available for direct comparison. For blood flow quantification a semiquantitative polar coordinate program was used allowing the determination of significantly decreased blood flow in comparison to normal expressed in percent of total myocardium as well as in regard to standardized perfusion areas of the 3 coronary vessels. Decreased stress perfusion was found as follows: In addition, the extent of decreased perfusion within the singular areas was correlated between stress 1 and 2: Total: r = 0.96 y --0.72 x + 2.9 LAD: r = 0.97 0.84 x + 1.7 RCA:",

Reduction of systolic wall thickening below normal appears to be a good indicator of impaired myocardial perfusion, which can be detected by MIBI-SPECT. The myocardial imaging by MIBI-SPECT appears to provide exact quantification of the extent of myocardial infarction, especially when compared with the morphological information of MRI. Both methods are complementary in the decision for coronary revascularizatlon. Antibodies are basic gamma globulins and cell surfaces contain acidic residues. Therefore, there is a potential-for non-specific ionic interaction which may increase non-target organ activities when antibodies are used in vivo. The purpose of this investigation is to modify monocional antimyosin FaD (AM) with highly negatively charged synthetic polymers carrying many chelating groups (for labeling with In-lll) and acidic residues (DTPA-Succinylated polylysine 3.3 and 17kD = PL3.3kD or 17kD) without affecting the affinity of AM, and to demonstrate lower in vivo non-target organ activities and better specific target organ localization relative to the conventional control lllIn DTPA-AM. Dogs were subjected to acute experimental LAD occlusion for 3 H, after which reperfusion was initiated. Fifteen min later 0.6 mCi of TI-201 was administered and after another 15 min, T1-201 distribution image was obtained. Then = 0.8 mCi in -8 ug of PL3.3k D-(n = 6) or PL17kD-AM (n = 6) or ~ 1 mCi in 250 ug of conventional In-lll DTPA-AM (n = 7) were injected intravenously. Gamma imaging was performed for the next 4 H. Serial blood samples were collected from 1 rain to 4 H. The animals were killed and standard biodistribution oerformed. Acute infarcts were visualized within 30 rain after administration of 111In-PL3.3kD-or lllIn-PL17kD-AM, whereas conventional AM required 1-2 H for visualization. Means of ratios of infarct (I) to normal (N) myocardial activities in 0-20% TI-201 distribution samples were higher for PL17kD-AM (32 _+ 10) than for PL3.3k D-or 19 .5 + 3 respectively) (P < 0.01).

We deduce that the PET images obtained after injection of a trace amount of Cll labeled MQNB reflect more blood flow than receptor density or affinity. After injection of Tc-99m DISIDA the radioactivity detected over the liver area reflects the netto balance of the extraction and excretion capacity of the liver. We report here a mathematical treatment allowing absolute quantification of these two hepatic functions. The distribution of the tracer was calculated using the tracer conservation equation including four unknown quantities: the liver, gut and bladder attenuation coefficients and a normalization factor for the vascular compartment. Abdominal scans being obtained every min over a period of 60 rain, the conservation law was written for every acquisition so that the number of equations obtained (60), largely exceeds the number of unknown quantities. The absolute radioactivity present in blood, liver, bladder and gut was obtained by solving these 60 equations using the Schmidt algorithm. Values of blood radioactivity calculated by this method were similar to those measured in blood samples. Knowing the activity of each compartment, the liver extraction rate was Calculated at each time by subtracting the blood and bladder activity from the total activity injected; the gut activity represents the hepatic excretion rate. By deconvolution we obtained an intrinsic extraction function independent of the quality of the bolus injection, and an intrinsic excretion function independent of the liver extraction capacity. Analysis of the intrinsic extraction function revealed the existence of two phases: a short initial phase characterized by a high extraction rate, followed by a phase of slow or even zero extraction. Preliminary results indicate that the rapid phase is mainly flow dependent whereas the second phase is flow independent. The ratio between blood and liver concentration ot the tracer remains stable during the second phase and is likely to represent the maximal hepatic extraction capacity. ",

Neural network provide effective tools for non-linear problems analysis, by emulating the behaviour of a network of parallel singlefunction computing devices modelled after a simplified simulation of a neuron. A neural network actually \"learns\" from a given experience rather than being programmed on a rule-based engine. We evaluated the pattern generalization capabilities of neural networks for predicting the distribution of coronary lesion starting from myocardial perfusion SPECT data. This program is a software simulation of a supervised three-layered network: connection strenghts follow the Hebbian rule and are adjusted after the output errors by a backpropagation algorhythm. The input layer handles myocardial left ventncular SPECT perfusion data while the output layer determines the probability of presence of coronary stenoses. A hidden layer provides interneural connect,ons. The network is handled as a matrix of values that give determined outputs while compared (dot product) with the input values arranged as an array of multidimensional vectors. After the training phase, network performance was evaluated with two datasets: single-vessel CAD and mixed single-and multi-vessel disease. The network was able of correctly predicting the stenosed/occluded vessel in all (16/16) cases when singlevessel CAD was present. When multiple vessel CAD was responsible for perfusion defects the overall success rate in correctly identify the most probable vessel(s) was 83% (20/24). Neural network perfomance is strictly dependent from design layout and the training dataset ",

In these 2 patients filtered backprojection (fb) produced stronger defects in the inferior segments than iterative reconstruction(it) : Ischasmia 3(fb) versus l(it)(cardiac catheterization: occlusion of the right coronary artery) and persistent defect 4(fb) versus 2(it)(cardiac catheterization: severe stenosis of the right coronary artery and inferior hypokinesia).

Furthermore an interactive correction algorithm was designed to compensate the related artificial image distortion. For recognizing the upward heart motion a straight line was fitted to the upper and lower border of consecutively displayed tomographic projection images. In this way vertical translation of at least 1 pixel in size could be detected easily. On the assumption of a slow, but continuous upward motion of the heart a fast interpolative correction method was developed. Out of I00 consecutive supine ergometric exercise patient studies I, 2, or 3 pixels upward creep was found in 16, 4, or 3 patients respectively. It was found that only an upward creep of 2 pixels or more (7/100 cases) led to evident, mostly anteroseptal defects on quantitative bullseyes, whereas only upward creeps of 3 pixels or more (3/100 cases) caused false positive diagnostic results. The simple correction method offered a sufficient compensation of image and/or bullseye artifacts. These clinical findings could be reproduced in a computer model. In conclusion it can be stated that clinically significant upward creep of the heart during stress SPECT acquisition is relatively rare and its artificial effects can be corrected by a fast and simple algorithm.",

The SCI classify RWMA into 8 classes, from normal to dyskinetie. They are based on multiparametric representations of pixel time activities (mainly Fourier features) and relative pixel locations, on image filtering, and on computerized pattern analysis. The analysis include the following classification approaches: the k-th nearest neighbor classifier, the least square error and median transform, and its more complex generalization, the neural network (back-propagation based) classifier. The computer \"learns\" from teaching images (TA) which were derived from functional images of gated studies, ultrasound and cardiac catheterization results. The SCI have been developed on a data base of more than 80 cases. Ideally, TA and SCI should be identical; the preliminary ones on the training set have been in agreement in more than 90% of pixels, with false normal/RWMA error in less than 1% of pixels. The obtained regional diagnosis offered by the SCI is very similar to that given by the TA which derived by a consensus of physicians. By pointing out ambiguities in the interpretation of overlapping 3D dynamic structures in the 2D TA, the SCI have initiated a two-way learning process between computer and physician. The SCI types will be compared from points of view of computational demands, trainability, and classification accuracy. The SCI are superior to current parametric images, including phase analysis, especially in the diagnosis of mild RWMA.",

We measured for L-[l-11C]tyrosine, after administration of bromocryptine, a 28% decrease' (P<0.025) in the tumor/cortex ratio (range 17-45%) ~nd a 29% decrease (P<0.05) in the tumor~cerebellum ratio (range 8-50~). With ZSFDG the delineation of the prolactinomas was not achieved. Discrepancies in tumor extent between MRI and PET/L-[l-1~C]tyrosine were found. At 18h after therapy, residual prolactine levels amounted 16\u2022 to the levels in the untreated situation. In conclusion, bromocryptine reduces the uptake of L-[l-11C]tyrosine, which can be explained as suppression of protein sythesis. 0n account of a low demand for glucose which is associated with the low ~rowth rates, prolactinomas cannot be visualized with SFDG. Correlations between the measure of reduction of the prolaetine level and the percentage decrease in the L-[l-1~C]tyrosine ratios could not be established.",

The formative peptide of the islet amyloid has been extracted, isolated, characterised and termed Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). A rabbit anti-IAPP antiserum was raised and shown to react with islet amyloid. Pure rabbit IgG was prepared from this antise@)~n, made sterile and pyrogen free and labelled with \u2022 with preservation of immunoreactivity. 5 patients with type II diabetes and 1 patient with insulinoma were studied with 37 -55.5 MBQ of the labelled antibody. 2 patients with type I diabetes were studied as controls. Scintigr&ms were interpreted by an experienced blind observer. The initial results have shown successful immunoscintigraphic localisation of amyloid deposits in the pancreas of 3 type II diabetic patients and i elderly type I diabetic patient. There was a false-positive uptake in the patient with insulinoma and 2 results were considered equivocal. The technical problems in the study are discussed. Despite the associated problems these initial results provide the incentive for further studies and refinement of the technique. About 50% of all pts. with MEN-2 syndrome develop unior bilateral pheochromo~ytomas (pheo). Clinical symptoms are not very helpful in detecting a pheo, which is a mafor cause of morbidity in pts. with MEN-2 were examined regarding the value of clinical symptoms, biochemical parameters, ultrasound, CT or MRI, and MIBG-scintigraphy for detecting pheo. 7 pts. had undergone surgery for unilateral and 5 pts. for bilateral pheo. In further 2 pts. a bilateral and in 2 pts. an unilateral pheo is assumed. Only 3 of the 15 pts. with pheo have had clinical symptoms and the pheo was detected earlier than the medullary thyroid carcinoma. The other tumors were identified by screening. The smallest one verified by operation was 12mm in ~, the biggest one 70mm. Plasma an D urine catecholamines were almost always slightly e1~#ated for both positive and negative pts. In 15 pt#<. the other methods were congruent regarding evidence or exclusion of pheo but for 5 pt the results were different: normal plasma catecholamine levels with a 3cm pheo (I), elevated values without any evidence of tumor (2), and divergence between CT and MIBG (2). Our results suggest that scintigraphy with MIBGcarried out with 250 MBq J123-MIBG (and in SPECT technique if possible) -is the most sensitive method with high specificity and should be used in spite of radiation burden at least once. Demonstration of only small uptake might be not an indication for surgery but indicates careful follow-up. ",

The mechanism of action of dipyridamole used in thallium myocardial perfusion imaging is complex. Subendocardial ischaemia may occur but perfusion defects without ischaemia are possible when the flow ratio between arteries exceeds 250%. This study examines the contribution of ischaemia to the production of thallium defects by comparing dipyridamole thallium tomography with dipyridamole magnetic resonance imaging (MR) of wall motion. Forty patients with angina and an abnormal exercise electrocardiogram underwent thallium tomography and cine magnetic resonance imaging with an intravenous infusion of 0.56mg/kg dipyridamole over 4 minutes. The myocardiam was divided into 9 segments. Thallium uptake was classed as normal, reduced or absent and wall motion as normal, hypokinetic or akinetic and the changes induced by dipyridamole were compared Reversible thallium defects were found in 36 (90)% patients but in only 24(67)% of these did magnetic resonance imaging show reversible wall motion abnormalities. The 12(33)% negative magnetic resonance scans were associated with reversible perfusion defects of ~2 segments which was significantly less than the positive magnetic resonance scans (pC0.001). The extent of wall motion abnormality was smaller than the associated perfusion defect. Reversible wall motion abnormalities were correlated with worse coronary artery disease (p<O.Ol) and chest pain during dipyridamole infusion (p<0.001). Thus in 33% of patients, thallium defects either resulted from flow changes alone or ischaemia was present but undetectable by magnetic resonance imaging. The occurence and significance of transient ischemic dilatation (TID) of the LV during dipyridamole(dipy) stress redistribution TI-201 scintigraphy was studied in 73 pts who had both dipy TI-201 and coronary angiography. TID ratio was calculated by dividing the computer derived left ventricle area on the initial planar anterior image by that of the 4 hr image. The extent of myocardial ischemia was evaluated by TI-201 reversibility score (initial-redistribution visual scores) and a score of >7was considered to represent extensive ischemia. In the ii pts with non-significant (450%) coronary stenosis the lID ratio was 0.98 + 0.046. An abnormal TID ratio was thus defined as >1.T2 representing~_3SD above the mean normal value. Comparing the 15 pts with an abnormal TID ratio to the 58 with a normal ratio, the former group had a significantly higher (p<.05) incidence of critical (>90%) coronary stenosis (93% vs 55%) often with collaterals (67% vs 24%) and an extensive myocardial ischemia (54%vs 12.5%). The incidence of dipy induced positive ECG, increased lung uptake and chest pain was not significantly different. An abnormal TID ratio of>l.12 was a sensitive (5/8=62.5%) and specific (55/65=85%T marker of triple vessel critical coronary disease. We conclude that transient ischemic dilatation of the LV may be observed during dipyridamole TI-201 scintigraphy and implies extensive myocardial ischemia caused by underlying critical coronary stenosis. We have analysed during PTCA in 20 patients (pts) presenting single vessel disease assessed by angiography, with MIBI tomography (SPECT) transient myocardial ischemia (MI) consecutive to coronary balloon inflation. The extent of myocardial ischemia during PTCA was compared to the extent of MI at stress before PTCA, and to regional ejection fraction (EF) and left ventricular volumes. MIBI was injected intravenously and 5 seconds after first occlusion, on the PTCA day. In addition, in 5 pts, a selective thallium intracoronary injection was performed to visualize perfusion area distal to the balloon.The malperfusion score obtained from segmental analysis of MIBI tomogram is significantly higher in 18 pts during PTCA, than on stress tomogram before PTCA (p(0,01) while in 2 pts with collaterals, the extent of MI is larger at stress, than during PTCA. In these pts, thallium distribution overlaps with MIBI distribution while no overlap is observed in pts without collateral. Ventriculography performed during PTCA demonstrates the extent of mechanical ventricular dysfunction with a good correlation between the score of myocardial ischemia during occlusion and the area of abnormal ventricular wall motion and the Left ventricuLar EF (r = 0.81;r = -0.80). Intravenous injection of MIBI just after coronary artery occlusion during PTCA aLLows to visuaLize transient ME induced by balloon infLation, that correlates fairly with the extent of ventricular dysfunction during an-giopLasty while dual tracers studies provide the opportunity to demonstrate coLLateraL flow.

Compton-scatter correction is of prime necessity to improve scintigraphic image quality and extracted parameter accuracy. The conventional window acquisition (+ or -10%) is not entirely satisfactory. The proposed CFASS method allows to determine the spatial and energy distribution of the scattered photons. From list mode acquisition including energy information (60-180 KeY for 99mTc), an energy image sequence is derived. Then, estimates of the underlying spectral components (factors) are extracted from the sequence using a photopeak model as a constraint : one concerns the acquisition photopeak, the others the Compton-scattered photons. These factors are associated with factor images, which are the estimates of their spatial distribution. Results obtained with phantoms and patients using various radioisotopes will be presented. They show an improvement of the contrast of the images compared to the conventional ones. For a given acquisition, CFASS technique has the advantages :",

The amplitude is an exponential function of depth. The equations derived for the slopes and amplitudes of the SDFs provides the basis for developing an accurate scatter correction algorithm for SPECT. SPECT images are impaired by the absence of any correct and appropriate attenuation correction. A new and fast transmission technique has been designed to measure attenuation coefficients (~ C) to be used towards a true correction. This technique combines a point source (PS) of activity (1-2 mCi) with an uncollimated yC. The PS is obtained by a collimated lead shield syringe having a small aperture and fixed on a rod. The rod rotates with the head of they C (Sophy DSX rectangular). The cristal is protected by an obstructor limiting the field of view to a rectangular window and aligned with the PS both separated by 70-100cm. Each projection is acquired in one second. It has a cone beam geometry. Data are rearranged, slice by slice, in a set of parallel projections before reconstruction with the standard SPECT software. Due to the cone beam geometry, the total field of transverse reconstruction is i0 cm wide, 5 cm on each side of the plane described by the source, pC values are calculated with the equation E~i = Ln (N0/N) where NO is a blank acquisition. Results in cold phantoms using a Tc-99m PS show a good resolution (FWHM < 8 mm with 64 x (64x64) projections) in the transverse plane. Furthermore, pC values show less then 5 % error on a pixel basis and 1% error on an average basis. Conclusion : pC can be obtained rapidly with a point source of small activity of any given isotope and with an uncollimated rotating yC. SPECT images can then be corrected for attenuation, using pC mapping, and an appropriate algorithm.",

Aim of this study is to establish the efficacy of 99mTc-DMSA (V) in detecting occult metastases in patients with out clinical appearance of disease with persistent eleva tion of serum calcitonine after radical thyroidectomy. 9 pts (i month -15 years after radical thyroidectomy) were studied by whole body and regional scans after i.v. inj. of 555-740 MBq of 99mTc-DMSA (V). The serum calcito nine ranged between i00 to 22218 pg/ml. 2 pts underwent respectively 2 and 3 scans at 2-4 months intervals. At the first study, a pathological uptake was observed in 6 eases (5 in mediastinum, i in mediastinum plus neck).The se findings were subsequently eonfirmed by CT or MRI (i-4 months later). In one patient with a positive result in mediastinum, a subsequent study performed 2 months la ter, after radical resection of recurrence, showed an aspecifie sternal uptake. The third examination (4 months later) was positive in the neck. As regards the 3 patients with negative findings, 2 showed a clinical recurrence 4-12 months later (in one case with a positive scan). The last one is still free of disease, ~ months later. In conclusion in our experience 99mTc-DMSA (V) is a successful imaging method in early diagnosis of occult metastasis. In case of negative findings the study must be repeated every 4 mos. or in case of clinical appearance of disease. [\u2022 aim of this study was to assess the role of ~mTc(V)]DMSA scintigraphy in the management of patients with MCT. i0 patients with suspected primary, recurrent or metastatic MCT were studied. 2 patients had primary disease, 7 patients were asymptomatic but had persistent and serial elevations in serum calcitonin following previous thyroid resections for MCT and 1 asymptomatic patient with normal serum calcitonin was studied because of suspected hilar node metastases. The serial calcitonin peak in the patients was 0.04-43ng/ml (normal <0.08ng/ml). Scintigraphy was considered positive in 7 of the asymptomatic patients, negative in I and equivocal in I. The 2 patients with primary disease had increased uptake before but not after thyreidect0my. Localised recurrence and distant metastases in soft tissue (4 patients) and bone (I patient) were detected in these patients ~ and this resulted in surgical resection (3 patients) and early r~iotherapy (i patient). We conclude that [~nTc(V)]DMSA is a useful imaging agent in the evaluation of asympt0matic MCT patients with or without hyperealcitonemia, Aim of this study was to compare three different scintigraphic techniques for the localization of local recurrences and metastases in patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma.",

Investigations into the use of antibody-streptavidin (AB-ST) and labeled biotin to improve radioimmunotargeting have shown background levels drastically reduced over the conventional approach. Nevertheless, accumulation of lll-ln-Biotin in normal tissue as well as AB-ST independent accumulation in tumor, was observed. Altering the biotin molecule to reduce this nonspeeific uptake without decreasing specific localization has been investigated. Three EDTA and DTPA derivatives of biotin have been synthesized. In addition to the DTPA-biocytin dimer (i.e. 2 biotins per molecule) the monoderivatized EDTA biotins have been synthesized. The labeled biotin derivatives were administered IP to normal mice implanted with avidin beads in one thigh. At 24 hrs post administration, a wide variation in biodistribution was observed among the biotin derivatives. The most favorable results were obtained with monoderivatized EDTA-biotin which showed the lowest accumulation in normal tissues but equivalent uptake in the target with respect to DTPAbiocytin. Averaged over 7 tissues sampled, the target/ nontarget ratio was 70 vs 8 for monoderivatized EDTAbiotin vs. DTP~-biogytin (n=6) and 140 vs 9 in an identical repeat experiment (n=6). Equivalent observations have been made in tumored mice and in culture with tumor cell lines. Positive accumulation of DTPAbiocytin was measured in tumor cells independent of AB-ST, however, a 16-20 fold reduction is demonstrated with EDTA-biotin monomer. These studies show that modification of the biotin species can not only alter accumulation in normal tissues but also reduce the AB-ST independent accumulation in tumor tissue.",

After a 15 min perfusion period the hearts were lyophilized and weighed. The labeled lipids were extracted by an acidified Folch technique. Lipids were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Endogenous phospholipids (pl) were detected by UV at 203 nm and non-polar lipids (npl) at 214 nm.

Thallium-201-diethyldithiocarbamate rCBF SPECT imaging was performed within 24 hrs after stroke onset and repeated at 2 weeks and 6 months. Clinical assessment took place at the same intervals. The size of the flow deficit, both initially and after 6 months, on a visual semiquantitative scale, correlated with the clinical condition. Six out of 15 available SPECT scans showed some hyperfixation at 2 weeks. These patients had no better prognosis in terms of motor or overall function than patients without hyperfixation. At 2 weeks the SPECT disturbance had significantly decreased, without clinical correlate. The flow defect 6 months after the infarct had decreased in size in 9 from 15 available scans, this was parallelled with a more favourable motor improvement than the 6 patients whose deficit grew. The flow deficit at 6 months was somewhat smaller than at admission, this difference was not significant. In conclusion it can be said that the size and intensity of the flow deficit, either in the acute or in a more stable phase, do correlate with the clinical condition of the patient. Scans taken 2 weeks after brain infarction yield unreliable clinical information. The specific property of Tc-99m HMPAO is that its distribution pattern in the brain tissue is determined in a short period and kept for a long time. This property was applied to the evaluation of haloperidol (H) effects on brain function in schizophrenia using a high resolution SPECT system (Toshiha, GCA9a00A). In three schizophrenic patients one control subject, 555 MBq of HMPA0 was injected. Then I0 mE of H was intramuscularly injected at 3 min p.i. of HMPAO. Immediately after the Ist SPECT study (baseline) 925 MBq of HMPA0 from the same vial was additionally injected. Three minute later the 2nd SPECT study was performed. After reconstruction the Ist SPECT images were subtracted from the 2nd images to obtain images during H. EEG was simultaneously monitored throughout the study. and parietal count ratios were 0.92-+0.05, 0.93-+0.04, and 0.94-+0.03 at baseline, and 1.09+0.08, I.]5+0.13, and 1.08-+0.05 at H, respectively, for both hemispheres. These ratios were 1.01-+0.03 at baseline and 1.01 -+ 0.04 at H in the control subject. These r'esults suggest that the antipsychotic drug has substantial effects on regional brain function in schizophrenia. The drug may improve frontal lobe hypofunction and suppress temporo-parieto-oceipital hyper'function especially in the dominant hemisphere. ",

The aim of this study was look for changes of the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose consumption (rCMRGIc) in such P. rCMRGlc was measured in 7 P (P1-P?) with GA and normal NMR scans using the high-resolution PET PC-4096 and the standard 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose method, rCMRGIc was measured in various cerebellar, subcortieal, and cortical structures, and ratios (MCR) were calculated between rCMRGIc in each structure and the mean cortical rCMRGIc. The data obtained in the P were compared to the normal range (average \u2022 2*s.d.) of 20 age-matched normal subjects. Significant regional decreases of either rCMRGIc or the MCR were observed in 6 of 7 P. These involved the thalamus in 4 of 7 P, the cerebellum in 2 of 7 P, the medial temporal cortex in 2 of 7 P, and the striatum in 1 of 7 P. P1 had an involvement of thalamus and medial temporal cortex, P2 an involvement of cerebellum and medial temporal cortex, and P3 an involvement of thalamus and striatum. P4-P6 had involvement of one structure only (thalamus or cerebellum). These data indicate that regional metabolic disturbances (RMD) detectable by PET occur in P with GA despite normal NMR scans. The localisation of these metabolic disturbances in brain structures relevant to memory suggest a possible causative role of these RMD in GA. CEA-BLOOD-LEVEL:INDICATION   FOR  IMMUNOSCINTIGRAPHY?

Ultrasound and CT often fail in the early stages because tissue-morphology alone presents no strong criteria at this time. We have tested the clinical value of the 99mTclabeled monoclonal anti-CEA antibody BW 431/26 (Behring/Hoechst) in 24 patients with increasing blood-levels of CEA (9 colon-,7 rectum-,2 hepatocellular-,l breast-cancer). Ultrasound and CT findings were doubtful (7) or negative. Pathologic antibody-uptake we got in 24 localizations,18 due to metastases in the liver (ii) and lymphnodes (7),3 due to local tumor recurrences. False positive uptake was caused by atypical vessel-formations",

In sum we had 21 true positive findings (hot and cold spots together), 3 false positive findings (correct diagnosed uptake in a kinking aorta or in bowel structures after 24 h were not judged as false positive),2 false negative, and 4 true negative findings. We can conclude that doubtful or negative findings in CT,ultrasound,and MRI) are an indication for immunoscintigraphy in patients with increasing CEA-levels in the blood, as there is a high probability of tumorgrowth. anti-CEA/19-9 (IMACIS-1) = monoclonal antibodies. In 28 pts. with known primaries (group A) IS was performed to exclude metastatic disease, in 32 (group B) because of suspected recurrencies, and in 8 (group C) as routine follow-up. Surgery revealed a total of 69 lesions: 28 local recurrencies, 28 liver metastases, and 18 lymphnode metastases. Detection rates of IS were 21/28 (75%), 18/28 (64%), and 8/18 (23%) respectively. 5/6 unknown lesions were found in group B (2 local recurrencies, 3 liver metastases), 1 in group A (liver metastasis). In group C, 6 studies were found true negative, 2 false positive (specificity 75%). Only 2 IS studies led to therapeutic consequences: 1 local recurrency/1 liver metastasis were resected. So, clinical impact was observed in pts. with suspected tumor relapse and inconclusive outcome of conventional diagnostic procedures (16% of group B). Profit of routine IS, however, was low (8% of group A and C). These findings do not support general employment of IS. We have performed radioimmunoscintigraphy (RIS) in 30 patients (68 +/-9 years) with eolorectal carcinoma 48 hours before surgery. In 23 patients the primary lesion was studied, in 6 the recurrences and in 26 we looked for the posibi!ity of metastases (MI) in liver, with a total of 55 lesion sites. The antibody used was the BW 431/28 (BeLting) labelled with 99mTe (851 MBq), which was proved to be the most selective antibody for CEA out df three different antibodies studied by immunochemistry. The scans were performed al a and 24 hours after the injection.

There was no relationship between the CEA levels and the RI8 findings The FN were tumors poorly diferenciated. The sensibility (S) in recurrences was 80% with an accuracy (A) of 83.3%. The S was lower in primary lesions (S=59.1%, A=56.5%} due to 5 FN in rectum, 2 FN by peritoneal careinomatosis and 1 FN by necrosis. The M1 in liver showed as hot or cold lesions (S=85.7%, A=92.3%). We recommend to be careful with cold lesions, as they could represent also non meoplasie lesions. In order to compare IS and PET for the detection of primary (n=3), or recurrent (n=10) colorectal adenocarcinoma, we studied 12 patients, 4 females and 8 males, aged 48 to 79, with CEA values ranging from 2.5 to 1755ng/ml. All patients were submitted to IS (2mg of monoclonal antibody BW431-26 labeled with 30.6+2.9mCi of 99mTc -98% efficiency), and to a PET study (2-10mCi of tSF-FDG).

Scintigraphic images were obtained 30min.,6h,24h and 48h p.i. (in addition 72h p.i. in I pat.). Results: 14 different tumour localizations were found in 10 patients (US,CT,surgery). 10 localizations of tumour disease were confirmed by liposome scanning (true positive: 10). 6 of these lesions were found to be positive only-on the late scans ( Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in female. To evaluate lymph node status biopsy of axillary lymph nodes was performed routinely. But in 20-30% retrosternal lymph nodes are infiltrated by mammary carcinoma. Internal mammary lymphoscintigraphy offers the possibility to evaluate true TNM staging, but is limitated by various anatomical details as single lymph chain and asymmetric lymph nodes. To improve this diagnostic tool, we investigated 21 patients by MRI additionally to lymphoscintigraphy (including SPECT in 5 patients). In 6/21 patients lymphoscintigraphy and MRI was normal. 8/15 pathological scintigraphic findings showed decreased uptake ipsilateral to breast tumor, 1/15 contralateral and 6/15 markedly asymmetrical lymph node status. In 6/15 patients with pathological findings by scintigraphy MR showed no lymph nodes in the suspect area. In 5/15 patients lymph nodes of normal size (lcm) were found by MRI and in 4/15 patients MRI showed enlarged lymph nodes without radionuclide uptake in scintigraphy indicating local infiltration. In conclusion MR investigation of internal mammary lymph nodes additionally to lymphoscintigraphy offers the possibility to improve TNM staging in breast cancer. Overall, 234 scintigraphic studies were performed. 181 studies were true negative without evidence of disease. 80 sites of disease had true positive Ga-67 uptake (in 21 pts/37 studies). 19 sites (in 12 pts/15 studies) were false positive. Among these, 7 were sites of persisiting colonic activity and 3 were in normal parotid glands. In addition, 31 benign lesions were detected and interpreted correctly in terms of malignancy. I0 lymphoma sites(in 6 pts/10 studies) were missed by scintigraphy. In all but two cases, scintigraphy detected at least one true positive site.",

Tangential Resolution varied from 5.4 to 5.8ram (on axis) and 6.7 to 8.6ram (off axis). Axial resolution varied from 4.6 to ll.5n~n (on axis) and 6.6 to 13.6ram (axis). Sensitivity ranged from 77to 138 Kcps/pCi/cm3. Cold lesion contrast values for five different rods were measured and for the smallest, values from 22 to 37% were obtained. Systems differed most in their sensitivity and axial resolution. The method of measuring axial resolution to obtain a clinically realistic comparison is very important. Most of the differences between systems can be explained in terms of their design;crystal size, septa design and crystal/photomultiplier configuration being vitally important.

Histological findings ere difficult to interprete and sometimes lead to wrong diagnoses. We have found antimyosin-antibodies useful for the 'histologic' in vivo classification of myosarcoma. 3 tumors showed uptake of myosin-antibodies, while histologically they were classified as neuroblastoma (mIBG was negative). In the diagnosis of ii primary tumors we had 7 true positive findings, 1 true negative result in a pseudotumor detected in CT, and 1 false positive result in a hemangiopericytoma. After therapy 4 of 12 children correctly were classified as tumor-free, 6 had proven tumor-rests, false positive findings in two children were due to necrotic tumorous tissue.Metastases were correctly found in 4 children, i0 children in the follow-up were classified as free of tumor, false positive findings were due to chordoma and osteorrhagia. We failed to diagnose small tumorous nodules on the pericardium end peritoneum in a boy with a tumor-conglomerate in the basal thorax.All rhabdoid-tumors (3) showed intense uptake of the antibody, although histologically they ere very different to myosarcomas. We conclude that immunoscintigraphy with entimyosin-antibodies represents a useful tool for diagnosing infantile tumors.

An abnormal DMSA scan at the time of UTI identifies most children with signfieant VUR and it would appear that a combination of ultrasound and DMSA scan identifies them all.

Abnormal scintigrams showed hot spots or defects, with or without expansion. Tumor infiltration presented as areas of low signal intensity on MR images. MRI had a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 73.1%. The scindgrams had a sensitivity of 57.1% and a specificity of 82.1%. Three false positive scintigrams showed one or more hot spots. Two false positive scintgrams showed local defects that were also seen with MRI. One patient with false positive hot spots on the scintigram developed a relapse after stopping the maintenance therapy.",

            "text": "Although the number of patients in this study is too small to allow definite conclusions, these findings justify fttrther investigation and follow-up of children with ALL. We suggest that localisation of bone marrow aspirates must be directed by MRI and bone marrow scintigraphy. In doubtful cases T2-weighted images should be performed. Urinary tract infections (UTI) in children are a well recognised cause of chronic renal scarring and renal failure in a small percentage of children. The need to detect the children at risk at initial presentation is therefore vital, At present ultrasound and plinar DMSA are the primary investigations of choice. Planar DMSA has been shown to be a sensitive method for detecting evidence of renal damage following UTI but its specificity is relatively low. We have used single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) in conjunction with planar 99mTe DMSA in an attempt to increase the specificity of this investigation. 22children with known UTI, age range 4-12y, have been studied with planar and SPECT 99mTe DMSA imaging using an IGe starcam system, 64 20 sec acquisition for 360 ~ and 3D reconstruction programme. The results of planar and SPECT imaging were compared with the results of IVU. 22 scars were detected by planar DMSA. Whilst SPECT DMSA detected 14 of the 15 scars on IVU. Sensitivity of planar and SPECT is 93% but SPECT shows a higher specificity (92%) than planar DMSA (79%). Duplex systems, foetal lobulation and splenic impressions are the cause of false positive DMSA studies. These normal variants were more readily evident on 3D SPECT images and distinguishable from true scarring. This study suggest that SPECT imaging with 3D reconstruction gives the sensitivity and specificity required to accurately detect the presence of renal scarring in children with a history of UTI. In order to determine the diagnostic reliability of IRMCU we evaluated retrospectively 49 consecutive children (31F, 18M), aged 1 mo to 13 yrs in whom renography followed by IRMCU was performed as part of the initial work up, together with X-ray micturition cysto-urethrography (MCU) and cystoscepy. On MCU, VUR were absent in 5, unilateral in 18 and bilateral in 26 patients. Stage III or more VUR were observed in 14 patients with unilateral and in 25 (42 units) with bilateral disease. IRMCU was performed when activity had cleared from the renal pelvis after routine renography with 1-123 OIH (14 -20 uCi/kg). 5 sec frames were acquired starting 2 min before and continuing for 2 min after micturition. 56/56 units with VUR III on MCU also showed VUR on IRMCU. Only 4/14 stage I-II VUR remained undetected by IP~MCU although low grade VUR is not expected to be seen by this method. With respect to MCU, overall sensitivity was high (94%) but specificity was low (50%), as 14/28 units with no VUR on MCU showed pathologic IP/4CU, i0 of which presented meatal latera!ization and/or dilatation of mild (4), moderate (5) or severe (i) degree, 2 granular cystitis and 2 vesioo-urethral dyssynergy. In 3 of them renal function was impaired as it was in 4/14 low and 20/56 high grade VUR kidneys. The association of morphological and/or functional anomalies with VUR demonstrated only by IRMCU may partly represent MCU false negatives. IRMCU as a non-invasive and sensitive test,is a valuable complement of renography performed during follow~up of VUR.",

This approach has the advantage over contrast urography of a lower radiation burden and over renal scintigntphy of giving also an assessment of renal function, which might be very useful for follow-up studies. It is intuitive that children with hydronephrosis, in whom obstruction cannot be excluded on diuretic renography, should be considered for pyeloplasty, particulalry if they have impaired renal function. In many such children, the hydronephrosis is detected antenatally. We studied the effects of surgery on renal function and drainage in 29 children with unilateral, antenatally diagnosed, hydronephrosis. Thirty-eight other patients with this diagnosis, who, for various reasons did not undergo surgery, were also studied. Patients were studied on 2-6 occasions at ages ranging from I month to 5 years using Tc-99m DTPA diuretic renography. Kidneyswith less than 43% of total function were considered to have impaired function. Obstruction was defined on the basis of the response to frusemide and bladder emptying. Although drainage improved in 9/29 following surgery, there was no significant improvement in function, even when only those patients with obstruction and impaired function were considered.",

Two groups of chil dren were studied. The first (48 pts) with DMSA and DTPA the second (30 pts) with DMSA and MAG3. DMSA was performed 8 days after the onset of the first known event and the second examination 8-12 days later. Each child unde[ went ultrasonography and cystography to diagnose a malformative disease, particularly a reflux nephropathy. An escretory urography was performed only in few cases. Afo cal scar or a diffuse hypocaptation of one kidney with a L/R ratio greater then 5% were considered as a positive result. The total sensitivity (76 pts) of DMSA was 70% (respectively 67% in the first group and 73% in the second group); higher sensitivity in 33 pts with malforma~ ive disease was observed; 88% vs 56% in absence of malfor marion. The total sensitivity of DTPA was very low: 28% (38% in pts with malformations). The sensitivity of MAG3 was 47% and raised to 64% in case of malformative disease. No case negative to DMSA was positive to DTPA or MAG 3. An urinary tract obstruction was found by DTPA in 6 pts and by MAC~ in 9 pts (in 4 pts without other signs of parenchimal abnormalities). In conclusion DMBA showed the best sensitivity. The role of MAG3must be further de_ fined for its relative high sensitivity in diagnosis of renal damage combined with the diagnosis of obstruct, uropaty.

Brain SPECT revealed decreased RPI in left hippocampus 8, in right hippocampus 6, left parietal region 2, frontal i. No deficit was seen in 4. Delayed control PSECT showed intact perfusion in 7 patients, remaining impaired perfusion in 3. Conclusion: i. There is a vascular component in etiology of TGA -primarily as ischemic attack or following SD. No evidence of epileptic activity with ictal hyperperfusion. 2. The side of the attack is independent from handedness. 3. In acute phase the impairement can be localized in hippocampus region.

For the early diagnosis of LCPD MRI was similiar as sensitive as isotope bone scan and more precise than conventional radiography. The extent of the necrotic area within the epiphysis could be better assessed by MRI than by conventional radiography or bone scan. Providing a more detailed depiction of bone marrow and soft tissues MRI showed exactly the position and contour of the femoral head including the femoral and acetabular cartilage. The loss of containment of the femoral head could be earlier diagnosed by MRI than with conventional radiography (p = 0,03). Staging of LCPD according to the histopathogenesis was possible with MRI in elder children at least by comparing the tomograms with previous images, The beginning revascularisation of the necrotic area can be reliably assessed only with isotope bone scan, whereas the onset of reossification can be determined most exactly by radiographs. To summarize, for the evaluation of LCPD MRI proved to be especially useful for excluding other hip diseases and in follow-ups (assessment of complicative changes of the femoral head). It is possible to reduce the amount of X-rays and to avoid invasive arthrography. with myocardial infarction, in particular following application of the contrast agent Gadolinium-DTPA. In an attempt to quantify the extent of infarcted myocardium, infarct size was estimated in 21 patients with proven acute myocardial infarction using serial MRI after i.v. injection of Gd-DTPA (0.2 mmol/kg bodyweight). Early reperfusion after thrombolytic therapy with 750.000 E streptokinase i.v. was documented by coronary arteriography in 9 patients (Group I). In 12 patients (Group II) no reperfusion was obtained (5 patients) or no thrormbolytic therapy was given (7 patients). All Group II patients were considered to have no reperfusion. MRI was performed with a 0.5 T Philips Gyroscan at an average of 8+4 days postinfarction; 16 patients underwent a second MRI study at 26-+i1 days post-infarction. Nine slices (i0 r~n thick, 2 mm gap) perpendicular to the long axis of the left ventricle were obtained and for every slice the area with enhanced signal intensity (>mean+2 SD) was considered to be infarcted. These areas were summed for all slices and infarct size was expressed as a percentage of the total left ventricular volume. Infarct size was smaller in Group I (8+5%) vs Group II (15-+4%) at early MRI (P<0. 001) . Follow-up MRI studies showed similar differences in infarct size between patients with and without reperfusion. We conclude that MRI using Gd-DTPA can measure infarct size and discern patients with reperfusion, both in the early and late phase after acute myocardial infarction.",

College and Middlesex Schools of Medicine DOBUTAMINE P~GNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING IN ISCHAEMIA HEART DISEASE; A NEW TECHNIQUE Magnetic resonance imaging is difficult during dynamic exercise and this has limited its value in patients with coronary artery disease. Using intravenous dipyridamole and cine magnetic resonance imaging, we have previously demonstrated wall motion a6normalities in two thirds of patients in whom thallium defects were seen. In order to increase this sensitivity we have now used intravenous dobutamine, which increases myocardial oxygen demand and has the advantages of administration by peripheral infusion, a short half life and low arrhythmogenicity. 22 Patients with stable angina underwent coronary angiography, thallium tomography and cine magnetic resonance imaging. Images were acquired in three perpendicular planes before and after dobutamine, allowing direct comparison of perfusion and wall motion, which were graded in nine segments as normal, reduced, or absent. 20 Patients had coronary artery disease, of whom 19 (95)% had reversible perfusion defects following dobutamine. All 19 also had reversible wall motion abnormalities. The perfusion and wall motion defects corresponded very closely in site and extent. The 2 patients with normal epicardial arteries also had corresponding wall motion and perfusion abnormalities. Chest pain oceured in 18 patients but was easily controlled by decreasing the infusion rate. Transitory dysrhythmias were seen in 8 patients but were insignificant. The average increase in double product with dobutamine was 34%, 57%, 87% and IO4% with 5,10,15 and 20~g/kg/minute respectively. We conclude that magnetic resonance imaging during dobutamine stress is safe, feasible and well tolerated and that it may be possible to extend the clinical role of magnetic resonance in patients with coronary artery disease. MRI of left ventricle (LV) has proved to be an excellent method to measure systolic wall thickening (SWT). The aim of this study was to find a correlation of SWT and regional myocardial perfusion determined with TI-201 SPECT. 65 patients -42 with and 23 without history of OMI -underwent SPECT and, within the next two weeks, MRI. Enddiastolic and endsystolic spin echo images were obtained by reduced permutation technique. For measurements, on}y long axis sections through LV near the equatorial Plane were used. Slice orientation was selected according to the findings of SPECT, imaging the infarcted wal] segment by single or double angulation.

In a prospective study 26 patients, age ranged from 33 to 75 years ( mean age 52,4 years ) with clinically and / or histologically proven spondylodiscitis underwent magnetic resonance ( MR ) -imaging and radionuclide studies. In 17 patients additional follow -up examinations were performed after initial diagnose. In all studies plain x-rays were available. MRI -teehnioue: 1.5 tesla superconducting magnetic system. TI( TR: 400 --600 msec; TE: 20 -30 msec) and T2 ( TR: 2500 msec; TE: 68 -80 msec )-weighted pulse sequences ( sagittal and transversal plane ), 1\"2-weighted gradient-echo-sequences ( sagittal plane ); in 15 patients additional T1 weighted pulse sequences with Gadolinium -DTPA ( 0.2 mmol /kg ;i.v. ).

Re~lt~: Typical changes of spendylodiscitis in plain x-rays and MRI are blurred outlines of the superior and / or inferior end plate of lhe vertebral bodies. In addition mostly we found a decrease of height of the disc space. In acute pyogenic and tuberculous spondylodiscitis there is a low signal of the disc and the adjacent plates of the vertebral bodies in TI weighted plain images and a highly increased signal in T2-weighted images, as well as a significant contrast enhancement in TI-weighted images after administration ofGd-DTPA. In patients with pyogenic infection there is a high uptake of 99m-Tc-HMDP in acute spondylodiscitis In cases of tuberculous infections ( n=3 ) we found a minimal uptake in 2 patients; no uptake was observed in one patient. In patients of chronic spondylodiscitls bone scintigraphy was positive in all examinations, but generally we found a lower technetium -uptake in comparison to acute infections. Conclusion: 1) MRI in comparison to bone scintigraphy is more sensitive in chronic and tuberculous spondylodiscitls and shows the same sensitivity in acute pyogenie spondylodiscitis.",

We used PET and F-18-uracil in order to compare the accumulation of the cytostatie agent in metastases and normal liver parenehyma after intravenous and intraarterial tracer application. Furthermore, O-15 labeled water was injected to evaluate the perfusion pattern. The evaluation comprises 34 examinations (intravenous and intraarterial studies) in 17 patients with surgically implanted catheters in the gastroduodenal artery Standardized uptake values (SUV) were calculated using a ROI technique for the metastases, normal liver parenchyma and the aorta. The FU metabolite concentrations were higher in 13 of 24 metastases using the i.a. approach, while in 5 metastases the concentrations were lower following i.a. FU infusion. In one patient a five fold increase in FU uptake was noted after i.a. tracer application. We observed a higher systemic toxicity in 25 % of the patients. The accumulation of the perfusion tracer O-15 labeled water was up to 10 times higher in the metastases after intraarterial injection, while a <50 % increase of the FU uptake was noted after the regional application. Therefore, perfusion studies alone are not useful to estimate the FU accumulation in metastases. The results of the ongoing study demonstrate, that PET with F-18-uraeil should find preferential use to optimize the regional chemotherapy and to select those patients who do profit from the intraarterial approach. The purpose of this study was to examine the uptake of C-ll hydroxyephedrine (HED) in pheochromocytoma.

The diagnostic work up of preoperative patients with thoracic tumors using conventional techniques and including CT and MRI remains limited compared to surgical staging with an overall sensitivity reported in the range of 50-80 %. Our study sought to use PET with a metabolically active compound, F-18-1abeled deoxyglucose (FDG), to detect increased uptake in neoplastic tissue to delineate active tumor from surrounding tissue, its lymphatic spread and to differentiate neoplastic from inflammatory tissue. We performed endpoint measurements 55 rain post i.v. injection of 440 MBq FDG and acquired 5 rain. transmission scans and 15 min. emission scans. Tracer uptake concentrations were calculated by a ROI-teehnique, standardized for injected dose and body volume and expressed as standardized uptake values (SUV). 30 patients with completed clinical staging for lung tumor were studied with PET prior to surgery. All malignant tumors were clearly delineated with high contrast to the surrounding structures. The preliminary evaluation includes 18 patients with 14 malignant tumors (5 squamous, 2 small cell, 1 adeno, 1 large cell, 2 mesothelioma, 1 metastase, 2 Pancoast) and 4 benign lesions (1 cyst, 2 gangrene, 1 castleman disease). Fourteen malignant and 3 benign tumors were correctly identified due to their different FDG-uptake values while the Castleman disease showed high FDG accumulation. In 5 out of the 14 malignant tumors, PET correctly changed the T-classification (3 lower, 2 higher) compared to the previous staging whereas 7 agreed. Our results show that FDG-PET can improve the preoperative staging and shows great potential for improving the sensitivity. When stable isotope labelled (15N2) urea was administered orally with a test meal, the high urease activity of Campylobacter-pylori-infected individuals yielded 15N-labelled ammonia. The 15N abundance of the urinary ammonia and urea could be detected easily 3 hours later using a simple microdiffusion technique and emission spectrometric 15N analysis. Individuals without gastric urease activity eliminated practically no (15N) ammonia over this period. This corresponds to an 15N(ammonia)/ 15N(urea) ratio less than 0.05. Infected individuals showed ratios above 0.08 and reached ratios more than 0.20.",

NHR spectroscopy shows that the complex exists as three isomers with the carboxylate groups oriented 8y~-syn, ayn-anti, and antf-antf with respect to the oxo-group. It is not yet clear which (if not all) of the isomers are tumour specific. There is no spectroscopic suggestion of interaction between the metal and the carboxylie acid groups. Potentiometric titration shows that ca. 2 of the ~ earboxylie acid groups are ionised at pH 7. The proposed structure is supported by the similar biodistribution of the iS6Re analogue (shown spectroscopically to be the square-pyramidal complex Re0(DMSA)Z) in a patient with MTC.",

These data may have implications for turnout and kidney uptake mechanisms. containing an internal cleavable linking group between the antibody and chelated indium have demonstrated faster background clearance (JNM 30: 1693 (JNM 30: , 1989 . In this study linking groups have been added to one of the carboxylic acid groups of the semi-rigid chelate CDTA by either of two general synthetic routes. In the first, symmetrical linkers containing terminal amines were reacted with the monoanhydride of CDTA (CDTAMA). To avoid crosslink.ing, amines (ethylenediamine, 1,6-diaminohexane, 4,4'methylenedianiline, and 4-aminophenylether) were either reacted in excess with CDTAMA or converted to mono-t-Boc derivatives prior to reaction with CDTAMA. Hydrolysis of the t-Boc followed by treatment with thiophosgene produced the isothiocyanates of the CDTA-4,4'-methylenedianiline and -4-aminophenyl-ether. In the second route, symmetrical linkers containing terminal carboxylic acids such as 1, 10-decanedicarboxylic acid are ethyleneglycolbis-succinate were converted to their NHS esters and reacted in excess with CDTAethylene-diamine in DMSO. Concentration of the reaction mixture followed by CH2C12 addition precipitated the CDTAethylenediamine linker. These linker-chelates have been characterized by NMR, conjugated to antibodies, and stored under desiccant without loss of reactivity. Evaluation of these preparations in mice is currently underway. The above examples demonstrate the general synthetic utility of these routes to prepare a wide variety of CDTA-linkers. IESPI had a maximal effect on 3H-8OHDPAT (ICs0 = 6 10-9M) pointing out its specificity for 5HTzA receptors. These results showed that addition of an iodoethyl group on 3-N position of the spirodecanone part of spiperone or spiroxatrine does not prevent binding on specific receptors. We can assume that this method of iodoalkylation can be applied to spirodecanone parts of different compounds in order to give new iodinated ligands for monoaminergic receptors.",

University of Oviedo** and Abbott Laboratories (Germany)*** SERUM BCM BEHAVIOUR IN PATIENTS WITH NONMALIGNANT DI-SEASES AND WITHACTIVE NON BREAST TUMORS In order to study its behaviour, we have determined by an IRMA assay (M85/34 and A169 Mabs; Abbott )the serum levels'of BCM (breast cancer mucin) in 70 HBsAg-blood donors (control group), 155 patients with non tumoral pathologies and 161 with active non breast tumors. In control group, BCM values oscillated between 2.6 and 15.3 U/ml (8.3+2.9) and 15 U/ml was taken ~as upper normal level (97.~ percentile. In non tumoral group, BCM values higher thafil5 U/ml were observed in 29 patients (18.7%); in general, antigen increases were moderate and infrequent, except i~ cirrhosis (42.5%; r:5.1-42.7; median 16) and acute hepatitis (28.6% ; r:2-39.5 ; median 16).When cirrhotic patients were excluded, BCM va lues higher than 15 and 25 U/ml were observed in 12 any 1 cases (10.4% and 0.8% respectively). In active non breast tumors group, BCM values higher than 15 U.ml were noted in 73 cases (44.7%), cooresponding the most im portant percentages of positives to ovarian (54.5%), -lung (65.6%), colo-rect~l (44%) and prostatic (35.7%) tumors. When 25 U/ml was used as threshold those values were: 24.2% , 28.1%, 14.6% and 21% respectively. These results led us to consider the following: a)It is possible to observe high BCM lecels in patients with non tumoral diseases, especially with cirrhosis, but they are ussually moderate and lower than 25 U/ml; b) 25 U/ml can be used as threshold for tumoral activity (2% of positives) and c) BCM is not specific for breast cancers, being ovarian, lung and prostatic tumors the entities those can determine BCM serum levels higher than 25 U/ml. In non breast tumors there was a correlation between antigen increases and distant dissemination. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of tumor markers CA 549 (Hybritec) and SP2 (Sorin) determined by IRMA together with of other markers commonly used: CA 15.3, CEA and TPA. Serum levels of these markers were analyzed in 188 female subjects classified as follows: 54 blood donors (control group) and 135 patients with breast carcinoma of which 71 had active disease and 64 were in complete remission.",

Radioaerosol deposition in the airways follows not only regional ventilation but is also influenced by the particle size, airway geometry and breathing manoevre.

The flow in the fantom was increasd step by step from 5 to 50 ml/min and the passing radioaerosol collected in bacterial filters. In general a linear correlation was found between the input gas flow and the activity in each filter and tube together as a measure of particle flow However, in stenoses below 3 mm in diameter the percentage of slope was different in an opposite way in laminar and eddy flow for the wet and dry radioaerosol.

A computer model was used to calculate the distribution of 81mKr in the lungs of a seated patient as seen by a gamma camera. The distribution in three zones, upper, middle and lower, was assessed following steady state brathing of 81mKr. Predefined values of specific ventilation and varying breath rates and breathing patterns were examined. The change in inspired concentration during the course of the breath was taken into consideration. In a group of 88 patients the median number of breaths to acquire a posterior image was 27 (range 9-101). The counting geometry was determined from a thoracic CT scan, assuming lung tissue densities of 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 g/ml for the upper, middle and lower zones respectively. The detected counts per unit volume were 5% and 12% greater in the middle and lower zones compared with the upper zones. For a normal subject the gamma camera would have estimated the ventilation in all zones to within 2% of the true value. Breath rate, breathing pattern and inspired concentration changes had little influence on this result. Having the specific ventilation to any zone caused the ventilation to that zone to be overestimated by 6% with a corresponding underestimation shared between the remaining regions. In conclusion the distribution of 81mKr provides an indication of ventilation adequate for most clinical purposes, but accurate quantification of ventilation cannot be determined from routine 81mKr images.

We present results of 28 patients with breast cancer who received 1-123 E2 and underwent SPECT imaginguf breasts and axillae to detect estrogen receptor positive (ER + ) breast cancer in vivo. Following approval by institutional review board and obtaining informed consent from the patient, 50pCi/kg ofi-123 E2 was injected intravenously, SPECT imaging was performed two hours after injection. A Siemens Orbiter and Sophy G \u00a7 computer was used. Median clinical follow-up was 24-months (range 46-2 months.) I-123 E2 SPECT imaging demonstrated 8 of 9 breast cancers proven histologically present at time of imaging. Four tumors were ER+, 3 were ER-and two were of undetermined ER status. There was one false negative of unknown ER status. Four of four metastases were seen, six of six axillary nodes were seen. Initially there were 12 \"false-positive\" axillary nodes and two \"false positive\" scans showing mediastinal involvement. With clinical follow-up, 2 of 12 axillae are found to contain tumor and 1 of 2 mediastinum demonstrated cancer of adequate volume to be detected by current radiographic techniques. Asymmetrical 1-123 E2 uptake in breasts with dense mammographic fibrocystic disease was associated with breast cancer while no increase of 1-123 E2 has been associated with a benign follow-up. Use of 1-123 E2 has clinical promise. ",

The choice of the radiolabel and the size of the macromolecule seem to influence the extent and specificity of the uptake of radio-proteins in inflammation foci. The purpose of the present study was develop a radiopharmaceutical stable enough to withstand the drastic pH changes and enzymatic action prevailing in the GI tract. Polymeric latexes containing monodisperse polymeric spheres with extremely unit sizes (i~-i0~) were prepared by a novel coaxial dispersion polymerization of styrene and dimethylaminoethylacrylete (DMAEA). Polystrene was the basic carrier matrix. Poly DMAEA was a positively charched coating. These particles (25 mg in 0.5 H20 solution) were labelled with 99mTc04 -(370 MBq) by the use of the tin reduction method. The labelling efficiency was >99% as determined by ITLC-SG strips in acetone. The stability of the label was tested up to 48h after storage at R.T, The amount of free 99mTc04-was 0.39 + 0.29% ( 15 determinations). The labelled particles (37 MBq in 1 ml) were given orally to 5 rabbits. Scintigrams were obtained at certain intervals up to 48h by a gamma camera (Toshiba GCA 601S). ROils were drawn over the GI tract and whole body. The feces were collected and counted against std. Almost all the radioactivity (>99%) remained in the GI tract. The colon was visualized very well. The rest of the body including the thyroid could not be imaged. Our results indicated that the radiopharmaceutical developed in this study was stable both in vitro and in vivo and demonstrated the GI morpholgy in detail and was thus ideal for the intended purpose. The prevalence of human active atherosclerotic lesions imaged by lllIn-oxine radiolabelled platelets varies (3-90%) in various segments in different clinical conditions in adults. Patients (n=80) with positive lesions after autologous radiolabelling (100~Ci lllIn-oxine) of platelets suffering from coronary heart disease and peripheral vascular disease as well were selected. We examined the time course of local lesion piatelet deposition and platelet survival under the single and combined treatment of prostaglandins (PGI2, PGEI) and organic nitrates (nitric oxide [NO] donors: isosorbide dinitrate, molsidolate). The platelet uptake ratio (PUR) (i.e. counts over the lesion area divided by the ones over unaffected contralateral side after background subtraction) was quantified daily for 5 days before therapy and after 5 weeks during treatment. Platelet survival was calculated using the multiple hit model. Both the NO-donors had no effect on PUR and platelet survival significantly. The PG's (PGI2 > PGEI) caused a significant improvement of both PUR and platelet survival. The combined therapy of PG and NO-donor induced a further significant improvement in local (PUR) and systemic (survival) haemostasis. These findings for the first time show a synergistic action of prostaglandins and NO in vivo in reducing vascular thrombogenicity. We have recently demonstrated significant differences between regional cerebral accumulation of radiolabel derived from fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and glucose (GLU) under conditions of local stimulation. In order to better define whether these changes are caused by transport or metabolic differences, we developed a double tracer method for direct measurement and comparison of FDG and GLU rate constants.",

PCR and PFR remained constant throughout the study. The patterns of phase distribution and sequential phase changes of the food in the stomach we observed indicate that the proximal stomach does not undergo phasic contractions while in the distal stomach, contractions originate in mid-corpus and propagate aberrelly to the pylorus. This is in agreement with results already obtained by other investigators with invesive techniques, In conclusion, the scintigraphic test can be used to noninvasively and quantitatively characterize gastric motility and to delineate the spatial sequence of gastric contractions. This technique can be applied to study the pathophysiology of gastric emptying in various motor disorders.

Following 12h fasting state, the patients were given orally 150ml of water containing 37 MBq of 99mTc-latex particles. Sequential frames (2 min/each) up to 3h was recorded to document temporal progression of radio-activity. The patients were allowed to eat standard meal at given times.

In addition, it was possible to evaluate GI tract morphology with excellent detail. Since 1984 we have treated 15 children with neuroblastoma stage Ill or IV. A total of 40 treatlmmts were carried out.The median follow-up time was 13 months and in 5 patients 4 years. Most of the children suffered from a recurrence. In 12 patients a stage IV was found. They were treated i -6 times. The median tumor dose was 25 Gy. The MIBG half life in the tumors of this group was 2.5 days. In 7 patients a tumor reduction was achieved proved by various parameters as radiological and sonographie examinations and tumor marker detecminatiens. 3 of these 12 patients are alive, 3 patients with a st~e Ill disease were treated 2 -5 times. The median tumor dose was 22 GL with a half life of 2.3 days. All 3 children are alive. In 2 cases the tumor was reduced in size. 2 cases could be operated successfully after MI~-treatment and they are still in remission. In one child who could not be oberated after MIBG, there was so progression. ~s MIBG-activity was 326 MBq/kg for both stages. The half life of the whole body was 1.8 days, the resulting whole body r~iation exposure was 0.5 Gy. Side eff~ts consisted of a reversible reduction of leukocytes and thrombocytes. Thrombocytes were more affected than leucocytes. In 3 cases a leucopenia and in 6 cases a thrombecytopenia was induced. No other severe side effects were registrated up to now. We ~mncl~e that most cases of nenroblastoma III and IV respond well to MIBG-treatmest. The therapeutic response does not differ in patients with stage III or IV. No patient became completely free of tumor by MI~ treatment only. Therefore it is necessary to continue therapy after MIgG treatment with other medalities. Patients ~ith ,a neuroblastoma Ill may be cured if a radical operation can be done after MI~ therapy. Side effect are moderate. Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood, in most cases showing specific enrichment of meta-iodo-benzylguanidine (MIBG). The aim of our study was to determine the reliability of MIBG in primary tumor diagnosis and evaluation of metastatic and recurrent disease. From 1982 to now, we performed 137 MIBG-scintigraphies in 97 children, either with iodine-123 (n=71) or iodine-131 (n=66). Indications for scintigraphy were the differential diagnosis of abdominal masses (n=ll), staging of neuroblastoma before and after surgery (n=68), monitoring of disease status after chemotherapy (n=51), or the evaluation of clinical symptoms (n=7). 79 patients had neuroblastomas, 56 of them suffering from stage III or IV disease. Specificity in primary tumor diagnosis was 98 %, sensitivity = 91%. For bone marrow involvement and recurrent disease, sensitivity was 75 % each. It decreases in cases of very large tumors or weak bone marrow involvement. In 30 cases, an additional bone scintigraphy was performed. 22 children had bone lesions with corresponding findings of both examinations in 20 cases. MIBG scintigraphy and bone marrow biopsies after chemotherapy showed correlating results. 43 MIBG scans were true negative, Ii scans showed false negative results, 6 of them being performed after chemotherapy. We conclude that MIBG scintigraphy is a sensitive and highly specific method in routine monitoring of neuroblastoma. We performed 63 studies in 41 patients(pts)with suspected or proved disease.19 pts were males and 22 females. The age of the pts ranged Im-16y(mean 4,7y).13pts had no therapy before the examination.In 28 pts the study was performed to evaluate the response to therapy and/or to detect recurrences.The studies were acquired 48,72 and 168h after i.v.injection of 18.5MBq of 131-I-MIBG in a gamma camera GE 40OT coupled to a StarII computer.Static images of 600s using a 128x128 matrix were acquired.When necessary bone,kidney and hepatosplenic area were imaged using 99mTc labeled products.SPECT was used as well. We found 25 studies normal corresponding to ]7 pts in remission and 8 pathologies other than neuroblastoma.38 studies were abnormal:f8 showed the initial lesion and 20 demonstrated the recurrences or residual lesion. 131-I-MIBG was able to confirm all the suspected lesions and gave additional lesions in lO:lymph node involvement in 3,bone metastases in 3 and bone marrow involvement in 4 studies. These results show the importance of 131-I-MIBG scintigraphy in initial and differencial diagnosis,staging and evaluation of the response to therapy. 131I-MIBG is an established radiopharmaceutical for the localization and radiotherapy of neuroblastoma. However, the therapeutic effect is hardly ever leading to complete regression and some neuroblastoma lesions have lost the capacity of accumulating MISC. Hence, it is interesting to search for other substances which may be used in combination with or as an alternative to MIBG. Monoclonal antibody BW575/9 (Behringworke, Marburg, FRG) is a promising candidate. It was found be show impressive localization in neuroblastoma patients, especially in lesions that are localized in or near to bone marrow, while soft tissue processes tended to accumulate less effectively. To compare the accumulation and the time-concentration integral of MIBG and BW575/9 under standardized conditions in the same individual~ ~Je have established nude mouse xenograft models using tumor lines SK-N-SH and SK-N-MC, which showed high and low uptake of MIBG as well as high and lo~, binding of BN575/9, respectively. Autoradiographic analysis of tumor uptake in vivo revealed a fairly homogenous accumulation of both radiopharmaceuticals in SK-N-SH, while aeeumulabion in SK-N-MC was .hardly above background. Paired label experiments with SK-N-SH-bearing animals using 1311-MIBG and 1251-BW575/9 revealed three major differences: i) The absolute amount of MIBG uptake was low, peak values being one order of magnitude below those of the antibody (2.9% iD/g versus 23.7% iD/g). 2) Peak values were ovserved i h after injection of MIBG but 48 h after injection of BW575/9. This was paralleled by a rapid blood clearance of MIBG and a slow blood clearance of the antibody. 5) Release of accumulated radioactivity from tumor bissue was rapid with MIBG but slow with BW575/9. These results suggest radioimmunotherapy of neuroblastoma with an appropriate monoclonal antibody to be a promising approach. The sensitivity of radiolabeled metaiodobenzylguanidine (mIBG) scintigraphy in the detection of neuroblastoma is >90~. On occasions, false negative planar scans are due to organs of physiological uptake of mIBG e.g. heart, liver, bladder obscuring areas of disease. This study was undertaken to determine whether SPECT enhances the contribution of mIBG scinigraphy in neuroblastoma.",

Catecholamine uptake and the storage capacity of normal sympathoadrenal tissue in adrenal medulla, salivary glands, heart and spleen as well as in neuronal tumors such as pheochromocytoma and neuroblastoma can be imaged by iodine labeled metalodobenzylguanidine (MIBG). In this study, the hypothesis was tested whether the sympathoadrenergic tissue of the lung may be evaluated selectively by aerosol administration of the tracer into the lungs and subsequent dynamic lung scanning. This approach was applied in 13 studies in normal subjects, after drug interventions and in patients. The clearance half time from the lungs was measured after aerosol application of 5 -10 MBq 1-123 MIBG by continuous gamma camera imaging at 30 sec intervals for 20 min and exponential curve fitting of the lung time activity curves. 1-123 MIBG lung clearance evaluated in 7 normal individuals was 129+_.32 min thus showing a wide range of normal. In patients with possible effects of an underlying disease on the lung sympathoadrenergic system no significant difference in MIBG lung clearance was found. It was 112.2 min in bronchial asthma, 139.4 in hypothyroidism and 105.1 in a patient with hyperthyroidism. However, if repeated in 2 normal volunteers after oral inderal the clearance half life decreased from 192.9 to 139.9 rain and from 101.1 to 92.1 min; and after oral reserpine from 190.0 to 113.1 rain. In conclusion, the results of this study give evidence that ventilation scintigraphy with 1-123 MIBG allows the selective evaluation of the sympathoadrenergic system of the lungs without overlap of other organs. The clinical impact needs certainly further studies. The procedure might become useful in evaluating the effect of known or new oral, intravenous or inhalation drugs on the sympathoadrenergic control system of human airways. Iodobenzyl propanediamine (HIPDM) can be easily labeled with radio-iodine and has been proposed as a suitable tracer for studying pulmonary metabolic functions by noninvasive gamma imaging techniques. Pistolesi et aL demonstrated that HIPDM is retained by the human and rabbit lung in a slowly effluxable pool and that lung persistence of HIPDM is prolonged in asymptomatie smokers and in patients with various lung disorders as compared to normal nonsmokers. We used the rabbit as a valuable experimental model to investigate the mechanism(si by which HIPDM is taken up and retained by the lungs.",

Animals were sacrificed at various intervals from 2 rain up to 5 hrs after injection, and subcellular fractions and postmierosomal supernatant were obtained by differential centrifugation of lung homogenates. HIPDM content, protein concentration and dry weight were determined in each fraction. HIPDM time-activity curve derived from lung homogenates was similar to that observed in humans (mean time of lung clearance 7.6 vs 6.7 hrs). HIPDM was recovered only from the particulate fractions -the nuclear and mitochondrial fractions containing the bulk of the compound -and the highest HIPDM specific activity was found in the mitochondrial fraction. A negligible amount of inieoted dose was recovered from alveolar sudactant and macrophages. At any time, HIPDM radioactivity in each fraction (as % of total activity in lung) did not appreciably change, suggesting no redistribution of HIPDM among the fractions, In a rabbit model of lung injury (phorbol myristate acetate 40 p.g/Kg i.v.), the profile of HIPDM lung distribution was similar to that observed in normal rabbits. However, 2 rain after HIPDM injection, we found a significantly reduced amount of HIPDM (as % of injected dose) in lungs of treated animals as compared to normal rabbits (43% vs 89.5%). These findings suggest that the kinetics of HIPDM in the lung may reflect a dynamic interaction with subcellular membranous structures and that the longer persistence of HIPDM in the lungs of patients with lung injury cannot be accounted for by a different subcellular distribution of HIPDM.

The simultaneous detection and positive findings of vein thrombosis in lower extremities and positive findings of perfusion omission in lungs reliably confirm pulmonary embolism. 1960 phlebographies have been analysed, made in the last five years with Tc-99m-MAA, and compared to the perfusion lung scintigrams. The investigation is performed by means of gamma camera after injection of ca. 2 ml Tc-99m-MAA into the foot dorsum vein and with the surface veins squeezed with two Esmarchs so that the flow in deep veins is achieved. 50 images are obtained by computer in 200 seconds ( i img/4 sec). After the isotope phlebography has been performed, the perfusion lung scintigram. Out of 1960 cases of phlebography of lower extremities with simultaneously made perfusion lung scintigrams 1220 cases showed perfusion omission in lungs. 1160 (95.08%) cases out of these 1220 showed at the same time also a positive phlebography of lower extremities of whom 780 cases (63.93%) had blockade in deep veins of lower knee and 380 cases (31.15%) blockade in iliac veins. In only 60 cases (4.92%) the phlebography of lower extremities was negative, but with the existing lung perfusion omission. Due to large simultaneous correlation of positive phlebographies of deep veins in lower extremities and lung perfusion omission-data corresponding also to literature-it is reasonable also to make isotope phlebography of deep veins in lower extremities in all patients suspected of lung embolism.

This is achieved by setting on each pixel of the pulmonary area a thin prism with height proportional to the count rate in the same pixel of the perfusion image and modulating the colour of the prims by the local ventilation. Perspective views of these plots appear as three dimensional four parameter histograms (FPHs). To ease the analysis of the total pulmonary R0I the developed software allows display of views from the basis or from the vertices seen from right to left or the reverse. If an accurate activity/body weight is used in the perfusion studies and the heights of the prims are normalized to the average maximum value of normals and if the colour scale is conveniently chosen, comparison between different FPHs is possible, inasemiquantitative basis. A reference in each FPH indicates the average maximum normal value of perfusion. Data from a total of 150 patients including 13 normalshavebeen processed in order to have the FPHs. Comparison of FPHs with the corresponding V/Q ratio images by a gorup of 3 pneumologists, for 120 of the patients studied, indicates FPH as easier to interpret, with more information and more valuable as a complementary diagnostic tool. These results show that the FPHs may represent an improvement in the output of functional lung studies in Nuclear Medicine. Work supported by AIEA",

In 24 patients with recent myocardial infarction (NYHA class I) and EX induced ischaemia documented by MIBI scintigraphy, a perfusion study following MAS test was performed within 2 days. Three views, basal, EX and MAS planar scintigrams were reviewed and scored, each in 15 segments, on a 4 grade scale by 2 blind observers, with the aid of circumferential profile analysis. EX test induced ECG abnormalities (ST > lmm) in 15/24 patients, and chest pain in 5; MAS induced neither ECG changes nor pain. Reversible perfusion defects were demonstrated by MAS in 20/24 patients. EX induced transient MIBI uptake defects in 99/360 segments. 48 of these developed a corresponding reversible abnormality during MA$. Of the remaining 51 segments 20 were contiguous to hypoperfused segments correctly detected, suggesting a lesser extent. On the contrary 10 segments showed a reversible defect only at MAS: 7 contiguous to an area of reversible hypoperfusion at EX, and 2 located in an area of fixed MIBI defect at EX. One of the segments with a reversible defect at MAS had a completely normal uptake pattern at EX. In 12 patients, injected with calibrated activities, an absolute stress/rest uptake ratio was calculated: all of these patients had a decreased uptake ratio below a defined range of normality in segments with reversible MIBI defects; moreover in 8/12 subjects a decrease of MIBI uptake below the rest values was observed. In conclusion MAS can reproduce EX perfusion abnormalities in a high percentage of patients (83%), but to a lesser extent. Irrespective of a possible pathogenetic mechanism, a decrease in absolute uptake of 99m-Tc-MIBI is observed after MAS in the majority of myocardial sites with reversible defects at visual inspection.",

Each TEBO scan was completed in < 5 min, compared with 25-30 rain for T1 imaging. Overall, diagnostic agreement was present (normal vs abnormal) in 34 of these 39 pts (87%; p<0.01), and ischemia and infarction were concordant with TEBO and TI scanning in 77% (p < 0.01) and 67% (p<0.05), respectively. No obvious difference in diagnostic accuracy was present between the separate and simultaneous TEBO/T1 injection protocols. Comparing results of both protocols, TEBO imaging demonstrated 68 segments with ischemia, which was more than present on serial T1 scans (segments=56). Additionally, concordance for VT between the studies was present in 82%, 85% and 82% for the LAD, RCA and LCX respectively (p<0.01 for each VT).

Immediately after, those patients were given 550 MBq Tc-99m-DPD; 90 minutes later myocardial scintigram was taken by computer and with the help of gamma camera in three projections. When the scintigram was negative, the procedure was repeated after 24 hours. In 7 patients where fibrinolytic therapy was contraindicant, myocardial scintigram was made during the first ten hours and then repeated after 24-36 hours. In 9 patients, out of ll, who were treated with streptokinase the reperfusion was successful. The interval between the outset of pain to the positive scintigram was 448~189 min. In the two patients with unsuccessful reperfusion the time interval between the outset of pain to the positive scintigram was more than 24 hours. In the control group of 7 patients, who had no fibrinolytic therapy, however repeated scintigraphy after 24-36 turned out positive in all seven patient. In conclusion we can say that early myocardial scintigraphy with Tc-99m-DPD represents one of the noninvasive methods by which we can prove early myocardial reperfusion; we can show the moment of reperfusion, the locat~n and the size of the necrotic heart muscle and thus guide further treatment.",

They underwent a 5 views (0,45, 90 ~ planar scintigraphy 48 H later. I patient had a global cardiac failure as assessed by echography. Results were compared to those of angiography. None of the patients underwent adverse reactions. Independently of angiographic lesions, the patient with cardiac failure showed a severe diffuse uptake. 5,t of the remaining 45 other patients had one or severa] thrombosis of their bypass. In 50 of them (88~), the scan was concordant with angiography. In 3 cases (g~), it involved larger territories ordid not correspond to angiographic lesions. In | case (3~), despite an abnormal angiegraphy, the scintigraphy was negative. 1 I patients had a normal angiography. In 7 of them (64~), the scan was also normal. In the 4 last patients (3B~) however, an abnorma] diffuse uptake was observed. If one excludes the patieDt with cardiac failure, the general agreement between scinti~graphy and angiography was 84~ (30 true + and 7 true -). In 16% (5 cases: overestimation on other territories than expected involved and ,t cases: diffuse uptake), the scan was falsely +. There was 2~ ( 1 case) of false -scans. To conclude: It appears obvious that the antimyosin MoAb are fixed by ischemic myocardial wall with possible interpretation problems in case of differentia] diagnosis with infarction. Moreover, it must be noted that the Ab is sometimes fixed by a larger than expected territory, possibly because of a more important injury than predicted by angiographic method. As expected, a severe diffuse uptake is found in global cardiac failure but intriguing is the diffuse uptake in patients without evidence of such a problem. Recently S12 monoclonal antibody (MAb) has been developed by McEver et al that is targeted against an alpha granule membrane glycoprotein (GMP-140) that becomes exposed during the process of platelet activation. In g rabbits, we studied the feasibility of in vivo imaging of activated platelets contained within occlusive arterial thrombi by Tc-99m (Te) labeled S12. Totally occlusive femoral arterial thrombi were induced by transcarotid insertion of copper coils into the femoral artery. One mCi of Tc-SI2 was infused 2 cm proximal to the thrombus followed by flushing. Sequential 2 min scintigrams and blood samples were obtained for 2 hours followed by sacrifice. The mean post sacrifice thrombus weight was 14.8 mg (range: 2.5-26mg). All thrombi were visualized scintigraphically immediately after Tc-SI2 injection with a mean in vivo thrombus to background count ratio of 2.5 (range: 1.6 to ii). The mean post sacrfice ex vivo thrombus to blood specific radioactivity ratio was 73 (range: 24.4-143.5). Tc-SI2 blood clearance rate was biexponential with T 1/2 of 40 and 99 min. In 2 experiments, i mCi In-Ill labeled isotype non specific MAb (control) was injected prior to Tc-SI2 which failed to visualize thrombi.",

The results suggest that the process of platelet activation can be imaged in vivo. Accurate and reproducible determination of changes in bone mineral density (BMD) measurements can be of help in prevention and treatment of osteoporose. To improve the detection of these changes inter and intra observer variations should be avoided whenever possible. We propose an algorithm that performs an automatic comparison of two sequential studies F and G, which ensures a fixed size and shape of the ROI (L2-L4). The measurements were performed on a Novo BMC-LAB 22a. In order to find the best matching translation and rotation, the deterministic sign change criterion was applied [Venot et al., 1986] . The ROI of image F was superimposed on the transformed linage G. Then, the background levels were corrected by a determination over their common soft tissue area, subtracted, and the change in BMD was computed. In duplicate studies of 15 normals and 9 patients we obtained a coefficient of variation (CV) of the BMD measurements of 1.04% respectively 2.00%. The procedure worked satisfactorily in all studies and showed an improved CV compared to other studies on the same instrument (CV of 2-3% in normal subjects and of 3-5% in patients). The proposed method is as well applicable to dual energy X-ray absorptiometry images.",

Therefore, we studied the influence of recently administered radionuclides on bone mineral density (BMD) measurements. Lumbar spine BMD was measured in 13 patients before and 1 to 3 hours after the administration of a radiopharmaceutical: TC-99m-MDP, Tc-99m labelled erythrocytes and TI-201 chloride. A Hologic QDR bone densitometer was used. Results are expressed as the ratio of the BMD value after to that before administration of radionuclides. The range of the ratios is tabulated. Reproducibility was estimated in normals, who did not receive radionuclides, by successive measurements of both LI-L2 and L3-L4 regions. The BMD ratio of the second BMD value to the first one ranged from 0.97 to 1.02. The outcome of BMD measurements after administration of radionuclides seems to be related to the administered dose and the distribution around the measured region. we conclude that, shortly after administration of radionuclides, serious errors in QDR measurements can occur. Probably, no correction is possible, since these errors are not consistent. ",

DPA with a gamma camera (GCA) is a potential alternative for centres that are unable to invest in such specialized equipment. A gamma camera (Toshiba GCA 40a) was equipped for DPA measurements. It was fitted with a diverging collimator and a C-arm with a Gd-153 source in the focal point (Nuclear Fields Inc.). Four vials, containing 0, 0.5, 0.8 and 1.4 g/cm 2 of hydroxyapatite, were measured with the GCA and also with a rectilinear DPA scanner (NOVO BMC Lab 22a) and an X-ray bone densitometer (DEXA, Hologic QDR 1000). All three systems showed a linear response: GCA DPA: BMD = -0.0005 + 1.03 x trueBMD (R 2 = 0.999) rectilin. DPA: BMD = 0.0015 + 0.83 x trueBMD (R 2 = 1.000) DEXA: BMD = 0.02 + 0.90 x trueBMD (R 2 = 0.999) Repeat measurements with the GCA of a spine phantom yielded a precision of 1.6% to 2.8%, depending on the method of ROI selection. The projected area of the phantom was dependent on the position between source and detector, and it changed by 3.5% per cm. This effect precludes exact comparison of ROl's in follow-up scans. Measurements in healthy humans with rectilinear DPA and DPA with GCA correlated well, but identification of the intervertebral spaces was difficult with GCA. However, when taking the images with the photon beam directed from posterior to anterior, the separation of the vertebrae was easy. We conclude that BMD measurements can be made with GCA, comparable to other systems, to decide whether a patient needs treatment. For follow-up, the precision of GCA is inadequate compared to DEXA. 222 J. A. Negrin, R. P. Spencer. Department of Nuclear Medicine, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT, USA.",

Med, 19gg, g~ : lgg). In diabetes sympathetic nervous function is often decreased. In order to study spatial and temporal distribution of sympathetic inne~ation in heart of diabetic patients, we measured J23I-MIBG cardiac uptake in diabetic male patients with (ANP+; 6 cases) and without (ANP-; 6 cases) signs of autonomic neuropathy and in 6 age-matched healthy controls. Two SPECT-studies (I and 6 hours after injection of tracer) were carried out by detecting 32 frames (each 45 sec) from LPO to RAO. Transaxial slices were visually surveyed and myocardial ]231-accumulation was scored onto 4 groups: normal (3 points), slightly decreased (2), markedly decreased (I) and no uptake (0). There was no significant difference in J hour SPECTimages between patients and controls whereas 6 hour images revealed highly reduced 123I cardiac uptake in patients; image score being 0.7 +/-0.5 in ANP+, 1.7 +/-0.4 in ANP-and 2.6 +/-0.2 in controls, respectively. Correspondingly myocardium-to-liver ratio was lower in patients 0.32 +/-0.04, 0.49 +/-0.06 than in controls 0.69 +/-0.07, although liver uptake was same in all 3 groups. The results show that cardiac MIBG-uptake is decreased in diabetic patients both with and without signs of autonomic neuropathysuggesting a disorder in the cardiac sympathetic nervous function in diabetes. A desensitization of the myocardial 8 adrenergic pathway is observed after exposure to chronic hypoxia. This suggests an increased concentration of norepinephrine in the interstitial myocardial tissue. This local increase of norepinephrine could be due to a decrease in its neuronal uptake, which is the main way of inactivation.",

Using only the two significant cardiac parameters, a new discriminant analysis permitted to class 1OO% of group I pts and 68% of group II pts. Though a longer time from surgery was an important predictor of the inducibility of SVT, the presence of RV systolic barometric and/or volumetric overload were always necessary to induce SVT. RNA is useful to appreciate this RV volumetric overload. An inverse relationship between left ventricular systolic pressure-volume variables and heart size has been documented in dogs, rising concern about the possible use of these indexes in the clinical evaluation of cardiac inotropic state.

The analytical performances of several commercial RIA kits for the assay of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which use different anfisera and tracers, have been evaluated in order to verify the levels of accuracy and practicability employing a special set of lyophilized reference materials. All the commrcial RIA kits evaluated in this study (supplied by Peninsula Laboratories INC, Belmont, CA, USA; INCSTAR Corporation, StiUwater, MI, USA; Amesherm International plc, Buckinghamshire, UK) showed a degree of sensitivity and precision which does not reach an acceptable precision (CV <15%) for the measurement of plasma ANP concentrations in normal subjects. An improvement of precision and sensitivity was obtained by using \"fresh\" (or purified) preparation of the tracer and standard solutions, and by adding PEG to B/F separation step. The direct assay (without preliminary purification) was not possible for the great overestimation of plasma levels due to the presence of interferences. Four different procedures for purification of plasma samples, which use the extraction of plasma samples with Sep-Pack C18 cartridges, were evaluated. In addition, an alternative purification of plasma samples which usees immunoextraction (C-terminal ANP-specific antibody bound to solid phase particles of Sepharose), was also evaluated. The extraction step increased the imprecision and the complexity of the assay. Moreover, the quantitative recovery of ANP added to plasma samples after the extraction procedure with Sep-Pak cartridges, with all the procedures tested, was poor (about 50-60%); while the recovery of immunoextraction was higher. Moreover, the comparison between the results obtained with the RIA systems indicated that the antisera employed have comparable sensitivity, but quite different specificity.",

During 1989 we promoted an external quality contPol (QC) collaborative study for the immunoaseays of the tumor markers CA I 9-9, CA125, CA I 5-3 in which participated about 100 laboratories ( 75 italian labs and 25 labs from other european countries) ; untill now 20 QC samples have been sent in two dispatches. Control materials were prepared adding the tumoral antigens (kindly supplied by dr.M.Boddin, Centooor Europe,Tongeren Belgium) to pooled normal sara , one QC sample (sent in both occasions) wee a pool from sara of patients affected by malignancies and another sample was prepared with Bioref control material (Bioref GmbH, Mombris, RFO supplied by Polymed, Florence, Italy). The QO samples were stored freezed and delivered at room temperature by mail. The kits more used by participants were : Abbott (5% of all results), Centooor (22%), CI$ (50%), Byk-$anotec (5%) and 6orin(12%). The batwecn-lab agreement (mean 61/observed in the results of all QC samples) was : CA 19-9 , concontration range 30-95 Ulml , CV= 17.6% ; CA 125 , concentration range 244-180 Ulml, OV= 18.3% ; CA 15-3, concentration range 32-120 Ulml , CY= 19. 1%. These preliminary data indicate that the between-lab agreement of the tumor markers included in the survey, is better or comparable with that observed for CEA assay (0V=23.6%) in the 1989 national interlaboratory survey for immunoassey organized by CNR. The satisfactory agreement found for the assays of CA 19-9, CA 125, CA 15-3 is probably explained by the fact that the kits used are relatively few and employ common reagents (antibodies and standards from Centocor). As far as the kit precision is concerned we observed that the within-kit variabilities ranged from 9 to I ,I CV% for CA 19-9, from 11 to 18 CV% for CAt 25 and from 17 to 18 CY% for CA 15-3.

Absolute bone metabolic rates can be assessed to classify bone disorders. The utility of this method to evaluate osteoporosis and therapeutic responses is in progress. Various proteins were modified by attachment of l-imino-4-mercaptobutyl by reaction with 2-iminothiolane hydrochloride. 2-iminothiolane reacts with exposed primary amino groups of lysine and arginine residues of the protein with subsequent opening of the 2-iminothiolane ring. l-lmino-4-mercaptobntyl proved to be a suitable interchelator for binding of reduced 99m-Tc. The labelling with 99m-Tc proceeds rapidly with a yield up to 99%, so that there is no need for a final purification of the labelled product. Further, 99m-Tc attached to iff~unoglobulin was sufficiently stable to allow successful localization of infectious processes in animal and man, in~nunoglobulin being formulated in a dry kit: Technescan HIG. If stored at 4~ this lyophilized kit was stable for more than a year.

Patients and methods: fourty six paired irm~unoscintigraphic examinations were performed on 43 patients with suspected ovarian carcinoma recurrence, using F(ab')2 fragments of OC125 antibody labeled first with In iii and then with I 131. All images (planar (SP) and tomoseintigraphy (ECT)) were interpreted blindly and separately by three observers. Reproducibility was considered as moderate when kappa value was >0.5 and substantial when kappa value was > 0.6. Results show superior values of kappa when In iii was used, despite significant difference was not found : we obtained for interobaerver reproductibility Ii kappa values < 0.5 and 8 > 0.6 with In iii, but 20 < 0.5 and 4 >0.6 with I 131. For intraobserver reproduetibility, we found 1 value < 0.5 and 13 > 0. 60 with In iii, whereas 5 were < 0.5 and 9 > 0.60 with I 131. According to the recording mode, superiority of reproductibility achieved by In lll-~labeled antibodies was more evident for ECT.

Therefore we evaluated its relevance for thyroid imaging (T1, spin-echo (SE) mode), in particular for differentiation of cervical or thyroid nodules compared with conventional MRI techniques (T2/ proton weighted, SE-mode). 52 pts. were investigated in a 1.5T supraconducting unit (SIEMENS MAGNETOM) using a Helmholtz surface coil: 15 with benign, 6 with malignant disorders, and 31 following thyroidectomy and ablative 1-131 therapy (10d-2yr ago) because of differentiated thyroid cancer. MR-findings were validated by scintigraphy, ultrasonography, fine needle biopsies or surgery. 96% of the lesions or diseases (adenoma, malignoma, cyst, thyroiditis, Graves disease} were charcterized by increased signal intensities in T2, but normal ones in Tl-lmages (except hematoma). Enhancement by Gd-DTPA allowed to distinguish solid and cystic areas and corresponded with disease activity in thyroiditis and Graves disease. Remaining thyroid tissue after thyroidectomy could easily be recognized by typical enhancement of Gd-DTPA. In contrast, scar tissue remained unchanged. Typical features of tumor tissue (local recurrency, lymphnode metastasis} were high signal intensity in all sequences and intense enhancement by Gd-DTPA. Thus, GD-DTPA allowed to differentiate malignant from scar tissue. Accurate classification of intrathyrold lesions, however, could not be achieved. ",

The aim of this work was to evaluate a new Tg IRMA kit from Cis which associates to the Tg determination, an individual recovery test to exclude or to confirm an interference. Tg was determined in 51 healthy subjects and 53 treated differentiated thyroid carcinoma. The sensitivity of the assay was 0.58 ng/ml. The intraassay reproductibility was <gZ for concentration ranging from 1.25 to 470 ng/ml and 12Z for standard O. The inter assay reproductibility was 9Z. The dilution curves of sera paralleled the standard one. In the control sara, the Tg level range was 1.5 to 31.5 ng/ml (10.92 +-6.27). In sara from 40 patients in complete remission, Ig was <0.5 ng/ml. In 15 patients with metastases, Ig was > 260 ng/ml. The use of menoclonal antibodies allows a better sensitivity for the low values. The diagnostic efficiency of the recovery test was measured in 105 patients. Ig autoantibodies were determined in all sers using the RIA kit from Behring. They were positive in 54 and negative in 71 patients. The interference was confirmed when the recovery was ~75% There was not interference when recovery was>73Z.

Recent imaging and neuropathological studies have reported minor structural abnormalities in the brains of schizophrenic patients. On clinical grounds, frontal lobe deficits have long been suspected. To test this, 25 young right handed male schizophrenic patients (DSM 3 diagnosis) and 25 matched volunteers underwent 99m-Tc HMPAO SPECT after ethical approval.The tracer was administered intravenously whilst the subject was engaged in a task known to demand frontal, particularly left frontal activity: the Chicago word fluency task. Tomograghy was then performed on a dedicated system, SME 810, acquiring multiple overlapping 15 ram thick slices parallel to orbitomeatal line. A relative measure of blood flow to eight cortical and two subcortieal regions was derived by comparing the Mean Information Density (MID) in each region to the eerebellar MID. The left anterior ratios were significantly higher (P<O.05) in controls compared to the patients. Results showed a predicted failure of frontal activation in patients compared to controls, with loss of cortico-subcortical correlation of activity.High negative correlations between test perfomance and right cauda<te reEF ( an inhibitory system) seen in controls were not seen in patients.The results suggest \" Functional Hypofrotality\" in schizophrenia. In infants who have suffered perinatal trauma, conventional investigations are not always indicative of site of cerebral injury. In this work, 10 neonates with severe impairment of limb, neck or trunk tone were investigated using Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) anomalies were demonstrated in all the i0 patients and ranged from unilateral focal hypoperfusion to extensive bilateral hypoactivity involving cortical, thalamic or cerebellar ar~as. In 2 patients with unilateral anomalies shown by cranial ultrasound scan, SPECT findings were congruent or more extensive. In I patient, bilateral thalamic injury was demonstrated both by cranial ultrasound scan and by brain SPECT. In 3 patients with cerebral oedema at the ultrasound suggesting severe cerebral injury, SPECT allowed to localize the site of lesion, in sensorimotor cortex and/or in thalamic area. Finally, unilateral or bilateral SPECT hypoperfusion were demonstated in 4 other patients, while ultrasound scan was normal. These results suggest that rCBF study using SPECT and Tc-99m HMPAO could have a contributing role in the determination of site of cerebral injury in neurologically impaired neonates. Tatsch I989) .

Before treatment and after three months several immunological parameters and a brain spect with 666 MBq Tc-99m-HMPAO were performed. Transversal slices were generated and a semiquantitative analysis including cortical and cerebellar regions was accomplished. Corresponding slices of both accquisitions were compared. Before treatment we found focal lesions in 7/9 pts, after three months 3 of them showed an increased perfusion of these lesions, in 2 pts there was a further deterioration and in 2 pts no change. The remaining 2/9 pts showed no focal uptake lesions before and during IFN treatment. Among the 2 pts with perfusion deterioration one developed neurological symptoms and in the other one immunological parameters worsened. In the 3 pts with increased perfusion these parameters were improved or unchanged as well as in the remaining patients. Conclusion: HMPAO-spect is a valuable tool for monitoring the treatment of HIV encephalopathy.

In conclusion: IS with granulocytes Abs seems to be a valuable imaging method to determine the correct moment of surgical intervention. patients had Crohn,s disease and 13 suffered from ulcerative colitis. Autologous leukocytes were labelled with 99mTc-d,l-HNPAO. The mean labelling efficiency was 48.26 + 11.57 %. The viability of the cells was checked by trTpan blue incorporation, and was found to be ?4.6 + 2.4 %. 50 minutes, 2.5 hours after the rein3ection of The labelled cells images were taken from the abdomen. The bowel was divided into ll segments, and the activity was scored by comparing it with the uptake of the liver and bone marrow. To charactecise the \"inflamed bowel activity\" the scores were summarised. Activity determined by leukocyte scan weakly correlated with the laboratory findings (with the leukocyte number r=0.526, with the alpha-2 globuline r=0.498 and with the fibrinogene c=0.519), but no correlation was found between the Best index. The segment localisatien (small bowel, ascending, transverse, descending colon, sigmeid and rectum) of the uptake was compared with the celonoscopic or irrigoscopic findings in 22 cases. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy was 71.4 %, 80.8 % and 74.7 %. The most false negative results were found in the ative rectal processes. In conclusion, we suggest that the 99mTc-HMPAO-leukocyte scintigraphy is a suitable method for the localisation of the inflammatory bowel disease and the follow-up of the patients. in 18 studies.ECT was performed on day 2 only in the ca se of In.Twelve pts underwent second look surgery,in the others RID was confirmed by CT,US,endoscopy,barium enema or 6 mo follow-up. In 9 pts RID was the only non invasive technique able to detect local recurrences.The differences between the two groups may be explained by the higher prevalence and a more advanced disease in the iodine group,while the non specific uptake of In is probably responsible for FP results. However the In label,offering higher qua lity scans and the possibility of ECT,seems preferable. These results are more optimistic than considering dis rant metastases ~ too and,as CT and US are of limited value in the detection of pelvic recurrences,it seems worthwhile including RID in the follow-up of these pts. Repeated immunscintigraphy(IS)with 99m-TC-labelled monoclonal Anti-CEA antibodies(BW431/26) were performed in 9 patients(4m, Sw,42-77a;x=59~ with colorectal carcinoma for evaluation of recurrencies and metastasis and for control of chemo-or radiotherapy respectivly. IS was again repeated once in 6 patients,twice in two patients and three times in one patient.Time interval between studies ranged from 27-354 days (x=168 days).In a total of 24 immunscintigraphic studies 19 true positive,2 true negative and 2 false positive results could be observed. Imaging quality was excellent in nearly all studies.One study could not be evaluated because of intensive activity uptake in the liver and bone marrow,one further study showed a marked decrease of uptake in tumour recurrence in the 2nd study which was performed 27 days after the first study on request of the patient. HAMA'S were measured in all patients and were normal in all but one(w;57a) . In this patient IgG was 25,2 rel.U/ml and IgE 179 mU/ml 98 days after second application of the antibody and the patient showed minor side-effects 20' after the third antibody application. In our experience repeated IS with Anti-CEA antibodies(BW431/26)proved to be an important technique in management and therapy control of patients with colorectal carcinoma. Gastrin, a gastrointestinal hormone, is known to have cytoproliferative effects on tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. Since the biological effects of the hormone are mediated by binding to specific receptors, it was the aim of the present study to evaluate the gastrin receptor density in vivo by uptake studies of 1-125-gastrin into human tumor xenografts in nude mice and to correlate the obtained values with the in vitro determined receptor concentration. With a seven point Scatchard analysis a binding capacity of 14-88 fmol/mg and a Kd of 10 nmol/l was obtained in gastric tissue and in some gastric and colon carcinoma investigated. After injection of 2.5 u of 1-125-gastrin into nude mice bearing tumors that had shown an expression of the receptor by the in vitro studies, an activity concentration of 3.1%/g tumor tissue was obtained at 1 h p.i..The rapid blood clearance of gastrin resulted in tumor-to-blood ratios of 2.5 aleady within 3-6 h p.i.. No uptake of 1-131gastrin, however, was determined in receptor negative tumors. The results demonstrate the fast in vivo binding of gastrin to receptor positive human tumors and offers therefore the opportunity of visualization of the receptor status in vivo with short-lifed radionuclides. Blocking of the receptor and thus inhibition of the stimulating effects of gastrin may also be evaluated by scintigraphic imaging. Tc-99m-s galactosylated albumin (NGA) (Galactoscint | is a synthetic radiopharmaceutical specific for the hepatic binding protein receptor. After approval by our institutional ethical committee, the pharmacokineties of Tc-99m-NGA were evaluated in 5 healthy volunteers, 15 patients (pts) with liver cirrhosis (classified according to the Child-Turcotte score (CTs)) and 7 pts with a variety of non-cirrhotic liver disease. All subjects received a dose of 10 rag, 5 mCi,Tc-99m-NGA. By means of a LFOV gamma camera, anterior images were made in 1 min frames in order to generate time/activity curves for liver and precordium. A blood sample was taken 20 min after injection. Two parameters were systematically derived from the normalised blood disappearance curve, which, between 2 and 15 rain, could adequately be approached by a mono-exponential function: the fractional disappearance rate (k i in min d ), with a normal range of .089 \u2022 .006, and the initial distribution volume (VD i ), with a normal value of 8.3 + .5 1.",

PET showed that metabolic tracers seem to be the most suitable in identifying viable myocardium,when compared to perfusion tracers. Recently a new gamma-emitter metabolic tracer, II23-IPPA, has been available for SPECT studies, presenting potential larger clinical applications. Therefore we studied 12 pts with recent myocardial infarction (beyond the 3rd week) by SPECT, performing firstly a metabolic study (MS) at rest with II2S-IPPA (early and delayed imazing) followed by a rest/stress perfusion study (PB) with tc99m-MIBI. We compared the segmental extent (BE) and the grading of the uptake (UG), between the 2 rest studies. We also evaluated the presence of residual ischemia (RI) in the area of infarction (by r/s PS) and the segmental kinesis by ECO.The ES and UG were the same in 6 pts (50%) while the other 6 pts showed at MS (delayed imaging) less large defects than at PS. The presence of RI was just the same in these 2 groups (83% vs 83%). CONCLUSIONS:our data suggest that MS by SPECT can give interesting information on viability as regards PS,especially the delayed imaging of II23-IPPA. However fur ther studies on larger populations are necessary to confirm the better effectiveness of II23-IPPA in identifying viable myocardium. Early detection of small and bilateral, arduously detectable varicocele (BV) is important because if remain unrecognized improvement of spermatogenesis after surgical correction could fail. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of BV in infertile males and to ascertain diagnostic performances of two-phase scrotal blood pool scintigraphy (SBPS). SBPS using erythrocytes in vivo labeled with 175 MBq of 99mTc was performed in 251 infertile males.

Objective of the study was to compare Ga-67 citrate, In-lll leukocytes, Tc-99m HM-PAO and In-lll antimyosin (which has been shown to localize in skeletal muscle injury) in experimentaly induced inflarmnatory lesions. Inflan~natory regions were induced by intramuscular injection of 0.5 ml turpentine oil in left hind leg, the right leg was used as control. An abscess was allowed to develop for 7 days. Each radiopharmaceutical was injected intravenously into five rabbits. Using a gamma camera interfaced with a minicomputer and the rabbit lying in supine position, static images of 5 min. were obtained at 2, 6, 12, 24 hrs postinjection. Region of interest were assigned over the inflarmnation sites in the left leg and identical one on the right leg. The ratio of the amount of radioactivity of the left leg to that of the right leg was obtained. At all imaging times, the uptake at the inflammatory site was well visualized at 2, 6, 12, 24 hrs post injection. However, the ratio of the uptake to background radioactivity of In-ill antimyosin and Ga-67 citrate were statistically the same but higher than those of In-Ill leukocytes and Tc-99mHM-PAO leukocytes which were statistically equal.

Despite the use of 1311 for antibody labeling there was high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of primary and recurrent colorectal adenocarcinoma (including liver metastasis). The most conspicuous indication of IS is in the followup of patients previously operated on for colorectal carcinoma who have a suspected but inconfirmed recurrence. IS may also indicated in the management of primary colorectal cancer not diagnosed by conventional methods. The determination of the absolute uptake of radiolabeled monoclonal anttbodies (Mab) in metastases is essential for dosimetry. The aim of the study was to validate a special iterative SPECT reconstruction program for quantification based on the principle of maximum likelihood. The SPECT-images were acquired using a 360~tating gamma camera (I/2 inch crystal; medium energy collimator; 64x64 matrix). The measurements were performed in an anthropomorph phantom of the abdomen including spheric tumorphantoms (~ 3 cm) and in patients with solitary liver metastases (~ 3-4 cm). The contour of the tumor in the SPECT slices was determined by analysis of the countrate profile. A background region surrounded the tumor in a defined distance. The countrate in the tumorregion increased with increasing background radioactivity because of scatter. Based on these results a diagram was established showing the calibration factors for different tumor-to-background ratios. In 3 patients with solitary liver metastaseS 120 MBq of 131-I labeled Mab to CEA/CA 19-9 were injected. SPECT acquisition of the abdomen was performed before surgery. Immediately after surgery, the radioactivity in the metastases was measured in a well counter. 3 kBq +20% In conclusion, the described procedure is a reliable method to determine the uptake of 131-I labeled Mab even at low tumor-to-background ratios.and can provide information on tumor biokinetics of Mab in man.",

The hybridoma technology has produced monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against antigens associated with a wide range of tumors, including epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). A characteristic of antigens expressed by EOC is that they are often shared with other epithelial neoplasias, such as breast and gastrointestinal cancer. CA549 is a high molecular weight glycoprotein recognized by an immunoradiometric assay involving two monoclonal antibodies: BC4E549, developed against a breasttumor cell-line and BC4N154, developed against a milk-fat globule membrane. In order to test the reliability of CA549 assay in the diagnostic approach of EOC, we measured the levels of CA549 (reference value [RV]: 10 U/mL), CA125 (RV: 65 U/mL), CA19.9 (RV: 40 U/mL) and CA15.3 (RV: 32 U/mL) in blood samples collected preoperatively at diagnosis from 42 patients (pts) with EOC and 84 pts with benign ovarian pathology undergoing laparotomy. CA549 had a sensitivity (SE) (76.2%) near to that of CA125 (83.3%) and greater than the SE of CA19.9 (31.0%) or CA15.3 (61.9%). In particular, CA549 showed the same SE of CA125 for serous (78.6%) and undifferentiated (100.0%) histotypes, while it was less frequently expressed by mucinous tumours (20.0%). The incidence of elevated serum CA125 and CA15.3 levels was significantly greater (p=0.00004 and p=0.025, respectively) in advanced stages than in early ones, while CA549 and CA19.9 assays positivities did not correlate with the extent of neoplasia. However, it is worth noting that CA549 assay seemed to be more suitable than CA125 assay with 65U/mL for the detection of early tumors. CA549 was less specific than CA125 with 65U/mL as RV and CA15.3; in particular CA549 assay had a high percentage of false positive values among pts with serous cystoadenoma (18.6%) and endometriotic cyst (21.1%). Since these preliminary data showed that CA549 had a good SE for non mucinous EOC, we are now evaluating reliability of the serum measurement of this antigen in monitoring the disease course. and TPA were high in 50% of GC, Ca 19-9 in 25%. The ccmbined use of the markers increased sensitivity in grcup B both in RC (80%) end GC (7[~/o). All the pts were followed with serial meastmements of the markers for 8 -15 menths. Two RC and 1 GC of group A, who originally bed high Ca 195 levels, exibitod a further rise which preceded the appearance of metastases by 4 -6 mcnths. Ca 195 also rose in 5 pts (3 RC, 2 GC) with initial normal values end metastases bensme %cparent 5 -6 months later, while in one case of disease rel~cse,Ene marker remained within normal limits.

In the ii pts with disease regression Ca 195 sigdificantly fell, if already high, or refm3ined no~. TPA, CEA and Ca 19-9 eilher fell slightly er were enchanged. Our data dem(z~strate that Ca 195 is useful in advanced GIC to confirm the presence of metastases; its sensitivity is higher than TPA, CEA and Ca 19-9. Moreover, serial measurements of the marker can detect early recurrences in ~oparent inactive disease and can evaluate tumor resDcnse to treatment. In cerebral palsied children, motor disabilities often hamper the evsluation of intellectual and somesthetic functions. In this work, we have investigated by means of Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT 13 children aged 13 months to 12 years suffering from spastic cerebral palsy. In 4 hemiplegie children with large sylvian porencephalic cysts, SPECT hypoperfusion was congruent with CTscan findings in 3 patients and demonstrated additionally a bilateral hypoactivity in the prefrontal areas in 1 patient with severe mental retardation . In 1 hemiplegie child with cerebral atrophy limited to the contralateral parietal cortex, the SPECT study showed a more extensive abnormality, including the superior motor area. In 1 hemiplegic child with normal CTscan, there was no demonstrable reduction of cerebral blood flow in the motor cortex but a left parietal hypoperfusion suggesting the existence of somesthetic disabilities. In di-and tetraplegic children, in which the CTscan of the head was normal or showed cerebral atrophy, SPECT study was normal in patients with mild diplegia, showed bilateral superior motor cortical hypoperfusion in children with moderate di-or tetraplegia and bilateral reduction of perfusion in the superior motor, inferior motor, prefrontal and parietal cortex in children with severe di-or tetraplegia. These results suggest that Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT could be valuable for a thorough neurological assessement in spastic cerebral palsy. We have started to treat children with neuroblastoma stage IV with Interleukin-2 (4 children) and a monoclonal ganglioside-antibody (Gd-2, 3 children) directed against epitopes on neuroblastoma-cells, when there is poor response to the usual therapeutic scheme with chemotherapy,surgery,irradiation,and bonemarrow-transplantation. While the disappearance of a single femoral metastasis in one child after IL-2 therapy could be due to the delayed effect of a 131-1-MIBG-therapy, a rapid tumor regression in another child already after the first course continued for four courses until the formation of lymphnodes in the pelvis indicated tumor progression. A girl with multiple bone-metastases and a diffuse bone-marrow infiltration showed a good response to one course of Gd-2, (four doses within one week) confirmed by the 123-I-MIBG immunoscan and the decrease of pain. The monoclonal antibody Gd-2 complements MIBG in the detection of neuroblastomas and allows to determine the binding-rate of the antibody given for therapy. IL-2 and Gd-2 have shown the capability of tumor regression in poor responders to the usual therapy and are integrated in our therapeutic scheme of children with neuroblastoma stage IV. A method to study the pulmonary arterial circulation based on the computer processing of the periodic variations of the lung activity, during the cardiac cycle, at pixel level, in patients with labelled blood pool and ECG gated acquisition is presented. This method is an application of work published on the visualization of the pulsatile lung blood circulation (de lima et al., 1986) . In vivo tagging of RBC with 740 MBq of 99mTc and posterior view acquisition was used. Fourier analysis was applied and first harmonic amplitude and phase images obtained. A normal histogram (number of pixels/phase angle) shows a large peak for the pulmonary circulation followed by a small peak, at a larger phase angle, which respects the bronchial circulation. An increase in the latter means increase in the pulmonary arterial flow which may be a shunt. The ratio of the sums of the amplitudes of the pixels in this peak and of the amplitudes of all the pixels in the histogram is, approximately, the ratio between the pulmonary arterial flow and the total blood flow in the lungs. In a study of 24 normals the estimated bronchial flow was 1.9\u2022 In a group of 9POCDpatients the value was 7.4-+3.0% which significantly differs from normal (P<0.0001). This method may have a role as a noninvasive easy technique for the study of pulmonary circulation. Uptake of radioactivity into some types of tumors and the skeleton have been registered after application of various radiolanthenide complexes by animal studies. Results of first clinical trial with the complex 1S9 Ybnitrilo-tri-acetate (NTA) in 21 pts. suffering from primary or secondary malignant pulmonery tumors can reported now. These neoplasms have been diagnosed reliabely by means of XCT end biopsy eg. and assumed histologically after surgery. The iv injection of 185 MRq 189 Yb NTA has been followed by the registraLion of time course of radioactivity. The regions of head, chest end abdomen were imaged 2, 5, 24 and 48 hrs. pi. Furthermore, the concentration of radioactivity in tumors and in the surrounding tissue could estimated postsurgically. High tumor/lung tissue ratios rangin 9 from 3.4 to 10.9 allowed the localization of both primary tumors and metastases in excellent manner except cases with completely necrotic processes. True positive results were found in 19 from 21 persons (93 ~). In 12 pts. the maximum of radioactivity uptake entered after 2 hrs. already. Inflamed tissue showed a lower uptake end a very quick elimination of radionuclide compared with the tumors. Hitherto existing results confirm IG9 Yb NTA as a valuable radiotrecer for both primary and secondary pulmonary tumors. It will be investigated if such a high affinity exists ?or other tumor species. In LAS/ARC patients 67-0A showed 20 l~g and 14 mediastinic positivities of chest X-Nay: 6 pati~ts with abnoroal scintigraI~hy and normal X-Nay developed PCP 2 months later.

It has been recently shown that oPPA is transported into the eardiomyocyte similar to pPPA. In contrast to its para isomer oPPA does not undergo B-oxidation (Kaiser et al. 1990 in press). Thus using the kinetics of oPPA and pPPA an estimate of the rate of B-oxidation corrected for hackdiffusion of the labelled fatty acid may Be determined. The present study was undertaken to evaluate fatty acid metabolism in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Ten patients with DCM and three normals were investigated at rest after an overnight fast. oPPA (4 mCi) and 55 min later pPPA were intravenously injected and a dynamic planar study in LAO-45 projection was acquired. Time activity curves over the regions of superior vena cave and myoeardium were generated and pPPA activity was corrected for background of oPPA. The ratio between the half-lives of 9PPA to cPPA was greater in patients with DCM (0.73 +/-0.17; mean +/-SEM) than in controls (0.40 +/-0.20). There was a correlation hetween left ventrieular end-diastolic pressure and the half life of pPPA (r=0.66, p<0.05). Parametric images (pPPA -oPPA) taken at 2 -7 minutes after injection of tracers showed rather similar image patterns whereas images at25 -30 minutes revealed still remainder accumulation in patients with DCM and no uptake in controls. The results suggest that patients with DCM have reduced oxidation of free fatty acids as compared to controls. The pPPA elimination rate is related to the end-diastolic left ventricular pressure. Isonitrile were injected, respectively. One hour after injection planar images in three views (RPS) and a SPECT study (RPT) were performed. 200 MBq of IPPA were injected at the highest level of a submaximal exercise and two SPECT studies were performed within 45 min (IPT). The planar images were analyzed visually and the SECT's were compared quantitatively to detect \"Redistribution\" in the RPT or turnover rates in the IPT. 1,8, and 8 pts had 3-,2-and 1-vessel disease. One patient had a normal angiogram. Out of 14 infarctions all were detected by RPT and IPT. Only 50% were diagnosed in RPS. Additionally, 3 fixed defects were seen in the inferior wall in RPS related to severe artery stenoses. IPT showed viable myocardium in these regions. True positive diagnoses of ischemia related to the coronary arteriogram was detected by RPT, RPS, IPT in the LAD, RCX, RCA-territory in 85, 30, 90; 75, 40, 85; and 65, 38 , 92 %. Falls positive diagnoses occurred globally in 5,0,and 2 territories in RPT,RPS,IPT, respectively. We conclude that in our small patient group RPS is not able to detect CHD sufficiently. Sensitivity of RPT end IPT are in the same range. IPT detects viability more reliably than RPT and the Isonitriles may be less specific than IPPA. PET showed that metabolic tracers seem to be the most suitable in identifying viable myocardium,when compared to perfusion tracers. Recently a new gamma-emitter metabolic tracer, II23-IPPA, has been available for SPECT studies, presenting potential larger clinical applications. Therefore we studied 12 pts with recent myocardial infarction (beyond the 3rd week) by SPECT, performing firstly a metabolic study (MS) at rest with I123-IPPA (early and delayed imaging) followed by a rest/stress perfusion study (PS) with tc99m-MIBI. We compared the segmental extent (SE) and the grading of the uptake (UG), between the 2 rest studies. We also evaluated the presence of residual ischemia (RI) in the area of infarction (by r/s PS) and the segmental kinesis by ECO.The ES and UG were the same in 6 pts (50%) while the other 6 pts showed at MS (delayed imaging) less large defects than at PS. The presence of RI was just the same in these 2 groups (83% vs 83%). CONCLUSIONS:our data suggest that MS by SPECT can give interesting information on viability as regards PS,especially the delayed imaging of II23-IPPA. However fur ther studies on larger populations are necessary to confirm the better effectiveness of II23-IPPA in identifying viable myocardium. Aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical utility of 1-123 phenylpentadeeanoic acid (IPPA) in the evaluation of patients with coronary artery disease (myocardial ischemia or viable myocardium). SPECT seintigraphie studies were performed with TI-201 and 1-123-1PPA in 84 patients with or without M.I.. Tomographic studies with 1-123-1PPA were performed 5 and 40 min after administration.",

A shorter than usual time of acquisition of GBF studies is desirable in situations where the stabiIity or reproducibility of ventricular contraction cannot be maintained. Stress testing or ventricular tachycardia are such common circumstances. Because the injected dose cannot be increased, the images would have a very low statistics (= 50 photons/pixel/image with 16 images in the RR interval). A low statistics implies the use of algorithms adapted to the construction of accurate GBP images. Because the count rate of each pixel of a cardiac study can be modelized as a heterogenous Poisson process, a discrete series of images is not exhaustive. This led us to the use of a maximum likelihood (ML) technique using the time of arrival of each photon. This additional information may not be sufficient to produce high quality images. Therefore a Bayesian (B) technique was combined to produce a spatial smoothing effect. The method was applied to a set of simulated curves (with different amplitudes and statistics) and to cardiac phantom acquisitions with low statistics. The Poisson parameter was approximated by a 2 harmonics Fourier series. The parameters of the cosine functions were calculated with ML, BML and also with least square (LS), BLS methods and Fourier analysis (FA) with or without a median filtering. References were obtained with a very high statistic acquisition. Amplitude (A) and time to minimum (Tmin) were calculated with the different methods and compared. Results : on a pixel basis, LS is the best method, ML is worse than LS and FA when the A Ere low. Overall, BLS is the best method for the A and BML the best for the Tmin. Conclusion : BML and BLS methods produced promising results with low statistics data. One can expect the same results on gated blood pool acquisitions in patients.",

In conclusion, SPECT was more sensitive when compared with BS and CT in the early detection of FHO and metaphiser hyperactivity may be a useful quantitative parameter besides Pd, in the diagnosis of FHO.

Many methods have been suggested in order to correct Compton scatter in Nuclear Medicine images. An innovative algorithm is proposed here named constrained Factor Analysis of Dynamic Structures (FADS). The procedure needs the whole energy information obtained either by list-mode or multiwindows acquisition. In the later case, FADS is performed on the.series of N energy images. Two oblique factors are extracted, one representing the scatter, and the other a combination of photopeak and residual Compton information. It is impossible to get a pure photopeak factor. A theoretical factor and the Compton factor extracted by FADS are then projected on the initial energy series in order to compute the corrected and the scattered images. This approach is tested on MONTE CARLO simulations and real phantoms, both on planar and SPECT studies. Some clinical images will be presented. The results were compared to those of the Jaszczak's weighted subtraction procedure. The recombination algorithm is more efficient than the two energy windows method, particularly improving the contrast and the signal-to-noise ratio.",

Such distortion is count rate independent and is a function of detector material, size and inter-detector separation. Our correction method can be easily tailored to any PET system available on the market. A new head holder for patient repositioning and fixation in PET has been designed and tested. The device was also used in different neuroimaging systems to obtain an accurate correlation between functional vs functional (e.g. PET vs PET) and functional vs anatomical (e.g. PET vs MRI ,PET vs CT) brain images. Head repositioning is obtained taking as anatomical reference the subject's dental morphology. Using a dentistic precision impression material a complete mould of the subject teeth is obtained in one minute. The moulding substance rests on a bracket that is fixed to the head holder. Every time when the subject undergoes to a new study his personal mould will be used for repositioning. Head fixation during the study is then obtained using a commercial foam or a special pillow connected to a vacum pump that moulds the subject head and hardens in few minutes. External markers made visible on midsagittal MRI, lateral CT and PET images, and successively on the reconstructed final images allow to record and recognize the orientation of the scan and are also used to correlate images from different image modalities as well as follow-up or activation studies using the same device. The head holder was tested on several subjects, a repositioning precision < of 2.5 mm was achieved in the axial, and in the transaxial reconstructed plane while orientation accuracy was 1 degree. This head holder results in a simple noninvasive and accurate method for repositioning, restrain and correlation of brain images. ",

OT and liquid GE were slower (p<0.01) when the blood glucose concentration was >15mmol/L. We conclude that disordered GE and OT in diabetes mellitus are frequent, cannot be diagnosed with confidence on the basis of symptoms, and are related to both autonomic neuropathy and blood glucose concentrations.

Aim of our paper was to study bile-acid metabolism after Cholestyramine quantitatively in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. 22 patients were studied before and after one-month Cholestyramine treatment. A seven-day SeHCAT-test was performed by daily measurements using scintillation camera technique. Serum concentration of bile acids,HDL-and LOL-cholesterols and lipoproteins were also determined. Highly significant decrease of bile acid retention in terms of half-time values was found after Chole~ styramine treatment /p<o.ool/. Decrease of SeHCAT-activi\u2022 seems to have a linear pattern. Significant relationship was found between half-time values of bile acid depletion and lowering of serum LOL-cholesterol level /p~o.o5/. However no correlation was found between total serum bile acid concentration and SeHCAT-absor~ tide suggesting altered bile acid-cholesterol metabolism. In conclusion:SeHCAT-absorption test seems to be useful in monitoring therapeutic effect of Cholestyramine in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. A condensed imaging technique is introduced, which permits the evaluation of gastric motility patterns additionally to standard quantitative measurement of gastric emptying. Up to now 75 patients with normal gastric function and disorders of gastric emptying due to various diseases (peptic ulcer, pylorie obstruction, postoperative dumping syndrome, postvagotomy, diabetic gastroparesis etc.) were studied. Gastric emptying was measured after ingestion of a standard semisolid test meal labeled with 99mTc-DTPA. Dynamic acquisition was performed with a LFOV-gamma camera (160 frames, 15sec/frame, word mode). Quantitative data (e.g. T I/2) were calculated using the time activity curve derived from a gastric ROL For additional qualitative evaluation of gastric motility a condensed image of the gastric Re/ was created in each study. Condensed gastric imaging (CGI) provided well defined images of gastric motility. Characteristic CGI-patterns were not only obtained for normal, rapid and delayed gastric emptying but also for specific states of hypo-and hypermotility. Distribution and behaviour of the test meal within the stomach were excellently visualized by CGI as well. In 34/75 patients CGI provided more information than quantitative measurement of gastric emptying alone. Evaluation of gastric function by CGI permits to visualize normal gastric motility and its disorders. The characteristics of emptying, distribution and behaviour of the test meal within the stomach result in defined CGI-patterns, representing the predominant pathophysiological aspect of the underlying functional disorder. CGI provides valuable information not obtainable by standard quantitative measurements, thus indicating a new, successful approach for the evaluation of gastric motility and its disorders.",

The final diagnosis was: 27 Crohn's disease, 9 ulcerative colitis, 2 indeterminated colitis, 8 functional bowel disorders, I acute gastroenteritis, I gastric edenocoroinoma, 1 ccalonic adenocarclnoma, I ischemi c colitis, I postradiation enteritis and I gyardiasis. Reference methods: -A) Activity of disease: Harveys Index (n= 78), C-reactive protein (n= 52), ESR (n= 66), leukocyte count level (n= 73) and Hcto (n= 72). B) Lecalitation: radiology (n= 33), colonoscopy (n= 29) and surgery (n= 5). We performed sequential AP images of thorax and abdomen, and caudal view of pelvis, at 30' and 3 h. Results : The scan sensibility in the detection of active IBD was 91.9 %, the specificity 93.7 % and the positive predictive value 97.6 %. If we evaluate only the 30' views we obtained a 86 % of sensibility and I O0 % of especificity. The scans failed to reveal three fibrotic stenosis in the termlnal Ileum. The FP scan in 3 h. views was a ischemlc colitis. The laboratory tests, Harvey Index and radiology were less sensitive and specific. The colonosoopy results were; $= 80% and E = 100%. In the 28 patients wlth colonoscopy, the gemmagraphic and endoscopic findings were concordant in 23 (84%-), in 4 (14%) the scan showed more diseased segments, and in I the calonoscopy showed more diseased segments. Olf we only evaluated those segments in which it was possible to make an effective colono~copy (n= 49), we can see a correlation in 48 (97.5 %) and no correlation in I (2.5 %). Conclusions: The 99mTc-HMPAO leukocyte scan: I. Is an ecourate technique in the detection of active IBD. 2. Has a good correlation with the colonoscopy In the assessment of bowel involvement. 3. A negative scan, in a clinical context of disease activity, must suggest a flbrotio stenosis. 4. The 30' views are less sensitive but more specific than the 3 h. views. The aim of the study is to compare the accuracy of emission scintiscan (SPECT) with that of computed transmiss{on tomography (CT) in a series of 23 normal patients and 49 patients with documented alcoholic liver disease. Normal patients are a group initially referred to exclude a metastatic involvement of the liver; aH of them had a normal liver biology and no evidence of liver involvement on initial CT scan or a negative clinical and biological follow-up on a 6 month period. Abnormal patients include 23 patients with histologically documented steatosis and 26 patients with cirrhosis proved by fiver biopsy or portal hypertension. SP'ECT diagnosis is based on the value of the pathological score derived from seven independent quantitative parameters: liver and spleen volumes spleen to liver and marrow uptake ratios spleen to hver volume ratio nonhomogeneous liver uptake 1J't to right hepatic lobe ratio. CT diagnosis is based on qualitative estimation of spleen and liver volumes,-heterogeneity, Hounsfield Unit number of the ver, and presence of ascites. Data were reviewed b3{ a radiologist and a nuclear l~hysician unawared of the final dm~nosis. Nonparametric statistical analysis used Mac Nemar's test for paired observations including Yates' correction for continuity, and binomial test for data not satigfying the requirement of ten discordantpairs. Including all criteria, the sensitivity of CT is significantly lower than SPECT m the whole alcoholic group, (SPECT 84%, CT 63%, p<.025) and in the cirrhosis subgroup (SPECT 92%. CT 69%, 0<.05). A similar difference concerns the steatosis subgroup ISPECT 74%, CT 57%) but results do not reach the significance level, owing to the little number of patients included. With a true negative ratio of 23/23, both techniques yield a specificity of 100% We conclude that SPECT liver scintiscan is a clearly more sensitive technique than CT in patients with diffuse alcoholic liver disease.

In all cases I11 In and 99mTc-HmPAO LS showed concordant results (14 positive and 6 negative). In 10 patients the diagnosis of osteomyelitis was scinti graphically excluded because of either negative BS and L5 or negative LS and positive Be (suggesting non-infected osteopathy like Charcot foot),or positive LS and negative es (suggesting soft tissue infection).These patients received local treatment +/-short-term antlbiotherapy and showed rapid clinical improvement. The 10 patients with positive L5 and BS were treated as osteomyelitis and had control 99mTc HmPAO L5 2 months later. LS interpretation turns out to be uneasy when local discharge is present because the resolution of the scan not always permits clear distinction between osseous and extra-osseous localization of the leukocytes. A portable detector equipped with a home-built focused collimator (3cm focal depth) is now under evaluation to overcome this problem.

After i.v. administration of 37 MBq of 1231-[A14]-insulin (Medgenix), gamma camera images were acquired for 40 min at frame rate of 1 image/15 sec. Regions of interest (ROI) were defined over the heart and liver and time-activity curves (TAC) were generated. Heart TAC was then subtracled from liver TAC after normalization of curves.

POST-SURGICAL FOLLOW-UP OF PATIENTS WITH DIFFERENTIATED THYROID CARCINOMA: IMPORTANCE OF 131-1 WHOLE BODY SCAN. Serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels are often measured in the postsurgical follow-up of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma either alone or together with other parameters such as the uptake of 131-iodine by whole body scan (WBS). The aim of our study was to measure Tg levels in 61 patients receiving L-Thyroxine therapy after thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma and after suspension of therapy, before performing a WBS. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of Tg levels, during L-thyroxine therapy, for diagnosis of tumor residue or metastases were then calculated and compared with results obtained by diagnostic WBS. According to our data it was not possible to discriminate between patients with or without metastases based only on Tg levels either during or after suppressive therapy. Nineteen patients (31%) had normal levels of Tg during Lthyroxine therapy and 9 of them had metastases or local recurrences as evaluated by performing a WBS. Of particular interest, 2 of them, had a negative diagnostic WBS but were treated with 1311 therapy on the basis of clinical considerations and showed the presence of metastases in the lung after a second WBS performed after 1311 therapy. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of Tg levels determination were 83.3%, 58.1% and 70.5% respectively, whereas for the diagnostic WBS were 76.6%, 100% and 82.0% respectively. If results of WBS and Tg were taken into consideration, sensitivity reached 95.7%, specificity 100% and accuracy 96.7%. We conclude that in the management and follow-up of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma periodic 131-1 WBS are essentials since Tg measurement alone does not allow the identification of a significant percentage of patients with metastases. WBS can be integrated by measurement of Tg after suspention of suppressive therapy. Sequencing and cloning human thyreglobulin gene /Tg/ localized on chromosome 8 allows to study its structural changes. The aim of study was to analyze individual DNA sequence variation detected as restriction fragment length polymorphism /RFLP/ at the Tg gene in patients with congenital hypothyroidism. DNA samples were isolated from white blood cells of 20 con genital myxoedema patients and 30 controls. Samples of 10 ug DNA were digested with various restriction endonucleases /Pvu II, Msp I, Hind III, Taq I, BamH., Eco RV/. After electrophoresis and blottinglonto nitrocellulose filter the blots were hybridized. As hybridization probes were used four Psi I human Tg cDNA fragments of the length of 4.05kb pairs cloned in pBR 322. Probes were labelled with /alfa 32-~/ dAT~ /A~ersham/ with specific setivity of 0.5-2.0xi0 dpm/ug. RFI~ were observed for the following enzymes: Taq I, Pvu II, Msp I, Hind III. The respective allele frequencies were approximately: 4%, 8%, 26%, 12%. The use of Tg probes labelled by 32-P-dATP could be of help in the studies of pathogenesis and in prenatal diagnostic of hereditary defects in the synthesis or structure of thyroglobulin. The validity of the SimulTRAC FT4 (Co-57)/\"sensitive\"TSH IRMA MAb (I-125) kit (Becton Dickinson) kit, as regards cost effective thyroid functional profiling, was evaluated in a group of untreated patients (pts) (176 overt or subclinical hypothyroids, 285 overt or compensated hyperthyroids) in comparison with 401 euthyroid controls. Sensitivity (SE) and precision of the simultaneous methods were appropriate for clinical use (SE:0.11 pg/mL and 0.06 pJU/mL for FT4 and TSH respectiveIy;working range:l.8-100 pg/mL and 0.48-105 IzIU/mL for FT4 and TSH respectively).When FT4 and TSH data were evaluated according to the ROC analysis, the best discrimination between pathological and normal conditions was obtained at values of 7-17 pg/mL and 0.3-3.35 IU/mL for FT4 and TSH, respectively.As expected, TSH test, as regards SE, predictive value (+), diagnostic accuracy, proved to be definitely superior in recognizing all the considered pathological conditions. However, FT4frSH test provided a more accurate evaluation of the actual clinical status of subclinical hypothyroidism and of both overt and compensated hyperthyroidism. In the last group, 79.4% of cases with undetectable TSH serum concentration, showed normal FT4 value in agreement with the ascertained normal metabolic status. These results demonstrate the usefulness of this method as a screening procedure in an unselected population; moreover, FT4frSH simultaneous assay, when associated with FT3 assay, provide a definitive functional assessment of both treated and untreated thyroid disorders.

In the 89 pat with normal TSH a significant decrease of TcTUo and dTcTU (TeTUo-TcTUs) with increasing iodine excretion was observed, whereas no correlation was found between TcTUs and iodine excretion. A low TcTUo of !2.0% resulted in an TcTUs!l.l% in all 22 cases. These low TcTUs values exclude relevant mass of functional autonomous tissue. In the second scintiscan only 17 of the 89 pat (19%) had TcTUs values ,1.5%. Conclusions: l) In euthyroid pat with goiter and subnormal TSH a second scintiscan is not useful, because additional TSH suppression does not result in any change of TcTU. 2) In euthyroid goitreous pat with normal TSH and TcTUo!2.0% a scintiscan after TSH suppression is not necessary, because there is no relevant mass of functional autonomous tissue. 3) In all other cases only the TcTUs is relevant for identification of thyroid autonomy. 4) Autonomy with higher risk of hyperthyroidism after iodine contamination (TcTUs>l.5%) was suspected in only 19% of the goitreous pat with normal TSH. Three hundred and sixteen patients with solitary or dominant thyroid nodules and 20 controls were imaged both with 99mTc pertechnetate and 123I. Images were read indepen]dently by 5 experienced readers qualified in nuclear medicine image analysis. In the first trial each reader read one batch (201 films) in the first reading. In the second reading, the readers changed batches so that each film was seen by 2 different readers constituting one pair. Five batches were read by five different pairs of readers. The study w-as organized to follow a balanced incc~lete block design allcmring the 5 readers to read only 40% of the films to cc~lete the study.",

            "text": "The study showed a striking high disagreement among the readers. There is a general belief that thyroid malignancy in hyperthyroidism with thyroid autonomy is exceptionally rare. To appraise the risk of overlooking the malignancy in our patients designed for radioiodine therapy,we performed ultrasound guided (US) fine needle biopsy (FNB)of the hot and, in multinodular goiters in cold noduses as well, in log pts with hyperthyroidism caused by thyroid autonomy. The age span of pts was 30-90 years.8 were male. The average TSH value in pts was 0.i mU/l, TT4 165 55,TT3 3.58 J 1.02. 44 pts had a solitary hot nodule,26 pts had 2 hot noduses, 32 pts had 3 or more hot spots on 99m-To and iSi-J scintigrams. 132 noduses were punctured. In four pts cytological atypism was found. In one of three pts H~rthle cell tumor, in two follieularcell carcinoma was confirmed. It was not possihle to verify the suspected diagnosis of H~rthle cell adenoma in the fourth pt. One pt with uninodular goiter had follicular carcinoma. Three pts with detected atypism had multinodular goiters. Scintigraphicaly the follicular carcinomas were hot. The pts with HHrthle cell tumors had several hot spots shown by the scans, wherefore it was impossible to decide if the tumor tissue accumulated the tracer. Conclusions:In 2.9% of our hyperthyrotic pts with uninodular or multinodular thyroid autonomy thyroid malignancy was detected. We consider this incidence high enough to warrant US guided FNB in every pt with thyroid autonomy before definitive treatment with radioiodine. ]he diagnostic value of 99m Tc (V) dimercaptosueninlc acid (I~A) was investigated in 14 patients (4 females and i0 nmles),sged ii~7, with proved medullary thyroid carcinoma. 5 were ~N IIA and 9 sporadic MIC. They had all been previously treated with total thyroJdentomy and presented persistently elevated CT levels (12 sqhjsets beaally and 2 after stin~lus). Planar scan with 444 MBq of 99mTc~NCGA was made 180 minutes after tracer administration. In the first exa~fimation, seintigraphic inmgiags obtained with (V)I~A gave 9 negative responses out of 14. In a second study performed 8 to 18 months later, 3 patients out of 9, who had previously been negative, became positive at (V)I~A, probably in relation to the increasing size of the mass. If we consider only those patients who presented already proven recurrent disease (8 subjects), 6 were {~{SA positive: in this case (V)O~BA sensitivity was 75%. Such sensitivity is much lower (50%) when considering all the 14 subjects with high CT levels. Taking only those subjects with high CT levels and negative ins~tal investigations, (V)I~A sensitivity is about 17%. Recently, using SPgCT we found with (V)~V~A 2 positive cases which were doubtful at planar scan. Frcm our data it cornea out how the planar (V)I~BA aniatigraphy is able to identify with good sessiti~ity metastases that were ulresdy identified with other investigations. But the sensitivity is much lower when recurreneas are unknown, as we already reported at the 7bird International Workshop on MeaII in Heidelberg (Sept. 89).

Trying to assess the usefulness of various diagnostic procedures for selecting pts for surgery, we divided pts into four groups: G i) 40 pts with positive or suspicious findings for malignancy on FNA (28 pts were malignant on hystology). G 2) 55 pts with cold nodules (26 pts had positive findings for neoplasm on histology). G 3) 31 pts selected for surgery on the basis of other diagnostic procedures (5 pts showed neoplasm on histologic examination). G 4) 31 pts with positive or suspicious FNA and cold nodules (23 pts were histologically malignant). Our data emphasize that malignant or suspicious FNA seems to be the most reliable diagnostic procedure (70%)(G.I); IS (cold nodules) is reliable in 47.3% of cases (G.2); other diagnostic methods than IS and FNA are valuable in 16.1% of cases (G.3). At last, if we evaluate G.4 pts (submitted to both TS and FNA), diagnostic accuracy increases to 74.2%. Therefore our experience suggests that in the preoperative assessment of SN pts, criteria with exclude TS and/or FNA are less accurate in selecting pts for surgery than IS alone, and FNA provides adequate procedure for surgery in 70% of cases, but when TS is employed in addition to the preoperative assessment of SN, overall perc6niaQe of correct diaqnoses increases to 74.2%.

Since A inhibits the peripheral co~version of thyroxin(Ta) to triiodthyromin(T3),the measurement of the serum-levels of T4 and T3 don't reflects correctly the real thyroid condition.In most cases the basel TSH-level reflects correctly the exact thyroid state,however in subclinical conditions the THH-TSH-teet is more suitable for investigation of patients treated with ~. in 60 patients on long term therapy with A total T4, total T3, free T4, free T3, reverse T3, basal TSH measurements and TRH-TSH-test was performe~.

It is suggested that elevated PIII, pFn or-OC with simultaneously suppressed TSH may reflect excessive effect of thyroid hormones at peripheral tissue level in some patients with preclinicsl hyperthyroidism which may be detrimental in the long-term. The detection by gamma camera imaging of pathological lymphocytic infiltrations may have relevance for the diagnosis of inflammatory lesions, lymphoproliferative disorders and autoimmune diseases. Attempts using radiolabelled autologous lymphocytes or using radiolabelled, lymphocyte specific, monoclonal antibodies have practical and/or clinical disadvantages. Interleukin-2 (IL2) is a lymphocyte growth factor that binds only to activated lymphocytes and monocytes. We have labelled IL2 with 123Iodine. The Lactoperoxidase/Glucose oxidase technique was the labelling method of choice leading to immunoreactive IL2 with high specific activity (150-200 I~Ci/p.g). Labelled IL2 (50-100 p.Ci) was injected i.v. in 28 Non Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice. These mice spontaneously develop an autoimmune diabetes similar to human Type 1 diabetes characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the endocrine pancreas. Eight NOD mice were injected with 1231-Lactalbumin a protein of the same molecular weight of IL2. Twenty NOD mice were sacrificed at different times for single organ studies and autoradiography; 8 were used for gamma camera images. Results showed that pancreas radioactivity was significantly higher in mice injected with IL2 as compared to those injected with Lactalbumin (3.87_+0.04 vs 0.75_+0.15, % of injected dose per gram of tissue 5 min after the injection, p<0.0001, and 2.57+0.15 vs 1.05+_0.22, 20 rain after the injection, p<0.003). Gamma camera images also showed uptake in the generated region of the pancreas. There was a positive correlation between counts in this region and the extent of infiltration histologically evaluated (CC=0.908; P<0.03). Autoradiography of pancreas sections confirmed the localization of radioactivity on lymphocytes infiltrating the islets. In conclusion, 1231-labelled IL2 retains its capacity to bind in vitro and in vivo to activated lymphocytes and this technique can be applied to humans for the in vivo detection o! patholngical Ly m p h ecyti~ jnf~tr a~Jons.

All patients underwent surgery after scanning (3-7 days later). One patient with primary cancer was a true negative (no antigen expression at immunohystochemistry). Two NED patients were true negative and one was a false positive (granuloma). Resected tumor and normal tissue were counted for dosimetry calculation. Tumor to normal tissue ratio was 20:1 (range 12:1 -28:1). Injected dose (i.d.) per gram of tumor was 0.2+0.1%.

Blood clearance was determined. A single injection of avidin reduced the circulating activity by 37% in 10 minutes and by 42% in 180 minutes. These values were achieved in 6-8 days with the traditional method.

Patients and methods : Sere are obtained from 54 euthyroid controls and 82 patients with NTI (18 renal fai-lures~ ii infectious diseases~ 21 medical intensive cares, 16 myelomes and 16 carcinomas). The methods are two one-step assays (Amerlex-M radiolabeled analog method and Amerlex-MAB method based upon a competition for a labeled antibody, both from AMERSHAM) and one two-stage method (RIA-gnost From BEHRING which uses coated tubes and 1251-T4 derivative as tracer). Results : Decreased mean FT4 values are found in patients with sepsis syndrome (P<5%) or in medical intensive care (p<O~O01) only with Amerlex-M. FT4 concentration measured by one-step assays are more affected by renal failure (p<O,O01) than those estimated with two-step RIA-gnost (P<5%)-Among patients with myelome, only results of Amerlex-M and RIA-ghost are lower than normal (P<5%). On the other hand, if the mean FT4 value of. each method appears higher than normal in the group of carcinoma, the difference is statistically significant only for Amerlex-MAB (P<5%). Conclusion : These Findings confirm that in the overall patients without neoplasic illness, FT4 measured with the Amerlex-M kit should be considered with caution, in these patients, especially in those with renal insufficiency, the RIA-gnost kit appears to be the most effective. On the other hand, among patients with myelome or carcinoma, the results of the Amerlex-FiAB and RIAghost kits appear not to be better than the estimations of the Amerlex-M kit. Although a close relationship has been reported in some papers beetween Human-alpha-Atrialnatri'uretic peptide(H-~ANP) values and the functional status of thyroid,generally there is a discordance about the existence of this relationship.",

This significant difference between before and after treatment values of H-~ ANP in hypothyroid and hyperthyroid patients has shown that there is a relationship between the levels of the thyroid hormones and 1{-ANP.It is also concluded that some of complications seen in the thyroid dysfunction might be related to changes of H-~ANP concentration in plasma. The circulating parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a mixture of native hormone and degradation fragments; change in renal clearance induces an increase of the fragments that reflects immunological but not biological activity; we compared in patients on dialysis the results obtained with 3 different radioimmunoassays at the beginning and at the end of the dialysis. Two groups of patients were studied: the first one included ii patients dialysed with a polysulfene membrane, and the second one i0 patients dialysed with a cuprophane membrane; radioimmunoassays kits recognize either the intact PTH (PTHi BAXTER), the C terminal fragments (PTHc ORIS) or the median fragments (PTBm BAXTER). At the beginning of the dialysis, whatever membrane is used, PTHc and PTHm levels were always increased; PTHi levels distinguished from the others because 8 values in 20 were within the normal range; at the end of the dialysis, every value of PTH decreased when polysulfone membrane was used; in the opposite the PTHi alone decreased when using cuprophane membrane; this particular behavior of PTHi cannot be explained by a crossing through the membrane because its molecular weight is too high; that may be explained by regulation mechanismes or adsorption phenomena; experimental data with radiolabelled PTH agree with the second hypothesis. Our study shows the singularity of PTHi assay. It proves the necessity in dialysed patients to take into account the time of blood collection during the dialysis, the nature of the membrane used and the type of parathyroid hormone measured. ",

Type Ill procollagen is suggested to be a new important index expres-.sing the pathophysiological dynamics in conditions of breakdowq and growth of connective tissue. In an attempt to assess the diagnostic effectiveness of type III procollagen (PIIINP)~ we measured its serum values by RIA in 69 subjects, classified as follow: 13 normal volontiers (control group),37 patients with hyperthyroidism and 19 patients ,with thyroditis Hashimoto.

The serum levels were statistically higher in the hy L perthyroidics (p<0.01) compared with the Hashimoto's cases. Sensitivity and specificity have been studied, according to the site and the extent of the disease. PI]INP specificity washighef in the hyperthyroidism (87%), compared with thyroiditis (71%), while sensitivity appeared to be almost equal in both under study diseased groups (69% in hyperthyroidism, 67% in thyroiditi~, Conclusion:Determination of PHINP is an easy to perform assay. it shows to be an of high sensitivity index while it promises to be developed as an excellent criterion for the follow up in the thyroid disturbances. Testosterone is present in human serum in Free (unbound) solutlon end bound to transport protelne as albumin and sex hormone binding globulin. The free fraction is eoneidered as the main biologically active androgen. Recent studies suggest that the free testosterone (FT) may be s better discriminatory index between hlrsute and non hirsute women than total testosterone (TT). Therfore, the aim of this study is to determine the contribution of the FT in the evaluation of hirsutism. Serum samples from 76 hirsute momen (study group) and 21 normal women (control group) were analyzed for TT, DHEAS, FSH, LH, and FT using RIA kits from DPC/Behring. According to the clinical features and biological results the study group was divided into ) groups : -group I, n=16 (21~) : ovarian hirsuhism when LH/FSH ratio greater than 2 at the day 5 of the menstrual cycle (polycystic ovary syndrome, PCOS); -group II, n:8 (11~) : mixed hirsutism when DHEAS is also increased (adrenal congenital hyperplasia); -group Ill, n=52 (68%) : idiopathic hirsutism when ovulatory menstrual cycles are associated to normal or lightly increased androgen levels and to familial hirsutism. Our results chow that in secretory hirsutism TT is increased in 57% and FT in 60% oF patients and in idiopathic hirsutism TT is increased in 7% and FT in 48% of patients. From these data, we suggest that FT assay is useful in the investigation of hirsute women and may be considered aS a better parameter of androgen action than TT.

The first results in women with malignant gynaecologlc tumours stimulated us to extend the assessment of the efficacy of this tumour marker in such patients. Sixty-five women were examined, among them 12 aged 50 -81 years with ovarian cancer (T2NOM0 -T3N1M1), 40 aged 29 -95 years with breast cancer (T1NOM0 -T2N2M0) and 13 aged 49-85 years with uterine cancer (T1 bNOM0-T2bNOM0). In blood samples taken prior to treatment and during follow-up, the serum level of CA 72-4, CA 125, CA 15-3, CA 19-9 and TPA was determined by radioimmunoassay using monoclona[ antibodies in the case of CA 72-4, CA 125, CA 15-3 and CA 19-9. Serum CA 72-4 was elevated in 5 patients with ovarian cancer, 10 with breast cancer and 2 with uterine cancer. Serum CA 125/CA 15-3/CA 19-9/TPA respectively, was raised in 6/8/3/6 women with ovarian cancer, in 13/21/10/12 with breast cancer and 3/4/4/3 women with uterine cancer. CA 724 had risen as the only tumour marker in one woman each suffering from uterine or breast carcinoma. The sensltlvlty of serum CA 72-4 was 5/12 (41,7 %) for ovarian cancer, 10/40 (25, 0 %) for breast cancer and 2/13 (15,4 %) For uterine carcinoma. The specificity of serum CA 72-4 amounted to 93,3 %. In conclusion, the use of serum CA 72-4 as tumour marker in patients with ovarian, breast or uterine carcinoma deserves further attention. The purpose of this study was to get insight into biodistribution of CA 72-4 by its simultaneous determination in effusions and serum, and assess its value in diagnosis of malignant effusions.Immunoradiometric essay of CA 72-.4 by CIS kit was made in effusions and in serum of 43 pts with nonmalignant dise~es and in 65 pts with cancer of various origin. TI~ normal vsJiues in effusions and in serum were up to 6 U/ml. False positive value was found only in one pt with nonmalignant lung disease and none with liver cirrhosis.The pathological levels in effusions were registered in: gastrointestinal ca 19/29(serum 14/29) ~ lung ca 7/ll(serum 4/11), ovary ca 13/18(serum 8/18), other ca 1/7( serum o/7). The incidence and levels of CA 72-/} ~mre higher in effusions than in serum. Significant correlation between the values of CA 72-4 in effusions and serum was found (r=-o,4425;p~olol) . Through the evaluation of results by sensitivity-specificity diagram it has been established that CA 72-4 in effusions has acceptable diagnostic characteristics. In conclusion~ the determination of CA 72-4 levels in effusions is useful aid in differentiating nonmalignant from malignant peritoneal and pleural effusions.",

The results obtained In this studies indicate that anti-microsomal autoantibodies coexist with anti-membranous autoantlbodles, The RIA was of much higher sensitivity than the tmmunofluorescence method. In 39 normal controls and in 51-patients with homozygous B/T,29 with splenectomy (13 M and 16 F aging between iO-29 yrs X 22,4 yrs) (group I),and 22 without splenectomy, (7 M and 15 F, aging from 3-30 yrs,X 15.7) (group 2)also in 17 patients with S/T,(7 M and i0 F aging from 17-65 yrs X 35,4) (group 3) BTG and B2-M was determined by radioimunoassay. All patients had normal renal function; also care was taken during blood collection in order to avoid B/TG release from platelets. The increased B-TG in all groups-as compared to the controls (P<O.OOl) is attributed to the plate!et st9 mulation as they pass the damaged endothelium of the vessels of these patients.The greater increase in the non-splenectomised and in the sickle-cell thalassaemic patients as compared to the splenectomised (P<O.O5) is moreover attributed to the presence of the spleen and the existing diaphragms of the reticuloendothelial system which make difficult the blood flow and results to platelet stimulation. No difference between the level of B2-M of normals and those of the three groups was observed.This correlates well.with the good renal function of all of these subjects, normals and patients. Msli~cy has been associated with abnormslities of blood cosg~aticm which can create a hypereosgulable state, often mild and clinically non apparent, but proceeding to lh~is c~ nmnnifesting as disseminate intravsscular casgulatic~ (DIC). To further investigate this problem we measured, by RIA, FPA (n.y.:l,08-5,8 ng/ml) in the seru~ of 9S fete patients previously masteetomized for breast cancer. None of ~ase had clinical symptons of venous thr~lism or infection and neither had ~they received snticasgulant drugs or ~ndergone chemoTherapy at the time of the first observation. Fifty-two cases were claasifled as stage I -II and presented an apparently inactive disease (group A), 41 cases had an advanced disease with metastases (grotp B). FPA was elevated in 7 (i3.Ff/o) patients of gro~o A and in 2g (70.7%) of group B. Average levels of FPA were significantly higher than in 20 normal controls (S.l + 2.8 ng/m), both in grotp A (15.2S + 8.4 ng/ml) and in group B (g3.63 + 28.13 ng/ml). When cancer groups were mutually cc~pared, FPA was si~aiflcantly elevated in group B. All patients were controlled with serial measurements of FPA. In i0 patients of grs~ A FPA was either high (4 eases)c~ rose (6 eases)6-7 ~nths prior the clinical detection of metastatic disease. The re~ining S patients with initial and persistent high values have not developed metastases tp to date. In the grot<o B, 18 patients t~derwent disease progreasic~l and FPA, initially elevated, further rose. In the g eases, with apparent disesse remission, FPA fell in the S with previously high levels, but not within normal range, and it remained normal in the others. No change of the disease Occurred in the remaining 14 patiente end FPA was imrmdified, if already high, or it increased. Our data suggest that persistent high FPA levels in patients masteetomized for breast cancer could reflect subclinical recurrences, preceding clinical appearenee by several months; however, normal values do not exclude this. In addition, FPA might prove important in follow-up of patients with advanced breast cancer, since it tended to increase in CUE cases with disease progression while decreased or was normal in patients with disease remission The aim of this study was to determine the urinary prostagiandin levels in cirrhotic patients with ascites before and after therapy.",

The possibility to get accurate quantitative and reproducible data about the glucose uptake allows the application of the method for chemotherapy treatment planning. We evaluated the change in tumor metabolism as measured by FDG and the changes in tumor or lymph node volume in 12 patients with head and neck tumors. PET studies with FDG were performed prior and after the first chemotherapeutic cycle. The chemotherapeutic protocol included 5-FU (1000 mg/m 2) and Cisplatinum (150 mg/m2). Volumetric data were obtained from tumors and lymph nodes using computertomographic slices and the growth rate was calculated assuming an exponential function. After standardization of the PET-FDG images for the body weight and the injected dose a quantitative evaluation was done with a region of interest technique. The final evaluation includes data about the glucose uptake in 4 tu mors and 11 lymph nodes, while data about the growth rate were ob tained in 3 tumors and 8 lymph nodes. We noted an increase in FDG accumulation in one ease and a decrease in 7 lesions. No change in metabolism was found in 7 eases. In the same patient multiple lymph nodes may show a different metabolic activity prior to chemotherapy and also differing changes in metabolism during therapy. A 10% decrease in FDG uptake after therapy was followed by a 2.7-fold higher decrease in tumor volume as compared to lymph node volume. The changes in FDG uptake and the tumor growth rate showed a high correlation (r=0.9). Our results show that PET with FDG should find use for chemotherapy management.

Twenty patients with malignant melanoma were imaged with F(ab')2 fragments of ant\u2022 monoclonal antibody (MoAb)225.28S labelled with teehnetinm-99m(Tc99m).Patien ts were placed in two groups.The low suspicion group (8 patients) consisted of patients with no evidence of disease.In four patients (50%) the immunoscintigraphy(ISG) revealed disease that was not expected;in two patients, four imaged sites could not yet be confirmed by conventional studies.The high suspicion group consisted of patients with established evidence of metastatic disease; the ISG was performed to confirm those findings and to search for involvement of other organ systems.Of these scans II were true positive and one false negative.In this group a total of 45 sites demonstrated localization of radiolabelled antibody;40(88.8%) corresponded to known sites of the disease;5(11%) were \"discovered\" by ISG and subsequently confirmed by conventional studies. Routine clinical analyses to evaluate hematopoietic,hepatic,pancreatic and renal functions were performed before the administration of the radiopharmaceutical and were repeated two weeks later.No adverse reactions were ever observed. The aim of the study was to assess the value of the bone marrow scintigraphy in various hematological conditions. The test group comprised 56 adult patients /pts/, including malignant lymphoma /30 pts/, acute mylogenous leukemia /5 pts/, myelodysplastic syndrome /5 pts/, myeloproliferative syndrome /9 pts/, multiple myeloma /5 pts/ and aplastic anemia /2 pts/. The bone marrow scintigraphy was performed 90 min. after iv injection of 99mTc nanocoll. Fifty-five out of 56 patients showed following abnormalities in the bone marrow scintigraphy: focal areas of increased activity, focal cold lesions, peripheral bone marrow expansion with high uptake of the colloid in the central areas, peripheral bone marrow expansion with reduced uptake of the radiocolloid in the central areas, reduced uptake of the radiocolloid in the central areas without peripheral bone marrow expansion. It is concluded that the scintigraphy is a valuable method for detecting and describing bone marrow abnormalities in hematological diseases.

Three normal volunteers were imaged with ~^Tcm-~MPA0 labelled white cells only. Knee positioning, marker images, scanning at 22 hours and) quantitatiOn(l of uptake was previously described . At the time of scanning, pain in each knee was measured using a visual analogue scale. In the three D~rmal volunteers there was no apparent uptake of ~Tcm-~PPA0 labelled white cells in the knees. Uptake measurements in OA patients ranged between 0.001-0.05% of injected dose (ID), (mean 0.019+/-0^~12). In individual knees of three patients, ~Tcm-~g~PA0 labelled white cell uptake was nil; irrespective of whether such pa~ents experienced any pain in the knees. >>Tcm-MDP uptake in all 9 patients was 0.204-0.96% ID (mean 0.626+/-0.21).

In some patients with cardiac dysfunetion, the LVEF values seem too low, given their good clinical status. This study compares these two techniques as a function of the homogeneity (or not) of the LV contraction: 36 consecutive patient records are analyzed: LVEF is computed both on FPS and EQS. Wall motion is scored from 0 to 3 as (normal, hypo-, a-, dys-kinesia), for the three segments seen on FPS (apex, inferior and anterior wall) and on EQS (apex, septum and lateral wall).

Distribution of amplitudes within the left ventricular /LV/ area was measured using the reference circle method, developed lately. In Nm an amplitude decrease equal to SDU-I was found in 13.72% of the LV area and equal to SDU-2 in 0.89~.~ None of those subjects showed abnormality greater than SDU-2. Defect measure D~vI amounted to 0.85%. In patients with ~I the SDU, LVa% and Dr~ values were significantly greater than in Nm. The highest values of those indices were found in patients with aneurysm. A less pronounced PA reduction was observed in anterior wall infarction and the lowest one in posterior wall infarction. The sensitivity of the reference circle method in detecting regional hypokinesis was 85.27~, specificity 100.O% and accuracy 85.4%. In patients with regional hypokinesis the visual evaluation of the statistically encoded image revealed a sharply outlined, easy to detect area. It is concluded that the reference circle method enables regional hypokinesis to be detected, localized and quantified accurately. It may be concluded that combined LV radiocardiography and pressure measurement can be carried out in the oath lab, and with this method ischemic changes of systolic and diastolic LV function can be measured reliably in pts with coronary artery disease.

Methods: 5 patients with extensive 3-vessel disease and 3 normal controls were studied. Rest and maximal exercise studies were done within a week. Injection to right medial cubital vein was flushed with 20ml saline in both occasions. Exercise continued 1 89 after the injection. Blood was collected 3, 6, 10, 20, 35 and 60 min after the injection. Four 180 degrees SPECT acqnisitons were made with Siemens Orbiter cammacamera. Blood extraction was calculated with Sejrsen's extrapolation. Myocardial and blood effective half-lives were calculated for rest and exercise. Lateral and septal profiles were corrected for partial volume effect and spillover. RESULTS: Extraction in rest was in controls 33 +-3% and in patients 34 +-i% (+-SEM). Fast component Ex-T~ was in controls 1.6 +-0.1min and in patients 3.0 +-0.6min and Rest-T 89 respectively 1.3 +-0.2 / 1.6 +-0.1min. Slow component Ex-T 89 was 4.3 +-5.0 / 76 +-30 and Rest-T 89 49 +-6.0 / 40 +-4.0min. In septal myocardiumEx-T 89 was 3.6 +-0.6h / 4.8 +-0.9h and in lateral myocardium 3.1 +-0.6h /4.4 +-0.9h. Corresponding rest half-lives were 4.2 +-0.i / 5.2 +-1.0 and 3.7 +-0.6 / 5.3 +-1.0h. Conclusions: Blood clearance is faster in controls probably due to more strenuous exercise. Myocardial washout is faster in controls than in severe coronary disease. This should be taken in account when protocols are designed. Assessment of reperfusion following i.v. thrombolysis after myocardial infarction is routinely based on clinical, ECG and enzymatic criteria that do not allow quantitative evaluation of myocardial salvage.",

TC-99m MIBI (740Mbq) was given inmediately before starting \"IT and tomographic imaging was performed 2/3 hrs postinjection (S1). The perfusion study was then repeated 2 and 15 days after TT ($2-$3). Tomographic data were analyzed semiquantitatively by circumferential profile analysis (60 segments) performed on I cm thick slices. In each segment, activity was expressed as percent of maximal value. In comparing sequential studies from the same pts only absolute changes of more than 20% in at least 3 adjacent segments were considered significant. After TT ($2) only 3 pts exhibited a 39+1% increase in activity in the infarcted region and a further 33% increase was observed in 1 in $3. Of the 5 remainig pts who showed no immediate changes in regional perfusion after TT(S2), 4 increased activity in the infarcted region (22_+2%) on $3, We may conclude that ,in AMI, TC-99m MIBI SPECT allows semiquantitative objective evaluation of the initial area at risk and the assessment of early and late reperfusion after thrombolysis. To evaluate if Perfusion Study (PS), in the acute phase of myocardial infarction, can correctly identify the extent of the area of necrosis, we performed PSs with Tc99m-MIBI, in the follow-up in 38 pts,who,in the acute phase, underwent a rest PS with Tc99m-MIBI.AII the pts were at their ~' AMI.The stress PS was performed, on the average, after 118 days from AMI; during the follow-up period no important coronary events occurred (NewIMA-PTCA-CABG).We evaluated, by 2 different operators, both the segmental extent (SE) and the grading of the perfusion defect (OPD) of the 2 rest PSs. In 83 pts SE was the same, in 5 was reduced; while GDP was the same in 21 pts, and improved in ]7.Between these 2 groups, we found no significant differences about mean interval at the 1 ~* PZ (62vs50hours), at the 2 ~ PS (107vsI30 days) and residual ischemia. At the ~f Pg, 15 pts (39%) had transmural perfusion defects (TPDs) and 23 noTPDs; at the 2 ~ PS only 6 pts (16%) shewed TPDs and 32 pts noTPDs. CONCLUSIONS:I) PS of NI in the acute phase correctly identifies the area of necrosis. 2)the larger perfusion defect observed in the 1 ~ rest PS is probably related to the areas of \"stunned myoeardium\" in the acute phase of MI. 3)therefore we think that, to obtain a correct evaluation of the area of necrosis,it's preferable to postpone the rest PS about at the S'4 week from acute episode.

Methods: Myocardial SPECT-studies were performed I hour after injection under exercise (185 MBq) and rest (555 MBq) conditions, respectively. In 29 sectorial regions projected on polar plots of the myocardium exercise (VIE) and rest (VIR) vitality index were calculated. Additionally we determined the exercise/rest ratio (CE/ CR) of myocardial Tc-99m-MIBI-uptake in each myocardial region. Results: In 71.6% of patients CE/CR increased consistent with an improvement of coronar circulation after suecess~ full PTCA. The average increase was 11.6~176 of values obtained before PTCA in those regions supported by the stenosed vessels. Increase of CE/CR was most significant in myocardial regions supported by coronary arteries with stenoses less than 90 % (15.2% of pretherapeutic value), whereas it was only 8.7~ after PTCA of subtotally stenosed vessels and 8.8% after recanalisation. Conclusions: Quantified Tc-99m-MIBI-SPECT is suitable for monitoring patients undergoing PTCA. The lower increase of CE/CR in regions supported by subtotal stenosed or occluded vessels may be due to rarefication of the poststenotic microvasculature. Thus CB/CR is a new approach to study coronary microcirculation. Tc-99m MIBI has been proved as a T1-201 substitute for myocardial imaging. Two imaging protocols have been proposed for a one day study.

In each case further evaluation of the conventional slices was performed by maans of a recently developped soft ware programn that was provided by the SIRENS AG. After equal reconstruction and zocming of stress-and rest slices this progra~m alows normalization on studies hotpoint before creation of contour images of the left ventricle autcmatically or by manual ROl's. Then rest/stress quotient images are calculated frcm corresponding contour slices and normalized to a n~Jium level of intensity. These contour quotient slices were juged by two independent observers. In the cases of disagreement consensus was found by discussion. Conventional evaluation, i.e., visual comparison of stressand rest slices was perfon~ed by a third coworker unconscious of the other results. We found 27 ischemic myocardial areas in 22 patients by conventional evaluation and 24 ischemias in 20 patients by quotient images. Both methods show a correspondence of only 33 % (9/27), i.e., 18 ischemias weren't recognised by quotient slices, 15 other were found supplementary. Towards these results the usefulness of rest/stress quotient images in the diagnosis of ischemic myocardial areas is doubtful. A disadvantage might be the appearance of border artefacts in the quotient contour slices caused by incongruences. Further clinical investigations as a c~arison with coronary angiography have to be done in order to der~3nstrate potential advantages of this new method. In a previous study, we have shown it was possible to evaluate the LVEF by acquisition of the myocardial cavity activity for 30\" after the IV injection of 550 MBq of 99mTc MIBI for myocardial scintigraphy. To furtherassess the early kinetics of the tracer, we generated time/activity curves of 4 ROI'S (myocardial cavity: MC, myocardial wall: MW, lung: LU and liver: LI) and followed the evolution with time of MC/MW, LU/MW and MW/LI ratios in i4 patients referred for myocardial scintigraphy, who received 550 MBq of 99mTc MIBI. The acquisition time was 5' in a LAO view. MC/MW activity ratio decreased rapidly with time according to a negative power function: MC/MW=3, 3 (r=0, 9; p<0, 001 ) . 85\" after injection, the wall activity was equal to that of the cavity The evolution of LU/MW was also best described by a negative power function: LU/MW=I,]Yxt^-O,2 (r=0,8; p<O,00]). According to the curves, the activities found in the MC and LU at 60' were still 3OP~ and 23~ from that of the MW. Inpatients who were recorded at one hour, the% found in the 2 ROI'S confirmed those predicted by the theoretical curves. The LI activity increased very rapidly: MW/ 77 (r=0, 8; p<0, 001) , but the later evolution of the ratio did not correspond to that predicted by the curve, because of the excretion of 99mTc-MIBI by the gallbladder and biliary ducts: at 60', the average activity of the MW was 1/3 of that of the LI. To conclude: in case of planar scintigraphy, despite a rapid decrease of activity in MC and LU, the residual important background at, I H could lead to interpretation problems, especially for small lesions. Moreover, the activity of LI could produce artifactua; images in the left lateral views. To ovoid those problems, SPECT should always be preferred to planar scintigraphy when 9gmTc MIBI is used as myocardial tracer. To identify patients (pts) with increased likelihood of future cardiac events because of viable but jeopardized myocardium, TC-99m-MIBI SPECT myocardial scintigraphy associated to dipyridamole test (DMS) and 2D echocardiographic monitoring during dipyridamole infusion (up to 0.84 mg/Kg over i0' ) (DET) were evaluated in 67 asymptomatic pts (62 male, age 57+4) with uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who have undergone thrombolytic theraphy . DMS was performed in 26 ($9%) and DET in 68 (94%) respectively out of 67 pts within 8-12 days after AMI. All pts underwent coronary sngiography (single vessel 47, double vessel 24, triple vessel disease 6). Mean follow-up was 12 months (4-20) : 1 death, 7 angina and 2 AMI recurrences. 8 PTCA, 3 CABG were observed. DMS, DET and DMS+DET showed a sensitivity for events of 88%, 5~/o and 85% respectively; a specificity of 50~ 71% and 45%; a predictive accuracy for negative test of 92%, 83%, 89%. DMS and DET were observed to induce reversible perfusion defects and new wall motion abnormalities confined to the infarct-related area in 7/18 e 15/45 pts With single vessel disease respectively, suggesting the presence of jeopardized but viable myocardium. Conclusions: DMS is an useful tool in risk stratification after thrombolysis in AMI. It shows a higher sensitivity than DET for predicting events. DMS+DET do not permit to increase the sensitivity and predictive accuracy of each method. Previously described platelet labelling techniques (e.g. iLIIn-oxine), take more than 24 hrs. before definitive scintigraphic assessment of thrc~enicity can be made. Recently,t~e lipophylic substance 99n~c-}94PAO,originally developed for brain scintigraphy, has been successfully used for leukocyte labelling (Peters A.M.et ai. Lancet II, 1986; 946) . We applied this method to platelets. A mean labelling efficiency of 63% and a mean release of 33% label per 24 hrs. was found. In vitro quality control of platelet viability (membrane integrity, energy rsetabolism, morphology, activation) was found only slightly less than for fresh platelets. In order to study whether these platelets, despite the considerable release of label, can be used clinically, they were re-injected in patients undergoing intraltmlinal intervention, 89 hour before angioplasty. The results of the first 5 patients show that this technique is a sensitive method to assess the thrombogenicity of (damaged) endotheli~n and has practical advantage above currently used ~nethods, because a decissive scan can be made already I hour after angioplasty. Despite prophylactic use of ASA, 99n~c accnmnulation was found at all sites of angioplasty and at the sites of introduction. A second scintigraphy, 4 hours after the first, did not yield extra infoz~ation. It seems forthwile to investigate the suitability of this technique as a monitor for anti-platelet drugs. H.

Prior studies were based on 48 h scans because of the lower background and better contrast. But patients and surgeons ask for earlier results (biopsy result after 4-6 hrs). 40 heart-transplanted pts were investigated 24 and 48 hrs after intravenous application of 74 MBq 111-In-antimyosin. The heart/lung ratio (H/L) of the anterior view as an indicator of myocardial cell damage was compared after 24 and 48 hrs in relation to the biopsy: The group with a moderate or severe rejection and thegroup with mild or no rejection showed similar decrease in H/L ratios from 24 to 48 hrs (0.19-+0.15 versus 0.22+0.13). Using a threshold of 1.80 H/L ratio at 24 hrs and 1.60 at 48 hrs, quite equal false negative results (24/48 h-> 30%) and false positive results (24 h->24%, 48 h-> 18%)were found. In summary the 24 h-scan is a valid base in the early diagnosis of the heart transplant rejection, better accepted by surgeons and patients than the 48 h-scan. The early scintigraphy Is the appropriate tool for successful clinical application. The effectiveness of In-lll antimyosin (In-AM) imaging (Centoeor, Leiden) for detecting moderate and severe acute heart transplant rejection is well-known. In order to determine its reliability in mild transplant rejection, 14 pas (12 males, 2 females) were assessed by endomyoeardial biopsy on day of In-AM imaging. When possible, 2, 4, 6 and ig weeks after transplantation, planar imaging (anterior, LAO 45 ~ or LAO 60 ~ ) were performed 48 hours after injection of 92,5 MBq In-AM. Immediatelz thereafter patients were injected 30 MBq Thallium 201 to locate, in the same positions, accurate heart ROI. Quantification of antimyosine uptake was calculated from ROI analysis : heart to lung ratio (H/L) and heart to total body count, on day of imaging (H/B). Thirty-one scintigraphic studies were performed (2 patients ~ x, 2 patients 3 x, 7 patients 2 x, 3 patients 1 x). EME showed 6 mild rejections episodes (MR) and 25 without reject$on (NR). No statistical differences (Student test) were found regarding H/L (1.90 for MR versus 1.83 for NB) and H/B (24% for MR versus 23% for NR) in the 2 groups. In stable patients H/L ratio decreased significantly after the fourth week (p = 0.014). During the first 12 weeks, In-AM imaging could not differentiate mild rejection from no rejecting heart transplant although heart ROI outlines were precisely defined. One hundred twenty five examinations were performed on 25 patients who underwent heart transplantation, in a prospective protocol for noninvasive diagnosis and follow-up of acute cardiac rejection.

The degree of aortic stenosis (AS) can be assessed noninvasively by Doppler -echocardiography. However,the high frequency (20 -60%) of concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD) necessitates invasive preoperative evaluation. This study was performed to evaluate dipyridamole -201thallium SPECT (dip-SPECT) for diagnosis of CAD in patients with severe AS. Patients and methods: 60 adults with AS, mean valve area 0.7 cm2,mean age 68 years. A visually assessed angiographic area reduction of at least 75% was considered significant CAD. The protocol for dip-SPECT was: 0.56mg dipyridamole/kg iv during 4-9 min, 2 min thereafter 74MBq 201thallium, 4 min later ll5mg theophyllamine. ECG and blood pressure was monitored. SPECT directly and 3-4 h later. Slices were visually assessed for the presence of reversible defects (revdefs). The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee. Results: 17 pats experienced chestpain, relieved by theophyllamine. No serious complications were seen. 24 of 27 patients with CAD had revdefs (sens 89%). Revdefs were present in 16 patients with absent or minor CAD (spec 52%). Conclusions: Visually assessed dip-SPECT is sensitive in assessing the presence of CAD in patients with severe AS. The low specificity may depend on the visual analysis,on imperfections in the reference method and on decreased coronary blood flow reserve in pats with AS. THALLIUM MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGING USING DOBUTAMINE; AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF STRESS Dobutamine is an inotrope which raises myocardial oxygen demand and increases coronary blood flow. Its 90 second half life, low arrhythimic potential and peripheral administration make it ideal for cardiac stress studies without the need for dynamic exercise. This study evaluates its use for thallium myocardial perfusion imaging. Twenty four patients with stable angina underwent thallium tomography. Dobutamine was infused in increments from 5 to 20ug/kg/minute or until the occurence of symptoms. Nine segments of myocardium were each graded for thallium uptake as normal, reduced or absent Reversible ischaemia was defined as improvement by at least one grade after redistribution. Coronary angiography showed that 21(88%) patients had coronary artery disease (3VD-6, 2VD-II, IVD-4) and of these, 20 had reversible thallium defects. The mean number of segments showing reversible ischaemia was 1.7, 4.3 and 5 for 1,2 and 3 vessel disease respectivily. The mean increase in double product was 34%, 57% 87% and 104% for 5, 10, 15 and 20~g/kg/minute respectively. No symptoms were experienced in four patients but the infusion was limited by chest pain in 19 and by nausea in one. Arrhythmias were seen in eight patients, extrasystoles (ventricular 6, atrial i), sinus pauses (i) and accelerated nodal rhythm (I), but none of these was haemodynamically significant. Non-cardiac side effects affected 18 patients, most commonly skin tingling(ll). Dobutamine is an effective, safe and well to-lerated~stressor.

The success of therapeutic embolization of systemic AVMs is usually evaluated clinically and angiographically, neither of which are quantitative. We describe a technique of assessment of blood flow through systemic AVMs pre-and post-embolization utilising the microsphere like properties of Xe-133. This inert gas, which is extracted by the lungs in a single pass, was injected as a bolus into the main artery supplying the territory of an AVM. Gas which bypassed peripheral tissues via the shunt was recorded as an early signal by a detector over the lung whilst the remaining gas appeared later due to normal slow transit through the peripheral tissues. Successful embolization was identifiable as a reduction of the amplitude of the early activity signal over the lung. The reduction was quantifiable by comparison of the signal with that produced by the same dose of intravenously injected Xe-133.",

MEASUREMENT OF BLOOD LEAKAGE TO THE SYSTEMIC CIRCUIT DURING REGIONAL CHEMOTHERAPY OF MALIGNANT MELANOMA. In order to avoid ccmplications during regional chemotherapy the measurement of blood leakage to the systemic circulation is very important. We tested two methods for intraoperative and postoperative measurement and three formulas for the calculation of such systemic leakage. In four patients participating in the present study the tumor was localised on the lower limb. Four divided dosages of melphalan were injected in time intervals of ten minutes into the extracorporal circuit. Ten minutes after in vivo labelling of red blood cells(RBC) with 150 MBq of Tc-99m and the administration of 300 KBq of 1-125 human serum albumin (HSA) the blood samples preceded every bolus and the last one was taken I0 minutes after the last administration of mel phal an. By the help of a mobile well counter w~ were able to measure the Tcactivity and to calculate the systemic leakage intraoperatively. So the operating team was able to regulate the blood flow in the perfusion circuit according to the actual test results. Several days after the perfusion an automatic gamma sample changer measured 1-125 activity. The systemic leakage was calculated for both Tc-and I-activities by three different fonTulas for each perfusion interval.

Mean LV ejection fraction increased by 6.4% and the time to peak filling rate decreased by 36.5 ms. After eight weeks of treatment the acute effects of nisoldipine were similar to the previous study. Nisoldipine therefore tends to improve both the diastolic and systolic function of the left ventricle. To determine the differences in global myocardial 201-T1 uptake and redistribution in left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in comparison to normal myocardium 2 groups of pts were investigated by means of 201-TI scintigraphy during submaximal exercise test. llpts of ist group had LVH due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with left ventricular myocardial mass index (LVMMI) more than 90 gm/m 2. 2nd group consisted of ii sugjects without LVH (LVIfMI less than 80gm/mn). The mean values differed signifacantly in two groups (121.5 \u2022 8.1 vs 59.4 \u2022 g/m Z, p<0.001). Precardial radioactivity (PRA) measured as a percent of injected isotope dose was significantly greater in LVH than in control group (9.5 \u2022 vs 6.2 + 1.3%, p<0.05). However the relative activity calculated as PRA/ myocardial mass ratio was lower in pts with LVH (0.045 \u2022 vs 0.0062 \u2022 0.003%/gm, p=0.05). We consider this phenomenon is caused by decrease relative per\u2022 s\u2022 (latter is characterized by PRA/mass ratio) is supported by a significantly lower isotope washout during 3h after 201-TI injection (34.6\u2022 vs 46.0\u2022 In control group, p<0.05). All mentioned above explains a bad correlation between LVMMI and PRA In HCM patients during exercise, whereas those parameters at rest correlated strongly (r=0.85 p<0.01) In 8 of these pts who underwent 201-TI scintigraphy as well at rest. A challenge in the all digital approach to acquisition, display, and processing of nuclear medicine images is the ability to generate hardcopy images for distribution to referring clinicians. While video format devices exist which can print images to x-ray film, this process is expensive and conflicts with a main reason for utilizing a digital approach. Standard 300 x 300 dot per inch (DPI) laser printers have been proposed as hardcopy devices, since images can be included with text reports, but resulting images lack the spatial and gray scale resolution of traditional analog film output.",

Excellent SPECT images of brain perfusion with Tc-99m HMPAO were obtained in three normal volunteers using a newly developed three-head rotating gamma camera SPECT system (Toshiba, GCA9300A) with high resolution (FWHM 7mm) and high sensitivity (30cps/KBq/ml for Tc-99m) equipped with fan-beam collimators made of tungsten. One GBq of Tc-99m HMPAO was intravenously injected. Acquisition of projection data was started from 5 min postinJection and lasted for 25-30 mln. Projection data were accum~llated in 256X256 format for 30 angles (4 ~ step, 120 ~ ) with 50 sec -I rain per angle for each detector. Transverse, coronal, and sagittal sectional HMPAO-SPECT images are closely correlated with corresponding brain magnetic resonance images of the same normal volunteers. The basal ganglia and thalamus were clearly delineated in details. The activities of head of caudate nucleus, putamen, and insula, were separately visualized from one another. Moreover very fine details of functional brain anatomy was obtained in such as pituitary gland, pulvinar of thalamus, dentate nucleus of cerebellum, red nucleus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and cortical Eyruses that have never seen before. These SPECT images should be clinically effective in the evaluation of anatomo-functional correlation in various neurologic disorders. In conclusion this new SPECT system should serve as high resolution brain perfusion imaging in addition to offering anatomic information for identification of perfusion abnormality. We used high spatial resolution PET in order to evaluate the cerebral metabolic aspects of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in early phase. Nine patients with probable AD (according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria) of recent onset (less than two years) underwent a quantitative 18F-FDG study with ECAT 931/04-12 (CPS-Siemens, Knoxville, Tenn, USA) tomograph. All patients had also MRI and extensive neuropsychological examination. The following metabolic patterns where observed: a) \"typical\" bilateral temporoparietal reduction in 5 out 9 cases (F/P and F/T ratios = 1,32 + 0,09 and 1,19 + 0,12 respectively); b) hemispheric asymmetry in2 patients with lateralized cognitive deficits (R/L ranging from -12% to +27%); c) extensive cerebral impairment with also marked frontal involvement in two cases. A subcortical involvement was also showed in 3 patients with thalamic and basal ganglia asymmetry ranging from-13% to + 21%. A crossed cerebellar diaschisis was present in 4 cases ( R/L cerebellar hemispheric asymmetry range:-18% to +8,1%)and this was not associated with cerebellar symptoms. In conclusions \"typical\" and \"atypical\" cortical metabolic patterns are present in early AD as well as subcortical and cerebellar involvement. These PET findings can be related to different clinical subtypes of the disease. ",

A bilateral reduction of metabolism in the frontal and temporal Iobes was a common finding (13/15 and 7/15 respectively), as well as sensorimotor (9/15), thalamic (5/1 5) and cerebellar (1 2/1 5) hypometabolism. The following clinical/metabolic correlations were found: a) patients with severe neurological impairment (EDDS>4) had the most extensive cerebral hypometabolism; b) in most patients neuropsychological tests showed cognitive impairment which could be functionally related to local hypometabolism; c) in 4 patients with lateralized neuropsychological deficits cortical and/or subcortical metabolic asymmetry with 32% + 11 reduction in the functional related hemisphere was demonstrated. In multiple sclerosis, these PET metabolic findings might reflect a deactivation of cortical, subcortical and cerebellar areas induced by widespread white matter lesions. These distant effects might also explain the cognitive impairment demonstrated in most of the patients. PET with F-18-deoxyglucose (FDG) enables the quantification of the metabolic activity of tumors prior and during chemo-or radiation the rapy. The goal of this study is to use PET for evaluation of the changes in tumor FDG-uptake as response to the given therapeutic protocol and compare the chaoges in uptake to tumor volume. Each patient is studied prior to therapy with subsequent follow up starting after the second chemotherapeutic cycle. We performed endpoint measurements 50 rain post intravenous injection of 440 MBq FDG iv. and acquired 5 min transmission scans and 15 min emission scans. FDG uptake was quantified by the standardized uptake value (SUV) as determined by ROI measurements and normalized for injected dose and body volume. We studied 30 patients prior to therapy. 18 patients finished the follow up period, 14 receiving chemotherapy, 1 radiotherapy and 3 a combined protocol. All histologies were confirmed by either medianoscopy or biopsy. 12 patients carried small cell, 3 adeno, l squamous, 1 pleuramesothelioma and l metastases of a breast carcinom~L On the follow up studies 4 patient showed increased, 2 unchanged aml 12 decreased FDG uptake. We found a direct relation between decreased FDG uptake and clinical response (12/12) and unchanged or increased uptake with no response to therapy (6/6). The tumor volume decreased in 4 and remained unchanged in 2 cases of the 6 patients showing no decrease in FDG-uptake after therapy. The tumor volume remained unchanged in 4 and decreased in 8 of the 12 patients showing response aud decreased FDG-uptake after therapy. Our results indicate that the change of FDG uptake to therapy is more reliable and timely available than the evaluation by change in tumor volume. A ready selection of patients not benefiting from the given therapy (6/18) facilitates optimized therapy management. Fluorouraeil (FU) had found use for chemotherapy in metastatic co-Ioreetal carcinomas for more than thirty years. Since response to FU chemotherapy necessitates the accumulation of the cytostatic agent in the metastases, measurements of the FU metabolite concentrations should be performed prior to chemotherapy. While MR spectroscopy had been used for FU concentration measurements in the liver parenchyma, PET studies with F-18 labeled FU can be performed to quantify the metabolism of the cytostatic agent in the metastases. We used PET to evaluate the FU metabolite concentrations in 18 metastases prior to FU chemotherapy. CT preceeded each PET study in order to determine the target area and to calculate the tumor volume. All patients received FU chemotherapy after the PET study. Follow-up CT examinations were performed and the tumor volume was measured from the CT images. The tumor growth rate was calculated from the volumetric data and compared to the PET measurements of the FU metabolite concentrations prior to therapy. A linear correlation (r=0.8) was obtained for the standardized FU metabolite concentrations (SUV) and the growth rate. Cluster analysis demonstrated three groups: SUV <2.0 was correlated with increasing tumor volume; SUV 2.0-3.5 was associated with stable disease; SUV >3.5 was observed in lesions with decreasing volume. Our data demonstrate, that PET can be used to estimate tumor growth prior to FU chemotherapy and should find use for chemotherapy planning.

The evaluation includes 10 PET studies in 5 patients. CT examinations preeeeded PET in each patient to determine the target area. PET studies were performed with intravenously injected FOG (370-444 MBq), followed by sequential imaging for 60 minutes. Standardized uptake values (SUV) were calculated from the iteratively reeonstrueted cross sections using a ROItechnique. The FDG uptake in lymph node metastases was 2.1-13.1 SUV prior to therapy. Lower values were observed in bone metastases (1.3 SUV), while the FDG-uptake was 2.5-3.0 SUV in metastases of the adrenal gland. Comparable results were obtained m hver metastases (2.5-3.4 SUV). Follow-up studies after chemotherapy with fotemustin (200 mg, 30 min infusion ) showed a 3 % decrease in tumor metabolism 90 minutes after chemotherapy. The decrease in FOG uptake was 9 % and 26 % one and two days after therapy and remained constant for one week. The median decrease in FOG uptake following chemotherapy was 27.5 % Our results show, that PET with FDG can be used to quantify early chemotherapeutic effects on tumor metabolism. Furthermore, the duration of the eytostatic effect can be demonstrated by PET. Therefore, different chemotherapeutic protocols may be compared on the base of PET studies.

In this work the rectilinear scan procedure has been modified on a current generation PET scanner (Siemens 931/04-12), in order to compensate for radiation attenuation in the body and to correct for the radioactive decay during the acquisition time. Attenuation compensation consists in the following steps: 1) blank scan, B; 2) transmission rectilinear scan, T, of the object under study, before radioactivity administration; 3) calculation of a map of attenuation correction factors, F=B/T=exp(ux), u and x being the attenuation coefficient and the thickness of the object along the projection line respectively; 4) emission rectilinear scan, E, of the radioactive object, after radioactivity administration: attenuation correction is performed on line, by simple pixel by pixel multiplication E*--ExF. Compensation for the radioactive decay is achieved on a row by row basis, by knowledge of the acquisition (matrix filling) technique. Calculation of a cross-calibration factor allows the calculation of absolute radioactivity distribution. Experimental measurements on cylindrical phantoms, under different attenuation conditions, have been performed. Quantitative accuracy of the technique in the estimation of the activity present in the phantoms has been found to be within 6%.

Areas of high signal intensity on T2-WI were found in 19 of them; these changes could be interpreted as eye muscle edema. In 5 patients signal of presumably fibrotic eye muscles was low and T2-times below the normal range. On TI-WI fatty enclosures were found in eye mucles of 3 patients.

PCr and ATP regeneration seems possible even at low temperatures as 10~ and 25~ respectively. These findings could be important for clinical organ preservation, in that restoration of metabelism, at least partially, by a simple preoperative perfusion procedure could allow partial resuscitation of organ function before implantation. In addition, using P-31 NMR spectroscopy for on line monitoring of high energy phosphates might attow pretransplant pro spective discrimination of well recovering organs and organs compromised during storage. The aim of this study was to develop a system for recording F-19 images, spectra, and relaxation times with a standard H-1-tomography-birdcage-resonator with applications to organ models perfused with PFC emulsions. The developed simple hardware modification allows changing the spectrometer frequency from H-1 to F-19 resonance and vice versa without removing the object under investigation. This hydrogen/fluorine retuning tomography (HYFY) technique, developed on a 4.7 Tesla/40cm MR system, permits studies of identical slices or volume elements with H-1 as well as with F-19 resonance. In particular, it is possible to localize volume elements on the basis of multislice proton images and to investigate these volume elements with fluorine magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The pulse sequences including localized and spectroscopically resolved determination of spin-lattice and transverse relaxation times have been developed. Application of these techniques to phantom samples, pig kidney and pig heart perfusion models which have been perfused with PFC emulsions allowedF-19 imaging with a 256 matrix, 1 cm slice thickness and good image quality in 40 min, comparable to proton imaging in 4 min. F-19 spinlattice (T0 and transverse (T2) relaxation measurements are possible within less than 10 minutes. This might allow indirect measurements of 02 concentrations and O2 consumption in tissue perfused with PFC-O2 solutions as blood substitutes, since different saturation of PFC with 02 causes different T1-and T2-relaxation times of fluorine. In conclusion, the HYFY technique with a standard proton resonator pemaits the simultaneous record of H-1 and F-19 images, F-19 spectra, and F-19 relaxation times in mammalian organs within reasonable time. The technique described is easily transferable to whole body magnet systems. In this study, a simple liver perfusion model is presented useful for a large variety of metabolic experiments applying a 4.7 Tesla/40 cm NMR spec~xoscopy system. 32 pig livers harvested 10 min post mortem in the slaughterhouse were studied with 5 different perfusion protocols to evaluate and define conditions for optimum liver preservation: (1) In conclusion, an easy, non-expensive liver perfusion model using livers from slaughterhouse pigs together with P-31 MRS is feasible, allowing successful liver preservation for up to 24 hrs. The proposed perfusion model meets the needs of large scale experimental protocols, and may thus decrease the need for animal sacrifice in medical liver research.

An injection of a trace amount of Cll labeled CGP 12177 (dose D~), an antagonist of the adrenergic receptor, was followed 40 rain later by a simultaneous injection of Cll-CGP (dose D~) and of CGP (dose D1). Shortly after the two injections, the myocardial PET curve presents two plateaux at the concentrations C~ and C~ respectively which can be graphically measured. A additional injection of an excess of unlabeled CGP was administred at the 90 th min in order to estimate the dissociation constant.",

The rationale of the new procedure was to use a monoclonal anti-granulocyte antibody (AGAb), which accumulates in florid granulocyte infections but also cross-reacts with normal bone marrow, and nanocolloid (NC) as a bone marrow tracer to overcome this cross-reactivity by subtraction Phantom studies (water phantom with Tc-99m sources of various activities simulating inflammatory lesions~background~ bone marrow/blood vessels) revealed a minimal count rate of 1000 net counts (= remaining counts after subtraction) per lesion for reliable count statistics. In order to obtain these counts rates in patients, minimal activities of 740 MBq for AGAb and 370 MBq for NC are required.-In all patients, dynamic flow studies, early (2 min p i ) and late (4, 24 hr p.i.) static images were obtained following i.v. injection of 740 MBq Tc-99m monoclonal anti-NCA 95 AGAb. After the 24 hr image, 370 MBq Tc-gSm NC were injected without moving the patient and dynamic flow study as well as early (2 min p.i.) and late (30 min p.i.) static images were obtained Subtraction procedure was performed with the 24 hr AGAb image and the 30 min NC image Normalization of both images was done by using a region of interest over the sacroiliac area as reference for normal bone marrow and calculating a multiplication factor for each image in order to get equal count rates in the reference region. The normalized NC image was then subtracted from the normalized AGAb image Persisiting activity on the subtraction image is read \"positive\" for a florid granulocytic infection For the \"reverse subtraction\", normalization was done the same way, but AGAb image was subtracted from NC image Persisting activity on the \"reverse subtraction\" image was interpreted as sign of a local macrophage process or specific inflammation.",

Six healthy persons were controls.l.-The NG feeding was suspended and the tube was cleaned with 50ml of water. 2.-To avoid contamination of the esophagus a small rathe terwas introduced into the NG tube.3.-18,SBq of 99mTc Sulfur Colloid was administered into the stomach through the eatheter.4.-The catheter and the NG tube were cleaned with water and ausence of contamination was checked with the gammacamera.5.-Patients were placed under the gammacamera after remainig 2 hours in the same position. The evaluationof the radionuclide results was done without knowledge of the patients' position.RESULTS:GER was present in 37 out of 50 MV patients(74%).In the upright position GER was detected in 16 out of 24 patients(67~), and in the supine position 21 out of 26 patients(81%). GER up to oropharinx was presented in 16 out ~f 26 with MV(61%) and in 21 out of 24 with SB(87%).(chi~=4.37,and P=O.O4).GEF was not detected in healthy volunteers. CONCLUSIONS:The radioisotope technique shows the elevated incidence of GEF in patients with NG and OT tubes. The GEF is more demonstrative in patients in supine position and with spontaneously breathing and elevation of the head of the bed does not seem to prevent the GER and aspiration of gastric contents. Quautitative evaluation of regional myocardial hypoperfusion from thallium 201 SPECT images reqmres comparison with data obtainedTrom a reference population of healthy individuals; which in turn implies standardization of sampling from myocardial segments, display, and quantitation. The \"bullseye\" is a multislice diagram representation (MSD) of the tomogram displayed in a polar fashion, with the apex of the heart appearing in the central part and the base in the outer part of the image. It has.gained some pooularity because it is a very convenient way to visuahze the abnormal areas in a single image. However, a direct quantitation of this representation win be inaccurate, due to an increasing contribution of the tomographic slices when going from the apex towards the base of the heart. Therefore, some normalization is necessary. We apply to each pixel which is identified as corresponding to an ischem]c area a coefficient inverselyproportional to the area of the ring containing this pixel. A second normalization of each slice allows to obtain a lesser contribution of the slices presumably containing thinner (basal) or narrower (apical) myocardial sections. Thereby, each pixel in the MSD image will represent the same elementary myocardial volume. The processing includes the followin~ steps: -6 short-axis slices are reconstructed extending from the apex to the base of the left ventricular myocardium. -A MSD representation is created frqm the angular profile of the maximum ELxel value m each slice. -A mapping of the ischemic zones is then obtained by comparing this short axis MSD with a data base of normal subiects (male or female). The zone of ischemia is represented by the pixels with a value below 3 standard deviations from its average in normals. -The first and last slices are assumed to represent 10 percent of the left ventricular myocardium, and all other four slices to represent 20 rcen t each. e extent of ischemia is expressed as the percentage of the left ventricular myocardial volume. Results are nearly operator independent because variability in the processing resumes in reonentation of the heart and in definition of reconstruction limits. The creation of the MSD image and all following steps require no further operator intervention. Original PACS are still cost intensive and dedicated for imaging devices, leaving nuclear medicine laboratory problems aside. We therefore developed a low cost computersystem to unite the organization of all working facilities in the department. Hardware: INTEL 80386 32bit processor, 380 MB hard disk, 12 MB storage capacity, streamer tape, 2x0.8 GB optical disc, 10 intelligent terminals, 2 matrix and 3 laser printers. Software: Specially disigned multi-user-multi-task system, using UNIX and INFORMIX as the basic software. On-line connection of 4 gamma-cameras and 2 RIA-processors and 2 PC's (terminal emulation). Results: The essentials of our system philosophy are: i.) Central data administration but decentralized on-line data aquisition and processing. 2.) Optimal use of peripheral and central hard-and software to save dual investment. 3.) All informations irrespectively from which procedure (imaging or lab) and from which time (follow-up) are attached to the same patient data file. 4.) Patient data files are transfered to the computer of the imaging devices together with the investigation request to assure data identity. 5.)

            "text": "The system is able to meet the growing demands in cost e~fective data administration, handling, scientific questions and reducing archiving problems. An original program for MS-PC/DOS compatible microcomputers was developed for storing and reporting myocardial SPECT examinations. The core of the system is a data-form, actually handled as a bidimensional relational table, capable of managing 2x10 = examinations. SPECT data are relationally linked to patients' demographic data and clinical history information. To mantain data consistency each field (except patient's name) is predefined as a multiple choice field whose possible values are displayed in a pop-up window. An up to three levels deep context-sensitive on-line help is available. The schematics of the data system allowed to overlay a voice recognition program whose input comes, through a digital conversion board, from a microphone. The system has been trained for the possible different commands and verbal expressions; moreover the system is speaker dependent, thus adding a further layer of data-security to the password oriented log-in procedure: up to 200 nested operator-dependent command menues can be programmed in the voice command file. The SPECT data system analyses the myocardial perfusion patterns for rest and stress scans in the different segments of left ventricle that are then defined according to SPECT criteria as normal, ischaemic and necrotic. Final comments are automatically generated and can be printed out togheter with a schematic high quality plot of segmental left ventricular features. Remote image transmission will facilitate numerous applications such as distant interpretation, multicentric studies, comparison of images from different modalities or archiving. This task in Nuclear Medicine must satisfy the transmission of an amount of data in the range of I to 20 millions of bits with full security in a time of a few minutes to be acceptable in routine use. Conventional solutions are either too slow with telephone based system (2 to 35 minutes by modem at the rate of 9600 bits per second (bps)) or too expensive with specialized links. We used the new French public Integrated Services Digital Network RNIS which offers a fully secure transmission of data at the rate of 64000 bps over normal telephone lines at approximatively twice the price of a phone call, and an easy acoes through personal computers. Our local Nuclear Medicine network (ADAC lab.) consisting in several dedicated systems, personal computers, and an image digitizing system was connected to a remote rewiew site over i000 km away. Several 512 X 512 pixels -256 gray levels images of whole body scans and digitized MRI were accurately transmitted in an average time of 35 seconds each. RNIS incorporate simultaneous and bidirectional transmission of voice, text and images. Its future developments will include fastest rate (2 millions of bps and international connexions to equivalent networks). The intrinsic uniformity test, must be, ideally, performed using a point source; such geometry is difficult to obtain in practice. Aim of our work is to evaluate the importance of the variation of the uniformity index due to the size, form and position of a true radioactive source. A FORTRAN program which tests the geometrical influence of 3 different types (point, cylinder, cone) of source, positioned at different distances from scintillation camera and from the detector axis was implemented. The first step is the random choice of the photon start point inside the source volume. Then the program draws the direction of the photon and a check is performed: if the photon is directed on the detector the corresponding element of a 64x64 matrix is incremented, if the photon goes out a new photon is considered until 10 Mcount are stored in the matrix, Using this output the UFOV and CFOV integral and differential uniformity (I.U.,D.U.) are computed according to the NEMA protocol. The results obtained in this way only depend on statistical fluctuations and geometry. The validity of the program has been tested using a point source geometry positioned on the detector axis at a distance of 5 UFOV. Theoretically the UFOV I.U.",

Follow-up of patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors after primary treatment with surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy is often complicated by the appearance of suspected tumor and/or necrosis on computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We report experience with four such patients studied by positron emission tomography (PET), with pathologic correlation. Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET was performed under a research protocol approved by our Institutional Review Board. Patients were referred by neuro-oncologists and signed an informed consent. Five to i0 mCi of FDG was given intravenously. PET was performed with three consecutive sets of trans-axial images, which were visually inspected and correlated with CT and/or MRI. One patient with suspected recurrence of glioblastoma multiforme (GM) had a focal area of increased uptake. Resection revealed gliosis and abnormal cells, but no recurrent tumor. Another GM, an anaplastic mixed glioma (AMG), and a chondroblastic osteogenic sarcoma (COS) suspected of tumor or necrosis all.showed decreased uptake. Re-operation of the GM and AMG revealed anaplastic residual or recurrent tumor and necrosis. the COS showed inflammatory tissue and no tumor or necrosis. In using PET-FDG in follow-up of brain tumor patients following irradiation and chemotherapy, the differentiation of residual or recurrent tumor from gliosis and necrosis may be difficult, as illustrated by three of these cases. The presence of inflammatory tissue in one case was associated with decreased EDG uptake. The aim of this prospective study was to examine the value of thallium SPECT of braintumors for differential diagnosis and followup. We examined 27 patients with histologicaly proven primary brain tumors (astrocytomas I-II:5; astrocytomas III-IV:I5; oligodendrogliomas: 5 meningeomas:",

Occasionally observed discrepancies between SPECT-images obtained after 99mTc-HMPAO (555 MBq) and 123 I-IMP (185 MBq) started a series of double tracer stud\u2022 after application of tracer amounts as described above with a single head ZLC-Digitrac-3700-0rbiter-camera using a microdelta software version and using identical image reconstruction programs. Time interval between both studies was 7 days (median). Data showed in 12/22 patients intensive \"cold\" spots after HMPAO while only 8/22 patients showed intensive defects with IMP. In 5/22 patients defects after HMPAO and IMP were similar, in 10/22 patients the intensity of defects was different with both tracers and in 7/22 cases localization of defects was not is tical. Overall almost all patients showed abnormal uptake. Only I patient had an abnormal CT/ NMR, SPECT-patterns did not correlate with clinical staging of AIDSE. These data seem to confirm that the HIV primarily attacks endothelial cells in the brain, thereby primarily and initially reducing rCBF. Brain-SPECT with 99mTc-HMPAO seems therefore adequate to demonstrate AIDSE even in cases with normal CT/NMR. hiteratuqe: (I) Pohl ~ et al.

In 3 s u~ects, 1 mg cold flumazenil was injected 120 rain p.i. The influence of sensory stimulation on the redistribution of deposited 123I labeled N-isopropyl iodoamphetamine (IMP) in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), studies was investigated in normal control subjects without history of head trauma or other cerebral pathology. Rotating camera SPECT rCBF imaging was performed on 5 subjects at -30 min, 3 hr and 4 hr post tracer administration. Measurements were repeated at 7 days in each subject with exposure to strobe light stimulation (ll flashes/see, i x 106 candela) for i0 min, 15 min prior to the 3 hr SPECT procedure. Redistribution and clearance of IMP were examined using ROI techniques on two pixels thick (10.6 mm) slices from each set of SPECT images. ROIs were defined for the vascular territories of the anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries, prefrontal cortex, primary visual cortex (PVC), cerebellum, basal ganglia, and thalamus. The results showed that a i0 min strobe light stimulation at 165 min post IMP administration has no significant \"effect on redistribution or clearance of IMP in major structures of the brain (e.g. 4 hr washout in PVC: n=5, eontrols -23%, strobe -20.6%). Major differences in activity distribution and clearance was seen among subjects, however, the delayed visual stimulation did not significantly influence IMP distribution or clearance compared with that obtained for subjects maintained in quiet and low light ambient room Today,ECT is a rarely used method of treatment in psychiatric disorders because it is found to be non-humane and the principle effective mechanism is still unknown.But in some cases where medical and rehabilitative treatment methods fail and especially in patients who has an inclination to commit suieide,ECT is tried as a last chance.",

Of I./Q~Ij[ and .75~ respectively, Despite effective antibiotic therapy mortality from bacterial meningitis is still high because it is often complicated by brain edema, increase of intracranial pressure or vasculitis. As these mechanisms may influence brain perfusion, the present study was designed to investigate patients with acute bacterial meningitis by HMPAO-SPECT. Up to now 14 patients (age: 15-69 years, median: 31years) with meningitis were investigated by HMPAO-SPECT. For correlation neurological examination and CT was performed in all patients, cerebral angiography in 8. In addition to baseline SPECT in the acute stage of disease one or more follow-up studies were available from 8 patients. 13/14 patients had pathologic SPECT findings, showing focal or multilocular uptake defects. 7 patients had severe focal CNS-disorders (6x hemiparesis, Ix ataxia) with SPECT-results excellently correlating to the neurological findings. CT-scans and angiography detected corresponding findings only in one case each. Follow-up studies with HMPAO up to 10 months after the acute disease showed a significant improvement of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in 5 and normalization in 3/8 patients investigated. Alterations in rCBF are a common finding in acute bacterial meningitis and may represent the functional effect of brain edema, increase of intracranial pressure and/or vasculitis. In contrast to morphological findings obtained by CT or angiography, SPECT-results could well explain focal CNS-disorders occuring in some of the cases. As indicated by follow-up studies changes in brain perfusion were reversible or improved in most cases. Thus, HMPAO-SPECT may be a promising approach to pathophysiological mechanisms participating in acute bacterial meningitis. The prognostic value, however, has to be further established yet. The contribution of Tc-99m HVIPAO to evaluating the regional distribution of CBF is established yet clinical decision making usually depends on the global CBF, eg less than 600 ml/min indicates danger in operating on subarachnoid haemorrhage, SAH (Mahmoud et al, Nucl Med Corrrnun 1987; 8: 239) . The global cerebral clearance in ml/min of I-lV~AO is given by the difference between total supplied and the CBF as measured by a non diffusible tracer Tc-99m albumin. Deconvolution analysis of the input function from a probe over the aortic input with the content curves from regions of interest from a camera over the vertex gives the impulse retention function, IRF, for each asent studied serially in the same patient.",

ASPECT STUDY WITH Tc-99m -~ PAO Only a few date have been reported proving the action of antiepileptie drugs on rCBF in partial epilepsy and these refer to patients studied by an intravenous Xenon 183 technique. To further investigate this problem, we studied 7 adult epileptic patients with partial seizures, in interictal state. EEG focus was demonstrated in all cases while CT and neurological ex6minations were normal; r0BF was studied, with patients rest~, by SPEOT after i.v. injection of 25-30 mCi of Tc-99m-H M PAO, using a semiquantitative regional analysis (sequential ROI and eirom~erential profile) -SPECT was performed twice for basal data before any treatnent and it was repeated SO, 60 and 90 deys on CBZ (6/33 to 800 mg q.d.). None of the patients were receiving other drugs. Basal SPECT showed a focal decrease of rCBF in left fronto-te~ and parieto-temparal regions in all patients; moreover, in 3 instances a controlateral parieto-temporal hypoperfusion was also present. Thirty days after basal tests, while the patients were on CBZ, with drug sertm levels between 6.2 -7.9 ng/ml, SPECf showed non si~/ficant variation in rdgF within epileptic loci, when compared to basal data; in all the other epparently uninjured cortical areas, a significant increase in ~CBF was fotmd, with mean values of i0.0!_7.~/o (p~O.05). This increase was evident, with slight chan~es, ~4nen SPECT was repeated at 60 and 90 days. Moreover, in 3 patients with basal hypoperfusion only in the left fronto-te~oorel regions, a crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) was observed after one month on CBZ and also in the following SPECT. Our data seem to demonstrate that CBZ has a negligible effect an in the site of epileptic focus, while it could determine rCBF increase in uninjured regions even a distance from the focus. Fmr~over, we observed for the first time, to our knewledge, CCD in 3 Cf brain negative patients on CBZ, su~zasting a depressive CBZ effect on cortico-fronto-dentats-thal~mo pathway. Farther studies are needed to confirm these interpretations. is partly due to cerebral atrophy.

These patients were also investigated with 99mTc-HM-PAO. A rotating gamma camera ZLC 7500 (Digitrac) fy Siemens with high sensitivity low energy collimator was used for imaging. During one 360 ~ rotation 64 frames were acquired by 20 sec. for one frame. 32 transversal slices were reconstructed. No attenuating correction was performed. A percentual comparison between contralateral hemispheres was done. The analysis of the interictal Tc-HMPAO investigation revealed in ]6 cases (80%) pathologhical results (decrease of activity uptake). Conclusion: According to the literature the comparison with EEG respectively CT examination shows closely correlation to KEG results and better diagnostic statement compared to CT. The results of the study shows, that this method is suitable for revealing of epileptic foci, localized in one side of the brain. Quantitative three-phase scintigraphy of the hands was carried out in 32 patients in different stages of algodystrophy and in a control-group of 20 normal subjects. Twelve patients were investigated before and after surgical treatment. Serial images were acquired over both hands every 4 sec for I min and static blood-pool images 5-10 m_in after venous injection of 370-555 MBq 99mTc-MDP. The late metabolic bone scintigraphy was carried out 3 hours later. The following indices were calculated : perfusion-index (Perln), bloodpool-index (BPIn), metabolic-index (MetIn) and perfusion/metabolic ratio (P~I). Characteristic for the algodystrophy were the perfusions and the blood-pool disturbances, combined with increased metabolism of the wristbones.

We concluded that the incidence of DS is greater in breast cancer pts than in pts with other malignancies(p <O.05).Since in a follow-up of 9.2 months 35.7% of the pts developed bone metastasis,we can regard DS as an early indicator of secondary bone deposits. So far, we have not been able to find a physiopathological explanation for the appearance of diffuse skull activity in bone scintigraphy. 99mTc-cc-D-Glucose 1-phosphate (GP) was introduced by our group for the detection of lung carcinoma. It was shown that 99mTc-GP did not accumulate in normal bone. In the present study 99mTc-GP uptake of tumoral bone was investigated in 24 patients (10 F, 14 M, age range:8-74, mean:31) with known bone tumors (14 malign, 10 benign) after getting their informed consent. Each patient was intravenously administered with 20 mCi (740 MBq) 99mTc-GP. Images were taken at 3 h post-injection (Siemens ZLC-75, Scintiview II). Three-phase 99mTc-MDP bone scan was obtained 4 days later. The tumor/normal tissue ratios (T/N) were calculated for both agents. All bone tumors imaged with 99mTc-MDP were also visualized by 99mTc-GP. Normal bone did not accumulate 99mTc-GP in either of 24 patients studied. In 28 abnormal sites T/N ratios were 2.91+1.61 and 5.25+2.93 for 99mTc-$P and 99mTc-MDP, respectively. It was concluded that although mean T/N ratio of 99mTc-GP was lower than 99mTc-MDP, its selective accumulation in pathological bone was a superiority compared to 99mTc-MDP, highlighting the abnormalities, particularly in equivocal cases. GP labelled with a suitable radioisotope may also be used for treatment. Conventional and LauensteIn X-Rays of the Idp as well as 3phase BSC and MRI with T 1-and T2-weighted coronal images were acquired in all patients.

Recently the software for 3-D-reconstruction of the acquired data from an 360 ~ rotating camera has become available. Ten patients with hip head necrosis were examined pre-and postoperatively performing 99mTc-DPD-SPECT to evaluate the viability of the hip head before and after treatment with a pedicled pelvic bone graft. One week before, one week and twelve weeks after surgery clinical features were compared with the results of conventional X-ray-examinations, superselective angiography and scintillationstudies (as described below). After intmvenoils administration of 99mTc-DPD the following parameters were acquired : 1. Imaging of the soft-tissue-and boneperfusion, from anterior,0-120 sec.p.i.(1 frame4sec,matrix 1282 pixel). 2. Bloodpool-imaging, from anterior,10 min.pi.(500 kilocounts, matrix 2562 pixel). 3. Static planar views from anterior, 3h.p.i. (500 kilocounts, matrix 2562 pixel). 4. SPECT, 3.5h.p.i. (malrix 642 pixel,Hanning-filter [resolution recovery = 0, cut off frequency=l]). Data obtained from SPECT were then reconstructed in a 3-dimensional fashion. Subsequently a quantitative analysis by ROI's was done. On planar scans the highest accumulation of the tracer has been found in the affected hip head one week after surgery and lowest twelve weeks thereafter. In detecting the extend of osseous hypermetabolism SPECT clearly proved to be superior to planar views. The postoperative follow-up of patients with hip head necrosis treated with a pedicled pelvic bone graft can be accomplished by different scintigraphic and radiologic techniques. Only SPECT and planar scintigraphy allow quantitative analysis of the regional metabolism of the bone. By the ROItechnique changes of the viability of the revitalized hip head can be detected earlier than by conventional radiographs and less isvasively than by superselective angiography. 3-D-display simplifies image interpretation and renders better topographic information than does diplay of single slices or planar views.

Troubles in femoral neck measurements are numerous : failure in positioning patients in a reproducible way, difficulties in designing ROI, variations of thickness and of fat/water content of soft tissues surrounding femoral neck. To appreciate the importance of the later, we used concurrently two different approaches 9 1. DPA was modified to determine fat/water content when scanning over soft tissues while data necessary to bone mineral content measurements were accluired when scanning over bone ; 2.

In consequence to a previous double blind study (Buchali st ai.1988) we studied the influence of therapy with a new protocol using different amounts of 89-St adapted to mass of metastases (3 injections, 75 to 150 MBq each). In 56% of 42 pats. pain relief is achieved, with no differnece to former placebo group. Regredient or stable skeletal scintigrams were found in 82%. Survival with median value 8.5 months also is not different from placebo group (p~.05). Grading and duration of disease proved as influencing covariates of survival (p= .085 and .028 resp.). Compared to previous reported groups, an increased number of low or undifferentiated cancers is revealed. Survival of these patients shows a tendency to increase survival, but without statistical proof due to low numbers. Haematological complications were found in 41%. An increase of pain relief or survival due to increased amounts of 89-Sr cannot be demonstrated. We recently showed (S. K. Shukla, et el., 1989 ) that spontaneous mammary tumours, Balbcf/C3H and Balbcf/CRIII, in mice have high affinity for chromatographically and electrophoretically pure anionic Ga-67, with which a clean seintigraphic image of the tumour can be obtained within 4 h p.i. The radionuclide is firmly bound to the tumour to allow its follow-up studies for 9 days. Since yttrium-90, like Ga-67, is trivalent we obtained it in anionic form in presence of sodium citrate, which was chromatographically and electrophoretically identical to mammary tumour-specific Ga-67 in solution. With this Y-90 solution at the dose of 20 MBq/Kg we cured spontaneous mammary tumours in mice without any side effect (S.K.Shukla et al., 1989) . In the present work we have extended our studies on the mammary tumour therapy with Y-90 to spontnaeous mammary tumours in dogs. Pure anionic Y-90 was injected i.v. at the dose o~f 20 MBq/Kg three times at the interval of 3 days. Within 15 days the tumour disappeared. The dog is tumour-free for 3 months. No side effect of the therapy was observed. Other dogs treated similarly are under study.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the relation between the FDG uptake and the proliferation rate in patients. We examined 8 patients with histologically proven head and neck cancer using 444 MBq FDG. Perfusion studies with O-15 labelled water (3000-3700 MBq) were performed in 6 patients. Immediately after the PET examination a biopsy was performed from the target region. The cell eyele fractions were determined by onedimensional flow cytometry (DAP1 staining). We found that the FDG accumulation was increased in all eases (250%-500% relative to normal soft tissue). Perfusion values were also raised. The flow eytometric analysis revealed an increased percentage of S-phase and G2/M-phase cells (15-27% S+G2/M cells). The proliferation rate and the FDG uptake were nonlinearly correlated. These results show that PET with FDG can be used to estimate the tumors tendency to grow. Furthermore, besides the proliferation rate other parameters (e.g. tumor cell fraction, G0/Gl-phase cells) determine the FDG uptake in tumors. ",

The CVs for MKTT and MPTT were about 1% for normal kidneys and 4% for poorly functioning kidneys. The aim of this study was to evaluate Tc-99m-Aprotinin (A) renal scintigraphy and to compare with Tc-99m-DMSA (DMSA). 23 patients (serum creatinine 0.8-11.0 mg/dl) were studied,14 with both tracers.Estimation of kidney uptake and other simple quantitative indices was obtained from the 6 h image, i) There was a significant correlation (p<O.O01) between DMSA and A renal uptakes (r=+0.78). Individual uptake values differed for the two tracers (SED =\u2022 showed a strong correlation between the two tracers (r=+0.81 p<O.O01), and was lower about 50% for A. 2) (A) and DMSA uptake showed a positive linear correlation with inverse of creatinine(Cr) levels and with inverse of urea (U) levels. The correlation was stronger for A than for DMSA (r=+0.93 VS+0.63 for Cr and r=+0.81 VS+0.43 for U). The Bkg/pixel both for A and DMSA showed a highly significant positive linear correlation with Cr levels (r=+0.94 and r=+0.77). 3) Two experienced observers were asked to compare the scintigrams for each kidney of the 14 patients,without previous knowledge of the tracer used. The quality was judged identical in 7 left and 8 right kidneys. 4 L and 3 R kidney scintigrams were judged definitely superior with (A) while i R kidney slightly better with DMSA. These differences were statistically significant (SIGN TEST:X2=5.1 p<O.03). Conclusions: Renal scintigraphy with A is comparable and occasionally superior (in patients with renal insufficiency) than that with DMSA.Quantitative indices of renal uptake show that this superiority is due to reduced background.These indices show higher correlation with serum Cr in the case of (A) than DMSA. While the feasibility of 99mTc-MAG3 as tracer for clearance measurement is under discussion, an agreement about the best clearance-technique and its standardization has not been reached yet. Therefore, with the established tracer J131-hippurane the influence of instrumentation, algorithm, and the time point of the blood sampling on whole body renal clearance was investigated. The study included simultaneous sampling with a partially shielded whole-body counter (WBC) and a gamma camera to assess effective renal plasma flow (ERPF). The results obtained using two different analysis algorithms for each modality are compared. Although ERPF as determined by the Oberhausentechnique was significantly higher (p<O.O01) than that obtained using an own algorithm based on the 2-compartment-model, for each algorithm there was no significant difference between the WBC and gamma camera derived values in the range of 100 to 800 ml/min. Furthermore, positioning of the ROI was not critical for gamma camera derived ERPF (SD<1% for multiple cresentic ROls and appr. 4% for multiple rectangular ROls). However, the time of blood sampling did appear more important since the average ERPF from the 10-and 20minute-samples differed significantly (p<O.O01) from the 15-and 25-minute-samples for both algorithms. The methodology which we have validated provides a more precise tool for further investigations of the influence of medication, posture, and exercise stress on kidney function and also the assessment of other tracers as clearance substances.",

            "text": "The vascular stenosis may represent a physiological sphincter. Although Tc-99m MAG3 renography is less sensitive to background than Tc-99m DTPA renograptiy due to a higher target/noise ratio background and attenuation remain the two main problems in renal function determination with a scintillation camera. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of background subtraction on the accuracy of left and right fractional renal function (FRF) calculated from MAG3 renography. FRF calculated from SPECT with Tc-g9m DMSA was considered as the reference standard since after reconstruction background in the kidneys areas is negligible and attenuation maybe considered equal in both kidneys and-tHerefore does not affect FRF. Fourteen successive patients referred for evaluation of FRF underwent a DMSA planar and tomographic study and next a MAG3 renography 48 hours apart. Absolute creatinine clearances ranged from 35 to 196 ml per minute and left DMSA FRF ranged from 17% to 65%, average 49% Left FRF was calculated from 1) two-to-three minutes MAG3 built-up image 2) MAG3 renal distribution volumes curves 3) posterior DMSA planar image and 4) DMSA tomographic images. The first three methods were compared with method-4. The average background in each kidney area (methods 1-3) was assumed to equal that :n a ROt surrounding the kidney. Attenuation was calculated from renal depth based on the height and weight of the patient according to Tnnesen's formula andTrom the measured attenuation coefficient of Tc-99m in plexiglas medium. To keep the total chance of making a Iy.pe 1 error below 5 percent, statistical analysis used Bonferonni paired t test following repeated analysis of variance. Results show a significant overestimation of left FRF compared with the reference in method 1 (4.9%) and in method 2 (3.8%) while the difference is still positive (2.5%) yet not significantly in method 3. We conclude that the background subtraction procedure using a perirenal area leads to an overestimation of the left FRF. This effect might be caused by an average background in the right perirenal area in excess over its corresponding renal area. \"The smaller difference in method 2 and 3 may be explained by the fact that method 2 is independent of the vascular component of the background, while in method 3 the total background is generally rather tow. Epithelial clearance of aerosolised 99m Tc-DTPA is commonly measured over the lungs by the ROI technique. The disappearance rate of the radioactivity is thought to give a measure of the rate at which small molecules leak from the lung into circulating blood. Factor analysis provides factor images and time-activity curves of principal components corresponding to underlying specific structures, even if they overlap. When applied to dynamic inhalation studies (n=16), factor analysis in all instances extracted two simultaneously operating factors with different temporal behavior, one with rapidly decreasing kinetics corresponding to epithelial transport and one with horizontal or slightly increasing kinetics corresponding to mucociliary transport. In nearly all cases, factor images demonstrated overlap of both factors, even in the lung periphery. Clearance rates measured by the ROI technique did not differ from those calculated from the sum of both fectors plus the factor background (median: 1.35 vs 1.25 %/min, n.s.), but clearance rates of the factor related to epithelial transport were significantly fester than those measured by the ROI technique (median: 2.2 vs 1.35 %/min, p~0.001), strongly indicating interference of other clearance mechanisms with the latter. 183 MBq of 133Xe was administered for both perfl~ion and ventilation.

According to x-ray e~amination patients were divided in 4 groups: 0-wihout changes (5pts.), I-hilar node involvement (6pts.), II-hilar and parenchymal involvement (14pts.), IiI interstitial reduction (10pts.). In order to determine activity of lung sarcoidosis we performed quantitative Ga-67 scan, functional lung tests, determined ACE in all patients and in 7 patients BAL was performed. In our group 42% of patients had abnormal lung tests, 34% elevated ACE and 74% had positive Ga-67 scan. In 2 out of 7 patients BAL was positive and in 4 out of same patients Ga-67 scan was positive. Our results showed that quantitative Ga-67 scan is the most sensitive method in detection of lung sarcoidosis activity expecially in x-ray stage \"0\" and \"I\".

In the past decade several techniques have been developed for protein radioiodination, each giving different results and having different indications. The labelling technique can damage the proteins but, an effect can also be attributed to the isotope. 125-Iodine is commonly used for iodination of proteins for in vitro studies, whereas, 123-Iodine is the isotope of choice for in vivo studies. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects, on proteins, of different labelling procedures and different iodine isotopes. We labelled human Insulin (INS, molecular weight 5800), human Interleukin-2 (IL2, molecular weight 15500) and human Growth hormone (GH, molecular weight 21500) using the following methods: Chloramine T, Lactoperoxidase/H202, Lactoperoxidase/Glucose oxidase (LPO/GOD) and Iodogen. We tested either 125-1 (IMS-30, Amersham) and two different types of 123-1 (Medgenix): Lab-W in water solution at pH 7 and Lab-B in 0.01M NaOH at pH 12. Labelled proteins were purified by HPLC and immunoreactivity tested by either antibody precipitation curve (insulin and growth hormone) or by evaluation of binding to specific receptors using the fluorescence activated cell sorter, FACS (Interleukin-2). Our results showed that when using 125-1 the method of choice depends on the sensitivity of protein to iodination, in particular the molar ratio Protein/Iodine must be kept between 1:1 and 10:1. When using 123-1 the method that gave the highest labelling efficiency (50-70%), without altering the immunoreactivity, was the LPO/GOD technique. A difference was also observed between the Lab-W and Lab-B form of 123-1, the latter being more stable and reproducible. In the case of 123-1 the molar ratio Protein/Iodine was also extremely important and should be kept between 5:1 and 10:1 in order to reduce labelling damages. Our results outline the importance of the molar ratio between the protein and Iodine during iodination and indicates that enzimatic methods are preferable when applicable. They may require more complex purification procedures in order to remove labelled enzymes but lead to immunoreactive iodinated proteins. The reduced labelling efficiency observed with 123-1 respect to 125-1 can be due not only to its higher specific activity but also to the presence of chemical impurities. The search for quality control methods useful for preclinical evaluation of radielabelled antibody are of special importance. In this work the labelling efficiency, stability and biodistribution of anti-CEA F(ab')? fragment was studied. HPLG analysis of antibodies-was performed with a BIO-RAD HPLC system. Samples were eluated with 0.02 M N%HPOJO.05 Na~SO~ buffer at pH 6.8, and flow rate o~ 1 ~I/min. ABso~bance at 280nm was monitored and gamma-radiation were measured with a flow-through detector. Ouring polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) samples were applied to 7.5 % non reduced gel and 0.2 M phophate buffer of pH 7.6. Electrophoresis was carried out at 4 mA per tube at 4% for 24 hrs. The biodistributian of antibody was determined in immunsupressed mices bearing CEA positive human tumor. The labelling efficiency of antibody ranged between 95 -98 ~, extraneous protein was not detected. Stability of compounds duringl-48 hrs of storage, at 4~ was not changed also. lll-ln release was less than 3%. These results were confirmed by PAGE as well.

The starting material for these syntheses was Tc2(CO)10 prepared from dry NH4TcO ~ under less drastic conditions than those hitherto reported (i). Treatment of the latter with NOPF 6 in acetonitrile affords the cationic technetium(I) complex [Tc(CE) 3CN)(CO)5]PF 6 which is an excellent starting material for new cationic species since it reacts with a variety of bi-and tridentate chelate ligands containing N, P or S atoms. The biodistribution studies were carried out in guinea pigs. A number of these complexes showed significant accumulation in heart with competitive uptake in liver. Compound [Tc(CO)2(N,M){P(OR)3}2]PF 6 , where N,N stands for 4,4'-dimethyl-2,2'bipyridine and R for isopropyl, is a promising leading precursor suitable for further structural modification and optimization. Results of other biodistribution studies carried out with complexes of general formula [Tc(L)(CO)3]PF6, where L represents a macrocyclic ligand such as 1,4,7triazacyclononane, 1,4,7-trimethyl-l,4,7-triazacyclononane, 1,4,7-trithiacyclononane, etc. will also be presented. We performed the synthesis of the radioiodinated derivatives labeled with 1-125 from the correspondent amines using the Sandmeyer reaction or the Wallach triazene method. The screening of 1-125 compounds was performed after i.v. injection to C57BL6 mice bearing murine melanoma, BI6. Qualitative studies by autoradiography of whole body sections and quantitative studies of tissular and tumoral radioactivity showed that only one compound presented a selective localization in pigmented tumors. N-(2-die t hylaminoet hyl)#-iodobenzamide (Y=CONH) was evaluated in athymic mice bearing MM heterotransplants and showed : high tumor uptake from 1 t0 24 hr postiniection, high ratios tumor-to blood~ muscle, brain, lung and liver from 6 to 2g hr, rapid blood and urinary clearances",

Analysis by TLC and RP-HPLC revealed the presence of mainly one radiochemical species (II) ( 90%, starting from the unpurified deprotected ligand) with an identical retention time as that of Tc-99m MAG3 obtained by exchange labelling (I). In a second approach 2 mg of S-benzoyl MAG3 was stored shortly in alkaline medium before the addition of SnCI~ and generator eluate. Depending on pH differen~ Tc-ggm complexes were obtained. A procedure was developed that resulted in the formation within 5 min of >98% of a radiochemical species (III) with identical ret. time on RP-HPLC as I and II. Evaluation in mice and a baboon showed that HPLC-purifled I, II and III have identical biological properties. Further developmental work is still required to convert this new experimental labelling method to a kit preparation and to confirm the identity of the Tc-99m complex obtained by direct labelling. Colloids used for bone marrow scintigraphy give rise to a liver and spleen uptake which hampers the evaluation, especially of the bone marrow in the vicinity of the liver. The introduction of small-sized (\"nano-sized\") colloids (< I00 nm) has reduced the liver/spleen uptake, but not completely solved the problem. In this study, 4 small-sized commercial colloids labelled by 99Tcm are compared as regards the bone marrow activity relative to the liver, spleen and background activity. Three human albumin colloids (MICROLITE, E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co; SOLCO NANOCOLL, Solco Nuclear; TCK-9, International CIS) and one antimony sulfide colloid (TechneScan Sb2S 3, Mallincrodt Diagnostica) are examined. The study is performed in patients routinely referred for liver/spleen scintigraphy and exhibiting a negative investigation. This is performed as a SPECT-registration. 15 patients are examined by each colloid. From a pilot kinetic study, it was found adequate to perform the examination 30 minutes after injection of the radiocolloid. After correction for attenuation and scattering of photons, using techniques previously developed at our laboratory, the activity concentration of the bone marrow of the lumbar spine is related to the liver, spleen and background activity concentration. The bone marrow/liver activity quotient of SOLCO NANO-CaLL and TCK-9 is almost twice the value for MICROLITE and TechneScan Sb2S 3. The bone marrow/spleen quotient is almost 4 times higher and the ~ bone marrow/background quotient almost twice for SOLCO NANOCOLL than for the other 3 colloids tested, between which there is no significant difference regarding these quotients.

In three the average proportion of menocytes to other cells was 53% + 23% S.D. In the other three samples the propertion of monocytes was less than 10%.

The problems of collecting large samples of blood will be discussed as will the problems associated with the handling of monocytes. Also to be discurred are the celinioal possibilities of radiolabelled monocytes. i.e. 40.108 MBq/ mmol,the brain uptake decreased considerably. Blood sampling 60 min. post inj. showed that the larger part of the tracer was bound to plasma proteins (>90%). In vitro binding experiments proved that the binding of 131I-2-I-Ketanserin to human serum albumin is not saturable:L=K~Lo(F: free;o:initial) [eq.l]. Partition between octanol and tris/HCl buffer of PH 7.4 was carried out on 13zI-2-I-Ketanserin, within a concentration range of 3.10-i~ -I~ M. The apparent log P increased linearly with the concentration. If the extraction into the organic layer is comparable to lipophilic BBB passage,than LBr=L~/l+10exp-K2LF(Br:brain) [eq.2]. Combination of [eq.l] and [eq.2] yields LB=KILo/I+I0exp-KIKzL 0. Depending on the exponent [eq.3] will be pseudolinear or more complex. As the specific activity is also limited at its lower values due to carrier competition for receptor sites, the specific activity to be used becomes critical. In case of 2-~23I-Ketanserin the optimal receptor to back ground ratio was estimated to be around 3.108 MBq/mmol corresponding to 5.10 -I~ mol injected.

The use of (99mTc)-d,l-HH-PAO(HM-PAO) for the investigation of cerebral blood flow and for blood cell labelling has become widespread. It is well known that the relatively fast in vitro decomposition of the labelled complex renders it difficult to use this radiopharmacon. We have clarified the influence of the labelling conditions and kit formulation on the stability of the lipophilic complex (LC) and developed a novel kit formulation providing high LC stability. Analytical grade chemicals and self-synthetized HM-PAO were used. The radiochemica] purity of Tc-labelled compounds was meassured with three analytical methods: the three-strip method of Neirinckx et al., RP-HPLC and the solvent extraction method of Ballinger et al. The novel kit contains d,I-HM-PAO 0.30 mg, tio(II)chloride dihydrate 3.80 #g, and tetrasodium pyrophosphate decahydrate 2.52 mg. The radiopharmacon was prepared by adding 0.6-1.1 GBq (99mTc)-pertechnetate in 5.0 ml saline. The freeze-dried kit had considerable in vitro LC stability. LC komplex yields: 96.57 + 1.8 (n:150) at 1 min, and 81.98 ~ 2.1 at 120 min (nTBO). The age of the eluate used for labelling had no effect on the LC yield. We have used the novel kit routinely for human SPECT rCBF investigations (150 patients) and for leukocyta labelling (iO0 patients) for one year. The image quality was excellent. The cell labelling efficacy was 65.11 ~ + 1.24 using 2xlO 8 cells/0.5 ml. W.Burchert, J. Fl6ge, P. Gietow, J. SchS.ffer, I~. M. Koch, H. Hundeshagen.

The results confirmed the usefulness of the scintigraphy as apossibly early -procedure to identify amyloid deposits in long-term hemodialysis. The aim of this study was to develope a simplified method to synthesize 1-123 labelled ANF and to investigate the kinetics of this new tracer for organs with ANF-receptors. ANF was iodinated by the Chloramin T-method and for subsequent purification a modification of the conventional High Pressure Liquid Chromatography ( HPLC ) -method was used. A simple gradient elution-technique was established which will avoid the need for an expensive linear gradient HPLC equipment. In the used HPLC development conditions the labelled protein was purified in a cascaded way. Seven gradients with a ratio of acctunitrile : water of 5 : 95 up to 65 : 35 and a time range of 5 minutes were applied. The iodinated ANF eluted at about 25% -30 % of acetonitrile. Centrifugation with a speedvac under vacuum was followed by the administration of the monoiodinated ANF in a quantity of about 500 gCi/kg to the rabbit. The kinetic profile was investigated by a dynamic study with a gamma camera. Fifteen images were taken at 5 minute intervals each with a total time of 75 minutes. Some data of the observed kinetics of the best visualized organs after i.v. administration are given in the following It is known that the labelling efficiency of M!BG decreases rapidly if the specific activity is mequired to be so high that the compound w~uld be suitable also for therapeutic use. Using /NH / SO as catalystl~ [ the isotope exchange,Aide ~ield of the --I-MIBG were 98-26% depending on the specific activity in the range of 28-12S3 MBq/mg. Slightly better labelling data were obt~ed in presence of CuCI or using Br/-l halogen ex-2 change reaction. On the other hand all o,f these procedures should consist of two steps: i. labelling 2. separation of free iodine. Based on earlier results a one-step p~ocedure was elaborated. As catalyst a layered derivatized zirconium phosphate at elevated temperature. After cooling the MIBG is dissolved in the buffer and the insoluble catalyg~lis retained on the filter. By this method I-M!BG with specific activity up to 7~0 MBq/mg can be obtained, the rediochemical purity is much higher than 95% checked by TLC /on Polygram SIL-NH-R layer/. The solution is Zr-free. The one step procedure is already a routine for the production of the diagnostic MIBG in Hungary, and clinical trial for MIBG therapy may begin this year. ",

Ten healthy subjebts were investigated. After an overnight fast, each subject was given a standardized test meal consisting of scrambled egg labeled with 3 mCi of Tc-99m-Sc, bread and water. Immediately after ingestion of the meal, each volunteer sat between the two heads of a dual-headed gamma camera interfaced to a computer. Sixty four by 64 matrix with a 2.6 acquisition zoom list mode images of the stomach were acquired for 5 mfflutes at 15, 3I, 61, 91 and 121 minutes after meal oomp[etion Each set of anterior and posterior list mode images was refrained in 250 msec. decay-corrected geometric mean images. A ROI was drawn around the antrum and antrel time-activity curves were generated. A curve-peak finding algorithm was then applied to each time-activity curve to indicate the start of every gastric cycle. List mode images were refrained in 20 images per cycle and for each 5 minutes set of dynamic acquisition 20 pseudo-gated images consisting of the sum of the same numbered frame interval in every cycle were generated. Fourier analysis of the time. activity curve in each gastric pixel location of the 20 pseudo-gated images allowed to generate phases images of the stomach in a color scale. The closed loop cinematic display of the phase images during a gastric cycle enables to visualize the progression of the wave of gastric contraction i.e. the gastric mechanical systole. Correlations between the antral time-activity curves cycle and gastric contractions were established in 5 dogs using the eerosal electrogastrographic technique. Three weeks after surgical implantation of 4 bipolar silver chloride electrodes distributed from the terminal antrum to the proximal fundus, each dog underwent the isotopic procedure described above. Simultaneous isotopic and serosal eleotrogastrograpphic recordings were performed to correlate the contractions electrical activity with the antral time-activity cui'ves. The patterns of phase distribution and sequential phase changes of food in the stomach we observed indicate that the proximal stomach does not undergo phasic contractions while in the distal stomach, contrac. tions originate in mid-corpus and propagate to the pylorus. This is in agreement with results obtained by other investigators with invasive techniques. In conclusion, the scintigraphic test can be used to noninvasively visualize gastric contractions and to delineate the spatial progression of the gastric electromechanical wave of contraction. This technique can be used to study patients with gastric disorders.",

Despite these favourable characteristics, many nuclear medicine departments are still reluctant to investigate children and particularly the very young ones, because of several difficulties. The first problem is that the child is a growing person and that the maturation patterns strongly influence the interpretation of a scintigraphic image as well as the quantitative estimation of a function. The second problem is that the indications of the pediatdc examinations dilter considerably from the adult ones. For instance, lung emboly is the main indication of lung perfusion/ventilation scintigraphy in adults, while tnis indication is seldom encountered in pediauius, 5i~, !i,d.lJ'l iiidicaiion being the evaluation of the remaining lung function in various acute and chronic lung diseases. The third problem is the radiation dose. The fourth problem, and may be the most important one, is the fact that special care should be taken when performing a nuclear procedure in children and this needs a well trained technical and medical staff. Having the collaboration of a smiling child will considerably contribute to the quality of an examination. This can be obtained only i1 the psychological atmosphere surrounding the child is favourable : adapted examination room, participation of the parents, sufficient explanation given to the child,... Drug sedation is exceptionally necessary and the immobilization of the child by means of vacuum cushions is very helpful : nevertheless, this will be successful only if the child has received sufficient attention and feels happy. Other problems are related to the choice of collimators, the position of the patient in front of the gamma camera, and the intravenous injection of the tracer. Finally, it is obvious that much more time should be devoted to a nuclear procedure performed on a small child. In the dept of Ped Clin Physiol, G6teborg, we have investigated children during the last 25 years. Our goal is to obtain the best possible examination with a minimum of discomfort for the child. When we two years ago got a gamma camera, we found our previous experience valuable. There are a number of problems specific to pediatric nuclear medicine that, however, may be alleviated. Anxiety of the sick child and its parents. Well informed patients/parents feel secure. Obtain confidance and trust. Never lie to a child! Take your time to inform about the procedure. Let the parents in! Make the camera room look Iess frightening. Fear of venous puncture.",

A good psychological surrounding facilitates the different steps of the procedure. The tracer is mixed with a small amount of the usual milk preparation or pudding, and is administered to the child in comfortable conditions. Special care should be taken to prevent any clothes or skin contamination. The mouth and esophagus are rinced by adding a supplementary amount of the non-radioactive meal. This is checked on the screen before starting the recording period.The child is immobilized in a vacuum maitres and placed on the gamma camera in supine position, which allows the highest GER detection rate. The child is constantly observed in order to correlate later on the reflux episodes with manifestations like crying, coughing or pallor.The data are stored in the computer at the rate of 1 frame per 20 sec during 1Hr. The contrast of the images is enhanced, in order to visualize esophageal activity as low as 1% of the maximal gastric activity. The 180 images are visualized one by one, and all the episodes of reflux are noted. A time activity curve over the esophageal area is then produced and the reflux peaks are carefully compared to the corresponding images, in order to detect any artefactual peak due to an accidental displacement of the stomach into the esophageal area. A delayed high intensity image of the chest is obtained 4Hr later, in order to pick up any abnormal area of radioactivity which could suggest lung aspiration.The GER scan is non invasive, physiological and particularly well adapted to the child.

The following parameters were investigated: Mean Piatelet Life (HPL), Initial Platelet Recovery(IPR), Total Platelet Production Rote (TPPR) and the absolute uptake in liver and spleen after I hr and 5 days consecutively. In concurrence with a recommendation of the ICSH, the mean platelet life was calculated according to five different mathematieai models: linear, exponential or gammafunction, the average and the weighted average of the linear and exponential values. By means off a 2-compartmental model, the following parameters were calculated: the transport constant (k) from blood to spleen, splenic transittime and splenic blood flow. These parameters were calculated in order to gain a better insight into the platelet kinetics in patients with various kinds of thrombocytopenia. In our hands the labelling of platelets with 1111n-tropolonate was standard procedure. Parameters like mean platelet life, initial recovery, total platelet production rate and uptake curves in time over iiver and spleen proved to be clinically useful. The value of the calculations for the platelet kinetics as obtained by the 2-compartmental model still remained to be established, with regard to clinical management.

Specific metabolic characteristics and biological properties of tumors are being exploited to target radiopharmaceuticals at tumors for diagnostic imaging and radionuclide therapy.

Nuclear medicine techniques can be useful to document organ toxicity due to oncological treatment. E.g. during chemotherapy with Doxorubicine or Cis-Platin nuclear medicine methods have been demonstrated to be effective for early detection of cardiotoxicity and renal damage. With the introduction of new technical possibilities (linear accelerators, 3-D treatment planning) there is s tendency in radiation therapy to irradiate malignancies taking larger volumes in order to improve survival rates. This approach may cause injury of normal organs irradiated together with the tumor with the onset of complaints. after a short or longer interval. Establishment of dysfunction of these dose-limiting organs is important for the clinical management. Furthermore the accurate determination of clinical dose-effect relations is essential to optimize radiation -or chemotherapeutical regimens. In the Netherlands Cancer Institute we are using various nuclear medicine techniques to document organ dysfunction. After an overview of these applications and their clinical setting the methodological aspects of some of these modalities and clinical examples will be presented: i. Combined use of 75Se-HCAT retention measurements and 14C-Glycochol breath test to determine post irradiation late small bowel dysfunction. 2. Quantitative ventilation-perfusion SPECT in the assessment of lung radiation injury. 3. 99mTc-DTPA renography and quantitative 99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy for monitoring kidney function after radiation therapy or during chemotherapy. Monoclonal antibodies (Moab) have been prepared against a variety of tumour-associated antigens. After labeling with radio-isotopes, only a limited number appears useful for in vlvo immunosclntlgraphy. These Moab are candidates for therapeutical applications. There are several options for Moab-based antl-tumour therapy. One of these is the targeting of cytotoxic immune cells towards tumour cells. Our findings in this respect with a Moab directed against a pancarcinoma cell antigen (MOC31) are discussed. MOC31 was conjugated with DTPA and labeled with 111Indium. When this radioimmunoconjugate was injected into nude rats carrying a human lungcarcinoma xenograft, the radiolabel localized specifically intothe tumour. This indicated the usefulness of MOC31 for tumourimaging. To assess If, simllarlly, MOC31 may guide immune cells towards tumourcells, a bispecific monoclonal antibody (Biab) was made from MOC31. This Blab (BIS2) had one specificity against the MOC31-antigen and the other against the CD3-antigen on T-cells. BIS2 may not only link T-cells to tumourcells, but at the same time may trigger the former to become cytotoxic towards the latter, It was shown, in vitro, that BIS2-incubated T-cells induced the specific lysis of MOC31-positive, but not MOC31-negative, tumourcell-lines. Subsequently, BIS2-incubated T-cells were assessed in vivo by injecting the cells into the peritoneal or pleural cavity of patients suffering from carcinoma-induced ascites or pleural effusion. At various time points after injection samples were drawn and evaluated. The results show that BIS2-incubated T-cells form multi-cellular conjugates around tumour cells, already one hour after injection. Significant tumourcell-lysis was apparent after 24-48 hours. Also a large Influx of granulocytes was apparent at that time, Indicating local imflammation. The first 40 hours(5 days) were carried out in September 1989 , the second part in November. Finishing the course and pass of the examination gives an official permission for work in nuclear medicine departments. 2 months after the second part of the course a questionnaire was send to all participants. The evaluation of this post-graduate training will be presented with special interest of the usefullness for daily ~prk.

Phantom studies and the application of information theory to SPECT acquisition modalities have showed that concerning image quality the system resolution is a much more important factor than system sensitivity (ref.). The system resolution of our longbore collimator in a nominal SPECT acquisition geometry (FW}{M = ii mm) is superior to the resolution achieved with the LEAP (FWHM = 17 mm). or FIR (FWHM = 13 mm) collimator. The striking resolution improvement is mainly due to the 40 percent decreased rotation radius which can be achieved with the longbore collimator. Several data analysis procedures for the semi-quantification of the rCBF have been published. Most of these methods are based on the determination of the activity ratio between cortical ROI's and a cerebellar ROI, assuming that the cerebellum is insensitive to pathological changes. This assumption is however a limiting factor for the accuracy of the quantification method because among other things biological variations are not taken into account. At our institute a rCBF-quantification phantom has been developed. This phantom can be positioned as an additional transversal slice while acquisition is performed simultaneously for both the brain and the phantom at 360 degrees and 64 views of 20 seconds each. The reconstructed transversal activity distribution is correlated to the corresponding areas in the phantom. The quantification analysis is implemented in a slightly modified version of the BULB program (Koskinen, Tampere). For this purpose the transversal slices as well as the phantom slice are divided in twelve pieshaped segments each representing a part of the brain. A simple outline of the data acquisition procedure and some preliminary results will be presented.",

It is concluded that the preparation time of Tc-ggm MIBI can drastically be reduced to <5 min and a practical, rapid and reliable method for analysis is available. Scintillation proximity assay (SPA) is based on the activation of a fluorophor integrated in antibody coated beads. Only the antibody-bound radiolabelled ligand which is in close proximity of the bead activates the fluorophor. The light produced by activated microspheres is counted in a scintillation counter. Thus, immunoassay can be performed without the need to separate bound and free ligand. Therefore a positive effect on intra-assay variation as well as greater suitability with regard to automation may be expected. We set out to develop SPAs for cortisol and aldosterone in human plasma as well as a SPA for rat plasma corticosterone using commercially available SPA reagent. The level of plasma cortisol in a series of samples was measured by RIA and SPA. The results obtained with either assay were in excellent agreement (SPA = 0.002 ~mol/I + 1.007*RIA, r = 0.996, p < 0.01, n = 45). SPA technology can excellently be applied for the determination of steroid hormones provided that interference from plasma binding proteins, a general problem encountered in steroid hormone assay, is circumvented.",

They were asked to select the most efficient approach and, if possible, to define a standard protocol. After evaluation of the first 5 patients, they agreed that the 2 min images were of sufficient quality. A single anterior image was insufficient to detect all lesions but a combination of an anterior and a posterior image revealed all localisations. In the majority of these 5 pts additional images of the painful and cent,alateral knee were necessary for optimal Iocalisation of the lesions. The condyl view gave confusion in 2 patients. The preliminary conclusion is that routinely an anterior and posterior image must be obtained. If lesions are detected, an additional medial or lateral image of the diseased part of the knee and the corresponding view of the cent,alateral knee should be obtained. Quality control (QC) is a major concern in nuclear medicin and nuclear medicin technicians become increasingly involved. In order to assess which activities of QC are taken by the average Dutch technician, we performed a survey in 31 Dutch departments of nuclear medicin. In most departments measures for QC were acquired by self-study, and were organised and effectuated by the technicians themselves.Only in the academic hospitals was this supervised by a physicist. We conclude that in all hospita]s at least some measures of QC are taken, but that uniformity is lacking. We suggest that in future training of technicians more emphasis be put on matters of Qc. It is proposed that a manual with a number of general guidelines be compiled.",

In order to avoid ethically sensitive and expensive in vivo animal experiments and sacrifice of higher developed animals such as dogs,pigs or monkeys, we used organs harvested from slaughterhouse pigs, i0 -15m in postmortem, for the development of simple organ perfusion models of heart, kidney and liver. These organs were studied with different perfusion protocols to evaluate and define conditions for optimum metabolic preservation. Reperfusion of plegic swine hearts, livers and kidneys with arterialized blood inside the magnet showed regeneration of ATP, documenting the viability of the organs. In conclusion, pig kidneys, hearts and livers from slaughterhouse lend themselves to easy, non expensive organ perfusionmodels. Together with P-31-MRS these organ perfusion models are used in our institute for a large variety of experimental protocols, such as metabolic studies of preservation solutions used for human organ transplants, effects of various pharmaceuticals on energy metabolism or testing of perfluorocarbon emulsions as blood substitutes.",

PA 2 has a physiological role as a regulator of prostaglandine biosynthesis and as a digestive enzyme secreted by the pancreas. Autodigestion through PA2 probably is the main pathogenic factor in acute pancreatitis and serum levels of PA2 activity have been reported to correlate with the severity of the disease. A sensitive and straightforward assay of serum PA 2 activity thus would be a valuable tool in diagnosis and prognosis of patients with acute pancreatitis. The amount of 14C-labelled palmitic acid (PA) released from the substrate L-c~-dipalmitoyl-(2-[ 1-14C] palmitoyl)phosphatidy 1-choline (PC) after incubation with the enzyme source was used to measure PA2 activity, which was expressed as nmol of (14C)-patmitic acid per men per ml serum. After incubation the 14C-palmitic acid was separated from excess of 14C-PC prior to measurement of radioactivity. Using purified PA 2 from porcine pancreas various reagents and reaction conditions were tested to optimize enzymatic activity. Increasing the substrate concentration in the incubation mix resulted in maximal activity at 0.64 mM PC. The presence of calcium ions in the assay buffer was indispensable for PA 2 activity, the maximum occurring at 20 mM CaC12. The importance of detergents was shown by a twenty fold increase in activity when SDS (2.5 mM) was added to the assay buffer. The optimum pH of the Tris-HC1 buffer was found to be 8.0. Enzyme activity was constant in time for at least 2 hours. Within-run precision analysis with one serum source showed a coefficient of variation of 7% in the lower range of PA2 activity (mean: 0.44 nmol/min/ml; SD:0.03; n=9). The sensitivity of the assay allowed determinations of PA2 activity as low as 0.1 nmo] palmitic acid/min/ml seruro. Studies are presently i 9 progress to investigate in more detail the postulated prognostic potency of PA2 activity in serum. This study was undertaken to acquire objective data on blood loss in women complaining of heavy menorrhagia.",

A number of possible errom, including head tilt, collimator hole angnlation and zoom factor, may be of influence on the determination of the COR. h some systems the detector shows sag due to ils weight This willintroduce a shift of the projection imagesin the Y-di.rectiun. The magnitude of the shift will vary during rotation and is dependant on the radius of rotation. To prevent introduction of a head tilt, the detector has to be positioned to the amount of sag (0. 8 ~ in our system). After calibration a m-nan spirit level was attached to the detector, enabling to position tl~ detector to 0.8~163 ~ The influence of the radius of rotation on the COR correction was meamaedby acquiring SPECT studies of point sources.The paths that were described by a point source that was placed off axis, using COR corrections obtained with different radii, were ploUed. These ~owed that ~ag a different radius for correction as for acquisition, resulted in less accurate corrections. Resolution of point sources, measured as FWHM in axial, radial and tangential direction, was not significantly decreosvd when different radii (200 vs 350 nun) were used. Reconstruction of SPECT studies of a Jaszczak phantom, did not show differences in resolution and contrast when different COR corrections were used. This means that although the COR correction derived with a different radius is not able to fully correct the shift of the projection images, the influence is not noticeable in the recenstmcted slices. A new three-headed gamma camera, the 1GE NEUROCAM, has been recently installed in our Institute for evaluation in an everyday clinical environment. This new instrument is dedicated to single photon emission tomography (SPET) of the head and consists of: 1) a comfortable couch (of variable height) with a fixed height head rest; 2) three cuboid (40.5x40.5x25.3 cm) detector heads with a field of view (FOV) of 22x19 cm (central FOV = 20x17 cm); 3) an acquisition terminal, PC compatible. Each detector head has 27 photomultiplier tubes (PMT). Two types of low energy (LE) parallel hole collimators, a general purpose (GP) and a high resolution (HR) are available and interchangeable by a single operator. The reconstructed pixei size is 4 mm in a 64x64 and 2 mm in a 128x128 matrix. Data processing is carried out in the IGE STAR3000 computer linked to the PC terminal.",

            "text": "The results show that patient positioning is extremely easy and time saving (less than 1 minute). High quality images are obtained in a relatively short total acquisition time (20 minutes). Shorter acquisition times (5 and 10 minutes per study) allow for higher than average spatial and contrast resolution. DYNAMIC SPET with some radiotraeers (i.e. 123I-IBZM ) is possible which permits the study of their kinetics. Finally IGE/NEUROCAM is a small compact system which fits into relatively small spaces. It seems to be ideal for Departments with a busy neurological clinical routine. The purpose of the present study is, to visualize and quantify dopamine D2 receptors in the living human brain using an [1251] labeled ligand and the SPECT technique, ledobenzamide (S(-)IBZM) has been shown to be a highly selective ligand with high affinity For D2 receptors in experimental studies. 5mCi (185 MBq) of [1251] labeled S(-)IBZM were administered i.v. to: 9 control subjects, 18 parkinsonian patienLs under L-DOPA therapy,7 parkinsonian patients without L-DOPA and 8 unmedicated patients with Huntington's disease. Data collection with e rotating double head scintillation camera started 1 hour after injection and lasted For SO minutes. In a semiquantitative approach a ratio was calculated between mean counts per pixel in the striatum and a region in the lateral Frontal cortex, which was t.77 + O.11 in the control group. A marked reduction of this ratio was Found in patients with Huntington's disease (1.57 \u2022 0.15. p = 0.0001), no changes in untreated parkinsonian patients (1.72 \u2022 0.12), but a reduction in L-DOPA treated cases (1.60 \u2022 0.15, p = 0.003). A curvilinear relationship was Found between total daily dose of neuroleptics and the reduction of this ratio. Estimated receptor blockade under Full neuroleptic treatment was 75 to 80~. Preliminary results in acutely psychotic patients, who had never received neuroleptics did not show differences to the control group. S(-)IBZM binding is reduced with increasing age (p < 0.05). Specific binding was reduced markedly, when the racemic mixture of IBZM was used, and no specific binding was seen with the R(+)iaomere, demonstrating the stereoselectivity of IBZM binding. The results show, that dopamine D2 receptors can be clearly visualized with high resolution using the SPECT technique and S(-)IBZM as a ligand. A semiquantitative approach can give estimates for receptor blockade or receptor density. This method is of clinical value For the early diagnosis of degenerative neurological disorders, such as Huntington'a disease, and For the monitoring of neureleptic treatment.",

Acutely rejecting grafts show infiltration with activated lymphocytes but also a massive induction of Class I and II major histocompatibility complex antigens (MHC I & II) on cells. Renal rejection in the rat has been induced by transplanting DA rat kidneys into PVG recipient rats and rejection was assessed by in vivo use of 3 lliIn labelled monoclonal antibodies (McAb). Control experiments have utilised an isograft (non-rejecting kidney). Uptake ratios of rejecting to native kidneys at 4 days post transplant were 1.37 for anti IL-2, 31.5 for anti MHC I and 2 for anti MHC II. Scintillation camera images have shown marked localisation of tracers. Further experiments using anti MHC I, have studied the effect of cyclosporin treatment in reversing the antigenic expression. Four rats have been studied at 3, 7, 14 and 21 days following transplantation. Uptake of McAb in the graft remained high (ratio 21.7 transplant 3 days on cyclosporin vs 23 untreated at 3 days).

We studied the contribution of scintigraphy after intra-articular injection of In-lll during routine roentgenologlcal arthrography (RA) in the evaluation of loosening of total hip prostheses. Patients in whom a RA was indicated were eligible for the study. Twenty nine patients were i.v. in-Jected with 600 MBq Tc-99m-MDP. Then a standard RA was performed (including subtraction images). The contrast medium (Onulipaque 300 ~ was mixed with Iniii Chloride up to a concentration of 0.37 MBq/ml. The nuclear arthrography (NA) was performed after completion of the RA. Tc-99m-MDP and In-lll (247 keV photopeak only) images were both recorded in exactly the same position from four different angles and interpreted by optical superposltion. The bone scan was only used as a landmark for the )rosthesls and adjacent bone structures. tlll now six patients were operated. NA only showed one false positive acetabular loosening. RA showed one false negative femoral, one false positive and three false negative acetabular components. Pitfalls for the interpretation of NA are the filling of bursae resulting in projection over the prosthesis and venous or lymphatic In-lll resorption. Advantages of NA are the superior intrinsic sensitivity of scintlgraphy for the detection of radiolabeled contrast agents and the i~proved distribution of due to walking after the injection of In-111. We conclude that NA is a promising, sensitive technique for the evaluation of loosening of total hip prostheses. It should only be used in combination with RA.",

The aim of this study was to assess if white blood cells scan (WBCS) could detect a patchy lesion with various bacterial overgrowth levels. METHODS : 9 patients were studied on the 3rd day after the accident in 2 cases and over the 1st week in 7. Burnt area surface were 10 to 80 %, depth spreaded from superficial 2 nd degree to 3 rd degree. According to cultures results, burns were classified as sterile, septic or doubtful. White blood cells HM-PAO-99mTc labelling (Ceretec*, AMERSHAM) was performed according to Peters's method. 3 hours after leucocyte injection (200 MBq), whole body scan was achieved using a large rectangular head camera (DSX, SOPHA MEDICAL). A comparative 67Ga scan was obtained in the same time. Scan was called positive when inhomogeneous activity was observed in front of cutaneous lesions. one case, a doubtful burn studied again was sterile) DISCUSSION : WBCS gives a nice topographic description of the lesions and of the infectious heterogeneity. WBCS and Ga scans both agree in extreme cases. Positive WBCS without positivity of Ga could either indicate severe inflammatory response or be an early indicator of cutaneous infection.

Since ACE localizes on the luminal surface of vascular endothelial cells we have suggested that the decrease of MoAb 9B9 lung acc~mn]ation should reflect the extent of lung vessel injury. The aim of this study is to evaluate the MoAb 9B9 specific lung accumulation in hamsters with experimentally induced lung metastasis.Lung metastasis is induced by injection of 105-106 Raus Sarcoma virus (Schaidt-~/ppinstrain) -transformed hamster embryo cells into orbital cavity of Syrian hamsters~ The biodistribution! and specific lung accumulation of radiolabeled MoAb 9B9 are esti~aated at different stages of lung metastasis development -sequestration of tumor cells in pulmonary vessel, extravasation and tumor colony formation in lung, -i0 min, 9 and 22 days after tumor cells injection, respectively. Specific MoAb 9B9 lung accumulation decreases significantly in hamsters with formed colonies of tumor cells in lung: 15.'7+1.2% of injected dose/g VS 23.1+1.9 in controT.we believe that MoAb 9B9 lung accumulation might serve a very sensitive marker of lung vessel injury upon lung metastasis and tumors.372 W.-G.

Thirty-two consecutive (<70 yre old) lots with first transmural MI were investigated 17 + 4 days after acute event: 14 pts had anterior (ANT) and 1810is had interior (INF) MI. All pts underwent coronary anglography (CA) within 6 days of the radlonuclide test: 15 pts had single vessel disease (SVD) and 18 pts had multivessel (>50% stenosis) disease (MVD).During upright bicycle symptom limited exercise 2 pts presented angina, 9 pls had positive ECG changes (ECG+), 15 pts had exercise induced wall motion abnormalities and an exercise ejection fraction z 5% below that predicted by age (RNA+), and 20 pts had exercise induced myocardial perfusion defects in (PD MI) or outside (PD non-MI) the infarcted territory on quantitative SPECT bullseye diagram:We conclude: (1) residual myocardial ischemia after acute MI is much more frequent than expected from ECG alone; (2) exemise EF and SPECT MIBI are very sensitive in detecting MVD in pts with recent MI; (3) significant peal-infarction ischemic zones at risk are common after ANT MI but not after INF MI; (4) MVD is unlikely in pts with INF MI if RNA or SPECT MIBI failed to demonstrate exercise induced ischemia.",

In radionuclide ventriculography (RNV) a computer-simulatlon can provide a large variety of studies with all the possible variations of the geometric and physiological parameters. In our simulation, ventricles and atria are approximated by ellipsoids. The size of the main-axis of the ellipsoids and their position on a 2D-plane can be adjusted. The contraction of the ventricles is established by an adjustable time-volume curve. Rotation and translation can be modelled by shifting the center of gravity. Background activity and Poisson noise can be added. The nonideal resolution of the gamma-camera is simulated by the convolution with the measured pointspread function.

No effect was observed on solid T 89 or RoE at 70 or 95 rain. Liquid GE was also delayed after smoking (T}: 99-+56 rain vs 53-+25; 10 rain RoE: 0.53-+0.43 vs 1.44_+1.0; and 20 rain RoE: 0.56-+0.36 vs 1.0-+0.5, all p<0.05). No effect was seen in liquid 45, 70 and 95 rain RoE. SBTT was delayed after smoking (143-+41 rain vs 84-+37, p=0.01), and correlated with the delay in liquid GE. Altered GE & SBTT did not correlate with patient age, number of cigarettes smoked per day and duration of smoking. Conclusion: Cigarette smoking delays GE of both solids and liquids, the effect being confined to the initial 45 rain after smoking. Smoking also slews SBTT, an effect which correlates with delayed liquid GE. 504 PR Gibson, M Lichtenstein, W Salehi JT Andrews, G ~eP~ar~,, Departments of Nuclear Medicine anr~ Medicine , The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia. ~UTOLOGOUS TC-99m-LEUCUCYTE SCIWTIG~APHY l~ PAHE~TS W!TH HiGH OR LOW PROBABiLiTY OF INTESTINAL i~FLA~MAliOH,Autoiogoue lc-99m-leucocyte scinti~rsphv ia conmidered to give accurate idealization amO a seml-q~antativs ouioe to the activity of ietestinai inflammation In patients with in;iammatocy bome~ Oisease iiBO)~ but the value im scree~znq iow-ris~ patients for iBD bee not been evaluated, AIMS: To examlne the predictive value of positzve studies in the dectioo of ~nteetloa! infimmmation in patients wiz~ hia~ and low probabihtv of iBD, METHODS: 2Y patients with a nlgh probability (previously aocumented IBD; an~ 58 with a low probability of intemtioai imfiammatlon were st~0ieo, Low probaPiiitv patients comprlseO ~7 with abdominal palm ~or diarrnoea (?IBD qroup~ and 2i suspected infective focus Out ~ithou~ sbaominai evmptmms (?ABSCESS ~roup).Autoboousleucocytes were isbeiipd usino etannous coiioio (isbsliinq efficiency ~ 95~) in 54, HMP~O in 2~, both sequentiaiiY in 4, StuOles were interprete~ by one observer blinded to the cilmlcai enOoscogic~ raoloiooic~ su~oicai ano histoioqic Oats.

NCA-95 is expressed in the eytosol and at the cell membrane of myelocytes and granulocytes. Since the cell number of these granulopoetic cells in BM is in about i00 : 1 excess to that of granulocytes in peripheral blood, TcNCAA distribute primarily to BM after i.v. application.

BN was obtained obtained for immunhistology (IH) end FACS -analysis during clinically indicated hip replacement. Viable BMC were stained by indirect immunefluorescence, using FITC-labelled anti-mouse F(ab')2fragments. IH showed selective TcNCAA binding to myelocytes and more mature granulopoetic cells.

SPECT with ~mTc-HMPAO and with the I labelled Bz-receptor ligand Ro 16-0154 were performed in 12 pts. with partial epilepsy, without cerebral lesion in MRI and CT. SPECT-studies with Ro 16-0154 were carried out 5 min and 2 h p.i. The HMPAOstudies was found in 9 of 12 patients. Bzreceptor mapping seems not superior to HMPAO in detection of epileptic foci.JW van Isselt, AME van Bentum, AC van Huffelen, PP van Rijk, University Hospital, PC Box 85500, Utrecht, The Netherlands THE DETECTION OF EPILEPTIC FOCI WITH x23I-IOMAZENIL In a group of patients with pharmacologically intractable focal epilepsy, eligible for partial lobotfxrcz, the site of the epileptic focus was to be determined. PET studies with XgF-Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine (BZ) antagonist, have demonstrated that in such patients ligand binding to BZ receptors is locally decreased. By substitution of x23I for XaF the SPECT agent x231-Ic~azenil (IONIA) is obtained. We did IOMASPECT in 17 patients with focal epilepsy. Thirty minutes after i.v. injection of 185 MBq IOMA, acquisition was performed on a rotating gamrr~ camera (360 o full angle rotation), reconstruction by Metz filtered back projection. The results of IOMA SPECTwere ccr ~ (scalp electrodes in 17/17 and depth electrodes in 8/17 patients) and XgF-FDG PET, EEG being the golden standard. IOMA SPECT de_monstrated the correct site in 15/17 patients (sensitivity 88%), XBF-FDG PET in 14/17 patients (sensitivity 82%). Our results show that in detecting epileptic foci x2~-Icn~zenil SPECTis slightly superior to cerebral blood flow studies with XSF-FDG PET. A recent multicenter study suggests that specific BZ receptor imaging can be enhanced by using a longer interval between injection and scanning, thus reducing the cerebral blood flow component in the image.

Clin. physiol, Hosp. physics and Kidney desease, Danderyd hospital and Huddinge hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.ESTIMATION OF MAG-3 PLASMA CLEARANCE BY USE OF ONE SINGLE PLASMA SAMPLERecent studies have shown that MAG3 is a suitable replacement for 131-I-or 123-I-hippurate in gammacamera renography. Also the determination of its clearance is of value, since it correlates welt to that of hippurate. In order to simplify the clearance method we developed formulas for the estimation of MAG3 plasma clearance based on one single plasma sample and compared them with the multiple sample method based on 7 plasma samples. Also the correlation to ERPF (Tauxe's method, 123-I-OIH) was determined. 32 patients (16 kidney transplants) with ERPF from 75 to 654 ml/min 1.73 m2 were investigated. Using only one plasma sample the formulas at different collection times were: /min. The correlation between multiple sample MAG3 clearance and ERPF was high (r-0.86). Thus, the error using a simplified single sample plasma clearance method for MAG3 is acceptable low using collection times between 44 and 60 min.Since normal values for MAG3 clearance are not yet avaliable a transformation to estimated ERPF valus (ERPF-I.869 x C +g 6) could be valuable for comparison with MAG3 \" Tauxe's normal values.

To study the in vivo pharmacokinetics of FL the drug was labeled with F-18 by a modified Schiemann reaction on the amino precursor. The biodislribution of F-18[FL]  was determined in rats at 5,30,60, and 120 min (% dose/gm). When pharmacolgical doses are administered these concentrations are in excess of that required to inhibit growth of invading yeast.Whole body PET images of rabbits injected with F-18[FL] revealed the highest uptake in the liver and kidneys, and demonstrable accumulation in the other organs as well.This approach will allow us to delineate the in vivo distribution of FL in a variety of disease states.R.

The cell bound activity ( total cell bound activity in the whole blood) raised from 17.6 +/-9% to 23.4 +/-9% after 4 hours and 24.8 +/-9% a~ter 24 hours.0n the assumption that an antibody with a higher specific activity would result in higher cell binding rate,we applied in 3 patients 20 ~g of In-ill labelled IgG BW 250/183 with an activity of 74 MBq. The cell bound activity varied from 24 to 26% without any change in a time period of 26 hours.ln 5 normal subjects we have ~erformed an in vitro labelling of leucocytes with i0 ~g TC-99m labelled IgG bw 250/183 .The labelling efficiency was 39 +/-13% afer i h and 45 +/-13% after 2 hours.The cells have been isolated in the same way as for labelling with In-lll-oxine. In 7 normal subjects who were informed and had given their consent ,we applied leucocytes labelled with I0 ~g TC-99m Igg BW 250/183.The in vivo cell bounding rate was about 30% in the first 24 hours after injection.ln 6 normal volunteers we applied leucocytes labelled with i pg TC-99m IgG BW 250/183.The cell bound activity lied also in the range of 30~.The in vitro labelled leucocytes showed a slightly higher cell bound activity as the in vitro labelled. The time course in whole blood during the first 5 hours after injection showed a biexponential slope. Regarding the time between 30 minutes and 5 hours (for the in vivo Tc-99m labelled Mab and the leucocytes labelled with both Mab's) 3 different half lifes in the whole blood could be measured.For Tc-99m in vivo 96+/-3,Tc-99m in vitro 216 +/-38 and In-lll in vitro 346 +/-93 minutes. Independent of the way of application and the amount of protein of the Mab an equilibriu/n between the granulocytea and the plasma is reached within a few minutes.

In 12 pts. unknown tumor lesions could be detected: ovaries (S pts.), axlllary lymphnodes (5 pts.), lungs (3 pts.), thorax wall (2 pts.), and one coincidental colorectal cancer. Though the Tc-99m labelled MAB was easier to handle, diagnostic yield of the In-lll labelled compound was much higher (8 new lesions vs. 3). In particular, tumor deposits neighboring the lungs were exclusively detected on late Images (6 tumor uptake on early images (1-3 dpi).

Conclusion: A satisfactory evaluation of GFR through a wide range of clearance values can be obtained by making two external measurements at 2.5 & 3.5 hrs post single injection of TC-99malthough slightly better results are obtained with larger time interval between the external measurements.D.Kuzmanovska~N,Serafi_mov,V.Tasid and V.Bogdanova Inst.of Pathophysiology and Nuclear Medicine,and Pediatric Clinic,Medical Faculty,Skopje,Yugoslavia EVALUATION OF RADIONUCLIDE UROCYSTOGRAPHY AND 99Tcm-DMSA IN DETECTION OF VESICOURETERAL REFLUX AND REFLUX NEPHROPATHY Direct radionuclide urocystography was carried out in 143 children (9 mo to 15 y)indicated by the first(62) or reccurent urinary tract infection(UTl).In 43(30%) vesicourinary reflux(VUR) was detected.ln 8 VUR was bilateral ,in 38 unilateral(right 10,1eft 25).99Tc-DMSA was carried out in the 43 patients with VUR.Abnormal D~SA-scintiscan was found in 26(60%) unilateral in 23 and bilateral in 3 patitnts.ln 18 there were one to two parenchymal defects,in two patientsmore than two defects,in six kidney was in toto contracted and in three kidney size was extremely reduced. The high rate of VUR and DMS-vi~ualized VUR nephropathy found in UTI seems to be caused by the selection of the patients seeking medical examination.The presented r+.sults suggest that direct radionuclide urocystography and DMS-scintiscan are reliable methods for detection of VUR and consequent kidney lesions.

Serum-creatinine and MAG3-clearance showed an inverse correlation. Patients with a serum-creatinine above normal constantly have a lowered MAG3~clearance and vice verse.For creatinine-values lower than 1.8 mg/dl, minor changes in creatinine go along with large changes in NAG3-elearance.The results indicate that with the NAG3-clearance changes in renal function are documented when only minor changes in serum creatinine occur.

EVALUATION OF FIVE NEW 99mTc MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION TRACERS. Five new cationic 99mTc complexes have been evaluated in animals and humans as potential myocardial perfusion imaging agents. All complexes contain phosphine ligands with pendant -CH2CH2CH2OCH3 (R) groups. The complexes are constructed about the tr-[TcvO2] +, reducible tr-[TclllcI2] +, non-reducible tr-[Tclll(acac2en)]+ and tr-[TcIII(CAE)] +, and [Tcl] + cores (where acac2en is N,N'ethylenebis (acetylacetone iminato) and CAE is an acac2en analog which contains a pendant ethyl ester). In human volunteers the Tc III and Tc I complexes exhibit rapid blood clearance, low lung uptake, good to excellent myocardial uptake, and relatively rapid hepatobiliary clearance. In vivo metabolism causes myocardial washout of the tr-[TclllcI2] + and tr-[TclII(CAE)] + complexes. The complexes which exhibit the best biological distributions in humans are [99mTcI(R2PCH2CH2PR2)3]+ and tr-[99mTc(acac2en)(PR3)2]+ (2.5% and 2.1% id in the heart at 1 h post injection respectively). The latter, nonreducible Tc Ill, complex provides a basis for the development of a series of clinically useful 99mTc myocardial perfusion imaging agents. P. Van den Winkel.

A NEW, FAST AND SEMI-AUTOMATED METHOD FOR THE PRODUCTION OF ULTRA-PURE TL201 INCLUDING ANODIC STRIPPING VOLTAMMETRY AND SOLVENT EXTRACTION FOR CHEMICAL AND RADIOCHEMICAL QUALITY CONTROL.The irradiated enriched T1203 target on Cu-support is quickly dissolved in H202/Pb(N03)2/BCI04 and the Pb201 precipitated as PbS04. Upon uptake in NaAc any co-precipitated T1 carrier is removed bij cation exchange. The eluate is collected in diluted HN03 and the Pb201 parent nuclide electrodeposited as Pb02 in less than 10 min (total target processing time 30 min). Upon decay of the Pb201 into TI201 the Pb02 is dissolved in HC1 and TI201 extracted with TBP in diisoprepylether. Back-extraction is done with diluted HCI containing an appropriate amount of sulphite. After removal of residual organic NaOH (total separation time 20 min). Using semi-automated chemistry systems the overall yield for TI201 is better than 97%. The chemical quality control of the resulting bulk is done by anodic stripping voltammetry in 0,9% NaC1 as supporting electrolyte and EDTA as complexing agent. Within 15 min the analysis of sulphite, T1, Pb and Cu are performed on a single 20~1 bulk sample. It is proven that the radiochemical quality contral by the time consuming electrophoresis can be replaced by a fast extraction technique involving the diisopropylether/HCL phase system.H.H.Knight Castro, C.E.Hissink, W.Vaalburg, J.H.

Hier soll besonders auf die Patientenvorbereitung, die Dosierung der Aktivit~tsmenge nach K@rperoberfl[che und die exakte Lagerung der Patienten eingegangen werden. Dieser Beitrag soll auBerdem zeigen, wie wichtig eine sorgf[itige nuklearmedizinische Diagnostik in der P~diatrie ist. R. 0chsenk~hn, J. Ruekgaber, S. Hack Universit~t Ulm, Abt. Nuklearmedizin. UIm/FRG SYSTEMBETREUUNG UND DATENMANAGEMENT IN EINER GROSSEN NUKLEARMEDIZINISCHEN ABTEILUNG Die komplexe eomputertechnisehe Ausr0stung elner modernen nuklearmedlzinischen Abtellung erfordert yon allen Mltarbeltern anwendungsorientlerte Grundkenntnisse. Diese reiehen abet meist weder zur technischen 0berwachung des Computereinsatzes noch zur L6sung neuer Probleme aus. Im Vortrag werden die wichtigoten Aufgaben eines medizinlschen Dokumentationsassistenten in der Position elneo Systemmanagers zusammengefagt. In unserer Abteilung wurde ein Computernetz mit drei VAX-Computern im Zentrum und neun nuklearmedizinischen Frontendprozessoren (HAXDELTA), sowie 50 Terminals an der Peripherie aufgebaut. Es besteht zu jeder Zeit die M6glichkeit des direkten Zugriffs auf die aktuellen, bzw. archivierten Administrations-und Bilddaten. In diesem Zusammenhang ergeben sich als konkrete Aufgaben des Systemmanagers: die Datenpflege, die 0berwachung des st6rungsfreien Betriebsablaufes und die L6sung auftretender Hard-und Softwarest6rungen wenn n6tig auch in Zusammenarbeit mit augenstehenden Firmen. Bedeutungsvoll ist zudem die Vermittlung zwiochen Reehnerwelt (Informatiker, Mathematiker) und nichtprofessionellen Computeranwendern (technlsche Assistenten, Arzte,Doktoranden). Dazu geh6rt u. a. die Sehaffung elner mSgliehst komfortablen Benutzeroberfl~che sowie die konstante Wissensvermittlung um Ber0hrungs-~ngste seitens der Anwender abzubauen. Dieser Einsatz des Systemmanagers erlaubt die Relation einer effizienten Nutzung des Systems bei m6glichst Eeringem Lernaufwand for einen breiten Anwenderkreis zu optimieren.",

The main reason for this is the enhanced interest shown by the orthopaedic surgeons, who have found the bone scan extremely helpful in a lot of different insults, be it traumatic, inflammatory, neoplastic or just bone pain of unknown origin.The bone scan is more sensitive than radiography but there is no contradiction between the methods which are assessing different parameters. The radiography is a static image of the mineral distribution and the bone scan is a functional image of the osteobiastic activity. Thus the bone scan shows: l) pathological changes earlier than the radiography, 2) if a lesion is active and has to be treated, or passive and can be negiected, 3) the whole skeleton, perfect for screening of malignant diseases. The diagnosis is usually based on both examinations and in some cases even supplemented by a bone marrow scan.The lecture will give a short survey of bone physiology, bone-scanning agents, the normal bone scan, imaging technique including 3-phase bone scan and examples of clinical application in different diseases.

Na-MBS and Na-HP appeared to be completely inefficacious as antoxidant in Tc-99m MDP, as important amounts of TcO 4-were formed rather soonly. On the other hand, the 3 organic stabilizing agents were found to prevent reoxidation of Tc-99m very efficiently, even in the lowest tested amount (0.5 mg). Up to 8 h after reconstitution with high activities of Tc-99m the amount of TcO Z did not exceed a few percents. After 24 h the radlochemical purity of the preparations contai~ing'PABA or AA was still >99% but 7% to 10% of TcO 4 was present in the vials containing GA.

Purification was performed by RP-HPLC on Hypersil ODS, eluted with an EtOH-phosphate buffer mixture. Radiochemical purity (RCP) was determined up to 8 h after preparation by a combination of TLC on ITLC-SG, eluted with acetone (determination of coll. Tc-ggm) and RP-HPLC eluted with EtOH-phosph. buffer gradient mixtures for detection of soluble impurities. Six commercial kits were labelled with 30 mCi of Tc-99m on consecutive days. The amount of colloidal Tc-99m was each time negligible.RCP varied from 89.5% to 96% immediately after preparation and was not significantly lower (< 2%) after 8 h. Radiochemical purity of II remained > 98% up to 8 h after isolation and was about 95% after 24 h. Biodistribution of I and II at 3 h after preparation was studied in mice (n=8) at lO min p.i., using 1-131 OIH as internal biological standard. The activity in the renal system (kidneys + urine) was slightly lower for I (ratio I/II = 0.95), whereas uptake of I in liver and intestines and its retention in blood was somewhat higher (ratio I/II~2). It is concluded that HPLC-purified Tc-99m MAG3 is superior to kit-formulated Tc-99m MAG3 and constitutes the most ideal preparation for renal function studies.However, the quality of kit-formulated Tc-ggm MAG3 is sufficient for clinical practice, even up to 8 h after reconstitution.

We have labelled G4 in high yield with Tc-99m in two ways, i.e. by direct labelling in alkaline medium (pH >lO) and by exchange labelling in the presence of tartrate at different pH values. RP-HPLC analysis of the reaction mixtures showed that direct labelling afforded over 95% of a Tc-99m compound (I) that remained stable in function of time.Its retention time (Rt) on HPLC was slightly shorter than that of Tc-99m MAG3 in the same conditions.Exchange labelling yielded a radiochemical species with identical Rt as I on HPLC, together with small amounts of side-products. Labelling of a I:I mixture of G4 and MAG3 with Tc-99m resulted in the formation of mainly Tc-99m MAG3, which indicates that the thiol containing ligand MAG3 (SN3 compound) forms Tc-complexes with higher stability than the tetrapeptide (N4 ligand). Biodistribution study of HPLC-purified Tc-99m G4 in mice showed that its urinary excretion is significantly lower and its hepatic uptake substantially higher as compared to Tc-99m MAG3. At 30 min p.i. stomach uptake was about 5% of I.D., probably due to the presence of TcO,-which is possibly formed by in vivo degradation of~he less stable Tc-G4 complex. It appears that tetrapeptides can easily be labelled with Tc-99m in high yield at room temperature. However, Tc-99m G4 has clearly less favourable renal characteristics than Tc-99m MAG3 and it is not suitable for renal function studies. Low radiation dose of 56 and 112 c~S given to mature female albino rats 1~d to diminution of the total estrogen(TE) and estradiol (EST) up to 24 hours,but a second peak of rise occured at 13 days with a second drop of a lesser magmitude on the 20-32 days following irradiation . Quantitative 99mTc -pertechentate sailography with citric acid s~imulation was performed in 48 patients with head and neck ~umors for studing early and delayed effects of~.irradiation on salivary glands. The shape of the time activity curves were classified into 3 grades according to the degree of radiation induced dysfunction. A ratio of pre-and post stimulation count (Rc) was applied in the major glands in relation to the radiation dose received and the volume of the glands included in the treatment. A slight rise of Re's is seen at 20 Gy and it was more evident in the group with partial glands irradiation.The radiation changes were more evident in parotids than submandibulars at 0-3 months and in dose range below 40 Gy. However ,a dose higher than 50 Gy after a peroid of 6-12 months lead to the maximum impairment of salivary function ,specially if all the glands involved in the radiation fields. On the contrary ,partial irradiation of the glands will lead to some degree of recovery in both glands at interval ranging from 30-60 months following irradiation. At our institution, a 4.7 Tesla/40 cm diameter nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) system was installed to evaluate its usefulness for detecting high energy phosphate compounds, like phosphocreatine or ATP in human organ transplants. This 4.7 Tesla NMR system is used for evaluating the viability of human organ transplants by P-31-MRS. For this reason, first, a special cooling system was developed based on an original transplant cooling box to allow for sterile continuous cooling and, at the same time, optimum technical conditions for NMR spectroscopy (MRS) with a 5 cm diameter double tuned 81/200MHz surface coil. P-31 spectra were obtained at 81MHz pulse frequency after optimum shimming at the frequency of protons at 200 MHz for each individual organ. It could be demonstrated that plegic human pancreas and liver transplants contain enough ATP as viability indicator to be measured by MRS.Twenty human cadaveric kidneys were studied prior to transplantation. In 65% ATP peaks were clearly identified. In conclusion, P-31-MRS in the set-up described offers great potential for estimating non-traumatically the preservation state of human transplant organs.The value of P-31-MRS in predicting transplant function for the recipient patient is examined in prospective studies. might be higher in the AIDS patients.This may be due to decreased cortical p~usion.",

Two patiunts used sulpiride (200 mg b.d. and 2000 rag/die), and one patient used trifluoroperazine (1 rag/die), whereas another patient was on ehloropromazine (100 rag i.d.s.). The patients were studied both on medication (SPET 1) and after a variable withdrawal interval flora raedieation (2-26 days; SPET 2).After injection of 185 MEq 1-123 IBZM the SME 810 brain toraograph was used to perform single slice dynamic SPET at 0-60 rain p.i. at the level of the basal ganglia, OML+25-30 n,n. This was followed by multislice SPET at 75-120 rain p.i. from OML-5 mm to OML+60 ram. Regions of interest were drawn for the basal ganglia, frontal cortex, and cerebellum using isocontour lines of radioactivity (eoums/pixel). During dynamic SPET the coeffieiem of steepness of the uprising slope of the basal gangiia/fi'ontat cortex (BG/FC) ratio (Slope BG/FC) was determined using linenr regression. During ranitisliee SPET both basal ganglia/cerebellum (BG/CB) and BG/FC ratios were determined, Significance P of the difference of these porameters in SPET 1 and SPET 2 in the 4 patients was determined using Student's 2-tuiled paired t-test The difference between the BG/CB and BGNC ratio in the patients both on (SPET 1) and off (SPET 2) neurolepties was not significant (P = 0.2 and P = 0.4, respectively). It is concluded that 1-123 IBZM SPET discriminates between patients on and off neuroleptios. Furthermore, the Slope BG/FC and the BG/CB and BG/FC ratios may be important parametem to monitor tiopamine D2-receptor oecupancy by these nemolepties. The higher BG/CB and BG/FC ratios in the patients after medication withdrawal as eorapared to the volunteer may be caused by dopamine D2-receptor upregdiation.

The stability of d,I-HM-PAO in aqueous media is of particular interest because if d,I-HM-PAO is stable it is possible to divide the HM-PAO kit before labeling by technetium and thus to get the benefit of reduced costs. Using proton NMR spectroscopy we have shown that d,I-HM-PAO is stable in water solution. It is known that (99mTc)d,I-HM-PAO is not stable in vitro and its forms hydrophilic decomposition products, We have applied first time NMR technique for observing the formation of the unknown decomposition product of (99Tc)d,I-HM-PAO in aqueous environment at pH i0. The conclusions are that NMR technique is an efficient tool for examining these kinds of reactions and d,I-HM-PAO can dissolved in water and it is stable for a very long time and can be labeled just before use. Successful radioimmunotherapy (RIT) of human cancer is currently restricted by a number of contributing factors. Clearly, an important component is the isotope selected for use and in the past a high reliance has been placed on the use of 131I due to its availability and simple chemistry of linkage. 11 lAg would be a superior therapeutic isotope because of its low gamma component (6%) and high beta yield. The objective of this study is to develop the methodology required to link lllAg to an anti-tumour antibody and then compare this and a conventional 1311 labelled preparation as RIT agents. The well characterised Mab 35 antibody has been chosen as a model system, l/lAg was generated by neutron irradiation of palladium at the PSI. Labelling of Mab 35 antibody was by insertion into free sulphydryl groups which were introduced into the antibody (2.6 groups per molecule) using the SPDP reagent. This approach resulted in rapid 1 r 111 1 \"ncorpo ation of Ag \"nto Mab 35 and a proportion of the incorporated l 1 lAg (80%) appeared to be bound in a stable fashion. Spontaneous incorporation of 11 lAg into intra-chain -SH groups in a non-substituted Mab 35 was observed but occurred more slowly and was not stable (only 25% of incorporated material remaining at 2 days). Present studies are directed at the in vitro and in vivo characterisation of 11 lAg labelled Mab 35.",

            "text": "A limitation of the newly introduced Tc-99m based myocardial perfusion imaging agents has been that they do not permit calculation of pulmonary uptake previously obtained from thallium 201 (Tl) imaging. Pulmonary Tl uptake is a recognized marker of stress induced LV dysfunction in patients with CAD. The purpose of this study was to determine whether pulmonary/myocardial (P/M) uptake ratios could be obtained with Tc-ggm MIBI, and if so, do they correlate to Tl P/M ratios and myocardial perfusion abnormalities.40 patients were investigated with Tc-9g MIBI. All patients performed maximal upright exercise and were imaged with SPECT. 22 were studied with MIBI and Tl imaging. P/M ratios were calculated in Tc-99 MIBI and Tl SPECT studies by published methods. The number of segments with abnormal perfusion (permanent & reversible) were totaled.There was no difference (p>O.05) in achieved rate~ pressure product and Watt between the 2 stress tests. Correlation between pulmonary uptake of Tl and MIBI was r=O.81, p<O.OOl for upper left lung uptake and r=0.87, p<O.O01 for lower right lung uptake. A highly significant correlation to number of myocardial segments with abnormal perfusion was seen (n:40, r=0.73, p<O.OO]).A pulmonary/myocardial ratio can indeed be obtained from Tc-ggm MIBI studies -analogous to Tl ratios. MIBI P/M ratios correlate to myocardial perfusion abnormalities. These findings dispel the original theory that P/M ratios can not be obtained from Tc-99m MIBI studies.",

Four patients were subject to intraprostatic injection of 1 mg FC3001 labelled with 85-100 MBq [In-ill] . The farmakokinetios were studied by sequential who!e-body counting, gamma-camera scintigraphy of pelvis and abdomen in AP and PA projections. Blood and urine samples were equally collected sequentially up to 72 hours after injection. The prostatic activity decreased with a half-life between 50.8 arid 197 hours.The blood concentration peaked shortly after injection and the antibody-fragments were cleared from the blood with a half-life of 21-24 hours. Only the liver accumulated antibody-fragments in significant amounts without reaching a peak value during the period of investigation. The normalized ac~tivity in the spleen and kidney varied and mostly paralleled background activity in the whole period of investigation. The urinary excretion varied between 30-35X of the injected dose in 78 hours. The antibody-fragments were not able to visualize known metastases with certainty in the four patients. However, in two patients small accumulations of activity close to the prostate were observed. Whether this activity represented specific binding to local metastases or unspecific accumulation in lymphnodes is not clear. That the known metastases were not seen may be caused by the slow release of antibody-fragments from the prostate. One of the drawbacks of classical 99Tc rn bone marrow scintigraphy (BMS) is its relatively low sensitivity, particularly in the detection of lesions in the lower thoracic (T9-T12) and higher lumbar (L1, L2) spirie. This is due to the high liver and spleen uptake of the nanocolloids (average size 60nm; 95% < 80 nm).In this work we describe the initial results of a novel approach to the imaging of the BM with a 99Tcm-label.The white blood ceils (WBC) of 5 patients were labelled with 99Tcm-HMPAO and reinjected intravenously in an antecubital vein. Whole body images were performed in an IGE gamma camera 3-4 hours post-injection. 2 patients referred with PUO and no evidence of bone infection were used as control. 1 patient had bilateral avascular necrosis of the head of the femur, l patient metastasis of Ca breast. 1 patient with Hodgkin's disease and Muhiple Myeloma has been referred for assessment of functional bone marrow after Mantle radiotherapy.The results show that BMS with HMPAO/WBC produces images of high quality (high spatial and contrast resolution, and high signal intensity) of the entire bone marrow, including the lower thoracic (T9-T12) and higher lumbar (L1, L2) spine. There is low uptake in the liver and higher uptake in the spleen. Femur/liver ratio is 0.06 for HMPAO/WBC and O.01 for nanocolloids. The spleen/liver ratio is 2.00 for HMPAO/WBC and 0.42 for nanocolloids.Bilateral avascular necrosis of the head of the femur was clearly seen as photopenic areas, as well as metastases, radiotherapy effects and relevant hyperplastic bone marrow was identified.Conclusion: HMPAO/WBC imaging of the bone marrow produces images of higher quality than those obtained with nanocolloids. In addition it has two major advantages: 1) lower liver uptake which interferes less with images of the spine; 2) lower effective dose equivalent (HMPAO/WBC 3.4 mSv; nanocolloids 6mSv). The aim of this study was to elucidate the value of IS in comparison to colloid scanning in the detection of BM-infiltration. Method: We studied a total of 23 pts, 10 with solid tumors and 13 pts with Hodgkin-or non-Hodgkin lymphema (stage I-IV). Sceletal scintigraphy, plane radiographs CT, MR and bone marrow biopsies were performed to confirm the skeletal lesions. The MAb BW 250/183 is directed against CEA and non-specific cross reacting antigen, exposed at the cellular membrane of peripheral granulocytes and myeZocytes in BM. Labeling procedure with Tc 99m was described by Schwarz and coworkers. Colloid scanning was done using a commercially available microcolloid kit (particle size<5g nm). 3 h after injection of 400 MBq of the Tc 99m labeled MAb and 1,5 h after application of the Tc 99m labeled colloid (400 MBq) planar scanning of the skeletal system with a gamma camera was performed. Results: IS showed s homogenous BM -and a moderate liverYspleen uptake with excellent visualization of a11 parts of the vertebral column. All 40 BM lesions detected by colloid scan were also seen by IS. However IS showed 17 additional BM lesions which were all confirmed by the diagnostic methods mentioned above. In 3 pts with recurrences of Hodgkin lymphoma and with case histories of radiation therapy, 12 BM lesions seen by IS and colloid scan were identified as fatty BM degeneration. In conclusion BM-IS with the MAb used is superior to colloid scanning. It is an excellent non-ivasive but unspecific method of excluding BM infiltrstion. Continuing the work with brain imaging tracers the iodo analog of SCH-23390 was labelled with 1-123. The substance is known to bind specifically to dopamine D1 receptors. Two different methods of labelling were investigated, namely electrophilic and nucleophilic substitution. Using the fn'st, the influence of different oxidants, reaction solutions and pH values on the labelling of deschloro SCH-23390, R(+) enantiomer, was investigated in detail. With IODO-GEN and PBS (pH 7.4) the best labelling yield was obtained. The reaction mixture was purified by RP-18 HPLC. The product fraction was worked up to give after sterile filtration a ready for use radiopharmaceutical. The second method used was halogen exchange with a Cu(I) catalyst in acidic and reducing conditions and the Br analog of SCH-23390 as precursor. The enantiomers of the precursor had to be separated on a Chiracell OD column. The advantages of the second method are the def'med labelling position, no byproducts and the virtually quantitative labelling yield. The pharmacokinetics of the 1-123 analog of SCH-23390 were tested in female spf Wistar rats 10, 30, 60 and 180 min p.i. The ratio of the whole brain/blood decreased in this time from 1.23 to 0.5. The main excretion path was through liver and intestine. The stomach showed an increasing uptake. The lungs and kidneys had in contrast to the other organs a high original uptake followed by a fast wash out. Binding and displacement studies with rat striatum proved the specific binding to this tissue. Clinical trials will begin shortly.",

The biochemical aetiology is unknown but it has been suggested that the basal ganglia are implicated in the pathophysiology of GTS. CT scanning shows no consistent structural abnormality.We studied 25 GTS patients with high resolution gamma camera HMPAO/SPET, paying particular attention to the perfnsion of the basal ganglia. All patients had a wide range of motor and vocal \"tics\", and ages from 7 to 48 years. 6 were female. A bank of 10 normal HMPAO/SPET studies were used as control.HMPAO/SPET was carried out with the IGE 400AC/STARCAM system using routine protocols for acquisition, reconstruction and analysis of the data. 10 MBq/kg (patient weight) of HMPAO was injected (i.v.) after a full explanation of the procedure and written consent signed. This study was approved by the local ethical committee.Qualitative analyisis of transverse.0nd coronal slices revealed, for all patients, a significant decrease in the tracer concentration in the basal ganglia nd thalami. There were perfusion deficits identifiable in the cortex of the frontal and particularly the temporal lobes. Semi-quantitative analysis with normalisation for the cerebellum confn'med these findings.Conclusion: for the first time perfusion deficits are shown with high resolution gamma camera HMPAO/SPET in the basal gaglia of patients with GTS, which may help to explain the extrapyramidal motor and vocal abnormalities found in these patients.",
