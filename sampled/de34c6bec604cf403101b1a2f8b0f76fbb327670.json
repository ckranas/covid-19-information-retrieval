The glomerulus enlarges in response to obesity-induced elevation of renal plasma flow due to dilation mainly or solely of the afferent arteriole and constriction of the efferent arteriole by Agt2 and aldosterone that increases glomerular filtration rate and hence the amount of filtered and subsequently reabsorbed sodium and engenders a stable or slowly progressive proteinuria, which defines obesity-related glomerulopathy. Angiotensin-2 (obesity-mediated overactivation of the renin-angiotensin axis), insulin, 53 the renal sympathetic nervous system, 54 increased postglomerular oncotic pressure due to increased filtration fraction, and mechanosensors of tubular flow rate raise tubular sodium reabsorption. Insulin-PI3K-PKB and TOR signaling are implicated in podocyte hypertrophy [809] . 55 In the kidney, adipokines and altered metabolism of fatty acid and cholesterol and resulting lipid accumulation 56 provoke insulin resistance in podocytes, tubular hypertrophy), but at a lower rate than the increase in glomerular tuft volume, and the podocyte density declines. Because the glomerular volume expands, stress and strain exerted on these cells can detach them and cause a local denudation of the glomerular basement membrane. In addition, approximately 50% of patients with obesity-related glomerulopathy, a hyperfiltering nephropathy that does not manifest the typical signs of the nephrotic syndrome (hyperlipidemia, hypoalbuminemia, and edema) have mild diabetoid changes (focal or diffuse increase in the mesangial matrix and thickening of the glomerular basement membrane). Intracellular lipid vacuoles can accumulate in mesangiocytes, podocytes, and proximal tubular epitheliocytes. 53 Hyperinsulinemia secondary to insulin resistance increases the tubular reabsorption of sodium, as insulin stimulates epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity in the late distal tubule and, to a lesser extent, in the proximal tubule and loop of Henle. 54 Three factors associated with obesity activate the renal sympathetic nervous system: high leptin concentration, low adiponectin concentration, and obstructive sleep apnea [809] . 55 Podocytes possess insulin receptor and can adjust their morphology to postprandial changes in intracapillary pressure and glomerular filtration rate. Accumulation of non-esterified fatty acids in podocytes is linked to insulin resistance and podocyte apoptosis [809] . Insulin activates TORC1 via the PI3K-PKB axis and hence lipogenesis via PPAR\u03b3 and SREBP1, angiogenesis via HIF1 and VEGF, and cell growth via S6K and 4eBP1.

Nutrients and growth factors activate TORC2, which provokes actin remodeling via PKC\u03b1, Rho, and Rac and supports cell survival via FoxO1 and sodium reabsorption via the SGK1-ENaC axis [809] . Insulin also stimulates VEGF production in podocytes. Podocytes undergo hypertrophy via TOR to cover the enlarging glomerular tuft associated with excess weight. Once it is activated by TORC2, PKB2 favors podocyte survival. 56 Renal TG accumulation results from increased fatty acid synthesis mediated by SREBP1c, which promotes the formation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, FAS, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase SCD1, in addition to CHREBP, which upregulates production of liver pyruvate kinase [809] . Moreover, SREBP1 upregulates expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFSF1, IL1\u03b2, and Ifn\u03b3, which activate SREBP1, hence engendering a vicious cycle.

It is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [946] . At least in adult mice, it is required to generate new neurons. It is a cofactor for various transcription factors. In macrophages, it represses the activity of NF\u03baB. Hepatic overexpression of BTG1 reduces hepatic steatosis in db/db mice, a model of obesity. The BTG1 factor is inhibited by the ATF4 factor, which is implicated in glucose metabolism, autophagy, apoptosis, ER stress, and inflammation, especially in the liver and WAT. Conversely, overexpression of ATF4 precludes BTG1 action. It protects against diet-induced hepatic steatosis, as it regulates hepatic lipid metabolism and prevents activity of ATF4 and SCD1, the rate-limiting enzyme, in the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids. This FoxO3a target suppresses transcription of the gene encoding stearoyl-CoA desaturase SCD1, which is involved in fatty acid synthesis [946] . A high-carbohydrate diet favors BTG1 production via the TOR-S6K1-CREB pathway. 176 This phosphorylation (at Ser53) occurs in the liver of fed mice and insulin-stimulated hepatocytes, only if Med17 is not previously phosphorylated by P38MAPK, which is activated during fasting [945] . 177 Lipin-1 is also a transcriptional coregulator that enhances fatty acid oxidation via PPAR\u03b1 and PGC1\u03b1 [947] .

It can launch cAMP production by AC via the Gs subunit, Ca 2+ mobilization, and G-protein-independent ERK1/2 signaling. Glucagon-like peptide-1 and oxyntomodulin initiate ligand-directed signaling. Ligand-determined signaling, i.e., ligand-induced differential signaling, refers to functional selectivity, i.e., the ability of different ligands (full and partial agonists, inverse agonists, antagonists, and allosteric modulators) of a given receptor to elicit distinct cellular responses due to ligand-and effector-binding specificity of the receptor. In other words, receptors trigger biased signaling, a given agonist preferentially activating a given signaling cascade over others (biased agonism). Biased GPCR agonists distinctly activate signaling pathways with different potencies, whereas unbiased agonists activate these pathways with equal efficiency. In addition, biased ligands stabilize receptor conformations that differ from those primed by unbiased ligands. Distinct biased ligands of the same receptor can stabilize different receptor conformations, which engage different intracellular effectors. Multiple subtypes of G proteins can be engaged with distinct efficacies and kinetics and different types of GPCR ligands and allosteric modulators bias the G-protein coupling, which then depends not only on messenger type but also on the relative amounts of the GPCR subunits and intracellular regulators. Gprotein-coupling profiles of GPCRs are related to the variety of \u03b1 (16 subtypes with distinct properties), \u03b2, and \u03b3 subunits of G proteins, a given receptor being coupled with multiple types of G protein subunits with varying potency and kinetics [1039] . Furthermore, GPCRs trigger canonical and alternative signaling cascades. They signal not only via heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins but also via other effectors such as \u03b2-arrestins. Biased ligands selectively change the propensity of GPCR coupling to either G proteins or \u03b2-arrestin. On the one hand, liganded GPCRs are phosphorylated by kinases and connect to arrestin, which triggers GPCR desensitization and endocytosis, thereby hindering G-protein coupling with the receptor. Arrestin attracts adaptors and clathrin for GPCR internalization and desensitization. Nevertheless, inhibition of endocytosis does not reduce the initial cAMP production, but the later cAMP accumulation, agonistbound GPCR signaling, such as that primed by Gs-coupled \u03b22-adrenoceptor, PTH, TSH, sphingosine 1-phosphate, and dopamine, continuing once it is internalized after a short delay (arrestin-based endocytic signaling) [1040] . On the other hand, G-protein-independent signaling uses arrestin, which recruits and activates the ERK cascade. \u03b2-Arrestin thus generates its own signaling via the cRaf-MAP2K-ERK axis when the GPCR-Arr complex resides on endosomes (arrestin-based cortical signaling). Arrestin tethers to GPCRs according to two modes [1041] . Stable binding of arrestin to phosphorylated amino acids in the intracellular loop of the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, which persists for minutes after agonist removal, upregulates ERK, whereas transient binding of arrestin to the unphosphorylated receptor lessens ERK signaling, as it attracts a protein phosphatase.
