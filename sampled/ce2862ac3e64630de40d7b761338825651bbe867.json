            "text": "Vajont dam was an important industrial project for post-war Italy. A general plan was proposed for the erection of seven dams in Piave valley, but from the beginning of the Vajont dam development, the project met with fierce resistance from local communities protesting against the forced sale of land to Societ\u00e0 Adriatica di Elettricit\u00e0 (SADE) to construct the highest arch dam in the world. SADE, a private electricity company in North-Eastern Italy, had support from Democrazia Cristiana (the Italian Christian democratic political party, which promoted pro-American and pro-capitalist ideology and was in power at the time). Opposition from locals in villages around the Vajont reservoir was suppressed by the police. After this, the Italian Communist Party, the main opponent of Democrazia Cristiana, stayed on the side of local residents and supported their struggle against SADE and the government during the construction of the dam. 2 Engineers and geologists focused on the permeability of the Vajont dam foundation, but did not study carefully the geology and the stability of the slopes surrounding the upstream reservoir of the dam, which consisted of soft materials like sand, limestone and clay. 3 The geological instability of the surrounding mountains was well known among local residents 4 : Mt. Toc had many nicknames like \"crazy\", \"rotten\", \"loose\" or \"walking mountain\" among local people due to its propensity for huge unexpected landslides. 5,6 The construction of the dam was launched in January 1957 with the goal of completing it by 1959 (construction started without government approval, nor serious geological research of the surrounding mountains). Moreover, to meet the need of Italian industry for electricity and maximize the profitability of the project, SADE proposed to increase the height of the dam up to 722.5 m, and triple the volume of the reservoir. In June 1957, government approval was obtained for construction without a geological study of the consequences of expanding the reservoir.",

            "text": "The Vajont hydropower station dam and reservoir was located at the foot of Mt. Toc in the Dolomite region of the Italian Alps. In October 1963, a large landslide of 260 million m 3 of rock (equivalent of cube with a 650 m side) filled the reservoir of the dam, initiating a 150-250 m high wave, which overtopped the dam and wiped out several villages in the nearby Piave valley, resulting in the death of at least 1921 people. 1 recur in the Vajont region: \"when there is water in the reservoir, the mountain will fall down and cause a tragedy\". 7 (Later SADE filed a lawsuit against the journalist for \"disclosure of false, exaggerated and biased information aimed at disturbing public order\" 8 and \"defamation and spreading false information\" 9 ). After the Pontesei dam accident, SADE ordered German and Italian geologists to investigate the geology of mountains around the dam. After several months, they confirmed a potential instability in the southern slope of the reservoir: the possible volume of a landslide could exceed 200 million m 3 if the reservoir was filled completely due to undercutting of the foundation by an ancient landslide. They passed on information about a possible rockslide to the architect and the chief engineer of the Vajont system, who asked them to moderate some of the report conclusions and suggested testing these hypotheses with another round of studies. 10 These more detailed studies stated that the evidence of an ancient landslide was absent, the slope was potentially immovable and only a small landslide could occur. 11 Apparently, any geological survey demonstrating the dangers of further exploitation of the Vajont system was unacceptable for the engineering team, SADE and the government, which was promoting the Vajont arch dam as the highest in the world and as a historic masterpiece of Italian engineering. Frankly admitting that there were errors in the design could lead to question how safely the government was expanding Italian industry. It could also attract attention to its control over private companies. This could change the political landscape, with the Communists using any blunder for political capital. 12 It would also cause losses for SADE and bring their shares down in the market. Nobody among the managerial team wanted to take responsibility for this honest but painful recognition of the dangers.",

            "text": "In February 1960, SADE started filling the reservoir. In the process, small landslides were noticed. On November 4, 1960, when the water level reached 636 m above sea level after weeks of heavy rains, a 0.7 million m 3 landslide occurred creating a 2-m wave. SADE geologists revealed a direct correlation between the water level in the reservoir and movement in the southern slope of the lake. They proposed to bring down the level of the reservoir to reduce the observed increasing shift of the southern slope. When the level dropped to 600 m, the movement of land mass went down from 3 cm to 1 mm per day. During 1961, the construction of a bypass tunnel kept the level of the reservoir down to around 600 m, and there were no serious landslides (even during the cold winter of [1961] [1962] . In 1961, SADE sponsored a hydraulic study of worst-case scenarios using a simulation model of the reservoir and the dam (1/200 of real size) at Padua University. In July 1962, the results of this research showed that the maximum likely wave from a landslide up to a volume of 40 million m 3 would not exceed 25 m, if the minimum sliding duration was 1.5 min 13 ; in reality, the volume of the final rockslide was 260 million m 3 , the slide lasted only 45 s and the height of the wave generated was 150-250 m. The geologists assumed that keeping the maximum water level of the reservoir below 700 m would prevent a possible landslide wave from overtopping the dam crest. There is no documented evidence that the results of the hydraulic study and the possibility of a 25-m wave were transmitted to the government, local authorities, residents or onsite staff at the dam and hydropower station. Supporting such interpretation is the fact that, right before the disaster, SADE personnel and their families had not left the nearby city of Longarone, which was perceived by local residents as a sign that there was no serious threat. After the disaster, it was revealed that the inspectors of the dam and the commissions responsible for regulation of hydropower industry never received any final reports-in particular they never received the studies by geologists who had identified the fault. Nor did they see any of the results from the model tests or their ensuing recommendations, which emphasized the importance of the water level of the retention dam. 14 Moreover, some sources claim that the vice-president of SADE decided not to communicate about the seismic activity registered by the seismographic station at the dam, and even deleted some records about serious tremors in his reports to government officials. 15 In 1960, political debates began about the possible advantages for Italy of the nationalization of 1270 electricity companies and the creation of uniform standards for the use of electrical infrastructure. Nationalization could reduce the selling price of electricity for industrial and retail customers. Intensive discussions about nationalization occurred during 1960-1962. To increase their profits before nationalization, senior managers of SADE decided to fill the reservoir up to 700 m by the end of 1962; the velocity of ground movement increased as a response from 1 mm to 1.5 cm per day. 16 Finally in December 1962, ENEL (the Italian National Agency for Electric Energy) was established and united all private players, 13 Ibid. 14 ",

Four years later, the court found 11 executives of ENEL/SADE and government officials guilty. Unfortunately, thirty years after the Vajont dam disaster, a quite similar cover up of local geological instability and faulty design at Val Di Stava led to the collapse of another Italian dam in 1985, which resulted in 268 deaths. 23 to concentrate on safety-related operational problems. As for the four principal U.S. manufacturers of reactors (\"vendors\") -General Electric, Westinghouse, Combustion Engineering, and B&Wwe found a great deal of variation in the extent to which they monitor at their own expense operating problems in the plants they have built, after those plants are tested and turned over to the utilities that have purchased them. And the relationship between the vendor and its utility customer after operation of a plant begins is largely determined by the individual utility's choice of how much technical assistance it is willing to buy from the vendor on an ongoing, contract basis. Moreover, there is no requirement that utilities report failure data to the vendors\u2026 [A] lthough NRC requirements result in a great deal of material on reactor operations being generated and sent to the NRC by the utilities, this information has not been systematically reviewed to extract potentially important safety problems or trends\u2026 The situation is made more complex because the reporting requirements differ from plant to plant: incidents reportable at some plants do not have to be reported at others. As a result, the NRC is flooded with a mass of undifferentiated data on reactor operations\u2026 NRC publishes a computerized listing of [Licensee Event Reports] , each described in a few sentences at most, and a periodical called 'Current Events-Power Reactors' containing more detailed descriptions of major problems\u2026 The lessons learned from malfunctions and mistakes at nuclear plants both here and abroad were never effectively shared within the industry\u2026 Coordination among these parties and between them and the NRC, as well as within the NRC, is inadequate\". 61 This report was openly published in 1980-but remarkably, Soviet energy industry regulators did not learn the lessons of TMI: no system was established to continuously transmit detailed information about incidents occurring at Soviet nuclear and hydropower plants, so operators remained unaware of the risks. Decades later this lack of communication led to disasters.",

            "text": "There were more than 750 alarms in the control room at TMI-2, and when multi-factor malfunction occurred in the early morning of March 28, 1979, more than 100 of these alarms immediately went off. 62 Operators there recalled that the console was \"lit up like a Christmas tree\". 63 The control room's alarm printer was overloaded: it could type one line every 4 s, but several alarms per second were occurring during the first few minutes. 64 Moreover, there was no system to prioritize alarms, so operators could not trace back the sequence of emergency events in time to make decisions adequately. In addition, the control room and instrumentation were designed for normal, not conditions when an accident occurs. 65 The control room was far too large and there was no orderly grouping of instruments by function-in particular, emergency controls and instruments were not sited in a common location. 66 For the four TMI-2 operators, it was difficult to run the plant based on information from instruments that were not designed to show, for example, how much water covered the core, or which quickly went off scale, as was the case with the radiation-monitoring equipment. 67 The infamous PORV alarms were on a panel remote from the central console and facing away from the operators, and the indicator light on the control panel for the PORV was wired to show only what the valve had been \"instructed\" by the electrical system to do, not the valve's actual position. 68, 69 This combination of circumstances misled the operators, who did not realize that the PORV had been open for 2 h and 19 min and that the plant had lost a critical amount of coolant. A year before the accident, a TMI-2 operator had informed Met Ed management about the problem: \"The alarm system in the control room is so poorly designed that it contributes little in the analysis of a casualty. The other operators and myself have several suggestions on how to improve our alarm system-perhaps we can discuss them sometime, preferably before the system as it is causes severe problems\". 70 The company made several improvements on TMI-1, but nothing had been done on TMI-2 at the time of the accident. Also the operators of the plant-despite having a rigorous background of working on nuclear submarines for the US Navy-had never been trained to understand all the plant parameters, and lacked theoretical knowledge of the operating principles of a pressurized water reactor. 71 After the accident, the NRC concluded: \"Not all utilities [in the United States had] either as large an engineering staff or executives with appropriate backgrounds to enable them to direct actual plant operations during emergencies\u2026 [Nevertheless,] we have concluded that the utility [Met Ed] , in terms of technical capability, is as good as the median nuclear utility\". 72 Investigators ruled out any deliberate withholding of information: \"However, based on the evidence, we could not conclude that the causes of this breakdown in information flow went beyond confusion, poor communications, and a failure by those in the control room, including NRC and B&W employees, to comprehend or interpret the available information, a failing shared to some extent by offsite organizations as well. A number of factors other than deliberate attempts to downgrade the seriousness of the situation could have accounted for the failure of the control room crew to communicate critical information. The failure to recognize and act on significant data in our view demonstrates a lack of technical competency by site employees to diagnose and cope with an accident. Moreover, the inability of the utility's management to comprehend the severity of the accident and communicate it to the NRC and the public was a serious failure of the company's management. [Nevertheless,] there is no evidence to show willful withholding of information by Met Ed from NRC\". 73 The NRC investigation also outlined the atmosphere among TMI-2 staff at the time of the accident: \" [N] o one appears to be theorizing about the cause of the increased radiation levels in the plant. No one postulates an uncovered core. If anyone is thinking such thoughts, he is keeping them to himself\u2026 Intellect tells them they don't really know what is going on; ego tells them none of the rest of these guys do either; on the evidence, both are right\u2026 Understanding what is happening to the core itself will not come until much, much later\". 74 Another important factor influencing the misreading of the situation by operators and management at TMI-2 was a prevailing mindset about the impossibility of a meltdown on the plant: \" [The] inability to recognize and comprehend the full significance of the information, and certain psychological factors: the difficulty of accepting a completely unexpected situation, the fear of believing that the situation was as bad as the instruments suggested, and a strong desire to focus on getting the reactor stable again rather than dwelling on the severity of the accident\". 75 For example, TMI station manager Gary Miller testified that \"I don't believe in my mind I really believed the core had been totally uncovered, or Group arrived at TMI-2 and started to blueprint solutions to the core-cooling problem. 86 In its turn, the President's commission declared that the NRC was not ready to conduct adequate response measures in such a situation: \"[W]e are extremely critical of the role [the NRC] played in the response to the accident\u2026 During the most critical phase of the accident, the NRC was working under extreme pressure in an atmosphere of uncertainty. The NRC staff was confronted with problems it had never analyzed before and for which it had no immediate solutions\". 87 According to the NRC investigation: \"They have no time to assess the situation themselves\". 88 The inadequate NRC assessment of the plant's status-based on information from the utility and mistakes in estimates of the hydrogen bubble size-led to correspondingly inadequate response measures: \"On the first day of the accident, there was an attempt by the utility to minimize its significance, in spite of substantial evidence that it was serious. Later that week, NRC was the source of exaggerated stories. Due to misinformation, and in one case (the hydrogen bubble) through the commission of scientific errors, official sources would make statements about radiation already released\u2026 The response to the emergency was dominated by an atmosphere of almost total confusion. There was lack of communication at all levels\u2026 The fact that too many individuals and organizations were not aware of the dimensions of serious accidents at nuclear power plants accounts for a great deal of the lack of preparedness and the poor quality of the response\u2026 Communications were so poor [more than 48 hours from the accident] that the senior management could not and did not develop a clear understanding of conditions at the site. As a result, an evacuation was recommended to the state by the NRC senior staff on the basis of fragmentary and partially erroneous information. \u2026 The President asked us to investigate whether the public's right to information during the emergency was well served. Our conclusion is again in the negative\". 89 The situation was aggravated by the fact that many decision makers were informed about the accident not by Met Ed managers or emergency agencies, but by media news representatives. An example of this is Paul Doutrich, at the time the mayor of Harrisburg-the state capital of Pennsylvania situated at about 15 km from TMI. He only found out about the accident when a radio station in Boston called him 5 h and 15 min after the beginning of the accident-despite the fact that a general emergency had been declared after 3 h and 24 min because of high radiation levels within the containment building: \"They asked me what we were doing about the nuclear emergency. My response was, 'What nuclear emergency?' They said, 'Well, at Three Mile Island.' I said, 'I know nothing about it'\". 90 Around the same time, the NRC notified the White House about the event at Three Mile Island. Seven hours after the accident, Robert Reid-mayor of Middletown, a small city located near TMI-called the Met Ed headquarters in Reading, who assured him that there was no escape of radioactive particles; but 20 s later, when he turned on the radio, he heard that radioactive particles had been released. Around the same time, William Scranton, Pennsylvania's Lieutenant Governor, said in a briefing with press representatives that \"The Metropolitan Edison Company has informed us that there has been an incident at Three Mile Island, Unit-2. Everything is under control. There is and was no danger to public health and safety\u2026 There was a small release of radiation to the environment. All safety equipment functioned properly\". 91 The President's Commission report described this incident: \"While some company executives were acknowledging radiation readings off the Island, low-level public relations officials at Met Ed's headquarters continued \u2026 to deny any off-site releases [8 hours after the accident]. It was an error in communications within Met Ed, one of several that would reduce the utility's credibility with public officials and the press. 'This was the first contradictory bit of information that we received and it caused some disturbance'\u2026 'I think they were defensive,' Scranton told the Commission in his testimony\". 92 Another such discrepancy on the third day after the accident showed that top management at Met Ed were still not coordinating the measures they were taking within their own organization: journalists were aware that the radioactivity released during the dumping of wastewater from TMI-2 into the Susquehanna River had been reported at 1200 millirems per hour, but Met Ed's vice president for power generation was not. During the regular press briefing, the vice president revealed data referring to a radiation level of 300 to 350 millirems per hour. This provoked suspicion that Met Ed was trying to conceal the real radiation reading, but the vice president declared that he had not heard the number 1200 and let drop: \"I don't know why we need to tell you each and every thing that we do specifically\". 93 Consequently the NRC concluded that: \"The TMI accident was a first of a kind for the nuclear power industry. Neither the utility nor the NRC was prepared to cope with the public's need for information. As a result, the residents around TMI were unduly confused and alarmed, and the level of anxiety nationwide about the safety of nuclear plants was unnecessarily raised. The information Met Ed and NRC provided to the news media during the course of the TMI accident was often inaccurate, incomplete, overly optimistic, or ultraconservative. Errors in judgment by Met Ed and NRC officials were major contributors to the inadequate public information effort at TMI\u2026 At the same time, the NRC failed to coordinate its internal flow of public information, resulting in speculative reports from Washington which conflicted with statements made by NRC to officials in Harrisburg. The NRC made the problem of conflicting reports even worse by refusing to participate in joint press conferences with the utility. The State's public information effort, which relied almost entirely on information from Met Ed and later the NRC, suffered accordingly. While both the public information performance of Met Ed and the NRC can be faulted in many instances, we found no evidence that officials from either the utility or the regulatory agency willfully provided false information to the press or public\". 94 According to a White House representative \"many conflicting statements about TMI-2 reported by the news media were increasing public anxiety\". 95 The invisibility of radiation also aggravated the perception of the accident by local residents: \"Never before have people been asked to live with such ambiguity. The TMI accidentan accident we cannot see or taste or smell \u2026is an accident that is invisible. I think the fact that it is invisible creates a sense of uncertainty and fright on the part of people that may well go beyond the reality of the accident itself \". 96 In addition, nationwide public nervousness during the accident was likely intensified by the Hollywood blockbuster \"The China Syndrome\". The movie was introduced at cinemas all over the country 12 days before Three Mile Island. The plot was about an accident at a fictitious nuclear power plant near Los Angeles. In the film, the investigation that followed revealed massive cover-ups during construction of the plant, and deliberate attempts by the plant's management to conceal facts from the public. Remarkably, in one scene of the movie, a physicist is trying to evaluate the possible consequences of a total reactor core meltdown, and says that \"an area the size of Pennsylvania\" would be permanently uninhabitable. 97 Many of the 400 reporters who had arrived at TMI were under the influence of this movie, and assessed unintentionally misleading statements by Met Ed and the NRC as deliberate risk concealment. The President's Commission also mentioned that \"[a]nother severe problem was that even personnel representing the major national news media often did not have sufficient scientific and engineering background to understand thoroughly what they heard, and did not have available to them people to explain the information. This problem was most serious in the reporting of the various releases of radiation and the explanation of the severity (or lack of severity) of these releases\u2026 We therefore conclude that, while the extent of the coverage was justified, a combination of confusion and weakness in Three Mile Island Nuclear Accident: Why Risks Were Concealed \u2022 The US government and the NRC shared an interest in developing the domestic civil nuclear industry, as part of a larger program to ensure the energy independence of the country after the severe oil crises of 1973 and 1979. This led to a perception among industry executives that increasing the production of electricity took priority over safety matters. \u2022 Wishful thinking/self-deception among decision makers, who persuaded themselves that minor accidents did not merit close scrutiny; that the probability of a multi-factor malfunction of hardware was marginal; that the influence of human factors on the operation of a reactor during an emergency was minimal; and that the worst-case scenario-meltdown or decapsulation of a reactor vessel-could never happen. \u2022 Government and the nuclear industry had weak control over the complex systems involved, and had only a fragmentary perception of the whole picture of risks. Key decision makers were ignorant of other accidents or near-miss cases within the organization or the wider industry, nationally or abroad. \u2022 There was no system for managing knowledge about risks within the industry (exchange, accumulation, systematization and transmission). \u2022 There was no industry-wide risk assessment system for timely evaluation of the condition of nuclear power plants. Both operators and management at TMI-2 misjudged the status of the plant, causing them to give misleading information to other audiences and delaying the measures that needed to be taken to cool the reactor.",

            "text": "In 1969, Union Carbide Corporation (UCC), an American company, opened a pesticide plant in Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh state, India). In the early years, the plant produced pesticides extracted from US-imported concentrate. However, the Indian government pushed UCC to organize a full-cycle chemical output at the Bhopal plant. They motivated UCC to hire, train and develop local staff for the management of the plant, and allowed it to own 50.9 % of its Indian branch (Union Carbide India Ltd (UCIL)) while reserving less than 50 % for Indian businesses and local investors. This was an exception granted to UCC to the norm imposed at that time by the Indian government that it should own more than 50 % of the shares of any foreign investment. 106 Such exception made Union Carbide Corporation with headquarters in the United States clearly responsible for all matters concerning the Indian plant. In 1979, UCIL launched production of an insecticide called carbaryl pesticide under the trademark SEVIN, using locally produced methyl isocyanide (MIC). UCC invested reluctantly in MIC production in India because the cost of local production exceeded US costs by a factor of 3 to 4. Due to severe droughts in India in 1977 India in , 1982 India in and 1984 , and the resulting decline in demand for pesticide from local farmers, the Bhopal plant became unprofitable (up to $4 M losses from 1980 to 1984). By 1982, the plant was working at just 50 % of its capacity, and by 1984 just 20 %. 107 In spite of the fact that more than 20 Indian engineers were flown to the USA in 1978-1979 at the UCC's West Virginia MIC plant to learn how to run the MIC process safely, there were at least five major chemical leaks-in which one worker died and close to 50 were injured-at the Bhopal plant between 1981 and 1984. 108 Moreover, due to the policy of the Indian government to have 100 % replacement of all positions in industry by Indians, the last American engineer left the Bhopal plant by the end of 1982. 109 From that time, the plant was operated only by Indian citizens and employed around 650 people. In 1982, UCC began to put pressure on the management of UCIL to reduce production costs, that resulted in decrease of morale at the plant: \"There was widespread belief among employees that the management had taken drastic and imprudent measures to cut costs and that attention to details that ensure safe operation was absent\". 110,111 UCIL started to extend the time between full safety checks from every 6 months to every 12 months and, instead of replacing rusted pipes by stainless pipes every 6 months, they replaced them by common steel pipes every 2 years. 112 UCIL fired the best trained and most experienced (and therefore most highly paid) engineers and hired lower paid staff with little experience of working with dangerous chemicals and equipment (for instance, the chemical engineer, who was responsible for managing the MIC unit \"resigned because he disapproved of falling safety standards\" one year before the disaster and an electrical engineer replaced him 113 ); and the length of training courses declined from 6 to 2 months. 114 Thirty percent of the staff at the Bhopal plant were fired and, for several years, turnover of staff at the plant exceeded 80 %; by December 1984, only a negligible number of employees remained who had been trained in the United States on the original MIC unit. 115, 116 In addition, the managers of UCIL decided to reduce the number of workers in every shift on the MIC unit: only one manager and six workers were required on a given shift in spite of UCC stating that they should keep three supervisors and twelve workers on each shift on the MIC unit. 117 Despite these desperate attempts to economize, the SEVIN production plant remained unprofitable, and UCC had plans to sell the plant or disassemble it and ship it to Brazil and Indonesia. 118 By the autumn of 1984, plant operators were ordered to produce SEVIN from the remaining stocks of chemicals in anticipation of the possible shutdown of the plant in the near future; the MIC production unit had been halted six weeks prior to the incident. As a result, the plant accumulated a large amount of MIC in its tankers: stocks of this lethal chemical reached 62 tons, of which only 3-4 tons were required daily for production of SEVIN. It was in contravention of common practice in the chemical industry, which is to \"always keep only a strict minimum of dangerous materials on site\". 119 Due to cost cuts on refrigeration, the MIC mixture began to be stored at the plant at temperatures of nearly 20 \u00b0C, while technical requirements for the mixture required it to be stored below 5 \u00b0C in order to avoid uncontrolled reactions. At the same time, plant managers had updated the settings of temperature alarm activation, so that operators did not receive early warnings of the temperature rise in the MIC tanks. 120 To make matters worse, on 31 October 1984, Indira Gandhi, the 3rd Prime Minister of India, was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards-and during the massive social riots that followed, the plant could not safely produce SEVIN from its tremendous stocks of MIC. In November 1984, the Indian government announced nearly two weeks of national mourning and brought in a curfew to stop communal and religious violence in the country. Consequently, workers on the second and third shifts at the Bhopal plant had trouble fulfilling their duties and production of SEVIN from existing MIC stocks was slow. 121 For many years, Bhopal was considered an attractive place to get a job, and many poor people from the countryside moved to the city and seized empty land to build slums. The population of Bhopal increased from 300,000 at the end of the 1960s to 900,000 in the mid 1980s. 122 Local authorities were reluctant to fight illegal land grabbing and construction and, as a result, shantytowns built up around the plant. During an inspection of the plant in 1979, UCC engineers emphasized that their Indian colleagues should build a complex contingency plan to respond to a possible leak, however small, of hazardous MIC. UCIL managers said that there was a contingency plan but, as the investigation following the 1984 disaster revealed, the city and state governments were not aware of any such plans. 123 In spite of the possible threat of MIC to human health, and a series of MIC-related accidents, management at the Bhopal plant never informed the authorities about these risks to the city. However, plant workers complained several times to the government of the Madhya Pradesh state about poor safety conditions on the plant, but the resulting inspections did not lead to a halt in production at the plant, because the involved state government representatives had insufficient technical experience of the chemical industry. 124 In 1982, UCC again sent American engineers to inspect the plant at Bhopal. They found many shortcomings in the safety system and recommended UCIL to fix them. During the following years, UCIL was sending reassuring reports to UCC about safety measures, but some of these were either temporary or were never fully implemented across the plant. 125 1984. 126 In September 1984, UCC engineers reported the following to UCC management in a survey on operational safety and health: \"There is a concern that a runaway reaction could occur in one of the MIC unit storage tanks and that response to such a situation would not be timely or effective enough to prevent catastrophic failure of the tank\"-but investigators could not find any proof that this information was transmitted to the Bhopal plant, where the design of the MIC unit was similar to that at the West Virginia plant. 127, 128 On December 2, 1984 , the plant and MIC unit were manned by incompetent staff. The safety systems installed were inadequate in the face of the existing amount of dangerous materials (more than 60 tons of MIC). Poor and low-cost maintenance over years had led to the progressive destruction of the integrity of the plant production system. There are two theories 129 about the origin of the disaster: the first holds that water poured into MIC tanks due to the operation of washing pipes. The second states that there was sabotage among Indian staff for unknown reasons. Either way, a significant amount of water poured into a tank of MIC and ignited a powerful chemical reaction. After hours of unskilled attempts by the operators to control the reaction, approximately 40 tons of MIC were released into the atmosphere of Bhopal.",

By 0:50 a.m. on December 3, the operators understood that they could not control this leakage, and fled the plant. Earlier, at 0:30 a.m., they switched on a large siren which was heard outside the plant, but soon turned it off. When operational staff left the plant, a low-power siren was turned on, which could only be heard within the plant area. 130 Before the disaster, \"alarms at the plant sounded so often (the siren went off twenty to thirty times a week for various purposes) that an actual alert could not be distinguished from routine events or practice alerts\". 131 None of the plant executives informed local authorities about the accident. Moreover, when the police began to receive hundreds of phone calls from Bhopal residents about a strange gas, bouts of coughing and people lying unconscious on the streets, the plant operators continued to reassure local police that \"Everything is OK \" and \"We do not know what [is happening]\". The plant manager flatly denied any leakage there: \"The gas leak just can't be from my plant \". 132 This all resulted in a situation in which local officials, police and the military stalled the evacuation of local residents. Unbelievably, the authorities had never expected to evacuate people because nobody thought that the plant was a hazardous operation: the management of the plant never revealed the risks of MIC. Moreover, according to the Madhya Pradesh Town and Country Planning Board, the plant was classified in the \"general industry\" rather than in the \"hazardous industry\" category. 133 The second cause of mass mortality at Bhopal was the fact that medical institutes were unprepared for a large influx of patients. This city of almost a million people had only 5 hospitals, with 1800 hospital beds and 300 doctors, who were never trained to serve patients with chemical poisoning. Before the accident, UCIL did not provide any recommendations about medical treatment appropriate to the list of chemicals in use at the plant, and afterwards they declined to reveal the composition of the leaked gas. 134 This led to a complete absence of adequate treatment for the thousands of victims. Moreover, according to a statement by UCC executives in the United States, the first-still contradictory-information about the disaster reached headquarters more than 12 h after the accident. 135 By 8 a.m. on December 3, 1984, managers at the plant had been arrested by the local police, and UCC did not have top-level contacts within Bhopal to get reliable information about the accident. In addition, communication between UCC and the Bhopal plant and authorities became complicated by the insufficient capacity of the existing telephone network (a city of nearly a million people had only 10,000 numbers in the telephone network). All together, this led to the absence of detailed information about the accident reaching UCC executives, and consequently to a shortage of clear and strict recommendations about antidotes from UCC's advanced medical service to hospitals in Bhopal in the first few critical hours after the leak.",

            "text": "The initial plan implied developing towards self-sufficiency, but during program development, it became clear that NASA would always rely on Congress and government spending. The design of the Shuttle's solid rocket boosters was primarily based on the U.S. Air Force's Titan III solid rocket. 151 In 1983, Ronald Reagan proposed the Strategic Defense Initiative-ground-based and space-based systems to protect the United States from attack by Soviet strategic nuclear ballistic missiles. On August 28, 1985, a Titan 34D rocket laden with military equipment exploded after take-off from the Vandenberg Air Force Base. This gave NASA additional leverage to convince Congress that the shuttle transportation system could deliver military staff and equipment, including components of the Strategic Defense Initiative program, to orbit in any conditions. Accordingly, NASA requested that military funding for developing the Titan IV program-US$17.6 billion was to be spent for this purpose up to 1999 152 -should be transferred to NASA. Ultimately, \"the nation's reliance on the Shuttle as its principal space launch capability created a relentless pressure on NASA to increase the flight rate\". 153 Because of this, NASA executives could not accept cancellations or serious delays of Shuttle flights due to weather conditions or minor technical problems. Such confidence was based on the statistics of previous flights and the false perception that the probability of Shuttle failure was extremely low. By January 1986, NASA management interpreted the previous 24 successful Shuttle launches as a transition of the space shuttle program from the experimental phase to the operational phase, which meant that the Shuttle's design was now proven to be adequate for serial launches.",

The estimates range from roughly 1 in 100 to 1 in 100,000. The higher figures come from the working engineers, and the very low figures from management. What are the causes and consequences of this lack of agreement? Since 1 part in 100,000 would imply that 151 Investigation of the Challenger accident.

Truly and the Recovery from the Challenger Accident by John A. Logsdon, Washington, D.C., June 6th, 1986. one could put a Shuttle up each day for 300 years expecting to lose only one, we could properly ask 'What is the cause of management's fantastic faith in the machinery?\" An estimate of the reliability of solid rockets was made by the range safety officer, based on the study of all previous rocket flights. Out of a total of nearly 2,900 flights, 121 failed (1 in 25). This includes, however, what may be called early errors, rockets flown for the first few times in which design errors are discovered and fixed. A more reasonable figure for the mature rockets might be 1 in 50. With special care in the selection of parts and in the inspection process, a figure of below 1 in 100 might be achieved but 1 in 1000 is probably not attainable with today's technology. Since there are two rockets on the Shuttle, these rocket failure rates must be doubled to derive the Shuttle failure rates from the Solid Rocket Booster failure rate\u2026 Engineers at Rocketdyne, the manufacturer, estimate the total probability as 1/10,000. Engineers at Marshal estimate it as 1/300, while NASA management, to whom these engineers report, claims it is 1/100,000. An independent engineer consulting for NASA thought 1 or 2 per 100 to be a reasonable estimate. NASA officials argued that the figure is much lower. They point out that these figures are for unmanned rockets but since the Shuttle is a manned vehicle 'the probability of mission success is necessarily very close to 1.0.' It is not very clear what this phrase means. Does it mean it is close to 1 or that it ought to be close to 1? They go on to explain 'Historically, this extremely high degree of mission success has given rise to a difference in philosophy between manned space flight programs and unmanned programs; i.e., numerical probability usage versus engineering judgment'. It is true that, if the probability of failure was as low as 1 in 100,000, it would take an inordinate number of tests to determine it. Official management \u2026 claims to believe the probability of failure is a thousand times less [the engineers' estimation of 1 in 100]. One reason for this may be an attempt to assure the government of NASA perfection and success in order to ensure the supply of funds. The other may be that they sincerely believed it to be true, demonstrating an almost incredible lack of communication between themselves and their working engineers\u2026 The astronauts, like test pilots, should know their risks\". 154 Problems of Timely Launching of Space Shuttles in [1985] [1986] The 25th launch of the Shuttle (STS-51-L mission, Challenger) had been planned for July 1985. It was postponed until late November to accommodate changes in payloads. The launch was subsequently delayed again and finally was rescheduled 154 Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, Appendix F. R. P. Feynman, Personal observations on the reliability of the Shuttle, Washington, D.C., June 6th, 1986. 2.1 Industrial Sector program and USAF's Titan rocket family, were alarmed by one detail: extremely cold weather was predicted for Florida, dropping to minus 6.6 \u00b0C (20 \u00b0F) in the last 11 h before the launch. 159 Indeed, previous successful lift-offs all occurred at temperatures above +11.5 \u00b0C (53 \u00b0F). This low temperature of +11.5 \u00b0C (53 \u00b0F) was registered during the launch of mission STS-51-C (Discovery) on January 24, 1985 . After this mission, the solid rocket boosters were salvaged from the Atlantic Ocean and Roger Boisjoly, one of the senior engineers on the MTI team, found out that the O-rings, which sealed the hot gases inside the combustion chambers of the solid rocket boosters while firing, were damaged. The O-rings were among 700 parts included on the \"Critical 1\" list. Of the 2 million components comprising the Shuttle, a failure of any one of the parts on this list would result in the loss of the spacecraft and/or crew. Boisjoly concluded that the main cause of damage to the O-rings was the low temperature on the day of the launch: +11.5 \u00b0C (53 \u00b0F). The rings had excellent resistance to high temperatures up to 327 \u00b0C (621 \u00b0F), 160 but lose their flexibility in cold conditions. The manufacturer of the O-rings expected that the product would retain resilience below \u22123.8 \u00b0C (25 \u00b0F), but there were no practical tests of O-rings on MTI solid rocket boosters in cold temperature conditions. In view of this and other factors, the recommended temperature range for the entire Shuttle launch was between +0.5 \u00b0C (31 \u00b0F) and +37.2 \u00b0C (99 \u00b0F). 161 Some erosion of the O-rings was recorded during the 51-B mission (29 April, 1985, Challenger).",

            "text": "After the launches, MTI formally mentioned some problems with the rings in a report to NASA, but no action was taken. In July 1985, Boisjoly sent an internal report to MTI executives about his concerns about the need for an immediate redesign of the solid rocket boosters, but received an informal reply from a top MTI manager that \"this material is too sensitive to release to anybody. We will keep it a secret\". 162 Although the STS-61C mission (January 12, 1986, Columbia) was launched at temperatures lower than +5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F), MTI engineers did not provide any information concerning a possible erosion of the O-rings during the conference calls. 168 NASA executives exclaimed that they were \"appalled at the given recommendations\", that \"we can't launch, we won't be able to launch until April\" 169 and argued that the evidence was \"incomplete\". 170 Nevertheless, NASA officials emphasized that they would \"not agree to launch management\". 177 \"The decision to launch the Challenger was flawed. Those who made that decision were unaware of the recent history of problems concerning the O-rings and the joint and were unaware of the initial written recommendation of the contractor advising against the launch at temperatures below 53 degrees Fahrenheit [+ 11.5 \u00b0C] and the continuing opposition of the engineers at Thiokol after the management reversed its position\u2026 If the decision makers [Levels I and II program officials, or Launch Director for 51-L] had known all of the facts, it is highly unlikely that they would have decided to launch 51-L on January 28, 1986\". 178 Boisjoly declared during the commission testimony: \"I felt personally that management was under a lot of pressure to launch and that they made a very tough decision, but I didn't agree with it\". 179 Twenty years later, Boisjoly stated that \"I must emphasize that MTI Management fully supported the original decision to not launch below 53 \u00b0F [+ 11.5 \u00b0C] prior to the caucus. The caucus constituted the unethical decision-making forum resulting from intense customer intimidation. NASA placed MTI in the position of proving that it was not safe to fly instead of proving that it was safe to fly. Also, note that NASA immediately accepted the new decision to launch because it was consistent with their desires and, please note, that no probing questions were asked\". 180 The Commission concluded that \"the Thiokol Management reversed its position and recommended the launch of 51-L, at the urging of Marshall and contrary to the views of its engineers in order to accommodate a major customer\". 181 Richard been a big problem for a long time. So he reported that it would cost so-and-so much to fix it -a lot of money. From the point of view of the press and some of the commissioners, Mr. Cook's story sounded like a big expose, as if NASA was hiding the seals problem from us\". 182 The commission summarized major organizational problems related to the accelerated launch schedule. We here select a few that are relevant to our discussion 183 : \"1. The capabilities of the system were stretched to the limit to support the flight rate in winter 1985/1986 186 Ultimately, the combination of these facts explains the passive position of MTI management when, in July 1985, Boisjoly sent the report about shortcomings in the O-ring design. MTI executives realized that the budget of NASA and the available time were insufficient for serious improvement of the scores of solid rocket boosters that were already ordered-after the accident, it indeed took 32 months to redesign the solid rocket boosters. 187 It thus seemed impossible for NASA and MTI to halt the program and confess that there had been flaws in the design of the O-rings during many years before the first launch of the Shuttle in 1981. Moreover, NASA and MTI have been concealing this information from astronauts, the government and the public during two dozen launches. NASA was the major client for MTI with more than a billion dollar contract each year, and MTI management wished to maintain its contract. This explains why MTI management made the decision, in compliance with NASA requests, to keep the cost of launches down and to minimize delays, the later being interpreted by the media and politicians as due to technical shortcomings of the whole Shuttle program; NASA was anxious to demonstrate to Congress that the Shuttle could fly in any conditions with military staff and materials.",

Previously, Soviet nuclear industry executives had not recognized any parallels between the situation within their industry and the American problems revealed during the Three Mile Island accident: insufficient exchange of risk information about incidents and near-miss cases, ignorance of the importance of the human factor in operating a nuclear power plant (NPP), self-deception about the overall reliability of reactors in any situation, and overconfidence about the impossibility of a worst-case scenario actually happening. On April 26, 1986 at 1:23 a.m., during an experiment with the emergency power supply system at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, a power excursion occurred in the RBMK-1000 Reactor #4 that led the reactor to burn uncontrollably. The plant was located in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, which at the time was part of the Soviet Union. It was 700 km away from Moscow, 320 km from Minsk, and 140 km from Kiev. Because the reactor did not have a containment dome, the explosion led to the release into the atmosphere of 7.7 tons of uranium oxide fuel, amounting to 4 % of the total contained in the reactor; 96 % of the fuel, or 185 tons of uranium, stayed in the reactor. 190 Huge regions of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine were contaminated, 191 and traces of chemical elements from Chernobyl NPP were later found in Northern and Western Europe. The accident resulted in the release of approximately 5200 PBq (1 PBq (Penta Becquerels) = 10 15 disintegrations per second) 192 of radioactive substances into the atmosphere. 193 This was the first accident since the beginning of the nuclear age to be classified as a level 7 event-the maximum level according to the International Nuclear Event Scale. More than 116,000 people were evacuated from the 30 km zone around the NPP. 194 Two workers died after the explosion, and 28 firefighters died in the first three months following the accident. Estimates from various sources of the total number of victims of the Chernobyl accident remain 190 contradictory because of political indecisiveness, different scientific approaches and the unavailability of health statistics from Soviet officials. In 2005, the UN report \"Chernobyl's Legacy: Health, Environmental and Socio-Economic Impacts\" contained a statement from an international team of more than 100 scientists that up to about 4000 people could eventually die of radiation from the Chernobyl NPP accident. 195 The financial cost of the Chernobyl disaster remains controversial too. Mikhail Gorbachev, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1985 until 1991, cited that the Soviet Union spent 18 billion rubles 196 (approximately US$27 billion 197 ) on dealing with the consequences of the disaster. The government budget of the USSR was around 360 billion rubles from [1985] [1986] [1987] 198 and the GNP in that period was around 780-800 billion rubles; so the expenses for the response to Chernobyl were 5 % of the annual Soviet budget, or approximately 2 % of GNP. According to estimates from academician Valery Legasov, a key member of the government investigation committee on the Chernobyl disaster, the total damage caused by the Chernobyl accident was in fact 300 billion rubles in pre-1990 prices, or approximately US$450 billion (of 1990 US$). This amount exceeds the combined profits of all Soviet nuclear power plants for the duration of their existence. 199 In a nutshell, the Chernobyl disaster is the combination of (i) a fundamental design mistake on the class of RBMK reactors (leading to instabilities in certain conditions) that were hidden due to a culture of secrecy and arrogance, and (ii) bypassing safety rules due to structural lack of communication between competent agencies as well as amateurship actions of the Chernobyl staff who switched off all alarms during a standard feasibility test. There was constant competition for innovation between the Soviet Union and the West, which manifested clearly in the development of nuclear weaponry and in space exploration. At the turn of the 1970s, the competition began in civil nuclear power. By 1972, the USSR was behind the USA and United Kingdom, which had constructed more than 50 reactors between them, while the Soviet Union had only 7. 200 The Soviet Union had not tried to develop nuclear power in the 1950s and 1960s, because the assumption within the powerful Soviet Planning Commission was that coal from the Donbass-the Donetsk coal basin, located in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic-could provide enough energy for the Western part of the USSR. But double-digit industrial growth and massive construction of civil infrastructure in the 1960s and 1970s provoked energy shortage within the western part of the Union, and new calculations showed that the Donbass would not have sufficient coal resources for long-term supply. Although the Soviet Union had access to massive coal deposits, these were located beyond the Ural Mountains and would therefore put huge pressure on the railways to transport coal to plants in the western part of the Union. One promising strategy to solve growing energy needs was the intensive development of civil nuclear energy in the heavily populated and highly industrialized western part of the Soviet Union. Moreover, after the 1973 Arab oil embargo, the price of oil increased by a factor 2. Siberia became very profitable for the USSR, because production costs there were very low, at only US$0.80 per barrel [US$3.50 in 2010 prices]. 202 The export of hydrocarbons, principally oil, greatly increased the Soviet budget; so it was logical to focus on raising export revenue by reducing domestic oil and gas consumption for domestic electricity in parallel with large scale development of nuclear power plants for domestic uses. Nuclear power compares very favorably: burning just one ton of natural uranium oxide produces the energy equivalent of 16,000 tons of coal or 80,000 barrels of oil. 203 The Politburo (the executive committee for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union) decided to invite the leading developers of the Soviet nuclear weapon (which worked within The Soviet Ministry of Medium Machine Building (Minsredmash)), to work on designing and building a new high-capacity reactor. Academician Anatoly Alexandrov, director of the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy (subordinated to Minsredmash), which had researched the theoretical physics underlying the Soviet nuclear weapon program, was appointed as the scientific director of the new civil reactor project. Academician Alexandrov personally took part in the development of the Soviet nuclear submarine fleet, nuclear icebreakers and the civil Water-Water Energetic Reactor (VVER), a successful Soviet variant of the Western pressurized water reactor. Around 80 % of all operating civil nuclear reactors in the world are light water reactors: either pressurized water reactors (PWRs) or boiling water reactors (BWRs). 204 An immensely respected scientist, he was president of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR from 1975 until 1986.",

In the 1940s, USSR was eager to overtake Americans in the construction of nuclear bombs. In this race, drawing mainly from domestic assets and also from the German specialists they have been able to recruit, the Soviets were significantly constrained by a shortage of resources, both material and human, in comparison with the Americans who had invited the best nuclear physicists from around the world and had suffered no loss on their territory while the Soviets had to reconstruct after the most devastating war in the Union as well as Russian history with casualties mounting to more than 27 million people. Nevertheless, in 1949, the Soviets tested their first nuclear bomb (four years after the Americans). By 1953, the Union overtook the States in the development of thermonuclear weapons. In 1954, Soviet nuclear scientists and engineers commissioned in Obninsk the first industrial civil nuclear reactor in the world: an uranium-graphite channel water-cooled reactor, it was a predecessor of the RBMKs. Academician Dollezhal outlined the experience of building this reactor as follows: \" 208 This shows that knowledge of serious intrinsic problems with the RBMK was present, but rampant misinformation and lack of communication nurtured the Chernobyl catastrophe.",

            "text": "There is no single universally accepted version of the cause of the reactor excursion, but the majority of investigators mention two main causes: a combination of imperfections of the RBMK reactor design-especially a phenomenon known as the \"positive SCRAM effect\" 209 -and unconscious mistakes by the executives and operators of Chernobyl NPP, who approved and conducted the experiment on Reactor #4. The reactor's developers blame the staff of the plant and vice versa. The \"positive SCRAM effect\" first came to light during operation of the first RBMK reactor near Leningrad, in an incident in November 1975. There was a reactor reactivity excursion after SCRAM (emergency shutdown), which overheated a small part of the core, rupturing a channel of the reactor. The investigation commission in 1976 concluded that some elements of the reactor core needed to be redesigned in order to reduce the void coefficient, change some features of the control rods and increase the speed of the SCRAM system. 210,211 But these recommendations were only implemented ten years later, after the Chernobyl disaster. The IAEA report after Chernobyl noted: \"The slow speed of the emergency protection system (the time for total insertion [of the control rods] into the core from the upper limit position is 18 s) and defects in the design of the rods (i.e. the positive reactivity excursion) resulted in a situation where, for a number of reactor operating modes, the emergency protection system not only did not function, but itself initiated a reactor runaway\". 212 From 1976 onwards, Vladimir Volkov, head of the reliability and safety laboratory at the Kurchatov Institute, sent numerous memoranda to his supervisors about calculation errors in the design of the RBMK, and gave suggestions for their improvement. He mentioned the positive SCRAM effect, defined as a localized increase of activity in the bottom of the core of a nuclear reactor during emergency shutdown. But executives at the Kurchatov Institute and NIKIET did not pay serious attention to his warnings, or those of others. 213 209 The SCRAM system refers to the control rods that are inserted into a nuclear reactor core to suppress nuclear fission. A \"positive SCRAM effect\" is a localized increase of activity in the bottom of the core of a reactor during emergency shutdown with low power range: introducing graphite rods leads to decreased absorption of neutrons by the xenon in the core (\"xenon poisoning\") and accelerates the nuclear reaction. 210 later, it led to improvements in the situation\u2026 [There would be an improvement of that exact shortcoming and things would then] calm down until the next case\". 215 The developers of the RBMK assumed that the positive SCRAM effect would only manifest in rare cases, and preferred to take organizational measures to ensure the safe operation of the reactor (clear instructions, staff training, etc.) rather than making technical changes to the reactor design. 216 They were confident that the high quality of education and self-discipline of the staff at military-prone Minsredmash would compensate for any technical disadvantages of the RBMK when it became operational. Moreover, due to Western sanctions against the USSR during the Cold War, Soviet scientists and engineers were not able to use American supercomputers in the 1960s and 1970s to calculate technical solutions for the reactors at the design stage without testing their assumptions on prototypes. An IAEA report in 1992 mentioned the following: \"There are a number of explanations for the poor quality of the calculation analysis of the safety of the design of [RBMK reactors]. These include the fact that, until recently, Soviet computer techniques were chronically outdated and the standard of computer codes was very low. Three-dimensional non-stationary neutron-thermal-hydraulic models are required in order to calculate the physical parameters of a RBMK reactor under different operating conditions. Such models first became available only shortly before the Chernobyl accident and were not really developed until after the acci-dent\u2026 As a result of the misguided selection of the core's physical and design parameters by the designers, the RBMK-1000 reactor was a dynamically unstable system with regard to power and steam quality perturbations. The steam quality, in its turn, was dependent on many parameters characterizing the reactor state\". 217",

So Electrification that it was safe to hand over the operation of nuclear power plants to personnel who had experience of running thermal power stations, but no education in nuclear science. For instance, the General Director of Chernobyl NPP, who was in place from the digging of the foundations of the plant in 1970, had training and experience as a turbine specialist and had worked on a coal power station before his appointment at Chernobyl. On one occasion before the accident, the director vividly revealed his wishful thinking about the harmlessness of nuclear reactors: \"What are you worried about, the nuclear reactor is a samovar [a traditional Russian pot used to heat water for tea]. It is much easier [to operate] than a thermal station, and we have experienced personneland nothing will happen\". 224 The background of the deputy of the Ministry of Energy and Electrification and department head, who was responsible for the construction of all nuclear plants in USSR, was in the building of hydropower plants. The head of the Ministry's unit, who was responsible for the exploitation of all nuclear plants in USSR, was a former executive of the State Planning Commission without any experience in nuclear industry. 225 In addition, the plant's Chief Engineer was an electrician, who had worked previously on thermal power stations and the national electric grid. The Chief Engineer latter played a critical part in developing the plan for the experiment with the emergency power supply system on Reactor #4 that led to the disaster. This experiment was necessary because the emergency operating modes had not been properly tested prior to the RBMK being rolled out across the USSR. 226 It involved testing the potential rotational energy of the turbine during emergency shutdown of the reactor, in order to produce emergency electrical power for the water pumps (for a duration around 1 min) until the emergency diesel generators on the plant could be started up to full capacity. 227 The experiment was stipulated in the development project for the reactor, but the detailed steps involved were left to the personnel of each plant. In the case of Reactor #4, the plan for the experiment was not submitted to the developers because there was no requirement to obtain their approval for experiments. 228 The Chief Engineer of the plant-with no experience of running nuclear plants and little understanding of the risks involved in such a test to be performed on an RBMK 229 -decided to conduct it as a routine 224 ",

All of them asserted that they had not known about any technical shortcomings of RBMK reactors, and had believed that these reactors were absolutely safe. Moreover, they did not have any special instructions on how to handle RBMK reactors to avoid the positive SCRAM effect. 257,258,259 So, on April 26, 1986, when the operators of Chernobyl NPP pushed the emergency SCRAM button of Reactor #4 during the experiment, they were unaware of the existing technical shortcomings of this type of reactor and were convinced that an accident beyond the reactor design parameters could not happen. 260 The truth of the matter was only revealed to the world community in 1992, when the IAEA published the INSAG-7 report-an updated version of their 1986 report, including new conclusions issued by the Soviet state committee for the supervision of safety in industry and nuclear power in 1991: \"The reactor designers were aware that the dangerous property of the reactor they had developed could be a cause of nuclear instability, but failed to estimate quantitatively its 256 265 Several hours after the accident occurred, the Director of Chernobyl NPP arrived at the plant and saw that there had been an explosion, which had blown off the roof of Reactor #4 and caused a fire that was still burning. Obviously, the reactor was no longer there. Nevertheless, the director was given assurances from the operators who had been running the reactor during the accident that it was not damaged. He could not immediately verify this statement 266 and, during the first few hours, felt obliged to send encouraging reports to his superiors in Kiev and Moscow: \"The reactor is intact, continuing to pump water into the reactor, the radiation level is within the normal range\". 267 One hour after the accident, the chief of the Civil Defense Service reported to the director that radiation levels near the plant were 80,000 times the maximum acceptable level. However, the plant director did not believe him and ordered his arrest for spreading rumors and causing panic. 268 He continued to send reports to his superiors giving understated levels of radioactivity at the plant. 269 This misinformation of the authorities delayed 265 Nikolaii Karpan, Vengeance of peaceful atom, Dnepropetrovsk, 2006, pp. 339-342. 266 Seven hours after the accident (at 10:00 a.m. on 26 April 1986), one of the engineers of Chernobyl NPP explored the reactor room and found out that the reactor was demolished, but the Director of the plant did not believe his statement. It took a helicopter ride 12 h after the accident (around 3:00 p.m. on 26 April 1986) to establish the fact that Reactor #4 was destroyed and was throwing out radioactive material into the atmosphere (Alexandr Borovoy, Evgeny Velihov. Experience of Chernobyl, National Research Center \"Kurchatovsky Institute\", Moscow, 2012, p. 11). 267 271 And because top-level managers in the Soviet central government were deceived by false reassurances from the plant, they did not understand the real scale of the accident, and could not take appropriate managerial decisions. The government commission, which arrived at the site of Chernobyl NPP from Moscow in the late evening on the day of the disaster, found that managers and all services of plants were demoralized. Later, the plant director said: \"People have been doing this [misrepresentation] with no malice. This was the practice within the industry: nothing bad to report. We always had to sayeverything is going well\". 272 Ukrainian writer Boris Oleynik characterized the communication between industry executives and Communist Party officials in the following way: \"Talk more and prettier, in order to please your boss. You can act as you think best, even if your work is the polar opposite of your words\". 273 In a crisis situation, this common practice of passing on completely inaccurate information led, as already mentioned, to a critical delay in the evacuation of a city of some forty seven thousand people.",

As a result, the liquidation operation-which was one of the most remarkable and heroic achievements of the Soviet Union-was lost in the rhetoric of accusation. One devastating result of concealing the real information about the consequences of irradiation, and about the availability of effective antidotes, was psychological: a widespread phobia of radiation that seized thousands of Soviet citizens, leading to psychosomatic disorders, chronic heart disease and psychological problems. According to the Nuclear Safety Institute at the Russian Academy of Sciences, the death rate from such diseases was much higher than the death rate from radiation. 286 284 \u2022 Short-term profitability, and the production of cheap nuclear energy in the Soviet Union, took priority over the long-term resilience of the Soviet nuclear industry and the protection of the environment. \u2022 A \"rush culture\" was established by the Politburo in order to increase the speed of construction of nuclear power plants to meet urgent domestic energy needs. This environment of constant haste encouraged people to ignore possible measures to correct minor shortcomings of the reactor, which were perceived by developers as insignificant and unlikely to cause a serious problem in practice. \u2022 The nationalistic arrogance of Soviet nuclear executives, and their overconfidence in the infallibility of Soviet nuclear technology. \u2022 Habituation/wishful thinking/self-suggestion/self-deception among representatives of the Soviet civil nuclear industry about the minuscule probability of severe accidents at Soviet nuclear reactors: they totally refused to believe that a serious disaster could happen. As a result, the Politburo allowed the transfer of the control of nuclear power stations to the civil Ministry of Energy and Electrification, which was unprepared for such a complicated task. \u2022 The Kurchatov institute, NIKIET, Minsredmash and the Ministry of Energy and Electrification focused only on their narrow departmental interests, which prevented timely and adequate communication of risk information between different agencies. \u2022 National security secrecy. Before the accident, operators at the plant did not receive any information about the accidents that had occurred previously at other Soviet NPPs, or about international nuclear accidents. \u2022 The developers of the RBMK reactor were reluctant to confess their own mistakes in the design of the reactor. They were afraid of accusations of incompetence. The prosecution of the plant's operators that would inevitably follow from such accusations was again question of national security because the developers of the RBMK reactor were members of the development team for the Soviet nuclear weapon. If they were found guilty, it would then cast doubts on the reliability of the Soviet civil nuclear program and of the Soviet nuclear weapons. \u2022 It was common practice among Soviet bureaucrats to present themselves to superiors in the best possible light, which created an organizational culture of \"Success at Any Price\" and \"No Bad News\" within the industry. So the real defects of the RBMK were concealed from the Politburo -who also received misleading information about the real condition of the plant during the first hours after the accident, delaying the evacuation of the residents of Pripyat.

            "text": "in order to avoid colliding with small icebergs from the nearby Columbia glacier. However, the third mate failed to properly maneuver the ship and collided with Bligh Reef. 289 At the time of the accident, the captain may have been drunk 290 and the third mate was suffering from exhaustion. 291 The exceptional size of the oil spill was caused by the lack of oil spill response equipment and professional personnel at the Alyeska Pipeline Service Company, which was the responsible party in the first hours and days after any oil spill in the Valdez harbor and some areas of Prince William Sound. According to the Alyeska contingency plan, the oil spill response barge should have reached the area during the first 5 h after the accident but, in the case of Exxon Valdez, the spill response team arrived at the site only after 14 h. 292 The tanker was fully surrounded by containment booms only within 36 h after the accident. In the first 72 h, less than 3000 barrels of spilled oil were collected in spite of Alyeska's previous assurances that they could collect 100,000 barrels in less than in 48 h. 293 In addition, Alyeska, Exxon and the government of Alaska underestimated the possibility of a large oil spill in this area and, as a result, none of the parties had the essential amount of oil spill response equipment installed in the Valdez port area at the time of the accident. The clean-up operation in the summer of 1989 required 10,000 people, 1000 Slope on the Arctic Ocean. The main problem facing oil companies exploiting this field would be the transportation of extracted oil. Due to the continuous ice and severe wind conditions of the Arctic Ocean, year-round oil export by icebreakers and oil tankers seemed risky and unpredictable. A trans-Canadian pipeline route was rejected because of U.S. energy security concerns. In the end, oil companies proposed the 1,287 km Trans-Alaska pipeline from the Arctic Ocean (Prudhoe Bay) to the Pacific Ocean, emerging at the year-round ice-free port of Valdez. For the construction and management of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) pipeline, the Alyeska Pipeline Service Company (Alyeska) was established. Majority of shares in Alyeska were distributed between BP Pipelines (50.01 %), ARCO Pipeline Company (21.35 %) and Exxon Pipeline Company (20.34 %). 295 In the early 1970s, the idea of a Trans-Alaska pipeline met with opposition from environmentalists and Alaskan native tribes, but after the 1973 oil crisis, when oil prices dramatically increased from US$3 to US$12 per barrel, the pipeline development went ahead. The project was finished by July 1977. By the end of the 1980s, TAPS was carrying 25 % of US domestic oil production-around 2.2 MMbbl/day. 296 Alyeska pledged to focus on the safe transportation of North Slope oil through the last American wilderness-and especially on the safe marine transportation from port Valdez through the pristine Prince William Sound. In March 1977, Alyeska promised regulators to deploy so many booms in the case of large oil spill that it \"would be like the Normandy invasion\". 297 The company demonstrated to officials the existence of booms stored along the U.S. West Coast (26.6 km of booms in total from sites spanning Prudhoe Bay to San Francisco) and assured that a sufficient number could be transported by air in case of emergency; however, response times were not indicated. 298 Alyeska's worst-case scenario was estimated at 200,000 barrels of oil spill, but the probability of such an event was calculated as once in every 241 years. 299 The company never believed the worstcase scenario could happen, declaring that the most likely spill volume for vessels operated by the Valdez terminal \"appears to be in the 1000 to 2000 barrel range\" and \"we feel Alyeska has adequately addressed the major issues\". 300 After the accident, Frank Iarossi, president of Exxon Shipping Co., said that \"there is no 295 doubt that all of these contingency plans and all of this planning and everything did not anticipate ever having to respond to a spill this big. I do not know why it didn't. I wasn't involved in the plan, but clearly no one ever anticipated trying to handle 250,000 barrels of oil on the water. This spill just overwhelmed everybody. No one was organized to control a spill of this magnitude\". 301 With such optimistic risk assessment, Alyeska decided in 1977 that 5.5 km of oil spill booms were enough for Port Valdez. 302 Weak State Government Control Over the Activities of the Main Taxpayer of Alaska's Budget From the first months after the launch of the Valdez terminal, Alyeska neglected the maintenance of the oil spill response equipment and team. Thus, in December 1977, a representative of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) found out that 137 pieces of oil spill response equipment were broken or missing from a compulsory list of 170 items at the Valdez terminal. 303 Alyeska was the major taxpayer of the State of Alaska and had a strong influence on the State decision-making process for decades. In spite of a considerable increase in the budgets of both the State of Alaska and ADEC, which went from US$125 million in 1969 to US$2 billion in 1989 for the former, staff complained that ADEC's Prince William Sound District Office \"has been under-budgeted and under-staffed to adequately inspect the terminal and keep in touch with their day-to-day operations\". 304 Valdez oil terminal was just one of 93 onshore oil terminals under the oversight of ADEC. The regulator was responsible for more than 400 facilities (tankers, barges, and drilling platforms). In 1988, when ADEC asked for an additional US$0.5 million to hire inspectors to review contingency plans and inspect facilities, the department received only US$0.15 million. 305 Over many years, ADEC Prince William Sound District Office representatives pointed out problems at the terminal, including outdated oil spill recovery equipment, reduced training programs and questionable equipment reliability. They criticized the practice of staff-only drills, which showed that \"Alyeska's spill response activities have regressed to a dangerous level\". The reaction of the president of Alyeska to these revealed shortcomings illustrates well the real power of Alyeska within the State of Alaska: instead of making safety improvements, he changed the procedures for 301 the access of ADEC to the terminal! He decided that ADEC officials should give \"preferably one day's notice\" before inspections, he refused to allow them to bring video cameras and he assigned a designated Alyeska representative \"who will accompany them at all times during their stay on the terminal to answer any questions or address any concerns they may have at the time\". 306 This dangerous lack of maintenance continued for a decade. Thus, Jim Woodle, U.S. Coast Guard commander at the Marine Safety Office of the Port of Valdez, testified that the equipment was not in good shape. He said five booms were physically in the inventory-although the contingency plan required all booms to be situated on the oil spill barge for quick response. Moreover, Alyeska reduced the number of response team members from 18 to 10 or 8 people. Woodle asked to test all booms and inflate them, but the Alyeska oil spill response team said that \"they didn't have 1) the capability of activating all five at one time from the standpoint of manpower; 2) they weren't sure that three of them could operate. They basically kept two available for drill purposes, and the other three had never been used\". In 1984, Woodle wrote a letter to the president of Alyeska concerning oil spill recovery: \"Due to reduction in manning, age of equipment, limited training opportunities, and lack of experienced coordination personnel, serious doubt exists that Alyeska would be able to contain and clean-up effectively a medium or large size oil spill\". 307",

            "text": "Apparently, the management of Alyeska did not react adequately to such information over the following few years. The reasons were as follows. Firstly, the statistics of oil spills in Prince William Sound made a large oil spill seem unlikely. For instance, from 1977 to 1989, 8700 oil tanker transits occurred, with only 400 small oil spills, the majority of which were located in the Port of Valdez during oil tanker loading. 308 The largest oil spill happened when the Thompson Pass oil tanker leaked 1700 barrels (150 times less then Exxon Valdez) within the terminal area. 309 Secondly, in 1982, the Exxon Company stated that \"for most tanker spills, the response plan outlined in the Alyeska plan will suffice. However, in the event of a major spill by an Exxon owned and operated vessel, it is anticipated that the Exxon Company, U.S.A. Oil Spill Response Team\u2026 would be activated to manage the spill response\". 310 Thirdly, the oil companies that owned Alyeska came to a mutual agreement that Alyeska's area of responsibility should be limited to \"Valdez Arm and Valdez Narrows only. Further efforts in the Price William Sound would be limited to use of dispersants and any additional efforts would be the responsibility of the spiller\". 311 However, the authorities, including ADEC representatives and the U.S. Coast Guard, were not informed about these internal organizational issues between Alyeska and its owners. This was a violation of Alyeska's agreements with both the United States and the State of Alaska. In 1973, in exchange for the right to build the Trans-Alaska pipeline on public lands, Alyeska signed an agreement where, in the section on oil spill contingency plans, they promised to control and clean up any oil spill: \"If during any phase of the construction, operation, maintenance or termination of the Pipeline, any oil or other pollutant should be discharged from the Pipeline System, the control and total removal, disposal and clearing up of such oil and other pollutant, wherever found shall be the responsibility of Permittees, regardless of fault\u2026 Full scale, company-wide field exercises will be held at least once per year to insure overall readiness for response to large scale oil spills\u2026 Alyeska will direct cleanup operations of spills resulting from operation involving tankers carrying or destined to carry crude oil transported though the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, occurring at Valdez terminal, in Port Valdez, Valdez arm or Prince William sound \". 312 Because of the agreement, it was widely anticipated within Alaska that Alyeska would immediately react to any oil spill in the first days after an accident while the spiller was launching an independent oil spill response plan.",

        {
            "text": "On 6-7 April 1988, ten months before the accident, Theo L. Polasek, vice president of operations of Alyeska, made a presentation to an internal operation subcommittee comprising representatives from BP Pipelines (Alaska), ARCO Pipeline Company, Exxon Pipeline Company and other companies participating in the Alyeska consortium. In the presentation, entitled \"Alyeska Response Capability to Spills equipment is adequate\" for spills at the terminal, but \"should be maintained to the highest state of readiness\". It was offered to use dispersants \"on a widespread basis\" for possible spills occurring in Prince William Sound. 315 Ultimately, Alyeska's proprietors secretly decided that Alyeska would not respond to an oil spill in Prince William Sound in the way prescribed in the contingency plan. 316 Apparently, information about the real condition of the Alyeska oil spill response team, and about the decision not to respond to an oil spill in Prince William Sound, was withheld not only from regulators and the government of Alaska, but even from management of oil companies included in the Alyeska consortium. For example, after the Exxon Valdez accident, Don Cornett, CEO of Exxon Company in Alaska and spokesman on the accident, said that he was not aware of any cutbacks in Alyeska's response team, 317 which suggests that he was probably also unaware of the inadequate amount of equipment for first response actions and of its poor condition. The same lack of awareness of the risks prevailed among local communities: the majority of them believed in Alyeska's promise, issued during discussions about the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) project, that \"the contingency plan which will be drawn up will detail methods for dealing promptly and effectively with any oil spill which may occur, so that its effect on the environment will be minimal\u2026 operations at There is no evidence that executives of Exxon Shipping Co. (the oil transportation subdivision of Exxon Company) were informed about the real level of Alyeska's response capability, either by Alyeska representatives or by the Exxon Pipeline Company. In the 1980s, Exxon Shipping Co. practiced the risky strategy of reducing the running costs of its oil tankers because the industry was in depression, with a third of the world's supertankers out of business. In the early 1980s, the government of Alaska tried to impose additional requirements on oil transportation, with wide-ranging authority over the design, equipment, navigation, operation, certification, inspection, financial responsibility, oil spill liability, cleanup capability and responsibility of oil tankers entering Alaskan waters. 319 industry organized a lawsuit (Chevron v. Hammond), which claimed that Alaska's new oil transportation laws and regulations were unconstitutional. 320 This enabled oil companies to reduce the cost of tankers and to continue using single-hulled tankers instead of safer but more expensive double-hulled tankers. Exxon Shipping Co. also cut down expenses on tanker staff. By 1989, the required number of crewmembers shrunk by a factor 18 as a result of the automation of oil tankers and their transformation to diesel propulsion. 321 Thus, on the Exxon Valdez in 1989, there were only 0.35 crewmembers per million gallons of oil. This meant that the tanker's crew had little time for rest, and felt constantly tired because of the excessive workload. 322 In addition, Exxon Shipping Co. did not implement the agreed system of health checks on all crewmembers before shifts, and made no effort to prevent alcohol and other restricted substances. After the accident, Exxon officials confirmed that they were aware that Captain Hazelwood had gone through a program of alcohol detoxification, but allowed him to command the Exxon Valdez nonetheless. 323 However, Exxon Shipping Co. emphasized that Captain Hazelwood concealed from his supervisors that he kept drinking while on duty. Exxon Valdez crew members, who later admitted drinking with Hazelwood aboard, knew they had violated company rules and had concealed it from the company's management. 324 As a result, nobody within the Alyeska consortium of oil companies, the hierarchy of Alyeska itself, the Exxon Shipping Co., or the regulators of the State of Alaska understood the whole picture of risks, namely that oil was being shipped in tankers with chronically fatigued and in some cases alcoholic staff, in areas that were dangerously vulnerable to large oil spills because of a total lack of oil spill response equipment and reliable personnel. 320 ",

            "text": "In December 1980, the Minister of Petroleum of the USSR sent a letter to the Council of Ministers of the USSR, pointing out the serious deficit in raw materials for the Soviet petrochemical industry in the Volga region. He proposed reallocating a surplus of assorted petroleum gas from the gigantic oil fields of Western Siberia by constructing an 1852 km Western Siberia/Ural/Volga natural gas liquids (NGL) pipeline, to transport a mixture of methane, propane, butane and pentane. He also mentioned that, because there were as yet no rules and regulations for the proposal of such large NGL pipelines in the USSR, the design stage of the pipeline alone would take more than two years. To speed up the construction of the pipeline, he offered to use standard blueprints for oil and gas pipelines and begin construction immediately in parallel with the design of the pipeline. 327 We have already seen how the Soviet civil nuclear industry adopted the practice of simultaneously designing and building sophisticated technological facilities, leading to the tragic consequences revealed in 1986 at Chernobyl. In the case of Soviet petroleum, the consequences of this practice became clear in 1989. Less than a month later, in January 1981, the Council of Ministers of the USSR issued permission to the Soviet Ministry of Petroleum for the construction of a \"crude oil pipeline\", while everybody in the industry was aware that this \"crude oil pipeline\" would in fact be the proposed NGL pipeline. The development was launched immediately. Because the Ministry had available the documentation for standard crude oil pipelines with a diameter of 720 mm, this diameter was chosen for the NGL pipeline. In making this decision, Ministry executives were ignoring the main condition for safe NGL transportation through pipelines, which requires that the diameter of such a pipeline should not exceed 400 mm including the bold wall of the pipe. At that time, nobody in the world was operating NGL pipelines wider than this diameter of 400 mm 328 : this requirement is dictated by the physical features of the hydrocarbon mix in NGLs, which reduces the temperature of the pipe. Moreover, to provide anticorrosive insulation, the constructors used polymer films designed for oil pipelines, 329 not suitable for NGL transportation characterized by continuous temperature changes. The combination of the thin wall of the pipe and of the temperature changes as the mixture flowed through it made the pipeline a highly dangerous structure. And in the case of a break, faster leakage of hydrocarbons from the wrecked segment of a wider-diameter pipeline could greatly increase the magnitude of the disaster. The experience obtained from safe operation of NGL pipelines showed that reducing the diameter of the pipeline to below 400 mm, and constructing several parallel pipelines with lower capacity in each line, constitute efficient preventive measures against giant leaks. During his testimony before the Supreme Court of the USSR, the chief engineer of the project admitted that, with the normal sequence of research, design and construction, the development of the pipeline would have taken 5 to 6 years. But in the design of this pipeline, there had been violations of the normal technological process: the blueprints were provided directly from the Ministry, the design of the pipeline was changed four times and all works were carried out in a rush in order to launch within four and a half years. Other witnesses also confirmed that there had been undue haste, compromising the quality of construction. 330 By 1984, the \"crude oil pipeline\" was in the final stage of construction, and the Ministry of Petroleum proposed the urgent re-commissioning of the pipeline from oil to NLG. 331 Naturally, the USSR had a state regulatory body for the construction industry, responsible for checking project documentation to ensure the safety of buildings and prevent the development of facilities that would violate the rights of individuals or other organizations. But-based on existing construction norms and rules-the regulator rejected re-commissioning of the existing 720 mm pipeline. Obviously, when the pipeline had originally been proposed to transport oil, the pipe diameter and the route were judged to be acceptable; but the new project would involve transporting a far more flammable mixture through highly populated areas of the Ural Mountains. The safe transportation of NGLs through a 720 mm diameter pipeline demanded a total replacement of the type of pipes used. Nevertheless, the Soviet Ministry of Petroleum lobbied the Council of Ministers of the USSR to waive the requirement to assess the new project; and ultimately the pipeline was re-commissioned according to the parameters mentioned above. 332,333 A French international expert in NGL pipeline construction warned Soviet petroleum officials at the design stage that the proposed pipeline would be dangerous to operate. This cautioning warning was ignored by Soviet petroleum representatives, and was not revealed to the Council of Ministers of the USSR, pipeline operators or railway representatives. 334 Because of the tormented landscape of the Ural mountains, and in order to reduce costs and give easy access to maintenance using nearby transport infrastructure, the pipeline was constructed dangerously close to the railway: for 273 km, they were less than 1 km apart. Moreover, the pipeline crossed the bed of the railroad, which included the high traffic Trans-Siberian railway, in 14 places. 335 In this connection, another French expert warned construction team managers that heavy freight trains could generate intensive vibration and that the pipeline would thus require special joints to cope with the impact of this vibration on the pipes; but builders replied that \"all necessary safety measures are stipulated in the design of the pipeline in Moscow and that the joints are not necessary\" 336",

Therefore, in September 1985, builders returned to one segment of the pipeline to construct a bypass around the village of Sredniy Kazayak, which was less than 1 km from the pipeline. According to the project schedule for the pipeline, the residents of the village should have been relocated elsewhere, but in 1985 the village was still inhabited. (There were 35 places along the pipeline where the pipes were very close to populated localities 339 ). By the end of October 1985, the bypass was built and connected to the main pipeline by special valves. During the construction process, a powerful excavator caused considerable mechanical damage to the pipe close to the valves, which became the main cause of the NGL leakage in 1989. Moreover the soil in the area was rocky, but there was no special protection-like, for instance, a cushion of sand-where the vulnerable pipeline ran among rocks. In addition, nobody from the construction and maintenance crews checked the condition of the pipeby ultrasonic scanning or even visual checks-before resuming the flow of hydrocarbons through the bypass section. 340 The pipeline operator was not aware of these hidden defects, but had a very low opinion of the quality of the pipeline construction and design in general: \"When in 1987 the pipeline was transferred from builders to us [the pipeline operator], we conducted an investigation of the condition of the pipeline and recognized that the pipeline was not fit for operation. We drew up a statement with remarks [to the Ministry], but nobody wanted to listen to uswe were forced to accept the transfer of the pipeline into full operating regime\". 341 The initiators and builders of the pipeline received government awards for developing the project in record time.",

But in this instance, the operators generally maintained only 36-38 atmospheres, because of fears that the pipeline would not sustain such high pressure due to the thin wall of the pipes, the low quality of construction and certain features of the NGL mix. 345 Several hours before the disaster, operators received a call from one of their NGL consumers, the Minnibaevsky Gas Processing Plant, that the plant had detected reduced pressure within the pipeline and that the NGL delivery rate had gone down. The pipeline control room was located 250 km from the wrecked segment-and as we have seen, the staff did not have the resources to immediately verify the pressure drop, because there was no telemetry system and the pipeline monitoring squads had been disbanded. To make matters worse, the conversation between the operator and the refinery took place just before a shift change in the pipeline control room, and the outgoing operator was in a hurry to catch the bus home; so all he said to the next operator was that the pressure had dropped and would need to be increased. 346 Because a constantly high pressure had to be maintained ",

Secondly, the timing of the gas warnings in the night from Saturday to Sunday made it difficult to launch a prompt and detailed investigation of the cause of the gas smell by railway workers. Finally, because railways were the major means of transport for industrial goods and passengers alike in the Soviet Union, local traffic controllers had to follow an intensive train schedule-more than 100 trains a day in both directions; they had no authority to decide, without consulting supervisors, to halt a key section of the Trans-Siberian railway. In the hour before the accident, nine freight trains passed the contaminated section. Consequently, passenger trains were given the green light to enter what was to become the disaster zone.",

In 1963, an initial design for the plant was developed. In 1968, construction started on a unique arch-gravity dam, 245 m high. It was ten years before the first turbine of SSHPS began to generate electricity, and another ten years before the whole project was completed. The erection of the dam and the completion of the station took such a long time because of Siberia's extreme continental climate: during the winter months, temperatures can fall to \u221244 \u00b0C. These conditions required special treatments to enable the solidification of massive amounts of concrete, and innovative approaches to many other areas of design and construction, which had never been tested in other projects before the installation of SSHPS. The design of this hydropower station proceeded in parallel with its construction in a manner similar to the design/construction of several of the major Soviet energy projects we have already seen: the first Soviet civil nuclear plant in Obninsk in the 1950s, the RBMK reactor series in the 1970s and the Western Siberia/Ural/Volga natural gas liquids pipeline in the 1980s. As in these cases, the motive of parallel design and construction was to accelerate the commissioning of SSHPS to solve an energy shortage for the heavily industrialized economy of the USSR: the cost of construction had to be minimized, and the USSR lacked the automated computational capabilities to calculate design solutions for such a complex technical project, so the developers had no choice but to test many of their ideas on real operating facilities.",

For example, the Politburo and the State Planning Commission set a deadline for Turbine 1 to be commissioned by December 1978, despite the fact that the builders were behind schedule on the paving by 0.9 million m 3 of concrete: by the deadline, they had laid only 3.2 million m 3 while the design required 4.1 million m 3 to be in place before Turbine 1 could be fully commissioned. This decision to launch Turbine 1 before the dam was fully developed led to changes in the water flow circuit during flooding in 1979, as a result of which the passage of floodwater could not be fully controlled, and the station building and turbine warehouse were flooded. And the subsequent launching of other turbines with the body of the dam still incomplete led to cracking processes in the concrete of some of the dam pillars, and the decompaction of the bedrock foundation, resulting in increased water seepage through the body of the dam and partial degradation of the concrete in these zones. The consequences of these violations of the station's design were subsequently eliminated by the operating personnel when the station was running. 358 In addition, during the construction of the station in the 1960s and 1970s, important safety features for the turbines were not included in the master plan. The absence of these elements predetermined the enormous scale of the accident in 2009 when, due to the failure of just one turbine, the other nine were flooded and damaged. For example, blueprints for the turbines had initially included penstock butterfly valves, which would shut off water flow through the turbines in case of an emergency. If the turbines at SSHPS had been fitted with such valves, the scale of the accident could have been limited to the destruction of Turbine 2 and water would not have uncontrollably flooded other turbines. However, penstock butterfly valves were eliminated from the station's master plans: it was simply beyond the limits of Soviet technology at that time to produce such valves on a scale gigantic enough for the tallest dam in the USSR, and strong enough to withstand the tremendous water pressures involved. Some other safety elements specified in the initial plans (e.g., a shore spillway) were also dispensed with during construction to cut costs and save time; but the projected parameters of power generation and load on the equipment-which had only been envisaged together with these safety elements-were not changed.",

Obtaining a fullyfledged operating permit was postponed because technical shortcomings had emerged in the design of the station, which would require further improvements to resolve. Then in 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed; for the next decade, the new Russian government, which now owned SSHPS, did not have the budget to invest in the station to eliminate these imperfections in the dam and the turbines. 361 This review was available to executives and special engineering staff of Soviet hydropower stations-although not to the public-but information about the incident was scant and the majority in the industry paid little attention to it. After the incident, staff at Nurek hydropower station carried out obligatory sixmonthly tests on the condition of stud-bolts by ultrasound; between 1983 and 2009, 154 stud-bolts on the turbine caps failed the test. 362 Nevertheless, no special ministerial requirement was issued to make this practice mandatory at other stations, including SSHPS. 363 There are several reasons why obligatory ultrasound testing of the stud-bolts on turbine caps was not implemented on all Soviet hydropower stations. Firstly, because Nurek Turbine 1-like all the turbines of the station-was fitted with a penstock butterfly valve, the water flow was cut off as soon as the turbine cap started to tear away from the body of the turbine; so the event remained a minor incident at one of many Soviet power stations, rather than a major nationwide disaster. But because the incident was perceived as relatively unimportant, nobody took it as a diagnostic of a more systemic problem. Secondly, the specialist engineers on any particular hydroelectric facility tend to see their site as absolutely unique: a unique master plan is drawn up for each station, taking into account the specific natural features of the area in which the station will be located, and consequently specific technical solutions will be proposed for the generation of electricity with a given dam height and river flow rate. Although hardware vendors also develop unique equipment for different hydroelectric stations, their experience shows that they often use generally the same technical solution for different stations. Nevertheless, hydropower engineering specialists hold to the belief that their site is unique. This assumption means there is generally far less communication about risks-and even actual incidentsbetween different hydroelectric station operators than between the operators of thermal power plants, which are built to a broadly unified master plan for a whole plant series. In the case of the Nurek hydropower station, neither the turbine manufacturer from Kharkov nor the Ministry of Energy and Electrification of the USSR could imagine that similar processes of turbine bearing vibration and turbine cap stud-bolt fatigue would also be observed on other equipment produced by other manufacturers; in the case of SSHPS, for example, the turbines were designed and manufactured in Leningrad. So, the Kharkov turbine manufacturers made changes according to the repair checklist for its equipment; and when the Ministry were informed by Kharkov about the changes, they passed this information to other producers but did not require them to change their regulations on repairing their turbines. Finally, the operators at SSHPS received no information about the incident at Nurek beyond a brief paragraph in the report we have mentioned.",

            "text": "The new Russian liberal government that replaced the Politburo was strongly oriented towards financial efficiency. This led to a situation where financiers and managers-loyal to the new anticommunist government but with no experience in electro-energetics-became executive managers of RAO UES, and began to implement massive savings by cutting back on capital renewals and investment on safety. In the early 2000s, less than 25 % of RAO UES board members had qualifications in the field of electricity, and most were not competent to manage a potentially dangerous high-tech power generation grid like the Unified Energy System of Russia. 366 In addition, the Russian liberal government was constrained by the terms of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which in exchange for loans required the reform of Russian monopolies in natural gas production, railways and electro-energetics. 367 International financial institutions expected the dissolution of former Soviet unified energy and transport complexes through the promotion of free-market relations between different parts of the complexes. With regard to electro-energetics, this involved the separation of the Unified Energy System of Russia into numerous mutually independent companies for the production, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity. This led to the disintegration of centralized supervisory control over Russian electro-energetics. These statements were shown to be vacuous in May 2005, when the massive Central Russia blackout initiated 35-h power cuts for more than 6.5 million people-half of Moscow, Tula, Kaluga, Ryazan and other regions-resulting from an unskilled response by dispatchers to an accident at the Chagino substation. The substation was equipped with six high-to-low transformers, three of which were built in 1958 and had not been maintained adequately after the collapse of the Soviet Union. An investigation concluded that the equipment at the substation had badly deteriorated-90 % of the equipment was still in operation after replacement age. 372 Other causes of the blackout were attributed to the disintegration of the formerly unified Moscow region energy system. It had been divided into several separate units, each of which was involved in generating, transporting, distributing or selling electricity without strong and efficient coordination between its own dispatchers and those of other units. The Moscow blackout revealed the urgent need for massive investment in Russian electro-energetics, in order to compensate for decades of shortage of capital investment to replace the equipment. If Russia wanted fast economic growth in the mid 2000s, there was an urgent need to get new electric capacity into operation and modernize the existing stations and infrastructure. President Vladimir Putin and his government agreed with the proposal of the liberal, pro-market senior management of RAO UES that they should continue to dismantle the system into generation, transportation, distribution and electricity sale units, which could compete with one another in a free market. The idea of dividing the formerly Unified Energy System of Russia into privatized sections was based on the assumption that these smaller units could be easily controlled and managed by invited domestic and foreign investors. The rationale was that these new private owners would invest billions in Russian electro-energetics, instead of the government having to find the budget for the whole Unified Energy System of Russia. However, it became clear from the outset that these investors were focused on getting short-term return on their investment by raising electricity prices, rather than on the public-service priorities of the Unified Energy System of the previous USSR-whose aim had been to provide a reliable electro-energetics network in a gigantic country with a tough climate, while keeping tariffs low for consumers.",

In its place were six wholesale thermal power generation companies; 14 regional thermal power generation companies; the hydropower giant RusHydro -which operated 53 hydropower stations, including SSHPS, and became the world's third largest hydroelectric power producer and the largest power-generating company in Russia; the Federal Grid Company; the System Operator of the Centralized Dispatching Administration; and other companies. The former chief engineer of RAO UES (1993 -1996 and Deputy Minister of Energy of Russia (1996 Russia ( -2003 estimated that after the reorganization, the number of electricity sale companies quadrupled and exceeded 320; and the total number of power grid companies reached an astronomical level at around 3600. 373 Only about US$36 billion of private investment was attracted 374 in spite of forecasts by the management of RAO UES before the reorganization of a potential $79 billion of investment. 375 Between 2008 and 2012, only 16.1 GW of new capacity was installed, instead of the 21.8 GW that RAO UES management had estimated before reorganization. 376 During this period, the world economic crisis, climaxing with the collapse of Lehman Brothers investment bank and the bailout by the US government of AIG, the largest insurance company in the world, in September 2008, 377 led to a suspension of any significant private investments; and the Russian government through stateowned companies was forced to become once again the major investor in Russian electro-energetics after the apparent failure of RAO UES's reforms. 373 Ten years of reforms within the industry had seen electricity tariffs increase by a factor of ten, from US$0.01/kWh in 1998 to US$0.1/kWh in 2008, and the reliability of the nationwide power supply had gone down as a result of the disintegration of the unified system. 378 Moreover, electricity prices in Russia reached a level 1.5 times higher than those in China and the United States-which made several Russian industries, which had been dependent on cheap power supply, less competitive on the international market. 379 This rise in tariffs was influenced by the need for the industry to attract/recoup investment. Because most of the units of the former RAO UES were now public companies, their managers began to focus on maximizing profits and financial efficiency, instead of the reliability of the sites and infrastructure they were supposed to be running. These became the priorities for the partly government-owned RusHydro-and at SSHPS in particular, according to one member of the Russian parliamentary commission, which investigated the accident at SSHPS: \"The operation of the station was subordinated to the main taskto generate profit\u2026 Therefore, financiers and economists were the main force in RusHydro and, perhaps, they had influence or put pressure on engineering services. It is hard to explain in any other way, why in spite of the fact that the technical lifecycle of Turbine 2 was practically expired, a new turbine had not been ordered and a special plan for the safe operation of the obsolete turbine was not even developed \". 380",

            "text": "Tragic Consequences of the Ultra-Liberal Reforms of RAO UES on the Safe Operation of SSHPS SSHPS had been producing hydroelectric power on a provisional operating permit from 1988 until 2000, because of several technical shortcomings that the Soviet Ministry of Energy and Electrification expected to eliminate during the 1990s. Nevertheless, in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the complicated financial situation of RAO UES, nobody could afford to plough hundreds of millions into constructing the shore spillway for the dam at SSHPS or changing the station's still unperfected turbines. During the 1990s, only minor, inexpensive and urgent maintenance works were carried out. When RAO UES top management began to discuss the reorganization of the Unified Energy System, managers came to the conclusion that the largest hydropower station in Russia could not be recognized as an asset for a prospective public company like RusHydro, given its In spite of these recommendations for major corrections to the flaws of the turbines and other imperfections, there was little serious investment from RAO UES at the beginning of the 2000s. The focus of top managers was on demonstrating the financial efficiency of the assets in order to attract potential investors and raise capitalization value: for ten years from 1998 to 2008 the capitalization of RAO UES rose from US$12 to $50 billion, while the degree of asset deterioration on RAO UES sites increased from 50 % in 1999 to 59 % in 2006; this measure had been 43 % in 1995. 382,383,384 Increasing the flow of water in SSHPS's reservoir, instead of dumping water vainly through the spillway embedded in the body of the dam, made for greater profitability because it raised electricity production on the station. Furthermore, dumping water was even more dangerous for the body of the SSHPS dam, because the idle discharge of water could destroy the base of the tailrace of the dam due to the absence of a shore spillway at that time. Thus, in 2006, the station generated record electricity outputs due to the heightened water inflow to the Yenisei River. In 2006, the net profit of RusHydro was US$47 million, and it continued to rise in the following years: in 2008, it increased more than 12 times to $605 million. 385 On July 3, 2009-45 days before the disaster-the station issued a press release celebrating new record levels of electricity production due to a higher than average inflow of water to the river: \"In June, the historical maximum output of hydroelectric power generation on SSHPS was recorded\u2026 More than 100 million kWh per day were produced\". 386 This record was reached with obsolete turbines, in spite of the recommendations issued in 2000 to replace them. At the time of the disaster, Turbine 2 had been in operation for 29 years and 10 months. The maximum period of operation during which the manufacturer guaranteed full compliance with design specifications was 30 years; but naturally this guarantee assumed timely and comprehensive routine maintenance of the turbine, provided by station personnel or special repair contractors. However, the fact is that at the moment of the accident, no plan was in place for Turbine 2, which would soon come to its 30-year safe operating limit, whether to extend its operation into the following decade or withdraw the turbine from service and replace it. Incidentally, it should also be noted that the station never worked at its full capacity (6400 MW), because the existing electrical network to the station was not able to take a load of more than 4000 MW.",

This company, Sayano-Shushensky HydroRepair-100 % of which was owned by SSHPS-now had to compete with other repair organizations on tenders and provide the lowest possible prices for maintenance of the unique equipment of the station.

However, these holdings collapsed during the 1990s due to privatization and the total lack of funds at power stations to pay for outsourced repairs-so by the time RAO UES was reorganized, the most advanced repair staff in the industry were within the stations rather than with any of the external repair holdings. 385 Annual Report of Joint-Stock Company \"RusHydro\", 2008, p. 57. 386 On Sayano-Shushenskaya hydropower plant recorded maximum power output, press release of SSHPS, July 2, 2009, http://www.sshges.rushydro.ru/press/news/33083.html.",

In order to comply with the formalities of tenders dictated by the reform of RAO UES, the management of SSHPS founded a company called HydroRepair, which began to \"compete\" with Sayano-Shushensky HydroRepair for the station's tenders. Among the founders of HydroRepair were the CEO of SSHPS, the station's chief engineer (who formulated the tender requirements, and after repairs made formal acceptance of the work carried out), the chief financial officer and other executives of the station. 387 This looks like a clear example of a conflict of interests with signs of corruption. But SSHPS management were forced to go through the motions of running both Sayano-Shushensky HydroRepair and HydroRepair in order to prevent inexperienced companies, with no competence in repairing the station's sophisticated turbines, from winning repair contracts. Such companies could easily win contracts simply by offering the lowest price on maintenance work: Russian contracting legislation is flawed in that it requires the buyer to choose the lowest bid on tenders, without taking into consideration the experience of the bidding organizations or the quality of their previous performance (moreover, according to Russian legislation concerning turbine repair works, service companies are not required to obtain licenses, therefore, a company without any experience in repairing turbines can participate in the tenders).",

Nowadays, it is hard to determine the quality of the repair work that was performed on Turbine 2, because of the total destruction of the turbine. Moreover, after the accident, investigators did not look into the legality of contracts with HydroRepair and there was no investigation of the quality of the repairs carried out on Turbine 2 early in 2009. All opinions expressed after the accident about this repair can only be considered as personal assessments by experts and officials, which are not supported by judicial decisions. And these opinions are radically different. For example, a senior representative of the plant designers concluded that the repair of Turbine 2 was made properly according to all existing standards 390 ; on the other hand, an executive member of the Russian parliament's investigation commission, who was on the board of directors at RAO UES between 1997 and 1998 and has been on board of RusHydro since 2013, declared: \" April 21, staff at the station began to detect abnormally high vibrations in Turbine 2, based on data from one of sensors installed inside the turbine.

In 1999, the former director of 409 In other words, this system was collecting information about the vibrations-we know about this because investigators demonstrated an array of recorded vibration data regarding the turbines at SSHPS-but information from the detectors was not recognized by the technical staff as a reliable basis for decision-making. This was because there were four sensors attached to Turbine 2, but only the one for the turbine bearing indicated abnormal vibration levels (up to five times the approved limit), while the others registered acceptable levels of vibration. 410,411 Technical staff had been used to high vibration levels on Turbine 2 for decades, and as we have seen were unaware of the accidents on the Nurek and Grand Rapid stations; so they evaluated the abnormal vibration of the turbine bearing on Turbine 2 during the summer of 2009 as incorrect/inexact, because the other sensors on Turbine 2 did not demonstrate serious deviation from their approved limits. Moreover, even when Turbine 2 was temporarily suspended during the summer months of 2009, the sensor still showed that the vibration of the suspended turbine bearing was 160 \u00b5m. 412 Believing that the sensor was recording the vibration level incorrectly, station managers neither logged this \"faulty sensor\" in their records nor carried out tests on the actual level of the vibration with portable diagnostic equipment. They perceived it as an unimportant defect, which they were not obliged to report to RusHydro headquarters. After the disaster, during restoration work on SSHPS in 2010-2011, an advanced vibration monitoring system was installed on the turbines. Nevertheless, 15 cases of faulty sensors within Turbines 3, 4, 5, and 6 were registered. The main cause of incorrect turbine vibration measurements was \"multidirectional dynamic impulses of forces from the flow of water coming off the rotor blades\". 413 However, during the investigation of the accident, a laboratory examination of the assumed faulty sensor was carried out and its results were presented to the courtit turned out that the sensor was fully functional. 414 But why it showed abnormal vibration when other sensors indicated the turbine's vibration to be within the normal range, will never be known, because the turbine was completely shattered in the accident and all electrical circuits were also destroyed in the ensuing flooding. This means that after the event, nobody can draw any conclusions about the real vibration characteristics of the bearing of Turbine 2 on the day of the accident. It would be unreasonable to claim that the possibility of a sensor fault implies that there was no vibration in the turbine before the disaster. But there is further compelling evidence against such a claim: the head of Rostechnadzor revealed that \"seismologists recorded abnormal vibration at Sayano-Shushenskaya Hydropower Station 15-45 minutes before the accident\". 415,416 Therefore, a combination of evidence allowed investigators to conclude that \"the cause of the destruction of the turbine cap stud-bolts was fatigue cracks in the body of the stud-bolts. A fourth probable reason for the unwillingness to shut down Turbine 2 relates to another hydropower station in the region. In 1988 SSHPS, with its operating output of 6,400 MW, had been combined with the smaller Bratsk HPS for power regulation under the supervision of the System Operator of the Unified Energy System (SO UES) within the whole Siberia region. Bratsk HPS was located 700 km from SSHPS on the Angara River, and had an output of 1,400 MW. At midnight on August 17, 2009, there was a fire affecting the communication channels of Bratsk HPS, which led to loss of control over the station by the dispatcher of the Siberian branch of SO UES. Therefore, the operator ordered SSHPS to launch all available turbines in order to compensate for any possible suspension of output from Bratsk HPS. At 3:14 a.m. on August 17, 2009, Turbine 2 was resumed and was operating automatically as part of the \"regulator group for active and reactive power\" of the Siberian branch of SO UES. On the day of the disaster, the reservoir level at the SSHPS dam was 212 m instead of the optimum level of 197 m. The turbines of SSHPS only had a narrow range of adjustment to their output if the reservoir level was higher than 197 m. This meant that the turbines could operate safely with the reservoir at 212 m only from 0 to 265 MW and from 570 MW to 640 MW. Therefore, during load changes with this heightened reservoir level, the turbines would pass through a \"not recommended for use\" zone between 265 and 570 MW, during which there would be transient hydrodynamic processes, pressure fluctuations and high vibration. From the resumption of operation during the incident at Bratsk HPS, the load regime of Turbine 2 was changed twelve times and the turbine passed six times through the \"not recommended for use\" zone; in the longer period from March 2009, Turbine 2 passed through this zone 210 times-regulations allowed it to pass through the zone not more than 750 times annually-and was there for 2520 s. Thirteen minutes before the disaster, when the dispatcher of the Siberian branch of SO UES gave the order to reduce the output of Turbine 2 from 600 MW to 475 MW, the vibration amplitude of the turbine bearing rose by 240 \u00b5m according to the detector, from 600 \u00b5m to 840 \u00b5m. It is likely that the station's chief engineer and operator staff did not stop Turbine 2 in spite of the obvious extreme vibration within the machine, because of the continuing incident at Bratsk HPS, which was fully eliminated only by 2:03 p.m. on August 17, 2009-roughly 6 h after the disaster at SSHPS. 418 Finally, SSHPS executives were obviously afraid to shut down Turbine 2 over many months because of the potential scandal with the questionable tender practice and inevitable questions about the quality of the repairs over the previous three years. Five months earlier, SSHPS executives had lost an affiliated business with US$30 million turnover due to suspicions about conflicts of interests and evidence of corruption; they did not wish to give any occasion for more inconvenient scrutiny about the business activities they were engaged in on top of their managerial duties. The main reason for such concealment lays in avoiding potential criminal charges against the management of SSHPS for using questionable repair tender schemes as well as in steering clear of questions about the quality of repair of the station's equipment. Long before the disaster, RusHydro had a very long chain of communication of risk information. Typically, RusHydro's top management actually received information about technical incidents-even insignificant ones-not from the managers of hydropower stations but from the RusHydro security services, which monitored the station environment independently from the station's personnel. 419 Thus, a typical reply from stations to any question from Moscow about their reliability was \"everything is under control\". 420 In this case, RusHydro security services also missed the existence of abnormal vibrations in the plant. This is reminiscent of the KGB falling short of recognizing the importance of the SCRAM effect in RBMK nuclear plants.",

The main defendants were given six-year prison sentences. Nevertheless, the accused staff of the station did not accept the judgment, and filed an appeal declaring that the main causes of the accident were the imperfection of the turbine design and the poor quality of production of Turbine 2 at the manufacturer's Leningrad plant, and wider shortcomings in the design of the station. 421 As we mentioned earlier, the prosecutors did not conduct a detailed investigation of HydroRepair's tender practice and the evident conflict of interests involved; nevertheless, most of the founders of HydroRepair were ultimately found guilty by the court in their principal roles as executives of SSHPS, but not as executives of the dubious HydroRepair.",

            "text": "In 1947, in Louisiana State, a first well was drilled by a fixed platform, which was located offshore, out of sight of land. 430 In 1982, the Minerals Management Service (MMS) under the U.S. Department of the Interior was established to regulate such intensive offshore drilling. Due to the widespread idea that government oversight of private enterprise should be kept to a minimum, active lobbying from the industry and cuts in public funding, the budget of MMS dropped from US$250 million in 1984 to less than US$200 million in 2009 (representing less than $100 million in 1984 dollar value due to inflation), even though oil companies progressed considerably in the development of deepwater drilling over this period. 434 The regulator had no budget for hiring advanced specialists who understood innovations in the field, and MMS came to rely on the expertise of deepwater operators and contractors. Moreover, by 2009, the number of unannounced MMS inspections of offshore oil infrastructure reached a negligibly low level compared with the 1980s. 435 The impotence of the US regulator led to a situation where innovations in the safety requirements for offshore drilling, which were widely implemented as compulsory measures in other countries after accidents, were left to the discretion of U.S. offshore drilling operators. 436 For example, in Norway and in Brazil, all deepwater blowout preventers have an acoustics trigger for remote emergency shutdown of a well-these triggers cost over US$0.5 million apiece-but in the USA the use of such devices was optional. 437 In addition, BP did not have a contingency plan for any emergencies arising while drilling the Macondo well, because such plans were not obligatory under U.S. deepwater drilling legislation. 438 When BP filed the plans for the drilling of the Macondo exploratory well to MMS in 2009, the probability of an oil spill in this area was assessed as low (\"[it is] unlikely that an accidental surface or subsurface oil spill would occur from the proposed activities\"). 439 This was despite the fact that, since 2001, according to U.S. officials, there had been 948 fires and explosions on offshore oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, many of which were associated with the drilling of exploratory wells, where the risk of blowouts was extreme. 440,441 Moreover, the U.S. Department of the Interior exempted BP from a detailed evaluation of the environmental impact of the Macondo well after concluding that a massive oil spill was unlikely 442 -in spite of previous MMS study findings that 50 % of tested blowout preventers failed to cut through the pipe and halt the flow of oil during emergencies. 443, 444 In fact anonymous representatives of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement-the federal agency that regulates offshore drilling-had recognized \"that the designs of blowout preventers were not adequate and that new requirements were needed, along with tougher government inspections\". 445 After the accident, new BP CEO Robert Dudley said that BP had never anticipated such a tremendous spill: \"we've been drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, in the deep water for 20 years now. You just never see an accident like this\". 446 However, in 1979, there had been a blowout on the Mexican Ixtoc I oil rig in the south-western part of the Gulf of Mexico, which was unable to shut down for 10 months at a depth of just 50 m, and which resulted in 3 million barrels of oil being discharged. 437 The Minerals Management Service (MMS) has also been accused of being corrupted by oil companies in return for money, sex favors and drug. 447 After the disaster, MMS was dismantled and replaced by two separate organizations (Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE)).",

The non privileged cement testing, in part because it wanted to eliminate any risk that this evidence would be used against it in any trial that would attempt to determine the adequacy of Halliburton's cement job on the Macondo well. In return, Halliburton blame BP for reducing the number of centralisers, a course of action that allowed hydrocarbons to escape through channels that formed in the cement liner. 458 In 2013, in its coverage of the trial, Dow Jones Newswires published the following statement: \"Halliburton had concealed and failed to disclose evidence 'as part of an effort by upper management to ratify and conceal Halliburton's preblowout callous disregard for safety'\". 459 Moreover, during the trial, former Halliburton lab manager testified \"that a company official asked him not to record the results of a cement stability test related to BP's blown out Macondo well\". This allowed BP to declare: \"Plaintiffs respectfully submit that Halliburton willfully and intentionally concealed and/or otherwise failed to preserve and/or timely produce and disclose material evidence and/or potentially relevant evidence to the parties and to the court in advance of trial\u2026 The cumulative effect of Halliburton's pattern of destruction and spoliation of evidence has been to deprive the court and the parties of significant post-incident evidence relevant to the inherent quality and performance of the cement Halliburton provided for the job at the Macondo well, and the role of that Halliburton slurry design as a cause of the events of April 20, 2010\". 460 Tommy Roth, Halliburton vice president, noticed that \"these tests weren't authorized and he didn't know about them\" and that he was aware \"in April 2011 that a Halliburton employee had conducted unauthorized tests and in 2012 that the results were discarded\". 461 After the cement job on the morning of April 20, 2010, the staff of the platform made several tests of the well's integrity (positive-and negative-pressure tests). The positive-pressure test passed successfully, but the negative-pressure test showed contradictory information. Operators interpreted this data as the \"bladder effect\" and concluded that the negative-pressure test was successful. 462 \"Many BP and Halliburton employees were aware of the difficulty of the primary cement job. But those issues were for the most part not communicated to the rig crew that conducted the negative-pressure test and monitored the well\". 463 So nobody from the rig crew immediately informed decision makers, either on the platform or at onshore headquarters, about the apparently contradictory condition of the well. On being questioned by a Transocean executive \"You got everything under control 458 here?\" the drilling master said \"Yes, sir\"; to the question \"How did your negative test go?\" a rig crew member answered \"It went good\". 464 For everybody on the platform, the blowout that followed was unexpected. For a number of technical reasons, the blowout preventer on the Macondo well failed to cut the pipe, and a flow of oil and gas began to surge from the well. BP managers arrived on the day of the disaster to celebrate the safety award earned by Transocean for the previous year and all staff members were eager to party. The staff did not wait long enough for the cement to dry and they did not see the blowout coming through a series of faults due to the haste to finish the well. They died for it.",

Dr. M. Elisabeth Pat\u00e9-Cornell, in a discussion of the lessons to be learnt from the Piper Alpha disaster in 1993, wrote: \"The culture of any industry that discourages internal disclosure and communication of bad news leads to ignoring small incidents and near-misses as long as they do not result in full-scale accidents. In such an environment, the fact that a severe accident did not occur seems to be sufficient proof that the system works and that 'an inch is as good as a mile'. The possibility that several minor problems could occur at the same time does not seem to be considered. Consequently, small, isolated incidents are seldom 464 Ibid, pp. 5-7. 465 Ibid, p. 115. 466 Months before the explosion, Jean Laherr\u00e8re, then assistant to the VP E&P of Total, visited the Piper Alpha platform and discovered that all safety rules were ignored in the production process. But on the day following the explosion, a manager of the UK department of Trade and Industry announced in the media that all safety rules had been respected! (private communication, Dec. 18, 2014). 467 M. Elisabeth Pat\u00e9-Cornell, Learning from the Piper Alpha Accident: A Postmortem Analysis of Technical and Organizational Factors, Risk Analysis, 1993, 13(2), 226. discussed openly since they would constitute a black mark for the personnel involved. Therefore, the same problems are likely to recur elsewhere. In fact, even when an accident does occur, appropriate measures to avoid its recurrence are not necessarily taken. The permit-to-work system, for example, had failed before, in particular on Piper Alpha in 1987, when a worker was killed\u2026 The accident was the result of a breakdown of communications in the permit-to-work system and an error in the shift handovers. In spite of memos and warnings to other [offshore installation managers], the lesson was not learned on Piper Alpha itself\". 468 After the explosion, the safety rules were updated, showing that they were previously insufficient and inadequately enforced. In their turn, BP, Transocean and Halliburton also failed to learn the serious lesson of Piper Alpha.",

Later, the U.S. Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimated the leakage at between 5000 and 8000 barrels per day 474,475 -still just 10-15 % 468 the actual discharge from the well-and these estimates became official during the following four weeks. 476 Ultimately, in the first few days-the most important time in any crisis-this underestimation of the seriousness of the spill affected not only public perception, but also the response inside the crisis team, which led to a delay in preventive measures for oil dispersion and collection far away from the coastline. For example, Louisiana State declared a state of emergency only on the ninth day after the accident. Surprisingly, American oil-spill removal organizations were not able to supply enough containment booms for such a large oil spill. After the well was finally capped, the federal government released a report entitled \"BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Budget: What Happened to the Oil?\" in which they assumed that 75 % of the spilled oil was \"gone\". 477 However, the public and the media were skeptical about these estimates: \"From the start of the disaster, the government has badly underestimated the amount of oil spewing from the runaway well. That poor track record makes people understandably skeptical of [the Oil Budget] report\". 478 The Center for Public Integrity revealed that, in the hours after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig caught on fire, the US Coast Guard failed to follow its own internal firefighting procedures. 479 They did not call for an expert to assist them and poured 6000 tons of salt water per hour on the rig to attempt to extinguish the fire, while it is well known that fires involving hydrocarbon fuels should be quenched with foam and not water. As a consequence, the ballasts of the platform were filled with water causing it to sink and, dramatically, the riser piper to rupture. And the riser pipe did not start leaking until after the rig sank. According to Jean Laherr\u00e8re, a retired geologist and oil engineer from Total who is known for his work on risk management of the oil industry, the lack of competence and communication concerning fires of hydrocarbon substances led to the wrong decision with horrendous consequences. 480 From a technical point of view, letting the fires burn (until extinction with the right foam 481 ) and keeping the platform afloat would have avoided the marine pollution and would have allowed to shut off and secure the riser. Could it have been that some decision makers found more appealing to sink a very visible and inconvenient blaze from the media and public? Moreover, the discussion of the U.S. Coast Guard actions would have been also problematic, given the political and public will to pass on the blame to BP, Transocean, and Halliburton, with good reasons. 476 ",

The Raspadskaya coal mine itself was the largest underground mine in Russia with reserves of 450 million tons of coking coal: the mine produced up to 20 % of the coking coal in Russia and was among the top ten coking coal producers in the world.

The privatization of coal mining in Russia in the 1990s deteriorated the situation regarding production safety. Most of the current Russian underground coalmine projects were designed in the 1960s and 1970s, when the productivity of coal-plow machines was modest.

This led to a situation where the productivity of the mines increased manifold and the length of coal roadways expanded to hundreds of kilometers, but the capacity of ventilation systems for the timely elimination of methane and the anti-coal dust equipment in the mines did not keep pace. In addition, private owners did not have the resources to ensure preventive degassing of the methane from the belts prospective coal belts by the process of expensive drilling of special degassing wells to depths of up to 500 m: each well could cost up to $1 million and hundreds of wells are required for each coalfield. Over a period of up to five years, these wells allow for the concentration of methane within a prospective coal belt to be seriously reduced. 485,486 Such methods are used in the United States and Australia, where it is strictly prohibited to produce coal if a coal belt releases more than 9 m 3 of methane per ton of coal. 487 However the new Russian private owners, instead of investing in expensive methane venting equipment and a comprehensive system for degassing the coal roadways of prospective coal belts, usually preferred to pay compensations to the families of coal miners killed in methane blowouts-just US$35,000 per death. 488 Sergey Slastunov, a professor at the Russian mining university, commented on the situation: \"Nowadays, Russia has 50 mines, in which the concentration of methane has increased, but in our country, no one spends on degassing: this process takes at least three years. Therefore, the owners of the mines cannot waitthey need to quickly make a profit, and for them it is cheaper to bury the miners, rather than to wait a few years until the methane is eliminated\". 489 The government's approach to overseeing the mining industry was based on the assumption that private owners would not violate safety procedures because of their own interest in the long-term productivity of mines, which would bring stable profitability and growing business capitalization value. However, experience showed that this assumption did not uphold in practice. Private owners focused only on short-term profitability instead of long-term benefits, as in many other cases involving various industries reported in this book. At the same time, accusations of extortion and corruption by some representatives of the state regulator in the coal industry led to the deregulation of government control.

As a result, the regulator could issue countless orders to mine managers, who would just ignore them with no serious impact on the profitability and functioning of the mines. 490 During the decade before the accident, Raspadskaya mine was considered a leader in safe coal production in Russia. For example, in August 2002, the mine was selected for its exemplary safety record as a site for a field meeting of the State Council to discuss the problems of developing Russian coal mining; the meeting was attended by the President of Russia, ministers, and all the top executives of the Russian energy sector. 491 Nevertheless, after the accident, a very different picture of the working conditions at the mine emerged. In the 16 months before the accident, the regulator issued more than 1400 orders to eliminate safety violations at the mine, but the majority of them were ignored because the legislatively approved penalties were not enough of a deterrent. On four occasions, the regulator threatened to disqualify the mine director, but they could not act on their threats because there was no legal framework to back them up after the deregulation of state oversight. 492",

A comprehensive system for degassing the coal roadways had been installed in the mine; but the performancerelated pay system motivated coalminers to illegally block the methane detectors-which indicated dangerous levels of methane in the air when the new highly productive coal-plow machines were in operation. The methane detectors would have otherwise automatically halted coal production on the whole roadway until 490 Tatiana Zykova, Coal without the right to live. Rostehnadzor needs to regain the authority to halt unsafe mines without a trial, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, July 7, 2007. the air had been degasified. The blocking of the methane detectors thus ensured continuous coal production and maintained the coalminers income. 494 This led to a situation where the degassing system recorded completely inaccurate data about the concentration of methane within the mine. Therefore during any criminal investigation, it would be hard to prove the direct guilt of managers, because they had not directly ordered workers to continue coal production in methane-saturated air. Because the system would not have recorded a high concentration of methane, it would appear that there had been no such high concentration during the hours before any accident, and that the blowout must either have had an unavoidable cause-such as a sudden unpredictable methane emission-or been the fault of the miners who had blocked the methane sensors. Therefore, the miners themselves were unofficially allowed to make decisions about their own productivity and income\u2026 as well as safety. Because Kuzbass has a high rate of unemployment, thousands of young, strong but poorly educated workers were glad to get a coalmine job with a salary exceeding the average income in the region; the owner of the Raspadskaya mine, at a meeting with its personnel before the accident, stated that \"if somebody does not like the job, he could leave the company and the management of the coal mine could easily hire cheap Chinese coal miners\". 495 As a result, the blocking of methane detectors became a widespread practice in many Kuzbass coalmines.",

In both accidents, it was revealed that there had been extensive blocking of the methane detectors, leading to the accumulation of methane to dangerous concentrations. The owners and management of both mines had put in place a payroll scheme that unofficially forced coal miners to violate safety rules in order to increase the profitability of coal production. 496 In the case of the Ul'yanovskaya mine, prosecutors found out in addition that management had corrupted representatives of the state safety regulator, who developed a strong loyalty to the managers so as to turn a blind eye to safety violations. In return, the coalminers even provided computers and office supplies to the regulator. 497 After the accident at the Raspadskaya mine, investigators found out that, at the time of the disaster, 40 % of the methane detectors in the mine were inoperative: the seals on 150 out of 400 detectors had been 494 Revelation by miners about the practice of blocking methane detectors reported by journalists of \"Week with Marianne Maksimovskaya\", REN TV, May 15, 2010 and \"Kvant\" local TV channel of Keverovo region (May 10-16, 2010), http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IIWCvgnEWc. 495 Revelation by miners about the practice of blocking methane detectors reported by journalists of \"Week with Marianne Maksimovskaya\", REN TV, May 15, 2010 and \"Kvant\" local TV channel of Keverovo region (May 10-16, 2010), http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IIWCvgnEWc. 496 The cause of methane gas explosions in \"Ul'yanovskaya\" and \"Yubileynaya\" mines was pursuit of profit, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, June 6, 2007. 497 Natalia Telegina, Victor Dyatlikovich, Why mines explode, Russian Reporter, May 20, 2010, \u2116 19 (147). 498 This could also explain the massive fire, which continued for years after the accident burning out 300 km of coal roadways: over the years when methane detectors had been routinely blocked, neither management nor regulators nor coalminers had received any real data about the actual methane concentration in the air throughout the mine. After the accident, the owner of the coalmine admitted that he could not imagine that a disaster of such a tremendous scale could ever take place in reality. 499 Ironically, the financial results of this economy based on biased incentives were devastating for the mine owners who had unofficially supported such dangerous practices. 500 After the accident, restoration costs were estimated at US$280 million, on top of the losses of the burned-out coal. 501 Six months after the accident, the market value of OJS \"Raspadskaya\", which had been the most lucrative coal company in Russia, had dropped by 59 % from US$6 billion to US$1.88 billion. 502 Total losses from the accident exceeded hundreds of times the profits resulting from implementing the remuneration system that had motivated miners to violate safety standards. The accident provoked social upheaval in the miners' hometown, where 3000 participants of a post-accident meeting and hundreds of other workers clashed with the police. This attracted the attention of government executives and the accident site was visited by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. The accident led to new regulations on coal mining in Russia, bringing, amongst other changes, a new legal framework for the payment of miners.",

            "text": "On March 11, 2011 at 2:46 p.m., a seaquake of magnitude 9.0-9.2 on the Richter scale occurred 70 km from the east coast of the Tohoku region in Japan. This was the largest earthquake ever recorded in Japan, and the United States Geological Survey considered that it was the fifth largest recorded worldwide since 1900. 504 The earthquake generated a large-scale tsunami, which reached the coastlines of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures approximately 50 min after the main shock, destroying hundreds of kilometers of coastline infrastructure and killing more than 18,800 people. 505 There were five NPPs located in the disaster zone on the east coast of Japan. Several were hit by the tsunami but, at the Fukushima-Daiichi plant owned by Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO), the largest electric utility in Japan, it led to a severe nuclear disaster-level 7, the highest level on the International Nuclear Event Scale. The plant had 6 reactors (Units 1-6) and large pools with spent nuclear fuel, but only Units 1-3 were operating when the seaquake occurred: Units 5 and 6 were shut down for routine inspection, and Unit 4 was on reconstruction. The emergency shutdown (SCRAM) system on all operating reactors was activated successfully after the main shock. The maximum ground acceleration at the Fukushima-Daiichi plant was 550 Gal (550 cm/s), 506 while the containment vessels were designed to retain functionality up to a seismic ground acceleration of 270 Gal and important buildings, structures, and equipment piping systems were designed to withstand 180 Gal. 507 Although the ground acceleration of the seaquake was beyond design limits, Unit 1 only had a leakage of coolant. 508 However, the plant lost all AC power sources because the earthquake had destroyed both external transmission lines and the Shin-Fukushima transformer station. DC power sources (diesel generators and batteries) generated electricity to cool the reactors for the next 51 min-until the tsunami reached the plant. 509 The maximum designed height of the protective seawall of the NPP was 5.7 m. 510 Vulnerable objects like seawater pumps were located beyond the seawall-4 m above sea level; diesel-generators and batteries were inside the reactor buildings-10 m above sea level. 511 But the tsunami waves generated by the Tohoku seaquake had built up to a height of 14-15.5 m by the time they hit the plant. 512 As a result, Fukushima-Daiichi NPP lost all sources of electricity to cool the reactors of Units 1, 2 and the spent fuel pool of Unit 4; Unit 3 had battery power for about 30 h; emergency diesel engines provided emergency power only to Units 5 and 6. Damage to the reactor core -and the resulting meltdown of nuclear fuelbegan on Unit 1 3 h and 15 min after the tsunami struck, on Unit 3 after 43 h and on Unit 2 after 76 h. 513 There were 257 tons of nuclear fuel in the three operational reactors-Units 1 and 2 were fuelled by low-enriched uranium (LEU) and Unit 3 was fuelled by mixed oxide (MOX) fuel that contained plutonium-and 264 tons of spent nuclear fuel in the pool of Unit 4 at time of the disaster. 514, 515 had been planning to get more than 50 % of its energy from nuclear energy by 2030. In 2011-2012, Japan faced a serious shortage of electricity for industrial and domestic needs-by mid-May 2011, only 17 out of the remaining 50 reactors in the country were operating due to intensive safety inspections. From May until July 2012, all Japanese nuclear reactors were suspended. This led to additional spending of US$40 billion on hydrocarbon fuel imports. 524 The shutdown of Japan's entire nuclear fleet has had profound economic consequences for the country due to the US$134 billion trade deficit in 2013 brought about by increased fossil fuel imports and lower productivity. Higher electricity prices and increased CO 2 emissions are also of concern. Together with on-going dire economic problems of the \"two lost decades\" following the bursts of the stock market and realestate bubbles in Japan in 1990, this additional stress is catalyzing a reassessment of these political decisions. In June 2014, the three major business lobbies urged the Industry Minister to expedite restart of the nuclear reactors. \"The top priority in energy policy is a quick return to inexpensive and stable supplies of electricity\", they said. 525 There thus seems to be a rising political will to reinstall the nuclear industry as a major source of energy in Japan. For instance, in July 2014, Kyushu's Sendai nuclear power plant has been given draft approval to restart by Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA), having met the greatly upgraded safety requirements published in July 2013. This is a major step towards actually returning to service, after Kyushu committed some US$3 billion on post-Fukushima upgrades for its nuclear plants. So far, ten more PWRs (pressurized water reactors) are queued for approval by NRA, the reconstituted safety regulator, plus seven BWRs (boiling water reactors), which required more major upgrading and also need formal approval from local government. 526 After the accident, the National Diet, Japan's legislative body, established the Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission (NAIIC) with the legal authority to request-and take action to obtain-any necessary documents or evidence required. During the investigation, the commission performed interviews with 1167 people and organized 900 h of hearings. The commission concluded that the \"accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant cannot be regarded as a natural disaster. It was a profoundly manmade disasterthat could and should have been foreseen and prevented. The accident was clearly 'manmade'. We believe that the root causes were the organizational and regulatory systems that supported faulty rationales for decisions and actions, rather than issues relating to the competency of any specific individual. We found an organization-driven mindset that prioritized benefits to the organization at the expense of the public\". 527 524 Nuclear Power in Japan, World Nuclear Association, updated Feb. 2014. 525 World Nuclear Association, weekly digest 11 and 18 July 2014. 526 Ibid. 527 The official report of The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission, The National Diet of Japan, Executive summary, July 5, 2012, p. 21.

There was a deep seated conflict of interests: the primary goal of NISA was to protect society from radiation threat but, at the same time, NISA focused on the energy independence of Japan-which meant supporting large low-cost electricity production from a large number of nuclear plants, and maintaining a stable financial climate for private operators of nuclear plants to enable the further development of nuclear energy. For decades, a cozy relationship developed between operators, regulators and academics, which led to a situation where \"the regulators and the operators prioritized the interests of their organizations over the public's safety, and decided that Japanese nuclear power plant reactor operations 'will not be stopped'.",

In addition, according to Akihisa Shiozaki, an attorney who was instrumental in putting together the first independent, non-governmental investigation of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the government and the industry were reluctant to consider worst-case scenarios because of Japan's unique history: after World War II and the destruction of Nagasaki and Hiroshima by nuclear weapons, the Japanese population vehemently opposed all use of nuclear power in their country. Therefore, at the beginning of civil nuclear development in Japan, the government undertook a campaign to persuade people of \"the absolute safeness\" of nuclear power. \"Absolute safeness meaning that there was no risk that something could go wrong, no risk that a meltdown could happen. Well, that myth of absolute safeness developed over the years into a culture where it almost became a taboo to even talk about this\u2026 Discussing a worst-case scenario was feared because it might bring panic to the citizens. And therefore it was omitted from the regulatory discussions\". Eric Feldman, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, considers that there were significant political and economic forces backing nuclear power, and that as a result, \"talking about worst-case scenarios was avoided not simply because it would scare people, but because such fear would mean that local communities would oppose the building of reactors, and without local support the reactors would not be built\". 535 Consequently, the government and the industry thought they did not need to implement serious safety improvements learnt from the experience of foreign nuclear accidents because Japanese stations were already designed for severe disasters like high-magnitude earthquakes. In 1991, this assumption led to a situation in which safety measures applied on Japanese nuclear stations became voluntary and independent from the control of regulators: \"the accident management, including expedient and flexible measures that might be required under actual situations, shall be considered and implemented by the operators based on their 'technical competency' and 'expertise', but [it] shall not require authority to regulate the specific details of measures\". 536 After the accident, it was revealed that Japanese nuclear operators had ignored and/or delayed implementation of many IAEA recommendations and guidelines about safety measures generated by nuclear accidents elsewhere in the world. 537,538,539 Moreover, reluctance to reveal the failure of Japanese nuclear plants to conform to international standards, and fears of the possible restructuring of the nuclear community in Japan, led to the decision by the Japanese nuclear regulator to decline overseas scientific assistance to Fukushima-Daiichi NPP. 540 The NAIIC commission stated: \"this was a disaster 'Made in Japan'\u2026 Its fundamental causes are to be found in the ingrained conventions of Japanese culture: our reflexive obedience; our reluctance to question authority; our devotion to 'sticking with the program'; our groupism;",

Tsunehisa Katsumata, appointed as president of TEPCO after the falsification scandal, revealed \"serious cases of inappropriate conduct in which employees should have reported cracks in the shroud to the national government [and] failure to keep records of problems. The engineers involved were afraid that, if they notified the national government of the problem, they would have to shut down the plant for a longer period of time than planned. This fear resulted in a conservative mentality that led them to avoid reporting problems to the national government as long as they believed that safety was secured. Engineers, who were reluctant to report problems, therefore eventually came to believe that they would be allowed not to report faults if the faults did not pose an immediate threat to safety and, as a result, they went as far as to delete factual data and falsify inspection and repair records\". 542 The same practice occurred within other nuclear operators-for instance, in 2007, Hokuriku Electric Power confessed to hiding a nuclear incident on Shika NPP in 1999. 543 Nevertheless, according to research of James Acton and Mark Hibbs, \"the relationship between NISA and the Japanese government, on the one hand, and that between NISA and industry, on the other, was not fundamentally challenged\" after the falsification scandal. 544",

            "text": "probability was small and other measures were in place. It then asked the operators to write a report that would give the appropriate rationale for why this consideration was unnecessary\". 547 An important reason why the regulators and TEPCO underestimated the risk of a high-wave tsunami was that the Japanese nuclear industry had focused so much on the possibility of earthquakes. They felt confident that they had made comprehensive calculations that guaranteed safety from beyond-design accidents. In the 1960s, when the Fukushima-Daiichi plant was designed by American companies General Electric (who designed the boiling water or BWR reactors) and EBASCO (who designed the plant), its foundations were at a height of 35 m above sea level on a bluff, but civil engineering staff of TEPCO lowered the bluff by 25 m in order to mitigate the threat posed by earthquakes and reduce the cost of running the seawater pumps. 548 The maximum expected height of a tsunami wave near Fukushima-Daiichi NPP was only 3.1 m above sea level, based on 13 earthquake tsunami statistics dating from 1611. Among them, the 1960 Chilean Earthquake tsunami, at 3.122 m, was the largest tsunami to have hit the Fukushima coastline since 1611. 549 Nevertheless, since 1498, there had been 12 tsunamis off the coast of Japan and the Russian Kuril Islands with maximum amplitudes of more than 10 m-half of which had maximum amplitudes over 20 m-generated by earthquakes with magnitudes between 7.4 and 9.2. 550 In particular, the Jogan Jishin earthquake in AD 869 occurred near the Fukushima Daiich Nuclear power plant, and created the largest tsunami in this region until that of 2011. The Active Fault and Earthquake Research Center (AFERC) developed a detailed study the Jogan Jishin earthquake tsunami. 551 Based on the study, 552 Mr. Okamura, a researcher at AFERC, warned in 2010 the nuclear and industrial safety subcommittee, the seismic and structural design subcommittee, and the working group for \"earthquake, tsunami and geological features, the ground\", that there was a possibility for a huge earthquake and tsunami near Fukushima. The meeting was held at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) in June 24, 2010, and TEPCO officers were included as member of the working group. Mr. Okamura asked the officer of TEPCO (Mr. Nishimura) why the official report of the meeting did not 547 The official report of The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission, The National Diet of Japan, Executive summary, July 5, 2012, p. 16. 548 The official report of The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission, The National Diet of Japan, Chap. 1. Was the accident preventable? July 5, 2012, p. 23. mention the Jogan Jishin earthquake and the associated risk of a huge tsunami. He called for a thorough investigation of the risk of unexpected tsunamis. In spite of Mr. Okamura's warning, TEPCO never prepared for the risk. 553 The design of BWR reactors located on the ocean coastline of Japan came from American experience of reactors sited near rivers, which had never been intended to face sudden high-level waves or flash flooding. American engineers placed backup emergency diesel generators and DC batteries in turbine buildings around 4 m above sea level, and TEPCO agreed with this solution because nobody expected a tsunami wave of more than 3.1 m. 554 NISA never objected to this solution because the regulator had focused for decades on earthquake-resistant solutions rather than dealing with any possible tsunami threat. NISA also preferred to fund academic grants on earthquake safety, thereby marginalizing tsunami safety. 555 During the construction of the Fukushima-Daiichi NPP, Toshiba engineers wanted to improve on the General Electric design, but TEPCO blocked any major changes: \"TEPCO, conservative by nature, didn't allow the Japanese companies building the plant to make any alterations to GE's basic design\u2026 [TEPCO] told the Japanese makers to build the plants exactly in the same way as those of foreign makers\u2026 TEPCO was very bureaucratic\". 556 And once the Fukushima-Daiichi plant was operating, many engineers there were worried about the placement of the generators: \"If an earthquake hits and destroys some of the pipes above, water could come down and hit the generators. DC batteries were also located too close to the diesel generators. It's not at all good in terms of safety. Many of the middle-ranking engineers at the plant shared the same concern\". 557 In 2002, when the Japan Society of Civil Engineers issued a new tsunami assessment method for nuclear power plants, TEPCO raised the estimation of the maximum tsunami to which the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant could be exposed to 5.7 m and notified NISA. However, the company made only minor improvements, which did not affect the position of emergency generators and backup batteries. 558 553 The certified agenda of the METI meeting and extracts of the meeting (in Japanese) were communicated to us and translated by Professor Kaizoji and are available from the authors upon request. 554 Reiji Yoshida, GE plan followed with inflexibility, The Japan Times, July 14, 2011. 555 James M. Acton, Mark Hibbs, Why Fukushima Was Preventable, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Mar. 2012, p. 29. 556 Reiji Yoshida, GE plan followed with inflexibility, The Japan Times, Jul 14, 2011. 557 Ibid. 558 The official report of The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission, The National Diet of Japan, Chap. 1. Was the accident preventable? July 5, 2012, pp. 24-25. The risk of a potentially severe accident never appeared in TEPCO's list of risks. Any question about operating risks and nuclear safety was under the competence of the on-site plant department and would never have been raised at central risk management meetings. 559 Masatoshi Toyota, a former senior vice president of TEPCO and one of the executives who oversaw the construction of the Fukushima plant, stated: \"I didn't know until March 11 that the diesel generators were placed in the turbine buildings. If I had known, I would have definitely changed that\". 560 The Japanese \"reluctance to question authority\" and their slow bureaucratic system, geared only to passing on good news, led to a situation when executives had little understanding of the real condition of their plants and were fully satisfied with reassuring reports from the stations. Moreover, the TEPCO corporate system \"tolerated or encouraged the practice of covering up problems\" 561 so that \"utilization of risk information was insufficient, and the risk of [a station blackout] was not widely recognized by the management\". 562 The regulator required that \"nuclear reactor facilities shall be designed such that safe shutdown and proper cooling of the reactor after shutting down can be ensured in case of a short-term total AC power loss\". 563 However \"short-term\" blackout, for the majority of nuclear plants, meant just 30 min or less, because of the high-performance repair service of transmission lines in Japan after earthquakes. Nuclear executives \"fundamentally believed that, if we lost off-site power, we would be back up on the grid in no more than about half an hour\". 564 After the accident at the Fukushima-Daiichi plant, TEPCO Chairman Tsunehisa Katsumata said that the possibility of an unanticipated tsunami-resulting in a blackout lasting days rather than hourshad not been communicated internally to him when he was president of the company in 2008, because \"such [a] tsunami would not happen in reality\". 565 This assumption was clearly demonstrated by the complete lack of response from TEPCO management to a chain of great natural disasters and scientific warnings in the preceding few years. Thus, the company's engineers took no account of an incident on the French Blayais NPP in December 1999, when the extratropical storm Martin brought a combination of high tide and strong winds, flooding the 559 The official report of The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission, The National Diet of Japan, Executive summary, July 5, 2012, p. 44. 560 Reiji Yoshida, GE plan followed with inflexibility, The Japan Times, July 14, 2011. 561 James M.

The company shared this information with NISA. 568 The group also asked for 25 million dollars to implement appropriate measures, but TEPCO executives said that the study session had been conducted as training for junior employees, and that the company did not really expect such a large tsunami. 569 In February 2008, TEPCO engineers, following new simulations taking recent events and the longer historical perspective into account, stated that a tsunami wave between 9.3 and 15.7 m in height could hit Fukushima-Daiichi NPP. However Sakae Muto, Deputy General Manager of TEPCO's Nuclear Power Plant Division in 2008, and others thought that no urgent action was required because such a tsunami was very unlikely. 570 Therefore, they did not convey the results of the simulations to the president of TEPCO. During NAIIC commission hearings, Tsunehisa Katsumata, who was president of TEPCO between October 2002 and June 2008, confirmed that he had never received any information about the threat of a tsunami leading to a total blackout at a TEPCO station during his presidency. 571 \"Information [about tsunami risks] was stopped at [TEPCO] headquarters\" 572 because \"the majority view in the company was that no major tsunami was likely\". 573 In fact, TEPCO bureaucrats reported the results of the simulations to NISA only three years after the simulations, on March 7, 2011, four days before the disaster. 574 It is remarkable that this risk was not revealed to NISA when the regulator was making the decision to issue a new ten-year license for the 566 ",

After the earthquake, this system had started up automatically, but the operators of Unit 1 soon recognized that the condenser was cooling the core too quickly and shut it down manually in order to protect the reactor from damage. 581 After the tsunami, when operators lost all information from all gauges, they could no longer evaluate the condition of the condenser. Moreover, communication between the on-site emergency control center and each control room was limited to a single wired telephone line. 582 In addition, it was impossible to walk anywhere on the site of the plant in the first few hours, because of debris caused by the tsunami. 583 According to an investigation by Japanese public broadcasting corporation NHK, involving dozens of interviews with TEPCO staff 584 over the previous 40 years, the isolation condenser had never been tested during safety checks-so nobody on the plant knew that, during correct functioning of the condenser, it should emit a loud sound and large amounts of redundant steam escape through holes in the wall of the reactor building. Due to the absence of data from instruments, and their own lack of technical knowledge, operators and management of the plant assumed that the isolation condenser was working properly, even though staff at the plant heard no noise and observed little or no steam flowing from holes in the wall of the reactor building. 585 As a result, they conveyed incorrect information to their superiors. In reality, reactor core damage and the meltdown of nuclear fuel on Unit 1 set in just 3 h and 15 min after the tsunami hit. But it was only 21 h after the tsunami that TEPCO confirmed that the isolation condenser had not yet been used, remarking reassuringly that \"we are implementing a measure to reduce the pressure of the reactor containment vessels in order to fully secure safety. The reactor water level is decreasing, we will continue injecting water step by step\". 586 During the investigation, TEPCO officials declared that they had failed to respond promptly to the loss of cooling functions because they mistakenly believed that an emergency core cooling system was still functioning after the tsunami. 587 They probably believed that the cooling function could be restored within that time frame. So they issued a 581 The official report of The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission, The National Diet of Japan, Chapter 2.

While there are problems with the power source, the nuclear chain reaction has been completely stopped. The only thing left is to cool the reactors\". 589 In reality, with no cooling taking place, pressure inside the reactors of Unit 1 and Unit 3 reached twice the design limit between 8 and 11 h after the tsunami. 590 The main threat of high pressure inside BWR reactors is the possibility of the containment vessel exploding, releasing huge quantities of radioactive materials-dozens to hundreds of times more than were emitted at Chernobyl. 591 US protocols on handling accidents at similar reactors call for venting before pressure exceeds the design limit. 592 According to the NAIIC commission report, \"[t]he actual on-site situation of the vent in Unit 1 was not communicated to NISA or the Prime Minister's office [Kantei] , which helped create an atmosphere of distrust between TEPCO's on-site management, the regulatory agencies and the Prime Minister's office\". 593 TEPCO was unwilling to vent, because they knew that venting radioactivity would cast doubt on the safety of the nuclear industry around the nation. 594 Exposure to radiation is a very sensitive theme for the Japanese after the nuclear destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In addition, the staff of the plant would not easily be able to vent the reactors: without electricity for the air compressors, the manual opening of vent valves was a very laborious and time-sensitive task, which would require preventive evacuation of nearby residents due to radiation emissions. 595 In the NAIIC hearing, Sakae Muto-executive vice president of TEPCO and general manager of the nuclear power plant division at the time of the disaster-confirmed that he was aware that TEPCO could not manage such a severe accident independently, but did needs. 596 Consequently, the Japanese government did not take emergency measures such as large-scale military helicopter assistance to transport diesel generators, air compressors, batteries, pumps, and so on to the site on the day of the disaster. Instead, the unhurried TEPCO tried to transport the needed staff by car, on roads disrupted by traffic jams! After the disaster, the Japanese military said that forces did not move in because they were not requested by TEPCO. Japan's Self-Defense Forces had personnel and equipment at the ready 15 miles away, but \"we have to wait for TEPCO to come to us and request help\". 597",

            "text": "There was a lack of fresh water sources at the site for emergency reactor cooling. There was plenty of salt water from the ocean-but using salt water would render the reactors permanently inoperable, resulting in billions of dollars of assets being lost. Akira Omoto, a former TEPCO executive and a member of the Japan Atomic Energy Commission, confessed that \"[TEPCO] hesitated because it tried to protect its assets\". 598 Operators and management at the plant did not have the credentials to make this decision, and available TEPCO managers were reluctant to take responsibility for it because the President of TEPCO was out of Tokyo on a business trip and the Chairman was in China. According to the NAIIC commission \"The top three management members (the president, chairman, and vice president) were unavailable when the accident broke out. [ The chairman] only found out that the president had been away after the accident happened. A lack of a sense of impeding crisis was obvious from the fact that [the chairman] made no contact with the president after the president's return from abroad until his return to the head office\u2026 At the time of the accident, neither the Chairman nor the President of TEPCO were present or accessible, an inconceivable situation for an operator of nuclear power plants. The Chairman and the President also had different understandings of the emergency response structure, a fact that very likely contributed to the delay in TEPCO's response to the accident\". 599 But 24 h after the tsunami, a hydrogen explosion occurred on Unit 1, and the Prime Minister of Japan Naoto Kan intervened. The NAIIC commission described his influence: \"[Because] the situation deteriorated and the planned government accident response systems failed to function, control of the emergency response was taken by the Kantei, with Prime Minister Kan at the center of an ad hoc group of politicians, advisors and the chairman of NISA. This group included people who were neither experts nor had an adequate understanding of the on-site situation\". 600 TEPCO finally began to pump seawater into Unit 1 reactor 29 h after the tsunami; and it was not until the third day after the tsunami that they started to use seawater for the other reactors. 601 At the time, Naoto Kan complained that TEPCO \"has almost no sense of urgency whatsoever\" and on the sixth day after the disaster, when the situation had reached the worst-case scenario-meltdown of three reactors and a fire in the spent nuclear fuel pool of Unit 4-the government shifted full responsibility for dealing with the situation from NISA and TEPCO to the military. build new ones. 605 Obviously, in March of 2011, NISA and TEPCO executiveswho had had a cozy relationship for decades and shared the old history of falsification and risk information concealment within the industry-represented the camp opposite to that of Naoto Kan. In the crisis, this led to mutual distrust. Thus, the NAIIC commission found out that \"TEPCO had been reporting to NISA, as was the standard protocol, that it was in the process of venting [on Unit 1]. But there is no confirmation that the venting decision was conveyed to senior members of METI, or to the Kantei. This failure of NISA's function and the scarcity of information at TEPCO headquarters resulted in the Kantei losing faith in TEPCO\". 606 METI executive Banri Kaieda described the situation vividly: \"from immediately after the breakout of the accident, communicating and sharing information among the accident site, the Kantei, and TEPCO headquarters was like the telephone game 'whispering down the lane'\". 607 During the NAIIC testimony, Naoto Kan stated that when he questioned them about the reasons for the delay with the venting process on the first day of the disaster, TEPCO answered: \"we do not know\". 608 Moreover, he remarked that TEPCO did not have the same technical background as General Electric, which designed the BWR reactors on Fukushima-Daiichi NPP, and questioned whether TEPCO staff fully understood their structure and technical pattern. 609 Due to the absence of valid information from TEPCO executives and NISA, the Kantei \"participated in discussions of technical matters regarding the nuclear reactors. Prime Minister Kan asked for the mobile phone number of the head of the plant at Fukushima, leaving the top management of TEPCO out of the loop\". 610 This mistrust reached its peak 15 h after the tsunami when Naoto Kan, dissatisfied with the lack of information about conditions at the plant and the venting process on Unit 1, flew by helicopter to Fukushima-Daiichi NPP in order \"to understand the situation, as he could not obtain any meaningful information from the members of NISA, the NSC, or the technical advisor from TEPCO\". 611 TEPCO also failed to inform him immediately when Unit 1 exploded 24 h after the tsunami-so the leader of Japan was informed about the explosion by TV news! In the ensuing telephone call with TEPCO executives, Prime Minister Kan exclaimed: \"What the hell is going on?\", because nothing had been said to him for about an hour. 612 Kenichi Shimomura, former deputy director general for public relations and chief spokesman of the Kantei, described the impossible situation in which Naoto Kan found himself: \"Being a leader without information\u2026 information about the nuclear crisis was a luxury we did not have in the prime minister's office at the time\". 613 Although TEPCO and the regulators \"had agreed on how to deal with the vent and the injection of seawater, the Kantei was unaware of this, and intervened, resulting in further disorder and confusion\". 614 In its turn, TEPCO and NISA were also unaware of the details of discussions held among Kantei members, since Prime Minister Kan surrounded himself with numerous experts of his own, independent from them. 615 As a result, managerial decisions about the plant and the evacuation were discordant. In addition, both sides held press conferences and briefings separately. Ultimately, the Japanese public and the international community concluded that the authorities and the industry could not communicate, manage and take responsibility for such a challenging event, and this caused panic both inside Japan and worldwide.",

            "text": "The lack of reliable information about the situation on the plant led to a chaotic organization by the Kantei of the evacuation of residents in areas neighboring the plant. There were further examples of risk information concealment. The Associated Press found and reported one case: \"Yukio Edano, the chief Cabinet spokesman, is the face of Japan's government. At 7:45 p.m. [around four hours after the tsunami], his job was to make an unprecedented statement to the nationbut made it sound routine and reassuring. ' We have declared a nuclear emergency,' he said from behind a podium in the press conference room at the prime minister's office. 'Let me repeat that there is no radiation leak, nor will there be a leak'. He was wrong. Recently released TEPCO documents revealed that radiation was detected at the plant perimeter at 5:30 p.m. [two hours after the tsunami], but the utility apparently didn't fax those readings to the government until shortly after 9 p.m.\". 616 The NAIIC commission revealed that \"regarding the disclosure of an increase of reactor vessel pressure at Unit 2, TEPCO issued a press release about seawater injection at 23:00 on March 14, but made no disclosure about an increase in radiation dosage at the entrance of the plant that occurred between 19:00 and 21:00 on the same day. TEPCO also downplayed the severity of the situation in their disclosure regarding the critical problems in the suppression chamber of Unit 2; moreover, there was a significant delay between the time when TEPCO informed the Kantei and when it disclosed the information publicly. TEPCO noted that they did not inform the public of an increase in reactor vessel pressure at Unit 3, as of 8:00 on March 14, because NISA had banned the release. In fact, the Kantei had merely instructed TEPCO to inform them of the contents of releases when they were made. In obeying NISA's order to halt the release of this crucial information, TEPCO effectively prioritized its own interests and those of NISA over the greater good of the public and their right to be informed \". 617 As a result, \"the central government was not only slow in informing municipal governments about the nuclear power plant accident, but also failed to convey the severity of the accident. Due to the breakdown in communication from the central government in the post-accident time period, neither the Fukushima prefectural government nor the central government were aware of each other's actions: for example, the Fukushima prefectural government unilaterally ordered that residents within a two-kilometer radius of the plant be evacuated, based on prior emergency prevention training. This was followed 30 minutes later by the central government ordering the evacuation of residents within a three-kilometer radius. Similarly, the speed of information in the evacuation areas varied significantly depending on the distance from the plant. Residents were informed of the accident a few hours after it occurred, but they did not receive any information about the situation or the accident, or information that would be useful for their evacuation. Many residents had to flee with only the barest necessities and were forced to move multiple times or to areas with high radiation levels. There was great confusion over the evacuation, caused by prolonged shelter-in-place orders and voluntary evacuation orders. Some residents were evacuated to high dosage areas because radiation monitoring information was not provided\". 618 The government also did not use data from the SPEEDI system (System for Prediction of Environment Emergency Dose Information), which had been designed in the 1980s to make forecasts of radiation dispersal, because \"the information was incomplete\": the earthquake and tsunami had injured some sensors near the plant. \"Without knowing the strength of the releases, there was no way we could take responsibility if evacuations were ordered,\" said Keiji Miyamoto, who manages SPEEDI. 619 However, some experts consider that \"officials there did not want to take responsibility for costly evacuations if their estimates were later called into question\". 620 On the sixth day after the disaster happened, the U.S. State Department advised American citizens to evacuate from the area within a 50-mile (80-km) radius of the Fukushima Daiichi NPP, 621 but, at the same time, the Japanese government started to evacuate citizens from within a 20-km radius. TEPCO officially confirmed the meltdown of all three reactors only after 2 months when all rods inside the reactors were melted: the \"delay in confirming the meltdowns at Fukushima suggested the utility feared touching off a panic by disclosing the severity of the accident earlier\". 622 Taken together, these events have provoked strong public anxiety and distrust of the Japanese nuclear industry and the government. During his testimony, Yuhei Sato (Governor of Fukushima Prefecture at the time of the accident) told the commission that \"the government failed to provide the necessary information at the time of the accident: \"I still cannot trust the government\"\". 623 This likely contributes to the fact that the majority of Japanese support the phasing out of nuclear power.

They called the disease \"dancing cat fever\". Initially, scientists thought that it was an infectious disease but, when they tested marine creatures on the coast nearby, they discovered extremely high levels of mercury contamination, which was determined as being caused by industrial wastewater discharge from the adjacent Chisso Corporation chemical factory. The factory used mercury sulfate as a catalyst in the production of acetaldehyde, and had been discharging the compound into Minamata Bay for 25 years. And seafood from the bay had been the main diet of local residents and their domestic animals for decades. Chisso Corporation knew about the potential damage to the health of locals and to the environment, but was reluctant to construct expensive wastewater treatment facilities. Moreover, the company continued to discharge mercury-contaminated waste after the cause of the disease had been confirmed. It lobbied to cut back pollution control regulation, and obstructed detailed investigation by scientists and the media. Ultimately, 2265 victims have been officially certified-1784 of whom died from the poisoning-and over 10,000 people have received financial compensation from the company, which paid out a total of more than US$170 million. 625 During the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear disaster described above, many commentators compared the neglectful behavior of TEPCO with the actions of Chisso Corporation during the Minamata crisis. They concluded that, in the intervening 50 years, the Japanese industry had not changed in its willingness to risk the health, and even the lives, of local residents through its activities. 626 ",

Francis Baring, one of the founders of the bank, described it as \"unquestionably the first merchant in Europefirst in knowledge and talent, and first in character and opulence\". 637 In 1986, Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government suddenly deregulated the British financial sector and allowed traditional commercial banks to provide investment bank services (for instance, securities brokerage and securities underwriting). They wanted to increase the competitive advantage of British banks on the international markets and ensure the status of London as one of the world's financial centers. Following the deregulation, Barings Bank secured more than 50 % of its total profit from securities. 638 In 1989, Nick Leeson came to Barings in London from Morgan Stanley, to take a back-office position focusing on the control of security transactions. Soon, he was sent to Indonesia for another back-office project, working with stock certificates and bearer bonds. In 1992, he was appointed to the position of general manager and head trader at Barings Securities (Singapore) Limited (BSS). There, he had clearance for \"transacting futures and options orders for clients or for other firms within the Barings organization, and riskless arbitraging of price differences between Nikkei futures traded on the SIMEX [Singapore Exchange] and Japan's Osaka exchange\". 639 Given his lack of trading experience, many of his deals were not making profit, and he began to hide his losses via an already existing secret \"client\" account, number 88888. By February 1995, he had generated losses of over US$1.4 billion (\u20a4827 million) and brought Barings to bankruptcy. Incredibly, neither external auditors, nor supervisors, nor regulators had detected Leeson's true position prior to the collapse. 640 Leeson admitted that the main reason why he had concealed his own losses and falsified his profits was \"fear of failure\"because the surrounding environment, both on the Singapore stock exchange and within Barings bank, extolled success and profits and despised failure and losses: if his true losses were revealed, it would highlight his \"incompetence, negligence and failure\". 641 He also expected that the consequences of his deception would be dramatic, but not catastrophic for the entire Barings business.",

            "text": "From 1992 to 1995, Barings headquarters and internal control did not spot the hidden losses, for several reasons. Firstly, Leeson, as both general manager and head trader of BSS, combined the functions of trader and back-office manager. These roles were usually divided between different people, from different departments of an investment bank and with different professional missions: earning money through deals as a trader, keeping risks within acceptable limits and keeping deals legal as a manager. In this period, BSS \"was operated almost entirely by Leeson alone\". 642 Secondly, Leeson had more than 5 years' experience as a back-office clerk in Morgan Stanley and Barings Bank; he had a very clear understanding of the shortcomings of the internal control system of a huge financial institution. Thus, his secret \"88888\" account escaped detection by several external and internal auditors-who accepted a forged guarantee letter, and sent reports to top managers back in London assuring them that Leeson's transactions were credible. Two other major rogue traders-Jerome Kerviel from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, who lost US$6.9 billion in unauthorized trading, and Kweku Adoboli from UBS who lost US$2.3 billion-also worked in back-office departments before their trading careers. 643 Thirdly, both the senior management and those responsible for control functions at Barings had a merchant banking background: they knew little about derivatives 644 and associated them with tremendous risks. Later, Leeson characterized Barings managers as \"idiots\" 645 who did not understand the basics of the futures trading business: \"How little did the management of Barings know about what was going on? They had no clue. In 1994 [they] came from London, New York, and Tokyo to receive an award from SIMEX for the 'Highest Customer Volume'\". 646 Because they knew so little about derivatives, the management team was blinded by falsified profits from Singapore, which had a direct influence on their annual bonuses; they believed that Leeson was making fully matched trades at no real risk to Barings. 647 Thus, they continued to send money to Singapore to cover Leeson's losses, comforting themselves that Leeson would bring them millions: \"[Barings was] driven to make profits, profits, and more profits\u2026\". 648 \"[I]t was their greed that lay at the root of the whole problem. They did not want to know about the internal structure of the firm\". 649 For instance, in 1993, Leeson's \"transactions\" appeared to be making 10 % of all Barings' profits.",

At the time, this was the largest bankruptcy in US history, though this record was subsequently beaten shortly thereafter by WorldCom in 2002 in a similarly accounting scandal-with lost assets of US$107 billion-and then again in 2008 by Lehman Brothers, who lost more than US$600 billion in assets. 653 Enron had a predecessor, Metallgesellschaft AG, whose aim it copied. Metallgesellschaft was formerly one of Germany's largest industrial conglomerates based in Frankfurt, with 20,000 employees and revenues in excess of 10 billion US dollars in 1993. It had over 250 subsidiaries specializing in mining, specialty chemicals (Chemetall), commodity trading, financial services, and engineering (Lurgi). 654 The unsuccessful maturity transformation in Metallgesellschaft's hedging long term contracts with short term futures 655,656 was echoed by banks and derivative dealers in the financial disasters discussed below. It is interesting to note also that, upon Metallgesellschaft's collapse in 1993, virtually all its staff were hired by Enron in the early days. 657 Enron focused on wholesale merchant and commodity market businesses, management of retail customer energy services, operation of gas transmission systems, and management of energy-related assets and broadband services through approximately 3500 domestic and foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. For years before the bankruptcy, Enron executives routinely practiced fraud in the firm financial records in order to increase Enron's perceived revenue, so that the company's value in the market-and their own income-would continue to grow in the 653 These loss estimations for these three bankruptcies assume that the asset valuations before the bankruptcy were true. Since extraordinary inflation of asset valuations has been one of the causes for the bankruptcies, these considerable loss figures must be taken with a grain of salt. Later, accounting frauds were found at WorldCom, Tyco, HealthSouth, and other companies, in investigations triggered by the undermined trust of millions of American and foreign investors in the credibility of financial reporting and audit processes in the United States. Moreover, another accounting scandal at the Italian dairy producer Parmalat revealed a \u20ac14.3 billion hole in the company's account sheets in 2003; an investigation found that senior managers at Bank of America, Citigroup, Deloitte & Touche and Grant Thornton were also involved in the fraud. 660 To restore public confidence, the US Congress hurriedly enacted on July 30, 2002, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, also known as the 'Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act' (in the Senate) and the 'Corporate and Auditing Accountability and Responsibility Act' (in the House), regulating the disclosure of information by U.S. public company boards and management, public accounting firms and investment banks. Under the new legislation, directors or accountants found to have knowingly concealed financial risks from investors and regulators in a firm's accounting would face decades in prison. Unfortunately, these changes could not prevent inflating earnings and routine concealment of debts-through off-balance-sheet partnerships or repo agreementsduring the subsequent real estate bubble and the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. Ernst & Young, Lehman Brothers' auditors, knew about debt concealment in the company (repo agreement 105 temporarily removed as much as $50 billion in bad assets from their balance sheet in 2008), but did not inform the Board of Directors or the regulators. 661 \"So the mere passage of a statute does not appear to 658 Report of investigation of Enron Corporation and related entities regarding federal tax and compensation issues, and policy recommendations. InterNorth Inc., Enron was left with a monster debt of US$4.3 billion. Moreover, because of deregulation, Enron lost exclusive rights on its pipelines in the highly competitive natural gas market, and natural gas prices went down: gas producers were able to sell sources directly to end users, and required pipelines to run their volumes for a simple transport tariff. 666 Searching for a new strategy, which could generate profits and cash flow in the long-term, was a real challenge for the Enron management team. 667 In 1987, Lay started to hear about unauthorized-and sometimes fabricatedoil commodities trading at Enron Oil Trading (EOT), one subdivision of the former InterNorth Inc. Traders were running double books and using undisclosed accounts to \"[move] excess profits from one [accounting] quarter to the next through entities operating outside the Enron books\" 668, 669 Later, internal investigation found out that traders made these actions in Enron's interests. The unit seemed profitable: in 1985, the company as a whole showed US$79 million losses, recovering to make US$557 million profit in 1986, while EOT earned US$10 million in 1985 and US$28 million in 1986 without need of capital investments in infrastructure. 670 This case demonstrated to Enron's management the possibility of earning money without investment in low-profit real energy infrastructure by using a flexible accounting approach. Ultimately, the management sent a fax to Enron Oil with the following message: \"please keep making us millions\u2026\". 671 In 1987, Enron Oil Trading generated losses of up to US$1 billion, but ultimately Enron managed to reduce them to US$142 million; however, an EOT executive was found guilty of fraud and sentenced to 1 year in prison. 672 In spite of these losses, Lay realized that commodity derivatives were a new prospective market for Enron, which could gain billions with proper management. When in 1989 Jeffrey Skilling, then a management consultant at the Houston office of McKinsey & Company, offered to establish \"Gas Bank\" service for Enron, insuring long-term fixed prices on natural gas for buyers and suppliers by means of futures and options, Lay offered Skilling an executive position at Enron Finance Corporation to enable him to implement this \"trading partners\" strategy. 673 It was the first step in Enron's transition from an old-fashioned regional energy company to an innovative nationwide energy-trading corporation. During the following few years, Enron successfully became the largest energy trader in the United States with more than 25 % of the country's gas and electricity transactions, Houston became the Wall Street of energy trading, 674 and Enron launched significant energy trading on the British deregulated wholesalers market and initiated operations in more than 30 countries. The company even changed its mission statement, announcing its intention \"to become the world's leading energy company\" 675 and later issued a new one: \"we make markets\". 676 As an interesting fact, John LeBoutillier, former Professor of Harvard Business School where Jeffrey Skilling graduated near the top of his class, remembered that Skilling stated at that time: \"I'd keep making and selling the product [in spite of the fact that it was discovered that his fictional company produces a potentially lethal product]. My job as a businessman is to be a profit center and to maximize return to the shareholders. It's the government's job to step in if a product is dangerous\". 677 In 1997, Jeffrey Skilling was promoted to President and Chief Operating Officer of Enron, his mission to bring about the full-scale transformation of the company into a global energy-trading corporation. Under his leadership, Enron's annual revenues rose from about US$9 billion in 1995 to US$100 billion by 2000. 678 In 1999, Enron launched Enron Online, an internet trading site for electronic commodities: Enron was counterparty to every transaction conducted on the platform, with credit risk management to ensure a safe trading environment. By the following year, Enron Online had traded a total of US$335 billion. 679 By 2000, trading operations produced about 99 % of the company's income, 88 % of income before tax and 80 % of identifiable assets. 680 In 1996, Fortune named Enron the most innovative company in America, and they continued to award this title to Enron for the next six years until the company went bankrupt. 681 ",

            "text": "Active lobbying for deregulation of the energy and financial sectors played an important role in Enron's growth. Lay had a cozy relationship with the Bush family as a devoted friend and major contributor to the gubernatorial and presidential election campaigns of George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush and other Republicans. 683, 684, 685, 686, 687, 688 This familiarity helped Lay and Enron to benefit from the easing of government control in several spheres. Firstly, George H. W. Bush was Vice President of the USA during the eightyear presidency of Ronald Reagan, who in his turn was an apologist for deregulation in many spheres, including finance, transport and energy. Reagan declared his position in the following way: \"Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem\" 689 ; \"We who live in free market societies believe that growth, prosperity and, ultimately, human fulfillment are created from the bottom up, not the government down\u2026 [We] believe in the magic of the marketplace\". 690 From 1989 to 1993, George H. W. Bush continued Reagan's deregulation strategy as President of the USA in his own right. In the dozen years of Republican power, new principles were established for the federal deregulation of the American wholesale and retail electricity markets. In the 1990s, this energy deregulation continued on a state level. For example, Pete Wilson, the Republican Governor of California from 1991 to 1999, implemented state electricity deregulation in 1996: the state sold their own power plants and bought electricity from a single wholesale pool, the California Power Exchange. 691 However in 2000-2001, an electricity crisis erupted in California. Enron energy traders manipulated the supply of electricity-creating an artificial power shortage and causing blackouts by shutting down Californian power plants-to jack up state wholesale prices by 1000 %; the price of natural gas (in Enron's pipelines) jumped by the same amount. 692 Enron earned billions on Californian energy contracts and overpriced natural gas. After the 2000 presidential elections, George W. Bush, on Lay's recommendation, appointed Pat Wood (former chairman of the Public Utility Commission of Texas) as Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates the transmission and wholesale sale of electricity, natural gas and oil in interstate commerce, and so on. Spencer Abraham, Bush's Secretary of Energy, had previously received campaign contributions from Enron as Republican senator for Michigan. 693 In spring 2001, when Gray Davis, the Governor of California, asked George W. Bush's Republican administration for a federal response to the state's electricity crisis, Bush refused any federal government intervention or price controls. He maintained that California legislators had left too many regulatory restrictions in place in the electricity market, and that the federal government had nothing to do with energy companies manipulating the market; and he personally did not see Enron's role in the California crisis. 694,695,696 The passive attitude of the Bush administration was likely motivated by the wider political context, in particular, given that California had voted for the Democratic candidate Al Gore in the recent presidential elections, and Democrat Gray Davis had presidential ambitions for the 2004 election cycle. 697 Moreover, Davis had earlier signed the nation's first state law requiring car makers to limit auto emissions-damaging the interests of oil companies and car manufacturers, both heavyweight supporters of the Republican Party through campaign contributions. This crisis helped Republicans reverse the gubernatorial election result by the electoral recall of the incumbent, for only the second time in American history: ultimately, Davis was succeeded by Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger in November 2003. 698 In an analogous political context, in 2005, the federal govern-ment responded similarly passively to the Hurricane Katrina crisis, when Democrat Kathleen Blanco was Governor of Louisiana. And in 2008, Republican Bobby Jindal duly won the gubernatorial election in Louisiana.",

Bush's presidency, Enron started trading natural gas commodities and commodity derivative financial contracts. From this time, along with the investment banks, Enron lobbied for the removal of regulatory restriction on over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives-and particularly energy derivatives-from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In 1989, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \"began requiring that managers make specific disclosures of financial contingencies and off-balance-sheet arrangements when a particular 'trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty' was 'reasonably likely'. [However] , if management determined that the contingency was not reasonably likely to occur, no disclosure was required \". 701 And on January 30, 1992, SEC accepted the mark-to-market accounting method for the energy contracts of Enron Gas Services group, which later allowed Enron to voluntarily calculate its revenue by the market value of derivative trading and to create the illusion of being \"larger\" than General Electric, Citigroup, or IBM. 702 Active lobbying continued after George H. W. Bush lost his second presidential race in 1992-for which Lay was co-chairman of Bush's re-election committee. Derivative traders also found support from Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve during four US presidencies (Reagan, Bush, Clinton and Bush), and from Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers, Secretaries of the US Treasury during Clinton's terms-who were all ardent apologists for deregulation in the financial sector. 703 This deregulation would ultimately be a significant catalysis in the dynamics ending with the global financial and economic crisis in 2008-2009. In 2001, Harvey who has represented each of the \"Big Five\" accounting firms, 704 including Arthur Andersen, was appointed as Chairman of the SEC in George W. Bush's administration. 705 Over decades of lobbying, the SEC budget was consciously reduced 706 ; meanwhile the complexity of derivatives trading was rising.",

These methods were based on reporting, for deals on the Enron Online platform and elsewhere, \"the entire value of each trade on which it was a counterparty as its revenue, rather than reporting as revenues only its trading or brokerage fees\". 708 A similar accounting approach was also applied in other companies like Dynegy, Reliant Energy and El Paso, even though investment banks used the more conservative \"agent model\" based on brokerage fees alone. 709 According to the calculations of Bala Dharan and William Bufkins, Enron's revenues were \"increased as much as fifty times, compared to what they would have been under",

Frequently, these profits depend on assumptions and estimates about future market factors, the details of which the companies do not provide, and which time may prove wrong'\u2026 Enron used revenuesnot profits [reported profits were microscopic relative to revenues]as its primary financial objective, performance driver and measure of success. Enron's use of distorted, 'hyper-inflated' revenues was\u2026 important to it in creating the impression of innovation, high growth and spectacular business performance\". 710 And, with consulting support from the Houston office of Arthur Andersen, Enron financial executives used special purpose entities (or special purpose vehicles or financial vehicle corporations) to hide debts and losses from Enron's balance sheets in order to keep Enron's credit rating on investment grade and keep down the cost of capital borrowing. When Jeffrey Skilling became Enron's chief operating officer in 1997, CFO Andrew Fastow developed a network of 3000 special purpose entities, which were unconsolidated on Enron's balance sheet. He did this \"to accomplish favorable financial statement results, not to achieve bona fide economic objectives or to transfer risk. Some transactions were designed so \u2026 Enron could have kept assets and liabilities (especially debt) off its balance sheet\u2026 They allowed Enron to conceal from the market [between 1997 to 2001] very large losses resulting from Enron's merchant investments by creating an appearance that those investments were hedgedthat is, that a third party [partnership with companies Chewco, LJM1, LJM2, Condor, Raptor I-IV and other] was obligated to pay Enron the amount of those losseswhen in fact that third party was simply an entity in which only Enron had a substantial economic stake\u2026 These transactions resulted in Enron reporting earnings from the third quarter of 2000 through the third quarter of 2001 that were almost $1 billion higher than should have been reported\u2026 In virtually all of the transactions, Enron's accounting treatment was determined with extensive participation and structuring advice from Andersen, whose management reported to the Board of Enron. Enron's records show that Andersen billed Enron $5.7 million for advice in connection with the LJM and Chewco transactions alone, above and beyond its regular audit fees\". 711 In the 1990s, there was the longest bull market in the 710 history of the USA, 712 but in the early 2000s the market was under the impact of the dot-com bubble burst and the 9/11 attack. \"If the market reversed, mark-tomarket accounting required the recognition of losses, possibly enormous losses\u2026 Enron hid, delayed or ignored the loss. Andersen apparently did not question any of the values assigned to the contracts or object to tactics to hide, delay or ignore losses. Some of Enron's most abusive special purpose entities were created to avoid reporting mark-to-market losses\". 713 Due to accounting falsifications, from 1996 to 2000, Enron's declared that its market value grew by more than 4 1 / 2 times, reaching over US$60 billion-70 times earnings and six times book value. 714 In this five-year period, Enron paid five executives more than US$500 million via options, bonus payments and salaries. 715 Because of the cozy relations between Enron executives and American politicians, regulators failed to prevent the worst-case scenario from happening in the Enron case. However, during the five years leading up to the bankruptcy, other audiences failed to recognize-or helped to cover-the concealment of risk by Enron executives: the company's auditors, its board of directors, other employees, investment banks and the media.",

The units within Arthur Andersen competed with each other, failed to communicate about the problems of their clients and sought only permanent growth of revenue regardless of the source of that revenue, the quality of clients or the legality of their recommendations. 716 Enron was Arthur Andersen's second largest client worldwide-the largest was WorldCom, which filed for bankruptcy in 2002-and the largest client in the accountants' Houston office. 717 The Houston office of Arthur Andersen provided both auditing and the new consulting service to Enron. Andersen consultants helped to implement aggressive accounting and the use of special purpose entities (more than 70 % of the fees that Andersen received from Enron came from consulting) while at the same time, the Andersen audit unit earned US$1 million a week for internal and external auditing (less than 30 % of Enron's payments to Andersen). 718 Enron had no fraud examiners and no internal audit department. 719 Enron outsourced their own \"internal audit\" to Arthur Andersen and many of Enron's internal accountants and controllers were former Andersen executives. 720 Joseph Berardino, Andersen's chairman, testified that \"in the previous year (2000), Andersen had received $52 million in fees from Enron, of which only $25 million could be directly attributed to the audit. Of those fees, $13 million were clearly for consulting work and the remaining $14 million is arguably related to the audit because it is work that can 'only be done by auditors'\". 721 The bonuses of staff at the Houston office of Arthur Andersen depended on Enron's stable growth, and many Andersen employees, \"[l]ured by promises of undreamt-of-wealth\u2026 aspired to work for Enron and were therefore very reluctant to 'rock the boat' with the company\". 722 Ultimately, this led to a situation where auditors approved falsified accounting reports in order to earn more.",

            "text": "Under the leadership of Jeffrey Skilling, who got the nickname of Darth Vader for his ruthless behavior, 730 a \"cut-throat\" corporate culture, unusual for an energy company, was developed at Enron. This culture would have been more appropriate for an investment bank. Because the mark-to-market accounting approach allowed the recording of profits from long-term deals in the current year, it put enormous pressure on traders to keep providing gigantic new deals, which continued Enron's revenue and market capitalization growth. According to Peter Fusaro and Ross Miller: \"Enron's corporate culture was essentially focused on two things: The first was profits and the second was how to make even greater profits. The firm didn't strive to create long-lasting business relationships and had little desire to be involved in anything that smacked of the low margins associated with retail-oriented business\". 731 At Enron, it was not the quality of a deal but the size of the deal and the maintenance of a constant 'deal flow' 732 that mattered: \"Good deal versus bad deal? Didn't matter. If you could give it a positive Net Present Value it got done\". 733 As soon as a deal was done, the trader immediately received compensation and forgot about the future of the deal. Therefore, the entire staff of Enron was focused on short-term output. 734 Enron preferred to hire \"the best and the brightest\" young MBA school graduates, who at first were too inexperienced to understand the real flaws of Enron's corporate system-but were very smart, aggressive, and hungry to make short-term money. Enron paid extremely large rewards to traders who met their earnings targets: some common traders were able to earn up to US$15 million a year. 735 The corporate message was simple: \"If you were smart enough and tough enough to work at Enron, you deserved to live like last year's Oscar winner\". 736 On bonus day, luxury car dealers set up showrooms around the Enron headquarters building. In 2000, the base salary at Enron exceeded the peer group average by 51 %, bonus payments by 382 % and stock options by 484 %. 737 Because employees' pension funds were invested in Enron stock and significant compensation was in the form of stock options, employees were motivated to increase Enron's capitalization by any means. In exchange for such large compensation, Enron claimed enormous productivity, total loyalty to superiors and faith in Enron's unique path: the staff were nicknamed \"Enronians\" and \"believers\". 738 Moreover, Jeffrey Skilling created the most rigid system of selection and ranking of personnel in corporate America. The system was called the Performance Review Committee (PRC), and it focused on assessing the amount, profitability and permanency of the deals an employee had brought into Enron during the previous six months. Every six months, 15 % of staff found themselves on the bottom rank of the PRC rating; if they remained there in the next review, they were fired. 739,740 Such a system strengthened competition and atomization between traders, which prevented anyone in the company being honest with anyone else about the risks they were taking: \"Clearly, the switch from affirmation to punishment within Enron meant that employees regularly received mixed messages. On the one hand, they were the cleverest and best in the worlda form of positive reinforcement, or love bombing, that it would be hard to better. On the other, they could be branded as 'losers', and fired at any time. Consistent with general cultic norms, the overall effect was disorientation, an erosion of one's confidence in one's own perceptions and, most crucially, a further compliance with the group's leaders that strengthened conformist behavior in general\u2026 It is clear that Enron management regarded kindness as a show of weakness. The same rigors that Enron faced in the marketplace were brought into the company in a way that destroyed morale and internal cohesion. In the process of trying to quickly and efficiently separate from the company those employees who were not carrying their weight, Enron created an environment where employees were afraid to express their opinions or to question unethical and potentially illegal business practices. Because the rank-and-yank system was both arbitrary and subjective, it was easily used by managers to reward blind loyalty and quash brewing dissent\u2026 [There was a] prevailing culture [of] 'the undiscussability of the undiscussable also undiscussable'\u2026 [A] former senior manager's summary of the internal culture: 'There was an unwritten rule\u2026 a rule of 'no bad news.' If I came to them with bad news, it would only hurt my career'\". 741 \"Paranoia flourished and trading contracts began to contain highly restrictive confidentiality clauses. Secrecy became the order of the day for many of the company's trading contracts, as well as its disclosures\". 742 \"Enron Gas Services was developing a reputation as a predatory place where people would sell each other out to survive\". 743",

I did it to keep my job, to keep the value that I had in the company, to keep working for the company. I didn't have a good reason\". 744 Sherron Watkins-Enron vice president, subordinate of Andrew Fastow, former auditor at Arthur Andersen and ultimately famous in the USA as an internal whistle-blower-sent an anonymous memo to Lay about the possibility of a wave of accounting scandals after the unexpected resignation of Jeffrey Skilling as CEO in August 2001; later she sent a signed letter to Lay, and visited him personally. 745 Watkins began her letter with these selfish words: \"Has Enron become a risky place to work? For those of us who didn't get rich over the last few years, can we afford to stay?\". 746 She honesty outlined to Lay possible risks from accounting fraud, but the motivation for her whistleblowing attempts was not concern about investors (many of them were pension funds and education organizations; she mentioned them once in the letter), but apparently about the personal wealth of employees-their options and pension funds-and her career prospects: \"I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of scandals. My eight years of Enron work history will be worth nothing on my resume, the business world will consider the past successes as nothing but an elaborate accounting hoax\". 747 Nevertheless, she recommended to cover-up the problems (\"clean up quietly if possible\"). 748 Her letter was found only during the investigation, when the falsifications were revealed, but she had kept silent about Enron's frauds for years before the bankruptcy. Apparently, it was impossible for a conscientious person to survive unscathed in Enron's \"cut-throat\" environment for 8 long years\u2026 Enron and the Investment Banks Investment banks made serious money from underwriting merger deals, while broker fees brought insignificant profits in comparison. They got large investmentbanking fees from Enron transactions, they were investors in Enron's off-balancesheet special purpose entities and had credit exposure to Enron. 749 Therefore, investment bank analysts were urged to publish positive analytic reports about Enron, and sell-side bank traders promoted Enron's stock among their clientsthough with an average annual growth of over 65 %, Enron stocks did not require a lot of effort to promote. 750 If the occasional dissident-like John Olson, an analyst at Merrill Lynch-made a \"sell\" recommendation on Enron stocks or published \"neutral\" reports, he or she would be fired, since all the investment banks had a close relationship with Enron's executives. Later, in gratitude for the dismissal of John Olson, Merrill Lynch received at least US$45 million in fees from Enron deals. 751 Enron's impressive projections to become \"the world's leading company\" attracted investors from all around the world. The company declared: \"We believe wholesale gas and power in North America, Europe and Japan will grow from a US$660 billion market to a US$1.7 trillion market over the next several years. Retail energy services in the United States and Europe have the potential to grow from US$180 billion to $765 billion in the not-so-distant future.",

Employees of Enron and Arthur Andersen were afraid to reveal risks to the public because they feared they would not find support from regulators, who seemed to have a cozy relationship with Enron's management team. \u2022 The business model was geared to constantly raising the earnings of Enron executives by maintaining the permanent growth of the company's market value.

Therefore, Enron's executives corrupted their auditors and several investment banks with lucrative years-long contracts for reaching the required figures. \u2022 Wishful thinking of the board of directors, and among investors, employees and the media-they preferred to believe only in what they wanted to believe, and ignored facts and early warnings.

Scholes and Robert C. Merton among its principals, LTCM developed arbitrage positions betting on the convergence of what was deemed mispriced spread between bonds and between equity pairs and also traded options. In its first few years, LTCM achieved remarkable returns but had to escalate its leverage to enormous proportions, as its capital base grew and investment opportunities decreased. Thus, at the beginning of 1998, the firm had equity of US$4.72 billion and had borrowed over US$ 124.5 billion with assets of around US$129 billion, for a debt to equity ratio of over 25 to 1. 768 The debt of LTCM was developed with counterparties being most of the important banks on Wall Street. Starting with the 1997 East Asian financial crisis followed by the 1998 Russian government bond default, the convergence arbitrages that LTCM had bet upon actually diverged, leading to huge losses. As LTCM's capital was composed of funds from the same financial professionals with whom it traded, its difficulties led Wall Street to fear that LTCM liquidation of its securities to cover its debt would further push price down in a positive feedback loop, and could cause a chain reaction with catastrophic losses throughout the financial system. On September 1998, the Federal Reserve supervised a bail out of LTCM involving 14 financial institutions for a US$3.6 billion recapitalization allowing to avoid further liquidation in order to prevent the vicious cycle that was feared to possibly collapse the entire world financial system.",

            "text": "During the 2000s, an American real estate bubble was forming, 769 which burst during 2007-2008. More than eight million American households lost their homes due to foreclosure. More than US$17 trillion of household wealth was wiped out within 21 months after the burst. The American subprime mortgage crisis triggered a global financial and economic crisis in 2008-2009, 770 which caused the most severe recession in over 50 years. Total stock market losses exceeded US$30 trillion worldwide. 771 In order to prevent a total collapse of the world financial system, governments imperiled trillions of taxpayers' money on bailouts of private financial institutions, which were \"too big to fail\". This global salvage operation disrupted the stability of government finance not only in the USA, but also in many European countries. The US federal deficit (the amount by which federal spending exceeds federal income in a given fiscal year) grew from US$161 billion in 2007 to $1.4 trillion in 2009 772 ; and total public debt (the total amount owed by the federal government, including debts from intra-governmental holdings) increased by US$3.5 trillion, from $8.8 trillion in the middle of 2007 to $12.3 trillion at the end of 2009. 773 After the crisis, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) was created by the United States government to \"examine the causes of the current financial and economic crisis in the United States\". During hundreds of witness hearings under oath, numerous cases of risk information concealment were revealed, which had led to an inadequate perception of mortgage-related risks among US officials and financial industry executives. The commission stated: \"The crisis was the result of human action and inaction, not of Mother Nature\u2026 The captains of finance and the public stewards of our financial system ignored warnings and failed to question, understand, and manage evolving risks within a system essential to the well-being of the American public. Despite the expressed view of many on Wall Street and in Washington that the crisis could not have been foreseen or avoided, there were warning signs. The tragedy was that they were ignored or discounted\u2026 Little meaningful action was taken to quell the threats in a timely manner\". 774 Ultimately, the deregulation of the financial sector over decades, the highly fragmented state of US financial regulation and the desire of both government and financial institutions to ensure permanent growth of income and of the economy as a whole, in an illusionary belief in a perpetual money machine 775 -all of these together led to this crisis. There are strong arguments and compelling evidence that the financial meltdown was predictable and thus avoidable, and resulted from an exaggerated implementation of the free-market ideology and shareholder-value capitalism, with strong asymmetric information and misaligned incentives between shareholders and managers (the so-called agency problem), competition of the corporate-elites and, arguably, a shocking failure of leadership. 776 From a macro-economic view point, the crisis had its roots in non-sustainable global unbalances, in particular in the exploding China trade surplus with respect to the US, and the associated growing US debt bought by the Chinese, Japanese and Germans: \"If foreigners hold the debt, the interest rate stays stable. Mercantilist only works as long as they are willing to take the losses with the inflation that is coming along. Avoids social consequences of supernormal growth rates for them; subsidizes us by buying our debt. Good deal for us: they give us goods and we give them paper. Herb Stein would say: unsustainable trends have to end\". 777 Even the New York Fed admitted that, because of this trade, rates were held artificially low and drove the search for yield leading up to the crisis. 778 This sounds all too familiar regarding the five years of Quantitative Easing (QE) that have followed and created many short lived bubbles and other unsustainable unbalances! 779 The crisis has forced us to pay closer attention to the deregulated derivatives market, whose notional size amounts for more than US$600 trillion 780 -10 times more than the annual global world GDP. Nobody really knows what kind of threats derivatives could bring to the world financial system\u2026",

The creation of a single financial institution combining an investment bank, a commercial bank and an insurance company was prohibited. In 1934, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was established to regulate secondary trading of securities, by regulating stock exchanges and enforcing sanctions against criminal acts of fraud. 781 In the 1970s, American economists suggested that deregulation of the economy could increase competition within industries, reduce the price of goods and services through the interdependency of supply and demand, and enhance the economic growth of the United States. In 1971, during the Nixon presidency, the first step towards deregulation was made in the transportation industry with the deregulation of rail and truck transport. In 1978, during the Carter administration, the Airline Deregulation Act was passed.",

            "text": "In 1981, U.S. president Reagan promoted a new economic policy based on the reduction of government spending, federal income tax and capital gains tax, and on minimizing government intervention in the economy with the goal to stimulate jobs creation and productivity gains. To implement the \"Reaganomics\" strategy, Donald Regan-former chairman and CEO of the investment bank Merrill Lynch-was appointed to the position of Secretary of the Treasury, the American equivalent of finance minister. In 1982, the Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act was passed in order to help savings and loan associations compete with mutual funds, which were offering more lucrative interest rates during the high inflation of the 1970s-1980s. 782 and investments, allowing banks to provide variable-rate mortgage loans. Mutual funds, established by investment banks, were serious competitors of commercial banks: the assets of mutual funds surged from US$3 billion in 1977 to more than US$740 billion in 1995, and US$1.8 trillion by 2000. 784 These funds were not regulated: according to the testimony of Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, \"There was no regulation. It was kind of a free ride\". 785 These funds had complete freedom of investment activity and did not participate in the deposit insurance system. Clients' protection against losses was based only on the investment bank's reputation for protecting money market funds. 786 The rise of mutual funds urged the commercial banks to \"put a lot of pressure on [government] institutions to get higher-rate performing assets\". 787 The Tax Reform Act of 1986 also promoted the house bubble and mortgage refinancing frenzy: \"And there was yet one more advantage to being a consumer finance company, especially one that was making loans (second liens) secured by a house. Congress passed the Tax Reform Act of 1986 -signed into law by President Reaganwhich eliminated the ability of consumers to deduct interest payments on credit cards, auto loans, and all types of personal loans. Worried about a growing budget deficit, the politicians were hoping that by eliminating the tax deduction, this newfound money would feed the federal coffers. Consumers could no longer deduct the interest payments on their cars, credit cards, or personal loans, they might stop spending, which ultimately might hurt the consumer finance industry. Instead, it shifted borrowingto some degreeaway from personal loans to an asset class where Americans could still deduct the interest payments: the home\". 788 In 1986-1987, the Federal Reserve allowed American banks to make up to 5 % of gross revenues from investment banking business, and to underwrite commercial paper (unsecured promissory notes issued by banks or corporations), municipal bonds, and mortgage-backed securities. 789 In August 1986, Alan Greenspan, a leading apologist for deregulation and the free market, was appointed as chairman of the Federal Reserve; he was to remain chairman for the following 18 1 / 2 years until January 2006. In the same year, commercial banks obtained the right to get up to 10 % of their revenue from debt and equity securities; in 1996, this limit was raised to 25 %. 790 Banks also got permission to deal with derivatives: debt securities (allowed from 1983), interest and currency exchange rates (from 1988), stock indices (from 1988), precious metals such as gold and silver (from 1991), and equity stocks (from 1994). 791 During the 1980s and early 1990s, commercial banks began providing higher-risk loans with higher interest payments. They offered loans to oil and gas producers, financed leveraged buyouts of corporations, and funded residential and commercial real estate developers for international expansion. 792 As a result, during the savings and loan crisis in the late 1980s and early 1990s, 1034 savings and loan associations failed with US$160 billion losses. 793 By contrast, 584 banks had failed between 1934 and 1980 when there was a rigid legal framework. 794 Later, Greenspan described the arguments for deregulation: \"Those of us who support market capitalism in its more competitive forms might argue that unfettered markets create a degree of wealth that fosters a more civilized existence. I have always found that insight compelling\". 795 \"The market-stabilizing private regulatory forces should gradually displace many cumbersome, increasingly ineffective government structures\". 796 The decline of government involvement in the economy had an ideological and geopolitical basis, coinciding as it did with the collapse of the Soviet Union, a unique example of total government control over political, social and economic activities. In addition, the financial lobby sought theoretical credibility for further deregulation from the academic world, and began to engage prominent professors and researchers to study the possible advantages of deregulated markets. They offered millions of dollars in funding and grants, tens of thousands of dollars in speaking fees and generous salaries for involvement on the boards of financial institutions. 797 In fact, the academic founders of modern finance theory did not need to be induced into their theoretical positions. They deeply believed in the creative logic of their work. 798 Unsurprisingly, all these elements combined to ensure the dominance of a free-market theory, supported by apparently solid scientific studies, which argued for the necessity to decrease the role of government in the economy. This research helped financial lobbyists to find a legal justification for deregulation, and convince politicians to disassemble the legal framework that had been in place since the Great Depression: from 1999 to 2008, the financial sector spent US$2.7 billion on reported federal lobbying. In addition, the sector contributed more than US$1 billion to political campaigns during this period. 799 \"We Had a 21st-Century Financial System with 19th-Century Safeguards\"",

            "text": "In 1998, during the Clinton administration, Citibank announced a merger with Travelers Insurance Group-which owned Salomon Brothers investment bank-to establish the largest financial institution in the world, Citigroup Inc. It is remarkable that the deal was declared in violation of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, but the Federal Reserve made an exception for this merge. At the time of the deal, the Secretary of the Treasury was former Goldman Sachs executive Robert Rubin, who worked at Citigroup Inc. after the merger as a board member, chairman of the executive committee and chairman of the board of directors (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) ). Citigroup Inc. paid him up to US$126 million. 800 In 1999, after lobbying from the financial sector, Congress passed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which lifted all restrictions against the combination of banking, securities and insurance operations within a single financial institution. This paved the way for further mergers. 801 Ultimately, by 2005, the ten largest US commercial banks held 55 % of the industry's assets-twice the proportion held by the top ten in 1990. 802 Lawrence Summers, Rubin's successor as Secretary of the Treasury and a former academic economist and Harvard professor, said on the passing of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act: \"Today, Congress voted to update the rules that have governed financial services since the Great Depression and replace them with a system for the 21st century. This historic legislation will better enable American companies to compete in the new economy\". 803 After the crisis, the FCIC commission stated that, in fact, \"we had a 21st-century financial system with 19th-century safeguards\". 804 Deregulation led to a situation where the banking, securities and insurance operations of the new merged financial institutions were still overseen by separate regulators: there was no single government regulator looking at all of their commercial activities. So neither government nor the executives of financial institutions had the whole picture of the risks involved in a complex combination of businesses with different interests-especially in the widening distribution of derivatives. For instance, the CEO of Citigroup told the FCIC commission that US$40 billion invested in highly rated mortgage securities would \"not in any way have excited my attention\", and the co-head of Citigroup's investment bank said he spent \"a small fraction of 1 % of his time on those securities\". The commission declared that \"too big to fail meant too big to manage. We conclude a combination of excessive borrowing, risky investments, and lack of transparency put the financial system on a collision course with crisis\". 805 The complexity of understanding the principles of the creation and calculation of derivatives, together with continued lobbying from financial institutions, resulted in the absence of serious government regulation over innovative financial instruments. We should also stress the prevalence of finance theories that rationalized and legitimized both public deregulation and extraordinary private riskseeking behavior, while generating such complexity in the financial engineering and the underlying cash flows beneath the financial structures that literally no one could have penetrated in the cases of Enron and of the global financial crisis.",

            "text": "When the Commodity Futures Trading Commission expressed their intention to discuss the possible regulation of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, their attempts to do so were suspended by Alan Greenspan, Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers. 806 Greenspan testified that there was no need for government oversight, because \"regulation of derivatives transactions that are privately negotiated by professionals is unnecessary\". 807 In the 20 years from early 1990 to 2009, the unregulated global derivatives market-of which 90 % consisted of OTC derivatives-grew from US$10 trillion to US$605 trillion 808 ; the world GDP in 2010 was approximately US$65 trillion. 809 812 In 2005, more than 10 % of house sales were made for financial reasons by investors, speculators, or people buying second homes. Houses became a commodity-an asset-and could be mortgaged to get cash for putting children through college, medical bills, or sabbaticals to launch new businesses. As a result, home refinancing rose from US$460 billion in 2000 to US$2.8 trillion in 2003, despite stagnant wages. 813 Before the deregulation of the early 1980s, lenders selected borrowers carefully, because they needed, for their own sake, to ensure that a borrower could pay a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. The stability of financial institutions depended on the reliability of their debtors. Even in the 1990s, only the highest quality clients who could comply with tough requirements-known as \"prime\" borrowers-were eligible. For example, one requirement was that first-time home buyers should be able to make a 20 % down payment. However, deregulation and active encouragement from the government allowed lenders to lower the acceptable standard for borrowers, and provide credit for people with no credit history or proof of income-and the \"subprime\" market was born. It was made possible by the creation of a securitization pipeline: lenders packaged loans into residential mortgagebacked securities, and these securities were repackaged again into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) by investment banks like Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns or Lehman Brothers. In their turn, CDOs were promoted among more conservative American investors (retirement systems, hospitals, endowment funds and the like) and global investors (pension funds and sovereign funds) as a \"super-senior\" and \"s`securities from a range of different quality debtors 814, 815 Economist James Grant described the \"mysterious alchemical processes [by which] Wall Street transforms BBB-minus-rated mortgages into AAA-rated tranches of mortgage securities\". 816 Companies like American International Group (AIG)-the largest insurance company in the world-insured the banks against potential default by credit default swaps (CDSs). By 2007, AIG had issued CDSs on $379 billion of underlying value. 817 A strong positive feedback mechanism developed between the home price dynamics and the loan origination process: \"Why would the defendants overvalue the homes? Answer: because the higher the house value, the larger the loan Ameriquest [ 820 The CDOs' AAA rating was assigned by such respected rating agencies as Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch. Investment banks \"paid handsome fees to the rating agencies to obtain the desired ratings\" 821 -between US$0.5 million to 0.85 million for every mortgage-related security. In the 1990s, the quality of the obligations was not in doubt but, with the subsequent growth of lending, it became harder to carefully track the quality of borrowers. The rating agencies knew exactly what they were doing. One S&P employee wrote: \"Rating agencies continue to create an even bigger monsterthe C. D 824 Following the onset of the financial crisis in 2008, banks and other financial firms have collectively paid more than $40 billion as punishment for crisis-era misdeeds to the US government as off January 2015. But rating agencies have been also in the firing line and the US Justice Department has launched a lawsuit against S&P, a unit of McGraw Hill Financial, accusing S&P of giving top ratings to poor quality mortgage-backed securities between 2004 and 2007 and of knowingly misleading investors with inflated ratings of residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). According to the lawsuit, S&P gave the deceptive ratings so it could collect fees from the financial firms that sold the securities. The Justice Department and more than a dozen state attorneys general argue that \"S&P's relationships with the banks that designed the mortgage deals 'improperly influenced' the ratings criteria. It also accused S&P of falsely claiming that its ratings 'were objective, independent, uninfluenced by any conflicts of interest'\". 825 For fears of the negative impact towards shareholders, reputation damage and to avoid the embarrassment of paying the same or even more after a trial, ratings company Standard & Poor's has struck a $1.37 billion settlement with the U.S. Justice Department over mortgage ratings that S&P issued leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, a penalty large enough to wipe out the rating agency's entire operating profit for a year 826,827 According to the CNN announcement of February 3, 2015, 828 the settlement also resolves lawsuits with attorneys general in 19 states and the District of Columbia and S&P will pay separately $125 million to California's public pension fund to resolve claims that it was misled in three separate transactions. In January 2015, S&P already paid $58 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission and $19 million to settle similar charges with the attorneys general in New York and Massachusetts. Again, according to the CNN announcement of February 3, 829 \"S&P said the latest settlement 'contains no findings of violations of law by the company'. However, federal 824 prosecutors said the company has acknowledged the 'improper conduct that led to this settlement'\".",

            "text": "Once a mortgage securities package was sold, the lender had no need to monitor the financial situation of debtors, because all payments from borrowers were transmitted to the owners of mortgage securities. The minimum down payment was soon reduced to 3 % and, after Bush's \"Zero Down Payment Initiative\", it dropped to just US$500. These lucrative terms attracted millions of subprime (near-prime, non-prime, and second-chance lending) borrowers, who had to pay a higher rate than prime borrowers: in California, the average subprime borrower was paying US$600 per month more than a prime borrower on their mortgage payments because they had received a subprime loan. 830 The share of subprime mortgages in the US mortgage market increased from 7.4 % in 2002 to 23.5 % in 2007. 831 Subprime mortgages meant greater profitability for financial institutions. Investment banks wanted constant growth in the number of new CDOs (collateralized debt obligations), and encouraged lenders to issue new credit for everyone. In a permanently growing real estate market, such a model worked well: borrowers warmed up the property market by taking the new more accessible credit, and lenders did not have to worry about the creditability of borrowers because they were transferring risks through CDOs and other mortgage securities to investors, who in turn insured risks through CDSs. As this was developing in full force, Greenspan declared that the financial system had achieved unprecedented resilience. 832 AAA ratings for mortgage securities maintained the illusion of a high quality of assets, which seemed to be among the safest in the world. One FCIC commission witness compared this financial creativity with \"cheap sangria, when a lot of cheap ingredients [are] repackaged to sell at a premium. It might taste good for a while, but then you get headaches later and you have no idea what's really inside\". 833 One of the inventors of securitization testified that \"If you look at how many people are playing, from the real estate agent all the way through to the guy who is issuing the security and the underwriter and the underwriting group and blah, blah, blah, then nobody in this entire chain is responsible to anybody\". 834 As the commission put it, \"They all believed they could off-load their risks on a moment's notice to the next person in line. They were wrong. When 830 The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report, The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, Washington, D.C., January 2011, p. 11. 831 Ibid p. 70. 832 Ibid, p. 83. 833 Ibid, p. 6. 834 Ibid, p. 89 . 835 For the financial sector, the real estate boom became a major source of profit, as a result of the higher interest rates paid by borrowers and the chain of bond placements by Wall Street: \"A consumer (usually subprime) buying a home or refinancing and trying to keep closing costs low would agree to pay a higher interest rate on the mortgage in return for paying no points (or fewer points) at the closing table. The higher yield on the loan made that mortgage more valuable to the wholesaler (Countrywide, Wells Fargo, Washington Mutual), because the wholesaler could sell it to Wall Street at a better price than a loweryielding loan would garner. In the world of Wall Street, the higher the interest rate on a loan, the more valuable it became. Why? Answer: because the loan would be pooled into a bond, and bond investors loved higheryielding assets. A higher yield of even just 1 percent more on a billiondollar bond would translate into millions extra in income for the bondholder\". 836 From 1978 to 2008, the amount of debt held by the financial sector increased from US$3 trillion to US$36 trillion; more than 33 % of all corporate income in the United States was generated by financial institutions in 2003, while in 1980 the proportion had been 15 %. 837 Before the 1980s, the majority of investment banks were private companies; a loyal employee would receive a bonus on retirement after a successful career lasting decades. After the 1980s, when investment banks became public companies and staff began to trade with shareholders' money, the compensation model completely changed: tremendously high annual bonuses urged executives and managers to focus on short-term financial results, increasing current capitalization and short-term profitability while ignoring the possible consequences of risky practice in the long-term. In 2007, Wall Street paid roughly US$33 billion in year-end bonuses to New York workers. 838 None of the executives wanted to overturn the defective mortgage market by revealing the shortcomings of the business model they had created. After the crisis Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, testified that \"I blame the management teams 100 % and \u2026 no one else\". 839 Federal, state and local government also benefited from the real estate boom through permanent economic growth, massive foreign investment in the US stock market, declining unemployment, rising revenues from individual and property taxes, etc. Any problem in the property market could lead to a cascade effect in many American industries, bankrupting millions of Americans, destroying profitability of the financial sector and bringing severe political consequences. So, decision makers in both the financial sector and US government were reluctant to ask questions or embark on a detailed investigation of common business practice within the securitization pipeline. This unwillingness encouraged the institutions involved in the pipeline to conceal information about the real situation within their businesses.",

A study by two Federal Reserve economists confirmed that at least 38 % of borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) did not understand the calculation of their interest rates. 841 In 2006, during the Federal Reserve's Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act hearings, consumers testified that ARM loans were sold to people speaking \"primarily non-English languages [migrants from Latin American and Asia], only to be pressured to sign English-only documents with significantly worse terms\". 842 The FCIC commission found out that lenders had made loans knowing that borrowers could not afford them, and that the percentage of borrowers who defaulted on their mortgages within the first few months had grown steadily. Lenders had been \"forcing them to pay into-pay loans that they could never pay off. Prevalent among these clients are seniors, people of color, people with disabilities, and limited English speakers and seniors who are African American and Latino\". 843 In 2003, Washington Mutual ordered an internal study \"to explore what Washington Mutual could do to increase sales of Option ARMs, our most profitable mortgage loan\". 844 It revealed that Washington Mutual brokers \"felt these loans were 'bad' for customers \u2026 a lot of (loan) consultants don't believe in it \u2026 and don't think [it's] good for the customer\". 845 Nevertheless, the company motivated brokers to focus precisely on selling ARMs: after 2004, more than 50 % of all Washington Mutual mortgages were adjustable-rate, and the volume of ARMs sold by Washington Mutual rose from US$30 billion to US$68 billion in 2004. Unfortunately, other lenders came to the same conclusion-and nationwide ARM sales rose from US$65 billion in 2003 to US$255 billion in 2006. During the subsequent crash, it was ARMs that generated the majority of defaults by borrowers as well as the greatest losses for mortgage securities holders.",

If the borrowers were to default on their loans, the investors could force Citi to buy them back. He tried to alert top managers at the firm by 'email, weekly reports, committee presentations, and discussions'; but though they expressed concern, it 'never translated into any action'. He finally took his warnings to the highest level he could reach -Robert Rubin, the chairman of the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors and a former US treasury secretary. He sent Rubin and the others a memo with the words 'URGENT-READ IMMEDIATELY' in the subject line. Sharing his concerns, he stressed to top managers that Citi faced billions of dollars in losses if investors were to demand that Citi repurchase the defective loans. Rubin told the Commission in a public hearing in April 2010 that 'I do recollect this and that either I or somebody else, and I truly do not remember who, but either I or somebody else sent it to the appropriate people, and I do know factually that that was acted on promptly and actions were taken in response to it'. According to Citigroup, the bank undertook an investigation and the system of underwriting reviews was revised\u2026 There was no disclosure made to the investors with regard to the quality of the files they were purchasing\u2026 Bowen told the Commission that after he alerted management by sending emails, he went from penalty ever paid by a Wall Street firm until that time -for withholding risk information. After the trial, one finance expert declared that this case was \"the most cynical use of credit information that I have ever seen\u2026 [It is like] buying fire insurance on someone else's house and then committing arson\". 862 In 2013, JP Morgan Chase was fined US$13 billion by the US government for overstating the quality of the mortgages the bank had been selling to investors before the subprime mortgage crisis. 863 The FCIC commission declared: \"The mortgage pipeline also introduced leverage at every step. High leverage, inadequate capital, and short-term funding made many financial institutions extraordinarily vulnerable to the downturn in the market in 2007\". 866 Over-the-counter derivatives enabled derivatives traders at five major investment banks (Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, and Morgan Stanley) to operate with leverage ratios on their capital as high as 40 to 1. In other words, for every US$40 in assets, there was only US$1 in capital to cover losses; less than a 3 % drop in asset values could bankrupt any major investment bank. 867 Brokers at investment banks traded for and against the housing boom through credit default swaps. They often used clients' assets to raise cash for their own activities without informing clients. Warren Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., testified that derivatives were \"very dangerous stuff\", difficult to understand for market participants, regulators, auditors and investors. He added that he didn't think he could manage a complex derivatives book. 868 However, it was revealed in November 5, 2011, that Buffett had sold equity derivatives (put options) to undisclosed buyers for $4.9 billion.",

Bloomberg communicated that Buffett's foray in equity derivatives had put pressure on Berkshire, with profits dropping 24 %. 869 The leverage level was often hidden in derivatives positions, in off-balancesheet entities or REPO transactions to prevent rumors about the real financial situation of investment banks on the market. 870 Serious doubts about the financial state of any firm could restrict access to the interbank lending market and bankrupt the firm. So it was not only external observers, but also investment bank executives, who failed to understand the real influence of OTC derivatives on their business. Even senior managers at the financial institutions lacked a sense of \"the whole picture\" of the risks of derivatives; and yet they continued to reassure investors, competitors, partners and the authorities of the financial stability of their organizations. For instance in April 2008 -just after the failure of Bear Stearns -Richard Fuld, CEO of Lehman Brothers, assured shareholders at a meeting that \"the worst \u2026 [is] \u2026 behind us\". 871 Some sources asserted that Fuld's personal experience was mainly as a bond trader, and that he had little technical understanding of such new financial instruments as CDOs and CDSs. Moreover, the majority of Lehman's board of directors had no specialized financial expertise: nine of them were retired, four of them over 75 years old, one was a theater producer, another a former Navy admiral\u2026 in fact only two had direct experience in the financial services industry. 872 Even after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothersfor which he voted-Fuld insisted that \"There was no capital hole at Lehman Brothers. At the end of Lehman's third quarter [of 2008], we had US$28.4 billion of equity capital\". 873 There was a similar situation in AIG: executives at the insurance firm told the FCIC commission that \"they did not even know about these terms of the [credit default] swaps until the collateral calls started rolling\" in July 2007. 874 Not even the office of Thrift Supervision, the regulators who supervised AIG on a consolidated basis, knew the true level of risk the company was underwriting. 875 By the fall of 2007, AIG management certainly knew where things were heading-and despite this, they too continued to convince investors that \"the risk we have taken in the U.S. residential housing sector is supported by sound analysis and a risk management structure \u2026 we believe the probability that it will sustain an economic loss is close to zero \u2026 We are confident in our marks and the reasonableness of our valuation methods \u2026 [AIG has] active and strong risk management\". 876 In September 2008, the US government took over AIG in a US$85 billion bailout, because of AIG's liquidity shortage on credit default swap positions.",

John Snow, US Secretary of the Treasury from 2003 to 2006, testified that regulators tended not to see a problem at their own institutions: \"Nobody had a full 360-degree view. The basic reaction from financial regulators was, 'Well, there may be a problem. But it's not in my field of view'\". 877 One member of the FCIC commission observed that \"it appears that market participants were unprepared for the destructiveness of this bubble's collapse because of a chronic lack of information about the composition of the mortgage market. Information about the composition of the mortgage market was simply not known when the bubble began to deflate\". 878 After the crash, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke admitted that he had missed the systemic risks: \"Prospective subprime losses were clearly not large enough on their own to account for the magnitude of the crisis\". 879 In 2006, property prices peaked and Bear Stearns investment bank was found problematic during the following year, but regulators stated that it was a \"relatively unique\" case. They continued to convince the financial community that there was \"comfort about the capital cushions\" at the big investment banks until the collapse of Bear Stearns in March 2008. 880 Henry Paulson, US Secretary of the Treasury during the crisis, had been CEO of Goldman Sachs-one of the key players of the securitization pipeline-from 1999 until 2006. He warned in October 2007 that the burst of the housing bubble was \"the most significant risk to our economy\". 881 Despite his warning, and the occurrence of US$100 billion mortgage-related losses in 2007, the government did not act decisively to assess the real situation of the financial institutions, or to mitigate the consequences of a possible crisis, until the autumn of 2008. Because nobody could really see the whole picture, few could guess the real magnitude of the approaching calamity-even in the last few months before the government takeover of \"Fannie Mae\" (the Federal National 876 When the crisis occurred, a great number of Americans asked each other: \"Why are there no jail sentences for Wall Street CEOs?\" There was plenty of evidence of fraud, conspiracy and lies, but no criminal prosecutions of the executives of investment banks and auditors as there had been when the cases of Enron, WorldCom or Madoff's 'Ponzi' scheme came to light. The answer is likely to be quite simple: this crisis was in significant part created as an unintended consequence of a close cooperation between the US government and private financial institutions-which were giving billions of dollars in contributions to the campaign coffers of both the Republican and Democratic parties. Nobody wanted to dig into the dirty laundry. The situation could be summarized by the following aphorism, which summarizes the generic problem underlying sound risk management: \"No one sees any pressing need to ask hard questions about the sources of profits when things are doing well\".",

The first months of the war on the Eastern Front-a major part of the Second World War-turned out to be a military catastrophe for the Red Army: more than 850,000 soldiers died, more than 1 million soldiers were captured, and nearly 3500 military airplanes and 6000 tanks were lost. The Wehrmacht seized territory that normally produced up to 40 % of Soviet GDP. 883 In doing so, they lost 100,000 soldiers, 950 airplanes and 1700 tanks.",

As the heroes of the Russian Civil War, they became the most prominent and popular people in the Soviet Union. To reduce their political influence and mitigate the possibility of possible military coups, Stalin appointed Kliment Voroshilov, his most loyal supporter, as People's Commissar for Defense (defense minister) of the Soviet Union in 1925, a position he retained until 1940. Like Stalin, Voroshilov did not have a military background and had little knowledge of modern military strategy, but he was able to control the ambitious, welleducated and self-determined generals.",

Against the Red Army's military operation, Finnish generals-the majority of whom were former officers of the Russian Empire, just like the Soviet senior officers executed in 1937-1938-mounted a sophisticated defense strategy, adapting well to the terrain and carefully coordinating units of well-trained soldiers. As a result, the Red Army formally defeated Finland, but in reality failed to achieve its ambitious goal, and the two countries signed a peace treaty. During and after that war, Red Army commanders at all levels began to embellish the real situation in their reports to superiors, because of the fear of further repression from Stalin after such a poor performance from what was-despite its tremendous wealth of military equipment-an under-trained army with young and inexperienced commanders.",

Red Army officers tried to underplay their own losses, and exaggerate those of the enemy, in their reports to Stalin and the General Headquarters of the Red Army. Thus-according to the report received by the Politburo and the Supreme Council of the USSR-48,475 Soviet soldiers were killed and 158,863 were injured during the Finnish campaign, but the Finnish Defense Forces lost more than 70,000 soldiers and 250,000 were injured. Decades later, historians found out that the Red Army had actually lost 95,200 soldiers, and the Finnish Defense Forces had lost 23,500. 894 In other words, Red Army officers halved their own losses and exaggerated the losses of the enemy by a factor of three. 892 After the war, the Finns declared that the main defect of the Red Army was the weakness of its command. At debriefs, this statement was eventually admitted by the Red Army generals. They accepted that the troops did not suffer from a lack of equipment, but from an abundance of equipment and the inability of commanders of the infantry, tank divisions, the air force and the navy to interact effectively with each other: \"The war\u2026 showed that the weakest link in the chain was the level of training of commanders, who could not make the full use of\u2026 the personnel subordinated to them\". 895 Nevertheless, nobody had the courage to inform Stalin and the politicians, and to state openly that the main cause of the low level of training of Red Army commanders was the previous purges of senior and middle military management. Everybody was afraid of further repression. As a result, Stalin began to receive the information he wanted to hear and not an honest appraisal of the condition of the Red Army. In 1937, Hitler had also eliminated opposition among generals of the Wehrmacht, who objected to his plans for further conquests. However, only 60 generals were replaced and these were retired. Hitler also surrounded himself with generals who did not criticize his maniacal desire to expand the Third Reich.",

In turn, the military command tried to reassure Stalin that the Red Army had already overcome the shortcomings identified during the Finnish war and that it was ready for any war. In May 1941, inspired by the apparent progress, Stalin declared that fundamental restructuring of the army was over, that they now had 300 divisions with 10,000-13,000 soldiers in each, and that one third of the divisions were mechanized.",

We received a very interesting assessment from Russian historian Sergey Nefedov, Senior Fellow in History at the Ural Federal University, about alternative views on the history of the Nazi German invasion of the Soviet Union-in particular addressing the question \"What if Stalin had ordered the Red Army to prepare for defense months before the actual time of the invasion?\" The following is Nefedov's conclusion: even if Stalin had not conducted repressions and the high- of the USSR and ordered preparations for defense in the spring of 1941; even then the USSR would have suffered huge losses, and German troops would have been deep into Soviet territory in the late autumn of 1941.",

They could not imagine that the Germans had developed far superior military strategy and tactics with their active use of \"Blitzkrieg\": fast mixed attacks by hundreds of tanks, attack planes and motorized infantry, deep into enemy territory through the weakest points in its defense lines. Such blitzkrieg attacks could not be stopped by defensive lines like the famous Maginot Line: in 1940 the Germans bypassed it through Dutch and Belgian territory, advancing suddenly with 1250 armored vehicles and outflanking the French troops to attack them from the rear. This operation was the main cause of their remarkable swift defeat of France in WWII. On the Eastern front too, the Wehrmacht found weaknesses in the thousand-kilometer defensive line of the Red Army; General Guderian's tank divisions slipped into the rear of the Red Army through these weak points, surrounding Red Army divisions and destroying them. Thus they advanced, gradually but inexorably, towards Moscow\u2026",

            "text": "What stopped the Wehrmacht from continuing its unique military strategy into the late autumn of 1941, and caused its eventual defeat in the battle for Moscow, was the notorious Russian winter-nicknamed \"General Frost\"-which had also helped the Red Army's ancestors to destroy the \"unbeatable\" army of Napoleon in 1812. Even during November 1941, the temperature near Moscow was around \u221210 \u00b0C (\u221214 \u00b0F), well below freezing-but on December 4, the temperature dropped to \u221235 \u00b0C (\u221231 \u00b0F). The German tanks and motorized troops were completely frozen: with no adequate winter clothing or equipment, the Wehrmacht soldiers lost any motivation for further military breakthroughs in their desperate search for sources of heat. On 6 December, fresh Red Army units arrived, transferred from Siberia, and began a successful counterattack on Wehrmacht troops near Moscow. This turned the tide, and laid the foundation for their ultimate victory over Nazism three and half years later. In these later years, the German forces used blitzkrieg attacks less frequently, because the Red Army had learned how to anticipate such attacks and prevent them from developing. Dr. Nefedov published an article about his findings in a Russian history periodical. 911 Thus, according to Dr. Nefedov's assessment, Stalin and the Soviet Union had only one chance to avoid the tragic defeat that befell them in the first months of 1941, and save the lives of millions of its citizens: by a preventive attack on the Nazis in Poland. But in this case, the Soviet Union would have been recognized as the aggressor, violating the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact. Consequently, Great Britain and the United States would have been obliged to help Germany in a war against the Communist Russia. Harry S.

The H1N1 influenza virus originally came from birds, but then appeared in pigs before crossing the species barrier again to ignite the pandemic among humans. 916 Moreover, other governments involved in the war made similar decisions-censorship, lies, and even active propaganda-to keep up morale, allowing the disease to continue to spread without any preventive measures. The pandemic was named \"Spanish flu\" because Spain was a neutral country during the First World War and did not suppress the media, so it was only Spanish newspapers that published honest articles about the severity of the disease-despite the fact that it had originated in the USA and spread initially among American soldiers in the absence of a proper response by the US government. This lack of response was probably due to the US strategic goal of developing a strong political influence in the post-WWI peace process that was to shape international politics in the following decades.",

            "text": "In the middle of November 2002, the first case of SARS was registered in Foshan hospital, in Guangdong province, South East China, 130 km from Hong Kong. Staff of the hospital informed a local anti-epidemic station about a \"strange disease\" by mid-December. Representatives of Chinese Ministry of Health landed in Guangdong province for a detailed investigation in mid-January 2003. On January 27, they issued a \"top secret\" report, which was distributed to executives of the provincial health bureau and to the Ministry of Health in Beijing. By the beginning of February, hospitals across Guangdong province were alerted, but the majority of staff did not receive any warnings because of the Chinese New Year holiday, which began on February 1 and continued for 15 days. No public warnings were issued. 922 The unauthorized transmission of health-related information is prohibited in China until there has been an announcement by \"the Ministry of Health or organs authorized by the Ministry\", in order to \"avoid confusion and panic\". Before such official acknowledgement, all data about infectious diseases is classified as a state secret: any doctor or journalist who reveals information about the development of a disease will be prosecuted for leaking state secrets. 923 So, the provincial authorities were not allowed to discuss the SARS problem openly until the national authorities had authorized it. 924 In the absence of any government statement, the growing number of apparently infected people led to rumors that were widely spreading among the Chinese concerning a \"deadly flu\". The rumors were carried by word-of-mouth, texting and conversing on social networks. 925 By mid-February, nearly 50 % of people interviewed in Guangzhou City confirmed that they had heard about the disease from friends, relatives or the overseas media. The Great Chinese Firewall-a countrywide surveillance system-began to block the sending of SMS and Skype messages about SARS. 926 Later, 93 people were arrested for spreading rumors. 927 On February 10, 2003, Guangdong health officials reported atypical pneumonia cases in the province-emphasizing that the disease was controllable and treatable. The government played down the risk of the illness. 928 The WHO was first officially informed of the outbreak on February 11, 2003, when the Chinese Ministry of Health reported 305 cases of an unknown disease with five deaths in Guangdong Province. Transmission of the disease was largely confined to health care workers-105 doctors, nurses, and other medical workers were infected-and the friends or families of patients. 929 The Chinese health authorities did not impose strict anti-epidemic measures (respiratory precautions to protect medical staff, taking people's temperature on entry to the hospital, and so on). In spite of clear evidence that hospital staff were the main source of transmission of the virus, Liu Jianlun, a Chinese doctor who had treated cases in Guangdong and had symptoms of SARS already from February 15, was allowed to travel to Hong Kong to attend a wedding ceremony. On February 21, he stayed in the Metropole Hotel and infected several people, who transmitted the virus to Canada, Vietnam, Singapore over the following few days, initiating a global SARS outbreak. By the end of February, 806 people were ill in China and 34 had died. 930 On March 12, 2003, the WHO issued a global health alert about the mysterious pneumonia and recommended that people avoid traveling to Hong Kong and Vietnam. After the WHO warning, Hong Kong airport lost 18 percent of flights. 931 From February 11 to April 25, the Hang Seng Index-the market index in Hong Kong-lost 8.55 %, while the Dow Jones and NASDAQ Composite rose by 7-10 %. 932 Meanwhile, on March 1, SARS had been recorded in Beijing. Nevertheless, the Beijing municipal authorities hid this fact from the national authorities because they wanted to convince superiors that Beijing was implementing all necessary anti-epidemic measures, and there was no reason for canceling the upcoming National People's Congress meeting, which was planned for March 5-18 and to which up to 3000 representatives from every province of China were invited. Beijing's municipal government also convinced superiors that it had all the resources to deal with the situation, and refused any assistance from the central government. Many other local and municipal authorities demonstrated the same behavior: \"officials at all levels tended to distort the information they passed up to their political masters in order to place themselves in a good light\". 933 Moreover, military hospitals, which were not obliged to reveal information about their activity to the civilian authorities, also tried to deny the existence of infected soldiers. As a result, the national authorities received encouraging statistics on SARS development and were convinced there was no need for urgent nationwide preventive measures. During March, they reassured themselves that the SARS outbreak was limited to Guangdong Province and Hong Kong. It was only on March 25 that the central government confirmed the spread of SARS outside of Guangdong Province. Moreover, when the Chinese authorities invited WHO experts to China, they would only allow them access to Guangdong Province until April 2. The decision to allow them wider access was only made under tremendous international pressure on China, when it became obvious that the Chinese authorities were covering up what was actually a national SARS outbreak. On April 5, Chinese Vice Premier Wu Yi announced \"the immediate establishment of a national medical emergency mechanism, with emphasis placed on public health information and an early warning reporting mechanism\". 934 On April 6, China apologized for its slow reporting on the outbreak 935 and the Chinese Health Ministry reported 19 cases and four deaths in Beijing. 936 However, Dr. Jiang Yanyong, retired chief of surgery for a Beijing military hospital, had previously stated on TV channels that he was aware of a hundred cases and six deaths in his hospital-more than five times the number of cases announced by the authorities. 937 So on April 9, WHO experts gained permission to inspect military hospitals in Beijing as well. After clear evidence that the real size of the outbreak was being hushed up, Chinese Communist Party executives launched their own investigation into the matter. On April 20, Health Minister Zhang Wenkang and Beijing mayor Meng Xuenong were fired for their mismanagement of the crisis. 938 During May, more than 120 health execu-tives were sacked and nearly 1000 government officials were reprimanded for their \"slack\" response to the outbreak. 939 On April 16, an international network of 11 leading laboratories under the leadership of the WHO discovered the etiological agent of SARS and suggested potential treatments. The cause of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome was determined as a coronavirus (subsequently named the SARS coronavirus, or SARSCoV) originating from bats. Virologists breathed a sigh of relief, as coronaviruses are less dangerous than flu viruses. Had SARS been a kind of influenza, the consequences for the world population could have likely been devastating. 940 In such a scenario, the mismanagement and risk concealment demonstrated by the Chinese health system at the early stages of the epidemic could have cost millions of lives throughout the world-as it did in the case of the \"Spanish flu\" pandemic because of the inadequate response of the US government.

This disaster confirms again that the distortion of information occurring on one level of the managerial hierarchy of an organization or a country leads to a situation where senior management receive information about risks too late to allow them to deploy serious force in time to respond adequately to foreseeable risks, resulting in a much larger-scale disaster.",

            "text": "Russia accounts for around 20 % of all the forested area on the planet. In the Soviet Union, a centralized system of forest protection allowed firefighting forces from one region to be redeployed to another. The last giant wildfire disaster occurred in the European part of Russia in 1972, when tens of thousands of Red Army soldiers with military engineering equipment helped federal forest firefighters to extinguish the fires. However, by the 2000s, this event had been forgotten, and the Federal Forest Service had been eliminated as part of a wider deregulation movement and to reduce public expenditure. In 2007, a new Forest Code was passed that provided no federal forest protection whatsoever. State control was transferred to regional authorities who were expected to work with private logging operators to manage forest fires and fight wildfires. However, the regional authorities did not have the budget to do what was required: for example, Mordovia, a region the size of the state of Massachusetts and with 800,000 residents, had just 50 forest firefighters and 2 specialized fire trucks. In their turn, private logging operators were only concerned with the short-term profitability of business and were reluctant to invest in fire protection activity. The overall financing of Russian forest management dropped to US$0.55 per hectare per year, although nearby Kazakhstan spent US$1.05, the USA $4 and Belarus-with forests contaminated by radionuclides from Chernobyl-$7.45. 945 In addition, the new provisions of the Forest Code did not regulate clearly the separate jurisdiction of federal, regional and local authorities during interregional wildfires, and the responsibility of the different authorities during fires moving from forests to settlements and conversely. Ultimately, after these legal changes, the area of forest destroyed by fire doubled. The public did not see the consequences of the absence of federal control over forests, until an unprecedented natural phenomenon occurred, perhaps associated with the phenomenon of global change due to anthropogenic causes: a twomonth long anticyclone hovered over the European part of Russia and caused heat waves with temperatures up to +40 \u00b0C, hot wind storms with speeds of up to 30 m/s and a total absence of rainfall.",

            "text": "The heat and drought of summer 2010 were predicted by NASA analysts in December 2009 and confirmed by Russian scientists. On March 23, 2010, the Russian meteorological service Roshydromet issued a weather forecast for the coming summer season. It predicted an increased wildfire hazard in the European part of the Russian and Ural regions. Despite this warning, large-scale preventive actions were carried out neither by federal authorities (because there was no legal framework for intervention) nor by regional and local authorities, (because of the lack of money and resources). Moreover, none of the officials could imagine the possible consequences of two months of extreme heat and the resulting wildfires, because since 1972 there had been no similar disaster. In June 2010, when the wildfires started, regional agencies began to pass the responsibility for fire prevention and fighting to each other because it was not defined clearly enough in the existing legislative base. As a result, they just spent precious time playing bureaucratic games and lost the initiative in preventive action. In addition, the failure to manage forest firefighting was aggravated by the Russian political system. In December 2004, Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, had changed the rules for appointing regional leaders: instead of being elected by popular vote, all heads of Russian regions were appointed by the President. This led to a situation where their performance was evaluated in Moscow, rather than in their regions by the citizens they were supposed to be serving. Eager to make a favorable impression on Putin and ensure their continuation in power, regional leaders preferred to send only reassuring reports to the central government. They always tried to convince the federal authorities that they could handle any situation but, in reality, they did not have the power or the resources to deal with a crisis of this scale. Some of governors were continuing to send soothing reports to Moscow and reassure the residents of their regions that \"everything is under control\". Some, having delegated authority to their deputies, flew out from the regions for 2-3 weeks on planned vacations: such distasteful cases occurred in the Moscow, Vladimir and Voronezh regions. Without proper management, the situation was thus getting worse.",

From this point, the swift extinction of the fires was seen as a test of the ability of Vladimir Putin and the federal government to manage emergency situations.

Moreover, 12 h after the disaster, Vasily Krut'ko, the head of Krymsk district, reported directly to Vladimir Putin-who had immediately come to the affected district from the nearby presidential residence with a group of journalists-that local officials had declared a state of emergency in good time and taken action to inform the population 5 h before the peak of the flash floods. He claimed that the crisis information campaign had included personal visits to private houses in potential flooding areas, continuous coverage on local television and emergency SMS messages. However, investigations that following revealed that Krut'ko had lied about the decision by local officials to declare a state of emergency-it was actually issued 2 h after the gigantic flash flood occurred-and that the majority of the above actions were never implemented in reality. As a result, only 52 out of the 60,000 residents of Krymsk confirmed that they received warnings about the coming flood. 948 The majority of the dead were elderly people who drowned while sleeping, or when it was too late to escape from their houses. Krut'ko was arrested after the investigation, on charges of negligence resulting in the death of two or more people. On March 2013, during the trial, he partially admitted his guilt.

            "text": "From the 1970s onwards, private houses began to be constructed without the permission of the authorities in flood zones on the banks of the River Adagum in Krymsk district. Local officials did not consistently oppose this activity: they ruled out the possibility of a disaster for the simple reason that, in the Soviet Union, the beds of rivers flowing from the Caucasus Mountains had been cleaned up on a regular basis. Flood-protection measures had been effective enough. But in post-Soviet times, the funding for cleaning riverbeds and limiting the deforestation of mountain areas was terminated, 950 due to lack of financial resources and the dismantling of the integrated system of state control over the political and economic matters in 1991. Almost every year after 1995, Krymsk district faced minor floods of the River Adagum, with water surges of up to 1.5 m. In August 2002, after heavy rains in the Krasnodar region and the collapse of a dam reservoir, 7000 homes and commercial buildings were flooded, 4968 homes damaged and 447 destroyed. Two villages in Krymsk district were completely washed away, killing 62 people. An investigation initiated by the Parliament after these floods found that they were caused by the widespread unauthorized construction of private houses and the silting of riverbeds. In both cases, local authorities were found to have been negligent. The investigation commission stated: \"[Local and regional] officials \u2026 were not recognizing their mistakes and are still trying to reduce the degree of [their] own guilt and amount of damage by misinforming federal authorities about the actual size [of the disaster]\u2026 The residents and tourists were not informed about the coming disaster\u2026 Responsible services did not take the necessary steps to prepare for a disaster: [there was no] drainage clearing, riverbeds were not maintained in a good state\". 951 After the investigation, two local officials were sentenced to 3 1 / 2 years on probation. According to one witness who survived the flood, \"those who were in the flood zone got from [local and regional] authorities significant compensations and everyone has forgotten about the incident\". 952 After the flood, the Krasnodar regional authorities ordered hydrological studies of the affected districts, but did not subsequently implement the recommendations of scientists. None of the regional and local officials worried about complex antiflooding measures because their had been no serious floods since 2002. Therefore, only 12 % of the budget intended for flood prevention measures-up to 229 US$40 million had been funded by federal government-was actually spent for this purpose. 953 Another problem was the high frequency of warnings about dangerous weather events issued by the Russian metrological service (Roshydromet). In 2010, Roshydromet released 2700 storm warnings throughout Russia; the average accuracy was 92 %. 954 In 2011, the service released 1800 storm warnings throughout the country (average accuracy was 91 %) and 700 warnings about dangerous weather events (average accuracy was 88 %). More than 100 storm warnings were registered in Krasnodar region alone in 2011 (roughly one warning every three days). In the five days before the disaster, Roshydromet issued 18 weather forecasts 955 and two storm warnings. Local authorities in Krymsk district received the first warning 36 h before the flash flood: \"in the next 3-6 hours [and during the whole of the next day], heavy thunderstorms, severe hailstorms and strong winds up to 20 m/s are expected\". 956 Six hours before the flash flood, they got a storm warning about possible natural hazards referring to the serious threat of flooding, severe rise of water levels and so on. During the investigation, it was revealed that, after receiving the second warning, local executives under the leadership of Vasily Krut'ko began to collect information about the current water level in the River Adagum by personal observation of the banks of the river. At 11:30 p.m. on 6 July 2012, about 2 1 / 2 h before the flash flood, the level of the Adagum in the city of Krymsk had only risen by 24 cm (later investigators declared that the flash flood raised the water level in the river by up to 6.8 m!). 957 Local officials were communicating regularly with each other by cell phones. Vasily Krut'ko, who had been the head of Krymsk district for the previous seven years, was reassuring subordinates: he emphasized that Roshydromet's storm warnings were always similar, such warnings came to him weekly and they had never been followed by serious flooding. 958 After the disaster, Russian meteorologists calculated that the volume of rainfalls on the day of the flood was three times the average daily maximum, and the river discharge exceeded the previous maximum recorded flow rate by a factor of 2.5; the last record was during the 2002 flooding. The likelihood of such anomalous levels of precipitation has been estimated to correspond to one such event every 953 Ibid. 200-300 years. 959 Despite this, Roshydromet's storm warnings did not point out that this was an exceptional event, unprecedented by any previous dangerous weather events in the Krasnodar region. Ultimately, local officials did not declare a state of emergency and did not wake up this district of 60,000 residents before the flash flood. All 52 witnesses who confirmed that they had heard an emergency signal had received it from three loudspeakers during the second hour after the flash flood reached Krymsk city 960 : by this time, the abnormal level of water was obvious to local officials, and they turned on the emergency loudspeakers. Later, scientists found the cause of the sudden 4-m wave of water described by many witnesses: a huge amount of debris from previous flooding (wood, silt, stones, and so on) had accumulated on the uncleaned bed and banks of the River Adagum over the previous ten years, which blocked the river flow under railway and road bridges located near the city, forming in this way temporary \"dams\". When a critical amount of water had built up, the bridges were destroyed and a wave-like flash flood rushed down to Krymsk city. 961 This explains why local officials did not record an unusual water surge within the city a couple of hours before the disaster. Detailed investigations later proved the innocence of local executives, but their criminal activity after the disaster-forging documents and misleading residents and federal executives-guaranteed them prison terms and strong rebuke from the majority of Russians.",

Regional officials continued to assure the federal authorities that they had all the resources they needed to clean up Krymsk city. However, clearing the city of dead animals began only after the deployment of army units on the 8th day after the disaster. During the week after the flooding, the regional authorities were still sending messages to Moscow that \"everything is fine, we have everything [we need] to control the situation\". 962 The Federal Minister of Health and Social Development assured Vladimir Putin immediately after the flood that all necessary vaccinations (tetanus, hepatitis and dysentery) would be made promptly. Nevertheless, a week later, the President said after his visit to affected areas: \"For me, it is strange now to hear that people were not vaccinated\". Victims complained to the President about difficulties in the state 959 Ibid. compensation process and the slow work of regional officials. Putin was furious about that: \"People complain that it is hard to reach the sources of state financial assistance. The queues are large. These queues crush. They say that 'We have already suffered. We need to deal with housing and children, but [clerks] force us to stand in queues'. It is necessary to change the situation radically. Next time [on the president's next visit to Krymsk city], I will come and stand myself in the queue. Is it so difficult to deploy mobile assistance offices throughout the city for comfortable handling?\". 963 The phrase of Vladimir Putin-\"I will come and stand myself in a queue\"-is reminiscent of his piloting of a firefighting aircraft during the wildfires of 2010, when the then Prime Minister tried to sway his subordinates in order to ensure that crisis response actions were provided well.",

During the Krymsk tragedy, the Russian leader made three emergency visits in 18 days for crisis response meetings that he held personally, and two additional trips in the year after the flood to check on the reconstruction of the city. Obviously, such frequent visits and ongoing control of subordinates originated from previous leadership mistakes. For instance, during the Kursk submarine accident, Russian naval officials gave distorted information to Putin and the public, reassuring them that the Northern Fleet of Russia could mount a successful rescue operation, when Vladimir Putin was on vacation. And when hurricane Katrina struck the coast off Louisiana, George Bush was on vacation at his Texas ranch. In the midst of an uncoordinated response from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Louisiana state and local government, the National Guards and the US Army Corps of Engineers, Bush visited the Gulf Coast only on the fifth day after the disaster. 963 Transcript of the crisis response meeting under leadership of Vladimir Putin in Krymsk, The Kremlin, July 15, 2012.",

The majority of risk concealment cases in the sector are similar because of its specific business practice. Mutually competing manufacturers tend to produce similar goods in every product segment because each manufacturer is continually watching competitors for any innovations, which will be implemented as fast as possible in the products of all manufacturers. Prof. Leveson assessed the problem very clearly: \"At the same time that the development of new technology has sprinted forward, the time to market for new products has greatly decreased, and strong pressures exist to decrease this time even further. The average time to translate a basic technical discovery into a commercial product in the early part of this century was thirty years. Today our technologies get to market in two to three years and may be obsolete in five. We no longer have the luxury of carefully testing systems and designs to understand all the potential behaviors and risks before commercial or scientific use. [This leads to] reduced ability to learn from experience\". 964 Therefore, manufacturers try to launch new products as swiftly as possible to gain a competitive advantage during the first few months, and sometimes ignore defects in the design of innovative production. Such problems have occurred in many cases with complex innovative products. The retail sector has seen the Ford-Firestone tire controversy (1990), the Intel Pentium FDIV Bug Crisis (1994), and problems with the antenna of the Apple iPhone 4 (2010) and with the brakes of the Toyota Prius (2010-2013).

Usually, the race to keep prices competitive with similar products results in the reduction of production costs by any means necessary. Thus, Carlos Ghosn, Chairman and CEO of the Renault-Nissan Alliance, initiated an aggressive downsizing campaign in the late 1990s to rescue Nissan, the second largest car producer in Japan, from imminent bankruptcy. He was so successful with huge cost reductions-10 % down on supplier parts and US$2.25 billion in savings-that he was nicknamed \"le cost killer\" and \"Mr. Fix It\". 968 Toyota was forced to respond and adopt a similar action: the company launched a cost-cutting strategy called \"Construction of Cost Competitiveness for the 21st Century\" (CCC21) and may have perhaps broken its own cardinal rule that \"customers are always prior to profits\". 969 CCC21 had an impact on many spheres of Toyota production. After its implementation, Toyota faced extensive recalls of cars because of flaws in design and supplied parts; between 2004 and 2006, the company recalled more vehicles than ever before in its history. In 2006, Japanese investigators found out that, since 1996, Toyota had been aware of a defective relay rod on the Toyota Hilux Surf, but recalled the model only after a lawsuit was initiated by relatives of people killed in a crash caused by the defective rod. Before the crash, Toyota managers thought that problems occurred only in \"unusual and extreme conditions\". 970 Information about flaws in car designs, shortcomings in manufacturing processes and production defects in parts from other suppliers was not communicated well within the world's largest car-maker: according to insiders from the American branch of Toyota, \"working for the company is like working for the Central Intelligence Agency, where information is shared only on a 'need to know' basis\". 971",

            "text": "During the crisis of the uncontrolled acceleration of certain Toyota vehicles (2009-2010), investigators published internal correspondence between Toyota managers, confirming that 37,900 customer contact reports of unintended acceleration had been logged in Toyota's complaint coding system 972 since the early 2000s. This problem had led to 34 deaths and thousands of customer complaints to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). 973 Toyota knew about problems with gas pedals made by an Indiana-based supplier, and that the unintended acceleration problem only existed on US-made cars. 974 Nevertheless, the company did not launch a detailed investigation of the problem and made only a limited recall, because of the significant incurred expenses: in 2007, they saved up to $100 million on a limited recall of floor mats in Camry and Lexus ES sedans. 975 But, in autumn 2009, the American media released a recording of a conversation between a 911 call center employee and the driver of a Lexus ES 350 in San Diego, California, who was asking for help with a stuck accelerator pedal. During the call, the car crashed, and all four occupants were killed. 976 This case led to severe accusations of Toyota by the American media and attracted the attention of regulators. According to Jim Press, Toyota's former U.S. chief, \"The root cause of their problems is that the company was hijacked, some years ago, by anti-(Toyoda) family, financially oriented pirates\u2026 [These executives] didn't have the character necessary to maintain a customer first focus\". 977 The Japanese view emphasizing the role of complexity, and of mistakes in managing it, is well represented by economic professor Takahiro Fujimoto from the University of Tokyo, a leading authority on the Toyota production system and automotive product development. Toyota has been a frontrunner in making very complex products, like hybrids or luxury cars, at very high volume and then growing the volume. In addition, constraints on cars have grown tremendously in the last decade: \"What was okay 10 years ago is not okay now\u2026 some of the things that are part of the Toyota problem now were not a big problem 20 years ago. So customers and society are fussier and fussier about what they expect from car\u2026 For example, with the Prius recall, the problem resulted because Toyota tried to problems. Then people saw that as, 'Gee, Toyota is escaping from responsibility for this problem'. This is not what Toyota meantbut the way they handled the initial problem was very bad, I think. 980 It is thus the combination of growing complexity, pushed by competition as well as society demands, together with overconfidence in being able to deal with the problems that led to Toyota's crisis. Overconfidence led Toyota managers to underestimate the difficulties in handling the novel kinds of arising complexities, and to believe that Toyota would do better than other companies: \"Ironically, as a result they probably took in way too much complexity. It was [beyond] their capacity\". 981 According to professor Fujimoto, arrogance is the number one enemy of the Toyota philosophy: \"But they didn't take this seriously until big problems happened. I would probably say middle managers, particularly at headquarters, started to deviate from the Toyota Way by being arrogant, being overconfident, and also they started not to listen to the problems that customers raised\". 982",

Remarkably, they declared that it was mainly \"the publicity surrounding NHTSA's investigations, related recalls, and Congressional hearings [that] was the major contributor to the timing and volume of complaints\". Both also noted that \"the vast majority of complaints involved incidents that originated when the vehicle was stationary or at very low speeds and contained allegations of very wide throttle openings, often with allegations that brakes were not effective\". NHTSA's analysis indicated that \"the most likely cause of the acceleration was actually pedal misapplication (i.e., the driver's unintended application of the accelerator rather than, or in addition to, the brake)\". 988 The hysteria in the US against Toyota is an example of the \"social proof\" mechanism that Robert Cialdini has abundantly documented and dissected to describe group actions under social influence. 989,990 Social influence describes the fact that people will do things that they see other people are doing, such as the famous example of someone looking up into the sky, leading to bystanders then looking up into the sky to see what he was seeing. This may partly explain the initial reluctance of Toyota management to acknowledge the responsibility of their product whose reliability they trusted so much. Thus, we can conclude that Toyota made essentially no mistakes in producing automobiles but made serious blunders in its management of the public perception and in dealing with the politics in Washington, as reported by US 991 as well as Japanese media. As Mr. Yoshimi Inaba, the president of Toyota North America, said: \"there is sometimes a lack of communication because of the language differences, because of the cultural differ-ences\u2026 [about] this sticky pedal situation\u2026 yes, we knew that probably a year ago in Europe. And I say that had not been shared enough well on this side. So we did not hide it, but it was not properly shared. We need to do a much better job in sharing. Whatever is happening in Europe should be known in the United States so we are all alert\". 992 Toyota had thus a problem with managing the cultural difference in driving as well as the different expectations of their customers. Since then, imitating the major US firms that sell extensively to the government or depend on 988 it for regulations, and must of necessity engage in lobbying (which is protected by the US constitution as an expression of free speech), Toyota has taken steps to strengthen its connections to US politicians and their cronies in Washington so as not to repeat the same mistake.",

Jean-Claude Mas was arrested and confessed the fraud: \"I knew that this gel wasn't officially registered, but I did it knowingly because the PIP gel was less expensive \u2026 and of much higher quality\u2026 The material was better than that used to make the officially authorized gel\". However, British surgeons subsequently stated, after 453 patient examinations, that PIP breast implants ruptured in at least 16 % of patients fitted with them-while the usual failure rate does not exceed 1 %. 1003 Twenty cases of different types of cancer were connected with flawed PIP's implants. 1004 A former PIP employee testified that there were \"unscientific tests of product quality, such as judging silicone gel by sticking a finger\". Yves Haddad, a lawyer who represented Jean-Claude Mas, declared to journalists: \"Maybe it's shameful \u2026 [but w]e live in a capitalist world\". 1005 Three factors helped Jean-Claude Mas to conceal for decades the risk of flawed implants.",

Some of them were convinced by Mas that the industrial gel they were using was \"better than that used to make the officially authorized gel\u2026 We organized everything to escape being became alarming only during years after implantation. 1011 In many emerging countries, such statistics were totally absent. In 2000, the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) made an inspection of a PIP factory in La Seyne-sur-Mer in Southern France after the regulator had received 1810 reports about problems with PIP's saline implants. Immediately after the inspection, FDA prohibited the sale of PIP's saline implants in the USA, because of evidence of the use of \"adulterated\" material in the production of saline implants. 1012 Nevertheless, there is no confirmation that the FDA shared information about its findings with French colleagues from AFSSAPS. 1013 It was only 10 years later in March 2010, after numerous complaints from French surgeons and customers on the low quality of PIP's silicon implants, that the AFSSAPS made a comprehensive inspection of the PIP factory: the inspectors accidentally found six discarded plastic containers of Silopren industrial gel. It took 17 (!) years from the first attempts of Jean-Claude Mas to conceal what was going on at PIP to reveal a world-wide fraud, which affected more than 300,000 patients! Dow Corning and other corporations knew that silicon breast implants were porous when they marketed them. In 1994, these manufacturers agreed to pay $4.75 billion to 60,000 affected women. 1014,1015 Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, class-action lawsuits claimed that Dow Corning's silicone breast implants caused systemic health problems. The claims first focused on breast cancer and then drifted to a range of autoimmune diseases, including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and various neurological problems. This led to numerous lawsuits beginning in 1984 and culminating in a 1998 multibillion-dollar class action settlement. As a result, Dow Corning was in bankruptcy protection for nine years, ending in June 2004 during which time it largely withdrew from clinical market. 1016",

Of course the most notorious, flagrant and-for decades at least-successful attempt to conceal the truth from the public took place within the world tobacco industry, causing up to 6 million deaths per year from smoking worldwide. 1017 In 1992, Judge H. Lee Sarokin, during the tobacco-related case of Haines v. Liggett Group, had this to say: \"All too often in the choice between the physical health of consumers and the financial well-being of business, concealment is chosen over disclosure, sales over safety, and money over morality. Who are these persons who knowingly and secretly decide to put the buying public at risk solely for the purpose of making profits and who believe that illness and death of consumers is an apparent cost of their own prosperity? As the following facts disclose, despite some rising pretenders, the tobacco industry may be the king of concealment and disinformation\". 1018 Like the tobacco industry, the world food industry has decades of experience in concealing the truth from the public, most notably about the high sugar content of many processed foods. Some examples of concealment within the food industry on a national scale follow. In the middle of the 1980s, because the domestic meat industry was highly profitable, the British Government concealed facts at all stages and even corrupted evidence about the mad cow disease, 1019 which led to more than 200 deaths during the following decades. 1020 In 2013, the meat adulteration scandal in 14 European countries (the undeclared or improperly declared",

PIP implants would now consist of 25 % medical gel and 75 % industrial gel, so the cost of producing the new implant was US$50, instead of US$68 for an implant filled with 100 % medical gel; and the implants sold for about US$400 to French cosmetic surgeons and US$130 to Latin American surgeons.

At 304 m high, the Nurek dam was the tallest in the world at that time. The radial vibration of the turbine bearing led to metal fatigue in the stud-bolts of the turbine cap, and 50 out of a total of 72 bolts finally broke off from the cap. Fortunately, the station staff quickly detected the water flowing out of the turbine shaft into the generator hall, and used the penstock butterfly valve to shut down Turbine 1 with no consequences to the other turbines. Despite the prompt and effective resolution of the problem, information about this incident was not widely distributed by the Soviet Ministry of Energy and Electrification among engineers and managers of other Soviet hydroelectric stations.

The total depth of the well was 6500 m: 1500 m below sea level and 4000 m beneath the seafloor in Block 252 of the Mississippi Canyon. The proven reserves of the field were 110 million barrels 424 ; the potential income from extraction of this amount of oil was approximately US$10 billion. The platform was owned by Transocean Ltd., the largest offshore drilling operator in the world. BP (formerly known as British Petroleum) leased the rig for exploration of the Macondo field. Halliburton Company, one of the world's largest oilfields services companies, was engaged as the cementing contractor.On April 20th, 2010 at 9:45 p.m. US Central Time, a blowout of oil, gas and concrete from the well occurred on the Deepwater Horizon platform, causing an explosion and a fire that sunk the platform. There were 126 crewmembers on the rig during the accident; 11 people perished and 17 were injured. The rest of the crew survived unharmed, but the accident led to oil being discharged from the well for 87 days-for a total of 3.19 million barrels.425  This was the third largest oil spill in the history of the oil industry, after the Kuwaiti oil fires in 1991 where the approximate discharge was 10 million barrels and the blowout at Lakeview Gusher Number One oil well in Kern County, California, which was out of control for nine months in 1910-1911 and led to the release of approximately 9 million barrels. BP was forced to cover all expenses incurred in shutting down the deepwater leak and 424 Macondo: The Gulf Oil Disaster, Chief Counsel's Report, National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drill, Government Printing Office, 2011, p. 25.425  On January 15, 2015, a US federal judge ruled that BP spilled 3.19 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster. The US government has argued for 4.2 million and BP for 2.45 million. Six experts testified that as few as 2.4 millions barrels of oil, and as many as 6 million, escaped during the 86 day long accident. BP and the US government agreed that 810,000 barrels were captured. The importance of this ruling lies in the fine facing BP, calculated at US$4300 per barrel.

Neither Thiokol nor NASA expected the rubber O-rings sealing the joints to be touched by hot gases during motor ignition, much less to be partially burned. However, as tests and then flights confirmed damage to the sealing rings, the reaction by both NASA and Thiokol was to increase the amount of damage considered 'acceptable'\".163   In fact, the problem of the O-rings was known from 1977, 164,165 but \"NASA and contractor management first failed to recognize it as a problem, then failed to fix it and finally treated it as an acceptable flight risk.[MTI]  did not accept the implication of tests early in the program that the design had a serious and unanticipated flaw. [NASA executives] did not accept the judgment of its engineers that the design was unacceptable and, as the joint problems grew in number and severity, NASA minimized them in management briefings and reports. [MTI also stated that] the condition is not desirable but is acceptable\". 166 NASA executives were not informed in detail about the seriousness of the problem with solid rocket boosters during cold weather launches before January 27, 1986. 167 On the day before the launch of Challenger, during conference calls with NASA, Boisjoly tried to convince MTI executives and NASA managers to cancel the flight until the temperature on the launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center reached at least +11.5 \u00b0C (53 \u00b0F) when all of the solid rocket boosters would be defrosted.

The result would have been an unacceptable compression of the time available for the crews to accomplish their required training. 2. Spare parts are in critically short supply.

During hearings before the US Congress Committee on Science and Technology, one committee member made the following assessment of NASA's organizational culture prior to the disaster: \"[O]ne difficult question is this whole attitude, this whole new culture that grew up in NASA and perhaps in the Marshall Center, this culture that has been called arrogance, conceit that they knew it all; they didn't need to include in the information circle outside experts. They didn't need to listen to the Rockwell fears, expressed fears of the subzero temperatures. They pressured Morton Thiokol not to bother with a lot of chintzy concerns about safety. They excluded the astronauts themselves from the information circle. They had the feeling that they knew it all and didn't need any outside information.

            "text": ", in parallel with the test operation of the prototype RBMK in Leningrad, fullscale construction was initiated not only at the Chernobyl NPP near Kiev (in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic), but at Kursk and Smolensk in the Russian Soviet Socialistic Republic, and at the Ignalina NPP near Vilnius (in the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic). The original RBMK design was not fundamentally redeveloped or revised for these serial units, and did not even include the improvements recommended after the 1975 accident at Leningrad NPP. 218 Academician Valery Legasov concluded that \"[The Soviet Union] built the world's first nuclear power plant [in Obninsk], but later we slowed down the development of this technology and the review of all safety issues associated with the operation of such plants [until changes in our energy supply strategy for the western part of the USSR, when we] began to hurry. Consequently this haste led to more units being built with limited funding. There was a need from the economy. Keeping the costs down began with [rejection to construct] containment [buildings over reactors, which would have increased the construction costs of Soviet NPPs by 30 % and lengthened the construction period for the plants]\u2026 We all began to show concern about the quality of education and training of the personnel responsible for the design, construction and operation of nuclear power plants, because the number of units increased dramatically, but the quality of the personnel involved in the process decreased [while developers of the RBMK expected that comprehensive organizational measures could compensate the technical shortcomings of the reactors]\u2026 There was a constant need for new buildings, new benches, new people for this job, because the number of units [reactors] increased. However this development was still not qualitative, [only] quantitative\u2026 [The problems of the Soviet nuclear energy, revealed in the Chernobyl disaster] generally originate from the organizational approach toward development, more rapid development, of new technology\".219  It was common practice for the Politburo to issue deadlines for the construction of nuclear plants according to the date of the next Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, with no regard for the availability of equipment for the plant or for the recommended schedule for proper construction. All this resulted in constant rush in the development of the Soviet civil nuclear industry in the 1970s and 1980s, repeating the practice that had prevailed during the nuclear arms race between the USSR and the West in the late 1940s and 1950s.A Fatal Regulation MistakeThe Politburo issued another pivotal decision: responsibility for all the new RBMK NPPs would be transferred from the predominantly military Minsredmash to the civil Ministry of Energy and Electrification of the USSR. There were several explanations for this decision. The developers of the RBMK reactor-all nationally respected and honored scientists-convinced everybody, especially the senior executives of the Soviet Union, of the absolute safety of the RBMK reactor and the infallibility of Soviet nuclear technology.220,221,222,223 Their overconfidence persuaded Politburo members and executives at the Ministry of Energy and 219 Valery Legasov, Record from cassettes, 1986-1988. 220 Anatoly Dyachenko, Experience of liquidation of Chernobyl disaster, Federal State Unitary Enterprise \"Institute of Strategic Stability\" of Rosatom, Moscow, 2004, http://www.iss-atom.ru/ book-7/glav-2-3.htm. 221 Ibid. 222 Interview with Mikhail Gorbachev, documentary \"The Battle of Chernobyl\", Director: Thomas Johnson, 2006. 223 Nikolaii Karpan, Vengeance of peaceful atom, Dnepropetrovsk, 2006, p. 401.",

Academician Dollezhal, Chief Design Engineer of the reactor, was also unaware of it. [Later, after the accident], when I was reading the plan of the experiment, I was shocked. Many actions of this plan led the reactor beyond its design state\u2026 Let's also ask who developed the plan. Executives of the NPP employed for this projectan organization that had no experience with the nuclear power plant [the organization was contractor of the Ministry of Energy and Electrification and specialized only in electric equipment]. Dilettantes can be well intentioned, but they could cause immense catastrophewhich happened at Chernobyl. The director of the station, without summoning even the deputy chief engineer of the plant who had education in physics, signed a contract with [the service contractor] to develop the plan of the experiment. The final version of the experiment was sent for consultation and testing by the Hydroproject Institute [the designers of the Chernobyl plant]\u2026 Members of the Institute, who had some experience with nuclear power plants, did not approve the plan and refused to endorse it\u2026 I often think now what would have happened if the Hydroproject Institute had informed us! However, the staff [of the Institute] could not even have imagined that the plant [staff] would dare to conduct the experiment. Minsredmash was not informed about the experiment because Chernobyl NPP had been transferred into the control of the Ministry of Energy\u2026 In Minsredmash \u2026 were professionals with military-like discipline, who strictly followed the instructions, which in our case are extremely important\u2026 There are instructions, which must be followed by any NPP staff. This technical regulation is a guarantee of safety [of the plant]\u2026 [Furthermore], the experiment plan violated applicable instructions for operating nuclear power plants in twelve sections! We can say that the design of the reactor has flaws. However, the cause of the accident, after all -[was] a poorly prepared experiment, [in] flagrant violation of the instructions for NPP operations\u2026 I repeat, there are deficiencies in the reactor. Nowadays, these disadvantages are reduced. [Nevertheless], the problem is not the construction of the reactor. [Imagine] you are driving a car and turning the steering wheel in the wrong directionand an accident takes place! Is it the fault of the engine? Or the designer of the car? Everyone will answer that it is the 230 Grigori Medvedev, Chernobyl Notebook, New World Magazine, \u2116 6, 1989. 231 Nikolaii Karpan, Vengeance of peaceful atom, Dnepropetrovsk, 2006, pp. 446, 451. fault of the unskilled driver\". 232 In 1999, Academician Dollezhal also stated his position: \"We left our chairs with Alexandrov [after the Chernobyl accident]. We, of course, are guilty [as developers of the reactor]. I have my version of the accident. First of all, the personnel was terrible; we were sending warnings in all instances but without results; we warned about the negligent regime of operation\". 233 Nikolay Fomin, Chief Engineer of Chernobyl nuclear power plant during the disaster, confirmed also his responsibility and that of his staff with respect to the accident: \"I was largely blamed. Not everything that has been said about me was fair, as I see it. Nevertheless, one thing I blame myself for: I have always believed that the key to the work of the nuclear industry is technologybut it turned out that the main thing is people. I underestimated their value\". 234 Tragic Lack of Communication Between the Main Responsible Agencies The situation was exacerbated by a total lack of communication about accidents between the military Minsredmash and the civil Ministry of Energy and Electrification, because of the culture of total secrecy 235,236,237 that developed within Soviet military nuclear programs during the Cold War. Consequently, neither the developers of the reactor nor Minsredmash officials informed personnel at other Soviet NPPs with RBMK reactors about the accident at the Leningrad NPP in 1975, or about technical imperfections of the reactor design. 238,239 Moreover, because developers did not eliminate defects revealed during the accident in 1975, the positive SCRAM effect within the RBMK series was observed again at Ignalina NPP, and during the launch of RBMK-1000 Reactor #4 at Chernobyl NPP in 1983. 240,241 The Chief Design Engineer for the RBMK reactors discussed the problem with his colleagues by correspondence, 242 stating that design changes would be made to correct the problem.

The Director of the Institute, and President of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR [the collective Soviet body of advanced scientists from different fields, which could adequately assess any theoretical conclusions regarding the physics of the RBMK] is comrade academician Alexandrov in one person.

Boris Sherbina (Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers-the Soviet government-and Head of the State Commission for liquidation of the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster) said: \"Evaluating the operational reliability of the RBMK reactor, a group of professionals working on behalf of the Commission concluded that its characteristics fall short of modern safety requirements\u2026 RBMK reactors are potentially dangerous\u2026 Apparently, all were under the impression that nuclear power plants were highly safe, as they were aggressively advertised to be\u2026 [Therefore] since 1983, the executive board of the Ministry of Energy and Electrification has never discussed the issues related to the safety of nuclear power plants\u2026[Everybody]  believed that the issue of civil nuclear safety was solved. A statement to this effect was in a Kurchatov Institute publication\". In addition you expect that we will look at you as to gods. From this, all went wrong [concerning the regulation of the Soviet nuclear industry]. It occurred because all ministries and research centers were out of control [of the Politburo and the Soviet government]. Finally it ended in failure\u2026 It was the responsibility of the staff [of Chernobyl NPP] that the accident took place [because the experiment on Reactor #4 was approved by executives of the plant, while it was not endorsed by the Science Director and the Chief Design Engineer of the reactor; operators chose to deviate from the program of the experiment; several instructions were violated during the experiment, etc.], nevertheless, the scale of the accident [was caused by] reactor physics [and is therefore the responsibility of the developers of the RBMK]\u2026 [The Politburo] did not receive information about what was happening in reality\u2026 All [nuclear-related] matters were classified and kept away from the reach of the Politburo. No representative of the [Communist] Party was allowed to meddle in this sphere. Moreover, [the Soviet] government had no power to determine which type of nuclear reactor [the country] should develop. Within the entire system [the nuclear energy industry], there was a spirit of servility, fawning, factionalism, persecution of dissidents [as in the case of Vladimir Volkov, the whistle blower from the Kurchatov Institute], window dressing, personal ties and different clans around different executives\". A representative of the State Committee for supervision of the safe conduct in the nuclear industry of the USSR (Gosatomenergonadzor USSR) said: \"Everybody in the industry should be afraid of Gosatomnadzor! 249 \u2026 It is impossible to ensure the complete safety of existing nuclear power units. However, if operators strictly follow standing orders and instructions [they could be operated safely]. With the approval of the reactor design, it was known that it would have 'positive void' and 'positive temperature' effects\u2026 Nevertheless, [Gosatomenergonadzor] never checked and studied the shortcomings [of the reactor] concerning the 'physics' and the degree of danger\". The majority of the staff of Gosatomenergonadzor USSR during the Chernobyl disaster were former specialists from Minsredmash; obviously, they did not want to criticize former superiors, and thus the government oversight over the industry was not independent. In addition, academician Valery Legasov stated after the disaster that most of those at the Kurchatov Institute (part of Minsredmash) tried not to ask executives of Minsredmash embarrassing questions because they were receiving bonuses from the ministry. The general opinion was the following: \"If I say anything about [the necessity of] the containment [vessels at Soviet NPPs], obviously, I will not receive a premium [from the Ministry]! If I express anything [against the mainstream within the industry and the opinion of the management], I will not be published and [my] dissertation will be not defended\"\u2026 250 \u2026 Mikhail Gorbachev [question to representatives of Minsredmash]: \"What can you say about the RBMK reactor?\" Alexander Meshkov (First Deputy Minister of Minsredmash): \"It is a proven reactor. However it does not have containment. If [the staff of the NPPs] comply strictly with the instructions, then it is safe\". Mikhail Gorbachev: \"Meshkov continues to assure us that the reactor is safe\u2026 So, is it [still] possible to operate them and to construct more? \u2026 All that we collected about Chernobyl by this time leads to one conclusionthe reactor should be decommissioned. It is dangerous. And you [to Meshkov] defend esprit de corps\". Anatoly Alexandrov (Science director of RBMK, director of the Kurchatov Institute, president of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR): \"I'm sure that we will not build RBMK reactors in future. Concerning improvement [of the RBMK series], the costs will not be compensated. [Nevertheless], I think that [positive reactivity] of the reactor can be eliminated [on existing reactors]. We have some ideas about possible solutions to this problem. This could be done in one or two years\u2026 The existing reactors can be made safe. I put my head on the block\u2026 that they can be improved. I beg you to release me from the duties of President of the Academy of Sciences and give me a chance to correct my mistake about the shortcomings of this reactor\". to solve urgent domestic energy needs]. This involvesconstant rush. Consequently, it leads to [low] quality of the equipment and [poor] safety measures\". \u2026 \u2026 Gennady Shasharin (First Deputy Minister of Energy and Electrification): \"The ministry believed that Chernobyl NPP was exemplary. 251 We appointed the best director to the plant \u2026 [The main problem was] that we began to interact with nuclear energy on a first-name basis, but it [nuclear energy] requires respect. The staff [of Chernobyl NPP] did not know that the reactor can accelerate. Moreover, we [the Ministry of Energy and Electrification] did not know [about the 'positive SCRAM effect']. The staff [of Chernobyl NPP] is responsible for the accident. Nevertheless, I agree that the scale of the accident was caused by the physics of the reactor\u2026 Obviously, the first stages of Smolensk NPP, Kursk NPP and two reactors on Leningrad NPP should be closed. They are not subject for reconstruction\u2026 It is possible to get some units on these NPPs into shape. However, it will take one year. In addition, it will be very expensive\". 251 In 1985, the plant was called best nuclear plant within the Ministry of Energy and Electrification of USSR [Nikolaii Karpan, Vengeance of peaceful atom, Dnepropetrovsk, 2006, pp. 410, 487]. In 1992 IAEA's report, it was mentioned that \"As a whole, the Chernobyl personnel in 1986 were characterized as a fairly typical, mature and stable group of specialists with qualifications regarded in the USSR as satisfactory. They were no better, but no worse, than the personnel at other nuclear plants\" [The Chernobyl Accident: Updating of INSAG-1, IAEA Publications, Vienna, 1992, p. 31]. Yes, I did. But it was not acknowledged on paper. There was a lot of resistance. Alexandrov was against it. The Academy of Sciences too. Minsredmash required [the Ministry of Energy and Electrification] to increase the production of energy in nuclear power plants by 2000\"\u2026 \u2026 Victor Bryukhanov (Director of Chernobyl NPP): \"We did not know that something similar had happened at the Leningrad nuclear power plant in 1975\". Central Committee Secretariat): \"Radical reconstruction of the reactor makes it uneconomical. For many years, we were unaware what might happen. We stubbornly moved towards the accident. It was inevitable as a result of such behavior. A legend was created about the safety of nuclear power\". Nikolay Ryzhkov (Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers: the equivalent of Prime Minister in Western countries and second in command within the Politburo after Mikhail Gorbachev): \"At the dawn of the nuclear industry, everything was conducted strictly and soundly. Gradually, the civil nuclear industry has gone beyond the boundaries [of Minsredmash], but [military] discipline 'has not fallen off' \u2026 In addition, there was evidence of excessive authority in the hands of [the executives of Minsredmash] and Alexandrov. Things became less exacting and vigilant on all levels. After all, there was no single year without emergency situations at [Soviet nuclear] plants [according to data revealed at this meeting for the period 1981-1985, there were 1042 emergency showdowns among all nuclear reactors in the USSR, including 381 at RBMK reactors; at this time, there were 104 incidents at Chernobyl NPP]. There were no conclusions from the accident at Leningrad NPP. There were shortcomings \u2026 and they were obscured, concealed in order to avoid publicity. Principalities took less responsibility. Without serious measures, we are not guaranteed against repetition [of the disaster]\". Egor Ligachev (Politburo member): \"This is the lesson [about what happens when we have] a monopoly in science and production! We need to fully replace the structure of the nuclear industry. The current structure implies irresponsibility. [We are witnesses that] within the Ministry of Energy [and] at the Academy of Sciences, there has been extreme self-confidence\". Mikhail Gorbachev: \"The accident could have been prevented. If there had been proper and timely information [about the features of the RBMK], then [the Politburo] could have taken action and we would have avoided this accident. However, we were faced with an extreme manifestation of irresponsibility\". 252,253",

The forms accompanying the permit mentioned many shortcomings of the station, and the management of the station and RAO UES received recommendations regarding these imperfections. For instance, several problems with the turbines were emphasized: \"In the initial period of operation of [SSHPS], some design flaws were identified in several parts of the turbines [abnormal vibration of turbines during different operating regimes], which were partially eliminated by operating staff and manufacturers.

It appears that Halliburton never reported the results of the earlier February test to BP\u2026 Halliburton conducted another round of tests in mid-April, just before pumping the final cement job. By then, the BP team had given Halliburton more accurate information about the temperatures and pressures at the bottom of the Macondo well, and Halliburton had progressed further with its cementing plan. Using this information, the laboratory personnel conducted several tests, including a foam stability test, starting on approximately April 13. The first test Halliburton conducted showed once again that the cement slurry would be unstable.The Commission does not believe that Halliburton ever reported this information to BP\u2026 It appears that Halliburton personnel responded instead by modify-ing the test conditionsspecifically, the pre-testing conditioning timeand thereby achieving an arguably successful test result\u2026 In fact, it appears that Halliburton did not even have testing results in its possession showing the Macondo slurry was stable until after the job had been pumped. It is difficult to imagine a clearer failure of management or communication\u2026 BP's fundamental mistake was its failurenotwithstanding the inherent uncertainty of cementing and the many specific risk factors surrounding the cement job at Macondoto exercise special caution before relying on the primary cement as a barrier to hydrocarbon flow\u2026 BP, Transocean, and Halliburton failed to communicate adequately. Information appears to have been excessively compartmentalized at Macondo as a result of poor communication. BP did not share important information with its contractors, or sometimes internally even with members of its own team. Contractors did not share important information with BP or each other. As a result, individuals often found themselves making critical decisions without a full appreciation for the context in which they were being made (or even without recognition that the decisions were critical)\".457   A year after the disaster, in April 2011, BP filed a lawsuit against Halliburton accusing it to have intentionally destroyed the evidence related to Halliburton's 455 National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling.

On $9 million in retail loans that Ameriquest had extended on the 64 homes, the seven friends earned $172,400, which works out to almost two points (2 percent) per loan. The loan officers, most of whom were in their 20 s, found the borrowers by going through the company's 'turndown files' where LOs stored the names of customers who had previously been rejected for loans. But the borrowers didn't receive kickbacks from the LOsthey were just happy to get a mortgage\". 818 This fed on the absence of information concerning payments of subprime borrowers: \"Mike McMahon, the stock analyst, saw the problem coming. 'They were way too optimistic on the life of the loans,' he said. 'Everyone was guessing with limited historical data.' Historical data? As far as securitization went, subprime mortgages had no history. 'Everyone was guessing,' said McMahon. 'These weren't Fannie, Freddie, and FHA loans where there's 40 years of past data to look at on how they'd perform'\". 819 Corruptive Assessments of American Rating Agencies In their book Chain of Blame, Paul Muolo and Mathew Padilla summarize the process as follows: \"Almost every mortgage they put into a bond was a loan made to a borrower who either had bad credit or was considered a statedincome risk.

Wall Street loved any type of loan that was paying a higher rate than the conventional or \"A\" paper rate of good credit quality mortgages sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two congressionally chartered mortgage giants whose mission in life was to buy such loans. A higheryielding mortgage meant that a Wall Street firm like Bear Stearns could create a higheryielding bond to sell to an investor. Every time a bond salesman at Bear (or any other firm) sells a bond, he takes a fraction of the deal for himself. On a $50 million bond, the commission might be an eighth of a point, which works out to $62,500. Bond commissions are not openly publicized and can vary greatly depending on what type of bond is being sold.

I would like to point out here that Toyota's priorities have traditionally been the following: first, safety; second, quality; third, volume. These priorities became confused. And we were not able to stop, think, and make improvements as much as we were able to before, and our basic stance to listen to our customers' voices to make better products has weakened somewhat. We pursued growth over the speed at which we were able to develop our people and our organization, and we should sincerely be mindful of that\". 979 Professor Fujimoto emphasized that all the problems associated with the Toyota recalls were design quality problems rather than manufacturing quality problems. He is adamant in pointing out that \"to my knowledge they are not trying to hide the problems. But when a very complex problem happened, they were not sure to what extent this was a responsibility for the company, and to what extent other parties were responsible. So their attitude was, 'Wait a minute. This is complicated'.

Some testified: \"Mas would tell them we used the silicone oil for creams, certainly not breast implants\u2026 We were very uncomfortable and let Mas do all the talking\". Others were simply not aware of changes in the gel formula. As a result, Mas was able to declare that they had been working with it for decades without any problems. 1006 Secondly, NuSil, the American gel that was medically approved worldwide, was purchased from the California-based NuSil Technology. The founder of NuSil Technology was Donald McGhan-who also distributed PIP's saline implants in the USA. McGhan had started his career at a Dow Corning laboratory where the first breast implants were made in the early 1960s, but, in 2009, he was given a 10-year jail sentence for wire fraud: he had been illegally using money from clients of a real estate company in an attempt to build yet another implant business. 1007 Jean-Claude Mas and Donald McGhan had a mutual business interest in working together: McGhan distributed PIP's saline implants on the American market and, in return, his company was able to export its silicon gel for decades without fear of possible competition from other medical gel suppliers.Thirdly, flaws in legislation helped Mas mislead the regulator and the certifying agency. AFSSAPS was the regulator of PIP, but did not certify cosmetic products-which, by the way, are much less strictly certified than pharmaceuticals. Jean-Claude Mas invited TUV Rheinland, a private German company, to certify PIP's factory and implants. In all documents, PIP was demonstrating the use of NuSil, the American medical gel. Because of the absence of legal requirements about unannounced inspections from AFSSAPS and TUV Rheinland, PIP was informed of upcoming checks ten days in advance according to European guidelines. Moreover, during yearly audits, TUV Rheinland did not make any random on-site lab tests of the implants. Mas testified: \"Since 1997, we automatically hid the products that allowed us to make the PIP gel\u2026 because I knew they weren't abiding to regulation\". 1008 After the truth was revealed, the French regulator declared that the fraud was so sophisticated that \"it's not evident that an inspection, even an unannounced one, could have been effective\". 1009 Also, PIP was focusing on expansion to the emerging markets of Latin America and Asia, where regulation of the cosmetic industry was weaker than in France. 1010 Regulators in these countries relied on previous validation of the quality of the implants issued by European institutions, and did not carefully test the implants.In the first few years, the low quality of the PIP implants was not obvious to surgeons throughout the world: statistics about the rupture of PIP's implants",
