The final winners of the best paper within one topic will be announced at the closing ceremony and presented with a diploma and their prize (\u20ac 1500.-) In (a)symptomatic high-grade internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis, ultrasound and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) are the established techniques for grading ICA stenosis; contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CEMRA) is replacing DSA. Aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of CEMRA in studying the carotid arteries and to compare CEMRA with DSA findings. Two MRA protocols, differing in acquisition voxel size, were used to assess whether intravoxel dephasing effects could modify diagnostic accuracy of CEMRA. 34 patients were studied: 20 (group 1) underwent a CEMRA protocol with an acquisition voxel size of 1.07 mm 3 and 14 (group 2) with a voxel of 0.40 mm 3 . DSA was perfomed in all patients. Morphology and degree of stenosis were evaluated, and a qualitative analysis comparing CEMRA and DSA findings was obtained. Diagnostic accuracy and correlation with DSA results for ICA stenosis were calculated in all patients and, separately, in the two groups. CEMRA diagnostic accuracy and agreement with DSA were respectively 94 % and k = 0.84; no significant difference was found among the two groups. Qualitative analysis revealed a better correlation between CEMRA and DSA images in group 2 than in group 1. These data suggest that CEMRA could be a powerful tool for the non-invasive evaluation of atherosclerosis of neck vessels. Stenosis overestimation of CEMRA is confirmed; reduction of voxel size, decreasing the dephasing intravoxel effect, allows to minimize it, with a better correlation of CEMRA and DSA findings; yet, no diagnostic gain is obtained in the patients' classification according to NASCET criteria.",

Neff, A.K. Kilian, S. Meairs, A. Schwartz, C. D\u00fcber; Mannheim/DE Purpose: Correlation of unilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis grading based on Doppler-and Duplex ultrasonography and the hemodynamic changes in brain supplying arteries. Methods and materials: 72 patients with unilateral ICA stenosis at the level of the bifurcation between 50 % and 98 % and 15 age-matched normal controls were examined using a 2D cine phase-contrast MR technique. Blood volume flow was measured in both ICAs and the basilar artery (BA). The ultrasonography based grading of stenosis was compared to the changes in blood flow in the stenosed ICA and to the changes in the contralateral ICA and the BA. Results: ICA stenoses greater 70 % were hemodynamically relevant. With increasing stenosis, a decrease of blood volume flow in the ipsilateral ICA was determined with a high linear correlation of r = 0.86. Normal controls showed a blood volume flow in an ICA of 256.8 \u00b1 29.1 ml/min. In patients with 70 % stenosis a mean blood volume flow of 229.1 \u00b1 32.2 ml/min; with 80 % stenosis 165.1 \u00b1 52.3 ml/min and patients with 90 % stenosis a reduction of mean blood flow in the stenosed ICA to 80.4 \u00b1 25.1 ml/min. With decreasing blood flow in the stenotic ICA an increasing blood volume flow in the contralateral ICA was found. In patients with unilateral ICA stenosis greater than 85 % a significant increase in BA blood flow was documented.",

Serum and urine concentration and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. Ten normocholesterolemic rabbits were treated with daily intramuscular injection of fucan (5 animals) or saline (5 animals) after stent implantation in both iliac arteries. Fourteen days after injury animals were sacrified and histomorphometric analyses were performed. Blood samples were systematically collected. Results: Fucan exhibited high plasma levels and a prolonged half-life (7 h 30 min) compared to heparin (1 h) after intravenous and intramuscular administration. Fucan reduced intimal hyperplasia by approximately 60 % after stent implantation in rabbits (1.79 \u00b1 0.4 vs 0.73 \u00b1 0.2 mm 2 , p < 0.005). Intimal hyperplasia inhibited was associated with a better longitudinal organization of cells layers. No toxic effect was noted in treated animals. Blood samples showed no anticoagulant activity. Conclusion: Fucan, a natural polysaccharide of algal origin, reduces markedly intimal hyperplasia in a rabbit restenosis model without anticoagulant activity. Methods: Endovascular treatment was performed in 39 patients with 42 aneurysms presenting with an unruptured aneurysm either of the anterior (n = 31) or posterior circulation (n = 11). 8 patients had a previous SAH from another aneurysm and 10 had neurological symptoms due to the aneurysm. In 21 patients the aneurysm was an incidental finding. Aneurysm size was small in 18 (25 mm). Occlusion rates was divided into complete (100 %), subtotal (95 -99 %) and incomplete (< 95 %). Results: Endovascular treatment was technically feasable in 38/42 aneurysms. Complete or nearly complete occlusion was achieved in 34/38 aneurysms. In four aneurysms of the ICA only incomplete obliteration could be achieved. Procedural complications included one case of thrombembolic vessel occlusion with narrowing of the parent artery due to coil protrusion, resulting in anterior cerebral infarction. With the exception of one patient with a mild deficit, all had a good recovery according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale, resulting in a morbidity of 2.4 % and a mortality of 0 %. Conclusion: Endovascular treatment in patients with unruptured aneurysms is an effective alternative with low morbidity and mortality and should be considered the first option for treatment. ",

To investigate the potential of both CT techniques to identify calcified coronary lesions, we compared the results of EBCT and MSCT with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and histology. Methods: Five human autopsy coronary arteries were fixed in a saline perfused bath with vessel side branches and sutures defined as landmarks: a total of 81 vessel cross sections (VCS) were randomly assigned to undergo all 4 investigative steps. IVUS was performed with an automated pull back system (0.5 mm/s).

Methods and materials: 22 asymptomatic patients with known or suspected coronary heart disease were scanned on a multidetector CT system (Somatom Volume Zoom, Siemens) with retrospectively ECG-gated 4-slice spiral scanning. Data was acquired with a 4 \u00d7 2.5 mm collimation. Continuous volume data sets were reconstructed in the enddiastolic phase with 3 mm slice thickness. For each patient reconstructions without (3 mm non-incremental -ni) and with a 50 % overlap (1.5 mm incremental -i) were performed. Two observers independently performed calcium-scoring using the Agatston (AS)-and volume-score (VS) on two software systems, the Calcium-Scoring (Siemens) and the AccuImage-Scoring-System. Replicated Ca-scoring was performed by each observer. The data was categorized into score groups 0; 1 -10; 11 -100; 101 -400; > 400. Results: Intra-and interobserver reliability was 0.94 -1.0 for both scoring methods (AS i/ni and VS i/ni). When Ca-scoring measurements were repeated on different scoring software systems, the kappa statistics were found to be 0.75 for AS i, 0.69 for AS ni, 0.75 for VS i, and 0.75 for VS ni, resulting in different risk stratifications in up to 14 % of the patients. Conclusion: Intra-and interobserver agreement was excellent using the same software. The two different softwares do not yield the same calcium quantities. There were significant differences with regard to interobserver reliability, resulting in different risk stratifications. The interpretation of calcium quantities should acknowledge which type of software was used.",

Endothelium-dependent, flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and endothelium-independent, nitroglycerin-induced dilation (NMD) were assessed in the brachial artery using high-resolution ultrasound. In addition, FH patients were evaluated for coronary calcium using ECG triggered Multidetector CT. Results: FMD was significantly reduced in heterozygous FH patients compared to controls (10.7 \u00b1 5.3 % vs. 17.3 \u00b1 4.6 %; p = 0.002). In contrast, NMD values were similar in both study groups (17.7 \u00b1 6.5 % vs. 21.0 \u00b1 6.3 %; p = 0.22). On multiple stepwise regression analysis, a significant correlation was found between FMD and total cholesterol (r = \u22120.68; p = 0.0003) as well as between FMD and vessel size (r = \u22120.43; p = 0.01). Calcifications of the aortic root or the major epicardial coronary arteries were not detected. Conclusions: Endothelial dysfunction is present in the brachial artery of heterozygous FH already in the second and third decade of life without evidence of calcification of the aortic root and the coronary artery tree and is independently related to total cholesterol. Thus, altered vascular function precedes morphological evidence in the course of atherosclerosis. Therefore at this early age endothelial function testing seems to be more appropriate to evaluate FH patients developing atherosclerosis and to assess the short-term effects of therapeutic interventions.",

Witteman 2 , M.M.B. Breteler 2 , A. Hofman 2 , M. Oudkerk 1 ; 1 Groningen/NL, 2 Rotterdam/NL Purpose: Coronary calcification is associated with angiographically detected coronary artery disease. Cardiovascular risk factors are associated with cerebral white matter lesions (WML), which in turn play a role in cognitive decline. We investigated whether coronary calcification is associated with WML. Materials and methods: Participants were recruited from a population-based study of elderly patients aged 60 -90 years. During 1995 -96, cerebral MRI (1.5 T) scans of 554 subjects (response 63 %) were obtained on which the severity of deep subcortical WML (SCWML) and periventricular WML (PVWML) was estimated using a semi-quantitative scale. During 1998 -2000 thoracal electron-beam CT scans were obtained and coronary calcium scores (according to Agatston) are available for 221 of these subjects. WML was dichotomised in severe (upper quintile) versus mild to moderate (other quintiles) and the calcium score was dichotomised in severe (upper tertile) versus mild to moderate (other tertiles) for additional analyses. Results: Mean age was 72.3 years (50 % women). Mean severity of SCWML was 1.2 (range 0 -15.9) and of PVWML 2.2 (range 0 -9). Median calcium score was 125.3 (interquartile range 19.5 -501.4). Subjects with higher calcium scores had more SCWML (rho = 0.15, p = 0.02) and tended to have more PVWML (rho = 0.12, p = 0.08). When adjusted for age and sex, severe calcium scores were associated with the presence of severe SCWML (OR = 2.3, p = 0.05) but not with severe PVWML (OR = 1.8, p = 0.19).

Oudkerk 1 ; 1 Groningen/NL, 2 Rotterdam/NL Purpose: Coronary calcification is closely related to the amount of coronary atherosclerosis, but its predictive value for cardiovascular disease and mortality has not been well established. We studied the association between coronary calcification and mortality in the population-based Rotterdam Coronary Calcification Study. Materials and methods: From 1997 -2000, Rotterdam Study participants were invited for electron-beam CT scanning to detect coronary calcification. Calcifications were quantified according to Agatston's method. Calcium scores of 2013 scanned subjects (46 % men, mean age (standard deviation, SD), 71 (5.7) years) were used in the analyses. The rate ratios of mortality between categories of the calcium score were calculated. Results: 40 % of men had a calcium score above 500, while 24 % had a calcium score above 1000. Corresponding percentages for women were 17 and 4, respectively. During a mean follow-up period (SD) of 2.4 (0.7) years, 80 subjects died (51 men, 29 women). The age-adjusted relative risk for death was 3.6 (95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.4 -9.4) for men with a calcium score above 500 compared to men with a calcium score of 0 -100 (reference category). Men with a calcium score above 1000 had a 4.5 times increased risk (95 % CI, 1.7 -11.9) compared to the reference category. In women, the relative risks were 2.3 (95 % CI, 1.0 -5.6) for calcium scores above 500, and 2.8 (95 % CI, 0.9 -8.3) for calcium scores above 1000, compared to the reference category. Conclusion: The amount of coronary calcification detected by electron-beam CT is predictive for all-cause mortality. Methods and materials: 20 consecutive patients (11 men and 9 women; mean age 64 years) with surgically treated mitral valve disease underwent preoperative contrast-enhanced, retrospectively ECG-gated MDCT. Two readers assessed visibility of the mitral valve annulus, mitral valve leaflets, tendinous cords, and papillary muscles using a four-point grading scale. Abnormal findings of the mitral valve, such as thickening of the mitral valve leaflets, presence of mitral annulus calcification (MAC) and calcification of the valvular leaflets, were compared to preoperative echocardiography and intraoperative findings. Results: Visibility of mitral valve annulus and mitral valve leaflets were good or excellent (grade 2 and 3) in 15 patients (75 %), and in 19 patients (95 %) for papillary muscles; visibility of tendinous cords was inferior. MDCT yielded a 95 -100 % agreement with echocardiography and surgery with regard to thickening of mitral valve leaflets and presence of calcification of the mitral valve annulus and mitral valve leaflets. Conclusion: Retrospectively ECG-gated MDCT allows good to excellent visualization of anatomical details of the mitral valve and its apparatus except for tendinous cords, and demonstrates high agreement between echocardiography and surgery with regard to the diagnosis of mitral valve abnormalities. With increasing experience a diagnostic niche may open up for preoperative assessment of mitral valve pathology using MDCT, especially for patients for whom echocardiography is of limited use, e.g., for patients with suspected perivalvular abscess. Conventional parathyroidectomy is a difficult operation and unsuccessful in 5 % to 10 % of cases. To improve the efficacy, preoperative (MIBI) SPECT scintigraphy and intraoperative radio-guided localization of parathyroid adenomas with \u03b3 probe and a quick PTH assay were used. Methods: Forty patients with the diagnosis of primery hyperparathyroidism were studied with (MIBI) SPECT scintigraphy. We combined the preoperative administration with the intraoperative \u03b3 probe examination to identify the exact localization of parathyroid adenomas. The intact parathyroid hormone was measured by IRMA method (SCHERING CIS bio international). Results: In all cases parathyroidectomy was performed successfully and the preoperative localization was always confirmed. After five minutes parathyroidectomy PTH concentrations decreased more than 55 % compared with the highest preexcision value. At follow-up, serum calcium and PTH levels were normal in all patients.",

Della Chiesa; Busto Arsizio/IT Purpose: To assess whether three dimensional sonography (3D-US) can permit reliable and easily calculated volumes of the thyroid and nodules. Methods and materials: 24 patients, aged 33 -67, underwent 3D-US of the thyroid gland. Ten patients had prior hemithyroid resection for multinodular disease and presented with goitre relapse. After examination, all had surgical resection. The surgical specimen volume at pathology was compared with the volumes calculated using 3D-US. The remaining 14 patients had either single or multiple, cystic nodules. Following 3D-US, these nodules underwent percutaneous needle aspiration of the fluid content with measurement of the aspirated volume prior to ethanol injection. US examinations were performed using linear, 10 MHz probes (Voluson 530D and 730D, Kretztechnik, Austria). Volume acquisitions were automatically achieved by transverse scans, with the addition of coronal oscillations of the transducer crystals. Subsequently, both automatic [N = 9] and/or manual [N = 15] 3D reconstructions were performed, including volume calculations, for either the entire gland [N = 10] or the nodules [N = 14] . Results: Comparison between surgical specimen volumes and in-vivo volumes calculated by 3D-US demonstrated a restricted margin of error of 6 % for automatic reconstruction, and 4 % for manual reconstruction. The quantitative assessment of the fluid aspirated from cystic nodules was identical to the 3D-US calculation (margin of error < 1 %). Conclusions: 3D-US allows easy and accurate estimation of the volume of the thyroid gland and of nodular, cystic thyroid lesions. These measurements will undoubtedly provide both surgeons and interventional radiologists additional potentially useful information prior to procedures.",

All pts in the latter group underwent radioiodine therapy (RT) and CDS was performed 1, 3, 6 months after RT. 13 healthy subject were included as control group. Results: All 40 pts with hyperthyroidism showed an increase of TV, PV and PSV in ITA, compared with patients in remission and with control subjects. In pts within group 2, CDS values were lower, but not significantly different from those in group 1. PH was found in 40/51 pts, without a statistically significant difference between pts with hyperthyroidism and pts in remission. In pts within group 4, a significant decrease (p < 0.1) of TV and PSV mean values in ITA was observed in 11/15; the others pts, with residual signs of hyperthyroidism underwent further RT. Materials and methods: Forty two patients with 57 nodules were prospectively enrolled in this study. The nodules were studied in a transverse plane with conventional high frequency B-mode imaging and with sono-CT (ATL HDI 5000, L12-5 linear probe). The data were transferred on a PC (HDI Lab). After selecting two comparable images in both modes, three parameters of quantification were measured using region of interest: the difference of contrast between the nodule and the adjacent thyroid (dB), the slope of the transition between the nodule and the adjacent tissue (dB/cm). The nodule heterogeneity was evaluated as the standard deviation of the mean signal intensity normalized with the mean signal intensity (linear units).",

The average difference between the sono-CT slope and the conventional B-mode slope was 5.2 dB/cm. The heterogeneity index was superior in 83 % of cases with this modality. However, sono-CT imaging exhibited a blurring artifact when the probe was moved too fast, despite the use of a unique focal zone. Conclusion: The objective evaluation using appropriate quantification technique showed a significant improvement in the visibility of thyroid nodules with both sono-CT when compared to conventional B-mode imaging when the linear probe was moved very slowly. Pre-biopsy investigations included scintigraphy and thyroglobulin levels. Then we examined the US characteristics of the nodule (low reflectivity, irregular margins, thick-irregular halo, intranodular blood flow pattern, hypervascularity, invasion of vessels and adjacent structures, vessel encasement). In 25 patients the nodule was solitary and not palpable and in 20 patients the disease was multinodular with a nodule having characteristics suspicious for malignancy. We performed US guided FNA biopsy using 21 G needle. We used negative pressure on the syringe to obtain material through the needle. It is important to allow the pressure to equalize before removing the needle. The cytological specimen obtained was examined by cytopathologist.

Brughitta 2 , V. David 1 ; 1 Rome/IT, 2 Grottaferrata/IT Purpose: To differentiate with MR-cholangiography (MRCP) inflammatory papillitis from functional papillary stenosis, using a cholecystokinetic drug. Methods and materials: 17 patients with papillary stenosis diagnosed with ERCP underwent MRCP before and 30 minutes after i.v. injection of Ceruletide (Takus, Farmitalia, Italy) . This drug stimulates the activity of the gallbladder and promotes the relaxation of Oddi's sphincter. MRCP was performed by using 3-D non-breathholding, fat-suppressed Turbo SE sequence (TR: 3000 ms; TE: 700 ms; N.Ex.: 4; ETL: 128; Matrix: 128 \u00d7 256; Acq. time: 5 min 12 s) on coronal planes with 0.5 T superconductive magnet (Gyroscan T5 III, Philips Medical System). The 3D coronal images were post-processed with MIP algorithm. Results: In 13 patients MRCP diagnosed fibrotic papillary stenosis while in 4 patients detected functional papillary stenosis that in 3 cases was confirmed by ERCP with manometry. The diagnosis was based on the evaluation of the MBD calibre after drug administration: a partial reduction of the calibre is typical of functional papillary stenosis while the persistence of the same calibre allows the diagnosis of fibrotic papillary stenosis. MRCP could also exclude choledocholithiasis whose clinical symptoms can simulate papillary stenosis. Conclusions: It is possible to differentiate with MRCP between fibrotic and functional papillary stenosis, without performing invasive procedures like ERCP with manometry. This differential diagnosis is very important: in fact, fibrotic stenosis should be treated with sphinterectomy while functional papillary stenosis does not need any particular treatment. Methods and materials: 52 patients (25 women, 27 men) with confirmed PSC were examined with MRI at 1.5 T comprising: T1-weighted spoiled gradient echo (SGE), T2-weighted fat-suppressed turbo spin echo, HASTE, and serial postgadolinium T1-weighted SGE sequences without and with fat-suppression. Two radiologists reviewed retrospectively all images independently and in a consensus reading. The evaluations comprised: the imaging pattern of the liver parenchyma; the presence and grade of intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation; the presence of areas of parenchymal atrophy or abnormal signal and/or gadolinium enhancement. Results: A \"diffuse pattern\" of liver cirrhosis was observed in 17 of 52 patients (33 %). A \"large macronodular pattern\" (regenerative nodules \u2265 3 cm) was observed in 28 of 52 patients (54 %) with nodules showing low signal on T1-and T2-weighted images and low gadolinium enhancement. Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation was observed in 44 of 52 patients (85 %) with a \"general distribution\" in 18 patients (35 %) and a \"segmental distribution\" in 26 patients (50 %). Peripheral wedgeshaped areas of abnormal parenchyma showing atrophy were observed in 24 patients (46 %) and without atrophy in 18 patients (35 %). The signal intensity on T1-/T2-weighted images was usually low/high. Gadolinium enhancement was typically late in areas with atrophy and early in areas without atrophy. Conclusion: The spectrum of MRI appearances of PSC is diverse and comprises distinct patterns. Large regenerative nodules are a frequent finding and may help to establish the diagnosis. ",

The maximal diameter and length of pancreatic duct (ventral, dorsal, and main duct) and the angle between the main pancreatic duct (MPD) and the communicating channel (CC) were measured on ERCP. Morphologic changes of the pancreatic duct, the presence of santorinicele, the shape of CC, and associated bile duct anomaly were analyzed on ERCP and MRCP. Results: ERCP showed dominant dorsal duct and foreshortened ventral duct with a small communication between the two ducts. The mean caliber of dorsal, ventral, and main duct was 3.8 mm, 4.2 mm, and 4.2 mm, respectively. The angle between the MPD and the CC was acute in 3 patients, right angle in 2, and obtuse in 2. The CC was classified into short (n = 5) and long (n = 2) types. The morphologic features of pancreaticobiliary duct included: santorinicele in 2, beaded appearance of pancreatic duct in 5, pancreaticoliths in 3, and bile duct anomaly in 1. MRCP successfully demonstrated the presence of the CC and associated morphologic features of the pancreaticobiliary duct in all 6 patients. Purpose: Since evaluation of bile ducts in MRCP can be complicated by other fluid filled structures as pancreatic or bile duct cysts superimposing the region of interest and the clinical relevance of a dilated bile duct regarding functional stenosis may be unclear we investigated the hepatobiliary contrast medium Gd-BOPTA as a positive contrast enhancer for intra-and extrahepatic bile ducts in MRI. Material and methods: 34 patients were investigated on a 1.5 T scanner (Magnetom Vision, Siemens, Erlangen) using unenhanced T1 an T2 w breathhold sequences as well as 2D-and 3D-MRCP. To evaluate contrasted biliary structures 60 to 90 min after CM administration (Gd-BOPTA, 0.05 \u00b5mol/kg bodyweight) a 3D GRE sequence as well as T1w axial images were applied. Results: In the majority of the patients (28/30) bile duct structures could be delineated by the MRCP sequence. However the identification of the common bile duct in the region of the pancreatic head was not possible in 6 patients. In 7 patients following pancreatitis or cholelithiasis a dilatation of the common bile duct was observed with unclear functional relevance, in 4 patients following resection of the pancreatic head the anastomosis of the common bile duct could not be displayed in detail in MRCP. CE MRCP was able to delineate the bile duct in 8 of the 10 unclear cases, functional relevance of dilatation could be evaluated in 4 of 7 patients. Conclusion: In unclear cases Gd-BOPTA can be helpful for a better delineation and functional evaluation of bile duct structures.",

Results: MRT and MRCP were false positive in a patient with a benign stricture due to an inflammatory pseudotumor and false negative in two patients (suspected granulation tissue after prior surgery and contrast enhancement of the wall of the bile duct after interventional therapy). Except for one false negative patient MRCP revealed stenosis of central bile ducts in all patients. In 15 patients a well demarcated mass was seen while 12 patients revealed circumferential tumor spread along the bile ducts. Most lesions appeared hyperintense on T2-weighted images (n = 22) and hypointense on unenhanced T1-weighted images in all cases. Contrast enhancement was either lower (n = 21) or higher (n = 7) than normal liver parenchyma.

Materials and methods: MRCP MIP reconstructions (0.5 T Gyroscan NT) from 80 cases of biliary stricture had undergone estimation by three independent observers who performed linear measurements on MRCP images concerning morphology of the biliary stricture including stricture length, proximal ductal dillatation and distance from stricture to hepatic ducts junction. Last of the measurements has introduced information about stricture localisation along the biliary tree. Measurements were compared in two stages: between two observers as well as counting their mean values against third observer. The analysis included change, consistency and repeatability values with relative repeatability coefficient (RRC). Results: Repeatability counted with RRC presented values from 3.7 % to 12.12 %, consistency did not exceed 1.52 mm when stricture length or proximal biliary dilatation were measured and 2.5 mm when stricture was localised along biliary duct. Conclusion: MRCP MIP reconstructions are valuable and easily understood images in radiologists' every day practice when morphology and localisation of biliary stricture is discussed. The most reliable conditions seem to be stricture length and stricture localisation.",

Saussine sr.; Strasbourg/FR Purpose: Assess the usefulness of translabial perineal ultrasonography (TPUS) in the evaluation of the two mechanisms (Hypermobility of Bladder Neck and Intrinsic Sphincter Deficiency) of Urinary Stress Incontinence (USI). Method/materials: 52 women (mean age: 58.7) underwent US with translabial perineal approach (7.5 MHz transvaginal probe) located on the perineal floor, behind urethral meatus. Examinations performed in sagittal and coronal, in decubitus and standing positions, at rest, and during pelvic floor contraction and straining. Bladder was filled with 200 -300 ml of urine. Morphology of the bladder neck (funneled) was evaluated to diagnose ISD. To evaluate HBN, position and displacements of bladder neck was evaluated calculating the distance using inferior border of the symphysis pubis as reference according an orthogonal system, in sagittal plane. The diagnosis of HBN was based on a displacement up to 1.5 cm. Correlation was made with clinical evaluation and urodynamic testing results. Results: Among 35 patients with the clinical diagnosis of HBN, TPUS confirmed a displacement and depicted in 8 cases an additional ISD in front of funneling of bladder neck at rest and straining. Among 17 patients with diagnosis of ISD; US confirmed an abnormal bladder neck. An association with bladder neck hypermobility was found in 10 cases of this group. For the diagnosis of cystocele (20 cases), correlations were excellent, but without additional findings for TPUS. Conclusions: TPUS is easy to perform and no time consuming. It provides a perfect assessment of bladder neck during static and dynamic studies. It allows the diagnosis of associated mixed types of USI with a better classification of these disorders.",

The difference between the accuracy rate achieved with FSE T2-weighted images, and those obtained with the other two MR sequences was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The high negative predictive value (95 %) for the exclusion of parametrial tumour invasion was the principal contributor to the staging accuracy obtained with FSE T2-weighted imaging. Conclusion: Unenhanced FSE T2-weighted imaging is a reliable method in determining the degree of tumour invasion in patients with early stage cervical cancer. Our data suggest that contrast-enhanced sequences, even with the use of fat suppression technique, have a limited value in the assessment of tumour extension. Methods and materials: MRI of the pelvis was performed 24 h after i.v infusion of USPIO (2.6 mg Fe/kg b.w.) in 9 patients (mean age 48 years) with gynecologic tumours (6 cervical, 2 endometrial carcinomas, 1 malignant mixed mullerian tumour) who were scheduled for surgery. Axial T1w SE, T2w FSE (FatSat), FSPGR, sagittal and oblique T2w FSE sequences were acquired on a 1.5 T system. Next to the primary tumour, lymph nodes were staged prospectively using newly established criteria and results correlated with histology. Results: MRI correctly diagnosed the primary tumour as stage I in 7 cases and stage II in 1 case respectively. In 1 case preoperative diagnosis of stage IV led to a change in the therapeutic approach and chemotherapy was given. In this case, multiple malignant iliac nodes were demonstrated. No surgical proof was available. 58/62 of the lymph nodes detected on MRI, in which a histological correlation was available, were correctly staged (accuracy 94 %). 1 node was false positive; 3 micrometastasis < 5 mm were missed.

The aim of this study was to compare the prognostic significance of the histological diagnosis (UIP vs NSIP) and CT findings. Materials and methods: 53 biopsy proven cases of UIP and NSIP were diagnosed by consensus by two histopathologists. The HRCTs were scored semiquantitatively by 4 observers with regard to the proportion of ground glass opacity to reticulation (1 = predominantly ground glass, 2 = mixed ground glass and reticulation, 3 = predominantly reticulation). In addition the exact proportion of ground glass opacity was recorded. Results: 32/53 cases were classified as UIP and of the 21/53 classified as NSIP 5/21 were cellular and 16/21 fibrotic. At follow up (median 33 months) there were 22/53 deaths. Both an increasing extent of ground glass opacity and a lower semiquantitative CT score were associated with a better outcome (p = 0.02, p = 0.01 respectively). The histological diagnosis of NSIP was also associated with lower mortality (p = 0.05). On bivariate analysis HRCT provided the more powerful prognostic information. Conclusion: In terms of prognosis HRCT features in IPF provide much information with little added value from the histological diagnosis.",

The diagnosis was established by clinical presentation (cough, dyspnoea, hemoptysis and/or fever associated with significant hematuria or progressive renal failure), ANCA titers (11 c-ANCA, 5 p-ANCA, 1 ANCA negative) and renal biopsy in all patients. Results: Pulmonary involvement defined by pathological CT occured in all patients. Nodules with (n = 4) or without (n = 2) cavitation, ground glass opacity (n = 5), air space consolidation with (n = 6) or without (n = 9) cavitation and interstitial septal thickening (n = 4) were detected. Local interstitial infiltration and nodules in WGs, diffuse interstitial alveolar infiltration in MPA and CSS, neither lower versus upper lungfield involvement nor side preverence were evident. Radiological course of pulmonary involvement was the best indicator for therapeutic success after immunosuppression, occured earlier compared to renal symptoms and was a stronger indicator in first manifestations then in relapses for disease activity. Conclusion: Thin section CT as the most sensitive radiological examination detects and classifies efficiently the extent of pulmonary involvement of SVV, most likely air space consolidation and ground glass opacity, it proves to be the most efficient therapeutic monitor indicating remission.",

Two radiologists assessed with consensus whether traction bronchioloectasis was present or not, and its incidence at three levels (aortic arch, carina, and between carina and diaphragm). The degree of traction bronchioloectasis was classified as follows: Score 1: 1 -5 traction bronchioloectasis were visible at each scan level; Score 2: 5 -10 traction bronchioloectasis; Score 3: Over 10 traction bronchioloectasis. The total score was the sum of three level score. Result: All patients showed traction bronchioloectasis. The degree of traction bronchioloectasis decreased with increase of nodule size; p type 6.8; q type 4; r type 2.3.

Colombo 3 ; 1 Cotignola/IT, 2 Mirano/IT, 3 Milan/IT Background: Distal embolization of debris during percutaneous carotid artery stenting may result in neurological deficit. Methods/results: 320 consecutive procedures (308 patients) of elective carotid stent implantation with cerebral protection performed in 3 different centers were included in a prospective registry. Cerebral protection was performed using filter devices (80.6 % of procedures), occlusive distal balloons (17.2 %), and endoluminal clamping of the common and external carotid artery (2.2 %). All lesions were > 70 % diameter stenoses (mean 82 \u00b1 8 %). Mean age of the patients was 67 \u00b1 11 years, 83 % were males, and 58.7 % of patients had had a previous stroke or transient ischemic attack. In 313 procedures (97.8 %) it was possible to position a protection device. In 9 of 55 procedures using distal balloon protection, this was not tolerated by the patient (2.8 %). In 317 procedures (99.1 %) a stent was successfully placed. Neurological complications during the procedure, in-hospital and during 30 days of follow-up, occurred in 6 patients (1.9 %). These were 1 major stroke (0.3 %; amaurosis of ipsilateral eye), 3 minor strokes (0.9 %), and 2 transient ischemic attacks (0.6 %). Protection device related complications, all without neurological symptoms, occurred in 8 procedures (2.4 %). These were 7 distal dissections (3 required additional stents and 1 lead to occlusion of the internal carotid artery) and 1 filter entrapment requiring surgical removal. Major adverse cardiac events during the 30 days of follow-up occurred in 2 patients (0.6 %). Conclusions: Routine use of cerebral protection during carotid artery stenting appears feasible. In this study the incidence of neurological complications was low.",

They were all located in the vascular territory of the aneurysm and have to be seen as intervention-related. None of the patients had clinical symptoms. Occurance of thromboembolic events did not correlate with the number of coils used. Conclusion: Regarding the frequency of thromboembolic events, even though they are mostly silent, DWI monitoring should follow intervention. We assume that the thrombembolic lesions are due to embolic fragments that migrate from the aneurysm as well as due to ischemic events of other origin (vasospasm, arteriosclerosis). Therefore we think that in the endovascular treatment of asymptomatic aneurysms systemic anticoagulation should be performed. Purpose: For most of the pregnant women who underwent an obstetric flow study using color doppler imaging, we calculated low velocity values from the foetal middle cerebral artery in comparison to literature. The aim of this study was two-fold: to define the normal flow values of the foetal and maternal arterial systems and to compare the results with the literature. Methods and materials: 124 healthy pregnant women of various gestational age who underwent a color doppler examination were studied after having an uncomplicated pregnancy and labour. Pulsatility index (PI), resistance index (RI), peak systolic/end diastolic ratio (S/D ratio) values were calculated for the foetal aorta (fA), foetal middle cerebral artery (fMCA), umblical artery on the maternal (mUA) and foetal (fUA) side and the maternal uterine artery (UTA). The results were compared with the published literature. Results: 20 to forty week pregnancies were divided into 10 different groups, each group represented a period of 2 weeks of gestational age. For each group, the studied parameters were defined and presented in a diagram. Flowmetric values are helpful in defining the existing or potential abnormalities in the foetus. The published literature was used to compare patient flowmetric study results. In our study, we found significant differences for fMCA and UA values compared with the published data. To study the relationship of uterine artery impedance measured as pulsatility index (PI) and resistance index (RI) on the outcome of in vitro fertilization -embryo transfer cycles. Methods: 55 women in the age group between 25 -42 a were studied on the day of embryo transfer by performing tranvaginal color Doppler sonography. Uterine artery pulsatiliy index, resistance index and endometrial thickness were calculated. Subsequently pregnancy rates were calculated. Results: The pregnancy rate was 35 % in patients with a pulsatility index 2.45 \u00b1 0.54 and resistance index 0.85 \u00b1 0.04. In patients with a pulsatility index higher than 3.00 and resistance index higher than 0.91 the pregnancy rate decreased significantly to 15 %.

This further developed method allowed statements about the quantification of blood flow and volume by varying the time delay between doppler imaging sequences to be made. Besides other vascularisation parameters like time of arrival, slope of the curve, maximum and plateau phase of the colour pixel density (PCD) and mean colour value were measured. Five mice were treated with a VEGF-receptor antibody during the examination period. Results: While without contrast agent nearly no blood flow was visible, the tumours showed clearly visible enhancment of doppler signal after injection of Levovist. Tumours without therapy showed an increase in PCD signals during the tumourgrowing phase. Mice with antiangiogenic treatment showed a signal decrease in the first monitoring examination, even in growing tumours. There was a limitation of doppler signals to the periphery of the HaCaT-ras-tumours whilst untreated tumours showed a homogenous enhancement except in necrotic areas that were found in later phases. Conclusion: Contrast enhanced sonography enables vascularisation measurements of HaCaT-ras-tumours and the monitoring of antiangiogenic therapy. Therapeutic effects could be visualized before a macroscopic change of tumour size was observed. Furthermore intermittent doppler sonography enables objective perfusion parameters in ultrasound. ",

The criteria for visualization of VA origin was identification of origin of an artery arising from the subclavian artery and entering the transverse foramen at the C6 level. Angle-corrected peak systolic velocity (PSV), end diastolic velocity (EDV), and resistive index (RI) were determined. Angiography was available for comparison in 40 VAs of 20 subjects. Results: Two aplastic right VAs of 2 subjects were excluded. The VA origin was visualized in 241 (99.6 %) of 242 VAs (120 right and 121 left VAs) with the endovaginal transducer and 161 (66.5 %) of 242 VAs (97 right and 64 left VAs) with the linear transducer.

Material and methods: A newly designed internally cooled RF probe (\u2205 3 mm) was used. Both electrodes were 18 mm in length, the inserted insulator between both electrodes was 8 mm in length. For cooling, distilled water was used at flow rates between 40 and 130 ml/min and the power was between 40 and 70 W. Three patients with a liver metastases were treated under local anesthesia. In vitro studies were done to compare electrodes with an active tip with electrodes with a nonactive tip. During MR measurements the RF generator was switched off. Results: MRI allowed a reliable visualization of the electrodes and the insulator in between. The experiments documented that a RF power of 40 W with an irrigation rate of 40 ml/min results in the largest possible area of coagulative necrosis with a diameter of 34 mm \u00d7 46 mm. The treatment of the patients was performed without any complications. The advantage of the active tip is that subcapsular lesions can also be treated using this bipolar RF technique with the active tip as the distal electrode. Conclusion: MR-guided RFITT using a internally cooled, irrigated bipolar RF electrode results in a coagulative necrosis which is comparable to those of MR-guided laser induced thermotherapy (LITT) . With the active tip as the distal electrode subcapsular lesions can also be treated with the bipolar system. To determine the value of multiplanar and 3D post-processing techniques for guidance of the ablative probe to an optimal position before radiofrequency treatment of liver lesions. Methods and materials: 21 patients with malignant hepatic tumors (HCC n = 6, Metastases n = 15) underwent radiofrequency ablation. Following conventional CTguided (Siemens Volume Zoom\u00a9, Biopsy Mode) positioning of the ablative device, its position was re-evaluated using multiplanar (MPR) and volume rendering 3Dreformations. The position of the ablative device was characterized qualitatively based on the following scale: Central -probe is localized within the central 20 % of the tumor; marginal -probe is lateralized towards the periphery of the tumor; outside -probe-position outside of the tumor. Suboptimal positioning was corrected following initial ablative therapy to assure complete ablation of the tumor and imaging was repeated. Results: Multiplanar and 3D renderings proved superior over imaging in the axial plane in determining the position of an ablative device within liver tumors (p = 0.008). In 9 out of 21 patients the probe position was considered to be central on axial images whereas multiplanar and 3D renderings only revealed marginal probe localisation. Axial, multiplanar and 3D renderings yielded identical results in the remaining 12 patients. Comparing multiplanar and 3D reformative techniques, no significant difference was shown in determining the ablative device position. Conclusion: MPR and 3D renderings aid in optimising the probe position for ablative therapy in a substantial number of patients. As a correct probe position is crucial for the success of an ablation procedure, these viewing techniques should be implemented without delay.",

            "text": "Clinical diagnosis was always underestimated at initial presentation. Imaging modalities were requested for cerebral ischemic attack (2/3), cephalalgia, photophobia and tinnitus (1/3). Initial imaging diagnosis was delayed (> 3 days) in all cases, as patients were referred for brain evaluation and carotid artery disease. Follow up clinical and imaging examination demonstrated: a death (N = 1) serious brain damage (N = 1), complete recovery after antiobiotherapy and anticoagulotherapy (N = 1). Conclusion: Delayed diagnosis of septic thrombosis of the lateral sinus is probably related to its non-specific clinical symptoms. Therefore, in patients with an history of diabetes immunodepression or of infection of the face or of the temporal bone, a careful examination of the skull base should be performed to determine the permability of the brain venous sinuses, the status of the mastoid cell pneumatization of the temporal and occipital bones and the normality of the related fatty spaces. Objective: Conventional or digital 2D dacrocystography and CT dacocystography is usually carried out after the catheterization of a lacrimal canaliculus. We tried to evaluate the quality of opacification on CT scans after simple instillation of contrast medium, without any catheterization. Patients and methods: 39 patients (78 nasolacrimal ducts) were explored for lacrimal pathways obstruction by CT scans after instillation of diluted water soluble contrast medium instillation. A complementary CT acquisition after catheterization was performed when the first ones did not show any opacification. Results: CT dacrocystography after instillation is a well tolerated and safe technique. In our study, it allowed detection all pathologic lacrimal canals; 7 normal lacrimal pathways (after catheterization) were not opacified after instillation (false positives). The sensitivity of the method was 100 %, its specificity 84 %. Conclusion: CT dacrocystography after ocular instillation is an easy, physiologic and sensitive method to evaluate lacrimal obstruction. We propose it as the first step test, the catheterization being used only when there is total absence of opacification after instillation. Results: Inflamatory causes are responsIble of lacrimal duct obstruction. We found no post-traumatic lesions, dacryolithiasis or nasolacrimal neoplasms. DCG evaluated lacrimal ducts and the nasal meatus. DCT was performed only in patients with simple intubation or endoscopic dacryocystorinostomy to exclude all postsurgical complications of the surrounding nasolacrimal duct tissues or an inflammatory process of paranasal sinuses. Discussion and conclusion: DCG and DCT have almost the same sensitivity and specificity in a morphological study of nasolacrimal ducts. Crystallin dosage is 0.04 to 0.2 mSv in DCG and 1.8 to 2.6 mSv in DCT. DCT with 3D reconstruction gives good spatial and anatomic details (orbital, etmoidal and nasal bone). DCG is always the gold standard in the imaging of the lacrimal ducts, but we propose DCT to check possible post-surgical complications. Purpose: POAG is an ocular disease based on a progressive optic neuropathy, visual-field defects and elevated intraocular pressure. Our purpose was to compare with Color Doppler the blood flow of the main orbital arteries of normal, atherosclerotic and glaucomatous subjects. Methods and materials: We evaluated with Color Doppler (ATL HDI 5000) the blood flow of Ophthalmic Artery (OA), Central Retinal Artery (CRA), nasal and temporal Short Posterior Ciliary Artery (SPCA). Peak systolic velocity, end diastolic velocity and Resistive Index (RI) of each artery were considered. We examined 3 group of patients: 30 normal subjects (group A), 30 patients (> 50 years) with positive risk factors for atherosclerosis (smoking, hypertension) (group B) and 30 patients affected by POAG (group C). Inclusion criteria in group C were: IOP > 21 mmHg, visus > 5/10, pseudoexfoliatio presence. Results: All the arteries of group B showed higher RI than group A, with low end diastolic velocities. SPCA (0.87 \u00b1 3.3) and CRA (0.85 \u00b1 2.6) of group C showed significantly higher RI than group A, but no significant RI differences were found in OA of group C (0.76 \u00b1 4.2) and group A (0.77 \u00b1 2.7). Conclusion: Normal, atherosclerotic and glaucomatous subjects can be distinguished by Color Doppler evaluation of the blood flow of the main orbital arteries. Orbital Color Doppler can be useful in the diagnosis of POAG and in the monitoring of these patients.",

Balazs, E.V. Nagy; Debrecen/HU Purpose: To find the most accurate, easy-to-measure parameter that can be used as a substitute for extraocular muscle volume assessment in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy. Subjects and methods: 70 orbits of 35 patients were examined in a conventional 1 T MR scanner and the rectus muscles evaluated. The diameter at the largest extent of the muscle belly, as well as the long and the short diameters and the cross sectional areas in a preselected coronal scan were measured for each muscle and compared with the corresponding muscle volume measured on contiguous T1w transverse slices. Results: The measured coronal area correlated well with the volume of the superior (r = 0.694) and inferior (r = 0.783) recti. The largest transverse diameter showed strong correlation with the volume of the lateral (r = 0.868) and medial (r = 0.869) recti. For the latter muscle, the coronal area also exhibited a high correlation with the volume (r = 0.838). Coronal cross-sectional areas can be well estimated by measuring both the short and long coronal muscle diameters (r values were between 0.914 and 0.966). p was less than 0.0001 for every above mentioned correlations. Conclusions: In Graves' ophthalmopathy, the volume of three of the rectus muscles seems to be well estimated by measuring their cross sectional area on a single coronal slice, while the largest transverse diameter of the lateral rectus is suitable for the same purpose. Purpose: A prospective study was performed to determine the accuracy of unenhanced, enhanced and early delayed (15') enhanced CT densitometry in differentiating adenomas from non adenomas and to evaluate the usefulness of absolute and relative percentage of washout. Methods and materials: 37 oncology patients with 44 undetermined adrenal masses were all studied by unenhanced, enhanced and 15 minutes delayed enhanced helical CT scans. Attenuation values of all adrenal masses on each type of scan was measured by mean of a region of interest and then used to calculate absolute and relative percentage wash-out. Proof of diagnosis was CT and/or MR follow-up (6 -36 months) in 31 patients; percutaneous CT guided biopsy in 5 patients; surgery in 1 patient. Results: On unenhanced CT scans, with attenuation threshold of 18 HU, specificity and sensitivity for the diagnosis of adenoma were 100 % and 93 % respectively. On 15 minutes delayed CT scans, with an attenuation threshold of 38 HU, specificity and sensitivity for the diagnosis of adenoma were 100 % and 90 % respectively. Moreover, all adrenal masses were correctly characterised as benign or malignant on delayed scans with a relative percentage washout of 35 % and an absolute percentage washout threshold of 50 %. Conclusion: Unenhanced and early delayed enhanced CT attenuation values can characterise an adrenal mass as a benign adenoma with high specificity and acceptable sensitivity. The percentage change in washout of contrast media can be a useful adjunct to absolute CT attenuation values in differentiation of adrenal adenomas and nonadenomas.",

Szolar 1 ; 1 Graz/AT, 2 Ann Arbor, MI/US Purpose: To measure the changes in washout of contrast material on contrast medium-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) scans in patients with adrenocortical carcinomas and pheochromocytomas. Materials and methods: Fifteen patients with proven adrenocortical carcinomas and 17 patients with pheochromocytomas underwent helical CT. Unenhanced CT was followed by enhanced CT at 60 seconds and 10 minutes. 121 adrenal masses (74 adenomas and 47 metastases, respectively) in 108 patients served as reference data. Results: The adrenocortical carcinomas and pheochromocytomas enhanced significantly lesser than the adenomas at 60 seconds (P < 0.001). At 10 minutes, both the absolute and relative percentage loss of enhancement were significantly greater for the adenomas than for the adrenocortical carcinomas and pheochromocytomas (P < 0.001), respectively. Delayed-enhanced CT at 10 minutes (sensitivity, 92 %; specificity, 95 %) was more accurate for differentiation of adenomas and adrenocortical carcinomas and pheochromocytomas than unenhanced CT (sensitivity, 82 %; specificity, 95 %) Conclusion: Adrenocortical carcinomas and pheochromocytomas exhibit similar wash-out than do adrenal metastases, but significantly lesser than do adrenal adenomas.

            "text": "Incidence of malignancy in complex cystic renal masses (Bosniak category III): Should biopsy precede surgery? M.G. Harisinghani, K. Jhaveri, D.A. Gervais, P.F. Hahn, J. Varghese, P.R. Mueller; Boston, MA/US Purpose: We sought to determine the incidence of malignancy and to assess a possible role for image guided biopsy of this category of renal masses Materials & methods: Of the 397 renal biopsies performed at our institution between 1991 and 2000; a total of 28 patients with 28 category III lesions, were identified for analysis. There were 18 men and 10 women with age range from 40 to 70. The incidence of malignancy, based on surgical pathology or imaging follow up, and percentage of lesions proceeding to surgery, among these 28 lesions, was determined. The surgical results were correlated to the biopsy findings Results: Of the 28 biopsied category III lesions, 17 were malignant (16 renal cell carcinoma, 1 lymphoma) and 11 were benign (4 hemorrhagic cyst, 1 oncocytoma, 3 inflammatory cysts, 2 adenomas, 1 focal glomerulosclerosis). Seventeen of the 28 (60.7 %) lesions (16 renal cell carcinoma, 1 inflammatory cyst) had surgical resection following the biopsy. All lesions proceeding to surgery had pathological diagnosis identical to the pecutaneous image guided biopsy results. Non-surgical patients had radiological follow up for minimum 1 year Conclusion: The incidence of malignancy in Bosniak category III is 60.7 % (95 % confidence interval). Presurgical renal biopsy and radiological follow up is useful in identifying non-malignant lesions in this category, thus avoiding unnecessary surgery in up to 39 % of patients Method and materials: Prospective analysis of 25 patients with histopathologicaly proved RCC included enhanced MDCT studies in arterial and corticomedullary phase (detector configuration: 4 \u00d7 1 mm, RT 0.5). We compared 3 reconstruction protocols (slice width/reconstruction interval: 1.25/0.7 mm, 3/1.5 mm, 5/2.5 mm). In addition, multiplanar reconstructions (MPR) in 5, 3 and 1.25 mm coronal planes were assessed. Finally, low-dose CT urography (delay 10 min) with MPR reconstructions was performed in the excretory phase. Image data of all reconstructions were analysed for the size of the lesion, TNM staging, morphological, and enhancement characteristics by two radiologists. Histopathological data were used to determine the efficacy of the different CT reconstruction protocols. Results: Different reconstruction protocols (5, 3 and 1.25 mm) have no influence on the evaluation of tumour size and T-staging. However, assessment of lymph node size was improved in 12 % of the patients by using thinner slice width and 1.25 mm MPR reconstruction. Vertical tumour size and V. cava infiltration was more precisely assessed by evaluation of MPR-than axial reconstructions. In all patients CT-urography demonstrated sufficient opacification of the collecting system. Conclusion: Axial reconstruction protocols are equally suited for the T-staging of RCC. A MDCT protocol using additionally 1.25 mm MPR reconstructions and lowdose CT urography appears effective as a \"one-stop\" protocol for a proper staging of RCC and eliminates further investigations such as IV urography.",

Frauscher; Innsbruck/AT Purpose: We assessed the value of a microbubble based ultrasound (US) contrast agent for blood vessel enhancement in colour Doppler imaging (CDI) of small renal masses. Methods and materials: 51 patients with \"indeterminate\" small renal masses (< 3 cm in diameter) underwent prospective CDI before and after intravenous administration of the contrast agent Levovist\u00ae (Schering AG, Berlin, Germany). The degree of tumour vascularity was subjectively graded from 0 to IV (indicating an increasing vessel count) and the peak systolic velocity (PSV) was measured. CDI findings were compared with those obtained at histopathological examination. Results: Intra-and/or peri-tumour vessels were detected in 26 lesions (51 %) by unenhanced CDI and in 48 lesions (94 %) by enhanced CDI. The detection of vascularity was increased by contrast administration (p = 0.006, McNemar test). Higher grades of tumour vascularity (grade III and IV) were found more often in malignant renal masses (p < 0.01). PSVs higher than 80 cm/s were found only in malignant lesions. Based upon receiver operating characteristic analysis, enhanced CDI (Az = 0.789) is more accurate than unenhanced CDI (Az = 0.576) for differentiating benign from malignant renal masses (p < 0.004). Conclusions: Enhanced CDI is superior to unenhanced CDI in the detection of tumour vascularity, and in the discrimination between benign and malignant small renal masses.",

H\u00e9l\u00e9non 1 ; 1 Paris/FR, 2 Nancy/FR Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of contrast-enhanced sonography of renal masses using a FSO69 (Optison\u00ae, Mallinckrodt, USA), with quantification of the signal intensity. Materials and methods: 24 renal masses were studied with pulse inversion imaging (PII) at baseline and following a bolus injection of FSO69 (1, 2, 3 and 4 ml, randomised dose, 6 patients per dosage group, ATL HDI5000, C5-2 probe). Cineloops were transferred to a PC for quantification with HDI Lab. The cortical and solid mass enhancement was calculated as the difference between the signal intensity of a region of interest located upon the normal cortex and the mass before and after injection (dB). The final diagnosis was obtained by CT, MRI and/or surgery (adenocarcinomas 16, complex cysts 5; hamartomas 3). Results: Cortical enhancement was correlated with the dose (r = 0.98) and was consistently greater when the mechanical index was lower than 0.4. The detection of normal and atypical cysts was improved and was correlated with CT and MRI features. Renal mass delineation was improved except when the enhanced mass signals matched with the normal surrounding cortex (2 cases). The visibility of the necrosis within the lesion was comparable to the CT and MR appearance. The peak enhancement was: 9.6 dB \u00b1 4.0 dB for the cancers, 5.8 dB \u00b1 3.5 dB for the hamartomas and 0.8 dB \u00b1 0.5 dB for the complex renal cysts. Conclusion: PII of renal masses following FSO69 injection improved the detection and the characterization of renal masses, particularly in small tumours and complex cysts.

Purpose: Aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of gadobutrol as contrast agent for diagnostic chest and abdominal CT compared to iodinated contrast media in a porcine animal model. Methods: In 7 pigs spiral CTs of the chest and abdomen were performed using 2 ml/kg BW gadobutrol (Gadovist, Schering, Germany) given by single intravenous injection (Siemens Somatom Plus 4; slice: 5 mm, table feed: 7.5 mm, reconstruction increment: 5 mm). One week later the same animals were examined under the same protocol using iopromide (Ultravist 300; Schering, Germany; 2 ml/kg BW). In 3 additional animals serial CTs were performed using gadobutrol on day 1 and iopromide on day 7 to detect contrast media kinetics, peak enhancement and time enhancement-product in important vascular regions and parenchymal organs. Peak enhancement (net increase compared with native baselines) were measured in Houndsfield units (HU) in defined Regions of interest. Additionally, diagnostic quality and accuracy of the CTs were evaluated on a two-step scale by three independent blinded investigators. Results: In vivo, the mean peak enhancement 0, 5, 10, 30, 60 and 120 seconds in the abdominal aorta after injection of 2 ml/kg BW gadobutrol and iopromide was 40, 200, 224, 261, 118, 95 HU and 41, 232, 298, 152, 143 , 123 HU respectively. All CTs using gadobutrol were classified as diagnostic with excellent differentiation of vascular and parenchymal structures. Conclusion: Computed tomography with 1 mol gadobutrol resulted in an excellent contrast peak enhancement. Computed tomography using gadobutrol is feasible and a possible alternative to iodinated contrast material.",

Although neural networks have been applied in various areas of medical research, they have not been previously applied to the prediction of adverse events to contrast media. Materials and methods: ANNs (provided by Semeion Research Centre, Rome, Italy) were used to predict adverse events occurring in over 600 patients receiving Iomeprol 300 (300 mg I/ml) within a large observational clinical study performed by Bracco-Byk Gulden in 6 German radiological centres. The database consisted of 76 independent variables obtained from the case report forms.

Lauenstein 1 , F.M. Vogt 1 , C. Corot 2 , J.F. Debatin 1 , S.G. R\u00fchm 1 ; 1 Essen/DE, 2 Aulnay-sous-Bois/FR Purpose: To evaluate a new USPIO compound 7228, compared to Sinerem\u00ae (both Guerbet, France) as a marker of macrophage activity in atherosclerotic plaques. Materials and methods: Experiments were conducted on 4 heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits aged 4 -6 months. Imaging was performed on a whole body scanner using the transmit/receive head coil. After initial 3D MR angiography of the thoracic aorta with conventional paramagnetic contrast agent (Gd-DOTA), animals were injected once with either 7228 (n = 2) or Sinerem\u00ae (n = 2) at equal doses. 3D MR angiography was repeated daily over 5 days. On day 6 the rabbits were euthanized for histopathologic evaluation of the aorta. Results: 3D MRAs with Gd-DOTA revealed no abnormal findings in any of the animals (n = 4). Luminal signal intensity at different days was comparable between both compounds with no significant differences regarding the time-evolution of T2* effects. Susceptibility effects within the aortic wall became evident on day 2 in both groups reaching the maximum after 4 days. These changes were more pronounced in the 7228 group without amounting to a statistical significance. Histopathology proved slightly increased Fe uptake in macrophages of atherosclerotic plaques of the two rabbits injected with 7228 compared to those who received Sinerem\u00ae. Conclusion: Both USPIO agents cause susceptibility effects within atherosclerotic plaques detectable by 3D GRE sequences. Since phagocytosis of 7228 seems to be superior to Sinerem\u00ae it can be assumed that lower doses of this compound are suited to allow better visualization of active plaque in atherosclerotic disease.",

A 3-month clinical follow-up was obtained in all patients who were not anticoagulated. Results: For a longer mean z-axis coverage (Group 1: 152 mm; Group 2: 110 mm; p < 0.001), the mean duration of data acquisition was shorter with MSCT (Group 1: 17 s; Group 2: 21 s; p < 0.0001).

The benefits of MSCT were more marked for patients with underlying respiratory disease and did not lead to a higher detection rate of peripheral PE.

We evaluated two groups of 25 consecutive patients, for whom identical scan parameters (3 mm collimation, 5 mm feed, 2 mm increment) and contrast injection protocols were used (140 ml, 3 ml/s, 20 s start delay). We measured the enhancement of the pulmonary artery in an ROI at the level of the pulmonary trunk. For the enhancement of small arteries, we measured the maximum CT number in peripheral pulmonary arteries at the level of the aortic arch and at the lung bases. We determined the percentage of segmental and subsegmental arteries with sufficient quality for PE evaluation. To test the influence of observer experience on the accuracy of CT venography (CTV) for diagnosis of acute deep thrombosis (DVT) and to identify potential sources of misinterpretation. Methods and materials: 64 patients with clinical suspect of pulmonary embolism (PE) underwent combined CT pulmonary angiography and CTV, using a multislice CT scanner. CTV was performed in the caudo-cranial direction, 3 minutes after administration of 140 ml of contrast material (300 mg I/ml). Scan parameters were: 4 \u00d7 2.5 mm collimation, 5 mm slice width, and 5 mm reconstruction increment. CTVs were analyzed independently and in a blinded fashion for the presence of acute DVT by three readers: (a) an experienced radiologist in body CT, but without experience with CT imaging of PE; (b) a fellow in CT; (c) a third-year resident without any formal experience with CT imaging of PE. CT scans were scored on a 4-point confidence scale and different causes of interpretation errors were analyzed. The gold standard was lower extremity sonography. Results: Interobserver agreement was moderately good (k = 0.60; 95 % confidence interval), whereas interobserver disagreement occurred in 5 (9 %) cases. The two observers with CT experience were more accurate than the less experienced one (p < 0.02) who made a higher number of false-positive diagnoses. The most frequent causes of misinterpretation were chronic thrombosis and arterial thrombosis. No clear differences were found among the 3 readers for the error type. Conclusion: CTV in addition to CTPA is a relatively accurate method for evaluation of DVT. CT diagnosis of acute DVT improves with general CT experience. Conclusions: A pre-therapeutic HR-CT should always be done before medical treatment by epoprostenol. If poorly defined nodular opacities, septal lines, pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, and adenopathies are found, the pre-therapeutic strategy should be discussed again, in order to prevent patients from the risk of a paradoxical aggravation under medical treatment by epoprostenol.",

In all cases CT of the abdomen was performed after 30 days to evaluate the position of the mesh which is visualised as an higher density bandlike structure. Results: In one patient after 30 days ct scan showed a fluid collection; one patient became syntomatic after 50 days and a new CT scan was performed with IV contrast medium which showed an infected fluid collection whith enhancing. Conclusion: CT scan is a useful technique to assess post-operative complication of laparoscopic repair of ventral hernias, such as sieromas, abscess, hematomas, bowel obstructions and recurrences and is a great advantage to an accurate follow-up evaluation. Methods: Patients admitted with acute abdominal pain for which no immediate surgical intervention or CT was indicated, were randomised to \"early CT\" (within 24 hours of admission) or to follow \"standard practice\". Diagnoses and confidences (on a 5-point scale) were documented by surgeons on admission and again after 24 hours. The admission, 24 hour, and final diagnoses (established at surgery and/or 6 months follow-up) were assessed by two reviewers for changes (to more serious, or less serious conditions, or \"no change\"). Results: 55 patients were randomised to \"early CT\" and 63 to \"standard practice\". Early CT reduced the length of hospital stay by 1.1 days, but this reduction did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.17). Only 50 % (59/118) of admission diagnoses proved to be correct on follow-up, improving to 75 % (89/118) after 24 hours (both independent of the randomisation arm). Although early CT was not associated with a significant change in diagnostic confidence at 24 hours, comparison with the final diagnosis revealed that early CT missed significantly fewer serious diagnoses (p = 0.006). There were 7 in-patient deaths, all in the \"standard practice\" arm. Conclusions: CT undertaken early during an admission for acute abdominal pain may have favourable effects on length of hospital stay and mortality, and it is able to identify unforeseen diagnoses and complications, particularly those of a potentially serious nature. Objective: To correlate isolated blunt spleen, and liver injury in children with presence and amount of free-fluid on CT scan. Methods: 134 paediatric patients (range 3 months to 17 years) with isolated solid organ injury (liver or spleen) was confirmed with enhanced CT scan and graded according to the ASST guidelines. The presence, location and amount of free-fluid was recorded. Free-fluid was quantified as 0 = no fluid, 1 = small amount, 2 = moderate, 3 = large for each of the 3 anatomic areas. Results: 134 paediatric patients with an isolated spleen (n = 66) or liver (n = 68) injury from blunt trauma were identified. Free-fluid was noted in 101 injuries overall (75 %), more commonly with spleen (82 %) than liver (69 %) injuries. As injury grade increased, so did the frequency of free-fluid (grade 1 50 % to grade 5 100 %) and the total volume of free-fluid in the three quadrants (grade 1 0.75 to grade 5 5.6). The total volume of free-fluid was greater for splenic injuries (3.1) than liver injuries (1.7).

Conclusion: The initial standardized \"whole body\" CT used provided fast, comprehensive and accurate diagnosis of cervical, thoracic and abdominal soft tissue injuries in trauma patients. It is superior to sonography in assessing abdominal injuries. It should be preferred over a targeted approach with selective CT of certain body areas according to sonography results and the clinical situation since it is time efficient and often reveals unsuspected injuries.

Salvatore; Naples/IT Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of single-phase (SP) helical CT in the detection and assessment of resectability of patients with suspicion of pancreatic carcinoma (PC). Methods and materials: 78 (mean age: 62 \u00b1 11 years) patients with a suspicious PC were studied. Unenhanced scan was followed by one set of scans (5 mm beam collimation, 3 mm reconstruction intervals, pitch 1.0, 120 kV, 220 -240 mA) in the caudo-cranial direction, from the inferior hepatic margin to the diaphragm, with a scan delay of 50 s after I.V. contrast administration. Results: A final histopathological diagnosis based on surgical findings was obtained in 57 patients, in the remaining 21 fine needle aspiration biopsy followed by 2 years clinical follow up showed no evidence of malignancy. Final diagnosis was PC in 52 cases and chronic pancreatitis in 26. Of the 52 tumors, 8 patients had surgically resectable disease and 44 were unresectable. SP helical CT showed a diagnostic accuracy for assessment of tumor detection of 93 % with sensitivity and specificity of 94 % and 92 % and positive and negative predictive value of 96 % and 89 %, respectively. The overall accuracy of SP helical CT to determine resectability or unresectability of PC was 92 %. Conclusion: SP helical CT is an effective technique for the detection and assessment of resectability of patients with suspicion of PC. Due to the lower radiation burden and to the lower cost a SP of acquisition in a caudo-cranial fashion might be considered the protocol of choice when evaluating patients with suspicion of PC.",

Lee; Dublin/IE Purpose: To determine the effect of secretin assisted CT on contrast material delivery to the pancreas. Methods: 31 patients (mean age 70; range 47 -88) were enrolled. Triple phase helical CT of the pancreas was performed on successive days. Unenhanced and enhanced CT in the pancreatic phase and PV phase was performed without (day 1)and with (day 2) secretin (100 IU) given at t = 0 s (n = 10), t = 60 s (n = 5), t = 120 s (n = 5), t = 180 s (n = 4), t = 240 s (n = 4), t = 300 s (n = 3). Percent enhancement of the pancreas and PV system was calculated using ROI's obtained from studies with and without secretin. Two radiologists scored the images using a five point scale for: pancreas/tumour contrast, PV, SMV and duodenal mucosal enhancement. Results: Overall mean pancreatic enhancement was 125 % without secretin and 132 % with secretin. No significant difference in pancreatic enhancement was noted when secretin was given at t = 0, t = 60 s, and t = 300 s. However, significantly increased pancreatic enhancement was noted (secretin vs no secretin) at t = 120 s (12 %), t = 180 s (66 %) and t = 240 s (30 %) (p < 0.05). PV/SMV enhancement was significantly increased in the pancreatic phase in all secretin studies (p < 0.05). Qualitatively scores for pancreas/tumour contrast, PV/SMV and duodenal mucosal enhancement were all increased on secretin studies. Conclusion: Secretin administration increases pancreatic enhancement which aids tumour identification. Early enhancement of duodenal mucosa and PV/SMV is helpful for staging. For optimal results secretin should be given 2 -4 minutes before IV contrast administration. Further patients are being recruited and study completion is estimated for November 2001.",

Vagnarelli, M. Danti, R. Passariello; Rome/IT Purpose: To prospectively evaluate multislice CT (MSCT) in the preoperative diagnosis and assessment of resectability in patients with clinical suspicion of pancreatic carcinoma. Material and methods: 26 patients referred for suspected pancreatic carcinoma underwent MSCT. Immediately prior to the examination, patients were given 300 -500 ml of tap water; i.v. scopolamine (20 mg/ml) was administered to reduce intestinal peristalsis. Unenhanced volume was first acquired, followed by the postcontrast acquisitions, during arterial and portal venous phases. The post-contrast volumes were acquired afeter injection of 140 ml of non ionic c.a. at 4 ml/s. Images were evaluated using a real time interactive 3D approach by two observers, in terms of lesion identification and conspicuity, infiltration of peripancreatic fat, vascular involvement of major peripancreatic arterial and venous vessels, adenopathies and liver metastases. Results: Pancreatic carcinomas were identified in 22 of the 26 referred patients; in 4 cases no abnormalities were detected. Tumors were located in the head in 13 cases, the isthmus in 3 cases and in the tail in 6 cases. Peripancreatic spread was seen in 12 cases. Vascular involvement was identified in 10 cases. Adenopathies were present in 14 cases, while liver metastases in 6 patients. 3D real time interaction with multiplanar reformations appeared particularly useful in the evaluation of vascular involvement and above all in the detection of liver metastases. Conclusion: High resolution MSCT with multiplanar reformations is a very accurate technique in the identification and staging of patients with suspected pancreatic carcinoma. To develop, test, and evaluate an automatic brain contour segmentation technique for multispectral MRI data of the human brain based on radial basis functions (RBF) neural networks. Methods and materials: 17 healthy male volunteers (aged 23 -32 years) were examined employing a standardized MRI sequence protocol (T1w MP-RAGE, T2w/ PDw SE, IR, anatomically correct image registration) on a 1.5 T system. Automatic brain tissue classification was performed by a 3-layer feed-forward RBF neural network: Image data were transformed to a 33-dimensional feature space with 3 spatial and 30 gray level coordinates of each voxel and its neighborhood. For comparison, manual interactive brain contour tracing was performed by two neuroradiologists on each data set. Five data sets served as training data. The procedure was tested on the remaining 12 data sets. Contingency tables were calculated w.r.t. results of human interactive contour tracing and compared to interobserver variability of manual segmentation. Results: Computation time for automatic brain segmentation was 31 \u00b1 2 min on a Sun UltraSparc workstation. MRI acquisition time was 27.5 min for the sequence protocol. Manual processing time for interactive contour tracing of the training data was 110 \u00b1 14 min. The ratio of voxels classified differently in manual and automatic segmentation was 2.5 \u00b1 1.2 %. This is comparable with the interobserver variability for manual brain segmentation (2.4 \u00b1 1.0 %). Conclusion: Automatic tissue classification by RBF neural networks is a powerful method for brain segmentation from extracerebral anatomical structures. Although comparable w.r.t. segmentation quality, the RBF approach is considerably less time-consuming than manual contour tracing by human operators. Purpose: For medical applications in the field of Computer Assisted Surgery it is essential to complement human visual systems. In order to develop new ultrasound based minimally invasive therapy systems in the head and neck region we combine both MR and 3D ultrasound data. Materials and methods: MR and ultrasound datasets from the head and neck region were prealigned manually and filtered using adaptive filtering techniques. The prealigned data were matched for the first time using our biomechanical model based on a linear elasticity model recently developed for nonrigid registration of MR datasets of the brain. In order to reduce the computational effort this model uses as input parameters a sparse deformation field estimated from the images as well as predefined homogeneous tissue parameters. Results: MR acquisition technique leads to rigid nondeformed datasets. Ultrasound techniques offer resolution capacity of higher quality specially for soft tissue diagnostics and therapy. But ultrasound volume datasets show distorted and deformed anatomical structures. In order to prealign the data all images need to be resampled using both global affine transformation and interpolation. After being carefully prealigned an edge enhancement was carried out using adaptive filter techniques. It is shown in some cases of the neck region, that it is possible to match both data types using a linear elasticity model.",

Hilfiker 1 ; 1 Z\u00fcrich/CH, 2 Moffett Field, CA/US Purpose: The International Space Station will provide an orbiting research facility for addressing fundamental questions on the long-term effects of microgravity on living systems. Many of these life science experiments will require the use of the Space Station Glovebox Facility, a contained reach-in environment where astronauts will handle animals and collect biological samples. To aid in this endeavor, virtual environment technologies are being developed to assist astronauts in training and performing complex experiments in the Space Station Glovebox.

Here, we describe the prototype VGX system and its initial simulation environment using CT and MRI datas. Material, methods, and results: The Virtual Glovebox was designed and developed for three main applications: engineering evaluation of operational efficiencies for glovebox equipment, experimental design for on-orbit life animal research and simulation for training astronauts to perform biological experiments in space.

Material/methods: Three-dimensional reconstructed models based on CT data sets of 22 patients SCFE were reviewed. Measurement of the hip joint geometry was performed by using a newly developed interactive software to determine projected angles. A phantom scan was performed to validate the accuracy of the tool. A computer program for simulation of movement based on cartilage filtering techniques and osteotomy developed by the authors, served for study execution. Results: We found a significant positive correlation between the femur version and the version of the femoral epiphysis. Furthermore, there was a highly significant positive interdependence between the shaft-neck-angle and the shaft-epiphysis-angle. There was no correlation between the epiphyseal orientation and the anteversion and inclination of the acetabulum. Conclusion: The study of the hip geometry demonstrates a significant correlation between the femoral orientation and the epiphyseal alignment. In response to these results, we suggest that there is an interrelation between the development of the proximal femur and the epiphyseal growth plate, wich influences the planning of reorientating osteotomy Purpose: In addition to tumour size, the therapeutic effect after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy is histopathologically described by regressive changes.

Beside T-1w FLASH 3D pre-and post contrast MRI, a fast TurboFLASH sequence was used for the dynamic examination. The time-intensity curves were parameterised by a pharmacokinetic two compartment model and colour-mapped. In consideration of the conventional MRI, tumour diameters were measured using the colour-mapped images and compared with the histologically determined tumour size. Regarding sclerosis, cytopathic effects and invasive residuals the histological regression was classified between 0 and 4. Results: In 12 cases without regressive changes (grade 0), the correlation (Spearman rank test) between MRI and histopathological tumour measurement was 0.88 (p < 0.0002). In 17 patients with regressive changes grade 1 -3 the correlation was 0.48 (p < 0.0538), without any tendency for systematic over-or underestimation (p = 0.32). Compared to tumours without regressive changes, those with grade 1 -3 were associated with a distinct decrease of pharmacokinetic parameters (Amplitude and distribution constant rate) derived from time-intensity curves (p < 0.037 resp. p < 0.034). In two cases without residual tumour (grade 4), a complete response was observed by MRI. Conclusion: Histological regression of breast tumours after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy leads to an inaccuracy of preoperative MRI tumour measurement. In addition to the lost tumour continuity the decrease of contrast uptake complicates the demarcation of residual tumour. (axial T1 3D FFE, axial and sagittal T2*  FFE, axial and sagittal T2 TSE) . Two experienced radiologists analysed the lymph nodes regarding size, morphology, and signal intensity before and after Sinerem\u00ae. The results were compared with histopathologic findings. Results: A total of 123 lymph nodes were detected equally by pre and post-Sinerem\u00ae MRI. 200 lymph nodes were diagnosed by histology. A node-by-node correlation between MRI findings and histology could be achieved in 93 lymph nodes. 10/93 lymph nodes were true positive, 75/93 true negative, 3/93 false negative, 5/93 false positive. Sinerem\u00ae-enhanced MRI revealed a node-by-node sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 77 %, 94 %, and 91 %, respectively. However, in the overall lymph node assessment for each patient Sinerem\u00ae-enhanced MRI did not miss any lymph node metastases. Conclusion: Sinerem\u00ae-enhanced MRI is an accurate method in the assessment of lymph node metastases in patients with breast carcinomas and is superior to plain MRI.",

Purpose: This study was designed to investigate the relationship between greater tuberosity irregularities, subacromial space, age and rotator cuff tears in the subacromial impingement syndrome. Methods and materials: Sonographic examination of 67 symtomatic shoulders (age range of patients from 33 to 79 years) were performed. The rotator cuff, greater tuberosities and subacromial space were evaluated. Full and partial thickness rotator cuff were given equal significance. Supraspinatus degeneration was graded according to the Neer classification. The sonographic finding of tears was confirmed surgically. A student's t test, and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the data. Results: Sonography showed the greater tuberosity to be irregular in 78 % of 47 shoulders with a rotator cuff tear and in 75 % of 20 shoulders with supraspinatus degeneration. The thickness of supraspinatus outlet ranged from 8.5 mm to 2 mm in shoulders with rotator cuff tear and from 9 mm to 3.7 mm in shoulders with supraspinatus degeneration.

Firstly, the feasibility of this method was evaluated by comparing normal and osteoporotic groups. Secondly, verification was performed by measuring the \"coefficient of variance\". Thirdly, the feasibility was compared with quantitative CT using intervals C and E in medullary zone, since the interval E in medullary zone was used on quantitative CT. Results: In the medullary zone, intervals A-D showed significant differences between osteoporotic and normal subjects, while analysis of whole density measurements (interval E) could not reveal a significant difference between both groups.

Purpose: Micro-CT may offer a worthwhile opportunity to analyse so called patterned injuries in bone. In the field of forensic science, it has not been possible until now to non-destructively document such damages to bone. Materials and methods: Based on a real murder case, porcine pelvic bones were experimentally stabbed with multiple knives. Afterwards these bone samples were examined with a micro-CT system developed at the IMP Erlangen. This cone beam scanner can achieve an isotropic resolution from 10 to 100 \u00b5m for sample diameters from 1 to 40 mm. Resolution in the specific bone samples is 30 to 75 \u00b5m depending on the sample size. So far analysis has been performed by visual inspection of double oblique slices of the reconstructed volume to optimally display the plane cut by the knife using Impact View (VAMP GmbH, Erlangen, Germany). Additionally the stabbing wounds were quantitatively evaluated by measuring distances and angles. Results: The micro-CT datasets of the injured bone samples were used to obtain those 2D slices that optimally showed the stabbing wounds inside. Based on the measured distances and angles it was easily possible to uniquely identify the size and shape of the injury-causing knife in straight stabs.",

This defect was filled with a threedimensional extracellular matrix gel inoculated with osteoblasts, marked with lipophilic tracer components, latter to proof viability. Implants were covered by Gore-Tex patches. The cells phenotype was determined by antibody staining. MS-CT examinations were performed 24 hours, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks after implantation in short anaesthesia using a Siemens Somatom Volume Zoom unit (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Acquisition parameters were: collimation 2 \u00d7 0.5 mm, tube current 40 to 80 mAs at 80 to 120 kV, reconstructed slice thickness/increment 0.5/ 0.3 mm. Thin sagittal multiplanar reformations (slice thickness 0.5 mm, overlapping 0.5 mm) out of coronar acquisition were performed. The rats were sacrificed, the implants histologically examined, and correlated with CT findings with respect of defect size and ossification. Results: In all cases there was an absolute correlation between CT-findings and histological findings concerning the size of the defect and the presence of mineralised bone matrix. Conclusion: MS-CT is a very sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for this and similar studies. With respect to refinement and reduction of animal experiments following the directive 86/609/EEC of the council of the European Union MS-CT allows tremendous reduction of the number of animals to be sacrificed (in this study two-thirds).",

            "text": "3D-navigation with an infrared-based camera system for biopsies using spiral-CT datasets -initial preclinical results C.R. Krestan, S. Grampp, P.L. Peloschek, M. Pretterklieber, C. Czerny, H. Imhof; Vienna/AT Purpose: To assess the accuracy and feasibility of biopsies with a novel 3D-navigation system (CT-Sightline: Philips Medical System, Best, Netherlands) which is based on spiral-CT datasets. Methods: This navigation system uses an infrared based camera, which can track the biopsy needle and the patient position by infrared light reflected from mounted passive spheres. The spiral CT dataset (Philips, Secura Tomoscan 7000) gained during the procedure can be linked with the position of the instruments and the patient position. We used needle-marked water melons for biopsy purposes. After scanning the object, target and entry point are located by the physician. The accuracy of the simulated biopsies with 14 and 16 G standard coaxial biopsy systems was determined by a target scan. The table position of the target scan and the gantry tilt are given by the navigation system. Results: We performed 18 biopsies (targeting of needle-tip) using water melons. The mean distance between the biopsy needle tip and the target needle tip was 5.3 \u00b1 3.6 mm (range: 0.8 -9.2 mm). The average time for the procedure after set-up of the navigation-system was 15 minutes on average. Conclusions: Our preliminary results suggest that this navigation system allows accurate targeting of biopsy needles at defined regions of interests within a reasonable procedure time. The advantage of this system is the potentially safer and more accurate positioning of the biopsy needle at different targets. Further studies and clinical evaluation will determine the value of this system in performing minimally invasive procedures. To explore the novel application of a methodology known engineering as pq diagrams to characterise the evolution of ischaemic stroke. Methods: Five acute stroke patients were imaged with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) at presentation, 1 week and 3 months on a 3 T magnet using a previously described DTI data acquisition scheme. Each dataset was then processed on a voxel-by-voxel basis, and each tensor was decomposed on into its p (isotropic) and q (anisotropic) components. When p and q are taken as axes of a Cartesian plane, the evolution of tissue (e.g. due to pathology) can be visualized as characteristic trajectories or signatures in this plane. In this study, p, q, and the standard indexes relative anisotropy (RA) and fractional anisotropy (FA), were computed for the lesion (L) and contralateral control (C) regions, for each patient at each time point. Results: All patients showed the same characteristic trajectories consisting of: an acute (pL < pC, qL < qC), subacute (pL \u2248 pC, qL < pC), and chronic (pL > pC, qL < qC) stages. Percentage acute changes in q, RA and FA for the five studies were: \u2206q = 51 %, 69 %, 50 %, 51 %, 0 %. \u2206RA = 3 %, 44 %, 14 %, \u22126 %, \u2212110 %. \u2206FA = 2 %, 35 %, 14 %, \u22125 %, \u221289 %. Conclusion: RA and FA are less sensitive than p and q to detect diffusion changes associated with early ischaemia. In particular, q seems to be the most sensitive parameter to detect early loss of anisotropy in tissue; pq diagrams provide a powerful analytical and visualization tool to investigate the evolution of stroke.",

Moseley 1 ; 1 Stanford, CA/US, 2 Graz/AT Purpose: Diffusion-weighted single-shot EPI (sshEPI) is currently one of the most important tools for the diagnostic assessment of stroke patients, however it suffers from well known artifacts. SENSitivity Encoding (SENSE) was employed to greatly enhance the quality of diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging (EPI) in stroke imaging and for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Methods and materials: Eight healthy volunteers and a consecutive series of stroke patients (n = 8) were examined with diffusion-weighted SENSE-sshEPI using different reduction factors (1.0 < R < 3.0). Moreover, in eight volunteers the potential of SENSE to improve DTI was investigated. DTI scans were carried out with regular (42 \u00d7 128; R = 2.0) and high resolution acquisition matrices (42 \u00d7 256; R = 2.0). To further improve the image quality, new reconstruction and co-registration algorithms were applied. Results: Derived maps of the trace of the diffusion tensor and of fractional anisotropy were of high quality. Measured direction-dependent diffusion-coefficients and isotropic diffusion values were comparable to previous findings but showed less fluctuation. Overall, the geometric distortions were substantially removed and the resolution enhancement was remarkable. All patient examinations were diagnostic and of better quality than conventional sshEPI. The efficient use of thrombolysis requires robust algorithms for patient selection in acute stroke. Intracranial vessel status and properties of brain tissue perfusion are predictive of cerebral ischemia. We present first clinical results using a multimodal multislice CT concept. Material and methods: Sixteen patients (age 34 to 90 years) with suspected cerebral ischemia and onset of symptoms within 6 hours (mean 2.6 h) were included in this prospective study. We performed noncontrast CT (NCCT) followed by perfusion CT (PCT) and CT angiography (CTA). At the level of basal ganglia PCT data were acquired using a 4 \u00d7 5 mm collimation after injection of 40 ml of CM (flow 8 ml/s). Two consecutive slices of 10 mm slice thickness were reconstructed. Cerebral perfusion maps (CBF, CBV, TTP) were calculated using CTP software. The size of the ultimate cerebral infarction was measured by follow-up CT or MRI. Results: In nine patients significant perfusion deficits were noted in one (n = 1) or both (n = 8) slices. Four patients with normal PCT showed small supra-or infratentorial infarctions outside the section levels. No false-negative PCT results were seen. CTA revealed major vessel occlusion in five patients. NCCT showed early signs of infarction only in three individuals. Conclusion: PCT improves the sensitivity for the detection of cerebral ischemia in the section levels compared to NCCT and can estimate the ultimate size of infarction. CTA might localize the underlying pathomorphology. The presented multimodal CT concept is an accurate and reliable method for the assessment of acute stroke.",

Cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, and time to peak enhancement were measured within specific regions of the brain on CT perfusion imaging. Quantitative analysis was used for these images and comparative analysis was performed on these two groups to evaluate the differences on perfusion images between TIA patients and control group. Results: A gradient of perfusion between the gray matter and the white matter was shown on the CT perfusion images of normal adults and TIA patients. Persisting abnormal perfusion changes of decreased cerebral blood flow were found on about 86 % CT perfusion images of TIA patients. Abnormalities were detected on time-to-peak images of all TIA patients with diffuse or regional prolonged time to peak enhancement.

Low flow regions, associated with minimal contrast enhancement and poor signal to noise ratios, are susceptible to difficulties using traditional perfusion calculations. We propose a novel signal enhancement algorithm for analysis of low flow regions. Methods: 30 CT brain perfusion cases were acquired. A low flow improvement technique, which works by clustering similar tissue types, was applied to each case. Gray matter and white matter regions were manually segmented. For quantitative measurements, perfusion values and ratios were calculated for each region before and after the low signal correction.

Image quality indicators were noise, residual bone structures, motion artefacts of pulmonary vessels, heart and aorta, display of retrocardiac ribs or other bone structures, display of lung apex or retrocardiac lung. Image review was performed blinded by two experienced Radiologists in consensus applying a rating score of 1 to 5. Linear regression and chi square tests were performed for statistical analysis. Results: Overall image impression was rated good with no significant improvement of image quality with increasing dose.

Image processing in digital radiography offers the option for optimising detail contrast. Purpose of the following study was a) to test whether contrast enhancing processing compensates for increased scatter radiation if no grid is used and b) whether further dose reduction is feasible. Materials and methods: Routine chest films with storage phosphor plates (ST Vn, Fuji) were performed on 24 ICU patients on 3 consecutive days using an antiscatter grid and an acquisition dose approximating 250 speed system, without grid and an optimised image processing, and without grid and additional dose reduction of one third.

Results: Areas under the ROC curve for the detection of catheter fragments were statistically equivalent for all images irrespective of the use of a grid or reduction of acquisition dose (0.92, 0.93 and 0.93, resp.).

Bailet 1 , N. Magne 1 , E. Chamorey 1 , J.C. Machiavello 1 , J.C. Gallard 2 ; 1 Nice/FR, 2 Caen/FR Purpose: To report the feasibility and cost effectiveness of two venous chemotherapy port implantation techniques in 200 M0-breast cancer patients. Material and methods: Radiological venous arm port (R) and surgical subclavian (S) implantation techniques were retrospectively evaluated in an homogeneous set of 200 M0 breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Mean age was 55.7 a [55.5 a, n = 100 (R); 55.9 a, n = 100 (S)] and the F/M sex ratio was 1.0. Initial feasibility was evaluated for both techniques. Procedure related direct costs and outcome were respectively evaluated. Results: Initial technical failures rates (R/S) were 4 % and 9 %. Mean implant duration time was 168/222 days, the overall complication rate (R/S) was 9 %/13 % (CHI2 test p = 0.5) (0.24 -0.4/1000 patient-days). Mean implant duration time without any complication or death was 193 d vs 233 d. Median number of chemotherapy courses was 6 (R = S). 6 %/7 % of the devices had to be removed prematurely. Complications included device-related sepsis (n = 2 vs 5), skin dehiscence (n = 3), deep venous thrombosis (n = 1 vs 4), catheter occlusion (n = 1 vs 0) and fissuration migration (n = 1.1 vs 0.0) of the catheter. Direct costs (R/S) were respectively 230.8 vs 219.1 \u2022 . Conclusion: Both techniques are successful and safe, with a 5 % higher relative cost for R placement. Both are indicated for breast cancer adjuvant chemotherapy.",

Ferro; Genova/IT Purpose: Report our clinical experience of the treatment with balloon angioplasty and/or stent placement of subclavian or brachiocephalic benign venous stenosis or obstruction in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Materials and methods: Among 27 patients with subclavian (n = 13) or brachiocephalic (n = 15) venous stenosis or obstructions, 10 were treated with PTA alone and 17 with PTA and stent placement. Technical success and primary and assisted primary patency rates were calculated. Results: Technical success was 100 %. The ten patients treated with PTA alone had good immediate results. Primary patency rates at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years were respectively 90 %, 80 % and 80 %. Two patients required additional procedures with repeated PTA and stent placement (Wallstent) with an assisted patency rate of 100 % at 2 years. 24 Wallstents were inserted immediately after failed angioplasty in 17 patients because of early restenosis and unsuitablility for angioplasty. Primary patency rates at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years were respectively 76 % (13/17), 61 % (8/13) and 70 % (7/10). Eight patients required multiple reinterventions for restenosis or thrombosis with additional angioplasty and/or stent placement. Assisted patency rates at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years were respectively 100 % (17/17), 92 % (12/13) and 80 % (8/10). Conclusion: Endovascular treatment of subclavian and brachiocephalic benign venous stenosis or obstructions with PTA alone and/or stent placement can provide prolonged use of a hemodialysis access site. Close clinical surveillance and multiple reinterventions are usually necessary to maintain stent patency. Follow-up was available in 19 patients over 20 months. In this period 11/19 patients (57.9 %) had another treatment: PTA of intra stent stenosis in 23 cases; stenting of restenosis after PTA in 4 cases; positioning of a second stent in 2 cases. Results: In total we performed 62 procedures, with a full technical success in 59 (95.1 %), 2 (3.2 %) were technically unsuccessful and 1 complication ocurred (1.7 %): rupture of the treated vein. Primary patency rates were 82 % at 3 months, 53 % at 6, 17.6 % at 12 and 5.8 % at 24 months. Secondary patency rates were 100 % at 3 months, 55.5 % at 6, 33.3 % at 12 and 22.2 % at 24 months. Conclusion: Interventional procedures allow treatment of stenoses with a high grade of technical success but the high incidence of restenosis requires continuous monitoring and frequent re-intervention to maintain the functionality of the hemodialysis vascular access.",

Nagata, S. Aoki, M. Takahashi, K. Murata; Otsu Shiga/JP Purpose: To evaluate factors that influence the initial success rate and long-term results of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for hemodialysis access dysfunction. Methods and materials: A total of 81 PTA procedures were performed in hemodialysis shunts with stenosis (61 procedures) or occlusion (20 procedures) in 47 patients between 1997 and 2001. Initial success rates were compared between patients with stenosis and occlusion. In cases where initial success was obtained, cumulative rates of shunt-patency (CRP) were evaluated to assess whether the following three factors may influence the long-term results; length of stenosis (\u2264 3.5 cm vs > 3.5 cm), length of patent period of the primary shunt (\u2264 12 months vs > 12 months) and diameter of the balloon used for angioplasty (\u2264 4 mm vs > 4 mm). Results: Overall initial success rate was 87.7 % (Stenosis: 98.4 % vs occlusion: 55.0 %). Overall CRP at 3, 6, and 12 months were 81.5 %, 54.9 %, and 44.4 %, respectively. CRP was significantly higher in patients with shorter stenosis compared to patients with longer stenosis (93.8 %, 72.1 %, and 63.1 % vs 70.8 %, 37.1 %, and 20.6 %, respectively, p < 0.01). CRP was significantly higher in patients with longer patent period of the primary shunt compared to patients with a shorter period (83.7 %, 67.8 %, and 63.8 % vs 81.4 %, 36.9 %, 21.5 %, respectively, p < 0.01). Conclusion: PTA is technically highly successful in patients with shunt stenosis (not occlusion) and a better prognosis is expected in patients with shorter stenosis and patients with a longer patent period of the primary shunt.",

Pitton 1 ; 1 Mainz/DE, 2 Mannheim/DE Purpose: To evaluate the clinical efficacy, mechanical stability and safety of vena cava filters (VCF) in patients for prophylaxis of pulmonary embolism. Material and methods: Retrospective analysis of 80 patients undergoing VCF for thrombosis (DVT) in 9/80 and pulmonary embolism (PE) in 71/80 patients. 3 filtertypes were inserted (73 LGM; 8 Antheor; 1 Cook Tulip) using a femoral approach in 66/80 and a jugular approach in 14/80 patients. Follow up included ultrasound, conventional X-ray and CT-scans. Results: No periinterventional complications occured. 71/80 patients were anticoagulated (51/80 marcumar, 20/80 heparin). Mean follow-up was 40.9 months (range 14 -113 months). 54 patients are still alive. Mean survival was 28 months (range 8 -40 months). 26 patients died (tumour progression n = 16, others n = 10). There was no evidence of further PE, but 3 DVT recurred during long-term follow-up. In 68/80 cases correct filter deployment was achieved including a suprarenal position (n = 3). Technical problems with filter deployment occured in 12 of 80: incomplete opening (n = 8), non-opening of filters (n = 2), filters tilted > 15\u00b0 (n = 2). Follow up demonstrated significant filter migration in 28/80 with a mean migration of 19 mm (range 7 -48 mm), 7/28 within 30 days and 20/28 showed late filter dislocations (> 12 months). Fractures of filter struts occured in 4 cases (2 LGM, 2 Antheor) and perforation of struts through the venous wall occured in 2 (Antheor). Conclusion: VCF has a low periprocedural complication rate but significant migration, some filter fractures and strut perforations were seen. Due to the low incidence of re-thrombosis under anticoaglation, VCF is restricted to very selected cases. Patients and methods: 117 patients underwent percutaneous implantation of a SNF from 1993 through to 1999. Patient reports were retrospectively analysed for complications during and after implantation and deep venous thrombosis and PE before and after implantation. Helical-CT with contrast media and plain abdominal radiography were performed on 35 patients, helical-CT alone on 2 patients. We checked the position and configuration of the SNF and looked for perforation of the filter legs through the wall of the inferior vena cava (IVC). The IVC and deep pelvic veins were analysed for patency. Results: During implantation 10/117 (9 %) patients had minor complications, major complications were reported in 0.9 % (1/117). Pulmonary re-embolism was documented in 9/117 (7.7 %) patients. There was no significant increase in thrombosis of the deep pelvic veins or the IVC after implantation. 1/35 (2.9 %) examined patients showed a single strut fracture of the SNF. Tilting more than 15\u00b0 was seen in 7/37 (19 %) patients. Dislocation of the SNF more than 10 mm occurred in 1/35 (2.9 %) patients and perforation through the wall of the IVC in all 37 patients.

Conclusion: Noninvasiveness, three-dimensionality, extended coverage and high contrast conspicuity are the characteristics of the applied whole body 3D MRA approach allowing for a quick, risk-free, and comprehensive evaluation of the arterial system in patients with atherosclerosis. The impact of cardiovascular and colorectal disease processes can be diminished if recognized and treated at an early stage or pre-stage.

Lopez Jimenez; Huelva/ES Objective: To determine the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of angiography of the abdominal aorta and lower extremities using diluted contrast media and CO2 postprocessing software for obtaining diagnostic images. Subjects and methods: Forty patients with peripheral vascular disease were evaluated by CO2 software-digital substraction angiography with diluted iodinated contrast material (Ioversol 240, diluted at 30 %). Results: Diluted contrast was well tolerated by all patients with no complaints despite the severity of the vascular disease. Good image quality was achieved for the aorta and iliofemoral arteries in all cases. The popliteal artery and distal tree images were of good quality in 35 patients. For the remaining five, it was necessary to use pure contrast along with the CO2 software. Conclusion: Contrast diluted angiography with CO2 software can be used as an alternative to pure iodinated contrast material for obtaining arteriograms of the abdominal aorta and lower limbs. The diagnostic quality is equivalent to that obtained with conventional methods. The lower dose of contrast reduces the risk of adverse reactions, increases the cost-effectiveness of the procedure and is more comfortable for the patients. The use of the CO2 software produces good quality diagnostic arteriographic images with more comfort for patients, less secondary effects and less cost. The time for completing the study is similar to the conventional one and less time consuming than CO2 lower extremities angiography. Material and methods: CDUV was performed using manual injection and digital substraction angiography in 40 consecutive patients (77 upper limbs). Images were read on a 1K high brillance digital workstation. The international anatomic nomenclature was used to divide the superficial venous network into 16 segments per limb. Two senior radiologists independently assessed the patency of all segments according to the following grading: absent or non-opacified (grade 1), poor quality (grade 2), small calibre (grade 3), good quality (grade 4). In the case of discrepancy, a consensus was reached by reviewing the images. The kappa-test was used to assess the inter-observer correlation in each of the 16 different venous segments. Results: Overall, grade 1 was seen in 24 %, grade 2 in 13 %, grade 3 in 12 % and grade 4 in 51 %. Mean \u03ba was 0.72 (p < 0.05) for the right side and 0.71 (p < 0.05) for the left side.

Marincek, D. Weishaupt; Z\u00fcrich/CH Purpose: To compare contrast-enhanced 3D MR angiography (MRA) and multidetector row spiral CT angiography (CTA) in the assessment of the aorto-iliac and renal arteries, using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as the standard of reference. Methods and materials: DSA, MRA and CTA were performed in 39 consecutive patients with suspected occlusive arterial disease. Two readers assessed all MRA and CTA data sets independently; a third reader evaluated the DSA images. All reviewers were unaware of the results of the other imaging modalities. For data analysis, the arterial system was divided into 16 segments, and a 4-point grading system was applied to assess arterial luminal stenosis. Time for post-processing and reading times of MRA and CTA data sets were noted. Results: For readers 1/2 sensitivities of CTA were 80 %/83 % and specificities 96 %/96 %; MRA had sensitivities of 91 %/92 % and specificities of 97 %/96 % for detection of hemodynamically significant stenosis (> 50 %). Interobserver agreements for both MRA and CTA were good (kappa = 0.74 and 0.67). Intermodality agreement between CTA and MRA for readers 1/2 were 0.73/0.70. Post-processing of CTA data sets was significantly more time consuming (mean 15 minutes) compared to post-processing of MRA data sets (mean 4 minutes) (p < 0.001). Similarly, reading time for evaluation of CTA was longer than reading time of MRA (4 versus 2 minutes). Conclusion: Both MRA and CTA demonstrate a similar diagnostic performance compared to DSA in the assessment of occlusive disease of the aorto-iliac and renal arteries. Due to shorter post-processing and reading times, MRA seems to be more suited to clinical routine.",

The data were evaluated in MIP and 3D reconstruction and the resolution was compared to conventional DSA angiography, which was performed after the CT scan. Results: In reconstruced multislice CT with isotropic voxels all segmental and subsegmental arteries could be delineated. The reconstructed CT data allowed similar spatial resolution to DSA, but additionally the segmental anatomy could be evaluated. Discussion: Reconstructed multislice CT gives similar spatial resolution, with delineation of subsegmental arterial branches, as angiography. But the 3D data allows additionally the delineation of the segmental anatomy which is essential for the planning of nephron sparing surgery. ",

In most cases the renal artery study was part of a run off examination for patients with peripheral arteriopathy. A fixed time delay of 25 to 28 (in presence of abdominal aortic aneurysm) seconds was used in all cases. Images were interpreted by 3 blinded radiologists either on axial or reconstructed images. In all patients DSA was performed within 72 hours and considered the gold standard. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for the assessment of degree of stenosis and evaluation of supernumerary arteries were calculated. Results: We evaluated 123 renal arteries. MSCTA provided good to excellent diagnostic quality in all cases; all 21 supernumerary arteries were correctly demonstrated. Regarding the degree of stenosis the values of sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were respectively 100 %, 95 %, 100 % and 92.6 %. CTA was superior to DSA in the delineation of calcification. In 4 cases with ostial calcified plaque the stenosis, moderate at DSA, was overestimated with MSCTA and considered severe.",

The limited amount of contrast agent used lends itself to use in patients with partially impaired renal function. To evaluate the utility of MRI for the assessment of angiodysplasia compared to conventional duplex US, venography and arteriography. Methods and materials: 14 patients (9 male, 5 female; age range, 10 -64 years) with clinically diagnosed angiodyplastic abnormalities of the extremities were examined on a 1.5 T whole body scanner (Magnetom Sonata, SIEMENS, Germany). Based on a localizer sequence axial/coronal T1-, heavily T2-weighted (STIR) as well as axial T1-weighted sequences post contrast were acquired to determine the extent and type of the arteriovenous malformation. In addition dynamic contrastenhanced (0.2 mmol/kg Gd-BOPTA, Multihance, BRACCO, Italy) 3D gradient echo sequences were collected. A board certificated radiologist as well as an angiologist analysed the MR data sets for lesion depiction, determination of extent and involvement of neighbouring structures as well as characterisation of the malformation. Results were compared to findings from duplex US, conventional venography and intraarterial arteriography. Results: All MR examination were of diagnostic quality. A total of 16 arteriovenous malformations (venous malformation: n = 11, arteriovenous fistulae (AVF): n = 2, posttraumatic AVF: n = 3) were depicted. The STIR sequence was helpful in the determination of the extent of the vascular malformation which was often underestimated by 3D MRA alone, whereas dynamic 3D MRA was mandatory for the classification of the lesion. These findings correlated well with the combination of conventional venography (n = 11) and Duplex-US (n = 16).",

Interventions on the spine (10) and the intervertebral discs (8) were performed without significant deviation from the approach determined initially. Though application of the system was simple, free access to the patient was often aggravated by the scanner and robotic design. A marked learning curve was observed, thus leading to a significant reduction in intervention time in the course of all procedures (40 %) Conclusion: A robotic system may be useful for CT-interventions in the spine, significantly reducing the radiation dose to the radiologist. As examination time is still markedly increased and patient access remains difficult, the system configuration has to be further optimized for the clinical setting. Purpose: Percutaneous vertebroplasty is used to strengthen the pathologic vertebral body and reduce pain in some diseases involving the spine. The purpose of this study was to evaluate segment stability and clinical status in patients who received vertebroplasty after radiofrequency ablation of spinal tumors. Methods and materials: 23 vertebroplasties with polymethylmethacrylate were performed in 14 patients who had been treated with radiofrequency ablation of inter-or paravertebral tumors in the thoracic and/or lumbar spine. Vertebroplasty was indicated due to presence or imminent tumor related vertebral fractures and presence of imminent neurological deficits. Operations were carried out under CT/ fluoroscopy guidance under local anesthesia and on an out-patient basis. At follow-up, preoperative MR images were compared with follow-up MR-images in addition to clinical examination. Follow up ranged from 3 to 12 months. Results: At follow-up, MR images of treated vertebral bodies showed no signs of sintering or refracture. Clinical examination showed improved mobility of the spine in 13 patients (92.9 %).

Purpose: Frequent complications of osteoporosis are fractures, especially in the vertebral bodies of the thoracic and lumbar spine. The purpose of this study was to ask whether percutaneous CT-/fluoroscopy-guided vertebroplasty can cause pain reduction in patients with fractured osteoporotic vertebral bodies. Methods and materials: 25 verebroplasties were performed on 17 patients with osteoporotic vertebral body fractures. Patients suffered from superior or inferior endplate fractures, combined end plate fractures without loss of height and combined end plate fractures with loss of height. Inclusion criteria were new osteoporotic vertebral body fractures with acute pain as well as older fractures with persistent pain. Exclusion criteria were fractures causing a narrowing of the spinal canal and neurological deficits, tumors, cement allergy and haemorrhagic diathesis. The procedure was carried out on an outpatient basis under local anesthesia and was performed under combined CT/fluoroscopy-guidance. Follow up examinations were carried out after an average of 2 days and after 3 months. Pain was assessed with the help of a visual analogue scale. Results: At the time of the first follow up, patients reported on an average relative pain reduction of 29.9 %. After 3 months the patients obtained an average of 33.4 % relative pain reduction according to the visual analogue scale. Conclusion: CT/Fluorscopy-guided percutaneous vertebroplasty of osteoporotic vertebral body fractures is a gentle, effective and minimally invasive method to reduce symptomatic pain in the affected region.

Lukasser; Kufstein/AT Purpose: CT-guided lumbar facet joint infiltration is a valuable tool in treating lower back pain. The duration and quality of pain relief is evaluated. Methods and materials: 60 patients suffering from lower back pain caused by osteoarthritis of the facet joints underwent CT-guided lumbar facet joint infiltration with bupivacain and hydrocortisone. Only one facet at one lumbar level was treated. Evaluation of pain relief and change in medical treatment over a period of one year was performed with a questionaire. Results: 58 patients (97 %) felt a complete relief of pain after a mean time interval of 5.2 days after the infiltration. After one year 19 patients (32 %) remained free of pain. 16 patients (27 %) improved markedly or reported rarely any pain, whereas in 25 patients (42 %) the pain recurred to the same extent as before the infiltration. The pain free interval after infiltration was a mean of 110 days. Before infiltration 55 of the patients (92 %) took one or more different oral analgesic drugs. One year after infiltration 28 patients (51 %) still needed analgesics. In 25 patients (45 %) who took two or more different drugs before treatment this was reduced to 5 patients (9 %) after one year. No adverse effects of the infiltration were seen during the study interval. Conclusion: CT-guided lumbar facet joint infiltration is a save and effective treatment for patients with lower back pain caused by osteoarthritis of the facet joints. Purpose: Offical recommendations for obtaining informed consent for operative or IR procedures are that the patient is consented by the operator. The purpose of the study was to identify the proportion of European interventional radiologists who conform to these guidelines. Materials and method: A questionnaire was designed and consisted of thirteen questions on current working practice and opinions on informed consent. The questionnaire was distributed to 786 European interventional radiologists who were members of Irish or British Societies of Interventional Radiologists and members of CIRSE. The anonymous replies were then entered into a database and analysed. Results: 254 (32.3 %) questionnaires were returned. Institutions were classified as academic (56.7 %), 40.5 % non-academic (40.5 %) and private (40.5 %). 83.5 % of responders do not use specific consent forms and 61 % have patient information leaflets for procedures. Although 72.8 % of radiologists consent patients for some procedures, junior medical staff (house officers or senior house officers) consent patients in 58 % of replies. Over half (56.3 %) did not feel that their current policy was adequate. Comments from responders indicated that there is insufficient time for radiologists to consent all patients. Suggestions to improve current local policies included radiology outpatient clinics and radiology nurses visiting patients on the wards or in outpatient clinics. Conclusion: Only 24.8 % of European interventional radiologists follow current guidelines for obtaining informed consent. The causes identified were resource limitations and in particular constraints on time.",

Purpose: Acute recanalization in myocardial infarctions (MI) has shown to be of benefit with respect to global myocardial function and prognosis. The aim of our follow-up study was to investigate late effects of acute coronary angioplasty (PTCA) on regional wall motion after the subacute phase of MI. Patients and methods: 17 patients underwent MR imaging at 1.5 T after acute PTCA in the subacute phase of MI and a second time 6 months later. Corresponding short axis slices encompassing the left ventricle (LV) were acquired with standard Cine and delayed contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (ceMRI). Target parameters were the percentual size of infarction (PSI (%)) and percentual wall thickening (PWT (%)) in the infarct area (IA) and the remote area (RA). Results: PSI was similar in the subacute phase and at 6 month's follow-up (22.2 and 21.9 %, respectively; n.s.). PWT improved significantly in IA (21.9 and 37.9 %, p < 0.05) in contrast to RA (46.4 and 38.4 %; n.s.), whereas global myocardial function did not change significantly. This late improvement was only observed in transmural MI. Patients with subendocardial myocardial infarction did not show any further improvement. Conclusion: PWT improved in IA after acute PTCA even after the subacute stage of transmural MI in this 6-month follow-up study. This phenomenon could be explained by a prolonged stunning in transmural infarctions and contradicts the hypothesis that \"bright\" in delayed ceMRI represents nonviable tissue in all cases. Contrast-enhanced (ce) MR can clearly depict definitive necrotic areas after myocardial infarction: The high resolution of MRI permits discrimination of subendocardial versus transmural infarction. Follow-up with cine MRI allows documentation of functional recovery of both subgroups. Methods: 30 Patients (26 males, mean age 56 years) underwent emergency PTCA \u00b1 stent for AMI. MR controls were done on day 1, 3, 7 and 28 after AMI using a 1.5 T unit (Siemens, Sonata) with the following protocol: (1) multiple TrueFISP (TR 3.2 ms, TE 1.6 ms) along the short axis to assess LV volumes and wall motion abnormalities; (2) 3D inversion recovery sequence (TR to RR, TE 1.64 ms) 10 -15 min after administration of Gd-DTPA to visualise infarcted myocardium (\"late enhancement\"). Results: 12 patients showed transmural infarction in late enhancement. All of these patients had wall motion abnormalities in the same segments which persisted over the observation period of 28 days. 21 patients had myocardial segments with non-transmural enhancement in late enhancement. Improvement of the wall motion abnormality was shown in 11/21 patients. The transmural group showed a decrease of EF (0 -7 %) and the non-transmural group an increase (0 -4 %).",

Methods and materials: 18 consecutive patients with first AMI (63.9 a, 16 anterior, 2 inferior, 8 primary PTCA, 4 thrombolysis) underwent MRI, SPECT and DE within the first week after onset of symptoms. MRI was performed with a 1.5 T scanner (GE Signa Horizon Echospeed); short axis single slice first pass (iv 10 ml Gd-DTPA, 3 ml/s) and multi-slice delayed T1 imaging were performed. Using a 16 segments LV model, both segmental analysis and percent infarct area were analyzed. Segments were classified as: (1) normal first-pass, absent or delayed hyperenhancement; (2) hypoenhancement at first-pass, delayed hyperenhancement; (3) hypoenhancement both at first-pass and delayed imaging. In delayed images, segments out of first-pass slice were classified at delayed imaging as normal, hyperenhanced and hypoenhanced. Patterns 2 and 3 and patterns hyper-and hypo-were considered non viable. Results: Segmental analysis results were poor, particularly if compared with DE (sensitivity 70 %, specificity 78 %); infarct area analysis (at least 2 viable segments) was better (vs DE and SPECT respectively: sensitivity 76 % and 72 %, specificity 83 % and 88 %). Conclusions: Patterns 1 and 3 respectively identify viable and non viable tissue. Pattern 2 or delayed hyperenhancement is less specific as 25 % viability was demonstrated at DE and/or SPECT. First pass plus delayed imaging are superior to delayed imaging alone (sensitivity and specificity with DE and SPECT respectively 76 % vs 72 %, 84 % vs 78 %, p > 0.05), but multislice first pass is mandatory.",

Weinmann 2 ; 1 Essen/DE, 2 Berlin/DE Purpose: To investigate whether the area of hyperenhancement using extracellular contrast agents is larger compared to the region demarcated by a necrosisspecific contrast agent. Methods and materials: 15 rabbits underwent thoracotomy and permanent occlusion of a branch of the left coronary artery. Two animals died prior to imaging, 8 animals were examined 48 hours following occlusion and 5 animals were imaged six weeks following induction of the infarction. All animals received 50 mmol/kg of a necrosis-specific contrast agent (Gadophrin-3, Schering, Berlin/Germany) 24 hours prior to the MR examination. Continuous short axis views were collected on a 1.5 T MR scanner using an ECG-triggered IR-turboFLASH sequence. Imaging was repeated 10 minutes after additional injection of 100 mmol/kg of Magnevist (Schering, Berlin/Germany). The area of hyperenhancement demarcated following Gadophrin-3 injection was compared with hyperenhancement seen on Gadophrin-3 plus Magnevist enhanced images and with TTC staining. Results: In animals with acute myocardial infarction hyperenhancement was detected in 27 slices. The mean difference in the size of hyperenhancement seen on the two different in-vivo MR scans was \u22121.8 \u00b1 6.0 mm 2 (p > 0.05). Both measurements showed excellent agreement with TTC-staining. Chronic infarctions showed no enhancement following Gadophrin-3 injection, whereas application of Magnevist resulted in hyperenhancement. Conclusion: In acute myocardial infarction the area of hyperenhancement following Gd-DTPA application does not exceed the area of hyperenhancement seen on Gadophrin-3 enhanced images. The combination of Gadophrin-3 and Magnevist can distinguish acute and chronic infarction because chronic myocardial infarctions do not enhance with Gadophrin-3.",

Data evaluation included signal intensity (SI) over time analysis and determination of baseline and peak signal and contrast to noise ratios (S/N, C/N). An automated post-processing software (ARGUS, Siemens) was used to derive perfusion parameters SImax, slope, time to peak and area under curve. Results: With diastolic ECG-triggering 2 -4 slices/RR-interval were acquired.

Method/materials: Irritation in the region innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve can be transmitted as pain to the ear due to connections between the glossopharyngeal nerve and the tympanic nerve. In a prospective study 36 consecutive patients, median age 59 (range, 41 -76 years) with oropharynx carcinoma underwent MRI before radical radiotherapy. 21 patients had referred pain to the ear, 15 did not. The protocol included axial PD/T2-weighted TSE sequences, axial, coronal, and sagittal T1-weighted SE sequences before and/or after contrast medium administration. Examinations were performed on two 1.5 T MRIs (Magnetom Vision, Siemens, or Signa, GE). Two independent, blinded radiologists analyzed the MRI studies for alterations of anatomical structures (effacement, signal alteration, or contrast medium enhancement) of the oropharynx and adjacent regions. A twosided 2 test was used to compare variables. Results: Patients with referred pain to the ear showed significantly more alterations of the following structures innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve: palatoglossus (p < 0.002), stylo-(p < 0.006) and palatopharyngeus (p < 0.004), and constrictor pharyngis (p < 0.04) muscles; hard palate (p < 0.005), tonsil (p < 0.002), pre-epiglottic space (p < 0.03), and posterior soft palate (p < 0.003). No difference could be observed for structures innervated by different cranial nerves. Conclusions: Alterations of structures innervated by the glosso-pharyngeal nerve showed a significant association with referred pain to the ear in patients with oropharynx carcinoma.

Results: Virtual laryngoscopy and MPR accurately demonstrated upper airway stenosis caused by intraluminal tumor growth. There was a close correlation (r = 0.94) between virtual laryngoscopic and fiberoptic laryngoscopic grading of stenosis. Virtual laryngoscopy was limited in the differentiation of mucus and appositional tissue folds from tumor, which was more reliable with MPR and axial CT slices. Furthermore, subtle mucosal irregularity could not be defined. Conclusion: Virtual laryngosopy with multislice CT enables high-resolution endoluminal imaging of the upper airways with a short scan time despite thin collimation, but should be combined with axial CT-slices and MPR readings. Virtual laryngoscopy was especially useful for evaluation of subglottic and tracheal stenosis, which may be difficult to assess with fiberoptic laryngoscopy. It is a reliable non-invasive method for the assessment of upper airway stenosis as a complement for fiberoptic laryngoscopy. Purpose: To evaluate the potential of MR-guided laser-induced thermotherapy using a high power irrigated laser application system for the treatment of recurrent head and neck tumors. Materials and methods: 27 recurrent tumors in the head and neck tumors (recurrent squamous cell carcinoma n = 24, recurrent pleomorphic adenoma n = 3) were treated using MR-guided laser-induced thermotherapy and a newly developed irrigated power application system which allows power settings 6 times higher than the conventional system. A total of 53 laser applications were performed using 37 laser applicators. MR thermometry was performed using a temperature sensitive T1-weighted gradient echo sequence for monitoring thermal induced changes in signal intensity. Follow up studies were performed using plain and contrast enhanced MR. Results: All procedures could be performed under local anesthesia. Laser applicators with an active length of 2 or 3 cm were used with 24 or 36 W respectively (12 W/cm active length of the laser applicator). The application time was between 4 and 15 minutes. All lesions showed a very rapid heat distribution. We were able to induce coagulative necrosis in all patients. Clinical relevant improvement of clinical symptoms was observed in 24 lesions. The treatment of 3 lesions resulted in no improvement of clinical symptoms. Conclusion: MR-guided LITT using a high power irrigated laser application system proved to be an reliable and effective method to treat recurrent tumors in the head and neck region. MR-thermometry allowed monitoring of laser induced temperature changes during LITT.",

Methods and materials: 4 patients (range 42 -65 years) presented with neck and shoulder pain after surgical intervention in the neck region (2 after lymph node biopsy, 2 after neck dissection). US was performed with a linear broad-band transducer (5 -12 MHz) working on a HDI 5000 (ATL). In 3 fresh cadavers the accessory nerve was detected by means of US and marked with blue ink. Following, the accessory nerve was exposed carefully. Results: In the right lateral cervical region of two patients, who underwent lymph node biopsy, we found a hypoechoic mass, in which a tubular structure ended. We suspected a cut accessory nerve. In two patients with unilateral neck dissection US revealed a tubular structure ending in a hypoechoic scar measuring 3 cm in length. In all cases the trapezius muscle showed hyperechoic texture, suggestive of muscular atrophy. US findings were confirmed by electroneurographic testing and surgical nerve inspection. On US the accessory nerve appears a small tubular structure (diameter 0.7 mm) lying just under the superficial layer of cervical fascia. In all specimens the nerve was correctly marked by means of US showing blue stained accessory nerves after dissection. Conclusions: The capability of high resolution US allows detection of the normal accessory nerve and of iatrogenic accessory nerve palsy. ",

To obtain maximum filling of the collecting system, the diuresis was pharmacologically induced by administering i.v. 250 ml of saline solution together with 20 mg i.v. of furosemide. One MR acquisition was performed 10 minutes after diuresis induction. 5 normal volunteers and 115 patients had undergone IVU and ascending pyelography was performed in 15 cases. Results: We always obtained an excellent anatomical evaluation of the renal collecting system that was considered comparable to that obtained with IVU. It was always possible to study the renal collecting system malformations, even in patients with known contraindication for i.v. administration of contrast media. Renal calculi larger than 2 mm were always identified by the analysis of 3D coronal scans. DiMRP is particularly important for the detection of ureteral stones. 24 patients had non-functioning kidneys on IVU: in 23 cases with obstructive uropathy the site of the obstruction was determined and using conventional MRI, abdominal plain radiograph and urinary cytology, the cause was always determined.

Using the discriminant analysis we were able to achieve a specificity of 79 % and a sensitivity of 90 % in terms of separating healthy kidneys from those with either vascular, parenchymal or combined disease. On the contrary, renal volume measurements did not show any significant differences.",

It is the unusual cases of LCH that often create a particular diagnostic dilemma. However, careful analysis of the radiographs including the site of involvement and behavior, coupled with a detailed demographic and clinical history, can be suggestive of the diagnosis. Methods and materials: 542 consultation cases, including 730 skeletal sites, submitted to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, were analyzed for unusual manifestations of LCH. Five unusual manifestations were evaluated including cortical involvement, disease at birth, presence of fluid levels, circumferential \"pencilling\", and involvement of the mandibular inferior cortex. Results: Unusual demographics included 46 non-Caucasian cases. Unusual sites of involvement were the epiphysis (2), apophysis (1), cervical spine (13), posterior elements of the spine (8), soft tissues (2), cortical involvement (6), and atypical locations (sternum, middle and distal phalanx). Unusual manifestations included crossing the physis (1), crossing calvarial sutures (6), fluid levels (2), erosion of the inferior mandibular cortex (1), transforming from sclerotic to lytic (2), brain invasion (1), circumferential \"pencilling\" (5), sequestrum in noncalvarial sites (2), unusual size of a lesion (1), and bone expansion (4). These unusual appearances may mimic other diseases including Paget disease, fibrous dysplasia, Ewing sarcoma, coxa vara, and metaphysitis. Conclusion: Recognition of the spectrum of unusual manifestations of LCH is helpful in allowing distinction from other differential diagnoses. ",

Radiologic studies inculuded radiographs (n = 6), CT (n = 2), and MR images (n = 6). Evaluation included patient demographics, lesion location and size, radiographic features, and intrinsic characteristics on CT and MR images. Review of histologic specimens was carried out by an experienced musculoskeletal pathologist. Results: All lesions were located at the surface of long tubular bones (femur 3, tibia 2, humerus 1); three involved the diaphysis, two the dia-/metaphysis, and one exclusively the metaphysis. Lesion size ranged from 2.5 to 6 cm in maximum diameter. Radiographs and CT images always showed a superficial bone defect, which on radiographs demonstrated irregular margins in four cases. All lesions caused an interrupted periosteal reaction (shell 3, trabeculated shell 1, Codman angle 2). MR images always showed a multicystic appearance with hypointense rim, contrast-enhancing cyst walls, and fluid levels. Edema of adjacent soft tissues was present in all cases. Conclusion: Aneurysmal bone cysts in a subperiosteal location can demonstrate an aggressive radiographic appearance. MR imaging appears to be most valuable in differential diagnosis, since it can demonstrate typical morphological features of the underlying process.",

Method: We selected 20 patients with high uptake rib lesion on bone scintigraphy. Plain radiography and rib ultrasonography were performed on these patients. Ultrasonography was performed using linear 12.5 MHz transducer. We analyzed cortical disruption, mass, callus formation, hematoma, deformity and bone destruction by rib ultrasonography.

Functional tumor imaging including dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI and FDG-PET seem to be capable techniques to evaluate ongoing response during therapy. Aim of this study is to assess the clinical utility of DCE-MRI in such cases. Materials and methods: Within a therapeutic phase I protocol, DCE-MRI was included as a surrogate marker to assess the tumor prior and during therapy. After neoadjuvant treatment, surgical resection was performed with histological correlation as well as detailed micro-array analysis.

Patients were examined on a MR system (Siemens Sonata) equipped with a rolling table platform (BodySURF) allowing the swift movement of the patient through the magnet bore as well as through a phased array surface coil. T1w 3D VIBE data sets were collected in five stations following the intravenous application of paramagnetic contrast covering the body from skull to the knees.

MRI findings were compared to results obtained with skeletal bone scintigraphy and CT-scans of the abdomen and chest. Results: All pulmonary and hepatic metastases > 6 mm detected by CT were identified by whole-body MRI. Skeletal scintigraphy detected bone metastases in nineteen patients.

Ahlstr\u00f6m; Uppsala/SE Purpose: Evaluation of early therapeutic changes in breast cancer bone metastases using various parameters of MRI, CT and histopathology. Materials and methods: 20 metastatic bone lesions in 17 breast cancer patients were examined with MRI and CT, and were subsequently biopsied under CT-guidance before initiation of chemotherapy and 6 courses later (median). The changes in size and signal intensity (SI) on T1-weighted and long TE inversion-recovery turbo-spin-echo (long TE IR-TSE) MR sequences and in density on CT were measured. The histopathological changes in the amount of tumor and fat cells, in the density of fibrosis and in the trabecular bone were evaluated. Results: The amount of tumor cells was decreased in 16 (responding) and was increased in 4 lesions (progressive). SI could not be measured in one responding lesion. There was no change in the tumor size and SI on T1-weighted sequence in 8 of 15 responding lesions. There was an increase in SI on long TE IR-TSE sequence of 11 of 15 responding lesions. Two progressive lesions remained unchanged, one increased in size and the other in SI on T1-weighted sequence with no alteration on long TE IR-TSE sequence. Density increased in 12 of 16 responding lesions and in 3 of the 4 progressive lesions on CT images. Conclusion: An increase in SI in metastatic lesions on long TE IR-TSE sequence may indicate an early therapeutic response while a T1-weighted sequence is of limited value. An increased density on CT can be measured in both responding and progressive lesions.",

This low incidence and the overmedicalization with numerous university hospitals and large general hospitals with MR-equipment available limits the number of cases seen in each hospital and per year and hampers the gaining of expertise in this field. To cope with these disadvantages, the department of radiology of the University Hospital of Antwerp in cooperation with all MR centers (47) in Belgium created a Belgian Soft Tissue Neoplasm Registry (\"BSTNR\"), starting the registration on January 1, 2001. Material and methods: Internationally accepted standard procedures are used in the development of the electronic database in order to guarantee future and systematic availability of the data. A clinical and statistical indexing of biomedical imaging and image-related information based on the attributes of image acquisition procedures and on the diagnostic image obeservations is applied. In this way, an electronic image data selection by image related, acquisition related as well as disease related criteria will be possible. Results: Until now 330 cases of soft tissue tumor sent by the cooperating centers have been registered.",

Vascular heterogeneity (SD%CDA) showed similar results, albeit less significant (P < 0.01). There was a monotonic linear relationship between m%CDA and SD%CDA with increasing tumor grade. Best separation was achieved between benign, intermediate and high grade (P < 0.001). There was a clear correlation between increasing tumor grade and higher vascularity (m%CDA). Separation between benign and low grade was possible, but less significant (P < 0.08). This correlates to histopathology, where vascular markers are low -similar to benign -for this group. Conclusions: QPD shows the potential to differentiate benign from malignant softtissue tumors. It can measure increasing vascularity and vascular heterogeneity and reliably predict higher-grade malignancy. QPD therefore is a promising new non-invasive method both diagnostically and prognostically. After Gd administration there was no significant enhancement of the nodules.

Images were exposed automatically (AEC mode) by using a Molybdenum/ Molybdenum (Mo/Mo) anode-filter-combination, 28 kVp and 63 mAs (protocol A, dose ~100 %). Dose reduction in digital mammography was achieved by using protocol B with Mo/Rh and 31 kVp (dose ~60 %) and protocol C with Rh/Rh and 32 kVp (dose ~40 %). The detectability of microcalcifications was assessed by 3 well-experienced readers with a confidence level ranging from 1 to 5. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed. Results: In protocol A the area under the ROC-curve (Az) for contact views performed by the screen-film system was 0.63 and for those performed with the FFDM system 0.68. For the conventional and digital magnification views Az was 0.70 and 0.79, respectively. For the protocol B/C the Az value reached 0.74/0.65 for the contact views, and 0.81/0.77 for magnification views.",

Evertsz 2 , N. Karssemeijer 1 ; 1 Nijmegen/NL, 2 Bremen/DE Purpose: To investigate the use of a digital reading station for screening mammography and to compare results with analogue reading. Materials and methods: 500 cases, 125 screen-detected cancers, 125 interval cancers, and 250 non-cancers, were collected from the Dutch breast cancer screening program. For each patient, mammograms from two prior screening rounds were collected in addition to diagnostic mammograms. Diagnostic mammograms and pathology reports were used to establish ground truth. All mammograms were digitised and processed by a CAD system (R2 Imagechecker, Los Altos, CA). Experienced screening radiologists participated in a study in which each of them read one film the two prior screening mammograms of all 500 cases in randomised order and blinded to the detection results. The readers were asked to annotate potential abnormalities, and estimate the likelihood of malignancy of each finding they reported. A subset of 100 cases with visible cancers on the prior mammograms and 175 non-cancers were randomly selected. This subset was reread on a dedicated workstation we are developing for screening mammography, by a subset of 5 radiologists 1.5 years after their first reading. The workstation was has two highresolution monitors (BARCO). Results were evaluated using ROC analysis and compared to the results obtained with analogue reading. Results: No significant difference in screening performance between analogue and digital reading was found, provided CAD was available for microcalcification detection. Conclusion: Using a dedicated reading station for mammography, soft-copy reading of digital mammograms in screening is possible without loss of quality.",

Technical issues in planning the establishment of DTMg screening infrastructure include network design, image compression, archiving, and special viewing station.

A component-based approach to software development is described and is validated for each of the abstract system requirements for future breast screening computing environments and information management. Research approach is telediagnosis, teleconsultation, and telemanagement. Results: The implementation of this architecture is described and analysed from image and clinical data. Workstations and comprehensive database development is the most difficult and expensive technology for teleimaging and information management. Full-field DTMg with technical components, study protocols, and preliminary results of a study are analysed. Conclusion: The study shows the DTMg system to be successful in fulfilling the goals, DTMg is also considered in the general context of an integrated regional health telematics network, emphasizing its role and its interaction with other information and networking services for decision treatment strategies. DTMg standard needs to be further evaluated for quality of telemammography and for cost effectiveness. Material & methods: Seventeen subjects affected by drug resistant cryptogenic partial epilepsy underwent long-term computer assisted video-EEG monitoring and DSC MRI in the same day. MRI data were compared with EEG findings, and accuracy of perfusional MRI was analyzed considering the spiking rate and the type of epilepsy. Results: DSC MRI showed a relevant asymmetry in a region compared to the contralateral areas in 8 (47 %) out in 17 patients, suggesting the presence of a relative focal hyperperfusional pattern. This area corresponded to the epileptogenic focus or to the hemisphere involved. In the genesis of epileptic discharges in 7 (77.7 %) out of 9 patients showing a higher spiking rate (HSR) Conversely, all patients with a low spiking rate (LSR group) did not show significant asymmetry indexes in perfusional pattern. Moreover we found that DSC-MRI seems to be very sensitive for detection of epileptogenic focus in patients affected by temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). In 5 (83.3 %) of 6 HSR-TLE patients DSC-MRI showed a relative hyperperfusion region concordant with EEG focus or hemisphere involved in the genesis of epileptic discharges. Conclusion: Perfusional MRI is a noninvasive procedure that provides useful additional information to better localize the epileptogenic zone, when the interictal epileptiform activity is sufficiently elevated.

Materials and methods: 65 healthy volunteers (age range 25 -75) were examined by 1.5 T Magnetom Vision (SIEMENS).

Debus 1 , G. van Kaick 1 ; 1 Heidelberg/DE, 2 San Francisco, CA/US Purpose: To assess the clinical utility of proton MR spectroscopic imaging ( 1 H MRSI) for evaluating suspicious brain lesions after radiotherapy of glial brain tumors. Methods and materials: In this ongoing study 17 patients with irradiated gliomas (WHO grade 2, n = 12; grade 3, n = 4; grade 4, n = 1) were examined by 1 H MRSI and positron emission tomography with [ 18 F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG-PET) to evaluate suspicious brain lesions. The MR protocol included multiplanar T2w turbo spin echo MRI, 1 H MRSI (PRESS, TR/TE 1500/135 ms; spatial resolution 8.75 \u00d7 8.75 \u00d7 15.0 mm 3 ), and pre-and post contrast T1w-spin echo MRI. Relative signal intensity ratios of choline-containing compounds (Cho), total creatine (Cr), and N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) were determined both in lesions and in contralateral normal tissue using the program SiTools. FDG-standard uptake values of the lesions were obtained from PET examinations and were related to normal gray (SUVgr) and white matter (SUVwm). Lesions were classified as neoplastic (P) and non-neoplastic (nP) based on MRI follow-up or biopsy. Results: Significantly enhanced intensity ratios Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA were observed in P compared to nP (p = 0.05 for both ratios) and compared to the contralateral normal tissue (p = 0.01 and p = 0.00003, respectively). In all patients Cho/NAA and Cho/Cr correlated with FDG-standard uptake values, e.g., Cho/Cr and SUVwm: r = 0.58, p = 0.01.

Cabiol, J. Gili; Barcelona/ES Purpose: To assess the utility of 1 H MRS in the categorization of meningioma with especial emphasis in their differentiation with respect to other brain tumors. Methods and materials: Single voxel \"in vivo\" 1 H MRS at an echo time of 136 ms was carried out in 37 patients with meningioma. A data-set of 93 spectroscopic exams of brain tumors acquired under identical conditions was used for comparison. This data-set included 15 low-grade astrocytomas, 14 anaplastic astrocytomas, 30 glioblastomas and 34 metastases. Fitted area of seven resonances of interest (lipids at 1.30 ppm, Lact at 1.35 ppm, Ala at 1.45 ppm, NAc at 2.02 ppm, Glx at 2.35 ppm, Cr at 3.03 ppm and Cho at 3.20 ppm) was calculated. We searched for the resonances that better discriminated meningioma from every other tumor type. An empirical algorithm for bilateral discrimination between meningioma and the other tumors was produced on the basis of these findings. The performance of the algorithm was assessed by means of the leave-one-out method. Results: High Ala, low or absent lipids, high Glx, low Cr and high Cho were found to be the most characteristic trends of meningioma. When applied in pair-wise discrimination with the other tumors, these findings produced 91 % successful classification outputs, 7 % unsuccessful and 2 % \"unclassifiable\". Conclusion: Single voxel 1 H MRS provides biochemical information from meningioma that can be satisfactorily applied in its categorization. According to our results, high Ala, Glx and Cho, as well as low lipids and Cr are characteristic spectroscopic signatures of meningioma. ",

Analysis of Pearson's correlation showed very strong linear relationship between NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr ratios (p < 0.001), both at CS and cerebellum. Conclusion: Decreased NAA/Cr ratio can indicate the neuronal loss caused by chemotherapy. Decreasing Cho/Cr ratio could be associated with damage of myelin.

Ten patients presented with carcinoid symptoms. TACE was performed with Doxorubicin emulsified in Lipiodol\u00ae and gelatin sponge particles. Results: A symptomatic response relating to flushes and/or diarrhea was complete in 7/10 cases and partial in 2/10. An objective morphologic response was noted in 12/14 cases. One patient developed transient renal failure and hypertension after the first TACE. There was no procedure-related mortality in the series. The 5 and 10-year survival from diagnosis was respectively 83 % and 56 %. Six patients were alive at the end of the study after 27 to 100 months from first TACE and 38 to 142 months from diagnosis. Three of them were successfully palliated for 55, 69 and 100 months with only TACE as treatment (they received 9, 3 and 8 sessions respectively).",

            "text": "The control rate of carcinoid syndrome with TACE is comparable to somatostatin analogues. Long term clinical, as well as morphological palliation, is possible in unresectable liver metastases from digestive neuroendocrine tumors with a few sessions of TACE as early and exclusive treatment. Material and methods: 220 TACE in 54 consecutive patients with HCC. Sequential TACE (interval: 6 weeks) was performed using a suspension of 10 mg mitomycin C and 10 ml iodized oil (lipiodol). Follow-up included pre-and post-interventional CT scans and laboratory measurements (liver-function parameters; AFP). The number of lesions and tumour size were investigated using spiral CT. Results: Mean follow up was 17 months (range 6 to 50). 35 patients are still alive (mean survival 23 months, range 7 -50 months). 152 lesions were detected on the initial CT scans. Size of individual lesions was < 20 mm (I), 21 -50 mm (II), and > 50 mm (III) in 42.8 %, 38.2 % and 19 %. Over all median change of tumour size was -8.2 % (range -61 % to +82 %). Median change depending on the initial lesion size was -7.7 % (I), -9.5 % (II), and -3.8 % (III). Stable disease was noted in 33/54 patients. 10/54 patients had significant tumour regression and liver transplantation was successfully performed. Tumour progression was noted in 14 patients with multilocular HCC and tumours > 50 mm. Complications occurred in 3 patients, pancreatitis in one and dissection of the hepatic artery in two. There were no periinterventional deaths. Conclusion: Sequential TACE in primary HCC is an effective therapy in patients with small tumours. Because of tumour size control and avoidance of new tumour lesions, TACE is a promising method to bridge the time to liver transplantation or to change patients into a transplantable condition.",

An interactive table was positioned between the MRI and angiographic unit, and allowed repositioning of the patient on a carbonfibre-plate within 20 seconds. Arterial access was successfully achieved by employment of the DSA-unit and a MR compatible angiography catheter was superselectively positioned in the tumor feeding artery. The patient was then positioned in the MR unit and Gd-enhanced dynamic MRI (TurboFLASH) via the catheter revealed the regional perfusion and verified the correct catheter position prior to TACE. Results: In 14/30 patients immediate embolization of the tumor bearing liver segments was performed. In 14 patients repositioning of the catheter and in 2 patients a change of vascular access was necessary. Therapy monitoring using MRI therefore resulted in the repositioning of the catheter tip in 53 % of the embolization maneouvers. DSA control immediately after TACE revealed successful TACE of the appropriate liver segments. Conclusion: The presented hybrid system optimizes complex TACE procedures in patients with liver metastasis. MRI guidance enables the exact identification of the tumor bearing liver segments and correct catheter placement.",

Roise 1 ; 1 Oslo/NO, 2 Fredrikstad/NO Purpose: To study the effects of arterial embolization after pelvic trauma in hemodynamically unstable patients. Material and methods: From 1994 to 2000, 17 patients were included, three women and 14 men, mean age 35 years (from 16 to 72 years). All patients were admitted with trauma to the pelvis, but freqently multiorgan trauma was present. The pelvic fractures were bilateral in five, a sacral fracture was present in seven and diastasis of the symphysis pubis in seven. Over the 24 hours immediately before embolization the need for whole blood transfusion was 18 \u00b1 17 units (range 2 -64). Results: All 17 patients were successfully embolized. Fourteen had embolization of one internal iliac artery (IIA), one both IIA and a lumbar spinal artery, one a lumbar spinal artery, and one a superficial femoral artery branch. In 15 patients coils were used exclusively, in one gelfoam and in one coils and gelfoam were combined. The total need for blood transfusion after the embolization was 0.8 \u00b1 1.0 units (range 0 -3). Three patients died during the hospital stay, and no deaths were related to the procedure or rebleeding from the pelvic arteries. Conclusion: Embolization of arteries bleeding from traumatic injuries of the pelvis is a life saving procedure with a high procedural success rate. The procedure can be done on call, in hemodynamically unstable patients, and should probably be performed in an early stage of bleeding.",

Ichikawa 2 , H. Kawamata 2 , T. Kumazaki 2 ; 1 Aachen/DE, 2 Tokyo/JP Purpose: To evaluate the possible benefit of intraarterial chemotherapy in malignant pelvic tumors under tourniquet occlusion of the femoral vessels. Methods and materials: The difference in contrast enhancement of 55 regions in 23 malignant pelvic tumors was evaluated with and without tourniquet occlusion of the femoral vessels. In nine patients (Group A) two CT scans of the pelvis, one and five minutes after starting an intraarterial contrast medium injection under tourniquet occlusion, were performed and then two CT scans after injection of the same dose without tourniquet occlusion were performed. In the remaining 13 patients (Group B), the study was done in the opposite order. Results: In Group A, a mean change of the contrast enhancement of all tumors was 0.6 Hounsfield units (HU) after one minute and \u22123 HU after five minutes. In Group B, a mean change in contrast enhancement of 2.1 and 0.8 HU at one and five minutes respectively was observed. In patients with prostate tumor, the results were 5.2 and 3.9 HU respectively in patients from Group A and 14.1 and 10.2 HU in patients from Group B. The average of both groups together showed an increase of 8.9 and 6.5 Hounsfield units respectively. Conclusion: An increase in the contrast enhancement of malignant pelvic tumors due to tourniquet occlusion of the femoral vessels has been observed only in patients with prostate cancer after one and five minutes. Therefore intraarterial chemotherapy under tourniquet occlusion of the femoral vessels only seems to yield a benefit in poorly vascularized tumors. Purpose: To establish a high resolution MRI (HR-MRI) protocol for precise and repeated non-invasive analysis of selected atherosclerotic vessel segments in vivo and to compare the results with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Materials and methods: 7 patients with atherosclerotic disease of the superficial femoral artery were examined on a Magnetom Vision, Siemens using axial T1-w, fat-saturated contrast enhanced T1-w, T2-w and 3D-TOF sequences. Contrast enhanced MRA was used to display the detailed vasculature for precise orientation. Maximum matrix size was 320 \u00d7 512, minimum voxel size 0.49 \u00d7 0.49 \u00d7 2.0 mm. IVUS (3.5 F, 40 MHz) images were recorded with a standardized motorized pullback system (pullback speed 1.0 mm/s). Parameters analysed were minimum and maximum luminal diameter and cross sectional lumen area. Vessel wall calcification was determined by 900 steps. Results: 123/123 segments were available for comparison between HR-MRI and IVUS. Intra-and interobserver repeatability for exact assignment of vessel segments was high (r = 0.92, r = 0.87). There was a good correlation for luminal parameters (correlation coefficients ranging from 0.82 to 0.98 depending on the plaque burden). No correlation was found for cross sectional vessel area. Calcification could be classified with a sensitivity of 91 %, a specificity of 93 %. Accuracy was 93 %. Conclusion: Our HR-MRI protocol is highly accurate for non-invasive assessment of atherosclerotic lesions in human femoral arteries. The results are comparable with IVUS as known reference standard in vivo.

Colorcoded ultrasonography was obtained with a 7.5 MHz linear transducer (Logic 500, GE). Transverse and longitudinal sections were recorded from the bifurcation area as well as from the proximal internal carotid artery. The plaque surface was characterized as smooth if the plaque surface did not show any disruptions. Further, the echogenic structure was recorded by grey scale analysis. After CEA the inner surface of the plaque was visualized by a 1.4 mm angioscope. The results were compared with histopathological findings. Results: Peak flow velocity (mean: 2.77 m/s, range 1.76 -4.24 m/s) demonstrated a > 60 % stenosis in all cases. The median of gray scale analysis (GSM) was 55 with a high correlation between both investigations (P < 0.01; r = 0.954). In comparison to pathological findings there was a correct detection of plaque surface in 86.6 %. Pathological classification of plaque composition revealed no correlation to computer-assisted analysis (P = 3.85; r = -2.63). Conclusion: Detection of an ulcerated plaque surface by ultrasonography is difficult with a wider degree of variation when compared with direct visualisation of the surface and pathological examination. Computer-assisted analysis of the morphology provides a high interobserver correlation, however, there was no correlation between the GSM and histological findings in this series.",

To imitate physiologic circulation an artificial heart phantom emitting an ECG signal was used to perfuse the samples with pulsatile flow and varying pressures. Aortic wall elasticity can be determined by dividing the relative change in vessel area by the corresponding pressure change. As a reference, the wall distension was measured using an optical system with high temporal and spatial accuracy. ECG-gated CT images were acquired with a standard CT-angiography protocol applying specially developed reconstruction algorithms. This allowed us to obtain images with improved temporal resolution of about 100 ms. The aortic cross-section was determined from the images by manual segmentation. The accuracy of the crosssectional changes measurements was evaluated by comparison between the optical and the CT data. Results: Determination of aortic wall elasticity was possible in all samples. Elasticity, expressed as mean compliance, was 1.4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 /Pa. Precision of the manually determined values was in the order of 10 % compared to a precision of about 1 % for the reference optical method. Cross-section changes obtained from the CT images were in line with the error bounds obtained from the optical measurements.

Weinmann 2 ; 1 Essen/DE, 2 Berlin/DE Purpose: To visualize atherosclerotic plaques independent of luminal narrowing using T1-w contrast enhanced MRI. Methods and material: 5 Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits (9 -18 months) and 5 age-matched controls (White Newseeland) underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the aortic arch using a 1.5 T MR system (Magnetom Symphony, Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany) before and 48 h after injection of 100 mmol Gadofluorine (Schering AG, Berlin, Germany). A HASTE sequence (TR 700 ms, TE 60 ms) and a T1-weighted inversion recovery turboFLASH sequence (TR 300 ms, TE 4 ms, TI 120 ms) were used for data acquisition. Immediately following the MR examination the animals were sacrificed and the aorta was stained with Sudan. Ex vivo imaging of the stained aortic specimens was performed. Additionally, the gadolinium concentration in plaques and normal aortic wall was measured by means of inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry. Results: Plain MR imaging revealed no plaques in the aortic arch in either animal group. Enhancement occurred in the aortic wall of all WHHL rabbits but not in the vessel wall of the control group. Sudan staining demonstrated multiple plaques in the aortic arch of the WHHL rabbits and using ex vivo imaging the area of hyperenhancement matched the area of plaques stained with Sudan. The gadolium concentration was 51 \u00b1 21 nmol/g for normal aortic wall in the control group and 531 \u00b1 144 nmol/g for plaques. Conclusions: Gadofluorine enhances atherosclerotic plaques thereby permitting the detection of plaque independent of luminal narrowing.",

Results: Usind CEUS in arterial and very early portal phases, 25/29 metastases showed intense, predominantly peripheral enhancement. In full portal phase, complete disappearance of the enhancement was observed, with homogeneously hypoechoic appearance. The same arterial CT demonstrated enhancement, although less evident than with CEUS, in only 10 of these 25 metastases (40 %).

            "text": "Conclusions: Differentiation of coagulative necrosis from unablated or recurring hypovascular tumor is a diagnostic challenge. CEUS demonstrates marked arterial enhancement of the viable tumor portions, better and with higher sensitivity than with CT. This finding could represent a quick and valuable tool for post-ablation follow-up. Such arterial enhancement (more intense than that observed before ablation) raises a suspicion of more active neovascularity in uncompletely ablated tumors There was no effect on survival by tumor size, number of tumor nodes or the grading. However, the survival of 50 % of the patients with a Child C cirrhosis or with AFP levels > 1000 ng was less than 6 months with nobody living longer than 36 months. In patients with Child A cirrhosis and/or normal AFP levels the mean survival was 14 and 17 months, resp. 10 % of these patients lived more than 60 months. Conclusion: TACE is an effective therapy that may prolong the patients survival in patients with non-resectable HCC. However, Child class in cirrhotic patients and elevation of AFP levels have to be considered as prognostic factors for a life extending TACE therapy. Purpose: To evaluate a neoadjuvant treatment protocol for large sized liver metastases performing repeated transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and LITT (laser induced thermotherapy) in patients with unresectable liver tumours initially unsuited for LITT Material and methods: 519 patients with different malignant liver tumours were evaluated between January 1999 and September 2001. TACE was performed with 50 mg/m 2 mitomycin C, 10 ml/m 2 lipiodol and microspheres. The tumour volume was measured by MR-imaging. Lipiodol retention and perfusion of the tumours were evaluated by CT and angiography. After response to TACE and reducing the tumor size 106 patients (16 patients with HCC, 59 patients with metastases of colorectal cancer, 17 patients with metastases of breast cancer and 14 patients with metastases of different primary cancer) could be treated with MR-guided LITT 4 to 6 weeks post embolization. These patients received 2 to 6 (mean: 3.6) TACE before LITT. Results: Repeated TACE enabled a significant reduction in tumour size and/or tumour perfusion in 106 patients, forming the basis for the performance of MRguided LITT procedure for a complete ablation of the tumour. In 178 tumors lesions 203 laser interventions archived a complete tumour ablation. The initial tumour volume pre-LITT presented with a mean of 30.1 ml, the resulting necroses was 73.4 ml. The local tumour recurrence rate was 7 % in the 6 month control, the rate of side effects 11 %. Conclusion: Repeated TACE alteres the size and structure of primary unresectable liver metastases and expands the indication for MR-guided LITT. ",

Materials and methods: During a six-year span, 226 patients (aged 32 -88 years) with chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis were diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma confined to the liver and treated percutaneously with radiofrequency (RF) ablation. A total of 313 treatment sessions were performed. Post-therapeutic follow-up is based upon serum alpha-fetoprotein levels and CT examination. Results: Mean duration of follow-up was 17 months. After successful treatment, actuarial probability of neoplastic relapse is 30.7 % after 1 year and 58.5 % after 2 years. 88 patients had recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after a variable time interval (mean 7.3 months). Extrahepatic neoplastic relapse was observed in 14 patients, half of these without active hepatic disease. Distribution of extrahepatic sites of recurrence was as follows: abdominal lymph nodes (6 cases), bone (3), peritoneum (2), adrenal (2), lung (1). Five patients (2.2 %) had a second primary extrahepatic neoplasm. Conclusion: Extrahepatic hepatocellular carcinoma is considered rare and occurring in advanced stages, but may represent a modality of post-treatment relapse.

Materials and methods: 40 histologically proven malignant liver lesion (35 HCC, 5 methastasis, size range 1.6 -7.5 cm) in 37 patients (26 male, age range 44 -82 years) were treated with RF (using either internally-cooled electrode or Le Veen needle electrode).

Any other findings (perilesional hyperemia, THAD etc) were recorded. Results: Complete necrosis was described in 31 lesions (77.5 %) at 1 month, partial necrosis in the remaining 9 lesions (22.5 %). Local tumor recurrences (persistence) appeared in three patterns: nodular, halo or gross enlargement. 4/31 lesions (12.9 %) tumor-free at 1 month showed tumor persistence at 4 months. Analysis of these cases showed that residual disease was probably masquerade by perilesional hyperemia, a common finding at 1 month. Any lesion considered complete ablated at 6 month didn't show tumor recurrence in the following controls. 15 cases showed remote intrahepatic recurrence. Pseudolesions as THAD or a-v fistula were common findings expecially in early controls. The median follow-up was 13 months (range 6 -34 months).

Djouraeva; Tashkent/UZ Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of CT controlled intervention procedures in infected residual cavities after hydatidectomy. Material and methods: CT-guided drainage was conducted on 62 patients with infected residual cavities after hydatidectomy. Age varied between 14 and 76 years (mean 39.6). Size of cavities ranged from 4.5 cm up to 12 cm. 76.3 % of cavities were located in the right lobe. In homogenous low density collections (+10 \u00b1 18 HU) with thin walls an FNA procedure was used to allow aspiration. In other cases (37) with high density collections (+25 \u00b1 30 HU) we performed percutaneous drainage with 9 -18 F pigtail catheters. In 12 cases when cavity sizes were more than 10 cm we performed drainage via two catheters. Results: In 93.5 % of patients CT-guided interventions allowed us to achieve a full recovery. Repeated aspirations (from 2 up to 5) were conducted in 12 cases. One complication occurred (partial lung collapse). In 4 cases with ineffective drainage surgical conversion was needed. Conclusion: CT-guided drainage procedures can be an effective method of treating suppurative residual cavities after hydatidectomy and may be an alternative to surgical treatment. In none of the patients was contrast material administered for MRI. 90 patients also underwent cardiac catheterization within two months after MRI examination. All patients were examined with percutaneous echocardiography. The results were compared to the anatomical situs and functional parameters. Patients with abnormal coronary arteries were excluded from this study. Results: In 70 of 90 patients (77 %) cardiac catheterisation and MRI examinations provided results which led to the same clinical decisions. Discordance between the two methods occurred in the assessment of pulmonary stenosis, in the evaluation of spongy myocardium, and straddling of mitral or tricuspid valves. Overall there was no significant difference between MRI and cardiac catheterisation in the pre-and postoperative evaluation of congenital heart disease (CHD). Conclusion: MRI can be more beneficial in difficult patients especially with complex postoperative situs. Cardiac catheterisation should only be performed when MRI is questionable. Percutaneous echocardiography still remains the first diagnostic tool in the evaluation of CHD. ",

Sequences included continuous short axis truefisp cine sequences of the whole heart for volumetry of atria and ventricles, phase contrast (PC) through-plane flow measurement and cine sequences for assessment of valvular function. Patients were randomized and treated either by DEVEGA annuloplasty or by carpentier ring implantation. In 12 patients, postoperative results were obtained 2 -3 months after surgery. Results: 21 of 29 patients examined had an absolute arrythmia, thus impairing diagnostic quality especially for flow measurements. Atrial volumetry in these cases showed no discernible contraction, and through plane flow measurement in the valvular plane showed no A-wave. In all patients, the degree of insufficiency was established with PC-flow correlated with 4 chamber view cine sequences and echocardiographic findings. In the follow-up-studies, no significant differences between the surgical treatment groups could be detected. Conclusion: Cardiac MRI with PC-flow measurement and cine sequences seemed to be well suited for evaluation of atrial function and valvular morphology and function before combined valvular reconstruction. Atrial volumetry is less useful than valvular flow measurement. Cine sequences in the valvular plane allowed for sizing of the valvular ring. Purpose: Severe pulmonary regurgitation late after total correction for tetralogy of Fallot leads to progressive right ventricular dilatation and an increased incidence of severe arrhythmias and sudden death. MRI was used to assess the effect of PVR on RV function and PR. Materials and methods: 26 Adult patients who underwent pulmonary valve replacement in our institution between 1998 and 2001 were studied. Mean age at initial repair was 5.5 \u00b1 3.6 years and mean duration of follow-up was 30.0 \u00b1 8.9 years. Cardiac MRI was performed 6.2 \u00b1 3.7 months before and 7.7 \u00b1 2.3 months after PVR. Pulmonary regurgitation (PR), RV end-diastolic volume (RVEDV), Right ventricular end-systolic (RVESV) and RV ejection fraction (RVEF) were measured. Results: Preoperative PR was 45 % (range from 25 to 64 %). After PVR, 20 out of 26 patients (77 %) showed no residual PR. RVEDV decreased from 305 ml \u00b1 87 ml to 210 ml \u00b1 62 ml (p < 0.01) and RVESV decreased from 181 \u00b1 67 ml to 121 \u00b1 58 ml (p < 0.01 Purpose: Retrospectively ECG-gated 3D volume data from Multislice spiral CT (MSCT) coronary angiography enables image reconstruction in diastolic and systolic phase of the cardiac cycle.

Materials and methods: 28 patients (60.6 \u00b1 8.5 a) with coronary artery disease (CAD) underwent MSCT coronary angiography (Somatom Volume Zoom, Siemens AG; 4 \u00d7 1 mm slice thickness, 120 kV, 300 mA; 140 ml nonionic CM, flow 3 ml/s). An additional Cine MR study was performed at a 1.5 T MR unit (breath-hold FLASH 2D sequence, TR 80 ms, TE 4.8 ms, flip angle 20\u00b0, slice thickness 6 mm). From MSCT data set retrospectively ECG-gated axial images were reconstructed in systolic and diastolic phase (ACV reconstruction algorithm). Enddiastolic and endsystolic LV volumes were determined from multiplanar reformations (slice thickness 6 mm) in short-axis image orientation (3D volumetry) to assess LV-EF. Cine MRI data was analyzed by using the implemented ARGUS\u2122 software in shortaxis image orientation.",

Conclusion: In patients evaluated for CAD, retrospectively ECG-gated 3D volume data set from MSCT angiography provides LV volumetric and functional data in good correlation to Cine Magnetic Resonance Imaging. After intravenous administration of contrast media (120 ml, 370 mg/ml iodine, flow 3 ml/s) scanning was initiated by bolus tracking and performed using a ECG-gated protocol at 40 mAs and 120 kV, collimation of 4 \u00d7 4.0 mm, pitch of 1.2:4 and 0.5 s rotation time. The raw data was reconstructed with 50 % reconstruction pitch every 10 % of the R-R interval.

Main/DE Objective: To explore the value and accuracy of multislice-cardiac-CT in the assessment of functional cardiac parameters. Materials and methods: 23 patients prospectively underwent multislice-CT (SiemensPlus4VZ, Germany) and invasive angiocardiography. Using retrospective ECG-gating scanning parameters were 4 \u00d7 1 mm collimation, pitch 1.5 and 500 ms rotation time. Based on a proportional reconstruction algorithm two datasets were obtained from the endsystolic, endiastolic phase respectively. Effective slice thickness amounted to 2 mm, increment to 1 mm. Measurements were performed in 10 mm thick slices cut orthogonal to the short axis of the heart. Functional parameters determined were endiastolic (EDV) and endsystolic ventricular volume (ESV), segmental wall thickening and ejection fraction (EF). All measurements were performed using a MRI-proved evaluation software (ARGUS 2.3 WIP, Siemens, Germany). Invasive angiocardiography served as a reference measuring method using centerline analysis for functional evaluations. Results: Concerning evaluation of the ejection fraction, the Wilcoxon test for matched pairs did not reveal significant differences between the two methods (Tukey confidence interval: p = 0.95). However CA tended to overestimate EF by 4.5 %. The limits of agreement between CT and CA in EF were \u00b124.2 %. Significantly higher differences between both methods were found for EDV rather than for ESV, again values being overestimated by CA. The best correlations for EDV, ESV and EF were obtained in patients with DCM. Hypokinetic wall areas were detected with a sensitivity of 87.5 % (21/24), hyperkinetic regions with 92.6 % sensitivity (25/27). Conclusion: Multislice-cardiac-CT provides precise evaluation of functional parameters such as ejection fraction, wall thickening or endiastolic and endsystolic volume. To evaluate left ventricular volumes and systolic function using multirowdetector spiral computed tomography (MDCT) with retrospective ECG gated biphasic data reconstruction in comparison to left ventriculography (LVG). Methods and materials: 25 patients underwent routine MDCT coronary angiography using retrospective ECG-gating. Dedicated algorithms allowed for a temporal resolution of 250 ms. Contrast enhancement was provided by administration of 120 ml of Iopromid. To assess LV volumes and systolic cardiac function biphasic reconstruction at end-diastole (ED) and end-systole (ES) was performed. Data reconstruction timing was based on the ECG trace with placing the ED window at \u2212100 ms before the R-wave and the ES window to cover the T-wave. Short axis views were reconstructed from ED and ES data sets and the Simpson rule used for calculation of ED volumes (EDV), ES volumes (ESV), stroke volumes (SV) and ejection fractions (EF). Data were compared to results of LVG. Results: EDV (R = 0.59) and SV (R = 0.56) showed good correlation with LVG, whereas ESV (R = 0.88) and EF (R = 0.82) showed very good correlation. MDCT significantly overestimated EDV (MD: 22 \u00b1 36 ml; P = 0.0045) and ESV (MD: 39 \u00b1 22 ml; P < 0.0001) whereas SV (MD: \u221217 \u00b1 27 ml; P = 0.008) and EF (MD: \u2212 17 \u00b1 9 %; P < 0.0001) were significantly underestimated. MDCT intraobserver variability ranged between 4 % and 6 %. Conclusion: ECG orientated biphasic reconstruction of coronary MDCT data sets allow for estimation of LV volumes and systolic function without the need for additional scanning. However, with current possible temporal resolution cardiac volumes are consistently higher in MDCT and therefore SV and EF are underestimated in comparison to ventriculography.",

Schr\u00f6ttner; Graz/AT Purpose: Comparison of left ventricular volumes and muscle mass studied by electron beam tomography (EBT) and magnetic resonance (MR) evaluated by a geometry-based model as well as 3D methods in patients with suspected or known coronary heart disease. Materials and methods: 40 patients were studied by EBT (ECG gated, multislice mode, 50 ms exposure time, intravenous contrast agent application) in long axis view and by MRI (1.5 T field strength, 40 mT/m gradients, cine-TrueFISP) in 4 chamber view. Enddiastolic (EDV) and endsystolic (ESV) volumes as well as left ventricular muscle masses (LVMM) were evaluated by a single-plane ellipsoid model. In addition MRI short axis scans were performed in 23 patients to use Simpson rule (ARGUS software) to determine the above parameters. Results: Correlation between EBT and MRI ellipsoid model is r = 0.87 (95 %-confidence interval is 0.76 to 0.93) for EDV, r = 0.92 (0.85 to 0.96) for ESV and r = 0.82 (0.68 to 0.90) for LVMM. Correlation between EBT and MRI Simpson approach is r = 0.92 (0.81 to 0.96) for EDV, r = 0.93 (0.83 to 0.97) for ESV and r = 0.79 (0.55 to 0.91) for LVMM, respectively. Relative standard deviations of the differences of single paired measurements varied in the range of 15 % to 25 %. Conclusion: Both EBT and MR methods may be used to determine left ventricular volumes and mass. The differences of standard deviations implicate the need to determine ranges of normal values for all evaluation approaches in clinical routine. Background: Several tumor-host biological factors seem to be valuable predictors for the prognosis of patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck, such as the peritumoral lymphocytic infiltration (PLI) or a sharp tumor border. In particular, significant associations have been reported between the presence of PLI and the absence of cervical adenopathy. Preoperative biopsy specimens are often insufficient for an evaluation of these criteria. Therefore, this study was performed to examine whether an elevation of peritumoral CT-values correlates with the presence of PLI. Moreover, correlations with present cervical adenopathy were obtained to check whether an elevation of peritumoral CT-values can be regarded valuable in predicting a prognosis. Methods: In total, 45 patients with primarily resected SCC were involved (pT1 = 8, pT2 = 13, pT3 = 9, pT4 = 15); 28 patients were pN-positive. All tumors were histopathologically analyzed regarding the presence of PLI and a sharp or infiltrating tumor border. Based on standardized CT examinations, repeated ROI-based density measurements were obtained in vital parts of the tumor boundary. Statistics were performed to find dependencies between PLI, pattern of tumor invasion, cervical adenopathy, T classification, and CT densities. Results: Our results show that an elevated peritumoral CT-density is a highly specific and sensitive sign for the presence of PLI. Moreover, there were significant statistical correlations of present PLI and elevated peritumoral CT-values with absent regional lymph node metastases.",

Mansour; Jeddah/SA Purpose: To evaluate the role of MRI in the prediction of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) response to radiotherapy. Material and methods: 52 NPC patients had MRI before and after radiotherapy to the local disease and to the nodal involvement. The MRI assessed the size, site, signal intensity, enhancement pattern and extension of the regional disease in 25 anatomical sites. Radiotherapy was delivered using X-rays of 4 -6 MV Linac. Purpose: Head and neck tumors show considerable variation in perfusion pattern and biological behavior as well as response to chemoradiation. The high frequent acquisition of multislice CT data after a contrast medium bolus allows quantification of tumor perfusion. The aim of this study was to assess therapy-induced changes of tumor perfusion early after initiation of treatment. Methods and materials: Dynamic MSCT was performed in 22 patients with histologically proven head and neck cancer before and 3 weeks after initiation of chemoradiation. After bolus injection of 80 ml contrast medium, two 10 mm-sections through the largest tumor region were scanned for 40 s (Siemens SOMATOM Volume Zoom). The arterial input function was derived from the largest arterial vessel in the field of view. Perfusion values were calculated using graphical analysis and displayed as parametric color coded images. Standardized circular regions of interest were drawn on the area displaying highest perfusion. The tumor area was determined by the product of the maximum perpendicular diameters. Results: At baseline, all tumor lesions were visible in parametric images by enhanced perfusion values (0.474 ml/min/ml \u00b1 0.212), however the perfusion pattern was very inhomogeneous. The tumor area was 1007 mm 2 \u00b1 736. Three weeks after initiation of chemoradiation, tumor perfusion increased to 0.493 ml/min/ml \u00b1 0.214, whereas tumor area decreased to 734 mm 2 \u00b1 960.

A BMI of 35 was found to be a threshold over which all patients needed 60 mAs. Conclusions: LDMRDCT with 30 mAs in patients with normal weight and with 60 mAs in those with BMI greater than 35 is an accurate method for assessment of ureteric lithiasis, resulting in a dose similar to a 3 film IVU. MDCT was used with 4 \u00d7 1.0 mm collimation, 100 mAs, and 120 kV (CTDI = 11.4 mGy). We compared 3 reconstruction protocols (slicewidth/reconstruction interval: 1.5/0.7 mm, 3/1.5 mm, 5/2.5 mm). In addition, multiplanar reconstructions (MPR) in coronal plane were performed. 3 experienced readers analyzed each scan.

There was also no significant difference between performed protocols in evaluation of additional findings. Conclusion: Axial reconstruction protocols (1.5/0.7 mm, 3/1.5 mm, 5/2.5 mm) are equally suited in the diagnosis of urinary stone disease. Coronal MPR's are helpful in the evaluation of precise stone location, however very small calculi may be missed on 5 mm coronal reconstructions.

Solair sr., C. Tuchmann sr., C. Saussine sr., D. Jacqmin sr.; Strasbourg/FR Purpose: To assess the accuracy and usefulness of virtual endoscopy (VE) by MR to study moderate dilated renal cavities. Method/materials: 33 patients, having excretory tumours (n = 18), calculi (n = 11), and extrinsic compressions (n = 4) underwent MRU (1 T Philips) using T2 3D TSE (TR/eTE: 1800/500 ms, ETL: 130, 80 slices, slice thickness: 0.6 mm, 256 \u00d7 256, FOV: 240, TA: 4 min 21 s. VE were reconstructed using volume rendering and were interpreted (MIP reconstructions, sources images) by two radiologists. Correlation was made with conventional endoscopy/pathological findings. Results: Mean operator time was 20 min. Endoluminal masses (up to 3 mm) were depicted by source images and VE, but missed by MIP in 5 cases (2 tumours, 3 stones). Morphologic assessment (smooth or irregular surface, position, number, surface extension) was more pertinent on VE than on sources images. Blood clots (3 cases) were misdiagnosed as tumoural polyps. A smooth surface with abrupt margins was present for all stones and in 8 cases of tumoural process. An irregular surface was only present in tumoural processes. VE images did not allow evidence of intramural extension of the tumour. Assessment of surface alone did not allow to differentiate between a calculus from a smooth polyp. Conclusions: VE is easily feasible in moderate or non dilated renal cavities. It permits precise location and number of filling defects with delineation of the surface extension. It is not really time consuming and it seems to be a promising modality for optimal visualization of pelvo-caliceal pathology. In 2 patients the process progressed to abscess formation. Retracted cortical scars in 9 patients reflected the healing phase. The IVU was normal in 16 of 18 patients with early lesions showing minimal delay of contrast excretion in the collecting system in 2 patients. Conclusions: Early cortico-medullary and nephrographic phase spiral CTs are highly sensitive in detection of compromised parenchyma in the pyramids indicating papillary necrosis and thereby allow treatment at a time when the disease process is still reversible. Methods/materials: We minimize patient dose by adapting the tube current to anatomy in two ways: a local projection angle dependent tube current modulation that minimizes the current for projections of low attenuation is combined with a global tube current control that adapts the tube current 360\u00b0 mean level to the anatomic level. Our method uses the projections currently scanned to \"foresee\" the behavior while scanning the next 180\u00b0 segment. Based on user-defined image quality parameters (selected by choosing the desired reconstruction kernel and the image noise standard deviation in HU) the tube current curve is computed. The approach has been tested in simulations and phantom measurements on a Somatom Volume Zoom scanner (Siemens, Forchheim, Germany). To further reduce the projection noise we have implemented a raw data-based MAF approach. It locally smoothes the projection values of highest attenuation. MAF is utilized as a preprocessing step during image reconstruction; the algorithms are implemented on the Syngo Explorer workstation (VAMP, Moehrendorf, Germany). Results: MAF reduces image noise by up to 50 % and thereby allows for respective dose reduction. The combination of AEC and MAF allows to secure this reduction and to increase it further. Conclusions/discussion: The combination of AEC and MAF allows to greatly reduce patient dose for a given image quality over complete anatomical ranges. The user simply specifies the desired image quality instead of setting the \"mAs-value\" or other parameters.",

Conclusion: Due to the interdependence of noise and resolution, which is an intrinsic property of tomographic reconstruction from projections, it can be predicted that the dose necessary for constant noise level and unchanged object size will increase by a factor of x 3/2 when the resolution element is reduced by 1/x. This has direct implications for future CT systems that employ flat panel detectors with sampling distances down to 0.1 mm, thereby yielding a tenfold improved resolution compared to today's high-end CT scanners. Method and materials: 50 patients with head and neck tumours were scanned using a multislice CT scanner (SOMATOM Volume Zoom, Siemens Medical Solutions, Germany) with a high resolution protocol. Reconstruction was performed using dedicated reconstruction software (ImpactIR, VAMP GmbH, Germany) with the standard algorithm and the MAF approach. We measured the noise for 6 anatomical regions at the level of the humeral heads. Image quality, image noise and the diagnostic value comparing the standard reconstructions to the multidimensional adaptively filtered images was rated.",

Methods and materials: Spiral ECG-gated contrast-enhanced 1 mm retrospectively reconstructed scans were performed on patients with heart rates ranging from 49 to 75 bpm using four-slice CT (Marconi Mx8000) at a temporal resolution of 250 ms. Using landmarks along the proximal regions of the coronary arteries (left main and anterior descending (LM and LAD), right coronary artery (RCA) and left circumflex (LCX)), we obtained estimates of 3D position and velocity of these arteries during a cardiac cycle. Identifying phases with minimum velocity, we correlated the image quality in these regions with the estimates obtained. Results: Motion characteristics varied depending on the artery, with the highest degree of motion being observed for RCA. The points at which the lowest velocities occurred correlated well with the images in which the arteries could be best viewed. Though more than one minimum was observed within a heart cycle for all arteries, the most consistent image quality was observed at 70 -85 % of the cardiac cycle.",

Breath hold T1W GRE images were obtained. Quantitative image analysis was performed of the signal intensity of the liver and in background air anterior and lateral to the patient. A qualitative analysis of the subjective image quality was also done, and the adverse reactions were registered. Results: The groups were homogeneous regarding age, sex and weight distribution. No significant differences in the signal intensity of the liver and in the incoherent noise measurements were found between both groups. Gastrointestinal noise was statistically lower for the butylscopolamine group compared to the control group. There was also a statistical difference in the image quality between groups: optimal studies were only found in the butylscopolamine group. Regading adverse events, there was non-significant differences between groups. To define the spiral CT findings in patients with superior mesenteric vein (SMV) thrombosis and to compare these with surgical findings. Material and method: Abdominal CT examination of 12 patients with partial or total SMV thrombosis were retrospectively reviewed by two radiologists. The level of the thrombus, patency of portal vein and intestinal findings were noted. These findings compared with the surgical findings in patients who were operated following SMV thrombosis. Results: In 10 of the 12 patients (83.3 %) there was complete thrombosis of SMV and 2 patients (16.7 %) thrombus was partial and non-occlusive. In one patient with complete SMV thrombosis, air was observed within SMV and portal vein. Portal vein was totally thrombosed in 8 patients (66.7 %), partially thrombosed in 2 patients (16.7 %) and patent in 2 patients (16.7 %). All 10 patients with complete thrombosis SMV were operated and SMV thrombosis was confirmed in these patients. Small bowel resection was performed in 9 patients and sigmoid colon resection was performed in 1 patient. Ischemic changes in small bowel could be detected preoperatively in 8 of the 9 patients who had small bowel resection. Colonic wall thickening was observed in 5 patients including the patient with sigmoid resection. Colonic ischemia was not confirmed by surgical findings in other 4 patients. Conclusion: Spiral CT can reliably demonstrate the presence, level and extent of the SMV thrombus. Spiral CT can also detect ischemic changes in the intestine and especially small bowel findings correlate well with the surgical findings.

Material and methods: We examined 61 patients with preoperative histologically proven breast cancer. In 34 patients conventional axillary dissection was performed, 27 patients underwent excision of sentinel lymph node (s). Clinical examination was performed independently. Sonographic criteria included lymph node size, form, shape, presence or absence of hilar reflex, echogeneity, cortical rim thickening and vascularisation. Results: Ultrasonography detected 0 -7 lymph nodes (mean 2.66) were detected in Level 1 and 0 -2 (mean 0.5) in Level 2.

The lack of detection of micrometastases and of lymph nodes smaller than 5 mm is still a problem. The false positive rate (7) could possibly be decreased by an optimised combination of morphologic aspects. With a negative predictive value of 89.5 % ultrasonography can be a powerful tool in pre-selection for SLN biopsy and the necessary follow-up of these patients. .5 G needle with appendant coil was used. After the procedure the distance from the coil artefact to the lesion was measured in two planes (sagittal, transverse). All lesions have been histologically proven by excisional biopsy 12 to 72 hours after the MR-guided localisation. Results: Localisation and excision of the lesion was successful in all cases. Each MR-guided procedure lasted 45 -150 minutes (mean 66 min). 20 % (11/55) of the lesions were malignant. In most cases (75 %, 41/55) the coil was placed immediately adjacent to the lesion. The coil was placed up to 10 mm and 11 -15 mm (mean distance 1.8 mm, range 0 -15, SD 3.5) away from the lesion in 20 % (11/55) and 6 % (3/55) of cases respectively.

Groenemeyer 1 , H.G.

This system pulls DICOM images, DICOM Presentation States and findings out of the RIS and PACS to transfer them to an HTML learning text whitin an embedded DICOM viewer. Methods and materials: A radiologist will select a few images and send them to the teaching system together with the finding and Presentation States. A learning text will then be extracted out of the finding. This text will be converted to an HTML page with an embedded Java-based DICOM viewer to visualize the medical images. Within the HTML text, buttons will provide a context-referred view of the images via DICOM Presentation States. So all that radilogists will have to do, is to perhaps correct some text phrases or the layout. Results: The result is a teaching system with its contents pulled out of the normal radiological workflow making it possible to transfer DICOM images, Presentation States and findings to interactive learning texts. DICOM images can be freely manipulated and Presentation States can be applied to achieve a context-referred view of medical images. Conclusion: The efficiency of learning can be increased by being as close as possible to the real-life diagnostics and by making the images available for free manipulation.

Debatin; Essen/DE Purpose: To improve the workflow in a radiological department with central scheduling, by introducing a radiological call center (RCC) Method/materials: With a separate module of our RIS (Radiological Information System) we were able to introduce a central electronic scheduling. Appointment schemes were created for all work places, time table-based or list-based. One central telephone number was assigned to the newly etablished Radiological Call Center. Rules were created for scheduling, and staff were trained by a telephone and marketing coach. Results: With central electronic scheduling, the task of scheduling is removed from every workplace and focused on one center with specially trained staff. This center is an efficient tool offering flexible workload balancing. Information about daily workload is available for every employee. Especially helpful in workflow optimization was the introduction of 'virtual work places' were patients can be scheduled for urgent investigations and directed to the next available appointment. Conclusions: Central scheduling by a Radiological Call Center improves workflow and enables a department to (re)direct patient flow and balance work load. Inherent advantages were optimis ation of investigation strategies and avoidance of double/unnecessary investigations. Acceptance of referrers is good (only one central telephone number!), especially when offering add-ons like a radiological advice service.",

When the bladder was filled of contrast-material-enhanced urine, the patient in supine position was asked to urinate. During the micturition T1-weighted spoiled 3D-gradient-echo acquisitions on sagittal plane were performed (Acq.Time: 12 s). These acquisitions were post-processed with MIP algorithm. 15 patients performed retrograde and micturating conventional cystourethrography in the month preceding MRI. One patient was unable to perform the exam because of the inability to urinate in the supine position. Results: We always obtained perfect evaluation of the male urethra with voiding MR-cystourethrography. The visualization of the urethra with MIP reconstructed images was considered comparable to that obtained with conventional cystourethrography. The analysis of 3D sagittal scans allowed a better evaluation of the urethral strictures in comparison with conventional cystourethrography. We detected 10 cases of bladder neck obstruction, 12 cases of urethral stricture and 3 case of benign prostatic hypertrophy Conclusions: Voiding MR-cystourethrography demonstrates the morphology of the bladder neck and urethra during the micturition and can a substitute for standard retrograde and micturating cystourethrogram, avoiding radiation exposure to the gonads.

Petrovitch, S.O.R. Pfleiderer, T.U. Schreiber, W.A. Kaiser; Jena/DE Purpose: Non-radicular low back pain (LBP) is a leading cause for compensation in industrialised countries with high socioeconomic impact. In the past it was mostly described by structural deficiencies, but not by disturbance of functional spinal segments or the instantaneous axis of rotation. Methods: 45 out-patients (age 22 -85 a; 22 males, 23 females) with suspected vertebral instability were included. General health and orthopedic status was evaluated at admittance. Health status was evaluated using the self-administered SF-36 questionnaire, which includes eight scales of functional health. A self administered pain score was evaluated using the visual pain analogue scale (VAS). The motion of the lumbar spine was analysed in lateral and AP projections using radiographs and in all three main axis of rotation with the topometric motion analysis system. Results: Compared to norm-based population scores for Europe and North America, values are reduced below one standard deviation in almost all items using the SF-36-questionaire. The items body pain and physical function are decreased by two standard deviations (SD) and role physical has a score reduced by more than three SD. Where heavy pain was reported, the correlation between disturbed physical and mental scores was high (r = 0.8950; p < 0.001), but no correlation to radiographic spondylolisthesis could be observed. Conversely, a good correlation between reduced physical score (SF-36), pain and disturbed instantaneous axis of rotation was observed in 3D-topometry (r = 0.6820, p < 0.01).",

All pM MSCT studies had been performed on a four-slice CT scanner using the following parameters: slice thickness of 1 mm, reconstruction increment of 0.7 mm, field-of-view 15 (cervical)/20 (lumbar) cm. Subsequently data postprocessing to multi-and curviplanar reconstructions was performed. In addition, the radiation exposure was assessed by calculating the effective dose values. Results: MSCT yielded additional diagnostic information, termed as clinically significant in 60 % of the studies. Due to the resulting voxel size of about 0.4 \u00d7 0.4 \u00d7 0.8 mm multiplanar imaging of the spinal pathology in all planes with excellent image quality was possible. Typical image artefacts at the cervico-thoracic junction as well as due to metallic implants were significantly reduced. The effective dose amounted to 2.8 mSv (cervical spine) and 6.2 mSv (lumbar spine). Conclusion: PM spinal MS-CT is a useful tool in assessing multisegmental spinal pathology in patients in whom MR imaging is either contraindicated or not compatible with the clinical findings. In terms of radiation exposure, careful restriction of the scan area to the clinically relevant segments seems to be more important than the type of helical CT, i.e. single-vs. multi-slice. Results: There were five women and one men, mean age of 66 years. A diabetes mellitus was present in half cases. Mean delay between vertebral collapse and the infectious syndrome was 12 days. Staphylococcus aureus, E coli, Salmonella enteritidis, were the identified pathogens. Bone biopsy isolated the pathogen in two third of cases, and was the sole positive sample in one third of cases. A thoracic vertebra was involved in three cases, a lumbar one in three cases. Lysis of the spongious bone associated with a soft tissue mass thicker than 8 mm was observed in five cases.

The patients were imaged using radiography, functional radiographic examination, CT and MRI. Plain films, CT and MRI were analysed in a qualitative fashion. Results: Radiography demonstrated a calcified nucleus pulposus which was flattened, oval or round. In 10 patients more than one disc space was calcified. Additional radiographic findings included widening or narrowing of the disc space and moderate flattening of the vertebral bodies. In 6 cases functional abnormalities were revealed at the level of disc calcifications. CT clearly demonstrated hyperdense disc calcifications with posterior disc protrusion in 4 cases and extrusion into the epidural space in one patient. Calcifications were shown as signal void areas by MRI. There were also discrete signal intensity changes of bone marrow below the endplates.

Method/materials: A total of 69 CT-guided corticosteriod injections of the SIJs were performed in 42 children with inflammatory back pain (IBP): 27 bilateral, 15 unilateral. Forty milligrams of a crystalline longacting corticoid was instilled in each inflamed joint. All 42 patients underwent continuous clinical follow-up at 10 week intervals after corticosteroid injection to a maximum of 18 months. Intensity of back pain before and after the intervention was graded on an visual analogue scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (very severe pain). Dynamic contrast-enhanced (Gd-DTPA, 0.1 mmol/kg body weight) MRI with quantitative determination of contrast enhancement was performed in all patients before the intervention and 8 \u00b1 4 months after therapy.

MR Images where correlated with the results of clinical examinations. Results: Depending on the time from radiation therapy, radiation osteitis showed different signal intensities. The acquired images suggest that signal changes in T2 weighted images as well as the different enhancement behaviour of radiation osteitis might be dependent on the time from radiation therapy. Best visualisation of regions with even low contrast enhancement was achieved with fat-saturated sequences. Computed tomography showed increased density in the affected regions corresponding to osteosclerosis. In all cases at least one iliosacral joint was affected with different topographies in sacral and iliac bone. Conclusion: MRI is helpful in detecting and characterizing ORN and eases the demarcation from secondary manifestations of the known malignancy. Changes in signal intensity, based on histopatholocical tissue changes, might make a chronological classification possible. The purpose of this on going study is to evaluate the usefulness of whole body MRI in the diagnosis of the inflammatory myopathy seen in polymyositis and to assess the disease extent in affected patients. Materials and methods: Eight patients with laboratory, muscle biopsy and electromyographic evidence of probable or definite polymyositis were referred for imaging. An additional patient was referred for MR to identify a potential site for muscle biopsy. 16 Coronal turbo STIR images were taken in each of three or four body regions (TR/TE/TI; 2400/40/160 ms). Acquisition time per region was 3 minutes 30 seconds, with a total scan time of approximately 30 minutes. Results: Mean patient age was 43.5 years (32 to 57 years). One patient with \"probable\" polymyositis by conventional criteria had a normal scan. One patient with polymyositis had inflammation in a myofascial distribution in the gluteal region. Two patients had florid symmetrical myopathy involving proximal upper and lower limb girdle muscles, psoas, intercostal muscles and neck flexors and extensors. In addition, mild involvement of the calf muscles was also seen. Three patients had more patchy asymmetrical muscle involvement, but also demonstrated involvement of psoas, intercostal and neck muscles. Conclusion: Whole body MRI gives a much more extensive assessment of muscle involvement in Polymyositis than the conventional MR protocols used to image these conditions. Extensive muscle involvement of psoas, intercostal, neck and distal limb muscle groups were diagnosed. These muscle groups are not imaged on standard sequence protocols. The posterior half of the lateral tibial plateau and the lateral half of the medial femoral condyle were statistically more frequently involved than their corresponding halves (p < 0.0001 for both parameters). The bare area of the medial, but not of the lateral tibial plateau is more frequently involved than the meniscus-covered area (p < 0.0001). The meniscuscovered area of the lateral tibial plateau was more frequently involved than that of the medial tibial plateau (p < 0.0001). Results: MRI allowed a good identification of the sites of osteochondral cylinder remotion (\"donor\" sites) and of the treated lesion sites at the 5 month MRI. Small ferromagnetic particles artifacts due to surgical instruments were often present, with limitation of diagnostic value, in particular the \"gap\" regions between cylinders and health tissue were not individuated. Only the oldest two patients showed mild inflammatory signs (intraarticular fluid collection, synovial hypertrophy) at the 5 and 10 month MRI. No case of donor site degeneration was seen at the 5 and 10 month MRI. In all cases, the sites of treated lesions showed regularity of subchondral bone and the fillling-repair of donor sites at the 10 month MRI. Evaluation of the chondral portion was very difficult due to artifacts. Conclusions: MRI allows a good evaluation of knee chondral implant healing, especially of the subchondral bone repair and seems to be a good diagnostic tool, avoiding invasive examination.

            "text": "The investigations were performed on the \"SIEMENS SONOLINE Elegra\" ultrasound system using SieScape panoramic imaging with a 7.5 -13 MHz frequency linear transducer. A group of 956 patients, 10 -75 years of age, with complaints of knee joint pain were included in this study. 738 patients were diagnosed as having knee joint degenerative-dystrophic changes. The early stage is characterized by a normal or decreased hyaline cartilage thickness of the femoral condyle. Ultrasound studies detected increased echogenity of the cartilage surface, existence of freely floating 0.4 -0.6 mm crystals in the joint cavity and suprapatellar synovial bursa. The same type of crystals, in addition to insignificant synovitis, were found in sportsmen and dancers who exercised vigorously. In the case of difficulties in examining the lateral patellar and medial inferiorlongitudinal surface the existence of crystals was revealed during its maximum displacement from the condyles of the femur. In severe cases, examination revealed marginal joint osteophytes, margin skipping of cartilage surface, discontinuous contour of the femoral condylar bony surface, narrowing or complete disappearance of joint space and the existence of hypertrophic synovial membrane and villi and Baker's cysts. As a result, Pan Zoom mode is used to detect joint crystals, to study in details the structure of hyaline cartilage, fluid and to identify their minimal changes, which helps to diagnose degenerative-dystrophic changes of the knee joint. Multislice spiral CT (Somatom Plus 4 Volume Zoom, Siemens, Germany) examination was performed after standard oral colonoscopy preparation and colonic distension with room air. Images were obtained using 2.5 mm slice collimation; 3.0 mm slice thickness; 1.0 mm reconstruction interval; 17.5 mm/s table speed; kVp, 140; and mAs 10. Supine and prone acquisitions were obtained in all patients. Dose exposure was calculated. Images were directly reviewed on a dedicated workstation by two experienced gastrointestinal radiologists using a software with volume-rendering capabilities (Vitrea 2.2, Vital Images, USA). Conventional colonoscopy was performed on the same day in all patients and represented the standard of reference. Results: All colorectal cancers were correctly identified at CT colonography (9/9, sensitivity 100 %). CT colonography also detected 12 of 14 polyps (sensitivity, 85.7 %). Both false-negative findings were represented by lesions smaller than 5 mm. Dose exposure (CTDI) never exceeded 1.37 mGy for each scan. Conclusion: Although studies on larger series are certainly needed, our preliminary experience demonstrates that ultra-low-dose scanning is a feasible and accurate option for multislice CT colonography. This technique allows to scan the patient in both supine and prone positions with a radiation exposure lower than that of a double contrast barium enema, which is of paramount importance to introduce this imaging modality in screening programs. Results: Of 264 cancers diagnosed in this cohort, 260 were detected by CT colonography. 3 were missed in our early experience with single slice spiral CT. 2 were flat cancers < 5 mm thick. 1 was a polypoid tumour hidden by residue in a poorly prepared patient. This was obvious on a repeat study with adequate preparation. One recently missed cancer was in a co-existent acute diverticulitis and was described as suspicious for malignancy only. There were 18 false positive diagnoses of cancer. All but 2 were cases of diverticulitis or IBD. In only 2 cases was no lesion found at laparotomy or repeated colonoscopy. 2.5 % of patients failed to complete their preparation or did not attend for scanning. This was no different to other complex CT examinations. 7 % of studies were sub-optimal (poor preparation, no IV access, could not lie prone etc). Only 1 patient could not be scanned. Conclusion: CT colonography is remarkably robust with a sensitivity of 98.5 % and a specificity of 98.4 % for the detection of colorectal cancer.",

Lees; London/GB Purpose: Whilst the finest collimation possible with adequate signal to noise may seem desirable, fine collimation results in increased radiation dose and generates very large data sets. This increases expense, slows down analysis and 3D reconstruction times. We studied the impact of 1.25, 2.5 and 5 mm slice width on polyp detection and cancer staging. Methods and materials: 55 symptomatic patients, 22 male, referred for CT colography \u00b1 virtual colonoscopy underwent multislice CT following standard bowel prep, bowel paralysis and rectal air insufflation. Scans were performed with 1 mm collimation, effective slice width 1.25 mm, pitch 5, 0.5 s rotation time following IV contrast. Retrospective reconstructions were performed at 1.25 mm, 3 mm and 5 mm. 1.5 and 2.5 mm overlap was used for the 3 and 5 mm data sets respectively. Scans were analysed for the presence of lesions and any cancers detected staged. All patients had colonoscopic correlation and where cancer was detected the resected specimen was also included in the analysis. Results: There were 23 cancers and 25 polyps. Finer sections aided separate detection of small nodes but this did not impact staging. Overall there was no difference in cancer staging between the three data sets. There was no difference in the number of polyps detected on the 1.25 and 3 mm data sets. Small polyps were smeared out on the 5 mm data sets. Conclusion: 2.5 mm slice width appears to be adequate for multislice colography. Previous studies have shown no beneficial effect of using IV glucagons as a spasmolytic for CT colonography. Studies of barium enema examinations, however, have shown that Buscopan may be a more potent spasmolytic in the colon compared with glucagon. The use of Buscopan in CT colonography has not been tested to date. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of IV Buscopan on colonic distention and polyp detection when used as a muscle relaxant in CT colonography Methods: 70 patients undergoing CT colonography were randomized to receive iv Buscopan or no muscle relaxant prior to air insufflation and scanning. Patients were scanned in both supine and prone positions using a multislice helical CT acquisition. For the purposes of reporting, the colon was subdivided into 6 different segments, yielding a total of 12 colonic segments per patient. The degree of luminal distention of each segment was scored on a scale from 1 to 4. The accuracy of CT colonography for polyp detection was based on findings at subsequent conventional colonoscopy.",

Gd-DTPA. Results: In a retrospective evaluation, lymph node staging using the contrast enhanced endorectal and body-coil MRI studies was based on the following criteria: stage N0 designated failure to identify nodal structures with a diameter larger than 3 mm in the imaging volume including the perirectal space and the pelvic structures, and stage N1 designated visualization of four or less nodes larger than 3 mm in diameter. In our series eleven patients (n = 11) had histopathologically proven lymph node stage N1; all other patients (n = 12) were stage N0. We were able to depict the enlarged and involved lymph nodes in eight of eleven patients with stage N1. We staged correctly nine of twelve patients with stage N0 (sensitivity of 85 % and specificity of 72 %). Conclusions: High-resolution contrast endorectal MRI was excellent for depicting perirectal nodes larger than 3 mm in diameter. Further studies are necessary to assess the architecture, geometry, and contrast-enhancement characteristics of lymph nodes to improve higher specificity.

Br\u00fcning, A. Knez, C. Thilo, M.F. Reiser; Munich/DE Objective: To determine optimal contrast concentrations and injection rates for detecting coronary stenoses with multi-slice CT (MSCT) angiography. Materials and methods: 60 patients, 4 groups of 15 patients, underwent MSCT (Somatom VolumeZoom, Siemens) with different contrast protocols: (A) 300 mg iodine/ml at 2.5 ml/s; (B) 300 mg/ml at 3.5 ml/s; (C) 400 mg/ml at 2.5 ml/s; (D) 400 mg/ml at 3.5 ml/s (Byk Gulden, Konstanz, Germany). Assessment of location and degree of coronary stenoses was compared with cardiac catheter. Results: The faster injection rates resulted in higher enhancement compared with the lower injection rates at both iodine concentrations (210.9 \u00b1 34.2 HU (A) versus 366.6 \u00b1 84.2 HU (D)). Diagnoses of significant stenoses obtained by MSCT were confirmed by coronary angiography in 37 out of 43 patients (86 %). Among those with false negative results there were 3 patients in whom MSCT failed to determine significant stenoses in the coronary arteries. The diagnostic findings as described in MSCT were not consistent with angiography with regard to localisation and degree of stenoses: In 42 % of cases, the degree of the most severe stenosis was identical in MSCT and cardiac catheter. Conclusion: Superior coronary enhancement was achieved with higher iodine concentrations and flow rates. However, MSCT with any contrast protocol was unable to achieve the diagnostic level of coronary angiography in assessing location and degree of significant coronary stenoses. Therefore further improvement of spatial and temporal resolution in MSCT-technique is required.",

Non-enhancing isointense lesions and normal white matter didn't reveal any biexponentional behavior. Linear regression between monoexponential T2 relaxation time and MTR measurements demonstrated excellent correlation for DWM, very good correlation for \"black hole\" lesions, good correlation for isointense lesions, moderate correlation for hypointense lesions and non-significant correlation for homogeneous enhancing plaques, NAWM and NWM. Conclusion: Biexponential behavior is more evident on plaques with high degree of demyelination and homogeneous enhancing lesions when using conventional sequences with long first echo time. A strong correlation between MTR and T2 values in regions where either inflammation or demyelination is present was found while when both pathological conditions coexist this linear relation is destroyed. Method and materials: MRI of 24 pediatric patients affected with definite MS (13 male and 11 female; mean age 15) and 20 with ADEM (7 male and 13 female; mean age 12) were retrospectively evaluated to identify differences in the morphology, location and post-contrast behavior of the demyelinating lesions at the onset of the disease. Clinical and laboratory data were not used. Plain T2 and T1weighted sequences were always available, FLAIR in only 30 % of more recent cases; i.v. contrast injection was done in 18 ADEM and 21 MS patients. Results: Lesions in ADEM patients were multiple in all but 1 case and in 16/19 cases were more then 3; 10/20 cases infratentorial region was involved; gray matter involvement was present in 10/20 and thalamus was the most common involved (6/20); corpus callosum was involved in 2/20 cases; contrast enhancement was present in 16/18 cases; a \"lumpy-bumpy\" effect was never remarkable. Conclusion and discussion: Differentiation of MS and ADEM has an high prognostic significance. Clinical and laboratory data may often overlap between the two demyelinating disorders. Even though single MRI findings can be non specific, the global evaluation of each patient leads to a differential diagnosis in more then 90 % of cases. Results: MRI of the brain revealed no abnormality in the 7 patients who had lower plasma FA levels both in the last 5 years and on the day of MRI (mean 474.0 and 510.9 mmol/l respectively). However, the 3 patients who had demyelination changes detected on MRI had average plasma FA levels in the last 5 years and on the day of MRI of 768.6 and 1026.0 mmol/l respectively. No difference of IQ between both subgroups were observed. Conclusion: The low number of patients within the study group precludes evaluation of the statistical significance of the detected differences, but a trend toward correlation between a degree of metabolic compensation of the disease and a presence of brain lesions can be observed; no correlation was detected between the lesions and a degree of mental development.",

The purpose of this study was to characterize meningitis of different etiology using MT imaging. Methods and materials: One hundred patients with meningitis on post-contrast MT imaging -65 tuberculous, 9 with viral, 9 with fungal, and 17 with pyogenic meningitis -were studied. The visibility of the meninges on pre-contrast MT imaging in different etiologic groups was studied and percentage difference between the mean signal intensity (SI) of the meninges and the mean SI of the surrounding T2 normal brain parenchyma was calculated. The MT ratio was also calculated from the thickened meninges in tuberculous meningitis. The MT ratio could not be calculated in other etiologic groups due to difficulty in the placement of pixel due to thin nature of the meninges and their location in the cerebral sulci.

Marked devel- The purpose of this presentation is to report on the prevalence of cerebrovascular complications in children with AIDS and investigate whether the mode of HIV infection plays a role in the development of this complication. 508 children (ages, 4 months to 17 years) with AIDS were periodically evaluated with pre-contrast CT scans. Further evaluation with MRI was perfomed for patients with either focal neurologic deficits or CT findings other than diffuse atrophy. In five patients MR angiograms and in one conventional angiography were also performed. Eleven children were found to have vascular lesions. Only one had focal neurologic symptoms at the time of diagnosis. Six children were found to have 25 aneurysms. A seventh child had a surgical clip at the site a previously treated anerysm. Eight patients were found to have 27 infarctions. In four of the patients with infarctions, fysiform aneurysms of the cerebral arteries were also identified. Nine of the 11 patients in our study were infected by transplacental route or during blood transfusion in prematurely born infants. In this group of patients the diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease was made earlier (mean, 8.2 years) compared to the two patients that were infected later in life (mean, 14.9 years). There is increased prevalence of cerebrovascular disease in children infected by HIV. The risk is greater if the exposure to the virus took place prior to the 40 th week of gestation. This finding suggests that the immature vessels of the fetuses or the prematurely born children are more vulnerable.",

The indexes of measurement included the cerebral white matter lesion (WML) area, the cerebral infarct area, the ratio of ventricle-to-brain (VBR) and the ratio between the areas of the corpus callosum and supratentorial brain in the midsagittal plane. Discriminant analysis was used to search for the indexes which could contribute significantly to distinguishing the two groups. Results: Small cerebral vessel disease and multi-infarct were two major basal diseases of VaD in this series. The WML areas, the left cortical infarct and VBR were significantly higher and the corpus collsum areas was significantly lower in the VaD group than the SWD group. The indexes that could significantly discriminate the two groups was: callosal atrophy, ventricle-to-brain ratio, white matter lesions area, left cortical infarct area, left parietal infarct area, total cortical infarct area. Conclusions: Callosal atrophy, lateral ventricle enlargement and extensive WML are important predictors of incidence of dementia in the small vessel disease; however, left cortical infarct, especially left parietal infarct, is important predictor of incidence of dementia in the multi-infarct group.",

To determine whether diffusion weighted MRI (DWI) contributes to the differential diagnosis of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and the parkinsonian variants of multiple system atrophy (MSA-P) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) Methods and materials: Conventional dual-echo fast spin echo and DWI scans were obtained from 12 MSA-P, 13 PD, and 10 PSP patients matched for age and disease duration. DWI was performed using echoplanar imaging with diffusionsensitizing gradients switched in slice direction and three different b-values (30, 300, 1100). Regional apparent diffusion coefficients (rADC) were determined in different brain regions including basal ganglia and pons. Results: Using the Kruskal Wallis test and post hoc testing with the Mann Whitney U test, significant differences in rADCs of the putamen (0.85 vs. 0.71 s/mm 2 ; p < 0.001) and the caudate nucleus (0.81 vs. 0.72 s/mm 2 ; p = 0.007) were detected between patients with MSA-P and PD. Between PSP and PD patients, significant differences in rADCs were revealed in the putamen (0.87 vs 0.71 s/mm 2 ; p = 0.008) and in the globus pallidus (0.72 vs 0.65 s/mm 2 ; p = 0.006). No significant differences in rADCs were obtained between patients with MSA-P and PSP. Conclusion: The significant higher rADCs in patients with MSA-P (putamen, caudate nucleus) and PSP (putamen, globus pallidus) compared to patients with PD may reflect a more advanced alteration of the CNS tissue integrity due to neuronal loss and gliosis leading to increased random movement of water molecules.",

Two phases were implemented for whole setup procedures. Results: In initial phase started in Oct.99, CT, MRI, RF, DSA and a film digitizer connected to a central archiving system which involved a 300 GByte RAID and a round about 3 TByte DVD jukebox, simultaneously a chinese RIS was installed to implement the computerized management for routine workflow; Full implementation of digital department was completed with three new modalities, a DR, a Digital Mammography and a Digital Radiofluoroscopy installed in Aug. 2000, which realized full electronically archiving of images and initiated a filmless procedure. Central and distributed image store management and auto-routing procedure employed to reduce network traffic and improved processing response of the system. Soft copy image diagnosis and the computerized management of imaging workflow elevate workflow efficiency and improve patients passthrough obviously. The Chinese version RIS, which was developed based on the workflow and routine manage model of typical radiology department of China, has successfully transferred traditional film-based management into a revolutionary efficient and reliable digital management.

To achieve this, the Everything On-Line (EOL) principle was developed based on the ground rule that all images have to be available to the radiologist fast at every workstation at all times (emphasis on retrieval). The EOL PACS is a, WindowsNT\u2122 based, full DICOM solution with a large (last months to years) RAID-5 on-line archive (fast, standardized, scalable) and a large DVD-R on-line backup storage (non-erasable, standardize, scalable), eliminating dependency on workflow management, pre-fetching or auto-routing and increasing the ease of acceptation by radiologists.

Therefore, we developed an application for mobile devices, which are increasingly present like pencils. Methods and materials: Java Mobile-Informations-Device-Profile (MIDP) was selected for development. For data-transfer the http network protocol is used. The image data is available in the DICOM file standard. There is no need of special filepreparation before file access. Stereoscopic images were generated with our previously developed medical interactive stereo-3D visualisation tool. Results: Java was used because of the growing range of java-enabled hardware like mobile phones, personal-digital-assistants and tablet-pcs. The MID-Profile was created especially for limited devices. Our reference application is running on 16 bit color Palm-Organizers. Image files can be accessed through wireless or wired connections. Once the data is retrieved from a server, the images can be viewed, edited and saved. It is also possible to list and edit the Dicom tags and make additional comments. Precalculated 3D-data (e.g. from CT-datasets) based on chromatek visualisation can be displayed stereoscopic on color devices. Summary: The goals of a mobile implementation is not the replacement of medical desktop workstations, but enlargement. The implementation includes methods for intelligent interaction and reduction of drawbacks of limited devices.

Obermayer; St. P\u00f6lten/AT Purpose: While PACS inside hospitals is a widely used technology nowadays, the situation is much different outside hospitals. A new approach offers picture communication to the medical community outside hospitals. While hospitals solutions are \"islands\" with little communication to the outside world, the new system supports communication between all providers of medical services Materials and methods: Application provided PACS allows storage of image data in a professionally organised server farm. Patients are provided with a chipcard containing the name, a unique serial number and a PIN. All doctors authorised by the patient can access the server and load down all images they want using secured lines. Results: Technological requirements and guaranty of privacy of medical data are described. The system has been implemented in a part of Austria. Some 50 physicians up to now take part in this project. Only normal amateur PC equipment is needed on the physician's side, ADSL is recommended for download of DICOM images; for use of JPEG images ISDN standard would be sufficient. Global access of the server is possible. Conclusion: A combination of application provided PACS and a plastic card with a chip can transfer all advantages of hospital PACS into the extra hospital world. As storage costs and costs for telephone lines go down it is to be expected that this internet based system will replace traditional image communication per hardcopy and mail shortly. Purpose: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is limited by artifacts and image distortion in vessels after stenting. With a rigid active magnetic resonance imaging stent (AMRIS) the stent lumen can be illuminated without causing artifacts, however, the use is limited due to the need for surgical placement. A new balloonexpandable stent design enables catheter implantation of the AMRIS. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the imaging properties of this stent in a rabbit model using MR angiography (MRA) and flow measurements.",

After injection of Levovist (4 g; 300 mg/ml), C 3 -Mode\u2122 scans were recorded at the times 20 s, 40 s, 60 s, 2 min, and 3 min. The results of C 3 -Mode\u2122 were compared with CT. Results: After injection of Levovist, C 3 -Mode\u2122 showed homogeneous enhancement (hyperechogenicity) of liver parenchyma at 20 s, 40 s, 60 s, 2 min, and 3 min. In 6 patients, with complete necrosis of HCC at CT, the lesions did not show any intralesional enhancement during C 3 -Mode\u2122 examination (complete agreement with CT). In one nodule, with enhancing intratumoral areas suggestive of viable tumor at CT, C 3 -Mode\u2122 showed hyperechogenicity in the same corresponding areas (agreement with CT). In the remaining patient, CT showed complete necrosis of the nodule. Howewer, enhanced spots along the inferomedial margin of the lesion suggested parenchymal infiltration left untreated by ILP. C 3 -Mode\u2122 did not show enhancement in that area and a biopsy did not show malignancy. No relapse has been observed after 8 months. Follow-up of the patient is in progress. Results: All patients tolerated the procedure well under local anesthesia. The total procedure time was 90 minutes. All complications observed were minor and no further treatment was necessary. Online MR thermometry allowed exact visualization of the extension of laser-induced changes and their relationship to the neighboring anatomy. Lesions up to 2 cm in diameter could be efficiently treated with a single laser application; larger lesions were treated with dual, triple and quadruple simultaneous applications. In 97.5 % we achieved complete necrosis of the tumor and a 5 mm safety margin, resulting in complete destruction of the tumor without local recurrence. Mean survival after the first laser treatment was 3.4 years (95 % confidence interval (CI) 2.5 -4.2 years) and 4.4 years (95 % CI: 3.6 -5.2 years) after the time of diagnoses of the HCC. Conclusion: In hepatic involvement with oligonodular hepatocellular carcinoma, LITT appears to be an effective therapeutic procedure. Results: Before treatment, intratumoral arterial-phase enhancement followed by a hypoechoic appearance in the portal venous and delayed phases was demonstrated by contrast US in 38 (90 %) of 42 HCCs. After RF, all the 32 (84 %) of the 38 HCCs that were found to be necrotic at spiral CT, failed to enhance using contrast US. By contrast, in the six HCCs with residual viable tumor at spiral CT, intratumoral areas of persistent enhancement -corresponding to the enhancing areas at spiral CT -were identified using contrast US. These six nodules were retreated with RF, targeting residual tumor with contrast US guidance. Conclusion: Contrast-enhanced US, performed using C3-mode imaging, shows promise in assessing the therapeutic effect of RF thermal ablation in HCC. Purpose: Cytokine-based gene therapy has been shown to be highly efficient in stimulating an immune response leading to tumor rejection in transplanted tumors. Woodchucks infected with woodchuck-hepatitis virus (WHV) develop orthotopic hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of MR-guided injection of a therapeutic Adenovirus vector into HCCs of woodchucks and to monitor the course of the tumor non-invasively using MRI.",

Methods and materials: A questionnaire survey established which Irish hospitals perform paediatric examinations. Dose measurement, using a combination of TLD and DAP monitoring, is being conducted in a sample of these. In line with European recommendations, diagnostic reference levels are being established for examinations with high effective dose. An evaluation panel is using image assessment criteria derived from those of the European Commission to assign objective image quality scores. Correlation of dose and image quality allows proposals for optimal techniques for paediatric examinations. Results: There is a wide spectrum of paediatric practise nation-wide, in terms of caseload, equipment used, and technique applied. This has significant impact on the range of patient dose for similar investigations, and on the diagnostic quality of the images produced. Comprehensive analysis of image quality is difficult, and in paediatrics, is complicated by the fact that essential image details depend heavily on the clinical situation. An absolute image quality measure such that the lowest achievable dose for an examination may be specified is being sought.",

Optimisation demands that image quality is evaluated in clinical radiographs -in paediatrics this requires consideration of the clinical context of the request. Does an absolute image quality measure exist? Purpose: To investigate in a controlled patient study the potential of online tube current modulation in subsecond multi-slice spiral CT (MSCT) examinations of children to reduce dose without loss in image quality. Method/materials: Dose can be reduced for non-circular patient cross-sections without an increase in noise if tube current is reduced at those angular positions where the patient diameter and, consequently, attenuation is small. We investigated a pre-release product version of an online control for the tube current integrated in a SOMATOM VZ with improved technical performance. We evaluated image quality, noise and dose reduction for examinations with online tube current modulation in 50 MSCT of the thorax and the abdomen. We evaluated mAs for tube current modulation and compared to the mAs in standard protocols. Image quality was rated as very good, good and poor in a consensus by three radiologists. Noise was assessed in comparison to a control group and by phantom measurements. Results: Dose was reduced typically by 20 to 37 %, depending on the patient geometry and anatomical region (thorax 25 to 29 %, abdomen 20 to 37 %). In general, no loss of image quality was observed. Measured noise did not change significantly. In some cases the noise pattern was improved. Online tube current modulation is now used as a standard in multi-slice spiral CT at our institution. Conclusions: Dose in multi-slice spiral CT examinations of children can be reduced substantially in routine examinations by online tube current modulation without a loss of image quality.",

The purpose of this study is to review characteristic signs of callosal abnormality and try to find a correlation with the degree of clinical disability. Material and methods: MRI examinations were performed in patients with developmental delay. Imaging included T1 and T2-weighted sequences in all cases. All patients had a thorough neuropaediatric clinical examination. The MRI images were evaluated regarding the degree of callosal hypoplasia, presence of a fornix and hippocampus, hydrocephalus and concomitant further abnormalities. Results: Seven different forms of malformation of the corpus callosum were encountered. In particular the development of the fornix and hippocampus differed significantly as did the amount of clinical disability. As a hippocampal commissure is a prerequisite of normal hippocampal development, the size of the temporal lobes depended on the degree of this midline abnormality.

The relevance of the concomitant aplasia of the limbic system has not been addressed in detail before in the literature. Purpose: To evaluate the role of CT and CT angiography in the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary cystic and adenomatoid malformations in the newborn and young children. Methods and materials: Nine children aged between 2 days and 5 months with respiratory failure and cystic pulmonary malformations underwent conventional CT and CT angiography. Lung abnormalities were present on all the chest radiographs prior to CT. The abnormalities had varying appearances; 2 resembled pneumonia, 3 appeared as a mass and 4 as cysts. The CT acquisition protocol included sequential scanning with a 5 mm scan thickness and scan interval, which was followed by high resolution CT in all cases and CT angiography in two. All CT studies were performed under general anaesthesia. The final diagnosis was based on the surgical data and morphologic examination of resected lung tissue in all patients. Results: Morphologic investigation revealed different types of cystic adenomatoid malformation in 6 cases and persistent interstitial emphysema in association with other hallmarks of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in 3 cases. The following types of congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation were found: type I (4), type II (1), type III (1), and the CT data was in close relationship to the morphologic findings. In 3 cases CT showed the presence solitary or multiply lung cysts. Conclusion: CT is a useful diagnostic tool for precise estimation of the extent and differential diagnosis of cystic pulmonary malformations in the newborn and young child with respiratory failure. CT angiography can provide important diagnostic information in the preoperative investigation of pulmonary and mediastinal vessels in these cases. ",

At least one plain radiograph and one CT were obtained before ALBMT and AUBMT respectively. Results: Only 13 CT examinations in clinically complicated cases were peformed after ALBMT. Pathological findings were found in 6/83 (7.2 %). 3/6 (50 %) later died because of infections. Inflammatory pneumonia occured in 3 cases, mycotic infection in 2 cases and pneumonitis after chemotherapy was found in one case. Graft versus host disease was the cause of death in 3/97 cases. 655 CT examinations of patients were performed after AUBMT, mostly to exclude lung metastases and to follow up mediastinal lymph nodes. In 4/7 patients with respiratory symptoms parenchymal changes were found. We diagnosed 1 pneumonitis after chemotherapy, inflamatory pneumonia in 2 cases and mycotic infection in 2 cases. Two patients had clinical symptoms with a negative CT. Only 1/7 (12.5 %) died due to respiratory complications. Conclusion: Different imaging strategies for AUBMT and ALBMT were used. The therapy of pulmonary complications is more complex with ALBMT, but there are frequently diagnosed with plain films. CT is used more frequently after AUBMT in which pulmonary infections are rare and less serious. CT has a decisive role in BMT patients.",

Horgan; Glasgow/GB Purpose: To assess SonoVue enhanced Ultrasound in the measurement of renal haemodynamics in patients with liver metastases. Materials and methods: 10 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with proven liver metastases were studied; non-linear ultrasound imaging (M.I: 0.15 -0.20) of each kidney was performed continuously in a sagittal plane before and after bolus intravenous injection of 2 ml contrast medium (SonoVue, Bracco, Milan). There was a minimum of 10 minutes delay between the examinations of either kidney to allow for contrast clearance from the previous injection. Digital data acquisition over a period of 60 seconds was subsequently recorded for quantification analysis. Timeintensity curves were derived from regions of interests placed over the kidneys. The contrast arrival times (AT), peak amplitude (PA), time to peak (TP) & gradient (G) of the steepest portion of the curves for each kidney were measured. Results: There was no significant difference in all the parameters between the contra-lateral kidneys for both controls and patients with liver metastases.

Ahn 1 ; 1 Seoul/KR, 2 Koyang/KR Purpose: To assess the feasibility and effectiveness of renal cyst ablation using n-butyl cynoacrylate (NBCA) in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Materials and methods: During the past 14 months, 50 renal cysts in 14 patients were treated with percutaneous needle aspiration and intracystic injection of 1:2 mixture of NBCA and iodised oil. Clinical follow-up was done in all 14 patients for the period of 1 -12 months. Subjective symptoms, blood pressure, and serum creatinine level before and after the procedure were compared. CT follow-up was done in 31 cysts in eight patients for the period of 3 -12 months. The procedure was considered successful at follow-up CT when the diameter of the cyst decreased more than 50 % after the procedure as compared to that before the procedure. Results: After NBCA therapy, symptom was improved in 12 of 14 patients (86 %) and cyst was disappeared or decreased more than 50 % in diameter after the procedure in 25 of 31 cysts (81 %). There were no significant changes in blood pressure and serum creatinine level after the procedure. There was no significant complication related to the procedure in any of the patients. Conclusion: Percutaneous needle aspiration with intracystic injection of mixture of NBCA and iodised oil appears to be feasible and may be an effective modality in ablating renal cysts in patients with ADPKD.

ADI imaging of the lesion was performed without interval scanning after a delay of 5 minutes from bolus injection of Levovist (2.5 g). Liver-lesional uptake differences (LLUD: as %) were compared using a visual analogue score. Comparisons were made using non-parametric comparisons (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA; Mann-Whitney 2-column comparisons with Bonferroni corrections). Results: Highly significant differences (p \u2265 50 %), while fat/fatty sparing, RGN and FNH showed minimal differences (< 10 %).

Bartolozzi; Pisa/IT Purpose: To describe contrast enhancement patterns of focal hepatic lesions at C3-mode intermittent US imaging. Materials and methods: A series of 99 hepatic lesions in 66 patients were examined. US examination was performed by using C3-mode intermittent imaging (Technos, Esaote Biomedica) with 1.4 mechanical index after bolus injection of 2.5 g Levovist (Schering AG) at the concentration of 400 mg/ml. US images were acquired in arterial (15 -25 s), portal in-flow (40 -55 s), full portal (70 -85 s), and delayed (180 -200 s) phases. Findings at contrast US studies were correlated lesion-by-lesion with those at spiral CT or dynamic MRI. Results: Four distinct enhancement patterns were observed: (1) rapid enhancement in arterial phase, followed by either isoechoic (5/5 focal nodular hyperplasia, 1/1 hepatocellular adenoma, 1/6 haemangioma) or hypoechoic appearance (38/38 hepatocellular carcinomas) in portal-venous and delayed phases; (2) peripheral globular enhancement in arterial phase, with centripetal fill-in in portal-venous and delayed phases (5/6 haemangiomas); (3) rimlike enhancement in arterial phase, followed by hypoechoic appearance in portal-venous and delayed phases (9/25 metastases); and (4) no enhancement in arterial phase followed by either isoechoic (13/13 macroregenerative nodules) or hypoechoic appeareance (16/25 metastases) in portal-venous and delayed phases. The enhancement patterns shown at contrast US correlated with spiral CT or dynamic MRI findings in 80 of 88 lesions (90 %).

One possible application would be military medicine, because the expert is not present at the time and on the site where diagnosis has to be done. The objective was to evaluate the ability of the system to be used for remote medical diagnosis.",

Examinations using conventional method were performed and later on compared to those realized using VirtualProbe. All examinations were done by qualified radiologists. The image quality of the 2 methods were scored from 1 to 5 (poor to very good). Moreover, the ability of the system to allow proper diagnosis was recorded. Results: There was no difference between methods in image quality. For VirtualProbe, diagnosis was adjudicated as \"possible\" in 33 cases (82.5 %), \"possible with some difficulties\" in 5 cases (12.5 %) and \"not possible\" in 2 cases (5 %) due to technical problems (electromagnetic interferences and patient with polypnea leading to the impossibility to do acquisition). Conclusion: VirtualProbe system is a powerful tool that would provide a significant improvement in remote medical diagnosis using ultrasonography.",

Osti, L. Solbiati, P. Marelli, V. Kirn; Busto Arsizio/IT Purpose: Assessment of neoplastic nature of intraportal thrombus is of crucial importance for staging and therapeutic choice in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We sought to assess the utility of grey-scale harmonic sonography using second generation contrast agents for differentiating between neoplastic and bland portal venous thrombus. Materials and methods: 85 cirrhotic patients with solitary or multifocal HCC were evaluated for potential RF ablation therapy with triphasic helical CT, B-mode and color Doppler US. Contrast enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) was performed using low mechanical index (0.1 -0.2) and a second-generation contrast agent (SonoVue, Bracco). Liver parenchyma and main portal branches were examined over arterial, portal, and delayed phases. Results: In 10 patients (11.8 %) conventional US and helical CT identified thrombus within the portal trunk or main branches. Arterial enhancement was depicted by CT in 7/10 (70 %) cases suggesting malignant nature. Unenhanced color Doppler detected arterial-type flow signals within the thrombus in 3 of 10 cases (30 %). With CEUS, 8/10 (80 %) thrombus showed rapid and inhomogeneous enhancement in the arterial phase (p < 0.05, compared to unenhanced US). In the portal phase, the enhancement of these 8 thrombi decreased in proportion to the respective HCCs, as contrast filled the patent portions of the vessel. In the remaining 2 cases, no arterial enhancement was detected and no malignant cells were found by US-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Conclusions: Our study suggests that continuous-mode, contrast-enhanced harmonic sonography may serve as an easy and highly reliable modality for the characterization of portal thrombus in cirrhotic patients.",

Della Chiesa, V. Kirn; Busto Arsizio/IT Purpose: To assess the use of contrast-enhanced harmonic sonography (CEUS) in the differential diagnosis of incidentally detected focal liver abnormalities. Methods and materials: 460 patients underwent abdominal US for clinical questions unrelated to the liver. None of the patients had chronic hepatitis/cirrhosis nor history of malignancy. Solid focal lesions were found in 49 patients (8.75 %). Lesions with characteristic features of hemangioma were excluded. Low mechanical index, continuous-mode CEUS was performed using a second-generation contrast agent (SonoVue, Bracco). Final diagnosis was established by means of helical CT, dynamic MRI and/or FNAB. Results: In 14/14 focal nodular hyperplasias (FNH) and 13/13 atypical hemangiomas the typical enhancement pattern was detected. In 6 patients presenting multiple hyperechoic lesions, CEUS showed enhancement analogous to that of the surrounding liver in all vascular phases, suggesting the diagnosis of focal fatty changes, subsequently confirmed with CT and FNAB. In four patients with poorly enhancing lesions, CEUS did not provide diagnostic findings and FNAB was necessary to diagnose fibrotic hemangioma (1 patient), multiple tubercolous granulomas (1) and disseminated metastases form unknown origin (2). Conclusions: For the characterization of most incidentally detected and sonographically indeterminate benign lesions (FNH, atypical hemangioma, focal fatty change) CEUS (through the assessment of the enhancement behaviour over the different vascular phases) showed specificity equal to that of helical CT. CEUS will probably alleviate the need for further investigation with helical CT studies and aspiration biopsies.",

Siani 1 ; 1 Pozzuoli/IT, 2 Naples/IT Purpose: To evaluate if CE-PD is helpful in the differential diagnosis of focal hepatic lesions detected by grey-scale ultrasound. Methods and materials: In a 1-year period 98 consecutive patients where found to have previously unknown, non-cystic lesions on ultrasound examination (51 subjects showed 1 lesion, 29 2 -5 lesions, and 18 > 5 lesions). These lesions were evaluated with Levovist-enhanced PD and were fitted into 9 categories (hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocellular carcinoma, adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, angioma, metastasis, dysplasic nodule, abscess, other). Diagnostic confidence level was graded subjectively from 1 (possible) to 4 (certain). Categorisation and diagnostic confidence scoring were repeated after CE-PD study. Eight cases without confirmation were excluded. Results: Addiction of CE-PD study resulted in a change of category for 5 patients (5.6 %), all with a single lesion; this modification proved correct in all of them. Excluding 48 subjects with a maximal scoring (level 4), there were 16 patients with increased confidence after CE-PD study, 2 with decreased confidence, and 24 with unmodified confidence after CE-PD; score change was never greater than 1 level. In the two most commonly encountered issues, suspected nodule in chronic liver disease and angioma vs. hypovascular metastasis, CE-PD imaging was rarely useful. Conclusion: CE-PD increased the characterisation accuracy of ultrasound only in selected cases while it is not cost-effective if employed routinely. These patients can usually be predicted on a clinical-sonographic basis allowing selective CE-PD imaging to be performed. Purpose: To define and quantify acoustic parameters in order to characterize liver histopathologic findings in patients presenting with chronic hepatitis type C using a commercially available ultrasound system. Materials and methods: 78 patients with a chronic hepatitis type C were prospectively enrolled. Cineloops from the liver and the spleen were acquired using an ATL HDI 5000 unit (ATL-Philips, WA, USA). Raw data were transferred to a PC for quantification with HDI Lab, a software that eliminates the effects of the nonlinear B-mode map. Two parameters were calculated using a linear time gain compensation: the liver and spleen attenuation coefficients (respectively LAC and SAC), and the signals of a region-of-interest (ROI) located at 6 cm depth (mean and SD, linear units). All results were correlated to the results of the liver biopsy (Knodell and Metavir score). Results: LAC was higher than the SAC in all cases. LAC and the normalized AC (LAC \u2212 SAC) was significantly higher in cases of cirrhosis (p < 0.01). The signal intensity from the ROI was not correlated to the histological findings. The standard deviation increased in cases of cirrhosis due to the heterogeneity of the echostructure. Conclusion: Quantitative ultrasonography is feasible in routine practice and can improve the stadification of cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis type C.",

Ludwig, C. Schuelke, H. Lenzen, T.M. Bernhardt, S. Diederich, D. Wormanns, P. Brinckmann, W.L. Heindel; M\u00fcnster/DE Purpose: To compare a digital flat-panel detector in the detection of subtle rib fractures with conventional screen-film radiography and phosphor-storage radiography at different levels of exposure. Method/materials: Subtle fractures were created in 100 of 200 porcine rib specimens. Specimens were mounted into a basin filled with water to obtain absorption and scatter radiation conditions comparable to a human chest. Imaging was performed using a flat-panel detector system, screen-film system and phosphor-storage system. Exposure settings comparable to clinical imaging were applied (77 kVp, S = 400). Additional imaging was performed with both digital imaging modalities at lower exposure doses: With the flat-panel detector images were acquired at exposure doses corresponding to speed-class 800, 1600 and 6400, with the phosphorstorage system to 800 and 1600. For each image the presence/absence of a rib fracture was assessed independently by three radiologists according to a five level confidence scale. ROC-analysis was performed for a total of 5200 observations (600 for each imaging modality/exposure level). Multivariate analysis was used to compare AUCs. Introduction: New digital imaging techniques offer the ability to adjust the radiation dose required to answer the clinical question. Irrespective of the type of imaging technique, the lowest dose compatible with the required image quality should be used. Material and methods: A comparative study was performed with three units for storage phosphor and a flat detector unit. Image quality was evaluated by a contrast detail radiography phantom (Nuclear Associates: Digirad). This was completed by further studies using phantoms containing anatomical structures. Clinical images and doses were also evaluated by 5 European centres for radiology and medical physics that co-operate within the DIMOND-3 EC project. Results: The images of the Digirad Phantom demonstrate differences in the image quality of storage phospor systems, but flat panel detector technology showed far the highest image quality. For the flat panel detector radiation dose can be decreased significantly in comparison to storage phosphor systems. Using flat panel detectors all examinations can be performed with a maximum of halve the dose compared to storage phosphor systems, operated at a 400 speed class. Further dose reduction by a factor of 4 is possible for specific examinations. Conclusion: Dose mangement with new digital imaging techniques can decrease radiation dose to the patient significantly. In a broad range dose and image quality can be optimized and adapted to the clinical question.",

RLs have been suggested by the Council Directive of the European Community 97/43/Euratom as a means of optimising diagnostic exposures. Method: During the DIMOND (Digital Imaging: Measures for Optimising Radiological Information Content and Dose) european research program patients' doses during IC procedures were measured. This was done in terms of dose-area product (DAP), fluoroscopy time and total number of radiographic exposures. Values were obtained in three participating European hospitals, using previously checked X-ray equipment and according to a commonly agreed protocol. Moreover, a DAP trigger level has been defined in order to prevent skin injuries since IC techniques are known to be associated with high radiation doses and thus deterministic effects may be observed. Results: RLs for DAP equals 60 Gycm 2 and 100 Gycm 2 , for fluoroscopy time 6.5 min and 20 min and for number of frames 1000 and 1400 for CA and PTCA respectively.

Results and discussion: Contrast-detail curves and image quality factors could be calculated for the different observers and images. Observer variability was compared with theoretical predictions and some readings from conventional mammography images. Image quality factors were low, meaning that low contrast differences and small objects could be distinguished.

We have reviewed the current European protocol for quality control in (conventional) mammography within the DIMOND-3 EC project and we propose a similar series of tests for digital systems. Methods and materials: Following tests had to be redefined: the assessment of the focal spot size, different tests of the automatic exposure control and tests of the detector including the grid. Image quality was evaluated via phantom exposures and DQE measurements. The protocols were tested on 3 digital Senographe DMR systems (GE) and on 1 digital Fuji detector. Results and conclusion: All the tests included in the revised acceptance protocol may be completed in under 4 hours. The performance of the three systems was very stable. The doses for standard exposures were variable between the different sites. This has an impact on image quality. Since the dose setting for a digital detector is a parameter of the X-ray system only (independent of any filmscreen combination) that can be freely adjusted in the different centers, we propose to use a quite strict guidance regarding the standard dose settings. A difficult practical problem is the transfer of data in order to perform some evaluations offline. Further cooperation with the manufacturer may be needed to make this type of testing feasible for hospital medical physicists.",

For guidance of the needles, T1-weighted FLASH sequences (TR/TE 100/9; 70\u00b0) were performed in all patients and an additional FISP-Rotated-Keyhole-sequence (TR/TE 18/8; 90\u00b0) was also used. After positioning of the needle tip in the tumor, 82 biopsy specimens were acquired with 14 -16 G cutting needles (Somatex\u00ae) during the interventional procedures. The visibility of the needles, the tumors and the abdominal vessels were evaluated. Results: All interventional treatments were performed without vascular or organ injury. Adequate specimens for histological interpretation were obtained in 47 cases (87.0 %). In 3 patients (5.6 %) the biopsy result was non-specific and in 4 patients (7.4 %) the lesion was missed. T1-weighted FLASH images were useful for confirming needle-tip placement during the biopsies or punctures. The use of free slice orientation facilitated the interventional procedure. The organs, tumors and vessels were easily determined. The FISP sequence resulted in equal or inferior results. Conclusion: MR-guided abdominal interventions can be performed with acceptable safety and accuracy with low field systems. Lesion and needle visibility are significantly affected by user-defined parameters which must be considered during procedure planning. Materials and methods: Over 4.3 years, 1120 biopsies were carried out under CT-fluoroscopic control (Philips AVEU and Toshiba Aquilion) in the lung (33.6 %), mediastinum (6.6 %), abdomen (26.6 %), pelvis (7.5 %), retroperitoneum (11.8 %) and varia (14 %). In 867 cases, the obtained material was sent to pathology. 88 % (761) provided material for cytology, 48 % (413) for histology. A pathologist was on-site and decided, by means of a quick staining procedure, whether further tissue removal was necessary. The primary tumour was known in 403 cases. The number of punctures, unsuccessful biopsies, positive and negative results (classified according to biopsying examiner and location), differences between histology and cytology and complications were analysed. Results: On average, 1.6 punctures were performed to complete the procedure. 2 tissue samples for cytology were obtained in 181 cases (21 %). The overall sensitivity for cytology and histology was 97 % and 96 %, respectively; 93 % and 97 % with known primary; 99 % and 95 % with unknown primary. In 83 (0.1 %) and 26 (0.03 %) of cases, no diagnostic material was obtained with cytology and histology, respectively, although the on-site pathologist assumed that sufficient material was present. Benign lesions were found in 163 cases (18.8 %), 45 biopsies were unsuccessful (5.2 %). One less experienced examiner yielded only 61 % sensitivity. Overall, complications occurred in 43 patients (5 %). Conclusions: CT-fluoroscopy-guided biopsy represents a safe and reliable technique with a high sensitivity for malignancy and minimal difference between cytology and histology. The examiners experience plays a decisive role in the diagnostic outcome. ",

It uses a laser assisted proprietary articulated arm technology and displays corresponding multiplanar CT images as the computer assisted arm is manipulated along the patient's body. The system includes an intuitive virtual planning tool that allows simulation of the best instrument path from the entry point to the target area. 50 biopsies of masses in 50 patients were carried out. All biopsies were obtained using an 18 or 20 gauge high speed tru-cut biopsy gun. Masses biopsied included lung (25), lymph nodes (8), bone (10) and pelvis (7). An average of 2.5 passes was performed. Results: Using this system interventions could be confidently planned and safely carried out even in difficult or risky areas in all 50 cases. However, due to respiratory motion there are some limitations, particularly with lung lesions. Mean proce-dure time was 8 min \u00b1 10 min. In 95 % of the cases biopsies were diagnostic. After central lung biopsy 1 of 4 patients with pneumothorax required a chest drainage. 2 cases with haemoptysis resolved with conservative treatment.

Main/DE, 2 Bad Friedrichshall/DE Purpose: In studies of patients undergoing percutaneous thoracic biopsies, the risk for pneumothorax has varied from 2 -61 %. Our aim was to develop a risk profile for pneumothorax based on the severity of pneumothoraces and in correlation with age and the presence of emphysema. Methods and materials: We retrospectively investigated outcomes of 133 patients with CT-guided thoracic biopsies using an 18 G coaxial cutting-needle with a high-speed-automatic system (biopty Bard). Pneumothorax was graded as: I minimal, local; II < 1 cm; III > 1 cm; IV chest tube required. Emphysema was graded as: I discrete; II moderate; III extensive. Results: 97.7 % of the biopsies in 133 patients were successful. The diagnostic sensitivity was 94 % and the incidence of pneumothorax was 30.1 % (grade I: 17.3 %; II: 5.3 %; III: 3.8 %; IV: 3.8 %). For younger patients the risk of severe pneumothorax (Grade III or IV) increased linearly. The degree of emphysema did not correlate with the incidence of pneumothorax. Conclusion: The pneumothorax risk for elderly patients decreases in transthoracal CT guided automated high-speed cutting-needle biopsies. The incidence of severe, clinically relevant pneumothoraces increases linearly in younger patients. The linear correlation is caused by morphological and functional linear changes due to the regular aging of the lung. No correlation with pathological emphysema was found. Purpose: The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of percutaneous drainage of abdominal fluid collections using a MRI-compatible drainage system. Material and methods: In 6 patients drainage procedures were performed with MRI-compatible drainage systems (Somatex\u00ae) for the interventional treatment of abdominal fluid collections). For all procedures a low field MR-system (0.2 T, Siemens) was used. The punctures were controlled using T1-weighted FLASH sequences (TR/TE 100/9; 70\u00b0) and a FISP-Rotated-Keyhole-sequence (TR/TE 18/8; 90\u00b0). After positioning of the catheter in the fluid collection, the topographic details were controlled with intracavitary injection of an aqueous gadolinium solution (dilution 1:200). Results: All drainage catheters were successfully placed into the fluid collections under MR-guidance. The catheter position was easily visualized with the T1weighted FLASH sequences. Using the FISP sequences the visibility of the catheters was good or moderate and also useful for MR-guidance. No procedure-related complications occurred. The mean time needed for the drainage procedure was 30 min \u00b1 15 min. The fluid collections were drained for a mean of 12 days. The topic of the study presented here is the evaluation of the feasibility and acceptance of repeated ultrasound-guided lymph node puncture for vaccination.",

We delivered a suspension containing antigen pulsed dentritic cells, under ultrasound view, directly into the lymph node's paracortical area. To visualize the procedure we used a high-resolution computed ultrasound system (Sequoia 512) with a 13 MHz linear array probe. The tip of a 20 G needle was placed into the paracortical area of the node, and application of the suspension was performed under ultrasound view. Results: Normal-sized, morphologically unsuspicious lymph nodes were found in every patient during every procedure. Major side effects were not observed; we merely noticed fever in 1 patient, painful swelling of the punctured lymph node in 3 patients, and newly occurring vitiligo in 10 patients. The immunological results of our therapy are still under evaluation. Conclusion: Ultrasound-guided intranodal vaccination is a reliable and reproducible technique to deliver antigen-pulsed dentritic cells into peripheral lymph nodes. The method is well accepted by patients. It could lead to changes in the therapeutical options of both malignant and infectious diseases.",

In vitro fibrin formation test was performed by dipping heparin-coated catheter and non-coated catheter (as control) into fresh plasma for 60 minutes, and the results were interpreted using scanning electron microscopy. For in vivo assessment, eight pairs of coated and control catheters (8 French) were inserted into the peritoneal cavity in normal New Zealand White rabbits (n = 8). Applying a basic principle in flow dynamics (resistance = pressure/flow rate), intra-catheter pressure was measured at the plateau (Pmax) during saline infusion in constant rate (0.1 ml/s) and Pmax was followed up for 14 days to estimate the changes in effective caliber. Results: On in vitro assessment, no fibrin formation was observed in heparincoated catheter compared to strong reaction in control catheter. On in vivo assessment, decrease in mean effective caliber was 1.7 % vs. 7.5 % (coated vs. control) at 3 rd day (p = 0.14, paired t test), 4.8 % vs. 12.5 % at 7 th day (p = 0.059), 6.5 % vs. Palermo/IT Purpose: Hepatic artery stenosis and thrombosis are common complications in liver transplant patients. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) has served as the gold standard to make this diagnosis. More recently, three dimensional helical computed tomographic arteriography (3D CTA) with maximum intensity projection and shaded surface display techniques has been compared with DSA. The purpose of this study is to determine if 3D CTA with volume rendering technique is a useful and accurate tool in the detection of vascular complications after liver transplantation. Methods: 35 consecutive liver transplant patients underwent 3D CTA with volume rendering technique. The standard of reference was DSA for 20 patients and imaging and clinical follow-up for 15 patients. Two blinded reviewers evaluated the axial and 3D CTA images in consensus. Results: 3D CTA with volume rendering technique detected 10 hepatic artery stenoses, six hepatic artery thromboses, two hepatic artery pseudoaneurysms, two splenic artery aneurysms, two portal vein stenoses, and four redundant hepatic arteries. In one case CT detected a moderate hepatic artery stenosis, while conventional angiography showed a normal artery. The sensitivity of CT for detecting vascular lesions was 100 %, specificity 89 % (8 of 9), accuracy 95 % (19 of 20), positive predictive value of 92 % (11 of 12), and negative predictive value of 100 % (8 of 8).

Materials & methods: 21 consecutive potential living donors of the right lobe of the liver (mean age 32 years) underwent three-phase, dual-enhancement multidetector-CT imaging to delineate biliary, vascular and parenchymal morphology. For display of the biliary system the first CT-image set was collected 25 minutes following the infusion of 100 ml of a biliary contrast agent (Biliscopin). Subsequently CT (slice thickness/collimation 1 mm, pitch 4 mm, table-speed 12 mm/s) was performed for display of the arterial as well as the portal and hepatic venous systems, following automated injection of 140 ml of an iodinated contrast agent (Imeron 350). Analysis was based on source images and multiplanar reformats. The hepatic parenchyma was assessed for the presence of pathologies and volumetry was based on the venous data set. Results: All potential donors tolerated the exam well. The 'in-room' time for the exam ranged between 7 and 12 minutes. One hemangioma and one adenoma were identified. Total liver volumes ranged between 1040 and 1716 ml. The underlying biliary and vascular anatomy was displayed at least to the second intrahepatic branch in all cases. Anatomic variations were observed involving the biliary system (n = 16), the arterial system (n = 13), the portal system (n = 5) and the venous system (n = 6).

Geller 1 , J.J. Fung 1 ; 1 Pittsburgh, PA/US, 2 Palermo/IT Purpose: To evaluate the usefulness of CT angiography (CTA) with 3D reconstruction to detect the arterial supply to the liver using a multidetector row helical CT. Methods and materials: Eighteen patients had CTA. Of these, 17 had surgical correlation, including 9 who also underwent conventional arteriography. The remaining patient had conventional arteriography only. Images were reviewed in cine mode on a PACS station with 3D volume rendered images. Axial CT sections and volume rendered images were prospectively reviewed by two blinded readers jointly. Results: All studies were technically satisfactory. CT angiographic findings were confirmed at surgery in 17/17 (100 %) patients (classical arterial anatomy, n = 11; replaced left hepatic artery (LHA) off the left gastric artery (LGA), replaced right hepatic artery (RHA) off the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and accessory LHA to segment IV off the common hepatic artery (CHA), n = 1; replaced LHA off the LGA, n = 1; replaced CHA off the aorta, n = 1; replaced LHA off the LGA and replaced RHA off the SMA, n = 1; RHA, LHA and gastroduodenal artery off common hepatic as a trifurcation, n = 1; RHA off the coeliac trunk, accessory LHA to segment IV off the CHA, n = 1). Findings at CTA and conventional arteriography were concordant in 8/9 patients. In the single discordant case CTA depicted a RHA off the celiac trunk and an accessory LHA to segment IV off the CHA, but did not identify a LHA off the LGA. Conclusion: CTA is valuable in detecting the arterial supply to the liver allowing for precise surgical plannning. There are a number of sonographic features of posterior tibial tendinosis (PTT). One of these is an increase in posterior tibial tendon calibre. The aim of this study is to compare the posterior tibial tendon calibre in patients with PTT against a group of normal subjects by ultrasound. Methods: Patients with PTT were referred by the orthopaedic department for assessment of the posterior tibial tendon. Healthy asymtomatic volunteers were taken as normal subjects. The posterior tibial tendon was examined by high frequency ultrasound (at least 7.5 MHz, usually 10 -12 MHz). The cross-sectional area was measured at three points along each tendon whilst keeping the probe at a right angle to the course of the tendon as it runs behind and under the medial malleolus and then forward on to its insertion at the navicular bone. The reference points were behind the medial malleolus, below the medial maleolus and just proximal to the tendon insertion. Results: Over a four year period, 44 patients with uni-or bilateral PTT were examined. The tendon calibre was compared with measurements obtained from 100 normal subjects from which the mean and standard deviation values were determined. It was shown that the vast majority of those with symptomatic PTT had values greater than 2 standard deviations above the mean normal value at each reference level. Conclusion: Patients with posterior tibial tendinosis demonstrate an appreciably larger tendon calibre than normal subjects. This is a very helpful sign in the diagnosis of posterior tibial tendinosis.",

Garlaschi; Genova/IT Purpose: To test the usefulness of kinematic ankle MRI performed with low field MRI equipment. Methods/materials: From January 1999 until February 2000 we examined 150 ankles using a 0.2 T MR system (ARTOSCAN, ESAOTE). 25/150 patients (n = 4 synovial anterior impingement, n = 6 osseous posterior impingement, n = 15 lateral ankle sprains) underwent kinematic evaluation. We obtained the adequate range of motion by moving the chair with the foot in a fixed position, so that the leg passes from a semiflexed to the fully extended position. In this way, the ankle moves from 90\u00b0 dorsiflexed to 135\u00b0 plantarflexed position. Kinematic examinations were performed on sagittal and/or axial planes using HSE T1w sequences. Results: We didn not identify significative findings in all cases of synovial anterior impingement. On the other hand, kinematic exams allowed a better evaluation of all patients with osseous posterior impingement. We directly visualized peroneal tendon instability in 3/15 cases of lateral ankle sprains. Conclusions: Kinematic ankle MRI, performed with a low field unit, is a simple and quick technique in the study of some ankle pathologies. In particular, it seems to be very useful to evaluate the biomechanical alterations of osseous posterior impingement and to demonstrate the presence of peroneal tendon instability which is often unrecognized and misdiagnosed. Purpose: The aim of this work was to assess MRI diagnostic accuracy in detecting pathological conditions which lead to tibio-talar joint (TTJ) impingement, using arthroscopy as the gold-standard. Method and materials: 21 patients (aged 19 -35 years) clinically complaining of ankle unsteadiness and swelling entered this study; 20 out of 21 patients referred to a history of ankle sprain. MRI examination was performed with both a 1.5 T whole-body (TSE T2-w and SE T1-w sequences) and a 0.2 T dedicated system (SE T1 and T2-w sequences). In 12 cases i.v contrast material was administered followed by SE T1-w sequences with fat saturation pulse. All the patients underwent arthroscopy. Results: MRI examination revealed the presence of TTJ synovial impingement in 9 patients and in only 4 of them the presence of contrast enhancement revealed acute inflammatory stage; arthroscopy always detected a thickened synovial lining. In 3 patients MRI examination showed the presence of tibio-peroneal tendon injury associated with synovial hypertrophy (\"meniscoid syndrome\"); in 1 of these cases contrast enhancement was evident. In 6 patients MRI examination documented the presence of a bony impingement due to talus and tibial osteophyte; in these cases arthroscopy confirmed MRI diagnosis. Three patients had a completely negative MRI examination, one of them showing a meniscoid syndrome on arthroscopy.",

            "text": "Results: Plantarfibromatosis was seen as a discrete fusiform-shaped nodular thickening of the plantar fascia removed from the calcaneal insertion. Of the 12 patients examined, 8 (66 %) had unilateral disease while 4 (33 %) had bilateral disease. Of the 16 affected feet, a single site of fibromatosis was present in 9 (56 %) feet with two or more sites in 7 (44 %) feet. Of the 25 discrete foci of fibromatosis, 22 (88 %) were hypoechoic to the plantar fascia and 3 (12 %) were isoechoic. The fascial margin was well-defined in 12 (48 %) and ill-defined in 13 (52 %). 2 of the 25 lesions (8 %) showed mild internal vascularity. No correlation was found between the ultrasound appearances and the chronicity of patients symptoms. 15 (60 %) of lesions were located in the midfoot while 10 (40 %) were located at the forefoot. 17 (68 %) were located medially in the fascia while 8 (32 %) were located centrally. Conclusion: This is the first reported series detailing the ultrasound appearances of plantar fibromatosis. While the ultrasound appearances are variable, they are still characteristic enough to allow a specific diagnosis in all cases. Purpose: Spontaneous involution of lumbar disc herniation in patients treated with conservative therapy is reported in up to 70 % of cases. The aim of our study was to evaluate any eventually predictive signs on MR imaging of disc herniation involution. Methods and material: 65 patients, affected by 72 lumbar disc herniations, entered a perspective study. MRI examinations were performed on 1.5 T magnet, using sagittal and axial T1w SE sequences before and after contrast administration, and FSE T2w ones on the same scan planes. Patient age, sex and level and size of disk herniation, clinical onset interval, type of herniation, T2-w signal intensity and pattern of contrast enhancement had been registered. All the patients, conservatively treated, underwent clinical and MRI follow-up after 6 months: disc herniation size and contrast-enhancement variations were re-evaluated. Results: MRI follow-up showed herniation regression in 66 % cases. Extruded disk with high signal intensity on T2w sequences regressed in 83 % of cases. The same percentage of regression was registered in enhancing cases. Free fragments disappeared in all cases. Rest in bed for at least 15 days resulted to be a significant factor for a favorable evolution of acute disk herniation. No relationship was found with side, size, level. Conclusion: MRI features seems to have a significant meaning in assessing spontaneous tendency on herniation involution, thus furnishing additional prognostic value.",

The MR technique allows these complications to be revealed simultaneously and serves as a basis for appropriate treatment. Material & methods: 20 patients who suffered from radiation myelopathy were examined by MR. Patients underwent radiotherapy with total dose of 40 -44 Gy and irradiation was performed in two series, with one month time interval between them. Radiotherapy was performed in patients with bronchial carcinoma (14 patients) and malignant lymphoma (6 patients). Examinations were performed on 1.5 T MR imager using a surface coil. The protocol included T1w and T2w sagittal images, T1w and T2w axial images and images after application of Gd DTPA. Results: Clinical signs of radiation myelopathy appeared 6 -18 months after radiotherapy. Symptoms included weakness of lower limbs and paresthesia. MR examination revealed abnormally decreased signal on T1W images, increased signal on T2W images, focal contrast enhancement and spinal cord enlargement. Cord enlargement was detected in 19 patients while in 1 patient spinal cord atrophy was found. Radiation-induced abnormal high signal intensity was presented in cervical and thoracal vertebral bodies due to fatty replacement of bone marrow with sharp boundary corresponding to the radiation field. Conclusion: MR is easy, safe and valuable imaging method in diagnosis and differential diagnosis of radiation myelopathy. Then we performed contrast-enhanced sagittal T1-weighted scans after i.v. administration of Gadolinium-DTPA (Magnevist, Schering, Germany). When we recognized these features with MRI, the exam was completed with axial scans using the same sequences. All the patients underwent lumbar puncture within 2 days of the MR examination. Results: In 10 patients MRI was positive. We detected diffuse sheet-like infiltration of the arachnoid membrane or neoplastic coating of the conus and cauda equina to nodular deposition throughout the subarachnoid space. The most sensitive acquisition was the contrast-enhanced SE T1-weighted sequence. Only 7 patients out of 10 had a positive lumbar puncture. In the follow-up during therapy, MRI was considered more accurate in the evaluation of the pathological evolution of leptomeningeal involvement by hematopoietic neoplasms. Conclusions: In our limited experience, MRI was more sensitive in the detection of spinal epidural and leptomeningeal involvement by hemopoietic tumors. In patients with strong clinical suspicion of this involvement and negative lumbar puncture, MRI should be performed. Purpose: Knowledge of the exact site and localisation of a CSF fistula is important for planning surgical procedures and to prevent further complications. The purpose of this prospective study was to establish and to evaluate GD-DTPA enhanced MR cisternography in the detection of rhinobasal CSF fistulae in patients with suspected CSF rhinorrhea. Materials and methods: 10 patients with suspected CSF rhinorrhea were examined. Clinical diagnoses were: 7 severe head/brain trauma, 1 meningocele, 1 hydrocephalus and 1 chronic sinusitis. MR cisternography included the following investigation steps: acquisition of non enhanced fat suppressed T1-weighted SE scans of the skull base and the paranasal sinuses, lumbar puncture with administration of 1 ml GD-DTPA solute with 4 ml NaCl and performance of MR cisternography with the same fat suppressed T1-weighted sequences as used initially.",

In the remaining 4 patients with serous rhinorrhea MR cisternography did not provide any evidence for CSF fistulae. Intrathecal GD-DTPA injection was well tolerated. Conclusions: MR cisternography after intrathecal administration of GD-DTPA is a safe, promising and minimally invasive method for detection of CSF fistulae. This MR investigation provides excellent depiction of CSF spaces and pinpoints CSF fistulae. The description of the complex 3D shape of the ventricular system is an important aspect for the typisation of the ventriculomegaly.

Lud; Vitebsk/BY Purpose: The problem of colonic cancer (CC) and gastric cancer (GC) diagnosis remains a difficult issue. A number of screening programs for CC diagnosis based on faecal occult blood tests and endoscopy are well-known. The objective of this study was to determine the possibilities of screening ultrasound examination for gastric cancer and colonic cancer. Patients and methods: 29467 patients aged 25 -87 with various diseases were examined for CC and GC diagnosis. Screening ultrasound examination for CC and GC was performed in all the patients of the hospital and ambulance station who were examined by conventional abdominal sonography. CC and GC had not been suspected before the examination. Revealing of concentric hypoechogenic thickening of the stomach and bowel wall with increased central reflection (i.e. non-specific \"pseudokidney symptom\") was defined as a pathological criterion. Bowel and stomach sonography lasted for about 3 minutes. Results: The ultrasound examination resulted in revealing 54 cases of CC and 18 cases of GC. Almost all patients with tumours were operated and in all cases the diagnosis was confirmed histologically. According TNM classification most of these patients had T2 -T3 stages of cancer. False negative results were analyzed using regional cancer register. Conclusion: It seems quite possible to diagnose actively colonic and gastric cancer by means of screening ultrasound examinations. The aim of our study was to develop an examination protocol for Esophagus Virtual Endoscopy, that in association to axial CT images allowed to evaluate malignant stenosis and diverticuli. Methods and materials: Virtual endoscopy of the esophagus was performed in 29 patients with esophageal wall pathology. Esophageal distention was obtained by oral administration of effervescent granules and intramuscolar injection of 20 mg of scopolamine butylbromide. In all patients, Spiral CT Volume Zoom examination (120/80/1 mm/1 mm/8 mm/0.5 s kV/mAs/slice coll./slice width/feed per rot/rot. time) of the thorax and upper abdomen was performed within a single breath-hold, before and after i.v. administration of contrast media. Real time endoscopy images were reconstructed using volume-rendering techniques with a dedicated workstation and specific software (Vitrea 2.2, Vital Images). Conventional esophageal endoscopy was performed in all cases and an additional bronchoscopy was executed. Results: 5 diverticuli and 24 endoluminal stenotic lesions were founded. Most of them were localized in the middle or lower thoracic esophagus and were displaied as a discontinuity of esophageal lumen. 3D CT imaging associated to axial images depicts esophageal tumoral extension, other mediastinal air filled structures, the gastroesophageal junction and shows the presence of diverticuli complications. Conclusions: Our protocol achieves excellent distention of the lumen both proximal and distal to the stenosis and allows a correct differentiation between malignant stenosis and tumor located into diverticular task. This technique allows to obtain additional informations in the stenosis that do not permitt the passage of an endoscope and comparing to barium studies excludes the risk of aspiration of contrast agent. In 15 patients with positive EGR, HP was negative, while both were negative in one patient. There was highly significant difference between the HP and EGR findings (p < 0.01), meaning that statistically there was no dependence between HP and EGR. In all 52 patients, HP finding did not correlate with index values (r = 0.181, p > 0.05). Index of EGR in patients with positive HP was C = 16.7 \u00b1 11.5 %, while in those with negative HP were X = 25.3 \u00b1 9.8 %. There were significant differences (P < 0.05) in the values of index in relation to the presence of HP, meaning that it was lower in the patients with positive HP finding. However, when only patients with pathologic values of EGR were considered (EGR > 10 %), there were no significant differences (p > 0.05) in the values of index in relation to the presence (n = 19, X = 27.7 \u00b1 9.6 %) or absence (n = 15, X = 27.0 \u00b1 7.15 %) of HP. Conclusion: There was no relationship between the presence of HP and EGR. Birmingham, AL/US, 2 Rome/IT Introduction: Cardiovascular MRI (CMRI)can accurately assess LV systolic function. Diastolic function assessment involves complex methodologies such as phase contrast imaging or myocardial tagging. Our purpose was to define diastolic dysfunction (DD) with a routine CMRI approach. Methods: Using a 1.5 T system (GE Signa CV/i; GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI), LV volumes and mass were calculated on cine short axis sequences in 19 patients, 8 with risk factors for DD (LVH, hypertension, coronary disease, etc) and 11 (control group) without risk factors. Post-processing was performed with MASS analysis package (MEDIS, Leiden, the Netherlands) Studied variables were ventricular relaxation rate, LV mass index, EF, and end diastolic volume index. Results: Diastolic relaxation rate was calculated from a linear regression line fitted to the rate of LV volume change and was normalized using the body mass index. EF and LV mass index were calculated. Using binary linear regression analysis, diastolic relaxation rate predicted patients with risk factors for DD with a 2 of 9.8 (P < 0.005), whereas LV mass index predicted DD with a 2 of 5.6 (P < 0.05). EF and end diastolic volumes were not significantly different between groups. Normalized diastolic relaxation rate distinguished the two groups with 79 % accuracy, cardiac mass index with 74 %, and the combination of the two with 95 %, with 2 of 18 (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Diastolic relaxation rate and LV mass index can be used to evaluate LV diastolic function as a component of every CMRI study, using a simple cine sequence, without additional time or complex techniques not widely available.",

LV function and mass were determined by cine MRI. Cardiac rotation at the apical, mid-ventricular, and basal level and overall torsion were evaluated. 8 healthy volunteers within the same age group served as a control. Results: Before surgery, all patients showed a significant increase of apical rotation and overall LV torsion, basal rotation was not significantly different compared to volunteers. Apical rotation and torsion were negatively correlated with LV mass and end-diastolic volume. One year after surgery, basal rotation was reduced compared to controls. In comparison to pre-operative values, apical rotation also decreased but was still elevated, and this resulted in a normalization of LV torsion. Conclusion: Pressure overload before surgery is associated with an increase of systolic LV wringing motion, possibly serving as a compensatory mechanism. This mechanism declines with increasing LV hypertrophy and dilatation. SVR for aortic stenosis leads to normalization of LV torsion one year after surgery. Patients and methods: Global and regional function was determined by cine MRI in 30 patients 3 weeks after anterior MI. At the same time, 31 P-spectra were obtained from infarcted as well as non-infarcted adjacent myocardium using a 3D-CSI technique (voxel size 25 ml each). PCr/ATP ratios and signal to noise ratios (SNR) were determined using AMARES. 6 months after revascularization MRI and MRS were repeated. Gold standard for viability was recovery of regional function after revascularization. Healthy volunteers served as control group. Results: Two groups of patients (15/15; wall motion recovery versus persisting wall motion abnormalities) were formed according to follow-up MRI. At study entry patients with non-viable segments had significant reductions of PCr/ATP-ratios in non-infarcted and infarcted myocardium due to a significant reduction of PCr SNR, whereas patients with viable segments showed that only in the infarcted areas (p < 0.05 each). No significant differences were detected concerning morphologic or functional parameters between both groups. Control examination 6 months after revascularization revealed significant increases of energy metabolism and cardiac function for patients with viable myocardium (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Restoration of regional oxygen supply by revascularization therapy is connected with improvement of metabolism and function in patients with viable segments, whereas irreversible damage of infarcted tissue is connected with continuous depression of energy metabolism.",

Hahn 1 ; 1 W\u00fcrzburg/DE, 2 Oxford/GB Purpose: Elevated sodium (Na) content in myocardial infarction (MI) can be imaged by increased Na signal intensity ( 23 Na SI). Experimental studies described the temporal changes of myocardial Na content post-myocardial infarction. Aim of our study was to determine the time course of 23 Na SI after MI in humans. Materials and methods: 13 patients were examined 14 \u00b1 3 days and 3 months after MI, 7 patients underwent an additional examination 4 \u00b1 1 days after MI. Double angulated short axis 23 Na images of the heart were obtained in prone position using a 23 Na surface coil and an ECG-triggered 3D-FLASH-sequence with 32 acquisitions. Wall motion abnormalities were detected by cine MRI. 23 Na SI of MI was expressed as percentual increase compared with the entire circumference of noninfarcted myocardium. Results: All patients showed an area of elevated 23 Na signal intensity correlating with wall motion abnormalities. 23 Na SI remained elevated between day 4 and day 14 in the 7 patients that were examined twice in the early stage after MI. All patients revealed a decrease of 23 Na SI until 3 months after MI. Conclusion: 23 Na SI is elevated in acute MI and throughout infarct healing but decreases until 3 months after MI. This is in concordance with experimental studies, these studies showed the highest Na content at day 1 with a decrease until day 90.

Hahn 1 ; 1 W\u00fcrzburg/DE, 2 Oxford/GB Purpose: Cardiac high-energy metabolism is impaired in failing human myocardium, and this may contribute to contractile dysfunction. Current technical improvements of cardiac MR-Spectroscopy (MRS) allow for absolute quantification. We tested the correlation between clinical severity and metabolite concentrations. Patients and methods: Patients with hypertrophic (aortic valve stenosis, AVD) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) were studied (10 each). Patients were graded according to NYHA; LV volumes, mass and EF were determined by cine MRI. 31 Pspectra were obtained using a 3D-CSI technique. PCr/ATP ratios and absolute values (mmol/kg) were determined using AMARES and SLOOP. Healthy agematched volunteers served as control group. Results: For NYHA classes 0 (VOL), II (7 AVD, 1 DCM) and III (3 AVD, 9 DCM), PCr concentrations were 8.48 \u00b1 1.42, 6.78 \u00b1 1.11, and 4.23 \u00b1 1.01, ATP levels 5.93 \u00b1 0.85, 5.03 \u00b1 0.81, and 3.58 \u00b1 0.64; and PCr/ATP ratios were 1.59 \u00b1 0.28, 1.36 \u00b1 0.22, and 1.21 \u00b1 0.30. PCr absolute concentrations showed the highest, ATP intermediate and PCr/ATP ratios lowest correlations with clinical and functional variables. Conclusions: Absolute concentrations seem to be more representative of the extent of energetic derangement in heart failure than established PCr/ATP ratios. Material and methods: High resolution MR imaging was performed on a 1.5 T unit (Symphony Quantum, Siemens) using T1-and STIR T2-weighted sequences via a dedicated wrist coil (total acquisition time 8 min) a mean of 6.5 days after initial radiographs in 50 patients with clinical suspicion of wrist fractures and normal plain or indistinct radiographs. Initial radiographs were evaluated independently by two senior radiologists without knowledge of the MRI findings. The resulting change in therapeutic strategy was clinically evaluated. Results: In 29/52 wrists MRI findings resulted in a change of diagnosis. There were false positive diagnoses on plain radiographs in 23 cases (46 %) and false negative diagnoses in 6 cases. MRI allowed to detect additional injuries of soft tissue in 19 cases (38 %). In 19/52 wrists the period of immobilization could be shortened or ended. In 11/52 it needed to be prolonged and in 3/52 a surgical intervention was necessary. In 19 wrists MRI had no therapeutic consequence. Correspondingly, after MRI examination the period of being unable to work was reduced in 15/50, prolonged in 7/50 and was not changed in 28/50 patients. Axial images were not helpful regarding diagnostic accuracy. Conclusion: MRI of the wrist is recommended on the day of trauma if there is clinical suspicion and normal plain radiographs. Accurate diagnosis by MRI examination on the day of trauma may reduce economic costs due to shortened immobilization time.",

Passariello; Rome/IT Purpose: In some painful syndromes of the wrist the conventional MRI imaging is not satisfactorily for diagnosis. We describe a new dynamic MRI method, that is accurate and easy to repeat, for the study of carpal instability and wrist pain. Materials and methods: We performed a dynamic study of the carpus in 27 healthy volunteers and on 38 selected patients which we chose from a group of 232 previously studied by static MRI wrist examination. We used a dedicated magnet (Artoscan, E-Scan 0.2 T) that has revealed itself to be particularly useful for dynamic acquisitions. We standardized a technique of image acquisitions at different degrees of flexion both on the coronal plane in ulnar-radial deviation and in sagittal for palmar-dorsi-flexion. We used SE and GE sequences obtaining sagittal and coronal scans with a slice thickness of 2 -3 mm. Results: The dynamic study is superior in the evaluation of carpal instability and in the assesment of capsular and ligamentous lesions if compared to standard MRI examinations. The kinematic evaluation of the images acquired in the different positions of movement allowed to document the pathologic articular kinetics. Conclusions: In our experience the MR kinematic study provided information that permitted differentiation of the possible mechanisms responsible for chronic wrist pain. Kinematic MRI is a simple and low time-consuming method of study that permits an accurate assessment of carpal instability, easily demonstrating articular biomechanical alterations that may be difficult to diagnose on static conventional MR examination.",

For the evaluation of the scapholunate ligament and the lunotriquetral ligament we subdivided lesions in partial defects and complete tears. The MR-sign of a partial-ligament defect was the passage of Gadolinium-contrast agent between the mid-carpal joint and the radiocarpal joint, but with intact ligament structures palmar or volar to the defect visible. Complete TFCC-defects, recognized by passage of contrast-agent into the distal ulnoradial joint, were classified according to Palmer. Results: For complete defects there was a high correlation between MR-arthrography and diagnostic multiportal arthroscopy (Sen: 91.7 %, Spez: 97.9 %, PPV: 78.6 %, NPV: 96.2 %). For partial defects the correlation was moderate (75.0 %; 98.0 %; 85.7 %; 94.8 %). Conclusion: For the evaluation of complete defects of the intrinsic and extrinsic ligaments, the TFCC MR-arthrography and multiportal arthrography have nearly the same diagnostic power.

There was no significant difference in the subgroup examined within 3 months after decompression and in the relation proximal to distal nerve diameter pre-and postoperatively. The flexor retinaculum could be depicted clearly in all scans. The existence and extent of scar tissue and reduction of nerve diameter were found unreliable parameters regarding outcome. Conclusion: Analysed at least 3 months after surgical decompression the AP diameter of the median nerve is significantly smaller compared to preoperative values. This diameter reduction, however, as well as existence and extent of scar tissue does not always correlate with clinical outcome. The relation between nerve diameter in the proximal and distal canal does not seem to be a helpful parameter in the diagnosis of median nerve entrapment.",

Methods and materials: Our series includes 48 consecutive elderly patients (mean age: 69 years old) presenting with acute abdominal symptoms suggestive of gastrointestinal perforation. All the patients were prospectively submitted to abdominal CT evaluation. As revealed on helical CT, the presence of free air was considered diagnostic of gastrointestinal perforation. Other CT findings considered indirect of perforation were: intraperitoneal free fluid, thickening of bowel wall, streaky density within the mesentery, the \"dirty fat\" sign, and focal collection of extraluminal fecal matter.

The urinary bladder was filled with water-soluble contrast media. Rectum and vagina were contrasted with bariumsulfate. Dynamic-MRI was performed with a 1.0 T scanner (Magnetom Expert, Siemens Erlangen) using an T2 weighted gradient echo sequence (\"true fisp\"). Patients were asked to present with full urinary bladder at the time of examination. Rectum and vagina were filled with ultrasound-gel. Results: In 28 patients we found a anterior rectocele with a anterior extent between 3 and 11 cm in video-fluoroscopy. MRI failed to visualise rectoceles in 4 cases. In 9 cases rectoceles lead to a displacement of the urethra thus causing a voiding deficiency of the urinary bladder. These findings could be depicted better in MRI. 12 patients presented a cystocele shown by both modalities. In another 4 cases a enterocele could be detected. Conclusions: MRI is inferior to video-fluoroscopy for the detection and the estimation of the degree of anterior rectoceles. However MRI is superior in assessment of the severity of displacement of the urinary bladder and the urethra. The extent of pelvic descent could more accurately be assessed by MRI. Due to the capability of MRI of direct visualisation of the pelvic contents it is superior in demonstration of enteroceles. In 1997, the gradual implementation of the nation-wide mammographic breast cancer screening in the Netherlands was completed. Since then, 625000 screening examinations are being performed annually in the agegroup 50 -75 years, at an interval of two years. The medical performance of the various disciplines in the regional screening centres is assessed by means of regular site visits. At these site visits, first, the overall screening outcomes are evaluated. Subsequently, screening and diagnostic mammograms of interval and screen-detected St. II cancer cases are reviewed. Results: Despite the small size of the country, notable regional variations e.g. in the relative frequency of small tumours (T1) are observed, ranging from 21 % to 35 % at a national average of 27 %. From a not blinded review of > 2000 interval cancers, we found that in about half of the previous screening mammograms in some way abnormal signs were notable. In one fourth of the cases, with a range from 17 % to 40 %, significant lesions were found, that should have been referred for further examination. Conclusion: This large regional variation in outcomes prompted us to carry out the so-called national optimisation study. The objective is to learn in what aspects screening performance may improve as to the earlier detection of relevant lesions. These aspects include; (1) double reading;",

Buchbinder 2 ; 1 Jerusalem/IL, 2 Bronx, NY/US Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic role of computer extracted features reflecting the cluster shape compared to features reflecting the shape of individual microcalcifications, identified mammographically. Material and methods: 286 cases of clustered MC's with proven pathology were obtained from three university hospitals and reviewed by experienced mammographers. Quantitative features characterizing the finding were extracted by a CAD system following digitization at 42 \u00b5m resolution. The shape factor and number of neighbors, according to Delaunay and Gabriel methods, were com-puted for each MC together with the eccentricity of the cluster. While shape is related to the individual MCs, the average number of neighbors and eccentricity reflect the cluster geometry. Stepwise Discriminant Analysis (SDA) determined the significance of the extracted features in predicting malignancy. The performance of a classifier based on these features was evaluated by ROC analysis. Results: SDA assigned variability of shape the highest predictive power followed by average number of neighbors (Delaunay) and average shape but excluded cluster eccentricity and number of neighbors (Gabriel) from the model. A classification scheme assigned the variability of shape a weighting factor, about 2.4 times greater than that assigned to the number of neighbors and average shape. A scheme based on these three features yielded a ROC curve with an Az of 0.88, indicating a PPV of 77 % for 95 % sensitivity. Conclusion: The variability of shape of individual MCs was found to have a higher impact in differentiating benign from malignant clusters than the average shape or features characterizing the cluster geometry. The efficacy of the independent double reading of mammograms with consensus has been established, but the observer variability between the readers must be supervised to determine the homogeneity of radiological criteria. Objective: The k index has been proposed as a method to calculate the interobserver agreement that was not due to hazard. We use the k index regarding the classification of mammographic findings in the assessment of mammographic categories (weighted k). ",

Current status, diagnostic importance, priorities and limitations of SPET and PET modalities are analysed using different tumourtropic agents. Materials and methods: Evaluation of primary lesions, detection of regional and systematic metastatic disease and the assessment of treatment response are discussed through SPET using 99 Tc-MIBI or 99 Tc-antiCEA and PET using FES or FDG for two patients' groups in four trials targeted categories. In addition localisation of \"hot spots\" and tumour margins in radiodense breasts are introduced. MRM showed a significantly higher sensitivity, but its specificity was significantly lower than SMM. In the subgroup of lesions equal or greater than 0 mm (n = 97) the figure of the sensitivity was higher (93.2 %), than the overall sensitivity of SMM. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, between XMM and the combination of XMM and MRM we found no significant improvement, but the combination of XMM and SMM yielded a significantly higher diagnostic accuracy than XMM alone. Conclusion: Both MRM and SMM have adjunct value to XMM. MRM is to be preferred when high sensitivity and spatial resolution is essential, while SMM is recommended as a complementary method in lesions larger than 1 cm. Tc-MIBI.

Kaiser 1 ; 1 Jena/DE, 2 Buc/FR Purpose: We evaluated on phantoms the capability of a full field digital mammography (FFDM) system to show lesion contrast enhancement after intravenous injection of iodine. Acquisitions on patients have begun to validate the potential of this new application as an alternative to Contrast Enhanced MRI of the breast. Method/materials: Using appropriate phantoms, we simulated the iodine diffusion in vessels and lesions to evaluate the threshold of detection of contrast uptake on FFDM images (Senographe 2000D, GE Medical Systems). The injections consisted of 1 -3 cm 3 of 2 ml Hexabrix 160 diluted in 60 ml of water, and were washed out using water. Sequences of 5 -7 images were acquired on FFDM (45 -49 kV, Mo/Cu) and were analysed to quantify contrast uptakes. Clinical use of Contrast Enhanced Digital Mammography (CEDM) requires the uptake contrast to be visible for iodine concentration between 0.12 mg/cm 2 and 1.8 mg/cm 2 . Results: Detection thresholds, with and without structured noise, were 0.50 mg/cm 2 and 0.25 mg/cm 2 respectively. Breast thickness has a low impact on uptake detection. Spatial and temporal analysis showed delayed marginal contrast uptake and slow increase of contrast in the background. Initial results on patients have demonstrated contrast uptake in malignant lesions. The shape of the uptake curves is influenced by the thickness of the breast under compression (4 -5 daN). Conclusions: Given these initial results, Contrast Enhanced Digital Mammography may be a fast and less expensive alternative to MRI for breast lesion characterisation. MRI studies were performed at 1.5 T using a modified volumetric interpolated breathhold examination (VIBE) sequence before and after administration of gadolinium. All images were evaluated prospectively regarding lesion detection and characterization. MRI findings were correlated with final diagnoses. Retrospective grading (scores 1 -4 for \"poor\" -\"excellent\") was performed for: (1) general image quality and presence of artifacts (rated \"negligible\" -\"severe\"); (2) imaging quality of detected pulmonary lesions (conspicuity and contrast on pre-and postgadolinium images)",

Hamm; Berlin/DE Purpose: Echocardiography when combined with spectral and color flow Doppler is well established as a safe, non-invasive, and versatile diagnostic modality for evaluation of left ventricular global and regional function. Tissue velocity imaging is a new technique that measures myocardial motion by tracking myocardial velocities with color Doppler myocardial imaging principles. The purpose of this study was to compare this new tool with magnetic resonance imaging. Methods and materials: 30 patients with wall motion abnormalities underwent echocardiography (Harmonic Mode-Octave) in comparison with Tissue Tracking (VivedFiVe, GE, Vingmed Ultrasound, Horten Norway, equiped with the EchoPac software package) which allows real-time acquisition of color Doppler images and on-line as well as off-line analysis of time-velocities-integrals (Tracking). Magnetic resonance imaging (Magnetom Vision, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) was performed using Stripe Tagging. For regional wall motion analysis we used the 16 segment model. Results: In 29/30 patients we analysed quantitative data from Tagging and Tracking. The concordance was 85 % and the best results were in septal, posterior and apical regions. Conclusion: Tissue tracking, compared with magnetic resonance imaging, is a reliable method for on-line quantification of global and regional systolic function of the left ventricle.",

Pohost 2 ; 1 Rome/IT, 2 Birmingham, AL/US Background: Valvular diseases can be rapidly assessed by Fast Cine (FC) MRI. Signal void is related to the TE and determines the severity. A short TE may impair assessment and detection of valvular lesions. We hypothesize that a lower receiver bandwidth, a longer TE, increases sensitivity and accuracy. Methods: A total of 30 pts and 59 valves were evaluated with the predefined bandwidth of 31.2 kHz (TE = 4.7 \u00b1 0.2 ms) and with the narrower bandwidth of 15.6 kHz (TE of 7.1 \u00b1 0.4 ms). Length, area and maximum width of signal void associated with every diseased valve were calculated. Each area was graded as mild, moderate or severe and compared with echocardiography. Results: Lowering the bandwidth significantly increases signal void area (117 \u00b1 124 vs. 71 \u00b1 78 pixel, p < 0.0001), length (21 \u00b1 15 vs. 16 \u00b1 12 p < 0.001) and the width (5.8 \u00b1 5.2 vs. 4.4 \u00b1 4.0, p < 0.001), graded as mild, moderate, or severe for each TE. Longer TE increases the severity graded in 22/49 (44.9 %) valves with signal void and diagnosed one abnormal valve not detected with the shorter TE. In the 23 cases compared with echocardiography, the longer TE showed a significantly better correlation (contingency coefficient 0.708, R = 0.657). Conclusion: Lowering the bandwidth allows longer TEs, giving better correlation with echocardiography. We conclude that a short TE leads to underestimation of the severity of the valvular lesion. Accordingly, a longer TE should be used routinely in every comprehensive cardiac MRI study.",

State-of-the-art methods have been tested for major registration criteria: (i) \"demon\" algorithms using an optical flow constraint with prior elastic smoothing; (ii) fluid registration methods governed by deformation laws from fluid mechanics; (iii) informational techniques maximising entropic measurements between successive images. In each case deformation modelling has been addressed by comparing functional measurements derived from non-parametric and parametric motion estimates. Using hierarchical solvers for handling large deformations has also been investigated. Results: Demon and mutual information maximisation techniques allow accurate derivation of dense maps of functional parameters including deformation tensor eigenelements, local contraction/dilation and circumferential/radial strains. Moreover, informational approaches are insensitive to tag fade out. B-spline modelling offers a good trade-off between measurement accuracy and modelling compactness. Multiresolution processing allows us to account for large deformations.

Binaghi; Lausanne/CH Purpose: Evaluation of the accuracy of multislice angio-CT in the detection of cerebral aneurysms, by comparison with conventional cerebral angiography Methods and material: 50 consecutive patients, who successively underwent multislice cerebral angio-CT (1.25 mm-thick slice reconstructed every 1 mm, pitch 0.75, 140 kVP, 200 mA, timing determined with a bolus test) and conventional cerebral angiography, were prospectively identified in our department between July 1999 and August 2001. Both examinations were reviewed independantly by two neuroradiologists, who were blinded to their initial interpretation and who did not perform the cerebral angiography. Angio-CT axial slices were reviewed, as well as 2D MIP and 3D SSD reconstructions. Angio-CT and angiography data analysis was performed separately, but according the same systematic interpretation strategy. Results: 49 cerebral aneurysms were diagnosed. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of multislice angio-CT in the detection of cerebral aneurysms were 95 %, 100 % and 96 %, respectively. The impact of aneurysm location was determined. The ability of multislice angio-CT in the characterization of cerebral aneurysms was evaluated: size (slope 1.138, r = 0.79, p < 0.001), orientation (accuracy 91.2 %), thrombosis, calcification, origin of arteries, apical teat. Conclusion: Multislice angio-CT of the Willis circle is a worthy tool in the detection and characterization of cerebral aneurysms. Its ability to detect aneurysm partial thrombosis is higher than that of conventional cerebral angiography. Angio-CT allows for efficient planning of cerebral angiography and affords useful information in the determination of the therapeutical strategy. ",

There were 32 females and 18 males entered into the study. The CTA images were separately reviewed by two Consultant Neuroradiologists, who were blinded to the DSA findings. The CT angiograms were assessed for aneurysm size and location, in addition to adjacent vascular anatomy. The results were compared with DSA. Results: From the initial group of 50 patients with SAH, no aneurysm was evident on either CTA or DSA in eleven. Of the remaining 39 patients, 51 aneurysms of varying types were diagnosed. CTA accurately diagnosed 48 of these (sensitivity 94 %). Of the 3 intracranial aneurysms missed on CTA all of these were under 3 mm in size. Specificity of CTA is 98 %. Conclusion: CTA would appear to be a safe and relatively reliable alternative to DSA in the management of acutely ruptured intra-cranial aneurysms. Other advantages include speed, cost and its non-invasive nature. In addition it may be of benefit in the follow-up of known aneurysms. In view of these results we have since modified our protocol to improve sensitivity further. Purpose: To evaluate the blood flow dynamics in patients with arterio-venous malformations (AVMs) before and after radio-therapy treatment. Patients and methods: Two different MR imaging techniques were used in a total of 25 patients. A non enhanced dynamic MRA based on a blood bolus tagging technique and a new contrast enhanced projection MRA (fluoroscopic MRA/ MRDSA) based on a fast FLASH sequence were used to assess the angioarchitecture of the malformation as well as the hemodynamics, mainly based on a calculated shunt-time between feeding arteries and draining veins. The conventional TOF-MRA and conventional DSA served as an internal standard. MRDSA was performed with a bolus injection of 0.1 mmol/kg BW of Gadodiamide (Omniscan\u00ae, Nycomed-Amersham) at an infusion rate of 3 cm 3 /s and a time resolution of 400 ms per projection. Images were assessed in regard to vessel detection and demarcation as well as the hemodynamic aspects of the malformation. Results: Both techniques were able to assess the angioarchitecture of the AVM in all patients. The arterial feeder, the AVM nidus and the venous drainage pattern could be clearly delineated. The time resolution of the non enhanced tagging technique was substantial better enabling a more precise assessment of the hemodynamics.",

Bonaf\u00e9; Montpellier/FR Purpose: Rupture of an anterior communicating aneurysm (AcomA) is associated with substantial cognitive and psychopathological dysfunction, disability in psychosocial activities and daily living. We report the clinical and neuropsychological outcome of 35 patients treated by embolization of an AcomA; subgroup of our base of 61 Acom Aneurysm. Material and method: From September 1998 to May 2001 we treated 61 ruptured AcomA by coil embolization. At admission age, aneurysm description, initial clinical WFNS score, Fisher grade were collected. At discharge occlusion rate, Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) and complications were reported. We followed patients at 6 months, and 1 year with clinical evaluation and an angiographic control. Out of 61 patients, we submitted 35 patients to an extensive range of tests: comprehensive batteries of neuropsychological and psychopathological tests, daily living scales. Cognitive outcome was evaluated using global rating scale (Mattis), and assessment for attention, executive functions, explicit, implicit memory and psychiatric associated disorders. Results: We treated 61 patients using GDC coils. Technical and clinical results are provided. We report our technical complications and complications due to SAH evolution (symptomatic vasospasm, acute hydrocephalus). 35 patients were submitted to the battery of neuropsychological tests. The patient's performances were characterized by neuropsychological deficits, especially impairments in learning and explicit long term memory, associated with functional frontal dysfunction. Conclusion: Aneurysm morphological characteristics and occlusion rate do not influence early clinical evolution in ruptured aneurysm. Patients submitted to a battery of neuropsychological tests showed neuropsychological deficits and frontal dysfunction on mid term follow-up. Purpose: Although preoperative embolization of meningioma is a helpful procedure to minimize bleeding and to facilitate resection, some meningiomas showing lack of vascularity are not suitable for embolization. The DSA itself would therefore be an unnecessary procedure. The goal of our study was to predict poorly vascularized meningiomas using time resolved MRA (TR-MRA). Materials and methods: TR-MRAs were performed on a 1.5 T whole-body unit (Vision, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) in 18 patients with meningioma using a snapshot FLASH optimized for 2D projection (TR/TE 4.2/1.5 ms, slab thickness 45 mm). A standard dose of Gd-DTPA was injected with an automatic injector (volume 15 ml at 3 ml/s). Coronally directed TR-MRA was obtained using single slice, 3 frames/s during 34 seconds without time-interval. TR-MRA, DSA and embolization were done at the same day when possible. Signal intensity (SI) of meningiomas in TR-MRA was graded as 0 if no SI is detected. Faint SI was graded as +, good SI as ++, and dense SI as +++. Grades of SI on TR-MRA of meningiomas and possibility of embolization were analyzed using X 2 -test. Results: In 18 meningiomas, 7 graded as +++, 5 as ++, 3 as +, and 3 as 0 in TR-MRA. Embolization was done in all graded as +++ and ++. However, embolization could not be performed on grade + and 0 due to lack of vascularity from external carotid artery (p = 0.000). Conclusion: TR-MRA is an useful study to avoid unnecessary DSA in cases of meningiomas with lack of vascularity which would not be candidates for embolization. Purpose: Traditionally estimation of pancreatic exocrine function has been invasive e.g. duodenal intubation or non-specific. Secretin MRCP can be used to calculate exocrine flow rates. We compared 29 patients with normal pancreatic morphology and 28 patients with chronic pancreatitis. Materials and methods: Following baseline SSFSE, 0.1 ml/kg IV Secretin was administered and the acquisition repeated every 2 minutes for 7 minutes. The receiver gain was held constant. Flow rate = change in total signal intensity over time divided by the signal intensity of a voxel containing 100 % water. Breath-hold axial T1W images and spiral CT were also performed as part of their work-up. 29 patients had a normal pancreas on CT and ERCP, 28 had chronic pancreatitis of whom 8 had had surgery, pancreatoduodenectomy in 4 and a Puestow procedure in 4. Of the remainder, 15 had severe, 3 moderate and 2 mild chronic pancreatitis.",

A perfusion index as the percentage of maximum signal intensity in the organ relative to the maximum signal intensity in the aorta was calculated. In a prospective study 33 patients underwent a total of 77 examinations. Mean follow-up after transplantation was 98 days (range 7 -486). Perfusion index was used to judge function as good, fair or poor. Results were correlated to clinical course and laboratory data.

Methods: A real time (RT) steady state free precession (SSFP, TrueFisp) sequence was adapted for the examination of the thoracic vasculature. 21 consecutive patients with suspected pulmonary embolism were prospectively examined with MRI using a RT-TrueFisp sequence and contrast enhanced MR-angiography (MRA). The clinical stages of suspected PE were as follows: chronic 4, mild 7, severe 6, massive 4. Results: 71 % of the MRA-Sequences were diagnostic, excluding all patients with massive and some with severe PE. All 21 RT-sequences were diagnostic. All 125 lobar arteries and 85 % of the segmental arteries could be evaluated, segments 4/5 being the most difficult. For the RT-Sequences, no patient preparation, ECG or breathing commands were needed. PE was diagnosed in 67 % of the patients by RT-MR. In 6 patients with PE, MRA detected 9 additional thrombotic segments. Two diseases mimicking pulmonary embolism could be diagnosed. In all remaining patients with clinically suspected severe and massive pulmonary embolism, thrombotic material could be visualized in the pulmonary arteries. Chronic and acute pulmonary embolism could be differentiated, and the effect of thrombolytic therapy on thrombus size could be visualized. Conclusion: RT-MRI allowed the examination of any patient regardless of his clinical condition in 3 min and required no preparation. Therefore, the range of indications for MRI in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism is extended. The well established MRA technique has advantages in patients able to sustain apnoea.",

Methods and materials: From February 2000 to July 2001, 161 patients (92 male, 69 female; age: m = 55.2 a \u00b1 18.1 a) with suspected PE were examined on a MSCT (Somatom Volume Zoom; Siemens, Germany). After intravenous injection of 120 cm 3 of contrast-medium, thin collimation chest CT was performed. CTP was added if PE was present or previous examinations and clinical signs suggested deep venous thrombosis (DVT). The latter was performed using a 4 \u00d7 5 mm protocol (slice thickness 7 mm, reconstruction increment 6 mm). Venous phase scanning was completed at the level of the popliteal fossa 3 minutes after contrastmedium injection. Results: 62 patients in our series suffered from PE. 47 of these had additional deep venous thrombosis (78.3 %). The latter was ruled out in 13 patients, one patient with PE did not receive this additional examination protocol due to their poor clinical condition, one subsegmental PE was initially not detected. Of the 99 patients without PE, 47 also received indirect CTP. In 10 cases DVT was proven, which was already known from previous examinations in 8 patients. Only in 2/47 patients (4.3 %) was a previously undiagnosed DVT found, despite exclusion of PE.",

            "text": "The examination protocol presented is suitable for clinical use in patients with suspected PE and offers detailed examination of the venous system. If DVT is not likely, additional CTP is not recommended if PE has been ruled out by MSCT. Methods: Patients with severe chronic CTPH were evaluated using multislice CT and selective pulmonary DSA for operative treatment planning. CT findings and angiographic findings were correlated at the level of major arteries, interlobar arteries, segmental and subsegmental arteries. Diagnostic criteria included patency or occlusion, thromboembolic deposits, webs, bands, and anatomical allocation of the respective findings. Results: In 14 consecutive patients with severe CTPH, CT and DSA findings of 994 pulmonary vessel segments from major to subsegmental arteries were separately analysed. Using multislice CT 30 segments were insufficiently detected (25 subsegments, 5 segments) compared to 50 segments in DSA (37 subsegments, 11 segments, and 2 major arteries). Predominantly segment III and less often segment I arteries were insufficiently detected due to the position of the pigtail catheter. Concerning inconspicuous vessles versus occlusion or any thromboembolic alterations, the diagnostic concordance of both methods overall was 67 %, was 79.4 % for segmental arteries and 63.6 % for subsegmental arteries. Concerning patency versus complete occlusion diagnostic concordance overall was 82.4 %, was 88.6 % for segmental arteries and 77.1 % for subsegmental arteries. DSA was superior for detection of peripheral thromboembolic alterations. CT was superior for anatomical allocation. Conclusion: Multislice CT is suitable for diagnosis of CTPH on segmental and subsegmental level. However, for planning of pulmonary thrombendarterectomy both modalities, multislice CT and selective pulmonary DSA, are still necessary for exact anatomical allocation and precise visualisation of thromboembolic findings. epidemiologic, clinical and morphologic criteria as listed below. (Advanced disease was defined as hepatic insufficiency leading to OLT within the subsequent 2 years). Results: Common and characteristic findings were as follows: 81 % of patients were women with the onset of disease (diagnosis) in middle age (mean, 50.7 years, range, 26 to 71 years). The average time from diagnosis to liver transplantation was 6.1 years (range, 0.5 to 20 years). CT findings in advanced PBC often resembled those seen in other forms of cirrhosis with a small heterogeneous liver, varices and splenomegaly. The liver in less advanced disease was usually enlarged or normal in size, with a smooth contour, little atrophy and lace-like fibrosis and regenerative nodules in nearly a third. Even patients with less advanced disease frequently had varices (62 %) and ascites (24 %). Prominent lymphadenopathy was seen in 88 % of all cases. Hepatocellular carcinoma was found in only 4 patients, 2 of whom also had chronic hepatitis C. Only two patients had recurrence of PBC following OLT Conclusion: PBC is an important cause of liver failure with distinctive clinical and CT findings that may allow confident diagnosis and management.

Color-doppler ultrasoud (US), helical-CT and arteriography were performed in all patients and MRI in 4 patients. Nodules location, number, size, density or signal, homogeneity and pattern of vascularition were evaluated. Hepatic vascularization, the morphologic type of the shunt and portal hypertension features were also analyzed. These findings were correlated to pathological results (transcutaneous biopsy of the nodules (n = 3); transplantation (n = 2)). Results: Sonography and angiography demonstrated a portohepatic venous shunt (persistent Arantius ductus (n = 1), congenital absence of portal vein (n = 2), left portohepatic venous shunt (n = 1), left portoatrial shunt (n = 1)). Hepatic arterialisation were observed in segment where no portal flow was seen and where hepatic nodules were present. The number of nodules in each patients was at least 3 with a size ranging from 1 to 12 cm. Most lesions were heterogeneous, hypoechoic on US, hypodense on CT, hyperintense on T1, slightly hyperintense on T2 and enhanced slightly and heterogeneously on arterial phase after contrast injection. Histological results showed nodular hyperplasia in the liver suggestive of focal nodular hyperplasia in all cases and adenoma in one case. Conclusion: These findings emphasised the hypothesis that nodular transformation of the liver is probably due to the lack of portal blood flow and hepatic arterialisation and is usually of benign type.",

Aim of study was to assess if there is any difference in imaging pictures between secretory and nonsecretory carcinoid and toconsider both techniques. Overall 50 patients, all with confirmed carcinoid. There were 31 patients with primary disease. Half of the patients had secreting tumours with carcinoid syndrome.

Bautz; Erlangen/DE Purpose: The high frequent acquisition of multislice CT data after contrast medium bolus injection allows quantification of tumor perfusion. It was our goal to assess therapy induced changes of tumor perfusion early after initiation of lymphoma treatment using dedicated software to calculate parametric images. Method: Dynamic MSCT was performed in 19 patients with lymphoma before and 7 days after initiation of chemotherapy. After automatic bolus injection of 80 ml contrast medium (flow 8 ml/s), two 10 mm-sections through the largest tumor region were scanned for 40 s (Siemens Somatom Volume Zoom). The arterial input function was derived from the largest arterial vessel in the field of view. Perfusion indices were calculated using graphical analysis and displayed as parametric color coded images. Results: At baseline, all lymphoma lesions were visible in perfusion images by an enhanced perfusion index (0.474 ml/min/ml). Seven days after initiation of chemotherapy, tumor perfusion decreased by 46 % in high grade NHL and Hodgkin's lymphoma, whereas in two patients with low grade NHL the perfusion index increased by 55 %. In contrast, 2D-tumor size only decreased by 19 % and 11 %, resp. Conclusion: These results indicate that chemotherapy-induced changes of tumor perfusion may be assessed by perfusion MSCT and documented in parametric images. In highly responsive tumors like high grade NHL and Hodgkin's lymphoma, therapy induced perfusion changes occur within the first 7 days after therapy and precede morphologic changes. We hypothesize that outcome of therapy may be predicted as early as 7 days after treatment.",

Triple phase helical CT of the abdomen was performed on successive days so that each patient acted as their own control. All patients had intra-abdominal malignancy and the study was approved by the hospital ethics committee. Unenhanced and enhanced CT in the arterial phase and PV phase was performed without (day 1)and with (day 2) secretin (100 IU) given at t = 0 s (n = 10), t = 60 s (n = 5), t = 120 s (n = 5), t = 180 s (n = 4), t = 240 s (n = 4), t = 300 s (n = 3). Percent enhancement of the liver was calculated using ROI's obtained from studies with and without secretin. Results: Overall mean hepatic enhancement in the portal venous phase was 109 % without secretin and 117 % with secretin. The relative increase in hepatic enhancement after secretin when compared to hepatic enhancement without secretin was 13 % at t = 0, 16.6 % at t = 60 s, 24.6 % at t = 120 s, 18.9 % at t = 180, 3.1 % at t = 240 and 19.5 % at t = 300 s. PV/SMV enhancement was significantly increased in all secretin studies (p < 0.05) when compared with non-secretin studies. Conclusion: Secretin administration causes an increase in hepatic enhancement which may lead to better lesion conspicuity. The optimal timing for secretin administration and its effect on lesion-liver contrast differences will be determined as more patients are recruited. Study completion is expected in November 2001.",

Nagy 3 ; 1 Budapest/HU, 2 Szeksz\u00e1rd/HU, 3 Zalaegerszeg/HU Purpose: Quality indicators are widely used in healthcare. Though imaging is involved in almost all diagnostic procedure, few quality indicators are accepted in radiology. Method: Repeated X-ray examination data were collected in 3 hospitals. The 3-month multicenter study aimed to develop an indicator as well as to test the indicator development method itself, using common data sheets. In the 886 repeated examinations, the influence of different reasons of repetition was analysed. Results: 21 causes were identified. Inappropriate exposition or positioning were leading causes, in 71.6 % of the cases in Hospital 1, 72.6 % in Hospital 2 and 22.0 in Hospital 3. Failure of the equipment was the second cause: 25.0 %, 7.9 % and 0.1 %, respectively. Low rates in Hospital 3 can be attributed to the newly equipped digital X-ray department. In other words: Hospital 1 and 2 pay the price of the lack of investment with repeated examinations. Day-section has a higher influence than workload: though the majority of the examinations were carried out during normal hours, 23.7 % of the repetitions occur on night duty. Nearly half of the technicians involved found the data sheet too detailed and they proposed to modify HIS for automatic registration. As repeated examination means increased risk for the patient and the institution, economical consequences will be demonstrated. Conclusion: Repeated X-ray examination proved to be an appropriate quality indicator, as it is profession-specific, relevant and convenient for benchmarking. Data collection is easy and economic data can be linked. Quality management can be based on reason analysis. Materials and methods: Of 59 patients who were referred for percutaneous drainage of hepatic abscess between 1995 and 2001, cases with incorrect diagnosis or without pre-procedural contrast-enhanced CT were excluded, and 78 abscesses in 47 patients (29 -79 years, M:F = 35:12) were included. 24 patients had the predisposing factor such as hepatocholedocholithiasis (n = 7), the history of biliary (n = 6) or gastrointestinal (n = 5) malignancy, or others.

The liver is the most commonly damaged organ in children following blunt abdominal trauma. A conservative non-operative approach is now the recognised standard of care. Computerised Tomography (CT) is the primary imaging modality of choice. This conservative approach can result in bile duct damage remaining undetected for several days. We have evaluated the pre-emptive use of TBIDA hepatoscintigraphy, to detect biliary leakage prior to the patient becoming symptomatic. At Birmingham Children's Hospital, all patients who have a history of trauma and clinical suspicion of abdominal injury undergo an abdominal CT. In those cases where there was liver fracture greater than 4.0 cm or involving the portahepatitis, a TBIDA study was performed. 21 patients underwent an abdominal CT abdomen. 7 patients had a significant liver injury, all with fluid in the peritoneum and additionally had a TBIDA study. In 2 patients the TBIDA demonstrated activity within the peritoneal cavity. Intraoperative cholangiograms confirmed the biliary leaks that were surgically stented. Both patients were asymptomatic with no evidence of a biliary peritonitis. The TBIDA in a third patient demonstrated a biloma that on follow-up ultrasound has shown to be shown to be the site of a portovenous fistula. All patients showed good recovery and returned to a normal lifestyle. TBIDA hepatoscintigraphy, when used pre-emptively, can detect biliary damage prior to the development of clinical symptoms. This early detection improves surgical outcome and reduces hospital stay. The investigation also allows the detection of other potential intrahepatic complications.",

Neuwirth; Prague/CZ Purpose: Healing of a stricture by scar formation after balloon dilatation results in narrowing of the eosophageal lumen and reccurrence of dysphagia. Consequently repeated dilatations are usually necessary. The authors tried to establish the delay after dilatation when the procedure could be considered successful and further dilatation or surgery was not indicated. Methods and materials: Eosophageal strictures in 49 children were treated by 189 balloon dilatations in total. 20 children had an anastomotic stricture after surgery for eosophageal atresia, 12 had a reflux stricture, 6 a tight cuff after Nissen fundoplication causing achalasia, 6 a corrosive stricture, 4 congenital stenosis and 1 a stricture after radiation. Dilatations were considered successful, when absence of dysphagia lasted for at least 1 year after dilatation and the patient hadn't undergone surgery. Results: One procedure completely treated the stricture in 11 children (22 %). None of them had surgery. Repeated procedures were neccessary in 38 patients (78 %). The delay between dilatations in the case of repeated procedures ranged from 1 week to 3 years. Dilatation avoided surgery in 27 cases (56 %). Only 6 of these patients had more than a 6 month delay between procedures. The remaining 11 children (22 %) required surgery after repeated unsuccessful dilatations. However in none was there a need for repeat dilatation later than 6 months following a previous procedure. Conclusion: The authors conclude that a delay of 6 months after dilatation is the key time for evaluation of success rate of eosophageal balloon dilatation.",

Blickman; Nijmegen/NL Purpose: To make the imager and clinician aware that colonic duplication may present at birth, associated with other congenital anomalies or late, as an isolated finding. In the latter instance, the duplication almost always features connecting lumens. Material and methods: We reviewed the clinical and radiological features of 9 cases of colonic duplication over the last 10 years. There were 7 girls and 2 boys. Their age at presentation was either newborn (6, all girls) or between 4 and 11 years old (2 boys, 1 girl). All had contrast enemas, and 3 underwent abdominal CT. Results: Those that presented at birth had multiple associated congenital anomalies, including partial and complete VATER associations (5, all girls), duplication of the bladder in 2, uterus and vagina in 2, as well as situs inversus totalis in 1 girl. The older presenting children all had long-standing symptoms of constipation and distended abdomens. All duplications had connecting lumens. Conclusion: Duplication of the colon is a rare congenital anomaly. This report illustrates that there are 2 peaks of presentation: perinatally and later in childhood. Furthermore, in the former group multiple associated congenital anomalies are present in all (or almost all) cases. As opposed to other GI duplications, these colonic duplications displayed connecting lumens.",

Ring; Graz/AT Purpose: To prospectively investigate the accuracy of renal volume assessment using three-dimensional ultrasound (3DUS) compared to the results of 2DUS, CT/ MRI, or scintigraphy in neonates, infants and children. Methods and materials: 60 patients (mean age 9.81 \u00b1 8.1 years) underwentadditional to conventional US and other conventional imaging as appropriate -3DUS of the kidney for anatomical and volumetrical assessment. 3DUS was performed with a Voluson (Kretztechnik/GE, Austria/USA) or an external 3D-system (Echotech/GE, Germany/USA). Volume calculations were performed in 2DUS applying the ellipsoid equation V = (p/6) \u00d7 L \u00d7 W \u00d7 AP, for 3DUS using the system specific volumetric software; in CT/MRI volume was calculated by planimetric analysis, and for scintigraphy the renal volume was quantified as relative renal volume. Volume measurement focused on renal parenchyma, a dilated renal collecting system was subtracted. Results: In 55/60 patients at least one 3DUS acquisition/kidney was of diagnostic quality. 3DUS volume measurements were accurate compared to CT/MRI (\u00b1 5 %). 2DUS volume estimates showed a larger variation and difference (\u00b1 10 %), particularly in kidneys with dilated collecting systems or scars, volumes differed significantly. There was a good correlation of relative renal volume in 3DUS compared to scintigraphy in patients without acute pyelonephritis or other perfusion alterations. Conclusion: 3DUS is applicable to the paediatric genito-urinary tract. 3DUS is a more accurate method than 2DUS for assessment of (relative) renal parenchymal volume, particularly valuable in patients with hydronephrosis. 3DUS improves sonographic potential and can be considered a useful adjunct to conventional imaging.",

Ransley; London/GB Purpose: To compare the imaging appearances on both micturating cystourethrography (MCUG)and ultrasound (U/S)before and after surgery for posterior urethral valves (PUV). To determine the clinical effectiveness of routine postsurgical MCUG. Materials and methods: The imaging findings of 43 boys, of whom 7 had two operations for PUV were reviewed. MCUG was performed before and after each operation making 100 MCUG in total. Features evaluated included the appearances of the bladder, posterior and anterior urethra, the presence of vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) and the contemporaneous U/S results. Age at surgery and creatinine results were also noted. Results: Age at surgery ranged from 6 days to 5 years 9 months. 50 % were less than a month at surgery. VUR was detected in 40 % of patients; most of these were unchanged post-operatively. The commonest bladder abnormality was trabeculation (82 %); 75 % were unchanged on follow-up. 50 % of patients had a small volume bladder. When the posterior urethra was visualised it was invariably dilated. 52 % of patients had an apparently narrow anterior urethra initially; most improved on follow-up. The commonest U/S findings were bilateral hydroureteronephrosis (62 %)and bladder wall thickening (42 %), although 4 % of pre-operative U/S were normal. Most patients had little change in U/S features. 78 % had a fall in creatinine post-operatively. Conclusion: A small number of boys with PUV may have normal U/S appearances. Imaging appearances on both MCUG and U/S are frequently unchanged after PUV resection. As patient management depends on several factors including renal function and cystoscopy findings, we question the clinical effectiveness of routine post-operative MCUG.",

Calisti; Rome/IT Introduction: Percutaneous sclerotherapy has gained wide acceptance in the treatment of male and female varicocele. We introduced the percutaneous approach into the paediatric population, because it is minimally invasive, uses local anesthesia, is minimally traumatic and less expensive than a surgical option. We report our 10 year experience with the transbrachial approach. Materials and method: From 1991 to 2000 we have done 425 procedures. Inclusion criteria were positives at physical, Doppler and ultrasound examination for varicocele type I, grade III, and II only if symptomatic. Phlebography was done under local anesthesia, with a transbrachial approach. We first try to enter the right spermatic vein and then work on the left side. Sclerotheraphy was done with tetra-decilsolfato (Trombovar). Follow up with clinical examination was done at 1 -6 -12 months and 6 -12 months with colour-Doppler Ultrasound. Results: Median age was 14.7 years. Symptoms were present in only 3 % of boys. There were 78/425 bilateral varicoceles, 15 on the right and the remainder on the left. There were good clinical results with sclerosis in 95 % of the treated boys. Discussion: Percutaneous sclerotherapy of varicoceles is a safe, effective and less expensive option than surgical therapy, especially in the bilateral form, with a low complication rate. Methods: 20 Patients with fractures of the mandible underwent MRI (Gradient Echo sequences before and after contrast administration). Continuity of the nerve was evaluated by visual inspection, signal intensity was measured by region of interest in 4 different locations.",

Some patients with neurological deficit without disruption of the nerve, showed a decrease of signal intensity distal the fracture. All the other patients without neurological deficit had an increase of signal intensity from proximal to distal. Conclusion: It is possible to detect the disruption of the nerve by MRI. The reason why the signal intensity in some patients decreases seems to be unclear. As we used Gradient Echo sequences, which in particular show blood flow effects, it might be possible to measure a reduced blood circulation in the perineurium distal the fracture by regions of interest. Beside prevention of neurological deficits, this might be another argument for urgent surgical treatment.",

Results: In a cadaver mandible pilot study a strong correlation (R 2 > 0.85) between BMD and the insertion torque of dental implants is demonstrated. Therefore, BMD may serve as an estimate of achievable primary implant stability and thus, as a measure of bone quality. First clinical applications are going to be presented. Conclusion: Since a correlation with mechanical bone properties and accepted measures of primary implant anchorage has clearly been established, preoperatively determined BMD values of the jaw bone could help to assess possible implant sites to optimize primary stability and long term prognosis of the implants by guiding the surgeon through the choice of best suited implant site or implant type and preparation technique.",

Methods: We reviewed 95 coronal sinus CT examinations (CT-Secura, Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands) from non-selected clinical patients. Sinus CT was performed with the patient in the prone position with a collimation of 3 mm from the ventral border of the frontal sinus to the posterior edge of the sphenoid sinus. Reconstruction was done using a high-resolution bone algorhythm. The frequency and size of hypodense periapical lesions was determined by two radiologists in a consensus reading. Frequency and severity of artifacts from restoration dentistry and disease of the maxillary sinus was recorded. Results: In 4 out of 95 patients (4.2 %) periapical disease (CAP) could be dignosed. In 40 of these 95 patients metal artifacts reduced the image quality of the periapical region. The regions 16 and 26 were most affected by artifacts. There was no statistically significant difference between the site of periapical disease and concomitant sinus disease. Conclusion: In up to 4 percent of non-selected patients, referred for sinus imaging, we found periapical dental disease on coronal standard CT.

Czerny; Vienna/AT Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare radiographic, histological and microbiological findings of patients with atypical non-odontical pain of the jaw. Patients and methods: From 1998 to 2001 20 out-patients with jaw pain of uncertain origin were prospectively analysed by panoramic radiographs and CT following open biopsy. The axial CT scans (Philips CT Secura; 120 kV, 70 mA, scan time 2 seconds, slice thickness 1 mm, table index 1 mm, high resolution filter) were reformatted using Dental-CT software (Philips EasyVision, Dental Reformatting Package). Usually no contrast enhancing media were given. Inclusion criteria were long-term patient history with pain and/or swelling located in a tooth-free region and unclear conventional and panoramic radiographs. Exclusion criteria were previous fractures, osteoradionecrosis and dental residuals. In this cohort, laboratory parameters were inconclusive. The bicortical bone-biopsies were classified following histological and microbiological findings. Radiographic findings were correlated with the results of the histological and microbiological examinations. Results: 20 patients could be included. No significant correlation between radiological and microbiological or histological findings was found. Histological diagnosis included unspecific post-inflammatory changes, active osteomyelitis and healthy specimen. Conclusion: The use of conventional radiographs, panoramic radiographs and Dental-CT in the diagnosis of chronical atypical non-odontical pain of the jaw should be re-thought. If panoramic radiographs give no appropriate information in finding a focus in chronic pain of a tooth-free region, Dental-CT will not give further information.

Method/materials: 50 consecutive patients with headache referred for a standard dose brain CT and in whom a sinusitis was found or had to be excluded had a second acquisition with a low dose technique (Volume Zoom, Siemens). Following parameters were used for the standard dose acquisition: collimation 4 \u00d7 1 mm, rotation time: 0.75 s, 140 kV, 150 mAs, pitch: 0.875, CTDIW: 57.2 mGy, reconstruction width and increment 1.25 and 0.8 mm; low-dose acquisition: collimation 4 \u00d7 1 mm, rotation time: 0.5 s, 120 kV, 10 mAs, pitch: 2, CTDIW: 2.04 mGy. Coronal, axial and sagital 2 mm thick MPR and selected VRT and VE views were obtained from both native image sets and analysed on workstations by 3 radiologists who had to state the normal or abnormal appearence of 16 different anatomic regions. The effective dose was computer simulated. Results: In 785 of of 800 regions of interest, no difference was found by all 3 readers. In the remaining 15 regions, 2 of 3 readers stated that low-dose and standard dose images were equivalent. Computer simulated effective dose were respectively for standard-dose and low-dose MRDCT of 1.72 and 0.063 mSv. Purpose: Due to the complex anatomy of the facial bones CT examinations of fractures in at least two planes are required for reliable diagnosis and operative planning. However, in some cases examination can be performed in the axial plane only. Therefore high quality MPRs from axial CT-datasets have to be obtained. Aim of this study was to analyse the influence of collimation, reconstructed slice thickness/increment, reconstruction-kernel, tube current and ultra high resolution (UHR) and non-UHR acquisition on detectability of facial fractures. Methods and materials: A cadaver head with artificial blunt facial trauma was examined using a Siemens Somatom Volume Zoom unit (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Acquisition parameters were: collimation 2 \u00d7 0.5 vs 4 \u00d7 1 vs 4 \u00d7 2.5 mm, tube current 120 vs 90 vs 60 mAs, UHR and non-UHR, reconstructed slice thickness/increment 0.5/0.3 vs 1.0/0.6 vs 3/1.5 mm. Out of these volume datasets coronar and sagittal MPRs were obtained with the following reformation parameters: slice thickness 0.5 -3 mm, overlapping 0.5 -3 mm. 6 fracture locations were scored blinded by 5 experienced radiologists. Inter-observer variability was determined with the \u039a-test. Differences in fracture detection of the respective algorithms were assessed with Wilcoxon-and Friedman-tests to p < 0.05. Results: Detectability of fractures was higher in 2 \u00d7 0.5 mm collimation (p = 0.001 to p < 0.0005). UHR is superior to non-UHR (p = 0.001). 120 mAs exceeded 90 and 60 mAs (p < 0.0005) in UHR and non-UHR, respectively. Thin MPRs (0.5/ 0.5 mm, 1/0.5 mm) are superior to thick MPRs (p = 0.023 to p < 0.0005), whereas there is no significant difference between 0.5/0.5 mm and 1/0.5 mm (p = 0.317). Conclusion: Our data reliably prove that for subtle fractures thin MPRs (0.5/0.5 mm, 1/0.5 mm) should be obtained out of thin slices (0.5 mm) with 120 mAs in UHR.",

Nadtotchi; Moscow/RU Purpose: Diagnosis of facial soft tissues angiodysplasia (FAD) is not hard because of its well-known clinical symptoms. Ultrasonography with color Doppler mapping, invasive selective and super selective X-ray angiography are usually used for the evaluation of tumor volume, its syntopy, morphological structure variants and identification of main supplying vessels. The main task of this presentation is to the show possibilities of noninvasive MR-imaging (MRI) and MR-angiography (MRA) in FAD diagnosis. Methods & materials: 38 patients with different forms of FAD were examined. All MRI and MRA examinations were obtained on a 1 T MRI system Harmony (Siemens, Germany) and were compared with noninvasive ultrasound and invasive X-ray angiographic data. Results: In 7 patients MRI has found the following arterial abnormalities: different forms of unclosed Willis ring (4 cases); significant middle cerebral arteries asymmetry (4 cases); lateral choroid artery displacement (1 case). In 5 patients vascular malformations were found: intracranial arterial malformations in 4 patients, meningeal venous malformations in 1 case. The disadvantages of MRI were: the long time of examination, the necessity of sedation in young patients (younger than 5 -8 years) and in patients with claustrophobia. Conclusion: Use of noninvasive MRA made it possible to establish that in some cases FAD was an external manifestation of a segmental angiodysplasia which could be diagnosed only by the combination of noninvasive ultrasound and invasive X-ray angiography. MRI and MRA allow to obtain the same information about FAD as traditional methods but has additional advantages in diagnosis of such lesions due to opportunities for intracranial arterial and venous visualization.",

This application of RISM-technology is very progressive because: (1) it allows an increase in both the quality of preparation of endoprothesis and in their organospecificity; (2) it allows a decrease in the duration of operation of 1.5 -2.0 hours. Where it was necessary to enlarge the mandible with compression-distraction apparatus, RISM allowed definition of construction and optimal position of compression-distraction devices. Conclusion: RISM will be used not only as diagnostic model, but as important and powerful aid in the different branches of cranio-facial surgery. That is why we are sure that the system \"CT -*.STL -RISM\" is a real step in the future of surgery. Purpose: Investigate the utility of CT Cystography in the study of bladder tumors. Method and materials: 10 patients with bladder tumours, ranging from solitary polypoid lesion to multiple endoluminal lesions with diffuse alterations of mucosal surface, were studied with CT cystography and the results compared with conventional cystoscopy. Radiologists were blinded to the results of cystoscopy. CT cystography was performed with one helical acquisition of 3 mm slices at pitch 1.5, with images reconstructed each 1 mm. In all patients, the bladder was inflated with room air via a Foley catheter. The data were then downloaded to a workstation and reviewed, both on axial 2D and with 3D-intraluminal navigation. Results: Tumour lesions (12) of the 8 patients having localized lesions were recognized on the CT data. This included one small lesion less than 5 mm. In the two patients having diffuse bladder involvement, CT cystography was able to detect the major polypoid lesions, but also identify a diffuse irregularity of the bladder inner surface corresponding to the spread of the lesions over the entire mucosal surface. CT axial data also predicted the extra-serosal spread of the disease by contiguity to the inner part of the anterior abdominal wall, which was confirmed by open surgery the day after CT cystography. Urologists found the 3D images very similar to their own cystoscopy images. Conclusions: Recognition of bladder wall tumours is feasible by means of CT cystography. Lesions equal or bigger than 5 mm were shown.",

Stenzl, D. zur Nedden, F. Frauscher; Innsbruck/AT Purpose: We evaluated the feasibility of three-dimensional (3D) surface and volume rendered ultrasonography (US) for detection and differentiation of urinary bladder lesions. Methods and materials: Fourteen patients suspicious for bladder tumours on two-dimensional (2D) US underwent 3D imaging of the bladder prior to cystoscopy and transurethral bladder biopsy. The suspicious areas on 2D US were evaluated using the PerspectiveTM 3D US (Acuson, MoutainView, CA). Tumour volume was calculated using the built-in software. Documentation was done on video and printouts. The US findings of 2D and 3D US were compared with endoscopic findings and the biopsy results. Results: Eight of 14 patients (57 %) had biopsy proven bladder cancers. In addition to conventional 2D US, the mean time for the assessment of 3D data sets was 2.5 minutes (range: 2.0 -4.0 min). 3D US allowed a better visualization of the inner contour, corresponding to the mucosal layer of the bladder. 3D surface and volume rendered US data sets, enabled the correct diagnose of a benign lesion in 5 of 6 patients, and of cancer in 7 of 8 patients. This revealed an overall accuracy of 85 % for differentiating benign from malignant lesions. The tumour volume was overestimated \u2265 20 % in 4 of 8 patients with cancer compared to cystoscopy measurements. Conclusions: 3D volume and surface rendered US improves the differentiation between benign and malignant lesions of the urinary bladder, compared with conventional 2D US. This technique requires only a short additional examination time and does not put any burden on the patient.",

David 1 ; 1 Rome/IT, 2 Grottaferrata/IT Purpose: To increase the accuracy of MRI in the detection and local staging of bladder tumours by using FLAIR sequences. Method and materials: 32 patients with bladder tumours detected by US underwent MRI using 0.5 and 1.5 T superconductive magnet. We performed SE T1weighted (TR: 500 ms, TE: 30 ms), TSE T2-weighted (TR: 2500 ms, TE: 120 ms) and FLAIR sequences (TR: 6000 ms, TE: 150 ms, TI: 2000 ms, N.Ex.: 4; Acq.time: 7 min 30 s) on axial scans. The contrast to lesion ratio was evaluated in all sequences. All the patients underwent cystoscopy with transurethral biopsy and 14 had subsequent cystectomy. Results: In comparison with other sequences, FLAIR sequence was more sensitive in the detection of bladder neoplasms. This sequence demonstrates the hyperintense signal of bladder neoplasms from the filled bladder lumen with no signal. The sensitivity in the identification of bladder neoplasms was 100 % with FLAIR sequences, 89.6 % with TSE T2-weighted sequences and 86.2 % with SE T1-weighted sequences. That was due to the higher signal to lesion ratio of the FLAIR sequences in comparison with the others. In fact on FLAIR sequences the mean value of contrast to lesion ratio of bladder neoplasm was 33.1 while on SE T1-weighted sequences and TSE T2-weighted sequences was respectively 15.2 and 29.2. FLAIR sequences allowed the detection of small papillomas (less than 2 mm). TSE T2-weighted sequences were more sensitive in the study of bladder wall infiltration. Conclusions: FLAIR sequences were more sensitive in the detection of bladder neoplasms, due to their higher contrast to lesion ratio and can be very helpful in the visualization of small papillomas, especially when multifocal. Purpose: Evaluation of the diagnostic performance of virtual MR-cystoscopy for the assessment of bladder tumours. Materials and methods: 35 patients with bladder tumours were examined with a 1.5 T scanner, using a T2-weighted 3D-TSE-sequence (TR = 2911 ms, TE = 500 ms) with a voxel size of 1.1 \u00d7 1.0 \u00d7 1.5 mm 3 . In 10 patients the new \"sensitivity-encoding\"-technique (SENSE) was used, which allows a higher spatial resolution without increasing scanning time. The bladder-wall was divided into 6 re-gions, which were analysed separately for the presence of tumours by 3 radiologists without knowledge of the tumour location. Findings of conventional cystoscopy and operation served as standard of reference. Results: 39 of 43 tumours were detected by virtual cystoscopy with 6 false positive results, resulting in an overall sensitivity of 90 % and a specificity of 95 %. All tumours larger than 1 cm (21/21, sensitivity 100 %) and 17 of 22 tumours smaller than 1 cm (sensitivity 79 %) were detected. The tumours missed had a size of 5 mm or smaller. On the average, the time needed for virtual-endoscopic reconstruction was 15 minutes. With the new SENSE-technique, spatial resolution could be improved without increasing scan-time. Limitations of virtual cystoscopy are the detection of flat lesions and the differentiation between neoplastic and inflammatory lesions. Conclusion: Virtual cystoscopy is a promising, completely non-invasive tool for the diagnosis and follow-up of bladder tumours. By using the new SENSE-technique, the spatial resolution can be further improved.",

Ciccariello, P. Paolantonio, R. Passariello; Rome/IT Purpose: To identify and to stage bladder lesions with MR-cystoscopy combining axial and virtual images. Methods and materials: 31 patients with suspected or known diagnosis of bladder tumour underwent MR cystoscopy. We used natural contrast (urine) for bladder distention, monitoring bladder filling with 3DFLASH sequence with i.v. c.m. (optimal results after 20 min). MRI examinations were performed on a 1.5 T Siemens Vision plus MR imager. We obtained a 2D FSE sequence on axial planes. For evaluation of bladder wall, we performed a T1 weighted GRE sequence, with and without fat suppression, pre and post Gd-DTPA (0.0025 mmol/kg) i.v. injection. A 3DSPGRE sequence was obtained for monitoring bladder filling and for virtual endoscopy analysis, prior to furosemide (1 cm 3 ) administration. Real time endoscopic views were reconstructed using volume-rendering reconstrution algorithm (Vitrea 2.2, Vital Images). Results: Image quality was considered optimal in all cases. A total of 24 lesions were detected and confirmed at biopsy. In 4 cases no lesions were evident at MRI and at conventional cystoscopy. All lesions were evident on morphological T1 and T2 weighted images, with size ranging of 4 -20 mm. MR virtual cystocopy allowed detection of the same lesions than conventional cystoscopy, providing comparable images. However, endoscopic images did not show intramural and extravescical extension of the tumour, whereas these findings were easily appreciated on morphological T1 and T2 weighted images. Conclusions: MR Virtual cystoscopy optimises detection and staging of the bladder pathology by combining axial T1 and T2 weighted and VE images.",

Barentsz 1 ; 1 Nijmegen/NL, 2 Boston, MA/US Purpose: In this study we evaluated the possibilities of 3D modeling in lymph node visualization for surgical guidance during lymph node dissection (LND) in bladder cancer using high resolution MR data. Methods and materials: MRI was performed on a 1.5 T MRI using the 3D T1-w MP-RAGE sequence (TR 11.4, TE 4.4, 1.4 mm isometric voxel-size) with a pelvic phased-array coil. An IV USPIO contrast agent was used to enhance the visibility of the lymph nodes. Bladder, iliac vessels, ureters, obturatory nerves and lymph nodes were manually segmented from the MR data, using the software \"3D-Slicer\". From these segmentations 3D models were created. In total 25 patients with histology proven urinary bladder cancer were evaluated. In all cases LND was performed. Five patients had enlarged metastatic lymph nodes, which were all segmented. During LND the 3D models were used as a guiding tool for removing lymph nodes. Results: In all patients a 3D model was created successfully, showing iliac vessels, ureters, obturatory nerves and lymph nodes. The 3D models allowed accurate localization of normal and metastatic nodes in relation to the surrounding structures, which enabled the surgeons to find and remove more lymph nodes than without this technique. Conclusions: This technique simplifies visualization of lymph nodes. This increases urologist awareness of the exact location of lymph nodes, which results in a higher yield of nodes at node dissection.",

Grimm; Rochester, MN/US Purpose: Current methods for imaging an extended longitudinal field of view (FOV) in MRI either use multiple fixed stations or rapid 2D axial imaging similar to single slice, helical CT. The purpose of this work was to develop a method for 3D MR imaging of an arbitrarily long FOV using continuous table motion. Methods and materials: A method was developed in which data are collected as the table is moved continuously through the MR scanner gantry. After Fourier transformation along the readout direction, every echo is assigned to hybrid (x, ky, kz) space, with longitudinal (x) location determined by table position at the time of the echo. As the table moves, all desired phase encodings are measured periodically. The method was tested in phantom, animal, and human studies. Table velocity ranged from 0.8 to 3.0 cm/s. The longitudinal FOV for readout ranged from 15 to 30 cm, and the total FOV was as large as 170 cm. Results: Complete 3D image sets were formed of objects up to ten times longer than the FOV of the acquisition. Correction for position at sub-pixel precision is critical to suppress ghosting artifacts. Contrast-enhanced studies in pigs demonstrate the ability to follow the contrast bolus in peripheral runoff studies. Results in humans suggest the feasibility of whole body imaging. Conclusions: 3D MR acquisition during continuous table motion has been demonstrated. It offers potentially reduced acquisition time vs. fixed station 3D methods and improved SNR vs. rapid serial 2D axial acquisition.",

Kalender; Erlangen/DE Purpose: Assessment of spatial resolution in T1-weighted TSE sequences with different echo train lengths (ETLs) compared with an SE sequence using phantom measurements and examination of healthy volunteers. Materials and methods: T1-weighted TSE sequences with different ETLs (3, 5, 9) and an SE sequence with identical pixel size (0.8 mm) were evaluated with a custom-built resolution phantom offering resolution patterns from 0.1 mm to 1.5 mm in steps of 0.1 mm and in 25 healthy volunteers focusing on the cranial nerves. The resolution in the phantom images was assessed visually, and the standard deviation in an ROI containing the 0.8 mm stack was evaluated. Image quality and delineation of cranial nerves (II, III, V) of the in vivo measurements were assessed by an experienced radiologist blinded to the sequence technique. Statistical evaluation of the visual evaluation was done using Wilcoxon's test (p < 0.05). Results: The visual evaluation of phantom images yielded identical results for the SE and the TSE sequences with short ETLs (3, 5); for an ETL of 9 the spatial resolution was deteriorated. The quantitative evaluation, however, showed a continuous decrease of the standard deviation with increasing ETL. Image quality of in vivo images and delineation of cranial nerves was significantly superior in SE images compared with TSE images -even if a very short ETL was applied. Conclusion: Qualitative as well as quantitative evaluation of spatial resolution and anatomical details correspondingly revealed disadvantageous results for T1weighted TSE sequences with increasing ETL. This result was even more pronounced in the in vivo examinations.",

Materials and methods: The temperatures occuring in long wires placed in a 1.5 T MRI (Philips, Gyroscan Intera) were measured. The temperature increases (\u03b4T) at the tip of the electrode were determined using a MR-compatible opticalfiber-temperature system. The end of the wire was surrounded by 3 cm 2 of a 0.9% NaCl solution. The length and the position of the wire were tested as parameters influencing the HF-induced increases in temperature. Furthermore the influence of the sequence was taken into account. Result: The temperature increase of the wire aligned parallel to the z-direction and symmetric to the isocentrum showed a significant dependence on the length. A resonance length of about 2 m could be observed, with a \u00e4T of 30\u00b0C at the tip located in the saline solution during a TSE-sequence (SAR = 3.9 W/kg). By moving the wire out of the isocentrum in x or y direction, the heating effect exceeded 100\u00b0C at the electrode tip. The \u00e4T fell below 2\u00b0C, if the wire length was different",

Materials and methods: Liver R2* values were calculated in 10 thalassaemic patients, and 10 normal subjects on an 1.5 T MRI system using a breathhold multislice-double-echo spoiled GRE sequence with initial parameters: TR/TE1/TE2 160/ 2.7/5.3 ms. The sequence was repeated four times, each time altering inter-echo time spacing. T2* calculated image maps were post-proccessingly reconstructed using four different fitting methods (a, b, c, d) . Methods (a) and (b) were based on a simple linear regression model applied to image pixel data. Methods (c) and (d) were based on a weighted linear regression model on which pixel data were weighted according to background image random noise figures. Results: Differences of mean R2* values between patients and normal subjects were considered extremely significant (t = 19.25, p < 0.0001). R2* values correlated much closer with LIC levels (r = 0.89, p < 0.005) when using weighted linear regression models (c) and (d) than when using normal regression ones (a) and (b) (r = 0.85, p < 0.005). R2* were moderately correlated to SFC values regardless the use of the regression model (r = 0.6, p < 0.05). R2* values were linearly correlated with LIC [R2 \u00d7 (s \u22121 ) = 4.94 + 93.94 LIC (mg/g) \u22121 , r = 0.89, p < 0.005] Conclusion: R2* when calculated using weighted regression methods on 1.5 T systems seem to be a valuable means for the evaluation of liver iron overload when LIC does not exceed 8 mg/g (liver dry weight).",

Reiser 1 ; 1 Munich/DE, 2 Salt Lake City, UT/US Purpose: In a MRI-hyperthermia hybrid-system T1 relaxation-time changes are investigated for monitoring hyperthermia of deeply seated tumors. A water-bolus is needed for power transmission into the patient body. The signal of this bolus limits image quality by signal compression and artifacts. This can be avoided by using D2O which would result in additional technical effort and high costs. The purpose of our study is to improve image quality, spatial and temporal resolution by using a paramagnetic suspension of magnetite instead. Material and methods: All experiments were done on the hybrid-system which consists of a 0.2 T open MR-system and a hyperthermia system with a MR-compatible phased array applicator and an integrated MR receive-coil. The tested paramagnetic suspension was a commercially available ferrofluid (MSG W11, Ferrofluidics Corp.), normally used for material separation. A polyamidacryl gelphantom mimicking the human body was used for heating experiments. Results: We found ferrofluid in a low concentration as a useful substitute. In the 0.2 T system a concentration of 0.25 % showed optimum results. Below 0.2 % the bolus is still slightly visible and above 0.3 % the MR system is no longer tuneable. No artifacts are induced in this concentration-range. Conclusion: By using the new bolus-filling an extinction of the bolus artifacts and a significant improvement in SNR, spatial and temporal resolution are possible. This method of signal extinction in MRI may be adapted to other experimental demands where MR-invisible fluids are necessary.",

Methods and materials: 38 consecutive patients underwent 1.5 T abdominal MR imaging. Two radiologists evaluated the MR images and found that the liver size appeared normal in 27 and increased in 11 cases.

Results: For both subgroups of patients with normal and increased liver size, it was found that 100 -150 test points counted on 7 -8 systematically sampled MR sections may provide reliable liver volume estimations with a coefficient of error (CE) of less than 5 %.

Gourtsoyiannis; Iraklion/GR Purpose: To determine patient effective dose and associated radiogenic risk from the transmission scanning performed during cardiac SPECT myocardial perfusion studies to correct scintigraphic images for attenuation and scatter effects. Materials and methods: Transmission scans were obtained using an OPTIMA NX GE system, which involved an L-shaped dual headed gamma camera equipped with transmission scan hardware. Two flat scan boxes each containing a collimated rod source of gadolinium 153 were mounted on the gantry opposite each detector. A Rando anthropomorphic phantom was used to determine radiation dose from transmission scanning in 14 organs and tissues using 352 thermoluminescent dosemeters. For each projection the resulting effective dose was calculated using the ICRP 60 tissue weighting factors. Radiation risk was determined using age and sex related radiation induced fatal cancer risk factors. Results: The effective dose corresponding to a typical 5 s acquisition per transmission scan was 620 pSv. The organs receiving the highest amount of radiation dose is the lung and the oesophagus. The average lifetime risk for fatal malignancy is 4.9 \u00d7 10 \u22128 for US and 3.9 \u00d7 10 \u22128 for UK population.

Images were assessed by two independent CT-experienced radiologists. CT scans were analyzed for the following criteria: contrast of wall versus lumen (W/L), contrast of pathological wall versus lumen (P/L), distension of anal verge, distension of colon and artefacts (Ar). A rating scale of 1 (no) to 5 (severe) was used. Interobserver variability was assessed by kappa statistics. Results: Mean rating values of methylcellulose were higher in contrast of wall/ lumen (4.66 \u00b1 0.6), pathological wall/lumen (4.73 \u00b1 0.5) and least rate of artefacts (4.13 \u00b1 0.7) than of water (W/L 4.36 \u00b1 0.8; P/L 4.36 \u00b1 0.7; Ar 3.76 \u00b1 0.9) and ultrasound gel (W/L 2.4 \u00b1 0.96; P/L 2.55 \u00b1 1.01; Ar 1.76 \u00b1 0.9). The distension of the anal verge was better in using ultrasound gel (4.5 \u00b1 0.6) and methylcellulose (4.35 \u00b1 0.7) than in water (2.82 \u00b1 1.1). With water the best distension of colon (4.1 \u00b1 1.1) could be obtained, it was nearly equal to methylcellulose (3.82 \u00b1 0.8), but remarkable superior to ultrasound gel (1.5 \u00b1 0.6). Air artefacts only appeared in ultrasoundgel. An excellent interobserver correlation was found for the contrast of pathological wall versus lumen of methylcellulose (k = 0.81). A high rate of agreement between the criteria of both radilogists in final diagnosis could be achieved. Conclusion: Rectal filling with methylcellulose significantly improves diagnostic confidence in colorectal examinations. Ease of application and lack of use suggest to use as a clinical routine.",

As a control group, 105 consecutive patients with pathologically proven nonmucinous colorectal carcinoma in a 3-month period were included. Retrospective review of CT was performed by two radiologists in consensus who were blind to the pathologic results. CT scans were analysed with regard to the site and length of involved segment and types of morphological features, bowel wall thickening and contrast enhancement patterns, degree of contrast enhancement in solid portion of the tumor. Also evaluated were the presence of calcification, obstruction, lymphadenophathy, pericolic infiltration, local tumor extension, and distant metastasis. In heterogeneous masses, the extent of hypoattenuated areas within tumor was graded into three. Statistical analyses were performed by using Student t-test and Pearson's \u00f7 2 -test. Results: As compared with nonmucinous carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma showed more severe (p = 0.026) and more eccentric (p = 0.025) bowel wall thickening. Heterogeneous contrast enhancement was more common in mucinous carcinoma (p < 0.001). Significant difference was noted in the extent of hypoattenuated areas within tumor (p < 0.001). The solid portion of mucinous carcinoma showed hypoattenuation while nonmucinous carcinoma showed hyperattenuation (p = 0.001). Although statistical values were not obtained, the presence of intratumoral calcification was more frequent in mucinous carcinoma (21 % vs 5).

Simple tracts were found in 16 cases and complex in 6 cases in non-contrast AES. Contrast-enhanced AES revealed 19 simple and 3 complex fistulas. 15 internal openings visible in non-contrast AES were confirmed in contrast-enhanced AES in 6 cases, which additionally found 11 more internal openings. In all cases, surgery confirmed the diagnoses of the contrast-enhanced AES.

Passariello; Rome/IT Purpose: To compare the performance of CT colonography with that of conventional colonoscopy (CC) in a blinded, prospective study in 165 patients with suspected colorectal lesions. Methods: 165 patients, all referred for CC, underwent preliminary CT colonography. After standard oral colonoscopy preparation and colonic distension with room air, CT colonography was performed either with a single-slice (Somatom Plus 4; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) or multislice (Somatom Plus 4 Volume Zoom, Siemens, Germany) scanner. Imaging parameters for the single-slice scanner were: 3.0 mm slice collimation; 6.0 mm/s table speed; 0.75 s tube rotation; 2.0 mm reconstruction interval; 512 \u00d7 512 matrix; 120 mAs; 130 kVp; and scan time 35 -47 s.

Results: 33 patients had normal findings on conventional colonoscopy. A total of 30 polyps and 2 carcinoma were identified in 15 patients. MSCT-colonoscopy detected all carcinomas and 23 polyps (77 %). 3 of 3 polyps were 10 mm or more (100 %), 6 of 7 polyps were 6 to 9 mm (86 %) and 14 of 20 were smaller 6 mm (70 %). There were 13 false positive findings for polyps (10 were smaller 6 mm) and no false positive finding of cancer.

Lees; London/GB Purpose: Controversy persists over the usefulness of IV contrast in CT colography. Enhancement in small lesions should facilitate detection particularly when there is adjacent fluid. We measured the attenuation values of polyps and cancers both before and after IV contrast. Materials and methods: Forty-nine patients, 32 male, mean age 57 (42 -80) were studied. All patients had routine bowel preparation, IV smooth muscle relaxant and rectal air insufflation.

The second acquisition was performed 30 s after pump injection of 100 -150 ml of IV contrast injected at 5 ml/s. All lesions were confirmed on colonoscopy. The attenuation values of polyps and cancers were measured both before and after IV contrast. Results: Eighteen cancers were detected and 28 polyps. Mean polyp size was 12 mm (3 -25 mm). Both cancers and polyps demonstrated enhancement following IV contrast enhancement but was more marked in polyps. The mean attenuation value in the cancers prior to contrast was 53 \u00b1 16 and following contrast 105 \u00b1 26. The mean attenuation value in the polyps prior to contrast was 62 \u00b1 11 and following contrast was 113 \u00b1 26. The mean increase for cancers was 39 and for polyps 51. Conclusion: Contrast enhancement is seen in both polyps and cancers but is more marked in polyps. Enhancement could be used where there is diagnostic doubt on the pre-contrast imaging.",

Material and methods: We have examined 25 patients undergoing Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation for the treatment of hemorrhoids with modified Morinaga technique. Discussion: New surgical less-invasive techniques of treatment of hemorrhoids are being developed. One of this techniques involves the use of a modified proctoscope for artery ligation. Colour Doppler during transrectal US was used to evaluate the position of terminal arteries originating from the superior rectal artery. We were able to confirm the arrangement of these terminal arteries at 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 as seen in the lithotomy position. This was noted first by Meintjes in 2000. Conclusion: Colour Doppler transrectal US allowed a clear visualization of hemorrhoidal arteries in the fixed position described by Meintjes. Our study was the first to show the reliability of this classification. Although useful, well tolerated, quick and easy to perform, we do not recommend routine use of Colour Doppler transrectal US in all patients undergoing treatment for hemorrhoids with modified Morinaha technique.

Functioning lung grafts contributed 66 \u00b1 6 %, their corresponding native IPF lungs 34 \u00b1 6 % to total ventilated volume. Conclusion: 3 He-MRI of the lung offers a new approach to regional determination of ventilated lung volume. The volunteers show good correlation and high consistence of the absolute values between 3 He-MRI and PFT. The patients with SLTX show good correlation and the possibility to measure the individual contribution of the graft in comparison to the native lung. He-MRI (300 ml hyperpolarized 3 He gas; FLASH 2D, TR/TE 11/4.2 ms, FA < 10\u00b0, slice thickness 10 mm, pixel size 4.2 \u00d7 2.7 mm, coronal) were performed. HRCT was evaluated for 3 main lesions: airway disease (bronchial wall thickening, air trapping), emphysema, and fibrosis. 3 He MRI was assessed for three main ventilation defects. Functional compromise was scored on a 4-point scale independently for HRCT and 3 He-MRI by two readers and compared to forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and residual volume (RV). Results: 63 ventilation defects were depicted in total: 70 % in both, 18 % only on 3 He-MRI and 12 % only on HRCT. Mean HRCT score was 2.7, mean 3 He-MRI score 2.5, mean FEV1 was 60 %. There was no relevant correlation between HRCT and FEV1 (r = 0.3), but between 3 He-MRI and FEV1 (r = 0.7), exhibiting significant differences between scores 2 and 3 (p < 0.05) as well as 3 and 4 (p < 0.05). There was no relevant correlation between HRCT and RV (r = 0.1), but for 3 He-MRI (r = 0.6). Conclusion: In comparison to paired in-and expiratory HRCT, 3 He-MRI has a higher sensitivity in the detection of ventilation defects and correlates better with LFT. Thus, functional information is predicted better using 3 He-MRI. No single lung function test index correlates well with the severity of emphysema. The aim was to develop a composite pulmonary function score that best reflects the CT quantification of emphysema. Material and methods: The HRCT scans of 97 cases of emphysema were scored objectively using a density mask. The following standard pulmonary function tests (PFT): DLco, Kco, FEV1, total lung capacity (TLC), residual volume (RV) were recorded. Stepwise regression was used to identify the combination of PFTs that best fitted the HRCT score Results: Significant negative correlations were found between the HRCT emphysema scores and DLco, Kco and FEV1 (R 2 = 0.39, R 2 = 0.36 and R 2 = 0.42 respectively) and positive correlations with TLC and RV (R 2 = 0.29 and R 2 = 0.37 respectively). A composite score representing the best fit combination of PFTs against the CT emphysema score was: 24. Purpose: This study evaluated the relationships between high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) morphologic quantification of bronchiectasis and clinical and lung function parameters. Materials and methods: 60 Chinese with steady state bronchiectasis underwent thoracic HRCT scan and full lung function tests. Exacerbation frequency/year and 24 h sputum volume were determined. Extent of bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thickening, and presence of small airway abnormalities and mosaic attenuation were evaluated in each lobe, including lingula. Relationships between lung function, sputum volume, clinical exacerbation and HRCT parameters were analysed. Results: Exacerbation frequency was associated with bronchial wall thickening (r = 0.32, p = 0.03); 24 h sputum volume with bronchial wall thickening, small airway abnormalities (r = 0.30, 0.39, p < 0.05), and FEV11, FEV1/FVC and FEF25 -75(r = -0.33, -0.29, -0.32; p < 0.05). Extent of bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thickening and mosaic attenuation were respectively related to FEV11 (r = -0.43 to -0.60 p < 0.001), FEF25 -75(r = -0.38 to -0.57; p < 0.001), FVC (r = -0.36 to -0.46, p < 0.01), and FEV11/FVC (r = -0.31 to -0.49, p < 0.01). After multiple regression bronchial wall thickening remained a significant determinant of airflow obstruction, while small airway abnormalities remained associated with 24 h sputum volume. Women in general had milder disease than men, but showed more HRCT-functional correlations. Conclusion: This study has established a link between morphologic HCRT parameters and clinical activity, and emphasised the role of BWT in bronchiectasis.

Visual quantitation of emphysema and air trapping was evaluated by consensus. Results: At follow-up there was a significant increase of the E/I quotient for mean attenuation for smokers with and without emphysema, but also for non-smokers.

R\u00e9my-Jardin 1 ; 1 Toulouse/FR, 2 Lille/FR Purpose: To evaluate the frequency of mediastinal lymphadenopathy due to left heart failure on computed tomography (CT) scans in correlation with clinical and echocardiographic findings. Materials and methods: 31 consecutive patients (mean age, 69 years) with left heart failure in a subacute phase were included in a prospective study between september 2000 and august 2001. CT examinations (HRCT and spiral CT scans) and transthoracic echocardiography were performed within 24 hours after presentation. CT follow-up were obtained within 8 days after initiation of medical treatment. Results: At presentation, dyspnea was graded as type IV (39 %), III (39 %), II (19 %) and I (3 %). Mean ejection fraction was 39 %. Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes were seen in 42 % of cases, heterogeneous in 23 %, with a hazy perilymphadenopathy fat in 38.5 % of cases. All patients had pleuroparenchymal abnormalities due to left heart failure. Peribronchovascular thickening, septal thickening, fissures thickening, ground-glass attenuation, condensations, micronodules and pleural effusions were present respectively in 20 %, 71 %, 71 %, 74 %, 16 %, 16 % and 74 % of cases. After treatment, dyspnea was graded as type III (16 %), II (61 %) and I (23 %). Lymphadenopathy decreased in size in 38.5 %, was stable in 38.5 %, disappeared in 23 %, and weas heterogeneous in 20 %, fat abnormalities disappeared in all cases. Pleuroparenchymal abnormalities decreased in 74 %, disappeared in 19.5 % and were stable in 6.5 %. ",

            "text": "We examined 23 consecutive patients (138 lung lobes) referred for the assessment of possible airways disease using multislice CT. The thorax was scanned contiguously at 1 mm slice thickness and this was reconstructed at 1 mm slice thickness (lung windows utilising high spatial frequency algorithm) in the axial (10 mm apart), sagittal (4 per lung) and coronal (6) plane. Pedal wheel reconstructions were also performed. Axial images were assessed by 2 chest radiologists with and without the help of MPR at two separate occasions. The presence of bronchiectasis, emphysema and bronchiolitis in each lobe was documented on a confidence scale of 0 -3 (0 no disease, 3 definite disease). Result: There was no significant difference (p = 0.280) in the mean confidence in the diagnosis of airways disease with the help of MPR [Observer A (1.98 axial, 2.01 MPR); Observer B (2.88 axial, 2.71 MPR)]. In addition, weighted kappa showed no improvement in inter-observer agreement (kappa = 0.566 for axial; kappa = 0.530 for MPR). Isolated cases wherein MPR was beneficial were noted, particularly in patients with bronchiectasis (3 patients). Due to the small number, this did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: Our results did not demonstrate a significant increase in confidence in the diagnosis of airways disease. MPR was beneficial in a few selected cases of bronchiectasis. Methods and materials: 40 consecutive patients were randomized into 2 groups of 20 patients each. Group 1 underwent SSCT with a standard protocol for the study of the airways and group 2 underwent MSCT with the following protocol: 4 \u00d7 1 mm slice collimation, pitch 7 (1.75 M), 1 mm slice width, 0.8 mm reconstruction increment. Two radiologists evaluated by consensus the axial images and VB reconstructions in order to assess the degree of visualization of the bronchial tree according to a three point scale (grade 0, 1 and 2). Results: On axial images, MSCT yielded better results in the evaluation of the segmental bronchi of the middle lobe (32 bronchi rated as grade 2 by MSCT vs 16 by SSCT; p < 0.05), of the anterior segmental bronchus of the left upper lobe (19 rated as grade 2 by MSCT vs 10 by SSCT; p < 0.05) and of inferior segmental bronchus of the lingula (18 rated as grade 2 by MSCT vs 8 by SSCT; p < 0.05). Evaluation of lobar and segmental bronchi was always possible when VB was obtained from MSCT data sets whereas 53/280 bronchi were scored 0 when VB was obtained from SSCT. Subsegmental bronchi could be better evaluated with MSCT than SSCT either on axial images or VB (p < 0.05). Conclusion: MSCT with 1 mm collimation significantly improves the visualization of segmental and subsegmental bronchi and is particularly useful for oblique oriented bronchi. Methods: Over a one year period 96 patients had by pCT. 10 patients were directly examined by pCT on admission day on ICU. For this purpose a special interventional suite was prepared directly on ICU. In this suite radiological modalities like radiography, sonography and portable angiography can be performed under intensive care monitoring and therapy. CT examinations are even possible by using pCT in this special suite. On day of admission patients underwent extensive evaluation using modalities of this special interventional suite. Results: In two cases a bedside CT procedure was performed the others were performed in the intervention suite on ICU. In 80 % of the cases a final diagnosis could be determined by CT examination. In 40 % CT findings led to follow up evaluations by pCT. Even 40 % of CT examinations led to direct therapeutic consequences such as surgical intervention. 60 % of the CT indications were assessed as necessary or essential by an experienced ICU physician. Half of the follow up examinations had also direct therapeutic consequences. ",

The S/N is strongly influenced by the specific coil arrangement and the actual number of profiles in k-space. For the applied double loop coil and a SENSE factor of two the S/N equals that of the standard scan (head coil) in superficial temporal regions and is reduced by a factor of 0.65 to 0.8 in central and occipital regions. However, the increased temporal resolution compensated for the decrease in S/N and the calculated parameter maps were always of good diagnostic quality.

Fasoli; Rome/IT Purpose: The use of MR diffusion weighted imaging in detecting hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in neonates is still controversial. Moreover few reports concern pre-term infants with possible periventricular leukomalacia (PVL). We examined the ability of this technique to detect cerebral changes of acute PVL. Methods: Fifteen MR examinations were performed in eleven preterm infants. Imaging comprised conventional and diffusion-weighted (DW) sequences. Conventional, DW sequences and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps as well as US obtained in the acute phase were compared. All the neonates underwent US follow-up 6 and 12 months after delivery, those with suspect PVL also underwent MRI follow-up at two months and one year.

Follow-up MRI and US confirmed the absence of PVL 3 months later. In eight neonates MRI was considered normal. In these subjects US follow-up confirmed no signs of PVL. Apart from the well known image artefacts time consuming reconstruction periods often inhibit continuing data acquisition, particularly if sequences are used with more than one acquisition or with built-in postprocessing capabilities to automatically generate ADC-maps. By using these sequences as the last sequence in the whole examination prior to the start of the subsequent examination of the next patient this time delay can be reduced. The aim of this prospective study was to find out if there is any diagnostically significant difference between acquisition of EPI-DWI images before and after intravenous application of Gd-DTPA.",

The MR indications were ischemic stroke, encephalitis, multiple sclerosis and brain tumor with and without disturbed blood brain barrier. The MRI images were rated by two blinded, neuroradiologically experienced radiologists. Results: Intravenous CM had no influence on the diagnostic information of the images. There were no significant signal differences even in lesions with pronounced disturbances of the blood brain barrier. Conclusion: It is possible to use EPI-DWI after CM application without loss of clinical information. The proposed approach allows to reduce examination times. Brain perfusion studies with trans cranial colour Doppler using ultrasound contrast media G. Salvaggio, G. Caruso, T.V. Bartolotta, A. Scisca, G. Caputo, R. Lagalla, A.E. Cardinale; Palermo/IT Purpose: To evaluate the intracranial micro circulation using trans-cranial color Doppler (TCCD) with a contrast medium (Levovist). Material and methods: 25 patients, (age range: 41 -73 years; mean age 64 years) affected by mellitus diabetes were selected. 20 healty volunteers (mean age: 63 years) acted as control. The examinations were performed using an ATL HDI 5000 ultrasound unit provided with a Phased Array 3.25 MHz probe. Mechanical index was calibrated to high value in order to obtain microbubbles rupture under ultrasound beam exposition. After positioning of an operator defined region of interest, intensity/time curves related to the parenchymal micro circulation were plotted, and the areas under the curves were calculated. Results: In all controls, the areas under the curve showed a mean value greater than 0.05 that we considered as cut-off value of normal perfusion. On the other hand, the diabetic patients showed a lower mean value, to indicate a micro circulation disease. Conclusion: Thanks to software improvements and ever more effective algorithms, contrast-enhanced TCCD is able to provide information on brain perfusion non invasively and at low cost. Purpose: To present our initial clinical experience with a one-piece design 8-channel neuro-array coil for MRI of the brain. Methods and materials: MRI examinations of the brain were performed in 5 normal volunteers using an 8-channel parallel acquisition technique (PAT) optimized neuro-array head coil (MRI Devices Corporation, Wisconsin, USA), and a standard circularly-polarized (CP) volume head coil. Examinations were performed on a 1.5 T superconducting magnet (Sonata, Siemens AG, Germany). Signal-to-noise ratios were calculated and compared for the two coils in various anatomical locations including peripheral (cortex, subcortical white matter, etc.) and central (e.g. corpus callosum, sella, brainstem, etc.) parts of the brain. Results: The 8-channel neuro-array coil provided excellent high-resolution imaging with anatomical coverage of the entire head. In the peripheral portions of the brain, SNR was 50 -100 % superior to that obtained with a standard CP volume head coil. In the deeper parts of the brain SNR was at least equally good. The neuro-array coil is PAT optimized and allows the use of SENSE/SMASH type sequences with flexible phase encoding. Conclusion: The 8-channel neuro-array head coil provided excellent high-resolution MRI of the entire brain. SNR was markedly improved, especially in the peripheral parts of the brain. The PAT optimized imaging capablities can be used to decrease imaging time, improve spatial resolution, or a combination of both.",

Goracy; Szczecin/PL Purpose: There is evidence that an allelic variation in the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene may confer an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The aim of our study was to evaluate the relationship between the ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism and the prevalence of brain ischemic stroke as well as between the polymorphism and CT type of ischemic stroke. Materials and methods: The ACE I/D genotype was identified by polymerase chain reaction in 46 patients (26 males and 20 females) with brain ischemic stroke, and in 100 controls (50 males and 50 females). To assess the polymorphism frequencies, statistical analysis was performed. Results: The D/D polymorphism frequency was significantly higher in the stroke group than in the controls (32.6 % vs. 13 %; p < 0.01). The I/I and I/D polymorphism frequencies were similar in both groups (26.1 % vs. 30 %, and 41.3 % vs. 57 %, respectively; p > 0.05). Conclusion: A positive association between the ACE D/D allele and ischemic stroke was found in our study.

In 42 patients, a follow-up MRI after 1 month allowed correlation between the evolution of the clinical symptoms and the changes in the appearance of the bone injury. In 75 patients, it was very useful to correlate the changes in the bone appearance with the clinical outcome. Conclusions: In our experience MRI has been very important in the evaluation of traumatic, post traumatic or non traumatic bone pathology and for a correct therapeutic assessment of the patient. Purpose: To compare bone bruise patterns identified at MRI incurred by impaction, distraction and shear injuries correlated with microtome sections and histopathology. Methods: Freshly harvested sheep cadaveric limbs were imaged on a 1.5 T Philips MRI Intera Scanner following exposure to impaction, distraction and shear forces. Each limb was imaged using SE T1 and STIR sequences. Following imaging, the cadaveric limb was sectioned using a microtome and pattern of trabecular damage correlated with identified bone bruise at MRI. Results: Impaction forces produce poorly marginated globular bone bruises with extensive concertina type trabecular damage. Distraction forces produce localised bone bruises in a linear pattern perpendicular to the axis of distraction with localised trabecular disruption, attenuation and stretching. Shear injuries produce linear bone bruises obliquely oriented with localised linear disruption of trabeculae on microtome sections. Conclusion: Bone bruise patterns are dictated by mechanism. MRI appearances reflect the underlying extent of trabecular damage at histopathology.

Conclusion: \"Stereo Viewing\" is an effective and accurate tool for assessing complex 3D-MRA datasets as it provides more diagnostic confidence compared to the combination of common post-processing techniques (MIP + MPR). The added time needed for \"Stereo Viewing\" results in enhanced diagnostic confidence. Purpose: Image quality of DSA of the hands is still superior to CE-MRA due to the lower spatial resolution of CE-MRA which is limited by the passage time of the contrast bolus through the arteries.

Results: Compared to the classic first-pass MRA with pixel dimensions of 1.17 \u00d7 0.59 mm, the use of TAC-CEMRA allowed a significant increase in spatial resolution with voxels down to 0.59 \u00d7 0.29 mm.

HR-MRI (Magnetom Vision, Siemens) was performed within 16 hours after the intervention using axial T1-w, fat-saturated contrast enhanced T1-w, T2-w and 3D-TOF sequences. Maximum matrix size was 320 \u00d7 512, minimum voxel size 0.49 \u00d7 0.49 \u00d7 2.0 mm. Contrast enhanced MR angiography was employed for assignment of exact matching sites. IVUS (3.5 F, 40 MHz) images were recorded with a standardized motorized pullback system (pullback speed 1.0 mm/s). Quantitative analysis for each segment included minimum and maximum luminal diameter and cross sectional lumen area. Morphologic analysis included the absence or presence and extent of dissection. Results: Precise pre-and post-PTA assignment of 16 segments was successfully carried out according to our protocol. The lumen increase measured 100 % to 400 % with a remarkable agreement between IVUS and HR-MRI. Post PTA correlation for cross sectional lumen area (r = 0.90) was better compared to pre PTA analysis (r = 0.80).

Three groups of study animals (liver cirrhosis, hepatitis, fatty liver) and a control group were investigated (15 rats/group). SE and GRE imaging was performed (n = 6/group, 7.5 \u00b5mol/kg bw); 3 rats received no CM and 3 animals each 15 and 25 \u00b5mol/kg. T2-relaxation time of all livers were measured ex vivo by relaxometry, and CM concentrations were determined. Q-values representing the phagocytosed CM were computed from the pre-and postcontrast SI on both the SE and GRE images. Spearman's correlation coefficient between CM concentrations and T2-relaxation rates was significant in the control group at 0.506 (p < 0.05). In the 3 study groups, Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) between CM and T2-relaxation rates was significant, ranging from 0.627 -0.717 (p < 0.05) -a positive correlation between CM and T2-relaxation rates in all groups. PCC between Q-values and CM concentrations was significant at 0.767 (SE) and 0.587 (GRE) (p < 0.05) -positive correlation between the CM and Q-values. The Mann-Whitney test yielded a significant difference in the QSE values between the liver cirrhosis and fatty liver groups compared with controls (p < 0.05).",

Results: In the detection of focal liver lesions, unenhanced plus dynamic plus late phase enhanced MRI was more accurate than unenhanced plus dynamic and than unenhanced plus late phase enhanced examinations, which were more accurate than unenhanced imaging. The accuracy and observer confidence in the characterization of focal liver lesions were higher when dynamic examination was considered. Methods and materials: 45 patients were prospectively investigated using a 1.5 T Magnetom (Siemens Symphony; Philips ACS NT). The sequence protocol included T2w TSE and T1w SE/GRE scans using unenhanced and SPIO-enhanced studies (Endorem: 15 \u00b5mol/kg bw). Diagnostic criteria unenhanced were: homogeneous isointensity/mild hyperintensity (T2w); homogeneous iso-/mild hypointensity (T1w); scar detection. The uptake of the SPIO-particels was calculated comparing contrast-enhanced with unenhanced scans. Results: The standard of reference was histopathology providing surgery (liver resection) or needle biopsy. As a second option Gadolinium-enhanced MRI was accepted within a timeframe of 6 month. In the resection group sensitivity was 95.2 % with a specificity of 95.8 %. Signal intensity was homogeneous in T1-and T2w unenhanced sequences and similar to surrounding parenchyma in 37 out of 44 cases (group 1). In eight cases the lesion was heterogeneous hyperintense in T2w and hypointense in T1w scans unenhanced (group 2). Group 1 documented a significant signal intensity loss using SPIO-enhanced T2w sequences compared with unenhanced prtocols. For group 2 a statistical significant decreased uptake of SPIO-particles was documented. Histopathology revealed high degree of fibrotic changes (group2). Using SPIO-enhanced MRI detection and delineation of central scar tissue was increased compared to unenhanced MRI. Conclusion: SPIO-enhanced MRI is an effective imaging tool for the diagnosis of FNH nodules providing morphological and functional details sufficient for characterization. Purpose: Capillary and cavernous hemangiomas represent the most frequent benign lesions of the liver; atypical features due to complications may simulate different lesions; the rare occurrence of other vascular histotypes makes the differential diagnosis even harder. The aim of our study was to describe their imaging features and discuss their differential diagnosis.",

CT protocol included: 5 mm collimation, pitch 1.5 injection of iodinated contrast medium in the arterial, porto-venous and delayed phases. MR protocol included 5 -8 mm slice thickness, T1, T2 weighted sequences and post-Gd evaluation. We evaluated the morpho-structural appearance and the contrast enhancement of the lesions. The comparison between different imaging modalities, the dynamic of contrast enhancement, the follow-up, the bioptic and surgical specimens allowed for the correct diagnosis in all the cases. Results: We identified the typical patterns of capillary hemangioma (50), cavernous hemangioma (65), giant hemangioma (10). In 5 case we demonstrated intratumoral hemorrhage, in 7 cases prevalent jaline and/or stromal components, in 6 cases calcifications.

Conclusion: BMD was very similar in our patients with Marfan syndrome compared to the reference population. Statistically significant differences were only observed for the porosity index. Data in the literature concerning osteoporosis in Marfan patients is ambiguous. Our findings may indicate a specific textural disturbance in the bones of Marfan patients which does not result in overall altered bone density. There are potential limitations due to specific anatomic properties of the metacarpal bones in Marfan syndrome. Radiogrammetric based bone densitometry seems to be of promising clinical value in pediatric patients receiving X-rays of the wrist and hand routinely for determination of skeletal maturity. This new technology might be able to give additional information and reduce radiation exposure. Gender-specific standard-deviation-scores (SDS) were calculated using age, height and weight matched regional normative data (3299 healthy children). Follow-up was performed in 9 children during bisphosphonate-treatment over a period of 2 years. Results: 20 patients had OI type I, 6 had OI type IV. Age-matched BUA values were < \u22122 SD in 9/20 patients, < \u22121 SD in 6/20 patients and normal in the remaining children with type 1. 13/20 patients had SOS values below \u22122 SD, 4/20 below \u22121 SD and 3 were within the normal range. No BUA and SOS-values below \u22122 SD were observed in type 4; and 2/6 patients had values below \u22121 SD. 1/6 patients had SOS values < \u22121 SD, the others were within the normal range. Mean bone values differences were significant: \u22121.82 SD/\u22120.10 SD (BUA) and \u22122.34 SD/0.02 SD (SOS). There was a strong correlation of BUA and SOS (r = 0.90, p < 0.01). 4/9 children showed a significant increase of BUA and SOS (more than 1 SD), 1/9 a slight increase in values during follow-up treatment, 4 had no change. In all treated cases fracture rates were significantly reduced. Conclusion: Ultrasound based bone densitometry may be of clinical value in children suffering from OI.

Haigh; Birmingham/GB Traumatic wrist injury in children is common but detection of fractures and other injuries can be difficult. We have evaluated the role of MR imaging in the assessment of paediatric wrist trauma. 99 children with a history of wrist trauma in whom the there was either a discrepancy in the clinical assessment and the plain radiographic findings or normal radiographs and persisting symptoms underwent an MRI examination of the wrist. All MRI examinations were performed within 2 weeks of the initial trauma, 76 % within 6 days. 101 MRI examinations were performed (2 children has repeat examinations). 34 (34 %) patients with normal plain radiographs had fractures detected on MR imaging (59 % in the carpus and 41 % in the radius and ulna). In 20 patients there was a discrepancy between the plain radiographic findings and the clinical assessment and in 12 cases (60 %) MRI detected further occult fractures and soft tissue injuries. No patient with a negative MRI examination has represented with a complication of the initial injury, indicating that MRI has a 100 % negative predictive value for wrist injuries. MR examination of the wrist in children significantly alters management. MR imaging detects radiographically and clinically occult fractures and soft tissue injuries. The technique is well tolerated by children. Methods and materials: 21 patients (age 3 -16 years; m = 11, f = 10) suffering from juvenile aseptic osteonecrosis (Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease), underwent MRI in a 0.5 T MR-scanner (Gyroscan T5 NT, Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) using a fat-suppressed STIR sequence, T2-weighted turbo spin-echo and T1-weighted spin-echo sequences. Postcontrast T1-weighted sequences were performed in each patient after administration of 0.1 mmol gadolinium/kg bodyweight (Magnevist, Schering, Berlin, Germany). All examinations were retrospectively assessed by two paediatric radiologists, evaluating the signal patterns of the femoral head and the metaphysis in each sequence in consensus. The MR features and the diagnostic accuracy were analyzed for the different sequences and compared to conventional X-ray.",

X-rays of the feet were available in 27 cases. The age range was between 1 month and 36 years. Radiographs were evaluated by 2 radiologists in respect of morphological anomalies. Results: We found a bone age delay in 10/27 patients, whose epiphyses were not fused. A brachyphalangy was noted in 22/31 patients, clinodactyly in 18/31. Partial syndactyly occured in 16 cases, involving the soft tissues of the 2 nd web space and additionally the 3 rd in 3 cases. 7/31 patients presented with partial carpal fusion, affecting the trapezoid and the trapezium in 5. Coned epiphyses were present in 16/16 patients. Other anomalies included a duplicated distal phalanx of the hallux (n = 9), a triangular deformity of the epiphyses of the distal phalanx of the hallux (n = 10), partial syndactyly (n = 11) and brachyphalangy (n = 10). Conclusion: Saethre-Chotzen syndrome and Muenke-type mutation have a variety of morphological anomalies of the hand and foot in which skeletal anomalies such as brachyphalangy and syndactyly are non-specific signs. Different patterns of anomalies between both are a duplicated distal end and triangular shaped epiphysis of the hallux, which were only detected in patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Purpose: Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS) and Muenke-type mutation FGFR3 Pro250Arg (MTM) are both complex syndromes with skeletal anomalies such as craniosynostosis, syndactylism and cervical spine abnormalities. In this study we analysed the variable cervical spine abnormalities identified on radiographs for specific features in patients with genetically proven SCS and MTM. Methods and materials: Cervical spine radiographs of 20 patients (11 female, 9 male; mean age 6 a) were reviewed by to 2 radiologists with experience of skeletal dysplasias. The patient population included 17 patients with SCS and 3 patients with MTM. The appearance of the vertebral bodies, the posterior elements including the neural arch and the atlanto-axial joint were assessed. X-rays of the hands and feet were available in 10 patients. Results: Fusion of vertebral bodies and posterior elements were noted in 3 patients (level C2/3, C3/4 and C5/6). An isolated fusion of posterior elements occurred in 8 patients (level C 1/2 (n = 1), C2/3 (n = 7), C 4/5 (n = 1), C5/6 (n = 2)). 5/10 patients with cervical spine fusion additionally showed carpal and/or tarsal fusion. In 7/20 patients an enlarged vertebral space between C 1/2 was found. A hypoplastic neural arch was detected in 5 patients and a long spinous process at C7 in a single case. The atlanto-axial joint space had a mean distance of 3.4 mm (range 2 -9 mm). Conclusion: SCS and MTM display a great variety of cervical anomalies, however the radiological signs are morphologically non-specific. However, cervical vertebral fusion in these patients is often associated with carpal and/or tarsal fusions.",

In 4 cases, 3 involving the pelvic region the ultrasound diagnosis was initially incorrect. In one child where the diagnosis of a tumour was made both on ultrasound and MRI, the diagnosis of a proliferative myositis was subsequently made by histology after ultrasound guided biopsy. The extent of myositis was determined better with MRI than ultrasound. In the extremities an abscess was detected by ultrasound, the accompaniing osteomyelitis could only be detected with MRI.

Images were acquired in the midsagittal plane. Swallowing of diluted Magnevist-enteral solution, phonation of test words and defined testmovements of the tongue were evaluated. Results were analysed by 2 radiologists in comparison to videofluoroscopy as the standard of reference concerning overall quality of the depiction of tongue-movement and deglutition (MRI better, equally good or worse), and depiction of the stages of swallowing (from 0 = not recognisable to 3 = very good depiction). Results: In all cases, the important stages of swallowing could be successfully depicted with real-time MRI. However, quality of videofluoroscopy was considered to be better in all subjects. Discrete pathologies like laryngeal penetration could only be seen on videofluoroscopy. Depiction of tongue-movement was better with real-time MRI in 13/18 cases and equally good in 5/18 cases. This was due to the better soft tissue contrast of MRI and the lacking of artefacts from teeth and metall implants. Conclusion: Real-time MRI can successfully depict the normal physiology of swallowing. For the analysis of dysphagia, quality is inferior to videofluoroscopy, while for the analysis of tongue movement-disorders, real-time MRI is superior to videofluoroscopy. ",

Carniato; Treviso/IT A four years experience in dysphagic patients suggested that assessment of deglutition tested with videofluoroscopic fluids, doesn't closely enough reproduce deglutition with mealtime fluids. With this technique in fact only poor and approximate indications can be given to swallowing therapist concerning food to be used for rehabilitation. The aim is to give clinicians more precise and objective information about deglutition assessment. Density and viscosity of videofluoroscopic fluids were measured and compared by means of a precision balance and a viscosimeter. Videofluoroscopic fluids were more dense and viscous than mealtime food. Different abilities to manage boluses in relation to their density and viscosity during each stage of swallowing were examined as well. The analysis of a recurrent aspiration pneumonia is difficult in newborns or children. Besides the special requests of radioprotection the diminuished capacity of collaboration of small children is a considerable problem. Therefore we use a dynamic recording unit with cine-fluoroscopy and with a videorecording system. The test-bolus consists of Jotrolan (Isovist R), which is a iso-osmolar, non ionic hydrosoluble preparation with a reduced pneumotoxicity. The taste is sugarlike. The analysis of the study should be done with the pediatrician or the paediatric ENT-specialist in order to integrate the clinical findings with the radiologic pattern. The differentiation between an oral and a pharyngeal morphologic or functional swallowing disorder is of special therapeutic interest. In the analysis of the swallowing disorder the individual situation of the study has to be considered, since a rejection might be misinterpreted as a swallowing disorder of the first, the volontary phase. Functional disorders as a complete or an incomplete paralysis of the velum or the pharynx, dysfunctions of the upper esophageal sphincter and alterations of the sensomotoric system can be differentiated with a high precision. The sensitive diagnostic tool allows to find an individual treatment plan in accordance to the therapy of Castillo-Morales, Voita, P\u00f6rnbacher or Bobart for the single infant.

Methods and materials: Hand images were obtained on 50 patients presenting for a rheumatologic baseline or follow-up exam. The patients were imaged such that one hand, selected randomly, was imaged with a digital flat panel table system (General Electric, XR/d, Milwaukee, WI) and the other with an extremity 100-speed screen-film (SF) system (Agfa, Curix HT 1.000G Plus). The DR images were printed using a laser printer. All images were obtained using the same X-ray tube and generator, without a grid, 100 cm source-to-detector distance, 50 kV, and 2.5 -3.2 mAs (dependent on the patient acquired with matched techniques). Five radiologists scored pairs of images DR vs. SF using a 5-point scale (\u22122 clearly worse to +2 clearly better). Observers were asked to score the image quality of eight anatomical criteria. Results: All anatomical structures were scored equal or higher with the flat panel system compared to screen-film. Comparing the digital flat panel to screen-film, DR was graded statistically superior: by 3 of 5 readers for cortical structures, by 3 readers for trabecular structures and by 4 readers for border structures, soft tissues and overall image quality. None of the observers rated the SF statistically superior to DR for any category.",

Lymphography was performed as the last diagnostic procedure. After this final staging took place. We compared and statistically analyzed US, CT, and lymphographic findings as well as the change of clinical stage after lymphography. Results: Lymphography did not show high aortic lymph nodes. US and CT did not show the changes in small or normal size nodes especially in pelvic region. Statistically significant differences in alteration of the clinical stage, before and after lymphography, has been demonstrated in all stages.

Panica; Rome/IT Diagnostic imaging in military medicine can be divided into two branches: clinical (in homeland and in field hospitals) and forensic. The clinical branch is performed in all clinical hospitals, while the forensic branch is performed both in clinical hospitals and in dedicated medical forensic military centers. In the clinical branch, field hospital radiological activity (FHRA)is very specific and interesting; it is performed in the homeland (great disasters or accidents) and abroad (military operations, as peace-keeping/enforcing). FHRA is influenced by three important factors: mass (high spatial-temporal concentration of injured personnel), environment (e.g.: tropical countries: infectious or climatic changes or unusual diseases, and injurious agents, ballistical or thermal. A special modular Rx unit (8 parashutable packages) that can be easily and rapidly assembled and disassembled, and a US unit with 3.5 and 7.5 MHz probe are available in our field hospitals. The modular Rx unit is composed of a \"C\" arm, TV unit with fluoroscopy, radiographic facilities and the ability to print on US type film. In the near future dedicated CT units, digital radiology devices and dry film processing units shall also be available. Methods and material: Over a two year period, 95 patients ranging from 5 to 80 years with or without an intraspinal component of the lesion were subjected to FNAC. All were performed with 20/22 to gauge needle. Two or three passes were made. US guided biopsy was performed with 5 -7 MHz linear probe with a free hand technique. CT was performed using a lead wire grid for accurate location. Results: Of these 45 (67.16 %) were benign and 22 (32.87 %) were malignant. 6 patients underwent CT guided FNAC as US guided was negative. The success rate of US guided FNAC was 33/45 (73.3 %) and that of CT guided 34/46 (73.9 %). A conclusive diagnosis could not be reached in 18 patients due to insufficient material caused by necrosis, clot or blood. Conclusion: Image guided FNAC is an effective and safe procedure for evaluation of spinal and para spinal lesions for effective patient management. To evaluate the value of MRI as an adjunct to clinical and sonographic findings for the prenatal diagnosis of fetal malformation as well as for the assessment of maternal disorders during pregnancy. Methods: 77 women with complicated pregnancies (fetal pathologies n = 71, maternal pathologies n = 6, mean age of gestation 26.82 \u00b1 6.88 weeks) were referred for MRI. Imaging was performed in a 1.5 T System (GEMS) using T2w SSFSE sequences. Images were analysed with regard to fetal and maternal abnormalities. Findings were correlated with sonography, postnatal clinical and imaging findings and/or autopsy. Results: Most of the fetuses (n = 37) had isolated pathologies of the CNS. In 7 cases complex malformation syndromes were present. The remaining pathologies included pulmonary (n = 6), gastrointestinal (n = 2) and other (n = 20) pathologies. MRI was equal or even superior to sonography for diagnosing cerebral malformation. Due to the small size, the lack of real time examination and the missing flow information, the diagnostic confidence of MRI was lower for pathologies of the heart, abdominal organs and extremities. Maternal disorders included anomalies of the uterus (n = 2), myoma (n = 2), 1 cervical carcinoma and 1 borderline ovarian tumour. Purpose: Aim of this work was to compare the new 3D MR-histerosalpingography with the X-ray conventional one in the evaluation of female infertility. Method and materials: 15 infertile female patients (aging 29 -43 years, mean 35) were studied with a 1.5 T magnet unit (GE Horizon 8.5) using a T2 weighted FSE sequences on axial and coronal plane and a 3D Fast SPGR sequence (3D MRA sequence) on coronal plane after injection of a diluted gadolinium solution into the uterine cavity via a balloon catheter.

The 3D MR technique provided the evidence of the uterine cavity and the patency of the Fallopian tube with a complete concordance with X ray histerosalpingography. However the accuracy in detecting the Fallopian tube calibre was considered inferior with MRI than X-ray by two expert radiologists. Two Fallopian tube stenosis were missed at 3D MR-histerosalpingography. Conclusion: 3D MR histerosalpingography may represent a real promising technique in the non-invasive evaluation of the infertile female. The main advantage is related to the lack of ionising radiation in these young females. Up to date, in our experience, the MR technique does not have the same accuracy as X-ray in detecting the Fallopian tube. Improvement in spatial resolution probably have to be considered. The purpose of this study was to establish MR pelvimetric reference values in a large study taking into account the mode of delivery. Intra-and interobserver errors and intra-individual variability of MR measurements were assessed in a complementary volunteer study. Methods and materials: MR pelvimetric measurements of 781 women (28.9 \u00b1 5.2 a) were reviewed and correlated to obstetric history in order to establish normative values. 2 subgroups were identified: (1) spontaneous deliveries, and (2) cases undergoing caesarean section or vacuum extraction due to fetalpelvic disproportion. In addition, MR pelvimetry was performed 5 times in 10 female volunteers (34.7 \u00b1 6.0 a) on a 1.5 T system using T1w FSPGR sequences. All measurements were then performed twice by 5 different observers to assess intra-and interobserver errors and intra-individual variability. Results: Mean obstetric conjugate measured 116.6 \u00b1 10.8 mm, interspinous distance 106.6 \u00b1 9.5 mm, intertuberous distance 114.8 \u00b1 12.3 mm, transverse diameter 125 \u00b1 9.8 mm and sagittal outlet 112.8 \u00b1 11.0 mm. There were significantly different measurements in the 2 subgroups (p < 0.001), with wider measurements in the spontaneous delivery group. In the volunteer study intra-, interobserver and intra-individual reliabilities were accurate for obstetric conjugate (0.94 -0.96), interspinous distance (0.92 -0.95) and transverse diameter (0.95 -0.98), however they were poorer for intertuberous distance (0.64 -0.87) and sagittal outlet (0.66 -0.85).",

Slooff; Groningen/NL Purpose: To compare the sensitivity of CTAP (Computer Tomography during Arterial Portography) with MnDPDP enhanced MRI in assessing the exact number of liver metastases before liver surgery. Material and methods: In 30 patients evaluated for surgical treatment of metastases of colorectal carcinoma, we performed CTAP and MRI with MnDPDP contrast medium (Teslascan). Peroperative ultrasonography performed jointly by surgeon and radiologist served as the gold standard. CTAP and MRI were evaluated by two experienced radiologists blinded to the results of the operative findings and the result of the other technique. Results: In 18 patients at operation 37 metastases were found, and 1 focal nodular hyperplasia. CTAP correctly showed 31 (81.6 %) and MnDPDP enhanced MRI 24 (65 %)of these lesions. Of the missed meastases in MRI 7 were smaller than 7 mm and 10 smaller than 1 cm. Two were missed because of technical failure, two of three by interpretative failure were found in retrospect. CTAP showed 13 lesions thought to be metastases not proven by surgery, whereas MRI only scored 3 false positive findings. In the non operated group 6 patients underwent PETscanning showing a total of 15 metastases in the liver. 13 of these were shown by CTAP and 14 by MRI. When this group of patients is added to the operated group, sensitivity for CTAP rises to 83 % and for MRI to 70 %.

We reviewed retrospectively the preoperative investigations (computed tomography, cholangio-MRI, US-endoscopy, pancreatography) and correlated them to the histological results. Results: CT and MRI showed isolated abnormalities of the pancreatic ducts in 7 patients involving the main pancreatic duct (MPD) (n = 3) and the branch duct dilatation (n = 5). The MPD was normal (n = 4), dilated (n = 3) or stenosed (n = 1). The cystic lesions involved the head and/or uncinate process (n = 4), the body and/or tail (n = 3). The location was diffuse (n = 3) or multifocal (n = 1). The number of cystic lesions varied from 3 to 20 or more and the size was less than 10 mm. A solid tumor was demonstrated in one patient. Correlation with US-endoscopy was good. None of the 8 patients were found to have mucous extrusion through the papilla. Pancreatography was normal in 1 case, showed a communication between the cystic lesions and MPD in 2 cases or a stenosis in one case. Ductal biopsies performed in 5 cases (EUS-guided n = 3; transpapillary n = 2) revealed epithelial proliferation in 2 patients and were non-informative in 3. The pancreatic resection consisted with a pancreatico-duodenectomy in 6 patients and total pancreatectomy in 2. To compare MR cholangiography to multislice CT cholangiography without biliary contrast agent in the assessment of patients with biliary obstruction. Methods and materials: 25 patients with clinical or biochemical signs of biliary obstruction were studied. MR cholangiography was performed with a 1.5 T unit, using respiratory-triggered three-dimensional fast-spin-echo and HASTE sequences; source images, maximum intensity projection, and multiplanar reformatted images were evaluated. CT cholangiography was performed using a multislice scanner, without biliary contrast agent, with intravenous injection of iodinated contrast material; axial, minimum intensity projection, and multiplanar reformatted images were evaluated. CT and MR findings were compared to ERCP in 17 patients, PTC in 6, intraoperative cholangiography in 2. Six patients underwent surgery or fine needle aspiration. Results: ERCP, PTC, surgery, and pathology demonstrated: 10 pancreatic, 2 gallbladder, 2 Klatskin's, and 1 ampullary carcinomas; 1 bile duct obstruction due to enlarged hilar lymph nodes; 7 patients with choledocholithiasis; 1 chronic pancreatitis; 1 patient with negative findings. Regarding site of obstruction, agreement was observed among CT, MR cholangiography and conventional cholangiography in all cases. Concerning the cause of obstruction, the correct diagnosis was made in 23 patients by both MR and CT cholangiography. In two patients with choledocolithiasis, CT cholangiography was judged to be negative, but stones were correctly identified by MR cholangiography. Conclusion: In the assessment of patients with biliary obstruction, multislice CT cholangiography can be considered a useful diagnostic tool alternative to MR cholangiography, which is still the non-invasive standard of reference in the evaluation of the biliary tract.

For display of the biliary system, MDCT of the liver (slice thickness/ collimation 1 mm, pitch 6 mm, table speed 12 mm/s) was performed 25 \u00b1 5 minutes following intravenous administration of meglumine iodipamide (Biliscopin). Subsequent MDCT angiography was added to depict the topographic relationship between biliary and vascular structures. MDCT findings were correlated with intraoperative findings (n = 14). Results: MDCT-CA was diagnostic in all 30 patients. 21 of 30 patients presented with variations in biliary anatomy. These include drainage of liver segment four into right hepatic duct (n = 9), additional right/left segmental ducts draining into the common hepatic duct (n = 8) or the left hepatic duct (n = 4) and trifurcation at the upper confluence (n = 3). Biliary-vascular topography was well depicted in all cases. Intraoperative assessment confirmed the preoperative MDCT-CA findings in all 14 cases. Conclusion: Variations in biliary anatomy appear to be the rule rather than the exception. MDCT-CA represents a non-invasive means for accurately assessing biliary morphology. A continuous helical data set of the heart was acquired in 50 patients (group 1) using the standard protocol with constant tube current, and in 50 patients (group 2) using an alternative protocol with reduced radiation exposure during the systolic phase.

An optimized 3D GE sequence with double-slab excitation (TR 12.3 ms, TE 5.5 ms, slab thickness 12.5 mm) was used in a sagittal plane. In 14 children an additional CE MRA was performed using a standard 3D GE sequence with short TR/TE (~6 ms/~1 ms) after intravenous administration of gadolinium (0.1 mmol/kg). Source images and maximum intensity projections (MIP) were analyzed, evaluating blood-tissue contrast as well as size and focal stenoses of the aortic arch. Results: In 21 of 30 an aortic coarctation could be found. Using the double-slab technique, in 87 % the image quality was high and there was a low sensitivity to flow and breathing motion. There was a good blood-tissue contrast without the use of contrast agent. Using a combined analysis of source images and MIP diagnostic accuracy could be improved. Conclusion: MR imaging represents an excellent tool for non-invasive examination of the cardiovascular system of children. The double slab method allows recording of a large 3D data set in an adequate measurement time especially in small infants, which were not able to hold their breath, and it is well suited for 3D reconstruction.",

Belenkov 2 ; 1 Gaziantep/TR, 2 Moscow/RU Purpose: The TAIS is a new balloon-expandable, stainless steel, tubular stent. This study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of this novel coronary stent and by indirect comparison to indicate equivalence with other formal stent studies. Methods and materials: Patients with angina and a single short (< 15 mm) de novo lesion in a native coronary artery of \u2265 2.75 mm diameter were included. A total of 588 patients were allocated in 2 centers. Most patients (59 %) had stable angina, and 34 % of lesions were type B2 -C. Clinical data was collected at sixand nine-month follow-up. In the first 308 patients angiography was routinely performed at six months. The remaining 280 patients were merely followed up clinically. Results: No stent deployment failure occurred, as well as acute or subacute stent thrombosis. The primary end-point of the study, the six-month MACE-rate was 12.3 %, which is similar to the calculated 15 % MACE-rate in comparable reference studies. Secondary end-points included among others restenosis at six months in the first population. The target vessel diameter was 3.13 \u00b1 0.51 mm. Minimal lumen diameter pre/post procedure and at follow-up was 0.81 \u00b1 0.33, 2.97 \u00b1 0.44, 2.21 \u00b1 0.77 mm, respectively. The binary restenosis rate was 15.5 %. Conclusion: The coronary TAIS stent is safe and effective as a primary device for the treatment of native coronary artery lesions in patients with stable or unstable angina pectoris. Clinical and angiographic results are in the statistical range of equivalence with comparable studies with other current stents. The aim of this study is to asses if the BMI affects the amount of pulmonary atelectasis developing after general anaesthesia, and its effect on atelectasis evolution. Material and methods: Two groups of volunteers aged from 27 to 66 years old were prospectively randomised. They all underwent surgical celioscopy. 20 patients with a BMI over 35 kg/m 2 underwent a gastroplasty and 10 patients representing the control group (BMI under 30 kg/m 2 ) underwent a cystectomy. Before induction of general anaesthesia, three CT sections of 7 mm, were acquired in expiration at the level of interventricular septum. Immediately after surgery and 24 hours later, three CT sections were acquired at the same level. With a threshold of \u22121000 to +100 Hounsfield units, the surface of pulmonary parenchyma was manually extracted from the CT sections. The amount of pulmonary atelectasis was determined with a \u2212100 to +100 HU threshold. Results: A statistically significant difference was observed in comparing the group with a BMI over 35 kg/m 2 and the control group in the development of pulmonary atelectasis (p = 0.0021) and in its evolution (24 h p = 0.0008).",

Patronas; Bethesda, MD/US Lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LYG) represents an angiodestructive lymphoproliferative disorder. Immunosuppression is a major risk factor for the development of LYG and the lungs represent the most commonly affected organ. The purpose of our presentation is to report the pattern of respiratory tract involvement in LYG and assess evolution of these lesions after treatment. 22 patients, six females and 16 males, ranging in age from 26 to 73 years (mean, 48 years) were enrolled on a study on the diagnosis and treatment of LYG. The diagnosis was confirmed by lung biopsy in all patients. CT imaging was performed in all patients upon entering the protocol and follow up scans were performed after the initial evaluation in order to assess the effect of treatment. Pulmonary involvement was evident in all patients. Masses were identified in 19, alveolar and/or interstitial infiltrates in 20, and lymphadenopathy in five patients. Pleural effusion was present in six and pleural thickening in one patient. Eight patients were found to have pulmonary cavities. Pathology studies showed infiltration of the pulmonary parenchyma by lymphoid cells with prominent perivascular distribution. Granulomas with various degrees of ischemia and necrosis were also present. On follow up studies, partial or complete resolution of the pulmonary lesions was noted after treatment. The pattern of pulmonary involvement in patients with LYG is consistent with the pathological findings. The imaging findings are not specific. Pulmonary biopsy is therefore essential for the establishment of an accurate diagnosis. Imaging studies however are useful for evaluating the response to treatment. Method: 13 patients with histologically diagnosed neoplasms underwent initial assessment with clinical examination, pulmonary function tests and high resolution CT. Pulmonary clearance studies were carried out using using a proprietary nebulizer (Amertec, UK) and baselines were obtained contemporaneously with pre-treatment HRCT. Investigations were repeated immediately after treatment and at one and four months. Results were documented independently and compared to determine the presence, severity and timing of changes. Results: Eight patients were able to complete the study; one died and four were withdrawn on medical grounds. Clearance was unaffected by treatment in only one patient, the rest showing a marked increase. In five patients clearance increased immediately post-treatment and occurred in both irradiated and contralateral lung. Only 3 of 8 patients showed demonstrated late changes on HRCT; there was no corresponding change in the contralateral lung on HRCT. There was no correlation between radiation dose and alteration in lung clearance.",

R\u00e9my; Lille/FR Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy of 3 mm thick reconstructed sections in the diagnosis of bronchiectasis with MSCT. Materials and methods: 40 consecutive patients suspected of bronchiectasis underwent MSCT of the entire thorax with a 4 \u00d7 1 mm collimation. From each data set, two series of images were systematically reconstructed with a high-spatial frequency algorithm: 1 mm (Group 1) and 3 mm (Group 2) thick scans, at 10 mm intervals. Three observers independently analyzed the presence of bronchiectasis and associated abnormalities on Group 1 and Group 2 lung images. Results: No significant difference between Group 1 and Group 2 was found in: (a) the detection of bronchiectasis [Group 1: n = 24 (60 %); Group 2: n = 23 (57.5 %); (p = 0.08)]; (b) the evaluation of the extent of bronchiectasis [focal: Group 1; n = 10 (25 %) and Group 2; n = 7 (17.5 %); (p = 0.39) and diffuse: n = 16 (40 %) in both groups]; (c) the characterisation of bronchiectasis [cylindrical: Group 1: n = 24 (60 %); Group 2: n = 21 (53 %); p = 0.08; varicose: Group 1: n = 5 (12.5 %); Group 2: n = 6 (15 %); p = 0.56; cystic (Group 1: n = 2 (5 %); Group 2: n = 2 (5 %)]. Apart from the identification of abnormal bronchial wall thickening (Group 2: n = 35; 87.5 % vs Group 1: n = 31; 77.5 %; p < 0.05), recognition of associated abnormalities did not differ between the two groups. Conclusion: A comparable accuracy of 3 mm and 1 mm thick reconstructed scans in the detection and characterization of bronchiectasis allows the recommendation of a 4 \u00d7 2.5 mm collimation with reconstruction of 3 mm thick scans in the screening of bronchiectasis, reducing the radiation dose of MSCT examinations by 20 %. Purpose: For the development, optimization and validation of inhalation therapies it is important to develop a model that covers individual anatomical data, application process, deposition and uptake of applied medication. Using CFD, velocities and deposition within the individually segmented tracheo-bronchial tree were simulated. Material and methods: Multislice CT datasets (n = 20) of the lung were segmented using a hybrid segmentation algorithm to detect the tracheo-bronchial-tree. This algorithm consists of: (a) 3D seeding process, (b) 2D bronchus finder (fuzzy-logicsystem), (c) 2D module to identify peripheral bronchi (template-matching). The influence of three reconstruction kernels on the segmentation process was inves-tigated. The hybrid system was compared to a merely threshold-based segmentation tool by visual assessment performed by two radiologists. The segmented images were used to reconstruct the 3D geometry of the tracheo-bronchial airways. This is meshed using an unstructured tetrahedral mesh. Flow analysis and particle tracking model is carried out using CFD to simulate in-and expiratory breath velocities.",

            "text": "The study was conducted on volumetric helical data sets obtained from 20 patients with various chronic airway diseases. Acquisitions were performed during breath holding following a full inspiration without any contrast agent. Axial images were reconstructed with 1.25 mm thickness and 0.6 mm intervals. For each patient, the bronchial tree was reconstructed using 2 different techniques. The first one consists in a slice-by-slice segmentation of airway lumens followed by a 3D reconstruction using a topological propagation and filtering. The second one is fully-3D and relies on a diffusive-aggregative Markovian modeling, which takes advantage of the structural and topological features of the airways. In both cases, the bronchial tree was visualized in a CT bronchogram mode, using a semi-transparent volume rendering technique. The images were assessed independently by 2 radiologists using a scoring system established on the basis of a reference bronchial tree defined up to the subsegmental level. Results: The bronchial tree was reconstructed up to the 6 th order by both techniques without any significant difference (96 % accuracy and 97 % robustness). The fully 3D technique running twice faster, proved in addition the capability to reconstruct smaller bronchi distal to the 6 th order. Conclusion: 3D bronchography obtained from multislice CT is an accurate technique to reconstruct the airways up to the 6 th -7 th order of division. . The results were compared to 50 patients, which were examined with a standard protocol (120 mAs: G120). All other parameters were kept constant. Subjective image quality was rated using a three point scale. Objective criteria, based on signal-tonoise measurements, were assessed. Results: Image quality was sufficient in all cases. Subjective gradings of image quality, based on soft tissue window settings, were 1.1 for the 120 mAs protocol, 1.1 (G+10), 1.1 (G\u00b10), 1.3 (G\u221210), and 1.2 (G\u221220), for the body weight adapted protocols. Objective criteria showed mean standard deviation values of 5.7 HU for the 120 mAs protocol. For the dose reduced protocols, values were calculated as 7.6 HU (G+10), 7.9 HU (G\u00b10), 8.7 HU (G\u221210) and finally 9.1 HU (G\u221220). Best correlation for the whole subgroup was achieved for the \u221210 protocol, with nearly constant noise related to the body weight in all patients. Conclusions: By deriving mAs values from body weight estimation, an individually adapted protocol for chest CT can be recommended. With an adaptation of the tube current time product (x mAs = m \u2212 10, m \u2026 body weight in kg), a well balanced examination, even in soft-tissue window settings, can be performed. Therefore, for other types of CT scanners, analogous protocols may be adapted. Highland Heights, OH/US Purpose: Current CT liver perfusion methods typically involve limited (2 cm or less) z-axis coverage with the results displayed in the form of axial cross-sectional perfusion maps. We implemented a full-organ liver perfusion technique and explored the usefulness of providing full-organ volume-rendered perfusion maps. Methods: Ten CT liver perfusion studies were acquired (technique) for patients with hepatic masses using a series of 5 consecutive acquisitions of the liver during one breathold after the injection of a bolus of contrast (4 -5 ml/s). Images of each slice location were acquired every 8.5 seconds. Liver perfusion maps were produced using previously published techniques and displayed in both axial and volume rendered modes. Results: Multislice-Spiral acquisitions with a pitch of 1.5 and a 0.5 s rotation enabled full coverage of the liver, portal vein and spleen, which were used as inputs for the perfusion calculation. Both the axial and volume-rendered perfusion maps depicted characteristic perfusion patterns of various types of hepatic tumors. Small tumors were depicted as area of hyperperfusion, while advanced tumors exhibited a ring of hypervascular tissue surrounding a necrotic core. Perfusion values of normal liver tissue corresponded to expected physiological ranges. Further investigation is warranted to understand the sampling rate required for clinically relevant quantitative measurements. Conclusion: Multislice CT scanners may enable full organ assessments of liver perfusion. Volume rendering of perfusion images allows potentially superior assessment of perfusion abnormalities and might be used to predict the effectiveness of chemo-and thermoablation therapy. (ratios) were determined using AMARES. Additionally, absolute values of phosphorous metabolites were determined using SLOOP and an concentration of 2.5 mmol for ATP as internal standard, including corrections for inhomogenous B1-fields, T1 relaxation. 10 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with liver chirrosis were included. Results: AMARES allowed relative quantification (metabolite ratios) in all volunteers, however, only in 7/10 patients, due to low signal to noise ratios. Using, SLOOP as postprocessing method, all acquired 31 P-spectra had sufficient signal to noise ratios for all analyzed metabolites. In healthy liver parenchyma, absolute concentrations for PME, Pi and PME were 2.3 \u00b1 0.8, 1.5 \u00b1 0.6 and 15 \u00b1 6.2 mmol respectively. For patients PME and Pi increased to 6.2 \u00b1 3.8 and 1.8 \u00b1 0.7, PDE showed no significant changes (15.2 \u00b1 7.2). Conclusion: Using SLOOP, significant changes of energy metabolism, which is a parameter for hepatic vitality, can be observed in patients with chronic liver disease. Compared to conventional postprocessing packages, SLOOP allows for a robust and quantitative assessment. Methods and materials: CT scans of 408 patients with 311 malignant (79 primary and 232 metastatic) and 97 benign changes were retrospectively rewieved over a 5-year period. There were 181 women and 227 men. The study protocol consisted of 5 and 8 mm slices of the liver area. Images were obtained before and after intravenous injection of non-ionic contrast agent (Iopromidum 623.40 mg/ml) in a standard dosage 2 cm 3 /kg, as a bolus. Original films were rewieved and sought in favour of capsular retraction by two independent radiologists. The number, location, size, density of the tumor and presence of capsular retraction were evaluated. The final diagnosis of focal changes was based on histopathological findings. Results: Twelve of 408 patients (prevalence 2.9 %) revealed retraction of liver capsule, which was associated with adjacent hepatic tumor. All 12 tumors were proven pathologically to be malignant (4 hepatocellular carcinoma, 3 colorectal metastases, 1 stomach cancer metastasis, 1 epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, 1 prostate cancer metastasis, 1 breast cancer metastasis and 1 carcinoid).",

The average of 3 measurements of sagittal right (30) and left kidney (28), sagittal bladder (9), sagittal spleen (20), CBD (21), and GB wall (18) were recorded. The correlation of the measurements between both methods was caclulated. Analysis of variance for measurements of structures < 1 cm (CBD, GB wall) was performed to assess for the intra-observer variability.",

The correlation coefficients were 0.62 and 0.23 for the CBD and the GB wall. The correlation coefficient for CBD and GB was 0.56. The variance of measurements for the CBD and GB was 0.22 cm for conventional and 0.24 cm for VirtualProbe\u00ae. Although it exists a statistical difference between both methods for these two structures (p = 0.023), the absolute value of the measurement difference (0.02 cm) was less than the intraobserver variability of the conventional data alone (S.D. = 0.09 cm). To evaluate the possible role of multislice CT (MSCT) in the preoperative evaluation of patients candidate to laparoscopic splenectomy. Material and methods: 32 patients underwent MSCT with 0.5 seconds gantry rotation time. Pre (4 \u00d7 2.5 mm collimation) and post-contrast (4 \u00d7 1 mm collimation) acquisitions, during arterial and portal venous phases were performed after i.v. administration of 140 ml of non ionic contrast agent at 4 ml/s, with a delay time of respectively 22 and 60 seconds. Real time interaction with the post-contrast 3D data set was performed on a dedicated workstation to determine total spleen volume, and to assess arterial and venous vascular anatomy. For volumetric determination an hand-trace editing was used to calculate spleen mass to select candidates for laparoscopic procedure. Results: At surgery mean volume was 998 cm 3 . Calculation based on CT provided a mean error of 8 %. In none of the patients undergoing laparoscopic splenectomy, a conversion in laparotomy was needed. Five patients underwent laparotomic splenectomy because of spleen volume greater than 1200 cm 3 . In all cases optimal vascular detail was achieved. Conclusion: High resolution MSCT afforded complete parenchymal, vascular, and volumetric preoperative evaluation of potential laparoscopic splenectomy. Volumetric determination provided accurate and reproducible information.",

Materials and methods: 32 patients (14 males, 18 females, mean age 56, range 41 -82) with proximal biliary obstruction due to hilar tumors, treated by biliary stenting using plastic, 7 -12 F, stents were studied. The efficacy of the drainage was assessed clinically and by biochemical parameters. Ultrasonographically the size of the right and left hepatic ducts (RHD/LHD) and the intrahepatic bile ducts were noted before and after stenting. The presence and degree of aerobilia and the position of the stent (the proximal end above or below the stenosis) were noted after stenting. of pancreatic structures and abnormalities were evaluated using a three point grading scheme. Furthermore the differentiation of cystic versus solid tumors was compared. Results: In the detection of pancreatic lesions there was no statistically significant difference between both modalities (overall sensitivity 67 % with THI and 64 % with BM, specificity 100 % with THI and 97 % with BM). The differentiation between simple cystic, complicated cystic or solid tumors, is improved with THI. The visibility of the pancreas was not sufficient in 23 % because of technical problems (eg. meteorism). In patients with adequate visualisation of the pancreas the pancreatic duct could not be sufficiently delineated in 38 % with THI and 59 % with BM. Conclusions: Image contrast and delineation of the pancreas as well as diagnostic accuracy are improved with THI in comparison to conventional sonography.",

Dalla Palma 2 ; 1 Budapest/HU, 2 Trieste/IT Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine capabilities of Pulse Inversion Harmonic Imaging (PIHI) with Levovist in characterization of focal liver lesions in cirrhotic liver. Methods and materials: 39 liver focal lesions in 25 consecutive cirrhotic patients identified by baseline ultrasound (US), were evaluated by color Doppler (CD) and PIHI. PIHI was performed 30 seconds (vascular phase) and 3 -5 minutes (late phase) after Levovist injection. Helical CT (HCT) (n = 15) or surgical/bioptic histologic findings (n = 10) were considered as reference procedures. Results: 30 lesions classified as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by reference procedures appeared hypoechoic (n = 19), isoechoic (n = 5) or hyperechoic (n = 6) on baseline US, with basket pattern (n = 10), vessels within tumor (n = 6), peripheral (n = 4) or no vascular pattern (n = 10) on CD. On PIHI they appeared hyperechoic (n = 26) or isoechoic (n = 4) on vascular phase and prevalently hypoechoic (n = 22) or isoechoic (n = 6) and rarely hyperechoic (n = 2) on late phase. Four (4) lesions classified as regenerative nodules by reference procedures appeared hypoechoic on baseline US, with peripheral (n = 1) or no vascular pattern (n = 3) on CD. On PIHI they appeared hypoechoic (n = 3) or isoechoic (n = 1) on vascular phase, remaining prevalently hypoechoic (n = 3) or isoechoic (n = 1) on late phase. Five (5) lesions classified as hemangioma by reference procedures appeared hyperechoic (n = 4) or hypoechoic (n = 1) on baseline US with few flow signal on CD. On PIHI they revealed progressive fill-in or dot-like enhancement during vascular and late phase. Conclusions: PIHI with Levovist had identified some typical enhancement pattern in focal liver lesions in cirrhotic patients. Conclusions: MRI has low sensitivity to identify small lymph nodes. When visible, MRI with SINEREM has high sensitivity to identify metastatic lymph nodes; the overall low specificity was due to a learning curve in the first cases.

Fully anesthetized, the animals underwent MR examination twice: prior to and three weeks following implantation of VX2-tumor cells to the left flank. For each session 1.0 ml of undiluted MS-325 was injected subcutaneously into both dorsal foot pads. 3D MR imaging was performed on a 1.5 T whole body scanner prior to as well as 5, 10, and 15 minutes post injection of the compound. Contrast medium uptake in the individual lymph nodes and the lymph node size were determined. Finally all animals were euthanized and lymph nodes were analyzed by histopathology. Results: Interstitial MR lymphography with MS-325 visualized lymphatic structures as well as popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes in all animals. VX2 tumours were well differentiated from surrounding tissues in all rabbits. Maximum enhancement values were present 10 minutes following contrast medium injection in both normal and tumour-invaded lymph nodes. ROI measurements in normal lymph nodes revealed statistically significant higher CNR values compared to tumourbearing lymph nodes. Vastly reduced contrast medium uptake in tumour invaded lymph nodes permitted easy detection thereof. The size of normal and tumor-invaded nodes was not significantly different.",

Purpose: To evaluate MR-Lymphography by employment of iron oxide contrast material (SINEREM) in the preoperative evaluation of lymph node (LN) metastases of rectal cancer. Method/materials: MR-Lymphography of the pelvis was performed using plain and enhanced MR images after 24 to 36 hours after intravenous administration of superparamagnetic iron oxides at a dosage of 2.6 mg Fe/kg b.w. Conventional T1and T2-weighted spin-echo sequences as well as T2-weighted gradient echo sequences were performed. A total of 8 patients were examined. MRI findings were correlated to histopathology in every case. Results: A total of 108 LN in 8 patients were histopathologically evaluated and the findings correlated with MRI. 7 LN metastases were detected histopathologically. MRI was able to detect 6 of the 7 metastatic LN. The size of the analysed LN was approx. 5 mm in most of the cases. All malignant LN presented with a size between 10 and 25 mm. MRI missed one LN metastasis with a size of 6 mm. 3 LN metastasis had a size between 6 -10 mm, 2 LN metastasis were 16 -20 mm in size, and 1 LN metastasis had a max. diameter of 25 mm.

Following intravascular injection, circulating immune cells are exposed to high concentrations of ICM. As neutrophils constitutively undergo apoptosis, we hypothesised that ICM may adversely affect neutrophil survival. Our aim was, therefore, to investigate the effect of ICM on neutrophil apoptosis. Materials and methods: Neutrophils were isolated from healthy subjects and cultured in vitro with ionic (diatrizoate and ioxaglate) and non-ionic (iohexol and iotrolan) ICM. Neutrophil apoptosis was quantified by annexin V flow cytometry, and caspase dependence determined using the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (100 \u00b5mol). Results: Data presented as percentage apoptosis \u00b1 S.E.M.

Material and methods: Oxygen tension was measured with modified Clark-type microelectrodes and blood flow with laser-Doppler flow probes. Results: Administration of CM decreased the outer medullary oxygen tension in non-diabetic animals by \u223c 35 %. This response was absent in diabetic animals. Renal outer medullary blood flow of non-diabetic animals increased after CMadministration and remained elevated (\u223c 25 %). In contrast, no change in outer medullary blood flow occurred in the diabetic animals. Glucose infused non-diabetic animals responded similarly in medullary oxygen tension to normoglycemic animals, but similarly to diabetic animals in medullary blood flow, following CMinjection. Conclusion: We conclude that diabetic animals have an altered response in renal outer medullary blood flow and oxygen tension to CM compared to normoglycemic animals. However, in contrast to corresponding control rats, outer medullary oxygen tension did not decrease in diabetic animals, which suggests other mechanisms than hemodynamic changes to explain the increased renal failure frequency in this risk group for CM-induced nephropathy.",

Results: The duration of the enhancement was respectively (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) 255 \u00b1 50 s for the Levovist\u00ae and 307 \u00b1 93, 304 \u00b1 78, 301 \u00b1 85 and 386 \u00b1 97 s for each dose of Optison\u00ae (1, 2, 3, and 4 ml). Peak enhancement was respectively 17.8 \u00b1 5.1 dB for the Levovist\u00ae and 20.4 \u00b1 3.4, 21.6 \u00b1 3.4, 21.9 \u00b1 2.8 and 22.3 \u00b1 2.2 dB for each dose of Optison\u00ae. AUC was respectively (linear units) 5009 for the Levovist\u00ae and 6311, 10765, 13522 and 15854 for each dose of Optison\u00ae. A linear relationship was found between the dose of Optison\u00ae and the enhancement (r > 0.97). Levovist\u00ae enhancement exhibited a larger variability between patients. Purpose: This study was designed to validate the reliability of the AO comprehensive classification using routine radiographs to predict the intra-operative findings.",

Conclusion: The use of plain films or CR to categorize fractures of the thoracolumbar spine according to the AO classification was associated with a designation of 28 % of unstable B injuries as stable type A injuries. There is moderate interobserver variability. with suspected spine injury were evaluated using Rx and spiral CT performed in admitting area. All patients received standard thoracic CT (5 mm/pitch 1.5) and abdominal CT (8 mm/pitch 1.5) according to an established trauma protocol including sagittal MPR reconstructions of suspicious vertebral bodies. Rx and CT were independently evaluated by two blinded radiologists for detectability of fracture signs and classified in three groups (G1 -G3): definitely fractured (G1); non conclusive result (G2); definitely no fracture (G3). All suspected fractures were confirmed by an additional high resolution CT (2 mm -3 mm/pitch 1.5) and clinical follow up. Results: In 21 patients (37 %) of the 56 patients a spine fracture could be depicted. 2 fractures were missed in Rx, none in CT. 98 % of the CT reports and 89 % of the Rx reports were classified correctly true positive (G1) or true negative (G3). 8.4 % of Rx-reports were non conclusive (G2), but only 1 % in CT. In comparison CT versus Rx sensitivity was 1/0.88, specificity 0.98/0.92, positive predictive value 0.93/0.92 and negative predictive value 1/0.97 Conclusion: Using an established standard CT protocol for chest and abdomen examination with slice thickness of 5 mm and 8 mm respectively all relevant spine fractures can be detected. These results suggest that Rx of thoracic and lumbar spine is not mandatory in the admitting area, when thoracic and abdominal CT is performed.",

Sasiadek; Wroclaw/PL Purpose: To analyze the correlation between CT appearances of spine injuries and clinical findings and thus to establish the clinical significance of the finding at CT. Methods and materials: CT studies have been performed in 193 patients after spine injury. In most of them plain films of the spine were performed prior to CT. 27 patients had also MR. Head CT was performed in 25 cases and chest CT in 18 patients. CT findings (the presence of fractures and facet joints injuries, number of involved vertebrae and spinal columns, narrowing of spinal canal, instability features, intervertebral disc lesions, normal study, etc.) have been compared statistically with clinical symptoms (pain, spinal medulla injury, radicular symptoms, disturbance of consciousness, etc.). Results: There was statistically significant correlation found between clinical signs of spinal medulla injury and several CT symptoms (instability, spinal canal narrowing, number of affected vertebrae and columns, facet joint lesions). In patients with pain and no severe neurological signs there was positive correlation with a normal CT study. Radicular symptoms have been associated with intervertebral disc lesions and in chronic cases with degenerative changes of the spine. Consciousness disturbances have been negatively correlated with spine fractures, while positively with normal CT appearance of the spine and traumatic changes on head CT. Conclusion: CT symptoms of spine injury are highly correlated with severity of the clinical and neurological findings, except for consciousness disturbances which are associated with simultaneous head injury. Thus, CT is very helpful in establishing prognosis and treatment planning. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficiency and safety of self-expandable stent insertion in patients with acute colonic malignant obstruction before elective surgical resection. Between March 1999 and March 2001, 24 patients (15 males and 9 females, mean age 74, range 41 -93) were included. All the patients were scored ASA III. Colonic cancers were located between the rectosigmoid and the middle part of the descending colon. All patients had plain abdominal radiography and CT scan to demonstrate the complete obstruction of the colon and to localise the stenosis. Immediate technical success was obtained in 23 of 24 patients (96 %). The mean time between stent insertion and surgery was 6 days (3 to 9). In 2 cases (8 %), stents were misplaced and did not covered the lesion which required the insertion of an other stent. In 2 (8 %)other cases, the stent was initially well positioned but migrated secondarily which required the insertion of a second stent in one and a surgery in a other one. Colonic perforation occurred in 3 (12 %) patients. These 3 patients underwent surgery, one of them developed an abscess which required percutaneous drainage under radiological guidance, other (8 %) patients underwent ileostomia because of a missprepared colon by stent dysfunction (obstruction). There was no more morbidity (21 %) and no death (0 %) at the moment. Self-expandable stent insertion is an efficient minimally invasive procedure that allows for single-stage surgery. However, this technique is quite difficult to perform and may be associated with some complications. Sites of obstruction were antro-duodenum (n = 18), postoperative anastomotic site (n = 19; 12 gastroenterostomy, six esophagojejunostomy, and one duodenojejunostomy). All stents were covered with polyurethane. The size of the stent ranged from 15 -20 mm in diameter and 7 -20 cm in length. With fluoroscopic guidance, covered self-expandable metallic stents were placed. Results: Stent placement was technically successful in all patients without or with the gastrostomy (n = 3) and balloon dilatation (n = 3). After stent placement, symptoms improved in all but one patient, who had another stenosis at the proximal jejunum. During the follow-up of 2 -73 (mean 13) weeks, stent migration occurred in four patients (10.8 %) 1 -41 days after the procedure. Those patients were treated successfully by means of placing a second covered metallic stent (n = 3) or endoscopic reposition (n = 1). Recurred obstructive symptoms due to tumor overgrowth (n = 2) and mechanical failure of stent (n = 2) were noted. One of tumor overgrowth and both of the mechanical failure of stent were treated by means of coaxial placement of a second covered stent with good clinical result. Conclusion: Fluoroscopy-guided placement of covered self-expandable metallic stents can be considered as the primary choice for the palliation of malignant obstructions in those patients. The laparoscopically placed adjustable gastric band (Lap-Band\u2122) has been popularised as a minimally invasive, adjustable and completely reversible surgical technique for the management of morbid obesity. We report our experience with particular emphasis on the radiological aspects of follow-up and patient results in terms of short-term weight loss and complications. Methods: Between May 1998 and December 2000 50 patients were treated (8 male/42 female) with a mean age of 37 years (range 30 -48 years). The technique of fluoroscopy guided band inflation is illustrated with particular emphasis on radiological lessons learned. A new method of measurement of pouch volume and the passage within the band is described.",

One patient developed a peristomal leakage due to bowel atony and incomplete voiding of the stomach managed by insertion of a jejunal nutrition catheter through the gastrostomy tract whereafter the leakage subsided an the gastrostomy tract healed. One patient had minor suture infection and delayed gastric voiding. In one patient the early catheter dislocation and peritonitis occurred due to erroneous food injection into the balloon port. Conclusion: Radiological gastrostomy by means of ballon-retained catheters is a feasible and relative safe procedure. Most complications can be managed conservatively or interventionally. Care should be taken to avoid erroneous injection into the balloon port, especially within the first week of PG in order to avoid tube dislocation. To compare the diagnostic accuracies of sonography, scintigraphy in diagnosing ileocecal Crohn's disease (CD) and assessing its activity compared to enteroclysis and final diagnosis. Method: A retrospective analysis of the studies of 54 patients (30 females, 24 males, ages of 18 -71) with verified CD (operation: 8, biopsy: 50 cases). located to the ileocecal region was made. All patients had enteroclysis, sonography (4 -8 MHz receiving frequency with Native Tissue Harmonic Imaging, and measurement of the flow in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA)) and 45 of them had 99 Tc AgAb immunoscintigraphy with SPECT. The results were compared. Results: Overall sensitivity of enteroclysis, sonography and immunoscintigraphy was 100 %, 89 % and 71 %. In early Crohn disease (12 cases) the sensitivities were 100 %, 75 % and 40 % respectively. In detecting active disease (determined by the presence of ulcerations or fistulas in enteroclysis) immunoscintigraphy had 70 % sensitivity, 33 % specificity. Increased SMA flow had 76 % sensitivity; 100 % specificity, while wall thickening (> 3 mm) had 92 % sensitivity; 33 % specificity. Using a combined sonographic criteria (presence of destroyed wall stratification or detection of fistulas or abscesses or increased SMA flow) 96 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity is obtained. Surgical indications (fistulas or abscesses) were detected in 6/8 cases by both enteroclysis and sonography. Conclusion: Although the sensitivity of sonography in early CD is not sufficient for detecting suspected CD, for follow up in advanced cases sonography could replace enteroclysis. New combined sonographic criteria gives excellent correlation with enteroclysis detected activity. Sensitivity for detecting abscesses might compensate for missed fistulas.",

Pruszynski; Warsaw/PL Purpose: To evaluate the new method -combined CT enteroclysis and CT colonography -for the assessment of whole bowel in patients with Crohn's disease. Method and materials: 20 patients suspected of having Crohn's disease underwent CT colonography after i.v contrast material injection. In 10 of them 1500 ml of fluid was administered by nasoenteric tube positioned in the duodenojejunal region (CT enteroclysis) and in another 10 patients water was given orally (1500 -2000 ml), beginning 30 -40 minutes before the examination. Intestinal and extraintestinal abnormalities were evaluated. Small bowel distention was assessed in 4 grade scale (good = 4, poor = 1). Results were compared to enteroclysis, colonoscopy and intraoperative findings. Results: In 15 patients with confirmed Crohn's disease CT correctly identified all involved small bowel (n = 17) and colonic (n = 8) segments, although underestimated their length in 5 cases (20 %). Mesenteric involvement was seen in 10 of 15 patients with Crohn's disease (67 %), lymphadenopathy in 14 (93 %), perianal disease in 6 (40 %), abscess and fistula in 1 patient (7 %). The distention of small bowel was significantly better on CT enteroclysis (mean score 3.3) than on CT performed after oral fluid administration (mean score 2.7). Conclusion: Both techniques enabled simultaneous evaluation of small and large bowel during single examination and allowed identification of all involved bowel segments, although, visualization of small bowel was significantly better with the use of CT enteroclysis than after oral administration of fluid. Material and methods: 50 patients affected by CD were examinated at 1.5 T, using fat and non fat-suppressed T2 w HASTE sequences after administration of a negative superparamagnetic oral contrast agent and T1w FLASH sequences, pre and post Gd-DTPA injection. All patients underwent endoscopy, US, barium studies (gold standard), 7 had surgery. All MRI data were blindly evaluated by two radiologists. The degree of strictures, the presence of small bowel dilation, adhesions, sinus tracts, fistulas, abscesses, biliary, pancreatic and renal abnormalities were evaluated. Results: MRI correctly detected 95 % of strictures (100/105), 100 % of adhesions (47), 85 % of fistulas (18/21), 100 % of abscesses (5), hydronephrosis (2), biliary, renal and pancreatic stones (5). In 6/50 patients (12 %) MRI showed complications undetected by the gold-standard modalities. Conclusions: MRI is a promising method to assess main complications of CD.",

Dimopoulos; Patras/GR Purpose: In this study we evaluate the efficacy of extrapleural injection of normal saline at the initial procedural phase of percutaneous lung biopsy in order to prevent pneumothorax. Methods: 66 patients underwent PLB under CT guidance, for diagnosis of lung lesions. The patients were randomized in either group A or B. In 33 patients (group A) normal saline was injected beneath the parietal pleura just before the procedure. In the remaining 33 patients (group B) no saline was used. All biopsies were conducted under CT using a 19 G -22 G coaxial needle system. In group A, after local anesthetic infusion, the needle was advanced in the subpleural fat and 20 -30 ml of saline were injected extrapleurally, in order to create a bulge of pleura into the lung parenchyma, adjacent to the lesion. All patients had CT scan 15 min after, and plain chest radiogram after 4 hours after the procedure in order to evaluate the presence of pneumothorax. Results: The procedure was well tolerated in group A. Pneumothorax developed in 3 patients (9.1 %) in group A. In group B, pneumothorax occured in 7 patients (21.2 %) and in one instance drainage was required (3.03 %). The technique prolonged the duration of the procedure 9 -17 min in group A.

The set is composed of a guide stylet and a 22 Chiba needle. The guide stylet is made of stainless steel with a diameter of 0.41 mm (William Cook Europe A/S, Bjaeverskov, Denmark) The 22 G Chiba needle is initially introduced in the thoracic wall and the guide stylet is advanced through the needle towards the lesion. When the stylet has been correctly directed, the needle is also advanced towards the same direction. The stylet serves either as a guide for the biopsy needle, or as an exchange wire in cases where a larger (Core or Tru-Cut) needle is required for adequate sampling. The stylet can be curved before its insertion inside the 22 G needle in order to reach lesions which require redirection of the needle. For this purpose a torque device is used to point to the direction of the curved stylet Results: The technique was easy to perform in all cases. Five patients with lung biopsies developed pneumothorax (16.66 %). The stylet was advanced beyond the lesion in 4 cases, without clinical consequences and without this affecting the biopsy outcome.

Takahashi 2 ; 1 Moriya/JP, 2 Ibaraki/JP Purpose: We establish both new device and a biopsy method to localize lesions in term of three-dimensions by CT in order to perform the biopsy of small nodular lesions in the lung field confidently, safely, and rapidly. Material and method: We carried out CT guided lung biopsy in 20 cases of nodular lesions more than 5 mm in diameter. None of them contained calcifications. We simulated a targeting line by using a new device for CT guidance, \"TARG\" developed by us. We then confirmed the right track of the guiding needle. The biopsy needle that we used was \"Pro-MAG\". The average time needed to complete the procedure was fifteen minutes. Results: Ten lesions were primary lung cancer. One of them was ground glass opacity lesion measuring 7 mm in diameter. This is what we call carcinoma of type A classified by Noguchi. One case was lung metastasis from colon cancer (8 mm in diameter). Conclusion: This technique enables us to obtain enough material by pinpointing and shooting peripheral lung lesions approximately 10 mm in diameter. We strongly believe that this technique contributes significantly to the progress of lung cancer treatment.",

Gentile, M. Midulla, M. Salvatore; Naples/IT Objective: Compare safety and efficacy of CT guided fine needle biopsy (FNAB) of small (\u2264 15 mm) lung lesions in inpatients and outpatients. Materials and methods: 100 consecutive inpatients (65 M, 35 F, mean age 56) and 100 consecutive outpatients (72 M, 28 F, mean age 50) who underwent CT guided FNAB of small lung lesions at our Institution from May 1999 to July 2001 were included. Lesion size, thickness of aerated lung traversed, number of needle passes, presence of emphysema were recorded for the two patient groups. 22 G Chiba needles and the roll-over technique (1 hour) were used for all patients; in the absence of significant pneumothorax at a subsequent expiratory chest roentgenogram, outpatients were allowed to go home and instructed to return in case of dyspnea or unusual symptoms. Incidence of pneumothorax and other complications, need for tube insertion and percentage of diagnostic samples were noted for both groups. Results: No statistical differences were observed in lesion size, thickness of aerated lung traversed, needle passes, presence of emphysema between the groups. We had 15 pneumothoraces in inpatients, two requiring a small caliber chest tube, and 12 in outpatients, all within 1 hour from the procedure, none requiring a tube. Citology diagnosed a malignant lung neoplasm in 58 outpatients and 64 inpatients, absence of malignant cells in 33 and 25; the sample was inadequate in 9 and 11 respectively. All differences are nonsignificant. Conclusion: CT guided FNAB of small lung lesions in outpatients is a safe and reliable procedure, allowing significant decrease in hospitalization costs.",

Tasks consisted of flexion/extension of the fingers and a complex digital sequence of both hands. Data analysis was performed using SPM99 software. Results: In control subjects and in patients during movements of the hand ipsilateral to the tumor, activation was present in the contralateral hemisphere in the primary sensorimotor cortex, postSMA, and both secondary sensory cortex. During complex movements, additional activation was present in the contralateral preSMA, anterior cingulum, ipsilateral primary sensory cortex, lateral premotor area, and both parietal lobules. Before surgery, activation patterns were similar. However, during simple movements contralateral to the tumor, additional activation was present in the ipsilateral postSMA and lateral premotor area. During complex movements, activation was also present in the ipsilateral preSMA and anterior cingulum.

Purpose: First experiences in comparing different methods for localization of brain function in the setting of neuronavigated guided surgery. Maximum accuracy by using the same MRI-3D-dataset for fMRI and neuronavigation. Material and methods: 12 patients suffering from intracerebral tumours in the central region performed a finger-tapping task of the contralateral hand in fMRI. Activated areas were superimposed on a 3D-GE-MRI dataset including the surface fiducials for neuronavigated surgery. The coordinates of the voxel with highest statistical threshold was determined and compared with the coordinates of maximal response using intraoperative monopolar cortical stimulation. Results: In all patients central sulcus and postcentral gyrus were identified by fMRI. In 2 patients intraoperative stimulation was not possible. In 10 patients coordinates of maximum activation differed by 12 mm mean euclidean distance (stdev. 7 mm, range 2 to 28 mm). The distance was mainly dependent on the different approach of cortical stimulation to the surface of the brain and fMRI activation in the depths of central sulcus (hand motor area). Larger distances were due to a distorted morphology of central area from invading tumour. There was no influence of tumour histology, had motion during the fMRI experiment or hemiparesis. Conclusion: In the setting of neuronavigated guided surgery and intraoperative monitoring, fMRI may help to guide the placement of a cortical electrode on the surface of the brain. Maximum stimulation or activation points differ due to the approach, especially if morphology of the central area is distorded by tumour. This has to be considered in preoperative planning.",

Results: In case 1 the trajectory for the catheter with 125 I seed was remodeled after fMRI. Performance on fMRI for monitoring the effect of deep brain stimulation was poor in case 2, as the localizer of the stereotactical system caused severe distortions of EPI-images.

Tintera 2 ; 1 Hradec Kralove/CZ, 2 Prague/CZ Purpose: Several experimental studies assigned vascular compression of the left rostral ventrolateral medulla (LRVM) as a possible cause of essential hypertension. Published data concerning the MR imaging of the neurovascular compression of the medulla oblongata widely differ, particularly due to methodological incongruities. The aim of the study is to conduct a blinded prospective MR study of normotensive and hypertensive individuals. Methods and materials: We examined 32 patients with severe essential hypertension (mean age 52 \u00b1 9 years) and 40 normotensive subjects (mean age 53 \u00b1 10 years). MR imaging protocol consisted of transverse and coronal T2 TSE (slice thickness 3 mm), transverse 3D TOF MRA (0.8 mm) and 3D CISS (1 mm) sequences. The presence and degree of vascular compression at the lower brain stem and particularly at the LRVM were evaluated together with the conspicuity of the anatomical structures on different MR imaging sequences. Results: Among 32 hypertensive patients, 24 (75 %) showed neurovascular contact of the medulla at any location and 6 (19 %) at the LRVM. In the control group of 40 normotensive subjects, 32 (80 %) showed neurovascular contact of the medulla and 13 (32 %) of the LRVM. Compared to T2 TSE and 3D TOF imaging sequences, 3D CISS offered better contrast resolution of neural and vascular structures and superior delineation of the outer vascular contours. Conclusion: Neurovascular compression of medulla oblongata is a frequent finding in both hypertensive and normotensive subjects. Our results do not support the hypothesis of neurovascular compression at the LRVM as an etiological factor of essential hypertension.",

Scutt 1 , N. Roberts 1 ; 1 Liverpool/GB, 2 Cardiff/GB, 3 Essex/GB Purpose: The fornix is the principal tract that links the hippocampus with the midline diencephalon. The relative contribution of the fornix in human memory is debated and a reliable method is required for estimating the extent of fornix damage in patients with anterograde amnesias. This study aims to develop an efficient and unbiased approach for estimating the fornix volume on 3D MR images. Subjects and methods: 12 healthy subjects and four patients with organic amnesia (one or other of the fornices were severed) were recruited. MR examinations were performed using a 1.5 T SIGNA (General Electric, Milwaukee), and T1weighted images were obtained using a 3D SPGR pulse sequence (TR/TE 34/ 9 ms, flip angle 30\u00b0, slice thickness 1.6 mm). Image analysis was performed using ANALYZE TM (Mayo Foundation, Rochester) and mri3dX (http://www.liv.ac.uk/mariarc/mri3dX).

Lammers 1 , M.A. van Buchem 1 ; 1 Leiden/NL, 2 London/GB Purpose: Recently, a close association between narcolepsy and HLA-DqB1*0602 was found and linked to loss of hypocretin production by hypothalamic neurons, as suggested by lack of CSF-hypocretin-1 levels. The aim of this study was to assess potential (autoimmune-based) hypothalamic degeneration using voxel-based morphometry. Methods/materials: 15 narcoleptics and 15 age-and sex-matched controls were included. All patients were HLA-DqB1*0602-positive, had typical findings during polysomnographic and Multiple Sleep Latency testing, and had no CSF-hypocretin-1. To optimize gray-white matter contrast, we used a 3D-T1 gradient-echo sequence with TR/TE 26/12 ms, flip-angle 45\u00b0, 256 \u00d7 256 matrix, 100 slices of 1.5 mm and FOV 250 mm. VBM was used for brain extraction, spatial linear and non-linear normalization, segmentation and smoothing. Univariate analyses for gray and white matter were performed with statistical parametric mapping, employing the General Linear Model. Regionally specific increases or decreases in gray or white matter between groups were assessed, with age, sex and global mean voxel values as confounders (p < 0.05, corrected for whole brain volume). Because of our strong prior hypothesis for structural change in the hypothalamic region, we also assessed uncorrected data with a small volume correction for the hypothalamus (p < 0.001). Results: No significant regional differences in gray and white matter could be detected between narcoleptics and controls, even with reduced thresholds and small volume corrections for the hypothalamus. Conclusion: No evidence is found for structural changes in the hypothalamic region. Either the hypothalamic changes are too subtle to be detected using VBM, or the hypocretin neurons remain intact but are not able to synthesize hypocretin.",

Before the acquisition, a test bolus of 16 ml of c.a. at 4 ml/s was performed. Real time interactive 3D evaluation was performed on a dedicated workstation. The degree of stenosis and the morphology of the plaque (qualitative and quantitative) were evaluated. In all patients DSA was also performed and considered the standard of reference. Results: Excellent image quality was obtained in all cases, without venous filling. Good correlation with DSA was achieved using the interactive 3D assessment. A perfect correlation between MSCTA and DSA regarding the degree of stenosis was seen in 42 carotids. In 3 carotids, with moderate stenosis at DSA, MSCTA showed a severe stenosis, due to the presence of calcification. The values of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were respectively 96 %, 82 % and 91 %. Regarding the morphology of the plaque, MSCTA correctly demonstrated all ulcerated plaques, also showing the presence, by means of quantitative assessment, of calcium, fibrous stroma and lipid. Conclusion: MSCTA surpasses all the limitations of single slice spiral CTA regarding venous overprojection and volume coverage. Real time 3D interaction is necessary to correctly demonstrate the degree of stenosis. MSCTA appears to be particularly valid in the assessment of plaque morphology and therefore in treatment planning.",

Overestimation was the most frequent error, even in the specimen comparison. There was one false positive for CEMRA and DopplerUS and one false negative for DSA, so the accuracy was the same at 89 %. Ulcers were most frequently seen at CEMRA. Conclusion: There was a significant correlation between CEMRA, DopplerUS and DSA for estimating the degree of stenosis with the same accuracy by comparing with specimen measurements. CE MRA was shown to be the best imaging modality to detect plaque ulceration.",

Passariello; Rome/IT Purpose: To compare multislice CT angiography (MSCTA) with contrast enhanced MR Angiography (MRA) in patients with suspected carotid artery stenosis. Material and methods: 23 patients with suspected carotid artery stenosis were examined with MSCTA and MRA using a 1.5 T magnet. MSCTA was performed after bolus administration of 80 ml of c.a. at 4 ml/s. Before the acquisition, a test bolus with 16 ml of c.a. at 4 ml/s was performed. CE-MRA was performed using a multiphase sequence after bolus administration of 15 ml of Gd-DTPA at 2 ml/s. A real time interactive 3D assessment of MSCTA images was performed in all cases, while MRA images were assessed using a standard MIP algorithm on the magnet console. The two techniques were compared for degree of stenosis and plaque morphology, using DSA as standard of reference. Results: With both techniques images were diagnostic and free from artifact. No significant difference between the two techniques, regarding the degree of stenosis, was seen; the values of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were respectively of 96, 100 and 97 % for both techniques. Qualitative assessment allowed us to correctly demonstrate the morphology of the plaque in all cases with CTA, while MRA correctly demonstrated 10 of 12 ulcerated plaques.",

Kuznetsov; Kiev/UA Purpose: Comparison of brain hemodynamics in patients with vertebral artery hypoplasia (VAH) comparing those with and without atherosclerotic lesions of the carotid arteries. Methods and materials: We examined 102 patients, 51 males and 51 females, mean age 51 \u00b1 15 years: (1) 58 patients without a history or signs of cerebrovascular diseases and without carotid stenosis: 31 with VAH (1A) and 27 without VAH (1B); (2) 44 patients with ischemic stroke caused by atherosclerotic lesions of the carotid arteries: 19 with VAH (2A) and 25 without VAH (2B). We used a sonography system \"Elegra\" (Siemens) to measure the vessel diameters, volume blood flow velocities (VF), total cerebral volume blood flow (TVF) -VF through both internal carotid arteries (VFICA) + VF through both VA (VFVA). Results: Group 1A had lower VFVA than 1B (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between TVF in these two groups. TVF in Group 2A (0.36 \u00b1 0.038 l/min) was lower compared with Group 2B (0.51 \u00b1 0.071 l/min, p < 0.001) resulting in a lower VFVA in Group 2A (0.028 \u00b1 0.087 l/min and 0.12 \u00b1 0.051 l/min respectively, p < 0.001). Gropp 2B versus 2A patients had a higher severity of arterial narrowing. Conclusions: Patients with VAH without stenotic lesions of the carotid arteries have brain hemodynamic compensation through the carotid arteries and contralateral vertebral artery. VAH in patients with cerebral atherosclerosis evokes decompensation of cerebral hemodynamics and causes ischemic stroke with a lower grade of carotid stenosis than in patients without VAH. Purpose: The aim of this work was to retrospectively evaluate with MRI, 45 patients affected by anterior knee pain without clinical symptoms of meniscal or ligamentous injuries. Materials and methods: 45 patients with anterior knee pain entered this study. MR examination was performed using 0.2 T dedicated and 1.5 T whole body MR units. In 5 cases dedicated MR unit was performed to have kinematic evaluation of the knee at three different degrees of flexion. In 25 cases i.v. injection of contrast media was performed. All the patients underwent arthroscopy. Results: In all the cases MRI revealed a region of altered signal intensity in the superior aspect of the Hoffa's body. Arthroscopy revealed the presence of synovial thickening in 25 cases and enlargement of the patello-femoral synovial recess in 20 cases. In 14 cases of synovial thickening infusion MRI showed in 8 cases contrast enhancement suggesting an acute stage of inflammation and in 5 cases no enhancement was found due to the presence of synovial fibrous tissue. In 9 cases of histologically proved villonodular synovitis SE T2W sequences showed a region of non homogeneous high signal intensity because of the presence of spots of low signal intensity. In all the 5 patients showing synovial thickening of the Hoffa's body apex, kinematic MR revealed impingement with the femoro-patellar joint. Conclusion: Our experience demonstrates that MRI, eventually completed by kinematic study and/or infusion of contrast media, may be considered the method of choice in the evaluation of the synovial impingement of the knee.",

Conclusion: Dual-detector spiral CT arthrography of the knee is an accurate method for detecting unstable meniscal tears among postoperative menisci. Purpose: To analyze MR-pathology of the knee joint at different stages of osteoarthritis and to find out whether pain, stiffness and limited function assessed clinically correlate with the degree of pathology assessed on MR images and radiographs. Material and methods: The study population consisted of 50 patients with varying degrees of osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis was graded clinically using the WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster University) score and on the basis of conventional radiographs using the standard KL (Kellgren-Lawrence) score. In addition MR imaging was performed at 1.5 T using a high-resolution fat-suppressed, spoiled gradient echo sequence, T2-weighted fat suppressed fast spin echo sequences and T1-weighted spin echo sequences. All images were analyzed by two readers concerning cartilage lesions, bone marrow edema and pathology of the ligaments and menisci. These findings were correlated with the clinical and the radiological score. Results: 13/16 joints with a KL-score of 4 showed full thickness cartilage lesions and bone marrow edema. Meniscal tears were found in all joints with KL-score 4. Cruciate ligament pathology was found in 5/13 KL-score 3 and 9/16 KL-score 4 joints. The KL-score correlated well with the extent of MR-pathology. Correlations between the extent of cartilage damage, bone marrow edema and the KL-score versus the WOMAC-score were non-significant (p > 0.05). Conclusion: A high percentage of meniscal and ligamentous pathology, bone marrow edema and severe cartilage lesions could be shown in advanced osteoarthritis. However, a significant correlation between clinical findings and the extent of MR-and X-ray pathology could not be demonstrated. Purpose: Evaluation of real-time MRI in the assessment of velopharyngeal closure in comparison to videofluoroscopy. Materials and methods: 1 healthy volunteer and 7 patients with suspected velopharyngeal insufficiency (age from 5 -19 years, mean 9 years) underwent videofluoroscopy and real-time MRI, using a TSE \"zoom\" sequence (TR = 170 ms, TE = 21 ms, slice thickness 6 mm) with 6 images per second. Images were acquired in the midsagittal, the coronal and axial plane at the level of maximal velopharyngeal closure during phonation of test words. Results were analysed by 2 radiologists in comparison to videofluoroscopy as the standard of reference concerning overall quality of the depiction of the velopharyngeal isthmus and the pattern of velopharyngeal closure in all three image planes. Results: In all cases, real-time MRI could correctly depict the pattern of velopharyngeal closure in correspondence to videofluoroscopy: velopharyngeal insufficiency with wide open velopharyngeal portal (n = 2), with moderate open velopharyngeal portal (n = 1), close approximation of the velum (n = 1) and velum touching the dorsal phayryngeal wall (n = 3). In 3 cases, the coronal plane was not of diagnostic quality in MRI due to motion-artefacts. In one case, MRI showed an asymmetric movement of the pharyngeal walls which could not be seen in videofluoroscopy.",

Anterior translation of cerebellar tonsils was noticed. Discussion: Many authors have studied obstructive SAS which was partially explicated by laryngo-pharyngeal abnormalities. Associated transient ischemic attacks are well known. Our study suggested that abnormalities of brainstem may alter the function of respiratory nuclei and tracks and that brainstem abnormalities may be linked with sleep apnea syndrome. Conclusion: Sleep apnea syndrome may be associated with lesions of brainstem. Further larger study should be done to prove a statistical correlation. However radiologists should look for posterior fossa abnormalities when exploring patients referred for sleep apnea syndrome.",

Baumgartner, D. Hahn; W\u00fcrzburg/DE Purpose: Unlike in the investigation of esophageal perforation, the more radiopaque barium-suspensions are not as important as iodinated aqueous contrast agents for the detection of pharyngeal perforations. This study was performed to find out whether the highly different viscosities (of iodinated and barium-containing contrast agents with comparable radiopacities) are a reason for this. Methods: Viscosity, subjective difference in contrast, and CT-density of an iodinated aqueous (Telebrix) and a 50 wt/vol% barium-containing contrast agent (Micropaque) were determined. Moreover, to exclude postoperative perforation, 104 patients were prospectively examined by pharyngography using both contrast media. Pharyngographies of patients with perforation were later compared by two independent readers. All patients with perforation were followed up clinically to exclude complications due to barium-application. Results: In-vitro comparison showed comparable radiopacity but the 50 wt/vol% barium-suspension was much more viscous than the iodinated contrast agent. In total, during pharyngography, 14 perforations were clearly delineated with the iodinated aqueous contrast agent. However, two of them were not detected with the barium-suspension. All the other perforations presented equally. Conclusions: Given a sufficient radiopacity, a low viscosity appears to be essential for a contrast agent to detect pharyngeal perforation. Thus, we recommend the sole use of an iodinated contrast agent (if suspicion of aspiration as isoosmolar variant) for this purpose.",

Results: Chemodectomas were revealed in 23 pts, neurinomas in 8 pts and carotid arteries aneurysms in 11 pts. Among 23 chemodectomas there were 19 carotid and 4 vagal tumours. The analysis of data revealed that chemodectomas were characterised with early (arterial phase) pronounced (up to 200 HU) contrast enhancement. Sometimes a low density area can be seen in center of the lesion. Neurinomas are characterized with less pronounced enhancement (up to 100 HU). \"Spots\" and \"stripes\" of the contrasted vessels stand out against parenchyma in neurinomas. There was no significant difference (p < 0.01) of average density rates in arterial phase in chemodectomas (171.2 \u00b1 45.8 HU) and in neurinomas (64 \u00b1 26 HU). There was a simultaneous contrast enhancement both in aneurysm and in surrounding vessels. Additional information valuable for differential diagnosis was not obtained in venous and delayed phases. Simultaneous enhancement of tumor and carotid arteries gives the possibility of evaluat Ing their relationship and the involvement of carotid arteries in pathological processes. Conclusion: Spiral CT with bolus contrast enhancement allows differentiation of tumors and other pathological masses of the carotid space and allows a 3D-image of the area of interest to be obtained for surgery planning.",

Bigot; Paris/FR Purpose: To improve early diagnosis of an under recognized cause of cervical pain and stiffness whose initial misdiagnosis can lead to parenteral administration of antibiotics or even open biopsy Materials and methods: Two patients (1 male, 33 a; 1 female: 47 a) were admitted to the hospital with dysphagia, severe neck discomfort and fever. Lateral radiographs of the cervical spine were performed in 2 patients, computed tomography in 2 and MRI in 1. Using non-steroidal anti inflammatory medications (interruption of antibiotics), the two patients had complete resolution of the symptoms within one week Results: The calcification of the prevertebral muscle was demonstrated by CT for 2 patients and identified on lateral radiography in one case only. The soft tissue swelling was seen both on CT and MRI. Conclusion: Acute calcific tendinitis is an under recognized disease which can be initially misdiagnosed as retropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal abscess, leading to unecessary parenteral injection of antibiotics or even biopsy. The radiologist has an important role to ensure the definitive diagnosis: in our 2 cases, specific imaging led to the correct diagnosis. To test the hypothesis that the single testicular artery is low resistance, and two further arteries (cremasteric/differential) are high resistance, we examined the spermatic cord vessels in a cohort of healthy men. Materials and methods: Patients presenting for a scrotal US with normal testes and epididymis were recruited. The right and left spermatic cords were examined from the superior aspect of the testis to the external inguinal ring to locate the testicular, cremasteric and differential arteries. A 15L8w multifrequency (8 -13 MHz) linear array probe (Acuson CA) identifed each artery as separate, allowing a spectral Doppler waveform to be recorded. The resistive index (RI) from each artery was measured three times (right and left) and the mean calculated. The three arteries were labelled A (lowest RI) B and C (two higher RI). Results: 51 patients (median age 39 a, range 18 -79 a) were examined. The RI's on the right were: A: 0.71 \u00b1 0.05, B: 0.82 \u00b1 0.05, C: 0.84 \u00b1 0.04 and the left A: 0.70 \u00b1 0.06, B: 0.84 \u00b1 0.04, C: 0.83 \u00b1 0.05. A paired t-test demonstrated a significant difference of the combined right and left measurements for AvsB (p < 0.001) and AvsC (p < 0.001) but not BvsC (p = 0.3). Conclusion: Although it is not possible to identify a named artery in the spermatic cord, consistently one artery has a significantly lower RI than the other two arteries. This finding may be useful as an adjuvant parameter in the assessment of scrotal pathology in particular with patients with spermatic cord torsion.",

Ribatti; Rome/IT Scrotal varicocele (SV) is a very common disease of the male population. Presently, colour Doppler ultrasonography (CDUS) represents the most frequently adopted technique for confirming the clinical diagnosis of SV and for a treatment indication. Despite for several years CDUS has been clinically used in cases of SV, discriminating quantitative values are not reported in medical literature. This is at least partly due to the lack of studies of CDUS patterns obtained from large populations of healthy subjects. The aim of this paper is to investigate the role of ECD in instrumental diagnosis of male varicocele, the implications in selecting the patients who require treatment, and to investigate the risk of SV overdiagnosis by adopting the qualitative criteria currently used. We prospectively examined by CDUS a population of 150 healthy and symptomless subjects, with a negative clinical examination for varicocele, and a normal spermiogram. We found that the normal value range of the maximum diameter of scrotal veins (2.62 \u00b1 0.53 mm) widely overlaps with the values currently accepted for a varicocele diagnosis (1.5 -3.0 mm). Furthermore, a venous reflux, a criteria adopted also for the diagnosis of subclinical varicocele, was present in 53 % of the normal population. These data show that there is a risk of SV overdiagnosis by using CDUS. The quantitative criteria for SV diagnosis should be re-examined. The patients group included 10 UVJs with grade I -II and 5 UVJs with grade III -IV of reflux. Urethra-to-orifice distance (UOD) and length of intravesical and submucosal parts of the ureter were measured. Results: In normal cases ureteral orifices were situated on equal distances from urethra, the UOD was 11.2 \u00b1 2.8 mm (mean \u00b1 SD). The length of intravesical part of the ureter was 24.9 \u00b1 6.6 mm and correlated with height (correlation coefficient 0.78), body surface area (0.73) and weight (0.66). The length of submucosal part of the ureter was 12.6 \u00b1 3.1 mm and correlated with body surface area (0.85), weight (0.83) and height (0.82). The ratio between intravesical and submucosal parts of the ureter was 1.95 \u00b1 0.3. There was no significant difference between the normal values and values of all 10 low-grade reflux UVJs. In 4 from 10 spontaneous resolution of the reflux during 1-year period was found. The grade III -IV reflux orifices (5 UVJs) were situated farther from urethra than opposite normal orifices, the UOD was 14.2 \u00b1 2.5 mm. The intravesical part of the ureter was short (9 \u00b1 2.1 mm) and submucosal part was absent in all cases. None high-grade reflux was resolved spontaneously. Conclusion: Ultrasonography is a valuable noninvasive method of examination of UVJs and may be useful in vesicoureteric reflux assessment.",

Subsequently, a second examiner performed 10 systematic biopsies of the prostate. Cancer detection rates for the two techniques were compared. Results: Cancer was detected in 69/230 subjects (30 %). Cancer was detected in 56/230 subjects (24.4 %) by contrast-enhanced targeted biopsy, and in 51/230 patients (22.2 %) with systematic biopsy. Cancer was detected with targeted biopsy alone in 17 subjects, and with systematic biopsy alone in 13 subjects. Overall cancer detection rate was not significantly different for targeted and systematic biopsy (p = 0.53). The detection rate of targeted biopsy cores (118/1139) was significantly better than that of systematic biopsy cores (123/2300) (p < 0.001). Targeted biopsy in a patient with cancer is 2.6 times more likely to detect prostate cancer than a systematic biopsy. Conclusions: Contrast-enhanced CDUS targeted biopsy detected as many cancers as systematic biopsy with fewer than half the number of biopsy cores. Although an increase in cancer detection rate is obtained by combining targeted and systematic techniques in this screening population, contrast-enhanced targeted biopsy alone is a reasonable approach to reduce the number of biopsy cores.",

B-0094 10:55 Tissue harmonic imaging in the evaluation of thyroid nodules. Initial experience K.T. Szopinski, M. Wysocki, A. Pajk, R. Slapa, W. Jakubowski, E. Bialek; Warsaw/PL Purpose: To determine whether tissue harmonic imaging improves resolution between thyroid nodules and the adjacent thyroid parenchyma. Materials and methods: 50 thyroid nodules (1 malignant, 49 benign) in 45 patients (40 female, 5 male, age 20 -79, mean 49.3) referred for a fine needle biopsy were evaluated. The lesions were imaged using fundamental frequency and tissue harmonic imaging (THI) on a Siemens Sonoline Elegra machine using a wide-band linear 7.5 (5.1 -9.0) MHz transducer. Eight nodules were hyperechoic, 10 isoechoic, and 32 hypoechoic. The digital images were transferred to a PC, where the gray scale intensity of the nodule (IN) and adjacent parenchyma (IP) were measured using Adobe Photoshop software. The ratios IN/IP and |(IN -IP)|/IP were calculated. Results: The grayscale contrast was improved in 32 nodules, diminished in 18 nodules. The contrast change defined as |(IN \u2212 IP)|/IP was statistically significant p < 0.03. In 3 cases isoechoic parts of nodules became hypoechoic on the THI images. The definition of the nodule contour was improved in 26 nodules. Conclusion: THI may improve the definition of the nodule contour as well as the gray-scale contrast between thyroid nodules and adjacent thyroid parenchyma.

Lee; Seoul/KR Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy of MR cholangiography in assessing the extent of hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Materials and methods: From January 1999 to August 2000, heavily T2-weighted thick-section (RARE) and thin-section (HASTE) MR cholangiography were performed on 89 patients with pathologically proven hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Hilar cholangiocarcinoma were proven by means of surgery (n = 17) or percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopic guided biopsy (n = 72). All MR images were retrospectively analysed by two radiologists to assess the tumor extent (Bismuth classification). MR cholagiographic findings were compared with findings on surgery or percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy. Result: The sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of MR cholangiography in determining the bile duct extent of hilar cholangiocarcinoma were 73.3 %, 93.3 %, and 89.8 %, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of each Bismuth type were as the followings: type I (n = 13) of 92 %, 95 %, and 94 %, respectively; type II (n = 22) of 63 %, 95 %, and 88 %, respectively; type IIIa (n = 12) of 83 %, 83 %, and 87 %, respectively; type IIIb (n = 24) of 58 %, 99 %, and 88 %, respectively; type IV (n = 18) of 89 %, 92 %, and 91 %, respectively. Conclusion: Although MR cholangiography tends to underestimate the bile duct extent of hilar cholangiocarcinoma, MR cholangiography may play as effective diagnostic modality as one of preoperative diagnostic modalities of hilar cholangiocarcinoma.

Schmidt, C. Hohl, M. Blaum, G. Staatz, J.M.A. Meyer, D. Honnef, R.W. G\u00fcnther; Aachen/DE Purpose: To evaluate if PTHI improves detection and characterization of focal kidney lesions in comparison to FI. Materials and methods: In a prospective study, 72 patients underwent both PTHI and FI ultrasound examinations in a randomly chosen order. Crucial technical parameters were standardized. Focal renal lesions (cystic and solid tumours, perirenal fluid collections) were documented regarding size, localization and ultrasound diagnosis. The ultrasound diagnoses were compared to the final diagnoses based on CT, MRI or surgery. Additionally, three radiologists evaluated overall image quality, delineation of image details and fluid-solid differentiation using a 3 point grading scheme. Results: PTHI provided significantly better overall image quality, delineation of image details and differentiation between fluid and solid structures compared to FI. 108 of 130 focal kidney lesions were detected by PTHI and were correctly diagnosed in 102 cases. 49 of 55 kidneys without focal pathology were correctly evaluated by PTHI (sensitivity: 83.1 %, accuracy: 78.5 %, specificity: 89.1 %). FI detected 81 of 130 and correctly diagnosed 75 lesions. It correctly characterized 47 of 55 kidneys without focal pathology (sensitivity: 61.8 %, accuracy: 57.7 %, specificity: 85.5 %). Conclusion: PTHI offers better fluid-solid differentiation, better overall image quality and an improved delineation of image details when compared to FI.

Stonebridge, J.B.C. Dick, D.G. Sheppard; Dundee/GB Purpose: To evaluate the relationship of aortic blood flow patterns with renal function in renal artery stenosis. Methods and materials: 86 patients with chronic renal failure, were studied (1.5 T MRI unit) with phased array torso coil. ECG gated flow quantitation sequences in the coronal oblique plane and 3-dimensional contrast enhanced MR Angiography (Gd 0.15 mmol/kg) were performed. Renal arterial stenoses were classified as unilateral or bilateral, mild (30 -60 %) or severe (> 60 %). Renal function was followed at 6 months pre-and up to 12 months post-MRI. Results: 33 patients (20 male, 13 female) demonstrated significant renal artery stenoses greater than 60 %. Of these, 14 patients demonstrated aortic spiral blood flow and 19 patients did not. At follow-up 16 (48 %) patients showed significant short term deterioration in renal function. Of those with spiral flow, 4 of 14 (28 %) patients showed a deterioration of renal function with a mean creatinine rise of 55 \u00b5mol/l, while 12 of 19 (63 %) patients without spiral flow showed significant renal function deterioration with a mean creatinine rise of 102 \u00b5mol/l. These rises in creatinine were significantly different (p = 0.048). Conclusions: Spiral aortic blood flow patterns can be observed with MRI. There is variation in the prevalence of spiral flow in renal artery stenosis. Lack of spiral flow is associated with a significantly increased deterioration in renal function compared with patients with spiral aortic flow.

Materials and method: This double blind prospective study included 24 patients with endoscopically proven laryngeal cancer. Patients underwent spiral CT during IV infusion of contrast material according to our standard protocol for upper airway. This same set of axial scans was tranferred to a dedicated workstation to obtain VE images. Results of VE were compared to the findings of flexible endoscopy. Results: Exam quality was good in 23 of 24 patients (96 %). VE identified all vegetating lesions: two small flat lesions could be observed as slightly enhanced plaques only on the axial scans. Subglottic extension was correctly depicted in all cases by associating VE to the axial scans. Furthermore VE allowed evaluation of anatomical relations between pathological tissue and laryngeal ventricle and valleculae. Conclusion: VE shows high sensitivity in the identification of vegetating lesions of the larynx and, in adjunct to the axial scans, can establish relations of cancer with nearby structures. The imaging modality shows some advantages as it can be performed in the presence of severe stenosis that can not be by-passed by the fiberscope, does not require sedation and additional scanning. On the other hand VE show limits in the identification of flat lesions and does not allow biopsies and functional imaging to be performed.

Hamm; Berlin/DEPurpose: To assess volumes and function of both ventricles in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) before and after partial left ventriculectomy (PLV). Material and methods: 23 patients with end-stage CHF underwent electron beam tomography before, within 2 months (Post1), and 6 months or more (Post2) after PLV. Imaging was carried out in the short axis (50 ms per scan). Enddiastolic and endsystolic tracing of endocardial borders of both ventricles was carried out in a blinded fashion. Pre-and postoperative left and right ventricular enddiastolic volume (LVEDV, RVEDV), endsystolic volume (LVESV, RVESV), ejection fraction (LVEF, RVEF), and enddiastolic diameter (LVEDD, RVEDD) were determined.

Hanan; Chicago, IL/US Purpose: Define and assess the value of an atypical intestinal configuration observed during enteroclysis in symptomatic patients suspected of partial small bowel obstruction. Methods and materials: Over the last five years double contrast enteroclysis (DCE) was performed in 84 patients presenting with recurrent focalized painful abdominal distention but minimal radiologic evidence of intestinal obstruction. All patients had a history of previous abdominal surgical intervention (open or laparoscopic). An atypical radiographic finding involving a loop or cluster of small bowel was subsequently correlated with post-surgical reports for confirmation.Results: In all phases of a DCE a fixed, aberrantly located, loop (or focal cluster of loops) of small bowel was observed in five patients. The loop was atypically situated relative to the conventional gross zonal distribution of the intestinal aggregate. All of the fixed, aberrantly positioned loops were in close proximity to abdominal surgical scars, as well as indicated sites of pain occurring mostly on abdominal distention. In all patients, lapratomic or laporoscopic follow-up confirmed adhesive peritoneal attachment of bowel at sites identified by DCE without evidence of flow-dynamically significant obstruction. Postoperatively all patients were symptom free. Conclusion: Demonstration and recognition of a fixed, aberrantly positioned loop (or cluster) of small bowel during enteroclysis in painfully symptomatic patients is a rare but diagnostically valuable sign for identifying clinically significant non-obstructive intestinal adhesions.",

M\u00f6dder; D\u00fcsseldorf/DEPurpose: Enzyme-replacement-therapy (ERT) arrests and reverses the hematological and visceral symptoms of adult Gaucher disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the features of bone marrow (bm) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in these patients during ERT. Methods and materials: MR investigations were performed prospectively in 30 adult type I Gaucher patients before and during ERT with a mean follow-up of 3 years. Spin-Echo-sequences (T1/T2) of the lower extremities were obtained and reconversion (response) or lack of reconversion (non-response) to fatty marrow during treatment was analyzed. The morphological features of bm involvement, a homogeneous (type A) or non-homogeneous (type B) distribution of bm changes and focal bone lesions surrounded by a rim of reduced signal intensity (SI), were analyzed. Results: Overall, 19 of 30 patients (63 %) showed an increased signal intensity on T1-and T2-weighted images after 36 months of ERT, consistent with partial reconversion of fatty marrow during treatment. Focal bone lesions surrounded by a low signal intensity (SI) rim did not respond to ERT, suggesting bone infarcts. Out of the 11 patients with bone infarcts (low SI rim lesions), 82 % demonstrated the non-homogeneous type B pattern (p = 0.0021). In 86 % of patients with splenectomy, bone infarcts were seen (p < 0.05). Conclusion: In adult patients with type I Gaucher disease receiving ERT, treatment effects on bone disease can be demonstrated by MRI using Spin-Echosequences due to partial reconversion of fat marrow. A non-homogeneous signalintensity of bone marrow involvement and a status post-splenectomy correlated with the presence of bone infarcts.B-0461 11:45MR-characteristics of osteoradionecrosis of the pelvis in patients with gynaecological tumors after irradiation J.

Materials and methods: 41 patients who underwent MR imaging of the knee joint prior to arthroscopy were evaluated retrospectively. MR imaging was performed on a 1.0 T system (Magnetom Expert, Siemens) and included a 3D DESS sequence with a water-selective excitation pulse (TR = 25.7 ms, TE = 9 ms, FA = 40\u00b0, section thickness 1.5 mm, FOV = 16 cm, matrix size 256 \u00d7 256). The images were evaluated by two radiologists with agreement by consensus, and the results were compared with arthroscopic findings in 232 cartilage sites. Results: Arthroscopy revealed 82 cartilage lesions: four were classified as grade 1, 19 as grade 2, 41 as grade 3, and 16 as grade 4. In the detection of grades 1 and 2 lesions MR imaging had a sensitivity of 60 % and a specificity 96 %. Surface lesions grades 3 and 4 were diagnosed with a sensitivity of 96 % and a specificity of 96 %. The overall sensitivity and specificity were 77 % and 90 %, respectively. Lesions were graded identical to arthroscopy in 80 % of the cases. Conclusion: Water-excited 3D DESS MR imaging provides excellent identification of grades 3 and 4 articular cartilage lesions but appears to be of limited value in the diagnosis of earlier stages of chondromalacia.",

Natale 2 , G.M. Pohost 1 ; 1 Birmingham, AL/US, 2 Rome/IT Background: X-ray cineangiography has been considered the gold standard for imaging of coronary arteries, but it often does not delineate their proximal course in relation to the aorta or pulmonary artery (PA). Preliminary data indicates coronary magnetic resonance angiography (MRCA) as an effective tool in defining origin and proximal course of these arteries. We compared the accuracy of MRCA to X-ray angiography or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in 16 consecutive patients referred with a diagnosis of anomalous coronary artery. Methods: Patients underwent CMRA on a 1.5 T scanner (Signa CV/i; GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) After scout images, location of the aortic root and pulmonary artery (PA) was identified by means of axial T1w spin echo sequence; MRCA was performed by 2D cardiac-gated, fat suppressed, breath-held, segmented fast gradient echo images (TR/TE/flip angle 12/4/20\u00b0, slice thickness 4 mm), using axial and obliques planes. Results: MRCA images were reviewed and compared with X-ray angiography or TEE; consensus was reached regarding the exact origin and course. MRCA independently delineated origin and proximal course of the coronary vessels in all 16 patients. Coronary anomalies diagnosed by MRCA included right sided origin of LCA (n = 7), right sided origin of CLX (n = 2), slight anterior or posterior displacement of LCA (n = 2), left sided origin of RCA (n = 3), anterior displacement of RCA (n = 1), common ostium of LCA and RCA (n = 1). Conclusion: In this series, MRCA correctly identified every anomaly. This degree of accuracy qualifies MRCA as the imaging modality of choice for assessing coronary anomalies.B-0485 11:10Fast contrast-enhanced 3D MR angiography of coronary arteries: Visible length, detection of stenosis, rare indication, and limitations G.F. Bachmann, T. Dill, A. Kluge, C. Breidenbach, C. M\u00fcller, C. Hamm; Bad Nauheim/DE Purpose: Contrast-enhanced (ce) fast 3D sequences permit visualisation of coronary arteries and detection of stenosis within one breath-hold. We want to present our experience in 130 patients with coronary artery disease. Methods: 130 patients were examined on a 1.5 T unit (Sonata, Siemens) using a 3D FLASH sequence (TR 108 ms, TE 1.51 ms, flip angle 20\u00b0, 16 partitions, pixel size 1.5 -1.9 \u00d7 1.2 mm). Native 3D slaps in breath-hold without inversion pulse were used for individual adaptation of each slap on the course of the three main coronary arteries. Finally contrast medium and an inversion pulse (260 ms) was administered to improve vascular contrast. Compared to catheter angiography each coronary artery (RCA, RCX, LAD) was judged according to visible length, detectability of stenosis and limitations. Results: Visibility of coronary arteries was 16 cm for RCA, 14 cm for LAD and only 6 cm for RCX. Side branches over 2 cm were defined in 100 % for RCA, 87 % for LAD and 34 % for RCX. Severe stenosis (> 70 %) of the proximal coronary arteries were detected with a sensitivity of 78 % (RCA), 72 % (LAD) and 62 % (RCX). Rare indications for MR angiography include aneurysm, acute thrombotic occlusion and variants of origin and course. The benefit of fast ce 3D sequences in breath-hold are reduced acquisition time and motion artefacts permitting accurate diagnosis of proximal coronary artery stenosis. The limitations result from reduced spatial resolution which hamper visualisation of side branches and peripheral vasculature.B-0486 11:20Radiation exposure by multislice CT and electron beam CT in coronary artery imaging P.

P\u00e4rtan, A. Maltsidis, W. Hruby; Vienna/AT Purpose: To present the clinical results of integrating healthcare information by automatic transfer of exposure dose parameters from imaging devices into the electronic patient record.Methods: Due to an inhouse development in the filmless radiology department of a 1000-bed hospital, dose area product for Fluro-and Radiography, and Dose Length product for CT are automatically recorded and transfered into the radiology information system. Results: So far the coupling of imaging modalities with the RIS has been successfully tested in clinical operation with 3000 fluroscopic examinations on 3 different devices. Depending if dose parameters are included in the DICOM header or not, two solutions have been developed. When included, PACS and RIS communicate via their common database. If data are not contained in the DICOM header, the ionization chamber is connected to the RIS by a data cable (serial RS232 interface). A background process records and stores all incoming data in a communication file. The results show that due to this coupling the technicians and radiologists become much more aware of the quality assurance and the optimization of radiological exams. Conclusion: The automatic coupling of exposure dose parameters with the electronic patient record is an important step in the integration of healthcare information. It (1) fullfills the requirements of the EURATOM directive 97/43 of the European Union in regard to medical radiation protection, (2) increases the awareness of technicians and radiologists for dose and exam optimization, and is (3) part of a quality assurance program of a radiology department.B-0502 10:40Methodology and outcome of the multi-step evaluation of providers for a multi-hospital PACS project O.

We present a multi-step evaluation procedure worked out for a large PACS project in the greater area of Zurich. Methods and materials: 3 major public hospitals decided to launch a joint PACS project -TriPACS -in November 1999. Evaluation consisted of 3 major steps:(1) Pre-qualification. (2) Evaluation of qualified vendors in 6 sub-steps: (2.1) Matching the \"Request for proposal\" (RFP, 25 %), (2.2) Price/effectiveness (25 %), (2.3) Symposium presentations, (2.4) PACS hands-on workshops, (2.5) Reference site visits (2.3. -2.5. together 25 %), (2.6) Integration into the existing environment (25 %). (3) Preliminary project: Evaluation will result in the qualification of one vendor for a preliminary project consisting of a mini-PACS installation. This includes the connection of 3 imaging modalities in every hospital, with full integration of the image distribution software into the electronic patient records of the three hospitals. Results: 32 companies requested the questionnaire for pre-qualification after the official announcement. 16 companies returned the questionnaire and 6 companies qualified for further evaluation: Agfa (Mortsel, Belgium), General Electric (Milwaukee, USA), Image Devices (Taunusstein, Germany), Philips (Netherlands), Siemens (Erlangen, Germany), Fuji (D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany). FUJI decided not to take part in the further evaluation. For legal reasons, the rating of the qualified vendors (major step 2) cannot be published before November 2001.

Heindel; M\u00fcnster/DEPurpose: To evaluate the imaging characteristics of various iliac artery stents in a multislice CT angiography (MSCTA) phantom study. Methods: Fifteen stents made of different materials (steel, nitinol, tantalum, cobalt alloy) were implanted in plastic tubes with an 8 mm inner diameter filled with iodinated contrast medium diluted to 200 HU. To evaluate the influence of scan parameters on artifacts the Palmaz stent as one example was scanned using a four slice scanner (Siemens VolumeZoom) with different detector collimations and pitches. All other stents were examined with a collimation of 4 \u00d7 1 mm and a table feed of 4 mm/rotation. Axial images and multiplanar reformations were evaluated regarding artifact size, lumen visibility and intraluminal attenuation values. Results: Higher pitch values caused more pronounced artifacts. Image quality and delineation of the stent struts improved with thinner detector collimation. The size of the stent related artifacts and the visibility of the stent lumen depended on the underlying stent material and design. Pronounced artifacts, resulting in an insufficient delineation of the stent lumen, were caused by the Strecker tantalum stent and the Zenith stent. Medium artifacts were caused by the Wallgraft, Passager, Bridge and ZA-stent. Some artificial lumen narrowing, but good lumen delineation was seen with: Strecker nitinol, Symphony, Memotherm, SMART, Corinthian and Wallstent. Conclusions: Scanning parameters, stent material and stent design influence lumen assesibility and image quality in MSCTA. Detailed lumen assessment is impossible in the Strecker tantal and Zenith stent, limited in the Wallgraft, Passager, Bridge and ZA-stent but feasible in all other examined products.B-0513 10:40 A new balloon-expandable active magnetic resonance imaging stent (AMRIS): In vivo results using MR angiography and flow measurements with local signal amplification D.E.

Material and methods: The module is controlled by an arbitrary function generator. The shape of the flow profile is generated on the PC with mathematical functions or drawn by hand. The amplified signal drives a strong DC motor which drives a magnet-coupled gear pumphead. The mechanical decoupling ensures a quiet running and a complete attenuation of vibrations caused by the motor and a disturbance-free flow profile. The spectra were analyzed dopplersonographically with a 12 MHz linear probe and with pressure sensors. Silicon tubes were used as vessel simulation and a water glycerine mixture with particles of cellulosis as simulated blood. Results: The generated flow patterns (constant flow and multi phase patterns) correlate highly with the measured pressure and velocity profiles. Conclusion: The variability and high reproducibility of the flow profiles and the real time control of the signal parameters suggest it is possible to simulate the dynamic processes and carry out hemodynamic longtime studies.

Methods and materials: Between June 1993 and August 2001 a total of 10692 laser applications were performed in 2629 lesions in 943 consecutive patients with a total of 2207 treatment sessions. The complications of the procedure were evaluated by clinical examination and MR/CT imaging. The local tumor control was evaluated by plain and contrast enhanced follow-up scans using T1 and T2 weighted SE and GRE sequences every 3 months after the treatment. Results: The overall rate of complications and side effects was 8.0 %. The rate of clinically relevant complications was 1.1 %. The most common side effect of LITT treatment was a reactive pleural effusion (7.9 %), drainage was necessary in 0.8 %. Intrahepatic abscess were observed in 0.7 % and one pleura empyema in 0.1 %, both treated by drainage. An subcapsular hematoma was found in 3.2 %, intrahepatic bleeding in 0.1 % and intrabdominal bleeding in 0.2 %. All required no further treatment. Further complications: local infection in 0.3 % and injury to bile duct in 0.1 %. Three patients died within 30 days, however only one was possible LITT related. Conclusion: In patients with liver tumors, local tumor destruction using minimally invasive percutaneous MR-guided LITT is a safe therapy method with a very low complication rate.

Material and methods: Seven anaesthetized ewes with singleton fetuses, three with and four without surgical tracheal occlusion, underwent MR imaging using True FISP sequences in a coronal and transversal orientation at 1.5 T. MR imaging was performed 1 -4 times in intervals of 1 -2 weeks between 92 and 141 gestational days. The estimated MR FLV were compared with FLV measurements obtained at post mortem examination. MR FLV in foetuses with and without tracheal occlusion were correlated with the time after surgery. Results: FLV in foetuses with tracheal occlusion increased more with gestational age than in control foetuses (18.0 ml/d, ci 95: 8.2 -27.8; 3.5 ml/d, ci 95: 1.1 -6.0 respectively). No differences in lung volume determination based on coronal or transverse MR images were observed (r = 0.99; slope 1.0). The calculated FLV's on MRI and post mortem examinations showed a high correlation (r 2 = 0.9). However, FLV measured by MRI was approximately 50 ml higher than in post mortem examinations. Conclusion: MRI is accurate in the determination of FLV. Higher lung volumes in MRI may be partly explained with fluid loss in post mortem examinations. MRI allows measurement of lung volume development in foetal sheep with tracheal occlusion.Haemorrhage after percutaneous renal surgery: treatment by transcatheter embolisation C. Vignali, R. Cioni, P. Petruzzi, I. Bargellini, A. Cicorelli, S. Lonzi, C. Bartolozzi; Pisa/IT Purpose: Percutaneous renal surgery has become the standard technique for a number of renal pathologies. Haemorrhage and vascular lesions are the most serious complications. We report our experience with 14 patients treated by selective embolisation performed between 1993 and 2001. Material and methods: Fourteen patients (9 males and 5 females) with a mean age of 58 years had severe peri-operative haemorrhage after percutaneous renal surgery (mean time to onset: 15 days), due to major renal arterial injury, presented by arteriovenous fistulae (n = 6) and pseudoaneurysms (n = 8). Four patients showed transient renal disfunction, with an increase in serum creatinine levels. One patient had a solitary transplanted kidney. Results: Renal arteriography was performed, followed by hyperselective arterial embolisation, obtaining a successful control of the renal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage, in all cases. Renal function was unaffected in all 10 patients with normal serum creatinine level and normalized in the other 4 patients with transient renal failure. No major complications occurred after the procedure. Conclusion: Renal arterial haemorrhage following percutaneous surgery is a rare but severe complication. Selective renal artery embolisation, with either particles or coils, represents the first-choice treatment option, being safe and effective in solving the bleeding.B-0542 10:40 Duplex resistive index: Is it a valuable tool in predicting the outcome of percutaneous treatment of renal artery stenosis?

Genant 1 ; 1 San Francisco, CA/US, 2 Menlo Park, CA/US Purpose: This study investigated the MR imaging findings in ankles with an impingement syndrome of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis. Subjects and methods: 22 ankles with chronic pain and delayed recovery after a supination and external rotation trauma were examined by MR imaging. The soft tissue, ligamentous and osseous structures of the ankle joint were evaluated. Arthroscopy was subsequently performed in all patients and correlated with MR imaging findings. Results: In patients with syndesmotic impingement, MR imaging showed thickened and scarred syndesmotic ligaments with intermediate to low signal intensity on T1 and T2-weighted images. Out of 22 ankles, MR imaging identified soft tissue impingement due to posttraumatic granulation and scar tissue around 15 anterior tibiofibular, 9 interosseous tibiofibular and 5 posterior tibiofbular ligaments. In addition, MR imaging identified findings such as osteochondral lesions, loose bodies, bony spurs, cysts, fractures of the fibula or tibia and sprains of the syndesmotic and collateral ligaments. Conclusion: MR imaging has the capablity to identify posttraumatic alterations of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis related with symptomatic soft tissue impingement and thus may provide the referring physician with important information regarding the management of these patients.

Weishaupt, K. Treiber, H.-P. Kundert, J.K. Willmann, H. Zollinger, P. Vienne, J. Hodler, B. Marincek, M. Zanetti; Z\u00fcrich/CH Purpose: To assess the effect of prone, supine, and upright weight-bearing body positions on visibility, position, shape and size of Morton neuroma during MR imaging. Materials and methods: 18 patients with a total of 20 Morton neuromas underwent MR imaging of the forefoot in the prone, supine and upright weight-bearing positions. Visibility, the position relative to the metatarsal bone, shape, and transverse diameter of Morton neuromas were assessed on transverse T1-weighted MR images obtained in different body positions. Results: In the prone position, visibility of all 20 Morton neuromas was rated with the highest possible score of 3 (good visibility); visibility of the Morton neuromas on MR images obtained in the supine and weight-bearing positions was inferior (mean score, 2.4). 20/20 Morton neuromas (100 %) changed their position relative to the metatarsal bone between the prone and supine, and between prone and weight-bearing body positions. When compared to the prone position, there was a difference in shape of all 20 Morton neuromas in the weight-bearing position (P < 0.001). Between the prone and supine positions, the transverse diameter of Morton neuroma significantly decreased by 1.5 mm (P = 0.03); between the prone and weight-bearing positions, the decrease of the mean transverse diameter of Morton neuroma reached nearly statistical significance (difference, 1.4 mm; P = 0.05). Conclusion: Morton neuroma appears significantly different during MR imaging in prone, supine or weight-bearing body positions.

Bach, D. Godefroy; Paris/FR Introduction: Communication between the radiocarpal joint (RCJ) and the pisotriquetral joint (PTJ) is common finding, occurring in up to 75 % of wrists. The lack of communication (25 %) is considered as normal variant. The purpose of this paper is to correlate this communication with other disorders of the wrist. Material and methods: 125 patients underwent a three-compartment CT-arthrography of the wrist. Communication between RCJ and PTJ was correlated with others athrographic disorders:\u2022 communicating defect of the scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligaments;\u2022 state of the triangular fibro cartilage complex (TFCC); \u2022 osteoarthritis of PTJ and RCJ; \u2022 ulnar variance;\u2022 clinical findings. A simple procedure for direct PTJ arthrography and steroid injection was also used. Results: Communication was statistically correlated with:\u2022 age of the patient (p = 0.049),\u2022 communicating defect of the lunotriquetral ligament (p = 0.023). Communication was a very sensitive (Se = 96 %) but not specific (Sp = 27 %) finding of communicating defect of the lunotriquetral ligament. Lack of communication was highly predictive of the absence of communication between midcarpal joint and RCJ through the lunotriquetral ligament with a negative predictive value of 94 %. Communication was not statistically correlated with:\u2022 communicating defect of the scapholunate ligament and of the TFCC,\u2022 osteoarthritis of RCJ and PTJ, \u2022 ulnar variance, \u2022 location (ulnar or radial) of the pain, \u2022 history of trauma. Conclusion: Communicating defect of the lunotriquetral ligament is unlikely if there is no arthrographic communication between RCJ and PTJ.

Dinkel 2 ; 1 Brig/CH, 2 Berne/CH Purpose: To assess the value of a modified radiological Hinchey's classification for grading severity of acute diverticulitis with spiral CT. Methods: Retrospective assessment of spiral CT findings in 69 consecutive patients operated on for sigmoid diverticulitis between 1/1997 and 6/2001. Two staff radiologists blinded to clinical findings independently analyzed preoperative spiral CT scans obtaining final consensus for the presence of diverticula, pericolic inflammation, retroperitoneal and peritoneal fluid, abscess and perforation. A modified radiological Hinchey's classification (stage 0 phlegmonous inflammation, stage I local abscess, stage II pelvic abscess, stage III/IV peritonitis) was assessed and correlated to the surgical Hinchey's classification which was based on the intraoperative and histological findings. Results: All of the 69 patients had diverticulitis, 36 were operated on acutely, 33 in an elective procedure. Clinical Hinchey's stage 0 was found in 39 patients, stage I in 22, II in 6, III/IV in 2. Radiological staging yielded 49 cases of stage 0, 11 cases of stage I, 5 cases of stage II, and 4 cases of stage III/IV. There was a significant correlation between clinical and radiological staging (p < 0.0000005***, r = 0.6199). Most sensitive indicators of severity of diverticulitis were pericolic inflammation, pathological fluid collections, and bowel thickening. Conclusion: There is a close correlation between radiological and clinical staging of severity of diverticulitis. However, radiological staging tended to underestimate the severity of disease as intramural abscesses were underdiagnosed.B-063811:00 Value of graded compression US with use of adjuvant techniques: Detection of the vermiform appendix and diagnosis of acute appendicitis J.-H.

We especially investigated, if defaecation provides indispensable information about the cause of the disorder. Material and methods: In a prospective study we examined 30 patients withstool outlet disorders. Static and functional cine MRI of the pelvic bottom was performed after opacification of the rectum using axial an sagittal T2 at rest and a sagittal True-FISP-sequence at rest, during straining. The results were compared with clinical findings and conventional defaecography as actual gold standard in the diagnosis of pelvic bottom disorders. Daefecation had not to be performed during the examination. We especially investigated, if daefecation during conventional defaecography leads to additional information concerning anatomical disorders or organ prolapses in comparison to fMRI. Results: In all cases fMRI showed identical findings compared to conventional defaecography concerning the motion of the rectum. Anterior and posterior rectoceles, intususceptions and pelvic floor descent was shown in both modalities as well. FMRI provided additional information about accompaniing descensus uteri/ vaginae cystoceles and enteroceles in 20 cases. In only threee cases the cause of the disorder could be seen under defecation.

Demirkazik, M.Ariyurek; Ankara/TR Purpose: To evaluate the mammographic findings of histopathologically proven cases of fibrocystic changes and assess associated pathologies. Methods and materials: We reviewed histopathologic results of 250 patients who had undergone excisional biopsy after mammographically guided needle localization. Of these, 119 showed fibrocystic changes. We retrospectively evaluated the mamographic findings and determined associated pathologies. Results: In 12 (10 %) of 119 patients, fibrocystic changes were associated with fibroadenoma (n = 6) or carcinoma (n = 6). Every case associated with carcinoma was manifest by pleomorphic microcalcifications suggestive of malignancy. 4 cases of associated fibroadenoma showed masses and other 2 cases microcalcifications. Of the 4 masses, one was spiculated, one lobulated and the other 2 circumscribed. In 107 (90 %) of 119 cases, fibrocystic changes were not associated with other pathology. Of 107 cases, 65 (60 %) had fibrocystic changes without proliferation. Remaining 42 (40 %) had epithelial hyperplasia, sclerozing adenosis and intraductal papillomatosis as well. Mammographic findings of these 107 patients revealed microcalcifications in 44 (41 %), mass in 43 (40 %), asymmetric density in 16 (15 %) and parenchymal distortion in four (4 %). Of 44 patients presenting with microcalcifications, 24 (55 %) were punctate, 10 (22 %) amorphous, 9 (21 %) pleomorphic in morphology and one (2 %) was manifest as milk of calcium. Of the 43 masses, 17 (39 %) had obscured, 8 (19 %) circumscribed, 13 (30 %) spiculated and 5 (12 %) lobulated margins. Conclusion: Microcalcifications and masses are the most frequently seen mammographic findings of fibrocystic changes. Although spiculated masses and pleomorphic microcalcifications may suggest malignant pathology, they may represent fibrocystic changes in some cases.B-064811:00 The use of weighted Kappa (\u03ba) index for the quality control of mammographic readings in a population-based breast cancer screening program I.

All mammograms were independently double read with consensus meeting in case of disagreement. The k index was calculated regarding the mammographic categories (normal, benign, probably benign, probably malignant and malignant) for the 20 pairs of readers. The radiologists had previously attended meetings and courses in order to complete their educational process.Results:The mean values of weighted k index were: 0.70 (0.43 -0.91), 0.58 (0.36 -0.89), 0.67 (0.43 -0.91), 0.88 (0.42 -1.00) and 0.86 (0.67 -1.00) for normal, benign, probably benign, probably malignant and malignant respectively.Conclusion:The highest values of agreement were found in probably malignant and malignant findings. The lowest values of agreement were found in \"negative for cancer\" mammograms. This fact can be explained by the random classification -significant findings. The proportion of each category for the pairs of readers must be investigated simultaneously to prevent a synchronous deviation from the criteria.B-064911:05 Adjunctive use of electrical impedance scanning (EIS) new software algorithm to differentiate breast lesions in comparison to histopathology: European multicentre study M.

Limitations of the acoustic window complicated the visualization of pulmonary arteries in echocardiography, while MRI and cardiac catheterisation showed all details. Conclusion: MRI is a useful tool in postoperative evaluation of singular ventricle, with advantages over echocardiography. Cardiac catheterisation should only be performed when MRI provides questionable results.

Rienm\u00fcller, G. Reiter, U. Reiter, A. Ryabikin, N. Gagarina; Graz/AT Purpose: Comparison of various approaches to evaluate left ventricular volumes and muscle mass by Magnetic Resonance (MR). Materials and methods: 75 patients with suspected or known coronary heart disease were studied by MR (1.5 T field strength, 40 mT/m gradients, cine-TrueFISP) in 2-chamber and 4-chamber views. Enddiastolic (EDV) and endsystolic (ESV) volumes as well as left ventricular muscle masses (LVMM) were evaluated by a single-plane ellipsoid model. MRI short axis scans were performed in 25 patients to use Simpson rule (ARGUS software) to determine the above parameters. Results: Correlation between the 2-chamber and 4-chamber view is r = 0.93 (95 %confidence interval is 0.89 to 0.95) for EDV, r = 0.94 (0.90 to 0.96) for ESV and r = 0.94 (0.91 to 0.96) for LVMM. Correlation between 2-chamber view and Simpson approach is r = 0.95 (0.88 to 0.98) for EDV, r = 0.98 (0.95 to 0.99) for ESV and r = 0.94 (0.87 to 0.98) for LVMM. Correlation between the 4-chamber view and the Simpson approach is r = 0.98 (0.95 to 0.99) for EDV, r = 0.98 (0.96 to 0.99) for ESV and r = 0.95 (0.88 to 0.98) for LVMM. Conclusion: As the Simpson approach is more time consuming than the 4-and 2-chamber view in evaluation of left ventricular volumes, the 4-chamber view approach may be used routinely as long the morphological configuration of the left ventricle corresponds to an rotational ellipsoid. of ruptured cerebral aneurysms: 3D-rotational angiography in comparison with DSA; a blinded study in 53 patients A. Hochmuth, U. Spetzger, J. Spreer, A. Berlis, J. Klisch, M. Schumacher; Freiburg/DEPurpose: To evaluate the diagnostic value of 3D rotational angiography (RA) in comparison with biplanar Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) in the detectionrate, classification, and treatment-planning of ruptured intracranial aneurysms. Subjects/methods: Between 09/99 and 09/00 53 patients with acute Subarachnoid hemorrhage (Hunt-Hess II -V) underwent angiography (GE Advantx-E, GE, Milwaukee, USA) with both methods. Biplanar DSA was performed in 2 to 6 standard-projections for every vascular territory. 3D-datasets of RA were evaluated using a GE Advantage windows workstation with different algorithms (Surface Shaded Display, Maximum Intensity Projection). The DSA-films and 3D-datasets were analyzed retrospectively in a blinded manner in terms of detection and depiction of aneurysms (number and configuration) and impact on therapy-planning. Results: 49 aneurysms were detected in 42 patients, (1 -5/pat, size 0.6 -20.4 mm), whereas no aneurysm was found in 11 pat. However, RA revealed 7 additional aneurysms not seen on conventional DSA and failed to depict one visible only in compression series. The delineation of the neck of the aneurysm was remarkably improved in RA in 70.5 % of all cases. Better depiction of the parent vessel and relationship to adjacent vessels was demonstrated in 45.0 % respectively 50.0 %. In 9/42 patients, endovascular treatment, in 26/42 patients, micro-surgical therapy was proposed. In 7/42 patients, both options were rated as equal.

Schoenberg, G. van Kaick; Heidelberg/DEPurpose: Non-invasive assessment of blood flow in brain-supplying arteries in patients with cerebral AVMs and correlation with the morphologic and clinical features of the lesions. Patients and methods: In an ongoing prospective protocol we have so far examined 50 patients and 10 age matched volunteers with a 2D-ECG-triggerd phasecontrast-MR-flow measurement. Mean flow, velocity and the shape of the flow profiles were calculated and compared with radiological and clinical features of the malformations. Follow-up studies after radiosurgery are available for 12 patients. Results: Patients with AVMs present with a significant higher flow values and a lateralisation of the flow towards the ipsilateral brain supplying vessels. The mean flow of the ipsilateral internal carotid arteries was 480 ml/min compared to 395 ml/min in the contralateral side (p < 0.05). With increasing size of the malformation the flow-differences increased. Patients with clinical steel syndromes presented with higher flow differences. A correlation between flow differences and the location of the malformation could not be observed. With decreasing size of the malformation after radiosurgical treatment the flow values and differences process toward the values obtained from the volunteers. Discussion: Phase contrast 2D MR flow measurements proved to be a helpful diagnostic tool in the assessment of hemodynamic changes in patients with cerebral AVMs. Flow values correlated with the morphologic and clinical features of the malformation and seem to be helpful in the follow-up of therapy.B-0670 11:20Contrast-enhanced projection MRA and dynamic star MRI in patients with intracranial arterio-venous malformationsM.

Wagner 2 ; 1 Washington, DC/US, 2 Reading, PA/US Purpose: To describe characteristic imaging features of urachal carcinoma.Methods and materials: 25 cases of surgically proven urachal carcinomas were retrospectively reviewed. Computed tomography images were evaluated to determine tumour morphology, presence and localization of calcification, extent of bladder invasion and metastases. The imaging characteristics were compared with gross pathologic appearance. Results: The average patient age was 48 years (range 21 -69 years). There were 13 males and 12 females. Tumour size averaged 6 cm in the largest diameter (range 2 cm -12 cm). 20 cases (84 %) appeared as mixed cystic-solid lesions (16 predominately cystic and 5 predominately solid), 4 (16 %) were completely solid. This correlated well with gross pathologic findings. Calcifications were present in 18/25 (72 %). Eleven cases had purely peripheral calcifications, 4 had both peripheral and central calcification, and 3 showed purely central calcification. Invasion of the bladder wall occurred in 23/25 (92 %). Intraluminal extension of tumour occurred in 13/25 (52 %). The majority of the mass was extravesicular in 22/25 (88 %). Nine cases (36 %) had either local invasion and/or distant metastases at presentation. Two cases of local invasion were not radiologically evident. Conclusion: The CT features of urachal adenocarcinomas in this series were those of a midline, mixed cystic-solid or less often completely solid mass. Focal calcifications (predominately peripheral) are a common finding. Although invasion of the bladder wall and lumen is often seen, the majority of tumours are predominantly extravesicular.

Tsang; Hong Kong/HKPurpose: To quantify emphysema and nodular profusion with CT and evaluate their relationships with lung function, clinical and exercise parameters. Materials and methods: 76 (64.6 \u00b1 8.8 years) men with silicosis underwent CT scans of the thorax. Lung function and exercise parameters [O2 uptake, distance walked] including Borg's scale of dyspnoea were obtained. Nodular profusion (NP) and progressive massive fibrosis (PMF) were graded following a 4-point scale (1 -4). Emphysema, using threshold values (\u2212950 to \u22121024 HU), and mean lung density (MLD) were quantified. Duration of silica exposure and cigarette consumption (pack years) was obtained. Spearman's and multiple regression analysis were performed to evaluate the inter-relationships between the different parameters (p < 0.05 as significant).Findings: PMF was correlated to emphysema (r = 0.58). All CT parameters were inversely related to lung function indices. PMF showed the best correlation with indices of obstruction [FEV1(r = \u22120.63), FEV1/FVC (r = 0.51)]; MLD with TLC (r = \u2212 0.53)] emphysema with DLCO/VA (r = \u22120.42). MLD and PMF were associated with Borg's grade. NP and PMF were inversely related to exercise parameters. After multiple regression, PMF remained a significant determinant of FEV1 and FEV1/FVC; MLD of TLC, VC and Borg's scale; emphysema of FEV1, FEV1/FVC and DLCO/VA. Men with PMF (n = 58) had significantly worse lung function, CT grades, Borgs scale and O2 uptake than those with simply silicosis. Smoking and silica exposure exerted no independent effects on lung function. Conclusion: PMF is an independent determinant of airflow obstruction associated with functional impairment and disease severity in silicosis.

Niehaus; Berlin/DEPurpose: Neurological complications often occur postpartum in patients with eclampsia and HELLP-syndrome (Hemolysis Elevated Liver enzymes and Low Platelet count). The aim of the study was to elucidate the pathogenesis of brain lesions in these patients using diffusion-and perfusion-weighted imaging (DWI; PWI). Methods: Three women with eclampsia (n = 2) and HELLP-syndrome (n = 1) (aged from 25 -29 a) with seizures, altered mental status, visual disturbances and further neurological deficits were investigated. DWI (TR/TEeff 4800/145 ms; EPI factor 13; b = 0/386/868 mm 2 /s) and PWI (3D-susceptibility-based; TR/TE/\u03b1 18 ms/ 25 ms/8\u00b0) were performed postpartally. Results: In all patients MRI showed brain lesions with increased apparent diffusion-(ADC) coefficients (up to 215 mm 2 /s) which resolved within several weeks. PWI did not reveal areas of hyper-or hypoperfusion assessed by mean time of bolus track arrival. Conclusion: Brain lesions in eclampsia/HELLP-syndrome represent vasogenic edema which may be completely reversible.

Parizel, J.W. van Goethem, A.M.A. de Schepper; Edegem/BE Purpose: To define the role of contrast enhanced MR Angiography (ce-MRA) of the carotid and intracranial arteries in patients with acute cerebral stroke. Methods and materials: The images were obtained using combined head and neck coils. The MR imaging protocol for patients with a clinic of acute cerebral stroke (within 48 hours) as follows: (1) Ax FLAIR, (2) Ax TSE T2, (3) Sag SE T1,(4) Ax EPI BOLD Diffusion WI with ADC map, (5) 3D ce-MRA of the carotid and intracerebral arteries with 2D CARE Bolus technique, (6) Ax TSE T1 after GD injection. Results: Besides depicting acute cerebral infarction due to cytotoxic edema on diffusion WI, ce-MRA shows us the underlying vascular etiology in most of the cases such as high grade stenosis with plaques, dissection, emboli, and vascular malformations. T1 WI after gadolinium enhancement reveals also gyral enhancement which has a value in therapetic desicions.Conclusion: CE-MRA with care bolus technique of the carotid and intracranial arteries combined with postcontrast Ax T1 WI may show the underlying etiology in most of the patients with acute cerebral stroke.

Kirchner; Herne/DE Purpose: To compare the diagnostic power of stereoscopic and standard threedimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) in the classification of acetabular fractures by interdisciplinary review. Materials and methods: Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) were assessed for two radiologists and two surgeons blinded to the presence of acetabular fractures in an animal model (a total of 62 pork hips, 40 of them with artificial acetabular fractures). Interpretation of stereoscopic and standard 3D-CT images was performed on a workstation (Virtuoso\u00ae, Siemens Medical Systems, Forchheim, Germany) using two specific volume rendering algorithms: unshaded bone and shaded bone. Main target parameter was the diagnostic accuracy in the classification of artificial fractures following Judet and Letournel. Results: ROC analysis for radiologists showed Az-values of 0.83 for standard 3D-CT and 0.81 for stereoscopic 3D-CT when using an unshaded bone algorithm (p > 0.5); Az-values were 0.82 for standard 3D-CT and 0.81 for stereoscopic 3D-CT when using a shaded bone algorithm (p > 0.5). Az-values for the surgeons were 0.87 for standard 3D-CT and 0.86 for stereoscopic 3D-CT when using an unshaded bone algorithm (p > 0.5); Az-values were 0.82 for both standard and stereoscopic 3D-CT when using a shaded bone algorithm (p > 0.5).

Wedeg\u00e4rtner, C. Gatzka, P. Steiner, J.M. Rueger, G.B. Adam; Hamburg/DE Purpose: To assess the usefulness of MSCT in the detection and classification of pelvic and acetabular fractures. and methods: Routine radiography and MSCT of the pelvis with sagittal and coronal MPR's were performed in 41 patients with clinically suspected pelvic or acetabular fractures. One trauma surgeon and a radiologist evaluated routine radiography and CT images in terms of fracture detection, classification and illustration. Fracture classification was obtained using the AO classification system, Tile and Letournel. Results: In 15 patients a suspected fracture was excluded by MSCT. In the remaining 26 patients 19 anterior pelvic ring, 4 anterior and posterior pelvic ring, 11 acetabular and 7 sacral fractures were diagnosed. All MSCT-findings were obtained by transversal source images. Multiplanar reconstructions were especially advantageous in cases with fractures of the sacrum und acetabulum. In 7 (27 %) patients additional fractures (5 acetabular, 2 posterior pelvic ring) were detected with MSCT, but not on plain film. In 4 additional patients MSCT-diagnosis resulted in changes of fracture classification based on MSCT. In 6 (23 %) patients the therapeutical algorithm was changed according to MSCT diagnosis. Conclusions: MSCT examinations of the pelvis should be performed in patients with clinically suspected fractures to confirm or exclude pelvic fractures and may replace conventional radiography in the future.

Steinbrich 1 ; 1 Basle/CH, 2 Philadelphia, PA/US Purpose: To investigate MR signal patterns and location of pelvic heterotopic ossification in paralysed patients. Patients and methods: 36 patients (female n = 3, male n = 33, mean age 43.3) with proven heterotopic ossification on CT (n = 17) or radiographs (n = 19) who had a 1.5 T pelvic MR (contrast enhanced, n = 34) within 3 months of CT or radiographs were included. Maturity of heterotopic ossification was graded by two musculoskeletal radiologists on CT or radiography as: (I)Fluid density on CT without calcification; (II) Calcification; (III) Immature ossification; (IV) Mature ossification. Location and MR signal of all heterotopic ossification sites was noted. Results: 141 sites of heterotopic ossification were graded as follows: grade I: n = 20; grade II: n = 39; grade III: n = 30; grade IV: n = 52. With increasing maturity the frequency of hyperintense signal within heterotopic ossification decreased (I: 70 %, II: 58 %, III: 44 %, IV: 4 %) and the frequency of fat and cortical signal increased (I: 0 %, II: 3 %, III: 13 %, IV: 86 %). With progressive maturity of heterotopic ossification a decrease in frequency of enhancement from 100 % (grade I) to 20 % (grade IV) was observed. Fifteen (88 %) patients with CT correlation had heterotopic ossification localized to the trochanteric or iliopsoas bursa (55/91 sites (60 %)). Conclusion: With progressive maturity of heterotopic ossification a decrease of T2 hyperintensity and enhancement is seen while fat and cortical bone-equivalent signal increases. CT correlation localizes the majority of heterotopic ossifications in the trochanteric and iliopsoas bursa.

Hilfiker; Z\u00fcrich/CH Purpose: To compare 3D MR angiography (MRA) and MDCT angiography (CTA) for assessment of peripheral runoff vessels with intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as the standard of reference.Materials and methods: DSA, MRA and CTA were performed in 20 consecutive patients with suspected occlusive arterial disease. MRA (1.5 T; GEMS) and CTA (Volume Zoom, Germany) were assessed independently by two readers for the presence of significant arterial stenosis; a third reader evaluated the DSA images. Volume rendered (VR) images for CTA, maximum intensity projection (MIP) for MRA; multiplanar reformations (MPR) and source images for both were used for evaluation. Time for post-processing and reading time of both data sets were computed. Results: Highest overall sensitivities/specificities were found at the pelvic and femoral level (CTA 84 %/98 %; MRA 88 %/95 %) and lowest at the level of lower leg (CTA 70 %/95 %; MRA 65 %/90 %). Interobserver agreement for both MRA and CTA was good (kappa = 0.64) and intermodality agreement between CTA and MRA was 0.62. Post-processing of the data sets was significantly more time consuming for CTA (29 min) than for MRA (9 min). Reading time was similar with both methods (CTA 5 min; MRI 4 min). Major difficulties encountered in CTA were calcification of the vessels, in MRA the bolus tracking for the lower leg.

Main/DEPurpose: To evaluate high resolution contrast enhanced MRA (CE-MRA) for treatment planning in patients with peripheral arterial obstructive disease (PAOD) and lesions in the calf. Method and materials: 65 patients with PAOD of the popliteal or infrapopliteal arteries were prospectively studied with CE-MRA before angioplasty or a surgical bypass operation. All MR examinations were performed on a 1.5 T MR unit (Symphony Quantum, Siemens) with employment of a newly developed phased array peripheral coil and automatic table movement. CE-MRA results were correlated with subsequent DSA findings. All results were blinded and reviewed by three radiologists. The findings were graded as normal, minor changes, stenotic (< 50 %, 50 -70 %, and > 70 %) or occlusion. 37 patients subsequently had a femoro-crural bypass operation and 28 patients PTA. Results: A total of 153 abnormal arterial segments were evaluated with CE-MRA and DSA. CE-MRA correlated to DSA findings in 94 % of the cases. In 14.7 % of the cases CE-MRA overestimated vascular perfusion. In 4 cases, where CE-MRA showed a perfused vessel, intraoperative findings revealed an occluded vessel. Detection of arteriosclerotic changes within the vessels of the calf was markedly employment of the new peripheral coil. Suggested treatment and the interventional approach based on the CE-MRA findings corresponded to DSA in 95 %. Conclusion: High resolution CE-MRA of the calf is an excellent modality for the detection of vascular lesions in this region when findings are interpreted with caution. The correlation of CE-MRA findings with clinical findings is mandatory for correct interpretation of the distal run-off situation.B-077914:40 Evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of contrast enhanced MRA (CE-MRA) in peripheral arterial occlusive disease with a new, dedicated peripheral MRA coil -comparison to DSA findings J.O.

Main/DE Purpose: To evaluate contrast enhanced MRA (CE-MRA) with employment of a newly developed peripheral MRA coil for treatment planning and follow-up after laser angioplasty or PTA in patients with peripheral arterial obstructive disease (PAOD). Material and method: 157 patients with stenosis or occlusion of the pelvic or lower extremity arteries were prospectively studied with CE-MRA before laser and/or balloon angioplasty. All MR examinations were performed on a 1.5 T MR unit (Symphony Quantum, Siemens) with employment of a newly developed phased array peripheral coil and automatic table movement. CE-MRA results were correlated with subsequent DSA findings. For planning of the interventional approach CE-MRA and DSA findings were included in the review. All results were blinded and reviewed by three radiologists. The findings were graded as normal, minor changes, stenotic (70 %) or occlusion. Results: In 157 patients, a total of 451 abnormal arterial segments were evaluated with CE-MRA, CTA, and DSA. CE-MRA correlated to DSA findings in 100 % (occlusions), in 98 % (stenosis > 70 %), 97 % (stenosis 50 -70 %), and 98 % (stenosis < 50 %). Minor arteriosclerotic changes were detected in 87 % of cases. Detection of arteriosclerotic changes within the vessels of the calf were markedly improved by employment of the new peripheral coil. Suggested treatment and the interventional approach based on the CE-MRA findings corresponded to DSA in 98 %. Conclusion: CE-MRA is an excellent modality for screening, treatment planning, and follow-up in patients with PAOD. The peripheral MRA coil facilitated patient examination and increased spatial resolution thus making CE-MRA even more accurate.

Hausegger, W. Amann, M. Aschauer, J. Tauss; Graz/AT Purpose: To evaluate the potential of multislice CT-angiography (CTA) in the detection of hemodynamically significant (\u2265 70 %) lesions of the aortoiliac, femoropopliteal and infrapopliteal arteries. Methods and materials: 41 patients (35 men, 6 women; mean age 68 years) with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) underwent multslice spiral-CTA and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) from the infrarenal aorta to the supramalleolar region. CT-parameters were 4 \u00d7 2.5 mm collimation, 1.5 cm table-increment (pitch 6) and 1.25 mm reconstruction-increment. Volume rendering technique (VRT), maximum intensity projection (MIP) and MIP together with axial CT-studies were reviewed for significant stenoses and occlusions. DSA was the standard of reference. Results: In 37 patients, 210 lesions were detected by DSA (84 stenoses, 126 occlusions). Considering all \u00b3 70 % lesions, VRT/MIP/MIP + axial CT revealed 12 (71 %)/14 (82 %)/15 (88 %) of 17 aortoiliacal, 45 (90 %)/47 (94 %)/49 (98 %) of 50 femoropopliteal and 114 (80 %)/121 (85 %)/127 (89 %) of 143 infrapopliteal lesions. On VRT/MIP/MIP + axial CT, 9/49/11 aortoiliacal, 9/10/9 femoropopliteal and 65/49/47 infrapopliteal vessel sections were considered to be \u00b3 70 % stenotic whereas DSA showed no significant lumen narrowing. Distinction of stenoses and occlusions was impossible in 035 (24 %)/38 (26 %)/41 (29 %) infrapopliteal lesions on VRT/ MIP/MIP + axial CT-studies.Conclusion: Multislice CTA is helpful in detecting hemodynamically significant lesions in PAOD. However, lesion overestimation is a frequent feature of all CTAimaging modalities. In infrapopliteal arteries, stenoses and occlusions are likely to be confused. Since axial CT-studies yielded most correct positive results, they should always be reviewed additionally.B-0781 15:00Multislice spiral CT angiography in the evaluation of patients with peripheral arterial disease C. Catalano, F. Fraioli, M. Bezzi, A. Laghi, A. Napoli, F. Pediconi, S. Vagnarelli, R. Passariello; Rome/IT Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare multislice CT-Angiography (MSCTA) with DSA in patients with peripheral obstructive disease. Materials and methods: 50 patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease were evaluated with MSCTA after bolus administration of 140 ml of nonionic c.a. at 4 ml/s. A fixed time delay of 28 seconds was used in all patients. In all cases DSA was performed within 72 hours after CTA. A 3D real time interaction on a dedicated workstation was performed in all cases, utilizing different reconstruction algorithms and if necessary axial images, by three experienced blinded observers. The findings were graded as normal, < 50 % > 50 % single, > 50 % diffuse and occlusion for 23 different arterial segments. For statistical evaluation the arterial segments were then divided in 3 groups: aorto-iliac, femoro-popliteal and run off vessels. Results: By using a fixed time delay, good to excellent arterial enhancement and image quality was achieved in all cases. A total of 1147 arterial segments were evaluated with CTA and DSA. Regarding the degree of stenosis in the aorto-iliac, femoropopliteal and run off vessels, the values of sensitivity and specificity were respectively 100 % and 98 %, 100 % and 96 %, 98 % and 94 %. The interobserver variability showed a kappa value for the aorto-iliac segment of 0.93, for the femoropopliteal segment of 0.94 and for the run off vessels of 0.90. Conclusion: MSCTA appears particularly accurate in the assessment of peripheral arterial disease, and therefore can be proposed as a non-invasive imaging modality.B-078215:10 Timed arterial compression contrast enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (TAC-CEMRA) for optimized imaging of the hand vasculature K.

Methods and materials: The MR examinations of 16 patients (4 men, 12 women) with liver metastases from gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors were retrospectively reviewed. All primary tumors had histolopathologic correlation. The liver metastases were confirmed by histopathology in 13 patients and by imaging and clinical follow-up in 5 patients. All MR studies were performed at 1.5 T comprising: T1weighted spoiled gradient echo (SGE), T2-weighted fat-suppressed turbo spin echo, HASTE, and serial postgadolinium T1-weighted SGE sequences without and with fat-suppression. Signal intensity and patterns of contrast enhancement of metastases were evaluated. Results: 156 liver metastases were evaluated in 16 patients. On precontrast T1-/ T2-weighted images, 117 metastases (75 %) were hypointense/hyperintense. 24 metastases (15 %) in 5 patients (31 %) showed globular areas of high signal on T1-and T2-weighted images. 5 enhancement patterns of metastases were identified on postgadolinium images. 146 metastases (94 %) were hypervascular, showing moderate intense enhancement during the hepatic arterial phase, and 9 metastases (6 %) were hypovascular. 23 metastases (15 %) were visible only on immediate postgadolinium images. Conclusion: Carcinoid liver metastases demonstrate a spectrum of appearances, are commonly hypervascular, and may only be demonstrable on immediate postgadolinium images.B-079014:50 Diagnostic imaging of FNH: Characterization using SPIO-enhanced MRI R.M.

Siamopoulou; Ioannina/GRPurpose: In Idiopathic Juvenile Arthritis (IJA) hip joint involvement is a sign of poor prognosis. Our purpose was to evaluate the role of MRI in the detection of hip joint involvement and to assess the relationship of MR findings with the clinical subtypes of IJA. Material and methods: 28 patients (mean age, 12.5 years) with IJA, 8 having an oligoarthritis, 13 polyarthritis and 7 systemic arthritis were studied with T2-weighted turbo-spin-echo and T1-weighted spin-echo sequences, before and after intravenous injection of Gd-DTPA. An MR grading score was established: grade 1 = no contrast enhancement, 2 = focal synovial enhancement, 3 = diffuse enhancement, 4 = 3 + diffuse synovial thickening, 5 = 4 + villonodular thickening, 6 = 5 + cartilage and bone erosions. Results: The clinical examination was abnormal in 32.1 % of cases and the MR in 57.1 %. The MR was abnormal in 25 % of patients with oligoarthritis, 53.8 % with polyarthritis and 100 % of patients with systemic arthritis. Higher MR grades presented in patients with active disease (mean 3.9, SD 2) compared to those with inactive disease (mean 2.1, SD 1.4) (p < 0.01) and patients with a positive clinical examination (mean 4.6, SD 1.34) compared to those with a negative one (mean 1.78, SD 1.13) (p < 0.001). The MR grades were different in the three clinical forms (oligoarticular: mean 1.5, SD 1.06, polyarticular: mean 2.38, SD 1.55 and systemic: mean 4.85, SD 1.21) (F: 12.3, p < 0.001). Significant differences were found between systemic arthritis and oligoarthritis and systemic arthritis and polyarthritis (p < 0.001). Conclusion: MRI helps in the detection of hip joint involvement and its use in the imaging protocol of patients with polyarthritis and systemic arthritis should be considered.B-0800 15:00Skeletal anomalies on hand and feet radiographs in patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrom and Muenke-type mutation (FGFR3 Pro250Arg) A.

Bruel; Montpellier/FR Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of radiology in the treatment of morbid obesity by adjustable laparoscopic gastric banding (ALGB). Methods: From September 1996 to September 2000, 374 consecutive patients underwent an ALGB-119 lap band system (LB) and 255 Sweedish adjustable gastric banding (SAGB). Upper gastrointestinal series were performed within 24 -48 hours after surgery in all patients. Radiologic examination was also used to detect complications and to adjust gastric band. Results: The 2 differents types of gastric band are easily identified on plain films. Early and late complications are illustrated: pouch dilatation (LP: 11 patients, SAGB: 5 patients), slippage (LB: 27 patients, SAGB: 5 patients), band migration (LB: 1 patient, SAGB: 0 patient), rotation of the access port and system disconnection (LB: 0 patient, SAGB: 2 patients). Radiological criteria for adjustment of gastric band are explained on the basis of barium studies performed before and after any modification of the stoma size. Conclusion: In patients treated with ALGB for morbid obesity, radiology plays an important role in evaluating early and late complications and in the management of weight loss.

Imaging was performed with a 4.7 T Bruker scanner at early chronic stage of the infection. Eleven animals were imaged 3 h and 24 h, eight 48 h and three animals 72 h after intravenous USPIO application. Two infected rats were imaged without contrast agent and served as controls. SE T1-, T2-and GE T2*-weighted sequences were applied in a transaxial orientation. Histopathology of all animals was correlated with MRI. Electron microscopy was performed in two rats. Results: Visualization of USPIO-loaded macrophages was most sensitive with a T2*-weighted GE sequence as this sequence shows strong susceptibility effects. dynamic transit of the particle accumulation from the intravascular to the intracellular compartment by macrophage phagocytosis. Local signal alterations could be correlated with iron-loaded macrophages on histopathology. Conclusion: Activated macrophages in acute soft tissue infection can be labelled with USPIOs and detected by MRI due to susceptibility effects. Macrophage imaging allows definition of the cellular extent of infection, specifies edema patterns on MRI by assessing the distribution of inflammatory cells and provides functional information and high resolution anatomical maps. mg/l ruled out PE.

Maximum CT numbers in pulmonary arteries at the level of the aortic arch and the lung bases were 283 \u00b1 95 HU and 266 \u00b1 114 HU for 100 kVp and 187 \u00b1 71 HU and 132 \u00b1 66 HU for 140 kVp. The percentage of pulmonary arteries that could be evaluated was significantly higher for 100 kVp (96 % vs 86 % segmental and 76 % vs. 47 % subsegmental arteries). Conclusion: Low kVp scanning increases contrast enhancement of central and peripheral pulmonary arteries and improves visualization of the pulmonary vascular system even at a substantially reduced radiation exposure.Purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE), using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as reference method. Methods and materials: 141 patients with suspected PE and abnormal perfusion scan underwent MRA prior to DSA and were managed on the basis of DSA results. Images were blindly assessed by independent reviewers. In case of disagreement, diagnosis was made based on subsequent consensus. MRA is sensitive for segmental or larger pulmonary embolism, and highly specific. The results are comparable to helical CT, but MRA has the advantage of using non-ionising radiation and safer contrast agents. With increasing availability of MRI systems, MRA could be part of a powerful diagnostic strategy in the future. Our initial experience indicates that optimized display of the density distribution within the lung parenchyma provides additional information in patients with suspected or proven PE with good correlation to V/Q SPECT. Decreased perfusion might become an additional secondary sign of PE in MSCT.Accuracy of multislice CT for acute deep venous thrombosis: Variability of observer perfomance related to clinical experience C.

All cases were counter-read by an experienced radiologist. Comparison was carried out per nodule for calculation of true and false positives, false negatives, and with respect to nodule size.Results: 238 possible nodules had been analysed. If all nodules irrespective of size are included, the automated detection has a sensitivity of 84 %. If the minimum nodule size for detection is set to 2 mm, 34 out of the 172 computer-detected nodules are false positives, and 7 false negatives occurred (sensitivity: 95 %). Conclusions: With the use of thin-section multislice CT, computer-aided detection of small lung nodules may experience a break-through in clinical relevance. The algorithms can evaluate the fully isotropic, three-dimensional information of potential nodules and thus reduce ambiguities. An additional 100 normal and 100 pathologic scans were then used to test the detection of pathology by the algorithm. The total of 1000 CT scans required in the study were selected from the portal venous phase of upper abdominal CT examinations performed in patients with normal findings or hypovascularized liver lesions. For the preliminary version of the algorithm used in this study, it was necessary to define regions of interest that were converted to a 128 \u00d7 128 matrix with an 8 bit grey scale (in DICOM format). Results: Training of the algorithm with the 400 learning examples each of normal and abnormal findings took about 50 hours. The classification of a single image was performed within a few seconds. The diagnostic accuracy achieved for the test scans was close to 99 %. The error rate for the pathologic and normal images was comparable. Conclusion: The modified Perceptron algorithm has an accuracy of about 99 % in detecting pathology on CT scans of the liver showing either normal findings or hypovascularised focal liver lesions.Image fusion to guide and monitor therapeutic interventionF.L. Giesel, H. von Tengg-Kobligk, M. McAuliffe, D. McGarry, B. Wood, S.L. Bacharach, M.V. Knopp; Bethesda, MD/USPurpose: Targeted therapies depend on exact delineation of tumor tissue in order to encompass the lesion while sparing surrounding parenchyma. To achieve best results, a combination of morphologic and functional imaging is necessary. In this study, image co-registration was evaluated to guide and monitor radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy in the abdomen. Materials and methods: A prospective co-registration pilot study was performed according to GCP in 7 patients (4 m, 3 f) with different kind of abdominal tumors (6 liver, 1 kidney) undergoing RFA. Morphological imaging was performed using CT and MRI prior to and after RFA. Functional studies included concurrent FDG-PET and dynamic MRI. A PC based, open-software (MIPAV, NIH, Bethesda, USA) was optimized for image co-registration that was based on anatomical landmarks using least squares or thin plate spline registration. Results: Co-registration was successfully done in all patients with fusion of two morphological image sets (pre-and post-RFA) as well as studies of different modalities. The processed image sets were review by an interventional radiologist and assessed regarding their information gain. The most helpful image fusion sets were determined to be A: assessment of treated against targeted volume and B: fusion of morphologic with functional imaging (CT/PET, PET/MRI, MRI/FMRI). Volume Rendering of co-registered data sets enabled direct 3D visualization. Conclusion: Advanced image processing including co-registration for image fusion is an essential tool to guide and monitor therapeutic interventions. Current software and findings in a pilot study are already promising to rapidly advance this into clinical practice",

Results: No clinical and biological adverse events were noted. All cancers were detected on first post-contrast MR images (enhancement rates: 55 -80 %, detection of peri-tumour new vessels). Morphological features were typical of malignant lesions. Dynamic enhancement was centripetal; maximal enhancement was noted in the peripheral part of lesions (correlation with histology).

Methods and materials: 548 patients have been studied with ultrasound using high frequency probes by an experienced sonographer. The same patients have been successively studied with MRI by another radiologist unaware of ultrasound findings. Results and clinical impact have been compared and all examinations with discordant findings have been reviewed. Results: All complete tears of the rotator cuff evident at MRI have been depicted by ultrasound whereas only 89 % of partial tears were evident. In all cases ultrasound has depicted subacromial bursal effusion and periarticular calcification. Conclusion: In our experience ultrasound can depict very well large rotator cuff tears. Discordant findings review has demonstrated that ultrasound can depict and quantify better than MRI tendinosis and small chronic partial tears. In our experience we have observed that partial tears were missed by ultrasound in obese patients. On the other hand MRI motion artifacts in patients with pain suggests directly ultrasound examination. Surgeons confirm the tendency to consider MRI as the preoperative gold standard, specially in depicting muscular atrophy and intraarticular effusions and deep bursal effusions but we noted that only a small percentage of rotator cuff tear were surgically treated.

Masciocchi 1 ; 1 L'Aquila/IT, 2 Milan/IT Purpose: This work aims to verify the diagnostic capability of dedicated (E-SCAN) and whole body MRI units in the evaluation of rotator cuff pathology in respect to surgical findings. Materials and methods: Forty patients affected by rotator cuff dysfunction entered this study. In all cases MR examination was performed using both dedicated and whole body units. In selected cases arthro-MRI was employed to differentiate tendonitis from partial tears and partial from complete tears. All the patients underwent surgery. Considering surgery as the gold standard, the analysis of the results was conducted, comparing data from dedicated and whole body MR units. Results: Results from arthro-MRI performed on both whole body and dedicated units were compared with surgical findings. In nine cases of complete tendon tear both dedicated and whole body MR examinations revealed the lesions in agreement with the surgical findings. In one of the three cases of surgically proved partial tendon tears, dedicated MRI failed to reveal the lesion whilst it was detected by the whole body MR unit. Intra-articular injection of contrast medium allowed detection of the partial tear also using the dedicated unit. In 28 cases of high grade tendonitis both dedicated and whole body MRI revealed the lesion and arthro-MR, when performed, confirmed the absence of partial tendon tears. Conclusion: High correspondence was found between dedicated and whole body MR-units data when compared to surgical findings.MR arthrography in the unstable shoulder: a cost-benefit analysis J.A.

DEXA was performed in 51 patients. Most of the patients were treated with Disodium Pamidronate. After one year, we resumed the measurements. We have already reassessed 12 patients.Conclusion:Both methods indicate a progression of osteoporosis with age. There is a good agreement of Z and BMD values between DEXA and QCT.

Sikorska, T.J. Bulski, J. Walecki, M.L. Nowicki; Warsaw/PL DWI shows higher sensitivity in detection of early ischemic lesions as compared to T-FLAIR. DWI allows differentiation of new and chronic ischemic foci in patients with multifocal changes. The clinical course of the ischemic stroke is better in patients with lesions that are silent on T-FLAIR. EPI DWI is sensitive in detecting haemorrhagic stroke.Purpose: Conventional postoperative evaluation of patients following carotid thromboendarterectomy (TEA) consists of a clinical neurologic examination to assess neurologic deficits, color duplex ultrasound to document the surgically reestablished patency of the carotid artery and CT for exclusion of postoperative ischemic infarctions. Recent studies prove that diffusion-weighted MRI is more sensitive in the detection of fresh insults than conventional MRI and CT. The objective of the study was to ascertain the incidence of clinically asymptomatic peri-and postoperative ischemic infarctions visualized at MRI. MRI returned findings of fresh disturbances of diffusion suggestive of ischemia that were not visualized on preoperative scans. Discrete neurologic deficits were observed in only two (3.9 %) of these patients. Deficits were transient and disappeared within 72 h. Conclusion: Our findings underscore MRI's capacity for visualizing perioperative ischemic events. Moreover, MRI provides evidence of clinically asymptomatic embolisms that occur perioperatively. The high rate of asymptomatic embolic lesions after aortic valve replacement, newly detected by DW-EPI MRI, makes frequency and volume of these lesions suitable parameters to evaluate the effectiveness of future neuroprotective strategies in cardiac surgery.

Abolmaali 2 ; 1 Dresden/DE, 2 Frankfurt a. Main/DE Purpose: To derive information about the diversity of vascularization of tissue from the transient signal loss during the passage of paramagnetic contrast medium (CM). The time course of T2 * change is interpreted to result from different blood pathways (eg normal vascularization vs. shunts) giving rise to different curve shapes overlaying each other. Methods and materials: Investigations were performed on 8 patients suffering from pharyngeal tumors prior to and occasionally during radiation therapy. 0.2 mmol/kg of CM were injected as a bolus (Magnevist, Schering). Measurements were performed at 1.5 T (Magnetom Vision, Siemens; Symphony, Siemens) using double echo flash sequences. The change of T2 * in time was modeled overlaying two \u03b3 variate functions (GVF) or a simplified model basically consisting of two triangles.Results:The two-GVF model fits the data plausibly. Nevertheless, the simplified model gives more stable results due to the reduced number of free parameters. Preliminary evaluations show the AIF to be describable with one GVF (or triangle resp.). In 5 of 7 evaluable cases the T2 * course from tumor tissue is fit more plausibly by the two-pathway models. In all 3 evaluable samples of non-affected muscle, the broader model component seems to be at least less prominent compared to tumors. Conclusion: The passage of a CM bolus through pharyngeal tumor tissue can be modeled more plausibly with two-pathway models compared to the description with one-GVF models.

Methods and materials: January 1999 to December 2000 we randomised the subjects with acute flank pain, 48 patients to NHCT and 48 to plain radiographs and US with the selective addition of NHCT in unclear cases. Results: In the first group a final diagnosis was available in 40 cases. CT depicted 20 out of 23 cases of ureterolithiasis; all false negatives were followed by stone expulsion. Three subjects underwent urologic treatment and all showed calculi on NHCT images. CT detected 4 of 5 alternative diagnoses with 1 false positive. In the second group a diagnosis was obtained in 39 patients. Combined US and plain films were positive in 15 of 21 patients with calculi; all false negatives were followed by uncomplicated course. Plain film was falsely positive for ureterolithiasis in 1 case. There was 1 false negative for alternative cause and 1 false positive. NHCT was performed in 11 out of 22 patients with a negative US plus radiographic evaluation, detecting a stone in 4. All 3 patients requiring an invasive management were positive on combined US and radiographs.

Siani 1 ; 1 Pozzuoli/IT, 2 Naples/IT Purpose: To compare the accuracy of NHCT and of combined US and plain radiographs in patients with acute flank pain suspected for urinary colic. Methods and materials: From January 1997 to December 1999 181 consecutive patients (108 male and 73 female, age 19 -73 years, mean 40 years) were prospectively imaged because of suspected renal colic. History of nephrolithiasis or previous colics was present in 36 subjects while microhematuria was identified in 51. Patients first underwent combined plain films and US (including vesical jet colour-Doppler analysis); UHCT was successively performed blindly.Results: UHCT had a greater sensitivity (92 % vs. 77 %), negative predictive value (87 % vs. 68 %), and overall accuracy (94 % vs. 83 %) compared to KUB plus US. Nevertheless all 17 cases correctly depicted by UHCT and missed by US plus plain films were due to small stones and all but one had an uncomplicated course with spontaneous calculus expulsion. The differences in specificity (96 % vs. 93 %) and positive predictive value (98 % vs. 95 %), and the difference in detecting alternative causes of pain were not significant. Conclusion: Plain film plus US is effective in screening for urinary colic, mainly missing minor colics due to tiny, spontaneously expulsed stones. UHCT is more accurate but primary use of this technique is overestimating since it carries limited practical consequences.Spiral CT evaluation of the chemical composition of renal calculiR. Renard-Penna 1 , M.-F. Bellin 2 , J.-B. Meric 2 , P. Conort 1 , M. Daudon 1 , V. Hopirtean 1 , F. Richard 1 , P.A. Grenier 1 ; 1 Paris/FR, 2 Villejuif/FR Purpose:To evaluate the ability of dual voltage spiral CT to assess the chemical composition of renal calculi. Methods and materials: 100 human renal calculi, randomly chosen from among 7 chemically pure or mixed groups were surgically placed in 5 calices (2/pole + 1 in the middle) in each of 20 excised pig kidneys. Each kidney was then examined with 2 spiral CT scanners (Somatom Plus 4, Elscint-CT Twin Flash) at 80 -90 and 120 kV with 3 mm collimation. Two independent observers identified the regions of interest on each slice and mean CT density values of the whole calculus projection area were calculated. The relationship between CT values with calculus chemical composition determined by infrared spectrophotometry was studied. Paired tests were used and the interobserver variability was measured. Results: Seven groups of calculi were defined according to their predominant component: uric acid (n = 18), cystine (n = 9), struvite (n = 14), calcium oxalate monohydrate (n = 22), weddellite (n = 10), whewellite (n = 24), or brushite (n = 3). The maximal diameter of the calculi ranged from 4 to 27 mm (mean 9.8 \u00b1 5 mm). Only dual kilovoltage CT values for pure cystine (363 -586 HU) and uric acid (287 -408 HU) calculi differed significantly from those of brushite (917 -1354 HU). Conclusion: Spiral CT cannot distinguish between the most common types of human calculi, except uric acid/cystine and brushite calculi.Renal diffusion and bold MR imaging in experimental diabetic nephropathy F.

Shin, C. von Falck, M. Galanski; Hannover/DE Purpose: To cope with the large data volumes produced by multislice CT, there is increasing interest in the use of volume rendering (VRT) as a diagnostic tool. Visibility of low contrast lesions was evaluated comparing use of a volume rendering tool with different transfer functions and with the original slices. Material and methods: A phantom consisting of spheres of different diameters (2 -6 mm, 1 mm increment) was placed in a sugar solution (contrast: 40 HU \u00b1 25 HU) and scanned on a GE Lightspeed QX/I (slice width: 2.5 mm, Pitch 6, reconstruction interval: 2 mm). VRT was performed by mapping HU-values to gray levels equal to a CT window used for film viewing (center: 60 HU, window: 370 HU). A linear ramp was applied for the opacity transfer function varying the maximum opacity between 0.1 to 1.0 in 0.1 steps. No gradient transfer function was used. In the resulting images Regions of Interest were placed in all visible spheres (lesions) and in the sugar solution (background) on each slice. A statistical method based on the rose model was used to calculate the detection threshold (minimum grey level difference: MGLD) depending on lesion size and image noise. Results: Low contrast detectability (LCD) in VRT is comparable to the original slices. The observed loss in contrast in VRT is largely compensated by a decrease in image noise. Contrast-to-MGLD-Ratio: 2 and 3 mm: not visible/measurable, 4 mm: Conclusion: VRT shows comparable performance in LCD to the original slices.CT fluoroscopy: Evaluation of patient and staff radiation doses N. Buls, J. Pages, J. De Mey, M. Osteaux; Brussels/BE Purpose: Computed Tomography Fluoroscopy (CTF) is widely used as a guidance tool for various interventions such as biopsies, fluid collection aspirations, drainages, radio-frequency ablations and local drug injections. However, there is a potential for significantly high patient and staff radiation doses due to the high CT exposure settings and accompanying amount of scatter radiation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate both patient and staff exposure during various CTF procedures. Methods and materials: Up to now, 51 studies (31 biopsies, 6 aspirations, 8 drainages and 7 RF-ablations) were evaluated. For every patient, the exposure was quantified by estimating the effective dose (E) and by measuring the skin dose (ESD) with thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD-100). Staff exposure was quantified for each procedure by estimating skin doses at different positions on the body (eyes, thyroid and hands) by using TLD-100H chips. Results: The following median values were determined (data per procedure): patient E (20.6 mSv), patient skin dose (354 mGy), staff ESD (in mGy) at eye level (0.22), thyroid level (0.24), at the left hand (0.17) and at the right hand (0.77). Conclusion: Although CTF patient doses are high compared to doses from standard CT examinations, no skin doses were observed which exceeded the 2 Gy threshold level for transient erythema. From the dosimetric data presented in this study, it is clear that CTF procedures require special attention to patient and staff protection. Actions to reduce the dose in terms of additional protection and limiting the exposure factors are applied.Dose reduction in multislice computed tomography by on-line tube current control W.

Della Chiesa, L. Solbiati; Busto Arsizio/IT Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy of spiral CT examination after bowel distention by means of oral isoosmotic solution (spiral CT enterography) in patients affected with Crohn disease. Methods: We performed 44 spiral CT examinations on 43 patients, of which 32 with suspected or confirmed Crohn disease and 11 as a control group. The degree of bowel loops' distention, obtained with oral administration of 2250 ml of polyethylene glycol electrolyte (PEG) balanced solution, was independently evaluated by two different radiologists. The results of CT enterography in patients with Crohn disease were compared with conventional radiologic studies in 22 cases, with endoscopy in 7 and with surgery in 4. Results: Both observers judged distention of the bowel loops to be adequate in more than 90 % of the patients. Crohn disease was diagnosed by CT in 27 cases, with 43 intestinal localized lesions of the disease. The sensitivity of CT enterography was 92.8 % (95 % if referred to detection of localized lesions), specificity 93.7 % and diagnostic accuracy 93.2 %. Conclusion: This method allows a good distention of the loops, is able to show extraluminal findings and complications of Crohn disease such as fibro-fatty proliferation, phlegmon, abscess, entero-enteric and entero-cutaneous fistulae. CT enterography may therefore be considered as the first choice to evaluate patients with acute or suspected disease.Magnetic resonance enteroclysis comprehensive imaging protocol: Application of HASTE, true FISP and post gadolinium 3D flash with fat saturation sequences N. Papanikolaou, P.K. Prassopoulos, J. Grammatikakis, M. Roussomoustakaki, T.G. Maris, E. Kouroumalis, N. Gourtsoyiannis; Iraklion/GR Purpose: To apply HASTE, true FISP and post-gadolinium fat suppressed 3DFLASH sequences for small bowel imaging with MR Enteroclysis. Materials and methods: Eighteen consecutive patients with suspected small bowel disease underwent MR Enteroclysis examination. HASTE, true FISP and postgadolinium fat suppressed 3D FLASH coronal and axial slices were acquired during breath-holding. A maximum amount of 2 l of iso-osmotic water solution was administered via a nasojejunal catheter. Small bowel distension, conspicuity of the wall, homogeneity of lumen opacification and artifacts presence were evaluated on a 5-point grading scale. Signal to noise ratio (SNR) of normal and thickened intestinal wall and lumen was calculated. Contrast to noise ratio (CNR) of normal intestinal wall -lumen and thickened intestinal wall -lumen were assessed in all. Results: Small bowel distention and wall conspicuity was excellent in all three sequences. True FISP and 3D FLASH sequences provided homogeneous lumen opacification, while HASTE images hampered by intraluminal flow voids, only when antiperistaltic drugs were not used. True FISP sequence was sensitive to susceptibility and black boundary artifacts, while 3D FLASH to motion artifacts. True FISP sequence provided significantly higher (p < 0.01) CNR between the normal intestinal wall and lumen comparing to HASTE and 3D FLASH sequences, while 3D FLASH provided significantly higher (p < 0.01) CNR between thickened wall and lumen comparing to true FISP and HASTE sequences. Conclusion: A comprehensive MRE protocol including true FISP, HASTE and 3D FLASH sequences, can provide integrated information from small bowel lumen, wall and surrounding tissues.Effect of subcutaneous butylscopolamine administration in the reduction of peristaltic artifacts in 1.5 T MR fast abdominal examinations L.

Steiner, G.B. Adam; Hamburg/DE Purpose:To compare the accuracy of MRI in Crohn's disease adopting the MR-Sellink technique with and without jejunal intubation. Materials and methods: 20 patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease were prospectively examined. All patients underwent an enteroclysis. In 10/20 randomized patients ferrooxide was added to the methylcellulose-contrast (MR-Sellink). The other 10/20 patients swallowed 600 ml ferrooxide and 300 ml were administered rectally 1 -3 days following enteroclysis (conventional MRI). MRI was performed adopting T2w HASTE, T2w FSE and T1w GRE sequences. After i.v. administration of Gd-DTPA i.v. (0.1 mmol/kg BW) a 3D GRE (VIBE) and T1w GRE sequence was added. Bowel distension, lesion length, wall thickness, contrast uptake and extraintestinal complications were reviewed independantly by two readers who were blinded to the findings of enteroclysis and surgery if performed. The Cohen's kappa test was used for data analysis. Results: Preliminary data showed a high level of correspondence in diagnosing Crohn's disease by means of enteroclysis, MR-Sellink with and without duodenal intubation. In all patients the diagnostic accuracy of T1w sequences seemed to be significantly higher after intravenous enhancement compared to the unenhanced T1w GRE sequences. Fast T2-w sequences and enhanced T1w sequences at MR-Sellink showed the same accuracy as the contrast enhanced 3D GRE (VIBE) sequence in both groups.Conclusion: MR-examinations with or without intubation revealed comparable diagnostic accuracies.MRI of carcinoid tumors in the gastrointestinal tractT.R. Bader 1 , R.C. Semelka 2 , V.C.Y. Chiu 2 , J.T. Woosley 2 ; 1 Vienna/AT, 2 Chapel Hill, NC/US Purpose: To evaluate the spectrum of MRI appearances of primary gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors. Methods and materials: The MR examinations of 29 patients (11 men, 18 women; age range 33 -87 years) with histologically confirmed gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors were retrospectively reviewed. 12 patients had MR examinations prior to resection or biopsy of the primary tumor (preoperative group), 17 patients were imaged postsurgically (postoperative group). All MR studies were performed at 1.5 T comprising: T1-weighted spoiled gradient echo (SGE), T2-weighted fat-suppressed turbo spin echo, HASTE, and serial postgadolinium T1-weighted SGE sequences without and with fat-suppression. Morphology, signal intensity, and contrast enhancement of primary tumors, and of metastases to the mesentery and peritoneum were evaluated. Results: Primary carcinoid tumors were visualized in 8 of 12 patients (66.7 %). The appearance of primary tumors was a nodular mass originating from bowel wall (4 patients) or regional uniform bowel wall thickening (4 of 12 patients) with moderate intense enhancement on postgadolinium images. In 4 of 12 patients (33.3 %) the primary tumor was prospectively not seen. 9 mesenteric metastases (in 8 patients) were observed presenting as nodular, spiculated masses showing moderate gadolinium enhancement, and were associated with mesenteric stranding in 7 patients. 5 patients showed peritoneal metastases that presented as multiple peritoneal implants demonstrating moderate to intense gadolinium enhancement on early postcontrast images. Conclusion: MRI is a helpful tool for the visualization of carcinoid tumors of the gastrointestinal tract.Spiral CT findings in patients with SMV thrombosis: Correlation with surgeryA. Oto, U.

Stanley, P. Forouhi, A. Welsh; London/GB Aim: To determine the potential of a new method of demonstrating breast tumour vascularization using 3-dimensional ultrasound imaging techniques. Methods: Combined greyscale and colour Doppler volume data sets images have been obtained freehand from over 400 patients, using the 15 MHz transducer on the Acuson Sequoia system. Data sets are processed using in house software and the VoxBlast TM software to produce 3D combined semi-transparent greyscale/ colour split blocks. Results: 124 lesions (59 fibroadenomas, 24 cancers, 14 inflammatory masses, and 19 other benign conditions) have been reviewed so far. External and internal vascular morphology is better demonstrated using split 3D views of grey scale and vascular information than in either 2D images, 3D vascular only or transparent 3D block images. Enumeration of vessels in, around and within lesions is now possible. Combined greyscale and vascular information permits immediate accurate assessment of the relationship of vessels to the lesion. The radial feeding vessels and chaotic distribution of vessels within cancers is more easily appreciated. The marginal distribution of vessels in vascular fibroadenomas allows more diagnostic certainty. All cancers had suspicious features and over half of the fibroadenomas had definite benign features on 3D images alone. Diagnostic accuracy of these 3D images in combination with real time grey scale and colour Doppler examination is currently being assessed. Conclusions: These initial results already show that the 3-dimensional ultrasound angiographic techniques described demonstrate vascular morphology of breast lesions more accurately than heretofore.Does real-time compound imaging improve evaluation of breast cancer compared to conventional sonography? B. Seo, Y. Oh, H. Noh, J. Lee, N. Lee, J. Kim, S. Kim; Seoul/KR Purpose: Real-time compound imaging obtains multiple coplanar tomographic ultrasound images and combines them into a single compound image, reducing acoustic artefacts and noise. The purpose of this study is to determine if real-time compound imaging improves evaluation of breast cancer compared to conventional sonography. Materials and methods: 25 breast cancers were included in this study from May 2000 to July 2001. 22 of 25 patients were invasive ductal carcinoma and the remaining three were DCIS. Each image pair consisted of a conventional ultrasound and a real-time compound image with a stationary probe, to maintain an identical Real-time compound imaging improves contrast, margin, internal echotexture and internal microcalcification of the breast cancer.

Methods and materials: MRI examinations with combined endorectal-body phased-array coil were performed in 27 patients with biopsy proven prostate carcinoma before surgery (1.0 T Magnetom Harmony, Siemens, Germany). After multiplanar T2-and T1-weighted MR imaging dMRI was performed using a fast dynamic T1-weighted turbo-FLASH sequence (TR/TE 1300/4.2 ms; TI = 654 ms; 10 slices, 4 mm slice thickness) during and after administration of 1 mmol/kg Gd-DTPA (22 repetitions). For image processing a pharmacokinetic 2-compartment model calculating for contrast enhancement (A) and contrast exchange rate (k21) was used on an independent workstation. Microvessels were stained using a CD31 monoclonal antibody (DAKO, Hamburg, Germany). The microvessel density (MVD) was quantified on surgical specimens by (a) counting microvessels in 3 high power fields and (b) determining the area fraction (%) of microvessels by morphometry (Leica, Bensheim, Germany) in 5 high power fields. In corresponding anatomic locations on MR images the mean A and k21 values were calculated and correlated to MVD. Results: MVD in tumour tissue was significantly higher than in surrounding nontumour tissue (p < 0.0001). The number of microvessels correlated with the area fraction (p < 0.0001). Area fraction and number of MVD were both significantly correlated to k21 (r = 0.80, p < 0.0001 and r = 0.62, p < 0.0001, respectively). No association was found between A and MVD. Conclusion: DMRI has the potential to indicate tumour neovascularization and may be important for the individual therapy management of prostate cancer patients.Non-invasive prostate cancer staging: A combined approach of T2weighted and parametrically analysed dynamic T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging B.N.

Results: On T2-weighted images tumour size and multicentricity (5/15 in the central and transitional zone, 1/15 in the peripheral zone) were underestimated in 6/15 cases. On dynamic T1-weighted images 2/15 cases (1/15 peripheral zone, 1/15 central zone) were underestimated and 3/15 cases overestimated (1/15 infiltration of seminal vesicles, 2/15 extracapsular disease). The combined evaluation of both sequences allowed an accurate tumour staging in all 15 cases. Conclusion: A combined approach of T2-and dynamic T1-weighted MRI is a reliable and non-invasive method for prostate cancer staging. Especially in the central and transitional zone of the prostate dynamic imaging facilitates accurate tumour localization.MR imaging of prostate cancer: Comparison of staging performance using pelvic phased-array and integrated endorectal pelvic phased-array coils J.J. F\u00fctterer, M.R.W. Engelbrecht, G.J. Jager, J.J.M.C. De La Rosette, J.G. Blickman; Nijmegen/NLPurpose: To compare staging performance and anatomical detail using pelvic phased-array coil (PPA), integrated endorectal pelvic phased-array coil (ERC-PPA) and dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (dynMRI) in prostate cancer. Methods and materials: MRI was performed on 37 patients with prostate cancer, prior to radical prostatectomy on a 1.5 T scanner. T2-w FSE (axial views) images of the prostate were obtained using (1) PPA, (2) ERC-PPA and (3) T1-w GRE images using dynamic MRI. FSE scanning parameters were TR/TE: 4400/132, fa: 180\u00b0, fov: 28 cm. DynMRI parameters were TR/TE: 50Using ERC-PPA coil results in significant improvement of anatomic detail. Specificity increases significantly from 51 % to 96 % (p < 0.008) being important in order to reduce overstaging.",

Kurhanewicz 2 ;Munich/DE, 2 San Francisco, CA/US Combined MRI and 3D-MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) can be adapted for patients on hormone therapy (HT) for locally confined prostate cancer (PCA), such that diagnostic accuracy is equal to patients with untreated PCA. MRI/MRSI was used to determine prostate volume and tumour load in patients on HT for PCA. Three cohorts underwent MRI/MRSI prior to and during therapy consisting of either watchful waiting (WW, n = 7, follow-up 3 months), or short-term HT (n = 13, follow-up 3 months), or long-term HT (n = 14, follow-up 9 months). Prostate volume (total gland TG, central gland CG, peripheral zone PZ) was determined by planimetry in axial, T2-weighted MR images. Tumour load was calculated as (No. of PZ sextants with tumour at both MRI and MRSI)\u00d7 (% of PZ sextant with tumour at MRI)\u00d7 (PZ sextant volume at MRI).Prostate volume (TG, CG, PZ) and tumour load decreased significantly during HT (short-term, p = 0.0029 to 0.0007; long-term, p = 0.0041 to 0.0001, paired T-test). TG and PZ increased by 1.5 cm 3 during WW (p = 0.04 to 0.02), while CG and tumour load were unchanged. Tumour load decreased more than PZ volume during long-term HT (p = 0.02, Wilcoxon test), but not during short-term HT.In conclusion, prostate volume and tumour load decrease significantly during HT for PCA. Selective decrease of tumour load relative to prostate size appears to be a feature of long-term HT.Local staging of prostate cancer using magnetic resonance imaging; a meta-analysis M.R.W. Engelbrecht, G.J. Jager, R. Laheij, H. Van Lier, A. Verbeek, J.O. Barentsz; Nijmegen/NL Purpose: To determine the influence of patient, study design, and imaging protocol characteristics on staging performance of magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer. Materials and methods: Electronic literature search and review of bibliographies(January 1984 to May 2000. Articles selected included data on sensitivity and specificity of local staging. Subgroup analyses examined the influence of age, prostate specific antigen, tumour grade, hormonal pre-treatment, stage distribution, publication year, department of origin, verification bias, time between biopsy and MR imaging; consensus reading, study design, consecutive patients, sample size, histology preparation, imaging planes, fast spin echo, fat suppression, endorectal coil, field-strength, resolution, glucagon, contrast agents, MR spectroscopy and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. Results: 71 articles and 5 abstracts were included, yielding 146 studies. Missing values were highly prevalent for patient characteristics and study design. Publication year, sample size, histological gold standard, number of imaging planes, turbo spin echo, endorectal coil and contrast agents influenced staging performance (p \u2264 0.05). Conclusions: Due to poor reporting, it was not possible to fully explain the heterogeneity of performance presented in the literature. Our results suggest that turbo spin echo, endorectal coil and multiple imaging planes improve staging performance. Studies with small sample sizes may result in higher staging performance.Trans perineal prostate brachytherapy: Comparison of CT vs MRI in the evaluation of prostate volume, and radioactive seeds identification A. Zanello, F. De Cobelli, A. De Gaspari, P. Mangili, N. Di Muzio, A. Del Maschio; Milan/IT Purpose:To compare CT and MRI in the assessment of prostate volume, localization of radioactive seeds and urethra after transperineal prostate brachytherapy. Role of CT and different pulse sequences on MRI. Materials and methods: 15 consecutive patients treated with transperineal interstitial permanent prostate brachytherapy were evaluated (within 3 weeks after implant). Contrast-enhanced helical CT and plain MR (1.5 T, phased-array coils; FSE T2w and SPGR T1w seq.) examinations were conducted in the same session with the same longitudinal coordinates. CT and MRI were separately evaluated by 2 radiologists in order to delineate prostate contour and to identify radioactive seeds. Results: Prostate volume and calculated isodose curves derived from CT, were not statistically different from those calculated with MRI. FSE T2w images were useful to identify prostate volumes, while SPGR T1w images easily identified radioactive sources; both are useful to identify urethra. Conclusions: MRI (FSE T2w + SPGR T1w seq.) is an effective method to evaluate the results of interstitial brachytherapy. It is fast (10 -15 minutes) with almost the same cost (180 USD vs 160 USD) as CT; in this particular case MRI doesn't need i.v. contrast media. So, MRI can sobstitute CT to evaluate patients referred to prostate interstitial brachytherapy.Multicentre randomised comparison of two imaging policies in the management of low back pain: The Scottish back trial F.J. Gilbert, M.G.C. Gillan, M.K. Campbell, N.W. Scott, A.M. Grant, L. Vale, D. Wardlaw, D.J. Knight, the Scottish Back Trial Group; Aberdeen/GBPurpose: The aim of The Scottish Back Trial was to determine whether early use of MRI or CT influences clinical management and outcome of patients with LBP and whether it is cost-effective. Study design: Eligible patients were those with symptomatic lumbar spine disorders (without 'red flags') who were new referrals to orthopaedic or neurosurgeons. Patients giving informed consent, were randomised to 'early imaging' (imaging as soon as possible) or 'delayed, selective imaging' (imaging only if an imperative clinical indication developed). Principal outcome measures were the SF-36, the Aberdeen LBP scale and the EQ-5D. Patients completed questionnaires at trial entry and after 8 and 24 months. Healthcare resource was determined from hospital case notes. Results: From 15 hospitals, 782 patients were recruited and randomised. Both groups received similar clinical management. An improvement in health status was reported by both groups as measured by the SF-36 and the Aberdeen LBP scale with a small but statistically significant difference on the Aberdeen LBP scale in favour of 'early imaging' (P = 0.002) but no difference in SF-36 except a marginal improvement in the bodily pain subscale. Conclusion: For this group of LBP patients, imaging did not significantly affect clinical management. The clinical importance of the slight improvement in health is uncertain. The healthcare resource use in relation to patient outcome has to be judged against other health interventions.The trial was funded by the NHS Research & Development Health Technology Assessment Programme.

Jenner, R.J.C. Laing, A.K. Dixon; Cambridge/GB Purpose: To investigate patients' symptoms and experiences of early Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis and management of chronic low back pain.Methods and materials: 168 patients with chronic back pain referred from primary to secondary care consented to be randomised into 2 groups; the first group underwent MRI before seeing a specialist at an outpatient appointment; the second underwent routine clinical evaluation which determined the need for subsequent imaging. We compared patient satisfaction and quality of life between groups. Results: Preliminary data shows that these two groups had similar mean baseline Roland Back Pain scores (MRI: 14.4, non-MRI: 14.66. Both groups had improved scores at 6 months, in fact there was slightly less improvement in the MRI group (to 12.3, 14.5 % clinical improvement) than the non-MR group (to 11.42, 22.1 % clinical improvement) although this difference did not reach statistical significance. Patient satisfaction with their health care was broadly similar, with 61.2 % of the MR group being very/satisfied compared with 57.1 % in the non-MR group. Conclusion: Early MRI makes little difference to the overall health status of the patient or in their satisfaction with the service provided.",

Mallarini; Cagliari/IT Purpose: US harmonic imaging enhances visualization of body structures in difficult patients compared with conventional fundamental imaging (FI). Its role during fetal US imaging is not well established yet. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the role of harmonic imaging in fetal US, in an outpatient clinic setting. Materials and methods: In the period January to September 2001 we performed US obstetric examination in 300 women, as part of standard controls. The examiners acquired the same number of images of fetal organs with fundamental and second harmonic imaging. The investigation time was also recorded for the two different methods. Image quality was subsequently graded independently. Results: Harmonic imaging improved overall fetal heart visualization in all patients, resulting in a modified diagnosis in 14 %, resulting also in lower examination time and diminished recall rate. Image quality was considered better with harmonic imaging, with a statistically significant difference. Conclusion: Second harmonic imaging allowed the visualization of finer details in fetal US, and the easiness of application resulted in a shorter examination time. It was the examination of choice in difficult patients (oligoidramnios, obese, etc).Effect of fetal MRI on cardiotocographic parameters of the unbornS.C.A. Michel, A. Rake, T.M. Keller, V. K\u00f6nig, B. Marincek, R.A. Kubik-Huch; Z\u00fcrich/CH Purpose: To determine whether fetal MRI has any effect on cardiotocographic (CTG) parameters or fetal movement. Materials and methods: MR pelvimetry (T1w FSGPR) and fetal MRI(T2w SSFSE)were performed on six pregnant women (mean 34 weeks GA) on a 1.5 T GE system. Fetal heart rate (FHR) was measured before, during, and after MRI. A technical modification of a standard Doppler ultrasound-based monitor made it possible to reduce interference and distortion in the MR images to acceptable levels, rendering the examinations diagnostic. Maternal heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature were recorded, and fetal movements were counted. A manual analysis of FHR was performed, and basal FHR and short-term variations were calculated. Results: The mean basal FHR was 131 beats/min before, 135 beats/min during, and 128 beats/min after MRI. Short-term variation was in the normal range for all CTG-tracings. Fetal movements did not increase during MRI. Maternal blood pressure and body temperature were not influenced by the examination. Conclusion: Using technically modified standard equipment, cardiotocographic monitoring of the fetus during MRI is feasible. MRI at 1.5 T does not affect fetal heart activity or fetal movement.Colour Doppler evaluation of ureteral jets in normal second and third trimester pregnancy: Effect of patient position N. Karabulut, A. Karabulut; Denizli/TR Purpose: The study was designed to investigate the effects of patient position on the detection of ureteral jets in normal pregnancy. Materials and methods: The number of jets was recorded for one minute with colour Doppler sonography in 26 healthy asymptomatic gravid women between 16 and 34 weeks' gestation. Each patient was examined in the supine and both in right and left lateral decubitus positions. Results: Ureteral jets were present at least on one side in 24 patients in the supine position versus in 26 women in the lateral decubitus position. Of 24 patients in whom jets were seen in the supine position, 13 (54 %) had jets at only one side. A mean of 1.80 jets/minute was detected on the right, and 3.23 jets/minute on the left (p = 0.046) in the supine position. In the contralateral decubitus position, jets were detected on the right in 22 (84 %) women, and on the left in 25 (96 %) participants. A mean of 3.07 jets/minute on the right and 4.15 jets/minute on the left were re-corded. The difference in the frequency of ureteral jets between supine and lateral decubitus positions was significant (p = 0.004 for the right, and p = 0.011 for the left). Of 13 patients in whom unilateral absence of ureteral jets was noted, 10 (77 %) had detectable jets in the lateral decubitus position. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated the utility of lateral decubitus position in the evaluation ureter suspicious for obstruction. However, caution is still recommended in diagnosing ureteral obstruction if jets are persistently absent after this manoeuvre.MR assessment of fetal lung development using measurements of lung signal intensities and volumesT.M. Keller, A. Rake, S.C.A. Michel, B. Seifert, N. Teodorovic, S. Wildermuth, B. Marincek, R.A. Kubik-Huch; Z\u00fcrich/CH Purpose:The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of MR in the assessment of fetal lung development and in the diagnosis of pulmonary pathology by measuring signal intensity and fetal lung volume changes at different stages of gestation. Methods: 18 fetuses (22 -39 weeks of gestation) were examined once on a 1.5 T GE system using T2w single shot fast spin echo imaging. 7 fetuses were scanned at 25, 30, and 35 weeks of gestation for a longitudinal assessment of lung development. Ratios of the signal intensities (SI) of fetal lung and liver as well as amniotic fluid and maternal muscle were calculated. Fetal body, lung and liver were segmented manually, and volumes were calculated. Estimated volumes were correlated with gestational age. Data of 3 fetuses with lung pathology (2 adenoidcystic malformations, 1 lung sequester) were compared with the normative data. Results: Fetal lung volume varied from 15 to 179 cm 3 , the relative lung volume expressed as a percentage of the fetal body volume showed a range from 2.1 % to 4.9 % and decreased with gestational age (p < 0.01). Fetal lung and liver volume correlated well with gestational age (p < 0.01). The SI ratios of fetal lung to maternal muscle and amniotic fluid showed no change while the SI ratios of fetal liver to fetal lung, maternal muscle and amniotic fluid decreased with gestational age (p < 0.01). Conclusion: MR normative data of fetal lung signal intensity and volume may have important clinical applications in the confirmation and quantification of fetal pulmonary hypoplasia.MRI of fetal pathologiesT.M.

Zanardi 1 , C. Zuiani 1 , C. Del Frate 1 , G. Del Frate 2 , M. Bazzocchi 1 ; 1 Udine/IT, San Daniele del Friuli/IT Purpose: To introduce MR staging of pelvic endometriosis in comparison with the AFS laparoscopic staging. and methods: 30 consecutive females, with clinically suspected endometriosis, underwent MR examination using TSE T1, T2W, and SE FAT-SAT T1W sequences demonstrating the presence of endometriomas and pelvic implants. Laparoscopy was performed within one week. Two radiologists independently evaluated the presence of endometriomas and implants, and calculated a score classifying endometriosis in four categories, comparable with those of AFS laparoscopic staging. The MR score was based on size, edge, parietal thickness, segmentations, signal intensity on T2W images of endometriomas and presence of pelvic implants. Results: Laparoscopy confirmed 38/39 endometriomas, ranging in size from 1 to 11 cm, detected by MR, with only one false positive due to a hemorrhagic corpusluteum. Nevertheless, 2 intraovaric endometriomas were detected by laparoscopy only due to MR guidance. Implants were discovered in 17/30 patients with MR, laparoscopically in 18/30. MR detected 42 endometrial implants out of 52 detected by laparoscopy (80.8 %). 13/42 were directly confirmed by laparoscopy, 29/42 were confirmed depending on the presence of adhesions. Regarding endometriosis staging, concordance between the MR and AFS classification was obtained in 29/30 patients (96.6 %) with only one case of discordance. Conclusions: Although MR has limitations such as suboptimal depiction of small implants and adhesions, this technique is very useful as guidance for laparoscopy. Moreover the optimal concordance (96.6 %) between the MR staging purposed on this work and laparoscopic staging demonstrates a new advantage of MR in preoperative staging of endometriosis. 3D MR vs conventional X-ray hysterosalpingography in the evaluation of female infertility F.

Millischer, O. H\u00e9l\u00e9non, Y. Menu; Paris/FR Purpose: To describe the variation of MRI features of deep endometriosis according to localization.Methods and materials: Preoperative MRI were reviewed in 140 patients with deep endometriosis. All patients had sagittal and axial fast T2 and T1-weighted spin echo (SE) sequences with a phased-array coil. 45 patients had additional examination with an endocavitary coil. Visibility, signal intensity, size and contour of the lesions were analysed. Results: 173 lesions were diagnosed by surgery and pathology: uterosacral ligaments (USL n = 112), recto-vaginal wall (RVW n = 25), visceral endometriosis (VE n = 20) and bladder endometriosis (BE n = 16). MRI detected all bladder and rectovaginal lesions. Bladder endometriosis lesions were heterogeneous and hyperintense on T1 and T2 images. Conversely, RVW lesions were hypointense as compared to myometrium (n = 25). Sensitivity of MRI for detection of USL and VE lesions was 71 % and 70 % respectively. Abnormal USL were larger (> 9 mm) than normal USL (< 7 mm). Nodular contour was found in all abnormal USL and in none of normal USL. Most of USL and VE lesions were hypointense on T1 and T2 images (LUS n = 65/80), (VE n = 15/20). Only 25 % of the posterior lesions (USL, RVW, VE) showed hyperintense spots. Conclusion: Although deep endometriosis may be found in most compartments of the pelvis, appearance of the lesion may differ according to localization. Signal intensity is variable with localization of the lesions: posterior lesions are more likely to be hypointense in T1 and T2 images. Knowledge of this particularity may prevent the radiologist from overlooking posterior lesions.",

Hollenbach 2 ; 1 Nuremberg/DE, 2 Erlangen/DE Purpose: Presentation of preliminary experience of a whole-body MRI technique with a moving table as a screening tool for metastases in patients with breast cancer. Material and methods: 17 patients with breast carcinoma underwent both a planar whole body bone scintigraphy and whole-body MRI at 1.5 T. MRI images were performed with an automatically moving table at 5 different anatomical positions within a measurement time of 20 minutes. Coronal images were acquired using a STIR sequence from head to the feet, accomplished by an axial T2-weighted TSE sequence through the head and a T1-eighted opposed-phase sagittal Flash-2D sequence covering the whole spine. Findings of bone scintigraphy and MRI were compared with respect to the consideration that metastases were absent or present. Each examination was graded into three categories: benign, uncertain origin or malignant on a standardized evaluation sheet. Metastatic lesions were confirmed by follow up over one year including diagnostic follow-up procedures.Results: Whole-body MRI was superior to bone scintigraphy in predicting lesion dignity with a sensitivity of 86 % (bone scintigraphy: 86 %), a specificity of 90 % (scintigraphy: 70 %) and an accuracy of 88 % (scintigraphy: 76 %). Whole-body MRI showed additional findings as metastases of the brain. lung and liver. Conclusions: Whole-body MRI with a moving table technique may represent a convenient and fast method of total body screening for metastases in patients with breast carcinoma, esspecially in women with high risk of distant metastatic disease.Breath-hold fast recovery optimized fast spin echo pulse sequence: Comparison with breath-hold half-Fourier and non breath-hold respiratory triggered fast spin echo pulse sequences for T2-weighted liver MR imaging J. Augui, O. Vignaux, C. Argaud, J. Coste, H. Gouya, P. Legmann; Paris/FR Purpose: To evaluate breath-hold Fast Recovery (BHFR) fast spin echo (FSE) magnetic resonance (MR) pulse sequence for T2-weighted MR imaging of the liver. Materials and methods: The addition of Fast Recovery to a FSE imaging technique was developed to provide an improved T2 weighting and signal compared with a conventional FSE sequence and to allow full liver coverage in two breath holds. Quantitative and qualitative characteristics of images obtained prospectively in 38 patients were compared with those provided by a conventional respiratory-triggered FSE sequence and by a breath-hold single shot half-Fourier fast spin echo sequence (SSFSE). Results: The mean signal-to-noise ratio for liver and contrast-to-noise ratio for hepatic lesions were significantly higher with BHFR than with respiratory-triggered FSE (p < 0.01) while they were comparable between both breath-hold techniques. BHFR images enabled significatively better lesion conspicuity than SSFSE (p < 0.05) and displayed less image artifacts than respiratory-triggered FSE sequence (p < 0.02). Lesion sizing and overall image quality were improved with BHFR sequence compared with SSFSE and non breath-hold FSE pulse sequences (p < 0.02). Conclusion: Our results may validate the use of the BHFR technique for first line T2-weighted MR imaging of the liver.",

Horgan; Glasgow/GB Purpose: To assess the hepatic haemodynamic changes associated with liver tumours using functional MR. Methods: 36 patients with proven focal hepatic lesions (22 metastases and 14 patients with benign haemangiomas) were studied using Philips Gyroscan (1.5 T). Dynamic contrast enhanced (2 ml of Omniscan and 20 ml of saline at 2 ml/s) scan using 2D-FFE sequence with single transverse slice (20 mm) was performed through the liver. Data acquisition over a period of 100 seconds was subsequently recorded for quantification analysis. Time-intensity curves were derived from regions of interests placed over the liver and aorta. Peak enhancement (PE), time to peak (TP) & gradient (G) of the steepest portion of the curve for the liver and peak aortic enhancement (PA) were measured. Results: There was no significant difference in the TP, G and PA indices between the benign and malignant group. However there was a significant increase in the PE in presence of malignancy (metastases vs haemangiomas: 371 \u00b1 176 vs 193 \u00b1 53; p < 0.0001). PE to PA ratio was also significantly raised in patients with metastases. Conclusion: These preliminary data suggest that altered hepatic haemaodynamic changes associated with malignancy can be assessed using functional MR; Further refinements in the technique are still required.Safety of mangafodipir administration at abdominal MR imaging: Bolus injection vs. slow infusionC.

Herold; Vienna/AT Purpose: To assess the safety of the liver-specific MR contrast agent mangafodipir (Teslascan\u00ae) administered as a bolus in comparison with slow infusion. Materials and methods: 112 patients with suspected liver lesions underwent MRI at 1.5 T (Siemens Vision; Philips ACS-NT). In 59 patients (25 m, 34 f; mean age 55.2 a), mangafodipir (dosage of 5 \u00b5mol/kg) was administered as an IV bolus injection (18 ml/min) over 1.4 -2.8 min. In a control group of 53 patients (30 m, 23 f; mean age 53.4 a), mangafodipir was administered as a slow infusion over 10 -20 min, at the clinically approved rate. The rates of patient discomfort and adverse events after contrast administration were assessed. Examination times of both study protocols were evaluated. Results: There was patient discomfort after contrast administration in 33.9 % of the bolus injection and 32.1 % of the slow infusion control group (not significant). Mild to moderate adverse events were observed in 6.8 % of the rapid injection and 3.8 % of the control group (n. s.). Mean MR examination time was 41.2 min (bolus) and 45.1 min (control group) (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Bolus administration of mangafodipir does not increase the rate of patient discomfort or adverse events in comparison to the approved slow infusion, but it may speed up the examination.Parallel imaging (SENSE) improves VIBE sequences for dynamic contrast MR studies of the liver M.

MR Philips) using a T2w 3D TSE (TR/eTE: 1800/500 ms, ETL: 130, 0.6 mm, 80 slices, 256, TA: 4 min 12 s). VE images were reconstructed using volume rendering technique and interpreted together with overall examination images (MIP reconstructions, source images). Correlations with conventional endoscopy and pathological findings. Results: Operator time: 20 min. MR sequences, as well as reconstructed images, missed stones inferior to 3 mm in size. VE depicted all stones superior to 4 mm. Among 10 calculi, ranged from 4 to 8 mm, detected on VE, source images and conventional T2w, 3 (4 and 5 mm, respectively) were invisible on MIP. Tumoral stenosis presented an irregular and asymetric pattern on endoluminal views. Morphologic assessment (smooth or irregular surface, location and extension in surface of tumoral filling defects) was better seen on VE than on source images. A smooth surface with abrupt margins was present in all cases of stones. With the surface structure alone, the differentiation between a calculus from a smooth polypoid tumor was impossible. Conclusions: VE is simple to realise, more accurate than MIP for identification of calculi. It allows an interesting evaluation of the morphology of a common duct stenosis. But to detect calculi, source images and conventional T2-weighted sequence are mandatory and essential for diagnosis.Virtual MR cholangioscopy: Feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of MRCP combined with endoluminal views K.A.J. Hellerhoff, S. Aratma, T. R\u00f6sch, T.M. Link, E.J. Rummeny; Munich/DE Purpose:To evaluate the feasibility of virtual MR-endoscopy (VMRE) of the biliary tract on the basis of MR-cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) data sets and to determine the diagnostic benefit combining MRCP with endoluminal views using ERCP as a standard of reference. Methods and materials: 31 patients were examined at 1.5 T with a respiratory triggered 3D TSE sequence. For VMRE intraluminal views were generated by volume rendering. Multiplanar reformations of MRCP alone vs multiplanar reformations and VMRE were compared with the ERCP findings. Results: Virtual reconstructions of the common bile duct (CBD), the common hepatic duct and right and left hepatic duct were feasible in 30/31 patients. The final diagnoses was: bile duct stones (n = 7), bile duct strictures (n = 19) and normal bile duct (n = 4). Using endoluminal views in addition to MRCP images did not alter the sensitivity for choledocholithiasis (71 %). One of two false positives using MRCP (specificity 91 %) was assessed as normal using the endoluminal reconstructions (specificity 96 %). For the detection and localization of bile duct stenosis with MRCP the sensitivity and specificity was 100 %. With VMRE 15/19 bile duct strictures were depicted. 4 cases of prepapillary stenosis could not be differentiated from the intrapapillary end of the bile duct. Conclusion: The additional use of VMRE did not improve the sensitivity in the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis. MRCP was superior to VMRE in depicting CBD stenosis, especially in the distal portion of the duct. VMRE therefore can not yet be recommended for the routine work-up of the biliary tract.Imaging patients with post-cholecystectomy syndrome (PCS): An algorithmic approach O.A. Terhaar, S. Abbas, F.J. Thornton, D. Duke, K. Abdulla, J.C. Varghese, M.J. Lee; Dublin/IE Purpose: To evaluate the role of MRC, US, LFT's and ERCP in patients with PCS. Method and materials: 57 patients (M:F, 15:42; age 33 -92 years; mean age 62) with PCS referred for diagnostic ERCP, had MRC and abdominal US performed.The interval from cholecystectomy ranged from 1 -600 months. MR (1.5 T; GE) images were obtained using a T2W (TR/TE; 11000/272) 2D-FSE multislice technique (18 \u00d7 3 mm, coronal and axial slices, FOV 20 -24 cm, matrix size 256 \u00d7 128, ETL 32, NEX 1 -3). Images were correlated with LFT's, ultrasound and ERCP findings. Results: 18 (32 %) patients had final diagnosis of choledocholithiasis. 1 patient had a biliary stricture. 16 patients had unrelated diagnoses made and 22 had no cause for pain identified. Ultrasound identified CBD stones in 5 of 18 patients (28 %), all of whom had dilated CBD's (\u2265 10 mm). ERCP failed in 11 Patients, five of whom had stones while MRC identified 17 patients with stones (94 %). The CBD was dilated on US (\u2265 10 mm) in 17 patients, 10 of whom had stones. A dilated CBD (\u2265 10 mm) had a PPV of 59 % for choledocholithiasis whilst a normal calibre CBD (< 10 mm). had a NPV of 90 %. The overall accuracy of US was 76 % which increased to 80 % when LFT's were analyzed. Conclusion: Sonography remains the first line test in PCS. The Accuracy of US is marginally increased when LFT's are analyzed. In patients with CBD size of (< 10 mm) on US further MRC/ERC is not warranted. MRC should be performed in patients with a dilated CBD on US (\u2265 10 mm).Erroneous diagnosis of intraductal papillary mucinous tumorsof the pancreas (IPMT): Frequency, type and pathologic correlation M.

Semelka 2 ; 1 Vienna/AT, Chapel Hill, NC/US Purpose: To evaluate the appearance of infectious cholangitis on MRI. Methods and materials: The MR images of 13 patients (9 women, 4 men; age range, 14 -79 years) with clinically confirmed infectious cholangitis were retrospectively evaluated. All MR studies were performed at 1.5 T including: in-phase and out-of-phase T1-weighted spoiled gradient echo (SGE), T2-weighted fat-suppressed echo train spin echo, single shot T2-weighted sequences, and serial postgadolinium T1-weighted SGE sequences without and with fat-suppression. The biliary ductal system was evaluated regarding presence of dilatation, steno-sis, wall irregularities, wall thickening, and gadolinium enhancement of duct walls. The liver parenchyma was evaluated regarding focal signal abnormalities on precontrast and serial postgadolinium images. Results: Biliary ductal dilatation was observed in 100 % of patients. Mild to moderate thickening of bile duct walls combined with increased enhancement on postgadolinium images was observed in 92 % of patients. The liver parenchyma showed periportal or wedge-shaped areas of hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images in 69 % of patients. On T1-weighted images, 54 % of patients showed areas of hypointense signal and 15 % of patients showed wedge-shaped hyperintense areas. Areas with increased enhancement on immediate postgadolinium SGE were observed in 58 % of patients, and in 42 % of patients increased enhancement persisted on 2 minute postgadolinium fat-suppressed images. Conclusion: Infectious cholangitis demonstrates characteristic MRI findings on pre-and postgadolinium images.CT-cholangiography after intravenous injection of iodinated biliarycontrast agent F.J. Gonz\u00e1lez, C. Juanco, R. Landeras, M. Ruiz, M. L\u00f3pez, M. Silv\u00e1n; Santander/ESPurpose: Spiral CT cholangiography (sCTC) has received little attention but it is capable of yield high resolution images and functional imaging regarding the biliary tree. This study evaluates the role of sCTC in the diagnosis of biliary tree anatomy and diseases comparing with other diagnosis technique. Method/materials: We briefly review the examination technique, indications, limitations and interpretation pitfalls of sCTC. The studies were performed after infusion with 50 ml intravenous iodinated biliary agent (Meglumine Iotroxato, Bilisegrol, Schering AG) diluted in 100 ml saline. Examination delay raged from 40 to 120 minutes after injection depending on bilirubin seric level. sCTC studies were performed with 3 mm collimation (1 mm reconstruction interval/pitch 1.5). The sets of source images were used to generate 2D and 3D (MIP and Surface) reformations. We compared the results with other diagnosis modalities (Ultrasound, MR cholangiography and CPRE) being CPRE and surgery the standar references. Results: Opacification of the biliary tree was considered optimal for diagnosis in 98 % of cases with a good evaluation of biliary anathomy and congenital variants. SCTC showed a good sensitivity (94 %) to detect common duct biliary stones and biliary stenosis. It was a good technique to evaluate the patency of biliodigestive anastomoses and biliary leaks. Its was also useful to evaluate biliary tree complications in liver trasplantation. Dinamic evaluation of biliary excretion is an important information that this method add comparing with other diagnosis modalities. Conclusions: SCTC is a good noninvasive method to evaluate biliary tree with a good diagnosis capability.Evaluation of pancreas divisum with CT cholangiopancreatography after secreatin stimulation: Comparison with MR cholangiopancreatographyS. Kiryu, M. Minami, M. Akahane, N. Yoshioka, H. Koga, M. Watanabe, I. Nakajima, K. Ohtomo; Tokyo/JP Purpose:The purpose of this study is to assess the diagnostic performance of CT cholangiopancreatography (CTCP) after secretine stimulation compared with MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). Methods: 84 patients suspected of having pancreatic diseases were studied with CTCP and MRCP. CTCP was performed with multi-detector row CT. Two minutes after administration of secretine, dynamic CT was performed 45 seconds after injecting iodinated contrast material at rate of 3 ml/s. Sections were obtained using 2.5 mm detector row and pitch of 3. The images were reconstructed at 1.25 mm interval using 24 cm field of view. Minimum intensity projection images of the pancreas head were obtained by selecting an oblique slab that contained the main pancreas duct and common bile duct. MRCP was performed with a 1.5 T unit. Multiple oblique coronal images were obtained using two-dimensional heavily T2weighted single shot fast spin-echo sequence; TR/TE \u221e/1100 ms; section slice, 35 -45 mm; field of view, 25 -35 cm. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed in all patients as gold standard.Results: There was no complication induced by secretine stimulation. Nine patients were confirmed to have pancreas divisum by ERCP. CTCP depicted eight of the nine patients before ERCP. MRCP depicted all of the nine patients. However, one patient having anomalous arrangement of the pancreaticobiliary duct was diagnosed to have pancreas divisum by both CTCP and MRCP. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of CTCP were 88.9 %, 98.7 % and 97.6 %, while those of MRCP were 100 %, 98.7 % and 98.8 %.Conclusions: CTCP showed high accuracy in the diagnosis of pancreas divisum compared with MRCP.

Maroldi; Brescia/IT Purpose: To describe the spectrum of radiological characteristics of this rare opportunistic pneumonia in HIV+ patients. Methods & materials: From January 1992 to March 2001, 18 HIV+ patients withRhodococcus Equi infection (isolated from blood or sputum) were identified. All patients were free of concomitant infections. The clinical signs consisted in a sub-acute onset of respiratory symptoms and fever. All patients had chest X-ray examination within 3 days of bacterial isolation. Location, type and evolution of each radiological finding were evaluated. CT was performed in 9/18 patients. Results: 16/18 patients had persistent or progressive parenchimal abnormalities at chest X-ray. The chest X-ray findings in all patients were that of large dense areas of pulmonary consolidation, most of them with cavitations (10/16; 62.5 %). Upper lobe, or superior segments of the lower lobe, prevalence was noted. CT confirmed radiological findings and revealed 1 more cavitation and two cases of peribronchial dissemination. Pleural effusion (2/16 cases) and lymphadenopathy (2/16) were not common findings. Follow-up examinations showed a long term persistence of consolidations in most patients. Conclusions: Rhodococcus equi pneumonia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary cavitary lesions in HIV+ patients. Knowledge of the clinical and imaging features of this infection may help suggest a particular diagnosis.Are technetium-DTPA pulmonary clearance studies of value in the diagnosis of radiation pneumonitis?

Weiler, M. Thelen, H.-U. Kauczor; Mainz/DEPurpose: Previous studies demonstrated that different pulmonary time constants (Tc) can be differentiated by dynamic-CT. Goal was the first application of this novel technique in patients with early ARDS for optimization of ventilatory pattern. Methods: In patients with ARDS and diffuse infiltrates on the chest radiograph a multislice-CT was performed. If there were signs of atelectasis or early ARDS, a dynamic-chest-CT serie was performed with the following parameters: slicethickness of 1 mm, collimation of 0.5 mm, reconstructionincrement of 0.1 mm resulting in a temporal resolution of 350 ms. For assessment of pulmonary Tc, a step-up in airway pressure from 0 to 40 cm H2O was performed during dynamic-CT acquisition. For planimetrical calculation of areas of defined density ranges the range between \u2212910 and \u2212300 HU has been defined as aerated lung parenchyma. The relative lung area of this density range during the step-up in airway-pressure was plotted against time and was analysed to identify different inspiratory Tc, assuming a two compartimental model. Results: An inspiratory Tc of 1.0 s was found which comprised 86 % of total recruitable lung area. The remaining 14 % of the lung followed a slow time constant of 7.2 s. Based upon these results the respiratory parameters were modified to allow longer inspiratory time. Within the three hours following the change of the ventilatory pattern oxygenation improved significantly. Conclusion: Dynamic-multiscan-CT allows to determine different regional Tc in patient with early ARDS. Lung compartments with long Tc can hardly be reached by conventional ventilation. Dynamic-CT may represent a promising new technique to optimize ventilatory patterns in ARDS.Multislice CT virtual bronchoscopy and multiplanar reformats for grading of tracheobronchial stenosisH. Hoppe, B. Walder, G. von Allmen, P. Vock, H.-P. Dinkel; Berne/CH Purpose: To determine the diagnostic value of noninvasive multislice CT (virtual bronchoscopy, axial CT slices, coronal reformats and sagittal reformats) in depicting and grading tracheobronchial stenosis versus that of flexible bronchoscopy. Methods and materials: Multislice CT and flexible bronchoscopy were used to examine 200 bronchial sections from 20 patients (n = 15 bronchial carcinoma, n = 5 without central airway pathology). CT data were obtained on a multislice CT in 4 \u00d7 2 mm collimation, pitch 5.5/4 and 2 mm reconstruction intervals. Postprocessing was performed using surface rendering and multiplanar reformats (MPR). CT images were independently interpreted by two radiologists. Flexible bronchoscopy was graded by a chest physician. Results: Virtual bronchoscopy, axial CT-slices and MPR were highly accurate (98 % accuracy for virtual bronchoscopy, 96 % for axial slices and coronal reformats, 96.5 % for sagittal reformats) in the detection of tracheobronchial stenosis. Virtual bronchoscopy correlated closely (r = 0.91) with flexible bronchoscopy in the grading of tracheobronchial stenosis. Because virtual bronchoscopy reduced overestimation of stenosis, it enabled better assessment of stenosis compared to axial CTslices (r = 0.84) or MPR images (r = 0.84) alone. Conclusion: Multislice CT virtual bronchoscopy is a reliable non-invasive method that enables accurate grading of tracheobronchial stenosis. It should be combined with axial CT-slices and MPR for evaluation of surrounding structures and optimal spatial orientation. Multislice CT provides high-resolution endoluminal views and MPR with a short scan time despite thin collimation.Segmentation of the tracheo-bronchial tree on radiological images leading to an individualized simulation of drug delivery and uptake S.

Furuichi, A. Furukawa, M. Yamasaki, K. Maeda, M. Ohnishi, M. Takahashi, K. Murata; Otsu/JP Purpose: To evaluate the role of combined CT hepatic angiography (CTHA) and CT during arterial portography (CTAP) in the diagnosis and management of patients with hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and liver metastases. Methods and materials: 51 patients with HCC and 13 patients with liver metastases were referred for CTHA and CTAP prior to surgery or interventional therapy. The final diagnosis was established by either surgery or by clinical observation. Alterations of diagnosis and management resulting from CTHA and CTAP information were recorded. Results: In patients with HCC, diagnosis was altered regarding number, location and extent of lesions in 39 %, 39 %, and 10 % of the patients, respectively. Overall, alterations of diagnosis were performed in 47 % of the patients and they were correct in 75 % of the time. Alterations of management were performed in 31 % of the patients in total, and they were correct in all but one. In the patients with liver metastases, diagnosis was altered regarding number, location and extent of lesions in 31 %, 23 % and 0 % of the patients, respectively. Overall, alterations of diagnosis were performed in 31 % of the patients and they were correct in 50 % of the time. Management was not altered after CTHA and CTAP in the patients with liver metastases. Conclusion: CTHA and CTAP provide valuable clinical information for patients with HCC and corrected their previous diagnosis and plans of management in a significant number. CTHA and CTAP should be performed in patients with HCC when either surgical or interventional therapy is their treatment option.Full organ CT liver perfusion of cancer patients displayed with volume rendering techniques T.

Passariello; Rome/IT Purpose: To evaluate whether the use of triple-phase (early arterial, late arterial, and portal-venous phase) multislice CT improves the detection of hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods and materials: 75 patients with 137 hypervascular HCCs underwent triple-phase multislice CT of the liver. Two ml per kg of contrast material were administered at 4 -5 ml/s. Early and late arterial phase were obtained within a single breath-hold. Portal-venous phase required a second breath-hold. Study parameters were: slice collimation, 2.5 mm; slice thickness, 3.0 mm; table feed, 10.8 mm/s. Analysis of early arterial, late arterial, double arterial (early arterial and late arterial phases combined), and triple-phase (double arterial and portal venous phases combined) images was performed separately by three radiologists. Sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated. Results: Average sensitivity and PPV for the detection of hypervascular HCC were 40.7 % and 90.2 % for the early arterial phase, 83.7 % and 90.4 % for the late arterial phase, 83.7 % and 90.4 % for the double arterial phase, and 85.9 % and 92.1 % for the triple phase, respectively. The analysis of the double arterial phase did not yield any improvement both in sensitivity and PPV compared to the analysis of late arterial phase alone. The addition of the portal-venous phase to image interpretation provided the highest sensitivity and PPV. Conclusion: Combined evaluation of late arterial phase with portal-venous phase was essential to achieve optimal detection of hypervascular HCC. The addition of an early arterial phase did not provide any benefit either in terms of sensitivity or PPV.Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC): Technical biopsy considerations and histologic prognostic factorsT. Petsas, A.C. Tsamandas, C.P. Kalogeropoulou, I. Tsota, N. Samaras, T. Kordonouri, K. Tepetes, I. Dimopoulos; Patras/GR Purpose: Prognosis of HCC is related to histologic type, grade of the tumor and expression of molecular factors (apoptosis, cell proliferation and oncogenes). In this study we evaluated the adequacy of biopsy material and expression of prognostic factors in specimens obtained following tumor resection. Materials and methods: 20 patients with HCC underwent resection of the tumor. Following excision of the tumor multiple biopsies were obtained, using: 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 18 G aspiration needles, 23, 21, 20, 18 G/TIP-CUT aspiration needles, 14 G, 16 G, 18 G, 20 G/9 cm/20 T TRU-CUT core biopsy and the Rotex needle. Pathologic evaluation included histochemical and immunohistochemical stains. Following microscopic examination the specimens were classified as adequate [identification of histologic type, estimation of tumor grade, evaluation of prognostic factors and evaluation of additionally obtained non-neoplastic liver tissue [architecture (fibrosis degree) and activity (inflammation degree)] were possible], intermediate (diagnosis of malignancy and identification of histologic type were possible, but evaluation of non-neoplastic liver tissue was not), and non-adequate (the specimen was not sufficient for histopathologic examination and diagnosis of malignancy could not be established). Results: According to the aforementioned criteria, adequate specimens were obtained when: 14 G, 16 G, 18 G, 20 G/9 cm/20 TRU-CUT and 18 G/TIP-CUT needles were used, intermediate, when 20 G/TIP-CUT, 18, 20, 21, 22 G and non-adequate when 24, 23, 23 G/TIP-CUT needles and Rotex needle were used. Conclusion: Our study suggests that histologic confirmation of HCC is possible when certain needles are used. Further studies have to be made in order to determine the specific needle characteristics, for correct histopathologic diagnosis.Hepatocellular carcinoma in non-cirrhotic liver: CT and clinico-pathologic findings in 39 United States residents G. Brancatelli 1, 2 , M.P. Federle 1 , L. Grazioli 3 , B.I. Carr 1 ; 1 Pittsburgh, PA/US, Palermo/IT, 3 Brescia/IT Purpose: To review the clinical, pathological, and helical multiphasic computed tomography (CT) findings in 39 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a noncirrhotic liver. Materials and methods: Authors retrospectively evaluated the clinical, pathologic and imaging findings in 39 patients with HCC in non-cirrhotic liver. Helical multiphase CT was performed in all patients. Images were reviewed for morphologic features of tumours such as size, margins and haemorrhage and degrees of enhancement.Results: There were 25 men and 14 women with a mean age of 61; 62 % of patients had no identifiable risk factors and 87 % were symptomatic HCC was proved and cirrhosis excluded by biopsy in all cases. The HCC was moderately (n = 32) or well (n = 6) differentiated in 97 % of cases and poorly differentiated in one. Large tumours (mean diameter, 12.4 cm) were depicted at CT in all cases. 32 patients had a solitary or dominant mass. At CT, the margins of the tumours were well defined in 21 patients (54 %), with a lobulated surface in 33 (85 %). Calcifications were depicted in 11 (28 %), haemorrhage in 10 (26 %), fat in 4 (10 %). The HCC were hypoattenuating in 34 patients (87 %) on unenhanced images, heterogeneously hyperattenuating on arterial phase in 38 patients (97 %), and hypoattenuating in 35 patients (90 %) on portal phase. Conclusion: In our patients, HCC developed in the absence of cirrhosis or known risk factors and typically appeared as a large, symptomatic hepatic tumour with clinical, laboratory and CT features that distinguish it from most other hepatic masses.Local recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after percutaneous ablation procedures: Category-based managementO. Catalano, B. Cusati, A. Giorgio, L. Tarantino, A. Siani; Naples/IT Purpose: To report our experience in the detection and treatment of recurring HCC in patients initially treated successfully with percutaneous procedures. Recurrence management was based on our original categorisation system. Methods and materials: During 4 years there were 50 patients showing recurrence after single-or multisession percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), laser photocoagulation, or radiofrequency thermotherapy. These subjects were categorized by using a previously published personal system based on imaging findings: (A) intranodular recurrence (tumour regrowth within the margin of necrotic former lesion), (B) perinodular recurrence (growth around the lesion border), (C) segmental recurrence (growth in the same segment of treated nodule, without continuity with the original lesion). Results: Five patients showed a pattern A, developed after multisession PEI, and were treated percutaneously with success. There were 16 subjects showing a pattern B that were managed by using transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE), alone (n = 12) or combined with percutaneous treatments (n = 4); complete necrosis was obtained in 9 cases. There were 38 patients with pattern C that were treated with TACE and/or percutaneous procedures, depending on number and size of new nodules; complete necrosis was achieved in 22 cases. One subject underwent surgery. Conclusion: Patients with exclusive local regrowth after percutaneous ablation can still be managed effectively. Treatment modality should be chose according to the imaging recurrence pattern.Multicentric origin of sporadically recurrent hypervascular hepatocellular carcinomas in cirrhotic livers: Retrospective analysis by repeated CT during arterial portography and CT during hepatic arteriography O. Matsui, S. Kobayashi, N. Terayama, J.-I. Sanada, T. Gabata; Kanazawa/JPPurpose: To analyse the multicentric origin of sporadically recurrent hypervascular hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) in cirrhotic livers by the retrospective observation of repeatedly performed CT during arterial portography (CTAP) and CT during hepatic arteriography (CTHA). Materials and methods: 33 cirrhotic patients (hepatitis C related 26, B 7) with a solitary hypervascular classical HCC locally well-controlled by local ablation therapy or transcatheter arterial embolization in whom repeated CTAP and CTHA were carried out within two years and less than five recurrent new hypervascular HCCs were found were subjected to the study. The HCC patients with portal venous tumor thrombi or small hypervascular daughter nodules surrounding the main HCC nodule were excluded. A total of 77 hypervascular HCC nodules were analysed. When the nodule showed decreased arterial supply relative to the surrounding liver and the existence of intranodular portal flow indicating borderline lesion of HCC on the previous CTHA and CTAP, it was diagnosed as multicentric origin. Results: 56 out of 77 hypervascular recurrent HCC nodules (73 %) were originated from borderline lesions. In the remaining 21 nodules, a tiny entirely hypervascular nodule or no definite nodule was detected on the previous CTHA and CTAP. Conclusion: In B or C virus-related cirrhotic livers, more than 70 % of sporadically recurrent hypervascular HCCs seen following the treatment of a solitary hypervascular HCC were considered to be multicentric origin (not metastasis). This fact is very important for the management of cirrhotic patients.CT imaging of liver tumors -a study to determine specificity and prevalence of capsular retraction A. Trojanowska, E.

Sclavi, A. Tersol, E. Uslenghi, M. Ozuna; Bahia Blanca/AR Purpose: To evaluate relationship between volumetry of the spleen by ultrasound and sex, weight and height in a prospective series of 465 normal patients. Materials and methods: In a period of 24 months 465 patients' records with no evidence of haemopoietic disorders, who underwent an ultrasound examination of the abdomen, were examined. Sex, weight, height and linear dimensions of the spleen were tabled. \"Forward stepwise\" multiple regression analyses were performed, considering volumen, longitudinal, transverse and ventrodorsal diameters of the spleen as independent variables, and height, weight and age as dependent in both sexes. Analyses for males and females separately, were also performed. Results: The whole series showed regression between weight, height and age, as dependent, and craneocaudal diameter of the spleen as independent, with R = 0.6374; R2 = 0.4063; F (3.461) = 105.16. Regression parameters increase when variables are transformed into logarithms. Males showed regression between weight and craneocaudal diameter of the spleen with R = 0.6518; R2 = 0.4248; F (3.124) = 30.53. In females, regression was found between height, weight and age, as dependent; and craneocaudal diameter of the spleen as independent variable, with R = 0.5679; R2 = 0.3225; F (3.333) = 52.85. No other regression models were found between mentioned variables. Conclusion: Spleen's longitudinal diameter was predictable in 40 % of the patients in our series, while a wide variation was seen for both sexes. Spleen's longitudinal diameter in males is more predictable when weight in considered as dependent variable. Height, weight and age are to be considered in females, but their ability in predicting longitudinal diameter of the spleen is less accurate.High resolution multislice CT in the preoperative evaluation of laparoscopic splenectomy C.

The decrease of the RHD/LHD and intrahepatic bile ducts were semnificative in case of an adequate biliary drainage. Aerobilia was present in the drained lobe in all cases with successful drainage. The positive and negative predictive values for aerobilia assessed on day 3 after stenting were 66 % and 70 %. The proximal end of the endoprosthesis was correctly visualized in 81.2 % of cases. Conclusions: In the evaluation of an endoscopic biliary drainage in proximal obstructions, the importance of ultrasound examination is based on the correct assessment of the endoprosthesis position and of the bile ducts size above the stenosis. In these cases aerobilia has a limited value.Study of pulse inversionmode with the late phase of Levovist to detect hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhotic liver E. Quaia 1 , C.J. Harvey 2 , M.J.K. Blomley 2 , D.O. Cosgrove 2 , W. Gedroyc 2 ;Trieste/IT, 2 London/GB Purpose: To evaluate if Pulse Inversion Mode (PIM) with the late phase of Levovist can improve hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) conspicuity and detection, compared to baseline ultrasound (US), using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or helical CT as reference examinations. Methods and materials: To date, 23 consecutive cirrhotic patients, with known HCC or suspected on alphafetoprotein rise, were evaluated by baseline US and PIM 3 minutes after intravenous injection of Levovist. Subjective conspicuity of HCC was evaluated by comparing PIM to baseline US and grading conspicuity as worse, unchanged or improved. Each lesion suspected to be an HCC was counted. HCC diagnosis was proved by biopsy or autoptic assessment and/or imaging features. Lesions not proved as HCCs were excluded. Results: HCC conspicuity improved in all cases. In 5 patients no HCC was detected by all imaging techniques. In the remaining 18 patients, in comparison to baseline US, PIM revealed the same number of lesions in 13 patients and an higher number in 5 patients. In comparison to reference examinations, PIM revealed the same number of lesions in 16 patients and an higher number in 2 patients. Average number of detected HCCs for patient was 1.47 for US, 2.13 for PIM and 1.95 for reference examinations. Difference between PIM and US was found statistically significant (p < 0.05), while difference between PIM and reference examinations was found non-significant (p = 0.161). Conclusions: PIM with Levovist improves detection of HCC if compared to baseline US and presents a similar sensitivity to helical CT and MRI.Sonographic characterisation of focal liver lesions using new blood pool contrast agent with non-linear imaging modes E. Leen 1 , D. Becker 2 , D. Strobel 2 , J. MacQuarrie 1 , P. Horgan 1 ; 1 Glasgow/GB,Erlangen/DEPurpose: To assess the use of SonoVue in the characterisation of focal liver lesions using non-linear imaging (NLI) modes. Methods: 36 patients with focal liver lesions (12 with metastases, 11 HCCs, 7 haemangiomas & 6 others) were studied using ATL5000 & Siemens/Elegra scanners. NLI mode, fundamental B-mode & power Doppler (PD) imaging were performed at baseline. NLI imaging of the hepatic lesion was then carried out at low MI (0.1 -0.3) immediately after an IV administration of SonoVue (dose: 2.4 ml). Biopsy or combined CT/MR & markers were used as \"reference standard\". Diagnosis was established on the basis of tumour vascularity & pattern of enhancement. Comparison and correlation between the US and CT/MR enhancement findings were also performed. Diagnostic accuracy (% agreement) and performance of contrast enhanced US in identifying the lesion as benign or malignant were analysed. Results: The rank-correlation between contrast-enhanced US and CT/MR classifications of tumour vascularity was highly significant in arterial phase (r = 0.92, p < 0.001) and portal phase (r = 0.73, p < 0.001). Of the benign tumours, 83 % were classified as indeterminate, 8 % as probably benign and 8 % as almost definitely benign using baseline US. On contrast enhanced US, 92 % were classified as definitely benign and 8 % as almost definitely benign. All haemangiomas (even those measuring less than 1.5 cm) showed progressive centripetal contrast uptake. The improvement in diagnostic classification was highly significant for both malignant and benign tumours (p < 0.001, Wilcoxon). Conclusion: These results suggest that SonoVue enhanced non-linear imaging modes may be useful in improving the characterization of focal liver tumours.Comparative evaluation of MR imaging and sonography in hydatid liver diseaseI.

Passariello; Rome/IT Purpose: To evaluate the reliability of MRI in detecting and characterizing hydatid cysts of the liver in comparison with sonography. Materials and methods: 47 patients with suspected hepatic hydatid disease (positive serological tests), underwent both hepatic MR imaging and liver sonography. All MR examinations were performed on a 1.5 T superconductive system, acquiring both T1 and T2 weighted images. Diagnostic confirmation of cystic nature was based on surgical findings, cytologic examination (after PAIR aspiration) or integrated clinical, serological, imaging findings and follow-up response to therapy. PPV 97.10 %). The 68 sonographic examinations characterized hydatid cysts with accuracy 91.18 %, sensitivity 93.65 % and PPV 96.72 %. Agreement between sonography and MR imaging was observed in 63/68 (92.65 %) lesions, whereas disagreement was observed in 5/68 (8.8 %) cysts. Conclusions: No significant differences were observed between MRI and sonography in identifying and characterizing liver hydatid cysts. Therefore MRI should be reserved to cases with doubtful sonography, to complicated cysts and to pre-surgical planning.Evaluation of hepatic tumors vascularization on C3-mode bidimensional gray scale US after contrast agentM. Silv\u00e1n, F.J. Gonz\u00e1lez, P. Sadaba, R. Landeras, M. L\u00f3pez, C. Juanco; Santander/ES Purpose: The evaluation of a focal liver mass is a complex issue that is often the major focus of a cross sectional imaging study including two essential elements: lesion detection and lesion characterization Both of these are improved on sonography with the addition of contrast agents and the use of specialized imaging techniques We employ the C3-mode (Combined Contrast Chain, Esaote) to characterize focal liver lesions after intravenous injection of microbubble contrast agent. Method and material: We evaluate 35 previously detected and evaluated hepatic tumors (10 hemangiomas, 10 HCCs, 10 liver metastases 3 FNH and 2 adenomas) in 35 patients with C3 mode using a Technos sonography scan (Esaote, Italy). The images were obtained before and after injection of as bolus of 3 g microbubble contrast agent (Levovist (Schering, Germany) with incremental interval delay scaning technique. Results: The hemangiomas revealed peripheral and progressive enhancement with centripetal filling-in. Most of the HCCs showed early enhancement after injection with rapid wash-out in portal phase. Metastases showed a sharply hypoechogenicity comparing with normal liver parechyma with a soft rim-like enhancement on early phases. FNH showed intense and early enhancement on arterial phase with homogeneous filling-in during the examination. The enhancement of adenomas was heterogeneous. Conclusion: US evaluation of hepatic lesions on C3 mode after US contrast injection is a good method to characterize the tumors. The results are equivalent to other dynamic (CT, MRI) techniques.Diagnostic accuracy of tissue harmonic imaging (THI) versus conventional B-mode scan (BM) in the evaluation of pancreatic abnormalities with ultrasound C.

Cauchemez, E. Mousseaux; Paris/FR Purpose: To analyse the appearances of the pulmonary veins (PV) in patients with focal atrial fibrillation (FAF) initiated by ectopic beats in the PV, compared to a control group. Material and methods: The appearances of the PV were assessed in 10 patients with FAF originating from the pulmonary veins (confirmed by electrophysiological study) and in 10 asymptomatic patients screened for coronary artery disease. The patients were paired by age and gender (age 50 \u00b1 14 years). Each patient underwent ECG-gated contrast-enhanced multi-detector CT (MDCT) of the heart. The diameter of each of the four PV was calculated on 1 mm thick slices on axial and coronal oblique images and was measured at the ostium and at 5, 10 and 15 mm. Both the mean and the maximal diameters were calculated for each vein. Any anomalies or abnormalities of the heart and vessels were also described. Results: The maximal diameters of proximal portions of the right superior (18.6 \u00b1 3 vs 16.2 \u00b1 2 mm; p < 0.05) and the left inferior (18.1 \u00b1 2 vs 15.4 \u00b1 2 mm; p < 0.05) PV were significantly dilated in FAF patients compared to controls. The right inferior (19.9 \u00b1 4 vs 17.4 \u00b1 2 mm) and left superior veins (19.1 \u00b1 3 vs 16.8 \u00b1 2 mm) were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusion: On MDCT images, the proximal portion of right superior and left inferior PV was significantly dilated in patients with FAF initiated by ectopic pulmonary beats. Accurate evaluation of the appearances of the PV gives valuable and complementary information before selective cannulation of each vein and percutaneous radiofrequency ablation procedure.",

De Cobelli, F. Gugliotta, R. Mellone, M. Venturini, C. Pappone, A. Del Maschio; Milan/IT Purpose: The pulmonary veins (PVs) and surrounding ostial areas frequently house focal triggers or reentrant circuits critical to genesis of atrial fibrillation (AF). A new anatomic treatment aimed at isolating each PVs from the left atrium (LA) by circumferential radiofrequency (RF) lesions around their ostia has been developed. We evaluated the role of MRI and MRA in assessment of PVs and LA before and after RF ablation. Method and materials: 12 patients with resistant AF underwent MRI and MRA before and the day after RF ablation. 8 patients underwent MR after 3 months. MR images were obtained with black-blood ECG-triggered breath-hold multishotFSE sequences with double and triple inversion pulses (IR-MSFSE) (TR/TE 2 \u00d7 RR/ 40, ETL = 32). MRAs were acquired with efgre 3D sequences (TR/TE/TI/FA 5.4/ 1.6/30/30\u00b0) with gadolinium injection and reconstructed with MIP and volume rendering. Results: At the pretreatment MRA, all four PVs were visualized in all patients. In four patients, the following anatomic variants were found: a common ostium of the left superior (LS) and inferior (LI) PVs; a single ostium of the LS and LIPVs; a posterior ostium of LIPV; 3 separate right PVs ostia. At the post-treatment MRI, high signal intensity was detected in the atrial wall around veins ostia due to oedema; in three patients a thin pericardial effusion was evident. At three months follow-up, the LA volume was significantly decreased in patients who had sinus rhythm restoration; with MRA, a left inferior PV stenosis was found. Conclusion: MR is useful in evaluation of patients with AF before and after RF ablation of PVs ostia.",

Ruhr/DE, 2 Z\u00fcrich/CH, 3 Boston, MA/US Objective: Closed chest coronary artery bypass grafting with the use of a telemanipulator is still performed in very few numbers worldwide. Preoperative planning and intraoperative navigation might be a helpful tool for increasing success rates of this procedure. The most promising accomplishments of image guidance in surgery are three-dimensional image-processing algorithms.Methods: Creation of 3D-visualization involves segmentation from acquired crosssectional images. In 15 patients cross-sectional images were obtained by CT and MR. Images were digitally transferred via an internal high-speed to the surgical planning laboratory. We primarily used high-end computer workstations Sparcand Ultrasparc (Sun Microsystems, Mountain View, CA), equipped with specially developed software, the 3D-Slicer for registration, filtering of regions of interest, semi-automated segmentation and 3D-visualization. Results: Preoperative planning with identification of target vessels and assessment of wall quality, as well as the possibility of image-guided surgery can be obtained by the 3D-visualization of the acquired data-sets. Together with the development of semi-automated segmentation, 3D rendering, integration of different image-modalities, intraoperative navigation and tracking can be provided for closed chest coronary artery bypass grafting. Conclusion: 3D-image guidance in surgical procedures for preoperative planning in a non-invasive fashion, as well as intraoperative navigation and tracking of robotically-assisted instruments are very helpful in detecting complex coronary lesions and calcified vessels which facilitate closed chest coronary artery bypass procedures. Patients with intramural vessels or severe calcification can be identified and the operative technique can be chosen adequately.",

Methods: CTPA was performed as a control study in 23 dogs. Pulmonary embolism was induced in the dogs by administation of autologous blood clots, after that CTPA and X-ray pulmonary angiography (XPA) were performed. The images were evaluated on a workstation by two radiologists and the image findings were compared with that of pathological dissections. Results: 22 pulmonary embolism models were successfully made in this study and 110 thrombi were found during pulmonary artery dissection. The thrombi were same number as that injected and the all thrombi located in segment and subsegment of pulmonary arteries, of which 107 thrombi were in field of the view (FOV). 90 thrombi were found with CTPA, whereas 82 thrombi with XPA. The sensitivity of the CTPA and XPA was 84.1 %, 76.6 %, respectively, and the positive predictive values were 93.8 % and 94.3 % respectively for the diagnosis of small pulmonary thrombi.

Material and methods: MDCT (Siemens Somatom VolumeZoom, Germany) was performed in 86 patients with a history of thoracoabdominal blunt or spinal trauma. All imaging was acquired using a collimation of 4 \u00d7 2.5 mm and a pitch of 6. Based on this raw data set, the spine was targeted reconstructed using the following parameters: slice width 3 mm; reconstruction interval 1.5 mm. Two readers separately assessed imaging quality of spinal structures for diagnostic purposes. In addition, both readers evaluated all patients for spinal fractures using five-point confidence scale (1 = fracture definitely absent, 2 = fracture probably absent, 3 = equivocal, 4 = fracture probably present, 5 = fracture definitely present). The number and level of fractures were categorized and correlated to thin section MDCT and/or surgical findings. Results: Visibility of spinal anatomic details for diagnostic purposes was rated as excellent by reader 1/2 in 927/862 levels and good in 119/184 levels of 1046 spinal levels using a standardized trauma protocol. Scoring on the confidence scale was 4.6 (\u00b1 0.8) in case of fractures and 1.1 (\u00b1 0.1) in case of no fractures, respectively. 20 of 21 spinal fractures (98 %) were correctly depicted by each reader.

Wolf; Berlin/DE Purpose: To assess the accuracy of a standardized \"whole body\" spiral-CT protocol in the initial work-up of spinal injuries in trauma patients and to compare spiral-CT with conventional radiography. Methods: 46 trauma patients with potentially life threatening injuries underwent a spiral-CT of the skull base and neck (collimation/table speed/reconstruction interval: 3/5/3 mm), chest, abdomen and pelvis (5/7.5/5) immediately after resuscitation. Additional dedicated axial and sagittal high-resolution reconstructions of the entire spine were performed from the data sets. 40 patients also had conventional radiographs of the spine. CT findings were compared with conventional radiographs and final diagnoses at discharge or death. Results: Image quality was adequate in 39/46 CTs and 28/40 conventional spine series. In the remaining cases at least one area of the spine was not adequately imaged, in CT this was most often the thoracic spine. The final diagnoses included 8 cervical, 19 thoracic and 23 lumbar spine fractures; 7 fractures were instable. On CT, all but 1 thoracic and 3 lumbar spine fractures were diagnosed. None of the undetected fractures were instable. On conventional radiography, 1 cervical, 2 thoracic and 5 lumbar spine fractures were missed; again none of these were instable. Conclusion: CT was superior to conventional radiography and allowed fast and accurate diagnoses of the vast majority of spinal fractures, and missed no instable fractures. In our experience, time consuming conventional spine radiography is dispensable with this approach in most cases. Part I: B-0206 (SS 401)",

Materials and methods: MRI was evaluated in 2 groups of patients with traumatic changes of the cervical spine column including an injury of intervertebral discs. The study included 6 in-vivo examinations of patients and 8 postmortem examinations (neck specimen, C1 -T1 including the skull base) of human corpses after an acceleration trauma. Disc lesions were verified intraoperatively in all patients or macroscopically by sections of the specimen. Results: The variability of traumatic lesions of the intervertebral disks ranged from small detachments of the disc from the vertebral body to large ruptures of the entire disc. Extensive lesions of the disks were correlated with other injuries such as fractures or ligamental trauma. MRI depicted all lesions with extension to the entire disk due to morphologic changes in HR-sequences and/or signal alteration in Inversion Recovery and T2-WI sequences. Most of the circumscribed disc detachments seen macroscopically were not detectable with MR imaging. Conclusions: MRI allows a reliable diagnosis of significant lesions of the cervical intervertebral discs after trauma. Small detachments of the disc, however, will be missed.",

Mann 2 ; 1 Vienna/AT, 2 Seattle, WA/US Purpose: The purpose of our study was to describe types and distribution of cervical spine injuries in consecutive elderly patients in regard to causative trauma mechanism and to patient age. Materials and methods: The distribution and type of 225 cervical spine injuries in 149 consecutive subjects older than 65 years over a 5-year interval were retrospectively assessed. For each subject, initial imaging studies were reviewed and injuries were classified. The trauma mechanism (falls from standing or seated height vs. mechanisms consistent with higher energy) and initial clinical and neurological status were recorded. Data were correlated according to patients' age (65 -75 a and > 75 a) and causative trauma mechanism. Results: The majority of patients (64 %) had injuries to the upper cervical spine. Multilevel injuries were frequent (40 %). The main causes for cervical spine injuries were motor vehicle crashes in \"young elderly\" (65 -75 a) (61 %) and falls from standing or seated height in \"old elderly\" (> 75 a) (40 %). Fracture patterns at risk for neurologic deterioration were common (> 50 %), even in absence of acute myelopathy or radiculopathy. Subjects older than 75 years, independent of causative mechanism, and patients who fell from standing height, independent of age, were more likely to have injuries of the upper cervical spine (p = 0.026 and p = 0.006, respectively). Conclusion: Injuries of the cervical spine in elderly patients tend to involve more than one level with consistent clinical instability. \"Old elderly\" patients (> 75 years) and subjects who fall from standing height are more prone to injuries of the upper cervical spine.",

Reiser; Munich/DE Purpose: To evaluate the occurrence of the linear fluid sign in acute osteoporotic and neoplastic vertebral compression fractures in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods and materials: The study group comprised 87 consecutive patients with a total of 107 acute vertebral compression fractures due to osteoporosis or neoplastic infiltration. The MRI protocol included unenhanced T1-weighted spin echo (SE) and short-tau inversion recovery sequences (STIR) on a 1.5 T system. Confirmation of diagnosis was made by surgery, follow-up MRI examinations, clinical follow-up or unequivocal imaging findings. Results: All fractures showed hypointensity on T1-weighted SE images and hyperintensity on STIR images, both in cases of osteoporosis (n = 65) and tumor (n = 41). In the fractured vertebral bodies the fluid sign appeared as a circumscribed lesion adjacent to the fractured end-plates, which exhibits signal intensities isointense to cerebrospinal fluid. The shape of the fluid sign was linear (n = 18), triangular (n = 5) or focal (n = 2). It was associated statistically significant with the osteoporotic cause of a fracture (n = 23, 35 %; chi square p < 0.001). The fluid sign occurred also in 2 cases of neoplastic compression fractures (5 %). At the site of the fluid sign histologic correlation demonstrated osteonecrosis, edema and fibrosis.",

The standard procedure for RIG insertion was adhered to, with use of four T-fastners to secure a gastropexy. To take account of the high subcostal site of the stomach, the procedure was modified, performed with lateral screening, allowing for constant visualization of the puncture needles, to confidently puncture the anterior stomach wall.Results: This modified technique has been employed in 35 patients (20 male and 15 female, median age 62 years, range 31 -81 years) over a 36 month period. 28 standard radiological gastrostomy tubes were inserted, six were self retaining devices. The procedure was successful in 34 patients (97 %), 7 tubes were reinserted (20 %, all standard radiological tubes) over a variable period of time. The one failure was due to a high subcostal stomach in an obese patient. Conclusion: Diaphragmatic palsy presents a technical challenge for insertion of a RIG in the conventional manner. Using lateral screening a high success rate is achieved, and should be the method of choice for MND patients with respiratory compromise. ",

Nine patients had pyloric obstruction. Four had undergone gastric pull-up operations or partial oesophagogastrectomy for oesophageal or gastric carcinoma with pyloric dysfunction not responsive to balloon dilatation. Five patients had inoperable oesophageal or gastric carcinoma involving the pylorus. Six other patients had duodenal obstruction secondary to pancreatic carcinoma. In only three patients were two stents required to cover the obstruction. Four patients with malignant obstructive jaundice required concurrent stenting of the common bile duct. Results: All patients were able to consume an adequate diet after stent insertion. One stent migrated proximally into the fundus at day two in a patient with gastric carcinoma involving the pylorus. He presented five days later with perforation of the antrum at the tumour site which required emergency surgery. Of the remaining patients (seven have died) none have experienced recurrent symptoms of gastric outflow obstruction over a mean follow-up period of fourteen weeks. Conclusion: Non-endoscopic placement of SEMS under fluoroscopic guidance is a safe and effective treatment for outflow obstruction secondary to pyloric and duodenal stenosis. It is particularly effective in the palliation of malignant disease, but also has a role on the treatment of pyloric dysfunction after gastric pull-up surgery. Purpose: Reference methods in diagnosis of Crohn's disease are endoscopy and small bowel follow-through. Involvement and activity of proximal segments of the small bowel is difficult to evaluate. Our purpose was to develop a sensitive, easy to perform and minimal-invasive method for imaging small bowel without radiationexposure for mostly young patients. Methods: 30 patients (18 female/12 male) with suspected or established Crohn's disease were included. The patients were administered orally 1.5 l of a mannitolsolution (2.5 %) within 1 hour before imaging. A rectal mannitol-solution filling was also employed. Butylscopolamin was administrated i.v. HASTE and fs-HASTEsequences and T1-BH-sequences were acquired before and after (fs-T1-BH) i.v. Gd-DTPA administratio in transversal and coronal orientation. The images were analysed by three radiologist using a standardised protocol. In all cases a correlation with ultrasound-imaging was performed. Results: Alterations indicative of Crohn's disease were noted in 21 patients. In these cases we detected wall thickening with an average of 7.1 mm and with a mean length of 11.5 cm. The signal-intensity-increase after contrastmedium-application of thickened bowel wall was 58 %. Normal bowel-wall had an increase of signal-intensity after Gd-DTPA of 38 %. 11 relevant stenoses (37 %), 2 abscesses (6 %) and 9 fistulas were visualized (31 %). In ultrasound imaging we detected 9 cases with a stenosis (31 %), 5 fistulous tracts (17 %) and 1 case (3 %) with an abscess. Conclusion: Mannitol-MRI of small bowel in patients with suspected or established regional enteritis is a promising method for the diagnosic work-up and renders results superior to ultrasound imaging.",

CT studies were performed in a standard fashion: collimation 8 mm, feed 12 mm, reconstruction 5 mm. I.v. contrast administration flow 3.5 ml/s, volume 1.5 ml/kg, delay 40 s in a caudo-cranial direction. We were searching for bowel wall thickening, increased contrast enhancement of the bowel wall, mesenterial signs, fistulas and abscesses, and enlarged lymph nodes. CT results were correlated with immunscintigraphy. Results: In cases where the affected loops showed thickened wall (4 -10 mm) increased contrast enhancement and sourranded by a fibrofatty proliferation, with increased vascularisation the immunscintigraphy was positive in 91 % of patients. When we saw fistulas, abscesses and a thickened bowel wall (10 mm or more), with increased vascularisation in mesentery with prominent enlarged lymph nodes the immunscintigraphy was always positive. Conclusion: Contrast enhanced spiral CT study is a goog tool in the assesment of the activity in Crohn's disease. Results: In 10 cases the embolization failed: no bronchial artery catheterized in the bleeding side (n = 6), pulmonary artery bleeding due to central excavated lung tumors (n = 2), right intercosto-bronchial trunk with a doubt about a spinal radicular artery (n = 1), unstable catheter position (n = 1) and technical problem (n = 1). Among the 61 patients with at least one bronchial artery selectively catheterized (included 4 non-embolized), bronchial hypervascularisation was visualized in 58 associated with nonbronchial systemic hypervascularisation in 4 cases. The immediate control of bleeding was obtained in 72 %. Long-term result was 61.4 %.Complications were: acute but transient renal failure (n = 1), cerebral ischemia (n = 2) with one definitive deficit. Conclusion: Tumours are responsible of 12.3 % of massive hemoptysis and embolization is efficient. The bleeding is rarely due to nonbronchial arteries. Stroke incidence is increased in comparison with other hemoptysis probably because of elderly patients.",

In 1007 cases successful SLOBB was verified either by a malignant histopathological diagnosis or by immediate mammographic evaluation after surgery. In 582 (58 %) of these cases the lesion was localised with a wire, in 410 cases (41 %) carbon was used. Both methods were used to localise the remaining 15 cases (1.4 %). A lesion was considered as missed when it could be still seen on mammography performed after surgery. Results: Ten out of 1007 cases (1 %) were missed at SLOBB. Of these, 5 lesions had been localised by wire (5/582; miss-rate 0.9 %) and 5 lesions with carbon (5/410; miss-rate 1.2 %). There were no significant differences in miss-rates between wire-and carbon-localisation (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Both wire-and carbon-localisation are reliable and accurate in the localisation of non-palpable breast lesions undergoing SLOBB. Considering the fact that wire-localisation is far more expensive than carbon-localisation the routine use of carbon should be considered.

Bautz; Erlangen/DE Objective: Retrospective study to evaluate if preoperative core-cut biopsy influences the incidence of local recurrence of breast cancer and metastasis -a phenomenon described after puncture biopsies of the pancreas and the prostate. Material and methods: Core-cut biopsy was performed on 150 patients with suspected breast cancer before undergoing surgery in the period 1992 -1993. The clinical outcome of 123 patients was analysed retrospectively over a period of seven years. 66 had undergone breast conservation therapy, 57 had had a mastectomy. Adjuvant therapy was also included in the evaluation. Results: Local recurrence after breast conserving therapy (BCT) was seen in 11 of 66 patients (17 %), and in 7 of 57 (12 %) after mastectomy (MRM). The rate of local relapse after radiotherapy (RT) was 8 of 43 (19 %) (BCT) and 4 of 25 (16 %) (MRM) respectively. In the group without RT 3 of 23 (13 %) (BCT) and 3 of 22 (9 %) (MRM) relapsed respectively. In two cases the biopsy site was not removed. One of those, not having had a RT, had a local recurrence. Conclusion: According to the literature, breast cancer local recurrence rate is 1 -2 % per year. In our group recurrence rate reached 1.9 % totally per year and 2.1 % after BCT being in agreement with international studies. No higher rate of local recurrence or metastasis was seen after core-cut biopsy. Nevertheless the biopsy site should be removed in any case.",

The following indications may not be (as well) suited: architectural distortion (suspected radial scar) or lesions close to the skin. Needle access (angulation of compression, stroke margin) must be exactly documented. Acquisition of > 20 cores (11 G) shall be routinely attempted (goals: radiologic removal of lesions < 10 mm to increase diagnostic reliability, decrease of underestimates).

In future imaging, biopsy and therapy of breast lesions should be possible in one single patient session using this robotic system. To assess the feasibility of assessment of stent-graft patency by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA). Materials and methods: 9 bifurcated abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) stentgrafts made of nitinol, elgiloy or stainless steel were investigated regarding their appearance on MR imaging. The stent-grafts were positioned in a phantom filled with aqueous gadolinium solution. Coronal and axial three-dimensional gradient echo sequences were performed (TR 8.1 ms/TE 1.3 ms, FA 40\u00b0). Relative signal intensity reduction within the stent-grafts and the difference of the real stent-graft lumen as compared to the lumen measured on the MR images were calculated. Results: The graft lumen was depicted in 6 prosthesis. The lumen of stainless steel stent-grafts showed a complete signal void. Relative narrowing of the inner diameter on the MR images was less in the proximal part of the stent-grafts than in their legs. With a gadolinium dilution of 1:20 the artifical narrowing of the proximal lumen ranged from 7.1 % to 59.5 %, whereas in the stent-graft legs the visible lumen was diminished between 2.4 % to 71.8 %. Only three stent-grafts presented with a lumen reduction on the MR images of less than 33 % along the whole prothesis length. Conclusion: To differentiate between artifacts and stenoses, a knowledge of the degree of signal intensity reduction and artificial lumen narrowing within AAA stentgrafts is essential. Stent-graft composition and the design of the stent-graft influence the artifact behaviour and lumen visibility as displayed on CE-MRA. Only a minority of the investigated stent-grafts is suitable for imaging by CE-MRA. ",

Results: Immediate technical success was achieved in 16 patients (94 %). One needed conversion to open surgery due to progressive hemodynamic instability. Mean intervention time was 149 min (\u00b1 114), mean ICU stay 2.6 days (\u00b1 0.85) and mean hospitalization 10 days (\u00b1 5). The 30 day mortality was 0 %. Within 30 days one patient was treated with hemofiltration and three had reinterventions: replacement with homograft of an infected iliac-femoral extension SG; SG extension for retroperitoneal bleeding; embolization of the inferior mesenteric artery. In the mean follow-up period of 8 months two endovascular reinterventions were performed: SG implantation for graft disconnection; thrombolysis of a stent leg. One patient needed elective late conversion to open surgery after 14 months due to SG migration. Aneurysmal diameter decreased in 58.8 %, increased in 5.8 % and remained unchanged in 35.3 % of patients. Conclusion: Endovascular treatment of rAAA with SG implantation is feasible and safe. This technique seems to be a valuable alternative to emergency open surgery with its high mortality.",

Gavelli; Bologna/IT Purpose: Surgery of the thoracic aorta is characterized by high mortality and morbidity, especially if performed in an emergency. We report our experience in emergency endovascular treatment of the thoracic aorta. Material and methods: From 1997, 58 patients underwent endovascular treatment of the thoracic aorta. Seven (2 type B acute aortic dissections, 2 traumatic aortic ruptures, 1 penetrating aortic ulcer and 2 surgical prosthesis dehiscences) presented with clinical and/or imaging findings of impending aortic rupture and were treated as an emergency. Before the procedure, spiral CT was used to define the lesion's anatomy. All procedures were performed in the operating theatre and monitored by a radiographic C-arm system and by echocardiography. Results: Stent-graft implant was successful in all patients. No death nor complication occured during the procedure. In 4 cases, immediately after stent-graft implant, surgical drainage of a hemothorax was performed. The average time of Intensive Care Unit stay was 12 \u00b1 8 hours, while hospital stay was 7 \u00b1 5 days. In 6 patients a spiral CT follow-up showed complete aneurysmal exclusion; 1 case showed persisting leakage over 3 months and was converted to surgery. Conclusion: Endovascular stent treatment of thoracic aorta diseases could be a very effective option and an alternative to surgery, especially in an emergency.",

Patients and methods: From January 1996 to September 2001, 28 aneurysms and 11 dissections were selected to be treated using custom stent-grafts of different designs. Custom stent-grafts were constructed with Gianturco Z stents sutured together and covered with polyester (Twillweave, Vascutek, Innachinnan, Scotland). Endovascular treatment of aortic arch aneurysms combined with extraanatomic bypasses were used in 7 cases. Elephant trunk in one step was used in three cases. Endovascular bypasses were used as the second step of the elephant trunk technique in two cases. Results: Four patients (10 %) were converted to standard open repair. No leakage of the thoracic aneurysms was observed at follow-up. Sealing of the primary tear in thoracic aortic dissections was successful in all cases. Three patients died of myocardial infarction in the perioperative period. Conclusion: Custom stent-grafts in the endovascular treatment of thoracic aortic pathology achieve good results. Endovascular treatment of aortic arch aneurysms combined with extra-anatomic bypasses provides a less invasive method of treatment of these complex lesions.

Methods and materials: From November 2000, 16 patients were treated using a commercially available stent-graft: Thoracic Excluder (W.L. Gore). Twelve cases were performed in the angio-suite and 4 in the OR under general or epidural anesthesia. TAA: 6 patients. In two patients (12.5 %), with a short proximal neck, the origin of the left subclavian artery was covered by the stent-graft. Dissection: 10 patients with type B dissection, 7 acute and 3 chronic. Two cases were complicated by renal ischemia treated by renal stenting. The primary entry tear was located in 7 patients less than 2 cm from the origin of the left subclavian artery which was covered by the stent-graft. Results: After a follow-up ranging from 2 to 10 months, all patients are in a good condition with no signs of paraplegia. TAA: Technical success with complete exclusion of the aneurysm was evident in all cases. Dissection: 1 technical complication (6.25 %) was observed during stent-graft deployment of antegrade extension of the dissection into the ascending aorta which was surgically managed. In all cases progressive thrombosis of the false lumen developed. In 3 cases (18.7 %) an endoleak was detected: one, originating from the subclavian artery was treated by coil embolization; one sealed spontaneously after 6 months; the last one is under control. Conclusion: Endovascular techniques represent a new frontier in the treatment of thoracic dissection and TAA, but further evaluations are mandatory to clearly understand its efficacy. ",

Mart\u00ednez-Morillo; M\u00e1laga/ES Purpose: Most of the computational problems in segmentation are originated by tortuous contours which are difficult to be perceives by either a computer segmentation program or a human observer. A method based on successive interactive segmentations of breast masses in digitised mammograms to plot the probability of location of the mass contour is introduced. Materials and methods: 81 digitised mammograms including 94 masses with different type of margins were studied. The border of each mass was outlined with a digitising tablet, encompassing all densities considered as part of the mass, including spicules and tracts. Two observers repeated the same procedure three times. The segmentations of the same image were split off between them 48 hours at least. A labelled image was obtained from the six binary images of each case, giving seven possible values per pixel, from 0 to 6. Thus, the lines that delimit each value are considered \"isoprobability lines\", encompassing a probability equal to 1.00; 0.83; 0.67; 0.50; 0.33 and 0.17 to find the mass margin. Results: When the margin is well defined the isoprobability lines are closed one each other, with a sharp transition from 1 to 0. In exchange, when the margin is illdefined obscured or speculated, the isoprobability lines spread out. In those combined type margins the uncertainly zones are clearly distinguished from well defined zones. Conclusion: Images obtained by this method can be used as a reference pattern to evaluate automatic or semi-automatic computer-aided segmentation systems of breast masses. Results: MFE-VQ employing 16, 25, and 36 CVs identified clusters that could be attributed to known suspicious regions in each case. The lesions could clearly be differentiated from surrounding tissue. In 7 patients, single clusters could be related to motion artifacts based on signal dynamics and cluster localization. In addition, a self-organized subclassification within the lesions could be achieved in up to 4 clusters w.r.t. fine-grained local differences in MRI signal amplitude and dynamics.",

Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of a new technique for perfusion weighted colour display of lung parenchyma density derived from multi-slice CT (MSCT) data sets for visualization of pulmonary embolism (PE). Methods and materials: Imaging of patients with suspected PE was performed on a MSCT (Somatom Volume Zoom; Siemens, Forchheim, Germany) after intravenous application of 120 cm 3 of contrast-medium. Based on thin collimation axial slices (slice thickness 1.25 mm, reconstruction increment 0.8 mm), a new image processing technique was deployed. Automated 3D-segmentation of the lungs was performed followed by threshold based extraction of major airways and vascular structures. The filtered volume data were color encoded and finally overlayed onto the original CT-images. This color encoded display was presented in axial, coronal and sagittal plane orientation. In ten patients with excluded PE as well as in ten patients with proven PE the new technique was performed. Results: In ten patients, considered negative regarding PE on MSCT, lung densitometry showed a homogeneous distribution of color encoded densities without circumscribed decreased or increased areas. In the patient group with proven PE, low density values on perfusion weighted colour maps were found distally to the occluded pulmonary arteries. Conclusion: Our initial experience indicates that lung densitometry with an optimized colour encoded display of the density distribution within the lung parenchyma may provide additional information in patients with suspected or proven PE. The evaluation of first-pass myocardial perfusion imaging in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) represents a complex issue in the field of cardiac MRI. Commercially available software allows placement of regions of interests (ROIs) into the myocardium and calculation of mean signal-intensity over time. However, small perfusion defects may be missed using this method due to the large area of ROIs. Purpose of our study was to develop a pixel-based evaluation software for MR myocardial perfusion images.",

Myocardial perfusion measurements were performed in 10 patients with angiographically proven CAD using a SR-TrueFISP-2D-sequence (TR 2.4 ms/TE 1.2 ms). MR perfusion data were analysed with our software and compared to SPECT and angiography. Results: Data of 8 patients could be adequately analysed with the software developed. Parameters upslope and area-under-the-curve in regions found to be malperfused by MRI correlated well with angiographically detected coronary artery stenosis and hypoperfused areas detected by SPECT. Main limitation of the method was incorrect registration of images, caused by cardiac arrhythmia and patient motion. Conclusions: Semi-automated pixel-based analysis of perfusion measurement is possible and the promising results of this analysis correlate with angiographic and SPECT findings. Artefact free data acquisition and image registration are important and the limiting factor for pixel-based analysis. Purpose: To evaluate clinical feasibility of spatial domain filtering as an alternative to additional image reconstruction using different kernels in chest CT. Methods and materials: 40 adult patients with clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism were examined utilizing multi-slice CT (Somatom Volume Zoom, Siemens, Germany). Two sets of images were reconstructed using lung (B50) and soft tissue (B30) kernels, respectively. Additionaly, B50 images were filtered in the spatial domain, producing images largely equivalent to B30 images. Diagnostic images were compared to the initially reconstructed B30 images. Subjective image quality was rated using a three point scale (1 = excellent, 2 = fair, 3 = nondiagnostic). Results: Filtered images provided 10 central emboli, 19 segemental thrombi and 20 emboli on the subsegmental level in the 20 patients with proven pulmonary embolism. Latter was excluded in the other 20 subjects. Subjective gradings of image quality, based on soft tissue settings were comparable for all data sets.

Methods and material: 22 patients with previous abdominal CT or US underwent spiral CT during the arterial and the portal phase with the following parameters: collimation 3 mm, feed 4.5 mm, pitch 1.5, increment 1 mm. Images were sent to a workstation running on a NT platform equipped with Vitrea 2.0 (Vital Images, USA) allowing 3D reconstructions in order to generate volume rendering of the liver vascular supply. Density values of portal vessel (P) and liver (L) parenchyma were measured and correlated with 3D image quality and the parameters of three different opacity curves (OC) utilized to obtained them. Results: Better visualisation of arterial supply was obtained with non linear opacity curves. It was possible to clearly demostrate them up to the fifth generation. Significative correlations were observed between curve parameters (C), liver and portal vessels densities ratios (C vs P and C vs L r = 0.67 and r = 0.82 respectively for linear OC and r = 0.82 and r = 0.84 for non linear OC). Correlation between C and 3D image quality was r = 0.22 and r = 0.52 for linear and non linear OC respectively. P/L density ratio poorly correlate with 3D image quality r = 0.34.

Kolosz\u00e1r; Budapest/HU Purpose: Virtual colonoscopy is a non-invasive computerized medical examination method for examining the interior of the human colon, aiding the detection of polyps. Nowadays systems for this purpose are slow and/or require special hardware and have many other problems making their usage difficult and limited. Our purpose was to develop a system without these disadvantages. Materials and methods: In our study we have examined the most popular approaches to the problems of high-speed rendering and navigation within the colon, and devised our own algorithms. Our intent was to make them fast and reliable enough to be implementable on a consumer-end PC system, instead of state of the art high-end workstations, and to minimize off-line calculations. Results: We present our idea of a real-time direct volume rendering based visualization technique combined with an on-line computer aided interactive navigation method for the examination of volume data constructed from CT scans. These algorithms have been implemented in our colon visualization program called ColVis. The results are promising, the current implementation is close to the real-time requirements (\u223c 2 seconds/frame). Conclusion: According to our results virtual colonoscopy can be an everyday diagnostic method in the near future. Results: ACL and PCL avulsion fractures occurred with equal frequency. ACL avulsion fractures occurred more commonly in adults than previously believed. About one half of ACL avulsion fractures are partial, involving the anteromedial bundle only, one quarter are comminuted and one-half are extended. PCL avulsion fractures occur in an older age group than ACL avulsion fractures. The majority are complete, half are comminuted (between the individual PCL bundles) and half are extended. When compared to anteroposterior and lateral radiographs, CT is helpful at delineating the fracture margins (for Type I and II fractures) and at delineating comminution and extent in PCL injuries.

Results: The sensitivities and specificities for the detection of ACL tears were 90 % and 96 %, respectively, at initial interpretation and 95 % and 99 %, respectively, at retrospective interpretation. The sensitivities and specificities for the detection of meniscal tears in ACL-abnormal knees were 92 % and 88 %, respectively, at prospective initial interpretation and 96 % and 94 %, respectively, at retrospective interpretation. Conclusion: Dual-detector spiral CT arthrography of the knee is an accurate method for detecting ACL and associated meniscal tears. 2D-TOF unenhanced and 3D-spoiled-GRE contrast-enhanced images were acquired. Unmatched, randomized evaluation of images was performed on-site and by two off-site blinded reviewers. The change from unenhanced MRA in total diagnostic quality (TDQ) was evaluated for each patient using a five-point scale. Evaluation was made also of the number of vascular lesions detected, confidence in lesion characterization and the ability to grade stenoses. A full safety assessment was performed. Results: Both off-site reviewers noted a significant improvement in TDQ from preto post-contrast at all but the lowest dose. The increase appeared to plateau at 0.1 mmol/kg. The dose effect was significant for the on-site reviewers (p = 0.005) and off-site reviewer 2 (p < 0.001) but not for off-site reviewer 1 (p = 0.06). For all but the lowest dose group, Gd-BOPTA increased (a) the number of patients with lesions detected and, for most patients, the number of lesions detected per patient; (b) confidence in lesion characterization; (c) the percentage of stenoses visualized clearly enough for grading (reviewers 1 and 2 graded 80 -95 % and 57 -80 % of stenoses, respectively). All doses were well tolerated. The overall incidence of adverse events was 9.6 %. Conclusion: CE-MRA of the pelvic arteries using Gd-BOPTA is safe and significantly more effective than TOF-MRA. A dose of 0.1 mmol/kg appears the most suitable. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of blood pool contrast-enhanced MRA to visualize the arterial and venous vessel tree and to detect deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities. Material and methods: Nine consecutive patients with pulmonary embolism (mean age: 46 \u00b1 9) were randomized to various doses of NC100150 (between 0.75 and 6 mg Fe/kg b.w.). A T1W 3D-GRE sequence (TE: 2.0 ms, TR: 5.0 ms) was used. Two observers blinded to the dose of contrast agent assessed image quality, contrast attenuation and appearance of thrombi.Results: Qualitative assessment of overall MRA image quality and semiquantitative vessel scoring revealed good to excellent delineation of venous and arterial vessel segments independent of the dose of NC100150. However, quantitative ROI analysis revealed a significantly higher S/N ratio in the high dose group compared to the mid and low dose groups of NC100150 (p < 0.01). Between dose groups, S/N ratio was independent of vessel type (artery or vein) and vessel segment localization (proximal or distal). All seven venous thrombi (mean length 7.2 \u00b1 0.95 cm) were characterized by a very low SI, which was only 16.6 \u00b1 7 % of the SI in adjacent venous segments (p < 0.0001).Conclusions: High quality MR angiograms of the lower extremities can be obtained using low concentrations of NC100150 in combination with a strong T1W 3D-GRE sequence. The obvious delineation of venous thrombi suggest that this technique may be potentially used as a non-invasive \"one-stop shopping\" tool in the evaluation of thromboembolic disease.",

Wentz 1 ; 1 Winterthur/CH, 2 W\u00e4denswil/CH Purpose: To verify the hypothesis, that with a defined amount of 27 g iodine a higher injection rate of diluted contrast media (Iobitridol) results in higher vessel enhancement in pulmonary CTA Methods and materials: After bolus timing, CTAs were performed in 93 patients divided into 2 groups: group A with 48 patients (age 66 \u00b1 17 a, 90 ml CM, 300 mg/ml concentration, flow 3 ml/s) and group B with 45 patients (age 66 \u00b1 15 a, 108 ml CM, 250 mg/ml concentration, flow 4 ml/s). Each CM application was followed by a saline flush of 30 ml. Contrast enhancement of the pulmonary trunc, right and left main arteries and lower lobe arteries was measured. Results: Contrast enhancement of the pulmonary trunc was 342 \u00b1 87 HU in group A and 382 \u00b1 80 HU in group B, the right pulmonary artery 321 \u00b1 86 and 352 \u00b1 79 HU, the left pulmonary artery 311 \u00b1 83 and 353 \u00b1 78 HU. In the right lower lobe artery contrast enhancement was 309 \u00b1 88 HU in group A and 335 \u00b1 83 HU in group B, the left lower lobe artery 310 \u00b1 88 and 342 \u00b1 84 HU and the mean enlancement values of all measured pulmonary arteries was 319 \u00b1 86 and 353 \u00b1 82 HU. The effect on vascular enhancement was most significant (z-test, two sided p-values) in the pulmonary trunc (p = 0.002) followed by all measured pulmonary arteries (p = 0.05) and least remarkable in the lower lobe arteries.",

            "text": "With an identical amount of 27 g iodine, the higher injection rate of diluted CM leads to a significant increase of vessel enhancement in CTA of the pulmonary vasculature. With exact bolus timing this can be used to reduce the applied dose of iodine per patient. Purpose: To evaluate prospectively diagnostic accuracy of 1 mol gadobutrol as a contrast agent for intraarterial X-ray digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in comparison to iodinated, non-ionic contrast media and 0.5 mol gadolinium-DTPA. Methods: Flush arteriograms (ascending, descending, abdominal aorta, iliac and femoral arteries) and selective angiograms (carotid, renal and visceral arteries) were obtained from bilateral femoral arterial access (5 F sheaths) in ten domestic pigs (70 kg body weight). Digital subtracted angiograms were obtained during injecton of non-diluted 1 mol gadobutrol, 300 mg I/ml iopromide, or 0.5 mol gadopentetate. Injection parameters (volume and velocity) were similar for all three contrast agents. In paired arteries, two different contrast media were used during the same angiographic run. Diagnostic quality and accuracy of the angiograms were evaluated on a three-step scale by three independent blinded investigators. Results: Sufficient angiographic images were obtained in 90 % of cases using iodinated contrast material. Gadobutrol achieved sufficient non-selective angiograms in 64 %. Selective angiograms were sufficient in 98 % using iodinated contrast material, 90 % using 1 mol Gadobutrol and 48 % using 0.5 mol Gd-DTPA. Adverse reactions to any of the used contrast agents were not noted. Conclusion: 1 mol Gadobutrol solution allows X-ray digital subtraction angiography with an diagnostic accuracy equivalent to 300 mg/ml iodinated contrast media, if selective injections are performed. Flush aortograms are of inferior image quality to iodinated contrast material. 1M Gadobutrol achieves significantly better image quality compared with 0.5 mol gadolimium solutions.",

Fraioli, F. Pediconi, A. Napoli, I. Reitano, R. Passariello; Rome/IT Purpose: Multislice CT (MSCT) has already proved a very accurate technique in the assessment of different vascular pathologies. Purpose of this study was to determine whether high iodine concentration non ionic contrast agent could improve vascular enhancement and vessel conspicuity. Material and methods: 60 patients referred for MSCT angiography (MSCTA) of the aorta and peripheral arteries were included in the study. All examinations were performed with a MSCT using a fixed delay time of 28 seconds. In all patients a standard amount of 40 g of iodine was administered at 4 ml/s. All patients were randomly assigned to one of three following groups: group 1 consisting of 100 ml of 400 mg I/ml; group 2 consisting of 113 ml of 350 mg I/ml; group 3 consisting of 133 ml of 300 mg I/ml. ROIs were obtained at different. A qualitative assessment was also made by two observers, regarding image quality and vessel conspicuity. Results: No significant difference was detected between the 350 and the 400 mg I/ml contrast agents at the level of the aorta, pelvic and thigh arteries; a 13 % difference was found between the 300 and 400 mg I/ml in the same districts. With the 400 mg I/ml a significant increase in vascular enhancement of respectively 16 and 21 % was seen in the popliteal and infrapopliteal arteries. Conclusion: A significant improvement in contrast enhancement and vessel conspicuity can be achieved in MSCTA by means of high iodine concentration contrast agents.",
