            "text": "From the middle 1980s to the middle 1990s, thin section CT has been shown to provide improved c1arity of parenchymal abnormalities, thus enabling a better and more confident characterization of disease processes even in severely involved areas. This progressive improvement in CT assessment of diffuse infiltrative lung disease has been possible by means of pathologic-CT correlations which have led the radiologists to understand the pathologie substratum of CT abnormalities. Among the various CT signs evaluated by pathologic-CT correlations, ground glass opacity has raised particular attention as it was expected to reflect an active inflammatory process. Whereas this assumption was validated, it has been shown that this CT feature could also correspond to mild forms of lung fibrosis. Several micronodular patterns have been progressively described: (a) well-defined micronodules, suggestive of inflammatory lesions located within the interstitium; (b) ill-defined micronodules, related to bronchiolar changes of various origins. The clinical significance of subpleural micronodules, mainly observed in sarcoidosis, silicosis and Iymphangitic carcinomatosis, was established by means of lung biopsies or correlative studies using surgical specimens, scanned immediately after surgery. The purpose of this lecture is to help the radiologist memorize the significance of the most frequently encountered CT features by means of descriptions of their corresponding pathological substratum.",

            "text": "The range of lung diseases in which there is a significant component of small airways involvement at a pathologie level is wide and includes conditions usually regarded as interstitial in location, as weil as those centred on the airways. Clear definition of the terminology is desirable but there remains considerable confusion in the c1inical and pathological literature. The apparently simple term \"small airways disease\" is defined differently by pathologists, physiologists and physicians. Diseases affecting the small airways are difficult to detect by conventional radiographie and physiologie tests. Widespread involvement occurs before symptoms and abnormalities on lung func!ion testing become apparent. Obstruction of the bronchioles may be detected indirectly on CT because regional under-ventilation results in reduced perfusion which in turn is shown as areas of decreased attenuation of the lung parenchyma, the so-calied mosaic pattern typicaily seen in constrictive obiiterative bronchiolitis. When there is considerable inflammation of the bronchioles with concomitant exudate the airways may become visible on CT, for example in cases of diffuse panbronchiolitis. An understanding of the distribution of disease in relation to the airways at a pathologie level allows some prediction of the likely CT appearances in this wide spectrum of conditions, and thus helps to refine the differential diagnosis.",

            "text": "Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP): quantitative and qualitative comparison between free breathing sequences (3D turbo spin echo and inversion recovery turbo spin echo) and respiratory triggered 3D turbo spin echo sequence N. Papanikolaou, A.H. Karantanas, A. Ghiatas, N. Gourtsoyiannis; Athens/GR Purpose: To assess respiratory triggering technique in improving the image quality of turbo spin echo (3d TSE) sequences for visualisation of pancreatobiliary tree. Methods and Materials: Twenty-five patients were examined with nontriggered (noRT) 3d TSE, 3d IR-TSE and respiratory triggered (RT) 3d TSE sequences. All images were reviewed independently while qualitative comparison was made by grading relative conspicuity of pancreatobiliary tree and evaluating the respiratory degradation of the images. Quantitative comparison was made by calculating signal to noise ratio (SNR) of common bile duct (CBD), main pancreatic duc! (MPD) and gallbladder (GB). Contrast to noise ratio (CNR) between CBD and liver and GB and liver were additionally calculated. Results: Respiratory triggering improved the conspicuity of all pancreatobiliary segments (p < 0.05) except CBD where non-RT and RT techniques proved statistically equivalent (p > 0.05). All three sequences provided statistically equivalent SNR of CBD, GB and MPD. In addition equivalent CNR was provided between CBD, GB and Iiver by all three sequences. Conclusion: 3D TSE sequences may offer better conspicuity of the pancreatobiliary tree due to efficient reduction of motion artifacts. Steady patient respiratory cycle is mandatory prerequisite in achieving optimal image quality. Purpose: To evaluate, whether application of negative oral contrast agent improves the diagnostic reliability of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreaticography (MRCP). Methods and Materials: We examined 50 patients with lesions (tumors, stones, inflammation, stenoses) of the hepatobiliary and pancreatic system as weil as patients after choledochojejunostomy. All examinations were performed on a 1.5 T system (Philips ACS NT). MRCP was performed as a single slice (100 mm) RARE slab in breathhold technique. The MRCP examination was acquired before and after oral application of negative oral contrast agent (Lumirem, Laboratoire Guerbet, Aulnay sous Bois, France). The images were evaluated by two readers (E.F., F.F.) in consensus. Results: Diagnoslic reliability of MRCP was significantly improved by the effect of the negative oral contrast agent. In plain images the region of interest was overlayed by high-intensity fluid in the stomach and the duodenum, as weil as as other small bowel structures. By application of Lumirem the visualization of hepatobiliary and pancreatic ducts was facilitated due the lack of overlaying intestinal fluid. Especially the region of the papilla Vateri could be judged more reliably. 108 patients, who have undergone eholeeystectomy, 83 with suspected panereatobiliary disease and 25 patients without symptoms referrable to the biliary tract or panereatie duct. MRCP findings correlated with those at Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), cross-sectional imaging and elinical follow-up. Results: MRCP was successful in all patients. 48 patients had normal MRI findings and required no further intervention. In 60 patients ductal dilatation was shown. Choledocholithiasis was depicted in 21 of them. Other findings were benign strictures of the bile ducts and the papilla (16), cholangiocareinoma (7), pancreatic carcinoma (4), chronic pancreatitis (6), cystie malformation of the bile ducts (6). The overall aecuraey of the method was 98%. False positive results were due to pneumobilia and multiple strietures. MRCP delineated the pancreatobilliary tract, so that ERCP was obviated at first by excluding choledocholithiasis and helped determine therapeutic options. Conelusion: MRCP offers a non-invasive, accurate evaluation of the pancreatic and biliary tracts in the care of post-cholecystectomy patients. Purpose: To eompare magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) in the diagnosis of hilar cholangiocarcinomas (Klatskin's tumors) and to evaluate the use of complementary MR imaging of the Iiver. Methods and Materials: MRC and ERC studies were performed in 21 patients with proven Klatskin's tumors within a 2 weeks period. ERC was performed in standard technique by an experienced endoscopist. MR studies were performed in breathold technique on a 1.5 T imager. For MRC heavily T2-weighted thick-section RARE and thin-section HASTE sequenees were performed. Complementary Iiver imaging included T2weighted HASTE and T1-weighted FLASH sequences pre and post gadolinium. Blinded reading of MRC, ERC and MR imaging was performed. Results: MRC detected 21/21 Klatskin's tumors, whereas ERC detected only 19/21 tumors (90%). In 2 patients with preexisting primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and hilar cholangiocarcinoma , ERC findings were false negatively interpreted as related to PSC only. On complementary MR imaging, tumor in the hepatic hilum was depicted in all 21 cases, and in 6 cases satellite tumors or hepatic metastases could be demonstrated. Conelusion: Our preliminary data suggest that MRC performes at least as good as ERC in the diagnosis of Klatskin's tumors. Additional MR imaging of the Iiver is a helpful adjunct for staging these tumors.",

They were given 600 ce of water to drink at the end of a routine upper abdominal scan. No paralytic agents were used. Patients were scanned using a 5 MHz or a 7 MHz ultrasound probes. Results: Gastric walilayers were clearly demonstrated in all 20 (100%) of patients namely mucosa, submucosa, musculosa and serosa. Diffuse gastric wall thickening is considered (type I). This was seen in 16 (80%) of the 20 patients. Their wall thickness varied from 6-10 mms. Focal polypoid wall thickening (type 11) was noted in 2 (10%). The polypoid mucosa was characterised by distortion of the gastric wall layers. This excluded normal rugae. Presence of circumferentially polypoid mucosa (type 111) \"shark mouth appearance\" was seen in 2 (10%) of the 20 patients. If no varices were visable the subgroup should be 1a, Ila, or lila respectively. Associated gastric varices were seen in the four (20%) of the 20 patients with either focal polypoid mucosa IIb (one patient) or circumferentially polypoid mucosa IIlb (three patients). Conelusion: WETCUS is a non-invasive screening technique for BCG that can replace endoscopic ultrasound in portal hypertensive patients. We suggest a simple classification for BCG.",

Passariello; Rome/I Purpose: to evaluate the technical feasibility and the diagnostic accuracy of volume-rendered virtual gastroscopy. Methods and Materials: Five volunteers and thirteen patients with known gastric disease underwent virtual gastroscopy. Non-contrast spiral CT (Somatom Plus 4, Siemens, G) examination of the upper abdomen was performed. The stomach was distended with air and glucagon was administered in order to reduce persistaltic movements. Images were obtained with 5 mm collimation, pitch 1-1.6,3 mm reconstruction. Reconstructions were performed on a 02 workstation (Silicon Graphichs, Mountain View, CA, USA) using Vitrea 1.0 software (Vital Images, Fairfield, lowa). Results of virtual gastroscopy were correlated with conventional gastroscopy in all the patients. Results: Image quality was graded as optimal in 17 cases. In one case, the stomach was not distended and images were not diagnostic, due to uncooperative patient. Virtual endoscopy images correclly depicted gastric tumors in all the cases; in atrophie gastritis the loss of mucosal plicae was evaluated; mild alterations of the mucosal surface as weil as one case of early gastric cancer were missed. Conelusion: virtual gastroscopy is a noninvasive imaging modality for the evaluation of gastric lumen. Preliminary results are promising, although further technical improvements are necessary for evaluating gastric mucosa. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to correlate gastric wall layers visible at MRI to the anatomical structure of the gastric wall. Methods and Materials: Postmortem specimens of the prepyloric antrum of 5 human stomaehs were imaged by an experimental 2.4 T MR-unit (Bruker). T2-weighted multi spin-echo imaging (TRITE 2000/80 ms) of the gastric specimens was performed. After MR-imaging had been completed the specimens were embedded in paraffin, cut into slices of 6 nm and stained with HE. The anatomical layers of the gastric wall visible on microscopic evaluation were compared with those revealed by MRI. Results: At MRI four layers of the gastric wall were visible. There was a typical signal intensity (SI) pattern of the gastric wall that corresponded to its anatomical layers as folIows: most inner layer -intermediate SI =mucosa.",

Conelusion: In-vitro MRI enabled differentiation of four layers of the gastric wall with a typical signal intensity pattern which exactly corresponded to the anatomical layers of the gastric wall. Thus MRI may have potential for the local staging of gastric cancer. Purpose: In an experimental setting MRI was performed to evaluate the MR-morphology of early gastric cancer. Methods and Materials: 65 stomaehs resected for gastric carcinoma were imaged by a 1 T MR-unit (Siemens Magnetom Expert) with the following sequences: T1-SE (TRITE 450/15 ms), a T2-TSE (3500/85 ms) and an opposed phase sequence (500/10/75\u00b0) with a FoV of 12-20 cm, 3-4 mm slices and a matrix size of 256 x 256. Histology revealed 12 specimens with early gastric carcinoma (T1-carcinoma). The MRstudies of these specimens were retrospectively evaluated for the site, signal intensity, morphology and infiltration depth of the tumors. Results: 10 of 12 (83%) T1-carcinomas were diagnosed on MRimages. 2 early gastric cancers at the bottom of an ulcer were not visible. The T2-weighted sequences were best suited for tumor diagnosis. The carcinomas (size 1-7 cm) showed homogeneous hypointense signal intensity on T2-weighted images, thickening of the gastric wall and destruction of its layered pattern. In 8 of 10 carcinomas not more than the first and second inner layer of the gastric wall was invaded. Conelusion: Experimental MRI does not only allow accurate diagnosis of early gastric cancer but also accurate T-staging in the majority of T1-carcinomas of the stomach that are visible on MR-images.",

Ravetli, GA Rollandi; Genoa/I Purpose: To describe the Spiral-CT appearance of gastric wall in patients with neoplastic and inflammatory diseases. Methods and Materials: We examined 48 patients (22 m, 26 f; 3 gastric MALT, 4 gastric Crohn, 1 Menetrier, 5 gastric ulcers, 6 gastric carcinomas), after gastric distension by 1000-2000 ce of tap water and by ipotonisation, by Spiral-CT (GE High Speed), during a bolus of iodinated contrast medium (Iopamiro 300 mgl/100 ml, 4 ml/s). We used two volumetrie acquisitions: during arterial phase (delay time 15-24 s, with bolus tracking), and during portal phase (delay from start acquisition 60-80 s); 3 mm slice thickness, pitch 1:1, 120 kV, 300 mAs, 0.8 s scan time, 1 mm reconstruction index. Results: The enhancement of gastric wall was high in all cases; involved segments were thickened in inflammatory and in malignant diseases. The wall had multilayered structure in Crohn disease and in MALT. Three layers were seen in Crohn; two layers were visible in MALT (submucosa was detectable). Homogeneous hyperdense wall was seen in other diseases Conelusion: Spiral CT allows detection of a different structural patterns in different pathologie conditions affecting the gastric wall. A standard technique using a 4F pigtail catheter was used. AP and decubitus views of the renal arteries were obtained. In aseparate 3 month period, 11 consecutive patients referred for angiography for the investigation of active GI haemorrhage underwent both iodinated contrast arteriography and C02 arteriography. Selective mesenteric catheterisation was performed in all cases. In both groups, carbon dioxide was delivered using the AngioDynamics C02JECT system. Results: 29/30 patients had renal arteriograms of diagnostic quality; 23 were supplemented with iodinated contras!. 6 patients had a C02 angiogram that was considered non diagnostic. 4/11 patients had an abnormality on the iodinated contrast mesenteric angiogram. In 2 cases, this represented active haemorrhage which in 1 case was also demonstrated on the C02 study. In the other 2, cases a non bleeding vascular abnormality was idenlified which was not seen on either of the corresponding C02 studies. Conelusion: C02 renal arteriography is capable of producing diagnostic images. However mesenteric C02 arteriography was more difficult to interpret, failed to show any advantage over iodinated contrast arteriography and did not demonstrate non bleeding vascular lesions. Purpose: The purpose of this prospective study was to compare the diagnostic efficiacy of conventional CE-MR-Angiography (MRA) with dynamic multiphase turbo-MRA (t-MRA) and intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and to optimize the relation of acquisition time to voxel size and other sequence parameters.

After the standard axial spiral scanning the MIP and 4D Angio reconstructions were obtained with the program installed in the PO 5000 software. All of the patients underwent also the renal angiography with a standard technique. Results of the examinations were compared later, after the evaluation by 2 independent radiologists. In each case we obtained an adequate and reliable image of the renal arteries anatomy in both studies. Using spiral CT angiography in one case we recognized the occlusion of the anterior branch of the left renal artery, and in five cases renal arteries stenoses -one of them revealed false positive after the angiographic evaluation. Adequate visualization of the renal vasculature is possible using the described technique of spiral CT angiography and it's surely the promising method for the evaluation of renal artery stenoses. Purpose: To explore the effect of continuous education of the various disciplines on the screening performance. Methods and Materials: At the end of 1997 the implementation of the nationwide mammographie screening has been completed in the Netherlands, resulting in 660.000 tests per year involving the age cohort 50-69 and with a screening interval of two years. All radiologists, radiographers and pathologists participating in the screening programme are trained in the National Expert and Training Centre in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, before the commencement of the screening. The Centre has the task to evaluate the medical performance of the various disciplines by means of site visits of the regional screening centres. At these visits, first, the overall screening results of the first and subsequent rounds are evaluated, second, mammograms of a one-day production are reviewed for positioning-and technical quality and third, screening and diagnostic mammograms of interval and screen-detected S1. 11 cancers are reviewed. Results: Results of site vlsits will be presented and reasons for regional variations will be discussed.",

Purpose: To study the acceptance of technical quality control (OC) procedures during breast cancer screening conform the European Guidelines in a decentralized health care system. Methods and Materials: Ouality control procedures of mammographie equipment, developer, film-screen-cassette systems, darkroom and Iightboxes have been implemented based on the European Guidelines in private radiological practices, small regional hospitals and in larger screening units. Costs and necessary daily time investment were maximally reduced. Major efforts went into sensibilization and explaining the quality control framework. After aperiod of 1 year, a survey was sent to 15 centers that complied to the European regulations.",

Eight centers confirmed that they are now in a stronger position with regard to service technicians. All centers had concrete results of the OC procedures. Two (smaller) practices questioned the cost effectiveness of the whole procedures. Only 1 center reports on a reduced throughput due to the necessity of the OC procedures. A major effect is the sensibilization for a more global quality management in the radiology department, Conclusion: OC was weil accepted in our region. Purpose: To assess the effects of mammographie parenchymal patterns on the risk of breast cancer detected at first screen, second screen and in the interval between two screens. Methods and Materials: We conducted a nested case-control study within a screening cohort in East Anglia. The study population consisted on 502 prevalence screen cases, 198 interval cancer cases and 175 first incidence screen cases, and 2601 matched controls. The mammographie parenchymal patterns of breast tissue were assessed according to Wolfe's classification. Statistical analysis was by conditional logistic regression. Results: Overall, 67% of cases and 59% of controls had high-risk pattern (P2 + DY) mammogram. The risk associated with P2 or DY mammographic patterns compare to N1 was higher for interval cancers (OR of 2.2 and 2.4 respectively) than for screen-detected cancers (OR of 1.7 and 1.1 respectively). For interval cancers in the first 18 months after the last negative mammogram, the risk was particularly elevated (OR of 3.8 for P2 and 4.1 for DY compared to N1). High risk associated with P2 and DY patterns was concentrated on invasive ductal grade 3 cancers (OR's of 2.7 and 3.8) rather than grade 1 or 2 cancers (OR's of 1.6 and 1.2 ",

We are trying to evaluate breast CT in measuring the size and volume of those tumors , and the dynam ic enhancement before and after chemotherapy. Methods and Materials: 58 ABC underwent CT precontrast slices of the breast , adynamie study after IV contrast, then a conventional CT of the breast after reinjection of contrast. 30 patients had a helical CT of the breast. 40 ABC underwent surgery, allowing pathological correlation. Results: After chemotherapy, the decrease of tumor was significiant in 31 cases (53%) and was correlated to the decrease of dynamic enhancement. Tumor volume was not modified by treatment in 27 ABC (47%) and dynamic study showed an increased (n = 10) or an unchanged enhancement (n =17). Residual tumor (n =40) sizes were similar to enhanced CT tumor size (+/-12%). Conclusion: Evaluation of local efficacy of chemotherapy on ABC can be perform with breast CT. This study shows an acceptable correlation between pathology and CT. Correlation between tumor volume decrease and enhancement decrease after treatment may be a possible new parameter related to prognosis . Purpose: To assess the HCT performan ce in nodal staging of breast cancers . Methods and Materials: Sixteen patients with positive FNAC for breast carcinoma underwent HCT before surgical excision and axillary dissection (matrix 5122 ; field of view 35 0 42 cm; 120 kV; 150 or 200 mA; X-ray beam 5 rnrn: pitch 1). A 30 s scan of 15 cm of body length was acqu ired before and 1, 3, and 8 minules after i.v, bolus injection of nonionic iodined contrast agent. The nodes >1 cm in diameter without inner fat at plain scans were recorded, as weil as the nodes with enhancement >70% at least in one of the three post-contrast scans. Results: Primary cancers were 15 invasive ductal and 1 invasive lobular carcinomas, ranging in diameter 4-30 mm ; metastatic involvement of one ore more nodes was pathologically proved in 12/16 patients. Plain HCT showed 45% sensit ivity and 100% specificity for nodal metastatic involvement, while enhanced HCT showed 100% sensitivity and 80% specificity. Positive predictive values were 100% for plain HCT and 92% for enhan ced HCT; negative predictive values were 45% and 100%, respect ively. Conclusion: Contrast admin istration allowed a better HCT performance in detecting nodal metastatic involvement from breast cancer. CT cortical bone mineral density and thickness (cBMD, cTh) and tibial DXA BMD were computed. Intcrgroup differences were assessed by analysis of variance and reported as percent variation of the measurement explained by group assignment. Results: SOS correlated significantly with cBMD, cTh and DXA BMD (all r2 = 0.4). Multiple regression with both cBMD and cTh against SOS yielded r2 = 0.5, both parameters contributed equally. We found the following significant intergroup differences: cBMD 45%, cTh 42%, DXA BMD 35% , SOS 30% variation. SOS intergroup difference became non-significant when corrected for either CT parameter, but not when corrected for DXA BMD. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the SOS measurement depends on both bone thickness and dens ity and does not add new information to these parameters, whereas it adds information to the DXA measurement.",

Methods and Materials: Participants for the study were 186 postmenopausal women. Bone mineral density (BMO) was determined by dual X-ray absorpliometry. Broadband Ultrasound Attenuation (BUA) and Speed of Sound (SOS) measurements of the calcaneus were performed using an ultrasonometer with transmission imaging. The automatie ROI was defined as the circular region , 15 mm in diameter, of minimum attenuation in the posterior part of the calcaneus. Results: The reproducibility values (CV%) were 1.35% for BUA and 0.24% for SOS. Significant correlations were found between ultrasound parameters and BMO measurements at the spine and hip (r = 0.64 and 0.68 respectively, p < 0.0001 for BUA, r = 0.48 and 0.49 respectively, p < 0.0001 for SOS) . There was a decrease in ultrasound parameters with the area of the posterior region of the calcaneus which was significant for BUA (p < 0.001) but not significant for SOS. This might be attr ibuted to substantial differences in the slze of the calcaneus among individuals. Concluslon: Broadband ultrasound attenuation imaging improves the precision of ultrasound measurements. Both ultrasound parameters were highly correlated with lumbar and hip BMO. The optimal ROI size depends on the size of the calcaneus of each patient. Purpose: Some asthmatics are smaller than age and sex matched controls. This is said to be caused by glucocorticoids .

Svane, S. Rotstein, I. Lax; Stockholm/S Radiation induced heart and lung complications can become a major problem in the future as breast conserving treatments in combination with radiotherapy is gradually increasing. Very few patients suffer from radiation induced acute pneumon itis but recently long-term effects Iike increased mortality in heart deseases has been reported . The importance of long-term effects on lung tissue is still under debate and need further investigations. Methods and Materials: The material consists of sixteen disease-free breast cancer patients primarily operated with a partial mastectomy or a modified radical mastectomy (MRM) . All patients were given adjuvant radiotherapy. CT-examinations of the lung with at least three scans in transverse sections were performed to determine lung density before treatment, three and nine months after completion of radiotherapy to follow the early effects on lung tissue and in order to investigate the long-term effects the examinations were repeated 4 and 12 years efter radiotherapy. Lung density was determined fro m the mean of the pixel values within the anterior-Iateral quarte r of the lung. Results: All visible focal radiological findings decreased in size as weil as in number when the examinations within the first year after radiation therapy were compared with the exam inations at 4 and 12 years. These findings were all within the anterior-Iateral quarter of the lung where the radiation dose was highest. The differences in lung density among those with and those without radiolog ical focal findings were statistically significant at the examinations at 3 and 9 months respectively but did not persist at 4 and 12 years. However, in patients without focal findings the general lung density increased 1.4 at four years compared to before start. Conclusion: The results indicate a 2-phase development of radiation induced lung damages. An acute phase with visible focal findings and a late phase with a general increase in lung density.",

In 14 patient an axial Fast Multiplanar Spoiled Gradient Recalied (FMPSPGR) dynam ic sequence after i.v, injection of Gadolin ium DTPA was also performed. Basing upon the current literature criteria an MR staging of local spread of the tumor was done. All the patients underwent radica l prostatectomy and hystologic macrosections were obtained from the surgical spec imens . A comparative evaluation of MRI and hystolog ical staging was done and the accuracy of MRI in detecting capsular penetration , seminal vescical involvement and prostatic apex involvement was assessed. Results: MRI correctly staged 31 out of 40 cases (78%). The MRI accura cy was respectevely 80% in detect ing capsular penetration (sensitivity: 85 .7%, specificity 73.6%); 87.5 % in seminal vescical involvement (sens itivity 88 .3% , specificity 89 .2%) and 72.5% in prostatic apex involvement (sensitivity 79.1 %, specific ity 62.1%). Dynamic evaluation after Gadolin ium DTPA did not improve the staging accuracy. Conclusion: In our series MRI showed a good accuracy in detect ing seminal vescical involvemen t and a moderate accura cy in demonstrating capsular penetration and apex involvement.",

            "text": "Purpose: To assess the usefulness of MR enhancement characteristics in detecting and staging prostate carcinoma . Methods and Materials: Dynamic FLASH MR enhancement studies follow ing bolus Gd-DTPA were performed in 16 patients with biopsy proven prostate cancer in the peripheral zone (PZ). After a first sequence without injection , four sequen ces were repeated at 20 s, 45 s. 70 s, 95 s respectively after bolus injection. Substraction images and ROI measurements were correlated with high resolution T2W images to identify the presence, localization, and tumoral staging of abnormal regions in PZ. Correlations were done (T 2 W substraction images and ROI) with histopathological findings obtained by biopsyguided ultrasound. Results: Significant differences were noted between normal and tumour tissues with a maximum tumour Gd-DTPA concentration between 45 and 70 s of delay. There was no additional findings for localization in comparison with T2W images. These later provided better images quality. For tumoral staging, the classical T 2W was always more accurate. There was no correlation between the maximum amplitude or washout delay and histological findings. Conclusion: Dynamic MR Enhancement with substraction images did not provide additional information concern ing localization and staging of prostate cancer, by comparison to classical T 2W images . Purpose: To improve the visualization of the neurovascular bundle and to determine the c1inical significance of initial results obtained with this new method. Methods and Materials: Ten patients with c1inically suspected prostate cancer were examined with a comb ined endorectallbody phased-array coil on a 1.5 Tesla MR imager. The prostate was imaged with axial and coronal T2-we ighted TSE sequen ces and an axial T1-we ighted seque nce before and after contrast agent administration. In addition, fast contrast-enhanced (GD-DTPA) angiography (512 matrix) with visualization of the arterial and venous phase was performed. Peristais is was suppressed by Buscopan . All patients underwent prostatectomy. Results: The internal iliac vessels were visualized bilaterally in all cases. The inferior vesica I artery was Iikewise depicted anterior to the endorektal coil, The venous plexus surrounding this artery was seen during the venous phase. Not surprisingly, the nerves could not be seen directly. All cancers investigated were restricted to the prostate . Conclusion: The technique of fast contrast-enhanced MR Ang iography visualizes the neurovascular bundle in a quality that has so far only been achieved with conventional angiography. In the further course of the study, it is planned to investigate the correlation of nerve lesions leading to incontinence and impotence with vascular lesions of the neurovascular bundle. Purpose: To assess the effectiveness of MR imaging to predict the positive biopsy results in the diagnos is of prostate cancer for patients at intermediate-risk. Methods and Materials: We performed a prospective endorectal MR imaging study with 81 patients at intermed iate-risk to detect prostate cancer. Intermediate-risk was defined as: Prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) levels between 4 and 10ng/ml or PSA levels > 10 ng/ml but negative digital rectal examination (DRE) or PSA levels progressivaly higher (0.75 ng/mllyear). A transrectal sextant biopsy was performed after the MRI exam, and also of the area of suspiction detected by MRI.",

            "text": "Methods and Materials: We studied 56 renal transplants: 20 normally functioning grafts (Group I) and 36 presenting with biopsy diagnosed chronic rejection (Group 11). Power Doppler US, using a 7.5 MHz probe, was performed before and after slow injection (70-120 sees) of 10 ml echo enhancer (Levovist SHU-508-A, concentration 200 mg/mi). Morphological evaluation (Pattern Type and Grade) and quantitative evaluation (mean pixel value) were performed. Results: The morphological evaluation showed an improvement of Pattern Type and Grade resulting in a better depiction of the interlobular vessels in nearly all patients. Thus areas lacking in colour signal before echo enhancer were visible after contrast enhancement. Group I presented astronger enhancement as compared to Group II and also the quantitative evaluation of mean pixel values showed a statistically significant difference between the two groups. Conclusion: Power Doppler US examination using echo enhancer permits a better visualization of the cortical vasculature, a correct evaluation of the damage and a quantitative differentiation of normally functioning grafts and chronic rejection. Purpose: Aim of this work in progress is to evaluate the morphological and quantitative aspects of wash-in wash-out curves in normal grafts and in trans plant pathologies. Final aim will be to differentiate renal transplant diseases. Methods and Materials: Until now we have studied 10 normally functioning grafts (control group), 8 biopsy diagnosed cases of chronic rejection, and 4 cases of acute rejection and ATN. Color Doppler sonography, using a 7.5 MHz probe, was performed after bolus administration of 10 ml of echo enhancer (Levovist SHU-508-A, concentration 300 mg/mi). Wash-in wash-out curves were studied for a duration of 150 sees after injection of echo enhancer and post processed and subsequently morphologically and quantitatively analyzed. Results: We have been able to differentiate normally functioning grafts from transplant diseases on the basis of the morphological results, as analysis of the waveform morphology evidence this difference. Also a quantitative differentiation has been evident as the mean pixel values showa statistically significant difference between the groups of patients. Conclusion: The preliminary results show that it is possible to differentiate normally functioning grafts from transplant diseases through a correct analysis of the wash-in wash-out curves. Purpose: Levovist has a stimulated acoustic emission in renal parenchyma called \"burst\"-mode. The purpose of this study was to evaluate this effect for the detection of renallesions with Contrast Harmonie Imaging (CHI). Methods and Materials: Ten patients with suspected renallesions received the ultrasound contrast agent Levovist (Schering, Germany) as a bolus injection in the concentration of 300 mg/mI. Five minutes after injection the kidney was scanned in \"burst\"-mode and examined with CHI. The ultrasound device used was a Siemens Sonoline Elegra. All examinations were recorded on videotape. The findings were compared with conventional gray scale ultrasound. Results: CHI demonstrated impressive hypoechogenie renallesions as defects in the parenchymal enhancement of the kidney. Compared with conventional ultrasound CHI and \"burst\"-mode were superior in detection of small and isoechogenie renallesions. However, hyperechogenie lesions are not visible with this method. Conclusion: CHI and \"burst\"-mode are new methods in the detection of hypo-and isoechogenie renallesions. The accuracy of this method has to be evaluated with more patients and compared with new parenchymal contrast agents.",

Twenty-two patients with diabet es meIlitus have been examined using this protocol. Sixteen patients had type 1 diabetes and 6 had type 2 diabetes. Fifteen patients had creatinine values <1.5 mg/dl, 4 had mild renal insufficiency (creatinine values <3.0 mg/dl) and 3 had severe renal insufficiency (creatinine values >5.0 mg/df). The duration of the disease ranged between 5 and 15 years. Both qua litative (ar morphologieal) and quantitative parameters have been evaluated .

The data have been correlated with creat inine, clearance creatinine and album inur ia. Results: Morphological chang es were seen only in patients with severe renal failure. In the other patients onfy functionaf changes were noted, mainly in cases with micro or macroangiopathy and cons isted in increased peak and time to peak in the cortex, the medulla and the excretory system. The lack of inversion of the signal intensity in the medulla and excretory system seems to be the most early sign. A correlation with creatinine and c1earance has been shown .

            "text": "Purpose: Optimization of an injection protocol for intravenous contrast media application in thoracic and abdominal spiral CT using a NaCI-Bolus to save contrast media without loss of contrast enhancement. Methods and Materials: In a group of 600 patients, our standard contrast media application protocols were compared with alternative protocols, in which the last 10 ml of contrast media were replaced by a NaCI-bolus of 30 ml. To evaluate contrast enhancement HU were measured in the regions of interest: pulmonary artery and Aorta thoracica at the level of tracheal bifurcation in thoracic CT, portal vein and inferior vena cava at the end of the first/start of the second spiral scan in abdominal CT, respectively. Results were checked using tests of Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Levene's test and Students t-test. Results: Contrast media was injected in each case via a 17G intravenous cannula, placed in a cubital vein. In thoracic spiral CT replacement of the last 10 ml of contrast media by a NaCI-bolus of 30 ml leads to a significant higher enhancement (p < 0.05). This is due to utilization of contrast media that would otherwise stay in the brachial veins but is washed out by the NaCI-bolus. Additionally, image quality is improved by reducing artifacts in the upper thoracic aperture: the subclavian vein is nearly washed from contrast media, reducing hardening artifacts to a minimum (scan direction: caudo-cranial). Cost savings are belween DM 5,00.-and DM 11,00.-depending on the price for contrast media. In abdominal spiral CT, replacement of the last 10 ml of contrast media by a NaCI-bolus of 30 ml leads to a slightly minor contrast enhancement (p < 0.05) and is therefore not recommended. Conclusion: Using a NaCI-bolus, in thoracic spiral CT 10 ml of contrast media can be saved with no loss of enhancement and improved image quality (upper thoracic aperture). Cost savings are about DM 8,00.-per investigation. In abdominal CT, using of a NaCI-bolus leads to a rrunor enhancement and is not recommended. 148 \u00b1 25 9 with GR sequences, 155 \u00b1 20 9 with FGR and 162 \u00b1 29 with EPI GR sequences. Mean ejection fraction was 50% \u00b1 9 for GR sequences, 48% \u00b1 7 for FGR and 46% \u00b1 8 for EPI GR. The analysis of variance showed an high concordance between the three techniques. Purpose: We examined myocardial motion in healthy volunteers and patients suffering from localized disturbances of myocardial motion using a new black blood prepared gradient-echo sequence. Methods and Materials: All examinations were carried out on a 1.5 T scanner (Magnetom Vision, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). We used a black blood prepared segmented gradient-echo sequence (TE = 6.8 ms, TR = 11.25 ms, 250 mm FOV) with first order motion compensation along all three dimensions. Examinations included ECGtriggered breathhold acquisitions with a reference scan and three motion-sensitive measurements (in X-, y-and z-direction) for each slice. We examined 12 healthy volunteers and 20 patients with localized disturbances of myocardial motion due to non-acute myocardial infarction. Disturbances of myocardial motion were demonstrated using echocardiography. All patients showed corresponding perfusion defects in 99mTc-MIBI-SPECT at rest. Results: In healthy volunteers we found a high interindividual consistency of both radial and rotational veloeitles. We could also demonstrated a counterrotation of the basal versus the apical slices. In 14 of 16 patients we found localized areas of disturbed motion that corresponded weil with the perfusion defects demonstrated by 99mTc-MIBI-SPECT. Four of twenty patients could not be evaluated due to variations of the heart position between subsequent breathhold periods. Conclusion: Measurements of myocardial motion using a segmented gradient echo sequence provide reliable velocity data both in healthy volunteers and patients with localized disturbances of myocardial motion. Purpose: To evaluate correlation in detecting left ventricular ejection fraction with MR-imaging and angiocardiography in patients with different cardiac diseases. Methods and Materials: 27 patients (mean age: 57 years) underwent cardiac MR-imaging at 1.0T (Gyroscan T 10NT, Philips). Three experienced radiologists detected the 'volume-ejection-fraction' (VEF, 3dimensional) and 'area-Iength-ejection-fraction' (ALEF, 2-dimensional) independently without acquaintance of angiographic measurementresults. For calculation the 'cardiac-application-software' (Philips) was used. MR-sequences: short axis: FFE-EPI, breath-hold-technique, ECG-gating, TR: 857 ms, TE 11 ms, slices: 8-10, slice-thickness: 8 mm; long axis/4-chamber-view: TFE, breath-hold-technique, ECGgating, TR: 9.6 ms, TE: 4.5 ms, 3 slices, slice-thickness: 8 mm. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS-software (Anova). Results: Mean deviaton from ALEF detected by MR and angiographically estimated ejection-fraction (Simpson's formula) was 6.6% (sd: 14.8%; r = 0.80). Mean deviation in MR-measurements of VEF and ALEF was 1.9% (sd: 8.65; r = 0.89). MR-quantification of VEF and ALEF did not reveal statistically significant differences concerning inter-and intraobserver-reliability. The average MR-study lasted about 30 minutes. Conclusion: MR-assessment of VEF and ALEF at 1.0Tesla can be performed reliably using the 'cardiac-application'-software. Correlation of quantification of ejection-fractions acquired by invasive angiocardiography and MRI is acceptable. High inter-and intraobserver-reliability in MR-measurements demonstrate the method to be investigatorindependent. ms/1.25 x 0.8 mm2) at rest and during hyperemia (dipyridamole 0.56 mg/kg).

For flow measurements a breathhold, veloeity-encoded, phase-difference magnetic resonance (MR) sequence was used ('through plane', FLASH 2D-sequence, TR/TE 110/5 ms, 'velocity encoding' 250 cm/s). Mean flow (mIlR-R interval) in the ascending aorta, the pulmonary trunk and the right and left pulmonary artery was determined. The ratio of the mean flow in the pulmonary eirculation (Op: sum of the mean flows in the right and left pulmonary arteries) and the systemic circulation (Os: mean flow in the proximal aorta) was compared with the Op/Os ratios determined by the invasive oximetric technique. Oximetry was performed within 24 hours after MR imaging.",

Purpose: The sophisticated analysis of epi-and subdural fine structures in degenerative and posttraumatic disorders of the spine requires high resolutuion transversal plane MRI. In order to improve fine structure depictability three recently designed T2w sequences were compared in transversal plane MRI of the spine. Methods and Materials: Turbo Spin-Echo (TSE), CISS and MEDIC transversal plane images (Magnetom Vision, 1.5 T) of 20 patients suffering from different spinal disorders were compared independently by two experienced neuroradiologists. Results: While CISS images showed the highest contrast for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) versus spinal cord and nervous roots the image contrast between CSF and bony or disk structures was rather poor. By severe folding artifacts CISS was Iimited to cervical spine imaging. In MEDIC images the contrast between CSF and cord and subdural fine structures was slightly less compared with CISS but the depictability of disk and vertebral disorders was improved. The quality of TSE images was impaired by sensitivity to vascular and other motion artifacts. Conclusion: Because of optimal contrast resolution and the absence of folding artifacts MEDIC was the only sequence suitable for transversal plane imaging of all parts of the spine.",

Each subject had bolus and infusion studies performed on separate days. Baseline measurements of SMA flow were performed. Either 1 mg of glucagon as a bolus or as an infusion of 40 mcg/minute was administered. SMA flow parameters were recorded over 20-30 minutes. Results: The time averaged mean velocity (TAMV) was significantly higher after bolus glucagon injection compared to the infusion technique (median TAMV were 22.6 cm/s {ranges 15.0-49.1} compared to 15.6 cm/s {range 5.1-19.5}; P < 0.005). Median TAMV increment for bolus was 11.5 cm/s (range 3.0 to 23.7) compared to 5.0 cm/s (range -2.6 to 13.0) (P < 0.05). Time taken to reach peak flow was significantly shorter for bolus (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The effect of bolus injection of glucagon on SMA flow is signifcantly greater compared to the infusion technique and would therefore provide a more effective stress stimulus in clinical practice. Purpose: To compare the safety and efficacy of an oral ultrasound contrast agent (SonoRx\u00ae), Bracco SPA) with that of water for delineating abdominal anatomy and pathology Methods and Materials: Fifty-three adult patients were enrolled in a single-blind, randomized, multicenter, crossover trial. Patients were given a baseline sonogram, which was repeated following ingestion of 400 mL of either SonoRx\u00ae or water. Within 4 days patients were studied using the opposite agent. Investigators and off-site readers were blinded to the agent administered. Results: Both SonoRx and water provided additional information over the baseline ultrasound exam. SonoRx provided additional information over water in 65% of studies evaluated for efficacy and water provided additional information over SonoRx\u00ae in 25%. In 8 cases (17%) SonoRx\u00ae idenlified a diagnosis not made with water; and in 2 cases (4%) SonoRx helped rule out an incorrect diagnosis made from the water study. A total of 13/51 patients experienced adverse events after SonoRx\u00ae administration and 6/53 patients experienced adverse events after water (25% vs.. 11%, P > 0.05).

In a subgroup of patients, the diagnosis was compared with that made following further investigations performed within two weeks of the study examination, including aortoportography, computed tomography and laparotomy findings. . Results: DC was improved in 94% of patients. DC was 90% or more In 58% of patients following enhancement compared with a DC of greater than 60% in only 9% of patients with unenhanced CDUS. The mean DC was 45% (+/-19%) before and 83% (+/-17%) after Levovist (p < 0.001). The echo-enhanced CDUS findings were concordant with other imaging in 80% of patients. Conclusion: Visualisation of the PV system in patients with inadequate CDUS examination due to beam attenuation and poor beam vessel angles is significantly improved by administration of Levovist\u2122.",

Results: Multivariate analysis showed signifieanee in the following c1inieal and bioehemieal data: sonograph ie findings were eorrelated with the presenee of esophageal variees seen at endoseopy on the same day. Results: Endoseopy showed esophageal variees in 45/85 patients (52.9%). D-US permilled to visualize LGV in 32/45 (71.1%) and showed hepatofugal flow in 22/32 (68.8%). None of the eontrol subjeets showed hepatofugal flow in the LGV at D-US. Conelusion: hepatofugal blood flow in LGV in Iiver eirrhosis is often assoeiated with the presenee of esophageal variees and is therefore a useful sonographie indieator of portal hypertens ion. With these variables we built a prognost ie index between 0 and 21.5 points. When the score was greater than 6 there was a statistieally signifieant probability (p < 0.001) of having eirrhosis, with sensitivity of 62%, specifieity of 94%, PPV of 68% and NPV of 92%.

Methods and Materials: 14 liver lesions , treated radiologically with percutaneous Radiofrequency Thermal ablation (RADIONICS, Burlington, MA) and embolization andlor ethanol injection have been studied before and after treatment with MR (Magneton Vision Plus, Siemens, Erlangen-Philips NT, The Neterlands) and Spiral CT (Tomoscan SVA, Philips -The Netherlands). Controls have been performed at 1-3-6 months. At imaging modalities lesion size after Thermal Ablation, regular ity of the periferal rim, signal intens ity on T2w images (TSE and HASTE ) dens ity and signal intensity before and after iv contrast injection were evaluated . Results: Follow-up ranged between 1-7 months, mean 5.3 months: 9 lesions where stable, 2 lesions decrease in size, recurrence occurred in 3 cases , appearing as irregularity of the per iferal rim, and hyper intens ity on T2w images. T1w images suffered of hyper intense signal of the lesions after treatment that often prevent to detect early enhancement areas after contrast. Conclusion: MR and Spiral CT seem to be reliable imaging modalilies in assessing recurrence in radiologically treated lesions; especially with hypervascular lesions we believe that Spiral -CT allows to a a more confident diagnosis. Results: Surgery diagnosed 9 IMH (7 without and 2 with intimal tears): CT abnormality were located on the same aortic wall usually involved by false-Iumen of dissections. Three cases demonstrated stopped aortic ruptures: CT lesions appeared in ascending aorta on the opposite site than usual false-Iumen. In one aortitis the thickening involved 360 0 of the aortic wall and was characterized by a slight contrast enhancement. Other surgical diagnoses were: two false aneurysms, one IMH due to penetrating ulcers. Conclusion: CT evidence of hyperdense thickening of thoracic aortic wall must be related to acute lesions caused by IMH with or without intimal tear, rupture, ulceration or aortitis. Criteria of site, extension and contrast enhancement make easier the differential diagnosis.",

Results: 76 aneurysms ofthe AA and 47 ofthe iliac arteries (lA) were depicted. 39 aneurysms of the AA (and the coexisting aneurysms of I.A) were surgically managed. CTA provided accurate depiction of the morphology and dimensions of the aneurysms and clearly showed their anatomic relations with the origin of main arterial trunks, the presence of thrombus and plaques, the perianeurysmal space and, also other unsuspected aneurysms of IA These information permitted accurate surgical planning and were confirmed intraoperatively. Conclusion: CTA is a highly accurate and minimally invasive examination, which in most cases can provide all the necessary information for the surgical tretment planning of AA. and I.A. aneurysms. Results: All follow-up-studies revealed a correct location of the aortic protheses.

Pre-and post-contrast CT enables to differentiate between aneurysm-bleeding and persisting inflammatory tissue, which shows strong contrast enhancement. Aneurysms of the anastomoses, morphologic renal changes and aortoenteric fistulas were depicted by CT as postoperative complications. Conclusion: In evaluating recurrence of the aneurysm and possible complications as weil as the development of inflammatory tissue, postoperatively performed CT proved to be a reliable diagnostic method. 85.1 % of IAA's either demonstrate complete remission or considerable regression of the perianeurysmal inflammatory tissue postoperatively. CT is superior in differentiating persisting inflammatory tissue from possible aneurysm-bleeding.",

Results: Transverse images are inadequate for a correct demonstration of stenotic area, of prestenotic aorta and of associated tortuosities. 3D images optimize the representation of the site and of the length of the stenosis, the site and the dilatation of intercostal arteries. Multiplanar images, obtained with the reference of 3D images, prove correct measure of prestenotic, stenotic and poststenotic lumen, of the distance between subclavian artery and stenosis. Evaluation of the size of stenotic lumen is correct in long stenoses, but can be underestimated in cases of thin and narrow stenoses.

Petersburg/C/S Purpose: To evaluate the oppo rtunities of SCTA in imaging of intracran ial AVM and SCTA application in complex minimally invasive diagnostics . Methods and Materials: 18 patients with intracranial AVM were studied by means of SCTA, DSA and transcran ial doppler, 5 of them in acute subarachnoid hemorrhage con-dition . The results are confirmed at surgery. Results: SCTA has allowed to detect AVM in all cases. It was possible to detect feeding arteries, draining vlens, AVM nidus. The minimal size of detected AVM was 3 mm. The risk of hyperaemic complications due to normal perfusion pressure breakthrough is one of the main factors of AVM operability. Retrospect ively determined critical values of angiographic and flow parameters were the next (accuracy): AVM volume (cm3) >32.6 (70.8%); diameter of feeding arteries (mm) >3.96 (60.7%); BFV in feeding arteries (cm/sec) >118.8 (71.7%); pulsatility <0.535 (70%); reactivity <18.9 (83.3 %). Thus, application of SCTA allows in most cases to make the decision about further medi-cal tactics according to the risk of perioperative comp lications.

Visualization of the proximal stent end in relation to the renal arteries, the stent position, possible endoleaks, stenoses, thrombi and distal stent connection (scale: --,-, +, ++) were evaluated. Results: Homogeneous aortic opacification was achieved in all patients. In the first postoperative controls, 1 stent was occluded (axials ++, MIP ++, VE ++) and could be reopened through lysis and treated by \"stent-in-stent\" technique. In the second control, 5 patients showed contrast material outside the stent at the height of the aortic bifurcation, a CM-reflux starting from the distal connection occured in 1 patient (endoleaks: axials ++, MIP +, VE-). In 4 patients, the nitinol stent was placed proximal to a renal artery without consecutive stenosis (axial r, MIP +, VE ++).

Purpose: To detect patency-rate and graft-morphology of IMA-conduits early postoperatively and 1 year after myocardial revascularisation at an experienced cardiovascular center. Methods and Materials: From 1990 to 1997, 1023 patients underwent 1080 intraarterial digital subtraction angiographies (La.DSA) of the left IMA (L1MA). A 4-F-catheter-system was introduced into the left brachial artery. The first 80 angiograms were performed non-selectively with position of the catheter-tip in the proximal subclavian artery. In all consecutive angiographies the catheter-tip was positioned selectively into the ostium of the L1MA. Additionally 57 patients were reexamined about 1 year later. The images were mainly evaluated regarding graftpatency and morphology of the arterio-coronary anastomosis as weil as the native coronary system. Results: Patency-rate of the IMA-conduit was 96.2% early postoperatively and 98.2% one year after successful bypass-surgery. In contrast to the non-selective procedure, the selective approach resulted in a good evaluability of the arterio-coronary anastomosis (89.7%), the native coronary arte ries (84.4%), size of the revascularized myocardium as weil as the venous sinuses. Conclusion: At an experienced institution an IMA-patency-rate of 96.2% can be expected early postoperatively. Within the first year the occlusion-rate is 1.8%. l.a.DSA proved to be reliable in evaluating the IMA-bypass and lts function but should not be performed routinely because of its invasiveness. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to show quality diminishing artifacts in non-invasive coronary angiograms, determine their effect on the image quality, their rate of appearance, and their cause. Methods and Materials: The obtained data are transferred to a graphics-workstation and visualized at several angles using volume rendering software. Image processing techniques (e.g. thresholding, segmentation, and c1assification) are used to emphasize the coronary arteries. Two observers scored eight coronary artery segments in 18 MRI (respiratory gated) and 30 E\u00dfT studies using five quality levels (1-4 for good to non-diagnostic, 5 for outside field of view).",

Purpose: Though magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not seem useful in differential diagnosis of myelofibrosis, we aimed to evaluate if it could have value in prognostic staging and follow-up. Methods and Materials: In patients with myelofibrosis, we compared the results of MRI to bone marrow biopsy and laboratory findings. Thirteen patients with myelofibrosis (11 with primary and 2 with secondary myelofibrosis) were evaluated with MRI. The MRI results were compared to the prognostic staging of Visani et al., bone marrow biopsy results and LOH values. Results: MRI sequences were classified in two main groups according to the bone marrow cellularity, resting fatty marrow, and marrow fibrosis. MRI classification were found to have positive correlation with both prognostic staging and LOH level (p =0.026 and p =0.007, respectively), whereas histopathological staging was lacking in correlation with MRI findings and prognostic staging (p > 0.05).

            "text": "Results: The incidence of TBME of the femoral head (22 patients : 12 male , 10 femare, both femoral heads n = 1) was 2.9 % of MRI hip exams , 0.2% of MRI knee exams (3 pat ients : 1 male , 2 female) and 1.2% of MRI ankle exams (3 patients: 1 male, 2 female). In all pat ients an increased water -bound proton density with dimlnished or lost lipid-bound proton density was present in epi-and/or meta physis of a convex bone without demarcation of subchondral areas. Follow-up examinations showed a normal lipid-bound signal intensity in all bones under concern . Conclusion: When a diffusely increased water-bound proton densily without subchondral demarcations can be identified in MRI in the epi/metaphyseal bone marrow of a convex bone of the lower extremities a reliable diagnosis of TBME can be made when infection, trauma or osteoarthritis are absent. Repeat exams to rule out incipient osteonecrosis are unnecessary. Purpose: \"Gaucher-disease\" is a lipid storage disorder which can effectively be treated since 1991 by enzyme-replacement therapy (ERT). The purpose of this study was to evaluate bone-marrow changes under ERT using MR imaging. Methods and Materials: In a prospective study, 78 MR examinations of the lower extremities were performed in 32 patients (11 men, 21 women, mean age 49 years) with \"Gaucher disease\" using a 1.0 T system (Gyroscan T-10NT, Philips). T1-and T2-weigthed SE and TSE sequences were acquired with a standard body-coil in coronal plane. Images obtained before and under enzyme-therapy were analyzed by two radiologists independently. Mean follow-up: 25 months. The MR results were compared with clinical and laboratory findings. Results: MR demonstrated improvement of bone-marrow changes in 13 patients with an increased signal intensity of bone-marrow in T1-1T2images indicating a higher fraction of yellow bone-marrow. 19 Patients showed no changes. All patients showed dramatical improvement of clinical and laboratory courses. Conelusion: Our first long-term MR-results demonstrate an improvement of bone-marrow changes in 41% of patients. The skeletal response to therapy may depend on the degree of bone involvement. Delayed administration of therapy may result in irreversible bone changes. A longer follow-up is necessary to distinguish between reversible und irreversible bone-marrow changes. Purpose: To evaluate bone marrow changes in patients with \"Gaucher disease\" type I. Methods and Materials: From 1992 to 1998 MR Imagingy was performed in 60 patients (27 male, 33 female, mean age 45 years) with \"Gaucher disease\". T1 and T2 weighted images of the lower extremities were performed in coronal plane using a standard body-coil at a 1.0 T. magnet (GYROSCAN T10-NT, Philips). Bone marrow changes were analyzed using a MR-Score at 8 anatomical sites. The MR images were read in a blinded-fashion by two experienced radiologists. Results: Altered bone marrow was characterized by decreased signal intensity on T1 and T2 weighted images. The proximal (femoral) areas were more frequently involved than distal (tibial) areas. The epiphyses of the knee were affected in 39%. An increase in signal intensity from T1 to T2 weighted images was seen in 8 patients, complaining of acute bone pain. Involvement of bone marrow was almost symmetrical. The degree of bone marrow involvement was more severe in patients who were splenectomized (30%). Conelusion: Accumulation of Gaucher-Iipids in bone marrow is characterized by low signal intensity on T1 and T2 weighted images, involving femoral more than tibial areas. An increase in signal intensity from T1 to T2 indicates an active bone process. MR imaging is a valuable, non-invasive method in determination of bone marrow involvement in Gaucher's-disease. Purpose: Although in homozygous sickle cell disease (SSD) pain of bone marrow infarction is common, soft tissue pathology may be responsible for atypical symptoms. We assessed the frequency and ultrasound (US) appearances of soft tissue and joint abnormalities in SSD. Methods and Materials: Over a two year period, SS disease patients with atypical musculoskeletal symptoms were examined. Findings were divided into normal, abscess, soft tissue induration (STI), fat necrosis, haematoma, Iymphnode and joint effusion. US findings were correlated with surgery or percutaneous drainage. Results: 31 episodes in 23 patients referred for US, found 36 abnormalities in 18 patients: abscess (n =15), effusions (n =5), soft tissue induration (n =12), fat necrosis (n =2), haematoma (n =1), Iymphnode (n = 1). Abnormalities were associated with intramuscular injection in 10 episodes; fat necrosis (n =1), haematoma (n =1), STI (n =1), abscess (n = 7). Abnormalities with no underlying cause were seen in 7 patients: abscess (n =4), STI (n =2), fat necrosis (n =1).",

Purpose: To investigate for bone lesions in sport divers with MRI. To compare findings with a control group of non-divers. Methods and Materials: MRI scans of the shoulder, hip and knee joints of 18 amateur divers were compared with a control group of 15 healthy non-divers. Images were obtained with a low-field MR-scanner (Outlook, Picker). Results: A total of 28 lesions were found mostlyon the lateral aspect of the humeral head in 12 of 18 sport divers and in none of the control group (p < 0.001). Size ranged from 0.7 to 3 cm (mean 1.5 cm). Most lesions were hypointense on T1-weighted and hyperintense on T2weighted spin echo sequences, some with a hypointense rim. Only two lesions were accompanied with cutaneous symptoms of decompression sickness. Conelusion: These preliminary results suggest that amateur scuba divers are prone to bone lesions in the humeral head. The nature of the lesions is not clear yet. Further studies are necessary to investigate for risk factors and to find out if the bone lesions are precursors of osteonecrosis. ",

Methods and Materials: A cross-sectional descriptive study was performed in two SR of primary care that deal to 591.816 inhabitants. A randomised representative sam pie (1.676 requests) from the 109.460 requests received in one year in both SR was selected (726 requests from one SR and 950 requests from the other) and all the urgent requests were studied. Results: In one SR 18.7% of the requests were demanded as urgent (111 requests) but only 28.8% were justified. In the other SR 5.1% of the requests were urgent (59) and 87.1 % were justified. Most frequent reason for emergency was contusion, followed by nephritic colic and pain. The level of agreement between reason request and radiological report was <50%. Conelusion: The urgent requests are justified in one SR > 87%. Differences in the incidence of urgent requests between the two SR can be due: to the introduction of clinical-radiological sessions more late in one centre and to the different number of working hours, formation and way of work of the petitioner physicians. Purpose: to evaluate the need and risks of a second pass in percutaneous ehest semiautomatic trucut core biopsy (STCB) performed without presence of a pathologist. Methods and Materials: 86 consecutive STCB with a minimum of two passes provided 180 biopsy specimen in 85 patients. The specimen were evaluated separately and scored relatively to their macroscopic size and their content. The sensitivity and negative predictive values (NPV) were scored for each pass and correlated with the specimen size. The pneumothorax rate was scored after each pass. Results: The second pass allowed to enhance the sensitivity from 88 to 94% and the NPV from 67 to 81%. There was no correlation between the size of the sampie and its content. The overall rate of pneumothoraces was 10.5%, a chest tube aspiration being needed in 3 cases (3.5%). The second pass did not affect the ehest tube rate. Conclusion: The STCB can be performed without presence of a pathologist. The second pass allows to enhance the sensitivity of the procedure from 88% to 94.2% and the NPV from 67 to 81%. The second pass does not enhance the chest tube rate. Morphologic criteria of the specimen are not usefull. Purpose: To evaluate the clinical utility and the diagnostic efficacy of the CT-guided transthoracic core-biopsy by automated system. Methods and Materials: Since April 1997 to September 1998 we performed 23 CT-guided transthoracic core-biopsies by automated system in 23 patients with single or multiple pulmonary lesions by mean a single sampie. All biopsies were performed by 18 G cutting needle. A standard ehest radiogram was performed 4 h after the procedure in order to evaluate complications. The final diagnosis was determinated by surgery or clinical follow-up. Results: In 23/23 cases, the histologic material was sufficient for a histopathologic diagnosis. Specific histologic diagnosis was possible in all lesions: there were 16 malignant lesions and 7 benign lesions. The diagnoses of malignant lesions included squamous cell carcinoma (n = 4), adenocarcinoma (n = 3), small-cell carcinoma (n = 1), bronchiolalveolar carcinoma (n = 1), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 1), metastatic disease (n = 6), while the diagnoses of the benign lesions included BOOP (n =1), Iympho-plasmacellular inflammations (n = 1), lymphoid hyperplasia (N = 1), other benign diagnoses (n= 4). Conclusion: 1. Transthoracic core-biopsy by automated system is an extremely accurated method (accuracy 100%) for diagnosis of nodular thoracic lesions, although we performed only a drowing. 2. Particularly useful in the diagnosis of benign lesions. 3. Allows the diagnosis of histotype of the malignant cells. 4. Is not necessary the presence of the pathologist in CT-room. 5. Allows reduction of the costs. 6. The complication rates are similar to thoracic FNAB.",

Mecozzi; Tur/n/I Purpose: Assessment was made of the diagnostic sensitivity of CTguided biopsies of small pulmonary lesions. Methods and Materials: Forty-five patients with pulmonary nodules of less than 1.5 cm. in diameter (mean 0.8 cm) underwent CT-guided needie aspiration. The manoeuvre, which was carried out in the presence of a cytopathologist, using a 20-gauge lumbar-puncture needles was completed in the same session with cutting-needle biopsy in the cases of inadequate aspirated tissue sampies. All the patients were checked immediately afterwards with CT and with an x-ray examination after 2 hours. Results: The tissue sampies taken enabled diagnosis of benignant or malignant lesions in 44 cases (97.8%), with 62% of malignant cases. The number of passes with the needle was from 1 to 3 (mean 1.9), and the biopsies carried out using a cutting needle were 4 (8.8o/~). The.major complications were 2 cases of pneumothoraw, treated with drainaqe. The minor complications were 3 cases of pneumothorax and 5 cases of haemoptysis, which did not require any therapeutic intervention. Conclusion: The possibility of cutting-needle biopsy and the presence of a cytopathologist practically reduce the percentage of inadequate tissue sampies to zero. The low incidence of serious complications and the high diagnostic sensitivity demonstrate the~alidity of the \":lano~uvre even in the case of small pulmonary lesions, which are otherwlse difficult to assess purelyon the basis of imaging.",

Methods and Materials: The on-site and final cytologic diagnoses, number of passes and slides were reviewed in 54 consecutive pulmonary aspirates procured by one radiologist and cytologist. Material limited to the hub of the needle was smeared. Bloody specimens aspirated into the syringe were expressed onto a watch glass. Tissue fragments collected on the rim of the watch glass were smeared. A cell block was made from the clot. Results: There were 54 masses, averaging 1.2 cm in slze, One sampling was required to diagnose 23 primary lung carcinomas (19 nons mall cell, 3 small cell, 1 adenoid cystic), 13 metastatic lesions and 11 benign masses (1 hamartoma, 2 Iymph nodes, 4 granulomas, 4 fungal infections). In 5 cases of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, three paasses were made. The average number of passes required for diagnosis was 1.6. The average number of slides was 7. The on-site and final diagnoses were conclusive and concurrent in 50 cases. The accuracy of the diagnoses was 93%. Conclusion: Accurate on-site diagnoses of pulmonary aspirates can be made when tissue fragments are concentrated and cell blocks are utilized for special studies.

When superior mediastinal nodes were negative this was followed by thoracotomy and pathological examination of the resected specimen and Iymph nodes to determine pTNM. Results: The agreement between (i) TNM and pTNM was only 35.1%. The primary tumor (T) was correctly staged in 54.1%, overstaged in 27.0% and understaged in 18.9% of the patients.

The nodal (N) factor was correctly determined by CT scan in 35.1%, overstaged in 44.6% and understaged in 20.3% of the patients. Conclusion: Even with present-day CT scanners (i) TNM provides no accurate staging and routine mediastinoscopy is necessary for precise mediastinal Iymph node staging.

Methods and Materials: Between April '96 and July '98 we investigated 68 patients with central lung masses to CT (Somatom Plus) angiography. Vascular involvement was revealed in 37 persons whose diagnosis was confirmed histologically after surgical intervention. We acquired CT data (5 mm collimation; 3-5 mm/sec table feet) in monophasic way with administration 100-150 ml of contrast media (delay 8\"-20\") to evaluate arterial and venous structure of mediastinum simultaneously.

Axial images and MPR were assessed for evidence of tumor involvement of bronchi, pulmonary arteries and veins, and compared to surgery. Results: Eleven patients underwent pneumonectomy because of invasion of proximal bronchi (n =4), main pulmonary arteries (n =4), pulmonary veins (n = 2), both main stem bronchus and pulmonary artery (n = 1). Seven patients underwent lobectomy. SCT correctly predicted the need to perform pneumonectomy in 7 patients and lobectomy in 6.

MPRs improved depiction of proximal bronchi and pulmonary arterial invasion in 1 (7.7%) and 2 (15.4%) patients. Conclusion: Spiral CT is accurate in depicting neoplastic invasion of proximal bronchi. However, it is poor sensitive in assessing vascular involvement and this represents a major limitation in predicting the need for pneumonectomy in patients with CLN. Purpose: Prior work has demonstrated the effieacy of MR in renal artery stenosis evaluation. The increasing role of RAS in the differential diagnostic evaluation of hypertension raises the question of whether MRI should be used as a screening modality over scintigraphy.

This project evaluated the benefits of MRI over scintigraphy by determining extrarenal causes of hypertension. Purpose: To evaluate time/intensity curves of Doppler signals within the kidney after i.v, bolus injection of US contrast medium in an animal model, before and after inducing renal artery stenosis. Methods and Materials: One minute time/intensity curves of Doppler signals after bolus injection of US contrast medium (Levovist\u00ae, Schering AG, Berlin, Germany) were obtained within the renal parenchyma in 5 anesthetized rabbits using a built-in prototype software of a US equipment working on raw Doppler data (AU5, Esaote, Genova, Italy).

The most specific indicators of adrenal mass character proved to be the CSI ratio reflect ing lipid content in the lesion and WO MAXfLAST ratio reflecting contrast agent was haut from the lesion. Excluding myelolipomas, the CSI ratio above threshold value of 15% was 100% specific for adenomas with 70% sens itivity and with 83% sensitivity for non-hyperfunctioning adenomas. The WOMAXILAST ratio above threshold value of 29% was 98% specific for adenomas with 80% sensitivity and with 86% sensitivity for nonhyperfunetioning adenomas. Bifactor ial analysis of adrenal masses with CSI ratio and WO MAX.IlAST ratio was 98% specific for adenomas with 90% sensitivity and even 92% sens itivity for non-hyperfunetioning adenomas. Conclusion: MRI makes possible specific characterisation of adrenal masses . The optimal MRI protocol for adrenal region will be presented.",

Methods and Materials: Thirty-five patients with adrenal masses were subm itted to turbo gradient-echo chem ical-shift imaging in a 1.5T MR. Histology of the lesions were both bening and malignant, from different orig ins. Results: The application of turbo gradient-echo opposed phase imaging shows a good spatial resolution, less chemical-shift artifact, less motion artifact and a considerable save of time in the exploration compared to conventional gradient-echo opposed phase secuences. In our serie this technique shows an accuracy similar to other series in the study of adrenal masses with opposed phase imaging, being useful overall in the distintion between adenomataus and non-adenomatous masses . Ta our knowglodge there is no previous application of this sequence to opposed-phase imaging. Conclusion: Turbo gradient-echo is an easily available sequence perfectly applicable to opposed phase imaging of adrenal masses with inherent adventadges and no lass in accuracy. Each patient was randomly assigned to one of four groups who recieved 100 ml of non-ionic contrast agent (300 mgI/mi) at an injection flow of either 4, 3, 2, or 1.5 ml/s (scan delay: 30 s). The enhancement of the carotid artery, jugular vein and sternocleidomastoid muscie were measured over time and the density of the sumbandibular and thyroid gland were evaluated. Data were compared between patients of different patient groups and between patients weighting more or less than 75 kg. Results: Vascular attenuation of at least 150 Hounsfield Units was defined as sufficient. Upon these criteria, those studies using 1.5 or 2 ml/s injection flow showed good vascular enhancement during the examination time. Injection speed did not significantly influence muscular enhancement. The attenuation of the submandibular and thyroid gland showed only minor differences between the patient groups. In patients over 75 kg the overall enhancement was lower than in patients with less than 75 kg, nevertheless the 1.5 and 2 ml/s flow was regarded as optimal for each subgroup. Conclusion: Using 100 ml of contrast agent for spiral CT studies of the entire neck, the injection flow should not exceed 2 ml/s. In case of persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism after ethanol sclerotherapy, the patient was examined also by 99mTc-MIBI scintigraphy, CT scan and/or MRI, Esophageal Echoendscopie Sonography in order to detect possible ectopic glands. After a mean 54 mo. follow up, 26 patients were disease-free, while recurrent or persistent hyperparathyroidism occurred in 10 cases: 7 of them were submitted to surgical exploration and in 3 patients all glands were removed because hyperplastic; in 2 cases multiple parathyroid adenomas were found (2 of them in the mediastinum); in other 2 patients the hyperparathyroidism was related to the reactivation of the parathyroid(s) treated by sclerotherapy. In 3 cases of recurrence the biochemical parameters of hyperparathyroidism were only slightly altered, and thus the patients did not received further therapy. Temporary dysphonia occurred in 5 patients, but only in 2 of them lasted more than 2 weeks; a complete recovery of voice was recorded in all cases within 6 mo. Our data suggest that US-guided sclerotherapy represents a simple, easy, well-accepted and cost-saving method to eure parathyroid tumors; moreover, this kind of treatment does not compromise further traditional surgery. Results: Since 1995 superselective chemoembolisation and/or percutaneous alcoholization was performed in 31 patients with more than one metastatic lesion in the Iiver. In 15 patients only chemoembolization and in 10 patients only alcoholization was performed. In 6 cases we combined both procedures. In 19 cases the procedure was repeated.",

Conclusion: Radiofrequency Thermal Ablation seems to be a safe and effective procedure in the treatment of primary and secondary Iiver lesions. It does not prevent from further local treatment. Lesion >3 cm require multiple exposions to obtain a complete necrosis. Purpose: To test the hypotheses that 1) MR image-guided radiofrequency (RF) thermal ablation in the pancreas is safe and feasible, and that 2) induced thermal lesion size can be predicted using MR monitoring . Methods and Materials: MR-guided RF ablation was performed in the pancreas of six pigs. A 17G-monopolar RF probe was inserted into the pancreas using MR image-guidance, and RF was applied 550 for 10 minutes. After post-procedure imaging (T2-weighted, STIR , T1weighted before and after gadod iamide adm inistrat ion) , the pigs were observed for 7 days and , follow-up MR images were acquired . The pigs were sacrificed, and pathologie exam ination was performed. Results: Successful RF probe placement was accomplished in all cases; the interventional procedure time ranged trom 46-80 min. The thermal lesion size varied from 12-15 mm perpendicular to the probe track and was best seen on STIR and enhanced T1-weighted images with a radio logical/pathological correlation coefficient of 0.81. Diarrhea was the only side effect during the one-week follow-up period , and no clinical signs of pancreatitis occu rred . Conelusion: MR imaging-guided RF thermal ablation in the pancreas is feasible and safe. Induced thermal lesion size can best be mon itored using STIR and enhanced T1-we ighted images.

Conelusion: The present des ign of \"cooled-wet\" electrode for RF tissue ablation may allow to obtain a suffic ient lesion size with a single needle in one session. Purpose: The feasibility of preoperative devascularization of meningiomas depends on the localization of the tumor and on the pattern of vascularization. We evaluated the potential risk that the ophthalmie artery may represent during the embolization procedure. Methods and Materials: From January 1990 until August 1998, 93 patients with CT or MRI diagnosis of meningioma have been investigated angiographically. The average tumor size was 4.5 cm (range 1-12 cm). In all patients we performed a selective catheterization using a Vertebral or Simmons shaped diagnostic catheter and a microcatheter, followed by preoperative embolization with PVA particles in 53 patients. No embolization was attempted in 24 patients because of internal carotid artery vascularization (n = 11), technical failure (n = 7), feeders not cleary identified (n = 5) and allergie reaction prior to embolization (n =1). In 16 patients no preoperative embolization was required by the referring clinicians. Results: Complete tumor devascularization was achieved in 20 patients, subtotal devascularization (50%-99%) in 22 patients, and partial devascularization (Iess than 50%) in 11 patients. Major complications occurred in 3 patients, 2 related to the ophthalmie artery. One patient left the angio suite with a transient hemiplegia as a consequence of reflux of contour particles through the ophthalmie artery in the internal carotid artery. He recovered completely after aperiod of one week. In another patient an accessory ophthalmie branch originated from the feeding middle meningeal artery. Distal catheterization was difficult resulting in an epidural extravasation. Conelusion: Preoperative meningioma embolization is a safe and effective procedure when performed by skilied radiologists. However, anatomical variants and collateral circulation to the ophthalmie artery have to be recognized prior to embolization in order to avoid potential severe complications. Purpose: To study the effects of a new dodecafluoropentane based ultrasound contrast agent, EchoGen\u00ae emulsion, on enhancing the visualisation of liver tumour vasculature. Methods and Materials: Thirty patients with Iiver tumours were examined with an ATL HDI-3000 ultrasound system set up for use with contrast agent; low PRF, medium general and colour gain. Patients received a single dose (0.05 mLlkg) of EchoGen. In many of these patients, a second harmonie study was performed, followed by three dimensional reconstruction of the vessels. Results: In the majority of patients, the vascularisation improved significantly after contrast injection. The typical patterns were better defined (compressed normal vessels in benign tumours; vessels irregular in diameter, course and canalisation, presence of A V fistulas or blood pools), thus allowing comparison to angiography. Furthermore, we observed many different types of flow within a given tumour, mainly arterial, which characterised the malignant lesions. In addition, perfusion of the tumour, tumour transit time along with wash in, duration, and wash out curves were studied. Conclusion: Although this was a difficult study to perform, curves were obtained which are similar to those using CT and MR with contrast agents. These preliminary results show that contrast agents improve the conspicuity of liver tumour vascularisation, which creates the potential to further characterise lesions. those from surrounding tissue providing a near-angiographic picture with high vessel to tissue contrast. Image quality was excellent with high spatial and temporal resolution and no obvious artefacts. Arteries showed stronger enhancement than veins. There was also marked Bmode enhancement of Iiver and spleen parenchyma, especially during the late phase (* 2.5 min. Purpose: SHU 563A is a micro-bubble agent with a shell which can be broken by the US beam. This process produces a random pseudo Doppler freqency shift leading to a scintilation colour Doppler signal (stimulated acoustic emission) which is solely dependent on microbubble presence but independent of flow. We used this to image the blood pool phase of SHU 563 in various organs. Methods and Materials: 6 injections (10-20 ml/kg) were given in 2 dogs. The liver, spleen, kidney, testis, stomach wall and large vessels were scanned with a Sequoia 512 (Acuson Corp., USA) in color Doppler mode at maximum transducer output for up to 22 min. Results: Marked stimulated emission was observed in all organs. It was most dramatic in organs with a large blood pool (kidney and large vessels) and organs containing RES cells (liver and spleen). Average duration was 15 min (kidney and large vessels), 12 min (stomach wall) and 6.5 min (testis) respectively. The liver and spleen showed marked stimulated emission until the end of all scans caused by RES up-take. Conelusion: Stimulated acoustic emission colour signals obtained from SHU 563 effectively images the blood pool/perfusion even in organs normally displaying few or no Doppler signals. Purpose: The determination of blood volume flow in extracranialintracranial (EC-IC-) bypasses and original brain supplying arteries before and after EC-IC-bypass surgery. Methods and Materials: In 15 patients selected for EC-IC-bypass surgery because of symptomatic ICA occlusion, blood flow velocity and blood volume flow was measured in both common carotid arteries, both ICAs and in the basilar artery (BA). Blood flow was measured with 20 cine phase-contrast MR imaging. After EC-IC-bypass surgery additionally the blood flow in the EC-IC-bypass itself (arterial anastomosis between the superficial temporal artery and the middle cerebral artery) was determined. Results: Mean blood volume flow in the EC-IC-bypasses was 101.0 \u00b1 29.3 ml/min (68.6-177.6 ml/min). In comparison: blood volume flow of healthy volunteers was found with 256.3 \u00b1 23.5 ml/min in the ICA and 174.4 \u00b1 14.7 ml/min in the BA. Changes in total brain blood supply, calculated from summarized pre-and postoperative brain supplying blood volume f1ow, demonstrated an increase of 64.3 \u00b1 43.7 ml/min (1.8-127.2 ",

Blood flow velocities decreased with age in all vessels statistically significant, but more rapid reduction was observed over 40 y. Blood flow velocities were higher in women. There are a small number of conditions that specifically affect the hip in children. Developmental dysplasia of the hip, may be diagnosed by ultrasound but if the initial treatment is unsuccessful, established dislocation or subluxation results in lateralisation of the femoral head and a break in Shenton's line and a shallow acetabular angle on the AP radiographs. Sonography with real time will show the displacement but arthography is required to show the acetabular labrum and the security of reduction. Inversion of the labrum by a capsular constriction, will preclude further conservative therapy and require open reduction. In older children congruity of the femoral head with the acetabulum and the degree of cover of the femoral head are important features. Perthes Disease: Transient synovitis presents clinically as pain and limitation of weight bearing and plain radiographs may demonstrate joint space widening, while sonography demonstrates an effusion in the joint. Some patients may have avascular necrosis of the femoral epiphysis. The radiography may show loss of bone density, subchondral fragmentation, sclerosis and loss of epiphyseal height, depending on the phase of the disease process. The epiphyses may, however, appear normal and TC 99 MDP studies will demonstrate reduced uptake in the femoral head epiphysis. On MR the dead fat cells are replaced y necrotic tissue and oedema, which have a low signal on T1. Some increased signal may be demonstrated on T2 in the later stages particularly at the margin of the necrotic area from granulation tissue as revascularisation occurs. The extent of femoral head involvement is important for prognosis and 'at risk' signs include lateralisation of the head, lateral ossification of the epiphysis, and whole head involvement, while a viable buttress of bone medially and laterallyon Tc 99 studies is a good prognostic sign. Adult hip pathologies are mainly represented by the degenerative disease, so called \"osteoarthros is, or more precisely \"coxarthrosis. The means of imaging are exposed, according to their specific value: X-rays (measurement of the caracteristic angles of the adult hip), arthrography, arthro-CT scanner, CT scanner. MRI is becoming the major means to study the hip, especially when X-ray films are negative. lt is a very useful tool in the detection of avascular bone necrosis, transcient osteoporosis, stress fractures and arthritis. It used also for bone or articular tumors (using gadolinium intra veinous injection). Bone scintigraphy, using intraveinous injection of technetium 99m, is still known for its lack of specificity. Ultrasounds are more limited, Clinical findings differentiate a mechanical syndrome and an inflammatory syndrome.",

Localised narrowing of the joint space is the main point, with osteophyte formation, subchondral sclerosis, cyst formation. The destruction progresses slowly, in 10 to 15 years leading to a complete destruction . Bilaterality is frequent. Because very compromised functional activity, the best treatment is total hip prosthesis. There is a rapid form (1 to 2 years) (Posters D). Secondary coxarthrosis occur after architectural vice, chondral diseases, lack of balance between the size of the head and the acetabulum as in the case of previous fracture or dislocation, avascular bone necrosis of the head of the femur, Paget's disease. Avascular bone necrosis of the head of the femur involves young adults. lt has a multi epiphysis location. MRI is the most sensitive and the most specific means of early diagnosis. The area of bone necrosis appears as weil defined modifications of the upper head of the femur, precisely surrounded by a low signal intensity line on both T1 and T2 weighted imaging. MRI shows articular effusion, bone marrow edema. Scintigraphy gives early findings which are a caracteristic, but non specific, hot spot. CT scanner is used for hip destruction evaluation. Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD) involves mostly aged women. Aigodystrophy/transcient osteoporosis of the hip has a cyelic course, lasting 3 to 9 months. MRI shows an inflammatory pattern in the area of the process (dark in T1 and white in T2, with positive gadolinium response). Scintigraphy also is possitive.

The demands from the users will also include integration with dedicated radiology information systems (RIS) and hospital information system (HIS). Image processing may promote detection and diagnosis of microcalcifications and subtle lesions, also in mammographically dense breasts.

Secondary cardiac tumors, which are 40 times more frequent than primary ones, are evaluated with CT or MRI. MRI has shown involvement of the heart by direct extension of lung and mediastinal malignancies and by extension through the inferior vena cava by adrenal, renal, and hepatic carcinomas. The most frequent mass involving the heart is thrombus (Iow intensity) which can be differentiated usually from a solid tumor (medium intensity) using eine MRI. Malignant primary cardiac tumors are characterized by a wide point of attachment to the cardiac wall; involvement of more than one cardiac chamber or great vessel; necrosis of the mass; extension beyond the heart and or pulmonary matastasis. MR contrast media are used to delineate intramural masses and to distinguish tumor (enhancement) from cavitary thrombus (no enhancement Mammography is a branch of radiology that could benefit greatly from the assimilation of digital imaging technologies.

The talk will be divided in two categories of findings: 1.-Tubular and linear opacities. 2.-Nodular and extrapulmonary opacities. In the first category we describe different conditions such as intrapulmonary systemic veins, pseudo-intrapulmonary systemic arteries, pulmonary venous anomalies, and lineal images produced by accessory fissures or duplication of the diaphragm. The second group is composed of a variety of conditions that can produce nodular images or opaeitles.",

            "text": "According to the technical evolution of endovascular treatments the management of intracranial haemorrhage is more and more a multidisciplinary approach in which the interventional neuroradiologist has an important place. Facing a patient with intracranial haemorrhage, first we must collect all the informations useful for diagnosis: Circumstances of initial bleeding, evolution, e1inical symptoms. A grading must be established according to the \"Glasgow Co~a Scale\". The CT scan must be realized in emergency most often without contrast injection, to see a subarachno\"idal bleeding\u2022.an intra?ranial hematom\u00e3 nd/or an intraventricular haemorrhage. It IS very irnportant to esttmate the ventricular dilatation which can require, in emergency, an external shunting. The angiographie study of both internaI carotid artery and both vertebral arteries is realized by transfemoral approach. The e1assic AP., lateral and oblique projections should be replaced by spin angiography able to show the malformation whi~h has bl~ed and to study its angioarchitecture (neck of aneurysm -nidus, feedinq pedicules and draining veins of an AVM...). The angiowaphic study of cerebral circulation must be exhaustive; haernodynarnic parameters are important. We must appreciate the frequent vasospasm and multiple aneurysms are not rare. A transcranial doppler is mandatory to follow-up the cerebraI blood f1ow. lndeed, blood inside subarachno'idal space can induce vasospasm and hydroeephalia. The risk of vasospasm is high: a preventive treatment with calcium channel blockers is immediately started. A precise follow-up with transcranial Doppler allows to detect the vasospasm as soon as possible; if a neurological deficit appears, an hyperselective intracranial angioplasty must be performed in emergency. According to e1inical evolution, CT scan can be repeated to know if brain ischemia, brain oedema or ventricular dilatation is developing. When there is a ventricular dilatation, a ventricular shunt is mandatory. After these initial examinations, we must deeide what is the best treatment and when this treatment must be done; the best is as soon as possible, very often in emergency. When endovascular approach is indicated, the best solution is to do immediately the endosaccular treatment after the end of the angiography during the same procedure. The indications tor endovascular approach are very variable, according to the different teams. Actually, endovascular approach is i~dicated first whenever it is possible: vertebrobasilar aneurysm and anterior communicanting aneurysm are good indications. The aneurysms of the first bifurcation of the middle cerebral artery remain difficult for angioarchitecture understanding; however, in many cases, endosaccular packing is possible and long term follow-up seems good. Indication for treating in emergency a ruptured brain AVM or a dural fistula, are rare. A very close cooperation between neuro-anaesthesiologists, neurosurgeons and interventional neuroradiologists is necessary to choose the best treatment that is to say the less risky, the most comfortable and the less expansive. With the advent of color encoding of the Doppler signal, ultrasonography has gained a major place in the detection of renal artery stenosis (RAS).",

Complete examination is obtained in 80 to 90% of patients as soon as the sensitivity in depth of the platform used is sufficient. Proximal criteria are the most important with spectral broadening and systolic velocity over 150 cm/s. Distal criteria are accessory because present in severe stenoses only (>75%) and have lower reproducibility. They allow to grade the stenosis when proximal criteria are present and to detect a severe stenosis when proximal criteria cannot be obtained. Among the numerous proposed criteria, the acceleration time is the most convenient, because angle independent, being abnormal when longer than 0.07 s. Performances of Doppler US depends on the criteria used. These results will be presented. The role of captopril sensitization is still unclear to now. Contrast agent injection increases the feasibility but not the sensitivity of the test. spiral CT, virtual endoscopy can visualise the external auditory canal, the ossicular chain, the medial wall of the middle ear, and the osseous labyrinth. The application of virtual endoscopy to high resolution MR data sets allows the visualisation of the membranous labyrinth. This fluid-filled structure presents high signal intensity and provides a virtual cavity for the endoscopic perspective. Virtual endoscopy allows measurements of distance, angle and calibre, and it is useful to detect and quantify the presence of pathologies involving the auditory spaces. Furthermore, virtual endoscopy can be integrated with other bi-dimensional and three-dimensional perspectives, such as multiplanar reconstructions, maximum intensity projections, surface shaded display, volume rendering etc., and therefore represents a multi-imaging tool for the study of the auditory spaces. In the assessment of renovascular disease CT-and MR-Angiography are less invasive, less expensive and easier and quicker to perform than conventional angiography. CTA is based on helical data acquisition with consecutive post-processing and three-dimensional reconstructions. It provides accurate detection of significant renal artery stenoses and additional information on mural calcifications. CTA is limited by a low cranio-caudal coverage, the need for iodinated contrast media, and the lack of ability to quantify blood flow in renal vessels. The phase-contrast (PC) technique is recommended for unenhanced MR angiography of renal arteries. The directional component of the phase images permit easy differentiation of arteries from veins, thus eliminating a potential source of error. Morphologie assessment of the renal arteries with PC-MRA ls, however, still handicapped by the inability to adequately visualize distal renal artery segments and small accessory vessels. While the accepted gold standard, conventional angiography, is highly sensitive in the detection of renovascular disease, it is merely 50-80% specific. CINE-PC based functional blood flow analysis, capable of expressing renal flow, may overcome some of these limitations. A breathheld PC-imaging strategy is essential for accurate blood flow quantification. Contrast-enhanced 3D MR acquisition techniques proved to be highly accurate for visualization of renal vessels. In its initial implementation imaging times ranged from 3 to 5 minutes. The use of fast gradient systems allows to reduce imaging times and to perform breath-hold data acquisition. High resolution images of main and segmental arterial branches can be obtained after injection of higher doses of pararnagnetic contrast media. A virtual angioscopic display of the acquired images provides a new insight into morphologie alterations of renal arteries. ",

In 150 patients we used inner surface 3D reconstruction to visualise sinus nasal cavities and to navigate inside them (in the same way as during optic fibrous endoscopy). The main limit is the arbitrary choice of the density threshold value: this implies that discontinuity or continuity of the rebuilt inner surface not always correspond to reality. Furthermore, the overlapping or the closeness of different or same structures (mucosamucopurulent secretions, mucosa-mucosa, etc.) are visualised only as shape modification of the same homogeneous surface if no significant density differences arise or if the chosen threshold corresponds to the lower density value, The correspondence of virtual endoscopic images and the results of endoscopy is largely proved, particularly as regards to lateral nasal wall and to osteo-meatal unit of maxillary sinus. Certainly, it is not, at the moment, an alternative technique to optic fibre fibroscopy but a complementary procedure that may help confirm an analysis or evaluate anatomically difficult or impossible to reach seats (frontal sinus and frontal recessus, maxillary sinus and sinusal ostium, ethmoidal bulla and sphenoidal sinus), also in case of overlapping of pathological processes (such as meatal stenosis), high risk patients or non-passable stenosis.

Practically a collimation of 3 mm and a pitch of 1.5 are optimal parameters for the combined generation of excellent 3D-inner surface models and high quality axial slices with an acceptable longitudinal coverage of the examination. 3D-virtual endoscopy demonstrates space-occupying endoluminal alterations and changes of the tracheal configuration. In comparison with the invasive endoscopic examination the inner surface rendering has several advantages. It is a non-invasive technique and grants the visualization of the entire upper airway especially the inferior part of the vocal cords, which cannot be viewed from below with fiberoptic laryngoscopy. The combined interpretation of 3D-virtual endoscopy and axial slices permits an evaluation of the endo-and extraluminal structures with only one investigation. But 3D virtual endoscopy is not able to visualize the morphology of the mucous membrane. That is one reason why superficially spreading tumors cannot be detected.

The term virtual endoscopy (VE) encompasses a number of methods reaching from relatively simple helical CT examinations without postprocessing up to virtual excursions through the bowels which require a high computing capacity. In general the method is based on a so-called CT-pneumocolon which involves a helical CT of the entire abdomen and which is performed after insufflation of the large bowel with air and adjuvant administration of spasmolytics. The ultimate purpose is to compress the immense amount of data into a form that can be more easily handled. The bowel can be 2-dimensionally reconstructed or a 3-dimensional volume reconstruction can be generated. Eventually, endoluminal reconstructions can be obtained which simulate endoscopy and, in their technically most sophisticated form, ultimately allow endoscopy to be conducted interactively. The clinical rationale for examining the colon with VE is that this technique might be able to serve as a tool for detection of colonic polyps and masses that are malignant or premalignant. Initial reports of the efficacy of VE are encouraging and suggest that the technique can compete favorably with existing modalities as endoscopy and barium enema. However,radiation exposure marks a disadvantage of CT-based VE, particulcarly when performed as a screening procedure. Further validation will allow VE to become an accurate, minimally invasive, and cost-effective colonimaging method. The results are less satisfying in the evaluation of brain arteriovenous malformations and in the different steps of pre and post therapeutical evaluation.",

The term \"early\" used in this context means within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms. Signs of early ischemic edema are sometimes difficult to detect on CT and MRI. The purpose of this presentation is to familiarize the radiologist with the subtle brain parenchymal changes seen within the first 6 hours in order to improve detection and early patient care. In current c1inical practice, CT is still, because of its availability and low cost, the best imaging modality to differentiate between ischemia and hemorrhage. Abnormal CT findings include: 1. hypodensity of the brain parenchyma which corresponds to cytotoxic edema and includes 4 signs: a) obscuration of the lentiform nucleus; b) loss of the insular ribbon; c) effacement of the cortical sulci or gyri; d) loss of differenciation between gray and white matter. 2. hyperdensity of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). MRI is more sensitive than CT in the detection of the acute cerebral ischemia. If conventional T2W spin-echo images are often normal in the first 6 hours after onset, MR angiography (MRA), diffusion and perfusion weighted sequences are emerging techniques of increasing interest. MRA may replace conventional angiography in cerebral venous thrombosis.",

Silvestrini; RomeIl Clinical trial (NASCET, ECTS) have assessed that carotid endoarterectomy Is protective against stroke in patients with symptomatic severe carotid stenosis. To decrease costs and risks, new diagnostic tools have been developed, such as Duplex Ultrasound (US), Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA), and more recently Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA). Digitally subtracted MRA (DSA-MRA) obtained with high speed acquisitions during gadoloinium injection is also newly avaible. These techniques are changing the role of non-invasive assessment of carotid stenosis. Although it is probably too early to assess adefinite diagnostic algorithm, the use of DSA as presurgical tool for defining carotid stenosis is rapidly decreasing. Non invasive methods have the advantage of allowing a rapid and accurate evaluation of extracranial arteries. This is particularly relevant in patients with vascular risks factors or after transient ischemic attacks or ischemic strokes. The lack of invasiveness is important for serial follow-up studies investigating the development of carotid plaques and their natural history. The possibility to operate patients on the strength of ultrasound findings without angiographic confirmation of carotid stenosis is controversial. At present, there is increasing evidence that when the information about large cerebral artery disease supported by color-coded Doppler is in accordance with that of other non-invasive techniques Iike MR and C'T angiography, invasive angiography can be avoided. In the next future the application of different technique and a combined rather than competitive use of non-invasive methods will support the best avaible diagnosis to assess structural phenomena as weil as hemodynamic aspects. Neoplasms of the brain represen!, next to leukemia, the most common form of malignant diseases in the pediatric population. Supratentorial location of brain tumors is most common during the first year of life and after 10 years of age while infratentorial tumors represent more than 60 % of brain tumors between 2 and 5 years of age. The ratio between male and female is about equal except for certain types of neoplasms. Clinical symptoms associated with pediatric intracranial neoplasms are different are related to tumor loeation and the age of the child. Most posterior fossa tumors give symptoms due to obstructive hydrocephalus while brain stern gliomas declare themselves by cranial nerve signs, often misunderstood and thought to be due to gastro-intestinal disease. In the very young child, increasing skull circumference may be the first and only clinical sign of obstructive hydroeephalus. Endocrine symptoms and visual disturbanee may represent subtle clinieal signs of suprasellar location of tumors. Neuroradiological imaging characteristics of brain tumors are nonspecific and the histological diagnosis is often better predieted eonsidering gross location, age and sex. The tendeney of some brain tumors to seed to the subarachnoid space and spinal canal should influence the imaging strategy when the neoplasm is first detected. Neuroradiology is used to monitor the effect of surgery and other therapeutic efforts. These studies should follow predetermined protocols in order to optimize the use of available imaging facilities. There are certain diseases, specific to the pediatrie population, that can mimic intracranial neoplasms. Knowledge of these \"Iook-a-likes\" is essential to the radiologist in order not to initiate aggressive therapeutic measures in diseases better treated conservatively. 288 Intra-axial brain tumors in adults VV.J. Huk; ErlangenlD diagnostie facilities have induced an abnormal rising of the number of breast examinations and of medical costs, without areal gain in terms of Public Health. The Breast Integrated Diagnosis Units represent a different model compared to the Screening Programs. The centralization inside one structure of the whole diagnostic work up performed by \"dedieated\" radiologists and radiographers with specific training and consistent experience, the Quality Control of the operative standards, the Medical Audit of the proeedures and the results and, finally, the constant linkage with the General Praetitioner and Therapy Departments are the main features of the B.I.D.U. Consistent number of exams per year, adeguate equipment technology and appropriate methodology are assured moreover. The ereation of a B.I.D.U. network at national level appears nowadays the best choice to assure, at reasonable costs, proper detection and diagnosis to either asymptomatic women or symptomatic ones. Many investigators now believe that from a ciinieal point of view it is useful to divide DCIS into poorly-, intermediately-and well-differentiated (cribriform , miero-papillary, elinging and solid) subtypes. This subclassifieation is based on the observation that the poorly differentiated type has a higher malignancy potential showing a higher proliferative rate as determined by thymidine-Iabelling studies, more frequently expresses the Her 2/ neu oncogene, is more Iikely to be associated with areas of microinvasion and has a higher propensity to reeur within five years after breast-saving therapy than other types. In about 70% of the intraductal cancers, mammographie mierocalcification is the sole evidenee of tumor. The mammographie presentation of these mieroealeifications is in the two main types of intraductal cancers often different. The poorly-differentiated type is associated usually with the so called \"casting\"lIinear or coarse-granular mierocalcifications which often develop in the necrotic debris of the tumor. In contrast, the well-differentiated type is usually associated with the fine-granular microcalcifications. They develop in the secrete produced by the tumor cells.",

The term \"acute renal infection\" encompasses a spectrum of pathologie processes involving the renal parenchyma that vary in severity from acute pyelonephritis to a renal abscess which can progress to the periand pararenal spaces. The clinical pattern of allthe pathological variants is quite similar: therefore if it is easy to diagnose a renal infection, it is impossible to recognize the pathological variant and its extension. The imaging modalities may solve this problem. Most risk factors ot acute renal infection can be elicited by a good clinical history and physical examination. Due to the low sensitivity of IVU, renal scintigraphy ( 99Mtc _labelied DMSA) and US should be the first examinations to be performed. Their !imitations are due to the incomplete evaluation of the process, mainly in cases of extrarenal extension. CT is the study of choice to define the pattern of renal involvement and extrarenal extension, intra-or extrafascial and therefore it has a strong impact on the therapeutic plan. Furthermore it is indicated in monitoring the medical treatment particularly of the abscesses. CT is also useful in understanding the pathophysiology of the infection using precontrast and postcontrast, early and delayed scans. The imaging modalities are indicated: The imaging work-up of inflammatory sinus diseases and complications relies on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) . The simple acute sinusitis is not an indication to imaging studies, whereas chronic, persistent, and recurring sinusitis should urge a CT study. Such an investigation is mandatory to precisely evaluate the extent of inflammatory disease ; furthermore it nicely depicts abnormalities (inflammatory, or anatomie variant s) of the drainage pathways of the sinuses, which are the cause of the sinusitis. Finally CT guides the endoscopic surgeon . In complications of sinusitis (usually acute) , CT and MRI are necessary to evaluate the extent of the inflammatory process to the orbit, or intracranial structures; such events represent radiologie emergencies. Mucoceles, and oste itis of the facial bones are other compl ications of sinusitis , more ehrenie. which are weil demonstrated by CT and/or MRI.",

Stridor, apnoe, recurrent pneumonia, chronic atelectasis or overinflation of the lung are the manifestations of airway obstruction. In these cases the diagnostic evaluation has therefore to include also the search for congenital vascular anomalies, in particular the double aortic arch, the right aortic arch with aberrant left subclavian artery and left-sided ductus and the pulmonary artery sling. Another common problem in pediatric radiology is unilateral small or hyperlucent lung. Primary vascular causes of unilateral small lung may be eongenital, such as proximal interruption of pulmonary artery, unilateral pulmonary venous atresia and anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (Scimitar-Syndrom). The goal of this lecture ls to present a systemalic, segmental approach for the evaluation of these congenital aortic arch and pulmonary artery anomalies. All these vascular anomalies may be investigated noninvasively by uhrasound. color doppler and MRI. However ultrasound examination performed in an organized and step-by-step fashion oflen provides a definitive diagnosis. Nevertheless in case of surgical intervention cineangiography may still be neeessary today to provide the precise definition of the vascular anatomy. On the other hand MRimaging is the single most definitive method to delineate both the vascular and tracheobronchial anatomy in children with the sling left pulmonary artery complex. Room K Pulmonary malformations are uncommon but potentially life-threatening fetal anomalies. Their diagnosis relies upon Ultrasound and Doppler analysis. Recent advances in prenatal diagnosis have provided new insights into the pathophysiology and natural history of these anomalies. Purpose: After a brief review of the embryology and normal sonographie appearance of fetal lungs, this course will present pulmonary sequestration, cystic adenomatoid malformation, bronchogenic cyst, bronchial and tracheal atresia, pleural effusion and pulmonary hypoplasia. Sonographie appearance, differential diagnosis, natural history and prognosis will be discussed and iIIustrated. The topic will also include the necessary prenatal and postnatal work-up. The potential role fetal magnetic resonance imaging and the limitations of prenatal diagnosis will be emphasized. With the advent of newer scanners, both CT and MR data sets become so large that printout on film becomes a major cost factor. In addition, the sheer amount of consecutive images requires new display modalities. Dynamic reviewing of souree images (interactive eine display) is an elegant technique to evaluate the continuing spaces and structures of the abdomen and musculoskelatal system. This presentation will interactively demonstrate the practical clinical advantages of this reviewing technique for a variety of diagnostic tasks: detection of focal lesions in the parenchymal organs of the upper abdomen, deseription of the preeise extent and spatial relationship of lesions and surrounding structures, differentiation between Iymph nodes and vessels or bowel loops, evaluation of vascular anatomy and pathology, evaluation of small and large bowel disease, and skeletal pathology. lt has to be noted, however, that dynamic reviewing of images using a monitor display will require a different approach to image analysis. The usual pattern recognition of the eross-sectional images will have to be given up in favor of an organ-oriented approach. There may be the danger that an observer may miss alesion that he is not actively looking for (e.g. adrenal or subcutaneous lesion in rectal cancer screening). Therefore, one has to scrutinize each organ system separately (including subcutaneous fat or skeletal structures). suspected by a variety of clinical symptoms, sometimes only presenting as \"funny looking child\". Therefore experienced pediatricians, orthopedic surgeons and human genetesists are involved in the diagnostic work-up with the radiologist. Plain films are the basic imaging modality. The radiographer should know when and how to perform the necessary X-ray. Investigation of the unborn and the newborn with suspected severe skeletal dysplasia can have an immediate impact on the child's prognosis and therefore may be highly urgent. On the other hand, many radiologic features of skeletal dysplasias develop within years postnatally. Consequently a correct diagnosis is the basis for the genetic counselling of a family. The diagnosis can have severe consequences for the patient and for his family. lt will be shown, that the extent of the diagnostic procedures will be influenced by the patients' age, by the suspected disease and the expression of its patterns.

All patients had high-resolution CT scans (1-1 .5 mm collimation n = 13, 3 mm n = 1), high spatial-frequency reconst ruction algorithm) performed at 10 mm intervals through the chest. In all patients the diagnos is was proven at open lung biopsy. Results: The main findings at CT included bilateral centrilobular (n = 14) and peribranchial (n = 6) nodules. All 14 patients had nodules measuring less than 3 mm in diameter and 6 patients also had nodules measuring between 3 and 12 mm in diameter. Patchy areas of grau ndglass attenuation were present in nine (64%) patients. Histologically, all patients had lymphoid hyperplasia along the bronchioles and eight of these had peribronchiolar Iymphocytic infiltration. Conclusion: We conclude that the cardinal CT feature of follicular bronchiolitis consists of small centrilobular nodules variably associated with peribronchial nodules and patchy areas of ground-glass attenuat ion.

Purpose: In difficult diagnostic cases of partial small bowel obstruction radiopaque markers should simulate food particles localizing the region of obstruction. Methods and Materials: 20 4-mm radiopaque markers were administered orally and plain radiographs of the abdomen were obtained at 2 -hours intervals in terms of quadrant localisation and transit time. This investigation was compared with other diagnostic methods. The findings at laparotomy were the criterion. So far 20 patients were investigated. Results: Confirmation of the c1inical suspicion of partial small bowel obstruction was possible with radiopaque markers. The obstruction was localized by long term focal c1ustering of markers and dilatation of this small bowel segment and corresponded to the findings at laparotomy. Conelusion: Radiopaque non -resorbable markers can imitate solid foods and non-digestible particles and may obstruct a mild but potentially critical narrowing when results of other imaging studies are normal.",

Methods and Materials: Sonograms of the abdomen were performed on 12 patients with adult celiac disease (aged 28-70) before and after treatment with a gluten-free die!. Also investigated were 50 matched control individuals. Patients were examined after an overnight period of fasting with abdominal transducers (2-4 MHz) and high-frequency linear transducers (5-10 MHz). Results: We\u00b7 found several pathological signs in our patients with untreated disease including abnormal fluid-filled small intestine (100%), flaccid and moderately dilated small-bowel loops (2.5-3.5 cm) (75%), slight diffuse thickening of small-bowel wall (3-5 mm) (67%), increased peristaisis of small intestine (75%), enlarged mesenteric Iymph nodes (anteroposterior diameter 5-10 mm) (83%), enlarged calibre of superior mesenteric artery or portal vein (67%), free fluid in the abdomen cavity (50%), increased echogenicity of the Iiver (50%), enteroenteric intussusception (9%), sludge in the gallbladder (9%). None of these signs were present in the control group. We documented disappearance or improvement of sonographie findings after die!. Conelusion: There are several sonographie signs associated with adult celiac disease. Each sign is unspecific but the combination is characteristic and allows the suspicion in a high percentage of cases. Especially in patients with atypical c1inical presentation, ultrasound could help to avoid diagnostic delay. Patient groups with Crohn's disease (n =20) and with normal findings (n =20) served as controls. Radiographie studies were evaluated by two blinded readers in consensus, who were unaware of the exact proportion of celiac cases in the study population. Findings assessed were fold thickness, number of foldslinch, presence of jejunoileal fold pattern reversal, flocculation, dilatation or masses. Results: In patients with celiac disease, increased fold thickness was found in 45% (n = 9), decreased number of jejunal folds (n ::; 3) in 40% (n = 8), with reversal of jejunoilieal fold pattern in 65% (n = 13) and dilatation in 55% (n = 11). Flocculation was present in only 20% (n = 4). No mass was found in our study population. Sensitivity for detection of celiac disease was 80%. Accuracy for differentiation between celiac disease vs. non-celiac cases was 90%. Purpose: In spite of the improved MR-diagnosis of the abdomen , MRI is not used as a rout ine method for the diagnosis of inflam matory small bowel disease. The aim of this study was -after optimazation of the bowe l opacificalion -the cor relation of the findings obtained with enteroclysis and MRI in patients with known Crohns ' disease. Methods and Materials: 60 pat ients beween 17 and 72 years of age were invesligated. First , an enteroclysis was performed in typ ical manner. The applicated methylcellulosis was blended with positive oral MR contrast media (Magnevist oral, Schering). After enteroclysis, MRI of the abdomen was performed using T1-and T2 weighted breathhold sequences (Flash 20 pre-and postcontrast and TSE) in axial and coronal planes. Results: The length of the affected bowel and the stenosis seen with enteroclysis correlated weil with the visible thickening of the small bowel wall and the stenosis seen in MRI. Using MRI, additional find ings could be obtained in 28 patients , such as fistulas, abscesses or a hydronephrosis, or a better assessment of the stenosis was poss ible with MRI , because of the avoidance of overshadowing of the affected bowel loop with MRI. Conclusion: A brilliant MR-tomographic imaging of the small bowe l is poss ible under the cond ition, that the small bowel contrast is opt imal. The main prerequisite is a large fill ing volume of the small bowel to reach a homogeneous contrast and a good distension of the sma ll bowel lumen.",

            "text": "Methods and Materials: GrUS was performed in 250 patients with suspected Crohn 's disease of the small intestine. Doppler flow measurements were performed in 127 patients. The results were compared to enteroclysis, small bowel CT and 99mTc AgAb immunoscintigraphy. Results: 184 patients proved to have SICD with enteroclysis and c1in ical tests. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of GrUS were 87%, 92% and 89% respectively. Enteroclysis was more accurate, CT was more sens itive, but less specific, immunoscintigraphy had less sensitivity. In advanced and active disease abscesses were detected by CT and GrUS more frequently than with enteroclysis. GrUS detected all significant luminal str ictures, compared to enteroclysis. Active and inactive fistulas were bolh reliably demonslrated by GruS . High Doppler flow measured in the SMA correlated with sc intigraphic activity in 82%. Conclusion: The diagnostic results of GrUS are similar to those obtained by CT and immunoscintigraphy, however, in early stages, enteroclysis and immunoscintigraphy are more sensitive. Sonography detects surgical indications and may indicate activity, thus the decision of surgical intervention can be made and the effect of the therapy could be followed without endoscopy or ente roclysis. Purpose: Estimating new preparation for its ability to characterize small intestine in health and pathology. Methods and Materials: A total 980 x-ray films of small intestine of 156 patients were studied. 32 patients did 'n have any clinical symptoms. Of 124 patients with gas troen terolog ie symptoms, 6 had Croh n's disease , 2 -tuberculosis, 1 -Iymphosarcoma, 2 -cancer of i1eocaecal angle. In other palients changes in small intest ine were funclional and associated witg organic pathology of abdominal organs or organs of retroperitoneal space. Results: ENTERO VU gives complete and objective anatomical picture of normal ileum and c1early demonstrates functional changes. Enterography fails to characterize the cond ition of ileum co comprehensevely. In Crohn 's disease it revealed portions of effected small intestine and helped to estimate depth of the invasion . In tuberculosis of terminal portion of ileum it revealed narrowing of affected portions with involvement of caecum. Conclusion: Special benefit of ENTERO VU is possibility to get detailed characteristics of ileum ( part of intestine most difficult to estimate). Noninvasive character, easy use , detailed information and comprehensive anatomical picture of ileum suggest ENTEROVU to have indisuptable advantages over enlerography. Purpose: To evaluate the usefulness of contrast enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (ceMRA) in combination with phase contrast flow quantification in the assessment of stenotic iliac arteries pre and after percutaneous angioplasty. Methods and Materials: 12 patients were examinated. 14 vessels were treated with stent placement (3 occluded and 11 stenotic iliac arteries). Contrast enhanced angiography was performed with a fisp 3D ultrafast gradient echo sequence on a Magnetom Symphony (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Flow quantification with ECG-gated phase-contrast MR measurement was obtained distal to the stenosis. The results were compared with intraarterial digital subtraction angiography. Results: ceMRA was comparable to intraarterial angiography in the preinterventional analysis. Phase contrast flow measurement showed poststenotic flow profile changes with a decrease in the systolic peak but no reduction in mean f1ow. After stent placement there was a normalization in flow profile. Within the wallstent there was a total signal void whereas within Strecker-and Memothermstents the patent lumen of the vessel could be identified. Conclusion: ceMRA in combination with blood flow quantification appears to be promising in the pre-and postinterventional evaluation of stenotic iliac artery disease. Purpose: The purpose of this work was to assess the overall reliability of MR fluoroscopie triggering for contrast-enhanced MRA. Methods and Materials: The f1uoroscopy sequence uses gradient echo acquisition with TRITE of 6.5/2.4 msec. Real-time reconstruction gives rates of 1.6 and 3.5 img/sec for single and multi-coil, respectively. Interactive imaging permits fast selection of a monitoring plane on a patient-specific basis. The latency from trigger to start of the 3D sequence is 20 msec. From September 1997 through August 1998 the technique was applied to 338 patient studies: renal (47%), carotid (21%), abdominal aorta and iliac (17%), thoraeie aorta (8.5%), and other (5.6%). The technique was assessed on the basis of reliability of bolus detection. Results: MR fluoroscopy detected the contrast bolus in 335 of the 338 studies (99.1 %). In all but three of these the 3D sequence was properly triggered. In virtually all of these successfully triggered cases a venoussuppressed MRA result was obtained which readily permitted diagnosis. Conclusion: To maximize spatial resolution, maximize contrast, and minimize venous signal a triggered or timed 3D MRA sequence with a centric view order is known to be optimum in principle. This work shows that fluoroscopie triggering can reliably (332 of 338 cases, or 98.2%) provide this in practice. Purpose: Numerous investigations have shown the kinetics of rather large volumes (>100 cc) of iodinated contrast media for computed tomography. We sought to determine the kinetics of small volumes \u00ab20 ce) of MRI contrast agents. Methods and Materials: Thirty patients (16 male, 14 female; mean age 52 \u00b1 22 years) assigned for an MRI examination received contrast media with apower injector in a standardized fashion. In three subgroups the contrast agent was administered with velocities of 2 cc/s, 3 cc/s and 4 cc/s. During application we monitored the heart rate. Simultaneously we acquired single transverse slabs of the abdomen every 1.25 sees for a total of 2.5 minutes. A ROI was positioned in the aortic lumen for signal measurement. Hemodynamic parameters were measured by echo doppler using Levovistt\". Results: An intial increase of signal occured after a mean time of 20 \u00b1 13 sees. We could not detect any signal decrease, but found a plateau phase for the entire period. The three different injection velocities did not lead to any significant difference in the resulting curves. Conclusion: A correct timing of the bolus arrival in the examined vessel for contrast enhanced MR angiograms is more important than the injection rate. For dynamic studies lt can be concluded that the contrast media concentration in the vessel will be on a high level of steady state for several minutes. Results: The new turbo-MRA-software reduces the overestimation of stenotic degree (in only 3 cases versus 13 cases in conventional MRAreadings) and increases the visualized length of intracranial arteries up to 17% in comparison with conventional TOF-MTCITONE-techniques. The CNR and SNR did not differ significantly between both methods.",

All 5 aneurysm, 1 AVM and all anatomical variations were correctly detected by both MRA-techniques in comparison with DSA-readings. Conclusion: Turbo-MRA only takes 55% of the acquisition time and increases the diagnostic efficiacy compared to conventional TOFtechniques. The method represents an improved alternative to DSA. Purpose: To evaluate the ability of high resolution intravascular MR imaging using a 5F catheter coil to study the development of atherosclerotic lesions in heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits. Methods and Materials: 16 hyperlipidemic rabbits were investigated at different ages of 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. The aorta was studied with DSA and high resolution MR using a surface as weil as an intravascular coil which consisted of a single loop copper wire, integrated in a 5F balloon catheter. Images were correlated with histologie sections regarding wall thickness, plaque area and plaque components. Results: DSA revealed no abnormalities in the 6 and 12 months old rabbits and only mild stenoses in the 24 and 36 months ones. High resolution imaging with surface coils resulted in an in-plane resolution of 234 x 468 um, Delineation of the vessel wall was not possible in younger rabbits and correlated only poorly with microscopic measurements in the 36 month old rabbits. Intravascular images achieved an in-plane resolut ion of 117 x 156 um, Increasing thickness of the aortic wall and plaque area was observed with increasing age. In the 24 and 36 months animals calcificat ion could be differentiated from fibrous and fally tissue based on the T2-FSE images, as confirmed by histologic correlation. Conclusion: Atherosclerotic evolution of hyperlipidemic rabbits can be mon itored with high resolution lntravascular MRI.

Purpose: To evaluate the aceuracy of MR PC velocimetry with regard to hemodynamic changes caused by atherosclerotic stenoses. Methods and Materials: Flow velocity measurements were obtained using a validated Doppler guidewire and a 1.0T MRI system in 31 consec utive patlents with atherosclerotic obstructions of the lower limb (mean age 72.5 years) . The intravascular measurements with the Doppler guide wire were undertaken dur ing balloon-PTA (pre and post dilatation). The MR PC measurements were obtained before angiegraphy and 24 h post PTA. Results: Generally, MRI obtained flow velocities are lower compared to the Doppler based data. The ratio proximal/intrastenotic velocities and calculated cross sectional area stenoses showed a low correlation for concentric stenoses (max .r = 0.33 post PTA). But both methods showed a decrease of crosssectional area stenoses (pre PTA Flowire 66%, post PTA 21% ; MR: 40%, 20%) . For phase contrast velocily measuremenls the exact definit ion of the luminal area , especially in excent ric stenoses, is problematic . An automated software may be helpful to obtain reliable data . Conclusion: The assessment of hemodynamic changes caused by atherosclerotic stenoses using MR phase contrast flow measurements is promising inspite the bad correlat ion with Doppler measurements.

Images obtained with both coils were evaluated for SNR, CNR , visibility and subjective image quality of arteries in the lower legs. The latter two were scored on a 3-point scale . Results: SNR and CNR were significantly higher (P < 0.005) using the dedicated lower leg extremity coil. Even more so subjective image quality was good in 39/40 lower legs. 4 of the 80 lower legs had subopt imal subtraction due to patient movement.

Purpose: To assess the reliability of contrast enhanced MR study of the venous system . Methods and Materials: 8 pts suspected of peripheral venous thrombosis and 3 patients with inferior vena cava thrombosis underwent MR examination (Magnetom Vision Plus, Siemens , Erlangen). MR Phlebography was performed by acqu iring a 3D FISP sequence (TRfTE/matrixlacq.t. : 4.612.4/195 x 512/23) during dynamic injection of 30 ml of gadolinium at 3 mI/sec, using apower injection. When injection was performed from a foot vein a compression was applied on the ankle in order to exclude the superficial venous system. MRA images were reconstructed using MIP algorithm. Findings have been confirmed with conventional flebography. Results: Visualization of the venous system was obtained in 6 patients with patent venous system . In two patients with thrombosis of the deep system of the leg no venous visualization occurred at the first acquisition, but only at delayed images . Inferior vena cava was always weil opacified , and thrombos is was easily detected within the vessel. Conelusion: MR Phlebography seems to be a reliable technique to evaluate the venous system .

Methods and Materials: Scans with optimized timing for each pal ient were performed in 20 cirrhotic OLT candidates and 8 healthy potential renal donors who underwent CE-MRA of the abdominal vessels. Gadolinium enhanced MRA was performed on a 1.5T scanner with a phased array bodycoil. After circulat ion time calculation a 17 sec. 3D Flash fatsuppressing pulse sequence (TRfTE 3.8/1.3, 30\u00b0) with a slice interpolation technique was repeated 4 times with a breathing interval of 12 sec. between the first four and 40 sec. between the last scans . Signal intensity in a selection of arteries and veins were measured to determine the optimal scantiming for each individual vessel. Results: Arteries showed maximum contrast on scan 1, the portal vein , renal vein and supra renal ICV on scan 2 or 3, whereas the infrarenal ICV showed maximum intensity on scan 3, 4 or 5 with equal distribut ion. No statistically significant difference was observed between the cirrhotic and healthy group. Conclusion: Both cirrhotic and non-c irrhotic patients can be evaluated by the same MRA scan sequence for optimal visualization of all abdominal vessels .

Purpose: Power-Doppler sonography improves the detection of slow and low volume blood f1ow. In breast carcinoma the vascularity is often increased compared to normal breast parenchyma. Therefor the purpose of our study was to determine, whether blood flow imaging with Power-Doppler offers new diagnostic capabilities to differentiate benign and malign breast diseases. Methods and Materials: 400 patients were prospectively investigated by 13-MHz high-frequency-ultrasound combined with Power-Doppler sonography. In 118 cases sonographie findings were correlated with histology. The increase in f1ow-signal density compared to normal breast parenchyma, scored semiquantitatively with ascale of 0 to +++, was registered. The sonographie diagnosis was based upon the ultrasonic appearance of alesion and the f1ow-characteristics in Power-Doppler. Results: 74.6% of benign breast lesions were score 0 or +, while the majority of invasive breast cancer (80%) showed a flow increase scored as ++ or +++. The degree of flow increase was related to the tumor size. By combining high-frequency ultrasound with Power-Doppler sonography we achieved a sensitivity of 87.5%, a specificity of 82.3% and an accuracy of 84.8% for the diagnosis of in situ and invasiv breast cancer. Conclusion: High-frequency-ultrasound combined with Power-Doppler proved to be a new, promising method in the diagnosis of breast diseases. Purpose: The trend towards conservative breast surgery has increased the importance of differentiating recurrent cancer from scar. Our inability to do so increases the number of benign biopsies performed. Dynamic enhanced MR is the current gold standard but is expensive and not widely available. A prospective, multi-centre, trial was performed comparing un-enhanced and enhanced colour Doppler ultrasound with histopathology. Methods and Materials: 57 women, age 57 y (29-79) with radiological/clinical suspicion of local recurrence, scheduled for biopsy were recruited.

Irregular vessels and shunts were more indicative of malignancy and best appreciated post-contrast. Purpose: To evaluate the overall quality of 3D ultrasound images achieved by a commercial equipment, comparing them to the conventional ultrasound imaging. Methods and Materials: A dedicated and certified phantom was employed for the evaluation of ultrasound imaging. The examination under compression has been performed laying the phantom on the standard compressor plate of a conventional mammograph. A linear ultrasound probe (10 MHz) was utilized whit beam focalization at 3 cm of depth. 3D reconstruction are bared on a spatial recognition and on a workstation. able to digitalize and elaborate ultrasound images. Imaging evaluation was performed by a 3D and 20 technique in the three spatial planes. The conventional ultrasound examination was obtained manually in a free scan by the same probe employed during the examination under compression and subsequently by a last generation equiment, supplied with a 7-13 MHz probe. Subsequent sessions of examination performed by different operators in different periods were effected. Results: The capabilities of the three different systems to visualize the focal zone inside the phantom, to gain linear and volumetrie measurements and to identify the exact location of the lesions were considered. The three systems result to be equivalent in focal regions recognition while 3~rec?nstruction system appears more accurate in topographie evaluation, Linear and volumetrie meaurements are reproducible whit higher precision in the system whit breast compressicn than in the cne with free and normal scanning. Conclusion: 3D recostruction system of ultrasound imaging in breast phantom is accurate in results reproducibility. Purpose: To investigate the depiction of mammography findings on the projection images obtained by automated ultrasound. Methods and Materials: A prototype imaging system yields x-raymammograms and mammography-like ultrasound survey images generated from an automatically acquired 3 0 data set of B-mode scans. Three physicians experienced in mammography and one physicists evaluated lesion conspicuity on the mammograms and ultrasound projections of 58 histologically proven lesions on ascale of 1 (not detectable) to 10 (clearly detectable). From these results, mean values were calculated for 26 benign and 32 malignant lesions. Results: The physicist and one experienced reader achieved identical mean values for the detectability of cancers on the mammograms (7.95) and the ultrasound projections (7.9), while the other two experienced readers had lower means on the ultrasound projections compared to the mammograms (5.3 versus 7.75). Regarding benign lesions, all four readers rated lesion visualization on the sonograms lower than on the mammographies (3.4 versus 5.95). Conclusion: The fact that the physicist, who was unexperienced in both methods,~n? even one of the experienced readers rated conspicuity of cancers sirnilarly on both mammographies and ultrasound projections rniqht sug~est that there is no difference between the two imaging procedures with respect to malignancies, whereas benign lesions actually appear to be less clearly depicted on ultrasound projections. Purpose: The possibility of differential diagnosis of breast tumours using voeal fremitus in sonography, deseribed by Sohn and eoworkers is eheeked under standardized eonditions. Methods and Materials: 41 patients with 8 malignant and 33 benign histologieally proven sonographie visible lesions were investigated using a Sonoline Elegra (Siemens) or a HDI 500 (ATL) ultrasound maehine (7.5 or 5-12 MHz linear array, eolor-and power-mode). Vibration artifacts indueed by the voeal fremitus and by asound generator-supplied smaliloudspeaker applied to the breast near to the array were observed. In addition, a \"motion artifaet\", appearing while the array is shaked, was analyzed. Results: A eorreet differentiation into a benign or malignant lesion was possible by means of vibration or motion artifact analysis in 21/41 cases (16 benign and 5 malignant, including 10 eystic lesions). 16/41 (13 benign and 3 malignant) lesions could not be differentiated, in 4 cases a benign lesion was shown to be malignant.",

Methods and Materials: 130 routinely generated knee MRI were retrospectively analyzed for the frequency, size and shape of fluid filled spaces within the dorsal aspect of the infrapatellar (Hoffa's) fat pad. Additionally anatomical dissections were performed in 20 cadaveric knees. Results: In 12 cases (9.2%) we found an ovoid shaped f1uid-equivalent recess within the dorsal, inferior aspect of Hoffa's fat pad, best visualized on mid-sagittal T2-weighted MR images. Its size ranged from 8 to 15 mm (11 \u00b1 3, mean \u00b1 standard deviation). In 3 cadaveric knees such recesses could be demonstrated just below the insertion of the ligamentum mucosum. Conclusion: Hoffa's recess can mimic an intraarticular ganglion on MRI. However, its ovoid shape, a diameter under 1.5 cm, and the location below the insertion of the infrapatellar plica (Le., ligamentum mucosum) may serve as differential diagnostic criteria to separate this rare anatomical variant from pathologic conditions. 10:30-12:00",

Methods and Materials: The investigation of the mammary gland and axillary Iymph nodes including colored Doppler ultrasonography, routine ultrasonography, mammography, c1inical and morphological methods was accomplished in 125 female patients age 30-70 years old. Results: Criteria of changes in Iymph nodes for differential diagnosis in benignant and malignant mammary disease were elaborated. As for malignant processes the pathognomostic are Iymph nodes exceeding 1.5 sm in dimensions, rounded, hypoechogenic, with no differentiation structure, of chaotic hypervascularisation. Conclusion: Ultrasound method has great potentials in detecting metastases to axillary Iymph nodes -accuracy -95%, sensitivity -93%, specificity -97%. Purpose: This study was undertaken to compare conventional T1weighted spin echo and T1-weighted hybrid rapid acquisition with relaxation (RARE) (turbo spin echo) MR imaging of the knee. Methods and Materials: 30 consecutive patients referred following acute knee trauma underwent both conventional and turbo spin echo imaging in either the coronal or sagittal plane. The same contrast parameters were used in both sequences (TE -20 msecs, TR -500 ms). Turbo imaging was performed with an echo train of 4 and an echo to view mapping seheme termed low-high profile order. Evaluation was made of meniscii, articular cartilage, and bone marrow by two reviewers in each case with work station calculations of both image signal to noise, contrast to noise and edge enhancement (bone marrow, fat and museie). Results: Turbo spin echo T1-weighted images were acquired in 1 minute and 20 seconds relative to 4 minutes and 10 seconds using conventional apin echo T1-weighted images. Short echo train combined with low-high echo to view mapping allowed Turbo T1-weighting without loss of edge enhancement relative to conventional spin echo images. Diagnostic discrepancy was observed in one patient in whom motion on a prolonged conventional sequence simulated a meniscal tear. The study protocol included a proton-density weighted SE-sequence in the sagittal, a T2*-weighted Flash-2D-Sequence in the coronal, a STIR-sequence in the axial, a T2-weighted TSE-sequence in the oblique coronal and a 3D-acquisition (DESS) in the axial plane. 75 patients were treated either conservatively or operatively.",

Orbital fracture is the third type of maxilofacial fracture in frequency (after nasal and mandibular fractures). Nevertheless it is the first one in needing the application of CT for its correct diagnosis. The orbital trauma statistics presented in this work can be used as a complementary tool for an adequate evaluation of this pathology. Purpose: Ta determine whether orbital volume assessment by CT following blow-out fracture could predict the degree of enophthalmos. Methods and Materials: Twenty-six patients with unilateral blow-out fracture were studied. The volumes of both orbits were measured thraugh contiguous axial sections employing cursor tracing of bony orbit and pratruding orbital fat fram digitalized CT scans. The volume expansion percentage of fractured orbit to the unaffected orbit was obtained. Enophthalmos was measured by Hertel's exophthalmometry after the develpment of blow-out fracture. We correlated the expansion percentage of orbital volume by CT with the degree of enophthalmos as determined by the Hertel's measurement and the presence of significant enophthalmos (>2 mm) which is indication for surgical correction.",

Methods and Materials: In vitra we examined defined small objects of various materials (metal, wood, glass, stone), wich are common as orbital FB. Density and minimum detectable size were studied. The findings of 33 patients with suspected orbital FB were compared with results of plain radiographs, comberg radiographs, sonography, surgery, or follow up. Furthermore, exposure to radiation was calculated for CT. Results: For iran, the minimum detectable size was 0.02 mm3. A differentiation of various materials by CT was not always possible, especially in small objects. There were wide differences in density of wood (-600 HU to +130 HU) according to hardness and water content, CT scans correctly showed number and location of orbital FB in 27 cases. In 6 cases, an orbital FB could be excluded correctly. other methods were c1early inferior: sonography had 5 false findings, plain radiographs could not show wood and could not localize FB exactly, and the comberg radiographs had 1 false extraocular finding. Depending on CT parameters, the effective and lenticular dose can range between 0.50 and 1.31 mSv, or 26 and 70 mSv respectivly. Conclusion: In presumed orbital FB, C'T should be done. In this work we present a descriptive study of orbital trauma: types, frequency, complications and association with other maxilofacial fractures. Over aperiod of one and half years we have gathered all the cases of orbital trauma at our centre. A total of 25 patients with orbital trauma (34 orbital fractures) have been studied with an helical CT. This helical CT unit is connected to a work station where three dimensional and multiplanar algorithms are used. The majority of patients were males (84%). The most frequent type of fracture was the orbital floor, the second being the medial wall fracture.

Adjunctive procedures to restore patency were PTA (61%), suction thrombectomy (10%), stent implantation (9%) and local fibrinolysis (18%). Primary patency rates, mortality rates, limb salvage rates and amputation free survival rates were calculated according to SVS Criteria. Patients were followed-up with clinical examination, ankle-brachial index, treadmill test and color coded duplex sonography and angiography in case of reobstruction. balloon angioplasty alone (n = 77) or balloon angioplasty followed by implantation of Palmaz stents (n = 77). Inclusion criteria were not more than three obstructed segments up to 5 cm in length in the superficial femoral or proximal popliteal artery with at least one patent run-off vessel. Follow-up included clinical assesment, ankle-brachial index (= ABI), color duplex ultrasound at 1, 3, 6, 12 months and intravenous angiography at 6 or 12 months after intervention. Purpose: To determine long-term results, and risk factors for early and late stent failure. Methods and Materials: Since 1988, 128 patients were included in a prospective, single-center study on flexible tantalum stents for the treatment of residual stenosis after balloon angioplasty of femoropopliteal stenosis (N = 54) or occlusion (N = 73). Post-procedural medication included 3 days standard heparin (N = 54) or 21 days lowmolecular weight heparin (LMWH) reviparin\u00ae (N = 74). Patients were followed clinically (N = 128) and angiographically or with color doppler sonography (105/128) for 1 to 117 months (mean 18 months). Results: The overall incidence of early stent thrombosis within ten days after stenting was 5%, the risk being higher in stents >4 cm than in short stents (p < 0.01). 1-,2-, and 3-years primary patency rate (PPR) was 77%, 54%, and 51% (femoral: 76%, 51%, and 49%, popliteal: 77%, 69%, and 68%), being higher in stents~4 cm versus Ionger stents, and for stented stenoses versus stented occlusions (p < 0.05). At multivariate analysis, stent length, lesion type, and secondary lesion were the most predictive factors. With reviparin treatment, the incidence of early and late stent failure could be diminished significantly (p < 0.05).",

Trauma aceounts for about 10% of all childhood death and is the leading cause of death among ehildren ages 1 to 14 years. Abdominal injuries occur in approximately 12% of children with major trauma. The majority of such injuries are hepatic, splenie or renal. Pancreatic, intestinal and mesenteric injuries oceur far less commonly. Signs and symptoms of abdominal trauma in our serious are: abdominal tenderness, ecchymosis, abrasion and distension. Laboratory results suggesting intra-abdominal trauma are: elevation of Iiver enzym levels, hematuria and low hematocrit levels. Diagnostic algorithm include: US, CT and DPL (diagnostic peritoneal lavage). We present experience of our own in diagnosing of blunt abdominal trauma in ehildren during the period of 3 years (1996) (1997) (1998) We examined 12 patients. Six of them were with spleen, 2 with pancreatie, and 3 with renal injuries. One of them was with hepatic injurie. In all of them we performed US and CT with application of intravenous contrast medium in rapid bolus. DPL was done in 5 cases. Purpose: In pediatric liver transplantation, long-term survival depends on the adaptation of the vascular supply to increasing organ demands of the growing child. We describe the hepatic artery flow to the transplant over a long period of follow-up. Patients and Methods: 21 Iiver transplant recipients less than 12 years of age at the time of transplantation (mean age: 4.6 years; range: 10 months to 11 years) were followed by duplex sonography. Mean time after transplantation was 9.6 years with a mean interval between initial and most recent examination of 7.4 years. The initial sonogram was performed at least 3 months postoperatively to exclude the effects of edema at the anastomosis. Results: Peak systolic velocity in the post-anastomotic (transplanted) hepatic artery was 45 cm/s at the initial examination and 42 crn/s at long-term follow-up with normal waveforms.

The aetive image field covers an area of about 43 by 43 crrr', required to satisfy the needs for all radiographie applieations. The detector was integrated into a bueky and a wall stand radiographie system and used routinely in a clinical environment. The achieved image quality is described in terms of physical parameters such as the detective quantum efficiency (DQE), and the modulation transfer function (MTF). Also, contrast detail phantoms were evaluated and their results eompared to the conventional systems. Results: DOE and MTF were found to be superior to conventional sereen-film systems. In the c1in ical environment the digital radiographie system provided fast aecess to the radiographie data and faeilitated the proeedures when eompared to conventional screen-film systems. Conclusion: The novel large size x-ray detector based on amorphous silicon technology provides excellent image quality, quantitatively deseibed by DOE and MTF. The high DOE is the key to strive for dose reduetions. Furthermore, the detector provides the missing link to render the radiological department fully digital.

D\u00f6hring; Magdeburg/D Purpose: To assess the technical and clinical performance of an experimental solid-state universal digital X-ray image receptor. Methods and Materials: A f1at-panel dynamic digital X-ray detector (FDXD, Philips Medical Systems), capable offunctioning in radiographic and f1uoroscopic (25 frames/sec) modes, was subjected to a rigorous technical assessment in a medical physics imaging laboratory (FAXiL, University of Leeds). A test rig incorporating the plate was installed in the research room of the Clinical Radiology Department, Leeds General Infirmary, and a range of patient examinations performed. Results: Technical assessment of objective image quality and dose efficiency confirms that FDXD is superior to currently available digital image capture systems, with a DOE(O) value approaching 70% in the c1 inical exposure range. The value of this parameter for computed radiography systems is approximately 20% under the same conditions. Initial c1inical experience has included musculoskeletal radiography, intravenous urography, arthrography and upper and lower GI barium studies. Results have again been very encouraging, despite the limitations of the test eonfiguration. Technical data and images will be presented. Conclusion: FDXD technology can provide direet digital radiography and f1uoroseopy in a single piece of equipment -a truly universal X-ray detector. Purpose: To evaluate the influence of a scatter reduction grid on the physieal image quality parameters of a digital selenium detector for different exposure conditions. Methods and Materials: We measured the MTF of a Thoravision system (Philips) using an angulated narrow tantalum slit (42.5 um), The data for noise analysis were obtained by uniform exposures. The tube voltage was varied over a range from 70 to 150 kVp. The speetral eomposition of the x-rays was investigated using a Ge-compton spectrometer (Canberra). The exposures were made with and without a seatter reduetion grid (GRIDGIL-AI N60 r12). Results: A scatter reduction grid nearly eliminates the scattered part of the x-ray spectrum. Higher x-ray energy results in a better resolution without using a grid. The signal-to-noise ratio decreases when lowering tne quantum energy. There is only a small influenee of the grid on the image-noise properties at a higher spatial resolution. The Iinearity of the imaging proeess in noncentral image areas deereases due to grid scatter reduction. Conclusion: The x-ray scatter reduction grid inereases the detail detectability in absorption image areas. However,without greater exposure 11:20 to image, define a straight line known as a transfer characteristic, the gradient of which determines image contrast. This study was impiemented to find a reproducible method of displaying digital images from adult and paediatric bone scans and pinhole hip views. Methods and Materials: The mean and maximum counts/pixel in the lumbar spine and femoral head were recorded for 30 paediatric and adult bone scans. The average values of these parameters were then assigned optical densities of 1.1 and 2.2 respectively to define three linear standardised transfer characteristics, one for each type of image. Results: Using a standardised transfer characteristic the displayed optical density of each pixel is governed only by the number of counts it contains and is completely insensitive to counts in other areas. This facilitates inter-and intra-study comparison of image data and eliminates the influence of hot spots on image quality. Conclusion: This is a reproducible method of displaying digital images. It is simple to implement and is based on data from sites of c1inical significance. Purpose: How much can the radiation dose for skull radiography be decreased by using digital luminescence radiography (DLR) c0f!1pared to conventional screen film system with grid cassette concernmg the clinical question? Methods and Materials: A skull phantom (3M) was x-rayed a.p. by conventional screen film system with grid cassette and DLR (ADC-70, AGFA). Voltage (kV) and tube current time product (mAs) were varyied and diminished gradually. The surface entrance dose was measured by a measuring feeler of Dosimax (Wellh\u00f6fer). Five investigators evaluated the images by characteristic and critical features, visual resolution and contrast. Results: The surface entrance dose at 73 kV/22 mAs was 0.432 mGy in conventional screen film system and 0.435 mGy in DLR Assessment of the digital images was very good with an average dose of 71% (0.308 mGy; SO 0.050) and sufficient evaluable down to an average dose of 31% (0.136 mGy; SO 0.065) by using a constant voltage (73 kV) and diminishing tube current time product. The line pairs were reduced by 1 or 2 steps depending on the investigator. The contrast was very good to sufficient. For the sufficient assessment of a fraclure I of paranasal sinuses I of measurement the skull the dose can be reduced to at least 56% (average 31%; SO 14.9%) 140% (average 27%; SO 9.3%) 118% (average 14%; SO 4.4%). Conclusion: The DLR allows the reduction of the surface entrance dose at the a.p. radiography of the skull to at least 56% (average 31%) -concerning the clinical question to at least 18%.

The calculation of the dose area product was pe~ormed~ith an ionisation chamber. The image quality was ranked with a subjective five-point scale. Results: Using the conventional PSA-technique (109 kVp, 3.2 mAs) the dose area product was 15.7 cGy/cm2. A dose reduction was only achievable by using digital images. The images had a g?od to satisfactory quality and the visualisation criteria for RSA were still met. Conclusion: Using digital radiography in RSA-examinations the dose area product can be reduced for approximately 8~% witho.ut loslnq image quality.

Results: Two young patients (aged 32 and 34 years) wlth farrnly history and headache had normal MR images. Fourty of the fourtytwo patients had lesions, as multiple small deep infarcts scattered in subcortical parietal (85%), frontal, occipital and temporal white matter and basal ganglia (25%), external capsule (55%), internal capsule, thalam~s, brainstem, and cerebellum (15%). More or less extensive and relative symmetric leucodystrophy was observed in 34 patients: Leucodystrop~y of external capsule was idenlified in 16 patients. All lesions were readily identificable by diffusion weighted MRI, whereas T2-weighted imaging was less sensitive in especially characterisation of lesion size (68%) and number (93%). Atrophy was only found in !wo older patients (aged 64 and 60 years). None of lesions was enhanced on enhanced T1weighted images. Conclusion: The MR features of CADASIL are characteristic, and weil observed with diffusion weighted imaging. There are multiple lacunar infarcts and leucodystrophie without contrast enhancement. Purpose: We used diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) in addition to routine MR imaging in order to provide a more rapid non invasive way to make this sometimes confusing diagnosis.

A significant progression of the lesions was seen on the follow-up scans. In all patients the lesions appeared in one hemisphere and extended to the contralateral hemisphere on the follow-up scan. In one patient, abnormalities were seen on DWI only. ADC values were normal or slightly elevated. Conclusion: DWI appears to improve the in vivo diagnosis of CJD and may thus decrease the number of false negative MR examinations when relying on proton-density and T2-weighted images only. The DWI changes probably reflect the spongiform degeneration, astrocytosis and neuronal 1055 on pathology. We recommend DWI whenever there 15 a elinical suspicion of CJD.

DWI maps and lesion relative ADC values were obtained in 34 consecutive stroke patients to evaluate the sensitivity and reliability of the proposed DWI-IEPI technique for ischemic brain damage. Moreover, 3D-rendering and maximum intensity projection of the hyperintense lesions was used for assessment of lesions spatial extend. Results: Phantom and volunteer study yielded excellent agreement with published data. The intrasubject variation of relative ADC was 6.2%. The precision of ADC ranged from 6.5% to 12.9% depending on anatomie region. IEPI allowed the rapid acquisition (-4-5 min) of high quality images without any significant artifacts. All patient studies were of diagnostic quality. Within the first week, the sensitivity of DWI-IEPI for acute infarction was 90% of first examinations, independent of lesion location. A short period of reduced sensitivity in ADC maps was found -200 hours after ictus due to pseudonormalization of ADC. Conclusion: DWI-IEPI in conjunction with phase navigation and cardiac triggering is a robust, reliable and fast technique for DWI. Anisotropie DWI-IEPI provides reasonable image quality also on conventional gradient hardware (10 mT/m) and warrants further study of the sensitivity and specificity with a large patient series in general clinical use. In comparison to trace-maps, isotropie DWI is three to six times faster and provides images free from fiber anisotropy, but requires high performance gradients (20 mT/m) due to the otherwise inappropriately prolonged diffusion time.",

            "text": "Purpose: To show the contribution of background noise in the calculation of ADC and to suggest alternative, noise-robust techniques for parameter estimation especially important in sequences with inherently prolonged diffusion times (isotropie DWI). Methods and Materials: Monte Carlo simulations were performed to compare conventional parameter estimation techniques (linear regression, non-linear least square fits) with two novel approaches considering the Rician (Rayleigh) distribution of the background noise on MR magnitude images. A maximum likelihood estimator approach and a model which automatically corrects for the amount of noise contribution were used. Simulations were carried out using representative ADCs of typical tissues (CSF, WM, GM, acute stroke) with a variable number and magnitude of b-values and with reasonable SNRs. Results and Conclusion: Normal or poisson distribution of noise is aprerequisite for standard fitting techniques. For higher diffusion weighted signal sampies this may be no longer true and sampies with different DW show different noise distributions. Hence, a (non)linear fit based on a monoexponential decaying model is inappropriate. The model has to be extended by a term representing the contribution of the noise distribution or might be replaced by a certain maximum likelihood estimator approach. Both new methods are superior to standard techniques in terms of accuracy in ADC calculation for low SNR. Using conventional fitting diffusion weighted sampies below a certain signal threshold biases the ADC to lower values. This may lead to a reduced lesion contrast and diagnostic sensitivity. Although, acute stroke lesions contrast best with bD = 1.11 (2 point method), the introduced bias in ADC of normal parenchyma (-17%) due to this heavy DW should be kept in mind especially when ratios between both compartments are calculated (rADC). Virtual endoscopy allows for moving the observer into a 3D data set and providing images from 'inside' a structure of interest. This is only possible by using perspective rendering instead of parallel projections sueh as in standard 3D rendering techniques. Navigation techniques are employed to virtually move through the structures of interest. This baslc review discusses the prerequisites for aequiring a data volume suitable for performing virtual endoscopy (voxel size, overlapping the number of diagnostic investigations requ ired for preoperative workup and , by consequence, the length of hospitalisation.

After a mean follow-up period of 10.9 \u00b1 4.9 months (range 3-18 months), local recurrence (i.e., recurrence within or around a successfully treated lesion) was seen in 1 (2%) of 49 cases after RF ablation and in 7 (13%) of 52 cases after PEI (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Percutaneous ablation of small HCC can be safely achieved with either RF treatment or PEI. RF ablation, however, requires a lower number of treatment sessions and is associated with a lower local recurrence rate. To determine the value of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in follow-up of small \u00ab3 cm) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with percutaneous US-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Methods and Materials: RFA was performed in 23 patients with single HCC lesion by using 18-gauge cooled-tip electrodes with 2-3 cm tip exposure. All patients underwent MR imaging at 0.5 T before and after RFA. Sequences included unenhanced SE T1, T2-weighted, GRE and dynamic gadolinium-enhanced SE T1-weighted. At follow-up every six months, unenhanced and dynamic MR images were correlated with findings at contrast-enhanced spiral CT. Therapeutic assessment was established with pathologie evaluation of resected specimens in 9 cases; in the remaining cases, results of US-guided fine needle biopsy were used. Results: In 16 patients followed up for 18 months, complete tumor necrosis was obtained with RF. In these cases, the treated lesions showed hypointensity on unenhanced T2-weighted images and loss of enhancement on dynamic MR images. These features corresponded to S100 a nonenhanced, low-attenuation area on follow-up contrast-enhanced spiral CT scans. In the other 7 patients, viable residual tumor remained after RFA At six-month follow-up in these patients, the lesions showed areas of hyperintensity on unenhanced T2-weighted images and enhancement on dynamic MR images that corresponded to regions of high attenuation on spiral CT scans. Purpose: Heat sump effect in hyper or normally perfused tissue effectively limits the volume of necrosis achieved with thermal ablation. Blood f10w manipulation in conjunction with thermal ablation is currently under investigation. Not only do liver metastases alter regional blood flow but thermal injury has a dramatic effect on regional perfusion. We used dynamic CT to measure tissue perfusion changes induced by thermal ablation therapy. Methods and Materials: Rapid sequential single slice CT acquisition following bolus injection of 50 ml of IV contrast at 7-10 mlfs was used to measure the kinetics of hepatic arterial and portal venous flow and derive quantitative measurements. 26 patients with liver metastases were studied both before and after treatment and in 11 patients, again at 3 months. Results: Mean tumour perfusion was 0.2 ml/min/ml. Thermal ablation (laser or radiofrequency) induced an immediate, marked increase in arterial perfusion in the surrounding normal liver within minutes of the start of treatment. Arterial perfusion increased from mean of 0.22 to 0.9 ml/ml/min. This was usually but not always concurrent with reduced portal perfusion. Conclusion: There is a rapid and dramatic change in hepatic arterial flow in response to thermal injury. This will have implications for planning thermal ablation therapy. Purpose: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) offers the potential to destroy significant volumes of malignant tissue within the pancreas using fine needles to deliver laser fibres. Methods and Materials: 12 patients were treated over an 18 month period using 4-6, 19G needles positioned at 15-18 mm intervals within the tumour, 5 days after administration of the photosensitiser, mTHPC. 20J of red light from a diode laser was delivered at each treatment station. All patients had endobiliary stents in situ. Treatment efficacy was assessed at 5 days with contrast enhanced CT and clinical followup. Results: All 12 patients tolerated the procedure weil. Around each treatment station the de-vascularised area measured 14-19 mm in diameter. Confluent necrosis was achieved where there was overlap of treatment stations. The total volume of necrosis was 12-36 ml. In 4 cases there was ulceration of the duodenal wall on endoscopy. This was c1inically insignificant and healed in 3 months. One patient developed transient gastric outflow obstruction. 9/12 patients remain alive at 13 months median follow-up (range 1-21) Conclusion: PDT appears safe and weil tolerated and can debulk small pancreatic tumours by over 90%. The impact of this novel therapy on survival will rapidly emerge from extension of this series. Purpose: Evaluation of percutaneous interventional embolization in gastrointestinal bleeding over a long term observation from 1989 to 1997. Methods and Materials: 35 patients with gastrointestinal hemorrhage have been presented for interventional therapy primarily or secondary after unsuccessful endoscopy or surgery. Patients age ranges from 18 to 89 years. Bleeding causes were upper GI-ulcerations (n =7), diverticula (n =3), tumour (n =6), vascular malformations (n =4), hemorrhoids (n =2) or unknown (n = 1). They appeared postoperatively (n = 6), posttraumatic (n =2) or postinflammatory (n =4). As embolization agent ethibloc (12 x) and coils (14 x) were preferred. In some cases (6 x) combinations of therapeutics such as gelfoam particles and tissue glue or coils and ethibloc were used. Only once a patient was treated by PVA-particles, a covered stent and a wire manouver for dissection. Results: In 29 of 35 patients (83%) the hemorrhage could be stopped completely.",

Dosda: Valenc/alE Purpose: To determine the relationship between the tumor and sear enhancement characteristic with dynamic MR and time-enhancement curves. Methods and Materials: Ten patients with FNH Iiver lesions were studied with plain MR. The slice showing the tumor scar was selected for the dynamic single slice T1W GRE. Quantitative image analysis was performed with time-enhancement curves from the lesion and the scar. Results: On the 9 cases with ascar, dynamic images showed homogeneous early vigorous enhancement of the lesion with delayed enhancement of the scar. However, visual comparison of the curves idenlified two slightly different patterns. In the parallel pattern, both curves started early after the contrast administration and, after a rapid inerease in enhancement, reached a plateau maintained over time (77.8%). In the divergent pattern, again both curves started very early after the contrast administration but, after the maximum slope was passes, a plateau was reached in which the curve of the scar was situated above the curve of the FNH (22.2%). Conclusion: Time-enhancement curves demonstrate a c1ear relationship between the lesion and scar enhancement of FNH. 2. Lesions ::; 3 cm: n =7. All were identified on EPI in homogeneous hypersignal without eentral sear. -All the lesions shown on T1 with gadolinium were perfectly identified on EPI (24/24). Regarding deteetability, EPI is better than T2TSE (3 lesions were not visible on T2). -The central scar was seen in 70% of lesions larger than 3 cm, and never in smalller lesions regardless of the sequence. Conclusion: EPI can be useful in FNH because of its rapidity (40 contiguous slices in 5 seconds), and its diagnostic capacity is better than T2TSE, espeeially in small lesions. EPI is complementary to the T1 Gadolinium study and facililates the multifocal lesions diagnosis. It may be useful for FNH characterization. Purpose: To improve the contrast performance and spatial resolution in T2w turbo spin-echo imaging. Methods and Materials: A turbo spin-echo based sequence was implemented, in which the excitation pulse and one refocussing pulse are followed bya delayed echo train (7 echoes, echo spacing: 8.5 msec, effective echo time: variable). Thirty-eight patients with various focal Iiver lesions were examined at 1.5 Tesla using a phased-array body coil with following sequences: T1-weighted gradient-echo, conventional T2-weighted turbo SE with fatsat (CTSE, 11 echos, TEeff: 99 msec); T2weighted single breath-hold turbo SE (HASTE), and DELET-TSE with fatsat (TEeff = 109 msec).",

Methods and Materials: Multicentre, randomised, dose-ranging, crossover study of four intravenous SonoVue \u2122 doses (0.3, 0.6, 1.2, 2.4 mL) in 39 patients with suspected carotid or peripheral artery disease. Color or power Doppler imaging and spectral analyses were performed at baseline and after each SonoVue \u2122 dose. All images were assessed independently by two off-site assessors who were blinded to the dose used and to any information upon the patients. Primary endpoints were: change from baseline in the diagnostic quality of Doppler examination (7-point scale), duration of c1inically useful signal enhacement (min), accuracy of the ultrasound examination (on the basis of X-ray angiography findings). Results: Statistically significant change from baseline in the quality of the Doppler examination was observed at all doses (p < 0.05). A significant (p < 0.001) dose response was observed in the duration of clinically useful enhancement (mean: 4-6 min). Agreement with X-ray angiography was: pre-dose, 30-56%; 0.3 mL, 59%; 0.6 mL, 70-74%; Aim: It was to determine the relationship between ultrasound-evaluated carotid plaque homogeneity and contrast, stenosis on duplex with the prevalence of ipsilateral cerebrovascular symptoms (ICS). Methods and Materials: 150 patients referred for carotid scan, with 192 plaques, 81 symptomatic and 111 asymptomatic, having 50-99% stenosis, were studied. All ultrasound images of plaques were standardised so that the grey scale median (GSM) of blood was 0-5 and the GSM of the adventitia was 180-200. Homogeneity (HOM) and contrast (CON) were evaluated on a computer with the Spatial Grey Level Dependence Matrix Method. Results: For the purposes of the analysis, HOM of 0.3, CON of 100 and stenosis of 70% were considered as arbitrary cut-off levels and the prevalence of ICS was noted: Raynaud's phenomenon). In a standardized way a dorsovolar sagital and axial scans of the distal phalanx were achieved. Depending on the clinical symptoms and the perfusion the examination was repeated either after a warm or cold water bath of the hand. Semiquantitatively the vessel density, the vessel diameters and the Doppler spectrum were measured. For all these examinations a Multi-D-Array, VFX 13-5 (12 MHz) in combination with a Sonoline Elegra\u00ae (Siemens) was used. Results: In arteries down to 0.1 mm Doppler flow signals were measured. In healthy volunteers a relevant variability of the vessel density after warm/cold water bath was noticed. A significant difference to that variability was measured in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon and sclerodermia. Patients with advanced diabetes yielded alterations of the Doppler spectrum. Conclusion: With a Multi-D-Array an extremely low blood-flow in vessel-diameters down to 0.1 mm is measurable. The evaluation of distal finger arteries in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon, advanced diabetes mellitus and sclerodermia allows reproducible and noninvasive follow-ups.",

Sidhu; London/UK Purpose: B-mode ultrasound of the carotid artery identifies the intimal medial layer (IML), hypoechoic compared to the proximal intimal medial interface (IMI). Increase granularity of the IML is associated with early atherosclerosis. This reproducibility study assesses a method of assessing IML reflectivity. Methods and Materials: 10 volunteers (18-34 yrs), no risk factors of atherosclerosis. Two observers examined each subject twice for 2 weeks apart. Both common carotid arteries were imaged using a 7-10 MHz transducer, settings standardised. Images incorporating the IML were digitised and analysed by a custom computer program. Ratio calculated, averaging over a length of arterial wall, lowest pixel brightness in IML over the maximum pixel brightness in IMI. Results: Coefficient of variation (CV) for the intra-observer measurements were 6% and 5% and for inter-observer variation at each session 7% and 10%. Pooled results gave an inter-session CV of 9%. 92.5% of all measurements were within two standard deviations of the mean measurement of combined initial and repeat results. Conclusion: We have derived a new reproducible method of quantifying the IML reflectivity. This may prove to be the earliest method of imaging atherosclerotic change, preceding IML thickening. Methods and Materials: 32 patients with suspected carotid artery stenosis or peripheral vascular disease received 4 intravenous BR1 doses, 0.3, 0.6, 1.2 and 2.4 mL, in random order. CDS examinations were performed pre-dose and following each dose. The resulting 5 (baseline and 4 post-dose) videoclips were assessed separately and in random order by 2 off-site, blinded readers, who made an ultrasound diagnosis (total vessel patency, occlusion, stenosis and degree of stenosis, presence of collaterals, aneurysm). The accuracy of offsite ultrasound diagnoses was evaluated by an independent panel of c1inicians on the basis of X-ray angiography and/or contrast-enhanced MR angiography findings. Results: All BR1 doses significantly (p < 0.01) increased the accuracy of CDS studies, in terms of both detection/exclusion of vessel abnormality and assessment of disease severity. Purpose: Minimally invasive coronary arteriography with electron beam tomography (EBT) has been reported to have promising results. We sought to determine the diagnostic accuracy of EBT angiography using conventional coronary angiography (CCA) as reference test. Methods and Materials: 24 patients were included. During iv injection of contrast agent, 40 consecutive transaxial tomograms were obtained, with 1.5 mm collimation covering 6 cm of the coronary trajectory in one breathhold with ECG triggering at 80% RR interval. 3D reconstructions were obtained using Voxelview software. CCA was performed on each patient before or after the EBT study within two weeks. Results: Of 168 coronary segments, 76% were analyzable. 19 stenoses were present. Overall sensitivity and specificity were 68% and 94%. All left main segments were evaluable (accuracy 100%). In 88% the left descending artery was evaluable (sensitivity 70%, specificity 97%). The circumflex artery was evaluable in 77% (sensitivity 77%, specificity 75%). The (proximal) right coronary artery was evaluable in 54% (sensitivity 25%, specificity 88%). Conclusion: The position of 3D EBT of the coronary arteries remains to be defined. To exclude disease a high sensitivity is required; however, in a relatively healthy population the relative high specificity of EBT might be useful.",

Conclusion: CTA seems to be a valuable tool to exclude occlusion when CM is seen in the lumen of the bypass. However, the method is hampered by false positive \"pseudoocclusions\". Conclusions: The nonionic contrast medium was not associated with a higher rate of abrupt vessel closure requiring repeat-angioplasty, or major ischemic events. Severe allergic reactions requiring therapy occurred only after the ionic compound. These data suggest that nonionic contrast media do not increase the risk of thrombotic complications but minimize the risk of allergic reactions in patients undergoing coronary interventions.",

Aim was to evaluate spiral CT with retrospective ECG gating of the heart and adjacent lung. Methods and Materials: We imaged 20 patients on a Siemens SOMATOM Plus 4 CT scanner. An ECG was stored in a PC together with the x-ray trigger pulse. Standard reconstructions were compared to ECG-retrogated reconstructions under limited angles (240\u00b0) and timeoptimized reconstructions. 'Partial scan' reconstructions of images with short time intervals in-between (10-50 ms) were additionally performed. Results: Retrospective ECG-gating leads to areduction of motion artifacts of the heart and the adjacent lung in spiral CT in patients with a moderate heart rate. Thus an improved depiction of coronary calcium as weil as cardiac pathology seems possible. Calculating images with short time intervals in-between offers dynamic image series of cardiac motion from a continuous data set, thus allowing to visualize cardiac wall movement. Conclusion: Retrospectively ECG gated spiral CT of the heart and the adjacent lung leads to an improved image quality in patients with a moderate heart rate between 60 and 80 bpm. The procedure is easily performed. Further reduction of image acquisition time is necessary. Purpose: Conventional spiral CT may be a non-invasive and inexpensive screening tool for coronary artery disease (CAD), but is limited by its lower temporal resolution. ECG-gated spiral image reconstruction may improve coronary artery visualization. Methods and Materials: Nine patients were scanned using protocols based on heart rate, coverage required and duration of breath-hold, guaranteeing contiguity of CT slices on a 60 rpm scanner. Four image sets were reconstructed: D1 -mid-diastole (center of T-to-R waves), D2 -mid-diastole (275 msec from T wave), SS -systole (SS), and STDstandard (1 image/revolution) images. Two radiologists, a technologist and a cardiologist performed blinded evaluation of the studies. Each of D1, D2 and SS images were compared to STD images, and graded as better, equal or worse for visualization of at least 1 cm of left main, left anterior descending, circumflex and right coronary arteries, and any coronary calcification.

Conclusion: Using ultrafast Gadolinium-enhanced 3D breath-hold imaging oblique projection MR coronary angiograms can be successfully performed. Sensitivity for detecting coronary stenoses is considerably low and further techniqual improvements are mandatory to introduce this technique as a reliable diagnostic tool in clinical practice. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to show the value of evaluation of respiratory gated magnetic resonance imaging of the coronary arteries (MRCA) with a volume rendering technique. Methods and Materials: 26 patient were studied from those referred for conventional coronary angiography (CAG). MRCA was performed with a retrospective respiratory gated gradient echo sequence with a resolution of 1.9 x 1.2 x 2.0 mm. Three partly overlapping slabs were acquired in 30-40 minutes. Evaluation of the data was performed after segmentation of the desired volume with a volume rendering technique (VoxeIView, Vital Images). CAG was performed within 2 weeks. Blinded evaluation of the MR images were performed by a radiologist and a cardiologist unaware of the CAG results. Results: The left main coronary artery was visualized in 96% of the patients with diagnostic image quality, The LAD, RCA and CX were visualized in 50% to 96% respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of significant lesions were 52% (25% to 75%) and 93% (89%-97%) respectively.

In all patients at least one atternpt to cross the lesion with an unaided wire had been carried out. Results: The angioplasty success rate was 59% (46/78) this compared to 38.6% in a group where conventional guidewire techniques alone were used. Major complications occured in 2 patients neither were fatal. Regression analysis idenlified duration of occlusion \u00ab6 months) and length of lesion \u00ab15 mm) as predictors of success. Vessel calcification and other angiographic findings did not influence the end result. Conclusion: Activated guidewire angioplasty is an effective adjunct to treatment in chronic coronary oclusions. Purpose: Ta compare the accuracy of diameter and area measurements and radial geometry accuracy of two mechanical (CVIS, DUMED) and one phased array (Endosonics) intravascular ultrasound sytems. Methods and Materials: Lumen quantification was carried out by using a phantom of known dimensions. 9 catheters were used in the study. The influence of ultrasound frequency and catheter size and type were studied. Results: The mean deviations of measured frorn true diameters of the phantom veried between different catheters of the same specification as wel as different types of catheter. Mean deviations for a 30 Mhz mechanical catheter (CVIS) were 0.03-0.05 +/-0.03 mm. for 20 Mhz. phased array catheters (Endosonics) 0.30-0.45 +/-0.09-13 mm and for the mechanical 32.5 Mhz (DU-MED) were 0.54 +/-0.13 mm. The percent luminal area measurement deviations frorn true area were underestimated with all small french sized catheters (average 14% for phased array and 24% for mechanical) and were overestimated by large sized mechanical catheters (5%) Conclusion: Large deviations frorn true measurements were observed with certain types of IVUS catheters, caution should be observed when these cathers are used for making measurements of lumen diameter prior to intervention.",

Radiography, spiral Cl scan and MRI were performed in 25 patients with wh iplash injury in aperiod between 2 and 10 days after trauma. Results: 1. No fractures were seen on radiograph ie exam ination. 2. Cl scan was able to detect oecult end plate and spinous process fractures in the resorption phase . Results: 67 fractures were posltraumatic, 20 osteoporotic, and 9 tumorrelated . 85 fractures (88.5 %) exhibited no vacuum phenomenon, 11 fractu res (11.5%) showed gas inclusions. Most frequenlly IWP were found at Th12 (4 of 20 fractures , 20%) and L1 (4 of 23 fractures, 17.4%). No vacuum phenomena were detected above Th12 level. 6 of 20 osteoporotic fraclures (30%), 5 of 67traumatic fractures (7.5%) and none of 9 tumor-related fractures (0%) exhibited a vacuum phenomenon. The difference of osteoporotic fractures and traumatic or tumor-related fractures was significant (p < 0.001 , chi2-test ). Conclusion: Intraosseous vertebral vacuum phenomena after fractures are far more frequent than expected and related to osteoporosis. Vacuum phenomenon nearly excludes tumor-related fraclure. As intraosseous gas inclusions are so frequent, they most Iikely do not represent vertebral osteonecrosis. Purpose: To evaluate sensitivity and specificity of MRI in diagnosing spondyl itis. Although it is a rare disease due to tuberculosis, AIDS and organ -transplantations the incidence is increasing. The erarly diagnosis is achallenge for all imaging moda lilies because unspec ified clin ical symptoms and laboratory data result in prolonged latency in diagnosing leading to invalidily and immense health care costs . Methods and Materials: Between 1988 and 98 we performed more than 4000 MR spine examinations. An operatively proven spondylitis was diagnosed in 95 cases (cerv ical = 7, thoraeie = 19, lumbar = 69). All patients received sagittal T2w and T1w scans without and with Gadolinium. X-ray was available in all pat ., CT in 41 and scintigraphy in 26 . Results: The signal alteration is mostly T1w hypo-and T2w hyper intense and is localized almost symmetrically on both sides of a disk with a broader extens ion to the ventral part of the vertebral body. The diagnostic sensitivity of MRI is 89 .5%. CT is preoperatively less accurate but is essential for patients beeing stabiJized with bone grafts in postoperative follow-up. Since Gd-enhancement will be seen all over in MRI postoperatively, CT demonstrates accurate cortical and spong iosa structure of the graft. Callus formation and fusion of the adapted graft in CT represent incorporation and stability, whereas inflammatory processes lead to Iytic and destructive changes. Conclusion: X-ray remains the basic documentation. In 95 cases of proven spondylitis MRlturns out to be the diagnostic modality of choice with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 71%. Gd-enhancement and typical signal intensities enable a semiquantitative grading in acute , moderate and chronic spondylitis. Following surgery CT offers most accurate facts about healing of implemented bone grafts and callus formation. Purpose: Computed tomography (CT) reveals a comb ination of dense dependent opacification and widespread ground glass opacification in ARDS patients. Refraetory hypoxaemia is a defining feature of ARDS , and manipulation of the pulmonary circulation is of great interest in this cond ition . Methods and Materials: Regional pulmonary perf usion was studied in 12 subjects with ARDS using EBCT, wh ich allows the evaluat ion of perfusion within specified regions of interest (ROI). At a sing le level, repeated sections were obtained during the injection of non-ionic contrast. Perfusion was calculated in five ROI along the dorsal-ventral lung ax is. Results: In 5 subjects with no dependent opacification, there was a marked gravitational gradient in perfusion (p < 0.001) , whereas in 7 subjects with dependent opaci ficat ion , the gradient was more uniform (p 0.003) , due to a relalive deerease in perfus ion in dependent reg ions. Conelusion: EBCT, has the potential to define regional pulmonary perfusion in ARDS, and may allow th erapeutic interventions aimed at manipulat ing the pulmonary circulation to be assessed.",

The purpose was 1.) to develope the interface between respirator and EBCT and 2.) to evaluate image processing routines to quantify lung aeration behaviour in mechanical ventilated patients. Methods and Materials: An electronic trigger was developed, that utilized the respirator's synch ronizing signal to start the scan at the beginn ing of mechanical expiration . In the 50 ms scan mode with Bmm eollimation, 40 slices could be acquired during the expiratory phase of 2 seconds . The scanner was positioned 1 cm above the diaphragm in order to determine the changes in lung density, time-dependent, dur ing mechanical expiration . During controlled mechan ical expiration at vary ing levels of PEEP (0, 5, 10, 15 cm H20), time-density curves from defined (spatially and grey-value related) regions of interest were used to compute the changes in pulmonary aeration. The dynamic greyvalue changes were color-coded. Results: Significant changes of expiration dynamics caused by different PEEP settings could be measured. Conelusion: Respirator triggered EBCT ofters the possibility of visualizing and quantifying the dynam ic changes in the lungs during expirat ion in mechanieal ventilated patients . Purpose: Scoliosis radiography is difficult in a digital environment because of the need to cover the whole spine. We have made a dose assessment of a new method whieh overcomes this problem. Methods and Materials: The patient is examined standing with an image intensifier system. Aseries of 30 to 40 collimated images are exposed . The images are combined in a computer into an image of the whole sp ine where measurements can be made. An alternative method is to save pulsed f1uoroscopy to memory. The dose measurements were made with an Alderson phantom packed with thermoluminescent dosimeters. Furthermore, a Monte Carlo simulation has been made. Results: For the exposure method , the measured efteclive dose is 0.25 mSv, three times higher than our old film-sereen method (0.08 mSv). For the f1uoroscopy variant, the dose is only 0.03 mSv. All Monte Cario simulations showed good correlation with measured values. Conelusion: The exposure method is useful but has a rather high dose . Purpose: To evaluate the dynamic effect of varying levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ventilated patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Methods and Materials: After modification of the EBCT machine to perform arespirator triggered scanning, we used the 50 msec scan mode and accquired 40 slices in 2 seconds of expiration. The slice positlon was at level of 1 cm above the diaphragm. Time density curves from calculated regions of interest (ROI) in defined regions of both left and right lungs were used to compute the changes in pulmonary aeration.

Three sec after a 2-sec rate bolus injection of Gd-DTPA, dynamic P-MRI was acquired utilizing a 3D turbo MR angiographie technique with zero-filling interpolation (TRITE/FA =3 ms/0.9 ms/30 D , acqulsltion time =3 sec/scan, partition = 16-20 sections, slab thickness =6\u00fc-80 mm). With total acquisition time of 30-40 sec, 10-13 sequential transaxial images were produced at each lung level (FOV =320 x 380 mm, matrix =176 x 176), yielding time-intensity curves (TlCs).

Results: Bolus administration of He-3 was sufficiently accurate and reproducible. The signal-to-noise ratio of He-3 within the lungs was sufficient for analysis of the decay function (>3). In vivo, the theoretically predicted relationship of T1 to ambient oxygen and RF voltage was confirmed. From two consecutive images -acquired at a known Fee02 -the effective flip angle was determined: 2.74 \u00b1 0.29 (RF = 10 V). Subsequently, regional oxygen concentration were calculated from independently acquired image series yielding a elose correlation with Fee02 (r = 0.93).",

Methods and Materials: 160 patients were examined by ehest X-ray 5 months after RT. Previous examinations and the contralateral lung were used as controls. The observed radiological abnormalities were scored according to Arriagada with respect to grade of density (1-3) and affected pulmonary region (apical-Iateral, central-parahilar, basallateral). The highest density grade within each region were added together. Patients scoring 0-3 were c1assified as having slight radiological reactions and scores ranging from 4-9 represented moderate to severe reactions. The scores were compared to pulmonary complications and target volumes. Results: Increasing scores were correlated with pulmonary complications (P < 0.001) and increasing target volumes (P < 0.001).",

            "text": "Results: Generally, a better resolution is possible with this scanner. When compared to conventional 4 th generation scanners, doubling the resolution is possible within the identical measurement time. This allows artifact reduction in the posterior fossa, due to thin slice acquisition (1 mm) adding the slices to 4 mm thickness in a postprocessing procedure. Furthermore, the higher resolution provides benefits for diagnosis of the petrous bone, as weil as the sella region. Oue to short rotation time (0.5 s) lung artifacts in the niveau of the heart are reduced significantly. The multirow-detector technique allows acquisition of high-resolution (1 mm) and \"conventional\" (4 mm) lung images. The value for abdominal CTA has to be elaborated in future studies. Conclusion: The new CT technique, introduced here, allows improved resolution respectively shortened measurement times. Purpose: 30-visualizations of intrahepatic vessels and their relationship to lesions, improves the planning of complex resections and vessel reconstructions. In this context it is important that radiologists have access to fast and robust computer assistance to provide the surgeon with optimal quantitative and visual information. Methods and Materials: CTAP or biphasic spiral CT data are filtered (noise reduction and adaptive background compensation) and the intrahepatic vessels are segmented by threshold based region growing. A newly developed skeletonization algorithm, that combines thinning and suppression of boundary noise, enables a precise computation of the medial axis as weil as local vessel radii. This information allows an automatic identification of the portal and hepatic vein and their branching structure. Results: Segmentation and 30-visualization of the hepatic vesselsystems requires little interaction and takes only a few minutes. The main branches of the portal vein are identified automatically, allowing the determination and visualization of individual liversegments. Selecting and coloring of branches/subtrees or measuring length, volume and diameter are supported. Conclusion: The proposed method provides a robust analysis of the morphology and structure of the intrahepatic vessels. This method applies to all imaging techniques involving contrasted vesselsystems and therefore has great potential for other c1inical applications. Purpose: To test the feasibility of assessing volumetrie indices from routine CT investigations of the abdomen. Methods and Materials: 30 patients with solitary neoplastic liver lesions underwent contrast enhanced CT using routine protocols. Additionally, phantoms with known volumes were scanned. Data were transferred to a dedicated image evaluation system (Virtuoso, Siemens). A specially designed computer program capable of semi-automated segmentation based on b-spline technique was used to determine the voxel-volume of phantoms and lesions in vivo. Voxel volumes were converted to actual volume indices using different algorithms and results were compared with phantom volumes and surgical findings. Results: An accurate prediction of the actual volume was feasible with an error <5%. Depending on the size and shape of the target, adapted algorithms of volume calculation yielded more accurate results. Conelusion: Semi-automated segmentation is a valuable tool for the assessment of volume indices from CT data. This technique may be applicable in a variety of clinical settings i.e, abdominal and thoracic surgery or oncology.",

Identification in 3Dreconstruction was assessed without and with knowledge of 2Danalysis. 3D-visualization of segmented and registered data was done using volume rendering. Variable transparency settings were used to visualize areas near the brain surface or in the depth. Results: 19/52 areas of interest were localized in deeper brain structures. Size of lesions ranged from 5-30 mm. Using one setting of transparency levels, 11/19 deeply located and 6/32 superficially located lesions could not be distinguished in 3D-view. Only when using 4 settings of transparency levels, all 52 areas were seen. However, 24 additionallesions were suspected without knowledge of the 2D data analysis.

Methods and Materials: TO values were measured directly from the gray and white matter in normal volunteers. The data was analyzed using conventional gamma variant fitting methods and a modified analysis technique which combines 1) single pixel estimation of TO values prior to fitting, 2) flexible model based principle component noise reduction 3) modified gamma variant curve fitting to include TOas a fitting parameter. The quality of parametric images of TO and TTP was assessed by two experienced neuroradiologists in normal volunteers and in 40 patients with vascular or neoplastic brain disease. Results: TO measurements demonstrated differences between gray and white matter (2.5-5.4 5). Parametric images using modified analysis techniques demonstrated these differences which were not seen following conventional analysis. Parametric image quality was significantly improved on both TO and TTP in normal volunteers and patients (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Measurements of TO and TTP have been shown to be unique indicators of brain at risk in ischaemic disease.

Methods and Materials: Perfusion imaging was performed in 14 patients with enhancing cerebral tumors. Relaxivity effects were removed by prior administration of Gd DTPA (0.1 mmoI/L). The relative contrast concentration during the re-circulation phase (rR) was estimated as the area between the observed data and the idealized gamma variant model. Estimates of correlation between rCBV and rR were conducted in normal and tumor tissues. Parametric maps of normalised rR (rRlrCBV) were examined. Results: Normal values for rR showed strong correlation with rCBV values in brain and normal vascular structures. Correlation between rCBV and rR was poor in 4/14 tumors. Parametric maps of rR normalised to rCBV confirmed the presence of abnormal areas within these tumors characterized by an inappropriately high values for rR. These areas of abnormality were seen in 1 high grade glioma, 1 meningioma and 1 rapidly progressive acoustic neuroma. Conclusion: Abnormalities of perfusion images are seen in 50me tumors.

Purpose of this study was to assess the feaseability of 30FT-CISS to delineate the membranous labyrinth and the VII and VIII eranial nerves. Four healthy volunteers and 15 patients with hear ing loss, tinn itus and vertigo were examined with a standard head eoil on a 1.5-T MR unit, with T1-weighted before and post contrast medium to determine wich provided the most informat ion. The three-dimensional allowed detailed visualization of all inner ear structures in healty volunteers, and lack of a visible endolymphatie duet and sae in patients with vertigo was helpful to prove a possible inflammatory envolvement of these struetures. Unenhanced T1-weighted images were neeessary to exclude spontaneous hyperintensity in the membranous labyrinth. Post contrast medium images were needed to deteet enhancing pathology such as labyrinthitis and tumor inside the labyr inth. Our results indieate that 30FT-CISS is a valuable diagnostie tool in the evaluation of inner ear anatomy and pathology, and the use of both unenhaneed and enhaneed T1-weighted sequenee formed the best seauenee eombination for diagnosis of membranous labyrinth lesions. Purpose: To test the feasibility of volume rendering (VoIRen) of highresolution magnetie resonanee (HR-MR) data sets of the membranous labyr inth and evaluate the quality of 3D visualisation . Methods and Materials: We retrospeet ively reviewed the HR-MR (Signa 1.5 T; GEMS) data sets of 16 eonsecutive patients with no evidence of labyrinthine pathology. HR-MR data sets were obtained by means of a 30 T2-weighted FSE sequenee with the use of a 3-inch circular surface coil for signal reeeption , and proeessed with the software Advantage Windows 3.1 (GEMS) running on UltraSpare 1 workstation. Two reviewers performed separately VolRen of the labyr inth, then they ranked the quality ofaxial images and 30 views. Results: The interobserver agreement for quality ranks was good in ease ofaxial images (k = 0.57) and excellent in case of VolRen (k = 0.78). The quality ranks agreement was excellent between axial images and VolRen (k =0.86). The interobservers correlation eoeffieient (Spearman rank) for transparency and opaeity values of VolRen was good and statistically significant (Rs > 0.765 ; P < 0.001). Conclusion: VolRen of the labyrinth ls a feasible and reproducible teehnique; it provides reliable 30 visions of the labyrinthine anatomy arid opens potential applications to the study of its pathological ehanges.",

Measurements of the labyr inth and the semilunar eanals were eompared with the anatomie preparat ions . Symptoms in Meniere 's disease are charactherized by hydrops of the endolimphatic system with recurrent rupture of the membranous labyrinth. Primary cause of the increased endolymphatic volume appears to be an unbalanced resorption of endolymph. The aim of this study was to compare the visibility of the endolymphatic duct and sac on high-resolution MR images with the symptoms and clinical course in patients with meniere 's disease . Twenty patients with unilateral Meniere disease were sorted into two groups on the basis of the c1inical stag e of their disease at the time of imaging. Group I included palients in acute phase, who presented vert igo. Group 2 comprised patients in the nonacute phase of the disease, studied 10 days or more after an episode of vertigo. During acute attacks the endolimphatyc duct and sac were not visible in the affected ears, but were visible in the unaffected ear. During remission these structures were not observed in clinically advanced patients, but they were seen in patients in the early and intermediate stages. High-resolution MR imaging can be used to evaluate endolimphatyc duct and sac : visible abnormalities and lack of visible endolimphatyc duct and sac correlate with the c1inical course of the disease.",

In suspected inner ear malformations, the CISS sequence (0.7 mm slice thickness) was used. Additionally, MIPs and reformatted images were obtained. MRI results were compared with HRCT findings . Results: Normal morphology was seen in all tb with normal hearing (8 tb) and in 25 tb with sensorineural hearing loss by CT and MRI. By MRI following inner ear malformations were found: isolated cochlear dysplasia (4 tb), cochlear dysplasia with sem icircular canal dysplasia, enlarged vestibule and enlarg ed endolymphatic duct and sac (4 tb), cochlear dysplasia with semicircular canal dysplasia and enlarged vest ibule (5 tb), cochlear dysplas ia with and enlarged endolymphatic duct and sac (4 tb), isolated semicircular canal dysplasia (7 tb) , isolated enlarged endolymphatic duct and sac (3 tb). No neural abnormalities were found. The diagnosis of an inner ear malformation could be made by CT in all cases, too. Only by MRI loops of the AICA within the inner ear canal were seen (13 tb). Conclusion: MRI will develop to the imaging method of choice in patients with suspected inner ear malformation. Results: The CIEM were class ified equally weil with both modalities, however HR-MRI depicts the malformations more accurate. Especially the abil ity to acquire multi planar reconstructions and 3D images in MIPtechnique was appreciated. MRI detected in 40%(n =6) anomalies of the IAC. In 2 patients one or more nerves failed unilaterally. In 4 patients the extend of the IAC anomalies was more severe on one side. Conclusion: HR-MRI seems to be superior to HR-CT in depicting CIEM. In this population a considerable number of malformations of the IAC was detected by HR-MRI. MRI in children with CIEM might be of importance for surgical management, because it gives addit ional information which can be used to select the side with the best prognos is for cochlear implant.

In 55 of 58 (95%) of the truely proven malignant lymphomas a subclassification was possible on the basis of the core-cut biopsy. Conclusion: Image-guided core-cut biopsy of enlarged lymph nodes is an excellent method allowing diagnosis and subclassification of malignant lymphomas. Surgical Iymph node dissection for diagnostic reasons should be reserved for cases still indetermined after core-cut biopsy or for locations not accessible for percutaneous biopsy.

Methods and Materials: 130 cases of diagnostical biopsies (ehest, abdomen, and spine) and lumbal sympathectomies, 80 cases with laser marker system and 50 without were compared. Results: Using laser marker system target region and parameters of intervention (cutan location, length, and angle) can be planned, exactly demonstrated, and the needle position can be checked during procedure. Therefore the intervention become less dependent of the radiologist's individual experience. Using laser marker system the number of control scans decreased to 30 to 50%, and necessary corrections of needle location were reduced to maximal 30%. The average target deviation of the needle decreased under 5 mm in 50% of cases. The duration of interventional procedure was reduced.

Wilting; HamburglD, Best/NL A navigation support system for CT-guided interventions in radiology is presented which increases the accuracy and efficiency of minimally invasive interventions such as biopsies. The system uses an optical localizer that measures the position of infra-red light sources (LEDs). The CT-scanner, the patient and the interventional tools (e.g. biopsy needles) are equipped with LEDs. During pre-operative imaging the system measures the position of the CT imaging plane and the patient for each scanned slice and registers them in the patient reference coordinate system. In a planing phase the user determines the target and entry point of the intervention in the stack of images. These locations are transformed into the patient reference system and used to guide the radiologist. During the actual intervention the system tracks the position of patient and tool and provides the user with real-time navigation feedback. A graphical tool guides the user towards the planned trajectory. Interactive slice positioning is required for interventional MRI. A navigation system has been developed for the 0.2T Open Viva MRI scanner (Siemens). A stereoscopie infra-red camera monitors the positions of reflective balls on a passive pointing device and on a static reference plate. Complete control of slice positioning is achieved via the pointer and system software to an accurate of within +/-1 mm. Image plane selection can follow orthogonal, single oblique, or double oblique Iines. Images are aligned parallel or perpendicular to the axis of the pointer. Scans are acquired in single or multi-slice modes. Image plane selection is set to monitor the trajectory of a needle as it advances to a target. With fast MRI, the targeting and introduction of devices into lesions is simple and rapid. It is possible to incorporate any pointer shape the pointer into MR-compatible interventional devices (needle guides, biopsy guns), provided that the line of sight is maintained.",

We will present data on the utility of the device compared to iterative conventional scanning. Purpose: Previous Keyhole imaging simulations suggested that improved definition of an interventional device could be achieved by rotating a Keyhole pattern in k-space such that the Keyhole's long axis lies perpendicular to the device arientation. This study sought to validate these predictions with in-vltro and ln-vive trials. Methods and Materials: A True-FISP keyhole sequence was modified to rotate k-space from a conventional k-space orientation. An initial 256x256 data set was acquired, but all subsequent keyhole scans were limited to the center 64 rows. Four sets of images were acquired with this sequence during in-vitro or in-vivo procedures involving insertion of an interventional device into a phantom or pereine Iiver. Device insertion was parallel to the rotated readout axis and then parallel to the rotated phase encode axis for each subject. The images were acquired and reconstructed on-line at about 3 images/second. They were evaluated for spatial resolution and utility in c1inical applications. Results: The image studies with the device oriented perpendicularly to the Keyhole stripes led to more accurate reconstructions \u00ab2 mm spatial error), and mare highly rated image quality by I-MRI clinicians. Conelusion: Rotation of a Keyhole pattern to match the device gives improved image quality over conventional Keyhole acquisitions while maintaining the improvement in acquisition speed. is a considerable problem, especially in patients with vessel elonga-tion.

Conclusion: Our study provides a basic structure to help us understand many of the anxieties found in oncology patients. Optimal care for these patients goes beyond the techn ical to emotional support. Methods and Materials: In a samplte (n =566) we measured WT spent in the waiting room from moment of arrival until beginning of the examination (Time 1) and from end of examination until leaving the department (Time 2). The patient was also asked to complete a questionnaire regarding satisfaction with the services. Times were measured by using an individual chart and a time clock, Results: The median (Time 1) was 14 minutes; for 20% of the patients Time 1 exceeded 30 minutes. The median Time 2 was 19 minutes. Patients state they expect a Time 1 of maximum 16 minutes. More than 75% of the patients expressed a feeling of short waiting times in our department. We found a linear relationship between objectively measured waiting times and subjective waiting times as perceived by the patient. Conclusion: The method has proven to be reliable and useful for future monitoring of WT. Objective measured waiting times correlate closely with patients' perception of WT. WT monitoring is necessary in order to increase service levels of the radiology department. Purpose: Analysis of rejected films in a large, central radiological department under the following aspects: What is the reject-film -rate before and after intensive lecturing ? Where are the sources of error? Methods and Materials: Over 9 months, separated in 3 quarters, 7238 mistaken films were analysed and sorted to regions of the body, subdivided in columns \"Positioning\", \"Exposure\" und \"due to the patient\". Based on these results all radiographers and radiologists of the department took part in lectures on \"Anatomy\", \"Positioning\" and \"What are the clinical questions\" for one week (= 5 hours), about regions with the highest reject-fiIm-rate (\"hips\", \"shoulder\"). Results: In the regions \"Hips\" (20.6% mistaken films) and \"Shoulder\" (13.0% mistaken films) the rejected films increased after lecturing up to 23.9 respectively 17.5%. After one year the reject-film-rate decreased to the original level. Conclusion: Traditional training , in form of lectures, does not reduce the number of mistaken films; on the contrary the rate is increasing. One reason is probably the more critically attitude towards the taken pictures. More practical teaching in small groups on \"Anatomy\" and \"Posilioning\" is presumed to show better results.",

The true reject rate does not include films discarded which did not contr ibute to an increase in the patient's radiation dose, i.e. copied and manipulated films, or technical rejects, i.e. fogged, test and blank films. The anatomical area with the highest rejection rate is analysed in depth to identify problems that could be eliminated. Results: The true reject rate is routinely between 2.5% to 2.75% of total film usage. The number of technical rejects reduced as equipment faults were readily identified and rectified. The anatomical area analysis identified areas for re-education and/or revision of techniques. Conclusion: Rejected films, although costly, are unavoidable.

In computed radiology, using a storage phosphor system (SPS), this range is much wider and the image quality increases using higher radiation doses. This is important in the train ing of radiographers and the organization of the department when introducing this system. Methods and Materials: When the new SPS was introduced in our hospital, radiographers were instructed to use the same settings as with the old conventional radiology system. This ensured good quality computed radiology, with a comparable patient dose. Results: After a while radiographers tend to pay less attent ion to radiation dose since there is no immediate unsatisfactory effecl on the produced images. Therefore continuing training of radiographers is necessary to keep the doses used within the planned range, and to raise their awareness of the problem. A build-in dose monitoring system in the SPS is also indispensable . Conclusion: The introduction of the SPS in our service was very weil received with all radiographers , radiologists and referring physicians. The awareness of radiation dose with the radiographers tends to diminish after time. Therefore continuing education and a build-in control system is imperative.",

Methods and Materials: The complex detection process is described by a set of simple main processes: I.absor ption of the x-ray quantum , 11. \u2022 creation of excitations , 111 . \u2022 transport of excitations to the surface, IV. -storage and readout of the charge carriers.",

Conclusion: At a first glance, the electro-direct approach might appear advantageous because of the inherent simplicity. But looking at the currentiy available absorber materials and typical applications, it becomes understandable , why the photo-direct approch is the mainstream solution.

Although no patient died as a result of not having CT, lack of CT contributed to delay in diagnosis. CT was performed both in supine and in prone position, but also scans in oblique position were useful as required by neoplasm location. Contiguous 5 mm slices from public synphysis to iliae crestae are performed (with multiplanar reconstruetion) , before and after nonionic iodate contrast agent (ca) i.v, injection (80 ce). After ca inject ion it was useful to start CT from bladder f100r to dome in order to avoid artifacts due to concent rated ca into the bladder. Results: DCBCT was well-tolerated and allowed an accurate study of the implant base of sessile and pedunculate neoplasms , as dernonstrated by comparison to endoscopy and surgery. A good evaluation of perivescical fat tissue infiltration was also possible, with diagnost ie accuracy values in accordance to literature. Conclusion: In the study of bladder neoplasms, DCBCT is a valuable diagnostic method because of aceurate spatial balance, both in endoluminal and in perivisceral evaluation and seems to be advisable also as the first step for its less invasivity in comparison to cystoscopy. Purpose: To evaluate the implementation of a radiographer based reporting service for trauma examinations of the musculo-skeletal system at five sites within four UK hospitals. Methods and Materials: A longitudinal study design was adopted to measure the produetivity and effectiveness of radiograph ie reporting. Accuraey of radiographers ' reports ; volume of reporting activity; the speed with which the report became available, and the satisfaction of users of the radiograph ie reporting serv ice were measured before and after implementation of a radiographic reporting service. Results: Accuraey of radiographers reports was found to be high (early results suggest as high as 99% aecuracy). Volume of reporting activity increased substantially where this had been low (early results show >20% improvement). Reports became available more quickly (early results show mean improvement >30% for reports becoming available in fewer than 5 days; percentage of reports available on the same day of examination improved from 1%-2% pre-implementation to 10-35% post-implementation). Satisfaetion of users data is awaiting analysis . Purpose: To estimate the role of scanner-dependent effects on MR relaxation rate measurements and to evaluate their influence on the MR-signal intensity of normal brain. Methods and Materials: A phantom composed of 2 tubes of 2.5 cm of diameter filled with a manganese sulphate solution were placed inside the brain coil and was scanned 62 times over 10 months. Twentytwo normal subjects were studied over the same period. Two spinecho sequences (1.5 T, 2300/15/90 and 600/15 TRITE) were used to calculate relaxation rates of both phantom compartments and normal brain tissues (JMRI 1995: 5; 217-225) . Coefficient of variation (CV) and standard deviation (SO) were used for data comparison. Results: Phantom mean R1 and R2 values were in the range measured in normal brain (R1 =1.326 sec\"; R2 =12.40 sec:\"). R1 SO and CV (0.157sec-1 and 11.9%) were significantly higher than those found for R2 (0.39 sec\" and 3.2%). Comparative analysis of phantom and normal brain relaxation times showed concomitant changes occurring in simultaneous acquisitions of phantom and human brain. Conclusion: Our data support the routine use of a phantom to correct relaxation rate estimates in MR studies.",

Sato; Tokyo/J Purpose: Recently, virtual endoscopy has been developed to depict luminal appearance of the alimentary tract or blood vessels without invasiveness to patients. However, this application only uses the data around a threshold at the sacrifice of the other three dimensional data. We've developed a new endoscopic software application, called \"Computed Sectional Probe\" (CSP), to show the information from inside, and around the lumen simultaneously. Methods and Materials: A virtual probe with variable diameter and depth is prepared in the virtual endoscopic navigator application. It is laid on the surface of the lumen and makes a column. The column is transparent so that the bottom plane can be seen. Therefore, the image is a combination of a 2D multiplaner reconstruction image on bottom plane and 3D endoscopic image. The border line can be moved by shifting the threshold. Additionally, three reference planes orthogonal to the direction of \"f1ight\" are displayed and are updated synchronously. Results: In application to gastric, colon, and bronchogenic carcinoma, this method provided visualization of abnormalities outside the lumen as weil as the surface appearance without increasing computing time. This information was very useful in evaluating the extent and staging of cancer. Conelusion: Newly developed CSP was effective and robust enough to provide more clinical benefit than the previous navigator system.

The system included TC scanner, MR scanner, film devices, processing and visualization stations (PCs, UNIX workstations and X-terminals) and DICOM servers (PCs, UNIX workstations) of the departments of Radiology, Radiotherapy and Medical Physics of the Azienda Ospedaliera di Perugia, Italy. Results and Conelusion: We designed a procedure to validate all levels of the DICOM network before the connection is declared operational for clinical use. For this purpose we tested the complete range of possible interactions between the devices and belween the application using DICOM data. The acceptance procedures revealed a number of problems that were not noticed at casual inspection. There were problems both in the hardware and in the software configuration due to improper initial settings which were fixed. Purpose: To investigate the potential of high-resolution MR imaging for the delineation and assessment of different brain lesions. Methods and Materials: High-resolution T2*-weighted, low-bandwidth, single-echo brain images were acquired with a 3D, rf-spoiled, gradientecho sequence (TRlTE/aITH =58/40125/2, FOV =240-256,320 x 512 matrix, 32 partitions) in a 1.5 T scanner. CerebraI venograms were created from the magnitude and phase data by performing a minimum intensity projection over targeted volumes. Pre-and post-contrast 3D T1-weighted images were additionally acquired with the same in-plane resolution and orientation (TRITE/alTH =20/4.76125/2, FOV = 240-256, 320 x 512 matrix, 36 partitions). In an ongoing study the sequences were applied in 10 patients with different intracranial lesions, such as tumors, metastases, and AVMs. Results: Additional diagnostic information was obtained from the 3D T1-weighted data sets without altering the c1inical protocol. Subtraction of the pre-and post-contrast partitions and performing a MIP yielded highly detailed images of the cerebral vascular system around the lesions. In combination with the MR venography it is possible to obtain information about arterial and venous vessels and to differentiate between feeding and draining vessels of brain lesions. Conclusion: High-resolution imaging appears very promising for an improved delineation of cerebral brain lesions. Purpose: To evaluate imaging characteristics of a new T2-weighted turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence with inherent sensitivity to susceptibiliy artifacts. Methods and Materials: In order to improve the detection of hemosiderine in T2-TSE-imaging, sensitivity to susceptibility artifacts of a standard T2-TSE sequence was improved by increasing selectively the first (contrast-determining) TE. For 10 patients with multiple intracranial deposits of hemosiderine, this sequece was compared to the standard T2-TSE-and T2*-sequences, especially the number of hemosiderine-deposits was counted. Results: The new sequence detected markedly more deposits of hemosiderine than standard T2-TSE-imaging, but significantly less than T2*-imaging with the only exception of the skull base (proximity to the paranasal sinuses). Fat signal was lower than in T2-TSE, the number and of flow artifacts increased. Contrast-resolution did not differ much from standard T2-TSE. Conclusion: As the new sequence detects c1early more hemosiderinedeposits than standard T2-TSE-imaging and shows a more T2-SE contrast charcteristic and a sirnilar spatial resolution, it can be used instead of a standard T2-TSE sequence. However, it can not can not replace T2*-imaging except for the skull base. Purpose: Evaluation of the changes of the retrobulbic fat body, the extraoccular muscles of the eye and the optic nerve before and after radiation therapy of endocrine orbitopathy using high resolution MRI. Methods and Materials: 10 patients with c1inical and c1inical chemistry tested endocrine orbitopathy (age range 35-76 years) were investigated with high resolution MRI (Magnetom Vision, Siemens, Germany) before and after retro-orbital radiation therapy (6 MeV linear accelerator, 16 Gy, 2 Gy/d). The MRI protocol included T2-, proton-density and T1weighted high resolution (matrix 512) turbo spin-echo imaging in axial and coronal orientation and 3D MPRAGE imaging. Follow-up MRI was performed 1 month and 12 rnonths \u00b1 2 months after radiation therapy.",

To the unwary observer they present a bewildering spectrum of radiographie appearances that can lead to misinterpretation and suboptimal management. Although primary malignancies of bone are relatively rare they frequently pose an intriguing problem for the radiologist as the pathology is often equally challenging. Oespite recent major advances in musculoskeletal imaging the corner-stone of the radiological diagnosis remains the humble radiograph. This presentation will revisit the fundamentals of radiographie interpretation of bone lesions. Likening the search for the diagnosis to a detective story, an ordered approach to radiographie interpretation (pattern analysis) will be stressed rather than the frequently employed pattern recognition (\"Aunt Minnie\" approach). The salient features of bone destruction, periosteal new bone formation and matrix mineralization will be reviewed. Purpose: The insula is a distinct lobe, first described by Reil in 1809. Glassically, the insula is divided by the central sulcus of the insula (GSI) in an anterior precentral (three short gyri) and a posterior postcentral (two long gyri) part. The purpose of our study was to describe the anatomie characterstics of the insula using MRI. Methods and Materials: Using MPRAGE sequences, we examined 20 hemispheres of 10 volunteers. The number of identified gyri related to the insula were determined in the sagittal and transverse plane. Furthermore, the direction of the GSI with respect to the central sulcus was evaluated. Results: We always identified two postcentral gyri. Precentrally, we found three gyri in 50%, two in 25% and four in 25%. In the transverse plane, we counted 4 gyri in 65%, 5 gyri in 25% and 6 gyri in 10% of the examined hemispheres. The fifth gyrus was usually only identified on the inferior slices. The GSI was always identified in the sagittal plane by its depth and its oblique course. It was directed towards the central sulcus in 20%. Conelusion: The detailed description of the insula allows accurate identification of tumor extension and is aprerequisite for precise localization of function when using fMRI.",

Methods and Materials: A total of 26 volunteers underwent 30FT-GISS sequence MRI and 10 also underwent MR angiography to identify the facial colliculus, N VI and its apparent origin, Oorello's canal, and the AIGA. Results: We identified N VI with certainty in 96% of 30FT-GISS sequences obtained in the axial and sagittal planes and in 94% obtained in the coronal plane. The nerve emerged from the pontomedullary sulcus in 94% of cases. The facial colliculus could always be identified and Oorello's canal was identified in 94% of cases. In 76.6% of cases the abducens nerve was seen to contact the AIGA, which passed anterior to the nerve in 63.8% of cases and posterior in 29.8%. Conclusion: The abducens nerve and its relationship to the AIGA and other blood vessels can be reliably identified using a 30FT-GISS sequence and the facial colliculus and Oorello's canal as landmarks.",

These include the latest real-time aequisition methods to image moving organs sueh as the heart. Furthermore ultrasound techniques are presented to visualise 3-D colour blood flow and to obtain intravascular results. Since 3-D ultrasound is particularly used in echography of heart and vessels, clinical examples of cardiac 3-D imaging will be given. II will be explained that 3-D echoeardiography provides the c1inician with more confidence for the diagnosis of cardiac diseases and adds insights to the understanding of eomplex pathology. The availability of a 3-D data set allows the cardiologist to retrieve an infinite number of different views after the examination procedure. Unique cross-sections, difficult or impossible to obtain from standard acoustie windows, can be viewed. This increases the diagnostic power of the echo study. To reeonstruet an organ in its true anatomie dimensions, sequential acquisition of all eross-seetional planes encompassing te entire organ is necessary. Scanning methods include parallel slicing; pivoting orfan-Iike seanning or the stepwise rotational image aequisition every few degrees as ean be performed with multiplane probes. For moving organs such as the heart, triggering is required. New developments inelude fast volumetrie seanning by eleetronie as weil as by mechanical means. The electronic method is based on the mosaie transdueer principle combined with parallel processing of sound In this early era of virtual imaging we are beginning to see interactive 3D imaging also applied within the gastrointestinal tract. Although this technique already seems to be applicable to hollow organs like the colon and stomach we would like to point out a few caveats for its use; it is not Iikely to replace barium radiology for the radiologieal work-up of several groups of palients such as those with symptoms that may indicate abnormal function of the swallowing apparatus and/or colon and rectum. The diagnostic work up of patients with dysphagia or an anoreetaJ problem will rely on properly performed barium studies if neeessarily combined with simultaneous manometry. On the other hand, dedicated barium studies will still have an edge over more static virtual imaging techniques for the demonstration of structural anomalies or lesions smalI, complexe or specific Iike diverticles, hiatus hernia, stenosis and rings..., for lesions unsufficiently or not demonstrated by endoscopic studies, and for post-operative studies. However virtual imaging will take over some of the today indications of barium studies, the laller being practised more and more by subspecialised.",

Regions of interest can be extracted from the data set and structures of interest removed from their surroundings for detailed analysis. Surgeons will have greater insight into what will be found during operational procedures combined with additional functional details. This information is already of particular help in mitral valve and congenital defect repair. Accurate quantitative data together with new parameters will provide additional information and allow to address new c1in ical questions. For these reasons, three-dimensional echocardiography will be an essential part of the future of the clinical practice of cardiology and examinations will be performed with computer controlled transducer systems and standardized for specific cardiac conditions.

            "text": "In the last two years important technical improvement in 3D ultrasound color flow imaging occurred. In particular, new acquisition modalities, faster reconstruction algorithms and better display techniques are now available. The number of scanners commercially available on the market with the possibility of 3D flow imaging (3DFI) is constanlly increasing. This trend shows that 3DFI is not only a useful tool of the ultrasound scanner but it is beeoming areal new methodology and imaging technique. 3DFI improves the possibility of understanding the geometry and the emodynamics of blood flow. From a physical point of view, it gives us the possibility of a multi planar reconstruction, higher sensitivity, higher color spatial resolution, a redueed operator dependence. From a c1inical point of view it is possible to study and monitor the 3D local blood flow and velocity over the whole vessel; it is now possible to displaya coronal plane, there is an improved detectability of small vessel structure, there is an improved accuracy in velocity distribution measurement; 3DFI adds spatial information in complex geometry, improves reproducibility in sequential exams, gives an easier understanding of complex patient anatomy for primary care physicians, gives addition of information not previously available such as changes in velocity near the vessel wall and shear stress and improves accuracy in volume measurements. Some interesting technical innovations are pointed out: contrast harmonie imaging, tissue or native harmonie imaging, Doppler 3D tissue imaging, 1.5D and 2D array technology. The possibility of acquiring a volume allows the \"fusion\" with images coming fram other modalities. In order to do that it is necessary to export basic data from the US scanner in standard format (DICOM 3.0). Problems of connectivity deriving from this application will be discussed. Results obtained with a particular phantom using 3DFI and a CT scanner and some personal experience with 3DFI will be presented. 561 Technical possibilities of color flow imaging R. Novario; Varese/I Three-dimensional imaging constitutes a major research goal, since correct spatial structure information would help one to overcome the difficult process of mental conceptualization of cardiac structures, pathology of unknown morphology and complex geometry from crosssectional images. Several directions have been followed in threedimensional echocardiography. Undoubtedly, the most challenging direction is real-time threedimensional echocardiography. At present, however, most clinical experienee is with software controlled meehanical acquisition of a consecutive series of cardiac crosssectional images using currently available standard transducers and retrospeetive computer assisted \"off-line\" three-dimensional reconstruction. Recenlly, an ultrafast continuously rotating phased-array transdueer which allows the acquisition of 16 volumetrie data sets per seeond has been developed. Standard imaging processing equipment is used for reconstruction. This near real-time approach may become an alternative to real-time volumetrie imaging systems in specific clinieal conditions.

A brief descnptlo~of t~e organisation of coronary interventional work at~he Uppsala University Hospital will be given together with a personal vlew~f why we feel It IS important for the rest of radiology that radioloqists still do PTCA. Early detection of breast cancer with high quality mammography is thm ost effective means of reducing death from this disease. A cornbination of superb image quality and undertsanding the heterogeneous and progressive nature of breast cancer is essential to optimize the potential of modern mammography. To be effective, the mammogrpaher will have to find the potentially fatal cancers in their preclinical detectable phase. Included in this category are the grade 3/poorly differentiated, rapidly growing tumors, as weil as those that have the potential to dedifferentiate. The heterogeneity can cause considerable difficulty for the radiologist. To add to this difficulty, the earlier the cancer is detected, the more nonspecific the mammographic appearance may be. The outcome of 2,500 women with breast cancer diagnosed in a randomized controlled screening trial and followed for an average of 18 years serves the basis for this presentation. An understanding of the underlying histopathology, its reflection on the mammogram and the capabilities and limitations of modern mammography combined with the knowledge about outcome differences by subtypes will provide the radiologist with the tools for effective disease control. 568 B. What is the real benefit? P.\u00df. Dean; TurkulF/N There are important confounding effects which will decrease the measured effect of mammography screening without decreasing its true impact. The measured effect of a 30% reduction in mortality teils us only part of the effect of mammography screening, as the true effect has been watered down by non-participation of the invited women and mammography of the non-invited wamen, termed \"contamination\". The mortality reduction in the \"ever-screened\" versus the \"neverscreened\" women in a screening trial. This will give a mortality reduction of more than 40%, although there is a self-selection bias in these numbers. The message is still c1ear: those women who attend mammography screening have nearly half the mortality from breast cancer than do those women who do not attend. These concepts will be iIIustrated with data from the Swedish Two-County screening program. Those cancers which have already grown to palpable size when the screening program begins will no longer be detected at an early stage by mammography; indeed many of the deaths in women invited to screening come from large cancers detected at screening. It is a common observation that women with a breast tumor will often delay seeking medical advice, but will respond to a screening invitation. Additionally, the absolute benefit of a screening program in the number of lives saved will continue to grow for many years after the trial has ended. Difficult as it is to demonstrate the true benefits of screening, it should be no surprise that a poorly conducted trial will have difficulty in demonstrating any benefit at all. Mortality reduction means reducing the actual number of deaths from breast cancer in a population, so that more women with breast cancer may survive it, and live longer until they eventually die from .anoth~r disease. Measuring survival of women who already have the diaqnosis of breast cancer does not tell us whether any deaths have been prevented; only mortality measurements can accomplish that. Since surgical, radio-and chemotherapy of breast cancer are given only to women with breast cancer and not to any population of normal women, these methods cannot be proven to have affected mortality from breast cancer. The real benefit from mammography screening is that it is the only method which has been proved to prevent death from breast cancer.",

            "text": "There is a rather general consensus about the value of screening in women above 50 years of age, whice screening in the age group 40-49 is still controversial due to the low rate of mammographically demonstrable cancers and the high rate of recalls for supplementary mammography, c1inical examinations and biopsies in relation to cancers found. Although many programs recommend annual mamograms in elegible women the good screening interval for breast cancers also needs to be defined. Understanding these screening controversies requires an understanding of the principle of screening for disease, the epidemiology of breast cancer and the results of the many randomized clinical trials. A prime indication for imaging in neuro-ophthalmology is visual loss. Effective imaging must be tailored to the clinical pattern of visual loss. For presumed ocular causes, sonography is the investigation of choice, followed in some cases by MRI. Optic nerve lesions can sometimes be localised c1inically to the intraocular, intraorbital, intracanalicular or intracranial portions of the nerve. C'T and/or MRI may be combined to clarify the nature and extent of involvement. When optic neuropathy is part of a more generalised disorder, such as multiple sclerosis, wider imaging of the CNS may be necessary.

In CAP, most individuals are infected through person-to-person transmission of microorganisms bound to or suspended in water-mucus droplets. In contrast, NP is more frequently the result of an intraindividual process, triggered by aspiraton of gastric contents or contaminated oropharyngeal secretions. Infections in CAP are commonly caused by gram-positive and atypical bacteria as weil as viruses. The pathogens causing NP include aerobic gram-negative organisms and Staphy/ocaccus aureus. Viruses, protozoa and funghi play an increasing role in patients with impaired defense mechanisms. In CAP and NP, the typical radiologie findings include lobar pneumonia, bronchopneumonia (Iobular pneumonia) and diffuse bilateral interstitial disease. Nodules may be seen in fungal pneumonia.

The main plane is transverse or horizontal showing in 90% of the cases a longitudinal extralabyrinthine fracture with an entrance in the pars squamosa or mastoid. The labyrinthine lesions are transverse originating in the occipital bone. The incus is usually damaged in the long process with or without dislocations. The stapes may be involved with vestibular luxation, fracture of the footplate and/or lesions of the annular ligament. CT mayaiso be performed in the detection of traumatic labyrinthine fistula particularly through the oval and round windows. In case of post-traumatic nerve paralysis, a hematoma in the course of the nerve can be detected on MR and the damaged nerve segment is sometimes seen as a thickened enhancing region. More over only MR can show the proximal and/or distal extend of the nerve oedema, showing the surgeon that the decompression should be wider. MR can also help in the differentiation between an encephalocele and other tissue or fluid when a tegmen fracture occurs. MR is also the only technique able to demonstrate intralabyrinthine hemorrhage (on unenhanced T1weighted images) or fibrosis (on gradient-echo images) in case of labyrinthine concussion. The inflammatory changes developing during the days following the occurrence of a perilymph fistula can sometimes be recognized as an intralabyrinthine enhancement on MR. Finally MR is the method of choice to look for contusions or hemorrhages in the brain tissue surrounding the temporal bone and in the important structures of the auditory and vestibular pathways. With the availability of 3D data sets in CT, MRI, and PET methods of perspective 3D visualization have become possible.. The most informative visualization is achieved by volume visualisation for which the authors group has done pioneering work. These techniques are explained and examples of applications in diagnostic radiology, surgical plannung and education in radiological anatomy are shown. For the latter 3D interactive atlases like the VOXEL-MAN system have been created. 3D models of different parts of the body may be explored by rotation, dissection, lookthrough. As a specialty cross-sectional and radiographie imaging may be simulated in the context of 3D anatomy. Information about the visible objects may be called from a knowledge base. However, even on a high end workstation, high quality visualisation is still too time consuming and interaction too complicated when sophisticated tools like dissection are used. We hence developed a new feature allowing to create simpler derivatives of the model, called \"intelligent movies\". Thus, an expert (radiologist, anatomist) can emphasize certain aspects by creating corresponding scenes as intelligent movies, which a user (referring physician, student) can explore interactively on a PC. 575 B. Atlas-based stereotactic neurosurgery: from the clinical CD-ROM to virtual reality BrainBench w.L. Nowinski; SingaporelSGP Deformable brain atlases along with fast warping are powerful tools for quantitative analysis of brain images, particularly for segmentation, labeling, targeting, and multi-modal registration. We have constructed the brain atlas database [1] with c1assic Thieme atlases: Schaltenbrand-Wahren, Talairach-Tournoux, Referentially Oriented Talairach-Tournoux, and Ono-Kubik-Abernathey. These atlases are fully segmented and labeled, mutually coregistered, and their 3D extensions are built. The anatomical index has about 1000 structures and 400 sulcal patterns. NeuroFamily is a suite of atlas-based applications for neurosurgery, neuroradiology, neuroeducation and neurosciences. The Electronic Clinical Brain Atlas CD-ROM [2] \"is a truly unique accomplishment that marks a new stage in clinical neuroanatomy\" [see Surgical Neurology, 1998; 49; 114-5] . It integrates severallandmark atlases and MR scans into a multi-purpose, multi-dimensional, multi-platform interactive clinical tool with 17,000 structures labeled on 1,500 atlas images. With its unique real-time scaling of images, it greatly facilitates the correlation of specific anatomical structures from the atlas to actual patient's scans. NeuroPlanner, a system for functional neurosurgery [3], supports preoperative planning, intraoperative procedures, and postoperative analysis of data. Preoperative planning includes registration, target definition and trajectory planning. A 3D display of cerebral structures along with stereotactic trajectories and simulated therapeutic lesions allows for a better understanding of spatial relationships and facilitates surgery planning. The Brain Bench is virtual reality stereotaxis for fast neurosurgery planning and training [4] . It integrates 3D brain atlas, geometrie models of stereotactic frames, neurosurgical tools, and 3D reach-in, two-hand manipulation. The user's left hand controls the entire displayed complex containing the patient's data, individualized 3D atlas, and stereotactic frame fixed to the patient's head. This complex can be turned and placed as one does an object held in the hand. The right hand performs detailed manipulation using 3D widgets to interact with the surgical planning tools and patient's data. ",

Furthermore we will show how oceluded endoscopically placed plaslic stents are removed, and the dilation of benign biliary strictures. In the summary the results of the treatment of benign biliary disease will be discussed. Self-expandable metallic biliary stents combine the advantage of a small track through the liver and a large lumen which is less Iikely to become occluded by encrusted bile. Occlusion by bile encrustation is unusual but approximately 10% of stents become oceluded by tumour overgrowth or ingrowth. In most cases it is possible to recanalise the stent by inserting a second endoprosthesis coaxially within the first. In patients with low or mid-common bile duct obstruction a single metallic stent is used. In hilar lesions involving the left and right hepatic ducts bilateral parallel stents are inserted, extending into the duodenum, in order to provide optimum palliation and minimise the risk of cholangitis Studies comparing plastic endoprostheses with metallic stents have shown that the lalter are associated with a lower incidence of cornplications such as infection and haemorrhage and with a significantly lower rate of reintervention.",

Representative pediatric spinal MRstudies will be presented in their elinical context using basic principles and interactive neurosurgical -neuroradiological discussion. Embryologie, anatomie and biomechanical principles are the basis on which to build an useful imaging study. In the newborn, infant and young child the spinal column is -for instance -much more flexible (compliant) when \"stretched\" than the spinal cord as compared to the spine of an adult. This leads to traumatic (birth-related or accidental) spinal cord injuries without detectable radiographie abnormalities (SCIWORA). Adequate elasticity response to physiological strain (Le. bending) is the hallmark of the normal filum terminale. Failure of this simple mechanism due to abnormal structure, lipoma, tumor, scar, adhesion or split cord of fast MRI techniques for a refined examination of the brain and their profound contribution to basic neuroimaging reseach will be covered. Special attention will be given to the advantages, draw backs and limitations of the different fast MRI techniques in comparison to the normal spin echo performance.

This in turn gives rise to symptoms and signs of lower leg weakness and decreasing sensibility, bladder dysfunction and incontinence. Closure of neural plate is proceeding from \"head to tail\" but has also a segmental component. A myelomenigocele might therefore coexist with a split cord malformation which is not uncommonly overlooked. What does the pediatric neurosurgeon want to know from MRI? Examples for questions are: Where is the lesion in precise relationship to numbered vertebral bodies, pedicles and arches? Is the lesion epidural, subdural extramedullary or intramedullary? Is there a perilesional reaction/ edema/ gliosis? Is lt possible to distinguish between the lesion and the perilesional changes? Is there more than one lesion? Is there hydrosyringomyelia? Where is the position of the conus medullaris? How wide is the spinal canal? What is the precise relationship between alesion and the spinal nerve roots/nerves? Does a space-occupying lesion arise from defined structures (bone?). MRI of the spinal canal should primarily rely on the little artifact -much resolution and contrast principle. The single most helpful standard technique for MRI of the spinal canal in infants and children are in our experience 2 mm Turbo-Spin-Echo-sequences in sagittal (T1 + T2-weighted) and transverse (T2-weighted) planes. We use a 512 Matrix in the frequency direction and no interslice gap. Transverse images are 5 mm for \"survey\" and 2 mm in regions of interest. Other techniques such as T1SE-fat saturation, STIR, FLAIR, gradient-echo-volume aquisition/CISS, MRA and the application of contrast are based on individual decisions. Standard MRI measurement sequences for clinical examinations are spin echo sequences, which needs several minutes for the data acquisition. For faster data acquisition, a variety of fast imaging techniques are available, which include gradient echo sequences, turbo spin echo sequences, echo planar sequences and a lot of combinations of these techniques. Different magnetization preparation techniques can be used prior to the imaging sequences in order to modify the image contrast. All fast imaging techniques can be described by the obtainable spatial resolution, the image contrast for selected tissues and the sensitivity to additional parameters like f1ow, chemical shift and field inhomogeneities. The lecture will give an overview of the imaging techniques, their physical principles and their features and constraints. Helpful tools for the characterization of sequences are the k-space description of data acquisition and the course of longitudinal and transversal magnetization during the measurement. These tools will be described and applied to the different imaging techniques.",

Purpose: To assess the value of 'pouehography' and CT sean in the postsurgieal evaluation following total proctoeoleetomy with i1eoanal pouch . To assess the value of transana l drainage by lamel to prevent leakage of sutures and subsequent abscess formation . Methods and Materials: Between 1985 and 199830 patients underwent total proctocolectomy, endorectal pull-through of an ileal pouch , and temporary diverling loop ileostomy for ulcerative colitis or familial polyposis coli, At surgery, a transabdominal drainage was performed in all patients. The last 5 patients underwent additional transanal drainage to protect sutures . CT scan was performed when pelvic abscess was suspected. 'Pouchography' was performed three monts after surgery and/or before closure of the diverting i1eostomy to assess continence, integrity of the i1eoanal anastomosis and ileal pouch anatomy. 'Pouchography' was done by injection of water soluble contrast agent into the efferent ileal loop. Results: In six patients surgery was complicated by abscess formation . In four of them a persisting fistula was seen on antegrade pouchography performed several months later. In total eight fistulae were diagnosed , seven on antegrade pouchography, one on fistulography. In one patient massive pulmonary embol ism and shock resulted in severe bowel ischemia. Two patients developed small-bowel obstruction as a consequence of intraperitoneal adhesions. Two patients developed a reservoir outlet obstruction due to anal stenosis. One of them had an associated persisting large perianal fistula. One patient developed fecal ineontinence, requiring a permanent i1eostomy. In the patients with transanal drainage , no abseess format ion was seen . In one patient CT scan was performed beeause of loss of purulent material via transanal lame l. CT scan showed only mild inflammation adjacenl to the poueh wilhout abscess formation.

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to define the role of focused computed tomography (CT) in adult patients with suspected acute appendicitis and to determine the effect of CT on the treatment of such patients. Methods and Materials: Appendiceal CT was performed in 120 consecutive patients with acute appendicitis in the differential diagnosis, whose clinical findings were insufficient to perform surgery or to discharge from the hospital. Each scan was obtained in a single breath-hold from the lower abdomen to the upper pelvis using a 5-mm collimation and a pitch of 1.6. No patients were given oral or intravenous contrast media. CT results were correlated with surgical and pathologie findings at appendectomy or clinical follow-up. Results: 88 of the 93 patients with acute appendicitis were correctly diagnosed by CT, 24 of the 27 patients without acute appendicitis were correctly diagnosed by CT (95% sensitivity, 89% specificity). CT signs of acute appendicitis included fat stranding (100%), enlarged appendix (>6 mm) (97%), adenopathy (63%), appendicoliths (43%), abscess (10%), and phlegmon (5%). Conclusion: An enlarged appendix with periappendiceal fat stranding is by far the most common CT finding in acute appendicitis. The use of spiral CT in patients with equivocal c1inical presentation suspected of having acute appendicitis led to a significant improvement in the preoperative diagnosis and a lower negative appendectomy rate. Routine use of focused appendiceal CT may lower the costs of caring for patients with c1inically suspected appendicitis. (239) and of patients with right lower quadrant pain without acute appendicitis (138) and acute inflamed appendices (80) were prospectively evaluated with ultrasound for intraluminal gas. Results: Appendices of asymptomatic patients showed gas in 86% (206) and 14% (33) did not. Appendices of symptomatic patients without acute appendicitis presented with gas in 79% (109) and without in 21% (29). Acute inflamed appendices showed gas in 15% (12) and 85% (68) did not. The absence of gas as a criterion for acute appendicitis has a sensitivity of 85%, a specificity of 79%, a positive and negative predictive value of 57% and 94% and an accuracy of 81%. Gas was useful to rule out acute appendicitis in 46% (64) of our symptomatic patients because established criteria were misleading. In 24% (19 patients) the absence of gas was useful to diagnose acute appendicitis because other criteria were not present in a convincing manner. Conclusion: The presence or absence of gas in the appendix are useful additional sonographie signs especially in cases where established criteria for acute appendicitis are not sufficiently present or misleading.",

Methods and Materials: In 100 patients the visibility ofthe appendix, its AP outer diameter during compression (00), the maximal wall thickness (MWT) and the presence of colour Doppler (CD) signs were recorded. The findings were compared to histology in all operated cases (38) otherwise a 2 weeks c1inical follow up was made. Results: The appendix was visualised in all pathologically positive cases and in 82.5% of the normal appendices (18.7% partly, 63.8% in whole length). Using 00 >6 mm as the sonographie criteria of appendicitis resulted in unnecessarily operated false positive cases (100% sensitivity, 91.3% specificity). The false positive rate decreased, but the sensitivity also, if using MWT >3 mm as the diagnostic criteria (90% sensitivity, 97.5% specificity). Adding CD improved specificity, but decreased sensitivity in both methods. Conclusion: The normal appendix can be detected more frequently by sonography than reported previously. Whole length demonstration of an appendix, smaller than 6 mm in 00 is 100% specific for anormal appendix. This sign might prevent from unnecessary laparotomies in c1inically doubtful cases.",

Interpretative criteria apply to the breast tissue structure, weil circumscribed and ill-defined masses, spiculated masses and stellate lesions, microcalcifications and asymmetries. Breast parenchymal pattern can be categorised from 1 to 4 in order to describe the accuracy and reliability of the lesion detection. Weil circumscribed masses, except those containing fat or typical calcifications, need correct management to be categorised: Spot compression magnification views to better visualise the contour and ultrasound to establish or exclude a simple cyst. Generally a conservative approach is recommended because of the very low ppv of these lesions. III-defined masses can correspond to malignant disease but the differential diagnosis encompasses cyst, fibroadenomas, papillomas and posttraumatic/posttherapeutic changes. Therefore the mammography yields an equivocal result. In contrast stellate lesions and spiculated masses reach a ppv of up to 94%.

This course will discuss the most important factors that influence image quality and will give suggestions for examination techniques with various scanner types inciuding multirow detector systems. It will be demonstrated how problems such as streak artifacts in the brachiocephalic veins or pulsation effects in the ascending aorta can be reduced, and how subsecond tube rotation or multirow detector systems can be used to improve spatial resolution, shorten the overall examination time, improve vascular contrast or reduce the total amount of contrast agent. CT angiography is the 'workhorse' for the evaluation of aortic disease. It has a high diagnostic yield for the work-up of thoracic aneurysms and dissections, and allows for a precise characterization of the location of disease relative to the supraaortic branches. CTA is the technique of choice in acutely ill patients such as in suspected aortic rupture, aortic injury, or acute dissection. In acute and chronic pulmonary embolism. CTA has become an established standard technique that allows for direct visualization of the thrombembolic material. CTA, however, is limited to more central pulmonary arteries. Accurate evaluation of subsegmental arteries is limited with standard scanners but may be improved with newer scanners and optimum examination techniques. Typical pitfalls and diagnostic limitations of CTA will be discussed for various applications. Given the recent technologic advances, CT angiography remains a potent competitor to MRA for non-invasive imaging of the chest. Rapid progress in imaging techniques and advances in computer technology during the past decade has had an unquestionably profound effect on radiology, as weil as a strong influence on related clinical fields.",

From this data true tissue perfusion and functional images that depict the spatial variation of these haemodynamic features can be derived. The recent introduction of efficient and safe ultrasound contrast agents (USCAs) is participating to the development of color Doppler ultrasonography of renal diseases. The diagnosis of renal vascular diseases is facing many technical and anatomieallimitations. USCAs increase the Doppler signal intensity and the renal echogenicity in some cases. They improve the detection and the recording of main and supernumerary renal arteries and reduce the frequency of technical tailures. USCAs increase the role of color Doppler sonography as the primary modality in the screening of renovascular hypertension. USCAs improve the detection of renal vein blood flow for the diagnosis of patency and thrombosis in case of technical failure. They also improve the analysis of the cortical microvasculature and facilitate the diagnosis of perfusion defects. The diagnosis of renal infarct is tacilitated when the baseline Doppler signal is insufficient, as it is the case in the ischemic renal transplant. USCAs seem also capable of increasing the color Doppler sensitivity in the diagnosis of low flow arteriovenous fistulas and malformations. USCAs improve detection of intratumoral blood flow and may be useful for characterization and detection of small lesions. Next generation of USCAs will achieve reproducible B-mode enhancement and allow targeted drug delivery. USCAs are weil tolerated and do not have any renal toxicity.",

We will comment successively endovascular treatment of: -intracranial aneurysms treated selectively and by occlusion of parent vessel During the last ten years endovascular treatment has been accepted as a therapeutic alternative in the management of intracranial aneurysms, which are considered inoperable or pose a high surgical risk. Detachable balloons and non detachable microcoils have been used in the past, aneurysm rupture and coil migration have been observed as complications. With the advent of Guglielmi detachable coils (GDC) the indication for treatment of intracranial aneurysms night have been changed. The use of GDC allows a more controlled and precise placement of these very soft platinum microcoils, enabling selective occlusion of saccular aneurysms. Depending on the clinical presentation, the therapeutic protocol is different: The c1inical diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is confirmed on computed tomography (CT) and the diagnosis of an aneurysm is verified by four vessels angiography, using intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) technique. If an aneurysm is detected, endovascular embolization is performed in the same session with the angiography. All non-ruptured aneurysms are examined by CTangiography and/or by MR-angiography with three-dimensional reconstructions. These examinations do not only detect aneurysms but play an important role in planning the endovascular therapy. Our technique of endovascular therapy with GDC is demonstrated using abiplane DSA. In our series of 256 embolized aneurysms, the clinical presentation was SAH in 127,44 aneurysms were symptomatic and 58 aneurysms were found incidentally. The major complications were due to thromboembolic events, aneurysm rupture and rehemorrhage. The rate of recurrence as a disadvantage is 12 %. An advantage of the method includes the minimal invasive procedure and the possibility to treat patients in poor medical conditions as weil as patients with high risk aneurysms. Major Iimitations that will be presented are a broad neck of the aneurysm and a difficult vascular anatomy of the relevant arteries.

The use of composite PZT transducers has resulted in improvements in RF bandwidth. This has enabled the development of harmonie imaging in which the system receives ultrasound at twice the transmit frequency. In 1.5 D arrays a single row of elements is replaced by 3-7 shorter rows enabling focusing in the elevation plane. Intravascular ultrasound transducers have special problems associated with miniaturisation, multi-element devices have recently become available. Many machines now digitise the signal in RF, enabling the application of advanced signal processing techniques resulting in low image noise and improved spatial resolution. This has only been possible because of continuous improvement in hardware processing speed and digital storage size. Colour images may be obtained both of frequency shift or power, applied to blood or tissue. The use of harmonie imaging and contrast agents has led to improved sensitivity. Enormous research resources are being directed at contrast agents, however their c1inical potential is still being explored. The acquisition of 3D ultrasound datasets presents problems of automated collection and data registration. Conventional Doppler only acquires information along the ultrasound beam. Vector Doppler systems acquire Doppler data from 2 or 3 beam directions, with consequent reduction in angle dependence. Measurement of most physical quantities remains difficult. The mostly widely used are simple dimensions and blood velocity. Automated measurement of physical dimensions is being introduced, for example fetal BPD, left ventricular boundaries and LV volume. These technical developments have further expanded the clinical applications of ultrasound in many areas, in addition new applications such as intravascular ultrasound are being developed. 620 B.

There is a tendency to overestimate stenoses and produce false positive stenoses and occlusions where vessels run a horizontal course -this can be minimised by image acquisition during systole only, although this further increases examination time and therefore cost.

            "text": "Conclusion: MRCP is particularly accurate in detecting ductal anornalies due to chronic pancreatitis in a non-invasive manner. MRCP is therefore helpful in therapy planning in patients with chronic pancreatitis, reducing in this manner the number of diagnostic ERCPs. Purpose: We oberved that the acute pancreatitis (AP) can involve the subphrenic fat in some cases. We tried to find out how often the subphrenic fat infiltration (SFI) can be found and the correlation between SFI and Balthazar's grading criteria. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively studied the CT images of 182 consecutive AP cases idenlified by surgery er laboratory and clinical findings. We also observed the subphrenic region in 50 normal individuals. 30 cases with pleural effusions and 30 with ascites for comparison. Results: The SFI occurred in 73 of 182 cases (40.11%) superior to the left adrenal gland. It appeared as a band of soft tissue density (thickness >3 mm) with (35/73, 47.95%) or without (38/73, 52.05%) anormal fat layer anteriorly. Of the 182 cases, by balthazar's grading system, 9, 24, 42, 59 and 48 cases are grade A to E respectively, and the occurrence of SFI in grade A to E is 0, 0, 9 (21.43%),30 (50.85%),34 (70.83%) respectively. We never saw SFI in the control group, except one of the 30 cases with ascites which looked like SFI. Conclusion: We believe that the SFI is a significant sign of CT images in acute pancreatitis (positive rate is about 40.11 %). It mostly occurs in the cases of Balthazar's grade C to E, and hardly occurs in grade A and B.

CT Purpose: The aim of the study was to generate endoscopic views of the colon from data obtained with T1w 3D spoiled gradient echo sequence after administration of gadolinium through the rectum using volumerendering as reconstruction technique. Methods and Materials: Five patients with known colon cancers and 3 patients with polyps were submitted to MR examination using a 1.5 T magnet (Magnetom Vision Plus, Siemens, Erlangen). Imaging protocol included breath-hold FLASH T1w sequences acquired on axial and coronal planes and T2w HASTE sequences. Following colon preparation, patients were submitted to diluted gadolinium enema (1:1000) and scanned using a T1w 3D FISP sequence on supine position. When necessary additional prone scans were acquired. Images were reconstructed using volume-rendering technique (Vitrea 1.0, Vital Images, Fairfield, lowa). Both 20 axial MR images and volume-rendered 3D reconstructions were evaluated. Results: Images of diagnostic quality were obtained in all the cases. All the tumors were correctly evaluated. One polyps smaller than 5 mm was missed whereas two polyps larger than 10 mm were correctly evaluated. Conclusion: MR virtual colonoscopy is a reliable imaging modality for the evaluation of colon cancers. In particular the additional use of volume-rendering technique for 3D reconstructions allows for a better image quality compared with conventional surface rendering techniques, offering more realistic views. Purpose: To compare CT virtual colonoscopy (VC) with tissue transition projection in the detection of clinically suspected colorectal cancer. Methods and Materials: 34 patients who were c1inically suspected of having colorectal cancer were referred to CT. After bowel c1eansing and rectal air insufflation, spiral CT was performed with 3 mm slice thickness, 5 mm table feed and 2 mm reconstruction interval. Virtual colonoscopy and tissue transition projection (TTP images resemble conventional fluoroscopie double contrast studies with a translucent bowel wall) were generated on an EasyVision workstation (Philips Medical Systems) using volume rendering technique. A 120 0 viewing angle, 2% depth encoding and 2 cm image distance (fly-through mode) was used for VC. The air classification was set to -650 HU for both reconstruction techniques. TTP images were reconstructed in 15\u00b0-steps revolving around the patient's longitudinal axis. All patients underwent subsequent fibre-optic endoscopy and surgical bowel resection. Results: On both VC and TTP, a total of 28 cancers (stage pT1: 3, pT2: 14, pT3: 9, pT4: 2) were detected. TTP, virtual and fibre-optic endoscopy (including biopsy) diagnosed malignant tumor in one patient, however, surgical resection revealed a massive chronic diverticulitis. In five patients with diverticulitis, VC revealed 17% more diverticula than TTP. A synchronous colorectal tumor was found in 2 patients, equally shown on both techniques. Conclusion: CT virtual colonoscopy and TTP have reached a high diagnostic value in the assessment of symptomatic patients. Both VC and TTP are equally effected by rendering artifacts. Tf'P bares the advantage of presenting the entire bowel, hence supporting the anatomical orientation that can be difficult in VC alone. However, the sensitivity of TTP for polyp detection remains to be determined.",

Methods and Materials: Twenty-four patients affected by colo-rectal disorders were selected excluding those with known or high suspicion for inflammatory bowel disease. Non-contrast spiral CT (Somatom Plus 4, Siemens, G) examination of the abdomen and pelvis after regular colonoscopy bowel preparation was performed. The colon was distended with air and antiperistaltic drug was administered in order to reduce bowel motion. Images were obtained with 5 mm collimation, pitch 1-1.6, 3 mm reconstructions; when necessary prone acquisitions were additionally obtained. Reconstructions were performed on a 02 workstation (Silicon Graphichs, Mountain View, CA, USA) using Vitrea 1.0 software (Vital Images, Fairfield, lowa). Images were blindly reviewed by two expert GI radiologists and were correlated with conventional colonoscopy in all the patients. Results: Image quality was graded as optimal in all the cases. Preliminary results showed very high values of interobserver agreement (k value > .8). Colonic diverticula were correctly diagnosed in all the cases on 20 images, but very difficult evaluation was obtained on endoscopic views. Polypoid lesions and tumors larger than 1 cm were correctly identified in all the cases. Conclusion: Spiral CT colography is a reliable technique in the evaluation of colo-rectal disorders. The combination of 20 and 3D endoscopic views allows for a better diagnostic performance. Purpose: to compare the results of CT colonography with barium enema, fiberoptic endoscopy. Methods and Materials: Thirty-six patients (47-78 years, 16 female, 20 male) with suspected colorectal tumours underwent 3D CT colonography, fiberoptic endoscopy (total) or endoscopy (partial) plus double contrast barium enema within a 3 days period. For 3D CT colonography, the colon after cleaning was retrogradely insufflated with air and Iv. peristalticolyticum was given. A 45 second 5/7.5/3 mm spiral scanning was performed during breathhold. A second spiral scan was added at the region of interest in doubtful cases with Iv. contrast material. The results were compared with those of fiberoptic colonoscopy and barium enema. Results: CT colonography detected all 17 malignancies diagnosed by colonoscopy. Two additional higher tumours were diagnosed by CT colonography (and barium enema) not reached by partial colonoscopy. In detecting polyps, CT colonography was 100% sensitive for polyps >20 mm, but only 60% sensitive for polyps <20 mm. Conclusion: CT colonography has good patient compliance and seems to be a useful diagnostic modality in detecting colorectal neoplasms. The right side of the colon can always be reached. For screening purposes technical refinements are needed to increase sensitivity for small polyps. Purpose: To prospectively compare the accuracy of conventional and virtual colonoscopy for colorectal polyp detection. Methods and Materials: 73 patients (39 men and 34 women; mean age, 59 years) at moderate risk for colorectal cancer underwent virtual colonoscopy immediately prior to conventional colonoscopy. Supine and prone CT acquisitions of the air-distended clean colon were obtained using 5 mm collimation, 2 mm index, 110 mA, and 110 kVp. Perspective volume rendered images were interpreted in combination with axial CT images . Results of virtual colonoscopy were compared with the findings of same-day conventional colonoscopy, wh ich was regarded as the goldstandard . Results: 79 polyps and 2 cancers were ident ified on conventional colonoscopy. Virtual colonoscopy demonstrated all 15 polyps (100 %) measuring 10 mm or greater, 23 of 24 polyps (96%) 6-9 mm in size , 22 of 40 polyps (55%) 1-5 mm in size, and both cancers. 42 polyps were adenomas, 39 (92.8%) of which were correctly identified on virtual colonoscopy. Virtual colonoscopy resulted in 7 false positive findings. The sens itivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of virtual colonoscopy for patients with polyps were 94 .3%, 92.1%, 91 .7%, 94.6% respectively. Conelusion : Preliminary results of virtual colonoscopy for polyp detection exceed those of barium enema and are competitive with conventional colonoscopy. Purpose: To optim ize the enema in MRC with regard to cost and viscosity. Methods and Materials: Gd-DTPA-, manganesechloride-, ironglycerophosphate-and manganesechloride-ironglycerophosphate dilution series were imaged with the 3D SPGR-sequence used for MRC . SIconcentration curves were obta ined for each contrast media. The concentration of ironglycerophosphate providing max imal SI was used to fill the colon of 5 fully anesthesized pig. The existence of ironuptake was histologically determined by Prussian blue staining . Finally, in 6 patients undergoing MRC a Gd-DTPA-water cellulose mixture was diluted with water until its viscosity allowed a hydrostatically based rectal filling. Results: All contrast media resulted in an initial SI increase, followed by an eventual SI decrease as concentrations wer e increased. The highest SI was ach ieved with a 45 mmolar (28 gll) ironglycerophosphate-water solution. In vivo, this contrast media provided excellent depiction of the colon without artifacts and ironuptake. The opt imal amount of cellulose additive , wh ich permitted infusion of the enema in all six patients amounted to 0.8%. Conelusion: The expensive Gd compound can be replaced by the cheaper ironglycerophosphate. A cellulose additive of 0.8% (w/w) is practicable for increasing the viscosity of the enema . ",

Using Gd-waterdilut ion series the optimal flip-angle and Gd-concentration providing a signal void on SSFSE-and maximum signal on 3D-SPGR-images was determined . Finally, a 10 mmolar Gd-enema was applied to 15 patients with known inflammatory or neoplastic disease undergoing MRC and colonoscopy.

Purpose: To evaluate feasibility of MR-Colonoscopy with a 1.0 Tesla system . Methods and Materials: A first feasibility study was done in an animal model with simulated polyps (diameter 0.4-1.5 cm) . Thereafter seven patients (age 39-81 years; 6 f, 1 m) were examined by MR-colonoscopy and endoscopic coloscopy. After preparation for coloscopy the colon was filled under MR-guidance with a Gadol inium/water solution (1:100) . A breathhold 3D-gradient-echo-sequence was acquired in prone/supine position and after intravenous Gadolinium administration . Images were analyzed interactively using mult iplanar projection (MPR), maximum intensity projection (MIP) and surface projection . The virtual endoscopy was performed on a GE-workstation furnished with \"Advantage windows\". The MRI-results were correlated with the endoscopic finding s. Results: All seven solitary polyps (diameter> 0.5 cm) detected at endoscop ic coloscopy were visualized by virtua l colonoscopy. Furthermore, two neoplasms of the colon were identified correctly. Supine/prone pos ition and CM-enhancement facilitated to distinguish polyps from fecal mater ial. Conclusion: The virtual MR-colonoscopy is feasible with a 1.0 Tesla system . This method provides suffi cient image quality combined wilh short acquisition times and minimal patient discomfort. Purpose: To compare MRC with colonoscopy in the detection of colorectal mass lesions . Methods and Materials: 132 patients underwent MRC prior to colonoscopy. Following MR-monitored rectal filling of a 10mmolar gadoliniumwater enema, 3D data sets were collected breathheld in the patienl's prone and supine positions. The exam was complemented by the breathheld acquisition of a T2w image set. All image data including endoscopic reconstructions were assessed for the presence of colorectal mass lesions by two radiologists in a blinded fashion in a consensus reading . Results: MR-image quality was sufficient for diagnosis in 96% of patients . Most mass lesions smaller or equal to 5 mm in size were miss ed with MRC. MRC did correclly identify 19/31 (61%) lesions ranging in size between 6 and 10 mm, and 26/27 (96 %) lesions exceeding 10 mm in size . Using a 10 mm cut off size, MRC revealed a sens itivity of 93%, a specificity of 99%, a positive pred ictive value of 92% and a negat ive predictive value of 98% in the detection of mass positive patients. Conclusion: MRC holds promise as a screening modality for colorectal mass lesions . Purpose: To determine the usefulness of RTVR in comparison to spiral-CT imaging in detection of comp licat ions in patients with Crohn 's disease. Methods and Materials: After application of a duodenal tube and infus ion of 2000 ml of water soluble contrast media (2%), 50 patients suffering from proven Crohn's disease underwent spiral-CT on a Somatom Plus 40 scanner (slice 8 rnrn, feed 14 mm, increment 5 mm) before and after the i.v, administration of 150 ml of non ionic contrast. Beside conventional filming the data sets were transferred to an Onyx-I-station (Silicon Graphics), where RTVR enables to view CT-data sets from any orientation. Three different observers blinded to the patient's data investigated the filmed CT ser ies and data sets on the RTVR comparing the number of complications found . Results: Complications were detected in 18 (36%) in RTVR and in 16 (32%) patients in conventional film reading . 15 (30 %) fistulas were found in RTVR, 13 (26 %) in conventional film reading . 4 ((%) abscesses, 1 (2%) phlegmona and 1 (2%) mild obstruction were found in both methods. Interobserver agreement was excellent (kappa =0.83) Conclusion: The number of complications found in spiral CT was not sign ificantly different when using the RTVR, Fistulas could be better detected using the RTVR-technique. The size of aortic root , descending aorta, prothesis and per iprosthetic effus ion, proximal and distal anastomosis were measured . Occurring residual the false lumen and the aortic thoraco-abdominal branches involvement were also analyzed . Results: The analysis of variance between TEE , conventional MRI and MRA showed an agreement in the evaluation of aortic root size. Slight difference was observed between TEE and MRI in the evaluation of prothesis and descending aortic size with agreement between conventional MRI and MRA . MRA was inadequate in the evaluation of the periprosthetic effusion and differences were observed between conventional MRI and TEE . Qualitative data were also compared: pers istent flap , patency of the false lumen, abdominal aorta , sovra-aortic and abdominal branches involvement. Conclusion: MRA is a fast and accurate technique in the evaluat ion of the endoluminal alterations and the involvement of the aortic branches . Conventional MRI allows a direct evaluation of the aortic wall and periaortic tissue: TEE is less accurate in the evaluation of aortic branches and abdominal aorta.",

Methods and Materials: After an overnight fasting 300 ml of air was inflated to the intestines through an enteroclysis tube placed in the first loops of the jejunum. I.m. 25 mg Glucagon was given and spiral CT scanning using 5 mm collima tion and 1.5 pitch was applied during one breath-hold covering the intestines. Binary segmen tation and connectivity algorithms were applied comb ined with manua l navigation . In uncertain cases for proper segmentation an algorithm was utilized, wh ich searches for the midline of the intestines starting from a seeding point and uses binary tresholding comb ined with connectivity. Results: Binary tresholding and connectivity based segmentation resulted in uncertain margins in slim patients. The semiautomatic midline searching combined with segmentation yielded a feasible tool for determining complex geometry and eliminates difficulties with manual navigation. The semiautomatic method also allows the wall thickness to be measured and color coded . The axial images with air filling can be used for conventional CT diagnos is as weil , and allow i.v, contrast material to be applied. Conclusion: Virtual CT enteroscopy is technically feasible. The method has to be technically refined, but it allows a non invasive imaging of intestinal tumors and strictures. Results: CE MRA correctly diagnosed the presence of aortic (n =8), iliac (n = 2) or combined aorto-iliac occlusions (n = 6) in all patients when compared to conventional angiography. It also correctly determined the level and extent of occlusion in all patients although the degree of stenosis was overestimated in 2 patients with iliac disease. The distal vessels were visualized down to the common femoral arteries in all patients and to the level of the proximal superficial femoral arteries in 7 patients. Thirteen patients underwent axillo-bifemoral bypass surgery, 2 patients had percutaneous iliac stent placement and one patient had aortic embolectomy based on these findings. Conclusion: CE MRA gave anatomical detail of the occlusion, proximal aorta and distal run-off sufficient to plan surgery and should therefore be considered as the first line of investigation in such patients. Results: In all patients the real and false lumina of the thoracic and/or abdominal aortaI dissection could be visualized together with the origin of branching arte ries as weil as the dynamic of perfusion of the true and false lumen. Conclusion: 3D reconstructions give a more detailed impression of the anatomical relations than CT and conventional angiography providing the surgeon with important anatomical and morphological information such as involvement of other arteries, position of real and false lumina and three-dimensional configuration of the dissection. MR angiography is less invasive than conventional angiography and especially in patients with known hypersensitivity to iodinated contrast media or impaired renal function MR angiography is able to replace contrast enhanced CT and conventional angiography in patients with aorta I dissection.

Due to the small size of the speeimen (1.6-20 g) the eosmetic result was better than after eonventional surgical removal of a breast lesion. Conclusion: The results after 40 proeedures suggest that the minimally invasive breast biopsy instrumentation is a feasible and effeetive method to remove or sample breast lesions. Purpose: To show that the results of the minimally invasive breast surgery with the ABBI (USSC. Norwalk. CT) depend strongly on the quality of the pre-, intra-and postsurg ieal imaging.",

Methods and Materials: We reviewed a eonsecutive ser ies of 305 nonpalpable breast cancers treated with breast conserving surgery after pre-operative Iocalization with mammographic follow-up examinations . Breast irradiation at a standardised dose of 54 Gy given in small doses had been given to 212 cases. The suspicion of needle tract seeding or tumor implantation was based on the location of the recurrent lesion in comparison with the needle path in two orthogonal pre-operative projections. Results: A total of 28 local recurrenees was found after an average follow-up of 4.5 years. Breast irradiation showed a protectiveeffect in invasive cancers but not in DCIS. Needle traet seeding or tumor implantation was suspected in 4 reeurrenees. These 4 recurrenees.~ad not received radiotherapy. The histology reports support the susprcron in one case of adenoid cystic cancer and one case of mucinous cancer. The histoloqy reports does not exclude the possibility in the remaining 2 cases. Conclusion: Needle tract seeding or tumor implantation was suspected in 4 of 28 recurrenees. Radiotherapy might prevent these cases . Hip studies were performed separately for left and right joint using a prototype coil (W.I.P). Results: Dedicated MRI exam ination was performed without any problems for the patients (claustrophoby, motion art ifacts etc ..) in 100% of knee , ankle , wrist, and elbow joints. In 5/100 shoulders, and in 25/50 hips , MRI examination could not be performed due to the joint size . In all studies performed, the displayed FOV (14 cm .) allows for a complete and detailed anatomical evaluation of the joints. Conelusion: On the basis of our preliminary experience, we consider this \"new dedicated open MRI system \", due to low cost, easy installation, reduced fringe field, patient comfort and high anatomical details, an excellent alternative to total body MRI units, especially in the study of the shoulder.",

Methods and Materials: 110 volunteers were examined by dynam ic phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In the magnet, the quadriceps muscle was stressed by an isometrie and an isotonic form of exercise until exhaustion, respectively. Results: Older volunteers showed a sign ificantly larger ratio Pi (inorgan ic phosphate)/PCr (phosphocreatine) than younger volunteers (r = 0.52 ; P = 8 x 10-9 ) . With increasing volunteers' age, the ratio r~-ATP (adenosine triphosphate)fTP (total phosphate) decreased (r = -0.36; P = 5 X 10-5 ) . PME (phosphomonoester)/\u00df-ATP and PDE (phosphodiester)/\u00df-ATP showed a strong age-dependence (r = 0.71 and 0.69; p =3 X 10-17 and 4 x 10-15 , respectively). The pH was the only one of the evaluated spectroscopic parameters wh ich showed a sexdependence: Female volunteers had a significantly lower pH (7.03 \u00b1 0.02) than male volunteers (7.05 \u00b1 0 .03; p =6 x 10-4) . With increasing age , max ima of Pi/PCr were less extreme during both of the exercises (r = -0.51; P = 3 x 10-16 ) . Likewise, the exercise-induced acidosis was less severe with increasing age (r =-0.51; P =7 X 10-16 ). After the end of the exercises, the tim es of half recovery of Pi/PCr and the pH did not correlate with the volunteers' age or sex. Conelusion: Sex and age may affect spectroscopic results in a sign ificant way. This influence has to be considered in the interpretation of spectroscopic studies. Purpose: Aware that asp irated jo int fluid in degenerative arthritis is viscous , in contrast to inflammatory arthritis, this study was undertaken to evaluate the potential of MR imaging using diffusion gradients to allow non-invasive determination of synovial fluid viscosity, and hence provide a non-invasive indicator of the underlying form of arthritls, Methods and Materials: 10 in vitro specimens of synovia I fluid from patients with both degenerative and inflammatory arthropathy were sutdied with navigator corrected diffusion grad ients ranging from 0 to 10 mT/m (B values 0-512) on a Philips 1.5 Tesla Gyroscan triggered by a peripheral pulse monitor. Diffusion coeffrcients of each specimen were recorded at 50 degrees, at body temperature and above body tempe rature . Subsequently, diffus ion characteristics were evaluated in 20 in vivo patients referred with jo int effus ions and known primary diagnoses. Results: Decreased diffusion was observed in patients with effus ions secondary to inflammatory arthritis includ ing gout, pseudogout and both seropositive and seronegative arthritis. Conclusion: Diffusion imaging allows non-invasive evaluation of joint fluid viscosity. Joint fluid diffusion characteristics may be used as further non-invasive markers of degenerative and inflammatory arthritis. Purpose: To evaluate the dependency of image quality on radiation dose in direct digital radiography of the appendicular skeleton using a selen ium detector array. Methods and Materials: A cadaveric forearm and hand with calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate cristal deposition arthropathy and generalized osteopenia was prepared for radiographie evaluation . Adequate image quality on conventional 400 speed film-screen system without grid was achieved with 50 kVp and 3.6 mAs. Digital radiographie images were obtained using a selenium detector array (DirectRay, Sterling Diagnostic Imaging) with a Nyquist frequency of 3.6 line pairs per mm and a spatial resolution greater than 0.75 at 1.81ine pairs per mm, capturing a 2560 x 3072 14 bit image. The tube-current time product (mAs) was gradually reduced from 3.6 mAs to 0.5 mAs for the digital images. Images were reviewed on laserprinter hard copies. Image quality parameters, judged by two experienced musculoskeletal radiologists were: image resolution, contrast and perceptibility of fine trabecular detail, erosions and calcifications, and soft-tissue contras!. Results: Digital images showed image quality comparable to that of conventional images (50 kVp, 3.6 mAs) for tube-current time products ranging between 3.6 and 1.6 mAs. At 1.6 mAs, the effective reduction in radiation dose (surface entranee dose) was 56%. Conclusion: Digital radiography with selenium detectors holds the potential to significantly decrease radiation dose while maintaining adequate image quality. Purpose: To determine the value of CT for therapy monitoring regarding the museie size in patients with chronic heart failure and consecutive muscle atrophy. Methods and Materials: In 4 patients (mean age 60 years) the transverse area of the thigh was analyzed in a defined position by single slice CT imaging before and after neuromuscular electrical stimulation and in 2 patients without therapy. CT findings were further compared with the results of isokinetic and isometrie strength measurements. Results: Patients, undergoing therapy revealed an increase in museie slze, whieh was in mean 589 mm2 tor the extensor museie group and 613 mm2 for the entire museie group. In the patients without therapy a decrease of muscle size was found. Conclusion: CT single slice measurements of the mid thigh muscles area correlate weil with isokinetic and isometrie strength measurements. The CT measurements are not influenced by non-compliant patients. Purpose: The aim of this work in progress is to assess the role of Power Doppler (PD) ultrasound in the evaluation of the postsurgical changes in tendons. Methods and Materials: 20 operated tendons were evaluated. We subdivided the patients depending on the surgical procedure performed. We used high frequeney linear array transducers (7-13 MHz), provided with PD. We depicted changes in ultrasonographie and PD signal one month after surgery and during a follow-up period of 6 to 20 months. All the patients underwent clinical examination at the time of the US evaluation.",

Conclusion: PD is an objective method in evaluating the normal development of postsurgical tendinous changes, becoming an useful control tool in obscure and eomplicated cases. Further studies are needed to evaluated the possibility of using PD signal as prognostic faetor. The dissociation between PD and HRUS, makes the former the most essential tool for evaluation. Results: A comparison of the speetra between fibromyalgic patients and eontrols showed inereased relative concentrations of Pi (0.074/0.089) in the first group whereas the eslimated relative concentrations of PCr (0.405/0.370) and NTP (0.132/0.116) were decreased in this group. In addition to this differences the signal intensity of the phosphodiesters in fibromyalgic palients was found to be increased. Differences in the pH-values between both groups were not deteeted.

Results: Optimal relative T1-1T2-signal and X-ray absorption were found for a gd concentration of 3.125 mM Gd and 150 mgl/ml. Analysis of the imaging data demonstrated a better delineation of the cartilaginous structures by the T2-weighted TSE-technique as compared to T1-SE.

We retrospectively examined the radiological follow-up of 127 women with ovarian carcinoma who underwent surgery and chemotherapy between the years 1985-1996. Of the cases examined, 82 (65%) had at least one ehest CT scan done, with over 50% of them having three or more scans. Thirty-two (39%) of the examinations showed no evidence of disease. Twenty-eight (34%) showed disease in the abdomen or pelvis but no disease in the ehest. Eighteen (22%) had both positive ehest and abdominal/pelvic CT scans. Chronologically abdominal/pelvic disease appeared before disease in the ehest in all of these cases. Four (5%) patients had isolated ehest disease of which three had only pleural effusion. Overall, only 6 of 82 patients (7%) with ehest CT scans had evidence or suspicion of lung metastases. All cases of pulmonary metastases were preceded either by abdominal/pelvic disease or by a rise in tumor markers. We suggest that ehest CT scans may be excluded from the routine follow-up of patients with ovarian carcinoma, and reserved for cases with rising tumor markers without evidence of abdominal/pelvic disease.

Still images and videoclips were shown to five independent, experienced observers, who scored the images using five set criteria. Results: Aigorithms were given a mean rank for each criterion, and an overall mean rank. All criteria were perceived better with contrast enhancement. Following statistical analysis, it was found that contrast enhancement outperformed every other algorithm (p < 0.01). Of the criteria, only one was perceived better on the videoclips (p < 0.05). However, the majority of the criteria were perceived as equivocal. Conclusion: Examination of the results shows that proper selection of image processing algorithms can significantly enhance the perception of image features, possibly leading to more accurate diagnosis. Further work is being carded out in this area. The results for real-time imaging were probably skewed by observer bias, and will require further evaluation by ROC analysis.",

After that there were made replicas of the lumen by plastic. These were scanned by a 3D Laser scanner and the computed volumes compared with results from CT scanner. Results: Slice thickness and threshold are the decisive factors for accuracy. Increasing of pitch factor up to 1.5 shows no significant influence. Using of an edge enhancing algorithm ls better than standard algorithm of reconstruction. Using a overlapping reconstruction interval can only reduce stairsteps artifacts.

The influence of the adjustment of the duplex unit on the diagnostic accuracy and on the rate of Iymph nodes with detectable intranodal flow signals was tested. Methods and Materials: 243 superficial Iymph nodes in 127 patients were included in a retrospective study. Diagnoses were approved by histopathology (n =173) or clinical follow-ups (n =70 reactive Iymph nodes). The intranodal angioarchitecture and sonomorphology were assessed. We used nonparametrie discriminant analysis in order to define appropriate settings for transducer frequency, flow mode, power and threshold which result in the best diagnostic quality. Results: 87% of the Iymph nodes displayed flow signals using a threshold of > = 13 and the flow modes low or medium. Vascularisation was detected only in 47% of the nodes assessed with different adjustments. Diagnostic accuracy dropped from 94% to 68-84% if threshold was <13 or power was <-11 dB. Conclusion: An insufficient adjustment of the colour duplex unit decreases the chance to detect intranodal flow signals and impairs the diagnostic quality of colour duplex sonography.

This project evaluates the temporal and spatial advantages of MR projection reconstruction acquisitions. Methods and Materials: Two types of Fluoroscopie Gradient Echo Projection Reconstruction (F-GEPR), 180 view sequences were implemented on a Siemens (Erlangen, Germany) Open 0.2T MR imager. One was an interleaved acquisition; the other was a continuous acquisition of a limited number of views. Unlike in 2DFT imaging in which half of the Purpose: In ten years of interventional MRI we learned how difficult it can be to get a good compromise between the representation of the anatomy and the needle. With the new idea for a future MRI puncture needle set with artefact size adaptability we intend to make the therapist more independent of thinking about the needle appearance, so that he can concentrate exclusively on optimising the anatomical contrast. Methods and Materials: In phantom experiments commercial needles (18 G-21 G) and MR compatible wires were imaged at 2 Tesla and 0.064 Tesla using various spinecho-and gradientecho-sequences under different geometrical conditions. We developed fluoroscopie and breathhold sequences for specific interventional applications and a prototype interventional needle set. Results: Depending on sequence parameters and geometrical conditions commercial puncture needles might appear thin or thick, sharp or faded and sometimes they are invisible in MR images. In the worst case the precision of the needle representation is not sufficient for the guidance of the percutaneous procedure. With our self-made prototype needle set we could adapt the size of the needle representation to the requirements of the therapy. Conclusion: Our new MRI needle set will help to perform safe and efficient microtherapeutical procedures. Methods and Materials: A prototype perfused MR-imaging balloon was developed (Schneider Europe AG, Switzerland). The receive coil was mounted between two layers of balloon and connected to the outside coi! electronics over a small diameter coaxial cable. For balloon perfusion, the catheter wall was provided with holes proximal to the balloon. The flow rate through the catheter was determined experimentally. In vitro intravascular imaging of five human femoral artery specimen was performed under pulsatile flow conditions. The catheter concept was evaluated in vive in the internal carotid arteries of two pigs. Results: The measured flow rate of glycerol/water as perfusate ranged from 50 ml/min (80 mmHg) to 69 ml/min (120 mmHg). During perfusion, image quality remained unaffected by f1ow, motion, and pulsatiliy artifacts. Due to high velocity flow effects, the perfused guidewire lumen appeared dark in the acquired fast spinecho images. The achieved inplane resolution was 117 x 156 mm within 3.16 min for all weightings. The in vivo flow rate was determined to 25 ml/min. Conclusion: The availability of an autoperfused intravascular catheter design can be considered an important step toward high resolution atherosclerotic plaque imaging in critical vessels such as the carotid and coronary arteries. Purpose: To report our experience with MR-guided percutaneous drainage of abdominal fluid collections on a hybrid interventional MR system, which combines a closed bore magnet with aC-arm fluoroscopy unit. Methods and Materials: Ouring the last two years, we have performed four drainage procedures in four patients (mean age 47). Three patients had abcsesses (psoas muscle, kidney, subphrenic location) and the fourth patient had a recurrent splenic cyst. All procedures were performed on an interventional MR system consisting of a 1.5 T ACS-NT scanner combined with a specially shielded C-arm (BV 212, Philips Medical Systems). The punctures were guided by T1-weighted fast gradient echo images, T2-weighted single shot turbo spin echo images or both. A standard 18 G stainless steel needle with a teflon sheath was used for the punctures following wich a 0.9 mm nltinol guide wire was inserted into the fluid collection. Thereafter, the patient was positioned in the immediate adjacent fluoroscopy unit and a drainage catheter was placed under fluoroscopie control. Conclusion: MR-guided drainage procedures on a system combining an MR scanner with a f1uoroscopy unit ls feasible. The eombination is partieularly helpful for abseesses in the subphrenic loeation. Coagulation was monitored adopting two GRE sequenees (TRITE 18-40/10-20 ms, image update 2 or 5 s). The proton frequency shift (PFS)changes were color eoded, and superimposed on the updated GRE images. MR-Iesion sizes were compared to macroseopy. Introduction: One promising approach for MR temperature quantification is based on the temperature dependency of water proton resonance frequency (WPRF). Most studies, which have been performed to determine the relation between temperature and resonance frequency, were carried out with phantoms and tissue specimens. In vivo, however, is still an unknown uncertainty of the MR temperature mapping due to perfusion changes during heating. The aim of this study was to determine this influence during interstitial laser eoagulation within brain. Methods and Materials: To minimize non-physiologie sources of error we performed MR temperature imaging during interstitial laser coagulation within the brain of six pigs in vivo and post mortem. For laser eoagulation a Nd:YAG laser in continuos wave mode was used. MRI was performed on 1. Purpose: Iron oxides comprise a useful tool for future interventional radiologie treatments of malignant tissue, making use of their heating capabilities after exposure to alternating magnetic fields. Nevertheless, several parameters are to be optimized for a controlled heating. Methods and Materials: Selected commercial sampies (particle size: 10 to 20 nm) were investigated in relation to their magnetic properties. Temperature elevations were investigated depending on the magnetite concentration (7 to 28 mg), the magnetic field amplitude (1.4 to 6.5 kAlm) and the exposure time (2 and 10min) to the alternating magnetic field (frequency: 400 kHz). Temperature profiles around areas of iron oxide deposits were measured in dependence on distance. Results: Measured specific loss power (SLP) varied appreciably for different magnetite particle types. Best values are near 100 W/g (fequency: 410kHz, amplitude: 6.5 kAlm). For the dependence of SLP on the magnetic field a square law was found. Temperature increases linearly as function of the magnetite concentration. Temperature elevations in dependence on heating time showed non-linear curves with saturation behavior. While getting up to 80\u00b0C in the center of magnetite deposits, temperature decreases within a distance of 10 mm to ambient. Useful parameter combinations were investigated. Conclusion: Controlled heating of tumors can be achieved as exemplified by the present co-ordination of investigated parameters. Purpose: To characterise the sequential changes in reflectivity of liver lesions on B-mode ultrasound (US) following intravenous BR1 (US contrast agent), and to correlate with histology. Methods and Materials: 10 patients were assessed. Using preset parameters each lesion was examined at baseline and after four separate doses of BR1 (1.5-12.0 mg). Digital images were analysed in a program which derived pixel brightness averaged over a representative area. Sequential images were sampled at the same depth. The pixel brightness estimated tissue reflectivity. The degree and time course of changes in reflectivity of lesion and parenchyma were compared and correlated with histology.",

Purpose: The purpose of this work was to determine the AGD delivered to symptomatic women and those involved in screening programmes, to compare the doses for cranio-caudal (CC) and medio-lateral oblique (MLO) views, and to analyse the relation dose-quality criteria. AGD is the quantity directly related to the risk of breast-cancer induction. Methods and Materials: Data from 327 women distributed in 9 centers were collected. AGD per exposure and AGD per examination (indicative of risk) were determined following the European Protocol on Dosimetry in Mammography. Quality criteria for a good radiographic technique were analysed according to the EUR 16260 document. Results: Differences of 13% for dose and 7% for thickness were observed between the two groups for the CC view, being the dose for the symptomatic group lower. A difference in dose of 6% was found between the CC and MLO views. No difference in mean compressed breast thickness was observed. No relationship between fulfilment of quality criteria and dose delivered was found. Conclusion: The risk can be estimated from AGD measurements from the CC or MLO views. Differences in dose between centers is due to differences in techniques and equipments utilized. Purpose: An eleven year old X-ray system has been compared with a new digital X-ray system, being are designed for cardiac angiography. Methods and Materials: The old equipment had continiuos f1uoroscopy, cine with 25 frames per second and no added tube-filtration, the image intensifier-entrance doses were 0.7~Gy/s and 4~Gy/s respectively. The new equipment had two f1uoroscopy programs, with II-entrance doses of 0.2~Gy/s (P1) or 004~Gy/s (P2), and a cine program with 12.5 frames per second and 1.25~Gy/s. The added tube filtration was 0.1 mm Cu and for cine it was 0.2 mm, 0.1 mm Cu or no added filtration, depending on the tube-load. A special phantom and reference procedures were used. The entrance dose was determined by calculation or measurement and the dose-distribution by TLD's and EPD's attached to a dummy-user.

The reduction on the patient entrance dose is 50% for P1, 11% for P2 and 85% with cine. The dosimetric records showed a reduction of almost 40% for the cardiologist and 40-60% for the assistent. Conclusion: New equipment can reduce patient entrance dose and occupational dose to the staf, when the equipment is propely adjusted. In the first phase of our study, image quality at a fixed reduced dose was scored as a function of patient diameter. For a specific clinical question, a reference patient diameter was defined as the one, below which the particular reduced dose gave sufficient diagnostic quality. In a second phase we adapted kV and mAs settings to the difference between the reference patient diameter and the actual patient diameter as computed from the scanogram. In this procedure, errors in the actual patient diameter mainly arise from geometrical magnification and patient movement. Comparison of scanograms and CT images from three different hospitals shows that routine patient positioning practice results in patient diameter estimates that are typically better than 5%. Results: With this automatic dose adjustment we achieved for a 5 mm pancreas protocol an average dose reduction of 29% while image quality was good. Conclusion: We have shown that this simple method of dose adjustment that can be easily implemented on current CT scanners is an effective way to reduce dose while maintaining diagnostic quality. Purpose: A standard angiographic C-arm system that acquires 2D projection images is used for a 3D reconstruction of intracranial vasculature for diagnostic review as weil as during interventional procedures. Methods and Materials: A rotational angiography is taken around the patient's head over 200 0 in 5 s with a conventional, though specially calibrated X-ray C-arm system. A single arterial injection of about 15 cc of contrast agent is sufficient. Patient dose is low. Projection images are transferred to a separate workstation. After several preprocessing steps a 3D volume is generated through a cone-beam CT reconstruction. Results: The reconstructed volumes can be arbitrarily visualized, edited and evaluated on the workstation (e.g. volume measurement). Display modes are surface shaded display, maximum intensity projection and more advanced techniques Iike volume rendering and virtual endoscopy. A selection of interesting c1inical cases will be presented. Conclusion: A single rotation of the C-arm and one injection of contrast agent is sufficient for generating a 3D reconstruction of vessels over the whole head. The reconstructions show very good image quality with excellent, isotropic spatial resolution and high diagnostic value. This additional 3D information will be available right away in the interventional angio lab (work in progress).",

To date, primitive CP is not a single entity but a group of disorders. Among these, alcoholic calcifying and caleified CP is listed but is not the most frequent. Recently, the diagnosis of primitive autoimmune CP has been suggested on the basis of CT and MR findings. This diagnosis is important since the lesion can be cured with simple steroid treatment. Secondary or obstructive CP is certainly more frequent than the literature suggests. New imaging easily shows this type of CP and its causes. Among the latter, cystic dystrophy of the duodenal wall is particularly interesting, since its presence makes pancreato-duodenectomy necessary. However, certain protocols have to be followed in order to obtain all the possible diagnostic information. Based on the current data on MRFP imaging, it is a realistic assumption that MRFP imaging in combination with eine or tagging MRI will provide us with a better understanding for differentiating stunned and hibernating, from non-viable tissue, and to obtain better outcome data. The main obstacles for a wider use of these new diagnostic tools to assess perfusion is the lack of a large c1inical data base since the manufacturers of MR systems and pharmaceutical companies have not yet reached a consensus on the support of major multi-center trials.

The complex conditions of irradiation in CT, involving highly collimated X-ray beams, necessitate the use of specially defined dose descriptors such as the Computed Tomography Oose Index (CTOI). The selection of appropriate diagnostic reference dose quantities has proved particularly challenging since they are required to provide a meaningful indication of patient exposure for all types of scanner and technique, whilst being simple to assess. Two reference dose quantities have been defined on the basis of measurements of CTOI made with a pencil ionisation chamber in standard head or body CT dosimetry phantoms: weighted CTOI for a single slice and, which due account of the thickness and number of slices in a complete examination, dose-Iength product ( Radiation exposure to the patient during CT is relatively high. It is therefore important to optimize the dose to be as low as consistent with required diagnostic image quality. The quality criteria concept as developed for conventional X-ray examination has been proved to be an effective method for optimising the use of ionising radiation. In a EU working document, EUR 16262, regarding Quality Criteria for CT this concept has been used to provide an operational framework for radiation protection initiatives in which technical parameters required for adequate image quality is considered in relation to patient dose. The document includes diagnostic requirements specifying anatomical/diagnostic image quality criteria for six main groups of examinations: cranium, face and neck, spine, ehest, abdomen and pelvis, and bones and joints. The image criteria refer to characteristic features of imaged anatomical structures with a specific degree of visibility. The usability of the image quality criteria in c1inical practice has been evaluated in a multicenter pilot study for five types of examinations: 1) face and sinuses, 2) vertebral trauma, 3) HRCT of the lung, 4) liver and spleen, and 5) osseous pelvis.

Areas of concern and fields of potential action are the justification for the individual study, the applied dose, the diagnostic quality of the study and the competent interpretation. The \"Quality Criteria for Computed Tomography\" are an effort to make use of basic principles used in conventional radiography looking at only two of these factors: dose and diagnostic quality. The diagnostic criteria, problematic already for the highly standardized conventional studies, try to name those structures whose visualization also ensures the visualization of pathology -a less than perfect but pragmatic approach. The dose evaluation is hampered by the variation between scanner types, the large number of different specific CT studies and their comparative complexity as weil as by the ongoing technological and methodological improvements: CT is a \"moving target\". The collection of base data concerning dose (reference dose value) and tube current for general recommendations requires large, costly studies which are hitherto available only for a few study types. The reference dose for some high frequency CT studies has been based for a large part on surveys in the UK and represents third-quartile values of the observed dose distribution. It must not be seen as a fixed value but represents a pragmatic starting point for an evolving program. The impact of these values may be nonexisting or even negative if they are not applied in repetitive surveys with large numbers of participants from all levels of the radiological community, that document current usage, aid the participants in tuning their hardware and protocols and -in turn -document the induced improvement. Such an improvement -\"raison d' \u00e4tre\" and objective of the whole effort -has been beautifully documented -in US-American programs. With all inherent problems, the \"Quality Criteria for Computed Tomography\" represent a set of tools , with which the collective dose due to CT in Europe could definitely be reduced. lt should be born in mind , however, that cost conscious \"evidence based medicine\" schemes defining and enforcing proper indications for particular CT studies as weil as regulatory measures ensuring sufficient diagnostic expertise may weil have a higher impact on the collective dose due to CT than any other act ion.",

Brain death is the state of irrevers ible cessation of all cerebral and brainstem functions, despite continued cardiopulmonary activity, mainta ined by advanced life-support systems and mechanical ventilation. Brain death is always associated with absence of intracranial circulation. The diagnosis of brain deat h is only possible with certa in \"conditio sine qua non\" Diagnosis: The intracranial circulation comes to an arrest when the intracranial pressure (ICP) rises, exceeding the mean arterial blood pressure for a long period. Multimodal ity monitoring in the intensive care unit helps in selecting patients who are possible brain death, but cannot be used as a legal confirmatory test for brain death because the sampies comes from a small brain volume",

Parotid tumours are benign in about 75% of cases, pleomorphic adenoma being the most common histologic tumour type (80%), followed bij adenolymphoma (15%). Malignant tumours make up about 25% of parotid tumours and they are histologically divers. Small malignant tumours resemble benign lesions and only in case of infiltration into adjacant structures and bone erosion by tumour a malignant nature can be predicted correctly by imaging. Pleomorphic adenomas must be surgically removed because they become highly malignant tumours in the long run. Adenolymphomas do not have malignant potential. In many cases the clinician knows the nature of a palpable mass before imaging is requested. imaging is needed to show the exact localization and extension of the lesion: within or outwith the parotid gland, superficial or deep l.e, simple parotidectomy with virtual no risk of damage to the facial nerve or a total parotidectomy risking damage to the facial nerve.

We report our experience with both devices in the i1iac and subclavian artery. Subclavian artery occlusion is an accepted indication for endovascular treatment. Using a transaxillary approach, the occluded segment is recanalized using a hydrophilie guide wire followed by balloon angioplasty. We use an undersized angioplasty balloon (for example 5 mm) for the initial dilatation.

Local fibrinolysis is not regularly performed, but is an additonal option if mechanical recanalization fails. After recanalization, PTA with a 5 mm balloon is performed followed by implantation of a selfexpandable stent. Balloon expandable stents are only used for special indications. In cases with lesions close to the aortic bifurcation , a double stent technique is used to avoid overlapping of the ostium of the contralateral i1iac artery.

IR is bound to the presence of capable imaging equipment. Surgery traditionally needs to open the body to be able to reach and act on the lesion to be treated. The open approach accounts for a major part of the iatrogenic morbidity added to the natural course of the underlying disease. Even then the surgeon can not normally look beyond the exposed surfaces. Surgery is bound to the presence of a sterile operating environment. The limitation of both approaches can be overcome in an integrated approach, where modern imaging equipment is introduced into a sterile surgical environment.

The causal relationship is uncertain but the radiology of c1assical gout is mostly typical. CPPD crystals cause aeute arthritis (pseudogout) when they are shed as superficial layers of hyaline cartilage in which they are present are stripped or worn off. A hypertrophic form of osteoarthritis (OA), originally described in some such patients, suggests a degree of disease modification. However inconsistencies occur in this apparent relationship. lt is more likely that crystals, produced by chondrocytes, and hypertrophic osteophytosis (also a \"repair\" mechanism by chondrocytes), refleet two parallel responses to joint failure. Differences in crystal morphology are described between those found in pseudogout, and those in hypertrophic OA Further the distinction between \"crystal\" and \"non crystal\" OA may be artifieial. BCP crystals in joints appear to reflect another mechanism. Initially thought responsible for rapidly destructive arthritis (particularly of the shoulder) it is now clear that many such erystals represent\"bone dust\", It is possible that bone failure to joint insults may reflect a more generalised inability of the patient to resist bone damage. Further the presenee of BCP in joint fluid may be anormal finding. The radiology of eaeh \"crystal\" arthritis will be reviewed, but emphasis will be placed on the causal relationships between crystals and arthritis. The term seronegative spondyloarthritis has been introdueed by Moll et al in 1974 to distinguish a group of heterogenous inflammatory rheumatic deseasses from rheumatoid arthritis. The spondyloarthritides eonsist of several rheumatic diseases: ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis and Reiter's syndrome, entheropathie arthritls (Crohn's desease, ulcerative eolitis), juvenile ehronie arthritis and undifferentiated spondyloarthritis. A controversial candidate is pustular arthrosteitis (SAPHO syndrome). Pathoanatomieally, two types of joint deseases oecur in the seronegataive spondyloarthritides: an inflammatory enthesopathy and a peripheral inflammatory arthritis. Inflammatory enthesopathy affeets different sites of ligamentous insertions into the bone, most often the insertions of ligaments around intervertebral dises and the saeroiliae joints, which is the reason for the name of the whole group (spondyloarthritis). The synovium in peripheral arthropathy is changed in a way similar 8:30-10:00",

In breathhold techniques, the entire lung vascularisation can be delineated and thromboemboli can be detected. Clinical experience still is Iimited, but the potential of MRI is given to demonstrate a superiority over CT due to improved demonstration of peripheral disease and due to a more comprehensive display of the reconstruction. The last two decades AIDS has become one of the most devastating illnesses in human history. Not long aga the concept of retroviral infection rewriting the genetic code and causing destruction of the immune system was in the realm of science fiction. The AIDS epidemie differs from most other diseases in many ways, has challenged conventional medical thinking and has broadened the boundaries of knowledge of human biology and medicine. The patterns of disease and pathological changes seen in AIDS patients can be perplexing and challenging, particularly in the Medical Imaging department. As the epidemie continues to spread, AIDS patients are no longer confined to a few specialized AIDS hospitals, and are now seen in general hospitals and clinics everywhere.",

The imaging aspects of the diseases of the gastrointestinal tract (conventional double contrast, ultrasound, CT) will be systematically discussed in two parts (Part I: lumenal gastrointestinal tract, part 11: solid abdominal organs). Candidiasis, cytomegalovirus, cryptosporidiosis, histoplasmosis, isosporiasis, salmonella, toxoplasmosis and unusual mycobacteria account for a majority of non-neoplastic disorders. Neoplasms include Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and high-grade B-cell lymphomas. Multiple sites may be involved in significant numbers of patients. As radiologie experience accumulates, the predominant radiographie patterns will become more clearly defined. This course will produce a cohesive account of AIDS, that will educate and guide GIradiologie practice. It is the hope, that the coming years will see light shed upon our current state of ignorance of this baffling affliction. Conventional coronary arteriography (CA) is the standard of excellence for the evaluation of coronary artery disease. However, non-invasive imaging modalities have developed that can play an important c1inical role. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can offer a comprehensive evaluation of the heart and the coronaries by virtue of its high soft tissue contrast capabilities, double-oblique tomographie sections and the possibility to quantify many physiological parameters without the need of ionizing radiation or contrast agents. Magnetic resonance coronary arteriography (MRCA) using breath-hold and free-breathing techniques have been investigated but are still traversing an experimental phase to identify their precise role for the assessment of coronary stenosis. Nonetheless, MRCA has proven clinically relevant to determine the course of anomalous coronary arteries and patency of bypass grafts. Novel intravascular contrast agents promise faster coverage of the cardiac anatomy and may provide the long awaited essential boost for MRCA. Contrast-enhanced electron-beam computed tomography (EBT), another competing imaging modality, has also begun a widespread evaluation following initial encouraging results.",

Since 5 years a device of the Fischer Company Mammotest and Mammovision are in use. Until 5 years aga localisations were done with Indian ink. Sterile Indian ink and a sterile 4% mixture of carbon and saline were used. In recent years we have been using Cook X-reidy's localisation needles, wh ich are available in 3 sizes. For breast biopsies, 11 and 14 gauge needles are used with a BARO high-speed applicator or vacuum-assisted breast biopsy cannulas. Results: The B/M index in preoperative localisations has changed. In the beginning of interventional activity it was 1:2. Subsequently it changed to 2.5 benign to 1 malignant finding. Thanks to stereotactic biopsy methods the B/M index has changed in favour of malignant lesions. In stereotactic core biopsies the rate of error in the various systems varies between 2 and 3 per cent. Conclusion: Lesions that are suspected to be malignant are preferably localised before surgery, while lesions that are probably benign are usually subjected to biopsy. Upon the referring physician's request, an increasing number of malignant lesion are subject to preoperative histologic clarification; the ratio between referring physicians and radiologists is 1:1. 795 B. Stereotaxy versus ultrasound guided biopsies R.Ch. Ollo; Baden/CH Imaging techniques like mammography or sonography (as weil as others) demonstrate focal tissue alterations quite weil, however, they often do not permit to indicate the definite diagnosis of these in respect to their benign or malignant character. This statement signifies that their sensitivity is high, while their specificity remains low which is inadequate for correct evaluation and treatment. In this dilemma guided biopsy and tissue examination may be helpful. Fine needle punctures with aspiration of tissues allow material to be collected for cytological or bacteriological evaluation and furthermore are used for the evacuation of cysts. The larger biopsy needles permit to get larger tissus sampies which can be investigated histologically. Fine needle biopsies and core biopsies have different advantages and disadvantages. Their accuracy depends not only on the needle type, but on the guidance method of sampling (ultrasound guidance oder stereotaxy) and especially on the ski 11 and experience of the person who is responsible for performing the biopsy. The results of more than 400 cases are discussed. Ultrasound guided biopsy and stereotaxy are described in detail. The presence of necrosis or hemorrhage may cause problems for exact interpretation, but the whole interventional procedure is absolutely dependent on the experience of the operator. As weil a technician has to be ready to spread the material immediately onto the slides and then fix or air dry these slides correctly to maintain constantly high-quality smears. The accuracy in different studies ist between 72% and 94%.

Azavedo; Stockho/m/S Cytology has been used since late fifties to plan both conservative and surgical treatment of palpable lumps in a breast. Ouring the last decade or so larger needles have been used to obtain tissue fragments for histological assessment but the techniques are not competitors of each other. Modern breast imaging technology early cancers but also early cell/tissue changes of which some may represent neoplastic changes. The laller type of lesions are sometimes more confidently diagnosed with larger sampies than with individual cells. While availability of trained cytologists is limited the same can be the case with histopathologists. A histopathologist reading core biopsies should have special expertise in breast pathology especially to evaluate borderline lesions and/or early cancers. Cytology does demand a skilIed performer of the FNA in order to get an acceptable sam pie and the result of a FNA has to be integrated with the corresponding breast image to get the final diagnosis even in the case of malignancies. Core biopsies can be performed by less skilied personnel since stereotactic techniques have always been able to target alesion with \u00b11 mm precision. Cytology specimens can be stained and read while the patient is still on the examination table and histology specimens need around 2 days before the result is ready. Core biopsies allow the possibility to judge whether a carcinoma is invasive or not. This is helpful in planning type of surgery but in cases where cores only show CIS we know that it is not the whole truth in all cases. This delicate issue can be satisfactorily dealth with with cytology without depreciating the need and value of cores which of course play an important role in breast diagnostics. Spinal cord development occurs through two consecutive periods: primary neurulation (18 th_27th day) produces the uppermost 9/10 of spinal cord, whereas secondary neurulation and retrogressive differentiation (28 th-48th day) results in the conus tip and filum terminale. Oefective primary or secondary neurulation produces spinal dysraphisms, characterized by anomalous differentiation and fusion of dorsal midline structures. However, the most complicated forms (complex dysraphic states) may be related to gastrulation, the formation of the three embryonie layers prior to neurulation Spinal dysraphisms states may be categorized c1inically in two subsets.

Imaging is important in staging the disease, with emphasis on myometrial and cervical stromaI invasion and Iymph node status. MR imaging has proved superior to both CT and ultrasound in the identification of tumor size, locatlon, depth of stromal invasion, parametrial invasion, and loco-regional extent. MR imaging is the method of choice for planning radiotherapy and provides the best information for differentiating postoperative scar from recurrent tumor. CT and MR imaging proved to be versatile imaging modalities for characterization of primary ovarian neoplasms. With both modalities, tumor size, wall thickness, presence of vegetations and solid structures are criteria for lesion characterization. However, CT remains the primary imaging modality for presurgical staging of the whole abdomen and pelvis. Learning Objective: To get acquainted with the normal appearance of the female pelvis on MR images and to understand the potential impact of imaging on patient management in cases of endometrial, cervical andovarian cancer. The ehest radiograph remains the single most common imaging procedure in the world accounting for up to 30%-40% of all conventional radiologie examinations performed in Europe as weil as in the United States. In spite of its high frequency of performance obtaining a high quality ehest radiograph remains one of the greatest challenges in diagnostic imaging. Conventional film-screen radiography has been the standard radiologie medium for ehest radiography because of its semplicity, low cost, excellent spatial resolution and sensitivity. However there are limitations in its ability to provide optimal contrast in both the lungs and mediastinum. Current film screen radiographie technique requires a compromise between the need for adequate contrast in local regions of the ehest and overall image latitude. Limitations of conventional film-screen systems are more pronounced in bedside radiography. This course will explore various approaches that have been developed to produce consistently high-quality ehest radiographs. Techniques utilizing conventional screen-film combinations and equipment will be presented as weil the rationales for specific choices and combinations.

MRI has particular value in showing the extent of superior sulcus tumours, neoplastic involvement of the aorto-pulmonary window and the sub-carinal region and vascular invasion. MRI can also provide useful information about mediastinal masses, the aorta and great veins. Neither cardiac MRI or pulmonary parenchymal imaging will be discussed in this particular refresher course.

Different imaging techniques can be used to assess the more Iikely diagnosis and the precise extent of the disease. Generally, the choice among ultrasound, C'I, MR and angiography, or their combined use, depends both on clinical data -such as the age of the patient, symptoms, history -and the specific location of the mass. For example, if an infrahyoid neck mass is detectable by US, its content (liquid, vascular, solid) can be properly assessed (with the aid of echocolour Doppler techniques) or citology easily provided by ultrasoundguided FNA. Conversely, if the lesion extends into deep spaces, i.e, the retropharyngeal and perivertebral spaces, CT or MR are required to precise its relationships with the spine and neural structures. Lesions arising from the visceral space (pharynx, larynx, trachea, thyroid, parathyroid gland) or from the thoraeie inlet need CT or MR because of the limitation of US in examining structures in close proximity of airways and the mediaslinum. Particular attention should be paid 10 bacterial infections which arise from the oral cavity (dental disease) or pharynx because they may give rise to cellulitis or to abscesses with eventual spread along the adjacent fascial planes toward the skull base or into the mediastinum (from the supra and infrahyoid neck, respectively) . The purpose of this part of the video workshop is to describe the current status of MR-guided percutaneous biopsies of the abdomen and the musculoskeletal system. For MR guided biopsies, different types of biopsy needles for soft tissues and for skeletal biopsies are commercially available. Like in other biopsy procedures, the appropriate needle choice depends on the tissue to be characterized. Whenever possible, a cutting needle is recommended to provide enough material for a histologie work-up. For skeletal biopsies, either a cutting needle or a drilling system for sclerotic lesions is required. Lesion targeting can be performed manually or by active instrument tracking on open MR systems, which allow interactive positioning and guidance of the biopsy device. For control of the biopsy pathway and the correct needle position within the target, either fast gradient echo techniques or fast spin echo techniques may be used, depending on the tissue contrast, which enhances the lesion most effectively. Current indications for MR-guided biopsies include aillesions, which are only or better visualized on MR like some liver tumors or bone marrow edemas of unknown etiology.

In spite of the excellent detail depicted at CT and the superior soft tissue discrimination of MR imaging, UsgFNAC proves to be the most accurate technique for the assessment of the status of the neck. Ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration cytology has gained popularity in staging the clinically NO neck in patients with head and neck carcinomas. On the one hand it can be used to upstage the NO neck, thus enabling adequate treatment, on the other hand it can give more certainty that the neck is really free of metastases. The reported sensitivity of US-g-FNAC in the NO neck ranges from 44% by Takes (Radiology, 1996) , 50% by Righi (Head Neck 1997) and 73% by our group (Radiology 1993). In our clinic, in the last 3 years we conducted a study in which US-g-FNAC negative patients, who in the past would have had an elective neck dissection, were now followed at regular intervals with palpation and US-g-FNAC. However, if the neck had to be entered for resection of the primary tumor, or for reconstruction of the defect, an elective neck dissection was carried out. In aseries of 92 US-g-FNAC NO patients, who were followed for 1-3 years 19 (21%) developed a neck node metastasis. Six of these 19 died of distant metastases or locoregional recurrence, one is alive with distant metastases and two died of unknown cause without metastases or locoregional recurrence. The characteristics of these patients will be discussed in terms of level, number and extranodal spread of metastases and delay of treatment.

Room I Contrast-enhanced 3D MR Angiography is emerging as the primary non-invasive technique for assessing arterial vascular pathology. The availability of intravascular contrast agents permits updates over a time period extending beyond 3 hours provides a basis for guiding intravascular interventions. For this purpose catheters and wires must be adapted for use in the MR environment. Materials must be totally non-ferromagnetic, and must provide a means of visualization within the vascular system itself. Electrically active approaches, requiring the implementation of small signal receiving antennas can be employed for instrument visualisation. The anten na receives signal, based on which it can be localized in three dimensions. This technique permits the display of the position of up to 4 instruments in real time (20 updates/sec) simultaneously in two planes. Furthermore, the active availability of spatial coordinates corresponding to the position of the anten na allow for the continuous acquisition of update images traversing the antenna itself. The technique can be modified to depict a longer region of the instrument, and has been employed to guide antenna equipped catheters and guide-wires for various applications. Preliminary 'in vivo' intravascular interventions such as embolization, PTA and TIPS have been successfully completed in animals. In addition, early experience with MR-guided PTA in humans will be shown. Similar to conventional angiography, MRA only displays the vascular lumen and does not depict the vascular walls. The concept of interventional MRA permits to overcome this limitation. By integrating an imaging coil into the balloon of a PTA catheter images with an in plane resolution below 150 um can be obtained of the vascular wall.",

Radiologist should enrol themselves actively into the process of surgical planning and feel as a \"third man\" or a pilot who, together with the anaesthesiologist, assists the surgeon to accomplish his tasks. Image synthesis can be described as to consist of three steps: (1) Image acquisition and preparation of data sets in a dedicated fashion (tailored imaging), (2) surgical planning and communication, and (3) performance of image-guided surgery with or without robotics. Besides neurosurgical applications, navigation during surgical procedures of bony structures has shown to be attractive because tissue movements are of minor relevance. In maxillo-facial surgery special attention has been drawn on navigation during reconstructive and orthognatic surgery. In otorhinolaryngology, surgical treatment of the skull and the paranasal sinuses are main indications for navigation. Computer-assisted orthopaedic surgery is mainly performed for spinal screw fixation and robot-assisted implantation of hip prostheses.",

Radiographers are in many cases the patient's front line defence against excessive ionising radiation exposure; Radiographers are the individuals best able to limit the dose of the public to ionising radiation. Some studies have shown that some Radiographers have an apathetic attitude in practising radiation protection. These individuals are practising radiation protection only by mandate of law or departmental rules and they bring a declining professional role for the Radiographer that can never be recovered. The reasons of not being actively involved in radiation protection, the personal practical knowledge demonstrated by Radiographers and the degree of utilisation of practical radiation measures are thoroughly investigated in the first part of this refresher course. The practice of radiation protection requires, along with knowledge, a professional attitude that includes motivation, a willingness to educate others and leadership.

Definitive confirmation or exclusion of pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with c1inical suspicion of the disease is one of the most common c1inical tasks the radiologist has to face in the everyday practice. Radiologie techniques, l.e. pulmonary angiography and, more recently, spiral-CT-angiography, are indeed often required to determine whether anticoagulation has to be initiated or not in patients in whom previous c1inical and instrumental examinations are not conclusive. According to the PIOPED study (JAMA 1990; 263:2753-97) PAG is required in the vast majority (>70%) of patients with clinicaJ suspicion of PE. In fact, most of the literature studies aimed to establish cost-effective diagnostic strategies for PE are based on the deeply ingrained notion that the disease can be diagnosed or excluded by clinical evaluation and V/Q scan only in a minority of patients. For this reason the diagnostic strategies suggested sofar consider that most patients should undergo definitive radiologie testing. This widely held belief has been recently challenged by the results of a large scale prospective trial (PISA-PED) (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 1996;154:1387-93) showing that 1) accurate diagnosis of PE (sensitivity 92%, specificity 87%) is possible by perfusion scanning (Q scan) alone without ventilation, 2) combination of Q scan with clinical assessment (overall rate of correct c1inical classification 81%) helps to restriet the need for definitive testing to a minority of patients with suspected PE. Indeed, by relying only on clinical and Q scan data, PE could be confirmed or excluded in 76% of patients with abnormal Q scan with an accuracy of 97%. By applying decision analysis to a population of 1130 consecutive patients with c1inical suspicion of PE we found that the clinical decision to treat or withhold treatment can be made without further testing in 88% (742/845) of patients with abnormal Q scan by coupling prior clinical probability with Q scan result. In summary: 1) definitive radiologie tests to confirm or exclude PE should be applied to a limited proportion of the whole population of patients clinically suspected of PE by a radiologist aware of the pre-test probability of the disease; 2) the accuracy of the radiologie tests will be positively affected by the knowledge of the anatomie location of the perfusion defect(s) as obtained by Q scan.

To facilitate the assessment of subsegmental vessels, the lung volume scanned should span from the dome of the diaphragm to the top of the aortic arch. Commonly, imaging is performed using a slice thickness of 3 mm, a table speed of 5 mm/second (pitch 1.7) and a reconstruction index of 2 mm. The value of narrowing collimation to 2 mm for the analysis of subsegmental vessels has recently been demonstrated. While various contrast injection techniques have been identified as suitable for the assessment of PE, a high concentration -high flow approach (4 mi/sec, 300 mg I/mi) seems to yield the best results. Image interpretation in SCTA relies on the direct visualization of pulmonary emboli which appear as hypoattenuating filling defects within the contrast enhanced blood. Misinterpretations may be triggered by breathing artifacts, and by perivascular tissue in the hilar region mimicking PE.",

The role of spiral-CT in the evaluation of patient with suspected PE is still under discussion.

In conjunction with the intravenous administration of T1-shortening contrast agents the pulmonary vasculature can be selectively displayed. In contrast to CTA, 3D MRA permits full visualization and assessment of the pulmonary arteries to a subsegmental level, Various techniques have been proposed and evaluated on Iimited patient groups. Thus the 3D data sets can be collected in the coronal or the sagittal planes. The former depicts both lungs within the same 3D acquisition, albeit at the price of a longer acquisition period. Patients suffering from extreme dyspnea may therefore benefit from the latter approach, in which the lungs are being imaged seperately. Beyond permitting use of a partial field-of-view and a reduction of the number of sections required to cover the pulmonary arteries, the sagittal acquisition provides better antero-posterior coverage and eliminates pulsatility artefacts emanating from the heart. Furthermore, it reduces the data acquisition time to below 15 seconds. Since breathholding must be considered mandatory for maximal image quality, the sagittal, !wo-Iung imaging approach appears better suited for assessing patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. Initial work had been based upon the use of extracellular, Gd-based contrast agents. While the coronal approach requires only a single contrast injection, the sagittal approach mandates a dose split, Clinical results regarding the detection of pulmonary emboli have been excellent with both techniques: sensitivity and specificity values beyond 90% have been reported. More recently, intravascular contrast agents have entered Phase land 11 evaluations in humans. By causing considerable shortening of Ti-relaxation times, these agents permit the selective display of the arterial vasculature over time frames extending beyond 2-3 hours. The intravascular nature of these agents permits for repeated vessel imaging. Suspicius appearing regions of the pulmonary vasculature can be imaged repeatedly in greater detail. Furthermore, the deep venous system of the pelvis and lower extremity could be assessed in the same sitting also using the fast 3D imaging techniques.",

Same of these are imaging-based and designed to directly detect or exclude PE, such as VQ-Iung scanning, pulmonary angiography, spiral CT, and potentially, MRA of the pulmonary arteries. Other tests da not assess the lung vessels per se: Ultrasound of the leg veins, if positive for deep venous thrombosis, will obviate the need for subsequent testing for PE. A negative D-dimer blood assay that excludes fibrin degradation products and thus, thromboembolic disease, also obviates further testing for PE. Also, efforts are being undertaken to develop \"clinical decision rules\", to classify patients as having low or high probability of thromboembolic diease based on standardized physical examination. Each of these tests has its own specific merits and drawbacks. The challenge is to develop an optimal diagnostic strategy that makes use of a combination of these tests, in terms of either absolute performance or cost-effectiveness. A useful way to approach this problem is to perform an analysis of cost-effectiveness using a mathematical model (Preliminary analyses have indicated that ultrasound of leg veins followed by spiral-CT is optimal). Because of inherent limitations of such a theoretical analysis, the most promising strategies should then be prospectively tested in randomized trials. A prospective randomized trial with this goal will start in the Netherlands in the autumn of 1998, funded by the Dutch government, in 4 university centers and 2 community hospitals. Only the TSE-T2 sequence with 200 ms TE was analyzed. Quantitative analysis: measurement of the lesionlliver ratio. Qualitative analysis: independent assessment by two radiologists in a blinded fashion of the signal intensity of the lesion, labelling it as hiperintense (equallhigher than fat) or isointense (equallhigher than Iiver). Results: The average ratio for metastases was 1.95 and 6.5 for hemangiomas. 100% of the hemangiomas were hyperintense and only 5% of the metastases. Agreement belween radiologists was 94%. Conclusion: The TSE-T2 sequence with TE of 200 ms. contributes significantly to the differential diagnosis between benign lesions and metastases of colorectal adenocarcinoma, avoiding the use of Gadolinium in many cases. The absence of hyperintensity has a predictive value of 100% for metastases and its presence has a predictive value of 94% for benign lesions.

Results: CT has been established to allow to reveal both the damage of the whole wall of the rectum and the exit of tumor from it. LCS methods allowed to set essential inclinations in blood-plasma homeostasis which consist in the significant evaluation of the low-molecular fractions. These changes are enhanced related to the prevalence of tumoral process. Conclusion: Possibilities of CT for determ ining the damage of definite structures of the rectum are Iimited. Accuracy of CT for determining patholog ic changes in regional and juxstaregional Iymphatic nodes was 0.82. CT is highly informative technique for diagnosis of regional rectal cancer metastases.

            "text": "Purpose: to compare conventional DSA with a contrast-enhanced 30-MR-angiogaphy for identifying and evalualing arteries of the foot before peripheral bypass surgery was planned. Methods and Materials: 24 feet of 24 patients with diabetes and limb threaten ing lower extremity ischemia were prospectively studied by 30-MR-angiography (MRA). All patients underwent either conventional DSA or selective fine-needle DSA of the diseased extremity within 1 week. MR imaging was performed at 1.5 T with use of the head coil. A 30-Flash sequence with the following parameters was performed: TRITE =3.8/1.3 ms, Flip =35 0 , pixel size 1.69 x 1.12 mm 2 , interpolated slice thickness 1.2 mm, acquisition time = 18 or 24 seconds (256 or 512 matrix). 4 sets of identical sagittal slabs were acquired consecutively. IV bolus injection of 20 ml of Gd-DTPA (Magnevist\u00ae, Schering) was applied during the first set. Angiograms after image subtraction were created using the Maximum Intensity Projection algorithm . Image ana lysis comprised the detection of patent, stenosed or occluded vessel segments. One vascular surgeon formulated treatment plans based on the conventional angiograms. He then formulated treatment plans based on DSA and MRA together. Results: Compared to DSA, MRA sign ificantiy better demonstrated the per ipheral \"run-off\" vessels (p < 0.001 , Mc Nemar test) . In 9 cases , it demonstrated patent pedal vessels that were not seen with conventional DSA. Due to the results of MRA , treatment plans changed in 8/9 cases , where these patent vessels were subsequently used as target vessels for distal pedal bypass grafts . Conclusion: Ultrafast contrast-enhanced subtraction 3D MR-angiography is a useful adjunct to conventional DSA before distal pedal bypass surgery. Purpose: To evaluate the capability of a high-resolution 3D-MRA technique to image the lower Iimb arteries in patients with PAOD in a clinical sett ing . Methods and Materials: The ent ire lower limb was imaged with three coi! positions: 1. body coi! -renal arteries to femoral bifurcation, 2. body coi! -femoral bifurcation to popliteal arteries, and 3. phasedarray-coi! -popliteal arteries to distal tibial arteries. I.a.-DSA served as the gold standard and was performed <24 h following MR-angiography with a total of 722 vessel segments imaged in 24 patients. MRA was performed with a 3D-FISP sequence using the following parameters: TR 4.5 ms, TE 1.7 ms, FA 30 0 , 200 x 512 matrix with a rectangular FOV, 0.82 x 1.58 pixel size , 100-1 10 slab thickness, 32-38 partitions , and an acquisition time of 23-27 s. Contrast injection was done by apower injector following measurement of individual circulation limes. The individual injeclion rate (1.0-2.0 ml/s) was adjusted to the patients bodyweight to cover >60% of the acquisition time and a dose of 0.1 mmol Gd-DTPA/kg bodyweight was used for each position. Vascular lesions were c1assified by two readers using a five-point-scale : 1. 0-50% , 2. 51-90%, 3. >90%, 4. occlusion , and 5. aneurysm . Results: Image quality allowed interpretation of MR angiograms with a sensitivity of 93%. Venous overlay was sometimes present in calf vessels in patients with long-circulation times, however, calf vessels were more often better visualized by means of Gd-MRA than by La.-DSA. Conclusion: The study demonstrates that 3D-Gd-enhanced-subtraction MRA studies can be performed in a clinical setting accurately dernonstrating PAOD. The method is ready to replace diagnostic La.-DSA , however, is equally time consuming with app . 60 min for the entire study. To determine the feasibility and accuracy of high resolution contrast enhanced Turbo-MRA (CE-MRA) in the evaluat ion of patients with obstructive peripheral arteriopathy. Methods and Materials: 16 patients with peripheral obstructive arteriopathy were examined with a 1.5 T magnet using a 3D T1 w. FISP (TRITE/NEX: 4.6/1.8/1; TA =23 seconds; Matrix =195 x 512) repeated 3 times (aorta and ilio-femoral axes, thigh and calt) each after i.v, bolus injection with apower injector of 20 ml of nonionic paramagnelic contrast agent. A phased-array coil was used to examine the abdomen, while the body coil was employed to evaluate the lower extremiti es. MIP reconstructions In all patients DSA was also performed. Results: In all cases CE-MRA provided diagnostic exams; correct demonstration of level and degree of stenosis was obtained in all 16 patients; in 12 cases iliac-femoral stenoses were demonstrated, with involvement of the arterial tree of the lower extremilies in 13 patients. Results comparable to DSA were obta ined in all cases . Conclusion: CE-MRA pravides allows complete evaluation of the arterial peripheral axis . Further techn ical improvements will allow acqu isition after single injection of contrast agent and reduce examination time , which is already acceptable (approximately 5 minutes). Corresponding mask scans were obtained before injection and subtracted afterwards. 100 patients (mean age 61, 70 males, 80/20 with moderate/severe claudication) scheduled for duplex ultrasonography also underwent MRA . Intra-arterial DSA was used as standard of reference in cases in which either or both techniques showed presence of >50% stenoses (HSS) . MRA was evaluated by two radiologists in blinded fashion. Kappa statist los were determined between DSA and MRAIduplex, respectively. Results: Of 600 vessel segments imaged with duplex and MRA 12% were discordant for presence of HSS . In 59% corresponding DSA results were present. Of discordances between MRA and duplex , MRA was the true positive exam ination in 67% of cases. Kappa values are 0.57 for duplex and 0.77 for MRA. Conclusion: MoBI-track MRA is a good alternative for duplex ultrasonography. Purpose: To evaluate the capability of high resolution MRI for identifyin9 long-term changes of the arterial wall after percutaneous rheolytic thrombectomy in patients with acute lower limb ischemia. Methods and Materials: Arterial wall and luminal changes were evaluated in 16 patients (10 men; 6 women; mean age 70 years) with a minimal follow-up of 12 months after thrambectomy with the AngioJet\u00ae catheter for acute lower limb ischemia. The initial occlusions were located in the superficial femoral artery (n = 7), popliteal artery (n =6) or a femoral-popliteal-bypass graft (n =3). The mean follow-up was 23 \u00b1 7.6 months. High resolution MRI and MRA were performed on a 1.0 T Magnetom Experf'\" system using an extremity coil and 20 TOF-, TSE-, 20 FLASH and contrast enhanced 3D FLASH-sequences. Results: In 2 of 16 patients, complete reocclusions were noted, and in 3 of 16 patients a moderate restenosis (~50%) was identified using MRI and MRA techniques. This was in accordance with color flow duplex sonography, physical examination, ankle brachial index and the treadmill test. 2D-high resolution MRI did not show excessive neointimal hyperplasia in any case. Conclusion: The long-term results demonstrate efficacy and safety of the thrombectomy catheter. There was no evidence for excessive intimal hyperplasia using high resolution MRI and MRA techniques. MR of the arterial wall can provide valuable information concerning vessel wall and plaque morphology to identify causes of restenosis. ",

            "text": "Purpose: Practically, CE MRA of the entire peripheral circulation is most difficult, since a large vessel distance has to be covered and the limitation of the total dose to max. 0.3 mmol/kg body weight Gd has to be considered. Therefore, most published studies so far applied only a relatively rough scaling scheme for evaluation of stenoses. Methods and Materials: First, at two patients (50 and 87 kg BW) a 3D CE MRA was performed. Different Gd-injection protocols were used: 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 ml/s flow rate (30 ml NaCI flush) for each patient applying 0.1 and 0.2 mmol/ml Gd dose respectively. The entire bolus length at iliac and popliteal artery was measured by 20 time resolved GE-sequence. The resulting 3D in plane resolution was compared to slice select resolution after reconstruction of the data set in coronal and sagital views. Secondly, different 3D resolution optimized CE MRA protocols were developed in order to achieve the optimal image quality regarding to c1inical focused question. 21 patients with PAOD were investigated to visualize the entire peripheral circulation by CE MRA Following issues were varried: (1) coil handling, (2) spacial resolution, (3) contrast bolus geometry. A new formula for calculation of flow rate as a result of predefined CE MRA image resolution and Gd dose will be introduced. FR = BW . Dappl . BDF/(5s+ 60%MT) . c Gd (FR =\u00fcow rate, 0 =dose, BDF =bolus dilution factor, MT =measurement time, C = concentration) Results: Shorter acquisition time saves Gd but at cost of spatial resolution. Visualization of the lower leg arteries at vessel diameters below 2 or 3 mm and the entire collateral circulation system in case of occlusions requires adjusted optimized CE MRA protocols. The problems of resolution and different CM application protocols regarding a valid grading of stenoses and optimal image quality will be discussed. The results demonstrate that small voxel sizes are required for c1inical MRA when the correct grading of a stenosis affects therapeutical decision. Conclusion: The adjustment of sequence parameters and bolus geometry is necessary to achieve an effective use of CM for optimal angiographic image quality. Purpose: Assessing the diagnostic efficacy of a 3D MRA strategy combining a dedicated coil with a single injection, 2-station protocol to display the arterial system from the aortic bifurcation to the lower extremity runoff. Methods and Materials: MRA with a dedicated peripheral vascular coil (Medical Advances) was performed on 61 patients following convennonat DSA for suspectect peripheral vascular disease. The vasculature was displayed in two 3D GRE acquisitions (TRITE 5.2/1.5 ms, flip 30 0 , 2.4 mm slice thickness, 48 sections), each extending over 48 cm and collected over 30 sec. The acquisitions were separated bya 10 second break, during which the MR-table was manually repositioned. A dose of 0.3 mmol/kg Gd-DTPA was injected intravenously using an automated injector (Medrad) over 70 s. In a prospective blinded analysis each vascular segment (29 segments per patient) was evaluated for the presence of occlusive vessel disease. The following grading system was applied: 0-normal, 1-vessel irregularity with a luminal reduction of less than 10%, 2-mild stenosis (lumen reduction 10-49%), 3-severe stenosis (lumen reduction 50-99%) or occlusion. Results: MRA provided image quality comparable to DSA with an overall sensitivity and specificity of 92 and 96.6% for the detection of hemodynamically significant disease and 92.3% and 99.4% for the detection of occlusions. Conclusion: The diagnostic performance of the outlined MRA strategy with a dedicated lower extremity vascular coil was sufficient to consider MRA a noninvasive alternative to DSA in the assessment of the lower extremity arterial vasculature. imager, using phased array multicoil. After a timing bolus, + 0.1 mmol gadopentetate dimeglumine/kg was injected at a rate of 2.5 mi/sec using power injector. Intra-arterial DSA was method of reference. Doppler ultrasound was performed by two independent vascular radiographers. Two independent observers assessed CE-MRA; two other observers assessed DSA Infrarenal aorta, common and external i1iac arteries were evaluated (5 segments). Results: Compared to DSA, CE-MRA correctly classified 57/57 nonsignificantly stenotic segments (0-49%), 15/15 significant stenoses (50-99%), 3/3 occlusions and 1/1 Leriche's syndrome. Ultrasound correctly classified 0-49%; 55/57; 50-99%: 14/15; occlusions: 1/3 and Leriche's syndrome: not conclusive. Conclusion: The accuracy of CE-MRA in diagnosing stenosis of aorta and iliac arteries is higher than colour Doppler sonography; all significant stenoses were correctly c1assified. Purpose: Sonographically guided core cut biopsy allows the histological examination of breast tumors without surgery. But only the follow-up of tumors diagnosed as benign by the histology of core cut biopsy can show, whether it is justified to leave these lesions unoperated. Methods and Materials: From 6/92 up to 12/93 we dispensed with breast surgery in 75 patients because histology of core cut biopsy confirmed the diagnosis \"fibroadenoma\". Results: Tumor size ranged between 0.5 and 2.5 cm at time of core cut biopsy. In 5 of 75 tumors, a progression of the tumor size was seen (3-6 mm) and the tumors were removed by the surgeon. The diagnose \"fibroadenoma\" was confirmed in 4 cases. In 1 specimen a ductal carcinoma was found (one year after core cut biopsy). Conclusion: The core cut biopsy guided by sonography ls an adequate and reliable method for the histological confirmation of benign breast tumors if the preconditions such as the correspondence of clinical and histological diagnosis and the performance of close-meshed controls are followed. [1995] [1996] [1997] [1998] with real-time ultrasound (linear scanner: 7.5 MHz, 10 MHz, 13 MHz), colour-imaging and panoramicsonography (siescape, Siemens sonofine elegra\u00ae) as weil as mammography. Method of choice to clarify the assumed diagnosis was highspeed core cut biopsy (16 Gauche). Results: We evaluated 4 cases of breast-cancer, 1 case of lymphoma, 4 cases of adenoma and 7 findings typical for lactation. Though sonography proved to be more sensitive than mammography, ultrasound S194 features were not specific to discriminate between malignant and benign tumors. Especially adenoma and carcinoma were difficult to distinguish. Colour imaging showed no, panoramic-imaging slight advantage. Conclusion: Because of the incidence of malignancy in tumors associated with pregnancy or lactation (\"\" 1 per 1,500 pregnancies) and the mostly non-specific image-providing methods core cut biopsy is recommended for early c1arification. The lesions were evaluated according to 9 ultrasound criterion and were marked 1 or 0 (1 for malignancy criterion, 0 for benign). Our hypothesis was: The lesions marked 0-2 are benign, 3-5 are indetermided and 6-9 are malignant. The maschine Mammomat 3000 and Sonoline S1-40 and Sonoline Versa Pro, all from firma Siemens, were used for examinations. Aspiration biopsy were performed under ultrasound control, method free hand. Results: The study group consisted of 306 women 14-91 years old, the largest group of women were 50-59 years, then 40-49 years old. 9 basic criterion of the ultrasound examination were observed. There were 121 lesions marked 0-1, benign histology was performed in all casses. 52 were marked 3-5, 36 were benign ethiology and 16 were malignant. The last group consist of 133 lesions marked 6-9. 127 were malignt and 6 responded to postoperative changes. Using histology as the \"gold standart\", the senzitivity was 95.49% with specificity of 80.12%. There were 163 benign lesions and 143 malignant lesions from this study group. Conclusion: The number evaluation of the lesions shows the senzitivity 95.49% and the specificity 80, 12%. The lesions marked 0-2 are most Iikely of the benign ethiology. Their examination does not require the aspiration biopsy. The lesions marked 6-9 are refferend to surgical therapy, the aspiration is not necessary. The aspiration biopsy is essentialin the lesions marked 3-5. Purpose: The purpose of this investigation was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of MR arthrography in detecting and grading of subscapularis tendon lesions. Methods and Materials: MR arthrograms of 50 consecutive patients with arthroseopie or surgical confirmation (29 normal subscapularis tendons, 11 with alesion of the cranial quarter of the tendon, 7 with a major tear but not eomplete detachment, 3 with complete detachment) were evaluated independently by two radiologists. Diagnosis was established on axial and parasagittal images separately and in combination. Results: Based on the axial images alone, sensitivity for the diagnosis of a subacapularis tendon abnormality versus normal tendon was 95%/100% (reader 1/2). Speeifieity was 55%/62%. The corresponding values for the parasagittal images alone were 91%/91 %, 76%/90%, and for the combined evaluation 91%/91 %, 86%/80%, respectively. With regard to grading agreement of MR imaging to surgery was good (kappa = 0.71). Several single signs were specific (90%-100%) but insensitive (29%-62%) for subscapularis lesions: Contrast leakage onto the minor tuberosity, fatty degeneration of the subscapularis museie and major biceps tendon abnormalities (luxation, subluxation, tear). Conclusion: MR arthrography has a high accuracy in detecting and grading lesions of the subscapularis tendon. The specifieity ofaxial images for this diagnosis can be improved by including parasagittal images and indirect signs. Forty patients underwent MR-arthrography performed one hour after intravenous injection of 0.2 ml/kg of Gadolinium. Two radiologists analysed separately, firstly, the conventional sequences assessing the size of the meniscal remnant and the presence of tear or not, and secondly, compared the conventional and artrographic sequences. The sensibility, speeificity, and the concordance was calculated. Results: Meniscal remnants bigger or equal to the 2/3 were 25. Meniscus tears in arthroscopy were 32. MR offered a diagnostic accuracy of 50%, which was lower with small meniscal remnants, and a speeifieity below 10%. The diagnostic accuracy of MR-artrography was 63%, increasing the specifieity up to 71%. Concordance between radiologists was 45% with MR and 80% with MR-arthrography. Conclusion: MR-arthrography via i.v, gadolinium injection is a Iittle observer-dependent technique that significantly increases the diagnos- ",

Magnetic resonanee imaging and MR arthographie findings with arthroseopic eorrelation GA Hottya , P.F.J. Tirman, HK Genant; San Francisco, CA/USA Purpose: To demonstrate the magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance arthrography imaging findings in patients with posterior eapsular tear and teres minor injury after posterior dislocation. Methods and Materials: The findings at MR and MR arthrography in four patients with a history of shoulder injury due to posterior dislocation were recorded and correla ted with arthroseopic findings . The mechanism of injury was a posteriorly direeted force against an addueted internally rotated arm . Results: MR imaging findings included: poste rior capsular disruption at or near the interface with the hurnerus, edema within the teres minor and partia l tear of the tendon or muscle , and in one patient associated edema of the infraspinatus muscle. Conclusion: Posterior instability is uncommon , constituting only 2% to 4 % of all shoulder instabilities. Posterior labral tears are not present in all patients with this history and other structures mayaiso be damaged . The teres minor attachment to the greater tuberosity may become either partially or completely avulsed follow ing posterior dislocation and associated infraspinatus injury may or may not be present. A previous anatomical study detailing the possible mechanism of injury in cadavers with posterior dislocation and a non-arthroscopic surgical repa ir on a patient with a recurrent posterior shou lder dislocation have been reported but MRI examinations were not ava ilable at the time . The MRI find ings in our patients correlated weil with the arthroscopie surgical find ings . The ideal treatment of patients with posterior capsular tear is still of debate. In our study !wo of the capsu lar tears were repaired and one was left unrepaired. These addit ional MRI findings may help with the diagnosis of this condition and may have an influenee on decision making for treatment plans. Methods and Materials: 10 athletes clin ically suspected of posterosuperior impingement syndrome of the shoulder, underwent MRI stat ic examination employing a 0.2T permanent unit and a 1.5 T superconductive one (SE T1-w, Fat Sat TSE T2-w and GE T2-w sequences, on oblique-coronal and sagittal scan planes) . Dynamic examination was performed in all cases using the abduction and extrarotation (ABER) MRI projection (SE T1-w and Fat Sat SE T2-w sequences). Results: Statie MRI showed supraspinatus tendon partial tear (8 cases; a type 2 SLAP lesion was associated in 2 of them), supraspinatus tendon tendonitis (2 cases). Subchondral ischemic changes of the posterosuperior portion of the humeral head were evidenciated in 3 cases . Subacromial impingement poi nts were not observed. Dynamic MRI showed the impingement between the deep portion of the supraspinatus tendon and the postero-superior glenohumeral joint in all cases , showing that the subchondral humeral head ischemic changes were located at the level of the postero-s uperior impingement point. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the feasibility and image quality of a 0.2 T system after arthrography of the shoulder. Methods and Materials: 65 patients with suspected chronic instability or rotator cuff abnormalities proved at arthroscopy or open surgery were examined prospectively with MR arthrography at a low field 0.2 T MR system (Magnetom Open). Intra-articular injection of diluted Gd-DTPA was followed by coronal STIR-sequences, coronal T1 weigthed, sagittal and axial T2*-Flash 2D sequences. The images were evaluated independently by two radiologists who were blinded to the patients data, the surgical results and the clinical history.",

            "text": "Results: Image quality was significant good or fair in 90% for the T1 and T2*-Flash 2D sequences and in 80% of the patients for the STIR sequence (p < 0.001). Motion artifacts were low or moderate in 100% for the T1 and T2*-Flash 2D sequences and in 83% for the STIR sequences with a significance of p < 0.05. Sensitivity and specificity for rotator cuff tears was 100%. Sensitivity for labrum pathologies was also 100% and specificity 93%. 1 MR diagnosis of a detached labrum was false positive (predictive value of a positive study of 86%). Evaluation of the labrum was not sufficiently possible in one patient. Conclusion: Based on our results, MR arthrography of the shoulder using a 0.2 T open MR system allows in almost all cases accurate evaluation of the intra-articular joint structures. Disadvantages are the duration of the examination and thereby the risk of reduced image quality caused by motion artefacts. Beside of cost-effectiveness the open MR system is especially a good alternative for patients with c1austrophobia and is useful for c1inical routine examination of the shoulder. Purpose: The aim of the study was to evaluate by spiral computed tomography (sCT) in noninvasive way regression of thrombi in acute massive pulmonary embolism treated with anticoagulants. Methods and Materials: Seventeen patients (8 male and 9 female) with acute massive pulmonary embolism, were studied at onset of disease and 3 to 4 weeks later. Diagnosis of acute PE was confirmed by perfusion nuclear studies in all and in 13 of 17 by transoesophageal echocardiography. Ten between seventeen patients had control sCT exams after six months later. Results: In initial 17 exams there were seen 349 thrombi in main, division of main pulrnonary, lobar and segmental arteries, after 3-6 weeks of therapy 151 were still present (42.3%). In patients who were examed at onset, after more the month and after six months of the anicoagulant therapy respectivly 177 thrombi, 62 (35%) and 43 (24.3%) were dedected. In exams after six months thrombi were seen in divisions of main pulmonary, lobar and segmnetai were seen and all of them were perimural and thin in comparission with the first findings. Conclusion: Follow up with spiral CT indicates partial and gradual disappearence of intraarterial thrombi in acute PE. Despite of total clinical recorvery some perimural thrombi are visible even after 6 months of anticoagulation. Scans were analyzed by three independent readers for the depiction of segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries. The contrast enhancement in the central thoracic vessels was measured in each patient. Results: 1120 segmental and 2240 subsegmental pulmonary arteries were analyzed. Most segmental and subsegmental arteries were coded analyzable with a frequency of more than 80 or 70%, respectively. One segmental (RA7) and one subsegmental (LA7b) artery in paracardiac segments were beUer depicted with EBT (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the two techniques in the total number of analyzable segmental and subsegmental arteries. The contrast enhancement in the thoracic vessels was significantly higher in the patients studied with EBT. Conelusion: An accurate analysis of peripheral pulmonary arteries is weil within the scope of advanced CT techniques. EBT has minor advantages in the analysis of paracardiac arteries, probably due to the reduction of motion artifacts and better contrast opacification. Purpose: Torsion of testicular appendage represents the most common cause of acute painful pediatric scrotum. Despite its characteristic clinical presentation it is also the most frequently misdiagnosed intraserotal lesion and in some instances it can not be differenciated from torsion of the testis. The aim of this study is to describe the gray-scale and PD sonographie findings of torsed appendix testis to better characterize it. Methods and Materials: We performed US and PD sonographie studies of 8 patients with clinical suspicious of torsion of testicular appendages. All US examinations were obtained using a Logiq 700 (GE) and according to age multifrequency Iinear-array transducer of 7-9 MHz or 10-12 MHz have been used. Results: The swollen appendix was identified in 4 patients and it appeared as an echogenie or heterogeneous mass. PD sonography demonstrated its avascular pattern as weil as associated epididymal hyperemia in two cases. No vascular testicular anomalies were depicted. The remaining 4 patients presented initially a focal or diffuse secondary epididymitis and no mass corresponding to a torsed appendix could be identified. Posterior studies demonstrated resolution of the inflammatory response with evidence of an avascular mass which progressed to a calcified small nodule and secondary detachement. Conelusion: Sonographie appearance of torsed appendix testis changes over the course of time. In an acute phase the inflammatory neighbouring response could simulate other serotal disorders such as inflammatory processe or subacute or partial testicular torsion. Control US studies can demonstrate the torsed appendix.",

Evans; London/UK Purpose: Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is characterised by a generalised small vessel arteriopathy, and a reduetion in the normal gravitational gradient of pulmonary perfusion. EBCT allows evaluation of pulmonary perfusion within specified regions of interest (ROI). Methods and Materials: Regional pulmonary perfusion was studied in 5 subjects with PPH using EBCT At a single level, repeated sections were obtained during the injection of non-ionic contrast. Subjects were studied before and during the infusion of adenosine. Perfusion was ealculated in five ROI along the dorsal-ventral lung axis. Results: Perfusion remained uniform aeross all ROI (p 0.99), both with and without adenosine. The administration of adenosine resulted in increased perfusion in all ROI (p < 0.01), but the perfusion gradient remained unchanged. Conelusion: The normal gravitational gradient in pulmonary perfusion is diminished in PPH. The post-adenosine increase in perfusion, illustrates the ability of this technique to reflect physiological changes in perfusion. Purpose: Our purpose is to describe the CT appearance of pulmonary fat embolism syndrome (PFS). Methods and Materials: Medical records of patients treated between 1993 and 1998 were reviewed, and fourteen patients met the diagnosis of PFS. CT scans were available for review in five patients who consisted of the study group. The radiographie and CT findings were described by two ehest radiologists with consensus. Results: Multiple iII-defined foci of ground-glass attenuation/consolidation and ill-defined nodules were noted in all patients. These abnormalities were seen predominantly in the upper lobes of the lungs, whereas in the lower lobes, gravity dependent density predominated. In two Purpose: Testicular microlithiasis \u2122 is an uncommon condition which has been reported in association with testicular malignancy. The purpose of this study was to report the c1inical and sonographie features of 28 patients with TM diagnosed since 1993, and to report the long term follow up in 12 patients diagnosed prior to 1995. Methods and Materials: Twenty-eight cases were reviewed. Patients diagnosed prior to 1995 were recalled for repeat USo Results: Testicular malignancy was found in association with TM in 12 cases (43%). Six patients had teratomas, 5 seminomas and 1 had a Leydig cell tumour. TM occurred in association with atrophie testes in 6 patients. One patient had an epidermoid cyst. Twelve patients had a repeat US at at a mean of 54 months (range 41-64 months) following their initial examination. In one patient a seminoma developed in a testis previously shown to have TM. Conclusion: Primary testicular malignancy is present in a high proportion of patients with TM. Although TM has not been definitely proven to be a premalignant condition, we advocate annual US screening in these patients. After pharmacological stimulation with intracavemosal injection of 10 mcg of PGE 1, we performed a PD examination with 3D reconstruction utilizing an HDI 3000 (ATL, Bothell, Wash.) equipped with a build in 3D module and a broadband transducer (5-10 MHz). The images were obtained during phases 1-2 of the erection. The conspiquity of arteriolar branches of cavernosal arteries visualised with PD was graded identifying three patterns (I high, II reduced, III poor).

We evaluated the uter ine volume, the endometrial thickness and the aspect of endometrial echoes. 124 patients performed endometrial curettage. Results: The endometrial thickness was sign lficantly increased in GT (7 mm). No sign ificant difference was found in the uterine mean volume between Ihe two groups. In postmenopausal patients the endometrial thickness (P = 0.0002) and the uter ine volume (P = 0.0005) were significantly increased than in GC. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that Tamoxifen was the only significant independent factor pred icting for endometrial thickness. In 124 endometrial sam pies, positive pathological findings were present in 21 patients of GT and in 5 CG. No atyp ical endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer were found in either group . Conclusion: Pelvic US exam ination is able to identify the sign ificant increase of endometrial thickness in the GT. However, the find ing of thickened endometrium on US is not necessary associated with endometrial pathology on biopsy. Purpose: Ovar ian fibromas are benign lesions (about 4% of all ovarian cancers) whose differential diagnosis is difficult. When they are solid and homogeneous, echotomography shows echogenie masses which cannot be distinguished from subserous uterine fibromas. Methods and Materials: We used high-field MRI (1.5 T) to exam ine 7 patients with ovarian fibromas (9 masses) later submitted to surgery. Results: The mass was solid and homogeneous in 6 cases , and complex with a solid-liquid component in 1 case . lt was hypointense in T1 and T2 in 5 cases, hyperintense in T1 and hypointense in T2 in 1 case , and hypointense in T1 and irregularly hyperintense in T2 in 3 cases. Gadolinium (.1 mmollkg) was adm inistered in 4 cases : a peripheral rim was seen in both T1 and T2 , but the enhancement was not of diagnostic quality. Conclusion: The MR signal was homogeneously hypointense in T1 and T2 in 5 cases and it was distinctive of ovarian fibromas. The mass shape and signal patterns can help make the differential diagnosis with subserous uter ine fibromas.

Methods and Materials: RF-thermal ablation was performed on implanted VX2-tumor in 23 rabbit Iivers. Following RF application and immediate post-procedure imaging in all animals (T2-weighted, STIR , T1-weighted before and after gadod iamide administrat ion), nine rabbits were followed up 2 weeks later after adm inistration of a superparamagnelic iron oxide (SPIO) , and four were imaged aga in one month post RF ablalion . Liver was harvested in all cases for pathological examination. Results: Successful RF-thermal ablat ion was accomplished in all cases with an instrumentation time ranging from 19 to 85 min. Tumor-to-RFthermal lesion CNR was highest for T2-weighted and STIR imaging with a mean of 4.5 and 3.8, respectively. T2-weighted imaging never overestimated pathologicallesion size by more than 2 mm. On 2-and 4week follow-up imaging after SPIO administration, Tumor-to-RF-thermal lesion CNR was again highest on T2-we ighted and STIR sequences with a radiolog ical/pathological correlation coefficient not lower than .90. Conclusion: MR imaging-guided RF-thermal ablation in implanted liver tumor is feasible and safe. Thermal lesion size can best be mon itored using T2-weighted and STIR images . Purpose: Ta compare the efficacy of saline infusion mediated radiofrequen cy (RF) tissue ablation and intratumoral alcohol injection for the treatment of liver tumors in rabbits. Methods and Materials: Ninety liver tumors were induced in 49 rabbits by VX2 carcinoma implantation. Th irty-n ine tumors in 21 rabbits were treated with RF (90\u00b0C, 4-12 min., 5% saline infused at 1 ml/min .); 21 tumors in 12 rabbits were inject ed with 99.8 % ethanol (1.5--3.0 ml); 10 tumors each in the left and right lobes were treated with RF and ethanol respectively in 10 rabbits for intra individual compar lson: 6 rabb its with 10 tumors served as untreated centrot . The efficacy was evaluated with MRI, microangiography and histopathology. Results: Six control rabbits died within 2 months. In RF group , 6 rabbits surv ived langer than 6 months (absolute eradication 29%); 8 rabbits were found free of viable tumor when they were sacrificed (relat ive era dicat ion 38%); 7 rabbits (33%) showed local tumor relapse and/or lung metastasis . In ethanol group , tumors in 10 rabbits (83 %) were incompletely ablated. In RF-ethanol intraindividual camparisan group , viable tumor was found in 9 out of 10 ethanollesions and in none of 10 RF lesions. MRI proved useful in monitoring these therapi es. At microangiography and histology, remaining tumoral vasculature was found mainly with ethanol but not RF treated lesions. Conclusion: Saline infusion mediated RF ablation is superior to ethanol injection for treatment of liver malignancy in rabbits . Complete destruclion of intratumoral blood vessels explains the beller results of RF therapy. Virtual targets were defined in the liver and in both kidneys on MR images.

With some experience the interventions took less than 15 minutes. Cytology revealed malignancy in 5 patients. Among the others goiter, muscle hypertrophy and cyst content was diagnosed. No complications occured. Conclusion: Fluoroscopic interactive MR-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy on a short bore high field scanner is an effective and safe way to obtain material for cytological evaluation. Methods and Materials: Stent and filter placement was performed on a 1.5 ACS-NT scanner. A sliding window reconstruction technique together with radial scanning allows updating of the images at a frame rate of 16 images per second. A specially designed backprojector performed the realtime reconstruction of the image data. Five MRcompatible, selfexpanding stents were placed in iliac arteries of five pigs. Retrievable, MR-compatible tulip filters were implanted into the inferior vena cava in the same animals. Placement of the stents and filters was directly controlled on LCD screens beside the magnet. The position of each device was verified by MR and conventional subtraction angiography.",

Systematic variation of parameters for image processing to increase signal to noise ratio (SNR) was performed. Analysis of SNR was done quantitatively and visually. Results: Tailored image processing leads to improvement of SNR between 15-30%. For a given sensitivity level (speed class 400) SNR is lower than with film-screen systems. Spatial resolution of CR is lower too. Conclusion: Low absolute receptor dose levels with exposition parameters for speed class 400 in pediatric radiology lead to a low SNR with CR.

Purpose: To present a discussion of this rare cond ition with par ticular emphasis on its classification and the imaging approach to the diagnosis to enable a beUer understanding of this lesion. Methods and Materials: Four ch ildren with atlanto -axial rotatory subluxation are presented . The c1inical presentation and imaging find ings are described. Conclusion: Atlanto-axial rotatory subluxation is an uncommon , poorly understood condition which is one of the causes of acquired torticollis in children. It may occur following trauma, infection or surgery to the head and neck region, or spontaneously. Most cas es settle spontaneously but in some the rotatory deformity becomes fixed and irreducible. Diagnosis is often delayed because of the expectat ion of spontaneous recovery. Clinically, the head is rotated and tilted and th is typical \"Cock Rob in\" appearance makes radiographie position ing difficu lt. The complex anatomy of the atlanto-axial region , coupled with problems of posit ioning , make the radiographs difficult to interpret. Computed tomography is essential in imag ing this condition and for treatment planning. Early diagnosis of atlanto-axial rota tory subluxation leads to improved outcome with non-operative management. Atlanto-axial rota tory subluxat ion may settle spontaneously so initial conservative management involv ing anti-inflammatory drugs, cerv ical collar and sometimes museie relaxants is advocated. Those children whose torticollis persis ts for more than a week need aggressive investigation by computed tomography. This approach will avoid over invest igation and over treatment yet will still detect atlanto-axial rotatory subluxation early enough to ach ieve a good outcome. In nearly all cases we used 120 kV and 50-90 mA. Tube rotation time : 0.75 sec , collimation: 5 mm, pitch : 5208 1.5 and reconstruction interval 5 mm. The Study was done with breath hold in inspiration and without contrast material. For the evaluation of both examinations we used the following score: lung meta stases, suspicious pulmonary nodules and no metastases. Results: In 62 of 80 investigations (23 patients with 2 CT) the results of CT were identical with scintigraphy. Different results we found in 18 cases. In 11 investigations with suspicious pulmonary nodules scint igraphy was negative in 7 and pos itive in 4 cases, in 5 normal CT-studies scintigraphy showed lung metastases and in 2 cases with nodules in CT scintigraphy was susp icious in one and negative in the othe r case . Conclusion: J-131-scintigraphy is the standard procedure for detection of metastases of papillary thyro id cancer. Even with repeated investigations CT is not able to differentiate between metastases and residues of treatment. CT shows early signes of lung fibrosis as a side effect of J-131-therapy. Purpose: to evaluate the role of MRI in primary diagnosis and postoperative follow-up of pulmonary artery malformation using fast imaging imaging sequences. Methods and Materials: 45 patients aged 3 months to 12 years with pulmonary atresia, aplasia of left or right PA, valvular, supravalvular or pulmonary branch stenosis in whom echocardiographic findings were unconclusive were examined with a 1.5 T MRI. The study protocol included fast spin-echo T1 wi, FLASH 20 eine and FISP 3D sequences. Multiplanar reformations were performed of the FSE T1 wi and the 3D image data sets. Results: 15 patients were studied pre-and 30 postoperatively (palliative shunt in 14, definitive surgical repair in 16 patients). The MR image quality allowed detailed diagnostic information in all but one examination. MPA atresia was present in 20 cases, valvular or supravalvular stenoses were diagnosed in 9, central pulmonary artery stenoses in 16, peripherical stenoses in 4, and aplasia of RPA or LPA in 6 examinations. Any type of echographically suspected stenosis could be excluded in 7 cases. All diagnoses were confirmed by surgery, angiography or c1inical follow-up. Conclusion: MRI as a minimal invasive modality is able to provide crucial information in patients with pulmonary artery atresia or stenosis especially in cases in whom echocardiography remains unconclusive. Signal intensities, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was calculated. Results: On post-contrast images, a 36% increase in SNR was noted in patients with normal adrenal glands (0.7 vs. 11.1 on FS images, p < .05).",

Conclusion: Mn-DPDP provides a good enhancement and could be used for delineation of the adrenal glands, for detection/exclusion of focal secondary adrenal lesions. Purpose: To assess the safety of the highly concentrated Gadobutrol (1M) as a new MR contrast agent in patients with impaired renal function. Methods and Materials: 21 patients with impaired renal function and any indication for a contrast enhanced MRI were enrolled into this prospective study after written informed consen!. The patients were c1assified in 2 groups according to their creatinine clearance (group 1: n = 12, <80 ml/min and >30 ml/min; group 2: n = 9, <30 ml/min not requiring dialysis). Gadobutrol (1M) was injecled as an iv. bolus at randomly assigned doses of either 0.1 or 0.3 mmol/kg bw. Changes in vital signs, c1inical chemistry and urinanalysis including creatinine clearance were monitored before, 6 hrs and then every 24 hrs after contrast application until 72 h (group 1) or 120 h (group 2) respectively following the administration of Gadobutrol. Moreover, hematology was checked every other day. Results: No serious adverse events and no significant changes in vital signs occured following iv. bolus injection of Gadobutrol at doses of 0.1 and 0.3 mmol/kg bw. No c1in ically relevant changes in hematology, c1 inical chemistry and urinanalysis were detected during the observation period. Markers for glomerular filtration (creatinine, cystatin C, \u00df2-microglobulin) and for tubular function (\u00df-NAG, a1-microglobulin) were unaffected by Gadobutrol in both groups. Furthermore, creatinine c1earance was unchanged. Conclusion: Gadobutrol (1M) can safely be applied to patients with chronically impaired renal function, even to patients with marginal excretory function (creatinine c1earance <30 ml/min). Methods and Materials: Twenty New Zealand white rabbits underwent MRI of the bone marrow before and 2 days following 12 Gy total body irradiation. Spinecho (SE) 600/15 (TRlTE) and dynamic FLASH 60\u00b0/50/4 (aITRlTE)-sequences were performed before and following injection of 0.05 mmollkg BW CMD-Gd-DOTA (n = 10) or 0.1 mmol/kg BW gadopentetate (n =10). The contrast enhancement was quantified as~SI =i <Slpos t -SIpre)/SIprel * 100%. MRI data were compared with the histopathologic BMB-ultrastructure. Results: Dynamic bone marrow~SI-data steadily increased up to 10-15 min after CMD-Gd-DOTA-injection, while blood~SI-data slightly decreased. This bane marrow contrast enhancement was significantly higher in the irradiated group as compared to non-irradiated controls, corresponding to irradiation induced alterations of the BMBultrastructure shown on electron microscopy (p < 0.05). Following gadopentetate injection however, bone marrow \u00f6 SI-data of nonirradiated and irradiated animals were not significantly different (p < 0.05). Concluslon: Irradiation induced alterations in BMB-permeability could be reliably assessed with GMD-Gd-DOTA enhanced MRI, while gadopentetate dimeglumine was not suited to determine these changes. Purpose: In phamacokinetic modeling it is frequently necessary to take the arterial input function (AIF) into account. If there is no appropriate artery within the investigated region, the information must be gained simultaneously to dynamic imaging of the lesion from a different location. This is difficult scanning problem. The aim of this study was to find an approach , which enables the measurement of the AIF and the contrast media (GM) uptake at different locations with different coils. Furthermore , inflow effects must be suppressed for the measurement oftheAIF.",

The temporal resolution was 3.5 s for each slice, which was absolutely sufficient for the time course of the used GM bolus. The applied parameters fulfill the condition of proton exchange minimization which is particular important due to the high GM concentration during first pass.

            "text": "Purpose: The aim of this study is to compare thesensitivity of 3D-TOF MR angiography in detection of intracranial aneurysms with intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (I.A.DSA) Methods and Materials: We report our experience with 3D-TOF magnetic resonance angiography protocol at 1.0 T system, using a conventional maximum intensity projection (MIP) algorithm in 32 patients with clinical suspicion of an aneurysm; 19 of these were correleted with I.A.DSA. Results: 3D-TOF MR angiography and IADSA were in agreement both in negativ and positiv cases (6 and 13) as to aneurysms presenc, as weil locating the aneurysm site, as weil as their size. Concluslon: 3D-TOF MRA is rapid and noninvasive and can be implemented as a precise, reliable tool in intracranial aneurysms evaluation. Methods and Materials: 3D-TOF imaging was performed on 25 patients following treatment with the GDC system. 3D TOF MRA source data, maximum intensity projection (MIP) and 3D isosurface reconstructions were compared to IA DSA which was adopted as a gold standard. Images were assessed for parent and branch artery f1ow, the presence of neck recurrence and aneurysm re-growth. Results: No significant image arlifact resulted from the presence of the GDG coil in any case. Both 3D iso-surface and MRA source data correlated weil with IA DSA for parent and branch artery f1ow, the presence of neck recurrence and aneurysm regrowth. There was poor correlatian between MIP MRA and IA DSA findings. Conclusion: Three dimensional time-of-f1ight magnelic resonance angiography (3D TOF MRA) is now readily accepted as a non-invasive screening tool for familial aneurysmal disease and has been used as an alternative to IA DSA in the surgical management of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. MRA in patients treated with GDC is safe , imparts no radiation dose and provides acceptable image quality. Methods and Materials: Eight GDC-embolized bifurcation aneurysms were examined by postmortal MRI , gross pathology, electron rnicroscopy, conventional histopathology and in situ lightmicroscopy of intraaneurysmatic thrombosis after performing a diamant cutting and grind ing techn ique. All embo lizations were performed under perlinterventional anticoagulation. The time intervals between intervention and death ranged from three to thirteen days . Results: In all patients the major part of the intraaneurysmatic volume (75-90%) cons isted of thrombotic material, which filled the spaces between the coilloops and fulfilled histopathological criteria of an intravital thrombogenesis. Histological indicators for a proceeding thrombus organ ization or a neoendothelialization of the aneurysmorifice could not be demonstrated . Early thrombus stages were detached from the coil surfaces by recurrent mechanic-hemodynamic influences of the pulsating blood stream followed by thrombusfragmentation and thrombolysis. The coil surfaces were than covered by multinucleated giant cells. Conclusion: Initially after GDC-embolization an intraaneurysmatic thrombosis additionally completes the aneurysm occlusion and stabilises the coilpackage. This thrombus formation is not prevented by per iinterventional anticoagulation. In some of the hemodynamical stressed bifurcation aneurysms further thrombusorganizations are prevented by hemodynamic and Iytic processes, which sustain a vicious circle resulting in compactations of the coilpackage and aneurysm reperfusion . Methods and Materials: CT angiographies were performed using a spiral CT scanner (Siemens Somatom Plus 4) with following scan protocol: 1 mm slice thickness, pitch 1, f10w 2.5 mVsec , 120 ml amount of contrast, delay 22-2&sec. 50 mm coverage was sufficient to include the circle of WiIIis, posterior inferior cerebellar arte ries and pericallosal arteries.

We evaluate the limitations of this technique to detect aneurysms and to characterise the correlation between 3-D CT angiography images and intraoperative findings . Methods and Materials: Betwcen July 1997 and September 1998, a total of 17 patients with cerebral saccular aneurysms were evaluated with 3-D CT angiograms. The exam inalion was performed using a Somaton Plus B 31 C, Siemen sf CT scanner with 3-D and maximum intensity projection (MIP) . Results: In 14 cases a good cerebral arterial image was obtained. These pictures were useful for planning the microsurgical approaches. Their correlation with the intraoperative findings was excellent. In five emergency cases , a neurosurg ical intervention after 3-D CT angiography alone was possible. Ten postoperative exam inations of aneurysms treated with Titanium clips confirmed the complete closure of the aneurysms. Three aneurysms bigger that 3 mm were missed using MIP. Conclusion: In our study the pre-and postoperative performed 3-D CT angiographies provide useful images 1) for planning the microsurg ical approaches 2) for defining the aneurysm's anatomy and 3) for controlling the operative results. The recognition of intracavernous and infraclinoid ICA aneurysms is difficult in case of simultaneaus cavernous sinus enhancement and a delayed peak time of maximum arterial enhancement.

Conclusion: With false negative imaging in 2.0% in the actual series and a potentially higher complication rate, DSA seems inferior to CTA related to the preoperative workup of patients with cerebral aneurysms.

According to the delineation of an aneurysms, its neck and the related vessels, the results obtained with DSA, SSD and VECTA were rated as \"poor\", \"sufficient\" and \"excellent\". Results: Excellent visualization of the neck was possible in 12 aneurysms (43%) with DSA, in 17 aneurysms (61%) with SSD and in 20 aneurysms (71%) with VECTA. Excellent visualization of surrounding vessels was possible in 11 aneurysms (39%) with DSA, in 19 aneurysms with SSD (67%) and in 23 aneurysms (82%) with VECTA. Coil size could correctly be estimated in three GDC treated patients. Correlation between aneurysm visualization and intraoperative findings was equal or superior to DSA and SSD. Conclusion: For understanding of vascular details VECTA is superior to DSA and SSD, especially in patients with partly thrombosed aneurysms or tourtous surrounding vessels. The ability to measure distances and volume directly within the three-dimensional representation, makes this method ideal for therapy planning in GDC-procedures and prior to surgery. Results: From the 32 known Ans, 29 were nicely imaged by CTA, permitting evaluation of their morphology, dimensions and relations to adjacent arteries and, also, measurement of aneurysmal neck. 3 examinations weren't technically succesful while 3 additional Ans had been first imaged by CTA. The CTA findings significantly influenced the choise of treatment of 15 Ans (clipping or coiling) and this decision was confirmed during the treatment procedures. In 9 Ans, CTA provided information similar to DSA while in 5 cases DSA was better. In 3 cases was not performed because CTA findings were considered efficient.",

Higgins; San Franeiseo, CA/USA After years of R & D works, large f1at panel detectors (FPD) developers appear to be ready for starting the commercial step. Advocated advantages are a productivity improvements expected for faster exams, from wider exposure latitude and ease of operations, and from the electronic transport, storage and retrieval of images files in a PACS or teleradiology environment. Finally, digitized images are especially subject to protocols for procedures and to sophisticated post processing developments including automatie detection of abnormalities. Selenium or amorphous Silicium technologies allowed to make full size detector in one piece. Current size and resolution are roughly 40 x 40 cms, 2500 x 2500 x 14 bits and 3.5 1 p/mm. Static imaging is the current initial purpose for the short term future (1998) (1999) including high resolution smaller detectors for mammography. Dynamic imaging will be the following step (2002) (2003) . Today, clinical tests using Selenium FPD are very promising in spite of a lower spatial resolution compared to film; their dynamic is higher and should result in enhanced diagnosis. Less clinical tests using amorphous Silicium sensors are available, but are also promissing. Finally, large FPD seem accurate for an efficient ciinical use; obviously these preliminaries have to be much deeper confirmed in larger scale applications, including economical concerns. lt would be an essential step for PACS and teleradiology development. RoomA MRI ofthe heart has been conducted for more than fifteen years. Initially, it was employed for depiction of cardiovascular pathoanatomy and has been used most frequently for the following diagnoses: thoracic aortic disease; constrictive pericarditis; cardiac and paracardiac masses; right ventricular dysplasia, and congenital heart disease. In valvular heart disease, MRI can be used to identify the presence of stenosis or regurgitation, volume of regurgitation, and ventricular volumes and mass. Cine MRI and echoplanar MRI are used to precisely quantify ventricular volumes, mass and function. Cine MRI identifies valvular regurgitation and stenosis. Velocity-encoded cine MRI provides measurement of blood flow and can be used to quantify the volume of valvular regurgitation.",

Although the number of congenital cardiovascular abnormalities may be Iimited in general hospitals, the patient load is steadily increasing due to improved surgical methods. Therefore, MR imaging may playa pivotal role in the presurgical evaluation, but also during the follow-up of patients over many years. Established imaging protocols are now available to assess cardiac anatomy, function and large vessel f1ow. Spin-echo sequences are still of great value to assess morphological abnormalities of the heart and great vessels, especially to depict extracardiac anatomy and postsurgical conduits. Gradient-echo sequences help to identify flow alterations across condults, stenoses and other valvular problems. Gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography is useful to assess vascular bypasses and other large vessel abnormalities. Breath-held MR fast gradient-echo sequences are now routinely applied to study ventricular function. In the same imaging session right and left ventricular funclion can be measured wilh high accuracy and reproducibility. Especially, right ventricular function is difficult to evaluate with other imaging techniques, thereby providing MR imaging a great advantage over echocardiography. In addltion, to these anatomie and functional MR methods, MR allows also the measurement of valvular and large vessel flow by using MR flow mapping. MR flow mapping is highly accurate to measure intracardiac and large vessel f1ow, both in terms of velocity and flow volume.

Purpose: Ta evaluate the use of MR imaging in the diagnosis and characterization of isolated gluteus muscle tears as a source of hip pain. Methods and Materials: 16 patients (12 f, 4 m, aged 48-79 years, mean age: 65 years). who presented with chronic hip pain and MRI findings of isolated gluteus medius muscle tears in the hip comprised the study group. The cases were collected over an 18 month period and were retrospectively analyzed. MR images were evaluated for the presence of gluteus museie tears or distal tendon rupture and edema in the region of the greater trochanter. Clinical correlation was obtained in all of the patients. Patients with history of recent local steriod injection were excluded from the study group. Results: 19 museies tears were identified in 16 patients. 13 patients showed an isolated tear of the gluteus medius museie. In 3 patients a tear of both the gluteus medius and minimus museies were identified. MR imaging features of the gluteus muscle tears include discontinuity of the muscle fibres at the insertion on the greater trochanter. On T2W images high signal fluid Iike intensity is seen within and around the museie tears. Conclusion: MRI is useful in detecting and characterizing isolated tears of the gluteus muscles. In patients with therapy resistant chronic hip pain MRI can help to differentiate between patients with gluteus muscle tears or trochanteric bursitis. Purpose: One of the most common congenital osseous disorder is the hip dysplasia leaded to secondary caxarthrosis in middle age. The arthroplasty must be often implanted very early. The very good room orientation in the changed anatomic relations is very important for a surgeon. The knowledge of the really size of the acetabulum and the thickness of the acetabular bottom helps to choose the right size of the arthroplasty components. Methods and Materials: 50 patient with the dysplastic hip undergone the computed tomography with the three-dimensional SSD reconstruction before the arthroplasty. The axial (not a helical) protocol was used with the collimation 2.5 mm. The reconstruction were performed with the volume -treshold rendering. The acetabulum was reconstructed separately from femur too. Results: The joints were divided in four groups: normal, dysplasia in situ, subluxation and luxation. We used 47 normal iliac bone anatomic preparations as a comparative group. Conclusion: Three dimensional CT of the dysplastic hip takes the very important information to surgeon and helps to choose the best size of the prosthesis and the optimal operation method. Purpose: To demonstrate the appearance of the acetabular labrum with magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) with gross anatomic correlation in cadavers and surgical correlation in patients. Methods and Materials: MRA was performed in 6 cadaveric hip joints and 40 patients who underwent subsequent arthrotomy of the hip. The MRA examination consisted of a T1-weighted 3D gradient-echo sequence in the coronal and sagittal oblique plane after the intraarticular injection of a 2 mmollL solution of gadopentate dimeglumine. The normal and pathologic appearance of the acetabular labrum was assessed, and the labra were evaluated on the basis of morphology, signal intensity, presence of a tear, and attachment to the acetabulum. MRA findings were correlated with anatomic sections of the cadavers and surgical results in patients. Results: MRA images allowed visualization of the normal labrum which was of triangular shape and of homogenous low signal intensity. The sensitivity for detection of labrallesions with MRA in the patient study was 91%, the accuracy 88%, and the specificity 71%. Conelusion: The normal labrum is triangular in shape and there is no normal sulcus between the labrum and the acetabular articular cartilage. MRA allows excellent assessment of the normal and pathologic acetabular labrum.

The radiology reports from the radiography examinations were compared to the reports from the CT examinations. Results: Clear signs of sacro-ileitis were observed in 11.8% of the radiography examinations, equivocal changes in 29.4%. 58.8% of the examinations were normal, or with mild degenerative changes.",

One main find that extent of changes is proportional to the distance back in time-talking of traumas of long standing. All patients had been operated, and subsequent morphologie examinations of removed coccygeal bones confirmed changes had been rerealed by C'I. Therely, all coccygeal fractures are accopanied by SCJ's injury and coccygectomy should be carried out, not simple resection of fractured fragment, which does not relieve the source of pain in the region of SCJ. Purpose of apophyseal facet joint HRCT investigations was on one hand to increase the sensitivity of detection, and on the other hand to find specific changes, characteristic enough to give help in differential diagnostic complex elinico-radiological evaluation. Methods of conventional film, radionuclid imaging and high resolution bone algorythm CT was compared in context of clinical history, actual clinical status and radiological investigations of other organs (gastrointestinal tract, CT and selective enterography, lung radiography and HRCT). Patients suffering in Crohn's disease, sprue syndrome, ulcerative colitis, malabsorbtion, seronegative spondartritis and DISH syndrome were compared. Results of sensitivity in case of HRCT are highly significant versus conventional radiography in detecting articular erosions and new bone formation/ligamentar calcification showed independent on actual inflammatory activity and disease duration. There is some diagnose related positive correlation between localisation and symptome-combination of HRCT findings in the particular diseases of different aetiology. Conelusion of the study suggests the much higher sensitivity of HRCT versus plain film and better, than nuelear medicine bone scans, in the later periodes of the disease. A differential diagnostic impact in the clinical evaluation seems to be helpful. .68-.85). Interobserver agreement for vIa scintigraphy was 56% (range: angiography as a final test had higher mortality, but some were cheaper. The strategy which uses perfusion-ventilation scintigraphy, ultrasonography and angiography was the best overall, while the strategy using perfusion scintigraphy, spiral CT and angiography had similar mortality, however, at significantly higher costs. Other strategies were either too expensive or resulted in unacceptable mortality. Conclusion: The optimal diagnostic strategy should include pulmonary angiography. The use of lung scintigraphy and ultrasonography reduces the number of patients requiring angiography by 40-50% and is costeffective. A strategy which uses perfusion scintigraphy and spiral CT prior to angiography yields similar outcome, but at greatly increased costs.",

Methods and Materials: Sixty patients with oral and pharyngeal tumors who received 50-70 Gy radiation therapy were included in a prospective study. The MR study was performed in axial and parasagittal planes with a 1.0 T system. Conventional SE T1-w and PD-T2-w images, STIR and fat saturation SE T1-w images were obtained in all patients. Some lesions detected with MR imaging were proven by means of biopsy or surgically excised specimens. Results: Among the 60 patients investigated 14 (23.3%) has revealed alteration of mandibular MR signal. We have found three fat saturation patterns: 1) cleary demarcated variable signal intensity [related to ischaemia with residual fat-Iike areas), 2) poorly delimited intermediate to high signal [related to oedema) and 3) poorly or well-delimited low signal intensity [related to marrow replacement). In 2 cases the STIR sequence has revealed inhomogeneous zones of high signal scarcely visible with the conventional SE sequences. In 6 cases (10%) with type 2 and type 3 appearance the biopsy has confirmed the presence of mandibular necrosis. Six months after the irradiation 4 cases (6.7%) with type 1 appearance have shown the regression of the signal alteration. Conclusion: In our experience fat suppressed MR imaging has permitted to improve sensitivity in detection of mandibular bone radioiesion and has been useful to document normalization during follow-up.",

Purpose: Traditionally several ionizing radiation methods are involved in pediatric urogenital tract imaging. In order to reduce irradiation and simplify the work-up, we wanted to evaluate whether MRI could replace the traditional methods. Methods and Materials: 30 patients (aged 2 weeks-8 years, mean 1.9 years) with known or suspected urogenital pathology were examined with MR urography. The technique was based on rapid spin echo (T1 and T2W TSE and single-shot TSE) and rapid gradient echo (Dynamic multislice TFE after Gadolinium DTPA) sequences. The children were Iightly sedated and/or fixed with elastic bands. Comparison with US, urography, CT urography and renal dynamic scintigraphy were made. Results: About 20% of the examinations were insufficiently performed mainly due to patient movement. Immobilization was best preserved in infants or children above 5 years of age. The majority of the examinations performed were of excellent quality. Detailed information of morphology and function were achieved, with good correlation between the MRI-and scintigraphy functional studies. Important additional informations were obtained. Conelusion: MR Urography can easily and rapidly be performed in pediatric patients. MRI has the potential of giving accurate morphologic and functional informations of the urogenital tract. This is particulary important in infants with congenital anomalies, where high image quality and low radiation exposure are preferred. Methods and Materials: In 15 children, aged 4 weeks to 13.8 years, GMRU was performed after an intravenous injection of Gd-DTPA and low dose Furosemide. Coronal 3D-gradient-echoimages and maximumintensity projections were obtained 5 to 30 minutes post injection in a 1.5 T Gyroscan ACS-NT scanner. None of the children were sedated. Respiratory triggering was used. Results: GMRU showed anormal upper urinary tract in two, horseshoekidney in two, pelviureteric junction obstruction in three, a ureteral stenosis in one, duplicating collecting system in two, unilateral megaureter in two, orthoptic ureterocoele in one, a residual ectopic distal ureter in one, and postoperative changes in one children. Complete visualization of the ureter, including the ureterovesical junction, was successful in 24 of 30 ureters. The collecting system was visible in all cases, except two nearly functionless kidneys, one multicystic kidney and one very small dysplastic kidney. Conclusion: GMRU is in particularly useful in the assessment of upper urinary tract abnormalities associated with non-dilated collecting systems and ureters.

Methods and Materials: We examined 15 patients with ALS as weil as 15 age matched healthy volunteers. All examinations were performed on a 1.5 T system (Philips ACS NT) with following sequences: transverse TSE dual echo, SE T1, FFE T2*, FLAIR 1, and FLAIR 2, sagittal TSE T2 and coronal FLAIR 1. The images were analyzed by agreement of 3 readers. Results: In a minority of the patients FLAIR 1 showed definite hyperintense signal changes in the precentral gyri. The volunteers revealed no signal changes. FLAIR was superior to TSE dual echo and FFE for changes attributed to ALS, whereby the stronger T2-contrast of FLAIR 1 was advantageous compared to FLAIR 2. Atrophy of the corpus callosum was seen in ALS patients exclusively. In few patients T2weighted TSE images showed low signal rims in the precentral gyri. Conclusion: Signal alterations in the pyramidal tracts in ALS can be seen earlier with FLAIR than with other sequences. In combination with the criteria \"corpus callosum atrophy\" and \"Iow signal rim of the precentral gyrus\" in T2-weighted TSE images, MR diagnosis of ALS will be more specific. Purpose: To study the incidence of dural enhancement in focal calvarial lesions studied with MR imaging. Methods and Materials: 185 patients with proven focal calvariallesions were studied with plain films and computed tomography, and 32 of them with contrast enhanced MR. The presence of dural enhancement, lts continuity and dural soft tissue mass were analyzed. Fisher's exact test was employed for statistical analysis. Results: 72.9% lesions were benign and 27.1 % were malignant. The 32 cases studied with enhanced-MRI were 9 hemangioma, 8 eosinophilic granuloma, 3 epidermoid cysts, 1 osteoma, 9 metastases and 2 primary intraosseous meningioma. Dural enhancement was observed in 16 patients (7 benign, 9 malignant) but not in the rest (14 benign, 2 malignant) (p = 0.01). One malignant lesion presented discontinuous enhancing dura with invasion. Pathologically, 6 cases presented dural invasion, with no statistical differences between patients with dural enhancement or without it. The non-tumoral cases of dural tail were attributed to dural inflammatory reaction secondary to compression changes. Conclusion: Dural enhancement is a nonspecific reaction present in calvarial lesions and do not necessarily represent invasion of the under-Iying duramater. Discontinuous changes and dural tumor are promising characteristics for identifying dural invasion. Purpose: Clinical studies report a rate of 5% and autopsy results a rate of 25% of brain involvement in sarcoidosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of patients with neurosarcoidosis. Methods and Materials: The MRI brain scans of 22 patients with sarcoidosis were retrospectively reviewed, along with the clinical intormation that was provided in the request form. All patients had signs and symptoms referable to the head and were examined with gadolinium enhancement. Results: Cranial (facial) nerve paralysis was the most common clinical manifestation identified in 10 patients. A wide spectrum of MR findings was noted: Periventricular and white matter lesions on T 2W",

Specific diseases typically occuring in each anatomical space will be presented. A discussion of congenital or developmental lesions of the infrahyoid neck includes branchial c1eft cyst, thyroglossal duct cyst, venous malformations and Iymphangioma. The most important neoplastic lesions affecting the visceral space, namely squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx and hypopharynx will be discussed with emphasis on patterns of submucosal tumor spread and implications for TNM c1assification and treatment. Among the neoplasms affecting the carotid space and the posterior cervical space the following entities will be discussed: metastatic Iymphadenopathy from squamous cell carcinoma and lymphoma, neurogenic tumors, lipomas and paragangliomas. The inflammatory and infectious lesions presented in this course include cervical chain nodal inflammation, cellulitis, abscess and necrotizing fasciitis.",

This one has to be defined in 5 areas: how are the compartments of the sinonasal cavities, (from the nasal cavity to the sphenold sinus), the orbit (normal or not), how is the anterior part of the skull base (particularly the cribriform plate), how are the deep regions of the face, what about the fissure and canals of the face? Benign and malignant tumours of the face are then presented with the best way to lead to the right diagnosis.

To conclude: in face and temporal bone CT and MRI will be essential to lead to the right diagnosis (compared with histological material) but the most important part for the radiologist is to precisely analyze the lesion's extension. Cross-sectional imaging (US, CT and MRI) increasingly take over the diagnostic role of conventional radiological examinations in diseases of the GI-tract. Appendicitis, diverticulitis, Crohn's disease, abscesses of enteric origin, lymphoma, intussusception, small bowel obstruction are all primarily diagnosed by cross-sectional imaging. US is dynamic, non-invasive, inexpensive and well-accessible and as such often the initial imaging modality. Graded compression is necessary to compress or displace air-filled bowel and to approach the pathologie bowel closely, which allows the use of a high frequency transducer. Ultrasound has an excellent resolution, but requires expertise and is limited in obese patients. CT, especially spiral CT, is not hampered by bone, gas or obesity and is less operator-dependent than USo The resolution is constantly high in all parts of the abdomen. In most cases oral, rectal and intraveneous contrast media are administered. MRI has become the modality of choice in the diagnosis of perirectal abscesses and fistulae.

All such research requires close co-operation with those clinical colleagues who refer patients for radiological investigations; only by asking them to record their diagnostic and therapeutic thinking at various stages of the diagnostic process can the necessary data be obtained. But these intermediate outcomes of diagnostic and therapeutic impact provide powerful evidence for radiologists who wish to prove the value of their contribution and to seek additional funding to expand their practice.

Plain film radiography is usually the first line of investigation to look for complications of chest drains cannulae and intubation. Other complications might include diagnosis of pneumothorax, lobar collapse and cardiac failure. Transoesophageal ultrasound, is used in the case of valve surgery to determine the integrity of the valve. Transthoracic echocardordiography is usually sufficient to diagnose pericardial effusion and major changes in cardiac function as weil as many valve abnormalities but can be difficult following surgery due to access. Computed tomography is useful for abnormalities of the aorta and lungs including pulmonary embolism. MRI is becoming the method of choice for cardiac follow up and can give agiobai picture of cardiac anatomy, funclion and perfusion. It is Iimited by patients with irregular rhythms, non-compatible implants and claustrophobia. In specialised centres where electron-beam CT is available this is often the method of choice for post-operative studies. Both CT and MRI can be used to assess by-pass graft patency. Cardiac perfusion post-operatively is best determined by nuclear medicine using either PET, technetium SPECT or Thallium SPECT. Small perfusion defects following revascularisation are common in the myocardial territories proximal to the grafts. Finally intravascular ultrasound is becoming more frequently used in post operative graft assessment. The goal of radiology departments is to offer technically excellent images and reports at low cost in a timely fashion. Hence we must carefully assess the effectiveness of the various aspects of our work and than measure each against the cost.

It is, however, beyond the capabilities of MRI to look at myelin separately from the other constituents of the neuropil. To make inferences about disorders beyond the observed signal change in a white matter area, one will have to take other characteristics into consideration, such as morphological distribution, swelling or shrinking (gliotic retraction) of the white matter, pattern of spread, symmetry or asymmetry, confluency of lesions, the presenceof calcifications, the presence of hemorrhage, cyst formation, enhancement of lesions, and the information obtained by using special MR techniques, for exampie Magnetization Transfer Imaging (MTI), Diffusion Weighted Imaging 5242 (DWI), Perfusion Imaging (PI), and in some cases MR spectroscopy (MRS) .

In this presentation, the normal patterns of the aging brain and the most frequent neurodegenerative disorders will be presented. 1. Normal aging brain. Hyperintense foci on T2W images are commonly found in healthy patients in the anterior and lateral frontal horns, in the periventricular white matter (ependymitis granularis), and in the white matter subcortical regions. They increase in size and number with age and vascular risk factors. Dilatation of the perivascular spaces are more frequent with advancing age and must be differentiated from lacunar intarcts. Hypointensity of the putamen on T2W images corresponds to iron deposits. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy, common in the elderly, can manifest by superficial lobar hematoma, often multiple. 2. Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by gradual progressive impairement of intellectual faculties. They are represented mainly by Alzheimer disease which is the most common cause of dementia, Pick disease, multi-intarct dementia, Creutzfeld Jacob disease and normal pressure hydrocephalus. greater use of teleradiology.

The place of multi-media and its relationship to store and forward technology versus client/server transactions will be explained. In this context, the use of both lossy and lossless compression will be discussed with particular emphasis on their impact on radiological practice. The place of the Internet in radiology will be defined with reference to business transactions, access to teaching files, access to medical resources and the influence of the Internet on evidence based practice.

Diagnostic accuracy is such that a Iikely diagnosis can be determined prior to biopsy in a significant number of patients. Furthermore, HRCT analysis enables prediction of appropriate biopsy sites and biopsy techniques. HRCT also determines the likely response to therapy in some patients with diffuse lung disease. In this lecture the various HRCT patterns will be described and the role of HRCT in the investigation and management of patients with diffuse infiltrative lung disease discussed.",

However, one may sometimes encounter difficulties in identifying mild forms of lung infiltration as several technical and/or anatomical parameters are known to interfere with the HRCT appearance of normal lung parenchyma. The purpose of this lecture is to summarize the most commonly encountered difficulties with special emphasis on the various means to overcome the interpretive difficulties. Concerning the assessment of lung attenuation, the clinical usefulness of spirometrically controlled HRCT measurements will be reviewed as weil as the current knowledge on expiratory quantitative CT Since the introduction of spiral CT, several reconstruction techniques have been demonstrated as useful complements to obtain objective diagnostic criteria. The technical protocols as weil as their clinical impact will be emphasized. In addition to the analysis of peripheral lung anatomy, the HRCT appearance of normal airways will be described for the purpose of an easier recognition of the CT features of lung fibrosis and the detection of small airway disease. As smokers and elderly patients are often scanned, specific attention will be also directed toward the description of the corresponding underlying changes, usually referred to as smoker's lung and senile lung.",

A common symptom of DD with reduction is a rsclprocal clicking of the TMJ, whereas DD without reduction frequently results in limited mandibular mobility. MRI has replaced arthrography and computed tomography in the diagnosis of DD because it is noninvasive and has superior soft-tissue contrast and high in-plane resolution. MRI also enables dynamic studies of the TMJ in order to evaluate the physiological and pathophysiological function of this joint. These MRItechniques and a correlation between sectional anatomy and MRI are presented. In addition dynamic MRI-techniques to delineate the motion of the TMJ are also demonstrated. The masticatory space (MS) extends from the skull base to the mandibular ramous. Because the MS is located anteriorily and laterally to the parapharyngeal space (PPS) pathology may extend from the intracranial space into the MS and then into the PPS or originate in the PPS and extend up through the MS into the intracranial space. In order to describe MS anatomy and pathology, MRI is the imaging modality of choice, especially when perineural or perivascular tumor spread is present.",

Conversely, myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome is stressrelated (psychophysiologic) and (ar) involve primarily the muscles of mastication (extracapsular disease). Nowadays, MRI has become the mainstay of diagnosis in TMJ-and muscle disorders. It allows also visualization of bony abnormalities in the condyle, glenoid fossa and articular eminence. Complimentary modalities are plain radiography, arthrography and CT Particularly arthrography plays still an important role in the detection of distal and posterior ligament perforation. Internal derangements of the TMJ are best seen with MRI (accuracy rate >90%). Special dual surface coils and closed and open mouth views are standards, (sagittal and coronal T1-w. Se and T2-w. GRE). Disk-position and configuration is evaluated first. It is important to remember that displaced disks may be seen in up to 20% of asymptomatic population. Diskai mobility is proven by closed and open mouth views. Joint effusion and degenerative joint disease (joint space narrowing, osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis and cartilage destruction) may be exactly dernonstrated. MRI has been established as a highly sensitive and accurate procedure of early AVN (bone marrow edema). Late changes are depicted because of hypointense fibrous tissue and sclerotic bone.

If c1inically a space-occupying lesion of the masticatory space is suspected, spiral computed tomography -enhanced and non-enhanced -is a well-accepted routine imaging procedure. Improved differential diagnostic criteria and topographie information are provided by the additional use of magnetic resonance imaging. Standard MRI evaluation includes a head coil examination with T2-and T1-weighted TSE sequences, enhanced and non-enhanced (0.1 mmol Gd-DTPAlkg BW). If the c1inical examination gives an indication about the presence of a space-occupying lesion of the temporo-mandibular joint and masticatory space, MRI should be the first examination following conventional radiography.

The aim of palliative stenting is to improve the quality of life particularly in patients with inoperable gastroduodenal outlet obstruction by relieving vomitting and permitting oral food intake. Also a small group of patients with stenoses secondary to chronic ulcers of the pylorus or duodenum resistant to conservative treatment may benefit from stenting as an alternative treatment to surgery. Before stent placement an accurate diagnosis is important to chose between acurative and a palliative approach. Besides CT an upper gastrointestinal Barium study is helpful to evaluate the length and the location of the stenosis. Insertion of stents via gastrostomy or the pyrolus has been described. At our institution all interventions are performed on a tilt-table with digital fluoroscopy and with endoscopic assistance using the working channel of the endoscope to advance a stiff guidewire through the stenosis. Thereafter a self-expanding vascular Wallstent (Schneider Euorope, B\u00fclach) with a diameter of 16 mm and a lenght of 56 mm fully expanded is advanced over the guidwire via the working channel of the endoscope which allows for an easier passage through the generally dilated stomach particularly when the stent has to he advanced far into the duodenum. Correct deployment of the stent is controlled under f1uoroscopy. In contrast to others we do not perform balloon dilatation before stent placement. Usually spontaneous stent expansion is sufficient within a few hours so that dilatation after stent placement is not necessary. We favour the 16 mm vascular rolling membrane Wallstents on contrast to other stents with larger diameters because of the good longitudinal f1exibility and adequate radial force. The immediate technical success rate can be expected at 89 to 100% with successful palliation of symptoms in 78 to 100% according to the literature and our own experience. No major complications have been described today.

Methods and Materials: Since the early ninties self-expanding metal stents are available for the symptomatic treatment of high-grade esophageal obstructions. The stent design was changed several times. Currently, the typical metal stent for esophageal use is self-expanding and covered with a polymer coating to prevent tumor ingrowth and to seal esophago-respiratory fistulas. The diameter of the fully expanded stents is about 20 mm. Stents are placed in conscious sedation under fluoroscopie guidance. The implantation can be performed as an outpatient procedure. Results: Several prospective trials have shown unique technical and functional success rates of above 95%. The procedure-related rnortality rate in most series is 0%. The most frequent complication of 5244 Carcinomas of the colon and rectum are common in the United States; the estimated annual incidences is more that 150 000 new cases. The incidence of obstruction in patients with colonic carcinoma ranges from 7% to 29%. Emergency surgery in a patient with an unprepared colon ls associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. The traditional surgical management of left-sided malignant large-bowel obstruction consists of a two-stage operation (Hartmann's procedure) that includes primary tumor removal and end colostomy with a subsequent colostomy closure because the are unfit for surgery or refuse further operation. Colostomy closure is not a simple procedure; the morbidity is as high as 37% and the mortality rate ls around 7%.",

            "text": "16:00-17:30 This review will summarize mainly the current concepts about the diagnosis and treatment of intussusception. In many cases, the c1inical symptoms can be confusing. It is, therefore, desirable to use diagnostic tools that are as innocuous as possible. Sonography has a high diagnostic accuracy and it may lead to alternative diagnosis. US imaging of intussusception is complex. There are two bowel loops involved (the intussuscipiens or receptor and the intussusceptum or donor), but three bowel walls intervene because the intussusceptum is folded: the everted returning limb of intussusceptum with the intussuscipiens form the hypoechoic external ring of the doughnut image whereas the mesentery enclosing the entering limb of the intussusceptum forms the center: \"crescent-in-doughnut sign\". The presence of fluid inside the intussusception is significantly related to irreducibility and ischemia. The aim of a therapeutic enema is to safely reduce the greatest number of intussusceptions without producing perforation. The differences in reduction and perforation rates among the various therapeutic enemas are related more to perforations that occur prior to the enema, on patient selection criteria and on the pressure exerted within the colon than on the contrast material used. We prefer the use of hydrostatic US-guided enemas owing to the absence of radiation exposure. Helical technology has expanded the usefulness of CT in the evaluation of pediatric disease. There are some important advantages of helical CT compared to conventional CT. We can acquire a volume of scan data acquisition from which a contiguous series of images is reconstructed that can improve lesion depiction without increasing radiation exposure. Shorter scanning time allows contrast material-enhanced studies to be performed during peak vascular enhancement, reduce the volume of contrast medium used, help eliminate or decrease motion artifacts allowing high quality two or three-dimensional reconstruction and less sedation in needed. When finer detail and higher-resolution images are required, the overlapping section technique allows high quality two and three-dimensional reconstructions ( The integration of nuclear medicine techniques into pediatric radiology allows the investigation of children to be undertaken using low radiation burden techniques as weil as providing a combination of anatomical and functional data. In nepro-urology Nuclear Medicine is now the reference technique for the detection of a renal scar using Tc 99m DMSA. The search for vesioureteric reflux (VUR) is now possible with out the need for bladder catheterisation; the indirect radioisotope cystogram will allow the assessment of renal function, drainage of the upper tracts, assessment of bladder function and the visualisation of VUR. The isotope of choice for this investigation is Tc 99m MAG3. For children who are not toilet trained, the direct isotope cystogram offers the advantage of a very low radiation burden. In the investigation of sustained systemic hypertension in childhood, Tc 99m MAG3 is an early test to exclude renal aetiology of the hypertension, especially if the test is undertaken following the pharmacological stimulus of an ACE inhibitor (Captopril). Dynamic renal scintigraphy using Tc 99m DTPA is valuable in the assessment of the transplant kidney. All these examinations are undertaken in conjunction with a full ultrasound examination. In children with symptoms suspected to be skeletal in origin and a negative plain radiograph, a radioisotope bone scan may focus attention on the specific area which is the cause. Bone scans are also valuable in children with malignancy to search for deposits. Certain sarcomas (primary bonemalignancy) may show multiple drug resistance, this may be detected using Tc 99m MIBI.",

Male pelvis and scrotum: Technical advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), notably in high resolution MRI, have opened up new diagnostic applications in male pelvic pathology. A major indication is the preoperative staging of prostate cancer, where MRI is more reliable than other imaging modalities in differentiating between localized and advanced disease. In monitoring local recurrence after radical prostatectomy MRI is also valuable in differentiating scar tissue from new growth. In benign prostate disease, MRI effectively displays the congenital cysts that may be associated with infertiIity. Other disease, howevernotably benign prostatic hyperplasia -is generally an incidental finding. In isolated cases, MRI is also a valuable diagnostic aid in conditions of the penis, testes and scrotum, e.g. in the preoperative localization of ectopic testes in cryptorchidism. However, ultrasound remains the imaging modality of choice in the evaluation of benign and malignant intraserotal masses and in diagnosing acute scrotum.",

Vascular assessment is based on the pathophysiology of tumour angiogenesis and its diagnostic implications for tumour biology, prognosis, and therapy response. Two current techniques investigating vascular features in addition to morphology are Doppler ultrasonography and contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Diagnostic differentiation has been shown to be possible with Doppler, and a high degree of observed vascularity could be linked to an aggressive course of the disease. Dynamic MRI using gadolinium chelates is already used clinically to detect and differentiate tumours. The histologie correlation shows that capillary permeability is increased in malignant tumours and is the best criterion for differentiation from benign processes. Permeability and perfusion factors seem to be more diagnostic than overall vessel density. New clinical applications are currently being established for therapy monitoring. Further instrumental developments will bring harmonie imaging in Doppler, and faster imaging techniques, higher spatial resolution and novel pharmacokinetic concepts in MRI. Upcoming contrast agents for both Doppler and MRI will further improve estimation of intratumoural blood volume and vascular permeability.

After intravenous injection, nonspecific gadolinium-based contrast agents (CM) distribute in the extracellular space. Important criteria for the evaluation of dynamic MR mammography are the initial signal increase after CM administration, the following signal behavior, the kinetics of the CM uptake and the morphology of the CM-enhanced region. In contrast to benign lesions, most of the invasive breast carcinomas show typical signal changes in MTR mammography due to their pathologie angioneogenesis. Usually, they are characterized by a strong inital uptake (>100% compared to preCM imaging), a following plateau phase or wash out, a centropetal distribution of CM (rim sign) and/or ill-defined margins. In summary, MR mammography has a very high sensitivity (>98%) in the detection of invasive breast cancer. Some benign findings, however, can mimick malignant tumors. In contrast to invasive tumors, intraductal carcinomas of the breast (DCIS) often do not show typical changes due to the lack of sufficient angiogenesis. In some cases, dendritic CM uptake is seen in these tumors. However, the sensitivity of MR mammography for DCIS is low. The results of all series agreed in the high sensitivity of breast MRI in detecting invasive breast carcinomas whereas the results varies widely for in situ breast carcinomas. Despite some controversies, breast MRI appears to be a non specific imaging modality as far as the characterization of breast lesion is concerned. In the diagnosis of local relapses of breast neoplasms, series agreed in the higher sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, breast MRI should be the main modality used to exclude suspicious local relapses. In the diagnosis of palpable breast lesions, breast MRI can be used in highly selected cases where all other diagnostic modalities failed to exclude breast neoplasms. In the diagnosis of non palpable breast lesions imaging-guided biopsies had a higher sensitivity and specificity combined with a lower cost. Therefore, excepted and in some particular cases, breast MRI is not usefull. Some series have emphasized the high accuracy of breast MRI to determine the extent of invasive breast carcinomas. Therefore, some specialized centers currently used breast MRI combined with MRI-guided core biopsies in the preoperative evaluation of invasive breast neoplams. In all series carried out to determine the value of breast MRI in monitoring neo-adjuvant chemotherapy., breast MRI is by far the best imaging method to assess the extent of residual disease after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Moreover, breast MR imaging have proved useful in the follow up of women with silicone breast prostheses either for cosmetic reasons or after mastectomy.

However not all patients with an acute neurological deficit, but only those with strokes due to a sustained vascular occlusion can possibly benefit from fibrinolysis. Inadequate patient selection, based on plain CCT and clinical findings only, may be the reason why recently ECASS II has failed to proof the superiority of i.v, fibrinolysis over placebo. In the future neuroradiological techniques and expertise as on MRA, CT Angio, even DSA should become decisive tools for patient selection in advance of fibrinolytic stroke treatment. The meaning of stents for carotid angioplasty has recently become more evident. The concept to place a stent in order to fight intimal flaps only after flaps have occurred already is burdened with more complications than leaving the intimal flaps alone after angioplasty. In almost all ease however it is possible to place a selfexpandable stent in a carotid stenosis without a preceding dilatation. Primary placement and secondary dilatation avoids free floating flaps to occur and hence minimizes the risk of thrombembolisme. The status of the \"Stent Protected Angioplasty versus Carotid Endarterectomy\" (SPACE) trial ls to be reported. Imaging in stroke victims has two objectives: (1) to assess the immediate pathophysiological state of the cerebral circulation and tissue and (2) to assess the underlying vascular disease. Diagnosis of the underlying disease will help in the choice of adaequate secondary prophylaxis. Assessment of the brain's current pathophysiological state is aprerequisite to choosing adaequate treatment and is the more urgent of the two objectives. The imaging modality should reliably differentiate cerebral ischemia from other causes of a sudden central nervous deficit and should be able to differentiate early on normal brain tissue from tissue at risk and from tissue already irreversibly damaged. Historically, vascular imaging was developed first and provided the rationale for the surgery in cases of high grade carotid stenoses and for prophylaxis with antiplatelet agents. Brain tissue imaging with CT later allowed both the diagnosis of ischemic stroke and thrombolytic treatment which has recently been shown to be beneficial. A variety of new tools are now available for vascular and tissue imaging: Ultrasound, CT-angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS), single photon emission tomography, and positron emission tomography. Computed tomography and MRI/MRS are most promising for meeting the above-mentioned objectives in the c1inical setting of acute stroke. Imaging of perfusion and diffusion by magnetic resonance is highly sensitive and specific for irreversible tissue damage. fts prospective In primary tubereulosis radiologie findings may vary between normal to hilar and mediastinallymphadenomegaly, and/or smalI, ill defined opaeities to frank lobar eonsolidation assoeiated with Iymphadenomegaly and/or pleural effusion. Reactivation tuberculosis presents in many different radiologie patterns. Typically, predominantly apical, inhomogenous densities with frequent cavitation are encountered. Rarely consolidation and eavitation of a eomplete segment or lobe may oecur. Endobronchial seeding results in bronehopneumonie foei in rarely affected segments. Infected Iymph nodes may erode into a major bronchus or the airway mucosa may be involved resulting in emphysema or atelectasis. Hematogenous spread result in a miliary pattern of small interstitial nodules. Tubereulomas, usually weil circumscribed granulomatous masses with frequent calcification, may oceasionally develop. Altered immunity due to AIDS, transplantation, haematologic or other malignancies may further affect the radiologie presentation. Pleura may be involved, usually in conjunction with peripheral tubereulous foci, and longstanding, unexplained pleural effusion must arouse suspicion of tubereulous pleuresy. Chest X-rays are usually suffieient for diagnosis in most cases of pulmonary tuberculosis. CT, either conventional or HRCT, is used to investigate activation, cavitation, progression, hemoptysis and/or other complications. The essence of radiology is reducing large data volumes, esp. of helical CT and MRI, into speedy relevant information facilitating clinical decision making and surgical navigation, resp. minimal invasive therapy. Pattern recognition is the key to success. Ten years of experience have proven graphie workstations to be basic tools in disease pattern analysis rendering hard copy reading less reliable.

Although these simple teehniques give useful information within the right chambers of the heart, their application is somewhat restrictive. Development of pharmaceutical microbubble formulations have recently been introduced allowing a wider area of clinical application. These have the ability to cross the pulmonary vascular bed allowing a persistence in the blood for a sufficient period of time. Sonographie blood flow imaging methods have proven to be extremely useful for assessing valvular heart disease and other anatomical defects within the ventricles and major vessels. They have been established as a diagnostic method for primary vascular evaluation, organ perfusion and tumour vascularity as weil. Ultrasound contrast agents designed for enhancing the backscatter from blood contribute to improve ultrasound examinations where difficulties are experienced due to lack of signal from vasculature. Clinical studies have shown that due to an increase in signal intensity of upto 20 dB with echo enhancers, c1inical examinations proven to be undiagnostic improved diagnostic confidence after enhancement. This presentation discusses ways in In this course, the principles of Spiral CT will be reviewed. Particular emphasis will be put on image quality considerations. It is accepted that there are no significant drawbacks to spiral CT; in fact, the inherent continuous scanning in the longitudinal direction (z axis) provides advantages for 3D resolution. Technical developments will also be summarized and discussed. Spiral CT is now available on practically all CT systems. Further developments aim for higher efficiency, in particular by using multirow detector systems, and higher f1exibility. Anatomically adapted tube current modulation is one technique which is specifically suited for spiral CT and which allows for significant dose reduction. Spiral CT offers c1ear advantages for standard c1inical applications due to the short volume scan times. It also has provided a number of new applications, as for example CT angiography, cardiac imaging with ECG oriented reconstructions, support of computer-aided surgery, and lowdose procedures. The technical background of these techniques will be explained in detail, c1inical examples and results will also be presented. Technical developments in probe technology, digital multi-channel beamformers and software evolutions have contributed to improved image quality, making ultrasound a reliable modality in breast imaging. High frequency: where 7 MHz was standard until recently, modern equipment uses frequencies of 10 MHz and higher; this is made possible by the high signal-to-noise ratio and broadband capabilities of modern equipment. Multi-D array: the problem of near field focusing of linear probes is improved by using multiple rows of crystals, making focusing in the elevation plane possible, and reducing slice thickness and thus partial volume effects. Real-time panoramic ultrasound: this modality makes it possible to make cross seetions up to 60 cm; the image is acquired in real-time, without need of position sensors.

Pavone; Rome/I MR Cholangiography has been introduced in clinical practice at the beginning of this decade, although most of c1inical series have been published in the mid '90s. In the early phase, it seemed that this technique would have been just another fancy sequence, with low clinical impact. However, further experience have shown that MR cholangiography can offer consistent and reproducible results and may indeed play an important clinical role. All papers published on the different potential applications of MR eholangiography have always provided very consistent results, with 90% accuracy in the definition of each disease. These results have been obtained with use of different equipments, and both high and medium field strenght equipments may provide the same type of data. The only technical requirment to fulfill is the use of powerful gradients, with strenght over 15 mT/m. All currently available equipments have this kind of gradients installed and therefore we can state that MR Cholangiography can be performed basically in every center.",

It is important to stress the fact that, thanks to this new technique, the radiologist is now being able to play once again an important role in the management of these patients, characterising the biliary disease and defining the most proper type of treatment. A final area of concern for radiologists is in trends for current practice of ERCP. There is decreasing interest in the quality of ERCP radiographie images demonstrated by endoscopists, as weil as radiologists. There is also a tendency towards locating ERCP f1uoroscopy units outside the Department of Radiology. Shifting diagnostic emphasis to MRCP will address these concerns. MRCP has gained wide-spread acceptance for the diagnosis of cholangiolithiasis. Its role in the evaluation of other biliary diseases is less welldefined. For assessment of biliary diseases, T2w single-shot thick-slab images show gross morphology. For anatomie detail, T2w multi-slice breath-hold pulse sequences should be obtained in at least two planes (coronal/oblique and axial). In patients with hilar strictures, ERCP and PTC often can not visualize the whole biliary system and define the extent of strictures. MRCP demonstrates distal and proximal end of strictures without the risk of inducing sepsis. By supplementing MRCP with fat-suppressed T2w TSE and contrast-enhanced T1w images, tumor staging and assessment of resectability can be done in one examination. MRCP is very promising for evaluation of patients with suspected complications after biliary surgery, such cholecystectomy, bilio-enteric anastomosis, and Iiver transplantation. Bilomas, anastomotic strictures, leakage, and stones can be detected. In children with congenital biliary anomalies, MRCP allows exact 3D-visualization of intra-and extrahepatic biliary cysts before surgery. MRCP is the method of choice for evaluation of high strictures and postoperative biliary complications. It allows non-invasive assessment of resectability of hilar tumors. In non-surgical patients, MRCP helps to define the best interventional access to achieve biliary drainage.",

However, we may consider MRCP a democratic technique: in fact, it is possible to obtain high level diagnostic images with low, medium and high field equipments. The only truly important technical requirement is the use of high power gradient (over 15 mT/m). When low or medium field systems are used, a non breath hold Turbo Spin Echo sequence is employed. At high field is nowadays possible to acquire images of the biliary and pancreatic ducts using the half Fourier technique, obtaining images in very few seconds. With these lalter imaging procedures it is also possible to perform dynamic studies (Le. of the pancreatic duct after secretin injection). Further improvement are expected in the future, but we can consider already now MRCP a mature technique, able to find a consistent clinical role in pancreatobiliary imaging. As far as biliary diseases are concerned, we may consider MRCP mostly in two importants c1inical roles: the evaluation of patients with suspected common bile duct stones, and the evaluation of symptomastic patients after laparoseopie cholecystectomy. In the first group of patients, MRCP may act as a screening procedure in those patients presenting mild symptoms, and with negative of doubtful USo The prevalence of stone disease in these patients is only 27-30%, and the goal is to avoid ERCP with simple diagnostic role in a large number of patients.

The CT assessment was focused on the neural plexus invasion around superior mesenteric artery (SMA) because it is an important prognostic factor. On the basis of changes around SMA, the CT criteria was established as folIows: grade 0, normal; grade 1, minimum increase in density; grade 2, strandlike structures; and grade 3, mass formation. Additionally, inferior peripancreatic veins (IPV) were evaluated. The CT images were evaluated by three radiologists and correlated with pathological findings. Results: The neural plexus invasion was pathologically confirmed in nine patients with pancreatic carcinoma and in seven patients with CBD carcinoma. The CT scans allowed for 81% in accuracy for pancreatic carcinoma and 100% in accuracy for CBD carcinoma. The false-positive was seen in three patients with pancreatic carcinoma, which was mainly caused by secondary pancreatitis. The evaluation of IPV improved the detection of neural plexus invasion. Conclusion: Helical CT can sufficiently diagnose the neural plexus invasion due to carcinomas of the pancreatic head-region. All studies were performed on a 1.5 T during one breath-hold (TR = 6.3 rns, TE =3.0 ms, FA =70\u00b0, slice thickness = 5 mm) using a phasedarray coil. The results concerning the vascular status were compared with surgical and histological findings. Results: In 23 out of 33 patients (70%) a carcinoma was proven. In 18 out of these 23 patients a comparison between MRI findings and surgical results was possible. In 78% (14/18) a vascular infiltration was present, which could be correctly diagnosed in 13 patients (93%). The overall accuracy of the True FISP technique in predicting vascular involvement in general was 94%. An involvement of the arterial system could be surgically verified in 10/18 (56%) cases, whereas a portalvenous involvement was present in 13/18 (72%) cases. The corresponding accuracies of True FISP were 94%, and 89% respectively. Conclusion: The True FISP technique shows a high accuracy in . predicting vascular status in the abdomen. Therefore this method can be used alternatively or in addition to MR angiography. Results: From all malignant primary pancreatic tumors (n =105) there were 73.3% adenocarcinomas. Benign lesions (n = 28) included 78.6% patients with chronic pancreatitis. Four malignant lesions were pancreatic metastases of other carcinomas. In assessing vascular infiltration, the overall accuracy of MR-angiography was 90.2%. In the evaluation of liver metastases, MR showed an overall accuracy of 89.3%. In view of the prime airn, to seperate the operable from the inoperable patients, MR had a sensitivity of 97.3%, a specificity of 88.3% and an overall accuracy of 93.3%. Conclusion: The \"one-stop-shopping\" MR approach provides the surgeon with all the necessary information prior to pancreatic surgery. By avoiding conventional angiography, ERCP and eventually CT the concept will provide for a reduction of costs with increased time efficiency. Purpose: To assess the value of interactive 'all-in-one' magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnosis and treatment planning in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Methods and Materials: Interactive MRI was performed by an experienced radiologist in 283 patients with suspected pancreatic disease. A standardized protocol consisting of snapshot double echo HASTE, snapshot black blood HASTE, and snapshot turbo FLASH were always used. If required, dynamic breath hold RARE imaging, contrastenhanced FLASH imaging and/or time-resolved MR angiography were performed in the same session. The results for diagnosis and preoperative staging of pancreatic adenocarcinoma were assessed retrospectively. Histology and/or c1inical follow-up were used as gold standard. Results: In 268/283 patients, a c1eardiagnosis could be proposed after interactive MRI. In this patient group, the sensitivity and specificity of MRI for diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n = 73) was 93% and 95% respectively. The positive predictive value for diagnosis of resectability was 89%. Conclusion: Interactive 'all-in-one' pancreatic MRI is a new concept that may become the 'one-stop shopping' diagnostic approach in many patients with suspected pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Purpose: The purpose of this prospective study was the comparison of MRI after administration of Mn-DPDP and endosonography for the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic tumors. Methods and Materials: 30 patients with suspected pancreatic tumors underwent MRI and endosonography. MRI imaging was performed with a 1.0 Imager (Magneton Impact, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Mn-DPDP was injected in a dose of 5 umollkg b.w.. T1-weighted gradient echo and T2-weighted fast spin echo sequences were employed 3 hrs after administration of the contrast agent. A pathologic diagnosis was obtained in all cases with surgery (n =23) or biopsies (n =7), resulting in 27 carcinomas. Results: Overall diagnostic sensitivity was 97% for endoscopic US and 91% for MRI. Specificity was 97% for endoscopic US and 97% for MRI. The sensitivity for the detection of tumors less than 2 cm in diameter was 94% for endoscopic US and 88% for MRI. Conclusion: Endoscopic US is still more accurate than MRI in the diagnosis of pancreatic tumors, particularly for tumors less than 2 cm in diameter.",

Each investigation is evaluated according to achecklist concerning tumor localisation, tumor extension, infiltration of duodenum and vessels, and Iymph node status, The results were compared to those of the corresponding endo-sonography. Gold standard was laparascopy or tumor free follow-up >6 months. Results: Four of 61 tumors were detected with spiral CT only, one with endosonography only. For tumor localisation, no significant differences were found between spiral CT and endo-sonography. Regional Iymph nodes were detected more reliantly with spiral CL Only spiral CT was able to visualize the relation to arterial and venous vessel structures. Infiltration of duodenum was detected with spiral CT in 58%, with endosonography in 45%. Conclusion: Therapy decision in pancreatic cancer is highly dependant of tumor localisation and extension. Therefore exact diagnostic is of great value. Hydro-spiral-CT delivers relevant and exact information superior to endo-sonography and is recommended despite its high expenditure. Purpose: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of dual-phase helical CT for detection and loco-regional staging of patients with suspected pancreatic cancer. Methods and Materials: 43 patients (26 F, 17 M, Mean age: 54 +/-7) with a suspicious pancreatic mass based on clinical symptoms, laboratory findings and results of ERCP or US were studied. Unhenanced scans of the liver and pancreas were followed by two sequential helical CT scans (5/5 mm collimation) acquired at 20 and 45 sec after l.v, bolus injection of 120 ce of an iodinated contrast agent at 4 mI/sec. CT images of both phases were blindly analyzed by !wo independent readers who were asked to evaluate on each phase tumor resectability and conspicuity. Results: In the 43 studies performed, a final diagnosis was available in 30 cases. There were 17 malignant and 13 benign lesions. Arterial-phase imaging showed the highest diagnostic accuracy for the assessment of celiac trunk invasion whereas portal-phase imaging resulted in the highest lesion conspicuity and superior mesenteric vein opacification. Overall, dual-phase helical CT showed an accuracy for tumor detection of 90%, with sensitivity of 94%, specificity of 85%, and positive and negative predictive value of 89% and 92%, respectively.

MR was performed at 1.5 T, using T2w TSE with and without fatsat; T1w SE and T1w GRE with and without fatsat before and after mangafodipir trisodium. Bi-phasic enhanced helical CT (150 ml, 4 ml/s) was performed in the pancreatic (40 s delay) and portal venous phase (68-75 s delay). Findings were correlated with surgery, laparoscopy, biopsy, or follow-up. Results: Masses were present in 17 pts (careinoma, 9; focal pancreatitis, 8). Tumor staging was accurate in 9 pts with MR and in 8 with CT (1 false-positive). In 8 pts with pancreatitis, MR was correct in 6 (2 false-positive diagnoses of tumor) and CT in 5 (2 false-positive, 1 falsenegative). Accuracy for differentiation of cancer versus focal pancreatitis was 82% (CT) and 88% (MR). Conclusion: Mangafodipir-enhanced MRI can improve detection and staging of pancreatic carcinoma, as compared to bi-phasic helical C'F, However, differentiation of carcinoma versus focal pancreatitis at MRI and CT remains a c1inical problem. Purpose: To compare MnDPDP enhanced MRI and CECT for diagnosis and staging of pancreatic carcinoma. Methods and Materials: Nineteen patients with known or suspected pancreatic carcinoma were evaluated with MRI and CT. Unenhanced T11T2, and T1 images 20 minutes and 24 hours following MnDPDP were obtained at 1.0 T. CT was performed during the pancreatic and portal venous phases of enhancement. Scans were assessed for the presence of a pancreatic mass, extraglandular extension, vascular involvement, Iymphadenopathy, peritoneal spread and hepatic metastases. Imaging and surgical findings were then compared. Results: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma was diagnosed histologically in 15/19 (79%) patients. MRI and CT both identified 15/15 (100%) tumours. Clear evidence of non-resectability was identified in 6 patients at MRI, who did not progress to surgery. CT findings were equivocal in one of these cases, Nine patients progressed to laparoscopy (n = 2) or laparotomy (n = 7). Resectability was correctly assessed in 7/9 (77.8%) on MRI and 6/9 (66.7%) by Cl. Overall accuracy for reseclabilily was 86.7% for MRI and 73.3% for C'I, Liver metastases were demonstrated by MRI and CT in 3/15 patients. Indeterminate liver lesions on CT in 2 patients were shown to be benign on MRI. Conclusion: MRI performed better than CT in assessing resectability and evaluating associated liver lesions.

Together with the essential digital palpation, the Transrectal Ultrasonography (TRUS) has achieved considerable significance for preoperative local staging of the rectal carcinoma. Until now, no publication regarding the evaluation of sphincter infiltration by means of TRUS was available. Therefore, it was of interest to investigate the value of TRUS in the preoperative assessment of tumor infiltration into the anal canal. Methods and Materials: 38 patients (24 male, 14 female, mean age of 65) with bioptic verified lower rectal carcinoma (up to 12 cm from the anal verge) were given a TRUS examination (B and K Medical, 360 0 rotating 7-10 MHz endoprobe). In all cases with infiltration into the anal canal, differentiation was made between infiltration of the mucosa, internal and external sphincter museie respectively. All results were compared with the histopathology of the surgical specimens. Results: Within our patients, we found in 12 cases a histopathologicallyproven infiltration of the anal canal. In 11 cases this was correctly diagnosed by means of TRUS; and, furthermore, the extent and depth of the infltration was determined. In one patient, the sphincter infiltration was underestimated, in two cases overestimated. Altogether there was an accuracy of 92%, a specificity of 92% and a sensitivity of 91%. Conclusion: TRUS can detect an infiltration in the anal canal with great accuracy and therefore plays an important role in the preoperative evaluation of lower rectal carcinomas.",

In all cases T1 and T2 weighted sequences were employed (T1 gradient echo breath hold; T2: breath hold Turbospin-echo; non breath hold Turbo spin-echo; HASTE). Non breathhold Turbo-spin-echo sequences were acquired with high resolution matrix (360 x 512). Preparation was performed using an enema of positive (n. 10; diluted solution of Gd-DTPA, Schering) or negative (n.4; Lumirem, Guerbet) contrast agent. Images obtained on different sequences were compared, for both the evaluation of anatomical and pathological features. Results: Anatomical layers of the rectal wall were evident in all images. In pathological cases, the evidence of the muscolaris propria proved to be an important anatomicallandmark to define the stage of the disease, in patients with cancer. Stage 111 (n. 4) cases, with muscolaris propria infiltration were differentiated from stage land 11 cases (n. 3). In one larger tumor the extrarectaI extent of the tumor was weil defined. Conclusion: Use of phased array technology provides consistent anatomical detail and allows evidence of rectal cancer with good definition of the information needed to perform a correct staging. Purpose: Our goal is to prospectively analyse the value of high resolution MRI versus CT in predicting the extent of a locally advanced primary or recurrent rectal cancer. Methods and Materials: Nineteen patients with proven cancer were evaluated with standard CT and MRI at 1.5 T with a phased array coil. The CT and MR images were independently scored for invasion of 9 neighbouring pelvic structures and the results were compared with surgery and histology. Results: Invasion occurred 50 times in 18 patients. Most commonly involved were the presacral space, the piriform muscles and the internal genitals. MRI demonstrated 98% sensitivity, 97% specificity, 92% PPV and 99% NPV. For CT these figures were: 75% sensitivity, 79% specificity, 59% PPV and 88% NPV.

Methods and Materials: Forty-one patients who underwent within a period of three days both abdominal (liver, renal and pancreas) intraarterial DSA and contrast-enhanced MRA responded a six items questionnaire about their experiences and preferences for both procedures. Results: 76% prefer MRA, DSA is the examination of first choice for 14%, the remaining 10% did not have any preference. Because of ciaustrophobia 3 patients will refuse MR in the future, 11 patients don't want to undergo future DSA due to bad experiences. The average rating score in the non-claustrophobic patient is 7.6 for MRA and 5.6 for DSA on a ten point scale. Non-invasiveness of the MRA was mentioned by most patients as an enormous advantage. Conclusion: Breathhold CE-MRA is very weil tolerated and the \"examination of choice\" for the non-claustrophobic patient. If the diagnostic performance of 3D CE MRA is the same or better than of DSA, MRA should be the first step in the workup of patients for examining the vascular system. Methods and Materials: 22 L, 9 PK and 9 0 who underwent MRA and DSA within a 3 days interval were studied. The following costs per examination were analyzed: radiologist time, technician time, materials, contrast medium and equipment depreciation. The MR and DSA procedures were performed by one radiologist and two technicians. MR and DSA room costs per hour (includes 1 radiologist + 2 technicians + depreciation) is 584 and 284 US$ resp. Results: MR and DSA total costs =room + contrast + materials + data processing costs + review costs. Methods and Materials: Patients scheduled for biopsy of a c1in ical, mammographie or sonograph ie abnormality were included and underwent preoperative dynamic MRI on Siemens 1.0 (162 valid lesions 5 mm) or 1.5 Tesla (357 valid lesions~5 mm) using FLASH-3D (87 sec) before and 5 times after standardized bolus of 0.2 mmol Gd-DTPAlkg.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced MR imaging in the detection of intraductal and minimally invasive breast cancer. Methods and Materials: Retrospectively the results of c.e. MR imaging were compared with histopathologie evaluation in a group of 41 patients with lCIS (n = 4), DCIS (n =26) and minimally invasive breast cancer (n = 11). C.e. MRI was performed with FLASH 3D and 0.2 mmol Gd\u00b7DTPA per kg body weight. Results: In patients with DCIS and minimally invasive cancer enhancement was strong (50%), intermed iale (40%) and IiUle or not significant (10%). 60% exhibited delayed enhancement. Focal contrast uptake occurred in 80% (among them 15% along ducts). All lCIS demonstrated delayed enhancement. Conclusion: The enhancement behaviour was typical for malignancy (fast, focal, iII-eircumscribed or along ducts) in only about 50% of in situ carcinoma . Little or no enhancement does not allow reliable exclusion of noninvasive malignancy. Results: In 20 cases arterial anatomy was scored identically. In 5 palients the same variant anatomy was identified on MRA and DSA. One variant was missed on DSA. MRA failed to elucidate exact arterial anatomy in 2 cases. More stenoses were identified on MRA due to its 3-D character. Peripheral arterial detail was less in MRA. The portal system was better seen by MRA. DSA failed to identify 2 thrombosed portal veins. On MRA 78 collateral areas were seen whereas DSA was able to depict 27. MRA showed with excellent detail the venous system, DSA failed to do so. In DSA three disseclions and one serious vasovagal reaction occurred, MRA was performed without any complications. Conclusion: Breathhold CE-FS-Turbo-MRA can replace La. DSA in the workup of OlT candidates. Purpose: To evaluate dynamic contrast-enhanced EPI sequence on a new developed gradient system (power track 3000) and to compare to contrast enhanced turbo field echo sequence in MR-mammography. Methods and Materials: Fifteen patients with suspected lesions in the breast were examined with a Philips 1.0 Tesla MR Gyroscan, equipped with the power track gradient system (23 mT). Dynamic contrast imaging was performed twice, once with the EPI imaging and once with turbo field echo imaging (TFE). Resulting images from the same patient were compared and read out by three radiologists (1 expert, 1 fellow, 1 beginner to MR) and judged in terms of image resolution, signal to noise ratio, artifacts and overall diagnostic value. Results: Preliminary results have shown that dynamic centrastenhanced EPI sequence is superior to the TFE sequence in terms of artifacts with a 3 mm slice thickness covering the entire breast. In particular, better resolution and less pulsation artifacts in the phase encoding direction were encountered in the axillar region, thus enabling to see lateral tumor masses as weil as Iymph nodes more ciearly. Conelusion: The EPI sequence should replace the TFE sequence in dynamic contrast enhanced MR-mammography, if the scanner is equipped with a high strength gradient. In dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, characteristic enhancement profiles are used to differentiate between benign and malignant neoplasm. This method is based on the assumption that microvascular morphology is altered in malignant lesions. However, in some cases enhancement profiles of lesions classified as malignant or benign respectively overlap. This can lead to false-positive, but also falsenegative diagnostic results. In order to investigate possible reasons for these uncharacteristic enhancement profiles, we have been analyzing tumor microvascular structures by electron microscopy. Methods and Materials: Using conventional electron microscopy we established a typical histopathological \"basic vascular profile\" of muscular and non-muscular vessels of benign lesions, and of feeding vessels and immature tumor vessels in vascular hot spots of carcinomas. In order to account for vascular leakiness, the following factors have to be investigated: absence or presence, thickness, and nature ofthe vascular basement membrane; presence of pericytes; number and nature of endothelial cells with presence of fenestration; and the nature of cell-cell contacts. After establishing the \"basic vascular profile\" we have been analyzing lesions which -according to dynamic MRI-were \"mimickers\" of benign or malignant lesions. Results: Although the study is not completed yet, preliminary results are very promising and might yield insights into untypical enhancement behavior. were localized and removed. Histologie findings were directly correlated with imaging results. Results: 72 Patients had a malignant tumor (68 stage pT1 or 2). 32% showed multifocal disease. Out of these mammography and sonography demonstrated all foci in 63%, MRM in 81%. In 12 patients (16%) additional biopsies based solelyon MR findings were performed (histologically 5 additional ipsilateral tumors (mean size 6 mm), 1 contralateral carcinoma, 6 benign findings). The rate of biopsies revealing additional malignant foci was 50% of all MR based biopsies and 8% of all cases. 5 invasive tumors (size 1 to 7 mm) and 7 intraductal carcinomas were not detected by MRM. Conelusion: Although MRM detects more small multifocallesions than mammography and sonography (potential benefit in 8% of cases) the prognostic value in breast conserving treatment inciuding radiation therapy remains uncertain. Disadvantages are 50% false positive biopsies and a considerable false negative rate. (C) a circular ROI as largest as possible within the lesion; (0) an irregular ROI contouring the lesion.

The correlation between HRCT scores & ST was statistically significant. Conclusion: Clinically & radiographically occult emphysema is a common activity in heavy smokers. HRCT is an excellent modality to detect emphysema in this group. Results: In CFA patients without emphysema (CFApURE), disease extent correlated best with DLCO (r = -0.77, p < 0.00005); the magnitude of correlation was reduced when CFAEMPH cases were included. CFAEMPH patients were characterized by relative preservation of TLC (p < 0.00005) but a greater depression of KCO (p < 0.00005) when compared to CFA pURE. The functional influence of emphysema in CFA was dependent on its location relative to the fibrosis: emphysema that was intermingled with fibrosis was independently associated with preservation of spirometric volumes (FEV1, p < 0.0005; FVC, p < 0.001), whereas emphysema that was remote from fibrosis was an independent determinant of a preservation of residual volume (p < 0.005). Conclusion: Concurrent emphysema modulates the functional effects of CFA but the impact of emphysema is dependent on its distribution relative to fibrotic lung.",

Suga, T. Tsukuda, N. Kume, H. Awaya, K. Takano, N. Matsunaga; Ube/J Purpose: The relationship between abnormal diaphragm/chest wall (D/CW) motions and regional hyperinflation in pulmonary emphysema was evaluated by the comparisons between dynamic breathing MR imaging and 133XeSPECT. Methods and Materials: Breathing MR was performed utilizing Turbo-FLASH or HASTE sequences in mid-coronal and sagittal planes in 24 patients with emphysema including 9 patients who underwent lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS), and for controls in 6 normal subjects. With an acquisition time of 25-30 sec, 20-22 sequential images were produced at a single, fixed plane over 2-3 respiratory cycles of slow, deep breathing, which were viewed in a cine-Ioop format. Fusion MR displays of maximal inspiratory and expiratory imaging, and timedistance curves (TDCs) were used for analysing respiratory D/CW motions. Regional lung ventilation was quantified by 133Xe retention index (RI) on three-dimensional 133XeSPECT displays. Results: Compared to normal subjects with regular and synchronous D/CW motions, all the patients with hyperinflated thoraces due to marked 133Xe retention showed reduced, irregular or asynchronous D/CW motions with abnormal diaphragmatic configurations. Chest wall motion was focally reduced in the locations with marked 133Xeretention. Maximal amplitude of D/CW motions (MADM/MACWM) and the length of apposition of the diaphragm (LAD) in the hemithoraces with 133Xe RI > 50% (n = 11) were significantly reduced than those in the hemithoraces with less 13 3Xe RI (n = 37) (P < .05). Overall, these parameters were significantly reduced in the patients than those in normal subjects (P < .0001, P < .001, and P < .01, respectively). After LVRS, with reduction in 133Xe RI, all 9 patients showed improvements of abnormal D/CW motions with significant increases in MADM/MACWM compared to preoperation (47.5 mm \u00b1 15.7 vs 36.3 mm \u00b1 8.6; P < .01, and 20.8 mm \u00b1 8.4 vs 15.5 mm \u00b1 7.4; P < .0001, respectively). In this study we aimed to determine whether HRCT can detect lung abnormality in those asymptomatic patients. Methods and Materials: Twenty-eight symptomatic patients with history of ingesting Sauropus androgynus were evaluated with HRCT in full inspiration and full expiration and pulmonary function testing. Fourteen patients further received methacholine provocative test for airway hyperresponsiveness. Results: Pulmonary functions of these patients were within normal limits (FEV 1 = 91.3% \u00b1 10.4 predicted; FEV 1/FVC = 83.3% \u00b1 4.9;",

Expiratory HRCT showed remarkable mosaic attenuation in non-dependent parts indicating air-trapping in 20 patients (71%), while none showed bronchial dilation. The positive airway hyperresponsiveness (10/14, 71%) was significantly associated with expiratory airtrapping signs (p =0.02) which suggested subtle bronchiolar injury by Sauropus androgynus. Conclusion: HRCT is more sensitive than conventional lung function test to detect subclinical small-airway injury in asymptomatic patients after ingestion of Sauropus androgynus. HRCT of the lung at inspiration and expiration before volume reduction surgery. Methods and Materials: In 10 patients with severe emphysematous lung changes, candidates for possible volume reduction surgery, a spirometrically standardized CT ot the lung was obtained (Somatom Plus 4, Siemens, Germany). The HRCT scans were performed with 2 mm slice thickness and 25 mm slice interval at 80% and 20% of the actual vital capacity (VC). For the whole lung, for each lobe, and for each slice the mean density and the emphysema index values were calculated. The results for inspiration (80% VC) and exspiration (20% VC) were compared. Results: HRCT of the lung allows quantification of the emphysematous changes. Separate analysis of the lobes of the lung and of each CT slice shows regional differences in severity of emphysema. Comparison of scans at inspiration and at expiration enables the identification of Jung parts that are less ventilated. Conclusion: Quantitative assessment of emphysema in candidates for lung-volume reduction surgery is potentially useful in showing the distribution of emphysematous changes and of non-ventilated lung regions. oxygen mixture for the examination. The respiratory status of the patients was monitored by an integrated spirometer, the scans were automatically triggered at 80% of the vital capacity. Breathing-curves were displayed on the CT-monitorin real-time modus. We performed two spiral-scans in single-breath technique in each patient, one plain-scan and one xenon enhanced scan imaging the whole lung. Subtraction of the plain and xenon scans allowed generation of multiplanar ventilation maps. Evaluation was done on a PC-workstation. Results: The measurements showed a mean xenon enhancement of about 100 H.U.. Local ventilation was in good agreement with clinical findings, local ventilation disorders such as emphysematous bullae could be detected. Spatial resolution was superior to competing methods such as scintigraphy. Conclusion: Xenon enhanced CT allows imaging of local lung ventilation and detection of ventilation disorders. Sreathing motion between plain and xenon scan remains a problem. Therefore, data-matching has to be improved by further software efforts and re-registration.",

Despite the excellent correlation with conventional cystoscopy in tumors bigger than 10 mm, the method may fall to depict subtle changes and sessi/e tumors arising from the bladder wall. To improve the sensitivity of virtual endoscopy we developed a computer algorithm which color-codes the wall thickness of hollow organs. Methods and Materials: Three patients with known bladder tumors were scanned using thin section unenhanced spiral-Cl. We developed an algorithm, which computes the distance to the nearest neighbor on segmented axial images. Sy assigning a color to the wall thickness we created a three dimensional surface-shaded model. We imported this color-mapped model in our experimental virtual endoscopy software (VESA, GE) and compared our results with the source images. In this first test phase (three months) 10 models were assembled covering different surgery disciplines like maxillofa cial, craniofacia l or vascular surgery. Results: ABS-plastic models offer nearl y the same fields of application Iike the well-known stereolithography techn ique.

Purpose: To compare the enhancement characteristics of cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic liver after the administration of Gd-BOPTA (MultiHance , Bracco SpA.) . Methods and Materials: 14 cirrholic and 20 non-eirrhotic patients were imaged before and at 60-120 minutes after the iv administration of Gd-BOPTA using T1-W spin echo (SE) and T1-W gradient echo (GRE) sequences . Cirrhosis was diagnosed by means of biopsy (n :: 6), surgical intervention (n :: 3) and clinical-radiological monitoring (n :: 5). Comparison was made of the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio and of the signal intensity enhancement before and after Gd-BOPTA administration. Contrast enhancement was classified qualititavely as either homogenous or heterogeneous. Results: Quantitative analysis of post-Gd-BOPTA images revealed that the SNR ratio was superior in cirrhotic Iiver than in healthy liver. Analogously, the signal intensity enhancement after Gd-BOPTA was super ior in cirrhotic Iiver on T1-W SE images (p = 0.02) and on inphase T1-W GRE images (P < 0.001). No statistical difference was observed for out-of-phase GRE images. Qualitilative analysis revealed the enhancement to be homogenous in 7/14 and heterogeneous in 7/14 patients on T1-W SE images, and heterogeneous in 9/14 and homogenous in 5/14 patients on GRE images. Heterogeneity was due to hypointense nodules in 7 patients and hyperintense nodules in 2 patients. Conclusion: Gd-BOPTA is an effective MR contrast agent for differentiating cirrhotic from non-cirrhotic Iiver. Purpose: To investigate the efficacy of Gd-BOPTA for the MR detection of lesions in cirrhotic livers. Methods and Materials: 33 patients with cirrhosis and known hepatic lesions underwent MRI in a Phase 11 multicenter study before and after administration of Gd-BOPTA at 0.05 or 0.10 mmol/kg. T1W (GRE and SE) and T2W images were evaluated tor lesion number, location, size and confidence by three off-site blinded reviewers. Findings were compared to gold standard imaging [IOUS (25), CT-AP (6), and lipiodol CT (2)]. Results: More lesions were identified on Gd-BOPTA-enhanced images than on unenhanced images. There was no significant difference in lesion detection between concentrations. The number of lesions identified increased from 35 to 47, 36 to 45 and 40 to 45 for reviewers A, B, and C, respectively. The number and concordance of detected lesions after contrast was statistically significant (p < 0.03) for 2 reviewers. The largest benefit was for detection of more sub-centimeter lesions (10 to 17, 10 to 14, 19 to 20) . GRE sequences permitted the detection of more lesions than SE sequences. When compared to gold standard there were fewer false positive lesions identified after contrast administration. Purpose: To assess the usefulness of spio particles in the detection and characterization of benign liver lesion. Methods and Materials: 19 patients with suspected benign liver tumor were studied bya .5 superconducting unit. Baseline and spio-enhanced axial SE T1, OPfT2, GE T2' images were obtained. All the patients underwent biopsy. Results: 38 lesions were found: 25 hemangiomas, 7 focal nodular hyperplasias, 6 adenomas. Spio-enhanced MR imaging showed 37/38 lesions: 25 hemangiomas , 7 foeal nodular hyperplasias and 5 adenomas. Baseline MR imaging showed 33/38 lesions : 25 hemangiomas , 5 focal nodular hyperplasias and 3 adenomas. Particularly, spio-enhaneed MR imaging showed 3 more adenomas and 2 more focal nodular hyperplasias. Instead, baseline MR imaging showed 1 more adenoma. Spio-enhanced MR imaging showed central scar in all focal nodular hyperplasias . Conversely, baseline MR imaging in only 3/7 tumors . All MR imaging diagnoses were confirmed by biopsy. Conclusion: Spio particles may improve detection and characterizat ion of adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia. Conversely, they do not seem to have a definite roje in the assessment of hemangioma. Purpose: To identify optimal pulse sequence or sequences combinat ion in MRI studies after SPIO infusion for HCC detection in cirrhotic patients. Methods and Materials: 36 cirrhotic patients with 42 histologie proved HCCs (1D-80 mm, mean 36, SO 16.7) were studied after SPIO infusion by 1T MRI unit using the following sequences: T1TFE breath hold (TR 15, TE 5, PPTI 450, FA 25, matrix 156 x 256), T2 TSE SPIR (TR 1900, TE 90, ETL 14 matrix 256 x 256), T2*FFE breath hold (TR 200, TE 21, FA 25, matrix 180 x 256).

Considering the SIR threshold for lesions detection 32/42 (76%) lesions were visible on T1TFE while 42/42 (100%) were detected on T2TSE and T2*TFE (P <.001). Regarding image quality T2TSE sequence was tound to give better anatomical details and tumor delineation with lower flow and movement artifacts. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that T2*FFE sequence provide best results in term of lesion conspicuity due to the high sensitivity to changes in magnetic susceptibility caused by SPIO particles . The drawback is a loss in image quality, low spatial resolution and flow artifacts. Mixed sequence implementation (GRASE, Gradient Spin Echo) will probably allows further improvements in image quality, combining better spatial resolution and high magnetic susceptibility sensitivity. contrast infusion based on a theoretical optimal Iiver-blood contrast assuming blood T1 = 1.2s and liver T1 similar to that of fat (-270 ms). Liver signal enhancement was determined from a breath-hold 2D T1 weighted FLASH sequence acquired pre-and post-contrast administration. Volume rendering, multi-planar reformats and maximum and minimum intensity projections were combined to integrate vessels, bile ducts and liver lesions and displayed in cine mode. Results: Average liver enhancement was 44%. Post-contrast signal comparison on the 3D data set yielded the following ratios between liver, blood, metastases, fluid (cysts) and bile against non-enhanced fat: 0.94, 0.40, 0.55, 0.16 and 2.43, respectively, used effectively for segmenting each structure prior to image display with volume rendering. The resulting MRA is flow independent. Conclusion: A single 3D T1 weighted data set can integrate Iiver MRA and MRCP to study their relationship with liver pathology after Mn-DPDP administration. Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic impact of SPIO-enhanced MRI in comparison to unenhanced MRI and contrast enhanced CT (CECT) in routine diagnostics of the liver. Methods and Materials: Prospectively, 373 patients suspicious for hepatic disease were studied by.CECT, unenhanced, and SPIO-enhanced MRI (breathhold GRET1-, fast SET2-, GRE-PD-weighted imaging at 1.5 Tesla). CECT and MRI were evaluated by 2 readers by consensus regarding number and characterization of focal hepatic lesions. The findings were correlated to histology (54%) and at least 12 month followup (46%). Additionally, the correlation was repeated after correcting the diagnoses only for the differentiation of malignant versus benign. Results: The diagnostic accuracy for CECT was 52%, for MRI 56%, for SPIO-MRI 63%, and for MRI together with SPIO-MRI 73%, respectively. After adjusting the diagnoses only for \"malignant\" and \"benign\" the accuracy increased for CECT to 78%, for MRI to 81%, for SPIO-MRI to 91%, and for MRI together with SPIO-MRI to 95%, respectively. In consequence, the higher diagnostic accuracy of SPIO-MRI caused a significant change of the subsequent therapy in 18% of the cases. Conclusion: In the general work-up of focal hepatic disease, SPIOenhanced MRI proved to be superior to CECT and unenhanced MRI affecting significantly the therapeutic procedere.",

In cases where the needle is not in the articulation, the pressure of introduction of the contrast medium disconnects the syringe from the needle. Results: No extra-articular injection or complications were found to occur. Time of execution was always less than 5 minutes. Conclusion: The method described makes it easy to render the articular cavity radio-opaque, at the same time preventing the risk of diffusion of the contrast medium in the para-articular tissues. The imposs ibility of injection using a needle that ls not properly positioned enables the manoeuvre to be performed without fluoroscopie control and safely thanks to the use of the above-mentioned syringe. The method reduces the amount of radiation and the time of execution , above all in candidates for arthro-MR, where the contrast medium is radiotransparent. Purpose: To evaluate the efficiency of puncture , aspiration and corticostero id injections (PACI) in painful rotator cuff calcifications. Methods and Materials: 50 shoulders were treated with PACI in 42 patients (mean age, 50 years) . All patients were referred after unsuccessful medical treatment. 97% of patients had supra and/or infra spinatus calcifications assessed with plain films. Treatment efficiency was evaluated and graded by a physician with a mean follow-up of 29 months . Results were classified as excellent (total relief of the pain), good (significant improvement), fair (mild improvement), and poor (no improvement). Results: Excellent results were observed in 62% of the patients; good results in 26% , fair results in 4%, and poor results in 8%. No significant adverse effect was observed. Conclusion: These results suggest that PACI is an efficient treatment in patients suffering from painful rotator cuff calcifications. PACI could therefore be proposed as an alternative to surgery in these patients . Purpose: To determine the accuracy and clinical value of an optical navigation system in CT-guided bone interventions. Methods and Materials: In a prospect ive study of 30 patients with bony lesions an optical navigation system assisting CT-interventions was tested. The bony lesions were in 16 patients osteoid osteomas which were treated by thermocoagulation and in 14 patients these were bony lesions requiring a biopsy. The optical navigation systsm registered the location of the CT-slices in the patient after which the puncture was performed outside the gantry under guidance of the optical navigation system. The puncture could be done in every desired plane (MPR). The main advantage of the system was the navigation of the needle with a toolholder, but without a fixed frame . Results: In the 16 patients with an osteo id osteoma theaccuracy to get to the center of the small lesions was measured . The accuracy to get to the chosen goal was on average 3 mm (0--6 mm) at a mean distance from the skin of 59 mm (11-132 mm). In the bone biopsy cases the planned mark was always hit. The number of control scans before entering the bone were reduced in all cases. The biopsy needle could be safely fixed in the bone before the first control scan was taken, avoiding the loss of needle position in the soft tissues during the control scan . Conclusion: The presented optical navigation system In CT-guided bone intervention has a high accuracy, allows punctures outside the scan plane and reduces the radiation exposure. Purpose: To evaluate safety and efficacy of Radiofrequency (RF) ablation in percutaneous CT-guided treatment of osteoid osteoma . Methods and Materials: Seven patients (6 male, 1 female; age range 13-40), with 8 osteoid osteomas identified with spiral CT, Gd-OTPA enhanced MR and bone scinli graphy were treated with RF ablation using a liquid cooled electrode needle with 2 cm tip exposure . Seven lesions were localized in the proximal tract of the femur and 1 case in the distal tract of the tibia. Results: All procedures were techn ically successful and no major complications occurred. Symptoms were completely relieved in all patients . To date, during a follow-up ranged between 4 and 18 months (mean 9 months) there were no recurrences. Conclusion: Percutaneous RF ablation an be proposed as a safe and effective alternative to surgery in the treatment of osteoid osteoma . Purpose: To evaluate computer tomography guided bone biopsy (CT-GBB), using a new non-disposable bone biopsy device, collecting a specimen in a 20 x2 mm chamber of a apple corer shaped needle. Methods and Materials: In 70 consecutive cancer patients that were candidates for bone biopsy, 74 CTGBB procedures, were performed in a uniform protocol for all lesions .

All the T1 images (with and without contrast) were subtracted in order to recogn ise areas of maximum enhancement. In these areas we have performed a second Us guided biopsy. All lesions underwent surgery. Results: in 13/16 patients the second biopsy was adequate (12 soft tissue sarcoma, 1 fibromyolipoma) . In 3/16 patients even the second biopsy was inadequate. Conclusion: the technique of image subtraction may be useful in choosing the best place for needle blopsy, continuous real-time imaging during the operation using a stereotactic guidance system and intermiUent, contrast-optimized imaging between various operative steps.",

Results: Inguinal Iymph nodes, iliac Iymph nodes and Iymph vessels were enhancing within 10 minutes after intracutaneous administration of both Iymphotropic contrast agents. Paraaortal Iymph nodes were visible in 5 of 6 cases with Gadofluorine 8 and in 3 of 6 cases with Gadofluoramide. The thoracic Iymphatic duct was enhancing in 4 of 6 cases with Gadofluorine 8, and could not be delineated with Gadofluoramide. The enhancement of the Iymphatic system decreased after 2 hours, the liver and the bowel tract enhanced within 24 hours. Conelusion: Intracutaneous administration of Iymphotropic T1-contrast agents is efficient in the visualization of the Iymphatic system on T1weighted gradient-echoimages. The contrast agents were eliminated hepatobiliary into the bowel tract. Purpose: Gadofluorine 8 is a new Iymphographic contrast medium for magnetic resonance imaging.

Lately, it is widely observed a tendency for over utilization of the radiological examinations of facial bones and sinuses due to medicolegal problems. A critical organ as an eye lens ls exposed to radiation during radiological examination of sinuses. Comparison of routine rentgenography and spiral CT with different pitches has been undertaken. Alderson Rando Phantom with L1F chips thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD-100) were used. Dosimeters were located at the place of both lenses. Spiral CT Siemens Somatom Plus 4 has been used with 1.0 and 1.5 pitches. Sinuses have been examined in axial and coronal planes for the fantom skull. Radiographic conditions were: 120 Kv, 110 mAs, cuts thickness 3 mm, interspace 3 mm and proper value of table movment due to chosen pitch. Scan time was 1.5 sec. Measurement of a radiation dose during conventional rentgenography of sinuses (Waters, Coldwells and lateral projection) was also performed for comparison. Conventional rentgenography yields 0.5 mGy dose to the lens. CT scan (sequential mode) pitch 1.0 shows on average 3.0 mGy in coronal and 13.5 mGy in axial plane. Spiral CT with pitch 1.5 in coronal plane reveals 2.5 mGy and 8.5 mGy in axial plane. Spiral CT with increased pitch showed a reduction in radiation dose to the lens. Technique with pitch 1.5 in coronal plane gave appr 37% less radiation dose to the lens in comparison with pitch 1.0. Dedectibility in both cases was acceptable. Radiation dose to the lens in axial projection was appr 4 times larger than in coronal plane. The lens dose from sequential CT in axial plane was appr 27 times larger in comparison with conventional rentgenography. Spiral CT in coronal projection with pitch 1.5 resulted with only 10 times more lens dose than the routine sinus rentgenography. Knowledge of the eye lens dose from different radiological examination gives the radiologist possibility to choose a proper technique with lower radiation to the lens and still maintained standard of good diagnostic of the sinuses.",

Garcia; Highland Heights, OHJUSA Purpose: Temporal resolution of spiral CT limits its usefulness in imaging moving organs, for example, the heart. Two new spiral reconstruction filters were designed to increase temporal resolution. Methods and Materials: Cardiac images were acquired from twelve patients scanned using a protocol that guaranteed contiguity of CT slices after EKG-gating the 60 rpm spiral data. The algorithms used for improving temporal resolution were: i) spiral interpolator with 420 ms-FWHM (R1), ii) slider-filter \u00ab230 ms-FWHM/lobe) applied to spiral data over three cardiac cycles (R2). Spiral (1 image/rev) images were also reconstructed using the standard 180 degree interpolator (STD). Image data sets reconstructed with R1 and R2 were both qualitatively compared with STD by viewing images side-by-side. The clarity of cardiac anatomy was judged by three radiologists and cardiologist. Results: Both R1 and R2 were evaluated to be beUer than the STD image sets, and R2 was assessed better than R1 for imaging coronary vessels as weil as systolic and diastolic volumes. Conclusion: These results show that the new algorithms reduce cardiac motion artifacts compared with standard spiral reconstruction, and when used in conjunction with cardiac gating could prove to be invaluable in assessing cardiac function. Purpose: The Ca-scores on SOMATOM PLUS4 with multirow detector are compared to the results on an Evolution E\u00dfT scanner for phantom and patient investigations 10 prove their equivalence.",

Purpose: To compare radiation exposure for routine investigation of the ehest, abdomen and heart applied by electron beam tomography (EBT), spiral-CT (SCT) and cardiac catheter (CC) angiography. Methods and Materials: Effective dose according to the ICRP 60 was estimated tor investigations performed with EBT (Imatron C-150XP), SCT (Siemens Somatom Plus 4A) and CC (Siemens Bicor TOP) using thermoluminescent dosimetry (\u00dficron-Harshaw TLD-100) and an Alderson phantom (Alderson Research Laboratories). Results: Effective dose was 5.3 mGy and 11 mGy for the chest and 8.8 mGy and 25 mGy for the abdomen with SCT and E\u00dfT, respectively. For investigation of the coronary arteries, effective dose was 2.3 mGy and 3.3 mGy with EBT and CC, respectively. Effective dose for cine investigation of the heart with EBT was 7.6 mGy. Conclusion: Effective dose for scanning of the chest and abdomen is significantly higher with E\u00dfT than with SCT. For investigation of the coronary arteries, effective dose with E\u00dfT is lower than with CC. In contrast to that effective dose for cine investigation of the heart with EBT is significantly higher than with CC. Purpose: Aim of this study was to investigate the ability of fMRI to localise the secondary somatosensory (SII) areas in healthy humans following upper and lower limb sensory stimulation. Methods and Materials: Nine volunteers (mean age 31 years) were involved in the study. They were briefly trained to lie down in a relaxed state, to avoid eye movements, and to maintain their Iimbs both in \"rast\" and \"stimulus\" conditions. Stimulus consisted of electric bulges, 0.200 ms in duration, for mixed cutaneous and proprioceptive median and tibial nerve stimulation. Stimulus was delivered at 1.9 sec repetition rate. fMRI exam was performed by using a 1.5 Tesla equipment (Vision, Siemens). Twenty-two 3 mm thick slices were acquired by FID echoplanar imaging technique from bicommissural line to the vertex, in 2 s. Results: In all subjects activated areas in the parietal lobes contralateral to the stimulated Iimb were found. They were consistent with the known homuncular organisation. A statistically significant increase of signal was localised in the slices passing through the supratemporal plane, bilaterally. Concluslon: fMRI can detect the activation of the primary somatosensory cortex. We hypothize that increased signal intensity detected in the supratemporal plane reflects the activation of SII areas. Purpose: It was the aim of our study to examine the retest reliability of the localization of language function with functional MRI (fMRI) and to assess its validity compared to functional transcranial Doppler sonography (fTCD), a method which has been validated in direct comparison to the Wada test. Methods and Materials: Nine healthy subjects were examined using a blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD)-sensitive EPI technique (TE: 64 ms, TR: 3 s, Matrix: 64 x 128, FOV: 210 x 210 mm). The fMRI paradigm consisted of different language related tasks (silent word generation, forming of opposite terms to given nouns) and different control conditions. Eight subjects were examined twice, one subject was examined ten times. Five subjects were left-, four subjects were right-hemispheric dominant for language as determined by functional TCD with a word generation task. Laterality indices were calculated by comparing the number of activated voxels in both hemispheres. Results: In all nine subjects, laterality indices were highly reliable in repeated examinations. Furthermore, fMRI results concerning hemispheric language dominance were in all cases consistent with the results of functional TCD. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the high retest reliability of language localization with fMRI. This is an important prerequisite for lon-gitUdinal studies to examine, e.g., plasticity of cortical function following brain damage. Furthermore, our results show the validity of fMRI in comparison to a method which has been directly validated compared to the Wada test. Results: SPM analyses of normal subjects revealed activation of the contra lateral hand area but no signiflcant deactivation. In contrast, torticotlis patients showed a significant deactivation of the visual and acoustic association cortices and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Overactivation was found in the contra lateral hand area. Conclusion: These findings in torticollis patients might suggest a disturbed balance of excitatory or inhibitory modulation of distinct cortical areas involved in the analysis of external stimuli and execution of movements.",

For the diagnosis of acute and chronic injuries of the soft tissues MR imaging and ultrasonography offer both structural and dynamic information. Techniques, general principles and limitations, and special applications will be discussed. Ultrasonography represents a simple modality to study all pathologie conditions of museies, tendons and ligaments related to sports activities and is helpful in the follow-up period of injured museies and tendons. Dynamic real-time studies are easy to perform and inexpensive. In the shoulder, US is considered a self supporting method concerning tendon pathology. Differential diagnosis of synoviaI cysts, partial and complete tears of the rotator cuff, biceps tendon subluxation and acromioclavicular luxation, and diagnosis of impingement syndrome in functional positions will be presented. MR imaging is useful to demontrate injuries of the soft tissues, but it mayaiso reveal lesions of cartilage and bone marrow. MR arthrography enables diagnosis of cartilaginous and other intraarticular abnormalities, invisible to the unenhanced studies. MR imaging may be used to study functional aspects of joint kinematics. The different dynamic techniques will be presented with their application in the knee, shoulder, ankle, and wrist. In the knee, dynamic MR imaging may be applied for the diagnosis of pattellar tracking and detection of Iigamentous injuries; in the shoulder, this technique has been used to study instability and impingement. Further applications will be presented for the wrist and the ankle, where the technique may be used to detect instabilities, impingement syndromes, and tendon dislocations. Indications to US examination are: muscles ruptures and follow-up of repair process; tendons traumatic injuries in shoulder, elbow, wrist, knee and ankle. With dynamic US is possible to evaluate the presencelabsence of partial or total fibers tears, the site of the lesion, the entity of the damage.

Methods and Materials: Identically collimated HCr and CTAP of the upper abdomen was performed before and after administration of contrast material in 26 patients with suspected primary or secondary hepatic neoplasms. Two blinded radiologists retrospectively evaluated multiphasic HCT scans and the biphasic CTAP scans respectively. Histopathology or intraoperative ultrasound was obtained in 14 patients, and results were compared with imaging findings. Remaining lesions were followed-up with CT examinations of the abdomen to document any change in lesion size (and the two modalities were compared regarding any change in therapy). Results: In 13 patients with a proved histopathological correlation of 25 lesions, the observers detected 23 lesions at multiphasic HCT (sensitivity 92%) and 24 lesions at biphasic CTAP (sensitivity 96%). In 20 patients 11 had intraoperative ultrasound and the remainder had follow-up examinations at least six months after CTAP or HCT respectively. Biphasic CTAP showed five false positive lesions (specifity 75%) and multiphasic HCT showed no false positive lesions (specifity 100%). Conclusion: Helical CTAP does not enable detection of significantly more focal liver neoplasms than does multiphasic HCr. High flow multiphasic HCT has significantly higher specifity than helical CTAP. mi/sec.

Following semi-automatic segmentation of the aorta and its large side branches, the median centreline (skeleton) of the vessels was determined employing three dimensional morphological thinning operations. Identifying the starting and ending points of the graft our algorithm could be validated by comparing the calculated length with the specifications of the grafts. Results: Employing our skeleton algorithm a precise measurement of aortic segmental length was possible. The differences in the measured length and graft length were <6% (range 4-12 mm). The average time necessary for segmentation was 7 minutes (range 3-10 minutes). Conclusion: Our skeleton algorithm allows for a precise measurement of aortic length and is therefore a valuable tool prior to endovascular treatment. Axial slices were used for assessment of degree of stenosis and plaque morphology. Results: 187 significant stenoses (129 ICA, 16 CCA, 42 ECA), and 29 occlusions (24 ICA, 2 CCA, 3 ECA) were detected. Except for 1 membranous stenosis all significant stenoses and all occlusions were demonstrated by CTA (sensitivity 99.5%).

Follow-up by 3D CTA is a fast, non-invasive, reliable modality and superior to DSA providing all the necessary information for assessment of patency, vessel wall, and stent-graft.",

Methods and Materials: 38 patients with documented peripheral vacular disease were positioned with their limbs within the field of view of a gamma camera. The arterial circulation was occlude by pressure cuffs placed above the knees and technetium HSA injected intravenously. The cuffs were released after three minutes and the time activity curve of both limbs measured, the cuffs were then reinflated for a further three minute period and then released with a further time activity curve measured. The limb inflow and outflow was then determined. In 20 patients measurements were taken before and after angioplasty and a further 18 patients were measured after medical therapy. Results: Limb blood flow showed a good correlation with patient symptoms and angiographic findings but relatively poor correlation with changes in ankle brachial index. Curve patterns were predictive of angiofraphic findings in determining the site of maximum obstruction to blood f1ow. Conclusion: Limb blood flow is a useful method of detrmining the outcome of angioplasty as weil as helping to detrmine the strategy for maximum benefit of angioplasty. Purpose: To test the diagnostic value of dobutamine stress MRI for predicting recovery of regional myocardial wall motion after revascularization. In patients with myocardial wall motion abnormalities, inotropic stimulation leads to an increase in systolic wall thickening only in viable, but not in non-viable, scarred myocardium. Methods and Materials: 20 patients with wall motion abnormalities were examined with a Cine FLASH-2d sequence at rest and during dobutamine stress (10 [tg/kg/min). Patients were re-examined at rest 3 months after revascularisation, and, in the case of persisting wall motion defects, another 3 months later by rest MRI and coronary angiography. Criterion of viability was an increase in end-systolic wall thickening during stress and/or at follow-up. Akinetic regions were c1assified as viable if > =50% of the affected segments improved.",

Comparison was made between bronchoscopy, axial CT-images, and minimal intensity projections (MinIP). Methods and Materials: 25 patients were referred for a helical CT because a bronchogenic carcinoma had been detected by bronchoscopy. The CT parameters included 3 mm sections and a pitch of 1.5 with an incremental of 1 mm. The data were transferred to a workstation for further processing. VE was tested for providing additional information in terms of location and degree of stenoses. Quality assurance was achieved by comparison to the corresponding bronchoscopy. Results: 24 stenoses were found in the bronchoscopy, 23 were found in the VE. There were no statistically significant differences between localization and degree of stenoses in the VE compared with the bronchoscopy. The readers underestimated the degree of stenoses in the axial CT-slices in 5-9 (reader 1-3) patients. An underestimation was noted in the MinlP in 8-11 patients (reader 1-3). The negative control group was identified in the axial CT-slices, the MinlP, and the VE. Patients were assessed using spiral CT (3 mm, 1 to 2:1 pitch). Two reviewers (one radiologist, one pneumonologist) analysed successively and independently axial CT images and one month later axial CT and VB images (Navigator, GEMS). In case of abnormal findings, they proposed the most Iikely diagnostic and rated their level of confidence. Results: They analysed 238 bronchial segments with 31 abnormalities demonstrated by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Abnormal bronchial segments were identified with a mean sensitivity of 89% (axial images) and 92% (axial and VB images) (p > 0.5). A correct diagnostic of nature of bronchial abnormalities was proposed in 68% of cases using axial CT images and in 76% using axial CT and VB images (P =0.5). The pneumonolog ist feit more confident with VB images although it did not increase his yield. Conclusion: VB does not improve the performance of our reviewers for the detection and identification of benign bronchial abnormalities but VB increases the confidence in CT images of ehest physicians. Results: The use of routine thin slice ehest scan data of the EBT results in excellent image quality of the virtual endoscopy images. In all patients the bronchial tree was visible to at least 4th order bronchi. Moderate artifacts were seen due to cardiac motion in the central parts of the bronchial tree. Overall excellent correlation was seen between virtual and real bronchoscopy according to anatomy and pathology. Conclusion: The thin slice protocol used with the EBT scanner for routine ehest scans allows high-quality virtual bronchoscopy without additional scans and excellent visualisation of alterations of the tracheobronchial tree. The additional information was highly appreciated by the clinicians to plan endoscopic interventions and to shorten examination times of the bronchoscopy. Purpose: To study the effect of scan parameters (acquisition, reconstruction, and threshold setting) on VB simulations of the tracheobronchial lree .

VB were produced using Navigator (GEMS). Three sites of interest (carlna, left main bronchus, right upper lobe bronchus) were displayed at 7 different threshold settings (from -250 to -850 by steps of 100 HU).

Virtual endoscopy was calculated based on these volume-data-sets using a commercial (Ornnipro, Eiscint) and a marching-cubes based software (Iris Explorer). A cadaver phantom of the human bronchial tree was scanned for the comparison of in vive and in vltro artefacts. The bronchial tree was traced on the axial images. The profile of the bronchial tree margins has been analysed within the axial and coronal reformatted images and the resulting virtual endoscopy to detect irregular partial-volume artefacts caused by motion during the helical scan. Examinations with artefacts caused by breathing or moving were excluded. Results: Artefacts caused by the heart-motion were detectable in all examinations.

Results: Cervical cyst were seen as a mass with the density of the fluid, clear even contours. Lipomas were noted as Iimited formations in different layers of the neck and identical to the tat tissue due to the density. Chemodectomas are distinguished by early (at the arler ial phase), uniform and strongly pronounced (100--120 HU) accumulation of the contrast medium (CM). Accumulation of the CM in neurinomas, located at the carotid arteries bifureation, is much slower, less pronounced (60--70 HU) and not even: spots and stripes of the contrasted vessels stand out against the slightly accumulating parenchyma. Atypieal paragangliomas were located lower than carotid arteries bifurcation, squeezing the vascular fascicle, accumulated the medium weil but still less than in carotid chemodectomas, uneven with the large area of necrosis in the centre. Cervical neurinomas were typically located at the site of intervertebral foramen or brachial plexus. Accumulation of the CM was not significant. Conclusion: Spiral CT in contrast to dynamic CT allows to reveal the attachment of carotid arleries into the pathological process and to specify the relations belween the tumor and neck vessels with the use of 3D. -NaCI flush volume enlargement caused bolus lengthening (appr. 55%). -Gd volume enlargement caused bolus lengthening (e.g. 150% from single to double dose level). -Increase of flow rate caused a decrease of BL and BAT (e.g. 41 %/43% from 0.5 to 1 ml/s) and an increase of S/N (122% from 0.5 to 1 ml/s). Conclusion: The bolus is physiologically diluted by the CM passage through heart and lung, blood distribution into proximally localized vessel branches and by the diffusion into interstitial tissue.

Conclusion: Adequate diagnostic contrast enhancement of the abdominal vessels over aperiod of >30 min was obtained only with small superparamagnetic iron partides in a low-field MR system. This enables improved MRA-image quality in low-field systems as weil as carrying out simple vascular MR-assisted interventions. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Dotarem \u00ae at 0.1 mmol/kg for the diagnosis of carotid artery stenosis by contrast-enhanced MRA in comparison to unenhanced MRA (TOF) , using X-ray angiography as gold standard. Methods and Materials: 43 patients suspected of carotid artery stenos is and scheduled to undergo a X-ray DSA were evaluated in a two-center c1inical trial. All patients underwent a classical unenhanced Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of a new contrast agent with ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide part icles ; (PEG-Ferron \u00ae, Nycomed AS) for 3D TOF MRA of per ipheral vessels and to demonstrate the potential of blood pool MR contrast med ia for 3D-TOF MRA of coronary arteries. Methods and Materials: Protocol 1: Coronal 3D TOF MRA images of the pelvis and lower limb circulalion of twelve dogs were acqu ired before and after administration of PEG-Ferron or Gd-DTPA-BMA. Dose ranging was performed with 3, 4 and 5 mg/kg PEG-Ferron with a 20\u00b0a nd 60\u00b0flip angle. Protocol 2: Gd-DTPA-Albumin enhanced axial and coronal 3D TOF MRA images of the coronary arteries were acquired . Results: The optimal dose and flip angle were 3 mg PEG-Ferron/kg and 60\u00b0respectively. Peg-Ferron provided clear demarcation of the major primary, secondary and tertiary vessels over aperiod of 45 min. Gd-DTPA-BMA provided less and shorter signal (-15 min.) enhancement than PEG-Ferron . Admin istration of Gd-DTPA-Albumin greatly enhanced major coronary arteries. Conclusion: The efficacy of Peg-Ferron for 3D TOF MRA of per ipheral vessels was demonstrated. The initial results show the feasibility of using blood pool contrast media to improve 3D TOF MRA of the coronary arteries. Purpose: To study temporal changes in signal intensity of the Iiver, focal liver lesions, spleen, and abdom inal vessels following Iv. injection of a bolus-injectable SPIO using a breathheld 3D-MRA sequence and to determine its impact on MRA of the upper abdomen. Methods and Materials: SH U 555 A (Schering AG, Berlln, Germany) was bolus-injected in 20 patients with focalliver lesions (12 metastases, 4 HCC , 3 hemangiomas, and 1 adenoma) through a cubital i.v.-llne at a dose of 10 urnol Fe/kg bodyweight at an injeclion rate of 3 ml/s.",

Objective: To compare the diagnostic value of two different doses of Gd-DOTA at substraction MRA of lower extremities in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial occlusive disease, with x-ray angiography as the reference. Methods and Materials: Fourty patients were prospectively included in 2 different centers. Subtraction MRA consisted of coronal GRE acquisitions, before and after random administration of either 0.05 mmol/kg or 0.1 mmol/kg of Gd-DOTA injected twice: one for thighs, one for legs examination. In a prospective on-site then centralized blinded MRA data analysis, the number and location of stenoses >50% and occlusions were evaluated. Sensitivity, specificity and kappa test were used to evaluate MRA data obtained with each dose. Results: The location and extent of stenoses and/or occlusions on MRA and angiograms were weil correlated (Kappa, p < 0.5). There was no significant difference between the two doses despite a slightly higher specificity with the dose of 0.1 mmol/kg (89% vs 84%). The highest dose allowed better signal to noise ratio, and better collaterality visualization (68.8% scored good or excellent for 0.1 dose vs 40% for 0.05 dose). Conclusion: Gd-DOTA MRA at the dose of 0.1 mmol/kg is the best suited to assess the presence and severity of atherosclerotic lower limbs lesions. Purpose: To assess with MRI the frequency of wallerian degeneration of the pyramidal tract (WDPT) in hemiplegie patients recovering from stroke, and the relationship between WDPT and recovery. Methods and Materials: 20 hemiplegie patients with ischemic stroke in the territory of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) were examined with MRI at 1.5 T three times in 9 months during rehabilitation. All patients had SE T1, FSE T2, and FLAIR images. MR images were assessed for the ischemic lesions, and the presence of WDPT. WDPT was defined as well-defined band of hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images in the topographie distribution of the corticospinal tract, and as ipsilateral brain stem shrinkage at later stage. MRI results were compared with measurement of motor abilities of the patients. Good recovery was defined as the ability to perform fingers movements. Results: Ischemic lesions were in the deep MCA (14 cases), superficial MCA (5 cases), or both (1 case) territories. All patients had WDPT. Accordingly to literature, bright T2 signal intensity appeared 2 to 3 months after stroke. 6 patients had brain stem shrinkage. FLAIR images showed WDPT with a greater conspicuity than T1 and T2-weighted images. Conclusion: WDPT was a constant MR finding and should not be used as a predictive factor of the quality of motor recovery. Purpose: To demonstrate signal intensity changes of Wallerian degeneration (WD) in white matter tracts in various intracranial lesions and to assess its prognostic implications. Methods and Materials: 18 patients of acute stroke were studied prospectively. MRI and Functional disability of these patients was evaluated at presentation, 1 and 4 months duration using modified Barthel Index of activity of daily living (ADL). The neurological status at 4 months was graded as good recovery, ADL > 16; partial recovery, ADL 10 -15 and poor recovery, ADL < 9. Statistical analysis of data was done using student's t-test.szo MR scans of patients of various intracranial lesions were analysed retrospectively. Results: Prospective Study: -A total of 10/18 patients of stroke showed dynamic signal intensity changes in cortico-spinal tract, suggestive of WD at 1 and 4 months follow up. Their mean ADL score changed from 9.1 at 1 month to 11.4 at 4 months duration suggestive of moderate to severe disability after 4 months of stroke. The hematomas were created by injecting 0.1-1 ml of autologous blood into the brain of 13 rabbits. One additional rabbit only underwent brain puncture. MRI was performed before and, at determined intervals, after hematoma creation. The follow-up time was 3 h in one rabbit, 6 hours in eight rabbits and 9-12 days in five rabbits. Immediately after the last MRI, the brain was fixed with formalin. The images of the last MRI were compared to the fixed brain sections. Results: T2*-weighted gradient echo sequences revealed the intraparenchymal hematomas as hypointensities in all rabbits immediately after hematoma creation. The signal pattern remained very much the same during the follow-up. The sizes and shapes of the hematomas corresponded weil to the post-mortem findings. Leakage of blood into the liquor spaces was also demonstrated. GRASE images were less sensitive. Spin echo sequences were rather insensitive. FLAIR often revealed blood in liquor spaces but not in brain parenchyma. Conclusion: T2*-weighted gradient echo sequences seem to be capable to reveal small intracranial hemorrhages from hyperacute to subacute phase. Results: Involvement of basal ganglia was a frequent finding and always associated with an unfavorable prognosis (n =11). In the acute stage, cerebral edema was prevalent (n =4 of 4). In the early subacute stage, enhanced T1-weighted images revealed cortical laminar enhancement indicating necrosis (n =2 of 2 contrast enhanced studies).",

Methods and Materials: We studied 14 female scleroderma patients (aged 24-74) with a disease duration of 1-12 years, without relevant systemic complication. All patients underwent brain MR examination at 1.5 T: SE PO-and T2-weighted sequence (TRITE 2500/20-80 ms); pixel 0.98 x 0.98 mm; 22 x 2 paraaxial 3-mm contiguous slices.

Mann-Whitney test and Spearman rank correlation coefficient were used. Results: Patients: 170 hyperintensities = >2 mm in diameter (range 0-75, mean 12.1, median 4.5); CG: 13 (0-2, 0.9, 1, respectively), with a significant difference (p =.0113). A trend towards the correlation between number of hyperintensities and disease duration (p = .188) and patient's age (p =.083) was observed. Moreover, 208 <2 mm hyperintensities were found in patients (0-38, 14.9, 8, respectively) while only 31 were found in the CG (0-7, 2.0, 1, respectively), with significant difference (p =.0063). Conclusion: White matter hyperintensities are more frequent in scleroderma patients than in CG. These findings could be related to obIiterative microvascular processes due to the disease. In addition, this study supports the hypotesis of an early brain involvement in scleroderma patients. In daily practice, inflammatory and neoplastic diseases of the pancreas are common findings. In many cases, the patients history, clinical examination, and laboratory tests are indicating the presence and sometimes even the type of pancreatic disease. Therefore, the task for radiological imaging is to identify and characterize the potential pathological process.

Adams; ManchesterlUK Bones vary in shape (generally f1at and tubular) and are composed of two types of bone tissue: compact bone which forms the outer cortex of bones and trabecular or cancellous bone found mainly in vertebral bodies, the pelvis and ends of long bones. Trabecular bone is eight times more metabolically active than cortical bone. Oespite its hardness, bone remains a metabolically active tissue throughout Iife, being constantly resorbed and accreted by bone cells, the activity of which can be modified by many factors. Bone formation (osteoblastic activity) and bone resorption (osteoclastic activity) constitutes bone turnover, a process which takes place on bone surfaces and continues throughout life. Under normal circumstances osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity is \"coupled\" and constitutes the basal multicellular unit (BMU) of bone. If this process becomes \"uncoupled\" excessive osteoclastic resorption or defective osteoblastic function will result in a net loss of bone tissue (osteoporosis). Oefective osteoclastic function prevents normal resorption of bone which is essential to maintain bone health by a continual slow renewal throughout life. Oefective osteoclastic function in some diseases (e.g. osteopetrosis) can result in bone sclerosis and abnormal modelling on radiographs. Bone resorption by osteoclasts is a single stage process in which collagen and mineral are removed together. Bone formation is a two stage process; osteoblasts lay down osteoid, which subsequently becomes mineralised. Prerequisites for normal mineralisation are Vitamin 0 (1,25 [OH12 0 3 ) , normal levels of phosphorous and alkaline phosphatase and anormal pH. Oefects in the mineralisation process will result in rickets and osteomalacia, which may be evident on radiographs.",

Microfractures result from the accumulation of unrepaired microdamage to the mineralized elements of bone from small loads applied to the tissue. Impaired repair of microfractures may contribute by compounding the weakening effects of reduced bone mass and compromising architectural properties. It begins at the atomic or molecular level and has manifestations through all levels of bone structure until lt manifests in large macrocracks which can cause tissue failure (bone fracture). The mechanical integrity can be significantly compromised even before substantial cracking ls observed at the macroscopic level.

Clinical indications for MR imaging in patients with ischemic heart disease include the diagnosis of complications after myocardial infarction, some niches for coronary artery imaging, the measurement of valvular heart diasease and the evaluation of regional and global ventricular function. New MR contrast media are helpful to assess coronary artery anatomy and myocardial perfusion. The combined evaluation of myocardial function and perfusion may be accomplished in a cost-effective way. A number of ischemic syndromes can be characterized by studying myocardial perfusion and function, both at rest and under stress conditions. Lowdose dobutamine stress testing can be applied in the MR environment to assess myocardial viability after myocardial infarction. High-dose dobutamine stress, on the other hand, is useful to assess the presence of underlying significant coronary artery disease, analogous to routinely applied echocardiographic approaches. However, MR imaging has potential advantages over echocardiography, because MR imaging provides a complete three-dimensional data set of the entire heart and the MR data are quantifiable in accurate and reliable fashion. Valvular stenoses and insuffiency is easily and accurately measured by MR flow mapping, which is unsurpassed with other imaging strategies. The routinely applied breath-hold fast gradient-echo sequences provide accurate and reproducible measures of regional and global ventricular function. Automated contour detection is now available to extract functional parameters, like the ejection fraction, in a time-efficient manner. The volumetrics based on MR-measurements are so accurate and reproducible that MR imaging ls now considered to be the new gold standard for functional evaluation of the left ventricle. In this review the MR techniques and current clinical indications for evaluating ischemic heart disease will be summarized. 1374 B. Present state of EBT R Rienm\u00fcller; Graz/A Electron beam CT technology is able to perform CT-data acquisition with a very short exposure time of 100 or 50 ms. Using this technology it is not only possible to evaluate coronary calieification qualitatively and as a calcium score quantitatively but also stenotic lesions in proximal 4-6 cm of the coronary arteries with a degree of accuracy comparable to coronary angiography. Additionally it is possible to determine quantitatively all left ventricular functional parameters (except of pressures) inclusively myocardial perfusion in ml/100 g/min. In patients with suspected or known coronary heart disease, ECG, echocardiography, scintigraphic methods and coronary angiography are used to prove or to exclude the disease. If positive at least following questions are of interest: 1. What is the hemodynamic effect of a coronary lesion? 2. What is the functional state of the colateral vessels? 3. What is the size of infarcted/ischemic myocardium? 4. Which parameters may additionally influence myocardial perfusion? 5. What may be the optimal treatment for the patient? Based on the results of more than one thousand patients studied by EBT the above mentioned questions will be evaluated and discussed using the evidence based diagnostic approach (as described by were examined employing a low field (0.5 T) MRI unit and a high field (1.5 T) one, using SE. and GRE sequences with eine Ioop reconstruction. Only in the last five cases FGRE breth-hold sequences with eine loop were used. MRI evaluation criteria: qualitative (fat substitution, kinesis) and quantitative (endocavitary diameters and ejection fraction) analyses were performed on the MR images. Results: The intraobserver concordance analysis was complete (100%) in the evaluation of endoventricular dimension, optimal (94%) in the kinesis analysis, good but slightly inferior (81%) in the evaluation of adipouse substitution. Similarly the interobserver concordance analysis was 92% in the dimensional evaluation, 90% in the kinesis analysis and 75% in the evaluation of adipous substitution. Conclusion: MRI ls an excellent technique in the evaluation of endoventricular dimension and kinesis; slightly inferior in the evaluation of adipous substitution which needs an optimal thecnical exam esecution. Complementary c1inico-strumental studies are thereofore, needed for a correct diagnosis in case of initial fatty myocardial infiltration as suggested by the Task Force. Purpose: To determine the utility of MRI in establishing the diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (RVD). Methods and Materials: Eighty-eight patients underwent cardiac MRI to evaluate ventricular arrhythmia. Clinical criteria for RVD were family history and characteristic findings on EKG, electrophysiology, and echocardiography. MRI studies were reviewed without knowledge of clinical data. MRI criteria for RVD were transmural fat, intramyocardial fat, or thinning of the right ventricular free wall. The outcome of patients diagnosed with RVD was assessed. Results: The diagnosis of RVD was established in 12 of 88 patients using clinical and MRI criteria. MRI in 2 of the 12 (17%) was technically suboptimal and non-diagnostic. The remaining 10 patients (83%) had transmural fat or intramyocardial fat on MRI. In 8 of 12 patients (67%), MRI was necessary to establish the diagnosis of RVD. Echocardiography was useful in diagnosis in only 2 patients. During an average followup period of 19 months after MRI, 3 patients had automatic defibrillators, and one underwent radiofrequency ablation. All 12 patients remain alive. Conclusion: MRI can be useful in the diagnosis of RVD and may be required to establish the diagnosis in a majority of patients with this condition.",

There was a direct dependence between the duration of influence on the organizm and the increase of frequency of all abovementioned echopathologies. With the increase of the duration of the vibration, the exereise tolerance is significantly decreased: the increase of the positive stress tests, the decrease of the mean duration of stress tests. Neuro-imaging is able to show specifically which areas of the brain are involved in the performance of tasks. This was initially realized with radioactive tracers of cerebral blood flow then MRI has been recognized to have the capability to explore functional and activation changes in the brain. Initial experiments used contrast agent boluses. Then the signal modifications based on local variations of deoxyhemoglobin in red blood cells were evidenced during brain function and the term functional MRI (fMRI) was restricted to this situation. The direction of the researches became then twofold with fundamental works attempting to better characterize the origin of the signal and applied works coming from multidisciplinary groups adapting neuropsychological tests to MRI and comparing the results of several modalities of brain mapping. In this view two approaches again can be differenciated between purely cognitive research usually performed with various paradigm designs, at high magnetic fields for higher sensitivity and a more clinically oriented utilisation of fMRI directly deriving from the results of the previous one. The clinical use of fMRI benefitting from the large number of MRI centers opened throughout the world became very soon largely spread because some of the fMRI applications, mostly those identifying primary cortex areas were immediately possible to adapt on clinical imagers 1.5 tesla with conventional hardware. Therefore c1inical fMRI is now in the situation of a large multicenter evaluation both with gradient echo imaging on conventional systems or with clinical systems implemented with c1inically usable echo-planar imaging capabilities.",

The basic design of most studies centers on comparison of baseline to an active condition. However, because of the dynamic capability of fMRI the task is often repeated several times, separated by periods of rest or control. This type of 'block-paradigm' design is more robust against motion artifacts. Furthermore, there is a gain in contrastnoise ratio, as many images can be averaged out. It remains that controlling the subject performance in the magnet is not easy. Most language studies are performed covertly to avoid motion artifacts. For perception related paradigms, subjects may continuously match their perception of a stimulus with a linear potentiometer connected to a computer. Reaction times mayaiso easily be monitored. More recently, the observation that fMRI could detect signal responses following single, brief stimuli has led the way to 'Event-Related' paradigms. With this approach, individual trials are performed and analyzed separately, allowing distinct event types to be randomly intermixed. Habituation and anticipation effects are greatly reduced and trials can be sorted according to task performance. Room F2",

Continuously, new or improved applications are being developed in parallel with the technical improvements in fMRI acquisition and post processing techniques resulting in more powerful and sensitive methods to detect brain activation. As a consequence fMRI has now moved from the research lab to the clinic. A major cllnical application of fMRI is the presurgical evaluation of patients with brain lesions. The mapping of sensory-motor, auditory, visual and language regions shows that fMRI provides a risk estimate of a therapeutic intervention. Such mapping extends the surgical approach to lesions that have previously been considered inoperable, and contributes to a decrease in postsurgical morbidity. The good spatia! correlation of presurgical mapping with fMRI and invasive cortical mapping has been documented extensively, suggesting that fMRI might now replace the invasive mapping techniques. More recently, fMRI language dominance studies have shown to be a noninvasive alternative to Wada testing. Still preliminary, but very promising, are the localization of ictal activity in epilepsy and the evaluation of stroke deficits or recovery from stroke by fMRI. Cognitive tasks are being tested in normal volunteers and patients to unravel the underlying etiology of psychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia, dyslexia, and emotional disorders. Studies ofthe influence of medication and related long-term effects belong to potential future applications. Clearly, we are only at the beginning of an immense field of clinical applications. However, the introduction of fMRI in the clinical environment requires an adapted approach. Methods are needed to monitor patient performance during the acquisition and paradigms need to be straightforward, as lengthy or difficult fMRI sessions may be difficult to sustain for infants or very ill patients.",

Given it noninvasivity and lack of ionizing radiation, in fact, it can be considered the best suited imaging procedure for detecting a variety of causes of infertility at four different anatomical sites. A. At the level of the uterus, US can demonstrate a large variety of dlseases, of the myometrial wall and/or the endometrium. lts diagnostic capabilities are greatly enhanced with the injection of saline within the endometrial cavity: this provides perfect delineation ot the cavlty itself and makes the differential diagnosis among the many possible congenital and acquired diseases altering lts contours easier. B. As regards tubal causes of infertility, US can detect lesions of the uterine cornua affecting patency and demostrate fluid collections within the tubes. Furthermore, at this level, injection of US contrast medium seems the best means to evaluate tubal patency. Impossibility to evaluate tubal morphology, however, is an important drawback of this technique. C. Peritoneal causes of infertility are difficult to evaluate with USo Adehesions are impossible to identify by this method, and only fluid collections from endometriosis can be recognized. D. On the contrary, US plays a quite important role in evaluating the ovary. It provides, in fact, an easy means to monitor follicular growth and confirm the occurrence of ovulation, and can help in the differential diagnosis among causes of anovulation. In addition, in patients undergoing ovarian stimulation, it has the capability to detect complications, such as the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, to identify the best suited follicles for oocyte retrieval for in vitro fertilization, and to guide needle insertion during the procedure. Furthermore, during ovulatory induction cycles, it can provide complete evaluation of the patient through monitoring of endometrial development, prediction of endometrial receptivity, and evaluation of the outcomes of assisted reproduction manoeuvers. 2.

Guidelines are mandatory to avoid useless use of contrast agents because of the present situation of cost-containment health care. It is clear that the decision to obtain contrast enhanced images will depend on the clinical and/or the unenhanced MR findings. Based on our current guidelines for obtaining a contrast enhanced CT on one hand and on our long-standing experiences with MR imaging, we will attempt to define guidelines for contrast enhanced neuro MR imaging. Finally, the use of contrast agents in c1inical research conditions such as perfusion MR imaging and bone marrow imaging will be discussed. The use of CA has the potential to increase the sensitivity and specificity of abdominal MR by improving morphologie information and adding functional information. CAs can act as positive or negative enhancers, depending on their nature, concentration, and the imaging pulse sequence. The diagnostic effectiveness of the resulting MR examination is dependent on the type of the CA used, the way and dose in which the CA is administered, and the timing of the scans.

Therefore intervenlional techniques have been introduced as both curative and palliative forms of treatment. Since most obstructions are caused by externa l compression or fibrotic changes wh ich do not respond weil to PTA alone, today angiogplasty practically always is backed-up by an endovascular stent. Patients with inflow obstructions of the superior or inferior V. cava are excellent indications for stenting since the majortiy of the patients will respond by rapid regression of the symptoms of inflow obstruction within hours. Clinical relief of symptoms can be expected in 70 to 100% of the subjects with malignant disease and in elose to 100% in benign obstructians. Lang-term secondary patenty in SVC and IVC stenting from malignant disease ranges from 86 to 100%, though the survival rarely lasts more than 2 years. Although there ls only limited data on lang-term patency for benign lesions this probably will prove to be above 90% . Provided a stenosis or ocelusion of the V. cava or a large vein can be passed using a guidewire . and pilote dilatation of the lesion with a balloon catheter allows enough expansion of the lesion to permit stent implantation, practically any malignant or benign venous obstruction may be stented .

During course of embolization 1 aneurysm was perforated with subsequent clot enlargement and worsening of the c1inical condition. The outcome was good in 2, moderate disability in 2 severe disability in land death in 2 patients. Conclusion: Presurgical embolization of ruptured MCA aneurysms with large intracranial hematomas seems to be effective in protecting aneurysms and avoiding intraoperative rebleeding. Nevertheless, the decision to perform embolization or even diagnostic angiography is conditioned by the neurologie condition of the patient and neurovascular team, must always weight the need for early hematoma evacuation to control elevated ICP and mas compression effect against the desirability of defining the anatomy of the aneurysm angiographically and the posibility to perform a endovascular treatment. we evaluated the thinner Spinnaker\u00ae 1.5 F (165/20, n = 10). Ten Spinnaker\u00ae 1.5 F were injected using a mixture of EIL 1:2 and 1:3. Results: Using a mixture of EIL 1:1,9 out of 20 Spinnaker\u00ae 1.8 F (45%) ruptured distally at the tip of the microcatheter, each after injection no. 4-9. One Spinnaker\u00ae 1.8 F was distally occluded after the 5th injection.

Purpose: Prediction of the delay from application of contrast agent to enhancing the cerebral arteries is a insecurity in CT-angiography. 'Sure start' has been tested to optimize contrast enhancement of cerebral S316 arteries to make this method as effective as possible for the diagnosis of cerebrovascular imaging. Methods and Materials: 94 patients (46 women) with subarachnoid haemorrhage underwent CT-angiography. A region of interest (ROI), including both carotids for detecting increasing contrast enhancement, has been defined at the level of jaw angle. The CTA of the intracranial vessels starts with a fix delay 4.5 s after reaching a threshold for contrast enhancement in the predefined ROI. The amount of injected contrast medium has been measured and compared to the volume in \"conventional CTA\". After this, an analysis of MIP-and 3D-images has been performed regarding the branches of the Circle of Willis compared with DSA in the same patients. Results: Contrast enhancement enables to identify all vessels of the Circle of Willis and its branches as weil as 87 aneurysms. Arepetition due to low contrast enhancement was not necessary. Conclusion: \"Sure start\"-technique is a tool for determining the delay, regardless of individual factors influencing the contrast transfer. The used contrast volume is less than CTA without this method. Radiology, endoscopy and pathology form the triad for the morphologic diagnosis of colonic disease. These methods are complementary ; none of them should stand alone. Because adenomas almost always represent the primary stage in the development of colorectal eareinoma, diagnosis of polyps and appropriate therapy are of crueial importance in the prevention of colonie cancer. Colorectal carcinoma is a eommon tumor, which has a prognosis that had ehanged a little during the last years. Only early detection ean give hope to improving the prognosis. This course will cover polyps, including polyposis syndromes, colorectal carcinoma, secondary careinoma and the non-epithelial tumors. The c1assification of tumors and tumor-like changes of the colon according to the WHO, which is not universally accepted and has been modified often, whieh will be further discussed. The diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease is based on the contrast enema and supported by the patient's history, the abdominal examinations and endoscopy. Ulcerative colitls and Crohn's eolitis comprise 90% of all cases of chronic inflammatory bowel disease and are the most important eonsiderations in the differential diagnosis. Eaeh eondition is assoeiated with a rather specifie, but overlapping constellation of c1inical, pathologic, endoscopic and radiographic findings. The purpose of this review is to highlight the most efficient imaging exploratory techniques depicting shoulder instability, to describe its various~rms and to point out the findings which can simulate instability.",

In fixed posterior dislocations, CT-scan represents the most pertinent technique to evaluate the size of the humeral head defect and to determine the therapeutic followup. In sublle forms of instability, diagnosis or instability direction are not clearly assessed c1inically and standard X-rays evaluation is usually unremarkable. In this case, further exploration sueh as CT-arthrography, MR Imaging or MR-arthrography are recommanded to confirm the diagnosis of instability and to evaluate its direction. The technique of choiee is undoubtedly MR-arthrography. Atraumatic voluntary painless subluxati?ns associated with hyperlaxity of the shoulder do not require any speci\u00fcc exploratory method as the findings are generally limited to a capacious axillary pouch. By definition, wrist instabilities are conditions in which the individual carpal bones fail to maintain their normal anatomic position. If undiagnosed, wrist instability can lead to pain, dysfunction of the wrist, and osteoarthr itis. The purpose of this course is to demonstrate. how standard radiograms (whieh still are the key for initial work up) must be performed and how these radiograms should be analyzed systematically for getting correet diagnosis of different types of statie or dynamic wrist instabilities.

In some instances such techniques are used as an adjunct to surgery but increasingly frequently a permanent cure can be achieved by arterial embolization without recourse to further operative intervention. The ocelusion of \"non-vital\" traumatised vessels is often relatively straight-forward although a selective embolization is important in order, firstly, to reduce the risk of rebleeding and secondly, to prevent adjacent tissue ischaemia and necrosis. Such procedures have been considerably aided by the routine use of co-axial catheters. Successful treatment using interventional radiological techniques of injuries to major vessels which cannot be permanently occluded (\"vital\" vessels) has proved to be much more difficult and in the past such cases were often managed by surgery with or without the use of a temporary intravascular occlusion balloon catheter, More recently, however, some of these injuries have been successfully managed by the use of intravascular stents. The different embolization techniques used for the treatment of \"non-vital\" and \"vital\" vessels will be separately discussed.

Methods and Materials: 20 patients with early psoriatic arthritis were examined with an 8 MHz and 13 MHz linear tranducer (Sequoia, Acuson). The degree of synovial proliferation in the joints of the hands and feet were evaluated. Also the presence of joint effusion and signs of tenosynovitis was estimated. The vascularity in the synovial tissue was quantified with Power Doppler and graded from 0 to 3+. The ultrasound findnings were correlated to the c1inical evaluation of the extent of joint affection and severity of the disease. This evaluation was done by a rheumatologist prior and independently from the ultrasound evaluation with recording of tender, swollen joints and tenosynovitis. Results: Power Doppler ultrasound graded the patients as having no signs of arthritis in 5 cases, mild arthritis in 7 and severe arthritis in 8. The coresponding c1inical findnings were 6.8 and 6. The ultrasound detected more arthritic manifestations in 13 patients. Conclusion: Power Doppler ultrasound is more sensitive than clinical estimation in the evaluation of the extent of early psoriatic arthritis. An optimal contrast was realized between cartilage and vascularized synovia, improving the detection of chondral defects. Conclusion: 3D SPGR fat suppressed acquisitions before administration of gadolinium provides a good discrimination between synovial fluid and hipertrophy, that is not always possibile with FSE tecnique. 3D SPGR Fat suppressed images after gadolinium are useful in assessing synoviaI vascularity, and in studying synovial-cartilage borderline.",

Methods: MR imaging just before, and 1 week and 3 years following arthroscopic synovectomy of the knee. Contrast-enhanced dynamic MRI: sagittal, single slice, T1-weighted gradient-echo pulse sequence, one image every 10 seconds for a total of 250 seconds. Signal intensity versus time curves were generated from two regions of interest (ROls) at predetermined sites of the synovium. At synovectomy, biopsies were obtained at the same sites. All patients were examined clinically and radiographically before synovectomy and at follow-up. The results of contrast-enhanced dynamic MRI of three normal volunteers were used for control. Results and Conclusion: All patients with rheumatic disease had a high rate of enhancement before synovectomy. Histology revealed in-f1ammatory rheumatic synovitis. The enhancement rate was decreased both at 1 week after synovectomy and at 3 years follow-up. The patient with PVN showed a slower enhancement rate before synovectomy than that of the patients with rheumatic disease; the enhancement was increased 1 week after synovectomy but had decreased to a level just above that of the normal controls at 3 years follow-up. The results suggest that dynamic MRI may indicate the degree of synoviaI inflammation and the effect of synovectomy. Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic possibilities of MRI in the study of pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) of the the knee. Methods and Materials: Twenytwo patients clinically presenting knee pain and/or functional disability were submitted to MR evaluation. A standard examination of the knee was performed employing a \"dedicated\" 0.2T MR system (SE T1-w, SE T2-w and GE T2-w sequences on sagittal, axial and coronal scan planes; SE T1-w sequences after Gd-DTPA administration in 7 cases). MR-arthrography was performed in 3 cases. Arthroscopic and hystological controls were performed in all cases after MR examination. Results: A nodular formation in the posterior recesses of the knee (12 cases) and in the Hoffa's body (10 cases) was found on MRI. It showed a nonhomogeneous low signal intensity (SI) on SE T2-w sequences and an intermediate SI on T1-w ones, without a significative contrastenhancement. Arthroscopy demonstrated MR findings in 21 patients. The nodule W;:lS extrasynovial in 1 case: in this case surgery confirmed the presence of the intra-articular but extrasynovial lesion. Diagnosis of PVNS was histologically confirmed in all patients. Conclusion: MRI allows a good and detailed evaluation of the posterior recesses of the knee and demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy in the evaluation of PVNS giving significative information about the lesion characterization. Results: Differences of the thickness of the cartilage, the proliferation and vascularisation of the synovia in normal joints and in joints with arthritis were noticed. In joints with chronic swelling there was proliferation of the synovia with little or no vascularisation. In the acute state of RA there was proliferation of the synovia with high vascularisation. Conclusion: With the Multi-D-Array it is possible to get information about the activity of the RA in the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints which allows aprevention from destruction of these joints by early therapeutical intervention.",

Conclusion: We found a significant thickening of flexor tendon pulley system and a increased distance between phalanx and tendon in c1imbers compared to healthy volunteers. Therefore the dynamic US technique is a valuable adjunct to the c1inical examination in the diagnostic evaluation of \"c1imber's finger\". Purpose: To substantiate the feasibility of high resolution ultrasound (US) in the diagnostic evaluation of finger injury patterns in extreme rock climbers. Methods and Materials: Forty-one athletes with the c1inical diagnosis of \"climber's finger\" and twenty healthy volunteers underwent US examination using a 10.0 MHz probe (ATL, HDI 3000). The flexor tendon pulley system was measured at the level of the base of metacarpals during extended and forcibly f1exed position. We evaluated the distance between phalanx and tendon as a parameter of tendon-bowstringing. Results: The flexor tendon pulley system showed in healthy volunteers a thickness of 0.08 (\u00b1 0.03) cm compared to 0.20 (\u00b1 0.08) cm in curnoers.

Methods and Materials: 20 regions of ten workers exposed to vibration having elbow pain were involved in the study till now. Bidirectional Xray films and HRCT of the elbow joints were taken and the effectivity of visualization of the morphological disorders was compared and evaluated. Results: Even when plain film was negative, HRCT visualized small loose bodies in the joint space and also the dissection bed on the articular surface without degenerative changes of the joint. HRCT also detected soft tissue calcifications as residuum of inflammation. Osteochondritis dissecans cubiti due to vibration exposure is an occupational disease for recompensation by the law in Hungary. The correct diagnosis prevents the worker from further exposure and helps him to adequate therapy. Conclusion: Going on with this study we would like to determine the frequency of osteochondritis dissecans cubiti among vibration-exposed workers.

The correlation coefficient (r) was determined using linear regress ion analys is. Results: There was excellent correlation between the cross-sectional area of the median nerve on US and EMG findings. Patients with normal EMG demonstrated normal MN size while those with severely abnormal EMG demonstrated markedly enlarged MN. Moderately enlarged MN was seen with moderately abnormal EMG.

All examinations were analyzed independently by 2 experieneed radiologists with special regard to the following anatomie struetures: ligaments, tendons, hyaline eartilage, sinus tarsi and menisci, using a seoring system (1 =not visible; 2 =visible but not c1early defined; 3 =c1early defined). Results: Altough, both SS TSE and SS GRASE allowed reprodueible real time imaging of joint movement, SS TSE was superior in visualization and demareation of the anatomy in both joints (overall score: 2.7). The best visible struetures were the erueiate ligaments (average score: 2.9), menisei (2.8) and the peroneal tendon (2.7). Conclusion: ZOOM Imaging based on SS TSE in eombination with a MR-eompatible positioning deviee is a promising, reliable and reproducible teehnique for Real Time MR Imaging of aetive joint movement.",

Zimmermann; Innsbruek/A Purpose: to evaluate aeeuraey of high frequeney Ultrasound (US) in deteeting eomplete disseetion of isolated superficial or deep flexor tendons. Methods and Materials: 14 patients (mean age 24, range 14-54), 12 male and 2 female were referred to US of having an isolated superfieial or deep flexor tendon disseetion after arecent eutting injury on the finger. Sonographie examinations were earried out with a short linear sean head on a HDI 5000 (Advaneed Teehnology Laboratories, Bothell). Evaluation of the tendon gliding was analyzed in passive and aetive flexion of the injured finger. The sonographie dedeeted position of the proximal stump was doeumented. US results were eompared with those of intraoperative findings. Results: All patients showed thinning of the flexor tendons and fluid inside the tendon sheath. 7 patients had a disseetion of the deep flexor tendon and 7 patients a eomplete disruption of the superficial flexor tendon. The proximal stump showed a hypoeehoie echotexture beeause of fiber shortening. With US the proximal stump was found in 10 patients distally of the retinaeulum flexorum, eonfirmed by surgery. In 2 eases the proximal stump was not deteeted, at surgery the stump was found proximal of the retinaeulum flexorum. Conclusion: High frequeney US is helpful in loeating the proximal stump in eompletely dissected flexor tendons. Sonographie eriteria for flexor disseetion are proposed. Purpose: To eompare a silicon f1at panel deteetor with eonventional radiography for the deteetion of ehest abnormalities. Methods and Materials: Eighty patients (34 women, 46 men; mean age, 63 years; range, 18-91 years) who underwent eomputed tomography of the ehest were examined with the new digital radiography system (DRS) based on a 43x43 em silicon f1at panel deteetor and with the eonventional sereen-film system (CSF) in routine c1inieal praetiee. Three radiologists analyzed the pa and lateral radiographs for the presenee of abnormal struetures and proposed diagnoses using\u00b7 a five-Ievel rating seale of eonfidenee; eomputed tomography was used as the referenee standard. Seventeen of the eases were eompletely normal, whereas the remaining sixty-three eases demonstrated one or more eommon radiographie abnormalities. Diagnostie value was assessed using receiver operating eharaeteristie (ROC) eurves for eaeh abnormality. Results: The area under the ROC eurve for several abnormal struetures in different parts of the ehest showed no signifieant differenees. Conclusion: We eonelude that the new silicon f1at panel deteetor is equivalent to the eonventional screen-film system in diagnostie performance and ean replaee film radiographie systems to offer various advantages of digital systems. Purpose: The diagnostie quality of a newly developped digital radiography system (DRS) was eompared with a eonventional film sereen system (class 400) in routine ehest radiography. The diagnostie effeeieney of this new teehnique in visualization of various anatomie regions was evaluated aeeording to the German guidelines of teehnieal quality requirements. Methods and Materials: DRS is eomposed of a eaesiumjodide seintillator with a f1at panel sensor based on amorphous silicon in the size of 43 x. 43 em (pixel size 160 um), In 100 patients posteroanterior (pa) and lateral images were aequired with both the digital and the eonventional system. Three observers independantly analyzed the pa and lateral images with the ROC ranking method for 14 regions in the pa and 12 in the lateral view. The evaluation was repeated 2 weeks later in a different order and the images were rated a seeond time. Results: Digital image quality was signifieantly superior to that of eonventional ehest films in the mediastinum, hilum, soft tissues and ribs; better than or equal in the retroeardiae, and retrosternal region. It was equally rated for the azygoesophageal reeess, the thoraeie spine and the intrapulmonary structures. Conclusion: The new silicon sensor teehnology has a high signal-tonoise ratio, fulfills the teehnieal eriteria of spatial resolution in ehest imaging and is advantageous to the film sereen technique in eontrast resolution due to its high dynamie range. Visualization of anatomie struetures was better than or at least equal to that of film sereen images. DRS also offers diagnostie advantages in means of postproeessing.",

Methods and Materials: Soft-eopy report ing for three digital systems were evaluated: two storage phosphor systems, Fuji 9501 and Agfa ADC70, and the first generation of Imix, using a teehnique with an intensifying screen, opties and a CCD eamera. Fifty PA ehest images of volunteers were radiographed with each modality at a dose correspond ing to a 200-speed system . Modified European Quality Criteria were used to evaluate the visibility of ce ntral and peripherar ves sels. the carina, thoracie vertebrae, and pleural margin. The images were viewed by six radiologists on Siemens Simomed monitors and were evaluated individually and in pairs (using Visual Grading Analysis). Results: For all eriter ia, Fuji 9501 was significantly better than both ADC70 and Imix. ADClO was significantly better than Imix for all criter ia exeept the central vessels, for whieh no significant differenee was found . For Imix, the results from two consecutive improvements will be presented . Conelusion: The results indicate a eorrelation with the \"degree of maturity\" of the systems; the Fuji storage phosphor systems have been developed since the ear ly 80's whereas the Agfa and espee ially the Imix systems are substantially younger. Purpose: To evaluate if monitor reading of digital ehest x-rays in daily routine prolongs reading times eompared to hardeopy reading. Methods and Materials: 200 digital ehest radiographs of daily routine in two planes (100 eonsidered \"normal \" and 100 with pathologie findings) were evaluated by 4 radiologists at the alternator and at the workstation 8328 with a time interval of four weeks . Time f\u00fcr reading and postproeessing and for the handling of the images between two readings was measured separately. The evaluation was performed on an Ultra spare Sun workstation (SIEMENS, monitor brightness 250 cd/crrr': matrix 1024 x 1280 , software type VA31) and a DIN normed alternator. Results: Absolute reading time is dependent on the experiene e of the reader , the use of postprocessing and the familiarity with the software . . Coneerning all readers and images , there was no statistically significant differenee in the mean reading time for the workstation versus the alternator. The use of postpro eessing was dependent on the reader , ranging from 0% to about 32%. The mean time f\u00fcr switeh over at the workstation can be up to 50% less than the time spent on the handl ing of the films , dependent on the business of the workstation. Conelusion: Monitor read ing does not prolong the overall reading time of digital ehest x-rays. Purpose: to evaluate how soft copy reading of simulated pulmonary ehest lesions is influenced by mon itor resolution , ambient light and automatie optimization of monitor lum inanee. Methods and Materials: Four types of simulated lesions (nodules, Iines, mieronodules and patehy opacities) were superprojeeted over an antropomorphie ehest phantom . Lesion detection was assessed using soft copy reading under the follow ing four conditions: a) 2K monitor with subdued Iighting (referenee), b) 1K monitor without zoom function (subdued Iighting), e) 2K monitor without and d) with a sens itivity modulation to automatieally adjust the CRT luminanee to the inereased amount of ambient light for readings under day light eonditions .

Purpose: To evaluate neural nets for detection and quantification of ground glass opacities (GGO) in comparison with visual assessment and a density mask. Methods and Materials: Based on single self-organizing neural nets a hybrid network was developed to detect GGO (amorphous increase in lung density, -750 to -300 HU). 99 HRCT studies of 84 patients with suspected lung disease associated with GGO were prospectively performed. The results of the network were compared with visual assessment and a corresponding density mask. Frequency, extent and causes of false positive or negative results were determined. Results: The network categorized 6.3% of lung as GGO (1.3% were only seen by the network, 5% also by the density mask). The density mask categorized 22% of lung as GGO. Thus, 17% of lung exhibited the defined density values but not the texture of GGO. Compared to the visual assessment the network had a sensitivity of 99%, a positive predictive value of 78% and a negative predictive value of 100%. All scans and all patients with GGO were detected by the neural network. False positive findings were caused by partial volumes. Conelusion: The hybrid network is sufficiently accurate and sensitive to be used as a prereading of HRCT scans for suspected GGO. It is superior to a density mask. or lobectomy (n = 28) was performed for managing lung cancer (n =26), tuberculosis (n =6), aspergillosis (n = 5), bronchiectasis (n = 5), and others (n =2). The lungs were reconstructed as a 3D model on a GE Windows Advantage Workstation using a threshold of -400 HU. Functional lung volume (VPRE) was measured with exdusion of lung volume less than -910 HU. After removing the lung region to be resected on the 3D model, predicted postoperative functional lung volume (VPOST) was measured. Predicted postoperative FEV1 and FVC were calculated by multiplying preoperative spirometry values by ratio of VPOSTNPRE. These values were compared with those obtained from postoperative spirometry and preoperative perfusion lung scan. Results: Predicted values from CT data correlated weil with those from postoperative spirometry (FEV1: r =.94, p < .001; FVC: r =.91, p < .001) and those calculated from perfusion lung scans (FEV1: r = .90, p < .001; FVC:r = .90, P < .001). 1. Cyst aspiration. Very rarely is this indicated nowadays except for very large cysts which are causing symptoms or central cysts which are interfering with calyceal drainage. 2. Renal biopsy. In patients with renal failure, renal biopsy is best performed by ultrasonologists taking a careful peripheral core of cortex. In the renal mass situation renal biopsy is only of use when there is the possibility of 2 diagnoses. The present of lymphoma elsewhere may lead one to biopsy a renal mass and if there are multiple renal masses, metastases may be presence rather than multiple renal cell carcinomata. 3. Needle nephrostomy. The technique of needle nephrostomy in the emergency situation to relieve obstruction or to divert urine from a fistula will be covered. 4. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy. The method of track dilatation and the siting of an ideal track for stone removal will be discussed. PCNL in the age of lithotripsy will would be covered. 5. Endopyelotomy. The treatment of pelviureteric junction obstruction by endopyelotomy will be covered with particularly reference to the angle of approach and the different methods of Iysing the pelviureteric junction. 6.

This part of the workshop will focus on the percutaneous aspiration or suction thrombectomy. Material and Methods: Percutaneous aspiration or suction thrombectomy is the oldest percutaneous thrombectomy technique. Developed in the early eighties it took considerable time until clinical application became a wide-spread technique. However, the material required is simply a large-bore non-tapered aspiration catheter (5-8 French) and a 50 cc syringe to achieve negative pressure for aspiration. The technique will be demonstrated on video. Results: Several trials have shown applicability and safety of the aspiration technique to remove thromboembolic occlusive material in over 90% of the cases. The technique is not restricted to fresh ciot, but enables removal of older, partially organized material, as weil as walladherent thrombus after detachment with additional tools like baskets and spirals. The techniques is effective in treatment of embolie occlusions of lower limb arleries and achieves long-term results comparable to those of the surgical technique. Complications are puncture-side bleeding, distal embolization and dissection.

The commonest single indication for surgery in the paedlatric population in England is for \"glue\" ear, where the normal ventilation of the middle ear cleft is replaced by tenacious secretion. This disorder and other complications of middle ear sepsis are ultimately determined by dysfunction in the eustachian tube ventilation of the middle ear. Whilst \"glue\" ear does not require imaging other complications of chronic dysfunetion such as keratoma and mastoid infection certainly do, and require high quality cross sectional imaging using MR and Cr. The anatomy and physiology of the middle and external ear will be described with illustrative examples of the most important pathologies. Despite modern antibiotic therapies, intracranial complications of both sinus and ear disease still occur and requires assessment of the ear and adjacent brain. Diagnostic imaging of the sinuses. Whilst sinus infection is common, imaging is rarely required in children. Occasionally neoplasms are discovered within the sinuses and require accurate delineation and staging. Such investigations are however relatively infrequent and this talk will not deal with the issue of sinus neoplasia but instead deal with congenital anomalies of the sinuses and face ineluding nasal dermoids, facial cletts and microsomias. Once again these ehildren require very high quality CT and MR imaging to accurately delineate the nature of the congenital anomaly and to provide the surgeon with the data for making a rational decision on the timing and nature of surgery. Cerebrovascular disease is uncommon in children. The incidence is believed to be around 2.5 cases per 100,000 population per year, excluding cerebrovascular disease during the perinatal period. The causes of ischemic stroke in children are varied and quite different from those in adults. The imaging strategy is therefore different in children.",

Methods and Materials: We used a Magnetom Open (Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany) 0.2 Tesla scanner being located in our 'twin OR'. For intraoperative imaging a 3D-flash sequence (TR 16 ms, TE 7 ms) was used, allowing image update for neuronavigation. Results: Intraoperative MRI was performed in 129 patients (29 eases of suprasellar hormonally inactive pituitary adenomas, 43 gliomas, 6 ventricular tumors, 29 cases of epilepsy surgery and 22 other). The extent of resection could be evaluated intraoperatively in all cases, being especially helpful in low-grade glioma, ventricular tumors, and pituitary adenomas. It allowed in case of remaining tumor a second look, leading to complete removal. Furthermore it provided an update of image data for neuronavigation to compensate the effects of tumor removal and brain shift. Conclusion: The indications for intraoperative MRI are: 1. resection centrot in low-grade glioma, ventricular tumors, suprasellar hormonally inaclive piluilary adenomas, and in epilepsy surgery. 2. The need for update of neuronavigation to compensate the effects of tumor removal and brain shift. 3. Interventional procedures with therapy contral such as cryo-or laserablation.

Lesion-to-brain-contrast and contrast-tonoise-ratios (CNR) were calculated by region of interest (ROI). Results: Supratentorial lesions were shown by both conventional T2-TSE and single shot-T2-TSE with similar conspicuity.

Patients and Methods: Thirty patients with cerebra I tumours were examined on 1.0 T MR unit with 23 mT/m gradient strength. The total scan time for T1-3D-EPI-sequence was 2 min 12 sec, for conventional 3D-GE sequence it was 4 min 59 sec. Both sequences were performed after administration of contrast agent. The images were analysed by two radiologists. Image assessment criteria included lesion conspicuity, contrast between different types of normal tissue and image artefacts. In addition, signal-to-noise-, and contrast-to-noise-ratio was calculated. Results: Grey-white differentiation and C/N ratio of 3D-EPI were found to be inferior to conventional 3D-GE images, but the difference was not statistically significant. In the qualitative comparison, the lesion detection and conspicuity of 3D-EPI images and conventional 3D-GE images were similar, but the scanning time was reduced to 50%.

Results: Manual processing time was 3 +1-1 min for UC and 21 +1-11 min for SC. Computation time was 2.1 +1-0.3 h for UC and 2.2 +1-0.3 h for SC. Automatie segmentation was performed with respect to tissue c1asses gray/white matter and CSF. Evaluation of segmentation quality by a neuroradiologist on a 5-grade semiquantitative score (1 = excellent, 5 = insufficient) revealed 1.7 for SC and 2.0 for UC. The maximal ratio of voxels c1assified differently by UC and SC was 4%. Conclusion: Both UC and SC are powerful state-of-the-art techniques for automatie brain segmentation based on multispectral MR data. SC reveals slightly better segmentation results than UC, but requires more human processing time. We recommend neural networks as a precise, effective, and reliable approach to clinical brain segmentation. Purpose: Development of a method for fully-automatic segmentation of MRI data of the human brain by self-organized neural network (NN) elastic matching. Methods and Materials: 10 volunteers were examined employing a standardized MRI protocol (1.5 T system, T1w MP-RAGE, T2w/PDw SE, IR, anatomically correct registration). Fully-automatic segmentation was performed by a novel algorithm (A. Wismueller, H. Ritter, to be published in \"Neural Networks\"): the Deformable Feature Map (DM). Hereby, image data form a complex-shaped cluster in a 7-dimensional feature space (3 spatial, 4 gray value dimensions). By self-organized elastic deformation, this cluster is matched onto a corresponding cluster of a single maunally segmented reference data set. For evaluation, semi-automatic supervised NN segmentation was performed on the same data. Results: Segmentation was performed w.r.t. c1asses gray/white matter and CSF. Evaluation bya neuroradiologist on a 5-grade semiquantitative score (1 =excellent, 5 =insufficient) revealed 2.0 +1-0.3 for DM vs. 1.7 +/-0.2 for semi-automatic NN. The maximal ratio of voxels classified differently for DM and NN was 5.1 %. Conclusion: Conventional NN segmentation yields slightly better results, but requires human working power i.e, manual contour tracing of training data, interactive classification of pixel clusters, etc. We recommend neural networks as a precise, effective, and reliable approach to c1inical brain segmentation. Purpose: The CSF pulsation within the aqueduct depend not only on the cardiac cycle but also on respiration. In a volunteer study, we examined systematic changes of CSF pulsation in relation to the respiration. Methods and Materials: An echo planar imaging measurement technique was modified to allow the acquisition of 1024 succesive measurements of aselected slice. Additionally, the cardiac cycle and respiration was recorded. Signal courses were examined in 16 volunteers. Results: Two maxima were found in the avaraged signal course after sorting the data to the delay within the cardiac pulse wave. Using additional saturation pulses, the first maximum could be identified as caused by caudal directed flow while the flow during the second maximum was due to cranial directed f1ow. In 13 of 15 measurements differences in the signal course were found during expiration compared to inspiration phases. The analysis showed an increased caudal flow and a decreased cranial direct flow during expiration. Conclusion: The detection of different flow pattern in distinct respiration phases can be used for an improved characterization of flow alterations in patients with hydrocephalus and other intracranial pathology.",

Methods and Materials: Two surveys were performed. 1) The staff radiologists (n = 20) were asked to collect data during 10 working 5336 days concerning number of contacts, their modalities (personal meetings, phone), time comsuption and reasons (organizational issues vs diagnostic problems); 2) The staff c1inicians (n = 174) of the hospital were asked to fill in a questionnaire concerning the same issues and moreover on the effects of consultations on diagnostic strategy and therapeutic decisions. Results: Each radiologist had a mean of 3.95 contacts per day with the clinicians (48.2% were personal meetings and 51.8% were telephone conversations). Each radiologist was involved for as long as 21.65 min. per day for dialogue with c1inicians. 54% of contacts were related to organizational issues and 46% to diagnostic problems. The consultations were reported the have helped correct the diagnostic strategy often or sometimes (84%), rarely or never (16%) and to have helped correct therapeutic decisions often or sometimes (67%), rarely or never (33%). Conclusion: Consultations between radiologists and clinicians are time consuming (roughly one whole time equivalent radiologist in our Department) but provide beneficial diagnostic and therapeutic impact.",

Methods and Materials: MRI was performed in 10 consecutive fetuses within 24 h of delivery. Severe malformation was diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound (US) and/or genetic work-up. Necrapsy served as gold standard. MRI was performed on a 1.5 T MR-Unit, T1 and T2-weighted sequences were acquired. Images were interpreted by two radiologists unaware of US-and necropsy-findings. The study was approved by the ethics committee, informed consent was obtained. Results: US, MRI and necrapsy all provided sufficient information either to initiate or confirm correct obstetric managemnt. MRI confirmed all US criteria responsible for termination of pregnancy, the additional necropsy data would not have changed the decisions made. MRI and US outperformed necropsy in cerebral pathology, MRI however is severely Iimitated in the evaluation of cardiac pathologies. Necropsy outperformed US and MRI in two infants with complex malformations. Conclusion: MRI pravides non-invasive access to information previously available only from necropsy and thus can be used to confirm prenatal US diagnosis if perinatal necropsy is refused by the parents.",

Facciolo; Milan/I Purpose: The aim of this study is to evaluate the results of the first 100 endoscopic ultrasound examinations (EUS) carried on in co-operation between radiologists and endoscopists in order to define the correct indications to the procedure. Methods and Materials: An EUB 525 Hitachi ultrasound device with a Pentax FC 36UX endoscope and a 5-7.5 MHz micro convex transducer (100 0 wide vision angle) , with Color and Power Doppler, was used. After endoscopic positioning of the probe at the required level, the examination proceeds according to the echographic reference marks , mainly identifying vascular structures . Results: EUS has been used to study GI wall in 61 cases (mainly tumors , 14 oesophageal, 12 gastr ic and 13 rectal) , pancreas in 21, perivisceral lesions in 14 (mainly perigastric) and to characterize focal hepatic (3) and adrenal (1) lesions in critical sites. In all cases of hepatic and pancreatic lesions EUS has contr ibuted in obtaining further US find ings, thus allowing the diagnos is of the nature of the lesion in 6 and increasing the diagnostic confidence in the other cases. The study of G.1. wall, allows to differentiate the mucosal or submucosal origin of the tumor , but shows a lower accuracy in defining the deep of the wall layers infiltration (72% of accuracy in T staging of rectal carcinoma) . Conclusion: EUS is proving to be a versatile technique and that may be used by radiologists as further investigalion technique when traditional transcutaneous US is unable to provide an adequate acoustic window. Convex transducer is less sensitive than linear higher frequency probes in identifying wall layers , but allows guidance of fine-needle aspiration. Purpose: To assess the diagnostic performance of CT arterial portography (CTAP), SPIO-enhanced-MR, and intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) with regard to Iiver metastases of colorectal cancer in comparison to histopathology. Methods and Materials: Between 7/1995 and 8/1998 51 patients underwenl preoperalive ullrasound, CTAp, and SPIO -enhanced MR with EndoremR , as weil as IOUS in liver resect ion. Gold standard was histopathologic analysis of Iiver resect ion specimens . Results: IOUS was able to show all metastasis (sensitiv ity 100%), in one case Ihere was a false positive find ing consisting of a hemangioma (spec ificity 99.6%). In 6 cases susp icion of metastasic disease was ruled out. Sensitivity (specificity) of CT arterial portography 98% (53%) , of SPIO-enhanced MR 98% (96%), of preoperative ultrasound 64% (87%) . Conclusion: Intraoperative ultrasound is the best method for detection of liver metastasis and should be performed in planned Iiver resection. Preoperatively, SPIO-enhanced MR is superior to CTAP due to its higher specificil y. However, both methods have a very high sensitivily with respect to metastases. Ultrasound with its high specificity is useful in the postoperative phase as a screen ing method . with CTP (n =10) and/or MRP (n =8).

Peloschek, J. Kletzmayer, K. Eibenberger, G. Lechner; Vienna/A Purpose: To evaluate the effect of carnitine supplementation on rh-EPO requirement in maintenance dialysis patients, and to investigate carnitine induced effects on iron-metabolism of the liver and spleen . Methods and Materials: A placebo controlled double blinded study was performed in 40 hemodialysis patients , 20 patients received L-carnitine Iv. after each dialysis session , and 20 patients received placebo (0.9% saline) . L-carnitine and placebo , respectively were administe red over aperiod of 8 months . MR studies were performed prior to carnitine substitution therapy, after 4 months and 8 months of carnitine administration. We performed T2-weighted fast spin echo sequences (TRITE = 3000/120) in the axial and coronal plane. T2-ralaxat ion times were evaluated from a mixed sequence (TRITE =1800/20, TRIRlIR = 1400/400) by using a special software (RLSQ) . Results: Patients responding to L-carnitine treatment had higher hemoglobin levels at study entry compared to non-responders. The difference was maintained throughout the study and responders achieved higher hemoglobin levels at the study end. Analysis of MR images showed a significant correlalion of T2 relaxation times of the Iiver and spleen at baseline measurements (0.746 /0.897). In addition, signal intensity values of the Iiver were comparable to signal intensity values of the spleen (0.768 vs. 0.62). Carn itine substitution led to a significant increase in SI of the spleen in 9/1 1 patients. T2-relaxation times of the Iiver and the spleen increased, however, the difference was not significant. Conclusion: Carnitine supplementation can reduce rh-EPO requirement in a subgroup of patienl s. Carnitine induced alterations in iron metabolism seem to be highest in the spleen, probably caused by an increased release of iron. Purpose: Quantitative evaluation of hepatic and splenic hemosiderosis in b-thalassem ic palients has been performed by calculating hepatic and splenic T2 relaxation times. The purpose of our study was to investigate the relation between the degree of splenic and hepatic iron overload in b-thalassemia. Splenic and hepat ic T2 values were also correlated with total iron stores as expressed by serum ferritin, and the age of the patients. Methods and Materials: Liver and spleen T2 relaxation times were calculated in 45 thalassem ic patients , aged 13-39 years (28 nonspleneclomized and 17 spleneclomized at least 3 years ago), on a 0.5T magnet, by means of a multiecho sequence (TR:2000ITE :12, in 20 symmetrically repeatable echoes) . Results: a) Hepatic T2 values were significantly lower than splenic T2 values in all 28 non-spleneclomized patients individually. b) Splenie T2 values were significantly correlated with the age of patients (r = 0.71), moderately correlated with hepatic T2 values (r = 0.38) but not correlated with serum ferritin (r '\" 0 .20) . c) A elose correlation between hepatic T2 values and serum ferr itin was found both in splenectomized and non-splenectomized patienls (r =0.84 and r =0.87 respe ctively) , whereas no correlation was found between age and hepatic T2 values. Conclusion: Splenic hemosiderosis in b-thalassemia, seems to be heavier with preceeding age and does not reflect total iron stores .",

Passengers suspected of drug smuggling by 'bodypacking' are referred to Hillingdon Hospital, by drug enforcement officers, for plain AXR to detect concealed drug packages. The AXRs are performed on consenting individuals, under radiological supervision. Our seven year experience from November 1990 has been audited. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest series in the literature. Methods and Materials: 1010 consecutive studies were classified as positive, negative or indeterminate for drug packages. This data was then correlated with drug enforcement and hospital records. Films were reviewed for characteristic features. Results: 100 (10%) reports were positive and 859 (85%) were negative. Of the 51 (5%) indeterminate cases, 8 (16%) were found to be carrying drug packages. No false positive or false negative reports were found, although as a negative report generally resulted in release of the suspect, the true false negative rate ls unknown.

Conclusion: CE-MRA is a rapid, reliable method to evaluate patients with suspected carotid artery stenosis. A further advantage is the large field of view allowing evaluation of the aortic arch, origin of the supraaortic vessels and carotid arteries up to the intracranial portion. Purpose: To compare cardiac-gated TOF technique with GE one performed with bolus injection of contrast medium, in the study of carotid bifurcation. Methods and Materials: Forty carotid bifurcations affected by stenoocclusive disease were evaluated by 1.5 T unit MRI, echodoppler and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Results: The GE technique performed after bolus injection of contrast medium showed in all cases a good correlation of diagnostic information with DSA in stenosis quantification and in evaluation of the plaque morphology. TOF technique was not diagnostically significant in 2 cases due to motion artifacts. In 4 cases of tight stenosis, the TOF technique did not show flow signal. Saturation phenomena did not allow evaluation of 2 cases of \"coiling\" with TOF technique. In 4 cases, overestimation of the stenosis was observed in TOF technique. TOF technique and DSA were overlapping in the evaluation of stenosis in 28 out of 40 cases. Conclusion: The GE technique performed with contrast medium injection, easy to perform and minimally invasive, proved to be more reliable than TOF technique in providing diagnostic information. In addition the GE technique can also be performed in case of scarcely co-operating patients, since it lasts only a few seconds. The almost constant overlapping with the venous system allows us to suggest the use of this technique not as areplacement of, but rather as a useful complement to the TOF technique. Methods and Materials: Forty-two MR angiograms in 19 patients were performed. The imaging protocol included phase contrast (30PC) and inflow techn iques (201) and MR tlow measurements. A signal void on 30PC and/or 201 was interpreted as a sign ificant stenosis (~50 %). Each MRA was followed by digital subtraction angiography. Results: At angiography 38 stenoses of~50% were found .

The acquisition time ranged between 8 and 10 s to distinguish the arterial and venous phase. Time-resolved angiography was performed by 10 repetitive measurements of the 3d volume during injection of i.v. contrast agent (Gd-DTPA, 0.2 mmol/kg, 2.5 ml/s). Ten volunteers were examined with this technique Results: Time resolved angiography was performed in all examinations successfully, the arterial and venous phases were distinguishable. In all examinations the common palmar digital arteries and the whole palmar arterial arch could be clearly depicted. The mean visualization of the digital arteries was 60%. Conclusion: Time-resolved MRA is easy to handle, because no scantiming relative to the contrast agent bolus is required. It is a very fast examination and offers additional advantages due to temporal information. The c1inical value of this new technique must be prooved by further c1inical studies. Purpose: To assess the change in diagnostic confidence between first and follow up dynamic MR examination of the breast (MRM) when follow up was recommended.",

The double breast MR examinations were performed at 1.5 or 1.0 T with 32 axial 4 mm slices or 64 coronal 2.5 mm slices. Before and after bolus administration of Gd-DTPA (0.16 mmol/kg) 6-7 repetitive studies were acquired within 9-10 minutes. The change in diagnostic confidence was retrospectively c1assified as folIows: controlled lesion vanished during follow up (category I); diagnostic confidence increases during follow up (11), more likely benign (1Ia), more likely malignant (lIb); no difference in diagnostic confidence (111). The reasons for MRM follow up were protocoled and the lesions morphologically classified. Results: In 98 follow up examinations, only two cases vanished (2%). In 77/98 cases a category Ila lesion was diagnosed, in 11 cases a category IIb lesion. Lesions in category Ilb underwent biopsy in 10/11 cases, and in one case long term follow up proved a completely regredient inflammatory change. In 8/11 suspicious findings (lIb) a malignant tumor was detected. In 8 cases (8%) there was no change in diagnostic confidence during follow up. The distribution of the lesions in categories was independent from lesion size. The percentage of Ilb lesions in patients with underlying malignant disease was 26%, otherwise 4%. The mean time interval between first and follow up MRM was 8 months for 1-lIb lesions, and 4 months for category 111. Conclusion: MRM follow up increases the diagnostic confidence, if the time interval is adequate (>6 months). A persistantly or increasingly suspicious finding warrants biopsy.",

Purpose: After initial non-surgical treatment about 70% of children with clubfeet will require surgical correction of residual foot deformities. Ta preoperatively assess these deformities correctly, especially of the forefoot, is many times difficult. The present study was undertaken with the aim to find out whether ultrasound (US) can be used to reveal displacement of the navicular and the cuboid which is seen in dubfeet with persistent forefoot adduction. Methods and Materials: Altogether 23 clubfeet in 19 children aged 1-9 months were examined pre-and postoperatively by US using three weil defined projections. A control group of 20 normal feet in 10 children were examined at birth and at the age of 6 months. Results: Preoperatively the navicular was severely displaced toward the medial mallealus in 14 out of 23 clubfeet, displaced plantarwards in one foot and the cuboid was elose to normal position in all feet. Conelusion: By US residual displacement of the navicular and the euboid ean be revealed, whieh might be impossible to assess correctly by elinical examination. We therefore recommend the use of US routinely prior to surgical correction of clubfoot deformities up to the age of 3 years.",

Results: In this series, 29 fractures were found in 24 patients. Of these fractures, 10 were located in the fibula, 4 in the medial malleolus, 1 in the first and 1 in the fifth metatarsal, 1 in a distal phalanx of the great toe, 2 in the cuboid, 8 in the calcaneus and 2 in the talus, Of these 29 fractures, 10 were only detectable on a reversed oblique radiograph.

Conclusion: If taken on a routine base, a reversed oblique incidence of the foot demonstrated 10 fractures in 100 patients, that would have been missed if only the routine incidences of PA and normal oblique incidence were taken. Especially in patients with a localized painful swelling on the lateral aspect of the dorsum of the foot, this incidence plays an important role to detect otherwise missed fractures.

In the first part, the basic level of reports was assessed by asking nuclear medicine departments of Finnish hospitals to send first five already reported BSs of the year 1996 to Labquality Ud, the Finnish organiser of external quality schemes. The BSs and reports were sent anonymously to three nuclear medicine experts who read the images and reports. They scored descriptive and interpretative part and the overall quality of the reports from 0 (very poor) to 3 (good) according to accepted criteria. The participants received feedback and recommendations how to improve the quality of reports. In the second part of the study, five abnormal bone scans including two white blood cell scans were sent to hospitals and asked to give their reports of the scans. The same three experts graded them according to accepted criteria from 0 (very poor) to 3 (good) and gave feedback of the quality of the reports. Fourteen nuclear medicine departments participated in the both parts of the study and their results are presented. On the first round when the hospitals read their own BSs the mean values were 2.14 \u00b1 0.46 for overall quality, 2.23 \u00b1 0.36 for descriptive part and 2.09 \u00b1 0.51 for interpretative part. In 5 hospitals the average score of interpretative part and overall quality of reports was unsatisfactory low \u00ab2). On the second round when the cases were more complicated the mean scores did not differ markedly from the values of the first round. The mean scores were 2.13 \u00b1 0.45 for the overall quality, 2.30 \u00b1 0.45 for descriptive part, and 2.06 \u00b1 0.41 for interpretative part. In 3 hospitals the overall quality was less than 2; in one of them the scores of both rounds were inadequate. In two hospitals the scores dropped more than 30% on the second round. As a conclusion, the quality of Finnish BSs reports is relative good. The quality can be improved by quiding because no drops in mean values were noted although on the first round the hospitals read familiar, often normal bone scans, but on the second round the cases were abnormal and complicated. A follow-up round is planned to arrange in near future.",

Radiolog ie findings were correlated with clinical data. Results: HRCT was normal in 3 patients (27%), and abnormal in 8 patients (73%). The most common abnormalities were bronchial wall thickening (6 patients, 60%), bronchiectasis (5 patients , 45%), parenchymal consolidations (5 patients , 45%), and ground glass opacities (5 patients , 45%) . Bronchial wall thickening was combined with bronchiectasis in 5 patients (45%) and ground glass opacities were associated with parenchymal consolidations in 5 patients (45%) . The mean severity score for abnormalities was 1.8 (of grade 0-4). Distribution was peripheral in 3 patients (27%), central in one patient (10%) and diffuse in 3 patients (27%). In 5 of 8 patients (65%) with abnormalities, disease was predom inantly basal. No significant correlation (p > 0.05) was seen between detailed radiological abnormalities and clinical duration of disease, annual frequency ot infections, or the IgA level.

Purpose: To compare the diagnost ic efficacy and costs of unenhanced spiral-CT and intravenous urography (IVU) in the management of patients with acute flank pain. Methods and Materials: Unenhanced spiral-CT and IVU were compared in 66 patients with acute flank pain followed by an IVU. The spiral-CT protocol was: 5-mm section thickness, 7.5-mm table feed and 3-mm increment. The analysis enta iled : (a) Morphology: presence of stone disease (yes-no), localization and size of calculi, periureteral and perirenal stranding, dilatation of the collecting system , and possible alternat ive diagnoses and (b) cost-effectiveness: direct and indirect costs . Results: Fifty-two patients had urolithiasis. The detection rate of renal and ureteric calculi was significantly higher with unenhanced spiral-CT than with IVU (100% vs 69% respectively) (p < 0.05). A specific sign of ureteric calcul i was the periureteral stranding (sens itivity 82% and specificity 100%, respectively). In 13 of 14 patients with acute flank pain without urolithias is alternative diagnoses could be made by spiraJ-CT. Spiral-CF was significantly more cost-effective than IVU in management. Concluslon: Unenhanced spiral-CT is faster, more effective and less expens ive than IVU in management of patients with acute flank pain. Additionally, it poses less risk and has the capability to allow alternative diagnoses. Therefore, unenhanced spiraJ-CT should be the first line modal ity in patients with acute flank pain.",

Forty-two patients were proved to have ureteral stones based on stone recovery, pyelography, urologic intervention or clinical follow up. Twenty four patients were proved not to have ureteric stone disease based on diagnosed unrelated intra/extraurinary abnormalities or clinical follow up. Results: Ureteric stones were diagnosed in 40 cases with 4 false negative and 2 false positive results (sensitivity 90%, specificity 92%). Additional findings were observed in 37 patients with ureteric stones, including hydroureter (n =33), periureteric edema (n =13), hydronephrosis (n = 18), perinephric edema (n = 12)",

All patients underwent diuretic renography and duplex Doppler sonography before and after administration of furosemide. Results: According to the half-time drainage patterns at diuretic renography, kidneys were classlfled as nonobstructed (13) and obstructed (15). At baseline, the mean RI values of nonobstructed and obstructed kidneys were not significantly different (0.66 and 0.64, respectively).",

Fenn, G. Brown, M.W. Bourne; Cardiff/UK Purpose: To evaluate MR urography using single shot fast spin echo (SSFSE) along with conventional T2 FSE MR in patients prior to antegrade or retrograde pyelography. Methods and Materials: Patients with a non functioning kidney or hydronephrosis undergoing retrograde or antegrade pyelography were evaluated by ssfse MR urography and T2 FSE MRI. Conventional imaging in all patients had failed to demonstrate a level or cause for obstruction. Thirty-eight patients were examined and the diagnostic value of ssfse MR urography with and without T2 FSE axial images was compared with antegrade or retrograde pyelography and the final diagnosis. Results: In 14 patients MRU alone was able to demonstrate the cause and level of obstruction, however there were 4 false positive diagnoses and 15 false negative diagnoses. With utilisation of the T2 FSE axial images the number of correct diagnoses increased to 29 with one false positive diagnosis. Conclusion: The analysis of ssfse alone has a low diagnostic yield, however with the combination of T2 FSE and MRU, the diagnostic accuracy compares favorably with diagnostic antegrade and retrograde pyelography. This can potentially lead to a reduction in the number of diagnostic pyelographic procedures with potential cost savings. ",

Subjects and Methods: 34 patients with suspected acute renal obstruction were examined with MR Imaging using a 1.5 T magnet (Siemens Vision Plus). In all cases a 3D HASTE sequence was used (TR =11; TE =87; Matrix =128 x 256; TA =12 sec; FOV =263 x 300; No. Slices =6). A three-dimensional reconstruclion was obtained using a MIP algorithm. In all patients sonography was also performed within approximately 1 hour from the MR examination. Presence, level and cause of obstruction were considered. Results: Acute renal obstruction was present in 27 patients. MRU correctly allowed to determine the presence and level of obstruction in all cases. Sonography allowed to determinethe presence of obstruction in all cases, while the level of obstruction in 17 patients. MR imaging allowed to identify the cause of obstruction in 23 patients, while sonography in 13. Conclusion: MRU is an accurate technique in the determination of presence and level of obstruction, allowing to identify the pathology in many instances. A cost analysis should be performed to evaluate the possibility to extensively use MRU in patients with acute renal obstruction.

The parameters used were. TE = 250 ms, TR = 4000 rns, T1 = 160 ms, Slice thickness 4-10 cm. Matrix 256 x 256 and FOV 30Q-400 mm. Results: This sequence take an aquestion time of 4 seconds. and a total examination time of 8-12 minutes for each patient. The pelvica-Iyceal systems, parenchymal cysts, ureters and urinary bladder were visualised in all cases. In the 28 cases of advanced hydronephrosis; the dilated calyces were few and communicating to each other with dilated pelvis. The site of obstruction either pelvi-ureteric 5 cases (17.9% %), distal ureteric 11 cases (39.3%) or in between 12 cases (43.8%) was detected in 100% of cases. Stones were detected in 12 cases. In the 12 cases of advanced polycystic disease the cysts were numerous and variable in size. No dilatation of pelvis or ureters with no signs of obstruction. Conclusion: MRU is a rapid and accurate method in differentiating polycystic renal disease from advanced hydronephrosis and detect site of obstruction in 100% of cases and can detect cause of obstruction.",

Adam, J.M. Neuerburg, P. Jung, G. Jakse, R.w. G\u00fcnther; AachenlD Purpose: To investigate the value of diuretic-enhanced gadolinium (Gd)-OTPA excretory MR urography (OGMRU) in comparison to intravenous pyelography (IVP) and retrograde pyelography. Methods and Materials: In 140 urologie patients, OGMRU was performed using respiratory gated or breath-hold T1-weighted 3D gradientecho sequences after injection of first 5-10 mg furosemide and then, 30-60 sec later, 0.1 mmol/kg Gd-OTPA MR urograms were reviewed by 3 blinded radiologists, and subsequently compared with the standard radiographie examinations. Results: The precontrast low-dose furosemide injection led to a rapid and uniform Gd-distribution inside the collecting system, while simultaneously, endoluminal T2*-effects were minimized. In normal or moderately reduced kidney function, complete enhancement of the urinary tract was obtained within 5-20 minutes. OGMRU established the appropriate diagnosis in almost all cases. DGMRU was significantly superior to IVP in the visualization of the ureters, and comparable to retrograde pyelography. Oelineation of caliceal fornices and small intrarenal calculi by OGMRU was inferior to radiographic techniques, but did not degrade its overall diagnostic value. For optimal pelvicaliceal depiction, maximal motion artefact suppression was essential such as with respiratory gating or preferrably breath-hold acquisition. Conclusion: OGMRU offers an accurate alternative imaging modality to radiography in most urologic diseases. The major advantage of OGMRU is its exquisite depiction of the ureters which should reduce the need for invasive retrograde pyelography. Objective: To assess a low-dose Gd-OTPA MRU in depiction of the urinary system. Material and Methods: 94 patients suffering from various urinary system pathologies were examined. No external compression was used, no diuretic drugs were administered. The studies were performed on a 1.5 T-system (Magnetom Sp, Siemens) using the body coil. The study consisted of: -aseries of 10 breath-hold FLASH 20 sequences repeated every minute. After the first sequence an i.v, bolus of 0.01 mmol/kg bw. of Magnevist (Schering) was administered (1/10 of currently used dose). -a FISP 3D sequence showing enhanced urine in the urinary tracts; -a T2-weighted TSE sequence. The FISP and TSE images were reconstructed using an MIP algorithm. Results: Image quality and diagnostic value was satisfactory in all the FLASH studies, 84% of FISP studies and 77.7%% ofTSE studies. Both ureters were shown in 47.9% of successful TSE studies and in 63% of successful FISP studies, one ureter at least was shown in 64.6% of successful TSE studies and in 79.7% of successful FISP studies. Conclusion: The low-dose Gd-OTPA Magnetic Resonance Urography seems to be a reliable method of assessing of the urinary system. It shows better the ureters than a T2-weighted TSE MRU. Purpose: to determine the diagnostic performance of the virtual endoscopy (VE) in patients with abladder tumour in comparison with endoscopy, intravenous pyelograms (IVP), and axial CT-slices. Methods and Materials: 28 patients were scanned with a helical CT (slice thickness 2 mm, pitch 2). Either contrast medium or gas was given via abladder catheter. 28 patients were included as a negative control group. The VE was evaluated by three radiologists and the results compared with those of endoscopy, IVP and axial CT images. Low dose mAs settings were performed. Results: All tumours detected in endoscopy -ranged between 5 and 55 mm -were also seen in the VE. No statistically significant difference was evaluated between the results of VE and endoscopy, however, axial CT images and IVP's were statistically significantly inferior compared with the two methods. The application of gas in the bladder did not reveal wall defects in contrast to that of contrast medium (Sedimentation). Navigational aids were essential for the navigation inside the bladder. No interobserver variability was calculated. A five-fold dose reduction resulted in increasing noise, the VE showed comparable results to those of endoscopy. Conclusion: VE is a non-invasive method which is a sensitive tool for the detection of endoluminal bladder tumours in selected cases (patients's rejection of endoscopy, technical difficulties). Material and Methods: 39 patients with various abnormalities of the urinary tract were studied, inciuding 15 urinary bladder tumors, 6 pelvicaliceal tumors, 5 stone, 4 patients with enterocystoplasty, 3 patients with urine diversion in a Bricker tube, 1 patient with a papilary necrosis, 5 patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy. 4 additional patients had VE in normal urethra. Results: In all cases, post-injection slices were acquired using the following parameters: single helical scan, 1 s scan time, 3 mm slice thickness, pitch 1:1.5, reconstruction every 1 mm. VE was successfully realized in all case; all abnormalities were correctly visualized using this technique. VE does not demand any patient preparation or bladder catheterization; easy to process (average of 10 minutes per case) even in non distended urinary tract. All the filling defects were easy to identify (differenciation between tumor and stone demand the axial slices). Conclusion: VE is a valuable tool for imaging the lumen of all parts of the urinary tract. Comparison studies are in progress to assess the value of VE in follow-up of urinary bladder tumors treated by local immunotherapy. Purpose: To increase the diagnostic accuracy of MRI in the detection and in the loco-regional staging of bladder tumors by using Fluidattenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) sequences. Methods and Materials: 32 patients with bladder tumors detected by US underwent MRI using a 1.5 T superconductive unit (Gyroscan NT, Philips Medical System). We performed SE T1-weighted (TR: 500 ms, TE: 30 ms), TSE T2-weighted (TR: 2500 ms, TE: 120 ms, ETL: 40) and FLAIR sequences (TR: 6000 ms, TE: 150 rns, TI: 2000 ms, N.Ex.: 4; Acq. time: 7'30\") on axial scans. The contrast to lesion ratio was evaluated in all sequences. All the patients underwent cystoscopy with biopsy and 14 had subsequent surgical procedures.",

Conclusion: FLAIR sequences are more sensitive than others to demonstrate bladder neoplasms, especially small papillomas, and are useful in the staging of bladder tumors. Objective: Diabetic cystopathy is a severe complication of diabetes mellitus. Two stages of the disease are recognized: a) incipient, with loss of fullness sensation and residual urine only, and b) fully established, with residual urine, secondary infection, and loss of renal function. We evaluated the capability of US to identify early signs of this condition through analysis of bladder volume and residual urine. Methods and Materials: We assessed morning bladder volume and presence of postvoiding residual urine in 36 diabetics (18 m, 18 f; age range 18-47, mean 36) and in 10 age-matched controls. Results were correlated with duration of diabetes and presence and degree of associated autonomie neuropathy. Results: Bladder volume in diabetics (range 75-1334 ml) was significantly larger than in controls (range 85-756 ml). Fifteen had bladder larger than the upper value in controls. In these patients, there was significantly higher prevalence of postvoiding residual urine (46% vs 12%) and a significantly higher mean autonomie neuropathy score (2.36 vs 1.16).

All patients were on surveillance for stage I testicular tumour, with a minimum follow-up of four years. Three observers recorded blind the site, size and numbers of nodes in the retroperitoneum and pelvis in 11 sites. The results were compared with previous CT. Results: A total of 781 nodes in 12 patients were visible on the initial MR images and a further 44 nodes identified after comparison with the previous post-Iymphangiogram CT. Median short axis diameter (MSAD) values were less than 5 mm at all sites. A greater number of normal sized nodes were seen on MRI compared with CT. T1-weighted images were found to be the most useful for nodal evaluation. Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy of three-dimensional transrectal ultrasound to visualize injected polydimethylsiluxane (Macroplastique; Uroplasty, The Netherlands) implants. Methods and Materials: In 37 patients (2 female, 35 male) threedimensional transrectal ultrasound was performed before, during and after injections of polydimethylsiloxane implants for tratment of urinary stress incontienece. All patients suffered from postoperative, neurogenic or genuine stress incontinence. The ultrasound equipment used for this study consisted of a Combison 330 and a Voluson 3D multiplanar endorectal transducer (7.5 MHz) produced by Kretztechnik (Austria). Results: In 1 patient with posttraumatic incontinence the rhabdosphincter could not be identified. In all other patients the rhabdosphincter could be clearly seen. Defects or atrophies of the rhabdosphincter were present in all patients. After Macroplastique injection the depots presented as hyperechogenic structures. The correlation between the depots and the rhabdosphincter could be demonstrated very weil; especially the coronal plane provided exact information of the position of the Macroplastique depots. Treatment was successful in 73% of patients.

Methods and Materials: Fifteen women were examined with an lmatron C-150XP Ultrafast CT Scanner, software version 12.34. In each patient 20 acquisitions were performed in the multislice fiow mode during strain. The sections were sorted by a selfmade program creating 20 data volumes consisting of the 8 slices of one 224 ms scan interval. Then the entire data volume was interpolated to 2 mm slice spacing to overcome the technically caused 4 mm gaps between the four double slices. The 20 data sets were volume rendered with identical rendering features (Silicon Graphics Onyx i-Station, Infinite Reality graphics board, modified VolRen volume renderer, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore). Results: A set of twenty 3D images for a 3D movie with a time resolution of 232 ms over a range of 7.6 cm in the z-axls was created. Conclusion: EBCT can provide dynamic 3D data sets of the pelvic floor in a unique time resolution. The acquired volume is limited to 7.6 cm in the z-axis, the limited spacial resolution seems to be sufficient for dynamic imaging. Purpose: To evaluate the results and complications of mechanical balloon thrombectomy (MBT) of hemodialysis fistulas. Methods and Materials: 41 MBT in 29 consecutive chronic hemodialysis patients (mean age 58 \u00b1 19 years) with acute vascular access thrombosis were performed. There were 9 Brescia-Cimino and 20 PTFE grafts. After MBT, 2 patients were excluded because of type of underlying lesions. Angioplasty balloons were used to promote clot disruption and Fogarty type embolectomy was done using the same balloon. Underlying stenosis were dilated or stented.

The rt-PA was infused direclly into the AVF usually close to the anastomosis in 10 mg doses at one hour intervals to a maximum of 40 mg (mean dose 27.5 mg). Before the beginning of the treatment and before every infusion a fistulography has been performed to access the fistula 's patency. All patients presented bleeding at the puncture site after the removal of the catheter (controlled with compression) and one had bleeding at a remote site (gengives) . In five out of seven fistula we had complete thrombolysis with return of bruit and thrilI. These patients were able to be treated with hemodialysis the following day and continue to be dialysed through the access 6 to 10 months after therapy. The failure of the treatment in the two patients seem to be related to the delay between the discovery of the fistula 's occlusion and the start of the therapy. We conclude that rt-PA local infusion provides a useful means of preservation of AVF without major complicat ions. the system was explanted due to complications (1 infection , 2 paravasatlon , 1 ulcer, 1 leakage). 6 patients had minor complications: one twisted port was returned manually, one hematoma and one phlebit is were treated with dressing , one patient had a wound dehiscence and one occluded catheter returne d to patency after f1ushing the system with contrast material. Venous thrombos is or catheter dislocat ion did not occur. Conclusion: Fluoroscopie guided peripheral central-venous port implantation is a safe and easy procedure with a high success rate and a low complication rate which can be performed in an outpatient setting .

Ferro; Genoa/l Purpose: to evaluate the results of superior vena cava stenting in treating superior vena cava syndrome secondary to malignancy. Methods and Materials: we evaluated 59 patients with superior vena cava syndrome due to lung tumours (51 cases), metastatic mediastinal masses (5 cases), lymphoma (1 patient) and mesothelioma (2 cases). Preliminary CT and bilateral venography were perfarmed to evaluate site and lenght of the lesion; in 9 patients selective thrombolysis with urokinase was performed due to thrombosis. 49 Gianturco-Rosch self-expendable stent 25-30 mm diameter were implanted with a transfemaral approach; 10 Wallstent (14 mm nominal diameter) were implanted via omeral, femoral or jugular vein. Heparinization was continued for 3 days, followed by oral anticoagulations for 1 week. Results: all the stent were successfully implanted with immediate relief of the symptoms; in one case a second procedure was necessary to overlap another Wallstent after 3 days. In 2 patients an overlap was performed after 2 months. Complications included pulmonary embolism and edema resolved with medical therapy. Conclusion: treatment of superior vena cava syndrome due to malignancy with metallic self-expandable stent is a safe and quick way to relief symptoms with few complications. Methods and Materials: Between August 1994 and July 1998, 46 CVA (Hickman 13.5F) were placed in the IVC via a direct translumbar approach in 46 patients (10 males, 36 females) with a mean age of 39.9 years (10-87 years). The indications were: chemotherapy administration (39), bone marrow transplantation (2) and hemodialisis (5). The reasons far placing the CVA in the IVC were: cosmetic (34), supradiaphragmatic venous thrombosis (10), previous catheter infection (2).",

Purpose: Pelvic varicosities are a less known pathologie condition in multiparous women. The majar symptoms are: low abdominal pain, dyspareunia or postcoi'tal ache, gluteal or thigh varices and emotional disturbanees. A retrospective study was undertaken to evaluate the results of transcatheter embolotherapy of pelvic varicosities. Methods and Materials: From february 1992 until february 1998, 38 embolisation procedures were performed, either with wirecoils or with a mixture of hystoacryl-lipiodol, in 38 patients with phlebographically diagnosed pelvic varicosities. These patients were traced back and submitted to a standardized questionnaire. The data of 25 patients were obtained in this way. Results: The initial success-ratio of the procedure was 80%. with a long-term benefit for mare than 56% of the patients. After embolisation there was a reduction in pain intensity, pain attacks occured less frequently and emotional disturbances were mentioned less often. Globally there was a mean reduction of complaints of 65.3% (Visual Analog Scale). Results were the same for the use of wirecoils or liquid sclerosing agents. Conclusion: Transcatheter embolotherapy is an effective way of treating pelvic varicosities, resulting in a great improvement of the quality of Iife for most of the patients.

Purpose: To evaluate the frequency of brain lesions in asymptomatic patients with milder hemoglobinopathies, and to identify patient at risk for stroke to be treated with Hydroxyurea or transfusional therapy. Methods and Materials: 92 asymptomatic patients affected by Thalassemia Intermedia (TI) and sickle-cell + beta Thalassemia (S/beta-Thai) underwent a whole-brain MR screening. Brain damage (BD) was considered as the association of ischemia and atrophy. Atrophy was graded on personal assessment, while ischemic lesions according to the size. BD grading was related to number of sickle cell crises per year, Hemoglobine (Hb) levels, sickling Hb levels, platelets count, sex and age, using Spearman's test. Results: 37% TI and 52% S/beta-Thal patients had clinically occult BD. BD grade was more severe in S/beta-Thal patients: 24% had small sized lesions, 16% had medium and 12% had very large lesion. BD was inversely correlated to Hb levels in TI patients, proving the disease to be related to chronic hypoxia. BD in S/beta-Thal patients were direclly related to the number of sickle cell crisis per year and inversely related to platelets count, according to microembolism. Conclusion: According to the high incidence of silent BD in patients with milder hemoglobinopathies, MRI screening should be mandatory for therapy planning.",

Carty; Liverpool/UK Purpose: Non-accidental injury is a leading cause of head injury in an infant. The aim of this paper is to compare the role of CT and MR in diagnosis of NAI and to review the role of MR in acute presentation. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively studied 30 patients who presented in the period between 1995 to 1998 and had both CT and MRI.A comparison of the CT and MR findings was done to evaluate their efficacy in detection of intracranial bleed, parenchymal injuries and brain edema. Results: 12 patients had their CT done on the day of admission, 12 on the following day and the remaining 6 within seven days. The time gap between the CT and MRI ranged from 0 to 21 days (average 5 days). CT demonstrated acute subdural haematoma in 23 patients as compared to 22 on MRI. However CT detected 17 acute interhermispheric subdural haematoma while MR showed only 11. MRI was better in deteclion of cerebral convexity haematomata in 15 cases. Subarachnoid haemorrhage was seen on CT in 4 cases as compared to 2 on MR. Brain edema was seen in 10 cases on CT as compared to 3 on MR. Conclusion: In acute situation CT was found to be superior to MRI in demonstrating fractures, interhemispheric subdural, subarachnoid bleeding and brain edema. MRI was superior in acute/subacute cerebral convexity subdural, chronic subdural, white matter shear injuries and brain atrophy. Infarcts were equally weil seen on both. scans.

Purpose: Children with severe periventricular leukomalacia usually present early in Iife as a result of significant motor disabilities. The relationship between visual impairment and established periventricular leukomalacia has been weil documented. We hypothesise that some children with mild cortical visual impairment and mild motor disabilities as a result of previously undiagnosed periventr icular leukomalacia may actually present with strabismus alone. Methods and Materials: Children under investigation for strabismus and visual impairment underwent cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans which revealed unsuspected periventricular leukomalacia. Full developmental and neurological assessments were also performed on each patient. Results: MRI scanning in this group of patients revealed unsuspected pathology in the form of periventricular leukomalacia and neurological assessments confirmed developmental delay permilling an accurate diagnosis. Conclusion: MRI scanning of the brain is a useful investigation in children with strab ismus and mild unexpla ined visual impa irment revealing previously unsuspected and undiagnosed pathology. Purpose: Cerebral activations during stimulation by different word reading tasks were studied by fMRI. The comparison of these activations was used to investigate differences in word prosess ing belween dyslex ic and normal read ing children. Methods and Materials: Eight right handed dyslexie boys (age range from 8-15) and eight matched (age , IQ, SES) norma l reading boys were exam ined in a 1.5T clinical scanner. A T2*-weighted FFE-sequence was used for measurements of three slices (TRfTE/a = 100/50/40\u00b0; slice thickeness = 10 mm; FOV =230 mm, matrix =256 x 256) . The Stimulation was perfomed by visual presentation of words , nonwords and lelterstrings. Words and nonwords have to be read silently. The fourth condition was a rhyming task. For postprocessing the SPM 96 was used . Results: Activat ions were found especi ally bilateral in the frontal corte x for the rhyming task vs. word reading , in the occipital lobe (fusiform gyrus) for word reading vs. nonword reading and in the left temporoparietal lobe as weil as in the left insula for nonword reading vs. letterstrings. Differences between dyslexies and contro ls were especially observed in contrasts with the rhyming condition. Conclusion: The observed differences of activation between dyslexics and normal reading children indicate differences in word processing. By using hierarchically structured tasks more detailed informations about impairments in the word reading process of dyslexics can be obtained .",

            "text": "contrasVnoise ratios the data from the EBT investigation were compared to a similar examination on a spiral-CT. Results: The signal/noise ratio at the EBT was about 50%, con-trasVnoise 25% of that of the Spiral -CT. The absolute values of CBV was calculated to be 4.9 + 1.2 ml/100 9 (EBT) , CBF was 50.5 ml/100 g/min in normal contra lateral tissue. In 4 patients with proven infarcts on follow-up , the ischemic areas had a CBV ranging from 1.7 to 3.8 ml/100 g, CBF ranging from 9.4 to 24.5 ml/100 g/min. Conclusion: Using a bolus inject ion of contrast material , calculation of absolute CBV and CBF is feasable using EBT. The delineation of acute cereb ral ischemia is possible with E\u00dfT, however, the demarcation of ischem ic tissue is Iimited by image noise. Purpose: MR perfusion imaging , examin ing the first pass of a contrast agent bolus through the brain , has been used extensively in stroke patients. We studied a group of patients with carotid stenos is to investigate the value of the technique in assessing the compromised blood supply in these patients. Methods and Materials: 11 palients with carolid stenos is were scanned on a 1.5 T system (GE Signa) . For perfusion imaging , a 10 mm slice was imaged with a T2*-weighted sequence (TR 33/TE 23/\u00dfip 15, 256 x 128, scan time 3 sees). 24-30 images were acquired sequentially after bolus injection of 15 ml GdDOTA. For analysis, images were transferred to an independent workstation. The signal intensity in cortical MCA branches and six arterial territories was measured using in-hause software (Displmage) . All regions were chosen to avoid old infarcts. Results: Results from the perfusion analys is could be divided into lwo broad groups: (a) patients showing a unilateral drop in MCA blood flow and an ipsilateral reduction in tissue blood volume , (b) those show ing a reduced MCA flow on one side with higher ipsilateral tissue blood volume in the MCA territory. The degree of carotid stenos is was compared with these results . In 3 cases the MR perfusion data correlated weil with the relative L-R stenosis, but in most patients there was poor agreement. A possible confounding factor was the presence of bilateral stenosis in several patients. Conclusion: There was no straightforward correlation between carotid stenosis, blood flow in MCA branches and cerebral tissue blood volume . This may reflect the complex interaction between bilateral disease, collateral pathways and autoregulatory vasodilatation. Further studies are needed. Purpose: A variety of evaluation parameters are being used to evaluate MR perfus ion studies. Beside of approxima tions to hemodynamic parameters as CBV, CBF and MIT, maximal signal reduction (MSR) and tlrne-to peak (TP) can be used to charac terize the signal time course . In our study, numerous parameters map were calculated and compared in respect to their difference in information content and image qual ity. Methods and Materials: 30 palients with different vascular diseaseases were examined at a 1.5 whole body system . An EPI sequence was used to acquire 3 selected slices. 96 repetitive measurements were performed . 11 different parameter maps were calculated on a pixel-bypixel base after temporal smooth ing, but without any spatial filtering . Mean values of all parameters in eight regions and all patients were calculated . Results: The differences between relat ive values of between MSR , C\u00dfV and CBF and other parameters were small compared to the variation of parameter values within the datasets. The lowest standard deviat ion of parameter values within the selected regions and therefore best image quality was obtained in MSR-and TP-maps. Conclusion: For the visual assessment of perfusion the use of MSR , SUM and CBF was nearly equivalent. Oue to their superior image quality, MSR and TP are suggested for the visualization of perfusional differences to obtain additional diagnostic information",

Purpose: To evaluate the utility of MR relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) ma ps to measure regional hemodynam ie changes in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and to compare MR-rCBV to PET results . Methods and Materials: Eight patients (26-78 years old, mean age 37) were exam ined on a 1.5 T MR-system, and by 18F-f1uorodesoxyglucose PET. MR-data were acquired by a grad ient echo sequence at 10. f1ip angle using a bolus of 0.2 mmol/kg bodyweight. Regional rCBV were measured by region of interest measurements. Results: Interictally reduced rCBV of the left hippocampus was predicted by rCBV maps in 5 of 8 interictal patients, confirmed by PET in all 5 patients. The mean ratios of regional cerebral blood volume were 1.67 (Ieft hippocampus/white matter) versus 1.97 (right hippocampus/white matter) (p < 0.05 , paired students t-test). Two patients had no side difference and one patient showed reduction on the right side , findings also confirmed by PET. Conclusion: Relative CBV demonstrated persistent local decrease of blood voume in temporal lobe epilepsy. Compared to PET the Mr-rCBV measurement had high aceuracy to detect the side local isation of temporal lobe epilepsia .",

All patients underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI using abilateral breast coil. SMM was performed 10 and 60 min after the I.V. injection of 555 MBq of Tc99m-MIBI. The results of the two techniques were compared and related to the final histhopathological diagnoses . Two independent readers reported the scans using a four point confidence scale (4: malignant; 3: probably malignant; 2 probably benign; 1: benign) . Area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operator characteristics (ROC) were obtained. Results: There were 26 malignant (of these, 8 lesions were below 8 mm in size) and 18 benign lesions. Overall, MRI showed a sensit ivity of 92%, specificity of 78% and accuracy of 86%. SMM showed a sensitivity of 85%",

Three interpreters per method rated indepedenlly the image quality (1 = excellent to 5 = poor) , the presence and degree of arterial stenosis (1 =below 50% up to grade 4 =occlusion) and the detection of accessory renal arteries. In addition, SNR-and CNR-values of both MRA-techniques were measured. Results: CNR and SNR did not differ significantly between all MRAmethods. The better space resolution of CE-MRA did not improve image quality or the estimation of stenotic degree compared to dynamic multiphase CE-MRA. Between both t-MRA techniques (b) showed less overestimation of stenotic degree (3 vs. (a) 7 cases) and missed the same number of accessory vessels (3 of 14 DSA-proved) compared to monophase CE-MRA, but is still inferior to DSA. For dynamic CE-MRA, no previous determination of contrast bolus arrival time is neccessary. Conelusion: Dynamic CE t-MRA takes less time, provides additional flow information and equal diagnostic image quality (b) compared to monophasic CE-MRA-techniques.

Venous Doppler Ultrasound (D-US) was performed within six hours . DHCT phlebography and D-US were correlated using Kappa test. Results: 16 PE (57%) and 19 DVT (67%) were diagnosed at DHCT. Correlation was excellent in deteclion of DVT (Kappa : 1).

Methods and Materials: Between 01/1996 and 01/1998, 39 patients had 4 Doppler ultrasonography including color and energy Doppler before, during and after medieal treatment. Color and energy Doppler were performed using ATL APOGEE 800 (Probe 5-11 MHz), and size of tumor, numbers of vessels, mean systolie velocity (MSV) and resistive index (RI) were reeorded and eompared with c1inieal examination, mammography and histology. Results: Before treatment, patients had 39 c1inieal masses from 30 to 70 mm. Ultrasonography revealed 42 hypoeeho'ie lesions from 10 to 38 mm. Both Color and energy Doppler showed vessels within and around the tumor (n =40), MSV 4-67 em/s and RI 0.50-0.92. After treatment, 35 patients had 35 elinieal masses from 6 to 60 mm. Ultrasonography revealed 34 hypoeeho'ie lesions from 6 to 35 mm. Although color Doppler and Doppler energy showed vessels within and around tumor in 35 lesions, the MSV and RI were identieal to examination before treatment. Conclusion: Both color doppler and doppler energy did not afford informations eompared to elinieal examination and morphologie ultrasonography in assessing breast tumor response to medieal treatment. 11:20 347 Breast tumor diagnosis using sound-lnduced tissue vibration in sonography 1.

Karantanas, AH. Zibis, N. Papanikolaou; LarissalGR 10:55 Purpose: To compare a three-dimensional (3D) multi-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with fat-suppression (FS) with two widely used sequences, the fat-suppressed gradinet echo (GRE-FS) and the protondensity weighted (PD) turbo spin-echo (TSE) in imaging the menisci of the knee. Methods and Materials: 60 patients (16-82 y) were studied. The menisci were imaged in the sagittal plane with a) 3D-EPI-FS (TRlTE/a: 55 ms/12 ms/45 0,4 min 9 s), b) GRE-FS (TRlTE/a: 650 ms/20 ms/35 0, 6 min 15 s), and c) PD-TSE (TRlTE:3310 ms/22 ms, 5 m in 24 s) sequences using a 1T MR scanner with 15 mT/m gradients. The signal to noise ratio (SNR) of bone (b), cartilage (c), and meniscus(m), contrast to noise ratio (CNR) and relative contrast (ReCon) between menisci and cartilage and between bone and cartilage were measured. A qualitative analysis was performed on grading meniscal pathology (O-IV). The imaging accuracy of meniscal pathology was assessed compared to arthroscopy in 13 patients. Results: The 3D-EPI-FS provided the highest SNR in cartilage and meniscus, the highest CNR and the highest ReCon between bone and cartilage. MR grading of meniscal abnormalities showed overestimation compared to GRE-FS and PD-TSE. Conclusion: The 3D-EPI-FS could not be included in the routine protocol in imaging the menisci since the overestimation of meniscal abnormalities could lead to unnessessary arthroscopies.",

Methods and Materials: A prospective study of conseculive patients with a diagnosis of eclampsia admitted over a 9 month period was performed. Patient's neurological status was graded. Fast spine echo T2, 20 time of f1ight MR Angiography and diffusion weighted scans (Bo 1000) were performed within 24 hrs of admission and if positive were rescanned within 5 days. Results: 27 patients were studied. 20 patients had T2 hyperintensities while 7 had normal T2 scans. 24 patients had restricted diffusion. Commonest sites: basal ganglia and centrum semiovale in 14, subcorlical occipital poles in 10. Restricted diffusion resolved partially or completely in 22 patients on follow up at 3 days (2-5 days) while in the other 2 patients focal infarction developed. 26 patients had MRA studies: 15 were normal, 7 had diffuse narrowing, 4 focal narrowing. Conclusion: Restricted diffusion is commonly detected in patients with eclampsia, but is transien!, returning to normal within 5 days post admission. Restricted diffusion is due to vasogenic oedema possibly on the basis of a hyperperfusion injury.

Fiedler;KrefeldlDPurpose: To evaluate the morphologic changes of cervical spine disease with functional imaging in a vertically open MRI system. Methods and Materials: To obtain functional studies of the cervical spine in upright position, achair with positioning device was developed to guide the spine through extension and flexion movement. It helps to pravide accurate and repraducible studies in erect position in axial loading. Flexible surface coils were fixed to the patients neck. All 14 studies were performed on a low field dedicated MRI system with vertically open configuration. T1 and T2 weighted FSE sequences were used in sagittal plane. High-field MRI exams were performed additionaly, evaluated and correlated to functional low-field MRI (FMRI). Results: In all patients the clinical question was answered and in 4 (28%) additional informations were identified. In one patient observations from the low field unit changed the therapeutic management. FMRI allows imaging of the cervical spine during extension and flexion in axial loading, which is not possible in conventional MR imagers. Conclusion: Functional cervical MRI in upright position may be useful in patients with disc herniation, spinal canal stenosis, instability after whiplash injury, rheumatoid arthritis and in postoperative situations. The relationship of spinal cord to bony and Iigamentous structures and intermittent stenosis during extension and flexion are weil depicted.

Methods and Materials: Thirty consecut ive patients were included in this study if they had persistent low back pain and standard MR images demonstrating disk abnormalities without compression of neural structures. Positional MR images were obtained in an open configuration 0.5 T MR imager in upright flexion and extension. Cross-sectional areas of the dural sac , disk abnormalites, relat ionship with nerve root and foram inal size were assessed with regard to position dependent changes. The morphological changes were correlated with the patien t's pain using a visual analogue scale . Results: A stat istially significant decrease of the mean cross-sectional area of dural sac was found between the supine neutral and the upright extended position and the upright f1exed and upr ight extended position , respectively. The relationship between nerve roots and disk as weil as foraminal slze more commonly chang ed with different positions than disk disease classification. In no patient nerve root compression was provoked during positional imaging . Positional pain score differences were related to position. Conclusion: Positional MRI demonstrates sublle morphological changes which relate to position-dependent pain.

Georgi ; MannheimlD Purpose: Stabilizing surgery of thoraco -Iumbar vertebral fractures often shows a loss off angular correction after several years. We evaluate vitality of surgical transplanted spong iosa in thoraco-Iumbar vertebra fractures using contrast-enhanced MRI. Methods and Materials: MR-exams were performed in 22 patients (14 rn, 8 f, median 45 years old, range 22-66 years) with singular non-stable vertebral fracture (L1 n = 13, L2 n = 3, L3 n = 3, L5 n = 1 and T12 n = 2) on the average 3.5 years after injury on a 1T System (SIEMENS, Harmony) using spine array coil and an external reference. T1-weighted TSE-images (TR =587 ms, TE =12 ms) before and after admin istrat ion of Gd-DTPA were acquired in sagittal and transversal sections . Results: In 20 patients a spong iosa transplant could be idenlified. Quanlilalive analysis of signal increase in healthy vertebra was 27 .6%, in spongiosa Iransplant56.9%. Only 1 patient showed a signalreduction (19%) in heallhy vertebra. Qualitative image analysis showed only 2 patients with distinct signal incease in the spongiosa. Conclusion: Surgeons hypothes ize an aseptic necrosis of spong iosa transplantto explain the loss of angular correclion . Dur resulls clearly demonstrate vital tissue at the place of former spongiosa, however, of unknown histology. The tissu e is not able to contribute to a stabilization.

Results: Pathological findings and normal variations were seen in 14% and 5% respectively. Subtle inner ear structures (spiral ganglion with modiolus, spiral lamina , ampullary chrests, maculae) could be recognized in 70 to 100%. Regularly, pulsatile and liquor flow artefacts were found. They influenced the detection of inner ear structures in 7% . Conclusion: CISS imaging is of high value in visualization of normal inner ear structures. If it is available , it should be the sequence of first choice in cochlear implant candidates, in patients with suspected malformations of the inner ear and with suspected acoustic neurinomas .

The development of MRI and MRA during the last years was marked by the introduction of ultrafast sequences with or without contrast medium. Most of the examinations can be done in breathhold technique in less than thirty seconds. For MRA of the thoracic vessels most often time-of-flight techniques are applied. Phase contrast sequences should be used, if blood flow measurements are requested. The additional use of paramagnetic contrast medium can improve the signal to noise ratio and the imaging quality especially in small vessels. As a new imaging technique time resolved contrast enhanced ultrafast sequences are now available which allow the imaging of the thoracic and pulmonary arteries in 3-5 seconds. One of the limitations of the time resolved sequences is a lower spatial resolution. A primary indication for MRI and MRA are all diseases of the thoracic aorta, especially aneurysms and dissections. Combined with the morphological imaging a blood flow measurement is possible. For the pulmonary arteries the use of MRI is still limited to special diseases like anomalies of the pulmonary arteries and vascular malformations. Diseases of the mediastinal veins can be imaged very exactly using MRI with and without contrast medium or MRA. One of the Iimitations however is inconstant and slow flow. Conclusion: MRI and MRA are the method of choice for the evaluation of diseases of the thoracic aorta and in some diseases also for the pulmonary arteries. Especially MRA can provide functional data in thoracic aneurysms and stenoses. Invasive examinations should only be done if MRI or MRA is not able to establish the correct diagnosis. in computer assisted surgeryChairperson: O.

Methods and Materials: 37 patients with distal occlusive carcinomas (cancers that cannot be passed endoscopically) were referred for preoperative virtual colonoscopy. Virtual colonoscopy was performed according to a standard protocol using full bowel preparation, air distension, smooth muscle relaxants, supine and prone acquisitions, 5 mm collimation, 2 mm index, 110 mA, and 110 kVp. Results of virtual co-lonoscopy were compared with pre-operative endoscopy, intraoperative findings, pathology, post-operative barium enema and/or colonoscopy where possible. Results: Virtual colonoscopy demonstrated all 37 index cancers, and 26 polyps and 2 synchronous cancers in the proximal colon. Both synchronous cancers were confirmed intraoperatively and resected. 18 of 26 findings of polyps have been confirmed at postoperative barium enema and/or colonoscopy. Results of follow-up studies are pending in seven patients. To date, there have been no false positive findings in the proximal colon on virtual colonoscopy. Conclusion: Virtual colonoscopy is a safe and accurate method of evaluating the colon proximal to occlusive cancers. By detecting synchronous cancers and polyps, virtual colonoscopy directs appropriate surgical management and helps identify patients requiring early postoperative endoscopy.

Peitgen; Bremen/D Purpose: Show the feasibility of lossless and lossy wavelet compression for archiving and transmitting radiological images with the example of digital mammograms. Methods and Materials: The wavelet methods SPIHT and MT-WICE are applied to the Nijmegen database of 40 digitized mammograms with mierocalcifications. For archiving, lossless compression is used. The feasibility of lossy compression is evaluated using the FROC performance of astate of the art algorithm for detection of microcalcification clusters. Results: Lossless compression of the Nijmegen database results in areduction of the file size by a factor of 7.78 (MT-WICE) and 6.84 (SPIHT) respectively. For lossy compression with factors 8, 12, and 16 MT-WICE performs consistently better than SPIHT in terms of FROC. A compression factor near 12 leads to an improvement of the FROC compared to the original data. For factors larger than 16, FROC starts to degrade with better performance of MT-WICE for FP values less than 1. Compression time of SPIHT is larger than that of MT-WICE by a factor of about 1.6. Conelusion: Wavelet compression can be used both for losslessly archiving mammograms and for lossy transmission at higher compression factors without significantly affecting their diagnostic value.

Results: All 9 stenosis were correctly identified on 3D images and their anatomicallocations correctly assessed on 20 reconstructions. Artifacts were met when patients were unable to suspend their breath, leading to one false positive result. Limitations of this technique relate to the maximal spatial resolution which is 1.5 mm and the lack of color.

The sequences were used on in-vitro, ex-vivo and in-vivo I-MRI guided procedures; images were evaluated for SNR, acquisition time and appearance of the needle. Results: The F-GEPR sequence with the two fluoroscopic acqulsltlon strategies had an acquisition time of about 900 ms and SNR of about 30. The needle was better defined in the interleaved acquisition than in the continuous mode. Conclusion: The imaging results show that both the F-GEPR strategies are attractive for passive tracking in interventional MRI because of very short acquisition times and attainment of SNR's comparable to 20FT fast sequences.11:05717 Tissue ablation with MR-guided focused ultrasound: automatie control of volume of necrosis in rats J. Palussiere, F. Vimeux, J. de Zwart, R. Fawaz, B. Le Bai!, P. Canioni, N. Grenier, C. Moonen; Bordeaux/F Purpose: To develop an automatie control of the volume of necrosis based on real time' temperature mapping and correlate this theoretical model to histopathologie data in rats. Methods and Materials: A 4.7T animal MRI system and a 1.45 Mhz transducter with a fixed focus (25 mm) were used. MR-temperature mapping was performed based on temperature dependency of the proton chemical shift. Focused ultrasound power was automaticaly adjusted in real time based on temperature mapping. Volume of necrosis was estimated based on power and time of sonication and updated every second. Twenty-four rats were treated on thigh muscles and volume of necrosis was determined by histopathology 24 h after experiment. The last ten rats were also imaged at 1.5T with T1-and T2-weighted sequences and after infusion of gadolinium at various time periods after sonication. Results: Real time control of temperature had a 0.2\u00b0accuracy. The real time control of sonication based on MR-temperature measurements was possible in all cases. The lesions were weil identified at 1.5T. The correlation between theoretical volume of lesions and volume measured at 1.5T and at histopathology will be presented. Conclusion: Coupling of MR-temperature mapping and focused ultrasounds allows to estimate the volume of necrosis in tissue ablation.11:15 718 MR-guided drainage of abdominal fluid collections A.

Reimer; M\u00fcnsteriDPurpose: To compare enhancement with Gd-mesoporphyrin (Gd-MP) versus high-dose Gd-DTPA for tissue necrosis after laser induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT). Methods and Materials: LITT was performed on the gluteal and femoral museie of female New Zealand white rabbits (3100 g, n = 12). Each animal underwent 2 LITT sessions with an Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm, 5 mm applicator) at 5 J/s for 5 or 7 min respectively (n = 24 lesions total). Dynamic MR studies were performed after iv.-injection of 0.3 mmol/kg/bw Gd-DTPA (group 1, n =6) or 50 urnol/kq bw Gd-MP (group 2, n =6) resp. with 2D FLASH. Follow-up MR-studies were performed every 30 min until 6 hours after contrast application with T1w SE. Central and peripherallesion enhancement were calculated for each image and lesion sizes were determined in dynamic 2D-FLASH and follow-up SE-sequences. Results: During dynamic MR-studies peripherallesion enhancement was about 3-fold higher after Gd-DTPA application compared to Gd-MP (p < 0.0001). In both groups, rim enhancement gradually increased during the first 000 hours of the follow-up period and persisted on a high level (>100%) until6 h after LITT with no significant difference betweengroup 1 and 2.

Rollo, A. Pedicelli, M. Salcuni; Rome// Purpose: The inadequancy of acoustic signals in TCCS can explain why it is becoming a general practice to use ecographic contrast media thanks to their ability of increasing the acoustic signals to obtein the visualizzation of a greater number of vascular structures and their better definition. Methods and Materials: We have performed TCCS on 20 patients affected by carotid stenosis, cerebral arteriovenous malformations, arterial spasm due to ESA. Quantitative, qualitative doppler parameters have been investigate for each patient in basal condition and then repeated after the injection of Levovist 300 mg/I, recording even the signal enhancement time. Results: The signal enhancement time for a single dose (270-440 sec), was long enough to investigate the flow direction in the vessels belonging to the circle of Willis and its validity, assess the morphology and the direction of flows in cerebral aneurysm, outline the vascular structures forming a MAV and study low-flow vascular structures. Conclusion: The advantages of Levovist are certainly numerous but its use is limited by the high price, by the few successfull application in cases of MAV because of the distortion of the signal amplified and the poor definition of the vessels of the circle of Willis and the posterior cirele in their wholeness. 10:35 725 The role of Levovist\u2122 in the assessment of hepatic arterial complications following Iiver transplantation S.M.

Nominal and effective tube current values were compared after CT-examination and image quality was evaluated by 5 independent radiologists. Results: The on-line adaptive dose modulation lead to dose savings of 0% to 51% depending on the anatomical region examined with a mean dose reduction of 24%. Due to the limitation of maximal tube current no increase in patient dose was observed. The evaluation of the spiral-CT images showed no significant decrease in image quality. Conclusion: The on-line adaptive dose modulation CAR.E-Dose optimally exploits the asymmetry of anatomical regions for considerable dose savings of up to 51% without compromising image quality. -dose reduction without loss of diagnostic quality by means of patient size computation from single scanograms A.

After 4 baseline measurements and a bolus injection of 15 !lmol/kg USPIO 15 further multislice measurements of the liver were done. A real-time interface generates functional maps that contain combined information of blood pool values and elimination characteristics. Results: Angiosarcomas showed a 300% higher blood pool value than liver and a faster elimination. HCC showed a lower blood pool value than liver and a slow elimination or an ongoing uptake during measurement time. Using this knowledge, an adequate lesion characterization can be done in real-time, especially to discuss suspect lesions.Conclusion: Blood pool maps often exhibit non-expected behaviour of alesion and yield new implications.

Patients underwent a routine MRI-protocoll including T2-and T1-W-SE and T1 W GE sequences pre and 1 hour post 0.1 mmol/kg Multihance\u00ae (CM) (Bracco-Byk; Konstanz, Germany). Additionlly aserial T1W GE scan was performed with the first half of the dose. All patients underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced C'T, The evaluation was performed with regard to the number and size of lesion detected per patient in each modality or sequence. Furthermore, the pre CM and pre + post CM image sets were analysed for lesions per patient. Results: Both readers detected significantly more lesion in the contrastenhanced image set (32% and 39%; p < 0.0001). While contrastenhanced CT detected the same number of lesion as unenhanced MRI, it was c1early inferior in lesion detection to contrast-enhanced MRI (Reader 1: p = 0.0117 + reader 2: p = 0.0225). Of the T1W scans performed, the dynamic and late T1W GE exams contributed most to the increased lesion detection rate (p = 0.0007 + P = 0.0037). The size of the smallest lesion detected by means of MRI was sigificantly lower in the pre CM image sets than in the pre + post CM image sets (p = 0.001 + P < 0.0001). Contrast-enhanced MRI reavealed after application of Multihance\u00ae significantly smaller lesion than contrast-enhanced CT (p =0.0117 + P =0.0925).",

New diagnostic standard in preoperative diagnostic imaging of Iiver tumors C. Poeckler-Schoeniger, J. Sturm, V. Ihle , M. Georgi; MannheimlD Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy of MRI and 3D-MRA in preoperative stag ing of liver tumors in correlation to intraoperative and histological results. Methods and Materials: In 50 Patients with focalliver lesions axial and coronal MR sequences unenhanced and contrast-enhanced (T1w-Flash 20, T2w-TSE , EPI-IRM, TRUE FISP) as weil as dual phase coronal ultrafast MRA were performed. Techn ical parameters of MRA were as folIows : TRITE =3.8/1.4 ms, FA 300 , 80 partitions, matrix 128 x 256, aquisition time 18 sec.Results: In 41/50 patients Iiver resection was performed. Correct prediction of segmental localisation in MRI in 96% . Histology was correct in 38/41 patients (92%), predicted dignity was correct in all cases . Evaluation of hepatic vascular structures for resectability of liver lesions was correct in all patients, infiltration of vessel wall in absence of a tumor thrombus could not be c1early identified. By use of multiplanar reconstruction and single image view of the 3D-data base add itional informations could be obtained in 21 patients . Conclusion: Dual-phase 3D-MRA and MRI give accurate information on local isat ion of focal lesions and their relationship to important intrahepatic vessels, especially on prese ntation of portal venous structures.

Of these, 27 patients also had MRI (interpreted by another radiologist) whose results were correlated separately with arthroscopy. Results for the detection of both full-thickness tears (FTT) and partial-thickness tears (PTT) were derived.Results: In comparison with shoulder arthroscopy, Ultrasound correlation for FTT resulted in Sens = 100%, Spec = 94%, PPV = 90% and NPV = 100%. For PTT, the results were: Sens = 100%, Spec = 78%, PPV = 83% and NPV = 100%. The presence of a large caleification resulted in one false-positive for FTT. In the subset of 27 patients who also had MRI, ultrasound vs. arthroscopy evaluation for FTT yielded: Sens = Spec = PPV = NPV = 100%; whereas with MRI vs. arthroscopy: Sens = 33%, Spec = 91%, PPV =67% and NPV =70%. For PTT, ultrasound values were: Sens = 100%, Spec = 86%, PPV = 83%, NPV = 100%; whereas MRI values were: Sens = 40%, Spec = 83%, PPV = 67%, NPV = 63%. Conclusion: Ultrasound is superior to MRI in rotator cuff evaluation and should be considered the new diagnostic imaging standard.

Methods and Materials: Transvaginal sonohysterography was performed in 43 patients (aged 32-47 years) in whom conventional transvaginal sonography suggested intrauterine abnormalities either by endometrial thicken ing or abnormal morphology. In all cases the examination was performed by placing a small catheter into the endometrial canal and injection of 5-10 cc of saline solut ion under sonographic visualization. Results: Transvaginal sonohysterography depicted endometrial poly ps (n =10), intracavitary fibro ids (n =13), endometrial thickening (n =8),carcinoma (n =1), and normal cavities (n =11). All patients underwent diagnostic hysteroscopy and in 1 case hysterectomy was performed. All findings diagnosed with transvaginal sonohysterography corresponded to the results observed with hysteroscopy and hysterectomy. No complications occurred. Conclusion: Transvaginal sonohysterography using saline solutlon injected is a low-cost, easy and very sensitive procedure in the assessment of the uterine cavity, and we believe it should be the primary examination in evaluating patients with fertility problems.11:40 889 MR patterns of ovarian fibromas A La Fianza , E.

Barlolini; Genoa/lPurpose: Current treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC) includes radiation therapy (RT) alone or combined to chemotherapy and/or neck dissection . To evaluate the CT and MR appearance of NPC treated with RT and the ability of CT and MRI to differentiate pers istent or residual tumor from radio-induced changes of soft and bone tissues. Methods and Materials: Pre-and post-treatment CT (n=52) and MRI (n=45) examinations of 28 patients with primary NPC treated with RT (6000-7500 cGy) were retrospectively evaluated. Results: We subdivide the patients in three groups on the basis of the differences in the CT and MRI appearance of the primary tumors treated with RT: Responders (9): Complete resolution of tumor or redu ction in tumor size = or >75 %; Non-Responders (8): Persistent tumor or residual mass with reduct ion in tumor size = or <50%; Partially Responders (11) Persistent residua l mass with reduclion in tumor size from 50% to 75% or persistent asimmetry of the mucosal surface.Conclusion: There are some points to analyze in the interpretation of CT and MRI of post-treated NPC : Transient changes of irradiated soft tissues contrast enhance and may induce false positive . Persistent changes are subgrouped in: 1. Soft tissue changes: a. Glandular: major salivary glands adenitis and fatty degeneration ; b. Deep: fibros is of retro-and parapharyngeal spaces ; c. Visceral: retract ion of pharyngeal wall and distortion of Rosenmuller's recess ; d. Nervous: temporal radionecrosis. 2. Bone tissue changes: Sphenoid bone sclerosis. 3. Sinusal changes: Sphenoid sinusitis .

Lewin; Cleveland, OH/USAPurpose: lt was the purpose of this work to combine laparoscopic procedures with MR imaging to allow the localization and guidance of the endoscope to the target region. Methods and Materials: An open MR scanner and two MR compatible endoscope systems were used to perform the experiments. Three approaches to guide the endoscopes were developed and compared: 1) An active localization and guidance system allowing computation of the position of the tip of the tool and its predicted path towards the target, 2) Gd-DTPA filled trocars to be visualized with standard MR imaging, 3) endoscopes coated with Gd-DTPA and copper coils mounted near their tip to be used as receive coils for an active tip-tracking system. During the animal experiments the gallbladder was targeted and punctured. Results: There were no limitations to simultaneous use of the endoscopic equipment in an MRI environment. All three guidance systems were capable of showing the location of the endoscopes within the inflated abdomen and were helpful in guiding the endoscope towards the target. Conclusion: The combination of both clincially useful imaging techniques enabled the physician to analyze the high-resolution endoscopic image in conjunction with the \"big picture\" created by MRI.11:15 906 MR image-guided percutaneous sclerotherapy of low-flow vascular malformations in the head and neck: safety and feasibility J.S. Lewin, E.M. Merkle, J.L. Duerk, R.W.

A 22g MR-compatible needle was advanced into the targeted vascular malformation component under direct continuous MR imaging guidance. Between 4 and 10 ml of sclerosing agent mixed with dilute contrast was injected under continuous gradient echo MR image monitoring. Clinically and MR imaging follow-up ranged from four to 17 weeks. Results: Successful needle placement and MR image-monitored sclerosing agent injection was accomplished in all cases without complication, and all targeted vascular malformation compartments were filled with sclerosing agent with a mean interventional procedure time of 29 minutes. Follow-up images and c1inical examination demonstrated reduction in size of the treated portions of the malformation in all patients. Two patients reported an improvement in chewing and one reported a complete cessation of previous nightly oral hemorrhage. Conclusion: MR image-guided percutaneous sclerotherapy of lowflow vascular malformations in the head and neck is feasible, can be performed safely, and allows monitoring of injection of both superficial and deep vascular components. 11:20 907 Evaluation of percutaneous MRI-guided abdominal biopsy in a closed magnet using the pig as a model R.F.

Methods and Materials: A total of six MR-guided percutaneous nephrostomies of the non-dilated upper urinary tract were performed in four domestic farm pigs (20-25 kg BW) using a 0.2 T system. Ten minutes following IV administration of 0.2 mmol/kg gadodiamide and 004 mg/kg furosemide, a T1-weighted fast biopsy sequence was used to guide insertion of a 18G MR-compatible needle into a predetermined calyx. After needle position confirmation using a TSE T1-weighted sequence, a .035 inch glidewire coated with superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) was inserted under MR monitoring. This was followed by tract dilation and insertion of a modified 4F sheath. Final sheath position was confirmed by injection of diluted SPIO into the collecting system. Results: Needle insertion was successful in all six procedures without any complications with an instrumentation time ranging from 4 to 13 minutes (6 \u00b1 4 minutes).

The value of dynamic contrast enhanced MRI and MRA is discussed. Methods and Materials: For morphological analysis, HASTE, spin echo, and turbo spin echo sequences were used. To define the separation line, dynamic scanning was done with FLASH 20 sequences after application of Gd-DTPA to only one twin of each set. MRA was performed with FLASH 20 and FISP 3D time of f1ight sequences. Results: The first set of twins showed conjoined structures including diaphragm and Iiver. Dynamic imaging clearly demonstrated the separation line between unified Iivers. The time delay of nearly 4 minutes until the contrast agent was seen in the other twin, gives a good estimation of the degree of cross circulation. In the second set of twins MRI showed a small fibrous connection between the sacral bones and a muscular bridge involving the internal obturatorius and levator ani muscle. MRA demonstrated a branch of the internal iliac artery crossing the midline and leading to the other twin.

Methods and Materials: 11 children (3-11 years) with clin ical proven CRP were examined in a 1.5 T MR-Un it. Pre-and post-contrast T1and T2-weighted, axial and coronal sequences were performed. Images were evaluated by two experienced neuroradiologists. Results: In the acute phase of inflammation both parotid glands are swollen, T2-hyperintense with marked contrast-enhancement. Multiple intraparotideal Iymphnodes are seen . In the chronic phase the parotid glands are atrophie, T2-hypointense, non-enhancing and presents with multiple T2-hyperintense cysts within the glands. In addition the parotid ducts are enlarged. Conclusion: MR I allows differentiation between acute and ehren ie inflammation in CRP. Compared to ultrasound (compression of the parotid duct by the US-sonde) and sialography (dilatation of the paro tid duct by contrast-injection), MRI does not alter the anatomy of parotid duct and therefore allows a preci se evaluation of parotid duct ectasia.(Submitted by Internet) 11:05 916 Atlanto-axial rotatory subluxation C.

Methods and Materials: 11 children with serious community-acquired pneumonia, 5 boys and 6 girls, aged 1-10 years, were evaluated by ehest X-ray and ultrasonography. The severity of pneumonia was established on basis of c1inical and radiological criteria. Parenchyma consolidation, air and fluid bronchogram, vascular perfusion, areas of necrosis and pleural effusion was sonographycally evaluated using power Doppler. Results: Power Doppler showed parenchymal perfusion in 3 patients and abscence of perfusion in 8 patients. In 4 patients, with non-perfused pneumonia, parenchymal hyperechoic and hypoechoic focal areas were detected. These features were associated with increased frequency of cavitary necrosis at follow-up. Pleural effusion seen in 4 infants was always associated with cavitary necrosis. The mean length of hospital stay was 5 days in perfused pneumonia, 8 days in non-perfused pneumonia and 25 days in non-perfused pneumonia with necrotic areas.Conclusion: Ultrasonography bring us eomplementary information respect ehest X-ray.

Passariello; RomeIl Purpose: To evaluate in vitro the possibility to develop target specific contrast media for Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging, using reeombinant human antibody fragments. Methods and Materials: Human recombinant anti-Herpes simplex antibody fragments (rFab) were linked in vitro to Gd-DTPA in several chemical conditions and molar ratios. The residual immunospecificity of the labeled rFab was assessed by ELiSA and immunofluorescence microscopy. MR Imaging was performed on a 1.0 T magnet, using standard T1w. SE sequences. Signal intensity (SI) measurements were performed on labeled and non labeled rFab. The imaging potential of the labeled rFab was assessed on 10 6 epithelial cells infeeted by herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1, as compared to non infected cells. Results: Gd-DTPA was efficiently and stably linked to human rFab, without loss in immunospecificity up to a molar ratio of 25:1 (Gd-DTPA:rFab). A significant SI inerease was obtained in labeled as eompared to non labeled rFab. Labeled rFab yielded a significant SI increase of cell suspensions infected by HSV1 as compared to non infected cells. Conclusion: Labeling human antibody fragments with Gd-DTPA is possible. rFab-Gd-DTPA could prove an interesting target specifie contrast agent, not showing moreover compatibility problems and providing a more favourable pharmacokineties as compared to the extensively used murine Mabs. 10:40 923 Mn\u00b7DPDP as a new contrast agent for MR imaging of the adrenal gland J.

Methods and Materials: 737 patients with known or suspected focal Iiver lesions were enrolled in Phase 11 and 111 clinical trials. Phase 11 studies were performed to assess Gd-BOPTA efficacy for the detection and delineation of focal lesions on T1-WSE/GE images acquired up S210 to 180 min post-dose and, subsequently, to compare delayed (40-80 and 90-120 min) imaging results with gold standard findings. Phase 111 studies looked at delayed imaging at 60-120 min with 0.1 mmollkg Gd-BOPTA and immediate post-dose dynamic imaging with an 0.05 mmollkg bolus. Results: A significantly higher number of lesions were detected on delayed images in 33-38% and 26-27% of Phase 11 patients administered 0.05 and 0.1 mmollkg Gd-BOPTA, respectively. Overall, an 0.05 mmollkg dose enabled the detection of 72% of lesions detected by gold standard, compared with an unenhanced finding of 59%. Phase 111 results additionally showed that 0.05 mmol/kg Gd-BOPTA combined with bolus dynamic imaging provided additional information in terms of lesion characterisation in up to 43% of patients and effected patient management in up to 23% of patient studies. Conclusion: Gd-BOPTA is an effective contrast agent for both dynamic and delayed MR imaging of the liver.11:20 927 Angiogenesis of wound healing: assessment with contrast-enhanced MRI Th.

Brasch; Vienna/APurpose: Ta quantitatively assess the time course of microvascular permeability and fraclianal plasma volume (fPV) , representalives of angiogenesis, in wound healing. Methods and Materials: Wound healing was induced by implanting two \"Hunt-Schilling wound cylinders\" (internal diameter 8 rnrn, length 2.5 cm) in each of six rats. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI was performed using a macromolecular contrast agent (albumin-(Gad-DTPA) 30) immediately after implantation (day 0), and at days 1, 4, 9, and 22 post implantation. Permeability surface area product, as estimated by corresponding endothelial transfer coefficient (Kph), and fPV were calculated for each cylinder using a two-compartment bi-directional kinelic model. MRI rnicrovascular characteristics were correlated with histopathology (vessel count) of the wound. Results: Microvascular permeability of the wound, characterized by Kps, increased significantly from day 0 (Kps = 0 ml min-1 100 cc-1 tissue) 10 day 9 (Kps = 0.05 ml min-1 100 cc-1 tissue; p < .01) and remained constant through day 22 (Kps = 0.05 ml min-1 100 cc-1 tissue). The fPV increased progressively with time (day 0, fPV = 0.01 ml cc-1 tissue; day 22, fPV = 0.07 ml cc-1 tissue). Both, Kps and fPV correlated closely with vessel counts of the wounds, Conclusion: Contrast-enhanced MRI is able to assess quantitatively changes of wound healing angiogenesis. Thus, MRI may offer a quantltative assay for the wound healing process and may be used to monitor treatment response.11:30 928 Assessing irradiation induced bone marrow alterations with contrast enhanced MRI: comparison of Carboxymethyldextran-Gd-DOTA and gadopentetate dimeglumine H.E.

We sought to evaluate the influence of Gd-DTPA in different concentrations on the reliability of PG MR velocimetry. Methods and Materials: In a validated arterial model with a defined concentric stenosis and calibrated flow velocity, increasing concentrations of Gd-DTPA (MagnevisjTM, Schering) were administered. PG MR velocimetry was obtained using a 1.0 T Magnetom Expert\u2122 (Siemens) with a manufacturer provided software (Flash2D-sequence TRITE/FA 200 ms/6 ms/300). Measurements were obtained simultaneously pre-, intra-and poststenotic. The area of stenosis was calculated using the ratio of pre-and intrastenotic flow velocities. Results: There was no statistically significant influence of the Gd-DTPA concentration on the reliability of PG MR velocimetry. The results of the calculation of the area of stenosis showed only small variance (72.1 -75.5 \u00b1 0.9%). Conclusion: In vitro Gd-DTPA had no significant impact on PG MR velocimetry. Therefore PG MR velocimetry can be acquired at any time in respect to Gd-DTPA application for contrast enhanced angiography. 10:30 931 Cerebral aneurysms: a comparlson of MR angiography and digital subtraction anglography Z.

Results: Spiral CT examination was suboptimal in 10 patients (3%), negative in 217 patients (58%), positive in 104 patients (28%) and indeterminate in 39 patients (11%). In the 360 spiral CT scans coded as interpretable, the percentage of the analyzable central, segmental and subsegmental arterial bed was 98%, 87% and 59%, respectively. Whereas no significant difference was found between the two groups at the level of central and segmental pulmonary arteries, a significantly higher percentage of analyzable subsegmental arteries was found in Group 1 (65% vs 43%; P < 0.001). Isolated segmental and/or subsegmental clots were identified in 29 patients (8%) (Group 1: n =24; Group 2: n = 5), 24 of them presenting with a prior history of cardiopulmonary disease.

Baird; Bristol/UKPurpose: Several reports have noted the success of vibrational angioplasty or activated guidewire technology as a method of traversing chronic arterial occlusions in the circulatory circulation. Methods and Materials: Two patients with peripheral disease have been treated using this method. In both cases conventianal endovascular techniques failed. The occlusions were traversed using conventional wires in combination with vibration apparatus designed to follow the pathway of least resistance and the wire remain intraluminal. The first patient, a 74 year old female had chronic arterial disease presenting with a painful ulcer over the lateral malleolus. Angiography indicated a 5-6 cm occlusion in the common peroneal trunk. The POLAR device was used and the lesion successfully angioplastied. Follow-up angiography at 3 months confirmed patency. The second patient, a 65 year old male presented with progressive severe thigh c1audication. Angiography indicated a 10-12 cm occlusion of the right external iliac and common femoral arteries. The POLAR device was used the lesion was successfully angioplastied and a stent placed. Conclusion: The POLAR device is a new and useful method of endovascular treatment of chronic peripheral arterial occlusions.(Submitted by Internet) 14:05 1033 Application of carbon dioxide gas in vascular interventions W. Kellner, F.J. Rink, E. Coppenrath, K. Hahn; Munich/D Purpose: To determine the value of carbon dioxide DSA in interventional procedures in patients with contraindications to iodinated contrast medium (ICM). Methods and Materials: 17 patients with peripheral vascular disease (PVD) underwent vascular interventions. Contraindication to ICM was a contrast agent-related hypersensitivity in 4 patients and compensated renal insufficiency in 13. Balloon dilatation was performed in 12 cases and stent placement in 5. Lesions were located in iliac (6), femoral (6) and popliteal (3) arteries. All interventions were done on a Siemens vascular imager (MULTISTAR TOP). CO 2 application was done with apressure -and volume controlled injector (lnspect 2005, TRIGON-MTS, Moenchengladbach, Germany). During dilatation the balloon was filled with pure Gd-DTPA contrast medium in all patients. Beside C02 angiography the results of interventions were controlled with intraarterial pressure measurement.Results: Technical success (residual stenosis <30% and a postinterventional mean resting gradient <10 mm Hg) was achieved in all cases. 13 of 17 patients had a positive c1inical benefit with improvement of their PVD stage according to the Fontaine c1assification. Conclusion: The use of CO 2 can accurately image the PTA or stenting of a critical arterial lesion and permits endovascular interventions in patients with contraindications to standard iodinated contrast medium.Purpose: Prospective evaluation of transcutaneous oxygen pressure (tCp02) before and after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAD).

The purpose of this course is to describe techniques suited for non-invasive vascular imaging and to discuss their current c1inical applications for imaging of peripheral vessels. Principles for applying Ultrasound, CT-Angiography (CTA), and Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) for non-invasive imaging of peripheral arte ries and veins are presented. C/inical applications are reviewed for different vascular diseases, therapy planning, and followup studies. Conventional Doppler and color duplex are the most costeffective procedures to detect or rule out peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) and to provide specific recommendations for therapy.

Methods and Materials: 27 patients with previous peripheral bypass graft surgery underwent DSA and contrast-enhanced MRA within two weeks. Every leg was divided into eleven segments and scored in five categories of stenosis. A total of 38 bypass grafts and 455 segments on 38 extremities were classified. Images were interpreted in a blinded manner. Results: In 33 (87%) bypass grafts stenosis grading by both methods was corresponding, in 3 (8%) patients, stenosis was overestimated by MRA for one class and in 2 (5%) cases for two categories. In 332 (73%) vascular segments there was conformity in graduation, in 37 (8%), there was a difference of 1 grade, in 29 (6%) of 2 grades, in 5 (1%) of 3 grades and in 7 (2%) segments there was an overestimation by MRA of 4 grades. 45 segments (10%) could not be c1assified because of technical limitations.

Hamm; Cairo/ET, Ber/in/O Purpose: To assess feasibility and utility of demonstrating dilated Iymphatics of the breast on MRI. Methods and Materials: Seventy-four women were examined. They had histologically proven malignancy in 40 breast, benign lesions in 26 breasts, no lesions on one-year follow-up in 64 breasts, and previous surgery/radiotherapy in 18 breasts. T2-weighted FSE (4200/140) was performed followed by T1-weighted gradient-echo (11/4.6/25\u00b0) before and 90, 180,270, and 360 sec after injection of Gd-DTPA. Craniocaudal and mediolateral maximum intensity projections (MIP) of T2-weighted and subtracted gadolinium-enhanced images were evaluated by two blinded readers. Results: Three types of hyperintensities were encountered on the MIP-T2-weighted images: rounded (cysts), linear that corresponded to vessels on gadolinium-enhanced MIP images, and linear structures that did not correspond to vessels on gadolinium-enhanced MIP images (dilated Iymphatics). Dilated Iymphatics were seen in 27 of 40 breasts that harbor malignant neoplasms (67.5%), 6 of90 breasts with benign or no lesions (6.6%), and 11 of the 18 previously treated breasts (61.1 %). Statistically, dilated Iymphatics were indicative of malignancy or previous surgery/radiotherapy to the breast (p < .001). Conelusion: Dilated Iymphatics can be demonstrated on MIP-T2weighted MR images. This sign is indicative of malignancy with specificity of 93.3% and sensitivity of 67.5%.

Panizza, A. Vanzulli, M.G. Rodighiero, A. Oe Gaspari, S. Tacchini, A. Dei Maschio; Mi/an/l Purpose: To define the role of dynamic MRI in detecting unknown primary carcinoma in patients with metastatic lesions suspected to be from breast carcinoma. Methods and Materials: Eleven patients with carcinoma metastases histologically suspected to be from breast carcinoma primary, with negative mammography and US examinations, underwent dynamic MRI study (Gd-DTPA 0.1 mmol/Kg body weight) with FAST 3D SPGR sequences. Examinations were elaborated with image substraction, MIP, multiplanar reconstruction and quantitative analysis. When identified at MR examination, lesions were searched with US and if found, examined with FNAB. Patients with positive MR reports underwent surgery. Results: Eight patients had metastases localized in axillary Iymph nodes; two in bones; and one in both lungs and bones. MR identified five patients out of eleven (45%) with breast lesions (1/5 multifocal) not detected by traditional examinations. At histology 4/5 breasts had malignant lesions, 1/5 benign. Conclusion: Our results, although not so remarkable as some found in the literature, confirm that MR is a useful technique to detect metastatic occult breast carcinomas. 8262 1166 Pitfalls and technical Iimitations in MRI of chronic osteomyelitis of the legs H.P.

The population was subdivided into three groups based on forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) % pred. results: stage I COPD is FEV 1 50-70% pred. (n =27); stage 11 COPD is FEV1 35-49% pred. (n =32); and stage 111 COPD is FEV 1 < 35% pred. (n =41). Five thin-section CT scans were obtained at full inspiration. Each slice was scored to a visual CT emphysema score (CT-ES) by two radiologists according to the observational method of Sakai. The mean CT-ES of both observers was calculated. This score could range from zero (no emphysema) to 120 (severe emphysema). Results: The mean CT-ES for stage I COPD was 12 and significantly lower than for stage 11 COPD (37, P < 0.005) and for stage 111 COPD (48, P < 0.0001). In 85% of patients with stage I COPD the CT-ES < 30 indicating no or trivial emphysema. In 47% of patients with stage 111 COPD the CT-ES was >60 indicating moderate or severe emphysema.

Twarkowski; Warsaw/PL Purpose: The extent of changes in patients with clinical and radiological diagnosis of pulmonary emphysema was quantify in high resolution computed tomography examination (HRCT) and pulmonary function tests (PFT). Methods and Materials: HRCT were done in full inspiration for 24 patients (age 55-73). The type and extent of emphysema were evaluated, the mean lung density (MLD) and the relative area of the lung with attenuation values lower then -950 HU (RA 950) were measured. Pulmonary function was assessed by indices: forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV 1), FEV1/vital capacity (VC) ratio (FEV1 %VC), forced expiratory flow in 50% of VC (FEF50), totallung capacity (TLC), residual volume (RV), RVITLC ratio (RV%TLC), intra thora eie gas volume (ITGV). Results: HRCT recognized emphysema as centrilobular in 6, as paraseptal in 11 and as mixed type in 7 cases. Mean MLD was -895.8 \u00b1 25.3 HU (-836.9 HU to -937.8 HU). Mean RA 950 was 19.9 \u00b1 18.4% (2% to 77%). Mean vaJues of puJmonary function tests in percentage of predicted were: FEV1 = 58.2 \u00b1 24.3%, FEV1%VC = 74.3 \u00b1 28%, FEF50 = 27.2 \u00b1 16.1%, TLC = 122.4 \u00b1 17.1%, RV = 192.3 \u00b1 40.1%, RV%TLC =150.2 \u00b1 24.8%, ITGV =163 \u00b1 28.8%.

Oemedts; LeuvenlB Purpose: To examine the effect of bronchodilatation on inhomogeneous lung attenuation at expiratory HRCT in patients with obstructive airways disease. Methods and Materials: Twenty-four patients with symptoms suggestive for airways disease entered the study and were subdivided in 3 subgroups: A (n = 7): % reversibility of FEV1 (% REV) ::::15% = asthma; B (n =8): % REV :S 5% =COPO; C (n =9): % REV 6-14% =mixed group. In each patient, both before and 30 min after bronchodilatation (BO) with 400 mg salbutamol and at 3 lung levels (aortic arch, hilum, lung base), extent of air-trapping was scored and mean inspiratory and expiratory lung density (MLO) was calculated.Results: Focal areas of air-trapping were seen in 14 (A = 3; B = 5; C = 6) patients before and in 16 (A =4; B = 4; C =8) patients after SO. Airtrapping scores were not significantly different nor between groups, nor when compared before and after BO. At all measured levels MLO was significantly lower at full inspiration (TLC) than at full expiration (RV) (p < 0.05). In group A, MLO at RV was significantly higher post SO than pre BO (MLO 3 levels =-688.3 \u00b1 121.4 HU vs -732.1 \u00b1 112.1 HU P < 0.05).

St\u00f6ver, I.J. Kr\u00f6ncke, B. Hamm; BerlinlD Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic value of contrast enhanced MR angiography in the assessment of vascular disease in pediatric patients. Methods and Materials: A total of 21 children (2 weeks-17 years) was examined at 1.5 Tesla using fast interpolated 3D GRE-sequences (turbo-MRA, TR = 3.2-6.2 msec, TE = 1.1-1.9 msec, alpha = 35, acquisition times: 5-21 sec) after bolus injection of a Gadolinium containing extracellular contrast agent (0.2 mmol Gd/kg). Arterial and venous phase data sets were acquired during breath-holds in cooperative children (6 years) or during general anesthesia with short intervals of suspended respiration (younger children and infants). Maximal intensity projections were evaluated qualitatively. Results: In 20/21 cases MR-angiograms of good or excellent quality were obtained. In all cases MR angiograms provided significant diagnostic information. Pathologies included: vascular malformations (isolated or in combination with various syndromes, n = 11), arterial occlusion (posttraumatic or iatrogenic, n =5), renal pathologies (n =3) vascular tumor infiltration (n = 2). Conclusion: Ultrafast contrast enhanced MR angiography allows accurate assessment of vascular pathologies in pediatric patients. Invasive procedures like conventional angiography and administration of X-ray contrast media can be avoided.

Bartolini; Genoa/l Purpose: Cervical Artery Dissection (CAD) account for up to one fifht of ischemic strokes occurring before 45 years. Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) remains the gold standard for evaluating CAD. We investigated the accuracy of non-invasive radiological techniques such Ultrasounds (US), Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRI-MRA), Computed Tomographyand Computed Tomographic Angiography (CT-CTA) compared to DSA in the assessment of CAD. Methods and Materials: We have monitored six patients with CAD (four male, two female; 32-67 years old). All patients performed DSA, US, MRI-MRA and CT-CTA within the first two weeks from the c1inical onset. Patients are then followed up with US alone (3 patients) or combined with CTA (3 patients) at 3 months to 2 years. Results: 4 patients had internal carotid artery dissection; 1 had vertebral artery (V1 and V2) dissection; 1 had multiple neck vessel dissections, that were correctly demonstrated by CTA and DSA in all cases. In five cases US overestimated the stenosis, showing a false occlusion pattern. MRI-MRA weil showed mural hematoma in the subacute stage (2 patients), homolateral reduced intracranial blood flow and brain damage (3 patients). Conclusion: The favorable natural history of CAD emphasizes the need for a non-invasive approach to the detection, monitoring and followup. A combined morphological and functional analysis of the brain and of the neck arteries is mandatory. Because the three sets of CTA images correctly depict arterial wall and lumen without flow artifacts, this technique may be cosidered the new method of choice for the assessment of CAD.14:55 1281 Carotid stenting follow-up: comparison of angiography (DSA), CT-angiography (eTA) and duplex sonography (US) U. v.

Methods and Materials: MRA examinations were performed on a Siemens Magnetom Vision (1.5 T) equipped with a flexible surface coil. The protocol contained time of f1ight, phase contrast, rephased/dephased and contrast enhanced techniques. To improve angiogram quality the hand was placed in warm water before imaging. Maximum Intensity projection was employed for postprocessing. Results: 15 healthy volunteers and 36 patients were exam ined . All images were of diagnostic quality. Best results concerning the detection of digita l arteries were obtained with TOF-techniques. Complete delineation of digital arte ries was possible in all examina ted healthy volunteers. MRA showed a high correlation of the pathological findings detected in La.-OSA, which was performed in 7 patients. In comparison to La.-OSA additional arterial segments were seen by MRA . Vasospasms didn't appear. Conclusion: MRA of the hand with optimized protocols is a robust procedure with promising results .

Bigot; Paris/F Purpose: To improve the renal veins visualization in MR phlebography.Methods and Materials: MR was performed in a Siemens Vision machine on 59 patients. We used fisp 3D sequences for angiography and phlebography of the renal vessels. Mean a mechanic injector (Spectris, Medrad) we performed a circulation time curve and a MRA. MR phlebography was obtained 10 seconds after the MRA on 33 patients (group A), after the calculation of the venous delay time: time difference between arterial and venous peak + time of the acquisitlon + duration of the injection on 26 patients (group B). Images were evaluated using a 4 degree scale. Results: Significative improvement in visualization of the renal veins was obtained mean the calculation ofthe venous time using our method. In all cases of the group B the renal veins were opacified, in 34% of the cases of the group A no evaluation was possible. A good or very good opacification of the renal veins was obtained in 46% of the patients of the group A and in 100% of the patients of the group B. Conclusion: Accurate MR phlebography of the renal veins can be obtained using our method to calculate the venous delay time.Methods and Materials: In 114 patients with 134 adrenal masses , MR findings were compared with histologie results .

Information about ehest wall and mediastinal invasion is still one of the most important factors in the clinical decision to perform surgery. Although certain CT findings demonstrated as being diagnostic of unresectable disease may obviate thoracotomy, tumor contiguity with adjacent mediastinal ehest wall structures is not equivalent of definite invasion. Helical scanning with thin collimation and bolus injection of contrast media during breath hold over the area of contiguity, and multiplanar reconstruction, facilitate the analysis of tumor invasion into adjacent structures. MR remains indicated only in cases in which the CT findings are inconclusive and in those in which extension into the neural foramina and epidural space is Because of its relatively low sensitivity and specificity, CT has limited value in staging mediastinal Iymph nodes.

Clinical symptoms in children are mainly those of tachypnoea diminished effort tolerance, cough and repeated infections. The diagnosis is often difficult, with the initial symptoms or infection being treated as simple infection. By the time the correct diagnosis is made, lung damage is often severe. The radiological management and investigation is primarily by ehest radiographs, supplemented by high resolution CT and va lung scans.Chairperson: G. GELL (GrazlA) 303 A.

Constitutional skeletal dysplasia is Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the United States and Europe. Early diagnosis and staging is important, as prostate cancer is a curable disease if detected early. While new findings regarding genetic predisposition and environmental factors may lead to the definition of potential risk groups, the relative lack of knowledge about the biological behavior of prostate cancer remains the greatest challenge to the c1inical management of this disease at the current time. TransrectaI ultrasound (TRUS) supplemented by color and power Doppler is primarily used for biopsy guidance, directing biopsies of suspicious hypoechoic or hypervascular areas within the prostate gland or systematic sextant biopsies of the entire gland. Endorectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows promise for local staging, but its use is still controversial due to variable diagnostic accuracy (54-89%) and concerns about costs. MR spectroscopic imaging is a promising new technique which provides metabolic information about the prostate gland based on the detection of the metabolites creatine, citrate and choline. This new approach may improve local tumor staging as weil as provide information on tumor aggressiveness. Better imaging evaluation will lead to better tumor control by helping to guide treatment. The development of new forms of palliative therapy, supported by imaging, mayaiso ultimately improve the quality of Iife of patients with prostate cancer.Prostate cancer (PC) is the number 2 cause of cancer death in the USA and most European countries. It has to be emphasized that PC is a curable disease if detected early enough. New findings about genetic infiuences as weil as environmental factors may lead to definitions of potential risk groups. Moreover innovative forms of imaging as weil as novel biological markers may lead to even better detection rates. Nevertheless staging inaccuracy and lack of knowledge about the biological behaviour of PC impedes an optimal therapeutical approach. Better understanding of functional anatomical aspects would help to improve surgical tumour control by reducing side effects. New forms of palliative treatment for metastatic diseases will help to improve quality of Iife in PC patients. Better understanding of hormonal manipulations as weil as non-hormonal treatment regimens will also improve palliation results and together with the application of new radiopharmacenticals may increase survival in the future.",

The recommendations range from denial to strong advocacy for imaging prior to therapy decision. Considering the disagreement about prostate cancer detect ion and choice of treatment, the debate concerning imaging is not surpr ising. Bone scan and computed tomography (CT) supplement clinical and biochemical evaluation (PSA, prostate acid phosphatase) for search of suspected metastatic disease with accepted appropriateness criteria for their use. Serum PSA is used to eliminate unnecessary bone scans (in patients with PSA < 10 ng/ml) and CT scans (in patients with PSA < 20 ng/ml). Guidelines for evaluation of locoregional extenl, however, have not been established and the diagnostic efficacy of both TRUS and MRI remains debatable . Although endorectal MRI shows the rnost promise for local staging, its role ls controversial due to its high cost and variable diagnostic accura cy (54% to 89%). One of the major problems is interobserver variability and lack of reprodu cibility. The recent development of MR spectroscopic imaging expands the diagnostic assessment beyond anatom ie information. MR spectroscopic imag ing provides metabolie information specific to the prostate through the detection of the cellular metabolites citrate, creatine , and choline . The information obta ined from this new technology may allow an expanded assessment of tumor aggress iveness and the attendant risk of disease progression.CT features were correlated several funct ional indices . In one subset of patients (n =110), multivar iate techniques were used to identify the combination of indices which best reflected disease extent. A physiological composite score (CS) was then derived in the second subset (n = 109), by using the identified combination of indices; correlations between individual lung function indices and disease extent and the CS and disease extent were compared .

Rummeny; M\u00fcnsterlD Purpose: To prospectively analyze the clinical performance of various breath held T2-weighted pulse sequences for the detection and characterization of focal liver lesions. Methods and Materials: Unselected patients (n =68) with suspected liver lesions were enrolled into the study. There were 19 patients with benign lesions, 25 with malignant lesions, and 24 patients without lesions. Non-breathheld TSE (TR 5000 ms, TE 83 + 165 ms, sections, TA 18 s). Lesion detection and lesion characterization was performed by two blinded readers. Results were analyzed based on a goldstandard consisting of histopathology for malignant lesions and follow-up for benign lesions and patients without lesions. Results: Lesion detection based on a total of 116 proven lesions was best for HASTE with a TE of 90 ms (100/116; sensitivity 86.2%). The two TSE sequences did not show significantly different results with 95/116 for the non-breathheld sequence and 94/116 for the breathheld sequence.

Conclusion: Percutaneous approach is very valuable both in malignant hilar lesions and in benign lesions after repeated surgery, especially when complicated by lithiasis. Purpose: To document the validity of percutaneous approach to both benign and malignant biliary obstruction. Methods and Materials: Over the last 20 years, we have performed elose to 3,000 percutaneous treatments for biliary obstruction; approximately 1/10 of lesions were of benign nature, while the remaining ones were malignant. In case of malignant lesions, we have used metallic stents. In benign lesions, multiple dilations were preferred leaving the catheter in situ for a few months until infection subsided. In presence of biliary stones, both intra-and extra-hepatic, we have performed percutaneous cholangioscopy and electrohydraulic lithotripsy. Uncovered metallic stents have been inserted in approximately 170 patients with malignant obstruction, while covered metallic stents have been employed in 21 malignant cases. Results: Benign lesions: we have had 70% of excellent results at 10year follow-up. In case of biliary lithiasis, we have had 83% of complete resolution when using electrohydraulic lithotripsy.

US doppler and MR imaging now allow both visualization of cartilage and depiction of joint vascularity and perfusion. Power Doppler US and gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging allow the study of femoral head vascularity in neonates and the detection of positional ischemia.Proper use of gadolinium administration, imaging timing, subtraction or fat suppression techniques is critical and is dependent on child's age and suspected abnormality.

Methods and Materials: 18 patients with histologically verified Crohn's disease underwent MRI either immediately after diagnostic entereclysma (11) or without enteral liquid application (7). MRI was performed with fast breath-hold sequences: T1-FLASH-20-GRE with and without tat suppression (FS) before and after l.v. application of 0.1 mmol Gd-OTPNkg; T2-TSE, HASTE . Investigations were performed on a Magnetom Vision 1.5 T scanner (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany). Results: MRI after enleroclysma allowed for excellent delineation of both the bowel wall and the infammation of the surrounding tissue . There was a good correlation between lhe activity of Crohn 's disease of the enleroclysma and the MRI find ings . After Gd-infusion patients with aetive inflammation showed marked enh ancement in the bowel wall whereas patients with minor inflamation showed only moderate signal enhancement. Conclusion: Post-enteroclysma MRI is an excellent addition to eonventional imaging in primary diagnosis of Crohn's disease . In follow up-stud ies MRI without prior enteroclysma could be able to be the first imaging procedure in those patients. Limitations of this teehnique might be still in lhe deteetion of subtile lesions.591 Magnetic resonance imaging of the gastrointestinal tract in Crohn's disease O.M. Koh, J.C. Healy, R. Chinn , Z.

They were scored elinieally for disease aetivity using the Crohn's disease aetivity index (CDAI) . MRI was performed using breathhold sequences before and after intravenous contrast. MR images were interpreted blind to COAI to determine if there was aetive or inaetive gastrointestinal disease. MR findings were eorrelated with c1inical scoring . Results: Analysis of the first 20 cases show goOO correlation between MR findings and elinical seoring . In 15 patients with aetive disease , MRI demonstrated thiek walled (mean 7.9 mm , range 4-15 mm) segments of bowel. The mean length of involvement was 10.7 em (range 2-45 em). All inflamed segments showed contrast enhancement follow ing IV. Gadolin ium. The pattern of enhancement was diffuse (65%) or layered (33%). Increased per ienterie vaseular ity analogous to the \"eomb sign\" on CT was seen in all patients. An abscess was identified in 1 patient. In 5 patients with c1inieally quiescent disease, no bowel wall thiekening or enhaneement was seen. MR identified a fibrotie strieture in 1 patient. Conclusion: MRI is useful in assessing disease aetivity in Crohn 's disease. MRI may be useful in assessing Crohn's disease aetivity in eases where COAI score is equivoeal.592 Fast hydro-MRI of Crohn's disease: comparison with follow-through examinations K. Sehunk , A. Kern, C.P. Heussei, P. Kalden, T. Orlh, M. Thel en ; MainzlD Purpose: To compare the value of hydro-MRI with follow-through examinations in Crohn 's disease . Methods and Materials: After an oral bowel opaeification using 1000 ml of a 2.5% mannitol solution, axial and coronal breathhold sequenees (T2W HASTE \u00b1 FS, contrast-enhaneed T1W FLASH FS) were acquired in 46 patients with Crohns 's disease at 1.0 T. The findi ngs of hydro-MRI were compared with follow-through examinations. Results: In comparison with hydro-MRI, the follow through examination showed advantages for the dep ietion of the upper gastrointestinal tract ; hydro-MRI was equivalent in the small bowel and superior in the colon . In the stomaeh and the small bowel, hydro-MRI and follow-through examination demonstrated similar numbers of Crohn's involvements (39 vs. 36); in the colon, hydro-MRI showed c1early more infestations (23 vs. 10). In the 46 patients, hydro-MRI showed 585 cm of inflamed bowel , altogether (follow-through examinations: 479 em, p =0.004). There was a good agreement of both methods regarding the assessment of the extent of Crohn's disease and the severity of bowel stenoses (r = 0.89and 0.88, respeetively). Altogether, hydro-MRI was assessed as the superior imaging modality in 31 patients , the follow-through exam ination was assumed to be superior in only one patient. In 14 patien ts. both methods were equivalent. Conclusion: For the assessment of Crohn 's disease, hydro-MRI is preferable to the follow-through exam ination because of super ior imaging quality and the lack of radiation exposure.593 The outer diameter of the appendix: lack of diagnostic specificity.

Results: The mean diameter of the asymptomatie patients was 5.3mm and 29% (70) of them had diameters~6mm . The me an diameter of the symptomatie patients without evidenee of aeute appendieitis was 5.4 mm and 36% (45) of them had diameters~6 mm. The mean value of the aeute inflamed appendiees was 10 mm and 94%(68)of them The choice of the optimal ultrasonic frequency for vascular studies is determined by the required resolution and penetration.

Unenhanced and i.v contrast enhanced CT scans were obtained from the L4 level to the symphysis pubis by using 5 mm collimation, 7.5 mm table feed and 4 mm reconstruction algorhythm. Prospective diagnoses based on CT findings were compared with surgical results and c1incal follow-up. Results: Unenhanced helical CT was an accurate imaging technique for the initial examination of patients with suspected acute appendicitis with an accuracy of 98%. The sensitivity was 96%, the specifity was 100%. No difference was notable between unenhanced and enhanced scans (p < 0.01).

ALGRA (Alkmaar/NL) 603 Degenerative disorders of the spine J.T. Wilmink; Maastricht/NL Modern imaging techniques have proved highly sensitive for detecting degenerative spinal conditions such as disk herniation and also arthro-sis associated with various types of spinal narrowing. An old problem is making itself more strongly fel!: degenerative spinal pathology can be seen in significant numbers of asymptomatic persons. In those referred for diagnostic imaging because of neck or arm pain, low back pain or sciatica, it is often difficult to distinguish which degenerative conditions seen on CT or MRI studies may be responsible for symptoms, and which may be irrelevant. This workshop sets out to clarify those anatomical features seen on imaging studies which are likely to be associated with radicular pain. In the cervical region for instance, root compression by herniated disk material is only likely when the entrance to the intervertebral foramen is completely occiuded. In the lumbar spine it is necessary to study the dimensions of the spinal canal, especially its lateral regions, as weil the contours of the dural sac, the root sleeve and the epidural fat. Relevant techniques are static and dynamic myelography and CT myelography as weil as MRI and MR myelography. Baleriaux, F. Rio, Ph. David, Th. Roger, J. Brotchi; BrusselslB This lecture will mainly deal with spinal cord tumors and their differential diagnosis. Clinical symptoms of cord tumors are often of insidious onse!: pain may be for long the only complain. Before the advent of MRI the diagnosis of cord tumor was often delayed. MRI nowadays studies not only the shape and external contour of the cord, but also the internal changes. Astrocytoma, ependymoma and hemangioblastoma are the most frequent tumors. It is important to try to provide apreoperative diagnosis to the surgeon. Careful analysis of the images will lead to describe important features such as solid nodule, cystic components, associated hydro-syringomyelia, ect. Signal behavior after contrast enhancement provides additional helpful information. Rare tumors are more difficult to diagnose and should essentially be differentiated from non neoplastic lesions such as granulomas, MS, vascular maIformations or inflammatory diseases. Important concepts have to be kept in mind: every tumor does not necessarily enhance and conversely every enhancing mass is not a tumor. Extensive mass lesions on the contrary are most likely to be neoplasms.Acute transverse myelopathy refers to any acute bilateral motor, sensory and autonomic dysfunction in the spinal cord. It can be caused by trauma, neoplasm, infarction, multiple sclerosis (MS), acute disseminating encephalomyelitis (ADEM), idiopathic acute transverse myelitis (IATM), systemic lupus erythematodes, HIV, Lyme disease or irradiation.",

Results: 8 pancreatic adenocarcinomas were present. 10 patients suffered from chronic pancreatitis, and 2 showed a papillitis stenosans. CT and ERCP detected 8 malignant lesions, MRI 7. In 9 patients, ERCP, CT, and MRI excluded malignancy. MRI, CT, and ERCP showed 3 false positive results. Additionally, one pancreatic cancer could not be detected with MRI. Thus, the accuracy of detecting lesions was nearly similar with all 3 methods. Delineation of pancreas and pancreatic tumors on MRI was best on postcontrast fat-suppressed T1w GRE images in correlation with T2w images. Conclusion: This study indicates that mangafodipir trisodium MRI could improve the detection rate and staging accuracy of focal pancreatic lesions. These results need to be confirmed in a larger patient trial. Chronic pancreatitis with enlargement of the pancreatic head: new specific signs on cross-sectional and projective magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreatography F. Haven, H. Bloemen, L. Van Hoe; LeuvenlBResults: Edematous form of pancreatitis was observed in 39% cases, exudative -38%, necrotic -23%. Local complications detectable by CT were caused by various reasons. Fluid extravasation and inflammatory debris in peripancreatic spaces leaded to pseudocyst formation in 22 cases. Superimposition of bacterial infection resulted in abscess or diffuse phlegmonous pancreas inflammation (15 patients). Extension of pancreatic necrosis into adjacent organs caused inflammatory infiltration and ulceration of gastric wall (8 patients), colon fistulization and necrotizing obstruction (3 patients), splenic rupture or hematoma (2 patients). Pancreas hematoma due to arrosion of blood vessels was revealed in 2 cases, secondary compression of biliary tract by enlarged pancreatic head -6 cases. Positive predictive value of CT in diagnosis of infected pancreatic complications was 92.2%, others extrapancreatic complications -98.2%. Depending on clinical and CT manifestations patients underwent therapeutic treatment, surgery or drainage under CT guidance. Conclusion: CT is a valuable method in diagnosis of severity and complications of acute pancreatitis, prognozing the development of pathologic process and determining timely adequate curative measures.Purpose: To describe how chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma can be differentiated by using cross-sectional and projective magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP) in patients with enlargement of the pancreatic head. Methods and Materials: MR imaging (including MRCP) was performed in 44 patients with pancreatic head enlargement. Final diagnosis was pancreatic carcinoma in 29 and chronic pancreatitis with inflammatory enlargement of the pancreatic head in 15. The MRCP features of both entities were compared. Results: The following features were commonly found in pancreatic carcinoma: low signal intensity on 'turbo-FLASH' T1-weighted images; focal narrowing of pancreatic duct; signs of vascular invasion or metastases. In chronic pancreatitis, the following features were typical: signs of attraction or displacement of the common bile duct; intermediate signal intensity of the pancreatic head; presence of dilated side branches within the 'rnass'. The 'double duct sign' was commonly observed in both groups. Conclusion: Presence or absence of the double duct sign is not a reliable criterium to differentiate chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma. Reliable criteria are:(1)signal intensity on T1-weighted images; (2) presence of dilated side branches traversing the mass; (3) the 'attraction sign'.

A 3 ml bolus test of Gd-DTPA was performed in all patients. MIP reconstructions were performed in all cases. In all patients DSA and CT (spiral CT in 27 patients) were performed within 7 days from the CE-MRA. Extension of the AAA (suprarenal, iuxtarenal and infrarenal) , presence of thrombus and renal polar arteries and involvement of iliac arteries were evaluated. Results: In all cases CE-MRA provided exams considered equal (in 29) or superior (in 13) to DSA. All MRAs were considered superior for all information to C'T, 24 AAA were infrarenal, 11 iuxtarenal and 7 suprarenal.

Methods and Materials: We studied 15 patients (3 female and 12 male, mean age 54y) surgically treated with abdominal aortic graft interposition. The evaluation was made by a 1.5 T GE-Unit 8.2, employing conventional FSE T2-weighted sequences and FGRE breathhold T1-weighted sequences. MRA was performed using 3D GRE sequences breath-holding after intravenous bolus injection of contrast medium (0.2 mmoI/Kg). We analyzed the status of the proximal and distal anastomosis, the graft size and patency and the presence of periprosthetic fluid collection. Results: MRA and conventional MRI were both able to define the status of proximal and distal anastomosis, the size and patency of the graft.MRA better defined the status of the renal arteries, proximal and distal native aorta with good evidence of atherosclerotic lesions in all 15 patients.The presence of periprosthetic material was also evident in 10/15 patients by the analysis of MRA single partitions, ranging between 5 mm to 25 mm, but was inadequate to define the presence of fluid and edema, that were evident in 6/10 cases by conventional MRI T2weighted sequences.Conclusion: Gd-enhanced 3D MRA is adequate in the evaluation of intraluminal alterations in patients surgically treated with graft. Moreover the evaluation of periprosthetic fluid collection needs the employment of conventional MRI acquisitions. Merlino, R Fossaceca, F. Vizzani, M. Salcuni, A. Carriero, L. Bonomo; Chietill Purpose: To assess the potential value of ultrafast spoiled gradient echo (GRE) contrast (CM) enhanced MRA (CE-MRA) in comparison to unenhanced conventional MRA (C-MRA) in the evaluation of the vertebral arteries (VERT). Methods and Materials: Fifteen patients (age 57-68 yrs.) were consecutively enrolled and underwent C-MRA and CE-MRA (neck array coil, Siemens Vision). Conventional MRA was performed by using a 3D axial TOF multislab (MOTSA) technique. CE-MRA was performed with a 3D-FLASH spoiled GRE sequence on the coronal plane, during administration of a bolus of CM (0.1 mmol/kg, 2 ml/s, TA 15-20 s). The vertebral arteries were divided in four segments: a visualization index (from 0 -no visualization -to 3 -very good visualization) for each segment was attributed. Results: In 14 patients (93%) CE-MRA allowed full visualization of VERT (99% of all segments). CE-MRA visualization index was better than for C-MRA (2.1 +1-0.7 vs 1.3 +1-0.6, p < .01), even for the origin and the proximal portion of VERT. Conclusion: Ultrafast CE-MRA improves the visualization of VERT. Due to the acquisition on the coronal plane and the high S/N, it represents the best MRA technique for a complete assessment of VERT. and corrected by repeat VB. All malignantlborderline diagnoses were confirmed by definitive surgery. No underestimation of tumor type and only two side-effects occurred with VCB (1 seizure, 1 large hematoma). Conclusion: Aggressive removal (over 16 cores 11g) may increase accuracy without increasing side-effects.

Lehrer; ViennalA Purpose: To compare the accuracy of directional, vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (DVABB) vs. automated large core biopsy (ALCBB) in the assessment of atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Methods and Materials: In this multi-center trial (16 centers) percutaneous, prone, stereotactic breast biopsy was performed in 13163 lesions. ADH was diagnosed in 524 and DCIS in 1278 lesions. Of the 524 lesions diagnosed as ADH 194 were biopsied with 14-G ALCBB, 129 with 14-G DVABB,and 201 with 11-G DVABB. Of all 1278 DCIS 373 were biopsied with 14-G ALCBB, 348 with 14-G DVABB, and 557 with 11-G DVABB. The number of ADH lesions upgraded to breast cancer and the number of DCIS upgraded to infiltrating breast carcinoma (IBC) at time of subsequent surgery were evaluated for each biopsy technique.Results: The percentage of ADH lesions diagnosed with ALCBB and upgraded to breast cancer was 38.1%. For the ADH lesions diagnosed with 14-G and 11-G DVABB, the percentage of the upgrading to breast cancer was 21% and 20%, respectively. Thus, with both DVABB techniques the underestimation rate of ADH decreased significantly (p = 0.0001). The percentage of DCIS lesions diagnosed with ALCBB and upgraded to IBC was 20.1%. For the DCIS lesions diagnosed with 14-G and 11-G DVABB, the percentage of the upgrading to IBC was 11% and 11.5%, respectively. Thus, with both DVABB techniques the underestimation rate of DCIS decreased significantly (p =0 0001).Conclusion: With both DVABBtechniques underestimation rate of ADH and DCIS decreased significantly in comparison with ALCBB.

Heywang-K\u00f6brunner, D. Lange, C. Alter, D. Lampe, R.P. Spielmann; HaI/eID Purpose: Sears after surgieal biopsy may obseure or mimiek malignaney. Yielding eomparable or belter aeeuraey VBB -being a minimally invasive method -promises less searring and improved evaluation of the post-biopsy mammogram. In this study post-VBB ehanges have been evaluated. Methods and Materials: The first eonseeutive 150 patients, who had only undergone VCB (using 11G needles, Mammotome/Biopsys, prone digital table/Fiseher) and who returned for 6 mos. -follow-up, where evaluated eoneerning post-VCB ehanges. Patients with malignant or borderline lesions were excluded, sinee they underwent definitive surgery after VBB. Results: The mammographie abnormality had disappeared eompletely in 102 and partially in 77 lesions. 2 lesions inereased in size. Surgery eonfirmed fibroadenomas, whieh grew under hormone replaeement therapy. No or very slight density was noted in 170 eases, a slight density was seen in 9 eases. Diagnostieally disturbing searring oeeurred in one ease and was solved by MRT. Conclusion: VBB in eontrast to surgieal biopsy only rarely impairs future mammographie evaluation.

Facecchia, A. Vasciaveo, C. Zuiani, M. Biscosi, M. Bazzoeehi; UdinellPurpose: Reeentently many authors proposed the use of invasive methods alternative to eore biopsy in the diagnosis of Atypieal Ductal Hyperplasia (ADH). Our objeetive is to demonstrate that the use of such deviees to diagnose IDA isn't neeessary. Methods and Materials: In a sampie of 553 biopsed lesions between 1993 and 1997, ADH was found in 8 ease. Diagnosis has been formulated by mierohistologie sam pies obtained by automatie system and 14G needles. The evaluation has been done in joint reading sessions with pathologists using Page's eriteria and anatomie wideness eriteria. Seven lesion underwent to surgieal biopsy. Results: After surgieal biopsy in only one ease ADH diagnosis was eonfirmed. Typieal duetal hyperplasia and adenosis in one ease. In five eases we had carcinomas (one papilliferous, one duetal eareinoma in situ, three infiltrative duetal earcinomas). Conclusion: Even if ADH diagnosis isn't reliable the use of invasive deviees like MAMMOMAT and ABBI isn't justifiable. ADH diagnosis by mierohistologie sam pies rappresents only a low pereentage of all ones (8/553, 1.49%) and isn't a problem above all beeause this diagnosis offen hides a carcinoma and demands surgieal biopsy. So we belive that the use of alternative biopsy instead of eore biopsy is unuseful and expansive.662 A prospective randomized comparison of sitting and prone position of stereotaxic core breast biopsy P.

However, only 15% of all patients missed all the opportunities and were eompletely lost to follow-up. We diseovered 2 additional FN eases at 6 month, and another 2 FN eases at 1 year. No FN eases were diseovered at 2 years. We intend to analyze and present the FN eases, in order to understand some of the probable reasons for failure. 664 Pereutaneous breast biopsy deviee: first experienees with a new deviee for large eore biopsies (15mm diameter) U.

Methods and Materials: In 23 patienls with advanced Iymphedema of limbs (13 secondary-6 arms, 14 legs; 10 primary-2 patients one leg and 8 both legs) we obtained T2WFSE sequences (TR 6000, TE 200, 3 NEX), 3 mm slice thickness, multiple contiguous series, using a 0.5 T field system, standard body coil. MIPs were obtained from axial and sagittal images in all cases. Lymphoscintigraphy was compared with MRI findings. Results: Lymphatics appeared, on MR-Lymphoangiographic images, as a network of thin hyperintense images, conneeting both supra-and sub-fascial regions. Small \"Iakes\" of Iymph were visible as saceular dilatations. Large Iymphatic vessels were detected in 9 patients; in 8 we found Iymphatic \"Iakes\"; the Iymphedema's distribution within supra-and/or sub-fascial compartments was always detectable. Good eorrelation with pathologie ehanges seen by Iymphoscintigraphy was observed in 5 cases (1 case with dilatation and reflux, 4 with Iymphatie lakes and dilated eolleetors).

Alberici, L. Preda, E.M. Oi Maggio, R. Campani;Introduction: Immunosuppressive therapy is a potential oncogenic risk in heart transplant recipients which has however been reduced in recent times thanks to the clinical application of cyclosporine.Methods and Materials: January, 1990, to Oecember, 1997, five hundred and seventy-four patients were submitted to ortho/eterotopic heart transplantation. We report on 14 lung cancers (11 adenocarcinomas and 3 small cell lesions) diagnosed at routine ehest radiography. Results: Radiography was of diagnostic value in 12/14 cases, while massive pleural effusion and segmentary lung atelectasia prevented the diagnosis in the extant 2 cases. Histologie confirmation was given after CT-guided lung biopsy in 9/14 cases (64%), brushing and transbronchial biopsy in 3/14 cases (21%) and thoracotomy in 2/14 cases (14%). Conclusion: Lung cancers are an important complication (2.4% in the whole series) of immunosuppressive therapy; routine ehest radiography permits their diagnosis which nevertheless needs cyto-/histologic confirmation with CT-guided biopsy.683 Detection of intrathoraclc malignancy after heart transplantation M.

Final diagnosis was lymphoma in four cases , and bronchial carc inoma in nine cases . The yearly incidence of these tumors calculated to 0.46% and 1.4%, respectively. Tumor stage at diagnosis was earlier in comparison to experiences at other cemters , whe re bronchial carcinoma is typ ically diagnosed at a late stage (Jllb to IV), and where the median survival after diagnos is ranges from 27 days to 3 months. Conelusion: Routine ehest radiographs performed on a regular , monthly or bimonthly basis seem to be an effective tool in reduc ing tumor stage at diagnosis in cardiac allograft recipients.684 Pulmonary artery sareoma: preand postoperative radiologie findings in primary diagnosis and reeurrence A. Fasse , H.-U. Kauczor , E. Mayer, K.-F. Kreitner , C.P. Heussei, M. Thelen ; MainzlDPurpose: Primary pulmonary artery sarcoma are very rare tumors. Their diagnosis is difficult due to the ir unspecific symptoms. Still , an early preoperative diagnosis is the only possibility for a potential therapy. Patients and Methods: Five pre-and flve postoperative CT-and four preand two postoperative MRT-examinat ions have been evaluated with respect to surgical and histological findings. Results: The presence of a convex intraluminal bulging mass spreading mostly from the pulmonary trunc cont inuously into the peripheral pulmonary artery branches, the fill ing and dilatation of the vessels , the tumor's inhomogenity indicat ing hemorrhages and necrosis and the appearance of intrapulmonary nodules are found in both CT and MRI. Recurrent pulmonary artery sarcoma features an extravascular growth and is similar to lung cancer affecting the vessels . It shows contrast enhancement both in CT and MRI while the primary tumor shows a distinct contrast enhancement only of Gadopentetate dimeglumine but none or Iittle enhancement in CT. Conelusion: The criteria presented in knowledge of CT and MRI serve to increase the probability for a correct preoperative diagnosis and thus allow adequate surgical planning.685 Detection of solid calcification in small puJmonary noduJes at sp iral CT eliminating the partial volume effect O. Wormanns, S. Oiederich, N. Roos , E.J. Rummeny; M\u00fcnsterlD Purpose: To detect calcification in small pulmonary nodules with apparent soft tissue density at thick-section spiral C'I, Methods and Materials: True density values (Hounsfield units) of 70 small pulmonary nodules \u00ab5 mm) w/th apparent soft tissue density at low-dose spiral CT (collimation 5 rnrn, pitch 2, reconstruction interval 5mm , 50 mA , 120 kV) were calculated using a formula (A) suggested by Yankelevitz based on analysis of a single slice and a new formula (B) using contiguous slices for true nodule density calculation. The nodules were classified as calcified or not (threshold 185 HU) . Thin-section sp iral 5154 CT (TSSCT) (collimat ion 1.5 mm , pitch 2, reconstruction interval 1 mm) was used as the gold standard and showed calcification in 36 nodules .Results: Using formula A 62170 (88 .6%) nodules ware class ified correclly ; in 8 lesions that were shown on two contiguous slices calcification was missed. Using formula B 67170 (95.7%) nodules were elassified correclly. With both formulas no false positive results were obta ined. Positive predict/ve values for calc ification were 78% for formula A and 92% for formula B. The x2-Test showed no significant difference between the class ifications observed on TSSCT and formula A (a = 5.5%) and no difference between TSSCT and formula B (a = 47 %).Conclusion: The new formula based on analysis of !wo cont iguous slices for true density calculation was superior to one described in the literature based on a single slice and allows reliable deteclion of calc ification in small pulmonary nodules at thick-section CT.686 Comparison of the value of preoperative cytology and dynamic contrast enhanced (c.e.)

Methods and Materials: Patients with solitary pulmonary nodule were examined with two-phase enhanced spiral CT. Noncalcified nodules in 29 patients (M: F =21:8, mean age =45.9) were subsequently diagnosed as tuberculomas (size range : 1.3 to 3.8 cm , mean : 2.6 cm) . Another group of 26 patients with nodules was proven patholog ically to have malignant nodules (size range : 1.1 to 4.5 cm , mean : 3.1 cm) . Enhanced scans were performed 30 (early phase) and 70-180 sec (Iate phase) after intravenous injection of 100 mL of iodinated contrast med ia in a rate of 2.5 mUsec. Enhancement patterns of tubercu lomas were compared with malignan t nodules. Results: The enhancing pattern was more effic iently evaluated with the late enhanced images and was significanlly different between tuberculomas and malignant nodules (p < 0.001). Thirteen (45%) tuberculomas showed peripheral thin rim enhancement and 11 (38%) showed nonenhancement. Twelve (46%) malignant nodules were enhan ced homogeneously and another 12 (46%) with mosaic pattern. Conclusion: Two-phase enhanced spiral CT ls efficient for evaluating enhancement pattern of pulmonary nodules and is useful for non invasive differential diagnosis between tuberculoma and malignant nodules.691 Model-and knowledgebased segmentation of hand radiographs for maturity determination E Vogelsang, M.

Methods and Materials: CT scans of 78 patients with malignant SPLs including air bronchogram were reviewed. Lesions were c1assified into 4 cell types as squamous cell, small cell, adenocarcinoma, bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC), according to degree of differentiation, size, and location. Air bronchogram patterns were c1assified into obstructing (I), patent (11), displacing (111), or tapered narrowing (IV) types. Results: Eighty patterns were analyzed. According to cell types, squamous cell carcinoma showed most often type I (45.8%) but no type 11 pattern, most common in BAC (77.8%) and adenocarcinoma (34.8%). Small cell carcinoma showed most often type IV pattern (41.7%). In all 3 degrees of differentiation, type 111 was most common. No significant differences existed according to size. According to location, central types were seen more often (63.75%) with more commonly type land IV patterns, whereas peripheral ones had more often type 111 and 11 patterns. Conclusion: We conclude that in SPLs with air bronchogram sign of either obstructing or displacing pattern, squamous cell carcinoma should be suspected.

Methods and Materials: VTB based on Spiral-CT of the ehest was computed in 11 patients (0.5--16.7a) with tracheobronchial palhology. For surface rendering (SR) the tracheobronchial tree was detected semiautomated. On a workstation screen the virtual endoscopic view together with the CT slice, a 3D anatomie model and a MPR orthogonal to the virtual camera view were displayed. Volume Rendering was performed with a commercial software package (VoxelView 2.5. Vital Images). Study protocol of spiral CT was adjusted to the clinical question. All reports and videotapes of FTB were available for comparison. Results: VTB could be computed in all patients. There was total agreement between VTB and FTB. Volume rendering showed more realistic virtual endoscopic views but surface rendering provided more simultaneous information of extraluminal anatomy and was less cornputer intensive and time consuming . Conclusion: There is no age limit for computation of VTB from S-CT data and tracheobronchial pathology can be imaged. VTB using surface detection allows matching of extra and intraluminal anatomy which is far beyond of FTB alone. Therefore VTB can be used for training and simulation purposes .15:25 1316 Determination of pulmonary time constants in aporeine ARDS model using dynamie CT H.-U. Kauezer. K. Markstaller. N. Weiler. B. Eberle, M. Thelen; MainzlDPurpose: To determine inspiratory and expiratory time constants in healthy and diseased lungs using aporeine ARDS model and dynamic multiscan CT. Methods and Materials: Surfactant depletion ARDS was induced in five anesthetized pigs by saline lavage. Transaxial dynamic multiscan HRCT scans (slice thickness =1 mrn, temporal resolution =250 rns, acquisition 49 s) were obtained before and after induction of ARDS. During dynamic CT acquisition airway pressure was suddenly increased (0-50 cm H20) or decreased (50-0 cm H 20) . Absolute and relative ventilated lung areas were measured planimetrically using a double threshold (-910 to -300 HU). Results were plotted against time and fitted to calculate different time constants. Results: In healthy lungs a single inspiratory time constant (0.3-0.4 s) was found, whereas in AROS two different inspiratory time constants (0.6-0.8 sand 5.5--10 s) were observed. The slower one recruited about 15% of the total ventilated area. During explration, healthy lungs exhibited two different time constants (1.1 and 5 s), whereas AROS lungs had only one time conslant of 0.4 s. Conclusion: Different pulmonary time constants were measured using dynamic multiscan CT in healthy and diseased lungs. Their knowledge could allow for individual modification of ventilation techniques.RoomGConclusion: In conclusion the correct local staging of the uterocervical neoplasia needs the use of a methodological approach by images capable to complete the clinical examination on narcosis. In fact TR-US Has shown a greater accuracy than clinical examination, notwhithstanding the difficulty in showing directly the neoplasia.1319 Interventional treatment as palliative therapy in hemorrhage from recurrent cervical carcinoma S.G. Kr\u00e4mer, J. G\u00f6rich, N. Rilinger, S. Heilmann, R. Sokiranski, AJ. Aschoff, H.-J. Brambs; U1mlD 1317 Uterine cervical carcinoma: comparison of standard and pharmacokinetic analysis of time-intensity curves for assessment of tumor angiogenesis and patient survival H. Hawighorst, P.G. Knapstein, MV Knopp, G. van Kaick; HeidelberglD Purpose: To examine the association of standard and pharmacokinetic analysis of time-intensity curves in dynamic MRI with histomorphological markers of tumor angiogenesis (microvessel density [MVD]; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor [VEGF]), and (ii) to determine the ultimate value of those data with disease outcome in patients with cancer of the uterine cervix.Methods and Materials: Pharmacokinetic parameters (amplitude A, exchange rate constant k21) and standard parameters (maximum signal intensity (SI)-increase [SI-I] over baseline and steepest SI-upslope per second [SI-Uls]) were calculated from dynamic MRI series in 37 patients with biopsy-proven primary cervical cancer. Histomorphological data, Kaplan-Meier survival curves were calculated and compared using logrank statistics. Results: A significant association was found between MVD and amplitude A (P < .01) and SI-I (P < .05). No significant relationships were observed between VEGF expression and dynamic MRI parameters. Kaplan-Meier curves based on k21 and SI-Uls showed that tumors with high k21 and SI-Uls values had a significantly (P < .05, .001, respectively) worse disease outcome than tumors with low k21 and SI-Uls values. Conclusion: The pathophysiological basis for differences in dynamic MRI is MVD but not VEGF-expression; a functional, dynamic MRI approach may be better suited to assess tumor microcirculation than current histomorphological-based markers of tumor angiogenesis. 14:10 1318 Transrectal ultrasonography (TRU5) in the cervical carcinoma local staging V. Summaria, P. Mirk, G. Maresca, AM. Costantini, S. Speca, AL. Valentini; RomeIl Purpose: To assess the role of TR-US in the local staging (T) of the cervical carcinoma (FIGO stage IB, 11, 111), in patients candidate to surgical treatment after chemiotherapy. Methods and Materials: Twenty three patients with cervical epidermoid carcinoma (clinical staging: 2 IB, 5 IIA, 9 IIB, 7 IIIB), before and after systemic neoadjuvant chemiotherapy (2 cycles), were examined with TR-US. The images were evaluated for the following parameters: size of cervix, tumor size, vaginal and parametrial involvement, bladder and rectal wall invasion. Imaging data were collected on performed sheets and compared to findings of clinical examination under anaesthesia and MRI. All data were finally compared to results of resected hysterectomy specimen, considered as the gold standard. Results: All patients underwent surgical therapy. The analysis points out that the diagnostic accuracy of TR-US in evaluating the cervix volume was equal to that of MRI (73%), superior to that of the clinical examination on narcosis (52%), although tumor size was exactly detected only in 10/23 pts. Also in estimating vaginal and parametrial involvement (78% and 74%), TR-US is superior to clinical examination on narcosis (75% and 65%) and inferior to MRI (83% and 82%). On the other hand TR-US and MRI have shown a diagnostic accuracy close to 100% in estimating bladder and rectal involvement.Purpose: Retrospective evaluation of interventional, percutaneous therapy in the final treatment of recurrent locally advanced cervical carcinoma. Methods and Materials: Between 1990 and 1998 15 patients with advanced tumor disease were referred to our department for diagnosis and therapy of an acute blood loss. In all patients aged from 40 to 89 years hemorrhage was detected by the loss in red blood count, partly Iife-threatening. In all cases patients suffered recurrent disease after surgery and additional radiation or chemotherapy. Embolization was performed by transfemoral acces using minicoils in most cases, liquid agents rarely and a covered vascular stent in one patient. Results: The site of the hemorrhage or the blood pooling of the tumor could be ssen in all cases angiographically. 27 therapie cycles (1.8 per patient) were performed in time intervals from 3 days to 6 months. The maximum time of treatment was one year. In 8/15 patients with single therapy the bleeding could be stopped immediately in 7 (46.5%). One patient died during therapy because of the not controllable bleeding and the consecuive enormous blood loss (7%). The remaining patients showed shightly persistent or recurrent bleeding, which could be managed interventionally until the following episode (46.5%). There were two complications during therapy representing a coil misplacement and a coil wash out which could be managed interventionally. Conclusion: Hemorrhage following recurrent cervical carcinoma can be stopped interventionally in over 90% of cases. Even in patial success it is possible to manage the acute life-threatening situation. Follow-up's of up to 1 year rectifie this therapeutic concept.1320 Magnetic resonance imaging of sarcomas of the female pelvis I. Biltjes, \u00d6. \u00d6zsarlak, AMA De Schepper; AntwerplBPurpose: To describe MRI-findings in sarcomas of the female pelvis. Methods and Materials: 18 patients with histologically proven sarcomas of the female pelvis were examined with MRI. Examinations were performed on either a 0.2, 1.0 or 1.5T whole body imager. At least sagittal T2-weighted and sagittal T1-weighted images before and after IV gadolinium were performed. Results: Uterine leiomyosarcoma was the most frequently encountered tumor (56%). It is difficult to differentiate from other uterine masses especially leiomyoma, but some findings are helpful in the diagnosis. In decreasing order mesodermal sarcoma (malignant mixed m\u00fcllerian tumors), stromal sarcomas, and rhabdomyosarcomas were also seen. In these cases some MR-characteristics are suggestive for the histologie tumor type, but patients age and other parameters are also useful in making the correct diagnosis. Conclusion: Sarcomas of the female pelvis are rare tumors. Nevertheless it is important to be aware of their presentation, especially on MRI, in order to make a prompt and correct diagnosis. MRI is the preferred imaging modality in evaluating invasion into the myometrium, extension to surrounding structures and follow-up.1321 Phased-array body coil MR imaging in ovarian tumors and the impact of intestinal and intravenous contrast enhancementA Heuck, S. Uns, J. Scheidier, M. Steinborn, I. Bauernfeind, Th. Helmberger, M.F. Reiser; MunichlDPurpose: To evaluate the diagnostic potential of high field, phasedarray body coil MR imaging in the diagnostic work-up of ovarian tumors, and to assess the impact of a negative intestinal contrast agent and intravenous Gd-OTPA on diagnostic accuracy. Methods and Materials: 44 patients with sonographically suspected ovarian tumors were included in the study. MR imaging was preoperatively performed on a 1.5 T System (Magnetom Vision, Siemens, Germany) using a phased-array body coil. Non-enhanced imaging included T1-and T2-weighted turbo-spin-echo (TSE) sequences. After oral (400 to 600 ml) and rectal (200 to 300 ml) administration of a superparamagnetic contrast agent (Ferumoxsil, Guerbet, France) the same sequences were applied. After additional IV-application of 0.1 mmol/kg, Gd-OTPA (Schering, Germany) T1-weighted sequences with and without fat suppression were performed. Three radiologists, blinded to all clinical and other imaging data, independentiy reviewed the 3 imaging sets. MR imaging findings were compared to surgical and pathohistological findings. Results: The mean diagnostic accuracy in differentiating benign and malignant ovarian tumors was 88.6% for non-enhanced, 90.9% for bowel-enhanced, and 93.0% for bowel and IV enhanced imaging. Accuracy values for the detection of bowel infiltration were 79.7% (non-enhanced). 86.2% (bowel-enhanced). and 87.9% (bowel and IV enhanced); for peritoneal spread the respective accuracy values were 69%, 72% and 94%. The mean subjective certalnty of the radiologists in establishing a complete staging diagnosis increased from 77% with nonenhanced imaging to 82% with bowel-enhanced, and 92% with both bowel and IV enhanced imaging. Conclusion: Phased-array body coil MR imaging holds a high potential in the diagnostic work up of ovarian tumors. Negative intestinal contrast agent may improve the detection of bowel infiltration. IV contrast enhancerment is an important aid for the diagnosis of peritoneal spread.14:50 1322 Value of routine imaging in the follow-up of gynecologic malignancies R. Forstner, A. Graf, A. Stempfl, H. Nemec, A. Staudach; Sa/zburg/A Purpose: Routine staging in gynecologic malignancies is under debate. This study was performed to assess the value of routine imaging in the follow-up of gynecologic cancers. Methods and Materials: 115 patients underwent routine staging in-c1uding clinical examinations, endosonography (ES) and CA-125 every 3 months, and spiral CT after 12 and 24 months. Tumor recurrence was evaluated according to tumor type and stages, detection by modality, by site, size and architecture. Results: Tumor recurrence was detected in 31/115 (27%) of clinically unremarkable patients (cervical cancer: 14/58, endometrial cancer: 6/28, ovarian cancer: 11/29). Local recurrence was found in 15/31 patients. Recurrent tumor was detected in 45.2% by routine ES, in 35.4% by routine CT after one and 16.1% after 2 years. In 2 patients CA-125 elevation preceeded detection by imaging. In ovarian cancer recurrence was detected either by ES, or CT after 12 months. Conclusion: Routine postoperative imaging allows detection of tumor recurrence in 27% of clinically unremarkable patients and thus aids in improved treatment planning. Oue to its site 50% of recurrence will only be detected by CT.1323 Reduction of microvascular permeability and ascites fluid in ovarian cancer after treatment with vascular endothelial growth factor antibody: monitoring therapeutic effects with macromolecular contrast-enhanced MR imaging A. Gossmann, Th. Helbich, S. Mesiano, O.M. Shames, M.F. Wendland, T.P.L. Roberts, N. Ferrara, R. Jaffe, R.C. Brasch; Cologne/D, Vienna/A, San Francisco,CA/USAPurpose: The accumulation of peritoneal ascites fluid in ovarian cancer results from increased permeability of peritoneal Iining vessels to macromolecules, mediated, in part, by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Macromolecular contrast medium (MMCM)-enhanced MR imaging was used to monitor the effects of anti-VEGF antibody on tumor microvascular permeability and the volume of ascites in an ovarian cancer model. Methods and Materials: The human ovarian cancer cell line SKOV-3 was inoculated intraperitoneally into athymic rats. Six were treated with 8296 monoclonal antibody to VEGF (anti-VEGF), and six with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) over a 14-day course. Oynamic MR imaging was performed with MMCM enhancement (albumin-(Gd-OTPAh o, 0.03 mmol/kg). Vascular permeability was assayed using dynamic enhancement data and a kinetic model. Results: Saline treated animals developed large volumes ascites fluid during the treatment period and showed a significantiy (p < 0.01) increased MRI-assayed tumor microvascular permeability. By contrast, anti-VEGF antibody treated animals developed significantiy (p < 0.01) smaller volumes of ascites associated with a significant (p < 0.03) reduction in tumor microvascular permeability to MMCM. Conclusion: Anti-VEGF antibody treatment reduces macromolecular permeability and the accumulation of ascites fluid in a human ovarian cancer model. These effects can be measured with MMCM-enhanced MR imaging. The hypothesized link between microvascular permeability and the production of ascites is supported.15:10 1324 The prognostic value of FOG-PET for the evaluation of high-dose (HO) chemotherapy (Ctx) treatment in metastatic germ-cell tumors (GCT): correlation with CT and MRI A.-Ch. Pfannenberg; T\u00fcbingen/D Purpose: This analysis investigates the prognostic value of PET for the outcome of HO-Ctx and for the classification of residual tumors after HO-Ctx in patients with relapsed GCT in comparison to radiological (CT/MRI) methods. Methods and Materials: FOG-PET with visual and quantitative (SUV) analysis and CT and MRI scans were performed in 27 GCT patients (pts) undergoing HO-Ctx. In CT and MRI tumor localization, changes in size (PD/SO = vital, PR/CR = avital), density and signal intensity were assessed. PET and CT/MRI results were correlated to histological results at resection or the clinical course of the pts. Results: Residual masses (28 pts, 56 residual tumors): In 37/56 (66%) the prediction by PET was correcl. The comparative results in CT/MRI were 28 true positive (6PO/22S0) and 10 true negative (10PR). Fals\u00b7e predietions occured in 18/56 (32%) with both methods. Prediction of response (17 pts): 5/5 negative and 10/12 positive PETs correctly predicted the clinical outcome (90%) (in comparison CT/MRI 72%).Conclusion: PET appears to possess a high predictive value to detect chemotherapy resistance and may improve patient selection for HO-Ctx. In the evaluation of residual tumors after HO-Ctx false results will be gained in 1/3 of the pts and PET does not help in the decision process about secondary tumor surgery. CT and MRI imaging cannot predict correctly therapy effects or vitality of residual masses after HO-Ctx.1325 Magnetic resonance (MR) of pelvis with fat-saturation sequences in pelvic endometriosls: comparison between MR and laparoscopy C. Zuiani, C. Dei Frate, P. Piani, G. Dei Frate, M. Fiorenza, M. Bazzocchi; Udine/l Purpose: To assess MR diagnostic chances, with fat-saturation se\u00b7 quences, in specifie arrangement of patients affected by pelvic endometriosis, in comparison with laparoscopic results. Methods and Materials: 30 patients underwent to MR of pelvis with following sequences: TSE, T1 and T2 W, SE T1 FAT-SAT on transverse and sagittal planes with slice thickness of 6 mm. 27 palients underwent to laparoscopy within 15 days after MR. Others 3 patients after MR results, didn't undergo to laparoscopy, but had been subjected to clinical and sonographie follow-up of 6-12 months. Results: MR imaging left out the presence of endometriosis in 3 patients who had functional serous ovarian cysts. Among the others 27 patients, in 3 patients 5 dermoid cysts were identified, in 3 patients 3 cystic adenomas were seen, all confirmed at laparoscopy, and 21 cases of pelvic endometriosis with these MR reports: 25 endometriosic cysts and 44 implants. Moreover in 3 patients MR showed 5 nodular endometriosic lesions located between posterior vaginal fornix and rectum wall (rectumvaginal nodules).",

Budassi, A. Tartaro, M. Maiorano, L. Bonomo; ChietillPurpose: To compare diagnostic accuracy of dynamic Spiral CT (SCT) vs laryngoscopy in defining loco-regional extension of larynx carcinoma. Methods and Materials: 20 patients, affected by larynx carcinoma, were prospectively studied. SCT examination was performed by using the following parameters: 3 mm slice thickness; 5 mm/sec table feed; 140 kV, 205 mAs; 2 mm image reconstructions. Intra-venous injectlon of 100 ce of non-ionic contrast medium (300 mgl/ml) by means of power injector (2 mI/sec flow, 45 sec start delay) was used in all cases.Dynamic spiral scan of the larynx (2 mm slice thickness, pitch = 1) was performed during Valsalva's maneuver. Multiplanar reconstructions of the neck and larynx were available in all cases. Two blinded radiologists analysed SCT images, in joint session. Data analysis was carried out by means of the test of McNemar (p < 0.05). Results: Overall SCT was more accurate than laryngoscopy in defining loco-regional extension of larynx carcinoma (p =0.024). Nevertheless, no significant differences were found between the two methods at glottic and sovraglottic level. Conclusion: SCT represents the elective technique in evaluating locoregional extension of larynx carcinoma. The availability of coronal and sagittal images of larynx during dynamic scans improves the accuracy of this technique.1330 Staging of laryngeal carcinoma: role of contrast enhanced and non-centrast enhanced MRI A. Vallone, T. Scarabino, B. Merlino, A. Carriero, L. Bonomo; Chietill 14:50 1329 Spiral CT with multiplanar and 3D imaging after reconstructive supracricoid laryngectomy R. Dore, G. Di Giulio, L. Preda, C. Villa, G. Di Maggio, A. La Fianza, M. Benazzo; PaviallPurpose: Surgery for treating even advanced laryngeal cancer are aimed at removing the disease, reconstructing a neolarynx, mantaining physiological functions. Aim of this study is to define normal axial, MPR and 3D CT features after reconstructive laryngectomies. Methods and Materials: 24 supracricoid laryngectomies (SL) were carried out, 13 cricohyoidopexy (CHP) and 8 cricohyoidoepiglottopexy (CHEP). All patients were examined by SCT during the follow-up, from 1 to 9 months, in the absence (21) or presence (3) of clinical signs of suspected or obvious recurrence. Results: 18 patients with negative SCT, endoscopy ond or biopsy, formed the basis of this study. The SCT features after CHP were: asymmetry of airway lumen (3D); lateral hypopharyngeal pocket ipsilateral to the preserved arytenoid (3D, MPR); persistence of one or both arytenoids (axial); slight angulation between the hyoid bone and associated cricoid (MPR); thickening of supraarytenoidal soft tissue (axial, 3D); transverse arrangement of vocal space during speech. After CHEP epiglottis is usually vertical and preepiglottic space is thin. Conclusion: After reconstructive surgery SCT with MPR and 3D images can help to represent the new anatomy and can evaluate some important areas which are critical in the endoscopic view: cricoarytenoid unit, hypopharingeal pockets, peepiglottic space.Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of MRI in staging (T parameter) of the laryngeal carcinoma and to compare the results of contrast enhanced MRI (CE MRI) and non-centrast enhanced MRI.Im 1808 Imaging of the larynx and oropharynxChairpersons: JA CASTELlJNS (Amsterdam/NL) G.C. ETTORRE (Bari/l) 1326 Pretherapeutic study of initial squamous cell carcinomas of the cheek P. Meingan, J. Viala, B. Mesurolle, R. Sigal; VillejuiflF Purpose: To evaluate the value of CT and MR in squamous cell carcinomas of the cheek at the pretherapeutic stage. Methods and Materials: Nine palients were reviewed with CT only (5), MRI only(1), CT and MR (3). Extension of the tumor was evaluated for the following sites: buccinator museie, mandible, maxilla, retromolar trigone, and Iymph nodes. Results: Imaging was severely hampered by dental material by CT in only one case, and only slightly difficult in 6 cases. Two patients had a localized lesion of the cheek, confined to the buccinator muscle. Six patients had an extension to the retromolar trigone. Mandibular and maxillary lesions were excluded in all cases. One patient only had also suspicious Iymph nodes. Surgery was performed in 8 cases and correlated with imaging data. Conclusion: CT and MRI are useful in the pretherapeutic study of cheek squamous cell carcinomas in spite of dental material artefacts. They are particularly useful to evaluate the extension to the retromolar trigone which is partially or completely clinically occult.Purpose: To define possibilities of different X-ray examination methods in diagnosing tumours of the upper respiratory tract, indications for different X-ray methods used. Methods and Materials: In period 1993-1998 1008 patients with the head and neck pathology were examined. According to the facts of Cancer registry in this period in Lithuanian Oncology Center for 223 patients larynx cancer, for 189 pharynx cancer, for 596 patients have been diagnosed non-malignant tumours, inflammatory processes, cysts, polyposis, etc. 2305 paranasal sinuses roentgenogrammes, oropharyngotomogrammes, 55 computed tomogrammes were made by Siemens Somatom Plius 4. Results: Indications for different X-ray methods used in diagnostics of upper respiratory tract tumours has been worked out. Using the method of oropharyngotomography it was ascertained that in case a malignant tumour is located in the nasal cavity, paranasal sinus, pharynx or nasopharynx, the soft palate is noted to be thickened intensively. Methods and Materials: 22 patients, with laryngeal earcinoma, underwent MRI examination with a superconductive magnet (1.5 T) first with SE T1* and T2w sequences, then with SE T1w enhanced sequence. Surgery was considered the gold standard. MR images were evaluated by lwo radiologists during a single session, using a multiple choice form, to evaluate the presence of infiltration of the following anatomie structures: supra/infra-glottal spaces, anterior commissure, vocal cords, Morgagni's ventricle, epiglottis, arytenoid eartilage, cricothyroid eartilage, thyroepiglottal compartment and paraglottal space. The form was expressed as a TNM staging. Results: There were no statistically differences belween the two techniques. MRI with contrast medium had a higher diagnostic accuracy than conventional MRI in the evaluation of the supraglottal space (2 patients) and paraglottal space (2 patients), without any diferences with regards to the T parameter. Conclusion: MR imaging had a higher diagnostic accuracy in T1 and T4 stages but contrast medium did not give more diagnostic information. 1331 Current value of double-contrast pharyngography and computed tomography in the primary diagnosis of hypopharyngeal, oropharyngeal and supraglottic tumors M. Keberle, W. Kenn, A. Tschammler, G. Wiltenberg , D. Hahn; Purpose: The current value of double-contrast pharyngography (DCP) and computed tomographY'{eT) in the primary diagnosis of hypopharyngeal , oropharyngeal and supraglottic tumors is determined. Methods and Materials: DCP of 151 patients and CT of 99 patients were retrospectively examined by 2 experienced unbiased radiologists using a standardised list with all relevant anatomieal subregions and the T-classification. The results were compared with direct and indirect laryngoscopy (DL and IL) and the pathological diagnosis. The collective was composed of 22 carcinoma and 1 hemangioma of the hypopharynx , 20 carcinoma of the supragloltic larynx, 44 of the oropharynx , 2 of the upper esophagus, 2 lymphomas and 60 normal cases. The interobserver variability was determined . Results: For DCP a sensitivity of 75.0% and a specificity of 86.7% was determined. The analysis of the inter-observer variability yielded good conformity (K =0.72) regarding a tumor presence. DCP and IL together",

Methods and Materials: Retrospectively, 105 conventional CTs performed on Somatom Plus or Somatom Plus S (5 mm slice thickness and table feed, 200 ml Lv. contrast medium) were analyzed. In a prospective study (Somatom Plus 4, 3 mm slice Ihickness, 5 mm table feed, 1.5 mm increment, 150 ml l.v contrast medium, 70 s delay) 110 patienls were included. Additionally, coronal reformations were obtained. All CT results were compared with histological findings.Results: In conventional CT, there was an accuracy of 84% in T staging (T1 62%, T2 78%, T3 82%, T4 94%) and of 86% in N staging (NO 80%, N1 72%, N2 89%, N3 95%). Spiral CT showed an accuracy of 85% in T staging (T1 66%, T2 74%, T3 88%, T4 95%) and of 86% in N staging (NO 82%, N1 79%, N2 88%, N3 95%). There were no statistically signifieant differences in the accuracy of spiral and conventional CT in patients with oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal tumors. Conclusion: In spite of the missing statistieally signifieant differences in the accuracy of both CT methods, spiral CT shold be prefered. There is a tendency of improved diagnosis of T1, NO and N1 stages. The advantages in the CT technique are known.1333 Videofluorographic evaluation of swallowing disorders In head and neck cancer patients treated with radiation therapy M. Anooshiravani, M. Becker, P. Dulguerov, F. Esteve, A. Allal, F. Terrier; GenevaICHPurpose: Head and neck cancer patients treated with radiation therapy often present swallowing disorders that could influence their daily quality of Iife. By apreeise analysis of these disorders, videofluorography (VFG) allows a belter therapeutic choice. In this retrospective study we have analysed morphologie and functional abnormalities induced by radiation therapy. Methods and Materials: 407 patients were examined with VFG belween April 1995 and April 1998. Among them sixteen had been referred for swallowing disorders following radiation therapy as an exclusive treatment for head and neck cancer. Results: All of the 16 subjects presented functional abnormalities and only lwo had morphologie changes (one benign stricture and one tumour recurrence) The functional disorders consisted of palatal deficiency, pharyngeal and epiglottic hypomotility, and cricopharyngeal dysfunction. Fifteen patients had aspirated during the study, nine of them being \"silent\" aspirations. Conclusion: Dysphagia after high-dose radiation therapy for head and neck cancer indicates mostly functional rather than morphologie abnormalities. VFG enables the detection of Iife-threatening silent aspirations and forms the basis for further therapeutic decisions.14:10 1334 Computed tomography diagnosis of inorganic neck tumors G.G.

The patients were followed up by ultrasound. Results: Sufficient shunt was performed in all patients. One patient died of liver failure with fully open shunt. The other patients were asymptomatic and no complications related to the procedure occurred. The mean follow up was 6.8 months (range 2-10 months). There was one case of asymptomatic hepatic vein stenosis which occurred in 2 months. The other shunts are without stenoses. Conelusion: Our early clinical results support experimental results reported in literature. The PTFE stentgraft is technically feasible and safe for TIPS creation and TIPS patency may be improved. The use of stentgrafts should still be considered investigational because of limited experience.1335 Correlation of angiographie results in transjugular portosystemie shunts with maeroseopie and histopathologie findings G. Sodner, A. Kreczy, A. Chemelli, P. Waldenberger, W. Jaschke;Purpose: To evaluate angiographic finding in transjugular portosystemic shunts (TIPS) with macroscopical and histopathological findings. Methods and Materials: Angiography of 24 patients with restenosis were evaluated regarding to the location of the stenosis. Macroscopical and histopathological evaluations were performed on 8 TIPS containing livers. Results: Stenosis due to pseudo-intimal hyperplasia were found in 16 patients in the midpart of the stent, proximal from the draining portal vein and in 8 patient stenosis were found at theoutflow part of the TIPS, proximal from the draining hepatic vein. Macroscopical arrd histopathological examinations of the stenosis revealed fibrinous layers. Stenosis at the venous side of the TIPS appeared thicker than at the area of the portal inflow. No pseudo-intimal hyperlasia was seen in the portal entry of the stent. Conelusion: Pseudo-intimal hyperplasia is always seen proximally of the draining portal and venous vein inside the stent. Turbulent flow from draining vessels, induced by the stent struds may are the cause for stent stenosis.1336 Dur experienee in 327 TIPS E. Zanon, A. Mancini, F. Pedrazzini, A. Saroncelli, C. Gazzera, M. Garruso, R. Gallo, M. Grosso; Turin, Cuneo/I Purpose: To present our experience in 327 TIPS procedures performed using different types of stent. Methods and Materials: We treated 327 cirrhotic patients (117 female, 210 male), (45, 202, 80 Child A, S, Cl. The indications were: 218 digestive hemorrage (52 emergency), 99 intractable ascites, 7 pre-OLT and 3 Sudd-Chiari syndrome. Patients were monitored by US-Doppler, angiography and esophago-gastroscopy. Results: We obtained technical success in 324/327 cases (99.1%).We had respectively 30/324 (9.2%) early and 52/274 (18.9%) late stenoses-occlusions of the shunt. 12-month primary patency rate was 70%, while 12-month assisted patency rate was 94%. Reduction of refractory ascites was obtained in 63/99 (63.6%). The incidence of encephalopathy was 41/324 (14.2%), only 6 severe. Mortality rate was 89/324 (27.4%). Conelusion: TIPS is a safe and effective method to treat patients with portal hypertension and to reduce refractory ascites. An accurate follow-up is indispensable to manage steno-occlusions of the shunt with optimal percentage of resolution and long-term shunt patency rate.1337 PTFE stent graft for TIPS: short-term resultsA.

Methods and Materials: Setween 1995 and 1997 Cragg Endopro orPassager MISS stentgrafts were used for the creation of TIPSS in eight male patients, 35 to 59 years of age (mean, 48 years). All patients suffered from recurrent variceal bleeding andl or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. Seven stentgrafts were dilated to a diameter of 10 mm, one to 12 mm. Follow-up was performed with duplex ultrasound, c1inical assessment and angiography. Results: The technical success rate to create a TIPSS was 100%. The pressure gradient decreased from mean 25 mm Hg to 12 mm Hg. One patient underwent liver transplantation following TIPSS thrombosis, histological analysis demonstrated bile incorporation into the occluding thrombus. In 7 of 8 patients TIPSS dysfunction occured between 2 days and 3 years (mean 362 +-331 days) after stentgraft placement. In one patient the TIPSS is still primary patent (224 days after creation). Conelusion: The primary use of polyester covered stentgrafts for TIPSS did neither completely prevent bile leakage nor increase the primary patency rate in our small series.1339 Portal vein oeelusion and embolization as a tool to indueeIiver hypertrophy: teehnieal aspeets and experienees in 15 patients V. Nicolas, G. Krupski, M. Malago, M.G. Henschel, X. Rogiers, C.E. Sroelsch; Bochum/DPurpose: Hilar hepatic tumors as e.g. the Klatskin-tumor often tend to be irresectable due to small left hepatic volume and therefore at high risk for liver failure after extended right resection. Since portal venous occlusion facilitates liver hypertrophy, this technique can be used to increase left hepatic volume thus enabling extended right resection. We present our radiological and surgical experience of percutaneous portal vein embolization and hilar portal branch Iigation concerning induction of liver hypertrophy with respect to surgical outcome. Methods and Materials: To date, 15 patients (11 Klatskin-tu, 3 colorectal hepatic metastases, 1 metastatic adrenal carcinoma) were treated either by surgeons (hepatic ligation, n = 8) or radiologists (embolization, n = 7). 12 of these patients had extended right resection at intervals of 4 to 13 weeks. Results: There was a statistically significant increase in the volume of the left hepatic lobe of more than 100 ml. One patient died due to Iiver failure caused by extensive fally liver degeneration and reduced functional capacity prior to resection. Another patient, although with a significant increase of the liver volume, had a prolonged compromised liver function.Conclusion: Both surgery and percutaneous portal vein embolization lead to significant increase of the liver volume thus enabling extended resection. Aspects of tumor biology and procedural technique will be discussed.(Submitted byInternet)    1340 Metallic stents in the treatment of malignant biliaryobstruction: 8 years follow-up H. Alfke, M. Hoppe, B. Alfke, H.-J. Wagner; Marburg/D Purpose: To study the long term results of percutaneous metallic stent placement for the treatment of patients with malignant biliary obstruction and to evaluate for risk factors of reocclusion. Patients and Methods: From 1990 to 1998 we treated 130 consecutive patients (age 68.4 +-12.5 [30-92]). Lesion location was hilar in 54%, bile duct in 41%, and other in 7%. Underlying causes of malignant 30 day mortality was 11%. The mean primary patency rate according to Kaplan-Meier was 108 days. The comparison of the mean patency rates for the different underlying tumors revealed: 550 days for cholangiocarcinoma, 83 for pancreatic carcinoma, 121 for gallbladder carcinoma, and 92 for Iiver metastasis with a trend for a better prognosis in patients with cholangiocarcinoma (p = 0.057). Conclusion: Metal stents offer sufficient long term relief of jaundice due to malignant biliary obstruction. There is a trend for better primary patency with cholangiocarcinoma. (Submitted by Internet) 1341 Malignant biliary duct obstruction: 5 years experience with wallstents and radiation therapy -prospective randomised study V. Valek, P. Hrobaf; Brno/CZ Purpose: We evaluate the effect of radiation therapy including intraluminal iridium-192 on survival in patients with malignant biliary strictures treated with Wallstents in prospective randomises study. Methods and Materials: 37 patients with unresectable malignant biliary obstruction were treated with percutaneous Wallstents implantation followed by intraluminal Ir-192 brachytherapy (mean dose 30 Gy) and external actinotherapy (mean dose 50 Gy) and 29 patients only with Wallstents insertion in prospective randomise study. Results: From the group of patients treated by combined radiotherapy and Wallstent implantation died 31 (mean survival of 9.1 months), 6 still alive. From the group of patients treated only by Wallstent insertion 25 died (mean survival 7.6 months), 4 still alive. Conclusion: Our results shows, that combined radiation therapy could extend the survival in the patients with unresectable biliary obstruction. 1342 Therapy for benign biliary obstructions with use of balloon-expandable and self-expanding metallic stents: long-term follow-up I.K. Tesdal, T. Roeren, J. Koepke, W. Jaschke, M. Georgi; Mannheim/D, Purpose: To discuss the role of different metallic stents in the treatment of benign obstructive jaundice. Methods and Materials: Between 1989 and 1996, 21 patients with benign obstructive jaundice were treated by transhepatic placement of metallic stents (Wallstent: n =9; tantalum Strecker stent: n =4; Memotherm stent: n = 1; Palmaz stent: n = 9). Sixteen patients presented strictures not responding to balloon angioplasty (postsurgical: n =14; chronic cholangitis: n =2). Five patients were, from different reasons, treated primarily with stent angioplasty without predilation.Results: Twelve out of 20 patients (one patient was lost to follow-up) are alive with a mean survival of 43.2 \u00b1 5.7 months without any 30day mortality. Reintervention due to recurrent obstructive jaundice was necessary in 10 patients (50%), and the mean stent patency (MSP) was 34.2 \u00b1 7.2 months. The Palmaz stent was the most effective in achieving short and long-term patency with a MSP of 35.3 \u00b1 0.8 months, versus 27.7 \u00b1 11.2 months for Wallstent and 7 \u00b1 2.3 months for Strecker stents. In 4 patients the stents were removed and the biliary-enteric anastomoses revised after 3, 6, 9 and 71 months. Conclusion: The treatment of benign biliary strictures with metallic stents is associated with high long-term obstruction and reintervention rates. The Palmaz stent is the most effective in achieving long-term patency.1343Radiologie detection and treatment of biliary complications in the pediatric post-Iiver transplant patient Y. Maetani, K. Itoh, F. Ametani, T. Shibata, T. Tabuchi, J. Konishi; Purpose: To evaluate the radiological findings and the causes of biliary complications after Iiving related partialliver transplantation (LRLT) and to show the interventional procedures against the complications. Methods and Materials: From June 1990 to July 1998, 380 cases of LRLT were performed in our hospital. Choledochojejunostomy was performed in all cases. Among them 47 percutaneous transhepatic cholangiograms (PTC) were obtained in 41 recipients (10.8%) to confirm a biliary complication. Most of them were children with the mean age of 9.6 y.o. Results: There were 32 anastomotic strictures caused by anastomotic failure or hepatic arterial thrombosis (HAT), and 14 intrahepatic strictures caused by ABO blood group incompatibility, HAT, or chronic rejection. Intrahepatic biloma was shown in 5 cases. As the treatment, percutaneous transhepatic biliary catheter drainage was required in 38 cases. Among them, percutaneous transhepatic balloon dilation was performed in 26. Drainage catheter was removed with the improvement of stricture in 6, catheter drainage still continues in 14. Surgical revision was performed in 13. Conclusion: PTC is mandatory in the diagnosis of biliary complications after LRLT and interventional procedures are helpful in the treatment of these complications. 1344 Interventional radiology in the treatment of liver echinococcosis SA Dadvani, A.N. Lotov, 0.5. Schkrob, G.H. Musaev, V.N. Avakian, JA Legon'kov, A.M. Bronstein, S.K. Ternovoj, S.A. Kondrashin; Moscow/C/S Purpose: To assess the efficacy of minimally invasive methods in the treatment of liver hydatid disease. Methods and Materials: In our surgical clinic from 1986 to 1998 38 patients with liver echinococcosis underwent treatment. The age of the patients changed from 3 till 69 years. The main imaging methods were US, CT and electron-beam CT, serologic evaluation. In 29 (76.3%) patients cyst was solitary single-chamber, in 6 (15.8%) -multiple singlechamber, 2 (5.3%) -solitary multi-chamber and in 1 (2.6%) -solitary cysts in liver and right lung. In all patients was fulfilled percutaneous drainage of the cyst under ultrasound and f1uoroscopic control by complex stylet-catheter. Cyst cavity was processing with 20.0% NaCI solution or our own special mixture (last 10 patients) at 15 min duration. After microbiologically proven parasite destruction we expand the punction channel diameter with telescopic dilators up to 32 F. Then we destroy and aspirate chytinic membrane of the cyst under endoscopic control. In the postoperative period patients underwent three courses of prophylactic peroral therapy with Albendazol. Results: All patients were treated with good results without serious complications with mean drainage duration of 16 \u00b1 3 days. Followup in 4-7 months in 5 (13.2%) patients reveal residual cavity required percutaneous punction. In one patient in subcutaneous fat formatted new cyst after early drainage removal.Conclusion: The received results surpass results of traditional surgical treatment. CONTRAST MEDIA EI 1806 MR contrast agents: MR angiography arteries were measured. Image quality was assessed based on a 4point scale. Results: Bolus characteristics revealed a significantly (p < 0.05) higher maximum SNR in the 'light' (34.9 \u00b1 9.2) compared to the 'heavy' group (23.4 \u00b1 5.2). Difference in time to maximum SNR was statistically not significant. Quantitative assessment of the 3D MRA demonstrated significantly higher arterial SNR values in the 'light' group (p < 0.05). Image quality was rated better by at least one grade in all four light subjects, in the 'heavy' group, in one subject the renal arteries were not diagnostic. Conclusion: These data suggest that dosing for contrast-enhanced 3D MRA should be weight-adjusted instead of based on fixed volumes. 1345 Evaluation of arterial first pass contrast medium dynamics as a function of intravenous injection parameters M. Boos, K. Scheffler, R. Haselhorst, E. Reese, P. Huber, J. Fr\u00f6hlich, G.M. Bongartz; Basel/CH Purpose: To evaluate the arterial first pass contrast medium dynamics at the descendic aorta (DAo) in dependence from injection parameters. Methods and Materials: Using an ultra-fast 2D GE-sequence (Siemens Vision\u00ae, 1.5 Tl, 180 cross-sectional images of the DAo (1 slice/sec) were obtained. Several dosages of Gd (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 mmol/kg) and NaCI flush volumes (15, 30, 60 ml) were applied to a group of 4 normal volunters (BW 50 kg). The flow rates were varied (0.5, 1, 2 and 3 ml/s) using a mechanical MR injector. The signal intensity to time curve of DAo was evaluated. The bolus arrival time (BAT), the maximal signal to noise ratio (S/N), the bolus time length (BL; 80 and 75% maximum intensity duration) and the bolus time length dilution constant (BTDC were calculated. Results: Pierro, R. Kristy, J. Baker, K. Wolfe-Kerker, L. Kratz; St. Louis, MOIUSAPurpose: Four studies were conducted to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of OptiMARK\u00ae (Gadoversetamide Injection). Methods and Materials: The studies enrolled 245 subjects; normal volunteers; subjects with CNS or Iiver pathology, with or without renal insufficiency; subjects requiring hemodialysis. Each received 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 or 0.7 mmol/kg OptiMARK or placebo. Results: A brief distribution phase is completed by 1 hour post-dose. Analysis indicates OptiMARK kinetics are linear over the range of 0.1 to 0.7 mmol/kg. The data demonstrated no difference due to gender in gadoversetamide elimination. Renal impairment increased the half-Iife. Serum clearance of gadolinium was not dose related. No significant metabolism of gadoversetamide occurs. A good correlation was observed between total and renal dearance of gadoversetamide. Renal impairment affects the rate of gadoversetamide excretion, but not the extent. After 3 dialysis sessions, 98% of the drug had been cleared from the circulation. Conclusion: The pharmacokinetics of OptiMARK are not affected by gender, age or disease state, other than renal. OptiMARK is eliminated into the urine and is not metabolized. Renal impairment decreases the rate, but not the extent, of OptiMARK excretion. OptiMARK can be efficiently removed from the circulation by hemodialysis.",

Methods and Materials: Twenty-five neurologically non-diseased, elderly subjects (mean age 78 years), were prospectively enroled. All subjects underwent a complete Geriatrics Comprehensive Assessment (Tinetti's scale, MMSE, GDS) and non-enhanced CT examination of the brain. CT parameters were: 22 contiguous 5 mm thick slices; 205 mAs, 140 kV. Leukoaraiosis (LA) was assessed on CT images by means of a quantitative semi-automated computer-aided method. Data were compared by using Student t test, Pearson c2 and multiple linear regression analysis (MLR) Results: At univariate analysis, no relation was found among LA load (expressed in cm3) and sex, age and cognitive level. A significant inverse correlation was found in MLR between LA load and walking performance, adjusted for age, cognitive level and risk factors. Conclusion: In a population of normal elderly subjects, in whom the quantitative method shows low LA load, a sub-clinical impairment in walking performance is detectable. We hypothise that an increased LA load may cause more severe motor disturbances of c1inical relevance.(Submitted by Internet)",

Karonen, K. Partanen, R Vanninen, P. Vainio, J. Nuutinen, R Roivainen, J. Sivenius, S. Soimakallio, H.J. Aronen; Kuopio/FINPurpose: To evaluate development of haemorrhagia and different patterns of contrast enhancement in MRI during the first week in acute stroke. Methods and Materials: MRI was performed on 35 acute stroke patients (age range 48-87, mean 72 yrs) three times: 1) on the day of admission \u00ab24 hrs after c1inical ictus), 2) on the second day and 3) after one week. The MRI protocol consisted of T1, T2, diffusion weighted, perfusion weighted and postcontrast T1 imaging. The postcontrast T1 images were obtained immediatelly after perfusion imaging (not considered here) the dose of gadolinium being 0.2 mmol/kg. Results: On the second day, haemorrhagic changes were detected in 17-34% of cases and in 52-76% of cases after one week, depending on the imaging sequence. In postcontrast T1 imaging, the following patterns of contrast enhancement were detected in different time points (1S! day/2 nd day/1 week): intravascular 73%/85%/72%, meningeal 33%/39%/44%, gyriform 9%/12%/47%, transcortical 9%/21 %/63%, miscellaneous parenchymal 18%/24%/66% and sulcal enhancement 9%/9%/22%. Conclusion: According to MRI findings, haemorrhagic transformation was fairly common in initially non-haemorrhagic strokes. Intravascular and meningeal enhancement was often present after one week from stroke onset. On the other hand, parenchymal enhancement sometimes appeared even on the first two days.1359 Detection of acute and subacute intracranial hemorrhage with MRI at 1.5 T: an experimental study in rabblt O.

Additionally we reconstructed the acquired images in all orthogonal planes. Results: In all patients absence or hypoplasia of the olfactory tract or bulb could be c1early demonstrated. Additionally interruption or total absence of the olfactory sulcus was easily visualized. Conclusion: T1 and T2 weighted volume-sequences with multiplanar reconstruction are both valuable tools in imaging of Kallmann's syndrome.1362 Rostral vermian cortical dysplasia: a new entity Ph. Demaerel, K. Op de beeck, G. Wilms; Leuven/B Purpose: To describe the imaging appearances of a previously unreported congenital malformation. Methods and Materials: Fifteen patients with rostral vermian dysplasia were identified. Imaging included T2-weighted axial and coronal images. A 3D gradient echo sequence was obtained in three patients. These images were reformatted in all three planes using 1 mm slices in order to accurately localize the abnormalities. Results: The defective foliation and fissuration of the culmen and central lobule of the anterior lobe of the vermis extended into the hemispheres in 5/15 patients. Thickening of the cerebellar cortex and supratentorial congenital abnormalities were observed in respectively 4/15 and 3/15 patients. The clinical presentation was variable but one patient was asymptomatic. Conclusion: Rostral vermian dysplasia varied in degree of severity with a spectrum of abnormalities ranging from mild to extensive changes. In 8/15 patients there was no correlation between the clinical findings and the MR appearances. Because the symptoms were never life threatening, no pathological correlation could be obtained. Experimental studies on rats and hamsters have demonstrated similar vermian abnormalities after 6-hydroxydopamine treatment. We suggest that the abnormalities may result from an intrauterine insult leading to a destruction of meningeal cells and a destabilization of the cerebellar surface.15:10 1363 Multimodality imaging analysis in schizophrenia C.

This limitation is especially troublesome with malignant lesions. Either dynamic MR imaging during the arterial, portal and delayed phases after the administration of extraeellular-distributed gadolinium ehelates, or specifie liver-target agents (like SPIO, MnDPDP and some gadolinium chelates) improve the ability of MR to detect small masses. On the other hand, the semiologie analysis of liver lesions must include architeetural, dynamie perfusion and signal intensity characteristics (mainly with T1 in phase and oppose-phase, proton density and T2 weighted images). With this data, MR is able to eharacterize most Iiver lesions, thus redueing the need for aspiration biopsy. The role, accuracy and pitfalls of MR will be presented. Learning Objectives: (1) To understand the different MR techniques useful in the study of focal Iiver lesions. (2) To familiarize with different non-specific and specific contrast media.

Scifo, E. Garuti, A. Dei Maschio; Milan/I Purpose: The evaluation of the right ventricular myocardium with classical sequences is often difficult due to motion artifacts. The purpose of this work was the comparison of ECG triggered breath-hold multishot FSE black-blood sequences with new experimental double inversion pulses (double IR-MSFSE) and conventional ECG triggered SE TIW sequences in the depiction of right venticular myocardium. Methods and Materials: 25 consecutive patients were evaluated at 1.5 T (GE Signa Echo-Speed) with short axis ECG triggered SE TIW sequences (TRITE = 80% RE/15 msec) and with ECG triggered breathhold multi shot FSE sequences with double inversion pulses (double IR-MSFSE) (TRITE =2 RR/40 msec, ETL =32). The first inversion pulse is not slice selective and is used to create black-blood, while the second IR causes T1 weghting (TI =600 msec). Two short axis planes were obtained with each sequence. Right ventricle thickness, and presence of artifacts were evaluated by two observers in conference. Results: With conventional SE sequences the right ventricular myocardium was detectable and measurable in 37/50 sections, with a mean thickness of 6.6 mm. Artifacts were graded 1.5. With MSFSE sequences the right ventricular myocardium was detectable and measurable in 42/50 sections, with a mean thickness of 6 mm. Artifacts were graded 0.3. Conclusion: The new experimental MSFSE sequences are usefull in suppressing artifacts and give a very goOO depiction of right ventricular myocardium. 16:20 1377 The role of MRI in the diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia G.P.

The diagnosis of EMF was made by imaging findings including echocardiography, cardiac catheterazition, angiocardiography and operation. Results: The patients were divided into three subtypes: RVEMF, LVEMF and BVEMF. The findings of EMF on MRI as folIows: 1. RVEMF (6): RV is smaller and deformed with hypokinetic contraction of the ventricular wall and thickening of endocardium. The obliteration of apex, shortening of inflow tract and dilatation of outflow tract and the moderate to a great quantity of tricuspid regurgitation are depicted by eine MRI. The right atrium remarkably enlarged and vena cava dilated. 2. LVEMF (1): The obtuse apex, thickening endocardium and multiple outpouching wall of LV are seen, and mitral regurgitation and hypokinetic wall of LV are depicted also on cine MR imaging, with marked enlargement of left atrium and dilatation of pulmonary artery and vein. 3. BVEMF (3): Although both findings of RVEMF and LVEMF are present, one side of the heart is dominator. Of them, one case there is mural thrombus located in apex of RV.

Accuracy of distance measurements using MPR of ns-Fastcard was determined. Additionally, three radiologists rated the presentation of cardiac structures and anastomoses or baffles. Results: Distance measurements using MPR of ns-Fastcard are cornparable to those using SE. Compared to SE sequences ns-Fastcard images reveal superior myocardium/blood contrast espeeially in cases of low blood flow. Due to the usually oblique orientation of anastomoses and baffles, MPR of ns-Fastcard are superior to SE sequences using three orthogonal planes. Conclusion: ns-Fastcard with MPR offers the possibility of retrospective and interactive determination of slice direction and superior myocardium/blood contrast in low blood flow. Therefore, this sequence is better than conventional standard plane SE sequences for evaluation of cardiac morphology.1380 Evaluation of isolated ventricular non-compaction in chUdren A. von Smekal, G. Junga, S. Kneifei, J. Schwitter, H. Steinert, U. Bauersfeld, GK von Schullhess, B. Marincek; ZurichlCHPurpose: Isolated ventricular non-compaction (IVNC) is a rare congenital cardiomyopathy with poor prognosis due to heart failure and ventricular arrhythmias. It was to evaluate morphological and functional changes of IVNC. Methods and Materials: Five children with IVNC were examined. All but one child were clinically asymptomatic at diagnosis and during follow-up. Cardiac murmurs were found in four and dyspnea in one patient. PET perfusion 13NH3 and metabolie 18FDG studies were performed. IVNC was diagnosed by echocardiography and MRI. Coronary arteries were normal in all children, all underwent electrophysiologic testing. Results: MRI visualized best the extend of IVNC related morphological changes. PET demonstrated decreased myocardial blood flow at rest and after intravenous dipyridamole application in non-compacted myocardium (0.84 ml/min/g and 2.61 ml/min/g) compared to normal myocardium (1.09 mllmin/g and 4.83 ml/min/g) indicating locally impaired coronary-flow-reserve. Electrophysiologic testing revealed late potentials in three and abnormal OT dispersion in one child. Conclusion: The combination and fusion of PET and MRI allows qood correlation of regional morphological and functional changes in IVNC. The study results demonstrate microvascular dysfunction causing myocardial ischemia in children with IVNC in the affected areas.1381 The influence of vibration on echocardiographic parameters M.

Methods and Materials: MRI was performed pre-and 4-7 d postlasertherapy in 30 patients with end-stage coronary vessel disease. Breathhold, multislice, ultrafast turbo-FLASH gradient echo (30 s acquisition time) and T-1-weighted spin echo sequences were acquired ECGtriggered before and after injection of Gadolinium-OTPA (0.15 mmollkg). First pass perfusion was evaluated on the basis of qualitative and quantitative analysis. Myocardial signal alterations and wall changes were also depicted. Quantitative analysis was based on contrast-tonoise (C/N) data obtained from operator defined \"Region of Interests\".Results: Visualisation of laser induced channels was not possible. Native scans obtained before and after lasertherapy revealed no significant change with regard to the qualitative analysis.Both qualitative and quantitative analysis demonstrated a posttherapeutic increase of C/N in both left ventricular myocardium (64.4 pre-, 89.1 post-Iasertherapy; p =0.06) and septum in the majority of cases. No significant difference between laser-treated left myocardium and untreated septum was observed (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Visualisation of increased myocardial enhancement in laser-treated left ventricular myocardium was evident in the majority of cases on the basis of qualitative and quantitative analysis. The MRI-technique used, enabled a first, limited depiction of laser-induced myocardial changes.

Patients and Methods: Since 1988 184 patients (pts.) were refered to the MR unit for the evaluation of a suspected cardiac or paracardiac mass. In 44 out of 184 pts. histological specimens of the tumor were available to serve as a basis for the assessment of tumor characteristics by MRI, whieh was performed using eertain morphologie eriteria (i.e.: signal enhancement, invasiveness). Results: Histologie examination showed a malignant tumor in 18 of 44 pts., which was in accordance with MRI in 14 pts.. The most common diagnosis included metastatic tumor formation (10 pts.), sarcoma (4 pts.) and lymphoma (2 pts.). 26 tumors were classified histologically as benign, MRI yielded the correet dignity assessment in 25 pts., including myxoma (6 pts.), thrombi (4 pts.) and granulomatous tissue as in case of tuberculosis (5 pts.). Overall sensitivity of MRI for assessment of malignancy/benignity in cardiac tumors was 72% and specificity was 96%, respectively.Conclusion: This retrospective analysis shows the high diagnostic impact of MRI in patients with cardiac tumors.",

Thelen;Purpose: to evaluate breath-hold MR techniques for assessment of hemodynamic changes in patients with ehrenie thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.Methods and Materials: 10 patients with severe pulmonary hypertension due to thromboembolic disease were examined before and after pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. MR imaging was performed at 1.5 T using the body-array coil. For assessment of hemodynamics, a velocity-encoded segmented gradient-echo through the pulmonary arteries and a segmented eine gradient-echo sequence along the short axis of the left and right ventricle were performed. Further analysis was done at aseparate work station using the Argus software V 2.0. Flowmeasuremants were compared to the invasively measured pulmonary arterial pressures and vasculare resistances. Results: Flow-measurements c1early demonstrated a significant increase in pulmonary arterial flow postoperatively (peak velocity: +84%). This corresponded to the invasively measured reduction of pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance (p < 0.001). Cine imaging revealed a sigificant increase in right ventricular stroke volume and ejection fraction. Conclusion: Breath-hold segmented gradient-echo techniques enable non-invasive assessment of pulmonary hemodynamics in patients with chronic thromboembolic disease that undergo surgery. Further evaluation of pulmonary hemodynamics by rapid MRI-techniques may replace invasive procedures.Conclusion: The vasodilation was significantly lower in the group with NNCA than in SX group (p < 0.05).

Whereas previously the majority af the long-term devices were inserted by surgeans there has been a tendency in many centres for the procedure ta be performed radiolog ically. There are several reasons for this including shorter procedure times and lower complication rates. In addition , espec ially in those patients who have undergone previous central venous catheter insertion , patency of the peripheral and central veins can be easily confirmed by ultrasound or contrast venography prior to attempted catheterization. In those individuals in whom the more usual venous accesses are occluded, other techniques (for example a translumbar puncture of the inferior vena cava) may be performed under radiolog ical guidance . Radiolog ists are in an ideal position to provide a full venous access serv ice; many of the early and late complications of these central venous catheters such as occlusion , catheter breakage and venous thrombosis may be managed by using radiological techniques.

Methods and Materials: 600 cerebral CTs were evaluated for indication, quality, sensitivity, specificity and therapeutic consequences. Before CT neurological examination was routinely performed. CT results were correlated to the e1inical indications for CT, neurological findings and posttherapeutic/postoperative and discharge diagnoses. In 23% MRI and in 4% cerebral angiography followed CT during the hospital stay. MRI confirmed CT diagnoses in 62%, angiography in 50%. Results: The common indications were cerebral bleeding (48%), skull fracture (15%), cerebral infarction (14%), space occupying lesion (8%), cerebral infection (6%) and hydrocephalus (4%). The correlation of CT diagnoses and discharge diagnoses was relatively high with a specificity of 80% and a sensitivity of 81%. 12% of the cranial CTs were followed by surgical intervention, 8% :S;12 h, 4% >12 h post CT. 5% were followed by an external ventricular shunting. Conclusion: High sensitivity and specificity of cranial CT in the emergency department in establishing a diagnosis confirms the important role of CT as a primary diagnostic method. Timely, reproducable and precise diagnosis outweighes increased costs and facilitates a shortened hospital stay.1408 Computed tomography in relation to the presence and type of skull fracture in patients with acute head trauma R. Maksimovic, B. Goldner, M. Janicijevic, T. Stosic, M. Dunjic, D. Stankovic, M. Perovic; Belgrade/YU Purpose: The role of skull fracture of in assessing patients with acute head trauma (AHT) is still controversial. The purpose of the study was to further investigate the possibility of skull fracture in predicting CT changes in patients with AHT. Methods and Materials: Our study group included 194 patients withAHT, mostly men (62.4%), mean age 46.5 \u00b1 24.1 (range 1-91) years, who were admitted to the emergency department in the three months period. All patients underwent clinical workup, X-ray, and CT scans. Patients were divided into group 1, with skull fracture with 37.1% (72/194) patients and group 2, without skull fracture, which ineluded 62.9% (122/194) patients. The difference of frequencies between groups was evaluated using Chi 2 test, and t test when appropriate. Results: In group 1, linear fracture was present in 83.3% (60/72), while depressed fracture was notified in 16.7% (12/72) patients. In group 1, contusion and/or haematoma was found in 37.9% (25/66) patients, Also, there was statistical significant difference between frequencies of patients with obliterated basal cisterns in group 1 {40.9% (27/66)} and group 2 {23.5% (28/119)}, (Chi 2 =6.1, P < 0.05). Extracerebral haematoma was present more frequently in group 1 {37.1 % (26/70)} than in group 2 {23.8% (29/122)}, (Chi 2 = 3.9, p < 0.05). There was no statistical significant difference among these groups with respect to present of blood in ventrieles and subarachonid space, as weil as to Glasgow Coma Score and age.

Zlatidou, K. Dagianta; Athens/GR Purpose: Gunshot injuries to the head carry a high percentage of skull penetration resulting in death. As intracranial gunshot-associated lesions can be revealed by CT, surgical intervention can be Iife-saving in severe head trauma. We evaluated the efficacy of computed tomography of the head in depicting trauma-associated pathology in victims with gunshot wounds. Methods and Materials: Eighteen patients with gunshot injuries to the head, admitted in our Hospital in aperiod of the 16 last months were evaluated with plain radiographs and computed tomography. All but one were young male adults. Sixteen cases were assaults and two suicidal attempt. Results: Skull fractures were detected in 14 patients. Brain contusions were present in 15 and subdural hematomas in 9 patients. Midline shift was estimated to be less than 10 mm in all cases. Paranasal sinuses involvement was present in 2 cases and orbital injury in one case. Entry and exit sites were identified by CT in all cases. Conclusion: Computed tomography may be used as a front line examination in gunshot wounds to the head, as it depicts projectile path and associated intracranial pathology and reveals subtle bone fractures. Operative or conservative management of the trauma victims is largely based on CT findings, so that neurosurgeons should be closely working with radiologists.1410 Delayed cerebral ischemia caused by traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage: computerized tomography evidence R. Maksimovic, B. Goldner, M. Janicijevic, S. Stankovic, D. Milovanovic; Belgrade/YU Purpose: This study provides findings of the influence of traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (tSAH) on the development of delayed cerebral ischemia detected by computerized tomography (CT) scans. Methods and Materials: Prospective study ineluded 194 patients, mostly men (62.4%), mean age 46.5 \u00b1 24.1 (range 1-91) years,with elosed head trauma (CHT). The amount of subarachnoid blood was estimated according to a modification of the criteria of Fisher. According to the clinical course, CT scans were repeated in patients who deteriorated during hospitalization. Results: Out of 194 patients, 60 (30.9%) patients had tSAH on admission CT scans. Unilateral tSAH was in 30% (18/60) patients while bilateral was present in 70% (42/60) patients with CHT. In five patients (8.3%), out of 60 with tSAH, delayed ischemic symptoms developed between days 4 and 16 after the head injury. They consisted of one patient (5.5%) out of 18 with unilateral tSAH and in four patients (9.5%) out of 42, with bilateral tSAH. The difference of patients with delayed ischemic symptoms between these two groups did not reach statistical significance (Chi2 = 1.6, P > 0.05). There was a close correlation between the main site and amount of the tSAH, according to the modified Fisher scale, and the location offocal ischemic areas on followup CT scans. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that delayed ischemia is dependent on massive tSAH, rather than its extensiveness. Furthermore, presence of delayed ischemia may be an important determinant of outcome in patients with CHT that could be easy recognized on CT scans.1411 Combined endovascular and surgical treatment of intracranial hematomas following middle cerebral artery aneurysm rupture E.

Digital image segmentation methods based on active contour modeling offer new possibilities for extracting features relevant for predicting intrahospital outcome in these patients. Methods and Materials: Our study group consisted of 194 patients who underwent clinical workup and in whom the first CT scan was analyzed. Analysis of CT images involved preprocessing (noise reduction and contrast enhancement by multiresolution wavelet technique) and segmentation (adaptive contour modeling -snakes). Using this method, lesion to brain (LBR) and ventricle to brain ratio (VBR) were obtained accurately. They were taken, with other CT and clinical variables as inputs to artificial neural networks trained to determine prognosis in patients with AHT. Results: LBR and VBR obtained by the proposed segmentation method were found, together with two c1inical and three additional CT variables, to be significant for predicting intrahospital outcome in patients with AHT (LBR -0.011 \u00b1 0.001 survivors vs 0.018 \u00b1 0.002 nonsurvivors; VBR -0.008 \u00b1 .0.002 survivors vs 0.005 \u00b1 0.003 nonsurvivors). Furthermore, in patients who did not survive LBR for lobar localization was greater than in patients with lesion in the basal ganglia or brainstem and fossa posterior.Conclusion: The extracted quantitative features (LBR and VBR) showed to be significant for predicting intrahospital mortality of patients with AHT. Thus, using active contour model -\"snakes\" it is possible to extract maximum information from available CT scans, and to obtain new data on vital status of these patients.17:201416 Cranial CTA on a multislice CT scanner in patients with dural sinus thrombosis: first clinical experiences F.

Methods and Materials: We examined 10 patients with c1inical suspicion of dural sinus thrombosis. All examinations were performed on a multi-slice scanner (multirow-detector system) prototype (\"Somatom Plus 4 VZ\", Siemens). The images were compared with the results, obtained with digital subtraction angiography. The images were read by two observers in consensus. Results: CTA of cranial vessels -obtained with a multi-slice/multirowdetector scanner -provided helpful information for the non-invasive diagnosis of dural sinus thrombosis. Short measurement times were extremely worthful for the examination of uncooperative patients. In cooperative patients the improved resolution -provided by the new CT technique -was used to obtain high-resolution CT over a large region of interest. Furthermore, postprocessing modalities provided additional benefits when compared with DSA.Conclusion: The described new CT technique offers advantages in CTA of dural sinus over conventional scanner systems. 17:25 1417 Ultrafast electron beam tomography (EBT) angiography of internal carotid artery stenosis: comparison with digital subtraction angiography (D5A) K.W. Neff, K.-J. Lehmann, G. Weisser, S. Denk, I.K. Tesdal, A. Schwartz, M. Georgi; MannheimIDPurpose: To evaluate high resolution electron beam tomography angiography (E\u00dfT-CTA) in the investigation of internal carotid artery stenosis in comparison with DSA. Methods and Materials: 15 patients with 21 different grade internal carotid artery stenoses were investigated with E\u00dfT using an Evolution XP (Siemens, Germany) with continuous volume scanning of 140 images in 17 s (collimation 1.5 mm, table increment 1 mm, 50% overlapping image reconstruction every 1 mm, expose time 200 ms (124 mAs), scan-range 14 cm). 80 ml contrast material were administered (f1ow 4 mlls). Visualisation of the carotid artery circulation was performed with MIPs, 'shaded surface display' (SSD) and original axial slices. ICAstenoses were graded using NASCET criteria: mild (0-29%), moderate (30-69%), severe (70-99%) and occluded (100%). E\u00dfT-CTA results were compared to DSA. Results: All E\u00dfT examinations demonstrated high and homogenous density values along the imaged vessels. The used protocol allowed a scan range of 14 cm visualising the distal common carotid artery and the whole ICA. In 20/21 cases EBT-CTA and selective DSA demonstrated the same degree of stenosis. Calcifications were readily diagnosed with EBT-CTA. Conclusion: Ultrafast E\u00dfT-CTA provides a reliable evaluation of ICA stenosis. E\u00dfT with 140 slices and slice reconstruction every 1 mm offers a high resolution in the z-axis with demonstration of 14 cm of the carotid artery circulation.RADIOLOGIC-PATHOLOGIC CORRELATIONSBI 2016 Abdomen(3): esophagus/colon of the patho-anatomic changes is the primary goal of the radiographic examination. Now, that inflammatory bowel diseases increasingly is being investigated by endoscopy, many radiology trainees will have difficulty obtaining familiarity with barium enema appearances. This course offers an unique spectrum of experience in correlative imaging of colon disease, concentrating on the mucosal aspects.1418 A. Neoplastic and non-neoplastic tumors of the esophagus J.L. Buck; Lexington, KYIUSA Non-neoplastic tumors: A confident diagnosis of duplication cysts can be made if the contents of the intramural mass appear like water, but beware that soft tissue density or bright signal on T1 weighted images may be seen. The fibrovascular polyp originates in the submucosal space of the proximal cervical esophagus. However, it usually presents as an intraluminal mass, often lobulated, extending as far as the GE junction. The presence of fat confirms the diagnosis. Benign Neoplasms: Leiomyoma typically presents as a mural mass which is Ionger along the vertical axis of the esophagus. Lobulation is common. The lesions may present as polypoid intraluminal masses or may extend into the lung/mediastinum with relatively little mass affect on the lumen. Differentiation from leiomyosarcoma is not always possible. Occasionally. a segmental or diffuse form of involvement, termed leiomyomatosis , occurs. Malignant Neoplasms: Hematogenous metastases are rare, but secondary involvement of the esophagus from mediastinal spread of bronchogenic carcinoma is quite common. The esophagus is the least likely site for the presence of both secondary and primary lymphomas of the GI tract, but this diagnosis should be considered a immunocompromised patient. The most common primary malignancy remains squamous cell carcinoma . SCC appear as fungating polypoid masses, ulcerating masses, areas of stricture , varicoid tumors or, rarely, as superficial spreading careinoma. SpindIe cell carcinoma , in most cases a variant of SCC, usually presents as a large polypoid sessile mass, especially in the mid-esophagus. Adenocarcinoma now represents at least 30% of primary esophageal cancers in the white population. It is almost always secondary to Barrett esophagus and, therefore, its most eommon location is the distal esophagus. Its appearances may otherwise be identical to that of SCC, although other signs or symptoms of Barrett esophagus can suggest the diagnosis.1419 B.

DONDELINGER (Lil3ge/B)Proper management of trauma patients who have reached the hospital relies on complete, correct and expeditive diagnosis. To achieve this goal, problems related to structure, organization and availability of expertise in Medical Imaging in the emergency environment, are to be addressed. Diagnostic and Interventional imaging will be discussed in this respect, focused on visceraI injuries.Blunt trauma are mostly related to motor-vehiele accidents. They represent the third leading cause of death after coronary disease and cancer and the first cause of mortality in children and young adults. It is estimated that 25 or 30% of deaths related to motor vehicle accidents are solely due to thoracic injuries. In about 60% of cases, ehest injuries contribute to patients mortality. The magnitude of blunt trauma is evidenced by the frequent association of other serious injuries, particularly head and abdominaliesions and only 24% of patients have isolated ehest trauma. Blunt trauma represent a major socio-economic problem. Indeed, they are related in 1/3 of cases with alcohol consumption. Data published in the early 90's indicate that costs related to blunt trauma are as high as 6.7 billion Swiss francs per year in Switzerland (7 million inhabitants). Similar data are found in the United States where over 230 billion dollars are spent per year (250 million inhabitants).",

            "text": "1426 Radiological damage control: what to da and what should not be done R.F. Dondelinger; Liege/SManagement of the trauma victim requires urgent and efficient diagnosis and therapy. Diagnostic facilities should be either an integrated part of the Emergency Department, or located elose to it. CT and the angio room should be placed next to each other, or installed in the same suite and operate in an interactive way, avoiding time loss and mobilization of the patient. Senior staff radiologists with a particular interest in trauma and a consistent experience in CT and in interventional angiography should be available around the elock. CT with spiral acquisition and state of the art DSA are mandatory for radiological damage control. The severely injured polytrauma patient, in whom the haemodynamic status still allows exploration with imaging techniques, should undergo spiral CT and subsequent angiographic embolization, when hemorrhage is evidenced on CT and/or angiography. In our experience, cervical, parietal, hepatic, splenic, phrenic, retroperitoneal and pelvic bleeding sites were treated in such a way in selected victims. Unstable patients with retroperitoneal and pelvic hemorrhage primarily undergo angiography and embolization either without or after C'I, Pelvic bone dislocations may be stabilized by orthopedic fixation either prior or after the embolization procedure. All other hemodynamically unstable patients undergo urgent surgery. A majority of patients with hepatic, splenic and renal contusions can be treated conservatively, without any type of intervention. Others may undergo secondary surgical debridement or delayed coelioscopic evacuation of massive hemoperitoneum, or repair of any other surgical lesions. Delayed damage control caused by incomplete US or CT examinations, or unreliable film reading, should be avoided. Peripheral bone fractures and other obvious lesions should not mask an unrecognized thoracic or abdominal bleeding source. Time devoted to diagnostic work up in the emergency room should be inversionally proportional to the severity of the lesions (Ben Menachem's law). Bleeding in the neck region, retroperitoneal and pelvic bleeding is best documented by angiography and treated by selective embolization techniques. US is used to document minor trauma to a single parenchyma or to rule out visceral injury. What should be done 1. Place CT and angiography inside or elose to emergency room; 2. Maintain diagnostic and angiographic interventional expertise around the elock; 3. Integrate diagnostic and interventional imaging into the trauma team; 4. Inelude thoracic CT in abdominal or pelvic trauma; 5. Obtain systematically thoraeie and abdominal CT in a patient with severe head or spinal injury. What should not be done 1. Diagnose a patient to death (Ben Menachem's Law); 2. Let a first-year resident deal with a polytrauma patient without supervision.for preoperative planning and assessing the efficacy of therapy in osteoarthrosis.1427 Pressure distribution within joint cartilage visualized by dynamical high resolution MRI (NMR microscopy) W. Gr\u00fcnder, M. Wagner, A. Werner; LeipziglD Purpose: Depending on the orientation concerning the static magnetic field T2-weighted MR microimages of joint cartilage show multilaminar matrix struduring (\"magie angle effect\"). These internal structures can be visualized as zones of different signal intensies. The existence, extension and the appearance of these zones of anisotropie cartilage matrix structures are stronly influenced by mechanical stress. Based on this we show that high resolution MRI yields informations about biomechanical properties and can give new insights into the pressure distribution within loaded joint cartilage-in some equivalence to photoelastic measurements. Methods and Materials: Cartilage-bone plugs (paired specimens femur/tibia and femur/patella) of pig knee joint were imaged under varying pressure at 7 T using SE (TE = 20 ms; TR = 500 ms) with 80 11m in-plane resolution. Compression and decrompression behaviour were observed using a home-built probehead. Results: Obviously based on the different biomechanical function the multilaminar appearance of the joint cartilage vary between different types and regions. Under varying mechanical loading the T2-weighted images show drastic changes of the visualized multilaminar structure, depending on the orientation of anisotropie collagen meshwork within the different cartilage zones. Conclusion: Changes of mechanical loading very sensitive influence the MR presentation of the articular cartilage. Based on this fact from dynamical high resolution MRI measurements information about elastic properties and stress distribution within joint cartilage can be obtained. 1428 Quantification of articular cartilage volume and thickness: optimization and validation of a rapid 3D water excitation MR-sequence and experiences with joint effusion C. Glaser, F. Eckstein, S. Faber, K.-H. Englmeier, M.F. Reiser; MunichlD Purpose: Optimization and validation of a 3D Flash Water Excitation (WE) short imaging time sequence for cartilage thickness and volume measurements. Methods and Materials: 15 patellae (9 healthy volunteers, 6 patients with effusion) were imaged at 1.5 T (30 transverse sections a 2 mm, in-plane-res. 0.31 mm). We compared a 3D Flash WE sequence (17.2/6.6/15-40 0 /t(aq) 3'07\") with a validated 3D Flash sequence (conventional fat suppression) (FS) (45/11/30 0 /t(aq) 9'15\"). S/N and the flip angle (FA) providing the best C/N for cartilage (6 volunteers) and C/N for cartilage vs effusion (patients) were determined. After semiautomatic segmentation and 3D reconstruction, volume (voxel count) and mean and max. thickness (3D) were calculated. Results: A FA of 20\u00b0showed the best C/N with good discrimination of cartilage from effusion. The quantitative values for thickness and volume between FS and WE differed within 1% from mean values (not significant in Wilcoxon test). Conclusion: The 30 Flash WE sequence is a valid sequence for quantitative cartilage volume and thickness measurements with good differentiation between cartilage and effusion. This and the reduction of imaging time of 65% allows for routine clinical use and is promising 8:50 1429 Cartilage imaging: comparison of driven equilibrium Fourier transform (DEFT) imaging with SPGR and FSE sequences P. Lang, B. Hargreaves, S. Conolly, J.M. Pauly, J.E. Vandevenne, S.-U. Lee, G. Gold, D. Nishimura; Stanford, CAIUSA Introduction: To compare Driven Equilibrium Fourier Transform (DEFT) with SPGR and FSE sequences for cartilage imaging. Methods: 15 patients with symptomatic patellofemoral joints and suspected cartilage defects were scanned (1.5T GE Signa, 3 in surface coil, FOV 10 x 10 cm, matrix 256 x 256, slice thickness 4 mm, 2 NEX, fat-sat, DEFT 400/15 [TRITE in msec]; SPGR 50/15,30 degrees [flip angle]; FSE 3500/15, ETL [echo train length] 4 and 8. Centrastto-noise ratios (CNR) between cartilage and joint fluid were calculated and images were read by two trained skeletal radiologists. Results: In the 15 patients, DEFT demonstrated 8 cartilage defects (2 cartilage flaps, 6 fissures) not visualized on the other sequences. DEFT morphology was consistently best delineated with DEFT. Conclusion: DEFT is a new pulse sequence for cartilage imaging with higher CNR between cartilage and joint fluid than SPGR, GRE, and FSE sequences. DEFT appears to be ideally suited for detecting subtle cartilage defects. 1430 The role of T2 and Gd-DTPA-enhanced T1 relaxation in mapping degraded articular cartilage S. Trattnig, V. Mlynarik, M. Huber, A Ba-Ssalamah, A Zembsch, H. Imhof; ViennalA Purpose: To correlate variations of T 2 and Gd-DTPA-enhanced T 1 in pathological cartilage specimens with histological findings. Methods and Materials: Osteochondral specimens from the femoral condyle and the femoral head were removed during surgery for total endoprosthesis from patients who received intravenously a double dose of Gd-DTPA two hours prior surgery. Inversion recovery spin echo images and multiple spin echo images were measured on a 3T Bruker Medspec system equipped with a microimaging accessory. The relaxation times were calculated as mean values for six (0.23 mm) x (1.0 mm) voxels parallel to the cartilage surface. Histological sections were stained first with hematoxylin-eosin. Then the loss of proteoglycans was visualized by azan, alcian, and toluidine blue staining. Results: Relaxation time profiles across the cartilage layer show that Gd-DTPA-enhanced lesions with shorter T1 values do not coincide with those having longer T2 relaxation times. On the contrary, slightly higher T 1 values were found for a region with the elevated T2. Histological examinations indicate that the Gd-DTPA-enhanced decrease of T 1 corresponds to regions with depleted proteoglycans. On the other hand, higher T 2 values indicate mechanical damage (fibrillation and/or clefts) of the articular cartilage surface. Conclusion: Both T1 and T2 relaxation times could be useful in characteristing the state of articular feature of the cartilage tissue. 1431 Imaging articular cartilage defects in the ankle joint using 3D fat-suppressed echo planar imaging in comparison with conventional 3D fat-suppressed gradient echo sequence A Ba-Ssalamah, F. Vorbeck, S. Puig, R. Prokesch, AM. Hermeth, Th. Rand, H. Imhof, S. Trattnig; ViennalA Purpose: Our goal was to shorten examination time in articular cartilage imaging by use of recently developed 3D multishot echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with fat suppression (FS), in comparison with conventional 3D FS GE sequence Methods and Materials: Twenty five patients with ankle joint disorders underwent MRI in 1.0 T uni!. Hyaline cartilage was imaged with a 3D FS EPI and 3D FS GE sequence. Image assessment criter ia included lesion consp icuity, contrast between different types of normal tissue , and image artefacts. In addition contrast-to-noise (C/N) ratios of cartilage versus joint fluid and morrow were compared for each of the imaging sequences.Results: The 3D FS EPI sequence provided high C/N ratio between cartilage and subchondral bone similar to that of 3D FS GE sequence.The C/N ratlo between car tilage and effusion was significantly lower on the 3D EPI sequence due to higher signal intensity of fluid. 3D FS EPI sequence detected more lesions than 3D FS GE sequence, but the difference between the sensit ivities was statistically not significant Conclusion: The 3D FS EPI sequence is comparable with the 3D FS GE sequence in the diagnostic utility of cartilage lesion with the advantage of reduct ion of the scan time by a factor of four.1432MR imaglng of articular cartllage lesions using fat-saturated 3D\u00b7FLASH and water-excitated 3D-DESS sequences: experimental study K. W\u00f6rtler, M. Strothmann, B. Tombach , P. Reimer; M\u00fcnsteriD Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy offat-saturated (FS)-3D-FLASH and water-excitated (WE)-3D-DESS sequences in the detection and grad ing of articular cartilage lesions. Methods and Materials: 100 fresh knee joint specimens of pigs were examined by means of MR imaging. In 50 joints artificial cartilage lesions of different localizations, diameters (4-13 mm) and grades (grade 2: 25, grade 3: 25) were created. MR imaging was performed at 1.0 Tesla using FS-3D-FLASH (47 ms/10 ms150011.5 mm) and WE-3D-DESS (25.7 ms/9 ms140011.7 mm) sequences. Images of both pulse sequences were evaluated seperately by 3 independent observers. Results: In the detection of cartilage lesions accuracies were 93/92/95% for 3D-FLASH and 96/95/93% for 3D-DESS, respectively. The size of the lesions was correctly assesed in 84/76/87% (3D-FLASH) and 77/78/89% (3D-DESS), the grade in 84/83/85% (3D-FLASH) and 74.5/73/79.5% (3D-DESS), respectively. In all obeservers incorrect grading was mainly caused by unde restimation of grade-3-lesions. Conclusion: In this experimental setting both , FS-3D-FLASH and WE-3D-DESS sequences, were highly accurate in detection of grade 2 and 3 articular cartilage lesions. While both sequences showed equivalent diagnostic performance in determination of lesion size, grading appeared to be more reliable using the 3D-FLASH sequence. 1433 MRI in the follow-up of osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) G. Bachmann, I. J\u00fcrgensen, R-H. B\u00f6deker, W.S. Rau; Gie\u00dfenlD Purpose: Are there morphological findings in MRI that determine prognosis in the mid-term follow-up of osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the talus and condyle? Methods and Materials: 76 patients with OCD were examined before therapy and 24-36 months later using T1 and T2 weighted sequences and contrast studies. Five clinical and six morphological data were registered . At control exam ination , the same criteria were used to classify a part ial or complete remission , constant finding or progression.Results: We found a sign ificant correlation between age and con-sol idation, whereas gender, age and duration of symptoms had no influence on clinical outcome. Patients treated conservatively had same remission rate (62%) as those treated with several surgical techniques (44-63%) . Small OCD had a higher remission rate than large lesions (60%/26%). OCD with intact cartilage had a higher remission rate than those with defects (69%/40%). Contrast enhancing fragments were better than non-enhancing lesions (90%/47%). Stage, signal intensity and fragmentation had no statistical influence on the healing rate. Conclusion: MRI enables the assessment and graduation of prognostic factors which may support therapy plann ing. 1434 Magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM) of articular cartilage using the projection-reconstruction method M. Cova , R. Toffanin, P. Szomolanyi, F. Vittur, R.S. Pozzi-Mucelli, V. Jellus , L. Dalla Palma ; Triestel/ Purpose: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the most accurate non-invasive method to evaluate articular cartilage. Convent ional MR imaging sequences, however, offer only Iimited image contrast betwee n cartilage and the surrounding structures and, consequently, on MR images cartilage thickness is underestimated. The aim of this MRM study was to assess the potential of the projection-reconstruction (PR) method in the aceurate measurement of cartilage thickness.Methods and Materials: PR microimages were acquired on bonecartilage cylindrical plugs excised from four regions of 6 disarticulated femoral heads (l.e, super ior, inferior, posterior and anter ior), using a Bruker AM 300 WB instrument equipped with a microimaging accessory. PR microimages were then correlated with conventional Spin-Echo (SE) microimages and with histology. Results: On PR microimages, acquired with an echo time (TE) of 3.2 ms, the cartilage signal was increased, thereby accurately delineateing cartilage from the region of tide-marklcortical bone. As a consequence, a more accurate measurement of cartilage thickness compared to conventional SE sequence was feasibile. An excellent correlat ion between PR microimages and histology was also obtained. Conciusion: By the proposed method it is possible to accurately determine the cartilage thickness , better than with the conventional sequences.1435 Evaluation of articular cartilage of the knee using a dedicated low flald MRI S.

MRI parameters for RA-pathology were synovial extension and activity, bony alterations, bone marrow edema, joint width and effusion and tendovaginitis. These parameters were graded 0-111: none, mild, moderate, severe. Macroscopic items for arthritis assessed by McA were chondromalacia, bony alterations and for synovitis: proliferation, thickness, extension, hyperemia, vascularity and fibrosis. We seperately evaluated MRI and McA findings in the group of patients (n =9) with early rheumatoid arthritis (00 < 2 ys.). Statistical significance was defined as highly significant for p < 0.025, as significant for p < 0.05 and as low significant for p < 0.75 (Pearson's Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test). Results: MRI findings of synovial extension were significantly correlated with macroscopical findings of synovial extension (p < 0.001) and thickness (p =0.017) as weil as with chondromalacia (p =0.065) and bony alterations (p = 0.078).

Methods and Materials: fourty RA patients aged from 28 to 84 years (average age 58.5) with mean disease duration of 82 months (range 1-312 months) were studied. MRI was performed using a dedicated 0.2 T system (Artoscan, ESAOTE, Genoa, Italy). Sequences included T1 GE and STIR. Erosions were counted. Lesions larger than 5 mm were counted twice. Statistical analysis comprised Student t test and Pearson correlation coefficient. Results: 540 erosions were counted in 72 wrists. The mean number of erosions was 11.5 in the left and 10.1 in the right wrists. The most frequently affected bones were the capitate, the distal part of the radium and the triquetrum. Erosions were correlated with age (p = 0.027) and disease duration (p = 0.009). A correlation between lesions and disease duration was found only for the left wrists. No correlation was found between number of erosions and laboratory data. Conclusion: E-MRI is a simple and effective technique to evaluate bone erosions in Rheumatoid wrist. Follow-up studies should be focused on the left wrist because it develops more erosions that are better associated with duration of RA.1439 MR imaging of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis using 3D 5PGR fat suppressed acquisition before and after administration of gadolinium e.v. F. Ginolfi, MA Bali', G. Tortora, A. Salzano; Naples/l Purpose: To evalute diagnostic efficacy of 3D SPGR fat suppressed tecnique before and after administration of gadolinium in Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis of the knee. Methods and Materials: 16 pts affected with JRA of the knee underwent MR examination performing Fast Spin Echo acquisition in sagittal and coronal planes, and 3D SPGR fat suppressed acquisitions before and after administration of mdc ev in sagittal planes. Results: 3D SPGR acquisitions before gadolinium provided a good discrimination between synovia I fluid, hypointense, and synovial hypertrophy, that displayed from intermediate to high signal. A good contrast was realized, between cartilage, hyperintense, and synovial fluid, but in some instances synovia I hypertrophy was poorly discernible from chondral layer. In 3D SPGR acquisitions after gadolinium vascularized synovia enhanced, while hyaline cartilage descreased from high to intermediate signal.",

Methods and Materials: MRI was performed in 8 patients (mean age 41 \u00b1 7 years) with clinical suspicion of rheumatoid arthritis, by using T1 SE, STIR images and contrast enhanced images with fat suppression (SPIR). In these patients plain film radiographs were negative, or revealed equivocal signs of soft tissue swelling. Power Doppler imaging as a potential way to demonstrate vascular flow was performed in all patients. Results: MRI evidence of synovitis was regarded as extensive in 2 patients, moderate in 4 patients, and mild in 2 patients. Mild bone marrow alteration was observed in 5 patients. Mild fluid collections were found in 7 patients. Based on findings from anormal control group, Power Doppler Sonography revealed a mildly increased vascularization in 7 patients.Conclusion: MR imaging with contrast enhanced sequences and fat suppression techniques can potentially demonstrate early stages of rheumatoid arthritis by the evaluation of synovial alterations. Signs of hypervascularization can be demonstrated by Power Doppler Imaging. 1441 E-MRI and power-Doppler sonography in the study of early rheumatoid arthritis of the hand M. Falchi, E. Silvestri, G. Garlaschi, M. Cimmino, L. Satragno, C.E. Neumaier; GenoallPurpose: the purpose of this study is to investigate tha value of E-MRI and PD-sonography in the diagnosis of early RA of the hand. Methods and Materials: 35 patients suspected of having RA, with Larsen score 0-3, were examined using a 0.2T dedicated MRI system (Artoscan, Esaote, Genova-Italy) with and without Gd-DTPA. We used SET1, GET1, 3D-T1-weighted GE sequences and STIR. Ultrasonography was performed with high-frequency transducers (10-13 MHz). 8/35 patients were evaluated with PD after therapy. 2/8 were followed with MRI. Results: in grade 0-1 E-MRI showed periarticular enhancement in all the wrists and in majority of MCP and PIP joints. In grade 2-3 E-MRI demonstrated isolated subcortical marrow edema like a \"pre-erosion\" state. In all patients PD confirmed hypermic changes of the synovia, especially at the level of the radiocarpal and inferior ulnocarpal joints, with low resistence index (RI) at spectral analysis. In 8/35 patients followed after therapy PD depicted significant reduced vascularity. In 2/8 patients E-MRI weil correlated with PD findings after therapy.Conclusion: E-MRI is a low-cost alternative, very effective for a early diagnose of RA but not for a follow-up. PD is able to detect hyperemic changes of synovial pannus and is suggested for a follow-up after E-MRI assesment.1442 Dynamic MR imaging in the diagnosis of chronic synovitis before and after synovectomy of the knee K.

Methods and Materials: We present clinical history, plain film and MR imaging findings of two patients with symptomatic fibrous lunatotriquetral coalition. Results: Conventional films disclosed a narrowed space between the lunate and triquetral bone with cysts and sclerosis similar to pseudoarthrosis. MR imaging showed bone marrow edema adjacent to the incomplete separated lunato-triquetral joint and Gd-DTPA enhancing fibrovascular tissue in the synovium and subarticular cysts, explaining for the pain over the ulnar sided wrist.

Lueie; Sremska Kamenica, Novi Purpose: To determine possibilities of two differently acquired CINE MR studies, one developed by MR unit manufacturer and the other one developed by our team, in estimation of the intensity of pulsatile CSF flow through the normal cerebral aqueduc!. Methods and Materials: Twenty healthy volunteers underwent routine brain MR examination on 1.5T MR imager, with additionally performed ECG retra gated FISP 2D sequences (first one developed by MR unit manufacturer: TR 40, TE 12, FA 17,192 x 256, Acq 1, and the second one, experimentally developed by our team: TR 30, TE 12, FA 70, 192 x 256, Acq 1) at one fixed slice position positioned perpendicularly on cerebral aqueduct and displayed by multiplegated images in a closedloop CINE format. Results: In all of 20 volunteers MR examination showed normal brain morphology with patent cerebral aqueduct. CINE study acquired with RETRO FISP 2D sequence (TR 40, FA 17) did not allowed us to obtain adequate signal of CSF pulsation which can be sufficiently valid to be interpreted. Consequently to the changes of TR and FA, we achieved increased T2 effect resulting in higher flow sensitivity, hence RETRO FISP 2D sequence (TR 30, FA 70) showed more detailed pattern, especially of descendent CSF pulsation, which was sufficient enough for diagnostic evaluation. Conelusion: CINE study acquired with RETRO FISP 20 (TR 30, FA 70) demonstrated higher sensitivity for detection of the intensity of CSF pulsation within the cerebral aqueduct than the one acquired with RETRO FISP 2D (TR 40, FA 17), revealing better possibility of the cerebral aqueduct patency estimation in the absence of Phase Contrast sequences. 1478 Quantifieation of intracranial liquor volumes with MR imaging Th.

Bonomo; Chieti/l Purpose: To compare CE MRA and CTA in the study of patients with c1inical signs of cerebro-vascular insufficiency (CV!). Methods and Materials: 25 patients, with clinical signs of CVI, underwent MRA and CTA examinations. MRA was performed using a 1.5 T super-conductive magnet and these parameters: SPGR 3D sequence, TRITE/FA: <8 ms/2.5 ms/60o; matrix 256 x 128; Nex 1; FOV 24 x 16 cm; ST: 1 mm; AT: 32 s. Contrast medium was administered i.v, using injector (0.2 mmol/Kg and flow rate 1.5 ml/s). CTA was performed using these parameters: ST 3 mm; Pitch 1. Non-ionic contrast medium (80 c, 350 mgl/ml, flow rate 3 ml/s) was administered i.v, The circulation time was calculated with a bolus test. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was the gold standard. Three independent radiologists graded the stenosis, according to NASCET c1assification. Me Nemar test (p < 0.05) was used. Results: CTA expressed 3 false positive judgements, one overestimation and one underestimation. CE MRA did not expressed over-or under-estimations. MRA showed a sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of 100% and CTA of 88%, 100% and 96% (not statistically significant differences). Conclusion: CE MRA and CTA are techniques with a high diagnostic accuracy, although CE MRA could be promising in the evaluation of epiaortic vessels.

Passariello; Rome// Purpose: To determine the feasibility and accuracy of contrast enhanced Turbo-MRA (CE-MRA) in the evaluation of patients with carotid artery stenosis. Methods and Materials: 23 patients with suspected carotid artery stenosis were examined with a 1.5 T magnet (Siemens Vision Plus) using a 3D T1 weighted FISP (TRITE/NEX: 3.8/1.4/1; TA = 10 seconds; Matrix =110 x 160) acquired 4 times after i.v. bolus injection with a power injector of 20 ml of Gd-DTPA. Scan delay was determined after a 3 ml test bolus. In all patients also a 3D TOF MOTSA TONE sequence was also acquired. In all patients DSA and Color-Doppler US were also performed. Results: CE-MRA was considered diagnostic and superior to the 3D MOTSA sequence in all cases. CE-MRA was correct regarding the degree of stenosis in 6/7 mild stenoses, 7/7 discrete stenoses, 11/12 severe stenoses and 3/3 occlusions and correctly negative in 17 normal carotid arteries.

Conventional and MR-V were prospectively analysed by separate, blinded observers. Results: MR-V iimage quality was comparable to conventional venography. Overcoming vessel superimposition, rotated and targeted MIPs surpassed conventional venography in defining the morphology of perforating veins. Varicose changes of the greater and lesser saphenous veins were assessed as reliably as their pre-bypass status. Two patients referred to exclude deep venous thrombosis showed normal venograms, while the other two patients displayed postthrombotic changes. Conclusion: Contrast-enhanced 3D MR-V provides a conmprehensive display of the venous system in the lower extremities. It represents an attractive alternative to conventional venography in patients with complex venous anatomy or allergies to iodinated contrast.1520 In vivo 1H MR spectroscopy of benign and malignant breast tumors KA Kvistad, I.J. Bakken, T.E. Singstad, A.J. Svarliaunet, S. Lundgren, O. Haraldseth, I.S. Gribbestad; TrondheimlNPurpose: The most common benign breast tumor, fibroadenomas, can be difficult to differentiate from carcinomas on all imaging modalities including MR mammography. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether in vivo 1 H MRS can be used to differentiate normal breast tissue, fibroadenomas and carcinomas, based on detection of cholinecontaining compounds (Cho) and lipid composition. Methods and Materials: 10 patients with invasive breast carcinomas, 10 patients with fibroadenomas and 10 healthy volunteers were examined. For each patient, three spectra with increasing echo times (TE 135 ms, 350 ms and 450 ms). were acquired. Results: Cho was detected in 9 of 10 carcinomas, in 2 of 10 fibroadenomas, and in none of the volunteers. The ratios between the allylic, methylene and methyl resonances in lipids were not significantly different in the three groups. Conclusion: Cho can be detected in most carcinomas, but it is not a specific finding of malignancy. With a small increase in examination time in vivo 1 H MRS can be performed as part of an MR mammography. A larger study population is necessary to evaluate if MR spectroscopy can add to the specificity of MR imaging in the diagnosis of breast lesions.1521 Contrast-enhanced MRI of the breast after silicone implant P. Viehweg, A. Heinig, R. Beck, D. Lampe, J. Buchmann,S.H. Heywang-K\u00f6brunner; HaI/eIDPurpose: Reliable exclusion and early detection of recurrence may be impaired after reconstruction mastectomy using silicone implants. Therefore we have investigated the use of c.e. MRI in this difficult field. Methods and Materials: C.e. MRI with FLASH-3D and 0.2 mmol Gd-DTPAlkg b.w., 2-3 view mammography, 7.5 MHz ultrasound. Results: 195 patients with silicone implants after mastectomy have been examined. Later than 6 mos. postoperatively enhancement within the scar tissue was usually insignificant. Problems occurred in less than 10% of the patients because of focally enhancing granulomas or diffusely enhancing reactive-inflammatory changes, but could in 50% of these cases be solved by follow-up. 16/17 recurrences were visible by MR, 9/17 recurrences were palpable or visible by the other methods. 1/17 recurrences was visible only in retrospect on MRI as 2 mm enhancing focus. Conclusion: C.e. MRI proves a very valuable tool for patients with silicone implants after mastectomy.1522 00 follow-up examinations increase the diagnostic confidence of MR mammography? M.

Conventional and digital radiographs were obtained first with identical exposure parameters. Images were independentely scored by 6 radiologists using a five point rating scale with respect to five criteria of image quality (Iatitude, visibility of trabecular bone, of enosteal and periosteal cortical borders and visibility of soft tissues). Results: All observers showed a significant preference (p < 0.05) for the digital images for all quality criteria. Differences of rating scores were largest for the assessment of soft tissues and image latitude. In selected cases visualisation of increased bone density due to sclerotic lesions was inferior in the digital images. Conclusion: The new digital flat panel detector is superior to conventional radiography for delineation of anatomie structures in a variety of skeletal regions. Performance for detection of pathology remains to be evaluated.",

Langer; Freiburg/D Purpose: To study the image quality of a new digital f1at-panel detector system (DFPDS) in comparison with a conventional 400 speed screenfilm system (SFS). Methods and Materials: Paired radiographs of the pelvis were acquired from 30 volunteers with both a 400 speed SFS (Cronex Rapid UV/UVG, Sterling Diagnostic Imaging, Greenville, SC) and a DFPDS (DirectRay, Sterling). All images were acquired at 1.15 m focus-detector distance, 73 kV with automatie exposure control and a moving 12/40 lines/cm grid. The quality of the images was evaluated independently by 3 senior radiologists. The visibility of the following anatomie details was evaluated: crista iliaca, spongiosa ala ossis ilii, soft tissues surrounding the crista iliaca; sacroliliac joint, massa lateralis; acetabulum and surrounding spongiosa; ramus superior ossis pubis; caput femoris and hip joint; trochanter major and fat layer of the hip joint; 5th lumbar vertebra, delineation of the psoas museIe. The visibility of all structure was ranked on a four point scale. Data were analyzed using a paired t-test. Results: The evaluation show superior results of the DFPDS in delineation anatomical structures of the lower lumbal spine and the sacral bone. The other analysed could be visualised as weil as with the SFS. Conclusion: DFPDS image quality is superior for regions corresponding to the extremities of the graduation curve of the SFS. For the other critical structures the quality is at least comparable. Purpose: Teleradiology has been a useful system to perform remote diagnosis using CRT units. However, a conventional teleradiology system can not show the advantage of the \"real time\" nature of the system elearly, because most systems have been dedicated to CRT diagnosing of images obtained at and transmitted from a remote hospital. The study, therefore, is to introduce the new two concepts for teleradiology: \"real time radiology\" and \"seamless operation of a workstation to view images from both local and remote hospitals\" into a teleradiology and to establish such a system. \"Real time radiology\" is a system, which can cover 24-hour services of diagnostic praetices by radiological speeialists. Methods and Materials: We designed a real time radiology system with a multimedia diagnostic workstation, which was established under the new teleradiology concepts and could be used for cooperative diagnosis by interchanging radiologieal images bilaterally in real-time during an audio-visual discussion. An intersocket communication technology was used to establish such a new real time radiology system. Results and Conclusion: In this artiele, we show the system configuration and present the results of evaluation from technical and clinical points of view on real time radiology. 11:00 1492 Teaching computer system as a model of physician performance in radiology M. Kamenetsky, M. Pervak, A. Nor, N. Arkhangelskaya; DonetskJUKR Purpose: To assess the role of computer algorithm-based system for training would-be physicians in radiology. Methods and Materials: A teaching system as a model of radiologist performance was devised, taking as a base diagnostic syndrome principle and algorithm-oriented approach. The identified radiologie symptoms were highlighted in the image. Multimedia means for manipulating complex information, MS Windows'95 as an environment, MS Visual C++ as abasie programming language, Visual Basic for breadboading along with MS Access for data base management were used. Results: The computer algorithm-based system enabled both the sequence ef diagnosis establishment and conclusion to be obtained, diagnostic process control to be exercised, an error to be revealed by returning to one of the previous stages. Conclusion: Apart from its beneficial utility for trainees in radiology the system demonstrated the potential to stimulate physician logic and judgement.",

Dalla Palma; Os/o/N, Trieste/I A culture including conferences between radiologists and clinicians is customary in Scandinavia. This must necessarily be time eonsuming. Is it worth it? To assess the question, it is necessary to find the time used for conferences and try to assess how this time is used. This work has concentrated on this, Further on we will compare routines in Scandinavia and Italy to find possible differences due to the culture including conferences. Materials and Methods: Questionnaires were filled in at East University Hospital (EUH) in Gothenburg, Sweden and Ullevaal University Hospital (UUH), Oslo, Norway. Totally 34 conferences at EUH and 31 at UUH were registered. Total time, ineluding preparations, disturbances, conference and time for dictating examinations not previously dictated were registered. At EUH all daily conferences were registered. At UUH apart of the daily conferences were registered. UUH has a higher number of and shorter conferenees daily. Results: The time used at EUH was: average total time 136.1 minutes and median 140 minutes; average time for the conferences were 26.5 minutes, median 25 minutes. At UUH: average total time 78.2 minutes, median 72; average time for conferences were 24.3, median 22. The average number of examinations that had to be evaluated and described in connection with the conferences were at EUH 54.2 (median 57) and at UUH average 11.5 (median 12). The average time used for descriptions were at EUH 2.6 (median 2.5) and at UUH 8.2 (median 6.3). The shorter the conference the longer the time for either describing the examination or discussing it with the. The number of elinieians attending varied, 2-30. Discussion: Around 25 minutes are being used for each conference. It looks like most conferences are 20-25 minutes long independent of the number of examinations presented. The rest of the time registered would probably have been used for describing anyway, so those 20-25 minutes are the most interesting. An interesting observation is that the time available always seems to be used -the more time available, the more time used. If we assume 20 conferences a day (which is elose to UUH), it will constitute approximately 8 hours a day which is a standard workday; i.e. it costs one extra doctor. The time used by the clinicians will probably be worth a lot more, and the next question we will try to answer is: How much do the conferences cost the clinical department and do they find it worthwhile.",

Zolles; Vienna/A Purpose: Natural speech recognition was introduced following the rebuilding of the department so as to make it possible to handle a steadily increasing number of examinations without taking on additional staff. Methods and Materials: A speech recognition system with 22 workstations was integrated in the state-of-the-art radiological information system (RIS), and physicians were encouraged to dictate their reports using the new system. Results: Although the original timetable provided for the gradual introduction of speech recognition in three phases to ensure a smooth transition to the new technology, most of the physicians opting for the new technology immediately started using it for all their reports. With a minimum of training and customisation, they were quickly able to achieve recognition rates of over 90% without significant changes to their method of working. Conclusion: The introduction of natural speech recognition has significantly shortened the turnaround time of reports -partieularly at times during which no secretarial support is available. In many instances the Purpose: Ta find out why some women experience pain during mammography and to know whether any of the pain factors are controllable. Methods and Materials: A quantitative sociological study was performed to examine the pain experience during and after mammography. 247 women were interv iewed as weil in a screen ing unit, in university hospital as in a non-university hospital. All radiographers (N = 13, 5342 response =100%) perform ing the mammographies were intervi ewed as weil. A broad pain model is used and factars concerning the woman , the mammographie procedure and the radiographer were explored. The results of pain experience of women attending for a screening examination were compared with those undergoing a diagnostic or follow-up examination . Results: Analysis of the data were performed on different statistical levels. The results show that most of the women (3 out of 4) experience pain during mammography, and that pain experience is more frequent with a diagnostic mammography. The risk of pain experience can be explained by biological and psychoemotional aspects of the woman, the procedure of the mammog raphy and especially the attitude of the radiographer. Conclusion: 73% of women undergoing mammography experience pain. Faetors concerning the woman , the procedure and the radiographer can influence this pain experience. Resulls: 27 women with bilateral breast cancer were found. The incidenee of synchronous tumours was 22%. 78 percent were metachronous tumours with a median interval of 92 month . The recidivation rate was part icularly higher in synchronous tumours (33%) than in metachronous ones (19%). The second breast cancer was detected only by clinical examination or biopsy in two of the 27 patients . Only 67% of synchronous tumours seems to be similar in histology type and mammographie features. There was no eorrelation between mammography features of the first and second metachronous tumour (72%). Concluslon: More aggressive monitoring of the second breast by frequent clinical examination, mammography and selected biopsy is necessary.",

Methods and Materials: We report 2 Chinese women (42-46 y) who underwent mammo-and ultrasonog raphy. One had a FNAC and cytology of the nipple discharge. Results: The first woman came for a screening mammogram, no c1inical abnormality or previous disease was known. There was no nipple discharge , nor breastfeeding in history. The mammogram showed multiple slightiy dilatated radio-opaque ducts and cysts , the image one is used to see on a galactogram. The ultrasonography showed no suspicious lesions. The second woman breastfed her baby for 9 years. Because of a persistent nipple discharge a mammography was performed. Aga in multiple radio-opaque dilatated ducts were seen, but in this case, the cysts were larger. Cytology of the nipple discharge or a FNAC of one of the cysts showed no pathology. Discussion: With an identical mammographie image, the common finding between these two cases is the Chinese origin and the middle age of the women. Hormonal status was normal. There is a similarity with lipoid lactation , showing ducts which are filled with a fatty lucent material, but in the literature very few remarks and mammographie imaging was found. Conelusion: It seems that some Chinese women are affected by a very rare breast disease. Further investigation and more cases are needed to describe this abnormality.",

Vizcaino; Elda/E Objetives: Unlike ductal carcinoma in situ, wich is considered a preinvasive lesion, lobular carcinoma in situ is at present c1assified as a risk faetor for breast cancer. The objeetive of our study is to show the spectrum of mammographie alterations of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), thereby updating the concept of this histological category. Material and Methods: We review the surgical biopsies carried out during the Prevention of Breast Cancer Programm run by the Autonomous Region of Valencia between April 1992 and December 1996. During this program, 101.657 patients were studied in the first series and 73.218 in the second. LCIS was the anatomopathological diagnosis in 10 biopsies. LCIS was diagnosed in 5 of the 797 biopsies done in the first series and in 5 of the 362 biopsies done in the second. Results: In 8 of the 10 cases the mammographie presentation consisted of clusters of microcalcifications, in one case in association with architectural distorsion and in another with palpable asymmetry. The two remaining cases were a nodule and a stellate lesion, both of which were palpable. Conelusion: LCIS is an uncommon histological category whose mammographie findings are not especific and wich requires special follow-up. Paris/F Purpose: The incidence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has increased by the widespread use of screening mammography. DCIS is often detected by microcalcifications on mammography. Based on the extent of microcalcifications, mammography usually underestimates the size of DCIS. The aim of our study was to describe the radiological and pathological findings of small DCIS. Methods and Materials: From january 1992 to january 1998, breast surgery was performed in 13 patients with the pathological findings of DCIS smaller than 1 cm in diameter. Cases with associated carcinoma were excluded. Mammography and/or radiography of the surgical biopsy were analysed retrospectively in comparison with pathological findings. Results: The mammographie findings were microcalcifications in all cases. The mammographie size of the area of microcalcifications was 3 to 40 mm (mean =14 mm). The pathologie size was 2 to 6 mm (mean = 5 mm). The microcalcification signal was always associated with DCIS and with other pathological findings (fibrocystic disease n = 8, atypical ductal hyperplasia n =1).Conelusion: In this subgroup of DCIS the mammographie size overestimates the pathological size. Calcifications of associated benign pathologies help probably to detect them on mammography. The exploration of all clusters of microcalcifications is important to detect precociously DCIS.",

Rienm\u00fcller; Graz/A Purpose: To identify criteria of metastatic versus non-metastatic Iymphnodes in patients with known malignant lesions of the mama before surgery to reduce the number ofaxillary Iymphnode dissections. Patients and Methods: 85 patients who were admitted to mama surgery because of mamographically suspected tumorous lesions were studied by EBT preoperatively. The scans were performed in all patients as postbolus scan with 300 ms exposure time and 3 mm slice thickness starting at the level of the acromioclavicular joint and ending below the lower mammarian junction line. At surgery 68 (85) lesions revealed histologically to be malignant and 17 (85) benign. A careful evaluation of the regional Iymphnodes at the surgical level 1 (Iymphnodes axill.lat. and paramammarian), level 2 ((Iymphnodes axilLcent. and intrapectoral.), level 3 (Iymphnodes infra-and supraclavicuL) with respect to their number and their size was performed. Using the retrospective approach of step by step analysis it was found that the Iymphnodes 2':5 mm in diameters and above two by number per surgical level suggest their metastatic involvement. Results: In 27 of 68 patients with malignant breast lesions the regional Iymphnodes in all three surgical levels did not exceed the number one and a size of 5 mm. In 41 of 68 patients the number of Iymphnodes was equal or higher than two and at least one of them was greater than 5 mm in at least one of the three surgical levels. Using this approach in identifying metastatic involvement of the regional Iymphnodes the statistical analysis revealed for EBT a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 100%, 69% and 82% and a negative predicitive value of 100%. Conelusion: Our data suggest that the preoperative evaluation of patients with suspected mama lesions using the described EBT approach and analysis may exclude unnecessary surgical exploration of the regional Iymphnodes if their number is found below one and the size below 5 mm in all surgical levels.",

We must pay attention to this region because breast cancer can also occur in ectopic glandular tissue too. Methods and Materials: Mammografaphy is routinely accompanied with physical examination and ultrasonography. Standard mammogram contains craniocaudal view and oblique view. If only lesion is particulary seen on mammogram or is not present, special axillary view is performed. When pathologie lesion is present, FNAB is indicated immediately. Results: 300-350 women with breast abnormalities undergo the surgery treatment in our hospital a year. 20 of them with accesory breast tissue, of which 1-2 with breast cancer result. Conelusion: Breast cancer has become the most important cause of death in women. Breast cancer can occur in accesory breast tissue, predominant in axilla and this region should be always examined carefully. Setting radiological diagnosis by means of only mammography is insufficient without ultrasonography and c1inical examination. Oblique view is recommended by our experience. Mammography, ultrasonography and palpation together diminish a number of talse negative and talse positive findings. Only efficient team work of the radiologist, gynecologist, surgeon, pathologist, cytologist and oncologist can leads to correct and early diagnosis, which enables adequate therapy of breast cancer. Purpose: To create an animal model for the further technical development of combined mammography and automated sonography. Methods and Materials: Thirteen udders from freshly slaughtered milch sheep were prepared in such a way as to resemble human breasts in shape and size with preservation of the skin all around. These models were examined by combined mammography and automated sonography. Artificial lesions (beads) and cysts (water balloons) were sewn into six of the udders. The combined imaging system includes a mammographie unit with the upper compression plate modified to accomodate a motor-driven ultrasound probe (5 MHz). 3-D data sets are automatically acquired and condensed into aC-plane representation of reference echoes from the lower compression plate using a computer Iinked to the ultrasound system. Objectives: Ta correlate radiographic findings with radionuclide studies in the different focei of Paget's disease. Materials & Methods: The radiolog ie findings of Paget's disease were reviewed by two authors. Radionuelide studies were revised by an speeialist. Neither of them knew the results of previous leetures. Stalist ical analysis was made by means of the SPSS program V.5.0. Results: There were 61 women and 49 man. Their mean age was 75 years. 69 patients showed multiple sites of involvment and 41 a single foeeus. Agreement between radiolog ical observators raised a Kappa index of 0.43 . The authors eoincidence between radiologieal findings and radionuclide positivity in the different \\ Iocations was high (81-93%). Diserepancies were noted mainly in the scapula and the sternum. In 17 positive gammagraphie foeei the radiology diseovered degenerative ehanges. Discussion: Our results diselose a positive correlalion between radiology and radionuelide studies in Paget's disease. The diseordanee appreeiated from seapula and sternum may be due to the lack of speeifie views. Conclusion: Correlat ion between radiology and radionuelide in Paget's disease is high . Both of them are goOO teehniques to evaluate the disease. A highest eoincidence was noted in the pelvis and single foeeus. ",

A c1ass ie history of aeute pharyngitis was followed 3-10 days later by the development of fever, rigors , and features of septie pulmonary emboli were present in three patients. Pharyngitis was absenl in one case. In three patients severe neek pain enough preeeded pulmonary symptoms . Fusobacterium neerophorum was the eausitive organism in three cases.. IJV thrombus was demonstrated sonograph ieally in two patients and by CT in two others. . Chest radiographie findings were non-spee ifie in Ihree pateints but CT revealed charaeteristic features of septie infaretion in all patients . Conclusion: Radiological investigation may be instrumental in the diagnosis of Lemiere's syndrome , whether through demonstrat ion of interna l jugular vein thrombosis , or through CT findings suggestive of septic emboli. Purpose: To review the CT findings of nontubereulous mycobaeteria (NTM) lung infeelion in non-immunoeompromised patients, to highlight the importanee of serial CT examinations on the patient's elinical and therapeutie management , and to subdivide mycobacte rial infeetions aeeording 10 the infecting organism and to the elinieal-radiograph ie pieture. Methods and Materials: 16 patients with a total of 56 CT seans were reviewed. Diagnosis relied either on multiple positive eultures (n :: 16), or on open Jung biopsy specimen (n :: 6). CT findings were analysed using a specific set of diagnostie eriteria. Results: Common manifestations ineluded parenchymal eavities in 9 of the 16 subjeets (56%), bronchiectasis and parenehymal nodules in 13 of 16 subjeels (81%), and air spaee disease in 68% of cases. Less eommonly observed signs were adenopathy and pleural effusion. Two groups of patients were isolaled according to CT findings : one consisting of 11 patients with a radiographie pattern of eavitary upper lobe infiltrates indistinguishable from reaetivation tuberculosis; the other eonsisting of 5 patients with a radiographie pattern of multiple bilateral nodular opacities associated with bronchiectasis. The patient profiles and the infeeting organism varied from one group to the other. Purpose: To evaluate radiographie differenee of upper and lower easeous pseudomembranous endobroneh ial tubereulos is (CPET) and to correlate with bronehoseopie findings. Methods and Materials: Eighty-three patients (71 female, 12 male ; age 33.1 \u00b1 11.3 years) having CPET in bronehoseopie examinations were seleeted from May 1991 to Deeember 1997. Initial ehest radiographie findings of all patients were evaluated . Bronehoseopieally, traeheobronchial involvement of the tuberculosis were classified as localized (confined to the segmental or lobar bronchus) and extensive (over to the lobar bronchus) one.Results: The most commonly involved site was upper lobe (n = 48, 59%), followed by lower lobe (n = 23, 28%), middle lobe or lingular segment (n = 12, 14%) . CXR findings were confined in single lobe in 69 palients. 10 palients had multiple lobe involvement in ehest radiograph and 4 patients normal. Upper lobar CPET showed lobar or segmental collapse (n = 24), nodular or patchy infiltration (n = 20) and normal findings (n = 4). However, lower lobar CPET showed more commonly nodular or patchy infiltration (n =15) than collapse (n = 8). In bronehoscopie findings, upper lobar CPET demonstrated more extensive involvement (n =36) than localized (n = 9) but lower lobar CPET showed more localized involvement (n =19) than extensive (n = 14). Conelusion: There was difference in radiograph ie pattern and bronchoscop ic extension between upper lobar and lower lobar CPET. (44), open lung biopsy (6), autopsy (5). Results: In 11 patients with acute hematogenously disseminated tubereulosis including miliary disease random distribution of numerous uniform nodules and minimal thickness of interlobular septa was found. Typical pattern presented symmetrical alteration of both lungs with involvement of apical segments. In chron ic disease (21 patients) the predom inance of upper lobe abnormal ities was noted, with random distribution of nonuniform nodules , cavitation, air-space infiltrates and paraseptal emphysema in apical segments. In 14 patients with Iymphogenously disseminated tuberculosis HRCT demonstrated the presence the ground-glass opacities with numerous small interstitial and centrilobular nodules, thiekness of intralobular septa and bronchial walls. The pattern of bronchogenie spread of infection from large cavities or bronehonodular fistulas in 9 patients consisted of air-space centrilobular nodules in middle and lower lobes with typical \"tree-in-bud\" symptom.

Non-myelinated white malter (WM) and myelinated WM was segmented using histogrambased c1ustering. Myelinated WM regions were corrected manually. Results were confirmed by a senior-neuroradiologist. Results: We found progress of myelinisation in an occipitorostral direction and from caudal to cranial. The volume of myelinated WM increased faster than that of non-myelinated WM (2.1 % \u00b1 0.2% of the total white malter at gestational age of 33 weeks, 3.1% \u00b1 0.3% at 41 weeks). We found no significant difference between relative myelinisation of term infants (3.0% \u00b1 0.2%, week 40 \u00b1 0.5) and preterm infants at term ( Purposellntroduction: Radiat ion therapy is the most effective nonsurgical method for the treatment of cancer. However, the precise determination of the lesions that take place in the brain tissue during the irradiation is very difficult. Although MR imaging allows mon itoring of lesion volumes, but it cannot provide the information on the brain metabolism -the stud ies of the latter seem to be very useful for predicling and/or deteeting the response to therapy. Proton in vive spectroscopy, because of its sens itivity, is an ideal tool for this aim, however the literature data are sparse and concern mainly the post radiation effects 1,2. The aim of this study was to monitor the metabolite changes that occur during therapy. 5ubjects and Methods: 15 patients (aged 40-45) were exam ined in a whole -body MRI/MRS system (Elscint 2T Prestige) operating at the field strength of 2T and a proton resonance frequency of 85 .6 MHz applying the standard head coil. All patients had been operated before they underwent fractionated radiotherapy. The influence of radiotherapy was studied by means of a sequential recording of spectra before the radiation exposure, after 50% of the total dose, after the compl etion of the therapy and a month later. MRllocalized 1 H MR spectra we re acqu ired using a single voxel doublespin-echo .pRESS sequence with the following parameters: TR-1500 rns, TE-35 ms , 200 Acq and for the voxel volume of 8 cm 3 . Water suppression was achieved using CHESS technique. For each palient the spectra were obtained from two volumes of interest -the first localizalion was in the area of a high dose (total dose of 60 Gy) and the second one was situated in the region of a low does (total dose up to 50 Gy). The spectra were postprocessed with the automatie fitting in the frequency domain. The fitting procedure was supplied by the machine manufacturer. Relat ive intensities of the signals due to N-acetyl aspartate (NM), choline based compounds (Cho ), crealine based eompounds (Cr), mio-Inositol (mi ), lactate (Lac) and lipides (Lip) were obtained by numerical integration of the fitted signals.The results were compared with the literature speetroscopie data on the early and late post radiation spectral characteristicslP. Results: It was found that in the case of high dose area in the short TE spectra the ratio NAAlCr decreases vs. time of therapy suggesting the depletion of NM and/or increase in Cr concentration. Intereslingly, the changes in the ratio Cho/NM occurring on radiotherapy are not very pronounced, however the values are observed to increase slightly. It is also worth noting that the Lac/NM ratio increases markedly during the course of therapy. The changes in the metabolite ratios in the low dose area are found to be similar, however the rate of reduction of the ratio NAAlCr vs. radiation time is markedly slower. were regrouped aceording to: 1. Antiretroviral therapy; 2. neurologic symptoms and 3. viral load, respectively. Two spectroscopy sequences were applied with a TE of 5 and 135 ms, respectively. Peak integral values were calculated for N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), phosphocreatine/creatine (Cr) myo-inositol (mi) and glutamate/glutamine (Glx) and normalized to Cr. Results: All patients had reduced NAAlCr ratio. The Cho/Cr ratio was increased in patients without therapy (p =0.07), but was back to normal after therapy. The ml/Cr ratio was significantly increased in patients with neurologie symptoms. The Glx ratio did not show any significant changes between volunteers and patients. Conclusion: The NAA and Cho alterations in HIV+ patients reflect neuronal loss in combination with cell membrane modification, such as myelin alterations or gliotic changes. While the HIV infection progresses, the metabolic alterations become more prominent. There seem to be partial normalization after antiretroviral therapy.Purpose: To determine the early postoperative changes in respect to membrane enhancement, residual enhancing tumor, changes in peritumoral edema, and hematoma, fluid and air in the surgical site by using eomputed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonanee (MR) imaging. The other aim is to determine when a postoperative MRI most accurately shows residual enhancing tumor.Purpose: To determine the predictive value of single voxel MR speetroscopy (MRS) in the diagnosis of cerebral masses in patients with AIDS Methods and Materials: Patients with c1inical AIDS who had doeumented eerebral mass lesions were prospectively studied on a 1.5 T Signa Horizon MR (GE systems) using the single voxel technique (8 eubic cm voxel Probe/SV). Spectra were analyzed by a radiologist blinded to c1inical data into four eategories: inflammatory, neoplastic, isehaemic and demyelination. Patients underwent stereotaetic biopsy of the lesions after MRS as part of the clinical management. Results: 18 patients were studied. MRS was in agreement with histology in 13 patients (72% with 95% confidence level from 62 to 83%). Kappa was 0.6 indicating fair to good agreement. Of the 5 incorrect analyses, 3 patients were misdiagnosed as focal demyelination when histology demonstrated inflammatory lesions. On histology, 9 patients had inflammatory lesions, 4 tumours and 2 patients each infarets and demyelination. Conclusion: MRS can be used to diagnose cerebral masses in patients with AIDS as an alternative to biopsy and thus direct therapy. presumption that the 1H MRS is a valuable method of radiation therapy monitoring.",

            "text": "Purpose: 1 H magnetic resonanee spectroscopy was used to eompare brain metabolism in elderly women and men. Methods and Materials: Automated 1 H chemieal shift imaging (PRESS, TE = 135 ms) was used to examine an 8 x 8 x 2 cm 3 supraventricular brain volume, a transverse plane parallel to the eanthomeatal line, in 540 subjects of 60 to 90 years old, stratified by age and sex. Results: Regional choline (Cho), ereatine (Cr) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) peak areas in the 518 successful examinations (96%) were normalized by division through the total area of the corresponding metabolite in eaeh spectral map. This eliminated intersubject varianee, as expeeted, maximized intervoxel variance (26 < F < 149, P < 0.0001) and reduced the standard deviations in the voxel metabolite signals threefold. Normalized signals in women (n =257) and men (n =261) differed in 9 (Cho/SCho), 8 (Cr/SCr) and 10 (NAAlSNAA) out of 36 voxels (P < 0.001). The main finding was that Cho/SCho, Cr/SCr and NAAlSNAA are reduced in men compared with women in a block of 6 frontal voxels of the cingulate gyrus containing essentially white matter. Discussion: This phenomenon of reduced metabolite levels in men compared with women fits with a sex-related reduetion of glucose metabolism in the same brain lobe revealed by positron emission tomography (Gur et al., Science 1995; 267:528-531) . This is the first multivoxel MRS study demonstrating sex-related differences in human brain metabolites.Purpose Purpose: In a prospeetive MRI study using ehemieal shift speetroseopy imaging (CSI) we examined patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). We evaluated the predietive value of metabolie CSI ehanges in patients after epilepsy surgery. Methods and Materials: The MR-investigations were performed using a 1.5 T whole body MR-system. For CSI high resolution multi-voxel speetroseopy was performed. To evaluate the influenee of metabolie ehanges on the postoperative outcorne, we elassified the patients in three groups. Patients in group I had unilateral, in group 11 slight (Iess than 10% contralateral changes) and in group 111 severe (more than 30% contralateral changes) bilateral metabolie changes in CSI. 26 patients underwent epilepsy surgery. The results of preoperative CSI and EEGregistration were compared and evaluated by the postoperative results.Results: Statistical analysis demonstrates a better correlation (r = 0.8744, p < 0.005) of preoperative CSI changes and postoperative outcome than compared with EEG (r =0.2466, P =0.556). A discrimination analysis demonstrates a linear function between the severity of contralateral CSI changes (group 11 and 111) and the postoperative outcome. Conclusion: CSI changes have a pedietive value for the postoperative outcome in patients with TLE. In patients with severe bilateral CSI changes recidivism must be expected.",

Wilms; LeuvenlBPurpose: To compare brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with computed tomography (CT) in patients referred from the Neurology and Neurosurgery outpatient c1inics. The purpose was to test measures of the dec ision-making process and pat ient outcome. Methods and Materials: One hund red consecutive patients, referred for a first and non-urgent brain CT, were enrolled after having given the ir informed consent and underwent MR imaging the same day. A routine turbo spin-echo T2-weighted sequence was compared to a rapid single echo T2-weighted sequence. Funct ional and general health status were measured at baseline and at 3 months. The clinicians answered aseries of questions for assessment of the diagnostic and therapeutic effects of the imaging studies . Results: Most examinations (77 %) revealed no abnormality. Both CT and MR showed abnormalities in 10% of the patients but MR showed more abnormalities in 50% of them . MR showed abnormalities while CT remained normal in 12% of the patients . Five patients could not undergo MR because of e1austrophobia (n = 2) or a ferromagnetic implant (n = 3). Conclusion: There is a growing press ure for outcome stud ies of diagnostic tests. We compared MR imaging with CT and found that CT was satisfactory in more than 80% of the cases. MR imaging had a therapeutic impact in 2 patients by providing more information than CT. The rapid T2-weighted sequence provided the same information as the routine T2-weighted sequence. Measures of the decision-mak ing process and patient outcome will be discussed. CT was performed in all and MR in 6 patients. In all children additional cytogenetic, metabolic and serological investigations were performed to detect the aetiology of brain abnormalities. Results: US demonstrated widespread cortical dysgenesis in 15 children as folIows: 1. Lysencephaly combined with more complex anomalies in 2 children and isolated in one. 2. Pachygyria -in 8 children (isolated in 2 and accompanied by complex anomalies in 6) 3. Hemimegalencephaly in 2 children, accompanied by pachygyria and leukodystrophy. 4. Shizencephaly in 2 children combined with other anomalies. US findings were confirmed in all 15 children by CT and additionally by MR in 6 patients. Using combined clinical, neuroimaging, laboratory, cytogenetic and serological investigations the definitive diagnosis was obtained in 6 children as folIows: Miller-Dieker sy. (1), Klippel-Weber Trainaut (1), Walker-Warburg (2) and conatal CMV infection in 2 children. Conclusion: High resolution US is sufficient modality in assessment of widespread cortical dysgenesis as weil as in cases when they are accompanied by other gross anomalies of the brain. MRI data from comatose patients after haed injury are scarce, because MRI is somewhat cumbersome to perform in patients requiring ventilation and in the first hours after injury its relevance is c1early inferior to",

Bilateral pontine lesions proved to be 100% fatal, non-brain stem lesion had a mortality of 10%. In singular cases circumstances allowed for a clear clinical distinction between primary and secondary brain stem lesions. Primary lesions on MRI were mixed hyper-and hypointense after intervals of more than 2 days after the injury. In one cleary scondary and fatal brain stem lesion there were no traces of blood. It is concluded that brain stem lesions are more frequent in severe head injury than previously reported from studies based on neuropathological or CT data. Early MRI after head injury is of higher predictive value than CT and possibly allows for differentiation between primary and secondary brain stem lesions. Purpose: To analyze brain CT and MRI findings of subacute stages of methanol intoxicated patients, as weil as clinical relevance of these features. Methods and Materials: Four patients intoxicated accidentally with alcoholic beverage (30-33% of methyl alcohol), admitted to MMA during a single outbreak were studied by enhanced brain MRI and CT. Two patients presented with coma, one with psychoorganic syndrome, and one with visual disturbances. Neurophysiological and toxicological analyses were done and one fatal case was underwent patologic correlation. Results: Brain CT predominantly showed necrosis and haemorrhage of bilateral putamina, globus pallidus and claustrum and post-contrast enhancement of corpus striatum. Subcortical white matter necrosis of frontal lobes and postcontrast gyral enhancement was noted. Preferential localization of methanol-induced lesions on enhanced MRI within the putamina, globus pallidus and c1austrum was observed in three cases too. Globus pallidus and putamen enhanced after Gd contrast. Subcortical and deep white matter necrosis of variable extent in frontal and occipital and less in parietal regions was seen, as weil as its postcontrast enhancement. Conclusion: Characteristic enhanced CT findings are helpful in the diagnosis of methanol poisoning and specific pattern of brain lesions on enhanced MRI is valuable tool in toxicological surveillance. Acute lead encephalopathy (ALE) is increasingly reported in Europe and North America among immigrants from the Middle East and Indian Subcontinent, where lead is used in folk medicine. Purpose: To present the c1inico-radiological manifestations of ALE and the role of radiology in its management. Methods and Patients: Prospective study of 45 children with ALE, aged 11 days-8 years. We analysed indications for lead prescriptions, clinico-radiological characteristics and final outcome of ALE. Results: Lead preparations contained 3.87-93% lead by weight. They were prescribed by parents and traditional healers for colics, ablation of umbilical cordstumps, constipation, diarrhoea, intercurrent illnesses. teething pain, against devils and facial make-up. Patients presented with anaemia, abdominal pain, irritability, hyperreflexia, seizures, stupor and coma. Whole blood lead levels were 2.2.-46 mmols/l. 3% had lead gum-lines, 13% basophilic stippled RBCs. All had skeletal lead lines. CT-brain findings: 11% normal, 11% hydrocephalus with posterior fossa pseudotumour, 11% subdural hygromas, 13% calcifications, 33% atrophy, 44% oedema. All were treated conservatively except 2 who were shunted for acute hydrocephalus. Conclusion: ALE is a cultural-iatrogenic problem with high mortality and neuro-behavioural sequelae. Radiology is important in its early diagnosis.A. Tartaro, S. Budassi, D. Antonucci, L. Bonomo; ChietillPurpose: To analyse skull base anomalies in patients with craniofacial dysostosis. Methods and Materials: A retrospective analysis of imaging study in 64 children affected by craniofacial abnormalities (25 plagiocephaly. 14 scaphocephaly, 12 trigonocephaly, 8 brachycephaly, 3 Kleeblattsch\u00e4del, 2 acrocephaly) was carried out using 3D spiral CT. Scan parameters were: 3-5 mm slice thickness ; table feed 5 mm/sec; image reconstructions at 2 mm interval ; 120 kV, 165 mAs. Aseries of qualitative and quant itative assessment of the skull base and intracranial structures was performed. Two radiologists, in joint session, analysed the following sutures and synchondrosis: spheno-o ccipital synchondrosis, petrooccipital synchondrosis, anterior intraoccipital synchondrosis, intrasphenoidal synchondrosis, occipito-mastoidal sutures; moreover, the naslonclinoid-petrous, the nasion-c1inoid-pterional and the nasion-clinoidalbasion angles were evaluated . Results: Skull base abnormalities were present in all patients. Skull base angles were abnormal in all patients affected by plagiocephaly. Complex craniosynostosis showed alterations of occipital synchondrosis.Conclusion: A wide range of CT abnormalities are present in the craniofacial synostosis. Some of these are c1early primary, whereas others appear to be related to the small skull base and sutural synostosis . Skull base deformities can playa role in the etiopathogenes is of craniosynostosis. These anomalies were especially common in patients affected by plagiocephaly. Purpose: Primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNET) are highly malignant, undifferentiated supratentorial neoplasms which frequently seed in the central nervous system. PNET occur primarily in young children; in adults they are extremely rare. Previous reports on the neuroradiological findings refer solely to PNET in children.Methods and Materials: The CT scans and MR images of five adults (three males, two females) with histologically proven PNET of the cerebra l hemispheres were reviewed retrospectively. Results: In this series, PNET were rather large, heterogeneous masses w ilh eyslic and neerolie areas, inlralumoral haemorrhage and focal calcification. In 4/5 patients , the tumour showed well-defined margins by CT as weil as MR with only a thin rim of oedema . In 315 patients, the tumour mass was iso-or hyperdense on NECT scans which is presumably due to the high nuclear to cytoplasm ic ratio found in PNET. MR images showed the tumour to be mildly hypoinlense on Tl W images and hyperintense on T2W images. The prominent contrast enhancement on both CT and MR scans reflects the increased vascularity of PNET. Conclusion: Understanding PNET is important for the radiologist 00cause certain neuroradiological features may suggest their diagnosis. Because of their prospensity to spread throughout the cerebrospinal fluid pathways, an MR examination of the spinal cana l should be performed If a PNET is suspected .",
