            "text": "The microbiology of periodontal diseases has been the focus of intense investigation for several decades. This focus is justifiable because bacteria are the etiological agents of periodontal diseases, which remain the primary cause of tooth loss in adults worldwide. In addition, therapies that predictably can treat the condition in all subjects are still missing, as evidenced by the existence of refractory cases in which disease continues to progress despite comprehensive periodontal treatment. As a result of efforts to understand the microbiota of periodontal diseases and the continuous dedication of researchers in the field, our knowledge of the structure and composition of the polymicrobial biofilms associated with periodontal health and disease has expanded exponentially in the past few decades. In fact, the oral microbiota is one of the best-characterized microbiomes that colonize the human body. Despite this increased knowledge, one has to ask if our fundamental understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of periodontal diseases has really changed.",

These technologies have allowed us, for instance, to examine the presence of the unculturable segment of the subgingival microbiota in greater detail, expanding our knowledge of the diversity of the supragingival and subgingival microbiotas. Furthermore, molecular techniques have afforded examination of the potential role of viruses in periodontal disease etiology. Other recent critical changes in our knowledge of periodontal infections derive from the realization that these diseases are caused by biofilms rather than by bacteria in a planktonic state and through the adoption of ecological concepts for studying the acquisition and maturation of the oral microbiota. Although these conceptual changes have helped to revamp our interest in the microbiology of periodontal diseases, a review of the classic literature on this topic questions how groundbreaking these concepts really are. By revisiting the literature on the microbial etiology of periodontal diseases for the purpose of this manuscript, we will illustrate how the essence of our understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of periodontal diseases has been in place for decades.",

At times the focus of the scientific community has shifted from the microbial etiology of periodontal diseases to other aspects of the pathogenesis of these infections, including the impact of genetic and environmental factors on the initiation and progression of these conditions. Paul Keyes once wrote: I am convinced that although many clinicians and investigators do not exclude the role of bacteria in periodontal lesions, at this point interest in microorganisms often dissipates and attention shifts to other areas. (Keyes (173)) In recent years, much attention has been given to the essential role of inflammation and other immune mechanisms in periodontal disease pathogenesis. These studies are fundamental to our understanding of the complex mechanisms involved in these multifactorial diseases. Unfortunately, at times, this change in focus has been misconstrued as \u00d4evidence\u00d5 of a lesser role of the supragingival and subgingival microbiota in the etiology of periodontal diseases. Furthermore, the study of the microbial etiology of periodontal diseases has also suffered the impact of vagaries of the funding agencies, compromising the continuity of efforts in this field. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that there is still much work to be done before we can fully understand how the subgingival microbiota interacts with the host to result in periodontal diseases.",

Before we elaborate on this point we should be clear about the concept of \u00d4etiology\u00d5. As defined in the Merriam-Webster dictionary (Merriam-Webster.com), etiology is \u00d4the cause or causes of a disease or abnormal condition\u00d5. Therefore, by characterizing bacteria as the etiological agents of periodontal diseases, we are stating that they cause these diseases. Let us elaborate further on the definition of cause. Rothman & Greenland (297) defined cause as \u00d4an antecedent event, condition, or characteristic that was necessary for the occurrence of the disease at the moment it occurred, given that other conditions are fixed\u00d5. By this definition, it becomes clear that bacteria are not sufficient to cause periodontal diseases; in fact, Rothman & Greenland (297) stressed that \u00d4no specific event, condition, or characteristic is sufficient by itself to produce disease\u00d5. They went on to describe \u00d4sufficient cause\u00d5 as the constellation of minimal conditions and events that produce disease. Implicit in the word \u00d4minimal\u00d5 is the idea that all the conditions and events are essential for disease to occur. Onset of disease will occur when all minimal conditions of the sufficient cause have taken place.",

            "text": "These concepts agree with our understanding of periodontal diseases as multifactorial diseases. In 1994, Haffajee & Socransky (131) argued that periodontal disease initiation and progression required the simultaneous occurrence of a number of factors: (i) the virulent periodontal pathogen (we will elaborate further on this concept later; for now this would be equivalent to bacteria); (ii) the local environment; and (iii) host susceptibility. Indeed, the notion that variation in \u00d4host resistance\u00d5 impacts the outcome of periodontal diseases has been recognized since at least the 1970s (332) . Later, Page & Kornman (266) expanded this model to acknowledge the contributions of genetic and acquired risk factors. The concept of multiple causes is clearly not unique to periodontal diseases; although tobacco smoking is well accepted as a cause of lung cancer, it is also clear that by itself it is not a sufficient cause. The requirement of susceptibility of the host for the development of periodontal diseases has led some to refer to bacteria as a condition \u00d4required but not sufficient\u00d5 to cause periodontal diseases. This is a moot point because no disease process is the result of a single isolated cause or event (i.e. no cause is necessary and sufficient in itself to produce disease). Furthermore, for any given infection, if disease is to result from a host-microbe interaction, the host has to be susceptible. This causal model can also accommodate variations in the dose of each component in the constellation of sufficient causes. The model described above for sufficient causes for periodontal tissue destruction (bacteria, local environment and host susceptibility) can easily accommodate the notion of varying doses. For instance, if a susceptible host has an immunodeficiency, a lower bacterial challenge might be enough to complete the minimal conditions that result in periodontal disease.",

According to this concept, observational epidemiology should serve as the basis for hypotheses of causality, which would then be tested using laboratory experiments and human clinical trials. Randomized clinical trials, cohort studies and case-control studies are examples of highlevel evidence, while case-series, biological plausibility, \u00d4pathophysiological reasoning\u00d5, animal studies, bench research and expert opinion are characterized as low-level evidence. The experimental gingivitis classical study performed by L\u00f6e et al. (213) was cited as an example of \u00d4low-level\u00d5 evidence that infection leads to destructive periodontal disease. It was argued that the study was flawed because it had a small sample size of 12 subjects, used an acute model to make inferences on a chronic disease and the findings were extrapolated to periodontitis that, according to the author, was \u00d4a huge leap\u00d5. This is not the first time that the infectious nature of periodontal diseases has been put into question and is a good example of the vicious cycle of \u00d4lessons learned and unlearned\u00d5 in periodontal microbiology. As described by Socransky & Haffajee in their paper on the historical perspective of the bacterial etiology of periodontal diseases, between the mid-1920s and the early 1960s, periodontal diseases were considered to be the result of some constitutional defect on the part of the patient, trauma from occlusion, disuse atrophy or some combination of those factors (335) . Additional theories proposed in the past included local irritation from calculus, rough restoration margins, systemic diseases and conditions, diet and nutritional deficiencies (269) .",

            "text": "The concept of an infectious cause for periodontal diseases had, in fact, its modern resurgence (during the late 1950s and the 1960s) partially as a result of cross-sectional studies that suggested a close association between the level of bacterial debris on tooth surfaces and the extent and severity of gingival inflammation (18, 121, 224, 315) . Therefore, at least for gingivitis, the infectious theory of causation did follow the so-called epidemiological baton. The classical studies on experimental gingivitis were pioneers in the sense that, for the first time, the reversal phase of gingival inflammation was closely observed after subjects resumed their oral-hygiene practices. This satisfies the condition of \u00d4experimental evidence\u00d5, as described by Hill in 1965 (152) in his list of considerations on the determination of causality, or the criterion of \u00d4elimination\u00d5, according to the criteria of Haffajee & Socransky for defining periodontal pathogens (131) , regarding the cause-effect relationship between dental plaque and gingivitis. Since its description, \u00d4experimental gingivitis\u00d5 has become a standard model for examining the effects of different antiplaque agents and in the study of risk factors for the development of gingivitis and therefore has been reproduced hundreds of times. In fact, in 1971, L\u00f6e (210) reported that up to that time 150 students had already participated in several studies conducted by his group using the experimental gingivitis model. The criticism that the model has an acute onset quite distinct from the chronic nature of gingivitis is valid. However, human studies have documented the resolution and prevention of recurrence of naturally occurring gingivitis following mechanical plaque removal, similar to the observations by L\u00f6e and co-authors using the acute model (25, 196, 223, 351) .",

Indirect evidence for a role of plaque accumulation and periodontitis has also been provided by studies demonstrating that meticulous supragingival plaque control can arrest the progression of destructive periodontal diseases for prolonged periods of time (23, 24, 26, 27, 351) . The concept that gingivitis would inevitably result in attachment loss was eventually challenged by additional epidemiological studies demonstrating that a subset of individuals would not develop periodontitis even after years of exposure to large amounts of plaque accumulation and long-standing gingivitis (212) . In any case, the original experimental gingivitis studies have been presented in the periodontal literature as evidence of a cause-and-effect relationship between dental plaque and gingivitis, but not between dental plaque and periodontitis.",

This finding suggested a less robust association between dental plaque accumulation and attachment loss compared with the association between dental plaque accumulation and gingivitis, casting doubt on the theory of the infectious nature of periodontitis. This apparent disconnect between plaque accumulation and periodontal tissue destruction can be partially explained by examining further the precision (or lack thereof) of existing methods to measure the amount of bacterial challenge (we will address differences in the nature of the bacterial challenge later in the text). The limitations of the many plaque indices that have been employed in epidemiological surveys are notorious. First, plaque accumulation varies within a period of hours and therefore the same subject can have dramatically different plaqueaccumulation scores depending on the time of the day when the measurements are taken (237) . Indices of gingival inflammation have been proposed as a better assessment of the consistency of the individ-ual\u00d5s oral-hygiene practices because they would reflect exposure of plaque over time. Still, the inflammatory gingival status of a subject also fluctuates over relatively brief periods of time (days), depending on the efficacy and consistency of the oralhygiene practices performed by the subject. Therefore, it is unreasonable to expect that cross-sectional measures of plaque accumulation, even when repeated a few times, would give a very accurate assessment of the long-term exposure to the bacterial challenge. This is particularly relevant if one considers the chronic nature of periodontal diseases and the lengthy time required for attachment loss to occur.",

            "text": "Analogous to this situation is the observation that bleeding on probing was found to be a poor predictor of periodontal disease progression, casting doubt on the relevance of gingival inflammation in this process (197) . Data from a recent longitudinal study that followed a cohort of 223 Norwegian subjects over 26 years have clearly demonstrated that long-term, constant exposure to gingivitis was a risk factor for attachment loss and tooth loss (313, 314) . A recently published paper examined the oral condition of subjects from New Zealand over a time period of 32 years (43) . The study population initially comprised 1,037 children. Oral examinations were repeated at ages 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 21, 26 and 35 years . Data for at least four time points, including the baseline and the last visit, were available for 911 subjects. Plaque scores were assessed using Greene and Vermillion\u00d5s Simplified Oral Hygiene Index, and patterns of \u00d4lifetime plaque exposure\u00d5 were determined using group-based trajectory modeling. Three subgroups were characterized, according to their \u00d4trends\u00d5 in plaque exposure over the years, as high, medium and low trajectories. Periodontal disease parameters were measured in 897 subjects at age 32 years. Using this approach the authors could examine the potential role of the cumulative exposure to dental plaque over many years as a risk factor for periodontal disease initiation and progression. The results from multivariate models indicated that higher \u00d4plaque trajectories\u00d5 were indeed associated with poorer oral-health outcomes, including caries-and periodontal disease-related measurements. These outcomes were present even after adjusting for confounding variables such as childhood socio-economic status, gender, dental-visit patterns and smoking. In summary, the failure of early epidemiological studies to detect a close correlation between plaque accumulation and periodontal disease occurrence and progression might have been a result of the imprecise measurement of exposure to the bacterial challenge. The effect of long-term exposure to other well-established risk factors for periodontal disease progression, such as cigarette smoking, can be better estimated through, for instance, the use of questionnaires. Unfortunately, one cannot estimate, using questionnaires, how many \u00d4plaque-years\u00d5 a subject has been exposed to.",

Since then, clinical trials continue to indicate that the adjunctive use of systemic antibiotics, particularly the combination of amoxicillin and metronidazole, result in significant improvements over the clinical results obtained with mechanical therapy alone (54, 90, 125, 135, 151, 232, 240, 245, 385) . These results are compelling evidence of the bacterial etiology of periodontal diseases, particularly because these agents, in contrast to other classes of antibiotics (153) , have no known anti-inflammatory effects. Even more persuasive was the report by Lopez and colleagues (220), on the outcome of a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial carried out to examine the clinical effects of amoxicillin and metronidazole as the sole therapy for chronic periodontitis. Patients were examined every 2 months for 12 months to detect periodontal disease progression by changes in clinical attachment level. The antibiotic regimen (amoxicillin 500 mg and metronidazole 250 mg, three times daily for 7 days) was administered at baseline, and at 4 and 8 months. The antibiotics group had statistically significantly better clinical outcomes at all 2-month intervals, including a lower percentage of progressing sites. Periodontal sites that exhibited multiple cycles of disease progression and periodontal abscesses were detected only in the placebo group. This study was followed by another clinical trial that examined the clinical and microbiological effects of a single regimen of this systemic antimicrobial combination as the sole therapy. It was demonstrated that the clinical improvements were accompanied by statistically significant reductions in most of the 40 species investigated using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (221) . These intervention studies provided additional support to the bacterial etiology of periodontitis; furthermore, they indicated that live bacteria, rather than the mere presence of their constituents, are key elements in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.",

In addition, cases of acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis and localized juvenile periodontites (now known as localized aggressive periodontitis), where clinically distinct periodontal diseases were associated with distinctly different subgingival microbiotas, also helped create momentum for the reintroduction of the specific plaque hypothesis. Particularly, cases of localized aggressive periodontitis, where very little plaque accumulation and clinical signs of gingival inflammation were accompanied by severe connective tissue destruction and bone loss, challenged the notion that the mass of bacterial plaque was the key element. The accepted dogma became that specific microorganisms were associated with different periodontal diseases and hence several groups embarked on the search for the periodontal pathogens responsible for different periodontal conditions (87, 88, 132, 244, 246, 329, 334, 338, 340, 378) . We referred to these historic events as being responsible for the reintroduction of the notion of specificity in periodontal infections because, as pointed out by Socransky & Haffajee in 1994 (335) , scientists started to look for the etiological agents of periodontal diseases in the 1880s. It was not until the mid-1930s that the search for the microorganisms responsible for destructive periodontal diseases was interrupted. Here we have yet another example of the cycle of lessons learned and unlearned in the field of periodontal microbiology.",

Out of this hard work, several putative periodontal pathogens were identified, culminating with the designation of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (currently Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia as periodontal pathogens in the 1996 World Workshop in Periodontics (2) . These efforts are still ongoing and will probably require a few decades of intense research before we have identified all periodontal pathogens or combinations of pathogens that can lead to periodontal destruction. Difficulties in determining the role of specific components in the subgingival microbiota include: (i) the diversity of microbial taxa that can be found in the subgingival environment, many of which are still unculturable; (ii) difficulties in obtaining a representative sample;",

The criteria included: association; elimination; host response; virulence factor; animal studies; and risk assessment. Much of our current understanding of the potential role of different species as etiological agents of periodontal diseases comes from data obtained using molecular techniques that overcame many of the limitations of culture techniques. However, out of the six criteria listed by Haffajee & Socransky, only three (association, elimination and risk assessment) can be fulfilled using molecular techniques alone. Furthermore, different clonal types of the same species might have distinct pathogenic potentials, and the existing techniques used in the study of virulent strains of the same species, such as multiple locus sequence typing and comparative genomic hybridization, require culture. Therefore, if we are to fully examine the pathogenic potential of yet-uncultured species, methods to grow them in the laboratory will have to be in place.",

They characterized the search for periodontal pathogens as another example of cycles of lessons learned and unlearned in the field of periodontal microbiology, where putative pathogens were proposed and subsequently forgotten or dismissed \u00d4in a seemingly never ending cycle\u00d5. In their manuscript they detailed a series of difficulties encountered by microbiologists in the study of periodontal pathogens, including: (i) technical difficulties (sample taking, dispersion of plaque samples, culture, and characterization and identification of isolates); (ii) conceptual problems (complexity of the microbiota, mixed infections, opportunistic infections, identifying disease activity, different diseases diagnosed as being the same and the possibility of multiple diseases within a subject); and (iii) data analysis. Despite the considerable technological advances since the publication of that paper, it can be argued that none of these issues has been satisfactorily resolved and all remain as obstacles to the precise definition of the etiologic agents of periodontal diseases. If nothing else, the expansion of our knowledge regarding the complexity of the subgingival microbiota has only aggravated many of these problems, particularly the difficulties in data analysis. In spite of these challenges, the efforts of microbiologists have helped to define a relatively short list of likely candidates as periodontal pathogens, including: P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, A. actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, Eikenella corrodens, Prevotella nigrescens, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Treponema socranskii, Eubacterium nodatum and Campylobacter rectus (126, 141, 222, 271, 273, 308, 382, 383, 405) . Other species have also been reported, by different groups, to be associated with periodontal diseases, including: Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella denticola, Filifactor alocis and Cryptobacterium curtum (188) ; Eubacterium saphenum and Mogibacterium timidum (235); Prevotella corporis, Prevotella disiens and Peptostreptococcus magnus (304) ; Slackia exigua (39); Treponema maltophilum and Treponema sp.

The concept refers to the requirement that the cause precedes the effect in time. Therefore, if one postulates that P. gingivalis causes periodontal tissue destruction, there should be evidence of its presence before the detection of attachment loss or bone loss. Several studies have tried to establish temporality in an effort to implicate specific bacterial species in the etiology of periodontal diseases, and mixed results were obained (87, 98, 137, 138, 322, 353, 354) . Still, it can be argued, based on the studies by Fine et al. (99) , that the criterion of temporality can be used in support of an etiological role for A. actinomycetemcomitans in cases of localized aggressive periodontitis. At times, it has been argued that the increased levels and proportions of certain species in diseased sites occur as a consequence of the environmental changes resulting from the disease process. Although this might well be the case, one must bear in mind that the detection of increased levels of putative periodontal pathogens after tissue destruction has occurred is not evidence against its pathogenic role. In addition, there is also the possibility that in other circumstances the same species might cause periodontal tissue destruction, or that it might be responsible for further destruction at a later time (297) .",

Current models of periodontal disease progression posit that tissue destruction progresses through periods of acute exacerbations (activity) followed by periods of remission (120, 130, 133, 134) . At any given time, different sites in an individual\u00d5s mouth might be at different stages of disease progression. Clinically, the only way of determining that a periodontal site has undergone periodontal disease progression is by measuring longitudinal changes in the clinical attachment level. This implies that in order to determine disease activity, longitudinal monitoring at close time intervals is required. This has been the approach used by many investigators in the past in order to assess risk factors for periodontal disease initiation and progression (133) . Typically, study subjects are monitored clinically every 2 months, bacterial samples are collected at baseline and when disease progression is diagnosed, and the microbial composition of the subgingival microbiota is examined to determine species potentially involved in disease progression (87) . A limitation of early studies was the low throughput of existing microbiological techniques, which restricted the number of samples that could be conveniently collected and processed. Nevertheless, these studies have helped to implicate several subgingival species in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.",

If a sudden change in the composition of the subgingival microbiota triggers a cascade of events (e.g. the appropriate immuno-inflammatory response) that eventually lead to tissue destruction of the magnitude that can be detected as changes in clinical attachment level, one still needs to determine the induction period linking the two events. As of now, we have no concept of the length of time that separates changes in the subgingival microbiota and periodontal tissue destruction (assuming that these two events are linked). This simple consideration complicates considerably the determination if any given event satisfies the condition of temporality proposed by Hill (152) . Furthermore, because any disease process is caused by a constellation of causes, each one will have its own induction time and only when all are in place will disease occur.",

In our current model of periodontal disease pathogenesis, it is well accepted that immune pathology is a major mechanism of tissue destruction. Hence, after the climax community that causes disease has been established, the immuno-inflammatory response that it triggers (which has its own induction time) needs to be in place for tissue destruction to occur. The terms \u00d4initiator\u00d5 and \u00d4promoter\u00d5 have been used in carcinogenesis to describe component causes of cancer that act early or late in the causal mechanism (297) . In the context of periodontitis, bacteria could be described as the initiator and the inflammatory response as the promoter. This is an obvious oversimplification as the immuno-inflammatory response by the host encompasses many mechanisms that might be required for tissue destruction to occur, each one with its own induction time. For instance, the mechanisms involved in the early lesion described by Page & Schroeder (268) can also be thought of as initiators, while the final mechanisms that result in bone resorption (such as activation of osteoclasts) might be defined as promoters. Owing to the chronic nature of periodontal diseases, one might anticipate that early initiators (bacteria are most likely in this category) might have long induction periods of months or years. It is likely that the longitudinal monitoring of periodontal diseases has a better chance of identifying promoters with a short induction time (i.e. mechanisms that occur later in the chain of events that lead to periodontal tissue destruction).",

The hypothesis was based primarily on association studies that demonstrated an increase in the load of Epstein-Barr virus type 1, human cytomegalovirus and other herpesviruses in sites and in subjects with periodontal diseases compared with subjects with gingivitis and periodontally healthy controls. This hypothesis posits that subgingival bacteria and viruses infecting the adjacent periodontal tissues would form a pathogenic consortium (327) . In fact, synergy between viruses and bacteria has been demonstrated in several clinically relevant infections, including: respiratory infections (influenza-associated pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Moraxella catarrhalis); acute otitis media (rhinovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus, influenza virus, human cytomegalovirus and other herpesviruses associated with H. influenza, S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis or Prevotella and Peptostreptococcus species); bacterial sinusitis following viral colds; pharyngotonsillitis (Epstein-Barr virus-induced overgrowth of P. intermedia and F. nucleatum); and gastroenteritis (associated with rotavirus, adenovirus, norovirus, astrovirus and bacterial taxa such as E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella and Campylobacter jejuni) (326) . In a mouse model, co-infection with murine cytomegalovirus and P. gingivalis resulted in a significantly higher rate of mortality compared with mice monoinfected with either pathogen alone (346) . Early models of combined viral-bacterial synergistic infections proposed primarily that the polymicrobial infection would enhance the virulence of bacteria or decrease their clearance. However, recent studies have suggested that this coinfection could also enhance the pathogenicity of the virus. For instance, P. gingivalis sonicate can reactivate Epstein-Barr virus (347) . Interestingly, Barton et al. (32) reported results suggesting that herpesvirus latency can confer symbiotic protection against bacterial infections. In a mouse model, latent infection with murine gammaherpesvirus or murine cytomeg-alovirus provided resistance to infection with Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia pestis owing to an elevation in the expression of interferon gamma and to macrophage activation.",

It has been demonstrated that herpesviruses can produce virus-derived homologues of the antiinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10 (204) , and other inhibitors of a T-helper 1 cell response (330) . In animal models, cytomegalovirus can impair neutrophil chemotaxis, phagocytosis, the oxidative burst and intracellular killing capacity (5) . Periodontitis subjects with subgingival herpesviruses had reduced neutrophil chemotaxis and bactericidal activity compared with herpesvirus-free individuals (326) . Herpesviruses can also interfere with the antibacterial functions of macrophages and the complement system (205, 214) . In addition, human cytomegalovirus IL-10 can suppress the transcription of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1b (250) . Alternatively, viruses might induce the release of catabolic inflammatory mediators or other immunopathological mechanisms, causing indirect damage to periodontal tissues. For instance, herpesvirus reactivation induces a major increase in the numbers of cytotoxic T-cells and the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (243) . Herpesviruses were shown to induce collagen degradation in an in-vitro system (40) . In fact, several of the features of periodontal disease pathogenesis can potentially be explained by viral infections. For instance, the conversion of a gingivitis lesion to a periodontitis lesion and of a stable lesion to a progressing one could reflect cycles of activity and latency in herpesvirus infection of the periodontium (324) . Herpesvirus reactivation can be triggered by many immunosuppressing factors that have also been implicated as risk factors or risk indicators for periodontal infections (328) . In addition, the localized nature of the periodontal lesions could be associated with the tissue tropism of herpesvirus infections, while absence of viral infection or latency of the infection might help explain the presence of periodontal pathogens in periodontally healthy tissues and in stable periodontal lesions (62) .",

Epstein-Barr virus-1, human cytomegalovirus and other herpesviruses have been detected at high frequency and high levels in localized and generalized aggressive periodontitis, chronic periodontitis and acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (328) . It is noteworthy that the elevated frequency of detection of herpesviruses in periodontitis lesions from subjects with gingivitis compared with periodontally healthy subjects has been reported by studies examining samples from different geographic locations (40, 47, 48, 160, 179, 311, 350, 401) . Sites with active periodontitis also carry significantly higher numbers of lymphocytes with latent viruses than do stable sites (409) . Viral DNA has been detected not only in subgingival plaque samples (401) and in gingival crevicular fluid samples (40) , but also in samples from the adjacent inflamed periodontal pocket wall (185) and in surgically removed inflamed periodontal tissues (61) . Periodontal lesions infected with Epstein-Barr virus-1, human cytomegalovirus, or both, also harbored elevated levels of periodontal pathogens such as P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, Dialister pneumosintes, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, C. rectus, T. denticola and A. actinomycetemcomitans (63, 169, 310, 311, 325) . The human cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus counts correlated positively with clinical parameters of periodontal disease, such as clinical attachment level, pocket depth and bleeding on probing (311) . B-lymphocytes and monocytes \u2044 macrophages in periodontal lesions can be infected with Epstein-Barr virus-1, and T-lymphocytes present in periodontal lesions can be infected with human cytomegalovirus (62, 63) . Intervention studies have demonstrated that periodontal mechanical therapy can reduce the levels of herpesviruses (123, 309) and that human cytomegalovirus seems to be particularly susceptible to the effects of periodontal therapy (298) . The reduction in the amount of inflammatory infiltrate in the adjacent periodontal tissues might result in lower numbers of infected immune cells (326) . Sunde et al. (350) reported on the treatment of a subject with refractory periodontitis, who exhibited high levels of subgingival Epstein-Barr virus, using the antiviral drug valacyclovir-HCl, 500 mg twice daily for 10 days. The therapy resulted in the suppression of Epstein-Barr virus for up to 1 year and resulted in a significant clinical improvement with reductions in pocket depth and bleeding on probing.",

The expression of mRNA for inflammatory markers in tissue samples was also measured using real-time PCR. The results indicated a higher severity of periodontal disease in the chronic periodontitis \u2044 human T lymphotropic virus-1 group compared with the group of subjects with chronic periodontitis only. Individuals seropositive for human T lymphotropic virus-1 had significantly higher levels of interleukin-1b, and interferon-c mRNA, elevated expression of interleukin-12 and of interleukin-17, and similar levels of expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-4 compared with seronegative subjects. Conversely, expression of both the regulatory T-cell marker, FOXp3, and interleukin-10 was significantly decreased in the lesions from the chronic periodontitis \u2044 human T lymphotropic virus-1 subjects compared with samples from the subjects with chronic periodontitis only and control groups. Interestingly, the levels of periodontal pathogens such as P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, T. denticola and A. actinomycetemcomitans, and of herpes simplex virus 1, Epstein-Barr virus and human cytomegalovirus, were similar in samples from the chronic periodontitis \u2044 human T lymphotropic virus-1 and chronic periodontitis groups. The authors concluded that human T lymphotropic virus-1 might alter the local cytokine milieu, resulting in an increased immuno-inflammatory response to a similar bacterial challenge when compared with human T lymphotropic virus-1-seronegative subjects.",

(349) failed to find an association between human cytomegalovirus and periodontal lesions and found that the levels of Epstein-Barr virus were very close to the lower detection limit of the real-time PCR assay that they used. The authors argued that the association between the presence of viral particles and periodontal lesions might simply reflect a higher content of blood-and virus-infected lymphocytes. They noted that several viruses can be present and replicate in human cells without causing disease symptoms, and cautioned against the clinical relevance of the presence of viruses in periodontal lesions and their role in the pathogenesis of periodontal infections. Furthermore, they suggested that evidence of active viral infection, such as the presence of high levels of viral particles and \u2044 or the detection of cells producing viral RNA or protein, would provide better support for a role of viruses in the etiology of periodontal diseases. In this context, significantly more herpesvirus genomic copies are found in progressive and untreated periodontal lesions than in stable or treated periodontitis sites (up to 8.3 \u00b7 10 8 Epstein-Barr virus copies and 4.6 \u00b7 10 5 human cytomegalovirus DNA copies in samples of individual periodontal pockets), suggesting possible active replication. In fact, the total count of viruses in severe periodontitis lesions might approach that of bacteria (326) .",

If viruses are involved in the initiation and progression of periodontal disease, it is anticipated that viral replication would occur before periods of disease activity or progression. This implies that longitudinal monitoring of progressing periodontal lesions would be required to determine \u00d4tem-porality\u00d5 in the cause-effect relationship between viral activation and periodontal tissue destruction. To complicate matters further, oral herpesvirus reactivation in immunocompetent subjects is a phenomenon that lasts for only a few hours or a few days (228) , making its detection quite difficult. In addition, as discussed for specific bacterial species, the induction period between viral activation and disease progression is unknown and might be rather lengthy. Largescale intervention studies with the use of antiviral drugs will also be difficult to implement. Although these drugs can be orally administered and are well tolerated with mild side effects, they are only effective against viruses in the lytic phase, limiting their use to a time when active viral infection is occurring. As a result of difficulties in selecting for active viral replication, it can be anticipated that expanding the experiment reported in the case report described by Sunde et al. (350) to a large-scale clinical trial would be challenging. mRNA for herpesvirus genes that encode structural proteins can be used as markers of active herpesvirus infection. Therefore, in the near future, metatranscriptomic analysis of biofilm or tissue samples might help to elucidate a potential association between active viral replication and periodontal disease onset and progression.",

The understanding that bacteria live in communities and have sophisticated molecular mechanisms of communication among themselves has shaped our understanding of microbial infections in recent years. It is now recognized that more than 65% of all bacterial infections in humans are associated with biofilms (201) and it is estimated that <0.1% of the total microbial biomass lives in the planktonic mode of growth (37) . Biofilms are characterized by heterogeneous microenvironments within their structure, determined by the gradients of nutrients, oxygen and metabolic waste that provide growth conditions for multiple species and different strains of the same species with distinct phenotypic traits (36) . The specialization of subpopulations within the biofilm structure, the so-called \u00d4division of labour\u00d5 (15) , has also been described as a common feature of the biofilm mode of growth (36) . The understanding of biofilms as multispecies communities has shifted the focus from the role of individual species within the biofilm to a more holistic view of how biofilms as a whole cause and perpetuate chronic infections.",

Early descriptions of different stages in dental plaque development and maturation on tooth surfaces were detailed by studies using light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. For instance, the notion that dental biofilms grow by lateral spread, followed by a gain in thickness as a consequence of the multiplication of early colonizers, comes from those pioneer studies. Competition for space and nutrients, aggregation of bacteria from different species and the columnar pattern of microbial colonies in mature supragingival plaque (with filamentous bacteria perpendicular to the tooth surface) were features readily recognized. Those early studies also demonstrated how certain bacterial species tend to thrive under specific environmental conditions and become organized into communities, giving supragingival and subgingival biofilms their unique structural characteristics. Interestingly, none of the microscopic images of in-vivo supragingival dental plaque has revealed the so-called mushroom structures often found in in-vitro systems of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. In fact, in-vivo biofilms of P. aeruginosa also do not seem to form the highly structured mushrooms, suggesting that they might be artificial and the result of the in-vitro growth conditions (37) .",

            "text": "The biofilm mode of growth implies that bacteria live and behave as integrated communities, rather than as independent entities. This notion also calls into question the role of certain species in the pathogenesis of chronic biofilm infections, such as periodontal diseases. In other words, it challenges the paradigm of the specific plaque hypothesis. The concomitant activity of many species that compose the subgingival biofilm would be required to induce disease in what was described by van Steenbergen et al. (381) as \u00d4pathogenic synergy\u00d5, a concept akin to the mixed-infection concept of the 1970s. Others have suggested the idea of a \u00d4pathogenic microbial com-munity\u00d5 (35) or \u00d4the community as pathogen\u00d5 (288) , in contrast to the traditional \u00d4single-pathogen model\u00d5. Despite the relevance of the biofilm as a whole to the periodontal disease process, it is also clear that neither all compositions of the subgingival microbiota result in tissue destruction, nor all elements of a pathogenic biofilm have the same significance to the disease process. For instance, supragingival and subgingival plaques are considered a continuum; however, at a certain point during biofilm maturation the subgingival habitat seems to become isolated from the supragingival environment. The independence between these two ecosystems is such that, at least in deep pockets, consistent removal of supragingival plaque has a minimal impact on the composition of the subgingival biofilm and, more importantly, on its capacity to sustain periodontal disease (364) . This observation suggests that, after a certain point in its development, the subgingival microbiota no longer depends on bacterial species from the supragingival biofilm for its survival and pathogenicity. Preliminary data comparing the transcriptomic profile from healthy-associated biofilms with that of disease-associated biofilms indicate that putative periodontal pathogens seem to be more \u00d4active\u00d5 in diseased than in healthy-associated microbial communities. In summary, the understanding of periodontal diseases as infections caused by a microbial community is not necessarily novel and was already incorporated in our appreciation of periodontal diseases as polymicrobial infections. Furthermore, the concept of a community as pathogen does not discard the possibility that certain components of that community have a more relevant role in the disease process.",

This feature of biofilms is so important to clinical microbiology that some have proposed its inclusion in the definition of the term biofilm, which was described as \u00d4A coherent cluster of bacterial cells imbedded in a matrix -which are more tolerant to most antimicrobials and the host defence, than planktonic bacterial cells\u00d5 (37) . Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this enhanced tolerance to antimicrobials, including: (i) restricted penetration of antimicrobials; (ii) differential physiological activity; (iii) persisters and phenotypic variants; (iv) entrapment and concentration of antibioticdegrading enzymes; and (v) overexpression of resistance genes. It is noteworthy that most of these mechanisms have been identified using in-vitro systems and that the extent to which they contribute to the protection of bacteria during biofilm infections has still to be determined. For instance, the hypothesis that the extracellular matrix of the biofilm acts as a diffusion barrier has been refuted, with the possible exception of the negatively charged aminoglycosides (74) .",

            "text": "It is also important to realize that biofilms are not more resistant to antibiotics, but rather more tolerant to them; once dispersed, the bacterial components of a biofilm become susceptible to antibiotics (33) . In fact, the protection granted by the biofilm mode of growth to the subgingival microbiota does not render them immune to the effects of systemic antibiotics, as demonstrated by the observation of beneficial clinical and microbiological effects after their use as sole therapy in periodontitis cases (221) . It has been recently postulated that the presence of a subset of persister cells within the biofilm community is the main mechanism that guarantees their survival after exposure to antibiotics. These cells are dormant cells with a low level of translation (319), which protect them from antibiotics that require cell replication to work. Persisters are considered as phenotypic variants rather than as mutants and have similar levels of tolerance to antibiotics compared with the wild-type strain. These rare, nongrowing cells pre-exist in the bacterial population and are not induced by antibiotic administration; however, they can survive exposure to these drugs and help reconstitute the biofilm after discontinuation of the antimicrobial regimen. If the presence of persisters is confirmed in subgingival biofilms, strategies to kill these dormant cells, such as the use of metabolic stimuli to potentiate antibiotics (e.g. mannitol, glucose, fructose and pyruvate) (12); newer beta-lactam agents (e.g. cephalosporins and carbapenems), aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones that can kill nongrowing bacteria (74) ; drugs that can target proteins that are essential for the maintenance of persisters (e.g. glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase) (200) ; and tryptophan \u2044 arginine-containing antimicrobial peptides (52), might become attractive adjuncts for the treatment of periodontal infections. Interestingly, persisters can be readily killed by antiseptics, but their use in most infections is precluded by the toxic systemic effects of these compounds. However, in the case of periodontal diseases, a simple strategy could be devised where the regimen of systemic antibiotics would be followed by the local application of antiseptics, such as povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine, to the base of the residual pockets.",

            "text": "Ecological concepts have been used in recent years to help explain how the interplay between bacteria and the host might result in destructive periodontal diseases. Marsh elegantly summarized this concept in the so-called \u00d4ecological plaque hypothesis\u00d5 (229, 230) . The tenets of this hypothesis were that changes in the environment increase the competitiveness of the putative pathogen at the expense of species associated with oral health and up-regulate the expression of virulence factors. The ecological plaque hypothesis also helps to frame the interplay between bacteria and the immuno-inflammatory host response in the etiopathogenesis of periodontal diseases. It is apparent that the maturation of the supragingival and subgingival biofilms leads to gingival inflammation, fostering additional changes in the microbial composition of the adjacent biofilm, in a positive-feedback loop termed \u00d4reciprocal interac-tion\u00d5 (336) . This intimate relationship between the periodontal microbiota and the host implies that in order to understand fully the sequence of events that result in periodontal tissue destruction, both processes will have to be examined at the same time. However, factors in the subgingival environment that can affect biofilm composition are not restricted to the nature of the immuno-inflammatory response. Environmental conditions such as temperature, osmotic pressure, the concentration of iron, magnesium or calcium, redox potential, pH and the availability of nutrients, among many others, can alter patterns of gene expression and possibly the pathogenic potential of certain bacterial strains (131, 231) .",

Cumulative mean counts (\u00b710 5 ) of 41 bacterial species in supragingival samples taken from 38 periodontally healthy subjects and from 17 subjects with periodontitis before professional removal of the dental biofilms (Pre), immediately after cleaning (time 0) and after 1, 2, 4 and 7 days of redevelopment (Post). The subjects refrained from oral-hygiene procedures for the 7-day test period. Samples were removed, precleaning and immediately postcleaning, from the mesio-buccal aspect of each tooth (excluding third molars). In addition, supragingival samples were obtained from up to seven teeth in randomly selected quadrants, 1, 2, 4 and 7 days after tooth cleaning. All samples were individually analyzed for their content of 41 taxa using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Species counts in the samples were averaged within each subject at each time point and were then averaged across subjects in the two clinical groups. The plots present the cumulative mean values at each time point in each clinical group. The species were ordered and color-coded according to previously described microbial complexes (337) .

(136) explored, using cluster analysis and community ordination techniques, microbial complexes present in mature biofilms, 1-to 7-dayold biofilms and long-term redevelopment biofilms (i.e. sampled 3-24 months after periodontal therapy). The results demonstrated that the community structure of the mature and long-term regrowth biofilms was quite similar (Figs 2 and 3) , whereas the recently formed biofilms were a mixture of communities observed in the more mature biofilms. The typical complexes that formed in long-standing biofilms could not be identified, indicating that 7 days was probably not a sufficient time for the establishment of a climax community with late colonizers. Complexes of mainly Streptococcus (yellow complex) and Actinomyces species, similar to those described for subgingival biofilms (337), could be identified. For the other complexes (i.e. green, purple, orange and red), there were a few noticeable differences from the composition of those described for the subgingival biofilms. Capnocytophaga ochracea appeared to be associated more with members of the orange complex than with members of the green complex, while V. parvula and N. mucosa appeared to comprise a new \u00d4purple\u00d5 complex in which N. mucosa replaced Actinomyces odontolyticus. However, in the long-term redevelopment analyses, N. mucosa and, to a lesser extent, V. parvula, appeared to join the green complex. The largest complex observed in the supragingival samples in terms of number of species was once more the orange complex; however, there were distinct subsets within this community. For instance, Campylobacter gracilis, Selenomonas noxia and C. ochracea formed a close subset within the orange complex, while P. intermedia, P. nigrescens and certain fusobacteria formed additional distinct subsets within this larger complex. C. rectus and Campylobacter showae were closely related, possibly because of their similar nutrient requirements. The subsets within the orange complex of supragingival biofilms seemed to be more closely associated compared with subsets observed in subgingival samples. Interestingly, the core red-complex species -P. gingivalis, T. forsythia and T. denticola -were joined by E. nodatum in supragingival plaque in both the mature and the long-term redevelopment biofilms. There was also a loose association of red-complex species with A. actinomycetemcomitans, Eubacterium saburreum, P. micra and P. melaninogenica in the long-term redevelopment biofilms.",

Sites with bleeding on probing or redness were strongly associated with members of the orange and red complexes, in accordance with findings for the subgingival biofilms. Interestingly, there was also a close association between the levels of orange-complex and red-complex species in supragingival plaque samples with pocket depth. This association was true, even when accounting for the presence of clinical signs of inflammation. It is possible that the higher levels of these species in deeper periodontal pockets and a higher flow of gingival crevicular fluid associated with them might impact the supragingival microbiota by providing a source of cells for recolonization and of nutrients for plaque regrowth. These results suggest that periodontal pocket reduction after therapy might reduce the rate of supragingival plaque accumulation, particularly of species of the orange and red complexes. The presence of gingival recessions also seemed to enhance the accumulation of supragingival biofilm and to favor certain species, such as E. corrodens and, to a lesser extent, C. ochracea and C. gingivalis. This was possibly because of an increased surface area for plaque retention or differential adherence of specific species to cementum and \u2044 or dentin.",

            "text": "In two subsequent manuscripts, Haffajee et al. (139, 140) examined the impact of plaque mass and tooth position on the composition of supragingival biofilms. The data indicated that the proportions of species of the green and orange complexes increased markedly in samples with a high plaque mass, while the proportions of members of Actinomyces and purple complexes decreased (Fig. 4) . Interestingly, the proportion of red-complex species in supragingival biofilms did not seem to be impacted by plaque biomass. Confirming their previous observations, the presence of gingival inflammation and deep pockets in the tissues adjacent to the sampled site correlated with an increased mass of biofilm. When the relationship between tooth position and biofilm mass and composition was investigated, it became apparent that the mean bacterial counts were higher at upper and lower molar sites, as well as at lower incisor \u2044 canine sites (Fig. 5 ). Plaque composition was influenced by tooth position, even after adjusting for total DNA probe counts, periodontal status, smoking, age and gender. For instance, multiple linear regression demonstrated a positive association between the proportions of C. gingivalis and Streptococcus sanguinis with lower incisor \u2044 canine teeth, while Actinomyces naeslundii 2 (currently A. oris) had a positive association with upper incisor \u2044 canine teeth and a negative correlation with lower molars. The composition of supragingival biofilms and their rate of redevelopment are also influenced by the nature of the surface being colonized and the access to gingival crevicular fluid as a source of nutrients. This was demonstrated in recent publications that have examined the composition and development patterns of biofilms that formed on denture teeth compared with natural teeth (299, 360) . Teles et al. (360) found that the rate of biofilm redevelopment on natural teeth was far more rapid than on denture teeth and reasoned that this observation could be partially explained by differences in the physical and chemical properties of hydroxyapatite compared with acrylic ( Fig. 6 ). However, previous in-vivo studies have shown that protein adsorption to surfaces and bacterial adherence are mostly determined by surface roughness rather than by other physicochemical properties of those surfaces (283, 284, 320, 366) . With increased roughness more plaque was accumulated and the complexity of the composition of these biofilms also seemed to increase, with higher proportions of rods, motile organisms and spirochetes (366) . Based on surface roughness, it was anticipated that the rate of biofilm regrowth would be faster on denture teeth than on natural teeth. Therefore, other factors unique to natural teeth might have contributed to the differences in plaque redevelopment. Another important difference between these two ecosystems is the presence of the gingival crevicular fluid that bathed the crevice of natural teeth but was absent on dentures, suggesting that this extra source of nutrients might have helped the faster biofilm growth observed on natural teeth. Furthermore, the proliferation of bacterial cells located in the subgingival habitat might also have contributed to a faster rate of plaque development and a more complex biofilm on natural teeth.",

These findings were in accordance with data from other studies that used culture techniques (348, 367) , checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (73) and cloning and sequencing (45) to examine the microbiota associated with dentures that also reported high levels of streptococci. Members of the green and orange complexes, such as E. corrodens, Capnocytophaga sputigena, C. gingivalis, C. ochracea, P. intermedia and F. nucleatum subspecies could be detected in samples from denture teeth but were predominant in dentate subjects.

The fast-accumulating species that have been associated with increases in plaque mass, such as E. corrodens and C. gracilis, and the bridging species of fusobacteria Species counts were averaged across subjects for each tooth separately.

At baseline, when \u00d4mature\u00d5 biofilms were present, periodontitis subjects had significantly higher mean bacterial counts per sample (40.9 \u00b1 7.1 \u00b7 10 5 ) than did periodontally healthy subjects (19.4 \u00b1 3.7 \u00b7 10 5 ). When the kinetics of biofilm accumulation was examined, it was noticed that there was a marked increase in biofilm species counts between 0 and 2 days; a plateau in counts between 2 and 4 days; and then a second sharp increase between 4 and 7 days (Fig. 7) . These phases in subgingival biofilm redevelopment might represent a change in the environment induced by the bacterial species that grew in the first wave. The first wave of growth, from 0 to 2 days, was associated with a sharp increase in the levels of members of the Actinomyces, purple and green complexes, while the second wave of growth, from 4 to 7 days, was characterized by a sharp increase in the levels of orange-complex species. Changes in the levels of oxygen, nutrient availability or pH might no longer be conducive to the early colonizers but may facilitate the growth of other species, suggesting a pattern of autogenic microbial species succession (336) .",

Sites were grouped into three categories: (i) sites that did not show bleeding on probing at any of the visits (n = 1,489); (ii) sites that had bleeding on probing at one or two visits (n = 1,593); and (iii) sites that had bleeding on probing at three or four visits (n = 309). The levels of 40 subgingival species measured using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization were averaged within subjects, across subjects and then across the different visits within each site category separately, in order to obtain a summary measure of cumulative exposure to these taxa over time.

The model built, based on data from the microbial analysis of 13,261 plaque samples, posited that colonization of the subgingival environment by orangecomplex species was required for the establishment of the so-called red-complex species. The authors suggested that this knowledge could be used in prevention strategies where orange-complex species would be targeted, resulting in the inhibition of the more pathogenic species of the red complex.

Changes in the composition of the subgingival microbiota are accompanied by changes in the habitat, particularly in the adjacent host tissues. The alteration of the local environment, in turn, leads to an altered ecosystem and additional changes in the composition of the subgingival microbiota with a reduction in the numbers of many other taxa.

The use of adjunct systemic metronidazole and amoxicillin might have an impact on the subgingival microbiota that goes beyond the red-complex species, and the levels and proportions of orange-complex species also seem to be affected (96, 232, 240, 321) . As these species are required for establishment of the late colonizers, it seems that the use of this combination sets the clock further back. In this new scenario, the subgingival microbiota seems to require a longer period of time to recompose itself. It is also conceivable that a stronger antimicrobial effect might allow for a better and faster healing of the periodontal tissues, as suggested by the fewer residual pockets obtained following the use of this therapy (54, 125, 399) , leading to a new environment that is less conducive for rebuilding the pathogenic subgingival biofilm.",

Further-more, several of the ecological drivers that resulted in the dysbiosis which led to a pathogenic subgingival microbiota in the first place, such as inflammation, deep pockets and increases in the mass of supragingival plaque, are also reversed, affording a new ecosystem where nonpathogenic host-microbe interactions are favored.",

However, the use of molecular techniques to examine the microbiota of different body sites has raised awareness of the high degree of intraspecies genetic diversity, leading some microbiologists to question the very existence of bacterial species (101) . It is apparent that bacteria are profoundly different from eukaryotes in how they exchange genetic material, clouding the concept of species (198) . Furthermore, the identification of intraspecies genomic variation and data suggesting that genes encoding virulence factors are only found in a subset of strains has also raised questions regarding the relevance of species-level identification (393) . Therefore, one might ask whether the specific plaque hypothesis is still tenable if the concept of bacterial species is in question. Traditionally, bacterial species have been defined based on morphology, gram staining and a series of phenotypic characteristics determined after a battery of biochemical tests. Indeed, the phenotype of the bacterial strain remains, to this day, the primary criterion for species classification. However, with the introduction of the use of molecular techniques to assist in microbial taxonomy, including sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA genes, molecular approaches to distinct bacterial species have also been used. For instance, bacterial species have been defined as isolates sharing at least 70% homology after DNA-DNA hybridization under standardized conditions. However, these methods have serious limitations and cannot be used to group similar strains into species; for instance, ribosomal RNA sequences are too conserved to resolve similar species (101) . Valid estimates of molecular diversity can be obtained based on variability in sequences of 16S ribosomal RNA, but that estimate does not equate with species diversity (291) . In recent years, 16S ribosomal RNA sequences have been favored for determining the closest relatives of an isolate, using phenotypic data to complement the characterization.",

Furthermore, horizontal gene transfer has been proposed as a mechanism that allows strains to obtain rapid access to genetic material carrying virulence factors and antibiotic resistance, impacting on the pathogenic potential of the recipient cells. How relevant in this context is, for instance, the study of P. gingivalis and its association with periodontal diseases? If the many virulence mechanisms that have been identified in this species can be freely shared among other species, how important is P. gingivalis to the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases? What would preclude any other bacterial species from acquiring these genes of virulence and becoming as pathogenic as P. gingivalis? We will explore this issue by first addressing the question of how freely genetic material can be shared through the microbiome of a given habitat. Studies that have examined the mechanisms which regulate horizontal gene transfer have indicated that the phylogeny of the cells involved in the transfer play an important role. For instance, the incorporation into the genome of genetic material acquired from close relatives is favored because these genes have greater compatibility with the molecular machinery required for their processing (331) . The spatial distribution of bacterial cells within the biofilm might also regulate horizontal gene transfer by restricting dispersal. Others posit that ecology, rather than geography or phylogeny, is more important in regulating horizontal gene transfer (331) . Irrespective of the nature of the forces that regulate horizontal gene transfer, mechanisms appear to exist through which phenotypic and genotypic similarity are maintained at higher levels among a large group of strains than would be expected at random (198) . Periodic selection has been suggested as a mechanism to \u00d4control\u00d5 genetic diversification, maintaining genotypic cohesion among bacterial strains (22) . According to this concept, a beneficial mutation would allow selection of the strains that acquired this trait, eliminating genetic variability from the population. In essence, natural selection would help to control the accumulation of neutral diversity that does not confer any additional benefit to the bacterial strains (i.e. with no direct effect on fitness). Ecotypes or ecospecies are an extension of this concept and refer to the selection of gene pools that confer fitness to certain strains to adapt to specific environmental conditions (57) .",

Once the DNA has been transferred to the recipient cell, restriction endonucleases will cleave almost all incoming DNA, while exonucleases will degrade the double-stranded DNA ends of the resulting fragments. These processes not only reduce the size of the incoming DNA, but frequently prevent the DNA fragment from integrating into the recipient chromosome. Alternatively, the incoming DNA fragment can be integrated into the chromosome through homologous recombination, replacing the corresponding resident allele. However, in order for homologous recombination to occur, a certain level of homology in nucleotide sequence between incoming and resident DNA is required. Once incorporated, the maintenance of the newly acquired genes is dependent on the mechanisms of natural selection for advantageous genes, as described above (198) .",

This low frequency of detection of the new gene will favor its rapid loss from the population, even if it confers a beneficial function (198) . Despite these mechanisms, horizontal gene transfer occurs between bacterial species; however, lateral gene transfers involving phylogenetically distant bacteria are infrequent in comparison with the rate of DNA recombination within species. Certain species of bacteria can differentiate into a state of competence for DNA transformation, in which cells acquire single-stranded DNA through a DNA-uptake complex that is specifically localized at a single cell pole (175) . In fact, a recent study demonstrated that natural competence mechanisms are present in multiple strains of P. gingivalis (370) . In summary, although horizontal gene transfer might result in common exchanges of DNA material within the microbiome of a given habitat, the incorporation of this genetic material into the genome of recipient cells is a much rarer event. In spite of these barriers to gene recombination, mutations will accumulate and eventually genetic isolation will result in the generation of a new species; however, gene divergence is a rather slow process and it occurs over tens of millions of years (57) .",

The ratio of shared (core) \u2044 unique (auxiliary) portions of the genome varied greatly among different species. The core genome hypothesis reconciles the existence of dynamic genomes conferred by horizontal gene transfer with the existence of clusters of isolates that exhibit similar phenotypic traits, used by microbiologists over decades to group then into \u00d4bacterial species\u00d5.

            "text": "Lesson learned: subgingival bacterial species present high genetic diversity During the search for the etiological agents of periodontal infections, it became apparent that, despite colonization of the oral cavity by a large number of bacterial species, only a handful of species were consistently associated with periodontitis, particularly P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans (1, 131, 246) . The phenotypic traits of those organisms became the focus of the scientific community and their virulence mechanisms began to be characterized (114, 215) . The infectious nature of the disease led to an interest in determining the epidemiology of periodontal pathogens, including their acquisition, intra-oral distribution and route of transmission (113, 280, 408) . Such information would provide a better understanding of the role of bacteria in the initiation and progression of periodontal diseases. Thus, during the 1990s a number of studies used restriction endonuclease analysis (113, 218) , restriction fragment length polymorphism (216) , multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (217) and arbitrarily primed PCR (239) to measure the relatedness of bacterial strains isolated from different individuals. Both related (such as spouses and siblings, as well as parents and offspring) and unrelated individuals were studied in the search for clonal variability of certain bacterial species (239, 280, 372, 377, 408) . In most studies, the focus was the clonal variability of periodontal pathogens such as P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans, but other relevant periodontal taxa, such as E. corrodens, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens and F. nucleatum, were also investigated (50, 86, 233) . We will center on the studies of P. gingivalis to illustrate the implications of genomic variability of subgingival species in the study of periodontal disease etiology.",

            "text": "The study of clinical isolates of P. gingivalis demonstrated that this was a highly diverse species. Very different genetic and enzymatic patterns were observed among the isolates analyzed and no predominant dominant clone was observed across samples from unrelated individuals. Instead, rather unique individual patterns were identified (11, 218, 239, 265) . In addition, it was observed that the same clonal types were often found in closely related individuals, such as parents and offspring, siblings and spouses, suggesting horizontal and vertical transmission (280, 372, 377, 380) . It was shown that typically only one or two clones would colonize any given individual (11, 20, 219) . Even though the source of the clonal types and transmission could be determined with those studies, the relevance of the differences across strains remains to be elucidated. The observation that the detection of P. gingivalis was not a determinant for the occurrence of periodontitis suggested that the genetic and \u2044 or phenotypic differences observed across the isolates could perhaps explain why some P. gingivalis carriers would develop periodontitis and others would not. Most of the studies that associated clonal variability with disease status have suggested that individual clones or genetic types may express different phenotypic characteristics. The hypothesis was that clusters of clones \u2044 strains would express specific phenotypic characteristics which would confer virulence (113) .",

Most studies have failed to demonstrate a relationship between specific clusters of clones of P. gingivalis and the periodontal status of the host (217, 239) . In addition, there is evidence that similar clonal types are observed in periodontal health and disease (356) . It is possible that this discrepancy is a result of the use of different methodological approaches and varying sample sizes. Because of the observed heterogeneity in strains and lack of a predominant clonal type associated with disease, it has been proposed that all clonal types of P. gingivalis would be equally effective in colonizing the human host and that they share a common virulence potential (11) . This argument led some authors to suggest that P. gingivalis is a commensal organism that can become an opportunistic pathogen (217, 239) . However, the lack of distinct pathogenic clones within bacterial species does not define commensalism (20) . In light of its widely demonstrated virulence properties and disease association, it appears unlikely that P. gingivalis is a commensal species (162, 194, 195, 396) .",

P. gingivalis has several virulence factors, such as a capsule, proteases and fimbriae. Because fimbriae are a major virulence factor of P. gingivalis, the study of the variability of fimbrial genes in P. gingivalis in periodontal health and disease seemed to be the next logical step. P. gingivalis has minor and major fimbriae, which have been classified into six types (251) . In clinical studies, the fimA II and fimA IV genes were associated with severe periodontitis, and strains having these genes demonstrated greater adhesive and invasive capabilities (92, 186, 371) . Other traits were also evaluated in association with disease, such as capsular antigens (193) and gingipains (34) ; however, the results of these studies were inconclusive.",

            "text": "It can be argued that some of the studies cited earlier in this article, which aimed to identify the pathogenic clones of P. gingivalis, employed techniques with variable discriminatory powers and reproducibilities. Techniques that utilize sequencing have become increasingly accessible and allow the molecular typing of unrelated isolates by characterizing genetic variations in the chromosomal DNA of bacterial species. Therefore, they are more precise and reproducible than are pattern-based or \u00d4finger-printing\u00d5 technologies, which simply determine distinct patterns of enzyme or DNA fragments. Molecular typing techniques, such as multilocus sequence typing, have been employed recently to study the population structure and genetic variability of P. gingivalis. Multilocus sequence typing is a nucleotide sequence-based approach for the genetic characterization of bacterial isolates, based on the genetic variations found in a predetermined group of genes, typically five to eight housekeeping genes, such as pepO, recA, dnaK, nah and pga (177). Using multilocus sequence typing, Enersen et al. (93) showed that patients with periodontitis could harbor up to four clonal types of P. gingivalis and that patients with refractory periodontitis could be colonized by up to eight clonal types. This is a clear departure from the previous findings of one to two clones per patient (219) . In addition, only closely related clones were observed in the same pocket, suggesting that DNA recombination may have occurred at that site. Thus, while there is considerable heterogeneity among P. gingivalis isolates, intraindividual heterogeneity is low. Such genetic plasticity seems to be indicative of efficient mechanisms to adapt to a multitude of habitats and shifts in the environment, ensuring the survival of a portion of the population. However, the question of whether different groups of clones, and different sets of phenotypic traits expressed by them, could be linked to periodontal disease initiation and progression remained unanswered. Because P. gingivalis colonization starts early in life (64, 270) , and disease manifestation tends to occur decades later (8) , it could be argued that a change into more pathogenic clonal types could lead to the development of periodontal diseases over time. This hypothesis could explain the events of disease initiation and its bursts of activity, as previously noted. In that context, the next logical question would be whether clonal stability exists in P. gingivalis colonization over time, or if new (and more pathogenic) clones would arise and coincide with the onset of periodontitis.",

Using amplified fragment length polymorphism, the authors examined the clonal types of P. gingivalis in a population (including families) with untreated periodontitis over an 8-year period. The authors observed considerable volatility in the acquisition and the loss of P. gingivalis genotypes. Even though P. gingivalis was detected in 105 individuals in 1994 and in 103 subjects in 2002, only 66 (46%) of those subjects were positive for P. gingivalis in both examinations. However, the percentage of individuals presenting with one, two or three genotypes (about 70%, 20% and 5%, respectively) remained stable over time. Forty-six (69.7%) participants had at least one identical genotype in the second examination. The findings from a later study using multilocus sequence typing (374) indicated that the clonal stability of P. gingivalis is a robust event, in that even in the presence of periodontal treatment, consisting of scaling and root planing in combination with systemic antibiotics (amoxicillin and metronidazole), the clonal types observed post-therapy were the same ones detected before intervention. These results suggest at least four possibilities: (i) the incomplete eradication of P. gingivalis by treatment allowed cells to remain in the periodontal pocket and in neighboring tissues, and these cells recolonized the site after treatment; (ii) the same strain could be re-acquired by familial transmission; (iii) positive selection of clones better fit to sustain the mechanical and antimicrobial challenges imposed by periodontal treatment; and (iv) combinations of all three mechanisms or any combination of two such mechanisms. Unfortunately, in the study by Winkelhoff et al. (384) , the association between the stably colonizing clones and disease progression was not examined. In addition, the relationship between the presence of the post-therapy isolates found by Valenza et al. (374) and the response to periodontal treatment was also not tested. Therefore, inferences regarding their association with the progression of periodontitis and periodontal therapy outcomes could not be made.",

The genetic diversity observed in P. gingivalis seems to reflect the variability of its habitat (370) , represented by different hosts and different sites, possibly representing different ecotypes (331) . This is supported by the evidence that unrelated hosts harbor different clonal types and that closely related hosts (such as siblings, parents and spouses) appear to share similar clones (384) . It is also supported by the findings from Enersen et al. (92) , who demonstrated that only closely related clonal types were observed in individual pockets (one to eight clones per pocket). In general, the variation within a site was limited to two genes, pepO and recA, which are involved in DNA transformation, replication, recombination and repair, suggesting DNA recombination at the periodontal site. Despite advances in understanding the population structure and colonization dynamics of P. gingivalis, the relevance of the genetic differences observed across strains remains to be determined. Most of the interest in the genetic characterization of pathogens resides in their virulence mechanisms so that better diagnosis and treatments can be devised. Thus, from a therapeutic standpoint, the presence of similar virulence mechanisms in all strains of a species seems advantageous. The description of a core set of genes present in a species is a first and crucial step in that direction. Because of such high degree of genetic variation and the lack of association of genotypes with disease status, the characterization of the core genome of P. gingivalis seems especially attractive.",

Comparative genomic hybridization is a microarray-based technology that allows the comparison of several variants of one genome (such as among different bacterial strains) against a reference genome (such as a well-characterized and sequenced strain). Brunner et al. (44) used comparative genomic hybridization to analyze capsular and noncapsular P. gingivalis serotypes with different levels of virulence against the well-studied and highly virulent W83 strain of P. gingivalis. The authors observed that a conserved core genome from P. gingivalis consisted of 80% of the genes analyzed from the W83 strain and that most of the virulence-related genes observed in that strain could be found in the core genome. The authors argued that the genes which are not present in the core may be determinants of the differences in virulence found between the strains. These results should be seen as a first step, as the size of the core genome is a function of the number of strains analyzed (i.e. the greater the number of strains, the smaller the core is expected to be because of the increase in genetic variability). For instance, the core genome of E. coli has been found to be 46% of the average core genome, as based on the whole-genome multialignment of 20 E. coli strains (369) .",

Those studies encompassed an enormous amount of work, as they entailed the culture and characterization of thousands of isolates from samples collected from hundreds of patients. Because culture-based techniques are slow and laborious, only a few samples could be collected from each individual. Yet, studies from distinct research groups yielded remarkably concordant results and these provided the basis of our current understanding of the etiopathogenesis of periodontal diseases (87, 131, 246) . Overall, it was demonstrated that approximately 500 taxa are capable of colonizing the human oral cavity, of which 359 were frequently detected and 141 were observed only once (77, 246) . Any individual may typically harbor 150-200 different species, and it was estimated that between 10 and 30 species can initiate destructive periodontal diseases (335) . A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, E. nodatum, F. nucleatum, P. intermedia and P. nigrescens appeared to be associated with periodontal diseases as the percentage of total isolates increased with increased disease severity, and Actinomyces naeslundii, C. gingivalis, N. mucosa, S. oralis, Streptococcus salivarius, S. sanguinis and V. parvula appeared to be associated with periodontal health or stability, as the percentage of total isolates decreased with increased disease severity (246) .",

In addition, there was an urge to develop faster, less costly techniques that could bypass the time-intensive culture of samples. The checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique (339, 341) came to fulfill such a need and allowed the enumeration of a multitude of taxa in many samples simultaneously. This technique enabled a quantum leap in our knowledge of oral microbiology and ecology, as well as in the diagnosis, pathogenesis and treatment of periodontal diseases (85, 225, 359, 360, 365, 373, 404, 412) . (143) . The ability to bypass culture of clinical samples and to collect biofilm samples from large numbers of sites in each patient came with the \u00d4compromise\u00d5 that only a subset of the taxa known to colonize the oral cavity was included in the probe panel routinely utilized. In addition, only cultured species could be included because of the requirement to grow bacteria for DNA extraction and probe preparation. The selection of the checkerboard probe panel was performed based on the culture studies cited above, where the relevance of bacterial species to periodontal health and disease was determined.",

            "text": "Two major criticisms often surrounded the checkerboard technique. The first criticism relates to the extent and the composition of the panel of probes; at times it was felt that 40 probes was too low a number in relation to the number of species (more than 300) that can colonize the periodontal pocket. Interestingly, criticism in the other direction also occurred, as 40 taxa have been suggested to be \u00d4too many\u00d5 and that the panel should be narrowed further to account for the truly relevant species. The second criticism focused on the use of whole-genomic DNA probes, in part because their use may increase the probability of cross-reactions between species as a result of common regions of DNA among closely related species. There were also concerns that they would not detect all strains of a given species and that they would have a low sensitivity in terms of the numbers of cells that they detected. Those critiques were addressed in detail in a publication in which the status of the checkerboard technique was evaluated after 10 years of routine use in clinical studies and the analysis of tens of thousands of biofilm samples (339) . The authors searched for cross-reactions by hybridizing probes for the 40 typical species analyzed using checkerboard with targets from 80 bacterial species. Probes for certain species, such as T. forsythia, showed virtually no measurable cross-reactions to any of the test taxa. The probe for F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii exhibited weak cross-reactions with F. nucleatum ssp. nucleatum and F. nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, as well as a weak cross-reaction with C. rectus. The probe for S. intermedius exhibited virtually no cross-reactions except for the expected reactions with the two other members of the \u00d4streptococcus milleri group\u00d5 -Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus constellatus. The authors also demonstrated that the cross-reactions observed could be eliminated with the use of subtraction hybridization and PCR probes, as well as with competitive hybridization, if one was particularly interested in those species.",

However, if one so chooses, species that are difficult to grow could easily be incorporated into the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. Still, the culture studies that provided the basis for the selection of the checkerboard probe panel might have been unable to detect those difficult-to-culture species and most certainly did not detect unculturable ones. It was known that many organisms, recognized by their appearance in plaque samples viewed by light or electron microscopy, were not being cultured (340) . In fact, additional unculturable species might not even be distinctive under the microscope, making it virtually impossible to estimate the extent of the unculturable segment of the microbiota and whether it harbors pathogenic species. The discrepancy between microscopic and plate counts had been known for many years in oral microbiology (242, 333) , as well as in environmental microbiology (286) , and the phenomenon was later described as the \u00d4great plate count anomaly\u00d5 (343) .",

(14) is often cited to support the contention that culture approaches detect only a small fraction of the microbial contentapproximately 1% of its diversity -and that molecular approaches provide a more comprehensive view. Although this number has been disputed in the field of environmental microbiology (80) , it seems that environmental microbiologists face a much greater challenge than do oral microbiologists. It is a testimony to the quality of the work of the pioneers in periodontal microbiology that over 50% of morphotypes present in plaque samples can be grown in the laboratory. This figure has often been preceded in several texts by the word \u00d4only\u00d5. We have a more optimistic view and see the 50% of culturable species as a perfect example of a \u00d4glass half-full\u00d5, particularly considering the numbers suggested by Amman and co-workers for other types of samples. Owing to the continuous efforts of a small number of dedicated scientists to culture difficult-to-grow oral bacterial species (83, 387, 388, 390) , this estimated percentage of yet-uncultured species has been recently reduced to 35% (75) . In fact, Griffen et al. (124) recently used pyrosequencing to compare subgingival biofilm samples from periodontally healthy patients with those from periodontitis patients and reported that although sequences from uncultured taxa were more abundant in samples from diseased sites, overall, 81% of the sequences identified were mapped to cultured species.",

This approach has the advantage of not focusing on a predetermined set of bacterial species, as is the case for checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (337), PCR (19) , real time-PCR (302) or in-situ hybridization (7) . Rather, the amplification of conserved areas of a ubiquitous bacterial gene (the 16S ribosomal RNA gene) by a highly sensitive method (PCR) (122) would allow the identification of all microbial taxa present in a given sample. Ultimately, there was an expectation that new species would be identified in the uncultured segment and that these would be associated with periodontal health and disease and would bring much-needed answers to many of the questions on the microbiology of periodontal diseases. A few groups began using cloning and sequencing to explore the microbial diversity in the oral cavity of patients with periodontitis (184, 303) , but the first comprehensive description of the subgingival microbiota based on this approach was delineated by Paster et al. (276) . The authors analyzed subgingival plaque samples from 31 individuals, including periodontally healthy subjects as well as patients with chronic and refractory periodontitis, acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis and HIV-associated periodontitis. The authors estimated that 500 taxa could colonize the oral cavity and found that 347 species \u2044 phylotypes could be found in the subgingival environment. Of those, 215 were novel phylotypes (i.e. uncultured or culturable but unnamed taxa) and 140 were detected only once. Interestingly, these numbers are strikingly similar to those obtained by Moore & Moore (246) using culture.",

In the interest of clarity, in this manuscript, whenever possible, their current names will be indicated in parentheses and will follow the taxonomic anchors described in the human oral microbial database (Chen et al.

HOT 103) and Megasphera clone BB166 (HOT 121, later named Anaeroglobus geminatus). Cultured pathogenic periodontal species were also detected and associated with periodontitis, but much less frequently than were other species and phylotypes. For instance, P. gingivalis and T. forsythia were detected in no more than five patients with chronic or refractory periodontitis (eight and 11 clones, respectively), while P. endodontalis, Prevotella tannerae, E. saphenum, F. alocis and D. pneumosintes were present in four to eight patients with periodontal disease (seven to 20 clones) and novel phylotypes such as TM7 clone I025 (HOT 356), Synergystetes clone BH017 (HOT 369) and Eubacterium clone PUS9.171 (Peptostreptococcacea HOT 103) were detected in four or five patients with periodontal disease (six to 43 clones).",

            "text": "In their benchmark study, Paster et al. (276) unveiled the diversity of the subgingival microbiota in much greater breadth than ever before. Furthermore, the authors started to make associations between certain novel taxa, as well as between less-studied named bacterial species, and periodontal health and disease. That study paved the way for other studies on the microbial diversity in the oral cavity and the potential role of the uncultured segment of the subgingival microbiota in the development of periodontal diseases. Kumar et al. (188) expanded the associations initially proposed by Paster et al. (276) and searched for selected uncultured \u2044 unnamed phylotypes as well as characterized species not previously thought to be associated with periodontitis. Two taxa were associated with periodontal health, namely Deferribacteres clone W090 (Synergistetes sp. HOT 363, which, until recently, was described as an unnamed cultured taxon, but has been characterized and named Fretibacterium fastidiosum) (387) and Bacteroidetes clone BU063 (Tannerella sp. HOT 286, an uncultured taxon), which had been previously associated with health (202) . Five uncultured \u2044 unnamed phylotypes were associated with periodontal diseases, including Deferribacteres clones D084 \u2044 BH017 (Synergistetes sp. HOT 360 \u2044 362) and Bacteroidetes clone AU126 (HOT 274), confirming some of the findings previously reported by Paster et al. (276) .",

These findings contradict the lessons learned from studies using culture (87), checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (336, 339) , real time-PCR (4, 55, 260) and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (413) . It seemed that decades of microbiological studies were proven incorrect or dismissed. It is quite tempting to accept novel pathogenic taxa and dispose of the old ones, as novelty tends to be rather appealing. Besides, this is the nature of science; new concepts tend to replace old dogmas as new knowledge is obtained. However, because of the overwhelming body of work that has implicated P. gingivalis, T. forsythia and other subgingival species as putative periodontal pathogens, one should exert caution in overinterpreting the early findings obtained using emerging technologies.",

            "text": "The apparent discrepancies between data obtained from cloning and sequencing and data obtained using other microbiological techniques can be attributed to several technical issues associated with sample collection and processing. The inclusion of samples from different diseased entities might have clouded differences between periodontal health and disease. For instance, in the study of Paster et al. (276) , samples from a rather heterogeneous group of disease entities were included and it is likely that each of those conditions present distinct microbiotas. Owing to the low throughput afforded by the technique, relatively small numbers of patients and samples from each subject were included (189, 190, 276) . This can be a problem because considerable variability has been observed in the composition of host-associated microbiotas (65, 274) , including subgingival biofilms (158) . Furthermore, typically 168 sites are clinically monitored in periodontal studies (28 teeth \u00b7 six sites per tooth); therefore, four subgingival samples represent <3% of all sites being monitored. In addition, when few samples are collected from the same individual, the larger one(s) tend to be over-represented; this is particularly critical when samples are pooled (335) . A lesson learned by Socransky during his early days as a microbiologist and passed on to his many students was \u00d4thou shalt not pool\u00d5, in reference to the many problems that arrive from attempting to interpret data obtained from pooled plaque samples. It is noteworthy that close-ended approaches using real time-PCR have been able to routinely detect classical periodontal pathogens, even when few samples were collected or pooled (41, 55) , suggesting that other procedures associated with cloning and sequencing could be the source of the infrequent detection of periodontal pathogens.",

In addition to the infrequent observation of recognized pathogenic bacterial species, members of the genera Fusobacterium and Actinomyces also appeared to be under-represented in studies using cloning and sequencing (184, 189, 248, 249) , which also contrasted with reports based on culture (246) , checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (337) and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (411) . One of the possible reasons for these findings was the assumption that the use of universal primers would amplify DNA from all bacterial species present in a sample with the same efficiency; this was later proven not to be the case. Hutter et al. (159) employed two sets of universal primers and reported that they could observe P. gingivalis in 12 of the 26 periodontitis patients examined. This was achieved even though only one sample was collected from each patient and many fewer clones per patient were sequenced (22 compared with 50 to 100 routinely analyzed). Later, de Lillo et al. (72) demonstrated that \u00d4universal\u00d5 PCR primers can introduce bias into analysis of the species composition of clone libraries because of mismatches between the sequence of the primer and the sequence of the target organism. Since then, the use of different sets of universal primers has been proposed, as well as the use of enrichment primers for specific phyla, such as spirochetes (75, 159, 276) .",

Collectively, it was demonstrated that several aspects of the PCR amplification of multitemplate samples, including template concentration, number of amplification cycles, annealing temperature and chimera formation, could alter the microbial profiles of the sample under study. Furthermore, the nature of the cell wall of the species present in the sample will affect cell lysis and DNA-extraction protocols, and genomes with a higher guanine+cytosine content appear to be less successfully amplified (13, 78, 281, 392) . In the case of cloning studies, the number of clones analyzed might also influence the resulting microbial diversity and profiles. In addition, the use of an aliquot of the DNA extracted from samples might introduce other types of bias analogous to those introduced by the dispersion and dilution necessary for culture studies (340) and this aliquot might not fully represent the whole sample (49) . The importance of validation studies testing different sources of bias at different stages of sample processing, such as collection (358) and amplification (89, 357) , cannot be emphasized strongly enough. Furthermore, the effects of primer selection (72, 187) and of the levels and types of taxa should also be assessed using mock communities of known species (78, 157, 361) . A recent paper published by Diaz et al. (78) elegantly illustrates the relevance of validation studies. The authors examined the limitations associated with high-throughput sequencing or nextgeneration sequencing and the intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. Next-generation sequencing is an open-ended, culture-independent approach that has replaced cloning and sequencing in the study of complex ecosystems and was only recently introduced for the study of the oral microbiota (172, 410) . The analysis of mock communities composed of seven oral bacterial species showed primer and DNAisolation biases and an overestimation of diversity. The data from the clinical and mock samples allowed the authors to devise an experimental and analytical framework that should facilitate the design and interpretation of future high-throughput sequencing studies (78) . The long list of biases given above should not discourage the reader from considering the findings obtained on the composition of the periodontal microbiota using open-ended molecular techniques. Instead, it should be a reminder that all techniques have limitations; it is up to the scientist to identify them, to acknowledge them, to attempt to overcome them and, most importantly, to interpret carefully the results generated from using them. This is particularly important when using new techniques or exploring new environments.",

The first study to investigate the oral microbiota via next-generation sequencing estimated that 19,000 phylotypes may be present in the human oral microbiota (172), a major increase from the earlier estimates of 700 taxa (278) . Meanwhile, as the technology became more routinely used, a number of potential sources of bias were identified. For instance, Kunin et al. (192) showed that the use of low-stringency filters for sequencing reads can overestimate diversity and lead to inflated numbers of taxa in a given environment. In addition, Wu et al. (400) demonstrated that the PCR conditions, such as the choice of polymerase, dilution of the template and the number of PCR cycles used, can have significant effects on the analysis of microbial diversity and community structure. Because these technologies provide tremendous coverage depth, it is important to determine the extent of the biases introduced on the profile of any given community. Once those sources are recognized, strategies to overcome them can be devised (157, 166, 187, 191) .",

            "text": "When using next-generation sequencing, the selection of the targets for amplification is critical for the true representation of the microbiota under study. In a recent study, Kumar et al. (187) used four sets of primers, targeting different regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (namely regions V1-V3, V4-V6 and V7-V9), to amplify subgingival biofilm samples from 10 patients with periodontitis. The authors observed significant differences across the microbial communities generated by different target regions. Finally, the authors concluded that primers targeting both regions V1-V3 and V7-V9 should be used in deep-sequencing efforts to characterize heterogeneous communities. In a subsequent paper from the same group (124) , the authors used pyrosequencing to compare the subgingival microbiota in periodontal health and disease. After using stringent methods to select target regions for amplification and for data analysis, the authors observed clear differences in the microbial profiles of the two conditions, primarily in the levels of P. gingivalis, T. denticola and F. alocis, which were the most prominent species in diseased sites and in the levels of S. mitis and S. sanguinis, which were the dominant taxa in periodontal health. Interestingly, these finding are in accord with previous investigations using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (336, 337, 339) and culture (246) . In addition, the authors detected a total of 692 species, and the number of species per individual ranged from 100 to 300, which represent numbers much closer to those proposed by Paster et al. (278) .",

Early studies using microscopy identified high levels and proportions of spirochetes in deep pockets, always at the forefront of the periodontal lesion, close to inflamed tissues (104, 208, 253, 300, 301) . In fact, studies in the 1980s attempted to monitor the presence of these taxa in samples of subgingival plaque using phase-contrast and dark-field microscopy and to relate their levels to the severity of periodontal disease and to the outcome of periodontal therapy (17, 174, 285) . Cross-reacting monoclonal antibodies against Treponema pallidum have also been used to identify uncultured \u00d4pathogen-related spirochetes\u00d5 in subgingival plaque samples (293) (294) (295) .",

            "text": "In recent years, as studies using culture-independent molecular techniques accumulated, a number of additional uncultured taxa began to be associated with periodontal health and disease (42, 95, 159, 264, 389, 413) . The relative abundance of members of the phylum TM7 was found to be greater in patients with periodontitis, suggesting their potential role in the pathogenesis of the disease (42, 264) . Members of the phylum Synergistetes were more frequently detected in periodontitis patients and were more abundant in diseased sites than in healthy sites (389) . Tannerella sp. BU063 (HOT 286) was found to be more prevalent in healthy sites (188, 202) and in gingivitis sites (413) compared with periodontitis sites. Using fluorescence in-situ hybridization, Zuger et al. (413) reported that this taxon was found in gingivitis sites and corresponded to <1% of the total bacteria. T. forsythia was also present in most of the gingivitis sites in low proportions (<1% of the total bacteria); however, it was detected in all periodontitis sites and comprised >10% of the total bacteria. These findings illustrate two important points: (i) phylogeny may not always be used to infer pathogenicity; and (ii) quantification is important to determine the relevance of oral microorganisms and their association with health and disease. Griffens et al. (124) used pyrosequencing to compare the subgingival microbiota of periodontitis patients with that of periodontally healthy individuals. The authors observed that several uncultured taxa were significantly more abundant in deep sites from periodontitis patients, in comparison with shallow sites from the same patients and with shallow sites from periodontally healthy individuals. They included Treponema sp. oral taxon 230 (HOT 230), Desulfobulbus R004 (HOT 041), TM7 oral taxa 437 and 349 (HOT 437 and HOT 349), and Synergistetes oral taxon G36 (not in the human oral microbiome database). Many were present at levels comparable with those observed for bacteria previously associated with periodontitis, such as T. forsythia, P. intermedia and C. rectus.",

            "text": "Those associations observed in cloning and sequencing studies are encouraging and indicate that some novel taxa identified might merit further pursuit in additional studies. However, there are a number of challenges in moving forward. The large diversity in subgingival biofilms, the differences in the clinical and laboratory protocols employed by different studies, the fact that nonviable cells can be detected because most of those techniques rely on DNA as the target molecule, an ever changing nomenclature for novel phylotypes, as well as time and costs associated with the techniques being used, were some of the obstacles facing researchers in defining the role of those organisms in periodontal health and disease. Several types of additional studies are needed in order for the role of these novel taxa to be elucidated, including, for instance, intervention studies to test whether the prevalence of those new \u00d4putative pathogens\u00d5 would decrease in successfully treated patients and sites and remain elevated in nonresponding patients and sites. Longitudinal studies are also necessary to confirm the consistent presence of these taxa in the subgingival habitat to confirm that they are \u00d4resident\u00d5 members of the microbiota, rather than transients. In addition, temporality, a criterion that is often included for the inference of causality, cannot be established based on cross-sectional studies. As discussed elsewhere in this manuscript, longitudinal studies are also essential to examine the associations between subgingival taxa and periodontal disease progression or \u00d4risk-assessment analysis\u00d5. Furthermore, if we are to make inferences about the role of these \u00d4new taxa\u00d5 in periodontal health and disease, quantification techniques are a must. In the past decade, three technological advances have permitted the implementation of intervention and longitudinal human studies examining the yetuncultured \u2044 unnamed segment of the subgingival microbiota and its quantification in subgingival samples: (i) the human oral microbial identification microarray; (ii) the RNA-oligonucleotide quantification technique; and (iii) the human oral microbiome database.",

            "text": "In a recent study, the human oral microbial identification microarray was used to compare the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis with those of subjects with successfully treated periodontitis and periodontal health (59) . A few uncultured taxa were significantly more prevalent in refractory patients, including TM7 sp. HOT 346, which was detected in >10% of all samples. Additional uncultured taxa were more prevalent in refractory cases, but were much less common and were detected in <10% of all samples, namely TM7 sp. HOT HOT 131) , were also more prevalent in poor responders, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. The previous association of Tannerella clone BU063 (HOT 286) with healthy sites (188, 202) could not be confirmed. Several taxa listed in that publication by their genus followed by a HOT number are not uncultured and are currently known as \u00d4unnamed cultured\u00d5, as described in a subsequent section on the human oral microbiome database. Some taxa were significantly associated with disease, including Bacteroidetes spp. HOT Recognized pathogenic periodontal species, such as P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, T. denticola and E. nodatum, were more prevalent in refractory patients and in sites that had lost attachment than in good-responder subjects \u2044 sites and in periodontally healthy individuals \u2044 sites. In a follow-up study from the same group (58), the authors used the human oral microbial identification microarray to compare the changes on the subgingival microbiota of the two clinical groups of periodontitis patients described earlier in this paragraph (i.e. refractory patients and good responders) before and after periodontal therapy. A recently completed intervention study conducted in our department provided further evidence of the relevance of certain uncultured taxa as well as other unnamed cultured taxa in periodontal health and disease. In this study, subgingival biofilm samples were taken from 42 subjects with chronic periodontitis (an average of 10 sites per patient) and from 41 healthy subjects (an average of 13 sites per patient). Samples from periodontally healthy individuals were collected at baseline, while samples from subjects with chronic periodontitis were collected at baseline and 3 months after periodontal therapy, which comprised full-mouth scaling and root planing in two sessions and systemic amoxicillin (500 mg, three times daily) and metronidazole (250 mg, three times daily) for 2 weeks. Figures 10-12 present preliminary data from this clinical study. Figure 10 shows the mean prevalence of bacterial taxa detected at significantly different frequencies (P < 0.05) at sites grouped according to their baseline pocket depth. It can be observed that Desulfobulbus sp. HOT 041, Peptostreptococcacea spp. HOT 103 and HOT 369 and Treponema spp. HOT 237 and HOT 242 were detected at greater frequencies in deep sites, and that Acidaminococcaceae (Veillonellacea) sp. HOT 150 was more prevalent in healthy sites. The effects of therapy on the microbiota implicated a number of other taxa as candidate pathogens. Figure 11 shows the mean prevalence of bacterial taxa detected at significantly different frequencies before and after therapy (P < 0.05). Data were averaged within each subject and then across subjects at each time point separately. Among the uncultured phylotypes, it can be observed that the detection of Synegistetes sp. HOT 360, Desulfobulbus sp. HOT 041, Peptostreptococcacea sp. HOT 113, Treponema spp. HOT 237 and HOT 242, Lachnospiracea sp. HOT 080 and a cluster of Treponema phylotypes were significantly reduced after therapy. These taxa had baseline and post-therapy reduction values similar in magnitude to those from known pathogenic species such as E. nodatum, T. forsythia, P. gingivalis and P. intermedia. One can also appreciate that there is a tendency for a shift to a healthier microbial profile, as a number of health-compatible taxa increase in prevalence, including S. oralis, S. sanguinis and S. parasanguinis. Figure 12 shows the frequency of detection of taxa found in shallow and deep sites post-therapy (P < 0.05). Selenomonas spp. HOT 134 and HOT 442, Acidaminococcacea sp. (Veillonellaceae sp.) HOT 135 and Synergistetes spp. HOT 363, HOT 453 and HOT 452 were more prevalent in deep residual sites. Other taxa that were also found at a higher prevalence in that category of sites included P. gingivalis and E. nodatum.",

Several of the uncultured \u2044 unnamed taxa identified as being associated with periodontal diseases belonged to genera that already had representatives of \u00d4cultured putative periodontal pathogens\u00d5, including Prevotella, Treponema and Fusobacterium. The data also provided additional evidence of a potential role of phylotypes from the genera Bacteroidetes, Synergistetes, Megasphaera, Selenomonas, Desulfobulbus, Peptostreptococcacea and Acidaminococcacea, and from the phylum TM7, that had been previously associated with periodontal diseases based on the results of cross-sectional studies using molecular techniques. In addition, a potential role in health and disease could be suggested for cultured taxa not typically sought in studies of the subgingival microbiota, such as D. pneumosintes, F. alocis, P. tannerae, P. denticola and Fusobacterium naviforme. Interestingly, many such species had been previously implicated in periodontal disease in predominant culture studies (131, 246) . In addition, DNA probes targeting these culturable species have been recently incorporated into the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique (69) .",

Also, the majority of those techniques involve sample dilution, sample pooling or PCR amplification (159, 188, 276) , all of which add bias to the microbial results. Until now, there has been no high-throughput technique to quantify those taxa; techniques such as real time-PCR (42, 390) and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (388, 389, 413) , which allow the quantification of unculturable species, are limited in the number of taxa and samples that that can evaluated at the same time. Quantification is important in the study of microbial communities in any ecosystem (13) , but it is particularly crucial in periodontal diseases because differences between periodontal health and disease, and before and after therapy, are quantitative, rather than qualitative (55, 128, 141, 142, 336, 337, 413) . In fact, even after over 100 years of the study of the oral microbiota (including the new era of molecular techniques), no single species has been associated solely with either health or disease. Lord Kelvin, who discovered the absolute zero, once wrote about the paramount value of quantification: I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind; it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely in your thoughts advanced to the state of Science, whatever the matter may be.",

It involves the use of digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotide sequences targeting the 16S ribosomal DNA gene that are hybridized with the total nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) extracted from biofilm samples. The probe sequences employed in the RNAoligonucleotide quantification technique are the same sequences used in the human oral microbial identification microarray, which facilitates the comparison of results. In order to permit quantification, sequences complementary to the probes are used as standards and are added to the membranes, typically at 0.004 and 0.04 pM. Chemiluminescent signals are then visualized using a charge-coupled device camera (Fig. 13) . Besides its high throughput and being quantitative, another advantage of the RNA-oligonucleotide quantification technique is that it targets primarily the ribosomal RNA molecule, which is far more abundant than the ribosomal RNA gene. The first benefit of this approach is that an abundant target molecule obviates the need for the PCRamplification step. Oligonucleotide probes are known to be relatively specific but to lack sensitivity; therefore, an amplification step is often required if the target is the ribosomal RNA gene. The second benefit is that, because of the use of ribosomal RNA as a Fig. 12 .

The absolute and relative (normalized to total ribosomal RNA) amounts of the ribosomal RNA from a specific bacterial species are not direct measures of cell counts, because the ribosomal RNA content might change over at least one order of magnitude during the bacterial cell cycle (13) . Therefore, we now prefer to express the results from the RNA-oligonucleotide quantification tech-nique in pM. In fact, the role of the ribosomes as protein factories is so crucial that changes in the cellular ribosomal RNA of specific populations are highly significant, even though it might not be possible to discern from it specific parameters such as growth rates or cell counts.

(13) The human oral microbiome database As mentioned in earlier sections of this article, the diversity of the oral cavity initially demonstrated by culture (131, 246) was expanded by cloning studies to include the unculturable segment of the oral microbiota. These studies indicated several novel phylotypes that were associated with periodontal health and disease (95, 159, 189, 190, 276) . One of the major challenges posed by the discovery of those novel taxa is that aside from the sequence information and a clone number, not much more information on them was available. Many uncultured \u2044 unnamed taxa were referred to by obscure isolate or clone numbers. Because no defined, curated systematic naming scheme was in place, it was difficult to compare the results from different studies using cloning. This became particularly critical when associations between specific phylotypes and certain clinical states were examined. The human oral microbiome database (http:// www.homd.com) (51) was developed to provide a provisional naming scheme where each human oral taxon (HOT) is given a unique number. This HOT number is linked to their source, curated sequence information, synonyms (i.e. previously described clones that are genetically similar), taxonomic hierarchy, bibliographic information and status (i.e. cultured, or unnamed cultured \u2044 uncultured). In addition, the estimated prevalence of each HOT in the oral cavity is also available, as determined by a comprehensive cloning and sequencing initiative (75) . In this study, more than 35,000 clones of clinical samples from different oral conditions, as well as 1,000 clinical oral isolates from culture collections (75), were examined and sequenced. In its current format, the human oral microbiome database contains 645 taxa: about 50% are named species, about 16% are unnamed cultured taxa and about 34% represent uncultured phylotypes. Once a taxonomic anchor (a HOT number) is given to a taxon, it remains unchanged. This is a major advantage for the establishment of a foundation of the oral microbiome, particularly because of ongoing efforts to characterize oral isolates from culture collections (75, (81) (82) (83) , as well as to culture uncultured taxa (85, 323, 387) . The success of those efforts, and the value of the human oral microbiome database, are highlighted by the increase in the percentage of named species and the decrease in the percentage of unnamed cultured taxa since 2010 (51) . In addition to information specific to each taxon, the human oral microbiome database also offers a user-friendly interface and a series of analytical tools to facilitate the query and analysis of its growing data set.",

            "text": "Lesson learned: molecular and culture techniques are required to study the microbiota of periodontal diseases Given the complexity involved in the characterization of the microbiome of any habitat, and the fact that all techniques have biases and limitations, it is unlikely that one technique will be able to resolve this issue and agnostically determine the microbiota associated with periodontal health and disease. It is probable that at least two techniques combined will be necessary (e.g. culture and molecular methods). This approach has been proposed and tested by Vianna et al. (391) and Donachie et al. (80) . Donachie et al. (80) challenged the dogma perpetuated by the \u00d4great plate count anomaly\u00d5 that culture approaches detected only a fraction of the total number of bacteria in a sample and were limited in scope. They also criticized the exclusive reliance on RNA sequencing for environmental studies of microbial diversity. According to the authors: \u00d4overlooking a century of cultivation history and encouraging the use of only ribosomal approaches leads to significant gaps in microbial diversity data\u00d5. They reasoned that culture methods are critical in microbial diversity studies as these methods identified organisms that were undetected using molecular techniques. To test their hypothesis they examined to what extent the data sets of culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches overlapped. They posited that if open-ended 16S ribosomal RNA-based approaches represented better the \u00d4true\u00d5 diversity present in a microbial sample, culture libraries should not detect taxa absent from data sets recovered using the molecular approach. Data from seven studies were compared in which culture and open-ended molecular techniques were used on the same samples. Samples had been collected from a wide range of ecosystems, including root canals, caries lesions, lakes and oceans. It was observed that the largest overlap between the two approaches was 30% in caries samples and 20% in endodontic samples, which means that each approach was covering a different segment of the microbiota. In addition, in two of the ecosystems under study, there was no overlap between the two approaches. Therefore, the study could not demonstrate that molecular approaches captured a wider spectrum of microbial diversity. In addition, when analyzing microscopic and plate counts, one can see at least part of what is not being detected in culture because the morphotypes initially observed are not recovered from agar plates. On the other hand, in molecular techniques, one does not have the opportunity to \u00d4see\u00d5 what has not been amplified, unless mock communities are used.",

Recent approaches have included the pursuit of members of a specific phylum using a helper species (388) , the search of culture collections (mainly the Moores\u00d5 collection) for isolates of previously unnamed taxa (75, (81) (82) (83) 387) or the search for isolates in mixed bacterial populations grown in situ (168, 254, 323) . In addition, an elegant approach was recently devised by Duran-Pinedo et al. (85) . The authors combined molecular techniques and novel cluster-analysis methods to enable the culture of an uncultured taxon. The human oral microbial identi-fication microarray data from subgingival biofilm samples (89 healthy sites and 514 periodontitis sites) were evaluated using correlation network analysis, which allowed the identification of bacterial clusters, named modules that represent important microbial associations within the subgingival microbial community. The authors managed to identify, in silico, a helper species that could support the growth of an uncultured organism. By identifying hubs that could act as keystone species in the bacterial modules, they were able to culture Tannerella sp. HOT 286 after two rounds of enrichment by the selected helper, Prevotella oris HOT 311. In the same publication, checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization data from 2,565 individual subgingival plaque samples were used to validate the algorithms used in the correlation network analysis. It is noteworthy that many of the modules identified by Duran-Pinedo et al. (85) were rather similar to the complexes described by Socransky et al. (337) , further validating their model 13 years after its first publication (Fig. 14) .",

As stated by Relman (2002) : The increasing availability of molecular pathogen discovery methods and ease with which molecular signatures are generated create a pressing problem of a different kind. How can one build a convincing body of evidence for a causative role of the putative pathogen in a disease process when the pathogen has not been isolated or purified? (289) The search for relevant uncultured \u2044 unnamed species An ongoing study in our department is using the RNAoligonucleotide quantification technique to identify prominent, as yet uncultured or culturable, but currently unnamed, subgingival taxa associated with periodontal health or disease. The secondary objective of this study is to recover in pure culture \u00d4easy\u00d5to-culture taxa (i.e. to isolate in pure culture, culturable, but as yet unnamed, prominent taxa). In the process, we will determine which taxa are truly \u00d4unculturable\u00d5. As the work involving the isolation and culture of yetunculturable species will involve substantial effort (387, 388) , one needs to be reasonably confident of their relevance to periodontal health or disease. The goal of the study is to identify biologically meaningful taxa currently considered to be unculturable \u2044 unnamed, grow them in the laboratory, isolate them and then characterize and properly classify them as bacterial species. These steps are crucial for virulence, antigenicity and functional genomics studies and for the investigation of essential growth factors and signaling molecules. In essence, we are following the recommendation of Socransky et al. (340) on how to overcome certain difficulties in the search for etiological agents of periodontal diseases:",

            "text": "For instance, in the human oral microbiome database, 221 taxa are listed as uncultured and 104 are presented as unnamed cultured. It is unlikely that they are all equally important to health and disease. Thus, if one desires to start culturing and characterizing them, one should then be reasonably confident of their importance to health or disease. Even though efforts had been initiated for the culture of unculturable taxa (254, 323, 388) and for the identification of unnamed culturable taxa from collections of clinical isolates (75, 81, 83, 394) , there has been no systematic attempt to culture those microorganisms that are likely to be more relevant to periodontal health or disease. The rationale underlying this study is to eliminate the \u00d4distraction\u00d5 represented by transient and or bystander taxa and focus the search for novel prominent bacteria on abundant, widespread taxa. As mentioned earlier, the probes employed in the RNA-oligonucleotide quantification technique share the same sequences as those included in the human oral microbial identification microarray. Thus, we selected probes that only detected uncultured or unnamed cultured taxa. In order to obtain an estimate of their relevance, we computed their frequency of distribution, based on a subset of the data from a recent intervention study completed at The Forsyth Institute (described above under the section on the human oral microbial identification microarray). The 92 probes included in our probe panel are listed in Table 1 , in decreasing order of prevalence in periodontitis patients. It can be observed that the top 10 probes detected their targets in more than 16% of the subjects evaluated. Conversely, 25 probes never yielded a positive signal. Figure 15 shows the prevalence in sites from periodontally healthy individuals (n = 8) and in sites from periodontitis patients (n = 8) for the taxa detected using the 92 probes selected. It can be observed that a number of uncultured taxa were detected significantly more frequently in periodontitis sites (P < 0.002), including TM7 spp. HOT 346 and HOT 349, Desulfobulbus sp. HOT 041, Treponema spp. HOT 245, HOT 256 and HOT 508, TM7 spp. HOT 356 and HOT 437 and Synergistetes spp. HOT 360, HOT 362 and HOT 453. In addition, P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum, which were included as \u00d4reference\u00d5 species owing to their known associations with periodontal disease, were also more prevalent in diseased sites. This was the first phase of the study and the results have been further evaluated in a second set of 16 patients (data analysis in progress). In order to select only the most relevant taxa, we established a threshold of 10% of detection; that is, taxa that were not detected in at least 10% of the sites (depicted by the vertical red lines) will not be pursued further because of the low probability of their relevance in health or disease. Figure 16 shows the levels (pM) of the taxa selected for further analysis in sites from healthy individuals and subjects with periodontitis. It can be observed that the levels of the uncultured taxa Haemophilus spp. HOT 035 and HOT 036, Synergistetes spp. HOT with chronic periodontitis (purple) (n = 8). Significant differences are indicated with an asterisk (chi square test, P < 0.002). Red vertical bars highlight taxa that were present in fewer than 10% of sites. Taxa present in fewer than 10% of sites were excluded from subsequent analyses.",

To put in perspective the differences in the levels of those tax between the two site categories it can be observed that the magnitude of the differences was comparable to that of P. gingivalis. The analyses described above will be repeated in a second set of individuals and the taxa most associated with health and disease (based on prevalence and levels) will be selected. We anticipate that this selection will result in a panel of 40 probes, which will be used to guide the isolation, in pure culture, of culturable, but yet unnamed, taxa. The rationale for this phase of the study is that many of the uncultured \u2044 unnamed cultured taxa may be cultured using standard culture techniques, leaving a smaller set as truly uncultured species. We will use the oligonucleotide probes to the selected 40 prominent unculturable \u2044 unnamed taxa to screen isolates obtained from subgingival biofilm samples from periodontally healthy and diseased subjects. Samples will be dispersed, serially diluted, plated on five isolation media and grown in three different atmospheres: anaerobic, Fig. 16 .

Colonies that give positive signals on each medium \u2044 atmosphere combination will be counted and the data used to select the three best media \u2044 atmosphere combinations that provided the greatest recovery of unnamed taxa. In the final stage of the study, a second set of samples from periodontally healthy and diseased subjects with be grown using the three selected media \u2044 atmosphere combinations. After incubation, all isolates on primary isolation plates containing at least 50 colonies will be picked and spotted onto three plates of the same medium. After incubation, two such plates will be \u00d4lifted\u00d5 and hybridized with two sets of 20 probes, while the third will be kept as a source of test isolates. Colonies that give positive signals will be identified using the RNAoligonucleotide quantification technique, while the unnamed isolates will be phenotypically characterized and sequenced. We expect that the characterization of these species will be the first stage in delineating novel pathogens and will focus the search for the truly uncultured species by providing targeting probes. Distinguishing the culturable but unnamed taxa will provide isolates for taxonomy, virulence and antigenicity testing, and structural and physiological characterization.",

            "text": "The interaction between bacterial taxa present in the subgingival environment in periodontal health and disease has been explored using different approaches. Unfortunately, most existing methods for biofilm sample collection disrupt the tridimensional structure of these polymicrobial structures. Even though microbial complexes have been determined by Socransky et al. (337) , and corroborated by others over the years using different approaches (85, 178) , the model was built based on the frequency of the simultaneous occurrence of a group of taxa, irrespective of their spatial distribution within the biofilm. During sample collection for checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization, the physical interaction and the spatial distribution of the species identified are disrupted and therefore they cannot be inferred using this technique. The elegant model proposed by Kolenbrander et al. (178) , summarizing the interactions and localization of the taxa that colonize the subgingival environment, represents a compilation of findings from the authors and other researchers, deduced using reductionist in-vitro and in-vivo experiments. The physical interaction and biogeography of periodontal bacteria have been explored using immunohistochemistry (176, (256) (257) (258) (259) and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (317, 411) . These results indicated that, in subgingival plaque, red complex bacteria tend to be part of the epithelium-associated biofilm, orange complex species are typically found in the \u00d4loosely attached\u00d5 biofilm and Actinomyces species, as well as species of the green and yellow complexes, tend to localize in the coronal portions of the biofilm, mostly in the tooth-associated biofilm (336) . Data from Zijnge et al. (411) suggested that species of Fusobacterium and Tannerella were present in the intermediate layer of subgingival biofilms; species associated with periodontitis (such as P. intermedia, P. gingivalis, P. endodontalis and P. micra) were localized in the outer layer of the biofilm; and a fourth layer of unattached plaque, consisting mainly of Spirochetes, seemed to form on top of the outer layer of the subgingival biofilm. Noteworthy was the demonstration of the presence of species of Synergistetes in close proximity to host immune cells, indicating their potential role in host-microbe interactions (411) . Recently, Schillinger et al. (317) showed a tight clustering of F. nucleatum \u2044 F. periodonticum and T. forsythia in in-vivo developed biofilms, as well as a random spatial distribution between P. gingivalis and P. intermedia in these in-vivo samples.",

            "text": "Those studies provided valuable information regarding the tridimensional organization of subgingival microbiota. However, limitations in current technologies have prevented a comprehensive study of microbial community organization (375) . In principle, fluorescence in-situ hybridization probes could be designed with ribosomal RNA sequence specificity for nearly any microbial phylotype or taxon. The limitations of this approach reside in the use of the filters in fluorescence image acquisition and in the excitation crosstalk and emission bleed-through of available organic fluorochromes (375) . These technical constraints limit the number of fluorophores that can be differentiated simultaneously (375, 395) . Valm et al. (375) overcame these limitations using a combinatorial labeling strategy coupled with spectral image acquisition and analysis, therefore greatly expanding the number of fluorescent signatures discernible in a single image. The technique, named combinatorial labeling and spectral imaging-fluorescence in-situ hybridization, uses genus-and familyspecific probes to simultaneously visualize and differentiate 15 different phylotypes. Figure 18 presents combinatorial labeling and spectral imaging-fluorescence in-situ hybridization images of semidispersed human dental plaque. The figure shows that the plaque was dominated by early colonizers, including species of Streptococcus, Prevotella, Actinomyces and Veillonella. Proximity analysis was used to determine the frequency of intertaxon and intrataxon cell-to-cell associations, which revealed statistically significant intertaxon pairings. Cells of the genera Prevotella and Actinomyces showed the most interspecies associations, suggesting a central role for these genera in establishing and maintaining biofilm complexity. Work is underway at The Forsyth Institute, in collaboration with Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratories (Woods Hole, MA, USA), to expand the probe panel used initially and explore the spatial organization of the oral microbiome to include biofilms associated with different oral surfaces for which the microbial profiles have been described (3, 225) , as well as the subgingival biofilms associated with the different surfaces of the periodontal pockets.",

            "text": "At the beginning of this article we described a causal model where a constellation of causal factors need to be present in order for disease to occur. Such a model can help us to understand several of the apparent inconsistencies pointed out by some in the concept of periodontal diseases as specific bacterial infections. For instance, if we accept for a moment that for periodontal diseases to occur one requires -as minimally sufficient causes -periodontal pathogens, the proper local environment and a susceptible host, the presence of periodontal pathogens in the absence of periodontal tissue destruction can be easily explained. However, it is apparent that to understand fully the mechanisms that contribute to periodontal disease initiation, the study of the microbial challenge will not be sufficient. Among the many factors that define the so-called \u00d4host susceptibility\u00d5, the immunoinflammatory response that accompanies the bacterial challenge is clearly part of the constellation of minimal causes that lead to periodontal tissue destruction. In other words, without inflammation, there is no periodontal disease initiation and progression. Evidence to support a role of inflammation in periodontal diseases comes from epidemiological studies; these studies have indicated that the presence of gingival inflammation over prolonged periods of time is associated with clinical attachment loss and tooth loss (313, 314) . However, at times, inflammation has taken center stage as the main event in the processes that lead to periodontal diseases: Some individuals think of the periodontal problem essentially in terms of inflamed gingiva, pocket formation, calculus, and bone resorption. These conditions may have about the same relevance to the root infection problem as inflammation, tubercule formation, granulomatous lesions, caseation, and cavitation have to tuberculosis. (173) Inflammation has not been traditionally considered as the etiological agent of periodontitis but rather as a mechanism of its pathogenesis, defined in the Merriam-Webster.com online dictionary as \u00d4the origination and development of a disease\u00d5. In classical texts, bacteria have been referred to as the etiological agents of periodontal diseases, while inflammation has been referred to as one of the mechanisms involved in their pathogenesis. These concepts have been the cornerstones of our understanding of periodontal diseases for decades and elegantly acknowledge the microbial challenge and the immuno-inflammatory host response as key elements of periodontal disease etiology and pathogenesis. However, in recent years, this simple framework has been challenged once more by efforts to assign greater importance to the immuno-inflammatory response compared with the microbiota in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. Such emphasis on host factors has led some authors to hypothesize that they might outweigh bacteria as determinants of periodontal disease onset and severity (266) . One might argue that with so much still to be learned about the composition of the subgingival microbiota and its functions that this statement was rather premature. In addition, trying to determine the proportion of disease caused either by bacteria or by the host response might be counterproductive as it is clear that neither factor alone will cause periodontal tissue destruction. In the words of Page and co-authors: \u00d4Saying that this process (periodontal disease) is mediated entirely by the host or entirely by the bacteria would simply propagate another decade of misunderstanding\u00d5 (267) .",

Conversely, the inflammatory infiltrate clearly results in a loss of collagen content and is adjacent to the bone-resorbing activity. Although bacterial products, such as proteases and lipopolysaccharides, can cause direct tissue damage (282) and stimulate bone resorption (84), host-derived molecules, such as matrix metalloproteinases and interleukin-1b, are more potent mediators of these catabolic processes (148, 342, 344, 345) . Furthermore, it is likely that the levels of inflammatory mediators which lead to tissue destruction reach much higher concentrations within the periodontal lesions than do microbial products with similar functions. Hence, it is well accepted that most of the tissue destruction observed in periodontal diseases results from indirect damage mediated by the immuno-inflammatory response. However, even if inflammation is the main mechanism of destruction of periodontal tissues, this does not imply that its direct control is the best strategy for the prevention and the treatment of periodontal diseases.

These drugs block the activity of cyclooxygenases, preventing the metabolism of arachidonic acid. A series of animal studies in the 1980s demonstrated that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs were capable of slowing the progression of periodontal diseases (154) . Subsequent human clinical studies demonstrated similar results (398); however, the safety profile of these drugs did not allow for their prolonged continuous use. Drugs that selectively inhibited cyclooxygenase-2 were received with great enthusiasm because they promised to minimize the gastrointestinal adverse effects observed with the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (306) . However, the long-term use of these drugs was later associated with the occurrence of congestive heart failure in a significant proportion of subjects (170) . The only therapeutic adjunct on the market for periodontal disease therapy that interferes with the host response is low-dose doxycycline (Periostat \u00d2 ) (116, 117) . The mechanism by which this drug is understood to control periodontal tissue destruction is through its anti-collagenolytic activity, resulting from the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (115) . However, it has been demonstrated that the use of low-dose doxycycline also results in changes in the proportion of subgingival bacterial species that are resistant to doxycycline, demonstrating its impact on the subgingival microbiota (129) .

Reports of osteochemonecrosis of the jaw associated with the use of bisphosphonates raises serious questions about the safety profile of this class of drugs (241) . Although the prevalence of osteochemonecrosis of the jaw is rather low and the mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis are still not fully understood, there is evidence that they might be associated with infection (234) . One of the mechanisms proposed posited that blocking osteoclastic activity would impair the ability of bone tissue to \u00d4fight infections\u00d5. Bone resorption, including that observed in periodontal diseases, can be interpreted as a mechanism of defense against infectious agents. More recently, agents that can block the activity of RANKL, such as anti-RANKL monoclonal antibodies (e.g. denosumab), have also been proposed as an approach to control periodontal bone loss (376) .",

Nevertheless, because of the chronic nature of periodontal diseases, susceptible subjects would be required to use this(these) agent(s) for prolonged periods of time. That implies that they would be required to have a rather benign safety profile. Such an approach would be analogous to the use of fluorides to prevent dental caries in the sense that the use of fluorides controls the disease process (i.e. demineralization of enamel) without interfering with its bacterial etiology (i.e. S. mutans). The use of fluorides is a good example of how interfering with pathogenesis, rather than etiology, might lead to a successful strategy for disease control. The analogy is only flawed because the pathogenesis of dental caries involves a biochemical reaction, rather than an immuno-inflammatory response. In any case, no anti-inflammatory drug with a safety profile that would afford its long-term use currently exists. Drugs that promote resolution of inflammation might offer a safe alternative to hostresponse modulation in the near future.",

Molecules such as lipoxins, aspirin-triggered lipoxins, protectins and resolvins act as agonists of the resolution phase of inflammation, activate the elimination of inflammatory leukocytes and promote tissue healing (171) . These agents must be differentiated from the antiinflammatory drugs discussed in the previous section that simply block inflammatory pathways at different points. In contrast, proresolvins promote a return to tissue homeostasis (170) . Using a P. gingivalis-induced rabbit model of periodontitis, Hasturk et al. (146) demonstrated that topical applications of resolvin E1 prevented the onset and progression of destructive periodontal disease. The same group later demonstrated that resolvin E1 was capable of inducing the regeneration of periodontal tissues, including new periodontal ligament, cementum and alveolar bone (147) . These remarkable results were expanded when daily dietary supplementation with omega-3 polyusaturated fatty acids (the precursors of resolvins and protectins) and low-dose aspirin were used as an adjunct to mechanical periodontal therapy in a human clinical study (91) . After 6 months of daily use of 81 mg of aspirin and 3 g of fish oil (the source of omega-3 polyusaturated fatty acids), the clinical results favored the test group, which showed gains in clinical attachment level and pocket-depth reductions comparable with those obtained in studies testing adjunctive systemic antibiotics. The use of this class of host-modulatory drugs shows promise in terms of revolutionizing the way in which clinicians will treat periodontal infections in the near future.",

Application of resolvin E1 resulted in a return of the microbiota to the baseline composition, together with the elimination of P. gingivalis.

The group from Charles Serhan\u00d5s laboratory recently reported on anti-infective mechanisms of proresolving mediators (53) . Using a murine model of peritoneal infection induced by E. coli, resolvin D1 and resolvin D5 were able to reduce bacterial titers in blood and increase survival. These molecules and protectin D1 were also capable of enhancing the phagocytosis of E. coli by human neutrophils and macrophages, while resolvin D5 counter-regulated a panel of proinflammatory genes, including nuclear factor-kappaB and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Furthermore, the authors demonstrated that resolvin D1, resolvin D5 and protectin D1, in association with ciprofloxacin, enhanced host antimicrobial responses. In skin infections, proresolvins enhanced the vancomycin-induced clearance of S. aureus. The authors concluded that proresolving mediators had antiphlogistic actions, enhanced the containment of infectious agents and lowered the dose of antibiotic required for bacterial clearance. Therefore, the effects of resolvins on the prevention of destructive periodontal diseases might also be explained by indirect antimicrobial mechanisms. It is tempting to speculate what the clinical effects would be of the combined use of systemic antibiotics and proresolvins in the treatment of periodontal diseases.",

Still, for the most part, host-microbe interactions do not result in overt disease or in tissue destruction. For most bacteria, including pathogens, asymptomatic colonization and \u2044 or clearance without blatant disease are the most common results of an encounter with the host. As a result of genetic variability among different strains of the same bacterial species and individuals of the same host species, these interactions might be rather unique, with several possible outcomes, including: immediate clearance, colonization (with or without disease), longterm asymptomatic carriage, invasion, direct damage (e.g. bacterial toxins) and immunopathology. Clearance might occur after other interactions, for instance, as a result of a disease process. In addition, a carrier state may evolve into overt disease. Therefore, disease onset seems to require a fairly specific set of interactions between host and bacterial factors. Even some of the most relevant human pathogens, such as S. pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, cause disease on relatively rare occasions, considering the level of exposure to these microorganisms (279) . As alluded to earlier, much attention has been paid to the notion that periodontal tissue destruction results from indirect, rather than direct, tissue damage induced by bacteria. Immunopathology is a pathogenic mechanism common to many infections; however, the specific immuno-inflammatory mechanisms involved in different infectious diseases are distinct. Considering its polymicrobial nature, it can be anticipated that the host-microbe interactions that occur during periodontal disease initiation are quite variable and rather unique.",

            "text": "It is important to realize that infectious agents are active determinants of the nature of the immune response triggered in the infected host. If one considers, for instance, the polarization of T-helper cells into Thelper 1, T-helper 2 or T-regulatory cell subsets, the nature of the antigenic challenge is a major determinant of the nature of T-cell responses (30, 71, 275) . Mice immunized with P. gingivalis alone resulted in the production of anti-P. gingivalis IgG1 (a T-helper 2 cell response), while previous immunization with F. nucleatum resulted in the production of anti-P. gingivalis IgG2a (a T-helper 1 cell response) (112) . Oral bacterial antigens from Bacteroides fragilis, S. mitis and P. acnes primed human dendritic cells to induce T-helper 1 cell, T-helper 2 cell and T-regulatory cell differentiation, respectively (181) . Lymphocytes stimulated with antigens from oral streptococci increased the expression of interleukin-4 (a T-helper 2 cell cytokine), while stimulation with antigens from Bacteroides species resulted in increased expression of interferon-c (a T-helper 1 cell cytokine) (155) . Antigens of oral streptococci induced the differentiation of na\u00efve T-cells into T-helper 2 cells, while antigen preparations of anaerobic bacteria induced the differentiation of T-helper 1 cells (386) . P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide can also modulate T-cell immunity by downregulating the expression of cytokines such as interferon-c, interleukin-12 and interleukin-8 (296) . Furthermore, A. actinomycetemcomitans is capable of modulating T-cell responses through several mechanisms, including induction of T-cell apoptosis (252) , expression of superantigens (406) and preferential stimulation of T-cells secreting interleukin-4 and interleukin-10 (407) . Therefore, the expression of cytokines that modulate T-cell immunity is influenced by the composition of subgingival biofilms. It is beyond the scope of this manuscript to review all host-microbe interactions that have been reported in periodontal diseases. The lesson learned here is that in host-microbe interactions during periodontal pathogenesis, neither player has a passive role.",

            "text": "In trying to understand the role of inflammatory mediators and the processes that they regulate during periodontal disease pathogenesis, scientists have often opted for reductionist approaches using in-vitro systems and \u2044 or animal models. Molecules such as cytokines have been dichotomized as either \u00d4protec-tive\u00d5 or \u00d4destructive\u00d5 or as either \u00d4proinflammatory\u00d5 or \u00d4anti-inflammatory\u00d5. Although the data generated using these approaches have greatly enhanced our knowledge of the patterns of expression of these molecules in periodontal health and disease, it has become apparent that these approaches will no longer suffice for the study of complex host-microbe interactions. The inadequacy of simple scenarios where proinflammatory cytokines should be inhibited, while anti-inflammatory cytokines could be used as therapeutics, is illustrated by the realization that their functions might vary depending on the context in which they are studied. For instance, interleukin-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine that has been associated with periodontal tissue destruction and has been proposed as a biomarker of periodontal disease progression (111) . However, there is evidence that interleukin-6 might act as a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine. In a murine model of peri-apical lesions, interleukin-6 knockout mice and the neutralization of interleukin-6 using antibodies resulted in significantly higher periapical bone resorption (29) . Interfering with the cytokine network (or with any other class of inflammatory mediators for that matter), without taking into account the effects on the host-microbe interactions, might have disastrous consequences.",

            "text": "The lessons learned from the studies on sepsis might be quite relevant. When anticytokine therapy was used in animal models of sepsis (e.g. anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha) not all animal models demonstrated enhanced survival, particularly when cytokines were blocked in live bacterial models compared with models using injection of purified endotoxins (endotoxemia). In fact, these studies demonstrated that an endogenous tumor necrosis factor-alpha response was essential for the formation of abscesses to isolate the infectious agent (79) . This is particularly relevant when drugs that block tumor necrosis factor-alpha, used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (an autoimmune disease) are suggested by some as a potential treatment for periodontal diseases, which are infections (236) . There is a growing body of evidence that blocking tumor necrosis factor-alpha might result in an increased risk for opportunistic infections, including mycobacterial diseases. Furthermore, absence of the interleukin-1 receptor can also result in decreased resistance to Listeria or to gram-positive bacteria (79) . In his elegant review of the role of cytokines in periodontal disease pathogenesis, Garlet (107) stressed the fallacy of examining the functions of cytokines solely under the \u00d4protective vs. destructive archetype\u00d5 and emphasized the need to take into account their role in the \u00d4control of infection viewpoint\u00d5. In fact, his research team had previously reported a role for tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-c in controlling the microbial challenge in periodontal diseases. Using knockout mice and A. actinomycetemcomitans infection to induce periodontal disease, they demonstrated that both cytokines were essential for the control of the experimental infection, as evidenced by an increased bacterial load and elevated acute-phase response compared with wild-type controls (108, 109) . Here we have another example of how the focus solely on the host response might be counterproductive.",

It is also recognized that subgingival biofilms present great variability in their microbial composition (124, 158) , and neighboring sites on different teeth may differ considerably in their levels and proportions of colonizing bacterial species (336) . Far less appreciated has been the effect of this microbial diversity on the cytokine milieu released by the adjacent periodontal tissues. Teles et al. (363) examined, in periodontally healthy subjects and in subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis, invivo associations among the composition of subgingival biofilms (determined using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization) and the levels of eight cytokines in the gingival crevicular fluid [measured using a multiplexed bead immunoassay (Luminex)]. The microbiotas associated with periodontal health and generalized aggressive periodontitis were characterized using hierarchical cluster analysis of the site-specific levels of 40 subgingival species. The results demonstrated that the cytokine profiles associated with the clusters in the periodontally healthy subjects were more homogeneous and presented a similar pattern, with interleukin-10 comprising over 50% of the total gingival crevicular fluid cytokines. In contrast, the group of patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis presented a more diverse pattern of cytokine expression among the microbial clusters (Fig. 19 ). The authors concluded that different subgingival biofilm profiles are associated with distinct patterns of expression of gingival crevicular fluid cytokines.",

Five clusters (CL1-CL5) were formed at >33% similarity. Four subjects presented at least one site with a microbial profile that did not fit any cluster (NIC). The numbers above each panel represent the number of subjects with at least one site with the microbial profile that defined that cluster.

This simple statement implies that in order to understand fully the mechanisms that lead to periodontal diseases, scientists in the field will have to use alternative approaches to the ones employed so far. This is not necessarily a new lesson; in a comment about the difficulties in identifying the etiological agents of periodontal infections, Socransky wrote: \u00d4Unfortunately, at this time it is difficult to even suggest methods to assess the significance of bacterial agents or metabolites in ''natural'' periodontal diseases\u00d5 (332) . It is not difficult to imagine that the same statement would apply to the study of the immuno-inflammatory response in periodontal diseases. Traditionally, science has taken a reductionist approach, dissecting biological systems into their building blocks and studying them separately. Because individual parts of biological systems (e.g. single genes or proteins) never work in isolation, but rather in integrated networks, reductionist methodologies will never give us a complete picture of how those complex systems work. Because health and disease are the result of the dynamic changes in these integrated networks, a more holistic \u00d4systems biology\u00d5 approach will be required to understand them fully (105) . There is no consensus regarding the definition of systems biology, but it can be described as methods aimed at integrating quantitative data from different outputs with the objective to describe and predict the function of biological systems. The predictive models derived from such methodology should greatly enhance our ability to understand health and disease; they should not only allow for a better description of biological systems, but should also help in the study of those systems. In other words, these models should help us to discover new properties of the biological systems they attempt to characterize. In the past decade the systems-biology paradigm has been favored by many scientists trying to understand the incredible complexity of biological systems and apply this knowledge to clinical practice.",

For instance, human studies have been conducted on the transcriptome of gingival tissues in health and disease, and at different stages during experimental gingivitis (262, 272) . Papapanou et al. (272) demonstrated that colonization by T. forsythia and P. gingvalis was associated with the differential expression of thousands of genes in the adjacent gingival tissue, while the host-compatible species A. naeslundii was merely associated with eight probe sets. The transcriptome of gingival tissues during experimental gingivitis has also been recently characterized (262) . The data demonstrated that 131 immune response-related genes were significantly up-regulated or down-regulated during the induction and \u2044 or resolution of gingivitis. These genes corresponded to a relatively small subset (11.9%) of immune-response genes present in the gene array, suggesting specificity in the gingival transcriptomic response to plaque accumulation. In addition, new candidate genes and pathways were identified as being altered during experimental gingivitis, including neural processes, epithelial defenses, angiogenesis and wound healing. Unbiased metabolomic profiling of gingival crevicular fluid samples from healthy, gingivitis and periodontitis sites demonstrated that the metabolic composition of gingival crevicular fluid was the result of host and bacterial interactions and accurately reflected the disease status of the site (31) . The results suggested up-regulation of the inflammatory pathway of purine degradation, depletion of antioxidants, the degradation of host cellular components, the accumulation of bacterial products and the leakage of host circulation components into disease sites (Fig. 20) (31) .",

Periodontal disease initiation and progression might not only be associated with shifts in biofilm composition but also result from changes in the biofilm metabolism and the synthesis of virulence factors. Hence, there was a need to develop new tools to study the physiology of these microorganisms in their environment. Newly developed metatranscriptomic approaches have been engineered for characterizing the gene expression of entire microbial communities (103) ; studies using this approach, combined with metagenomics, were recently initiated at The Forsyth Institute (102) . Metagenomic and gene-expression analysis of entire complex bacterial communities in situ provide the information required to understand the activity and relative importance of the constituents of the pathogenic biofilm during periodontal infections, including unculturable microorganisms. Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics treat the microbial community and its constituent genes as a whole. In metagenomic analysis, DNA is extracted from the entire community and large-scale sequencing is conducted on the community\u00d5s genomic material. This approach overcomes bias and other problems associated with PCR amplification (77) and it is not limited to analysis of a predetermined number of bacteria, or to a specific gene such as 16S ribosomal RNA (100) .",

The key to assess expression analysis in whole microbial communities is the linear amplification of small quantities of RNA extracted from the bacterial assemblages. The final amplified RNA is a direct representation of the relative abundance of mRNA in the original sample. Linear RNA amplification methods have been previously used to study gene expression in eukaryotic tissues but are not generally applicable to microbial mRNA because of the requirement for a poly(A) tail. Wendisch et al. (397) developed a method for the polyadenylation of bacterial mRNA, which facilitates the preferential isolation of bacterial mRNA from ribosomal RNA in crude Fig. 20 .

The levels of inosine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, uric acid, guanosine and guanine in gingival crevicular fluid samples from each site category (healthy, gingivitis and periodontitis) are shown in box plots for groups (representing the data distribution of the 22 participants in the study) and in scatter plots for each individual subject. The metabolites that were up-regulated and down-regulated by periodontal disease are indicated by up and down block arrows, respectively.

The second aspect that facilitates metatranscriptomic analysis of whole bacterial communities is that pyrosequencing techniques now allow for the sequencing of large amounts of DNA, avoiding cloning biases associated with classical techniques. Taking advantage of this new technology, Frias-Lopez et al. (103) developed a method to study expression profiles of whole microbial communities in situ, opening the possibility of studying the physiology of microbes in their environment. This method allows the identification of species present in a complex microbial community, in addition to determining their metabolic activity. We anticipate that this approach will lead to the in-situ identification of virulence factors in oral biofilms that result in disease progression in periodontitis. The ability to characterize gene expression and gene interactions among entire bacterial communities in situ during different Fig. 21 . Metatranscriptomics from pooled samples from 74 sites from a periodontally healthy subject (no bleeding on probing, no gingival redness and pocket depth <2 mm) and pooled samples from 27 diseased sites from a subject with untreated chronic periodontitis (pocket depth >6 mm with bleeding on probing). Phylogenetic assignments of metatranscriptomic reads were performed using software for analyzing metagenomes [MEtaGenome ANalyzer (MEGAN)]. Illumina sequences from metatranscriptomic analysis were assigned to phylogenetic groups using BLAT results. Numbers of reads were normalized to database size, which are represented by different sizes of the pie charts. Reads from healthy patients are in white and reads from patients with periodontal disease are in red. Green semicircles represent the statistical significance of the differences after Holm-Bonferroni correction. The taxa identified were clustered according to phyla and genus. stages of periodontal disease progression has the potential to revolutionize the study of these infections. Figure 21 illustrates the proof-of-principle of this technology after the processing of pooled samples from 74 sites from a periodontally healthy subject (the sites sampled had no signs of gingivitis and a pocket depth of <2 mm) and pooled samples from 27 diseased sites from a subject with untreated chronic periodontitis [the sites sampled were deep (>6 mm) bleeding pockets]. Phylogenetic assignments of metatranscriptomic reads were performed using software for analyzing metagenomes [ME-taGenome ANalyzer (MEGAN)]. Illumina sequences from metatranscriptomic analyses were assigned to phylogenetic groups using BLAT results. The figure shows the comparison between reads from healthy patients and patients with periodontal disease. Overall, the data were consistent with our current understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic periodontal diseases. Genera that encompass putative periodontal pathogens, such as Porphyromonas, Tannerella, Prevotella, Treponema, Campylobacter and Parvimonas, showed a higher level of gene expression in the pooled sample from the subject with periodontitis. Conversely, genera characteristic of commensal species, such as Streptococcus, Veillonella, Neisseria and Actinomyces, showed a higher level of gene expression in the pooled sample from the healthy subject. Furthermore, the phylum Synergistetes, which contains yet-uncultured members only and has been recently associated with periodontal diseases, also demonstrated a higher level of gene expression in the pooled sample from the patient with periodontitis.",

Between 1969 and 1979, 135 subgingival plaque samples were examined by culture at The Forsyth Institute, a number that increased to 300 between 1982 and 1988 (50 samples per year). The use of a colony-lift method allowed the examination of 9,600 samples between 1988 and 1993, or 1920 samples per year. The use of the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique allowed the analysis of 34,400 samples between 1993 and 1999, about 5,734 samples per year",
