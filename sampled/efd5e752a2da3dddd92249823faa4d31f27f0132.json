A diagnosis 1 Barnet Hospital BH, 2 University College Hospital UCH The Coronavirus pandemic has changed all facets of our lives ranging from how we work, relax and travel. This includes an impact on the delivery medical training given the need for strict social distancing measures as lecture theatres can potentially become a medium for coronavirus spread. We aimed to explore hospital doctors experience of the delivery of training and new ways of working during this period. Hospital doctors at a UK NHS foundation trust were asked to complete a questionnaire on how they learnt about COVID19, their experience of the delivery of teaching and ways of working. 204 trainees took part; 39% were male with respondents being White (50%), Asian (25%) and black (3%). Trainees got updates and guidance about COVID19 from their employer (61%), TV news programmes (54%) and social media (45%). 73% of trainees indicated that the delivery of teaching had changed during COVID19. The commonest methods of delivery of teaching were through Microsoft teams (66%), webinars (27%) and zoom (25%). 17% reported face to face teaching with social distancing measures. 63% reported new ways of working including increased use of telephone and video consultations, zoom and Microsoft teams' multidisciplinary meetings and new rotas. The COVID19 pandemic has allowed the rapid transition from face to face teaching to using video collaborative tools for the delivery of teaching and healthcare. This allows trainees and trainers to access teaching sessions remotely thereby accessing training at a time of convenience and reducing travel time for the delivery of regional training days.",

Among heads of intensive care units, emergency departments and local ethic experts the department of geriatrics was asked for possible support in refining decision criteria with special regard to identify geriatric vulnerability and translate this in expected prognosis for severe course of lung crisis in the covid19-disease. Beside the qSOFA-score, patient preferences, comorbidity with terminal diseases, aspects of frailty and cognitive impairment were implemented. Those clinical aspects were translated in short and easy to assess control questions. Hereby the identification of both older patients with preserved resources (fit) and older patients already-independent from covid19-in an end of live situation (palliative aspects first) should be possible. A short check-list and a comment explaining the use of the checklist were developed. The algorithm and the check-list were accepted by the local committee and will be evaluated by retrospective interviews and case analysis for usefulness in clinical practice.",

This research aims to understand how responsive behaviours are managed, using both pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches, by nursing home staff in the Republic of Ireland during the Covid-19 pandemic. A further objective is to examine the impact of social isolation, due to Covid-19 restrictions, on responsive behaviour in residents with dementia. Methods: After receiving ethics approval from Lancaster University Faculty of Health and Medicine Research Ethics Committee (FHMREC) , an online questionnaire was distributed to nursing homes in Ireland (n = 443), to be completed during the period of Covid-19 restrictions, by care home managers, nurses and healthcare assistants. A sample of participants were invited to take part in an interview to explore their responses in greater depth. Concurrent analysis of qualitative data was informed by thematic analysis. Results: Preliminary findings indicate that during lockdown, the absence of family visits and social interaction, resulted in cognitive decline, low mood and an increase in responsive behaviours in some residents with dementia. Nursing home staff expressed concerns regarding inadequate external support during the Covid-19 pandemic and highlighted the need for well-trained staff, familiar with residents needs, to manage responsive behaviours effectively. Conclusions: The findings will inform policy and practice changes to support nursing homes and facilitate adoption of non-pharmacological approaches to manage responsive behaviours in residents with dementia.",

Social isolation leads to a wide range of psychological symptoms, including depression and anxiety, and negatively affects the quality of life [3] . The study evaluated the prevalence of depressive symptoms, activity and involvement in social life, as well as the quality of life before and after the outbreak. Methods: The study included 168 people over 60 years of age (125 females) who voluntarily completed an online survey. The presence of symptoms of depression was assessed using the Yesavage 15-point Geriatric Depression Rating Scale. On its basis, the subjects were divided into two groups (people without depressive symptoms-0-5 points and people with symptoms of depression [ 5 points). The quality of life was rated on a 10-point scale, where 0 points meant the worst possible, and 10-the best imaginable. Activity and involvement in social life were also assessed on a 10-point scale, where 0 said that the examined person was not able to get out of bed alone, and 10 points indicated the lack of any restrictions on activity. Both factors were assessed before and during the pandemic. Results: 31.5% of the respondents had depressive symptoms (among them, 94.3% were women). In people living alone, the symptoms of depression were significantly more frequent (p \\ 0.001) than among married ones. Activity and involvement in social life deteriorated significantly as a result of COVID-19 in all subjects (p \\ 0.001), among people with depressive symptoms (p \\ 0.0001) and persons without depressive symptoms (p \\ 0.0001). The mean scores before the outbreak of the pandemic in both groups were similar and amounted to 8.4 \u00b1 2.1 points for subjects without depressive symptoms and 8.0 \u00b1 2.1 points for those with symptoms of depression. As a consequence of the epidemic, people with symptoms of depression showed significantly worse activity and involvement in social life than people without depressive symptoms (6.2 \u00b1 2.4; 7.4 \u00b1 2.4 ; p \\ 0.001, respectively).Similar results were obtained for the quality of life. The COVID-19 outbreak significantly affected the quality of life in all subjects (p \\ 0.001), those with depressive symptoms (p \\ 0.001) and no symptoms (p \\ 0.001). People with depression indicated on average a significantly lower quality of life than people without depression, both before and during the pandemic (before the pandemic: 7.4 \u00b1 1.7; 8.2 \u00b1 1.6; p \\ 0.001; during a pandemic: 5.4 \u00b1 1.8; 6.6 \u00b1 1.8; p \\ 0.001, respectively). Conclusion: Social isolation associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the quality of life and has reduced the activity and involvement of older people in social life. Symptoms of depression among people over 60 years of age resulted in a significantly stronger deterioration in the quality of life and involvement in social life during the pandemic compared to subjects who did not have these symptoms.",

The patient was observed while using the nebuliser and it was noticed that she could not tolerate the mask affixed to her face to form an adequate seal, rather, she was holding it aloft and favouring her right side, such that the mist dispersed more readily to the left; this explained the unilateral manifestations. The assumption was subsequently proven upon discontinuing the ipratropium, when the pupils size, symmetry and reactivity returned to normal after around 24 h, in keeping with timescales documented in previous case reports. Discussion: Ipratropium bromide, as an antagonist of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, causes mydriasis due to unopposed action of the dilator pupillae muscle, and cycloplegia due to ciliary muscle relaxation. The ocular complications of ipratropium bromide are due to the local effect of the medication; i.e. when the aerosolised ipratropium comes into contact with the eyes. The incidence of ipratropium induced ocular complications is between 1% to \\ 1 per 1000 patients. Whilst there have been some case reports of ipratropium causing mydriasis, it remains in practice, a poorly recognised adverse drug reaction (ADR). Patients must be instructed in the correct administration of ipratropium nebuliser to avoid its release into the eye. Clinicians need to be aware of the uncommon mydriatic side effect of ipratropium to avoid unnecessary imaging and other investigations.",

The aim of this study is to analyse the ''phenomenon'' of hip fracture related to the urinary bladder. Methods: Prospective observational study of consecutive patients admitted to a UK teaching hospital with hip fracture in an 8 months period. Patients, notes and electronic records were reviewed; data were downloaded on excel sheet and analysed using descriptive statistics. Results: 377 hip fracture patients were admitted in the study period, of whom 51 patients (14%) had falls related to the bathroom. Of these 20% (10/51) male and 80% (41/51) female with average age of 81. 6 and 82 .8 years respectively. 51% (26/51) had urinary incontinence. 51% (26/51) had hypertension and 31% (16/51) had osteoarthritis. 67% (34/51) were on [ 4 drugs, 55% (28/51) were on antihypertensives, 22% (11/51) were on diuretics and 31% (16/51) were on an antidepressant. Falls were multifactorial; frailty in 41% (21/51) and postural hypotension in 24% (12/51) were considered the most contributing factors. Discussion: The number of patients who had fractures related to the urinary bladder could be underestimated as some older people with dementia were found on the floor with no reliable history; many of them could have been going to the bathroom. There are many reasons why elderly people might fall while going to the bathroom including postural hypotension, rushing to avoid urge incontinence, hypnotic or extrapyramidal side effects of medications, not using the mobility aids and poor lighting conditions.Conclusion: In this study 14% of falls resulting in hip fracture was attributed to the urinary bladder. Urinary bladder symptoms are a frequently forgotten risk factor for falls and fractures. To reduce the risk in this group of patients, urinary tract symptoms need to be explored, diagnosed and treated. Medications; specially antihypertensives and CNS active drugs should be rationalized and diuretics are to be avoided if possible.",

The culture of the tracheobronchial aspirate objectified a bacterial infection, corrected treated with antibiotic, but the patient develops intestinal symptoms, resulting in bacteriosis (Clostridium difficile). The aggravating spectrum of postoperative respiratory symptoms and the uncertain spectrum of intestinal symptoms led to the need for retesting for SARS CoV-2 pathology, with a positive result. We draw attention to the stereotypy in the manifestation and evolution of COVID-19 pathology in the senior and fragile patient. In the conditions of a previous negative result, only the symptomatic storm and the rapid degradation of the general condition claim the need for retesting. The insidious onset of respiratory phenomena and the false-negative or harvested test during the incubation period allowed surgery.",

In Ireland, 18.39% of reported cases were 75 years of age or older, as of 2nd June (2) . The ECDC have described the case definition to include the following clinical criteria; cough, shortness of breath, fever, anosmia/ageusia/dysguesia (3) . However, we must be cognizant that the older population may present atypically. Studies have shown that confusion is a common feature (4). Methods: We present two cases of covid-19 presenting to a tertiary hospital under the care of a geriatric team. Results: Case 1 is an 84 year old gentleman who presented with acute onset confusion and pyrexia. He had no respiratory symptoms. Collateral history confirmed that he was premorbidly fully independent with ADLs and had normal cognitive function. His past medical history includes ischaemic heart disease and prostate cancer. His chest X-Ray demonstrated bibasal infiltrates and he was lymphopenic (0.6). Case 2 is a 78 year old gentleman who presented following a witnessed fall. This occurred following a three day history of rigors and diaphoresis with fluctuating confusion in the preceding 24 h. There were no respiratory symptoms. Past medical history includes hypertension and glaucoma. Chest X-Ray demonstrated bilateral infiltrates and lymphocyte was normal (1.7). Conclusions: Atypical disease presentations in this age population is a well-recognized phenomenon that has preceded this pandemic. Age over 60 and underlying cardiac co-morbidity are associated with higher mortality 5 . It is imperative that we remain vigilant of atypical presentations. References: 1. WHO.

For those patients without medical reversibility from COVID-19, the terminal phase of their illness can be variable [2] . We describe the clinical course of the dying phase of three patients referred to palliative care services within a tertiary hospital to outline the heterogeneity within this cohort and the need to be vigilant for escalating symptoms at the end of life (EoL). Methods: Retrospective examination of clinical notes of three patients with COVID-19 referred to our specialist palliative care service to determine symptomatology and medication requirements at the EoL. Results: Our patients suffered predominantly from dyspnoea and agitation in their EoL phase. Medication requirements to achieve symptom control varied considerably despite the fact that all patients were opioid naive. Within the last 48 h of life our patients required a mean of 28 mg Morphine Sulphate sub-cutaneous (s/c), as-required (prn) (range 12.5-42.5 mg) for management of dyspnoea and a mean of 28 mg Midazolam (range 12.5-55 mg) s/c, prn for agitation. In contrast, secretions were less prominent in this cohort. Key conclusions: Dyspnoea and terminal agitation were key symptoms experienced by patients with COVD-19 at the EoL. Their symptoms tended to escalate quickly and required careful monitoring to ensure adequate administration of prn medication to maintain symptom control. Obstacles included the need for strict isolation with full Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and the need for staff to minimise contact time as much as possible. The World Health Organization predicts an increase in the proportion of people over 60 by 2050. by 10% . Health problems are noncommunicable diseases. Also, depression caused by poverty and loneliness can aggravate the course of pathological processes.We examined 36 centenarians (people over 90 years old) using methods of prenosological diagnosis. The average age is 91.81 \u00b1 0.26 years, of which 10 are women and 26 are men. All patients underwent the following studies:volumetric sphygmography to determine the stiffness of the vascular wall, peripheral vascular patency by volumetric sphygmography; determination of the adaptive capabilities of the body, vegetative and central regulation, assessment of the energy resources of the body, functional state state by assessing heart rate variability; determination of body weight, body composition in percentage terms, metabolic age using the bioimpedance method.The changes in the functional state and its reserves was identified before the COVID-19 pandemic in our study. Identified changes can be considered as processes, as a result of which regulatory systems are stressed in the absence of complaints and which can lead to a breakdown of adaptation, i.e. pathological process or exacerbation of existing diseases. We plan to conduct these studies again after the pandemic and the lifting of restrictive measures. An assessment will be given of the functional state of the organism, its adaptive capabilities.The data obtained can be useful in predicting measures to reduce epidemiological risks, taking into account the development of probabilistic psychoemotional conditions in the elderly population in territories exposed to adverse biological factors.",

Method: We performed lung ultrasound in a patient with diagnosis of COVID-19 at day 2, day 8 and day 10 to monitor the evolution of the lung lesions and to asses the feasibility of bedside ultrasound in the disease management. Lung scans were performed using a portable ultrasound (PHILIPS-LUMIFY) by two investigators trained in rapid lung ultrasound. Result: Ultrasound images demonstrated the hyperechoic vertical artifacts (B-lines) commonly present in lung interstitial involvement. In case of underlying pneumonia, when there are several B-lines, we can detect the presence of ''curtain sign''. The ultrasound features were often bilateral and the number of B waves has changed according to the progression of the disease. Conclusion: Pulmonary ultrasound is a safe and easy diagnostic instrument to detect unilateral, bilateral, diffuse (curtain sign) B-lines or focal consolidations. In this context, lung ultrasound at the bedside plays an important role.Recognize the typical lung features of SRAS-nCoV- 19 and quickly define the prognosis allows us to deploy the right resources for each patient; it becomes crucial when the available resources are not enough, as happened during this global pandemic.",

It was a patient with no history of interest, independent for the basic activities of daily life and without cognitive impairment. Physical examination revealed crackles in both lung bases, and chest X-rays revealed bilateral infiltrates compatible with COVID. Analytically, unknown pancytopenia stood out: 1730 leukocytes (neutropenia and lymphopenia of 760 in both series), 94, 000 platelets and hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dl. Hematology evaluation was requested, which carried out smears compatible with the infectious process: 45% of the segmented population with reinforced granulation and some hyposegmented forms with some crooks, 44% small lymphocytes and some activated lymphocyte, 11% monocytes with abundant vacuoles. Given these findings, a PCR was performed for SARS-CoV-2, which was positive and entered for respiratory surveillance and analytical control. The patient did not wish to receive compassionate use treatment for COVID-19. After 48 h, she presented a spontaneous analytical improvement with practical recovery of the parameters.",

Plasencia (C\u00e1ceres, Spain) Introduction: We report the first case of COVID-19 at Virgen del Puerto Hospital, Plasencia (C\u00e1ceres, Spain). Methods: Mr. D., an 86-year-old man, had a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, peripheral vertigo and osteoarthritis. He was independent for ADL, with a score of 5 on FAC scale and a score of 2 on Pfeiffer test. He lived alone at home. The patient was admitted to hospital on February 28, 2020, with a subcapital fragility hip fracture. He started with voiding discomfort on March 2 and with fever on March 3. He remains afebrile with antipyretics and he underwent surgery on March 4. Results: Mr. D. continued days after surgery with fever and he began with abdominal discomfort in relation to intestinal pseudoobstruction. On March 6 we started empirical antibiotic treatment. On March 9 we observed pancytopenia and it was described on abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan dolicosigma and incipient consolidations in lower lobes lung. We indicated airborne precautions and, after ruling out other viral infections, we request PCR SARS-CoV-2 on March 10 with positive result. In the following days Mr. D. worsened with respiratory symptoms despite he received treatment with antibiotics, Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Interferon-b and oxygen therapy. Intensive support was dismissed and Mr. D. died on March 18. Key conclusions: COVID-19 is a life-threatening disease with different forms of presentation and that most frequently affects the elderly population. In the case we report fever was present from de beginning but respiratory symptoms were not present until the end.",

Personal history: High blood pressure, moderate high pulmonary pressure, ischemic cardiopathy, diastolic heart failure, chronic renal failure. Treatment with: Adiro, furosemideGeriatric assessment: Institutionalized, widower. Moderate dependency for daily life activities, Barthels index: 45/100. Mild cognitive impairment. Case study: In march is admitted to the acute geriatric ward with a left inferior lobe pneumonia without changes in blood test and a negative swab test for COVID 19 . Chest X-Ray with an extensive left hemithorax condensation with no improvement despite broad spectrum antibiotic (ertapenem). During admission, no changes on imaging and two more swab test came back negative with negative serology for COVID 19 infection. Presented respiratory distress with bronchospasm that subsided with corticosteroid therapy. Given the poor evolution of the patient, a thoracic CT scan was performed; presenting bilateral patched and extensive alveolar occupation with a ground glass pattern compatible with COVID-19.Clinical worsening with low oxygen saturation, with a poor response to rescue treatment, presenting adult respiratory distress syndrome. Chest X-ray: bilateral multilobar condensations. Due to refractory syndrome and progressive worsening palliative care approach was used with end of life stage. Given the high suspicion of COVID 19 infection a post-mortem swab test was made with a positive result. Discussion: The sensitivity of Thoracic CT to diagnose COVID-19 has been reported as high and can predate a positive viral laboratory test, such as the case described. Considering this case at first as a false negative due to clinical and imaging findings with negative laboratory test.",

Atypical manifestations, e.g. other than respiratory symptoms started to be reported. Methods: We reported of a family cluster of atypical clinical manifestations of COVID-19. Results: 84-year-old frail woman was admitted to our geriatric dedicated COVID-19 inpatient ward, due to intractable diarrhea and deconditioning. She was frail and had a long list of comorbidities, such as mild cognitive impairment, chronic skin sores, obesity, falls, arthritis and depression. Prior to the hospitalization, she remained in a rehabilitation center for 2 months, until discharge following a negative swab for SARS-Cov2. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was finally confirmed in the geriatric unit with her mother by naso-pharyngeal and feces RT-PCR assays. Her 57-years-old woman took care of her during the week interval between discharge from rehabilitation and admission in our unit. Her daughter was admitted in neurological inpatient ward 1 week later because of acute isolated left facial nerve palsy. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed in both cases while no major respiratory syndrome was reported. Conclusions: Clinicians should be aware of atypical manifestations due to COVID-19. Data remained poor regarding atypical presentation among older and frail patients. It seems that in a relatively large proportion of these patients, they only experienced minor symptoms. Preventive measures and social isolation of contact-cases are key strategies to arrest the pandemic. These cases will also be helpful for the understanding of pathophysiology of the virus.",

He was admitted with bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia. Analytically, he presented with lymphopenia (600/L), thrombocytopenia (105, 000/L), elevated D-Dimer levels (2015 FEU/mL), elevated ferritin levels (721 microg/L), low sodium levels (132 mEq/ L), worsening of renal function (creatinine 2.14 mg/dL) and elevated CRP levels (134.7 mg/L) with no procalcitonin elevation. He was started on Hydroxicloroquine and antibiotics on admission. On day 11, he suffered a worsening of the respiratory situation, with increasing oxygen necessities. The chest X-Ray performed also showed a worsening of the bilateral reticular pneumonia, with the association of consolidations. Thus, glucocorticoids at high doses were initiated (125 mg/day for 3 days) and Tocilizumab (600 mg) was administered. After said treatment, he gradually improved, both subjectively (dyspnea) and objectively (as shown by Pa/FiO2 evolution and clearing of the bibasilar rales on auscultation). X-Ray improvement was seen on day 17, with resolution of the previously seen consolidations on the right side and a very slight persistence of reticular affectation on the left. Analytically, lymphopenia (900/L), elevated levels of D-Dimer (1563 FEU/mL), elevated ferritin levels (622 microg/L) and slightly elevated CRP levels (1 9mg/dL) persisted, but platelet count, renal function and LDH levels had normalized. 1 First Moscow State Medical University, 2 War Veterans Hospital N3",

Typically, COVID-19 diagnosis is made through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), but results take about 6 h to be available. Methods: For this paperwork, a literature review was undertaken in PubMed and CENTRAL with the terms COVID-19 [MESH] and Radiography [MESH] . Furthermore, radiographic COVID-19 categorization by the British Society Thoracic Imaging is explained and illustrated. Results: Chest tomography is the gold-standard to study lung parenchyma abnormalities. However, it is expensive and timeconsuming. Although CXR is less sensitive, it can demonstrate findings suggestive of COVID-19 such as peripheral and bilateral ground glass opacities. It can also have an important role on risk stratification, distinguishing patients with increased risk for hospital admission and intubation. When the CXR is normal, patients can more confidently have medical release with isolation measures while waiting for the RT-PCR test results. Furthermore, in the geriatric population the differential diagnosis of COVID-19 is extensive. While it is essential to make a good clinical history and physical examination, CXR is able to diagnose other diseases such as cardiac insufficiency, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Conclusion: Chest radiography is useful for both clinicians and patients, has it can detect findings suggestive of COVID-19 as well as other differential diagnosis. In addition, a normal CXR decreases the length of stay in the Emergency Department for those who have mild clinical disease, decreasing the risk of nosocomial infections.",

Sociodemographic, functional, cognitive, comorbidity and laboratory variables were collected. An univariate analysis to identify mortality associated factors was performed. Results: 58 patients were recruited. The median age was 89 (85-92), 69% were women, 65.5% had moderate-severe cognitive impairment and median previous Barthel Index was 35 (0-73.8) . 70.7% were institutionalized. The mortality rate was 41.4%. Factors associated with mortality were Barthel Index \\ 40 (OR = 3.8 [1.2-12.2] ), cognitive impairment (OR = 5 [1-25.3] ), chronic kidney disease (OR = 3.2 [1.1-9 .7]), white blood cells count (p = 0.037), LDH (p = 0.019), procalcitonin [0.5 ng/mL (OR = 3.9 [1.03-15] ) and viral load [100.000 copies/1000 cells (OR = 5.5 [1.4-22.1] ). Key conclusions: Our results suggest that cognitive and functional impairment could be prognostic factors in COVID-19.This strengthens the value of comprehensive geriatric assessment in decision making given a new outbreak. Also, the association observed with bacterial superinfection markers or viral load and mortality could help identify those elderly patients with more potential to benefit from certain treatments like antibiotics or antiviral therapy.",

Methods: Medical literature review from December 1, 2019 to June 17, 2020 of cohort studies including older patients (OP) with COVID-19. The outcome was the patient's vital status (death or alive) upon hospital discharge. Results: Twenty cohort studies selected and compared OP with the outcome at a certain hospital date (censoring bias). Four cohort studies completed the OP hospital follow-up, allowing calculation of the IHM rate. The IMH rate was 26.2% in 65 OP of the Pulmonary hospital in Wuhan [1] , 34.5% in 55 OP of the Zhongnan hospital in Wuhan [2] , 35.3% in 17 OP of the Dabieshan Medical Center in Huanggang [3] and 41 in Wuhan, China (2019) : a single-centered, retrospective study.

As an unknown disease, it lead to a high number of hospitalizations with scarce information on consequences on physical and mental health. The aim of this study was to compose and implement a short and feasible multi domain screening assessment to evaluate hospitalized COVID-19 patients to determine their further needs for adequate care and rehabilitation. Methods: A multidisciplinary expert panel agreed on a fixed combination of existing screening tools, taking into account the necessary hygienic aspects. It was gradually implemented with medical stable inpatients in the University Hospitals Leuven (Belgium) and data were analysed retrospectively. Results: Hand grip strength, timed chair stand test (TCS), Barthel index, swallowing screening, Nutritional Risk Screening 2002, HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) were agreed upon. Preliminary analysis showed that only 6% of the older ([ 70 year) patients were able to perform the TCS within 14 s. Around one third of patients showed significant anxiety or depressive symptoms. 75% had a score of 26 or less on the MoCA. 62% of older patients demonstrated severe functional impairment (Barthel \\ 9). Conclusion: A large majority of hospitalized COVID-19 patients show problems or deficits in either physical, functional or mental domains, demanding adequate therapy and follow up after discharge. Especially the impact on older persons and their strength was striking, implying the need for a good discharge planning with adequate follow-up and evaluating the need for in-or outpatient rehabilitation programs.",

Results: Of the 195 patients analyzed, 50.8% were female, 111 (56.9%) patients had C 65 years (EG) (median age 79 [65; 94]), of which 45% had C 80 years. 84 patients were YM (median age 50 [22; 54] ). EG had multimorbidity: hypertension, diabetes, heart failure and coronary disease (p \\ 0.001). At admission Early Warning Score-2 (p \\ 0.001), c-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, creatinine, anemia and lymphopenia were higher in EG. Median time of hospitalization was higher in EG (14 vs 10 days, p = 0.004). Complications were more common in EG, bacterial infection (56% vs 32%) and acute kidney injury (31 vs 19%) . There were no significant differences in admission to intensive care. There were 18 deaths (mortality 9, 23%), 16 in EG, 13 (81%) among patients aged C 80 years, 2 deaths in YM (p = 0.004). Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) at admission (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.07-1.37, p = 0.021) and CRP above 5 mg/dL (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.13-26.26, p = 0.034) were independent predictors of mortality in EG. Conclusion: EG were at higher risk for complications and had higher mortality. Identification of specific scores of severity for this population, like MEWS at admission and CRP, is essential to ensure that best care is provided to these patients.",

A concise qualitative summary of clinical characteristics, in light of most recently published data, allows for improved understanding, better clinical judgement, and guides efforts towards insufficiently researched aspects of disease. Methods: Qualitative systematic review was performed concerning all articles published from 1st of January to 1st of June 2020, using the keywords COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 followed by the generic terms elderly, older adults or older individuals. Following the extraction of data, summarized findings were then given confidence scores by an adaptation of the STROBE statement and CERQual approach. Results: In total, 1598 articles were screened, of which 20 studies were included in the final analysis, pertaining to 4965 older COVID-19 patients (C 60 years old). Fever, cough, dyspnea, fatigue, and sputum production were the most common symptoms observed. Changes in laboratory findings indicate lymphopenia, inflammation, and occasional organ damage. Renal injury was the most common complication. Roughly 70% of the older adults required supplementary oxygen, while invasive mechanical ventilation was required in almost a third of the patients. Patients with recorded outcome had a mortality rate of 20.0% (907/4531). Confidence in findings varied. Conclusion: Variety in symptom presentation is to be expected, and abnormalities in laboratory findings are present. Risk for mortality is evident, and attention to the need for supplementary oxygen and possible mechanical ventilation is advised. Presented literature may allow for the construction of better predictive models of COVID-19 in older populations. 1 ",

Our primary aim was to assess the prevalence and outcomes of delirium in COVID-19. A recent national delirium audit suggested delirium may be under-diagnosed in frailer individuals. We also assessed the relationship between frailty and delirium recognition. Methods: This was a retrospective observational study of consecutive patients with community or hospital acquired COVID-19 in a Scottish geriatric unit. ''Recognised Delirium'' was identified if delirium or cognitive change was described in medical notes, 'Unrecognised Delirium' if delirium screening suggested delirium but there was no description of cognitive change. Frailty was assessed using the Clinical Frailty Score (CFS) and compared across the three groups: no delirium, recognised delirium, unrecognised delirium. Results: 158 individuals were studied. Average age was 82.5 \u00b1 7.6 years, 61% were female. 67 (42%) had recognised delirium, 23 (15%) unrecognised delirium and 68 (24%) no delirium. Mortality was lower in those with delirium than those without, but the difference was not statistically significant (12 versus 22%, p = 0.099). People with unrecognised delirium had higher mortality than those with recognised delirium (30 versus 6%, p = 0.002). CFS (median, IQR) was 6 (6-7) without delirium, 6 (6-7) with recognised delirium and 7 (6-7) with unrecognised delirium. Conclusions: Delirium is common in COVID-19. The highest mortality was in people with unrecognised delirium. They had a slightly higher frailty score which may have impacted on delirium recognition. Screening for delirium at COVID-19 diagnosis may help improve care for this vulnerable group.",

            "text": "Multidimensional frailty, not chronological age, is associated to outcomes in respiratory diseases: Implications for the COVID- Background: Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, medical professionals around the world are facing a variety of challenges. In some countries it has not been possible to provide all required ventilation therapy due to lack of resources. Difficult decisions had to be made with respect to triaging and chronological age was often used as a criterion. The aim of the present study was to retrospectively assess the clinical characteristics of older patients with respiratory diseases experiencing different outcomes from hospitalization to admission to intensive care unit (ICU), to treatment with non-invasive versus invasive ventilation, to death. Patients and Methods: The patient collective under investigation is based on four prospective studies conducted at the University Hospital of Cologne between 2016 and 2020. A total of 1.276 older multimorbid patients previously recruited in prospective studies in the emergency department (ED), the ICU and the internal acute care unit were screened for the presence of respiratory diseases as main diagnosis (acute or chronic pulmonary disease) as well the availability of data from a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) with prognosis calculation using the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI) at admission. The MPI considers the functional, social, physical and psychological aspects of the patients and provides continuous values between 0 and 1, which can be subdivided into three risk groups for mortality and rehospitalization, MPI-1 (0.00-0.33), MPI-2 (0.34-0.66) and MPI-3 (0.67-1.00). Furthermore, acute respiratory stress syndromes (ARDS), tracheotomies, duration, frequency and cause of ventilation therapy, infections of the respiratory tract and antibiotics/ virustatics were recorded. Results: Of the patients' records screened, 237 (M 146, F 9178.1-5.9 years)met inclusion criteria. Ventilation therapy (V) was received by 46 (19.4% ) of the patients. The patients who received V tended to be chronological younger than non-ventilated patients (NV) (median 76.5 (70-82) vs. 78.0 (75-82) years; p-value 0.073). Patients in the V group were significantly more male than those in the NV group (73.9% vs. 26.1%; p-value 0.039). The mean MPI value at admission was 0.61 (\u00b1 0.20) in V patients and 0.50 (\u00b1 0.17) for NV patients (p \\ 0.001). V patients belonged more often to the MPI-3 than NV patients (41.3% vs. 22 .0%) and less to the MPI-1 group than NV patients (10.9% vs. 20.4%; p = 0.020). V patients' length of hospital stay was significantly longer than in NV patients' (14.0 vs. 9.0 days; p = 0.006) and V patients had a significant higher heartbeat at admission -prior to being ventilated -than NV patients (92.0/min vs. 77.0/ min; p = 0.039). Thirty-seven% of V patients suffered from a hospital acquired pneumonia before they had to be ventilated (16.8% of NV patients; p = 0.003). Conclusion: Despite the retrospective nature of the data, a correlation between MPI and ventilation therapies could be observed in older patients affected by respiratory disease, suggesting that multidimensional frailty as a surrogate marker of biological age is a major determinant of patients trajectories for respiratory outcomes. As ventilated patients were younger than nonventilated patients, biological age appears more predictive than chronological age as far as poor outcomes are concerned in this patient population. Further research is needed to establish meaningful correlations between ventilation therapies and MPI, but multidimensional frailty should be systematically addressed in life-threatening conditions such as the COVID-19 disease in order to meet correct clinical and ethical decisions.",

Given the result of complementary tests, the patient is diagnosed with dysgeusia as a secondary complication of the covid-19 virus. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a new challenge for global health. In this clinical case, the importance of its secondary complications stands out. Coronoviruses not only affect the respiratory system, but also have deleterious effects on the central nervous system. CoV is reported to be found in the brain or cerebrospinal fluid. The pathobiology of these neuroinvasive viruses is fully known.The well-recognized symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, dyspnea, sputum production, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and sore throat.There is growing evidence that olfactory dysfunction can occur in patients with Taste depends on the activity of specialized epithelial cells, the taste cells, which are found mainly in the mucosa of the tongue.The frequency of smell and taste disorders is high (49.8% (95% confidence interval, 8.2-91.5%, I 2 = 99.6%) as other symptoms, so recent Studies indicate that at least anosmia could be included in the symptom lists of COVID-19. Although there is promising evidence, it is premature to conclude that smell and taste disorders are strongly associated with the diagnosis of COVID-19. Multiple cross-sectional studies have shown that the incidence rate of olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients ranges from 33.9 to 68% with a female predominance. The early olfactory recovery rate in recent studies is 44%.Recent findings could show that SARS-CoV-2 could enter taste cells through Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 and as a consequence, the normal functioning of these sensory cells would be disrupted.

The variables were collected: sex, age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI). As risk factors for cardiovascular disease, the presence of hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia was recorded. If the patient suffered from another underlying chronic disease (heart failure, chronic kidney failure, cirrhosis, liver transplantation, oncological disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, bronchiectasis, neurological disease), it was classified as high-risk comorbidity. The date of onset of symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the date of administration of tocilizumab, the dose and the number of administrations were collected. As a primary objective, the variation of the acute phase reactants (CRP, fibrinogen, lymphocytes and D-dimers, before and 5 days after the first dose) were collected. The t-student test was applied for paired samples (p\\0.05). The secondary objectives were the stay in the ICU (days) and the number of deaths. The data were analyzed with the SPSS statistical package. Results: 18 patients were included, 15 men. The mean age was 66.77 years (47-80). The mean BMI was 29.55Kg/m 2 , 27.77% of the patients were obese and 50% suffered from pre-obesity (BMI: 27-29.9). Regarding cardiovascular risk factors, 11 were hypertensive, 5 were diabetic and 10 were dyslipidemic. Six patients had highrisk comorbidity and 4 had no risk factors or comorbidity. The administration of tocilizumab with respect to the onset of symptoms presented a median of 9 days (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) . The mean dose received was 600 mg (4 received 3 doses, 5 patients 2 doses and 9 patients 1 dose.) At 5 days after the first dose, on average, CRP decreased 207.84 95% ], fibrinogen decreased 2.73 95% CI [1.52-3.93 ], and lymphocytes increased 0.311 95% CI [0.12-0.49], all reaching",

The highest mortality is found between 80 and 89 years old. Why do these patients have a higher risk of severe In this review we address potential mechanisms regarding viral transmission, physical reserve and the immune system, increasing the severity of this infection in elderly patients. Observations: First, the spread of COVID-19 may be enhanced in elderly patients. Viral shedding may be increased, and early identification may be complicated due to a typical disease presentation and limited testing capacity. Applying hygiene and quarantine measures, especially in patients with cognitive disorders including dementia, can be challenging. Additionally, elderly patients have a decreased cardiorespiratory reserve and are more likely to have co-morbidity including atherosclerosis, rendering them more susceptible to complications. The aging innate and adaptive immune system is weakened, while there is a pro-inflammatory tendency. The effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the immune system on cytokine production and T-cells, further seem to aggravate this pro-inflammatory tendency, especially in patients with cardiovascular comorbidity, increasing disease severity.Conclusions: The combination of all factors mentioned above contribute to the disease severity of COVID-19 in the older patient. While larger studies of COVID-19 in elderly patients are needed, understanding the factors increasing disease severity may improve care and preventative measures to protect the elderly patient at risk for (severe) COVID-19 in the future.",

            "text": "Introduction: While reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the diagnostic reference standard for COVID-19, the test is limited by high false negative rates and delay in reporting results [1] . Radiology is an essential aid to diagnosis and prognostication [1] . Although computed tomography (CT) is the most sensitive and specific modality [1] , it is limited by increased radiation exposure and issues relating to availability and infection control [2] . While existing studies report relatively poor sensitivity for chest radiography [2, 3, 4] , older patients often present with more advanced lung involvement [1, 3, 4] . The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic utility of baseline chest radiography among older patients with Methods: This retrospective study involved patients over 70 years of age who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-PCR between 27th February and 24th April 2020 at three hospitals in Cork, Ireland. Chest radiography findings were based on the initial radiology report. Results: 69 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. 40 (58%) were male and 29 (42%) were female. The mean age was 80.65. Of the 62 patients who had baseline chest radiography, 9 (14.5%) were radiologically negative while 53 (85.5%) had reported abnormalities consistent with COVID-19. Males (89.2%) were more likely to have abnormal findings than females (80%). 51% had bilateral lung involvement. 24.5% had only right-sided involvement. 24.5% had only left-sided involvement. 75.5% had predominantly mid-lower zone involvement. 3.8% had only upper zone involvement. 20.7% involved both upper and lower zones. Key Conclusions: Baseline chest radiography is a useful tool for diagnosing COVID-19 among older patients. The recognition and characterization of the frail older adults is essential in Covid-19's fight strategies. They are critical to develop a special plan for geriatric care due to the high vulnerability and preexisting health conditions of this group. The ''shared decision making'' with the patient and family is particularly important in this context. Within a Project of integrated assistance to older people at risk of functional decline in the COVID-19 pandemic in Belo Horizonte, a cross-sectional this study was carried out with the aim of identifying fragile older people and broadening the understanding of preferences, care models in this group. In the quantitative step, the self-administered questionnaire with easy access and understanding made available on electronic means applied to 410 older adults was used. Three hundred eighty one was recruited to this study. In the qualitative step, 50 older adults participated in semi-structured interviews by videoconference, telephone call or presential encounters. Specialized care for the older adults involves appropriate communication strategies, shared decisions and prognosis definitions. Understanding the specificities of this group and anticipating advance directives can mitigate the overload in emergency care and intensive care units.

To reduce the risk of spread of infection many outpatient clinics in the NHS hospitals across the UK, have been cancelled/postponed, and a follow up alternative has to be found. An attractive alternative is telemedicine; a virtual clinic as a telephone or video consultations. The advantages and disadvantages of the virtual clinic and when it can and cannot be used in older people will be briefly discussed. The lists are not exhaustive, but represent general and broad outlines and consideration to guide practice and decision-making. Virtual clinics can be used to:",

Rosters were adjusted and meetings conducted virtually to minimize staff contact.Infrastructural: A ward equipped for isolation of COVID-19 cases was added, and necessary personal protective equipment supplied. Staff was split into COVID- to prevent cross infection. Results: Staff felt prepared to confront the pandemic before the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak in Malta. Suspension of admissions until a safe pathway was created decreased the number of positive patients. The few cases of COVID-19 positive patients were quickly identified and isolated, without spread within wards. Staff shortages due to mandatory quarantine presented significant challenges which were overcome with good team-work and planning. Despite the staff shortages and restrictions patient rehabilitation was achieved. Conclusion: Thorough planning, safe practice, and a willingness to adapt to challenges lead to the successful management and containment on COVID-19 cases, while maintain a rehabilitation in-patient service.",

We assessed hospital trainees' concerns, perceived sufficiency of information, behaviour and reported psychological health during the COVID 19 pandemic. Method: Between May 1st and 23rd 2020, 204 trainees of an NHS Foundation trust completed a questionnaire regarding worries and concerns about the new COVID19 pandemic. Results: 92% looked after COVID19 patients. 92% were worried about COVID19; the most frequent concern was that of family and friends dying from COVID19 (75%). 22% reported infection with COVID19. 7% of trainees were so concerned about COVID19 infection that they would avoid going to work. Perceived sufficiency of information about COVID19 was moderately high. 26% reported that they were able to socially distance at work compared to 94% able to socially distance outside work. 42% reported that their psychological health had been affected by their work with the commonest being anxiety (57%), emotional distress (51%) and burnout (38%). 96% think it is important to have a service that provides psychological support during this pandemic; only 62% would consider its use at work. Conclusions: A significant proportion of hospital trainees are worried about the COVID19 pandemic with high levels of reported psychological distress. Given that almost a third would not use psychological support services at work, hospital leaders and liaison psychiatry need to explore the reasons for not wanting to use services at work and consider providing psychological services outside work.",

            "text": "Rationale: COVID-19 entered Belgium in the beginning of March 2020 and resulted in organization of hospital surge capacity to accommodate COVID-patients. Nursing homes (NH) in Belgium closed their doors for visitors on March 17th, 2020. With the focus on hospital COVID-management, the situation in nursing homes remained under the radar until COVID-outbreaks and deaths were increasingly reported from the end of March on. By the end of May more COVID-related deaths have occurred in nursing homes (n = 4742) than in hospitals (n = 4488).This Abstract reports the goals and results of the rapid response network for COVID-19 management in nursing homes (RRNWNH), initiated in the beginning of April 2020 in the Leuven region, Belgium. Methods: The RRNWNH consisted of 3 main partners: hospitals (n = 2), NH management (n = 58) and coordinating general practitioners (CGP's) of NH (n = 58). A steering committee of hospital nursing directors (n = 2), geriatricians (n = 3), CGP's (n = 4) and clinical process managers (n = 4) coordinated actions in the RRNWNH. These actions consisted of creating a website, monitoring tool and an intervention and follow-up log tool for the RRNWNH partners, a hotline for CGP's, an on demand outreach Nose Throat Ear physician swabteam, educational webinars and intervisions with NH, onsite medical and infection control advice, secondment of hospital nurses and PPE purchase/exchange. Results: Weekly online meetings were set up with the partners of the RRNWNH and the steering committee to discuss COVID-outbreaks and actions. The website offers NH all necessary contact information and links to educational material and network reports. The monitoring tool was used by 31 NH (1 -33 registrations per NH) depicting COVID-cases and mortality in residents and health care workers (HCW), HCW absence and personal protective equipment (PPE) needs. The intervention and follow-up log tool allowed to communicate and coordinate interventions in the different NH's. This allowed medical (geriatricians and CGPs) and infection control advice by advanced clinical practice nurses on site. CGP's contacted geriatricians, gerontopsychiatrists, palliative care physicians and hospital epidemiologists also via the hotline for specific urgent matters. The swabteam screened 1337 residents and 1534 HCW in 16 NH with COVID-outbreaks. Weekly infection control webinars were followed by \u00b1 20 NH. 27 hospital nurses worked 118 shifts in 7 NH with HCW shortage due to COVID-outbreaks. FFP2 sterilization and apron purchase was centralized for several NH. Conclusion: Our RRNWNH was perceived as an urgent need and added value for a vulnerable sector in this COVID crisis. The network enabled the detection of COVID-related problems in NH, prioritization of and response to specific medical, infection control, educational, staffing and material needs. The RRNWNH forms the basis for a more preventive approach in the future and for the development of a long-lasting integrated care network between the partners involved.",

We present a review of such deaths from geriatric wards in a district general hospital between 15th March and 30th April 2020. Method: Structured judgement reviews were retrospectively completed for 18 patients using physical and electronic records. Avoidability of death and care quality were graded using the 'Avoidability of Death Judgement Score' and 'NCEPOD Classification of Care' [3, 4] . Results: The mortality rate was greater for patients with, compared to those without, . The mode avoidability score was 6 (range 5-6). All patients had an appropriate treatment escalation plan. Sixteen were recognised as 'end of life' (EoL) and received anticipatory medications. 37.5% were not referred to palliative care due to rapid deterioration. Those that were, received anticipatory medications more proactively (80% versus 62.5%), and fewer continued 'active management' (40% versus 75%). Next of kin were regularly updated in 15 cases (83.3%) with facilitated video calls. In six cases, ward moves led to reduced quality of care, namely miscommunication of target oxygen saturations and care shifting from comfort prioritisation. Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards were submitted for only 27.3% of patients that lacked capacity. Conclusions: Our review demonstrates a high standard of EoL care provided in uncertain times. Early involvement of the multidisciplinary team improved care, whereas inter-ward transfers tended to detract from this. Greater detail will be available in our final presentation.

However data regarding the prognostic role of the LUS in nursing home residents, one of the most affected populations by COVID-19, are not still available. Methods: Nursing home residents were followed-up with a LUS from 08th April to 14th May 2020 in Chioggia, Venice. COVID-19 was diagnosed through a nasopharyngeal swab. LUS results were scored according to previous works on COVID-19 pneumonia using a 12-zone method, with a score from 0 to 12, higher scores reflecting more pneumonia severity. Mortality was assessed using administrative data. Data regarding accuracy (and related parameters) were then reported. Results: Over 175 nursing home residents, 48 (mean age: 84.1 years; 39 females) were affected by COVID-19, with 12 died during the follow-up period. The mean LUS score was 3. The area under the curve of LUS in predicting mortality was 0.603 (95% confidence intervals: 0.419-0.787). Taking score[4, the sensitivity in predicting mortality was 58.33%, specificity 63.89%, a positive likelihood ratio of 1.62 and a negative of 0.65. Conclusions: LUS is able to significantly predict mortality in nursing home residents affected by  indicating that this simple tool can be routinely used in this setting instead of more invasive techniques available only in hospital.",

We aimed to assess perspectives of hospital doctors in training on social distancing and solutions for their workplace in hospital.Between 1st and 23rd of May 2020, trainees at a UK NHS foundation trust were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding social distancing and perceived solutions for the workplace.204 trainees responded. 60% were female with 37% of respondents being Specialist Registrars. 26% reported that they socially distanced themselves at work compared to 94% socially distancing themselves outside work. The commonest reasons for not socially distancing at work were stated as ''unable to socially distance during ward rounds'' (72%) and ''unable to socially distance during board rounds due to the size of the room'' (68%). Options suggested to enable social distancing at work include larger offices (85%), more computers (76%), larger recreational spaces (62%), EPR access at home (49%) and remote ward rounds (38%).With the ongoing pandemic, social distancing measures are likely to be required for some time. It is therefore important that healthcare leaders consider potential solutions offered by their staff as part of measures at work to reduce the spread of coronavirus in healthcare settings.",

This raises concerns about the mental health and wellbeing of Healthcare workers (HCWs) caring for patients with COVID19. We aimed to assess HCWs concerns, perceived sufficiency of information and reported psychological health during COVID19. Between 1st and 31st May 2020; 410 HCWs of an NHS Trust completed a questionnaire regarding concerns, perceived sufficiency of information and reported psychological health during the COVID19 pandemic.There was a preponderance of females (307) with hospital doctors in training (HD) (204), nurses and health care assistants (NHCAs) (125) and Allied health professionals (AHPs) (81).The majority of HCWs had looked after COVID19 patients; HD 92%, NHCAs 79%, AHP 77%. The most frequent concerns across all HCW staff groups was that of family and friends dying from COVID19, family and friends being infected with COVID19 and being infected with COVID19 and transmitting it to family and friends. HCWs were less worried about themselves dying from COVID19; HD 22%, NHCAs 35%, AHP 25%.The most frequent reported psychological health concerns amongst the 3 staff groups were anxiety, emotional distress, burnout and depression.HCWs experienced high levels of anxiety about the pandemic with their degree of worry mainly pertaining to the health of their family and friends. It is therefore important for hospital leaders to focus on wellbeing programmes for HCWs, their families and friends to ensure that they can function at a high level in the workplace in times of extreme distress during pandemics.",

The aim of the operationalization of special cohort units was fourfold: the protection of residents and caregivers in nursing homes, prevention of an overcapacity in regional hospitals, providing optimal and more specialized care for COVID-19 positive residents of whom the health status deteriorates and who declared having no willingness for hospital admission and reducing the workload and anxiety among caregivers in nursing homes.From the early stage on of the pandemic, residents from a consortium of six nursing homes (580 residents) who were diagnosed as COVID-19 positive were allocated to one special cohort ward at one location. On the other hand older COVID-19 positive hospitalized patients who could not return to the home setting, could be discharged towards this special cohort unit as long as isolation was required. To realize this approach, four essential conditions needed to be fulfilled: direct availability of the right infrastructure according to the principles of barrier nursing, featuring a source for protection materials, the presence of a competent team of experts and caregivers, and finally no-impact policy on other care departments in the nursing homes or the hospital. A strong collaboration between the consortium, the regional hospital and primary care practitioners made the implementation successful and prevented a further outbreak of COVID-19 in the nursing homes. Important insights and challenges for shared clinical primary and secondary care for older adults were gained.",

All identified themes were connected to participants' narratives about being isolated with no contact to close relatives or carers. The co-creation during data collection, consisting of ongoing conversations and questioning of the older patients, was challenged several times because the interviews had to be interrupted or shortened due to ethical considerations regarding the individual person's needs and conditions. Conclusions: Our study provided in-depth knowledge about how older patients experienced hospitalization during the COVID-19 pandemic in a Danish hospital. The results emphasize that compassionate care includes a willingness to listen to patients' narratives and to imagine life as the older patient depicts it, which can lead to a better understanding of the individual person's needs, and increase compassionate caring.",

As patients arrive on the Nightingale Manchester wards they are all exhausted, wary or indeed scared and for some it is even more upsetting. Staring into their eyes you observe a blankness that I have only witnessed before in those who have undergone prolonged cancer treatment or indeed in the eyes of those escaping war zones in low income countries. Still alive the spark of life has disappeared. The look has been described as 'soul death'. Soul death is allowing the sufferers to block out painful memories as a means of protection, allowing a perfusing numbness, an all consuming desire to sleep and be unaware of the world around.The scared, afraid and confused we can reassure, comfort and calm and indeed distract at times of added stress but for those with that scary and somehow inhuman blank stare or who just continuously appear asleep, the challenge for the caring team is how to rekindle that spark. The Family Liaison Team at the Manchester Nightingale covid hospital was established to facilitate communication between families and their medically isolated loved ones, but their role has become fundamental to the rehabilitation of elderly covid patients. Rehabilitation is dependent upon a desire to recover, a desire to re-engage with the world, a desire to live.",

Given the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, we investigated the effects of ward moves on elderly patient outcomes during this pandemic. Methods: Data was collected from electronic records of all patients admitted onto the Care Of The Older Person (COOP) unit between 15/03 and 30/04 in 2019 and 2020 . All ward moves from the emergency department onwards were counted. We classified 1 to 2 moves as 'low', and 3 or more moves as 'high'. Admissions were classified as COVID-19 positive based on high clinical suspicion or swab result. Admissions resulting in death were excluded from LOS analysis. Results: Between 15/03 and 30/04/2020, there were 269 admissions of which 164/269 (61.0%) were COVID-19 positive. Mean LOS in COVID-19 positive admissions was longer than in negative admissions (12.5 vs. 8.0 days). In 2019 there were 219 admissions with a mean LOS of 9.0 days. 'High' ward moves correlated with increased mortality compared to 'low' ward moves in COVID-19 positive (28.6% vs. 21.3%), and negative admissions (18.8% vs. 11.2%). Comparatively, in 2019, 'high' ward moves correlated with increased mortality from 9.9% to 11.8%.Longer LOS also correlated with 'high' ward moves in both COVID-19 positive (10.7 vs. 14.5 days) and negative admissions (7.4 vs. 13.1 days). Conclusion: COVID-19 admissions had a longer average LOS and increased in-patient mortality than the same time period in 2019.

All patients who were actively treated and required oxygen support were started on Lopinavir/Ritonavir and/or Toclizumab. 5 patients who received Hydroxychloroquine (55.5%) had prolonged QT intervals. 1 patient who received antiviral treatment died. 17 patients received Geriatric co-management, and 8 were transferred to the Geriatrics ward for further management. Key conclusions: There was no consistent management plan delivered to our patients. Prognostication is important in determining treatment goals and outcomes.

Significant lack of contact with families can increase feelings of loneliness and anxiety among nursing home residents. The aim of this study is to present methods of providing contact between residents and their relatives during this isolation. Methods: Our study took place in the polish nursing home for the elderly. 88 residents were constantly assessed by a geriatrician and a psychologist from the beginning of quarantine up to 30th of May. Based on its assessment we planned a therapeutic strategy for the time of expected lockdown. Results: Severely restricting family visits was the most painful effect of the quarantine reported by the residents. 45% of them reported an intense longing for relatives. 34% of all residents needed additional pharmacological intervention due to increased agitation, insomnia, or depressiveness. We implemented the following strategies to maintain the contact between residents and their relatives: smartphone/tablet videoconferences, meetings through the window, memory books prepared by the families, support lists from families, video wishes for relatives, 'hug-time' screen, and safe outdoor meeting space. We are still in the process of assessing the effectiveness of these methods. Key conclusions: There are multiple effective methods that can be used to provide contact between residents and their families even if visits in the nursing home are not allowed. Smartphone videoconferences and meeting through the window were not effective because of vision and hearing limitations.",

Due to the nature of rotating medical teams and rapidly evolving guidance, this project enabled the team to work cohesively and optimally during such unprecedented times. A semi-structured survey was undertaken with feedback gathered from 20 members of staff on a designated covid ward including doctors, nurses, clinical support workers, and domestic staff. A 'Lessons Learned Log' was also created over a week to understand the pressures and issues faced by the team in order to put into place relevant support strategies swiftly. Responses from the survey were subsequently analysed into thematic headings. This initiative highlighted that communication about changes in Covid-19 guidance was crucial in allaying anxieties of the team. Notice about wards becoming designated covid areas despite rapid turnover of patients enabled staff to prepare themselves psychologically. Debrief sessions after deaths of patients also helped with the distress experienced by staff. Key strategies were discussed in the daily safety huddle with input from relevant specialties such as palliative care and liaison psychiatry to further enhance patient care. This project has led to a robust system in place to support staff on covid wards to care confidently and compassionately for elderly patients with covid-19.",

The aim of our study is to examine frailty, using Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), its association with inpatient management and outcomes in Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of older adults aged above 65, diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, treated in the UMMC, where we compared patients with CFS 1-5 (non-frail to mildly frail) (n = 14) against those with CFS 6-8 (moderate to severely frail) (n = 12). Results: As of April 2020, we have total 26 hospitalised older adults. The mean age was 82 6 in patients with CFS 6-8, which was significantly higher than those with ; p = 0.000]. Overall 58% of those with CFS 6-8 (n = 7) presented from institutional care setting. Almost half of those with increasing frailty presented with pneumonia requiring oxygen. Our data revealed that all of those with CFS 6-8 were co-managed by geriatric care (p = 0.001) and potentially managed to get their care planned in advanced (p = 007) with non-active resuscitation order issued in time (p = 0.00). Those with CFS 1-5 were more likely to receive critical care (p = 0.017) and antiviral therapy (p = 0.000). Inpatient mortality was higher with increasing frailty, with total 5 out of 6 death were reported in those with CFS 6-8. The median length of hospital stay was 27 , which was the same between the CFS categories, p = 0.695. Our data revealed worsening physical health status in both categories. Conclusion: Frailty is an important component of COVID-19 management. There are guidelines that guide management but adherence to it requires individualised decision making.",

A telephone line was set up operating everyday 08:00-21:00. It was staffed by geriatricians and the focus was on advance care planning, admissions avoidance and delivering community-based treatment. Methods: Electronic patient records were reviewed from 21st April to 29th May 2020. Data was collected retrospectively from 28 weekdays including the timing and source of the call, details of advance care plans and outcomes for the patients. Results: Data was collected from 160 patients. The average age of patients was 85 years. 15% of those who were tested were positive for COVID-19. In terms of advanced care planning, 43% of all calls had preferred place of care (PPOC) and 27% had resuscitation status discussed. Whilst the majority of calls came from GPs, 11% of calls came from community matrons, 5% from paramedics and there were a variety of other users. Key conclusions: The data showed there was a need for supporting colleagues to help fulfil a person's wish to remain at home and to access the most appropriate hospital service when a decision was made to admit.

Methods: Data was collected from the Irish Hip Fracture Database (IHFD) and UHL Patient Administration System from March 1st until May 1st 2020. It was compared with data from the same timeframe in 2019. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. Results: Demographic characteristics were comparable between both cohorts. The average length of stay (LOS) was 8 days compared to 15 days in 2019. This was primarily due to changes in hospital policy and an increased onus to discharge patients during the Covid-19 crisis. Strikingly the inpatient mortality rate at 30 days during the Covid-19 period was 13.4% (n = 7) compared to just 1.7% (n = 1) in 2019. Subsequent analysis from the 2019 data however unearthed a 60 day mortality rate of 25%. This would suggest that subsequent analysis of mortality rates from 2020 will increase further. Readmission rates are also higher during the current pandemic with 10.5% of patients requiring readmission within 30 days compared to 5% at 30 days in 2019. Interestingly 10 patients were admitted from nursing homes compared to just two patients in 2019. Conclusion: Increased demand for beds during Covid-19 crisis led to earlier discharge from our institution. Provisional analysis suggests this subsequently increased both readmission and mortality rates.",

An interactive, videoconference-facilitated education series was commenced to provide up-to-date guidance to nursing homes through a collaboration between Geriatrics Department, Tallaght University Hospital, Dublin and the All-Ireland Institute of Hospice and Palliative Care. The format was a brief didactic lecture but primarily focused on Q and A designed to address the COVID issues of the week. The first session, ''Anticipatory Prescribing'' was viewed by 300 nursing home healthcare workers and GPs. Attendances rose with COVID case rates to 550 mid-pandemic. At submission, eight COVID lectures were attended by a mean of 330 nursing homesrelated staff. Topics covered include a microbiologist's and then a respiratory consultant perspective on COVID, advance care planning, outbreak management and as the pandemic weaned; nutritional and swallow challenges in COVID, IT solutions to isolation/rehabilitation and then reopening nursing homes. Each week registrants were requested to input their ''burning issue'', which was addressed through Q and A. Using word-cloud software the primary issues in March, pre-pandemic, were end of life care, anticipatory medication stocks and syringe drivers. In April, mid-pandemic, the issues were PPE, managing COVID and Family. In late May, post-pandemic, focus changed to rehabilitation, isolation, re-accessing services. This lecture series was very well attended, provides a curriculum and highlights the success of videoconference lectures. Through question submission we provide a summary of the primary nursing home issues at differing time-points in a pandemic, albeit influenced by the lecture topic.",

Due to its characteristics (advanced age, functional and mental difficulty, comorbidities ...), the consequences of both the disease and the problems derived from confinement itself secondary to social isolation, immobility and the anxiety generated are especially important. Multidisciplinary management is necessary to prevent these complitations. Methods: Narrative review of Management was performance by the authors in order to make recomendatios to the nursing home in our clinical area. Results: 16 recommendations were done by the groups. These are relative to medical follow-up (with analytics and radiography), anticoagulant and corticoids management, screening of functional and cognitive decline, malnutrition, delirium, anxiety, depression and polipharmafacy. For of all these problem, practical advice (based on exercise with Vivifrail, cognitivie stimulation, nutrition with suplement prescripcion, management polypharmacy with STOP-START criteria, management frecuent comorbilitis such hypertension, diabetes; reduccing risk of falling and coordination between primary care and geriatrics) were recommended in order to improve residents health status Conclusion: After the first wave of COVID pandemic, management of residents in nursing homes is still a big challenge. Practical recommendations are the base to improve residents management. (2) we are working on a ,,Guideline on Best Practice in geriatric rehabilitation''.

Introduction: The risk associated with COVID-19 infection is considered to be moderate to high among those interacting indoors, particularly older people. As a result, they refrain from accessing various services including nursing homes. In order to overcome this barrier to access and create a safer environment for care professionals, a nursing home in Tokyo adopted isolation measures to reduce the frequency of contact. In a nursing facility in Tokyo, a remotely controlled infrared monitoring system was introduced, and its impact and effectiveness were tested. 2. Methods: A monitoring system was set up for 38 older adults, and changes in the frequency of visiting the room and the workload of care professionals were compared before and after the introduction of the devices. 3. Results: The monitoring system decreased the frequency of room visits by care staff at night from 22.9 to 10.9 times, as it provided the visual information about the residents' status quo remotely. The system allowed the facility to welcome five potentially Covid19 infected residents as a result. The fatigue level of night-shift care staff also showed a decrease. A remarkable effect was found particularly towards the end of their shifts when fatigue levels reach the highest. 4. Key conclusions: The remote monitoring system decreased the physical and mental burden on care staff by reducing the frequency of their visit to residents' rooms at night. The system can be highly effective in tackling the challenge of Covid19 by mitigating the barrier to people's access to care home facilities. This study was in part supported by the Japan Keirin Autorace Foundation. We would like to acknowledge the support and dedication of care professionals.",

Case Presentation: The patient was an 88-year old lady who was a known case of diabetes mellitus, obesity, asthma, hypertension, hip fracture and congestive heart failure who experienced sore throat. All her parameters were normal and she was never febrile. A COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab was positive. Management: The management of this patient required a holistic approach from all the teams within the facility in order to treat the patient as well as contain the spread of COVID-19 within a vulnerable population. The measures which were enacted in a timely fashion before the case of COVID-19 was registered in the facility were effective in containing the spread. These included the thermal screening of all staff entering the facility, all elective appointments outside the facility were postponed, contact tracing of staff and low threshold for swabbing for staff and patients. To date only one resident contracted COVID-19 from the entire facility. Immediate action was undertaken for medical isolation of the patient and was nursed in another ward catered for residents with COVID-19 within the facility and made an uneventful recovery.",

Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many nursing homes to prohibit resident visits to prevent viral spread. The perceptions of family members and friends of the nursing home residents is not clear if the potential detrimental effects of isolating residents outweigh the protective effects, and what does the social network view as important during and after the COVID-19 nursing home restrictions. The aim of this study was to capture these perspectives from the social network of nursing home residents. Methods: In this cross-sectional observational study, family members and friends of nursing home residents were asked to fill in an online survey about COVID-19 nursing home restrictions. A total of 1997 were included in data analyses. Results: Satisfaction of communication access to nursing home residents was highest when respondents had the opportunity to stay in touch with nursing home residents by nurses informing them via telephone, visits behind glass, and visits outside maintain physical distance. Respondents were concerned that nursing home residents had increased loneliness (76%), sadness (66%), and decreased QOL (62%) while study respondents reported personal sadness (73%) and fear (26%). Overall, 40% of the respondents found the adverse effects of the visiting restrictions outweighed the protective effect for nursing home residents. Respondents expressed the need for increased information, communication options, and better safety protocols. Conclusion: Both nursing home residents and relatives experienced adverse psychological effects because of COVID-19 visiting restrictions. The psychological symptoms and unmet needs of nursing home residents and informal caregivers should be addressed in health policy. ",

Introduction: COVID-19 pandemia imposed restrictions in the visit routines of hospitalized older patients, which were though to negatively impact the psychological health of patients and their families. A Family Communication Service (FCS), facilitated by volunteer medical students, was implemented in the Geriatric Department of University Hospital in Nancy, France, to attenuate those consequences. We aimed to evaluate student's experience from their participation. Methods: Seventeen undergraduate medical students received dedicated training on their mission's outline and on Hygiene rules by both Faculty and Hospital and were equipped with the necessary infrastructure to organize calls and regulated personal objects exchanges between older patients and their families for 1 month (20/4-20/5/ 2020). Finally, an anonymized questionnaire was answered (M = 15). Results: In total, 258 actions took place: 119 students-family phonecalls (actions' organization), 94 patient-family video-calls, 24 patientfamily phone-calls and 22 objects' exchanges. Students reported an 8.8/10 satisfaction degree on the global functioning of the FCS and a 9/10 level of recommendation of the FCS to their peers. Predominant were positive reports on the amelioration of their communication skills with older vulnerable patients (with complex conditions), their families, the geriatric team and their peer students. Working in autonomy and experiencing the human aspect of the doctor-patient relationship, beyond medical conditions, discovering the patient's point of view and their family context were estimated as valuable experiences for their vision of the medical profession. Key conclusions: Active involvement of undergraduate medical students in activities beyond strict medical duties can be an enriching experience for themselves and their curricula.

Fifteen students answered the questionnaire (88.2%). There were strongly perceived important psychological benefits for the patients (psychological comfort, reassurance, joy, elimination of the feeling of abandonment, mood boosting, beneficial contact with young students) and their families (reassurance, serenity, joy, de-stress), who managed to maintain the affective connection and warmly expressed their gratitude. Geriatric teams welcomed being offloaded and reported facilitation to their care duties also by patients' mood amelioration. Visual contact by video-calls was considered an added value and it was suggested to be continued out of the crisis context, along with the recreational occupation for older patients. Key conclusions: The FCS resulted to be beneficial for older hospitalized patients, their families and the medical/paramedical stuff. Scaling up of some of its aspects merit consideration.",

Covid-19 pandemic brought mandatory changes into the healthcare institutions, where patients' safety circuits were organized. Methods: This is a descriptive-observational study of patients with heart conditions (heart failure and acute myocardial infarction), admitted in a cardiac ICU in a Portuguese University Hospital. All the patients were admitted to the emergency department (ED) due to a cardiac event. As SARS-CoV-2 tests were not always available at the ED, patients were transferred to a coronary ICU with six single bedrooms where patients were monitored and stabilized. In contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 test was meanwhile performed. If tests were negative, patients were transferred to a five-bed ICU or a cardiology ward. If tests were positive, patients were transferred to a cardiology ward or ICU in a dedicated Covid-19 building in another area. Results: Between April and June of 2020, among a total of 406 patients admitted in the ICU, only one asymptomatic patient tested positive to SARS-CoV-2, who was then transferred to Covid-19 coronary facility. Seventy-six (19%) patients were transferred to the five-bed ICU, 326 (80%) were transferred to the cardiology ward, and four patients died due to cardiac problems. During this period, none of the healthcare providers got infected by SARS-CoV-2.

We responded by rapid service redesign to enhance capacity to assess and treat individuals whilst avoiding or minimising hospital exposure. This needed hospital, community and social care to share information, decisions and ongoing care and supervision without the patient moving about. Methods: Plan-Do-Study-Act method was used to rapidly test, refine and implement service redesign. Changes included procedures for accessing services, reducing duplication of assessments, changing the scope and routines for health professionals, and incorporating volunteer support. Results: Use of the new Clinical Frailty Scale App plus digital application were upskilled staff enabling each provider to preform and share expert assessments of frail people, improving quality and saving time. Primary care data interoperability and access to health and care system capacity report were authorised. A multiagency rapid access virtual clinic enabled quicker responses, sharing of these assessments and agreeing care plans without patients attending hospital. A Frailty Clinical Navigator was introduced in a COVID dedicated and non-COVID Emergency Department (ED). Discharge medications and equipment delivery were supported by voluntary sector. Key conclusion: Integrated working between health, social and voluntary services is imperative to deliver the right care at the right time. Frailty specific innovative roles need to be further explored creating more workforce flexibility and sustainability. Data interoperability must be prioritised.",

At the onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic ILS rapidly reconfigured to relieve pressure on the acute hospitals. For ILS staff to safely support medicines use, training is usually delivered in small groups and competence assessed in patients' homes. To minimise patient and staff risk of potential exposure to COVID-19 new training and assessment were developed to up skill redeployed staff (nursing assistants and rehabilitation support workers), the outcomes of which are described. Methods: Two face to face training sessions were consolidated into one, and three simulated Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCE) assessments of medicines administration were developed to replace two supervised medication administration competency assessments. Labelled medicines were obtained from King's College London's (KCL), and their facilities utilised to allow physical distancing. Results: Over two days, training was delivered to 33 staff, and OSCEs completed by 18 candidates; no candidate passed. 78% made a clinical decision outside of their scope of practice, 56% administered an incorrect dose, and 66% administered an expired medication. The majority of candidates followed the correct procedure when medication was refused (78%). Key conclusions: OSCEs were a useful educational tool where candidates can be objectively observed without intervention, and direct feedback on errors provided. Additional training on the handling and administration of medicines was required for all candidates. Training and OSCEs will be redesigned to meet the needs identified.

COVID-19 infection was diagnosed by PCR and specific treatment was established with lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine and ceftriaxone. The patient presented torpid evolution, needing intravenous corticosteroid and oxygen therapy at high flows to maintain adequate saturations. Given the lack of improvement, tocilizumab was administered in a single dose, after 48 h of the same became a favorable evolution, being able to decrease the flows of oxygen therapy and improving auscultation. The patient discharged at home with oxygen therapy in 2-liter nasal glasses per minute. Conclusions: Tocilizumab may be a potential treatment in severe and critical cases of patients with COVID-19 due to its mechanism of action by interrupting the release of cytokines, however, it is necessary to carry out controlled clinical trials that evaluate the safety and efficacy of this drug for this indication. To address this problem, we aimed to explore the suitability and feasibility of telemedicine service for our community hospitalist group and understand its limitations in a pilot study. Methods: Four remote hospitalists performed ten telemedicine encounters each onadmitted patients (n = 40 total encounters). The patient population consisted of adult acute hospital admissions along with geriatric and adult psychiatry inpatients. Hospitalists situated themselves in our hospitalist office for the purposes of this pilot. Remote hospitalists partnered with a ''telepresenter'' who is also a hospitalist in our group. The telepresenter hospitalist mobilized the 2-way audio-visual telemedicine cart into the patient room and assisted with performing a physical exam. At completion, all 4 hospitalists were qualitatively interviewed individually and their interviews analyzed to evaluate their experience. Results: Remote hospitalists were satisfied with their ability to evaluate and communicate with patients using telemedicine. They felt confident knowing that the physical exam was performed by a hospitalist colleague, a ''telepresenter.'' The 2-way audio-visual experience was seamless. As noted by our remote hospitalists, patients found the encounter to be positive and enjoyed continuity of care. Limitations include the rapid response and late call workflow for which back-up systems will need to be implemented. A 5-h moonlighting telepresenter shift will need to be staffed. AimIt is apparent that the SARS-COV-2 virus disproportionately affects the older population and it has been anecdotally reported that COVID-19 presents atypically in this cohort. This can cause difficulty in identifying, treating, and appropriately isolating these patients. This project was therefore undertaken to describe and quantify clinical presentations of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the older population. MethodThis was a retrospective cohort study of 50 patients who had PCR confirmed COVID-19 between April 1st 2020 and April 27th 2020 and were over the age of 80. 9 patients were excluded who had been tested routinely and did not have symptoms that triggered testing or who initially tested positive elsewhere. Symptoms at presentation were analysed and delirium during admission and clinical frailty scores were also assessed. ResultsOf the 41 patients, the majority did not present with symptoms consistent with WHO case definition of COVID-19. Although respiratory symptoms were the most common presenting complaint (29%), most patients presented atypically with a fall (20%), delirium (15%), GI symptoms (12%) or asymptomatically (12% Background: This study aimed to assess the contribution of asymptomatic and presymptomatic residents and staff in SARS-CoV-2 transmission during a large outbreak in a Dutch nursing home. Methods: Observational study in a 185-bed nursing home with two consecutive testing strategies: testing of symptomatic cases only, and weekly facility wide testing of staff and residents regardless of symptoms. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal testing with RT PCR for SARs-CoV-2 was conducted with a standardized symptom assessment. Positive samples with a cycle threshold (CT) value below 32 were selected for sequencing. Results: 185 residents and 244 staff participated. Sequencing identified one cluster. In the symptom-based test strategy period 3/39 residents were presymptomatic compared to 38/74 residents in the period of weekly facility-wide testing (p-value\\ 0.001). In total, 51/59 (91.1%) of SARS-CoV-2 positive staff was symptomatic, with no difference between the two testing strategies (p-value 0.763). Loss of smell and taste, a sore throat, headache or myalga was hardly reported in residents compared to staff (p-value \\ 0.001). Median Ctvalue of presymptomatic residents was 21.3, which did not differ from symptomatic (20.8) or asymptomatic (20.5) residents (p-value 0.624).",

Unsupervised time series clustering of symptom development was performed on data collected from a training dataset of completed cases enlisted early from the COVID Symptom Study Smartphone application, yielding six distinct symptom presentations (n = 1653). Clustering was validated on an independent replication dataset (n = 1047). Individuals assigned to differing symptom clusters showed differences in the subsequent need for respiratory support in hospital, with risk escalating from 1.5% in cluster 1 ('flu like with no fever) to 19.8% in cluster 6 (Severe level 3: Abdominal and Respiratory). Moreover, older, frailer (PRISMA7) individuals and those with multimorbidities were more likely to exhibit the two most severe symptom clusters (Severe level 2: Confusion, and Severe level 3 Abdominal and Respiratory), distinguishable as early as day 3. Investigating prediction of subsequent need for respiratory support, we found that personal characteristics alone, including PRISMA7 frailty, were able to achieve a ROC-AUC of 69.5%. Adding data from the first 5 days of symptom logging after onset, the ROC-AUC of need for respiratory support was substantially improved at 78.8%. Such an approach could be used to monitor at-risk patients and predict medical resource requirements days before they are required, opening the doors for proactive interventions.",

We aimed to evaluate whether frailty and multimorbidity predict in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 beyond chronological age. Methods: We analysed data from 165 patients consecutively admitted to an acute geriatric medicine ward in Brescia, Northern Italy from March 8th to April 17th, 2020, with a suspected diagnosis of COVID-19. The infection was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA. Pre-disease frailty status was assessed with the 9-point Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) and categorized as 'no to mild frailty' (\\ 6 points), and 'moderate to severe frailty' (6+ points). Based on a predefined list of 60 chronic diseases, multimorbidity was defined as the co-occurrence of C 2 of these chronic diseases in the same patient. Cox regression models were used to evaluate the hazard (HR) of inhospital mortality as a function of frailty and multimorbidity in the whole population and in those aged 70+ years. The C-statistics of different Cox regression models were used to assess the increment in accuracy in the prediction of in-hospital mortality provided by adding information on the CFS and multimorbidity to chronological age. Results: The median length of stay of the whole sample population was 10 days (IQR 7-17). Among the 165 patients, 112 were discharged, 11 were transferred to intensive care units and 42 died. Patients who died were older (81.0 years vs. 65.2 years, p \\ 0.001), more frequently multimorbid (97.6% vs. 52.8%; p \\ 0.001) and more likely to be frail (37.5% vs. 4.1%; p \\ 0.001). Less than 2.0% of patients without multimorbidity and frailty, 28% of those with multimorbidity only and 75% of those with both multimorbidity and frailty died during hospitalization. In survival analyses, adjusted for age, sex, and education, each unitary increment in the CFS score was associated with a significantly higher risk of in-hospital death in the whole sample (HR = 1.31; 95% CI 1.05-1.62) and in patients aged 70+ years (HR = 1.29; 95% CI 1.04-1.62), whereas each increment in the number of chronic diseases was not significantly associated with higher risk of death. The addition of the CFS to chronological age and sex increased in-hospital mortality prediction by 9.4% in those aged 70+ years. The highest positive predictive value was due to moderatesevere frailty (0.75 with a positive likelihood ratio of 9.15), whereas the highest negative predictive value was linked to multimorbidity (0.98 with a negative likelihood ratio of 0.05).",

Methods: Monocentric retrospective study of patients aged 65 years and older hospitalized in acute geriatric wards for COVID-19. Data from hospital admission was collected from the electronic medical records. Multiple logistic regression and Cox proportional-hazard models were used to predict mortality. Results: Of a total of 235 Caucasian patients, 43% were male, with a mean age of 86 \u00b1 6.5 years. Seventy-six patients (32%) died during their hospital stay. Hypertension, cognitive impairment, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes were the most prevalent comorbidities.

Non-survivors had a higher rate of heart failure (p = 0.044) and bilateral and peripheral infiltrates on chest radiographs (p = 0.001). A multivariable Cox regression model showed that male sex (HR 3.84, 95% CI 1.93-7.62, p = 0.0001), increased fraction of inspired oxygen (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03-1.09, p \\ 0.0001) and the presence of crackles at clinical status performed at admission (HR 2.84, 95% CI 1.23-6.57, p = 0.0145) were the best predictors of mortality, while the absence of functional decline was protective (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-0.99, p = 0.0003). Conclusions: In the oldest old hospitalized for COVID-19 male sex, crackles, a need for a higher fraction of inspired oxygen and functional decline at admission were independent risk factors of mortality.

Total deaths of patients 60+yrs -104 or 68% of all deaths. Key conclusion: Although only 22% of total cases of COVID-19 in N.Macedonia are at the age of 60 and above, which is similar to the younger age groups, they have the highest mortality -68% of total deaths. This imposes the necessity of strong preventive measures for this age group.",

The most significant proportion of fatalities occurred in older adults. However, there has been little evidence using an ecological (aggregate) approach. We aimed to test if the departments with a higher proportion of older adults reached a higher mortality excess in France and if they maintained a mortality excess for longer during the pandemic period. Methods: We used the data published by Geodes Public Health aggregated at the department level (n = 100 for Metropolitan France). Five levels of mortality excess in the French population were defined comparing expected versus observed mortality (EuroMomo model, 16-22 March to 11-17 May of 2020) . The departments were ordered based on their proportion of the population aged 60+. We obtained simple and complex absolute and relative measures of inequality of the maximum level of ME and the number of weeks with ME. Results: The maximum level of mortality excess of the youngest French departments was, on average, thrice that of the oldest departments. The youngest French departments reported mortality excess an average of 5 weeks longer than the oldest departments. Significant inequality was consistent using simple and complex, absolute and relative measures of inequality. Conclusion: Highest levels of mortality excess, and during a more extended period, were found in departments with a relatively younger population. A higher proportion of older adults in the population might be associated with a third socio-economical ''protective'' variable. Further multidisciplinary analyses are necessary to explain these health inequalities.",

The expected death and deterioration in the patient's health is often due to advanced disease, limitation of medical treatment and terminal illness, but the controversial emerges when some patients may prefer not to undergo lifesustaining treatments. The probability is associated with general indicators of decline and increasing needs, as the Gold Standard Framework Prognostic Indicator Guidance points. Methods: Prospective descriptive study of the patients admitted to a tertiary Hospital with COVID during the Pandemia from 11 March to 31 May. Patients who died were included and grouped according to admittance to Intensive Care Units (ICU) and compared according to demographic data, frailty scales, palliative Performance Scale version 2 comorbidities, used medication, admittance to hospital in the previous 6 month, and average length of stay. Results: There were 28 patients included, of those 16 were admitted to the ICU. The majority were between 75 and 85 y, none above 85 y. Average CFS was 2.6 vs 5.9, PPSV2 74.6 vs 44.7, PRISMA7 1.4 vs 4.2, Charlson index 1.6 vs 5.9, number of drugs 4.8 vs 8.7, recent admissions similar (2), lenght of stay 6.5 vs 7.2.

Discussion: In face of an unprecedented humanitarian crisis, research is important to evaluate and characterize the risk factors associated with the patients with expected death, and may contribute to better clinical decision and resource management. Our study showed that patients that died with higher disease burden were less likely to be admitted to the ICU.",

We included 707 patients aged C 50 years consecutively admitted to the hospital between March and May 2020. We completed detailed reviews of electronic medical records to collect our data. We identified delirium using the Chart-based Delirium Identification Instrument (CHART-DEL) and defined delirium as prevalent when present on admission. We also classified patients according to level of consciousness on admission using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale. Our outcomes of interest were in-hospital death, length of stay, admission to intensive care, and ventilator utilization. We estimated the associations of delirium and impaired consciousness with outcomes using regression models adjusted for sociodemographic factors, Charlson comorbidity index, antihypertensive drugs, signs, and symptoms related to COVID-19. Results: Overall, we identified delirium in 232 participants (33%). On admission, 86 (16%) were delirious, and 203 (29%) had impaired consciousness. We observed 263 deaths (37%) in our sample, and inhospital mortality reached 51% in patients who experienced delirium. Both prevalent delirium and overall delirium were associated with inhospital death, with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 1.81 (95% confidence interval [95% CI ] 1.25-2.62) and adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 1.57 (95% CI 1.02-2.42), respectively. In-hospital mortality in hyperalert, lethargic/stuporous and comatose patients was respectively 74% (aHR = 2.63; 95% CI 1.34-5.17), 56% (aHR = 2.53; 95% CI 1.55-4.14), and 74% (aHR = 3.35; 95% CI 1.61-7.0). Delirium was also associated with increased length of stay, admission to intensive care, and ventilator utilization. Conclusion: Delirium and impaired consciousness were strongly associated with in-hospital death in adults aged C 50 years with COVID-19. Clinicians should include delirium and consciousness evaluations in their routine assessments of severity and prognosis in this population, despite the pandemic-related difficulties for patient care. Introduction: To contain the COVID-19 pandemic, governments around the world restricted social and physical contact by issuing lockdown and social-distancing measures. Older adults, being considered a risk group for COVID-19, often follow more strict rules. Yet, lockdown measures may induce mental health problems and increase the occurrence of domestic violence (DV). We examine the effects of lockdown measures on mental health and DV in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: In the first wave of this longitudinal cohort study, an online self-report questionnaire on mental health and aggression was administered to a non-probabilistic sample of participants living in Belgium, Germany and Portugal. Participants were sampled through national media, social media, and snowballing procedures. This Abstract reports on Belgian events that occurred between 13 March and 13 April 2020. The second wave of data-collection is currently ongoing.",

Key conclusions: DV in older adults appears to be common, linked with lockdown measures due to COVID-19, and associated with adverse mental health outcomes. These findings highlight the possible need for public health measures and sociocultural changes preventing DV and improving mental health during lockdown in older adults.",

On the 29 of February, a citizen returning from France was COVID-positive. On 13th of March, Belgium went in lock down. On 25th of February, a 90-year old lady was admitted to our geriatric ward. She had anorexia for 1 week and gait problems. She was known with bronchi\u00ebctasia and coughing. On admission (day 8 from beginning of symptoms) crp was 463 mg/dl, mild lymphopenia (1, 16 .10 3 / lL) was present, oxygen saturation 95 % (2-liter oxygen per minute). She was treated with beta-lactam antibiotics, moxifloxacin, and antithrombotic prophylaxis. On day 11, she developed bilateral pneumonic infiltrates with high oxygen demand. Droplet isolation was installed. Because of persistent fever on day 16, a naso-pharyngeal swab for PCR COVID and other respiratory pathogens (virus, bacteria, fungi) was negative. On day 26, her lymphopenia disappeared, and oxygen demand reduced. She went home on day 66, still needing oxygen and not able to walk due to severe sarcopenia. On day 86, she was referred to our geriatric day hospital. COVID-IgG antibodies were slightly positive: 7, 6 AU/ml. Refrigerated serum of day 32 (19/3) was strongly positive: 76, 6 AU/ml. Her grandson went skiing in Livigno (Lombardy) from 7th till 13th February and joined the football match in Rome on 18th of February (AA Gent -AS Roma).

Conclusion: On 25th of February, COVIDdisease was already in our hospital in Eeklo, Belgium. -19) has reached proportions to be declared a pandemic disease, particularly in older people. This pandemic created important issues in terms of prognostic evaluation. Multidimensional prognostic index (MPI) is widely used as prognostic tool in geriatric medicine. However, there are no studies yet regarding the use of MPI to predict prognosis in older COVID-19 patients. Methods: Older hospitalized patients (age [ 65 years) affected by COVID-19 across five Italian hospitals were included from 26th April to 19th June 2020. At baseline, a comprehensive geriatric assessment was made and the MPI calculated accordingly. Clinical, bio-humoral and instrumental information related to COVID-19 were also collected. A follow-up period was proposed. Results: 104 Italian participants hospitalized for COVID-19 (mean age: 81.1 \u00b1 8.0; range: 65-95 years; females = 66.3%) were included. Their mean MPI value was 0.56 \u00b1 0.25, with 21.4% in the MPI low risk, 28.2% in the moderate and the 45.6% in the high risk MPI category. Among clinical signs investigated, cough was significantly more common in the MPI 1 compared to the MPI 3 category (63.6 vs. 27.7%, p = 0.003). Regarding vaccination history, people in MPI presented a higher prevalence of anti-pneumococcal vaccination (22.7% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.02) than those in MPI 3. Finally, regarding therapeutically approach, people in MPI 1 were more frequently treated with anti-retroviral medications than their counterparts (p = 0.03) and were more frequently exposed to non-invasive ventilation (54.5 in MPI 1 vs. 10.6% in MPI 3, p = 0.003). Conclusions: Older people hospitalized for COVID-19 have a high prevalence of frailty making this condition of importance for clinical-decision making. Physicians had the propensity of using more frequently non-invasive ventilation and anti-retroviral medications in less frail patients. The prognostic role of anti-pneumococcal vaccination should be explored during the follow-up period.",

Caregiving to elderly patients become harder than before, and being well-informed is more critical in this duration. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted for a period of 2 months, from March to May 2020. A questionnaire interrogated awareness and knowledge levels of caregivers. The questionnaire has consisted of general information about pandemic and demographic data. Participants answered the questions from the internet. SPSS-22 was used for data analysis. Results: The study population was composed of 79 women and 21 men. Sixty-nine percent of the patients were suffered from dementia. 30% of the participants were responsible for caregiving for more than 10 years. 76% of the caregivers were willing to take more information. 33% of the caregivers were taking the information from a single source. General knowledge status about pandemics were found to be correlated to education level (p \\ 0.01, r = 0.397). Key conclusions: Caregiving to elderly patients is an essential responsibility in the pandemic. Education levels of caregivers could affect the health status of geriatric patients in this duration.

Factors related to the patient's process usually analyzed through the total length of stay in ED (Length of Stay).

This is defined by the length of stay in PS more than 8 h before admission. The exit block can be expressed as a percentage of patients who suffer it or the total time of exit block in each time frame. Purpose: As part of a study to assess the impact of the CoViD pandemic on time-dependent diseases, we evaluated the population who went to the Emergency Room for acute neurological disorders during the period of the CoViD pandemic from 23 February to 1 May 2020 and compared it with the population accessing our Emergency Room during the same period of the previous year. Materials and Methods: We evaluated all patients over 75 years of age who needed access to our emergency room from February 22 to May 1, 2020. We then compared this population with those over 75 years of age who were accessing our emergency room during the same period of the previous year. Results and discussion: We enrolled 4891 patients. There was a severe reduction in the total number of elderly accesses: 1910 in the CoViD period and 2981 in the previous year. However, this decrease (-36%) was lower than that of the general population (about -50%). The vital parameters were overlapping without statistically significant differences. In both periods a slight female prevalence was confirmed (about 55%). The average age (84 years) was superimposable.

The Crowding input factors are lower in the pandemic period: reduced patients (1910 vs 2981) and reduced average waiting times (62 min vs 92 min). Reduced also the percentage of patients who exceeded the waiting time target by code of priority to the medical examination (16% vs 26%). Crowding throughput factors worsened: LOS (853 vs 485 min).

Methods: We provide a description of the Trace COVID-19 platform and its function. We also report the results of our unit in terms of number of patients followed, referrals to the emergency service, patients with confirmed disease and number of recoveries.

Although the virus can cause disease in anyone, it is particularly dangerous for those with various ''co-morbidities'' such as heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, obesity and others.

For example, the 1918-19 influenza pandemic spared older persons and the SARS-CoV-2 does not seem to affect children. Obviously we still have much to learn about this new virus and its age-related predilections. However, given the clear danger of this virus to older persons it is essential to find ways to protect at-risk persons from the virus while at the same time not harming, more than absolutely necessary, their essential freedoms. Furthermore we must at the same time take into account their social/psychological needs. Even in the absence of physical disease societal measures taken to protect society in general can wreak psychological havoc on isolated seniors. In our approach we must keep in mind that the older population is extremely heterogeneous -ranging chronologically anywhere from about 60 up until the very outer ranges of the maximum life span (122). On average, each age cohort from ''young-old'' (60-79) to ''old-old (80 +) is different and within each group there are also huge variations relating to SES, illness exposure and burden. Furthermore, the situation of almost older persons in high income countries (HICs) differs significantly from almost every elder in the poorer regions of the world, ie those which are low income (LICs). One example re COVID-19: a much higher proportion of older persons in the LICs live in multi-generational households making the idea of ''social distancing'' far less feasible than in HICs. But working in the opposite direction, disadvantaging older person in HICs, a much higher proportion live in long-term institutions which for obvious reasons constitute a very large proportion of COVID-19 related deaths in these countries. As well, for those elders in the community, lockdown policies of HICs which are effective in ''flattening the curve'' can also flatten the ability of older persons to cope with the resultant social isolation which for the most part does is not seen in LICs As such, our approach to the risks to older persons during this pandemic must take many factors into account: biology, clinical medicine, epidemiology and public health. The blanket is indeed not large enough for all but we must place it as judiciously as possible in order to protect, cover and keep warm as much as possible of the body politic. Until the successful advent of a vaccine effective in older persons, there is much to be done. An approach which will combine the expertise of geriatric medicine with time honoured field of public health is essential to knitting this protective cloth.",

Japanese people has required to refrain from nonessential outings. They were also required to suspend exercise facilities. The purpose of this study was to investigate the physical and mental effects of a state of emergency among participants of municipal exercise classes. Methods: A questionnaire survey was conducted on 683 people (average 69.3 years old) who participated in a municipal exercise class in Mitsuke City, Niigata Prefecture. The participants were asked how refraining from going out and suspended exercise class affected their exercise habits, social participation and mental health. Results: 72.2% of the participants felt that they were not getting enough exercise, and 63.4% reported that their communication with others had decreased. 11.4% of the participants reported that forgetfulness was a concern for them. Five-fold increase in the proportion of participants who reported that they felt their health had deteriorated compared to before the state of emergency was declared.

This approach, which was mandatory during the epidemic period, might also be useful in the future for clinical monitoring of PWDs. Appropriate informatic platforms should be developed to improve data transmission and protection of personal data.",

Governments are looking at tracking and tracing apps as a means to slow the spread of the virus. These apps have raised privacy concerns, as some of these apps need to store user data. Given these concerns, it is unclear if older adults are willing to use these. The aim of this study is to explore older adults' preferences for using Covid-19 tracking and tracing apps. Methods: An online survey was distributed among panel members of a panel company in the Netherlands. The data were collected in April. A total of 1068 respondents completed the questionnaire. For this study, we only focus on participants aged 65 and older (N = 259). The questionnaire included questions regarding media use and information needs during the Covid-19 pandemic. Preliminary results: Most older adults (96.5%) indicated that they heard of Covid-19 tracking and tracing apps. Just under a third indicated that they are willing to use such an app, while more than 40% of the respondents are not sure. Many of them believe that their privacy cannot be guaranteed (59.4%). Besides, 20% mistakenly believes that the app will protect them against infection. Key conclusions: If health organizations decide to start using a tracking and tracing app this app should be developed in collaboration with the users and based on existing guidelines for mHealth. Introduction: Older adults as the higher risk group for COVID-19 infection were known to face psychological and coping difficulties during this pandemic. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the general psychological health and coping strategies among Malaysian older adults during this pandemic crisis. Method: A total of 340 of individuals aged above 60 years (men = 159, women = 181), from the earlier cohort (LRGS TUA) and interventional studies from four selected states in Peninsular Malaysia were followed up during the lock-down period (MCO) due to COVID-19 outbreak (April-June 2020). Telephone interviews were conducted by trained interviewers from health sciences background to obtain participants' socio-demographic information, general psychological health, and coping strategies using Malay version of 12-items General Health (GHQ-12) and Brief COPE questionnaire. The analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics version 25.0 and presented as mean \u00b1 SD. Result: The result revealed that the participants have a low mean score of GHQ-12 (0.32 \u00b1 1.44). After adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, years of education, household income, and smoking status, participants living with their family significantly have a greater impact on their psychological health (R 2 = 0.326, p \\ 0.05). Besides, the participants used adaptive coping strategies, in which the highest mean score was religion (4.28 \u00b1 2.73), followed by positive reinterpretation (3.59 \u00b1 2.09), acceptance (3.42 \u00b1 1.90), planning (3.25 \u00b1 1.84), active coping (3.20 \u00b1 1.72), use of instrumental (2.63 \u00b1 1.04) and emotional support (2.56 \u00b1 1.02). Conclusion: This finding indicated that the Malaysian older adults had good psychological health status, especially when they are living together with their family and adapted positive coping mechanisms during this pandemic crisis.",

Results: It was found that the elderly attended LTA such as watching TV (78.1%), meeting by phone (69.9%), praying, cooking and reading respectively, at home for all day. GAI score was 10.41 \u00b1 5.23. It was found that 97.3% of the elderly did not exercise at all. In addition, a positive correlation was found between GAI score and praying (r: 0.580, p: 0.01). Key conclusions: According to the results of this study, it was observed that the elderly do activities that they were not active during the period of COVID-19. In addition, the elderly had moderate anxiety. Also, as anxiety increases, the rate of praying increases. The results of the study support that LTA should be organized by health and community professionals in order to reduce the level of anxiety, ensure that they are more active and productive during the periods of obligation to stay at home.",

Methods: Patients attending an outpatient geriatric medicine service were invited to participate in this project following their routine virtual assessment. A proforma questionnaire was administered to participants contacted virtually within 1 week of consent. Data was anonymised, imported into excel and analysed using SPSS (chisquared test). Results: 31 patients were included, median age was 83. 52% were male, 25% lived alone and 52% had cognitive impairment. 75% had heard of 'cocooning', of which 67% correctly understood the term. Three-quarters stated that cocooning had negatively impacted their quality of life (QoL); anxiety, loneliness and depression were reported in 49%, 36% and 29% respectively. 39% strongly feared getting Covid19. Cognition and living status did not correlate significantly with the psychological impact of Covid19. 61% did not use modern social media, its use did not impact QoL scores. 45% experienced a reduction in support services. 87% found the outpatient telephone service useful and 77% reported their needs were addressed. Threequarters favoured future virtual assessments. Conclusion: One third of patients poorly understood 'cocooning'.

During this pandemic, the world has adopted measures of isolation and social distance. Methods: This is a cross-sectional, quantitative and exploratory study, which included a sample collected online through social networks composed of 159 seniors aged between 60 and 65 years old, residing in Portugal and Brazil. According to the exclusion criteria described above, for the analysis of the results it was necessary to exclude 11 participants, 6 Portuguese and 5 Brazilian. The final sample included 96 Brazilian seniors and 52 Portuguese seniors who answered the questionnaire online, through Google Forms. Results and main conclusions: Categorizing the responses of the participants, the results indicate that the majority of the elderly interviewed have feelings of fear and concern about the Coronavirus associating it with death. It is noticed that these manifestations are due to the condition of isolation necessary to contain the virus, in addition to the lack of general knowledge about the consequences of the same. It is necessary, however, in view of the reduced sample; expansion of the study, to better deepen the social issues that guide the opinions presented about the coronavirus.Keywords: COVID-19; Seniors; Brazilian and PortugueseBibliographic reference [1] H.

In the context of this new reality, the adoption of a productive and beneficial routine might be crucial for older adults. This study describes a (social care) initiative taken within the coronavirus outbreak and examines the potential benefits in older adults' quality of life. Methods: For this purpose, the Integrated Healthcare System Long Lasting Memories Care (LLM Care) [3] was exploited, and more specifically the web-based cognitive training software [4] was used for 2 months. An online questionnaire, including consent form and assessments (SAST, IES-R-Gr, WHO-5, SUS) [5] [6] [7] [8] , was distributed to 20 older adults (mean age 69.54 years \u00b1 4,61) before and after the exploitation of cognitive training software aiming at evaluating the potential positive effect and usability of cognitive training software. Results: Overall, the study demonstrates interesting findings with regards to the degree of stress and anxiety, the quality of older adults' life, as well as the usability of the web-based cognitive training system. Key conclusions: Consequently, the use of web-based applications is considered to play a significant role during this severe situation in improving older adults' health well-being.

Yet during the COVID-19 pandemic, governments internationally have to resort to social distancing. This study aims to overcome psychosocial repercussion of social distancing by determining the effects of virtual exercises for older persons on mental well-being and factors which influence their adherence to the physical exercises during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This is a quasi-experimental study involving participants of the Promoting Independence in Seniors with Arthritis (PISA) study which was carried out between 2015 and 2019. Mental well-being is measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) pre-intervention and post-intervention. HADS scores were also available from annual visits conducted during the study. The 4-week virtual exercise was tailor-designed for older persons. Daily 30 min exercise on Google Meet as the virtual platform is led by health care professionals. Participants are required to keep a diary of when they exercised to promote adherence. Results: The original 251 PISA participants were approached using an online bulk text messaging application (Whatsapp) and 46 agreed to participate by replying to the text message. The results of their 4-week scores at baseline and 4-week follow-up will be available to report by mid of July. Conclusions: Older persons are considered a vulnerable group during the COVID-19 pandemic. By conducting virtual exercises, the risk of COVID-19 through physical contact could be removed while maintaining social contact using modern telecommunications.",

Especially older people, a high-risk group for a severe course of the disease, severely restricted their range of action.

The aim of the study is to determine the extent to which seniors used alternative ways of maintaining physical fitness and to evaluate their efficacy. Methods: Persons (60+) who trained in a standardized fitness circle which records individual training data, are examined. The participants are asked about their PA and mobility in daily life before, during, and after the pandemic-related restrictions. The primary endpoint of the study is the difference in the product of training weight and number of repetitions at the circle's leg extension compared between the three last trainings before and the first trainings after the restrictions. Results: The training data are evaluated by means of analysis of variance. Level of significance will be set to a = 5%. Discussion: Based on the results of the data collection, the effects of the pandemic-related restrictions on the physical capacities of older people can be assessed. Based on these results, measures can be identified to maintain physical fitness of older adults when organized sports activities are not available and give recommendations for PA during a potential second wave of the pandemic.",

Introduction: Participants: Lonely elderly people of both sexes, over 65 years . The aim was to create virtual groups, in order to break the isolation of the lonely elderly people, for communication, under the guidance of a team of experts: Internist-Gerontologist, Nurse, Psychologist, Social worker . Program Coordinator Team members could interact with each other through simple activities. The functionality of new applications was tested, in relation to the perception and compliance of the elderly in them, in order to establish inventive communication solutions of this age group, which could be useful even after the end of the alert period due to the corona . Method: The technology used was simple and suitable for the elderly. It was software built into a tablet with a simple and understandable form of use. At a predetermined time, the group as a whole participated in the online company. Results: 1. Initially the elderly, presented fears and difficulties in understanding the new communication technology. 2. But finally they were looking forward to each meeting, in order to communicate with each other, but also with the program coordinator. 3. They also actively participated in their interactive activities on their screens (eg gymnastic exercises). 4. At the end of the program they were more familiar with the new communication. Introduction: Older people are a group at risk for a severe course of Covid-19 disease. The current measures to protect from infection are likely to cause adverse effects by reducing older peoples' physical activity. Currently, many older patients avoid attending physiotherapy although it can prevent a deterioration of functional abilities, especially in multimorbid patients. Real time video-based physiotherapy sessions could be a useful supplement to standard physiotherapy. Since this therapy option was introduced in Germany due to Covid-19 pandemic for the first time, physiotherapy practices are not equipped and empirical data do not exist, yet.This study aims to investigate the feasibility of video-based physiotherapy as an alternative therapy option for older patients (C 60 years) and its influencing factors. Method: Patients have been equipped with hardware and corresponding software for six weeks. Physiotherapy practices receive technical support. The number of video-based physiotherapy sessions are documented and individual experiences of physiotherapists and patients are reported via questionnaires. Therapists briefly document important aspects after each therapy session and for the whole treatment. Telephone interviews are used to collect demographic data, acceptance of technology and the use of technical communication devices from patients at the beginning and end of the study.",

This review aims to discuss the protection and appropriate nursing methods for managing COVID-19 in elderly. Methods: This is a narrative review study. Results: The increase in the elderly population worldwide and the higher prevalence of comorbid diseases in this group, the elderly are particularly at a high risk during this pandemic. Nurses are involved in follow-ups and care as well as in primary, secondary and tertiary health services for the elderly. The disease has adverse effects on the physical health of elder individuals who have a weak immune system, limited activity, and difficulty in taking adequate nutrition. Conditions such as an inability to cope with stress, weakness, and hopelessness adversely affect psychological health. Furthermore, conditions such as loneliness, being away from loved ones, stigmatization, and abuse adversely affect social health as well. Nursing theorists such as Nightingale, Orem, Rogers, Neuman, Roy, and Watson, who have significantly contributed to this discipline, have explained the relationship between the elderly and the environment, self-care, energy field, stress-coping methods, adaptation process, and spiritual care during a pandemic. Conclusion: Nurses have a significant role and responsibility in preventing the transmission of the virus, treating and caring for the infected elderly, and providing post-discharge rehabilitation. Keywords: COVID-19, elderly, nursing, theory, protection Introduction: Opioid-induced delirium is very common amongst hip fracture patients. Introduction of Femoral Nerve Blocks (FNBs) offers a safe and effective method for improving pain in the setting of hip fractures leading to reduced opioid need. It is typically initiated in the emergency department in our institution prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the reconfiguration of services secondary to COVID-19, the majority of hip fracture patients are no longer receiving FNB which consequently leads to poor pain control and",

The patient went to the emergency room in the May 3 data for the reported persistence of fever for about three days complicated on the last day by acute dyspnea. She was a patient with advanced Alzheimer's disease complicated by lodging syndrome, Parkinson's disease, high blood pressure, severe dysphagia and hypothyroidism in replacement treatment. The patient takes the following drug therapy: cardioaspirin, lercadipine, levothyroxine, valsartan. In the emergency room, the patient had performed blood chemistry tests with detection of neutrophilic leukocytosis with partial lymphopenia, elevation of RCP, alteration of D-dimer and LDH, with substantial normality of the other laboratory indices, including procalcitonin. Gold-pharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swab negative for Sars-Cov2 research. The blood gas analysis documented acute hypoxemic-hypocapnic respiratory insufficience, mixed alkalosis with normale anion-gap and P/f ratio equal to 169. At the thorax the radiologist reported a ''ground-glass'' interstitial commitment framework compatible with a CO-RADS 4/5 classification (high probability of Sars-Cov2 infection). In light of the clinical, laboratory and instrumental picture, the infectious disease colleague placed the indication for hospitalization in the covid-area by our hospital. During the hospitalization, in consideration of the positive blood culture for Staphylococcus epidermidis, the patient was treated with antibiotics with a wide range and oxygen therapy, first with Venturi mask and FiO2 31% passer\u00e0 on the fifth day with nasal cannulas with low parameters . During hospitalization, the radiological checks documented a slow and incomplete resolution of the interstitial lung picture with constant negativity of the Sars-Cov2 research both on swab and on serological investigation. After 24 days of hospitalization, the patient was discharged with a complete resolution of the respiratory insufficiency and of the radiological and laboratory framework. In conclusion, the low sensitivity of the diagnostic means for COVID-19 in our possession, together with the great phenotypic variability of the clinical, laboratory and instrumental framework made the diagnosis of certainty and the subsequent therapeutic and management process of the elderly patient complex. Although federal restrictions aimed to protect this vulnerable group, the measures may also reduce physical activity and thus accelerate functional decline. Due to the pandemic, regulations were changed so that video-based physiotherapy can now be conducted in Germany. As this is a novel approach, we will investigate health related patient experiences regarding video-therapy. Methods: Patients aged over 60 years and technically unequipped who had been prescribed physiotherapy were given the opportunity to attend video-therapy sessions. A semi-structured telephone interview was held at the beginning of the study and after 6 weeks questioning health status, physical activity, quality of life, participation, and evaluation of the video-based physiotherapy they received.",

One epidemiologic characteristic was that people with significant comorbidities presented the most severe forms of disease and the highest death rates. Since older people in general have a higher prevalence of chronic conditions they seemed to be at highest risk. Consequently, several measures for isolating this category of population have been implemented in many countries, including in Romania. This is a normal approach since so little was known about the specific behavior of this coronavirus infection. Nevertheless, not all older people are the same, they are a highly heterogenous group, as it is well known. Maybe for the future these protective measures need to be different when addressing robust older people and frail older people, tailored to their degree of frailty. This is important since strict home isolation of all older people, irrespective of their comorbid status, could have some consequences. These aspects, including psychological and pathological effects, are evaluated for two regions in Romania to help identify the impact of social isolation and strict home isolation of older people, especially those with little social support, including family support, comparing rural to urban communities.",

In Hungary, like in many other countries, the amount of direct contact between doctors and patients was reduced according to the existing Hungarian legislation. In this extraordinary time at the Department of Dermatology, Venerology, and Dermatooncology of Semmelweis University, dermatologists have provided successful telemedicinal dermatology care with a store-and-forward system. Teledermatology allows dermatologists to evaluate, diagnose, and treat patients at a distance using telecommunication technology. Furthermore, teledermatology opened up the possibility in the healthcare system to provide remote dermatology care for a special group of elderly people (frailty, bedridden, disabled, etc.) as an alternative to traditional face-to-face visits.",

Patients or caregivers had to submit some personal data (name, date of birth, etc.), a short medical history, a list of the symptoms, a list of the regular medications, and upload at least five photos of the affected areas through a smartphone. Patients' pictures and medical data were stored on a secure platform. If further information was needed we performed a phone call. Every patient received a report and a treatment plan from a certified dermatologist. Nonemergency skin conditions were reviewed within three days, emergency conditions were reviewed within 24 h. Results: In 1 month, we have performed 3487 teledermatology consultation. The great majority of patients (91%) were aged under 65. The number of patients aged over 65 was 286 (8,2%), consisting of 147 men (4,2%), and 139 women (3.9%), the mean age of men was 74.21 years, the mean age of women was 73.46 years. Only 56 patients aged over 65 took photos of themselves, 162 patients needed help in taking photos because of the localization of the skin conditions, and 68 patients were unable to take photos for various reasons (e.g., general condition, dementia, or insufficient technical skills). Further in-person examinations were needed in 55 cases. Only 11 patients had to be hospitalized. The majority of dermatological indications for telemedical consultations included various kinds of skin diseases, skin cancers, and wounds. The most common disorders in the elderly population were different forms of eczema (n = 62), including venous eczema (n = 19), psoriasis vulgaris (n = 10), leg ulcer (n = 7). The most frequent infectious skin conditions were herpes zoster (n = 6), and scabies (n = 5). Among the findings, there were some rare skin conditions such as bullous pemphigoid (n = 1), mycosis fungoides (n = 1), carcinoma erysipeloides (n = 1). Surgical procedures were needed in 11 cases. DiscussionNowadays telemedicine has become an important element of health care. Due to the visual character of the dermatological specialty, teledermatology may become a major tool in dermatological consultations, particularly for the elderly population. Teledermatology could be extremely useful for patients living with severe cognitive or physical disabilities, and for whom traveling even short distances can pose considerable practical and economical difficulties. Although our institute started teledermatology service in an emergency, it could be useful in normal circumstances to determine the emergency of a skin condition, establish obvious diagnoses, and perform follow-up visits for this fragile population. However, our data have higlighted an important aspect of teledermetology related to the underrepresentation of older patients among the cases which could be due to the little confidence of the elderly population in using electronic devices needed for a telemedical consultation. Therefore, caregivers may play an important role in teledermatology services for the elderly patients in the future.",

The aim of this study is to establish whether there was a change in fall frequency in people suffering from dementia at SVPR between COVID-19 and non COVID-19 periods. Method: An observational study including patients with dementia residing in closed wards at SVPR. Collected data included: number of patients who fell, total number of falls, mechanism and consequence of fall and physical restraints' use. We compared results of April 2019 (pre Covid-19) with April 2020 (COVID-19 era). Only patients residing in these wards during both years were included. Data was collected from patients' files. Results: A total of 75 patients were included. 11 patients (14.7%) sustained a fall in both April 2019 and April 2020. The total number of falls in 2019 was 13 compared with 16 falls in 2020. One patient had physical restraints in April 2019 compared to 3 patients in April 2020. The most common mechanism of injury was an unwitnessed fall in both years. No serious fall-related injuries occurred in 2019 but one patient sustained a hip fracture in 2020. Conclusion: There was no significant change in number of patients who fell and total number of falls in COVID-19 era. Study Limitations: small population size, short time-period and data collected from patient's notes is influenced by quality of documentation. The process of dementia itself has deteriorating consequences on gait and balance which might also affect falls' risk over 1 year.",

Methods: From March 9 to May 11, 2020, 140 older patients and their caregivers, followed-up by our Center for Cognitive Decline (CDCD), were contacted by telephone and interviewed by using a telephone-based survey. Of the 131 respondents, 119 participants accepted to receive a TM visit by using a dedicated connection (jiitsi meet/Galliera), including only the dyads with access to PC, tablet or smart phone for 2 way video interaction. Results: Of the 131 respondents (mean age 80.6 \u00b1 6.1 years; males = 20%), 85 (69.4%) lived accompanied, 40 (30, 5%) lived alone with caregiver supervision. During the lockdown period, the isolation measures forced 20/131 respondents (15, 2%) to change their living arrangements. Grocery and pharmacy outings were performed by family members in 111/131 participants (84,7%). Health status was found to be stable in 79/131 respondents (60,3%), with no COVID-19 symptoms; 1 patient/131 deceased for COVID-19 and 13 patients (9,1%) were hospitalized for other health problems. 53 patients out of 131 (41,9%) reported Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) including sleep disorders (26,7%), anxiety symptoms (15,6%), delirium superimposted on dementia (7%) with an increased burden of caregivers. 10 caregivers out of 131 (7,6%) started a psychological support remote programme. Moreover, 63 patients (48%) reported pain. Finally, in 39 patients (29,7%) the COVID 19 emergency insight was present and 44 patients (33,6%) without disease insight reported difficulties to respect the COVID-19 restrictive and confinement measures. Conclusion: This TM program showed to be feasible and well accepted in most of patients (93, 6%). Monitoring BPSD and pain, tailoring actual therapies and delivering information and psychological care to patients and their caregivers were the most useful interventions in older patients with dementia and their caregivers. perceived stress and the self-report mental efficiency of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild dementia, during and after the lockdown. Methods: A total of 40 individuals, of which a deep neuropsychological evaluation was available immediately before the pandemic, were recruited. Participants answered to questionnaires investigating their perceived stress, and self-reported mental efficiency, by telephone. This evaluation was repeated three times, every 2 weeks, to monitor over time possible changes. A post-pandemic neuropsychological evaluation is currently ongoing. Results: Although cognitive data are still lacking, data about perceived stress and self-reported mental efficiency suggest that people with MCI and mild dementia seem to not perceive stress related to Covid-19 and a detrimental effect of it on their cognitive functioning. Key conclusions: In people with MCI and mild dementia, the effects of a world-wide pandemic emergency seem to not affect their routine life, as well as their psychological and cognitive well-being. Data about neuropsychological actual status will be available, and will show if consistency between patients' self evaluation and objective consequences of Covid-19 on cognition exists.",

COVID 19 resulted in transformation of the service necessitating a new way of working. This crisis has encouraged embracing telemedicine as an appropriate means of assessing our patient cohort. 79% of the 65-74 year-old age group lack digital skills, therefore telephone consultations were chosen for our cohort. Methods: St James's benefits from an Electronic Patient Record system. A remote working team was established including doctors in isolation and those redeployed from other services, who were given remote access. Secretarial staff informed patients of appointment cancellations and upcoming telephone consults. Telephone contact was made with both patient and next of kin, if required. Records were kept of consultations, and correspondence sent to the primary care physician. Results: Contact was made with 277/321 (86%) patients. 24 (16%) were discharged, 43 (9%) warranted urgent reviews and 75% (210) were given further appointments. The reviews were facilitated in our day hospital on a next day basis. These reviews included -dementia with BPSD (7), Parkinson's disease review (3), medically unwell (3), falls (3), CCF (2), general decline (2), stroke (1), medication review (1), no details (2) . Two of these were admitted. Feedback has been positive and evaluation is currently underway. Conclusion: Telemedicine, despite substantial research undertaken in the late 1990s, has not gained mainstream support. It enabled rapid triage and further assessment in those who were perhaps avoiding hospitals otherwise. Feedback has been positive with formal evaluation underway. We often fear what is unknown, which appears uncertain and obscure, as can happen with the threat of a pandemic. Generally, we experience a state of anguish when we lose our stable references, there is uncertainty about the future, we foresee a condition of forced solitude and isolation, when our lives or those of our loved ones are affected by a challenging chronic or disabling disease, which are already the prevailing fears of the elderly. The most fragile among us, such as those who suffer from cancer, feel more exposed to events that can threaten their precarious state of health. The recent and current pandemic situation caused by Covid-19 can generate a particular state of anxiety, especially in elderly cancer patients. They are very frightened that they will be neglected, that they will be unable to complete the necessary treatment, the planned therapies, the periodic checks already scheduled for their cancer. Given their precarious health condition, cancer patients also fear that covid-19 may be more aggressive and dangerous for them than for other people. There is also the fear of being an easier source of contagion for their relatives. Fears tend to become more pronounced in the elderly men, most affected by the covid-19 infection.In this delicate period, elderly cancer patients, perhaps more than others, require specific psychological intervention, even more so if they are alone.In a medical service of North Italy, we examined several elderly cancer patients by a semi-structured interview, a specific questionnaire and DASS-21 scale.",

Due to global university closure and lack of clinical rotations most of university classes were conducted online. Method: In response to pandemic lockdown, medical and pharmacy students based in Pozna\u0144 University of Medical Sciences in Poland have established remote consultation services under substantive supervision and guidance of tutors specialized in geriatrics and pharmacy. Data derived from consultations along with follow-up interviews of senior participants and consultants were collected and subjected to analysis. Objective: The aim of this article is to present potential benefits of interdisciplinary, cooperative, ''learning by doing'' educational undertaking with the use of remote communication means towards improvement of care of elderly patients during pandemic lockdown.ResultsProper interventions were assigned to each of healthand pharmacotherapy-related problems reported by project's participants. Positive feedback results have shown that students' remote consultations proved to be beneficial for both elderly patients and medical and pharmacy students during pandemic lockdown and university closure. Conclusions: Students and elderly participants can both benefit from remote consultations. Remote means are considered efficient in detection and counselling of health-and pharmacotherapy-related problems of Elderly (especially, during pandemic lockdown in regard to social distancing measures).

Age and vital parameters were overlapping. Patients in the CoViD pandemic tended to be more frequently carried by ambulance and 118 compared to the reference period (75% vs 53%, the remaining half independent). The priority codes for the medical examination were not different (71% minor emergencies, 7% non-urgency in the pandemic period vs 78 and 5%). During the pandemic, they patient presented with higher discharge severity codes (yellow and red) with a slightly higher frequency compared to the reference period (25% vs 13%) and more frequently need hospitalization (46% vs 28%). Rarely this category of patients presents altered crowding indexes; Crowding input factors are however lower in the pandemic period: reduced patients (208 vs 455) and reduced average waiting times (86 min vs 118 min). The percentage of patients who exceeded the waiting time target by priority code of medical examination was also reduced (13% vs 19%). Crowding throughput factors worsened only slightly: LOS (580 vs 425 min). Crowding output factors also slightly worsened: the percentage of access block is higher during the pandemic (19% vs 9%). The Total Access Block Time is significantly higher during the CoViD period (36, 104 min vs 29, 159 min).

However, many elderly patients are also poorly equipped to adapt to the technological advances designed to minimize risk, such as video consultations in GP practice. Proportion of remote consultations requiring 'conversion' (subsequent face-to-face consultation) was measured to determine if telephone and video consultations are sufficient to reduce footfall in the practice. Methods: 2938 consultations were reviewed, comparing 'conversion' rates (CR) for the first 2 weeks of lockdown (March 2020) to the preceding 2 unrestricted weeks as a baseline. Footfall was calculated as 'converted' remote consultations plus primary face-to-face consultations.",

This decrease correlated with increasingly creative uses of technology, such as asking patients to email in photographs of skin lesions. There was also increased efficacy in stratifying patients to either self-help at home or referral to secondary care. Overall, footfall in the practice dropped by 91% as a result of these changes. Key conclusions: Footfall and exposure to the clinical environment in a GP setting can be successfully reduced by creative and pragmatic utilization of video consultation technology. This is essential to protect the elderly and/or at-risk population during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Everyone is susceptible to COVID-19, but older adults aged 60 years and above due to physiological changes that come with ageing and possible underlying medical disorders are more susceptible [1] . The need to ensure access to healthcare services by the elderly during this pandemic is paramount. Nonetheless, it is essential that stakeholders continue to prioritize access to healthcare services and medicines among the older adults amid the fight against this global public health, especially in Africa where little attention is paid to geriatric care. Methods: This is a descriptive recommendation Abstract for countries in Africa based on tailored strategies to improve access to healthcare among the geriatric population during this pandemic and in the post-pandemic era. Discussion and key conclusion: When implementing interventions to reduce the spread of disease, such as partial or total lockdown, exceptional attention must be offered to older people. Remote consultations such as telemedicine have the potential to protect healthcare workers and older adults from unnecessary exposure to disease, while ensuring continuity in the delivery of care, and in addition, decreases resource utilization across the already stressed health-care infrastructure [2] . COVID-19 is a call to accelerate improved geriatrics differentiated healthcare services in Africa by leveraging on telemedicine and technology without necessarily exposing older adults to the risk of contracting diseases by visiting healthcare settings. During COVID-19 pandemic and post-pandemic telemedicine would have unlimited potential to provide effective, appropriate, and secure care in the context of highly transmissible disease epidemics, both for management, and for regular follow-up of chronic disease among older adults. The implementation of this technology should ensure that the future policy on telemedicine includes the end-users in the planning and implementation. 2) admitted to our hospital (average-stay 16.9 \u00b1 5.4 days) with severe bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia who received high-dose glucocorticoid therapy when they developed mild-to-moderate ARDS and their clinical evolutions (temperature) and radiological changes. We analyzed analytic parameters (D-Dimer). Furthermore, we compare glucocorticoids alone versus associated with Tocilizumab and we looked at differences between early or late administration of treatment in disease-evolution. They all received therapeutic-dose heparin. Results and discussion After therapy, D-Dimer tended to go down, as did body temperature, and lymphocyte count went up. Patients who received glucocorticoid therapy in an early phase of disease evolution (50%) presented a less severe D-Dimer elevation compared with those who received it in later phases. Combination therapy with glucocorticoids and Tocilizumab (60%) was used when ARDS presented quicker and more severely, which coincides with a higher elevation of D-Dimer.",

Currently we have lacking therapeutic options. Some observational studies have suggested benefits of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for the treatment of Covid-19, whereas other treatment reports have described mixed results. As a result, these treatments are increasingly used off-label for patients with COVID-19. Tisdale et al found a valid method to quantify the risk of drug-induced QTc interval prolongation. In a retrospective study we assessed the usefulness of this method for the management of HCQ in relation to the prolongation of the QTc. Methods: 58 hospitalized patients, positive for SARS-CoV-2 (PCR) treated with HCQ were examined. We calculated the risk score of prolongation of the QTc interval and examined its possible progression on the basal ECG (T0) and after 7 days from the insertion of the drug (T1). Results: Of 58 patients (M = 36,20%) 44, 82% were[65 years of age (average age 76,10 \u00b1 8, 70 years).

Experience from caring for patients with Covid-19 found that the course of illness differed from diseases familiar to geriatricians which prompted further evaluation. A snapshot audit of 30 patients was conducted over a 2 week period on a geriatric medicine ward to assess the nature and progression of Covid-19 and the challenges around care at the end of life. The unusual features found in these patients included a prolonged hypoactive delirium stage in 50% of patients with a mean time of 4 days from starting end-of-life care to death. Also, 30% of patients required increased doses of midazolam compared to average doses, prompting support from the specialist palliative care team to manage symptoms of agitation and breathlessness. In about 40% of patients, it was felt that death was caused by a slow deterioration in renal function due to hypoactive delirium and minimal oral intake, rather than a rapid progression of multi-organ failure; death seemed to be protracted in this group of patients. In conclusion, the progression of Covid-19 in older people represents an atypical trajectory to death. Hypoactive delirium seems to be a prominent feature and terminal agitation from presumed 'air hunger' described in Covid-19 patients seems to require higher doses of palliative drug doses towards the end of life Introduction: Short leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Mendelian Randomization Studies, using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with short LTL, infer a causal role of LTL in ASCVD. Recent results, using the blood-and-muscle model, indicate that higher early life LTL attrition, as estimated by the ratio between LTL and skeletal muscle telomere length (MTL), rather than short LTL at conception, as estimated by MTL, should be responsible of the ASCVD-LTL connection. Methods: We combined LTL and MTL measurements by Southern blotting and SNPs profiling in 402 individuals to determine if 15 SNPs classically described as associated with short LTL at adult age were rather responsible for higher LTL attrition during early life than for shorter LTL at birth.Results: Two of these SNPs (rs12696304 and rs10936599) were associated with LTL in our cohort (p = 0.027 and p = 0.025 respectively). These SNPs, both located on the TERC gene, were associated with the LTL/MTL ratio (p = 0.007 and p = 0.037 respectively) but not with MTL (p = 0.78 and p = 0.32 respectively). Key conclusions: These results suggest that SNPs located on genes coding for telomere maintenance proteins may contribute to a higher LTL attrition during the highly replicative first years of life and have an impact later on the development of ASCVD.",

The primary outcome was a composite measure of adverse health events (non-accidental falls, fractures, unplanned hospitalizations, and death), recorded in 2016/2017. Multivariable logistic regression models were built to identify independent predictors, using multiple imputation for missing data. A sensitivity analysis in complete cases was performed. [1, 2] . However, few observational studies have examined how these different trajectories could have different effects on mortality risk and none of them have use the tool FTS5 [3] . Data driven methods allow us to group subjects according to similar FTS5 trajectories along baseline and follow-up score using the Toledo Study of Healthy Aging (TSHA) sample, a longitudinal cohort study. Our hypothesis is that decreasing frailty score could show lower death risk than those subjects that increase or maintain higher FTS5 scores.",

NT-proBNP assay is promoted as a key tool for the diferential diagnosis of CHF. But the diagnostic utility of NT-proBNP for systolic HF identification has been questioned in elderly, as NT-proBNP levels are influenced by age and several age-related comorbidities, such as anaemia, renal dysfunction, malnutrition. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of NT-proBNP levels and its correlation with echocardiography in the group of elderly hospitalized patients initially not admitted with the diagnosis of HF. Methods: We enrolled 517 consecutive elderly patients (age [ 65 years) admitted to the Geriatric Clinic during the year 2019 (1.1.-31.12.2019) . Admissions due to worsening of known HF were excluded. Patients with at least one sign or symptom compatible with CHF were tested for NT-proBNP (fatigue, exercise dyspnea at most). NT-proBNP values \\ 300 pg/ml were considered as an age-independent exclusion criterion for HF (high negative predictive value), while values above 1500 pg/ml were considered as a highly suspected diagnostic criterion for CHF. Main comorbidities and laboratory parameters were considered to adjust correlation analyses between NT-proBNP and LV systolic function. LV function was measured echocardiographically as ejection fraction (EF) in all subjects with increased NT-proBNP values and correlation was calculated.Results:Mean age of the cohort was 81 years, mean NT-proBNP 2254.7pg/ml and median value of 1659 pg/ml. Circulating levels higher than 1000pg/ml were reported in 45 % of studied patients, 36% showed values [ 1500 pg/ml. Only 25% of all seniors admitted to hospital with non-cardiac symptoms presented NT-proBNP levels \\ 300pg/ml. Only 11% of patients with elevated values higher than 1500 pg/ml proved echocardiographically low EF \\ 40%. When performed univariate analysis, NT-proBNP values showed no significant correlation with EF, haemoglobin concentration, CRP, uricaemia and surprisingly age. Weak correlation was identified between NT-proBNP levels and value of eGFF and creatinaemia. No correlation with the LV ejection fraction was observed, even after considering of other parameters in multivariable regression analyses. ConclusionHighly elevated NT-proBNP values were present in most of the admitted non-cardiac studied seniors. Diseases different from CHF have appeared to affect NT-proBNP plasma levels significantly in the elderly population of patients and can falsely mislead to CHF diagnosis when relying the diagnostic process only on the biomarker assay.

Aim: We aimed investigate retrospectively the incidence and predictive value of several clinical and echocardiographic parameters for an unsuccessful electric conversion to SR and short-term AF recurrence in patients who have experienced the electric cardioversion (ECV) for an episode of persistent AF. Methods: We have examined data from 1380 patients who underwent ECV between Jun 2015 and Feb 2020 in our institution.

Head trauma is more frequent in the elderly in a statistially significant way (p = 0.016). This is further confirmed by the fact that in the elder population there is a greater request for maxillo-facial surgeon advice (10% against 2% in younger patients) and neurosurgeon advice (38% against 26%).

This population has a high incidence of risk factors: 94% had at least one risk factor, 63% of the study population had at least two risk factors, and 30% had 3 or more. By far the most represented risk factor in this population is high blood pressure in 73.5% of cases. The prevalence of atheromasia superortic trunks present in 32.6% of patients, ischemic heart disease 26.5%, atrial fibrillation 26.5% and diabetes mellitus 20.4% follow with substantially overlapping prevalence. with slightly lower percentage of ical disease 22.4%; while cigarette smoking habit has a lower incidence in this population (4%). We then divided the population of thrombolysis patients into clinical syndromes: motor, sensory, language and nonspecific symptoms. Conclusions: in elderly patients who are candidates for thrombolysis, high blood pressure is the widely represented risk factor, while cigarette smoking is poorly represented. Particular attention should be given to all the other risk factors under consideration. Patients with atypical symptomatic cadres, on the other hand, have a lower prevalence of FA, suggesting that in these cases the rate of heart disease pathogenic stroke is reduced Abstract # 15 Invisibily cloak: recognition delay of atypical stroke symptoms in patients with more than 75 years Introduction: According to different symptomatological spectrum at presentation, the purpose of this study is to ana-lyze times needed for recognition and management of patients over 75 years affected by stroke. Methods: We conducted a prospective and monocentric observational study of all patients with acute stroke referred to the Department of Emergency and Acceptance in Pavia from May 1, 2017 to May 1, 2018. Results: We enrolled a total of 430 patients with more than 75 years who received diagnosis of stroke at our Emer-gency Department from May 1st 2017 to May 1st 2018. The average age was 83.8 y and women were in slight majority (female 60%). At presentation, symptomatological spectrum was so divided: 56.7% motor symptoms, 15.7% sensory symptoms, 46.8% speech disorder and 36.5% atypical symptoms (including dizziness, confusion and syncope). While the first three groups with typical symptoms accurately presented an high priority code for medical examination (about 90% had yellow code or higher), only 74% of patients belonging to the forth group (atypical symptoms) had a high pri-ority code. This resulted in different waiting times: average of 38 min (min) for the first three categories, average of 55 min for patients with atypical symptoms. This time delay in the fourth group was primarily dependent on recogni-tion at door, while subsequent times (request for imaging, neurological consultation and process time) were normalized. Conclusions As our results demonstrated, patients presenting atypical symptoms of stroke were more difficult to recognize at door as neurological acuities, leading to increased waiting times.",

Results: 336 inpatients are enrolled in study, of which 275 are elderly, with male prevalence (55%).The average age is 79. Only 22% of the elderly went spontaneously to the ED, the 79% was accompanied by the ambulance. 20 % of the elderly inpatients received a high gravity level after the medical visit, 25% was assigned to the minor intensity care area and the last 75% to the medium-high intensity level of care. The average waiting time to the medical examination was 29 min. 22% of these inpatients needed to recover in Short Observation Intensity for an average time of 18 h to stabilize the clinic state. Nearly all ED inpatient were recovered in and only the 1.1% were transferred to an hospital with a minor intensity level of care.

Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcriptions were analyzed inductively using thematic analysis with Atlas.ti software. (Preliminary) results. After 13 interviews (6 men, 7 women, median age 81 years), data saturation was reached. Most participants considered the vulnerability screening to be part of routine care and could not remember the particular screening questions, except for the cognition test. Their overall attitude towards the concept of screening was positive. Participants believed that vulnerability screening could help to identify the patient as a whole and adapt care to the patient's needs, which they considered important for all patients, regardless of age. Participants who did not consider themselves to be vulnerable, did not personally experience an added value of the screening but they did believed in the added value for others. Conclusion: From an ED-patients' perspective, screening for geriatric vulnerability was experienced as a part of routine ED care and was considered to be of added value for optimal ED care. Hospital-acquired skin injury (HAPI) is described as preventable events, but in many instances prevention is relative to knowledge deficit. HAPI is not ole the responsibility of the nurse, but inclusive of the entire healthcare team. Acute care facilities continue to see an increase in the number of HAPI resulting in increased mortality rates annually. In order to preserve and reduce the current rates, development of education specific to the clinical technician (CT) will promote a comprehensive approach for this level of care provider. Prevention of HAPI is of great concern, therefore ensuring that the knowledge deficit is not the cause, a proactive approach to education for the CT is vital.",

The subjective perception of the geriatricians was also noted.The survey has not yet been completed; we currently have 57 responses, on approximately 300 active Belgian geriatricians. The first results show an involvement of geriatricians in all CoviD units, whether geriatric or not. Ambulatory activities have ceased. Geriatricians have often been involved in the triage of patients in the emergency and intensive care units (ICU), but the age limit rarely appears to be a hindrance, except in cases of saturation of ICU beds, where the age limit of 80 years is the most frequent. A sense of value, recognition and solidarity are the positive elements; stress, isolation, and the media's misinterpretation of the involvement of gerritricians in COVID-management in nursing homes are the negative elements.The COVID pandemic has profoundly changed geriatric practices, but the involvement of geriatricians has been important at all levels.

In the elderly patient with numerous chronic diseases, in fact, often gastrointestinal bleeding can be caused by drugs or other pre-existing diseases that are associated with neoplastic pathologies that endoscopy alone cannot detected. Therefore, before prescribing invasive investigations, the US allows easily to study the abdomen and often the unknown neoplastic pathologies that are the cause of progressive increase of anemia in the elderly, especially if associated with iatrogenic causes, can be quickly detected.

Methods: Retrospective descriptive study of patients older than 75 years admitted to the ER of a tertiary hospital, during 2018. The analyzed data were obtained from the electronic file namely demographic data (gender and age), priority score determined in the triage (red-immediate resuscitation, orange-very urgent, yellow-emergent, green-non urgent, blue), admittance with an ambulance that meant that there was probably a previous telephonic contact with the National Institute of Emergency Medicine (INEM), diagnostic tests ordered, medical specialties that evaluated the patient, time spent in the ER and destination. Results: There were 1913 patients included, with an average age of 81,29 (of which 639 had over 85years), 1115 (58,3%) females.

Women had a stronger association of higher BMI, higher waist circumference, pain and lower physical activity with lower gait speed (i.e. sensitivity), where higher BMI and especially pain were also more prevalent among women (i.e. exposure). In addition, low education and chronic diseases were also more prevalent among women. In contrast, two factors associated with higher gait speed were more often found among women: larger personal network size and higher physical activity. Key conclusions: The female disadvantage in gait speed represents a combination of (1) a higher exposure to most risk factors and (2) a higher sensitivity to some risk factors, of older women compared to men.

Vascular biomarkers offer the potential to monitor response to treatment in frail populations, with respect to the vascular risk element of the condition. CD3+ T cells expressing the CD31 adhesion molecule (PECAM-1), have been shown to play a role in vascular homeostasis and repair and are termed angiogenic T cells (TANG). T cells that no longer express CD28 (CD28NULL) are regarded as senescent T cells and have a proinflammatory phenotype.

PH seems to be increasing in the elderly; however, it has been poorly studied in this group. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic and prognosis features as well as management of precapillary PH in the elderly compared to young subjects. Methods: We performed a single center retrospective study in the Introduction: In nursing home (NH) residents, hypotension may predispose to adverse events including falls, fractures and mortality. Yet, evidence on hypotension detected by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is scarce in this setting. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and the clinical predictors of ambulatory hypotension in NH residents and to analyze its related ABPM profile. Methods: We retrospectively analysed data from a sample of 100 NH residents undergoing a comprehensive geriatric assessment and ABPM. Ambulatory hypotension was defined as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) drop C20 mmHg between two consecutive measurements to a minimum SBP \\100 mmHg. Participants with nocturnal hypotension were excluded from the analysis. Predictors of ambulatory hypotension were investigated using multivariate logistic regression adjusted for comorbidities, functional status and hypotensive medications.

Conversely, 2019 European guidelines on dyslipidemia management in the elderly recommend statin use in primary prevention based on a reduction in major vascular events in clinical trials. Therefore, our aim was to revisit the association between LDL-C and mortality in the general geriatric population in light of the latest cohort studies. Methods: The authors independently searched PubMed for cohort studies with the following keywords: lipoprotein AND (old OR elderly) AND mortality NOT animal NOT trial. We excluded non-English reports, studies in high cardiovascular risk groups, and papers with electronic publication date before 18/12/2015 or after 1/5/2020. Results: We identified 5 papers including 72,036 elderly individuals from 6 cohorts where all-cause mortality was recorded, two of which also analysed cardiovascular mortality (N = 70,132). Statistically significant inverse association between all-cause mortality and LDL-C was seen in 4 cohorts representing 98% of the total number of participants. In 2 cohorts, no association was found. Regarding cardiovascular mortality, females with the lowest LDL-C quartile had significantly higher cardiovascular mortality in one cohort (no association found in males), while in the second cohort no association was found Conclusions: Recent cohort studies reinforce the LDL reverse epidemiology in the elderly. Even though statins appear to be safe, in older people higher LDL levels may be protective for non-cardiovascular diseases such as cancer, respiratory/digestive disease, and injuries. patients with increased Body Mass Index (BMI). An extensive literature indicates that heart failure (HF)-related cardiac denervation, measured through iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-mIBG) imaging, constitutes an independent predictor of cardiovascular outcomes and mortality. Moreover, it has been also demonstrated that aging independently affects cardiac sympathetic innervation, which is also influenced by BMI in HF patients. However, the impact of BMI on cardiac 123I-mIBG uptake in elderly HF patients has not been specifically investigated. Methods: We studied 161 patients with systolic HF aged 65 years or older, collecting demographic, clinical, echocardiographic data and 123I-mIBG imaging parameters.

Background: Assessing the prognosis of elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is particularly challenging since clinical evolution and prognosis of these patients is the result of a complex combination of functional, biological, environmental and psychological factors. The Multidimentional Prognostic Index (MPI) is a prognostic tool able to predict the outcome in different clinical settings. However, the prognostic role of MPI in elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction has not yet been explored. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of MPI on short term survival in elderly patients with AMI. Methods: 302 elderly patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of IMA and undergoing coronary angiography and angioplasty have been studied.

Results: The study population presented a mean age of 73.0 \u00b1 6.8 years. During a 6-month follow-up, 29 non-survivors were registered. The logistic regression analysis revealed the GRACE Score and the MPI to be significantly and independently predictive for mortality: OR 1.04 (95% CI 1.02-1.07) and 12.55 (95% CI 4.68-33.62), respectively. From the analysis of ROC curves, it emerged that a predictive model including both Grace Score and MPI is better than the ones taking the two score separately (AUC 0.91). Conclusions: MPI is an independent predictor of short-term outcome in elderly patients with AMI. MPI predictive value is comparable to Grace Score and application of both models together improves the efficacy of model.",

This offers advantages, especially for vulnerable patient groups. The aim is therefore to describe potential differences in aerobic fitness in the moderate and maximum WR range in healthy, physically inactive older adults (HPIOA) and type 2 diabetes patients (T2D). Methods: 27 HPIOA (73 \u00b1 3 years) and 27 inactive T2D patients (60 \u00b1 8 years) were tested on a cycle ergometer with pseudo-randomized WR changes of 30W and 80W, followed by the assessment of V'O2max. Heart rate (HR) and oxygen uptake (V'O2) data were measured and kinetics information was calculated using cross-correlation-functions (CCF) between WR and the respective parameter. Higher maxima of CCFs indicate faster adjustments in the CVS. V'O2max was determined over the last 30s of the test. Results: V'O2max did not differ significantly (P = 0.675) between the groups (HPIOA: 22.7 \u00b1 5.2 ml\u2022min-1\u2022kg-1 vs. T2D: 22.1 \u00b1 5.8 ml\u2022min-1\u2022kg-1). The CCFmax(HR) of T2D (0.25\u00b10.05) was significantly (P = 0.018) lower than that of HPIOA (0.30 \u00b1 0.09), but not the CCFmax(V'O2) (T2D: 0.31 \u00b1 0.04 vs. HPIOA: 0.31 \u00b1 0.07; P = 0.684). Discussion: Despite their younger age, HR regulation in T2D patients seems to be slower. This was not evident by the exclusive analysis of V'O2max. HR regulation is of great importance for the adaptation to changes in WR in everyday life and should be assessed in different patient groups for early identification of changes in the CVS.",

A 85-year-old man with chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction of multiple-factor aetiology, previously submitted to coronary artery bypass grafting and coronary angiography with stent placement, maintaining severe two vessel disease, mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, permanent atrial fibrillation, essential hypertension, type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, admitted due to progressive worsening of dyspnoea and bilateral oedema of the lower limbs. Physical examination: jugular vein distension, pansystolic murmur best heard over the apex, abolish murmur in the lower half of the right hemithorax and bilateral oedema of the lower limbs until the inguinal zone. Laboratory investigation: elevated Nt-proBNP. X-ray: increased cardiothoracic ratio, right pleural effusion. EKG: atrial fibrillation, nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities. Transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiograms: dilated left atrium and ventricle with preserved ejection fraction, severe MR due to chordal rupture with A2 flail and annulus dilatation, severe tricuspid regurgitation and high probability of pulmonary hypertension. After multidisciplinary discussion percutaneous mitral valve repair (PMVR) was performed with improvement of symptomatology. PMVR is an important procedure for patients at high risk of surgical repair, which has successfully reduced patient symptoms, disease morbidity, improved quality of life, and facilitated reverse remodelling with potential for a survival advantage.",

This is important since studies have shown a positive correlation between use of antipsychotics in patients with dementia and increased risk of stroke, as high as 9 folds, in just four weeks from initiation of antipsychotic drugs [1] . The aim of this quality improvement project was to establish whether current practice in prescription of antipsychotics meets national guidance on this topic provided by NICE in a UK GP surgery and improve any substandard domain in this topic.A retrospective database search was conducted with inclusion criterias of ''dementia and ''antipsychotics'', after which 30 patients were identified and their documentation and drug chart were audited against current standards. Followed by a prospective search of same inclusion criterias 3 months after introduction of interventions to improve standards.There was a 50% improvement in documentation regarding discussion between prescribing healthcare professional and patient/carer about the risk/benefits of antipsychotic medication. There was 40 % increase in use of non pharmacological interventions prior to initiating antipsychotics. There were marked improvements in all set standards and overall an increased awareness regarding prescribing in dementia related Method: We treated two couples which one of the partners has Alzheimer's disease and and living together at home. The two couples took part in weekly sessions together at home over a course of 8 weeks.

It was also found that the higher the number, severity and frequency of patients' neuropsychiatric symptoms, the greater the stigma that, according to caregivers, people in society place on their relatives (rs = 0,267, p = 0,001) as well the stigma they deposit on their relatives (rs = 0,320, p = 0,001) and the sense of shame and pity for the patients (rs = 0,214, p = 0,008).

Methods: 64 patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive drops of Avidekel Oil or placebo respectively. Over the course of sixteen weeks, ten visits were conducted. In each visit data on vital signs, behavioral disorders (based on the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-NH), Clinical Global Impression Severity-Agitation/Aggression), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), concomitant medications, adverse events, and safety tests were collected. Results: 64 eligible patients were screened and recruited. Their average age was 79 with 37.5% men. Four patients withdrew before randomization, 60 patients began cannabis/placebo treatment, 40 in the active treatment group and 20 in the control group. Baseline CMAI scores in the treatment and the placebo groups were 57. 28 and 58.5, respectively (p [ 0.83) .

It is unknown whether depression, which affects both PA and cognitive functioning, counteracts this association. We therefore investigated the association between baseline PA and cognitive functioning over time, stratified for depression. Design: Longitudinal. Setting and participants: We used data of the Netherlands Study of Depression in Older persons (NESDO), a multi-site cohort study with 6-years follow-up. 297 depressed and 97 non-depressed older participants with complete data on baseline PA and cognitive functioning were included. Measures: Linear mixed models, stratified for depression, were used to assess the association of self-reported baseline PA with five standardized outcomes of cognitive functioning (Mini Mental State Examination, interference-control, verbal memory, working memory, and their compound-score) at baseline, and after 2 and 6 years.

In both groups, also no significant interactions of PA with time were found, indicating that the extent of the rate of cognitive decline over time was largely unaffected by PA. Only decline of working memory was significantly worse in the depressed group compared to the non-depressed group. Conclusions and implications: At older age, the level of PA may not impact long-term cognitive functioning, irrespective of the presence of depression. Depression appeared to worsen age-related decline of working memory only. However, selective attrition may have biased our results. As a higher PA-level at older age has a positive effect on a multitude of other health outcomes, PA should still be encouraged in this population.",

Whilst frequently listed as causing Orthostatic Hypotension (OH), the relationship between antipsychotic use and OH has never been explored in mild-to-moderate AD, a group who may be particularly vulnerable to their adverse effects. Methods: We analysed longitudinal data from community-dwelling older adults with mild-to-moderate AD in 9 European Countries. We assessed the effect of antipsychotic use on orthostatic blood pressure (BP) measured on eight occasions over 18-months, in addition to the association between antipsychotic use and incident falls. Results: Of 509 older adults (aged 72.9 \u00b1 8.3 years, 61.9% female) with mild-to-moderate AD, 10.6% (n = 54) were prescribed a longterm antipsychotic.

Thus, the promotion of cognitive health among older people will gain further importance in the EU countries in the coming years. The present small-scale, exploratory study focuses on the perception of cognitive health amongst health care providers and older people. We conducted semi-structured interviews with two physicians, and two persons without cognitive impairment aged 65 and 68 years. The interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. The results show two types of knowledge of cognitive health: a scientific one, held by physicians, socially and culturally transmitted and disseminated; and a reified one, popularised, and specifically anchored among older adults. Additionally, our results suggest several perceived barriers and levers regarding the promotion of cognitive health. Lack of motivation can be one of these barriers. Furthermore, barriers include public policies and the health care system (e.g., lack of provision, or unsuitable settings), or can be linked to communication. Several levers directly related to these barriers have been identified. We found the need for better communication between health care providers and older adults related to the promotion of cognitive health. Our results also suggest using economic levers, such as insurance coverage or vouchers to improve the participation in the promotion of cognitive health amongst older adults. Our findings provide foundation for refining and expanding the offerings dedicated to the promotion of cognitive health among older people in Luxembourg.",

We aimed at studying the association between basic activities of daily living at hospital admission and mortality among older patients with dementia. Methods: All patients aged C 65 years with diagnosed dementia in the population-based National Danish Geriatric Database from 2005 to 2014 were included and followed until death, emigration, or study termination (31.12.2015) . Data on Barthel-Index-100 (BI) was used to assess ADL. Patients were categorized into four predefined standard BI subcategories according to the national Danish version of the statistical classification of diseases (BI = 0-24 (very low ADL), BI = 25-49 (low ADL), BI = 50-79 (moderate reduced ADL), and BI = 80-100 (independent ADL)). Association with mortality was assessed using multivariable Cox regression analysis adjusting for age, marital status, Charlson Comorbidity Index, BMI, prior hospitalizations, year of admission and polypharmacy. Results: In total, 6,543 patients (women 62%) were included, median (IQR) age 84 (79-88) . Mortality increased significantly with decreasing BI in both the crude and multivariable analysis. In subcategories BI = (80-100) and BI = (0-24) survival time (median(95%)) was 3.6 (3.4-3.9) years and 0.8 (0.7-0.9) years, respectively. Also, in patients with BI = (0-24), the overall mortality risk (HR (95%CI)) was 2.4 (2.2-2.7), 30-day risk 11.8 (5.8-23.9), and 1-year risk 4.4 (3.5-5.5) when using BI = (80-100) as reference.",

Among the potential risk factors, increasing attention has been focused on sedentary behaviour. However, synthesizing literature exploring whether physical activity/exercise can affect health outcomes in people with dementia or with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is still limited. Therefore, the aim of this umbrella review, promoted by the European Geriatric Medicine Society (EuGMS), is to understand the importance of physical activity/exercise for improving cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes in people with dementia/MCI. Methods: Umbrella review of systematic reviews (SR) (with or without meta-analyses) of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational (prospective and case-control in people with MCI) studies based on a systematic literature search in several databases. The certainty of evidence of statistically significant outcomes attributable to physical activity/exercise interventions was evaluated using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results: Among 1,160 articles initially evaluated, 27 systematic reviews (4 without meta-analysis) for a total of 28,205 participants with dementia/MCI were included. No observational study on physical activity/exercise in MCI for preventing dementia was included. In SRs with MAs, physical activity/exercise was effective in improving global cognition in Alzheimer's disease and in all types of dementia (very low/low certainty of evidence). Moreover, physical activity/ exercise significantly improved global cognition, attention, executive function, and memory in MCI, with a certainty of evidence varying from low to moderate. Finally, physical activity/exercise improved non-cognitive outcomes in people with dementia including falls and neuropsychiatric symptoms. SRs, without meta-analysis, corroborated these results.",

At such stages, patients may present with either subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: Participants: In total 172 patients (age range 39-91 years, 78 women) with SCI or MCI were included, of whom 51 developed dementia within 2.5 years. Data collection: A dual-task test involving Timed Up-and-Go [1] simultaneous with naming animals (TUGdt) [2] was performed at baseline. Time score, number of animals named, and number of animals/10s [3, 4] were calculated. Data on demographic characteristics and results of the cognitive tests Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clock Drawing were collected. Diagnoses were identified after 2.5 years. Statistical analyses: Logistic regression was used to predict dementia incidence. C-statistics were calculated for predictive capacity. Analyses were stratified by age.ResultsThe TUGdt variable ''animals/10s'' showed the highest association with dementia incidence in the total sample (OR per 1 std decrease 4.06, 95% CI 2.28-7.23, p \\ 0.001). Among younger patients (under median age, 72 years), the corresponding OR was 19.4, 95% CI 3.53-106.17, p \\ 0.001, and ''animals/10 s'' added predictive capacity to a model with age, gender, educational level, MMSE, and Clock Drawing test, with an increase of c-statistics from 0.88 to 0.94. In the total sample, the increase in c-statistics was negligible (0.85 to 0.86).Key conclu-sionsAmong younger patients with SCI or MCI, ''animals/10s'' adds value to demographic characteristics and standard cognitive tests regarding predicting dementia disorders. Hence, TUGdt may become Introduction: Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI) and Cognitive Training (CT) are the gold-standard pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for mild to moderate dementia [1] . The present study aims to investigate the effect of each treatment, alone or combined, on neuropsychological profile of patients with mild dementia. Methods: Forty participants, enrolled on clinical (geriatric assessment) and morphological (CT/RMN) assessments, were assigned to three groups receiving, respectively, only the pharmacological treatment (AChEI, n = 14), both the treatments (AChEI + CT, n = 15), or only the cognitive training (CT, n = 11). Cognitive profile was evaluated, at the baseline and after three months, by the MMSE [3] , and an extended neuropsychological battery of tests, the Brief Neuropsychological Examination-2 [4]. To evidence differences among the treatments, in terms of changes in the patients' neuropsychological profile, linear mixed models were conducted. Results: A general improvement at the MMSE emerged only in patients which received AChEI + CT, and CT, compared to the group that received only AChEI. Interestingly, after the intervention, individuals receiving the CT showed a significant improvement in immediate memory recall with respect to the AChEI group. In addition, only the group receiving both the treatments (AChEI + CT) showed an improvement in delayed recall after the intervention, compared to the other groups. Key conclusions: The combination of AChEI and CT seems to bring the greatest benefit for persons with mild dementia. More interestingly, CT is more effective than AChEI alone even in improving memory, which classically is considered as the ''lost'' cognitive domain.

Both aging and age-related cognitive decline are heterogeneous, multifactorial processes with a high demand for studies aimed at better characterizing the interface between dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, the ATN classification system was applied to the records of 223 patients with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia admitted to the Memory Clinic of the University Hospital of Cologne. Patients were divided into two age groups: \\ 70 years (n = 98, 44%) and C 70 years (n = 125, 56%). In the 223 participants with full data sets including cerebrospinal fluid, neuropsychological testing, diagnosis and age, A+T+N+ was the most common group (52%). Significant differences were found between the two age groups in AD continuum groups (ie. all groups with pathological amyloid) and non-AD continuum groups (p = 0.018), whereby the older group belongs to AD groups to a larger extent compared with the younger one. A relationship between amyloid pathology and cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination) was found (p = 0.003), but only the younger participants showed significant differences of cognition in amyloid stages (p \\ 0.001) and not the older ones (p = 0.639). The latter observation is in agreement with recent studies from other groups. Our results show that the overlap between aging and dementia needs to be considered in every interpretation of diagnostics. Age-related cut-off values might be a better fit. Aging and pathologies other than amyloid may play a substantial role in cognitive decline of older patients. Diagnostic examinations of oldest-old patients might have to be considered more comprehensively than those of young-old persons. Introduction: With the evolving knowledge on hearing as a mid-life risk factor for dementia, identification of patients who are at risk becomes increasingly important. Our memory clinic is based in a tertiary referral centre and refers patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) for audiological evaluation based on cognitive diagnosis, rather than self-reported hearing deficits. This study sought to examine the patient experience and understanding of this process. Methods: All patients with MCI who were referred for audiology review were contacted. A patient survey was delivered over the phone. Outpatient letters and the memory clinic database were reviewed. Results: 30 patients were contacted, 9 (30%) could not recall their audiology assessment. 20 patients were surveyed. 8 (40%) had selfreported hearing loss. 9 (45%) had mild-moderate hearing loss and 8 (40%) had moderate-severe. 6 patients (30%) could recall having the rationale behind having a hearing test as part of their memory assessment explained to them. The majority (75%) felt a hearing test was an important part of their memory assessment, but just 7 patients (35%) identified a link between hearing loss and memory problems.

Appropriate use of thromboprophylaxis is shown to reduce the incidence of VTE and death from PE. The rationale for its use is both scientifically plausible and evidence based. Conclusions: Implementation of ward round checklists and posters resulted in a tenfold increase in proportions of patients being appropriately re-assessed within 24 h of admission.

This could potentially enhance patient satisfaction and reduce costs associated with prolonged inpatient care, supporting the role of a dedicated front-door geriatrician. Background: Geriatric syndromes (GS) are very common in older patients and are disclosed through the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA). The grouping of complexes geriatric multifactorial conditions under the conceptual framing of GS allows the standardization and thus simplification of the clinical treatment of older patients. Geriatric resources (GR), on the other hand, represent a similar construct in terms of patients' capacities. Neither GS nor GR, however, are currently collected as a standard in everyday clinical practice. Therefore, the actual prevalence of these two entities is largely unknown across settings. Patients and methods: All patients in this study were prospectively enrolled in 4 different studies and received a CGA at admission and discharge, as well as GS and GR recording at admission. Patients were all over 65 years of age and had at least two chronic conditions. The studies were performed at an internal medicine ward (IM, 499 patients), in the emergency room (A&E, 270 patients), at a general practice (GP, 125 patients), and in the intensive care unit (ICU, 56 patients). The GS recorded were polypharmacy, instability, incontinence, inanition, immobility, irritability/depression, cognitive impairment, insomnia, impoverishment, swallowing disorder, chronic pain, sensorial impairment, irritable colon, iatrogenic disease, social isolation, fluid/electrolyte problems, incoherence/delirium. The GR recorded were physical, good living conditions, social, economic, competence-related, intellectual, spiritual, motivational, emotional and mnestic resources. The syndromes and resources were collected S178 Eur Geriatr Med (2020) 11 (Suppl 1):S1-S309 either by direct questioning the patient or relatives, by researching the medical history or by CGA.

The lowest amount of GR occurred in patients admitted to IM and at the GP (median for both 6, IQR 4-7). The distribution of the various GS and GR was, with a few exceptions (for GS ''impoverishment' ' and for GR ''living conditions'', ''social'' ''motivational'' and ''competence-related'' were not significant), also statistically significant. Discussion: It is possible to collect GS and GR in many different settings where older, multimorbid patients are typically managed and treated. Additionally, there is a different distribution of GS and GR between these settings, which is likely to play an important role in patients' trajectories but has not been adequately addressed yet. How these findings can influence clinical decision making and what conclusions can be drawn for physicians and nurses needs to be investigated in further studies. Introduction: Frailty is common in older, multimorbid patients and has a negative impact on physical activity. Walking as a main functional ability to participate in activities of daily living is of key importance. Established questionnaires assessing physical activity are based on self-report and are strongly biased. In this study, we focused on GPS data to detect and compare real time walks and individual mobility characteristics in frail older persons. Methods: Community-dwelling adults C 70 years with (pre-)frailty received a GPS Logger for 10 months. Walking speed and distances were analyzed by customized software. In parallel, Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) including gait speed (GS) and Timedup-and-Go Test (TUG) were conducted monthly. Results: GPS data of 20 participants (84.5(\u00b1 5.2) years, 85% women, mean frailty index 1.9 (70% C 2) points) were analyzed and revealed three types of walkers: Type A presented only a few, short walks nearby the home with significantly reduced means in GS (0.45 (\u00b1 0.1) m/s), SPPB (3.8 (\u00b1 0.8) points) and TUG performance (23.4s (\u00b1 4.9)). Type B showed the largest activity space, exceeding walking distances and highest mobility scores (0.82 (\u00b1 0.1) m/s (GS), 7.0 (\u00b1 1.3) points (SPPB), 13.2(\u00b1 1.4)s (TUG)). Type C performed constantly high numbers, durations and distances of walks with an average of 0.63 (\u00b10.2) m/s (GS), 6.5 (\u00b12.4) points (SPPB), 17.1(\u00b14.4)s (TUG). Conclusion: Walks and individual activity spaces can be mapped via GPS. Heterogeneous walking behaviors and a wide range of functional performance were observed. GPS data can make a valuable contribution to the assessment of physical activity under everyday conditions in frail older people. Background: Policies related to older people include interventions directed towards health, independence, activity, social and economic participation. Assessment of quality of life (QoL) is an endpoint used to evaluate the efficacy of these. The OPOQOL 35 questionnaire addresses gaps from previous questionnaires. Methods: Cross-sectional study in the Geriatric Clinic outpatients. Patients fulfilled the OPQOL-brief questionnaire with the nurse, as well as the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. Clinical data was collected. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA, a p value \\ 5 was considered significant. Results: A total of 40 patients were included, 28 (70%) female, the median age of 80 (76-88). Considering global geriatric evaluation, a median of 5 (4-7) on the Lawton & Brody scale, 6 on the Katz scale, and 2 (2-3, 5) on PRISMA7. The OPQOL-brief questionnaire answers had a median score of 56 (48, 5-59), the visual analogue scale (VAS) of quality of life had a median 60 (50-75), and QALYs median was 0,44 (0, 35-0, 55). OPQOL-brief correlated with QALYs (correlation coefficient 0,57, p-value = 0,0001), and with geriatric scores: Lawton&Brody (correlation coefficient 0,5, p-value = 0,002), Katz (correlation coefficient 0,48, p-value = 0,005) and PRISMA7 (correlation coefficient -0,5, p-value = 0,006). Discussion/conclusion: OPQOL-brief varies between 13 and 65, with higher scores standing for better QoL. Our sample had a median of 56, which reveals an overall good QoL. Most importantly, it seemed that the quality of life was tightly related to the geriatric scores associated with dependency and frailty, and there was no relation to demographic factors.",

Delirium which is an acute confusional state with fluctuating course during the day is frequently observed in elderly patients experiencing acute stress such as hospitalization. Various strategies are being developed to detect and prevent this syndrome which causes serious morbidity and mortality worldwide. In our study, which we conducted on the delirium awareness day, we determined the point prevalence of delirium in geriatric inpatients in our country by using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), and revealed its relationship with frailty, a geriatric syndrome which is a common cause of serious morbidity. Materials and method: Sixty-two patients aged 60 years or older who were hospitalized in the Internal Medicine Clinic of Marmara University Pendik Training and Research Hospital on March 13, 2019 were included in the study. The demographic information, comorbidities and medical history of the patients were obtained from the patient or first degree relatives, and patients' medications were obtained from the patient files. Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) to assess nutritional status of patients, FRAIL frailty scale (Fatigue, Resistance, Ambulation, Illnesses, Loss of weight) to assess frailty status, Katz Index of Independence Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Lawton-Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) to assess functional status, delirium risk factors and delirium evaluation test (CAM) were applied. If there was mortality during follow up, the date was stated. Results: The mean age of the patients was 71,9 + 8,21. Twenty six patients (41.9%) were female and 36 (58.1%) were male. According to CAM, delirium was detected in 18 (29%) of the patients. According to the FRAIL scale, 21 (33.9%) patients were prefrail and 41 (66.1%) were frail. All 18 (100%) cases developing delirium were found to be frail. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, being older than 70 years, low Katz ADL score and low MNA score were found to be independent risk factors for delirium development.",

This study investigates the outcomes of 104 older COVID-19 positive patients (mean age 84) diagnosed with delirium on admission to Homerton University Hospital, London, UK. It was conducted as a retrospective analysis of electronic patient records of patients admitted during the peak of the coronavirus outbreak. The aims of the study are twofold: To assess how delirium is diagnosed in COVID-19 patients. To evaluate the outcomes of older COVID-19 patients diagnosed with delirium. Methods: Data was collected from electronic patient records to determine, firstly, how delirium was diagnosed. Confusion was diagnosed by 2 methods: History documented in the notes, or formal use of an assessment tool-the Abbreviated Mental Test Score (AMTS).Outcomes of these patients were subcategorised: Still an inpatient, discharged from hospital, deceased. Results: 243 older COVID-19 positive patients were admitted during the study period, 104 were diagnosed with delirium. 45 were diagnosed using the AMTS. 52 were diagnosed based upon clinical history. Of the 104 diagnosed with delirium 36 were discharged from hospital. 64 patients died. 4 remained as an inpatient. Conclusion: Delirium is a common presentation of COVID-19 in older adults. It is a poor prognostic indicator, associated with high mortality. The results of this study demonstrate that older adults often present atypically, with acute delirium rather than cough and fever. Recognition of this association and the risk of increased mortality will help inform clinical decision making and improve patient care.",

Aim: In this retrospective observational cohort study, we evaluated whether the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI) could predict the delirium onset in older individuals admitted to the hospital for hip fracture who underwent surgical intervention. Methods: Consecutive older patients admitted to the hospital for hip fracture underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) to calculate the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI) from information on functional, cognitive, mobility and nutritional status, comorbidity, number of medications and co-habitation. According to previous cut-off, MPI was expressed in three grades, i.e. MPI-1 (lowrisk), MPI-2 (moderate-risk) and MPI-3 (high risk of mortality). Delirium was assessed during hospitalization using 4 AT test. Results: 244 older patients (mean age 85 \u00b1 6.9 years; females = 84.2%) who underwent surgery for hip fracture were included. 104 subjects (43%) received a diagnosis of delirium. Patients with delirium showed higher pre-operative cognitive impairment (p = 0.0001), lower baseline functional status (p = 0.001) and were older than patients who did not experience delirium. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated a significant association between MPI grade and MPI score and the onset of delirium during hospitalization (p \\ 0.05 and p \\ 0.0001, respectively). Overall, the incidence of delirium during hospitalization was significantly higher in patients with more severe MPI score. Conclusions: MPI may be an useful tool to identify older patients at risk of delirium when admitted to hospital for hip fractures and have to undergo surgical intervention.",

            "text": "Jo\u00e3o Tavares Introduction: The evaluation of delirium is a central domain in caring for older adults. Studies on delirium evaluation focus mainly on the hospital context. However, the identification of delirium in primary health care is essential, especially because of complaints of changes in mental status [1] . This study aims to assess the effects of a short educational intervention on the knowledge of health care clinicians (HCC) in primary care (HCC-PC) to identify delirium in older adults in the community. Methods: The pretest-posttest design followed a single group of HCC-PC. To assess knowledge, a standardised case vignette of delirium was used [2] . Two hours of education and training were provided in a single session. The data were analysed with a Wilcoxon test, accepting a p-value \\ 0.05 as statistically significant. Results: Fourteen clinicians participated in the training (nine nurses and five physicians). Eleven of the participants were female. The average age was 46.3 \u00b1 15.5 years; the average professional time was 27.8 \u00b1 11.2 years. Eleven reported no previous education or training in delirium. In the pretest, eight did not recognize the acute change in mental state and twelve did not recognise delirium and the subtype. In the posttest, twelve and eleven recognised the acute change in mental state and delirium, respectively; all participants identified the subtype. Posttest recognition of acute mental status (p = 0.014), recognition of delirium (p \\ 0.01) and identification of subtype (p \\ 0.01) significantly improved from the pretest. Introduction: Delirium is common, particularly in hospitalized elderly patients (up to 30%) (1) . The identification of underlying causes is crucial to avoid adverse outcomes. Case report: An 80-year-old-woman was admitted to the emergency department with a convulsive crisis. She presented a Glasgow coma scale of 9, little reactive isochoric pupils, febrile (38,5 8C) and normotensive. There were no other symptoms suggesting infection, the remaining physical examination was normal and glycaemia was 508 mg/dL. She had clinical record of incipient dementia, diabetes, hypertension, epilepsy and nonadherence to medication. She had no previous hospitalizations or genitourinary tract manipulation. The lab results demonstrated leukocytosis (15.19 9 103) with neutrophilia and normal Reactive Protein C. Urine analyse was normal, with no drugs identified; Sars-Cov2 and influenza swabs were negative. Cranio-encephalic computed tomography (CT) had no signs of ischemic or haemorrhagic events. Abdominal ultrasound and cerebrospinal fluid had no signs of infection. The hyperglycaemia was corrected and was medicated with valproate bolus and ceftriaxone, without improvement during hospitalization. Endocarditis, HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C were excluded and Thoraco-abdominalpelvic CT was normal. The blood cultures were negative and the urine culture identified a Candida tropicalis; she started fluoconazole, presenting gradual improvement of consciousness and resolution of fever. Conclusion: Candiduria by Candida tropicallis is rare (12,7%) (2), especially without risk factors such as genito-urinary tract manipulation, immunosuppression, surgery or recent antibiotherapy. In this case, the only risk factors identified were uncontrolled diabetes and age. As candiduria may present only as delirium in elderly, it is pivotal an early detection and treatment. Introduction: There are multiple delirium assessment tools. Yet validation data have mostly been generated under study conditions. There are few studies providing information in full clinical populations on (a) tool completion rates and (b) proportions of scores positive for delirium. The 4AT (www.the4AT.com) is a globally-used clinical tool for delirium detection. We examined completion and detection rates of the 4AT as implemented in two university hospitals. Methods: We analysed electronic records on all consecutive patients aged C 5 0 years admitted to acute medical wards between Apr 2016 and May 2019. The 4AT is scored from 0 to 12. Scoring: 0, negative; 1-3, cognitive impairment but no delirium; 4-12, possible delirium. We assessed completion rates, percentages with scores in the three scoring bands, and length of stay. Results: Of the 69,462 consecutive admissions aged C 50 years old, 51,238 (74%) had a completed 4AT. 77% of patients aged C 65 had a completed 4AT. In the 51,238 with completed 4AT, 33,028 (64%) had a score of 0, 9,499 (19%) had a score of 1-3, and 8,711 (17%) had a score of 4-12. Median length of stay in days in relation to scoring categories was 0: 3.6 days (IQR 1.3-8.6); 1-3: 8.9 days (IQR 2.8-26.1); 4-12: 9.2 (IQR 3.3-26.8).",

A double-blind randomised controlled study was conducted in the two health centres located in Muang district, Nakhon Ratchasima province, between July 2019 and January 2020. Control and intervention groups were created and thirty-five T2DM older patients with chronic periodontitis who attended the centres were randomly recruited into each group. The intervention group received an oral health education program based on the Health Belief Model (HBM), individual oral hygiene instruction, scaling and root planning at one month, and individual oral hygiene instruction at three months. The patients in the control group received the routine program. Outcomes were assessed using a questionnaire, a simplified oral hygiene index, and glycaemic status (HbA1c). These measures were applied at baseline, three months and six months. Data were analysed using a Chi-square test, a t-test, and repeated measure ANOVA at p-value = 0.05. The results at three and six months showed that the intervention group significantly improved their HBM and oral health behaviour scores. Furthermore, their OHI-S scores and HbA1c levels (p \\ 0.05) decreased, while there was no significant difference in the control group. The findings suggested that the proposed program was effective among diabetic older people who have periodontitis in terms of improving oral health S182",

None of the patients received any sugar-lowering therapy and only 2 (3,2%) were previously diagnosed with diabetes. No correlation was also found between HbA1c values and lipids profile. After dividing patients into subgroups depending on stage of carbohydrate metabolism disorders we did not notice any statistically significant differences in lipid profile in them (p = 0,005).

Conclusion: Autoimmune disorders can co-exist and can present in close succession.With Type 1 diabetes and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, other autoimmune diseases e.g. adrenal insufficiency,vitiligo,hypoparathyroidism,candidiasis,pernicious anemia etc. can appear later on,as part of one of the polyglandular syndromes. Method design: Screening test based on teleophthalmology. The patient is recruited in primary care consultations and is included in the detection program with a procedure based on the capture of images by non-medical personnel, the images are sent electronically to the reading center, where they are evaluated by a team of opticians and ophthalmologists who are responsible for checking if there is any pathology; and if so, its severity, the frequency of its follow-up or, if necessary, the referral to the ophthalmologist at your hospital for a more complete study or the establishment of treatment are established.Setting: Urban health area, en Castilla y Le\u00f3n (Spain) Population and Sample:Diabetic patients (n = 3738).Time period: From November 2, 2017 to October 31, 2019.

Articles in language other than English were excluded. Results: Evidence has shown that Well-designed progressively increasing intense of exercise programs improves cardiorespiratory function and consequently blood glucose levels. Also improves body composition, reduces fat mass, cholesterol and triglycerides and can reduce medication and insulin administration and even inhibit it. Resistance exercise is even more effective when it is combined with diet in overweight individuals.

Introduction: Diabetes is a growing public health concern, with a prevalence two times higher among elderly people compared to middle and younger ages and an estimate of 1/3 of geriatric population affected [1] . Complications of diabetes develop rapidly or over time and are the result of microvasulopathy affecting several systems and leading to events such as heart attack, stroke, kidney and ocular damage [2] . Methods: A PubMed search was conducted in English language for the last 6 years, in order to investigate and highlight various ocular complications associated with Diabetes in elderly population. Results: The hallmark of diabetes regarding the eye is diabetic retinopathy (DR). Loss of pericytes leads to capillary damage and eventual break in the inner blood-retinal barrier. DR may be proliferative or non-proliferative and the main risk factors are longer duration of diabetes and poor metabolic control. Concomitant diseases, commonly encountered in elder patients such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking and obesity may have an adverse effect on DR. Macular edema, ischemic maculopathy, vitreous hemorrhage and retinal detachment are the main sequelae of DR [2] . Visual impairment in the diabetic patient may also be attributed to corneal pathology such as punctate or neurotrophic keratitis, tear film abnormalities and endothelial changes. Finally, glaucoma risk is higher in diabetic patients as they are more susceptible to the development of Primary Open Angle Glaucoma and its progression or they can develop neovascular glaucoma secondary to proliferative DR [3] . Key conclusions: Untreated diabetes can result in visual impairment which can further negatively impact the quality of life. Routine eye examination is essential, since 90% of vision loss from diabetes can be prevented. National University of Ireland Galway, 2 University Hospital Galway Introduction: Management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the geriatric population is both complex and nuanced. The American Diabetic Association has dedicated recommendations in this area. Without a systematic approach, and within the time restraints of a busy clinic, areas considered in these guidelines are not always addressed. We sought to audit our practice in Galway University Hospital (GUH) in relation to these guidelines. Method: Consecutive entries in the diabetic electronic patient record were reviewed. Entries were considered for inclusion in the audit, if the patient was born between January 1934 and January 1944, was community dwelling, and had been reviewed in the previous year for T2DM. Areas reviewed were: Assessment of geriatric domains, meeting HbA1C targets, seeking hypoglycaemic episodes and considering deintensification of treatment if a patient meets criteria. Results: 200 records were reviewed. The mean patient age was 79.7 years (SD = 2.7). 56% were male (n = 111). Assessment of geriatric domains was considered in only 22% of cases (n = 44). The mean HbA1c was 61.8 mmol/mol (SD = 15), with 67.5% (n = 135) either at or below target. Hypoglycaemia was sought in 75% of cases (n = 150), but regime deintensification was considered in only 17.4% of cases (n = 32). Conclusion: Certain areas that may impact quality of life and outcomes appear to be neglected in our current model of busy undifferentiated T2DM clinics. Exploring education, a dedicated diabetic geriatric assessment form, or dedicated diabetic geriatric clinics may be options to explore. Background: Vitamin D deficiency is increasing worldwide. Despite high ultraviolet irradiation in southern European countries, vitamin D levels were found to be low in older adults. Doctors are a crucial source of information to their patients and therefore this study attempts to assess knowledge and attitudes of Maltese doctors on sunlight exposure with regard to vitamin D deficiency. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of all Maltese doctors was carried out, excluding doctors that do not come into frequent contact with older adults and doctors who were not currently practicing/residing in Malta. In order to reach a 95% confidence interval with a margin of error of 5% a total of 847 medical practitioners were included. The survey was disseminated via an online link sent by e-mail and a hard copy via post. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. Results: The final population included 138 participants. 82.6% believe that exposure to outdoor sunlight is the main source of vitamin D in Malta. 44.2% managed vitamin D deficiency by giving advice to receive more natural sunlight. In summer 73.9% advice their patients to use sun protection at all times during the peak UV index. During the winter, 25.4% still suggest to use sun protection at all times during peak UV index, with 19.6% either giving the advice to use sun protection most of the time during peak UV index, but to S186",

Is is also linked with multiple chronic conditions such as metabolic and cardiovascular disease, overall morbidity and mortality. It is important to create social connectedness through which one has constructive relationships with individuals and groups. Many systematic reviews confirm that the most effective interventions are group interventions aimed at increasing skills, strengthening social support, increasing social interactions and socio cognitive training. They are more effective when their programs are individualised, adapted culturally to the participants, when they aim to promote a healthy active lifestyle and when done on a regular routinely basis (2, 3) . As an example we can refer to the multi-ethnic and multi-cultural ageing society of the Mauritian Republic, ranked highest in the African region (42th position) in the Global Age Watch Index 2015 measuring social and economic wellbeing of elderly (4, 5). The seniors can become engaged in geriatric interventions through free service non governmental associations (International Federation of Associations for elderly FIAPA and Alzheimer Association Mauritius, Third Age Mauritius University) and parastatal bodies (Senior Citizen Council of Mauritius comprising of 850 senior groups working for their well-being). The geriatric interventions in socialization include recreational and physical activites, various activities in retirement homes, life long learning and education, geriatric talks, cognitive stimulation in day care centers for Alzheimer patients. By promoting adherence to socialization a society of geriatrics and gerontology is thus emerging in the Indian Ocean region where health care professionals can share knowledge, organise congresses. Hence, it has a facilitating role on geriatric interventions in terms of training of care partners and continuous medical education, in raising awareness on geriatric topics towards different sectors of the community and in ensuring that government policy is on the right track (6).",

            "text": "A cross-professional qualification tool to optimized pharmaceutical care for geriatric patients (OAV) Introduction: The progress of modern medicine makes a longer life possible. At the same time, the combination of drugs can trigger serious diseases, so called adverse drug events (ADEs). Especially in the case of elderly patients with multiple morbidities and correspondingly extensive medication plans the dimensions of these events are greatly underestimated. In nursing care, 60 to 80 percent of these events are due to a lack of monitoring of therapy among other things [1] . The aim of the project OAV is to prevent or reduce ADEs through interprofessional team-partnership. Through interprofessional collaboration it is possible to increase medication safety in the long term [2] . This means that the various disciplines must expand their usual action patterns and cooperate. For this purpose, a cross-professional qualification tool was developed that builds on the previous experiences and resources of all actors involved (nursing staff, physicians and pharmacists) and sustainably increases the competence of the actors to guarantee treatment safety. Method: To determine the contents of the qualification tool, a document analysis was carried out. Existing curricula and corresponding professional articles/books served as a basis. The results were evaluated in several discussion rounds and finally condensed into a curriculum. The qualification tool is finally composed of six modules. One module comprises four chapters in which the technical and social competences are built up step by step.",

Recently, LUMC-researchers found that in undergraduate medical students, intrinsic motivation influences research involvement. The aim of our study is to examine perception and motivation of residents in elderly care medicine to conduct research and to evaluate attitudes around the mandatory WLO study. Methods: An educational ethics committee approved this mixedmethods study (NVMO: 2009.7.7). Residents of three groups that started March 2018, March 2019, and September 2019 were asked to participate. A questionnaire included validated perception and motivation scales with response options ranging 1 to 7. Qualitative interviews which also examined attitude regarding the WLO study were underpinned by interpretative phenomenological analysis. Results: Of 38 residents, 23 questionnaires were obtained (15 from female residents). The mean score on perceptions of research was 4.1 (SD 0.8), intrinsic motivation 4.8 (SD 1.0), and extrinsic motivation 4.3 with a higher SD of 1.4. There was also diversity in attitudes concerning research and the WLO study, related to any previous experiences in conducting research. Eight interviews indicated that doing research was experienced as difficult, in particular statistical analyses of the WLO data. Key conclusions: Residents show diversity of attitudes, and we found low motivation to conduct medical research compared with undergraduate students. This knowledge will be used to improve the mandatory WLO study.

Methods: Internet mapping and systematic documentation to develop a list of policy recommendations towards improving and safeguarding LGBT+ people. Seven countries (UK, Spain, Italy, Cyprus, Romania, Denmark, Germany) co-work to create an easy to navigate resource with information about legislations/guidance/policies. Finally, development of the training courses with tools and methodologies to strengthen theoretical and practical knowledge and skills on LGBT+ issues, and to affect attitudes and prejudices in the relationship with LGBT+ patients/users who ask for psychological support or health care. Results: There is a growing awareness of the need for LGBT+ competency training to ensure that the health and social care services offered to LGBT+ people are suitable and gender sensitive. Emerging lines of inquiry to improve health include populations such as LGBT+ veterans, reproductive health and parenting, intimate partner violence, sexual minority persons living with chronic illness, disability, etc. Key conclusions: In some cases, healthcare professionals do not know how to approach and provide treatment to LGBT+ persons and admit their need for specific training. The program aims to improve this environment, with observance of human rights and free from all forms of discrimination and violence. A new culturally competent and compassionate LGBT+ curriculum will be developed and delivered through a MOOC for health and social care teachers/workers and learners worldwide. Introduction: To know the prevalence of functional decline in hospitalized elderly patients and implement an early mobilization strategy, with the participation of patients, caregivers and health workers. Method: Interdisciplinary team intervention. The prospective study enrolled patients admitted to the acute geriatric unit, between April and June 2018. Patients excluded: those in palliative care, with severe dementia and with Barthel Index: \\ 20. Patients were divided into three levels: Level A: able to walk, B: able to transfer to a chair, C: not able to stand. A complete evaluation of mobility was conducted, during admission, hospitalization and discharge. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were collected. Results: Creation of posters to identify mobility level, multicomponent exercise protocols and mobilization activities for each level, design of mobility promotion posters and brochures. 32 patients out of 102 admitted to the study period were included. Average age 86.6. Average length of stay: 9.8 days, Barthel index median at the admission: 62.2 and at the discharge: 57.6, Mini Nutritional Assessment Short Form: 9.22. Mobility Level Registration: 90%. Patients and/or family members who received brochure:80%. Functional decline associated with hospitalization: 31.2% (70% male, 50% older than 90 years old, 70% institutionalized, 50% moderate dependence, 80% dementia, 60% malnourished, 90% delirium) Conclusions: The establishment of an early mobilization strategy is possible with the involvement of the health workers, patients, and caregivers.\u2022 Functional decline among hospitalized elderly patients is common but with an early intervention, this can be reduced. Objective: Being active and history of physical activity (PA) habits are nowadays recognized as important predictor to prevent physical aging. However, it is unclear if sex or age influence this relationship and if a sub-type of voluntary PA is more efficient to maintain healthy aging. Thus, we aim to assess the impact of the last 5-years of PA level and functional capacities and body composition among elderly people. Material and methods: Functional capacities using different validated tests (i.e. grip strength, Timed Up and Go, sit-to-stand, muscle power, alternate step test, leg extension, VO2 max), body composition (fat & fat-free masses) using DXA were assessed. Last 5-years of global (total) and specific (aerobic, resistance or body and mind) PA levels (duration) were obtained through a questionnaire. Multiple regressions, adjusted on age, sex and BMI, were performed to assess the relationship between past PA level and body composition or functional capacities. Sub-group analysis, according to the sex and age (\\ 65 year vs. C 65 year) were also performed using Pearson Correlations. Results: 525 subjects (61.7 \u00b1 8.1 year; women: 68.9%; BMI = 26.4 \u00b1 4.8 kg/m 2 ) were enrolled. After adjustment on confounding factors, past level of PA has no impact on functional capacities and body composition, regardless of sex. Among people under 65 years, there is no relationship between time spent on total physical activity and functional capacities or body composition. However, our study found a significant correlation between total physical activity and balance (r = 0.19; P = 0.01), alternate-step test (r = 0.24; P = 0.02) and VO2 max (r = 0.19; P = 0.02) in people aged 65 and over. More precisely, the time spent on cardio and resistance activities influence balance (r = 0.16; P = 0.03 and r = 0.15; P = 0.04, respectively) in this age category. Conclusion: Our results highlights that PA history has little or no influence on functional capacities and body composition in healthy aging population.",

Materials and methods: A 5 day Geriatric Ultrasound traininig program was carried out addressed to the Gps,with theoretical and practical activities in the department of Geriatrics.10 groups of GPs were set up each of 3 people,10 tutors were used,who carried out teaching activities.

Some clinical situations have been examined,both from an ultrasound and from a clinical point of view:chronic heart failure, liver cirrhosis, chronic renal failure, urinary retention, acute renal failure, jaundice, weight loss, lymphadenomegaly and fever, severe anemia, digestive haemorrhage, abdominal pain, intestinal obstruction, digestive haemorrhage, hematuria, abdominal volume increase, pulsating abdominal mass, neck mass, pelvic mass, rectorrhagia, metrorrhagia, hydrocele. Results: After the 5 day training program,all GPs were much more motivated in dealing with acute and chronic practical problems of geriatric patients.The US performed in selected patients in relation to the clinical problem and symptoms frequently encountered in clinical practice, has allowed the correlation of symptoms,diagnostic hypotheses and ultrasound findings. The Gps easily formulated diagnostic conclusions,prescribed the further diagnostic procedure or subsequent therapy with high appropriateness. A questionnaire proposed to GPs 6 months after the ultrasound training program, allows to confirm that the approach to the clinical problems of the elderly patient, examined with ultrasound in the training program,allows to observe a better outpatient management.The numbers of specialist consultations and of hospitalizations were reduced by 30% compared to the usual management methods before attending the Geriatric Ultrasound training program.",

This included a minority of UK healthcare workers who faced a complete change in working, at a time when the pressure upon both hospitals and colleagues was set to increase. The feeling of responsibility permeates all aspects of a doctor's life and hence doctors cannot simply leave their working identity at the hospital [2] . We describe our experience as a small cohort of ''shielded'' doctors from a large Teaching Hospital.

It requires the co-operative input of physicians, nurses, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and more. Their effective collaboration is vital to improve overall health outcomes in the geriatric population. The underlying concept of inter-professional education (IPE) is that a workforce trained in an inter-professional environment will be better equipped to work within the multidisciplinary team (MDT), leading to improved outcomes and care of older patients. During recent years, the Geratology department of Oxford University Hospital, in conjunction with the Oxford Medical School, and Oxford Brooks University have been establishing a curriculum of IPE and teaching using case-based discussions involving students from a multitude of training programs. The COVID-19 pandemic and its social distancing requirements have significantly disrupted student teaching. With little hope of resuming normal face-to-face teaching programs in the near future, we have been evaluating how to safely deliver IPE in the current climate. Methods of distanced IPE teaching used by other institutions include online seminars, presentations, teaching modules, discussion forums for case studies, virtual clinic and video conferencing and live grand rounds. In the upcoming months we aim to restart Geratology IPE teaching using a modified teaching curriculum. We intend to use strategies such as prerecorded communication skills scenarios with professional actors and online presentations, with live student participation. This is with the understanding that flexibility in plans will be required. The outcome of our socially distanced teaching will be evaluated by students and educators.",

This study was conducted to assess the feasibility of a video-based remote coaching system with multimodal comprehensive care methodology training to reduce the care burden of family caregivers of people with dementia at home. Methods: A pre-post prospective study was designed. The participants were six family caregivers. First, they received on-site training for a multimodal comprehensive care methodology. Subsequently, participants recorded their care at home on an iPad and sent to the coach online. The video was evaluated by the innovative system which recorded the comments of the coach, and simultaneously drew recommended movements of caregivers with arrows which was recorded on the same video. The participants reviewed the video and practised at home. The duration of coaching was three months. Feasibility was analysed using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) score, semistructured interviews, and questionnaires. Results: Four participants completed the three-months follow-up. The reason for the dropout was a difficulty in using an iPad. The ZBIscore decreased (41.3-40 .0, P = 0.95), but was not statistically significant.

Design: A systematic review with a narrative summary.Setting and participants: Residents in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. Methods: We searched PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane, Scopus, and Google Scholar, references of known articles, previous reviews and recent volumes of key journals. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) were included for the review. Methodological quality was assessed. Results: The search yielded 932 articles after removing the duplicates. Of them, 16 cluster RCTs fulfilled inclusion criteria for analyses. There was a great variety in the interventions in respect to learning methods, intensity, complexity and length of staff training. Most interventions featured other elements besides staff training. In the six high quality trials only one showed reduction in hospitalizations, whereas among six moderate quality trials two suggested reduction in hospitalizations. None of the high quality trials showed effects on residents' QOL or QOD. Staff reported improved QOD in one moderate quality trial. Conclusion and implications: Irrespective of means of staff training, there were surprisingly little effects of education on residents' QOL, QOD or burdensome hospitalizations. Further studies are needed to explore the reasons behind these findings Introduction: The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has impacted healthcare institutions worldwide leading to uncertainty and disruption among medical schools for students on clinical placement. Many universities, including our institution, paused all clerkships for several reasons; for safety of students and hospital patients given the contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2, cancellation of procedures, active transition to telehealth services and limited stocks of personal protective equipment (PPE). In lieu of the clinical geriatric placement model, all teaching was transitioned to case-based collaborative, online sessions. Our aim was to determine the efficacy of this model and its acceptability to students when compared with the traditional model.",

Following the COVID-19 outbreak, traditional face-to-face geratology teaching was halted. Lecturers were therefore required to develop and deliver remote teaching sessions through alternative methods. We aimed to compare students' opinions on the novel, online geratology teaching provision with existing traditional teaching methods. Prior to COVID-19, feedback on geratology teaching was collected using both paper and online forms. Following the cessation of face-to-face teaching, sessions were converted to virtual formats: lectures were recorded, small group teaching transferred to online platforms and quizzes adapted into online assessments. Feedback was collected using online forms and mixed method comparisons were made. The comparison will include student attendance and the ability to achieve the desired learning outcomes. We know from the students that, although they appreciated the flexibility allowed by online learning, some reported reduced ability to maintain attention to topic matters in comparison to in-class lectures. We will also analyse the impact on the students' ability to ask questions and for teachers to provide immediate feedback, which may not be easily replicated using pre-recorded, online platforms.We now aim to incorporate a combination of pre-recorded and live online teaching sessions to meet all desired learning outcomes, as well as to ensure students can engage in thoughtful discussions and critically assess their academic progress. We also aim to provide pre-recorded sessions with geratology patients in place of face-to-face bedside teaching sessions.

Results: Out of 31 participants (17 physicians, 12 nurses, 2 health visitors), 31 (100%) filled in the first, 30 (97%) the second, and 25 (81%) the third questionnaire. Significant improvements were reported in familiarization with the frailty syndrome (p = 0.041) and in self-perception of knowledge and skills to detect (p \\ 0.001) and manage (p \\ 0.001) frailty, that were also sustained 3 months afterwards (p = 0.001 and p = 0.003 respectively). Significant change was observed in the attitude that frailty is an inevitable consequence of aging (p = 0.007) and in the reported frequency of application of screening (but not management) strategies, 3 months following the workshop compared to baseline (p = 0.014). Level of agreement that systematic screening for frailty was unfeasible in their daily practice was 2.4/5 three months after versus 1.6/5 before the workshop (p = 0.006).

Our research aims to identify the qualities of an anti-burn-out space within the elderly care institutions. Methods: We used focus group method, 4 participants working in elderly care institutions (MD geriatrician & psychiatrist, psychologist, scientific researcher biologist & physical therapy assistant, physical therapist) and one facilitator (architect). During 1 hour 17 relevant questions were asked on the issue of burn-out which concerned: work volume, needs of breaks/relaxation for each professional, preferences in terms of relaxation activities and the architectural qualities of a relaxation space at work. Results: The professionals responded that they work between 5 and 12 hours per day and fatigue occurs from 7 hours onwards. All professionals considered that activity with the patient is greatly influenced by the quality of the space in which it takes place. Professionals have opted for both passive and active relaxation. At none of participants' workplaces exist spaces dedicated to staff relaxation. Natural light, colours, natural soundcapes are preferred. A relaxation space is intended to be different from the one professionals work in, sometimes tonic, cheerful, sometimes quiet and comfortable, with areas of interaction but also with the possibility of being alone, connected to internet or practising mindfulness techniques on individual basis. Key conclusions: The research clearly revealed the need for spaces specifically dedicated for staff relaxation although the claims proved to be quite small. These suggest insufficient education about space potential in preventing burn-out among healthcare professionals.",

The communication skills course for medical students addresses these issues. Methods: The course was delivered with the help of professional actors and focused on non-verbal communication; managing a triadic interview with a patient, relative/carer, and clinician; and managing behaviour that challenges. 89 students attended the course in January and February 2020. Both students and actors evaluated the course via anonymous written feedback. Quantitative and qualitative data were analysed. Results: All students provided feedback. Average response regarding usefulness was 4.78/5. 78% of students ranked 5 points considering the session very useful. As for ''how well was teaching conducted'', the average score was 4.87/5 with 86% students scoring 5 points. Students indicated addressing carers' concerns and learning deescalating techniques as main learning points. Students gave no negative comments and suggested more time for scenarios, individual feedback and debriefing. The actors identified more areas for improvement. They were concerned about responsibility allocated to them when working with less experienced facilitators, about short time allocation for each scenario and for reflection after scenarios. Actors suggested encouraging students to express their thoughts in between role-plays and querying about previous experience with dementia. The lack of discussion of broad range of approaches being discussed was also identified. Conclusion: Although feedback in education usually focuses on students and facilitators, exploring actors' perspective may highlight further areas for improvement of future teaching sessions.",

Approximately fourth part of admitted geriatric patients is from residential homes. Especially in Czech residential homes is not the palliative care fully developped. We were searching for strategies how to support residential homes in the palliative care. Methods: Geriatric patients admitted to the hospital especially from residential homes are examined not only with Comprehensive geriatric assessment, but also with NECPAL CCOMS-ICO 2 tool, Palliative Prognostic Score (PPS) and Palliative Prognostic Index (PPI). Patients with the need of palliative care and their relatives are discussed on diagnosis, prognosis, advance care planing and their needs. Results: We started close cooperation with 14 residential homes and prepared for them individual palliative care plans for their residents who were admitted to the hospital. We started educate nurses and general practitioners in these residential homes in the palliative care. As a first result of our work was significant decrease of readmission of dying patients because of better terminal care in residential homes. Key conclusion: Close cooperation between acute geriatric care in hospital and residential homes in the field of geriatric palliative care and education could be the way of increasing the quality of life of the palliative geriatric patients.",

Paramedics are often the frontline staff encountering such patients at a time of crisis and must decide what treatment to offer and ultimately whether to convey to hospital or not. This study was designed to find out their perceptions in managing such patients, including at end of life, through advance care plans. Method: A survey was created and copies left in Croydon University Hospital's Emergency Department for paramedics to voluntarily fill, with a total of 52 completed surveys collected. Results: Paramedics find ACPs helpful but only if they are detailed enough-only 27% of paramedics thought they were good enough ''most of the time''. Paramedics value, specifically, advice on how to manage expected symptoms, baseline observations, baseline behaviour, prognosis and contact details of services involved in patients' care. Hospice advice in-hours and community rapid response were favoured as the best services in managing end of life at home, whilst hospice out-of-hours and General Practice (GP) out-of-hours ranked the worst. This was reflected in which services required the most improvement, with hospice out-of-hours and GP out-of-hours coming out as the highest in need for improvement. Conclusion: ACPs need to be detailed and specific to be of most use. There may be a need for improvement to both hospice and GP out-ofhours services to help end-of-life care in the community.",

However, most of these patients are long-suffering, at a terminal stage of their disease and negative to any transportation outside home. Ultrasound-guided thoracentesis could be a key palliative intervention for the management of this vulnerable population at home. Methods: Two patients (69 and 79 years old) with metastatic breast cancer, suffering from severe, recurrent, symptomatic MPEs, required thoracentesis, but refused to leave their house. After written consent, an indwelling pulmonary catheter (IPC) (Pleuracan-B. Braun) was inserted at home under portable ultrasound guidance (Chison ECO 5). Results: In one patient the IPC remained for 10 days and chemical pleurodesis with sterile talc powder (4 grams of graded talc) was attempted. Subsequently, she remained free of respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, chest discomfort or heaviness, cough) for the last 2 months of her life. In the second patient, the IPC remained for 15 days. After removal of the IPC, no new thoracentesis was required thereafter, probably due to autopleurodesis. The patient did not experience any severe respiratory distress until the end of her life 70 days later. In both patients, after IPC removal, lung sliding could not be detected with thoracic ultrasonography. Conclusion: Palliative thoracentesis and pleurodesis under ultrasound guidance could be safely and successfully performed at home from a skilled staff without need for transportation of the patient.",

The hospital report and associated documents should be provided at discharge to community professionals by secure messaging. We wanted to know whether this approach was feasible for patients leaving acute geriatrics or rehabilitation care from our French teaching hospital. Methods: During a 5 months period (November 2019-March 2020), for each patient who benefited from a medication reconciliation, were recorded the general practitioner and community pharmacist identities and the existence of a secure messaging. Then, we were able to calculate the percentage of professionals who could benefit from a secure information transmission at discharge. Results: 493 patients benefited from a medication reconciliation. The general practitioner and community pharmacist identities were filled respectively for 414 (83.9%) and 366 (74.2%) patients. 267 (64.5%) general practitioners and 222 (60.7%) pharmacists had secure messaging. Key conclusions: According to an extraction from ASIP Health data, 12.2% of French physicians and 52.1% of French pharmacists, all specialties combined, had secure messaging in December 2019. The results of our study testify that the secure messaging deployment is good in our region, in particular through the training sessions organization with hospital and community health managers since 2017. However, it remains perfectible in order to allow secure and fast transmission of information at discharge. Introduction: Advance care planning (ACP) allows people to plan for their future care needs. It is important but underutilised in noncancer conditions, such as Parkinson's disease. We aimed to explore the experiences of ACP for people with Parkinson's disease, atypical Parkinsonian disorders, their family carers and healthcare professionals. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of online databases in April 2019; using a narrative synthesis approach, thematic analysis and tabulation to synthesise the findings. Results: We identified 507 articles and 27 were included. There were five themes: (1) What is involved in ACP discussions? Discussions included a wide range of topics, but coverage was patchy. (2) When and how are ACP discussions initiated? It was unclear when it should be initiated, some patients wanted early discussions, but others did not. It depends on patients' readiness and professional's willingness to discuss the topic; which often resulted in discussions first taking place in response to a crisis, such as a hospital admission. (3) Barriers to ACP. This included a lack of information and knowledge related to palliative care by both patients and professionals, and practical barriers such as time in consultations. (4) The role of healthcare professionals. Access and collaboration with palliative care services and multi-disciplinary teams led to clear plans. (5) The role of the family carer. Carers were a facilitator but could be a barrier if emotionally burdened. Key conclusions: This evidence was used to highlight eight effective components to support optimal ACP in Parkinsonian disorders, which can inform best practice.",

Currently, such a multi-faceted approach to VCF in the elderly is thought to be uncommon in Japan. We investigate the impact of co-management of VCF by hospitalists compared with orthopedic treatment alone. Methods: In a retrospective single-center Japanese observational study, we assessed patients over 65 years old who were admitted with VCF. Usual orthopedic care (UOC) was provided between January and August in 2017 and 2018, and between January and August in 2019, patients received comprehensive hospitalist care (CHC).

However, we have noted gaps in services for those discharged in our hospital's catchment area. Method: We retrospectively reviewed ED notes of patients aged C 65 discharged from ED with a fall in November 2019 in a university teaching hospital. Results: Of 123 older patients discharged after a fall, 27 (21.9 %) were seen by FITT (Frailty Intervention Team); 18 patients (14.6%) were referred to community falls services. There were 52 patients (42%) discharged out of hours. Patients discharged out of hours are not seen by FITT. Fractures were sustained in 29 patients (23.6%). Only 3 patients with fractures (10.3%) were referred to services. Services for early identification and intervention in patients suffering osteoporotic fractures are lacking. Community falls services are urban centric with 44% being outside the catchment area. Conclusion: FITT functions as the cornerstone of multidisciplinary integrated care in our hospital. We believe this is an effective model of care. However, services and staffing must be commensurate with the needs of the increasing number of patients with falls. Patients discharged out of hours and patients living outside of catchment areas need improved services. Falls pathways must employ early identification and community intervention for patients suffering osteoporotic fractures. As the population in Ireland and in Europe ages, such effective pathways of integrated care become even more important.",

Falls were multifactorial; frailty in 41% (21/51) and postural hypotension in 24% (12/51) were considered the most contributing factors. Discussion: The number of patients who had fractures related to the urinary bladder could be underestimated as some older people with dementia were found on the floor with no reliable history; many of them could have been going to the bathroom. There are many reasons why elderly people might fall while going to the bathroom including postural hypotension, rushing to avoid urge incontinent, hypnotic or extrapyramidal side effects of medications, not using the mobility aids and poor lighting conditions. Conclusion: In this study 14% of falls resulting in hip fracture was attributed to the urinary bladder. Urinary bladder symptoms are a frequently forgotten risk factor for falls and fractures. To reduce the risk in this group of patients, urinary tract symptoms need to be explored, diagnosed and treated. Medications; specially antihypertensives and CNS active drugs should be rationalized and diuretics are to be avoided if possible.",

Methods: Descriptive study conducted in the Orthogeriatrics Unit from the University Hospital Ramon y Cajal, February-April 2019. Demographic and preinjury characteristics of the patients in each of the FRAIL categories were described. Results: In a cohort of 127 patients (mean 87 \u00b1 6 years), 73% were females and 78% lived in dwelling houses. The pertrochanteric was the most frequent fracture. Evaluation of the patient using FRAIL Questionnaire showed that 50% were frail and 37% were prefrail. Most of the frail patients were dependent; showed malnutrition, major comorbidities, polypharmacy and frequent alterations in the iron kinetics profile. Blood transfusion was used in 35% of these patients, and the haemoglobin levels were comparable between the admission and after three months (12,4 \u00b1 1,8 to 12,6 \u00b1 1,5 g/dL). Alternatively, intravenous iron infusion was the prevalent treatment given to 30% of the prefrail patients. Similarly, haemoglobin levels did not change significantly (12,6 \u00b1 1,8 to 12,3 \u00b1 2,2 g/dL). Linear regression models adjusted by frailty category, were used to examine the association between the chosen treatment and the haemoglobin levels, measured during the study. Conclusion: in this particular cohort of patients, the prevalence of frailty is high and blood transfusion were preferably prescribed. However, intravenous iron infusion was frequently used in the prefrail group. The analysis performed concludes that haemoglobin levels do not change regardless the frailty status, independently of the chosen treatment.",

Patients, notes and electronic records were reviewed; data were downloaded on excel sheet and analysed using descriptive statistics. Results: 377 hip fracture patients were admitted in the study period, of whom 51 patients (14%) had falls related to the bathroom. Of these 20% (10/51) male and 80% (41/51) female with average age of 81. 6 and 82 .8 years respectively. 51% (26/51) had urinary incontinence. 51% (26/51) had hypertension and 31% (16/51) had osteoarthritis. 67% (34/51) were on [ 4 drugs, 55% (28/51) were on antihypertensives, 22% (11/51) were on diuretics and 31% (16/51) were on an antidepressant. Falls were multifactorial; frailty in 41% (21/51) and postural hypotension in 24% (12/51) were considered the most contributing factors. Discussion: The number of patients who had fractures related to the urinary bladder could be underestimated as some older people with dementia were found on the floor with no reliable history; many of them could have been going to the bathroom. There are many reasons why elderly people might fall while going to the bathroom including postural hypotension, rushing to avoid urge incontinence, hypnotic or extrapyramidal side effects of medications, not using the mobility aids and poor lighting conditions. Conclusion: In this study 14% of falls resulting in hip fracture was attributed to the urinary bladder. Urinary bladder symptoms are a frequently forgotten risk factor for falls and fractures. To reduce the risk in this group of patients, urinary tract symptoms need to be explored, diagnosed and treated. Medications; specially antihypertensives and CNS active drugs should be rationalized and diuretics are to be avoided if possible.",

In order to optimize care, the Valais Hospital in Switzerland created a pilot orthogeriatric unit in 2018. This innovative unit, managed by a geriatrician who functions within the orthopedic department, allows timely, standardized management of geriatric syndromes. Methods: Prospective cohort study from January 1, 2018 through March 1, 2020. Inclusion criteria were hip fracture among patients C 70 years, or any elective orthopedic surgery C 75 years. Primary outcome measures were postoperative complications and mortality. Results: We enrolled 356 patients, mean age 84 years, 77% female. The majority were classified as ''vulnerable'' health status, and 1/3 were ''fit''. Forty percent had cognitive impairment. Twenty-six percent had osteoporosis, only 1/5 of whom were treated. Malnutrition was prevalent (NRS 5: 22%). We treated 287 hip fractures (45% neck, 48% intertrochanteric, 7% periprosthetic). Mean time to operation was 33.5 hours. The most common orthopedic complication was screw displacement (8.8%). The most frequent geriatric complications were delirium (17.7%), urinary retention (13.3%) and obstipation (6.6%), along with medical complications that included acute renal failure (23%), urinary and pulmonary infections (21.9%) and heart failure (13.7%). Postoperative mortality rate was 5.9% (17/287). Key conclusions: In a vulnerable population, our approach showed a low postoperative mortality rate (5.9%) and a short pre-operative time (33.5 hours). Perioperative complications are frequent, and are often due to non-orthopedic problems, thereby justifying early geriatrician involvement.",

The non-parametric Mann-Whitney test showed a statistical difference in FES-I, indicating that women are more afraid of a possible fall (U = 227.00, p = 0.045, _ X = 29.90, SD = \u00b1 11.15). Finally, the Spearman's non-parametric r control showed a positive correlation between FES-I with sex (r = 0.252, p \\ 0.05) and number of falls (r = 0.306, p \\ 0.05), while a negative correlation was found with self-perception of health (r = -0.300, p \\ 0.05), falls(r = -0.270), p \\ 0.05) and vision problems(r = -0.419, p \\ 0.01). Conclusions: The study found important risk factors of fear of falls, indicating the need of the systematic education of the elderly to prevent it. Introduction: There is concern regarding adverse effects of antihypertensive treatment, including falls and subsequent fractures, especially hip fractures. As frailty is increasingly recognised as an important risk factor for adverse outcomes, we examined its relationship to fracture rates in older patients after starting antihypertensives. Methods: Using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), we identified participants over 65-years old starting a first-line antihypertensive medication. Using deficits identified in CPRD we classified patient-level frailty as 'Fit', 'Mild', 'Moderate' or 'Severe' using the Electronic Frailty Index. We calculated the rate of fractures by frailty level and fracture site, and determined the rate ratio (RR) of first fracture by frailty level, adjusting for confounding. We conducted sensitivity analyses to additionally adjust for ethnicity, deprivation, and bisphosphonate use. Results: 44% of participants were classified as mildly frail or greater , but frail participants experienced 58% of all fractures, and 63% of hip fractures. The whole cohort showed a crude rate of 14.1 fractures/ 1000 person-years , with 4.5 hip fractures/1000 person-years. In severe frailty, this rises to 51.0 fractures/1000 person-years, and 17.7 hip fractures/1000 person-years. After adjustment for confounding, increasing frailty was associated with greater rate of any fracture, reaching RR 2.85 (95% confidence interval 2.43-3.33) for severe frailty versus fit. Results were unchanged in sensitivity analyses. Key conclusions: Frailty and fracture are both common in older participants who start antihypertensive medications. Increasing frailty was positively associated with increased rates of fracture. Clinicians need awareness of this relationship to consider fracture risk assessment and prevention in these patients.",

Results from a geriatric patients sample in the clinic for fall prevention, osteoporosis and sarcopenia (C.F.P.O.S) of the General Univer was also recorded and the ANTICHOLINERGIC-COGNITIVE-BURDEN Scale score (ACBscore) was calculated. The balance was evaluated with the Mini-Balance-Evaluation-Systems-Test (Mini-BESTest). Results: Linear Bivariate Correlation did not indicate a statistical strong relationship between vitamin B12 level, Mini BESTest score and the number of falls and fractures. A statistical negative correlation was found between blood level of vitamin D3 and the number of falls and fractures (rs (93) = -0.274, p = 0.008 \\ 0.05). Multiple Linear Regression analysis, using the Enter method, indicate that from the studied factors, vitamin D3 can predict with statistical significance the number of falls and fractures(p = 0.028 \\ 0.05) and that ACBscore can predict with statistical significance the Hand Grip values levels (p = 0.022 \\ 0.05). Conclusion: In the present study vitamin D3 appears to influence falls and fractures in contrast to vitamin B12. The use of anticholinergic drugs affects muscle strength negatively, but not falls and fractures. A larger sample of participants and further studies are needed to confirm our findings.",

Methods: We performed cognitive tests assessing executive functions (Trial Making Test-B, Digit Span Backward, Digit Span Forward), questionnaires measuring psychological features (Hamilton Anxiety Scale and Back Depression Inventory), physical performance evaluation (Short Physical Performance Battery and handgrip strength), evaluation of 10-year probability of major and hip fractures (Fracture Risk Assessment tool -FRAX), bone mineral density (BMD) measurement (Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry at lumbar spine and femoral neck). Results: Participants (n = 60, mean age 66 \u00b1 7.99 year) showed a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score C 24. Trial Making Test B score (r = -0.25) and Digit Span Backward (r = -0.34) were associated with FRAX score for major fractures; the FRAX score for hip fracture was associated with handgrip strength (r = -0.39). BMD at lumbar spine was associated with Digit Span Backward (r = -0.32) and with depression (r = -0.33). After adjustment for age, BMI, MMSE score, handgrip strength, Digit Span Forward score, Verbal Fluency score, Trial Making Test-B score, a multiple regression analysis showed BMI (\u00df = 0.09, SE 0.03, p = 0.013), Beck Depression Inventory score (\u00df = -0.09, SE 0.06, p = 0.04) and Digit Span Backward score (\u00df = 0.55, SE 0.17, p = 0.002) independently predicted lumbar BMD. Key conclusions: Verbal working memory, as assessed by Digit Span Test, was associated with BMD and could contribute to fracture risk prediction in postmenopausal women.",

Methods: Patients above 65 years admitted to the department of orthopedic surgery at Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark with a hip fracture in 2018 were included in the study. Characteristics of the surgery and the anesthesia, demographics, comorbidities, medication, blood pressure values and blood tests were registered. A multivariable analysis was used to determine risk factors, data are presented as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: In total, 300 patients with a mean age of 83 \u00b1 9 years were included. 27% were men. 54% had femoral neck fractures, 42% pertrochanteric fractures and 4% subtrochanteric fractures. 31% of the patients had at least one blood transfusion. The mean preoperative haemoglobin (Hb) was 12.4 \u00b1 1.9 g/dL, the mean postoperative Hb was 10.3 \u00b1 1.8 mmol/L. Predictors for transfusion included cardiac failure (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.5), operation with intramedullary hip screw (IMHS) (OR 4.8, 95% CI 2.7-8.7), lowest intraoperative diastolic blood pressure under 50 mmHg (OR 10.6, 95% CI 1.8-62.7), subtrochanteric fracture (OR 9.3, 95% CI 1.1-79.8) and surgical bleeding above 300 ml (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.5-6.7). Conclusions: In the present cohort, cardiac failure, subtrochanteric fractures, IMHS surgery, intraoperative diastolic blood pressure under 50 mmHg and surgical bleeding above 300 ml were factors associated with blood transfusion. Careful preoperative planning and multidisciplinary management efforts are crucial to reduce the use of postoperative transfusions. Results: After screening 3005 studies for eligibility, 220 studies with 104,638 participants were included. NMA (N = 190 studies) revealed a reduction in number of fallers, compared to usual care, for single interventions exercise (risk ratio (RR) 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77-0.90) and quality improvement strategies (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.83-0.99). Most effective multiple interventions were assistive technology in combination with basic falls risk assessment (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.30-0.90) and assistive technology in combination with quality improvement strategies (RR 0.58; 95% CI 0.41-0.81). Relatively few studies (N = 14) were available specifically for multimorbid participants and the NMA revealed no statistically significant changes in number of fallers compared to usual care. The number of fall-related fractures was reduced by the single interventions basic falls risk assessment (RR 0.60;95%CI 0.39-0.94) and exercise (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.42-0.90). Conclusion: Several single and multiple fall prevention interventions lead to fewer falls. Basic falls risk assessment and exercise lead to fewer fall-related fractures. Few studies have investigated the effect of fall prevention interventions in multimorbid older people, a topic which is of high importance for future research.",

Our aim was to investigate the association between initiation of timolol eye drops and injurious falls in older patients. Methods: We conducted an active comparator, new user cohort study using information on redeemed prescriptions and hospital discharge diagnoses from the Danish nationwide registries. We identified all patients aged C 65 years, who initiated timolol eye drops or topical prostaglandin analogues and matched them in a 1:1 ratio, based on a high-dimensional propensity score. Primary outcome was injurious falls (contusion, wounds, fractures other than hand/feet), within 90 days of first prescription. Secondary outcome was fall-related fractures. We obtained incidence rate ratios (IRR) and incidence rate differences (IRD). Results: We identified 40,420 users of timolol and 55,754 users of prostaglandin analogues; 43% were male and age (median [IQR]) was 75 [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] years. For the unmatched cohort, the IRR of injurious falls was 1.20 (95% CI 0.98-1.49) and IRD was 4 (95% CI 0-8) cases/ 1000 person years for treatment with timolol compared to prostaglandin analogues. In the propensity score matched cohort, we included 28,431 users of timolol and prostaglandin analogues, respectively. The IRR of injurious falls was 0.96 (95% CI 0.73-1.27) and IRD was-1 (95% CI -6 to 5) cases/1000 person years. For fallrelated fractures, the IRR was 1.30 (95% CI 0.96-1.76) and IRD was 4.0 (95%CI -0.5 to 8.4) cases/1000 person years. Conclusions: We found no association between initiation of timolol eye drop treatment and injuries falls in older people. Introduction: Falls and the frailty are geriatric syndromes having common risk factors and adverse health outcomes. Falls weigh the course of the frailty, which leads to an increase in the human dependence on others. To maintain the existing level of autonomy, early detection of risk factors and prevention of falls in the group of the elderly patients with the frailty is necessary. Aim: To evaluate the incidence of falls, their characteristics and functional status in patients with the frailty. Materials and methods: 170 patients with the frailty (78.6 \u00b1 7.8 years, 136 women, 80%) were divided into 2 groups: 1 group -117 (68.8%) patients with falls, 2 group -53 (31.2%) patients without falls. All patients underwent a general clinical examination and a comprehensive geriatric assessment. Charlson Comorbidity Index did not differ significantly in both groups. Results: The incidence of falls was 68.8%. The number of falls is 2.29 \u00b1 1.9; 2 or more falls occurred in 65 (55.6%) people. 97 (82.9%) people had falls earlier, 54.7% of them developed a fear of falls. Fractures were diagnosed in 13.7%. Common risk factors for falls in patients with the frailty were: vitamin D deficiency (86.1%), chronic pain (84.7%), sensory deficiency (69.9%), imbalance (60.2%), inactivity (56.1%) and cognitive impairment (44.9%). In patients with falls, compared with patients without them, the following were lower: muscle strength (16.04 \u00b1 7.5 and 22.4 \u00b1 6.1, p \\ 0.05), walking speed (0.44 \u00b1 0.34 and 0.52 \u00b1 0.22, p \\ 0.05) and SPPB score (3.98 \u00b1 2.1 and 4.9 \u00b1 2.12, p\\0.05). Patients in 1 group were 2 times more likely to have a pronounced dependence (Bartel index). The number of geriatric syndromes was higher in patients of 1 group (8.4 \u00b1 2.4 and 6.2 \u00b1 3.5, p \\ 0.05). Conclusion: Every second patient with the frailty has a fall, which worsens the functional status of the patient and leads to a decrease in autonomy. Falls are prevented in most cases by screening for risk factors and correcting them.",

This study, therefore, aimed to identify potential differences in the relationship between increased body mass index (BMI) and falls between an Asian and two Caucasian populations. Methods: Baseline screening data from the MELoR (Malaysia), FoRMOSA (Germany) and EPIC-NORFOLK (UK) studies were utilized. Basic demographic characteristics, medical history, anthropometric parameters, physical assessments and 12-month falls history were extracted from the existing datasets. Only data for women aged 65 years and over and women aged 70 years and above from the MELoR and EPIC-NORFOLK to allow for direct comparisons with FORMOSA. Comparisons were conducted using logistic regression with MELoR as the reference group. Results: Data from 3536 (1751 EPIC-NORFOLK, 1319 FoRMOSA and 466 MELoR) older women were included. A significant association was observed between BMI and falls in the previous 12 months for both FoRMOSA and MELoR study but not EPIC-NORFOLK.

Conclusion: Notable differences in country patterns for the relationship between BMI and falls were identified, which could be attributed to body composition and lifestyle differences observed between the populations.

Several drugs are associated with increased risk of falls, mainly the ones working on brain and circulation. We analyzed the high-risk drugs administered 24 hours before the falls among hospitalized patients older than 74 years old. Methods: We performed a retrospective study covering the hospital falls recorded in 2018. Data were collected through clinical files. Statistical analysis was executed with SPSS. Results: In 2018 were recorded 270 hospital falls, in 246 patients; 48% of them happened in patients older than 74 years old. In the 24 hours before the fall, each patient received a medium of 8.8 \u00b1 3.1 drugs. The most prescribed medicines were psychotropic drugs (68%), being benzodiazepines the most prescribed psychotropics (70%). The second most prescribed drugs were anti-hypertensives (42%), with a preference for angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) (71%). Opiate analgesics were administered in 26% of the patients. Discussion: The risk of falls rises with the number of drugs prescribed, nevertheless older patients continue under an excessive number of drugs during hospitalization, as we demonstrate. Although psychotropic drugs are known to increase falls risk, with literature advising against their use in the elderly, we continue to see more than half of these patients under them. Drugs are a modifiable risk factor for falls, a periodical drug review on high-risk medications should be made in elderly patients.",

Recent studies have shown that sarcopenia is associated with impaired physical capability, poor quality of life, adverse metabolic effects, falls, disability, mortality, and hospitalization (2). The sectional area of skeletal muscle taken from the abdomen is strongly related to the whole body muscle distribution, and it is known that the cross-sectional skeletal muscle index (SMI, cm 2 ) at L4 level is highly associated with the total body skeletal muscle mass (2) . It also provides the ability to detect muscle radiation attenuation (SMRA, Hounsfield Units (HU)), a measure of muscle quality that is inversely related to muscle fat content (3) . In this study, we aimed to show the change of muscle area and density measured by cross-sectional CT by age.",

Patient assessments were completed at the time of the fracture and at 6 and 12 months. Outcome data included mortality, re-admission to hospital, falls, further fractures and disability as assessed by patient self report using the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire. Results: 134 patients were recruited and 113 attended follow up. Two patients were inpatients at the time of fracture. Overall, 27 (20.1%) patients were admitted for \\ 3 days for surgery. 18 (13.4%) were admitted for [ 10 days and had a median length of stay of 48 days . Those admitted for [ 10 days were older (80.7 vs 67.6, p \\ 0.001) and frailer (p \\ 0.001), had a higher Charlson comorbidity index (p = 0.001) and were pre-morbidly more likely to require help with ADLs (50% v 11.4%, p = 0.000) and take more medications (p \\ 0.001). They were also more likely to have a lower BMD at the femoral neck (p = 0.013), total hip (p = 0.007) and forearm (p = 0.026) and have a previous vertebral fracture (p = 0.042) though had higher 25(OH)D (p = 0.001). Comparing outcomes, they had a higher readmission rate (31.3% vs 10.9%, p=0.025) and worse performance on DASH at the time of fracture (p = 0.021) and at 6 months (p \\ 0.001) and 12 months (p = 0.026) There was no difference in mortality with one death in each group. Conclusion: Wrist fracture in older, frail adults is associated with much longer hospital admissions, three times the readmission rate and greater disability over a one year follow up period. Findings highlight the importance of identifying these at risk patients and ensuring robust pathways to optimise care for this vulnerable group.",

The majority of these (87.3%) were normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism. 50.7% were vitamin D deficient, with 11.5% being severely deficient (Vitamin D \\ 20nmol/L). Conclusion: The prevalence of hyperparathyroidism is higher in the hip fracture group than in the general population [2] . Vitamin D deficiency is also prevalent in this group. FRAX score indicated significant proportion of patients had high major osteoporosis and hip fracture risks. Routine bone health profile checks in this high-risk group allow early identification and management of hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D depletion, which can potentially reduce the risk of future fracture Conclusion: Awareness of the patient characteristics described in this study allows design of targeted fracture prevention strategies. We describe the significance, in particular, of age, gender and BMI in predicting lower BMD and therefore future fracture risk. We explore the difference between the profile of male versus female patients sustaining the fracture highlighting the importance of being aware of the risk of this fracture in younger men with relatively higher BMD as well as the lower rate of prescribing of osteoporosis treatment in this group.",

Several factors have been identified as fall-risk increasing such as pharmacological treatment. Aim: to analyze the association between polypharmacy, inappropriate prescription (IP), anticholinergic burden and falls, comparing patients with and without femur fracture. Methods: A case-control study in patients older than 85-years or younger with cognitive impairment admitted to Geriatric Acute Unit with femur fracture and history of falls compared with control group. Variables: Sociodemographic, cognitive, functional, pharmacological (polypharmacy (global: C 5 drugs), IP using patient-centered prescription model [1] and prescription optimization and anticholinergic burden with Drug Burden Index (DBI): 0: null, \\1: low, Introduction: Frailty is considered often as a physical impairment in the elderly and its characteristics are weakness, weight loss, exhaustion, a decrease of the physical activity accumulating also co morbidity. It is considered the geriatric syndrome related to the aging process, declining of biological reserve that results in an increase of vulnerability for negative results including disability, hospitalization, and death. Frailty was defined as ''a state of increased vulnerability on the stress factors due to the decline of the intramuscular, metabolic, physiologic reserve and immune systems. Conclusion: Regular studies came to the same conclusion that physical activity has preventive effects in frail elderly even though uncertainty exists in optimal exercise programs regarding the frequency, kind of nutrition and duration. To prevent the fragility, necessary measurements need to be taken with nutrition e proteins, vitamin D and other alimentary, but this information is not yet public domain. The benefits of physical exercises in frailty elderly include increased movement, increased performance in activities of daily living, improved walk, elimination of falls, improvement of mineral bone density and the increase of overall health. However, systems of health care actually are not organized to offer integrated care on daily life, but to identify and treat acute diseases. Recommendation: Physical activity and adequate nutrition, especially regarding vitamin D, calcium and proteins are fundamental in improving at the same time bones, muscles, and the functional results in elder population, if they are individually adapted and determined. Preventive methods through physical activity in frailty elder should be described with an individual progressive plan as in the other medical treatments.

The purpose of our study is to examine the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) among frail Asian older adults. Methods: Data from the ''Evaluation of the Frails' Fall Efficacy by Comparing Treatments'' study were analyzed. Distribution-based and anchor-based methods were used to estimate the MCID of the 6MWD. Participants who completed the trial rated their perceived change of overall health on the Global Rating of Change (GROC) scale. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to analyze the sensitivity and specificity of the cut-off values of 6MWD (in meters) for GROC rating of ''a little bit better'' (?2), based on feedback from participants. Results: The mean (SD) change in 6MWD was 37.3(46.2) m among those who perceived a change (GROC C 2), while those who did not was 9.3(18.2) m post-intervention (P = 0.011). From the anchor-based method, the MCID value for the 6MWD was 17.8 m (sensitivity 56.7% and specificity 83.3%) while distribution-based method estimated 12.9 m. Key conclusion: The MCID estimate for 6MWD was 17.8 m in the moderately frail Asian older adults with a fear of falling.

We investigated the risk factors that were associated with mortality using binary logistic regression analysis. Kaplan-Meir (KM) charts were generated by following the outcome in all patients until 12 May 2020. Introduction: Frailty is a prevalent and critical geriatric syndrome among older adults often associated with adverse outcomes [1] . This study examines the prevalence of frailty among older adults in the community using a Frailty Index (FI). Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed from June to September 2019, with older adults who were users of primary care. EASYcare was used for data collection. The FI construction was based on data provided from EASYcare and 44 variables were scored '1' if the value fell outside the normal range and '0' otherwise. For example, an individual with 20 of a possible 44 deficits would have an FI score of 20/44 = 0.45. The cut-off point of C 0.25 indicates frailty [2] . Results: 100 older adults have participated (mean age: 77.99 \u00b1 7.24 years; 61% female) Most of the participants had lower levels of education (one to three years) (67%). The EASYcare summarising indexes showed: the independence score (0-100) was 17.28 \u00b1 18.2; the risk of a breakdown in care (0-7) was 2.6 \u00b1 1.9; the risk of falls (C 3 in total of 8) was 41%. The mean FI was 0.29 \u00b1 0.13. More than half (55%) of the participants were frail. Key conclusions: In this study, the prevalence of frailty was high among older adults in the community; however, these results could be affected by the FI construction. These data show the importance of implementing frailty prevention intervention in the community. (2) showed high levels of dependency (average score -6). High levels of acuity were noted. There were marked levels of both delirium (31%) and incontinence (50%). Implementation of the Covid Geriatric service posed a unique set of challenges. There were barriers to communication due to wearing of personal protective equipment and the reduced duration and frequency of patient interactions. There was delayed time to presentation to the acute setting which necessitated liaison with palliative care services. Patients were more vulnerable to prolonged and complicated delerium. Constraints on availability of investigations and delayed swab results led to increased patient deconditioning and length of stay. Interventions were wide ranging and included nurse education, management of delerium and the use of a multi-disciplinary approach. Methods: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the Homesafe project on length of stay from the patient being recorded as safe for discharge, future hospital attendances and admissions, comparing data from 2 months before and after implementation. Results: Following implementation there were no requests for Telecare on the AMU.The median number of admissions prior to implementation was 1, and post was 0. The median length of stay was 2 days after being deemed medically safe for discharge. Service User and NOK feedback was positive. Conclusion: The homesafe project has been shown to reduce length of stay on AMU with subsequent reduction in reattendance and admission rates with good service user feedback. It demonstrates the importance of collaborative working across sectors to support those patients who are socially isolated and vulnerable. It should be considered across other AMUs to support patient flow and patient experience.",

Conclusion: Our findings indicate that frail older adults can successfully complete a dedicated exercise programme in an integrated environment with younger and elite athletes. Their perception of the integrated environment was not biased by their past sporting participation. This suggests that exercise programmes in the frail older adult should not be restricted to geriatric day ward/rehabilitation settings but should be promoted in community sports centres and gymnasia.

Two main models previously described frailty as a loss of physical functions or as accumulation of multiple deficits. Recently, a novel conceptual model of multidimensional frailty has emerged based on the loss of harmonic interaction between multiple domains (biological, functional, cognitive, psycho-social and economic) that ultimately lead to homeostatic instability. Aim of our study was to compare the physical frailty index developed in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) with a multidimensional frailty tool, the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI), in predicting death in community-dwelling older subjects. Methods: In this observational longitudinal cohort study, 407 community-dwelling older subjects were enrolled. Each subject underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) with the calculation of the MPI and CHS. Mortality was then recorded over the following 5 years. Cox-PH models were used to assess the effect of CHS and MPI, respectively: the difference between the observed C-indexes were adopted to compare the performance of mortality risk prediction.",

According to the MPI score, 2% of subjects were in the high-risk category (MPI-3) and 18% in the moderate risk category (MPI-2). During the 5-year follow-up period 53 subjects (13%) died. Both MPI and CHS index were able to predict mortality. However, the MPI was significantly more accurate than CHS to predict mortality (C-index = 0. 69 and 0.59, respectively) , with a statistically significant difference of 10% (95% CI 0.02-0.18, p = 0.013).",

She was refusing her co-careldopa (25/100 mg TDS) in the days prior to becoming unresponsive. She was also on rivastigmine 1.5 mg BD and quetiapine 2 5mg OD On examination her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 7 and she was mildly hypertensive. Heart, chest and abdominal exam was normal. She had cogwheel rigidity bilaterally. FBC and CRP were normal. Urea and Creatinine were elevated at 13.9 mmol/L and 114 lmol/L respectively. Creatine kinase (CK) was elevated at 2444 IU/L. Chest X-ray and CT head showed no acute pathology. Neuroleptic malignant-like syndrome was diagnosed. The patient was started on a rotigotine patch 8 mg/24 h and intravenous fluids. A nasogastric tube was inserted but pulled by the patient on several occasions. She remained afebrile, initially renal function improved, however level of consciousness continued to fluctuate reaching a maximum GCS of 12 and rigidity persisted. Subsequently the patient developed acute kidney injury (AKI) stage 3, deteriorated and was managed palliatively. Discussion: Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare lifethreatening disorder, which is most often due to an adverse reaction to an anti-psychotic drug. First generation anti-psychotics were the usual culprits but every class has been implicated in reported cases. NMS can also occur in PD patients if their dopaminergic drug therapy is abruptly stopped or reduced, as in this case, and has been referred to in the literature as neuroleptic malignant-like syndrome or malignant syndrome in PD. NMS is defined by the tetrad of hyperthermia, mental status change, muscle rigidity and autonomic dysfunction. Elevated CK levels, usually [ 1000 IU, increase the suspicion of NMS; the level of elevation correlates with disease severity and prognosis. Leucocytosis, elevation of liver transaminases, hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hyperkalaemia are common but not specific. Our patient remained afebrile throughout hospitalisation. Although hyperthermia is a classic feature of NMS, there have been reported cases where fever has not been present. The exact pathogenesis of NMS is unknown. Central blockade of the hypothalamic and nigrostriatal dopamine receptors interferes with dopamine's role. If NMS is suspected, the precipitating drug should be discontinued. In PD patients, if dopaminergic therapy had been abruptly stopped, it should be re-started. Temperature and blood pressure should be monitored. Dehydration is a known precipitant of NMS and hydration is vital. Rhabdomyolysis and AKI are the two most common complications in NMS and AKI is a significant predicator of mortality. In this case, despite the patient being adequately fluid resuscitated she developed profound AKI, which proved fatal. NMS mortality could be as high as 50%The best treatment is prevention. Dantrolene, Bromocriptine, or amantadine have been tried in NMS; however, the evidence supporting their use is limited. Conclusion: Physicians need to be aware of the potential of developing NMS in PD patients when a dopaminergic medication is suddenly withdrawn or reduced especially if the patient was on an antipsychotic or an antipsychotic was started. In this case, withdrawal of L Dopa on a background of use of an antipsychotic drug precipitated NMS, and age, development of AKI and rhabdomyolysis and having a single kidney contributed to the poor outcome.",

Microcytic anaemia were identified. An ultrasound duplex showed a deep venous thrombosis of the left superficial femoral vein. On presentation, she had a smooth tongue, angular cheilitis and koilonychia. Investigations revealed an anaemia with a haemoglobin level of 9 g/dl, mean cell volume 71.2 fl and irondeficiency. A barium swallow revealed a post-cricoid web. It was thereafter ascertained on pharyngo-esophageal endoscopy. Then, our patient was diagnosed of Plummer-Vinson syndrome associated with DVT. However, no biopsy was taken. Given that our patient was elderly and DVT may be paraneoplastic, a thoraco-abdominal scan, gastric endoscopy and colonoscopy did no show any abnormality. She was treated with iron therapy and anti-coagulant drugs. She has been followed up for a period of 24 months with improvement in her dysphagia and general nutritional status with no recurrence of DVT. Conclusion: Plummer-Vinson syndrome is very rare and usually diagnosed in young adults. This case highlights that, although rare, Plummer-Vinson syndrome can occur in elderly. When it is associated with DVT, a neoplasia must be searched. Thereby, early diagnosis, treatment and close follow-up is of paramount importance in elderly.",

Main themes contained: (1) the policy of low complex problems and returning home does not fit with practice; which results in STRC in a (2) mismatch between patient needs and care delivered by short-term residential care facilities. Therefore (3) planning appropriate care before and after discharge are important, such as advance care planning, social care and home adaptations are important. Conclusions and implications: Short-term residential care is used by a patient population with an increasing complexity of health problems and often a longer existing functional decline. The provision of better targeted and evidence-based care is warranted. Adequate staffing and resources is necessary. Also, the problems of STRC should be seen in the larger context: a the environmental context of the patient need to be addressed to enable older adults to live longer independently at home.",

A double-blind randomised controlled study was conducted in the two health centres between July 2019 and January 2020. Control and intervention groups were created and thirtyfive T2DM older patients with chronic periodontitis who attended the centres were randomly recruited into each group. The intervention group received an oral health education program based on the Health Belief Model (HBM), individual oral hygiene instruction, scaling and root planning at one month, and individual oral hygiene instruction at three months. The patients in the control group received the routine program. Outcomes were assessed using a questionnaire, a simplified oral hygiene index, and glycaemic status. These measures were applied at baseline, three months and six months. Data were analysed using a Chi-square test, a t-test, and repeated measure ANOVA at p-value = 0.05. The results at three and six months showed that the intervention group significantly improved their HBM and oral health behaviour scores. Furthermore, their OHI-S scores and HbA1c levels (p \\ 0.05) decreased, while there was no significant difference in the control group. The findings suggested that the program was effective among diabetic older people who have periodontitis in terms of improving oral health perception, behaviours, oral hygiene, and glycaemic status as indicated in evaluations occurring three and six months.

Aim of the WeSPA study is to explore the use of body-worn accelerometers for automated frailty assessment. Methods: After screening by geriatricians for the presence of frailty (Fried's criteria), 34 persons aged 70? years were asked to walk 20 m at their preferred speed while wearing two accelerometers, one positioned on the lower back and the other on the wrist. Sensorderived signals were then analyzed independently to compare the ability of the two signals (wrist vs back) in the identification of frailty status. A gait-cycle detection technique was applied to divide each signal into segments made of four gait cycles, which were then used S240 Eur Geriatr Med (2020) 11 (Suppl 1):S1-S309 as input to a feature-extraction phase. Features in the time domain and the time-frequency domain (i.e., Wavelet Transform) were computed on these segments, and eventually a subset of 18 features was selected. Finally, different machine learning models were trained to classify subjects as robust or non-robust (prefrail/frail). Results: The wrist sensor identified non-robust subjects with 100% sensitivity and 73% specificity, compared to only 87% sensitivity and 73% specificity of the back sensor.",

The treatment of these infections varies depending on the type of catheter and the micro-organism [1] [2] [3] . The contribution of nursing care is catalytic at all stages of the implementation of the CVC. Risk minimization is linked with the prevention of hematogenous infections through the implementation of evidence-based best practices promoting in this way the quality of care and patients' safety [3] [4] [5] . Introduction: Most of people with dementia in nursing homes show one or more symptoms of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Two consecutive Dutch Health inspectorates in nursing homes showed a late, inadequate or incorrect response to BPSD. Three proven effective approaches have joined forces to develop one combined intervention, the STIP method: the personalised integrated stepped care approach to BPSD (Dutch guideline 2018). We are implementing STIP, supported with the BPSD Care web application in two nursing homes (N= 200) with the aim to investigate facilitators and barriers to perform STIP. Methods: The implementation of STIP is executed by means of sounding board groups including informal carers, care professionals and managers. Qualitative data on facilitators and barriers were extracted from 24 transcripts. Quantitative data about the extent of implementation were extracted from patient records (n= 40). Results (preliminary): Qualitative analysis points towards the following facilitators: acknowledgement of difficulties in dealing with and treating of BPSD; acknowledgement for the need of a more integrated approach; leadership; ownership and collaboration. Barriers include a lack of notion about the costs and benefits of STIP; insufficient support from managers and a less-methodological workflow. Quantitative analysis shows multiple deficits in clinical reasoning e.g. the absence of an integral interdisciplinary goal attainment plan. Key conclusions: Both qualitative and quantitative data underline specific difficulties in the implementation of STIP in nursing homes. Insight in barriers and facilitators is a prerequisite for nursing homes to pinpoint the bottlenecks and subsequently to effectively counteract them.",

Furthermore, in clinical practice, the choice of the bed frame of the hospital bed has a structure that can raise the head of the bed and the end of the bed, but in order to clean and avoid those patients from developing bed sores due to prolonged lying, those patients still needs to turn over. The bed frame is still unable to meet the needs of making those patients easy to turn over. Therefore, Dayeh University established the Long-Term Care and Intelligent Assistive Device Laboratory in 2017 to design and develop multifunctional intelligent bed, and expected it can meet with the demands for elderly patients. Objectives: The demands of the multifunctional intelligent bed will be established and analyzed by the reference for the future revisions.MethodsThis creation was jointly developed by Taichung Veterans General Hospital and Daye University to carry out creative research and development, adding the function of bed end assisted getting out of bed, left and right turning functions, the bed posture control adds eye tracker and mobile phone APP control methods, and the patient can look at the eye tracker screen or mobile phone operation to adjust the posture through the eyeball, to avoid the problem of bedsores, so this smart bed expects to be able to reduce the stress and physical load of care providers. Results: The multifunctional intelligent bed was designed and developed with the Taiwan patent certificate (No 1652055) at the current stage. This study assumes that the demand of multifunctional intelligent bed for the elderly is to help those patients turn over, thereby reducing the burden of the patients' families and reducing the chance of nursing staff working hours and occupational injuries, and the research is still processing as well. Conclusions: The research results will provide medical supplies development of the Long-Term Care and Intelligent Assistive Device Laboratory in the future and to understand the demands of the elderly for multifunctional intelligent bed, and to avoid the problem of bedsores, then therefore to reduce the stress and physical load of care providers.",

More than a nutritional act, mealtimes play a social, religious, biological, and symbolic role in most cultures. It has been increasingly recommended that feeding difficulties can be reduced by applying a social-ecological approach to care, such as the C3P Model -Change the Person, Change the People, Change the Place [1] . This study aimed to explore feeding practices in institutionalized people with dementia (PwD) according to the dimensions of the C3P Model. Methods: Twenty-three nursing assistants (NA) were included in this exploratory-descriptive study. Their skills while offering lunch to institutionalized PwD were assessed through the Feeding Skills Checklist [2] . Results: All participants were female, with an average age of 44.73 years (SD = 10.42) and with 10.28 years of professional practice. Of the 41 meals observed, only 37.7% of good practices were observed. The worst performance was in the PwD dimension, which had only 21.2% of good practices performed. There is not a meal routine and no oral hygiene after the meal was performed. A significant positive correlation was found for time of profession practice and the FSC environment dimension (rs = 0.435, p = 0.038). Key conclusions: There is a weakness in the interpersonal relationship between NA and PwD, and better performance in the environmental (and institutional) Introduction: Medication non-adherence is a complex behavior with multidimensional causes. WHO refers to financial strain as one of the most important factors for it. This literature review describes the factors associated with cost-related medication non-adherence (CRMN). Methodology: A literature review was conducted at PubMed database using the keywords ''adherence'', ''compliance'', ''financial strain'', ''older adults'', ''cost-related medication nonadherence'' and ''community nurse''. Results: In developed countries, CRMN rated 60% for people over 60 years old, which was commonly expressed as unfilled or delayed prescriptions and decreased frequency and doses. Elderlies have multiple chronic conditions and multiple medication use is needed. Frequently, they cannot afford them due to out-of-pocket payments and inadequate coverage by insurance. Evidence has shown that socioeconomic characteristics such as female sex, being uninsured, and living in poverty are associated with a higher likelihood of CRMN. There are also health-related factors (multimorbidity, mental disease, functional limitations and poor health) and other factors such as older people's relationship with healthcare providers and healthcare system which are associated with a higher likelihood of CRMN. Heterogeneity exists between disease groups and cultural backgrounds. The consequences of that behavior are complications in patient's condition and consequently higher costs for healthcare systems. Key conclusions: Community nurses encounter and manage first these types of patients' behaviors and should be appropriately prepared to manage them. On the other hand, reliable healthcare systems and political decisions must guarantee equity and equality of healthcare provisions for all.",

Methods: Our aim was to understand the degree of satisfaction, the difficulties and expectations of general practitioners concerning the PRADO-IC programme through self-administered questionnaires, carried out from March 2019 to October 2019 to 60 GPs following patients hospitalised between 01/01/17 and 03/03/19 aged 70 or over and included at the hospital discharge in this program. A descriptive analysis of the sample and a statistical analysis according to age and department of work of the practitioners have been performed. Results: The response rate was 41.1%. This survey showed us that the program is well appreciated overall, especially by older doctors. General practitioners believe in the use of the program and think it can improve the treatment of heart failure in elderly patients. However, some complain of poor involvement in scheduling appointments. Conclusion: The PRADO-IC allows an efficient organization of the return home with a link between several care actors. Our study shows fairly positive feedback from general practitioners, but highlights some problems, such as the need for greater participation by the general practitioner in organizing patient follow-up.",

Assessing their social network through a health professional (proxy) may be useful. We aimed to analyze the correlation between the number of visits (by proxy respondents) and the Lubben Social Network Scale of 6 items (LSNS-6, by older people) to evaluate the social network of NH residents. Methods: Cross-sectional study in 4 NH from Osona (Barcelona), between January and March 2020. The Spearman test was used for bivariate analysis between LSNS-6 and number of visits (''how many visits per month does the resident receive?'', with a confidence level of 95%. Results: Among the recruited 145 subjects, 33 (22.7%) were excluded due to individuals or their legal guardians refused to participate, 5 (3.4%) were less than 65 years old, 4 (2.7%) were hospitalized or other reason, 64 (62.1%) for cognitive impairment and 6 (5.8%) presented incomplete data on the two main variables. Final sample was 33 (22.7%), mean age of 82 years (\u00b18.05), being 23 (69.7%) women. Mean number of monthly visits was 12.5\u00b110.99; 13 (39.4%) had low risk of social isolation and 20 (60.6%) high risk. A significative negative correlation (-0.50, p=0.003) between LSNS-6 and number of visits was found. Conclusions: Number of monthly visits are significatively and negatively correlated with high risk of social isolation. It is necessary to achieve a larger sample to elucidate if the number of visits is a reliable measure to assess social network in NH residents. 19 and 15/1/ 20 . It involved collecting data which are recorded routinely and are available on the computer system.The parameters studied include the NEWS score, Pain score, duration of admission into the service, source of admission and place of discharge. Results: The total number of patients admitted into the service was sixty. Out of this, there were 36.67 percent of males and 66.33 percent females.Patients were referred into it from different sources. Half of them were referred by the GPS.Eight patients were referred from the Hospitals.One fifth of the referrals came from the social services and another one fifth came from district nurses.Ambulance service referrals were 5 in number which accounted for a sixth of the referrals.6.67% of referrals came from the IV team.In the review, 46 out of 55 patients who had NEWS done had either had better NEWS scores or remained the same. Seventeen patients had better final NEWS scores in comparison with initial NEWS scores. Also nine patients had worse NEWS scores on the final score in comparison to the first NEWS score.Pain score is measured with numerical rating scale. This is based on patient's self assessment (Childs et al, 2005) . Twelve patients were better with the pain scores on the final discharge when compared with eight who had worse scores. Among the places of discharge, forty four patients were in their normal places of residence. One patient who was palliative ,died at home. Fifteen patients were admitted in hospital. The total number of days the patients were under the service was 716 days. This divided by the total number of patients which is 60 gives a mean stay of 11.93 days. Conclusions: The results of the review were positive overall with good outcomes reached for patients. This is reflected in the NEWS scores and the pain scales. Also the number of days the patient is within the service is within the parameters of the National Institute of Clinical Excellence.",

Due to the rapidly progressive nature of the pressure sores, a potential dermatological cause was sought. The patient was reviewed and noted to have had multiple oral ulcerating lesions and on the patient's arms he was noted to have multiple small (few mms in size) ulcerating lesions and healed excoriation marks. A collateral history was obtained from the patient's wife which yielded that he was previously diagnosed with a dermatological condition years prior. On the national database of investigations, he was noted to have been tested for Prickle Cell Desmosome Antibodies and the results showed [1:40. A provisional diagnosis of Pemphigus Vulgaris induced pressure sores was made. After treatment with high dose intravenous steroids the patient's pressure sores have started to resolve and the treatment has proved to be promising. Learning points: This case illustrates the fact that pressure sores may have complex aetiological factors involved, apart from the classical causes of decreased nutrition, frailty and decreased mobility. Due to the Covid-19 crisis, this patient was not able to undergo a skin biopsy due to reduction into dermatological services offered.

The aetiology of MSA remains unknown, but it can involve the extrapyramidal and pyramidal system, the autonomic nerves and the cerebellum. The main clinical manifestations are Parkinson's symptoms, cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal tract signs and autonomic nervous system disorders. Several conditions can be associated. We report a case of MSA associated with interstitial pneumonitis and positive anti-muscle antibodies. Case report: A 79-year-old patient with a medical history of arterial hypertension was followed in the our department of internal medicine for progressive balance disorders, diffuse myalgia, frequent falls, orthostatic hypotension and parkinsonism. The patient was diagnosed with probable MSA and a cerebral and spinal magnetic resonance imaging was not consistent with Parkinson's disease.The clinical examination showed a cerebellar syndrome, a pyramidal syndrome, a parkinsonian syndrome and autonomic dysfunction: urinary incontinence and constipation. Pulmonary auscultation revealed crackling rales. The thoracoabdominal CT objectified lesions of nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis. Hepatic, renal, metabolic and inflammatory assessments were normal. Hepatitis B, C and HIV serologies were negative. The immunoassay revealed positive anti-smooth muscle antibodies. Anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-extractable nuclear antigens and anti-neuronal antibodies were negative. The patient was treated with levodopa 500 mg per day combined with corticosteroid therapy 0.5 mg/kg/day, motor rehabilitation and education of his family. Corticosteroids were tapered gradually. The patient is currently followed the the outpatient department with no further signs. Conclusion: MSA is a rare but serious condition. Its atypical clinical presentation can lead to other diagnosis in elderly. We found no previous reports in literature, of coexistence of MSA and positive anti-smooth muscle antibodies and interstitial pneumonitis.",

It is a nonobstructive dilation of the colon, which is usually associated with systemic toxicity. SIt is often associated with inflammatory bowel disease, especially ulcerative colitis, however, any condition that causes inflammation of the colon may be its etiology. In recent times, epidemiology has shifted towards infectious causes, specifically due to an increase in Clostridium difficile-associated colitis, possibly due to the extensive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. As responsible physicians, we must justify as much as possible any initiation of antibiotic treatment and initiate sequential therapy with antibiotics oriented to compatible antibiograms, reserving broad-spectrum treatments to selected cases and not in a generalized way.",

Discussion and conclusions: Metabolic Syndrome in the elderly patients is often associated with gallbladder's diseases. The diabetes with neuropathy causes gallbladder hypotonia with biliary stasis and often in the elderly patients with gallbladder sludge we observe dyspeptic syndrome and reduced gastric motility. In the elderly patients with diabetes and obesity, US detected early and easily gallblader's diseases and the prevalence was very high. In patients with the association between diabetes and dyslipidemia or hypertension was observed a low prevalence of gallbladder's disease. In conclusion, the data of our study show that in the elderly patients with metabolic syndrome is the obesity the most important risk factor for gallbladder's diseases, while the diabetes plays a fundamental role , also related to neuropathy. The high blood pressure is not a risk factor for gallbladder's disease. The dyslipidemia slightly increases the prevalence of gallbladder's diseases. The early U S in elderly patients is very important to detect the serious inflammatory complications of gallbladder: in fact cholecystitis , associated with fever and abdominal pain is often observed in diabetic elderly patients. We suggest that US should be performed in all elderly patients with metabolic syndrome, also without symptoms of gsllbladder's diseases.

Age (79\u00b18,5 vs 82\u00b17,3, p-value=0,35) and female gender predominance (50%, p-value=1) was similar in both groups. Malnourished patients exhibited a slight tendency to infection as diagnosis at admission (40 vs 15%, p-value=0.07), not statistically significant due to similarity in other diagnosis. Both groups had similar levels of comorbidity burden by the Charlson index (4\u00b12,4 vs 5, 3\u00b13,8, p-value=0.3) , dependence by the Lawton&Brody scale (4,7\u00b12,3 vs 4.3\u00b13,3, p-value=0.6) and frailty by PRISMA7 (3,2\u00b11,8 vs 2,8\u00b12, p-value=0,6) . Considering the outcomes, there was only a difference in mortality at 6 months (10 vs 40% for the malnourished, p-value=0.05), with similar length of stay (10,7\u00b15,7 vs 29\u00b185, p-value=0.09), readmission (40 vs 20%, p-value=0.2) and in-admission mortality (10 vs 20%, p-value=0.4). Discussion: Despite the small size sample, we observed 1/3 of malnourished patients, that did not seem to differ from the other in terms of demographic and geriatric features. The higher impact appears to be on medium-term mortality. Background: Malnutrition is an often unrecognized and untreated cause and consequence of disease in adults. It has a substantial impact on health across all care settings, including the Hospital setting.The Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) recently proposed a consensus scheme for diagnosing malnutrition in adults in clinical settings on a global scale. It is a two-step approach, first screening to identify ''at risk'' status using a validated screening tool, and second, assessment for diagnosis and grading of the severity of malnutrition. Our aim is to use this new consensus to estimate the prevalence of malnutrition in the elderly in an acute medicine ward. Methods: Cross sectional study performed at an internal medicine ward, throughout 4 months, to patients willing to participate following signed informed consent. Demographic and clinical data gathered from the electronic file, and antropometric data (height, weight, midarm diameter and nutritional history) collected from the patient. Nutritional data was analysed according to the GLIM consensus together with MUST for at risk screening. Patients were divided into 2 age groups (\\65 and[65 years old).

Depression symptoms are known to influence gait speed in cognitively healthy adults. In this study, we determined the relationship between slow gait speed and depression symptoms in a sample of patients with mild cognitive impairment. Method: We measured 15-feet gait speed and depression symptoms in community-dwelling older people (C 65 years) with mild cognitive impairment recruited from an outpatient setting of a tertiary geriatric care unit. The subjects were classified as slow and normal gait speed based on the Fried criteria.

Rapamycin, used in transplanted patients as immunosuppresor, has shown a therapeutic potential in pre-clinical model of PD through the neuroprotection of dopaminergic neurons in SN. Moreover Rapamycin has been associated to glucose metabolic disorders. Previous studies suggested that analogs of Rapamycin (Rapalogs) have similar neuroprotective effects by signaling for mTOR pathway. We investigated if Rapalogs called TAM-1 and TAM-3 has a neuroprotective effect and avoids metabolic alterations in a pharmacological PD model in comparison with Rapamycin effects (performance). Material and methods: Adult male C57BL/6 mice were injected unilaterally into the SN with the neurotoxin 6-OHDA, validated PD model. Animals were pretreated with Rapamycin, TAM-1, TAM-3 or vehicle (2 injections administered intraperitoneally). After 7 days, we evaluated the motor performance by Cylinder test and determine neurodegeneration process by histopathological analysis using antityrosine hydrolase antibody. Moreover, we determine metabolic parameters as glucose, insulin, and leptin levels in serum samples of these mice. Results: Rapamycin, TAM-1 and TAM-3 prevent the loss of dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway. Additionally, TAM-3 ameliorate the motor impartment and TAM-1 did not trigger glucose resistance in PD model. Discussion: These results suggest that TAM-1 and TAM-3 exert neuroprotective effect of nigrostriatal circuits and alleviate the motor impairment, similar to Rapamycin in the pharmacological model of PD by signaling the mTOR pathway.",

The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of crushingmedication in people aged 65 years or older living at home. Method: A cross-sectional, observational, epidemiological study was carried out. Inclusion criteria were: age 65 years or more, living at home, and to have taken atleast one oral medication for two weeks or more. The subjects included wererecruited from different geriatric departments in Martinique. The primary outcome ofthis study was the prevalence of crushing medication. Results: In total, 209 patients were included; 17.7 % were found to crush theirmedication. We observed that family carers were more likely to crush medicationthan nurses or the patients themselves.",

Background: As the number of older people with dementia (PWD) increases, safe pharmacotherapy in this population has attracted attention in recent years. Aim: The aim of this study was to clarify the prescribing patterns in older patients who were prescribed anti-dementia drugs and to investigate the association of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) with the use of anti-dementia drugs. Methods: Adults aged C65 years, who were prescribed anti-dementia drugs at 585 pharmacies across Japan (N = 7953), were surveyed. The percentage of prescriptions for anti-dementia drugs and the effect of those prescriptions on PIMs were investigated. Results: Prescriptions for anti-dementia drugs were found in 4.4% of the entire study population. A logistic regression analysis revealed that the use of anti-dementia drugs reduced the risk of prescribing psychotropic drugs, which represented PIMs, and that a combination of anti-dementia drugs (e.g., choline esterase inhibitor with memantine) may reduce the risk of prescribing PIMs compared with monotherapy.",

In the previous day the pupils were non-dilated, equal and reactive bilaterally. The patient was not on mydriatic eye drops . On examination there were no other lateralising neurological signs; cranial nerves as well as motor exam of the upper and lower limbs were normal, apart from the dilated fixed left pupil. After clinically excluding an acute neurological event, the mydriatic effect of ipratropium anti-muscarinic action was considered to be a potential cause for the fixed dilated pupil, however this did not explain the unilateral involvement. The patient was observed while using the nebuliser and it was noticed that she could not tolerate the mask affixed to her face to form an adequate seal, rather, she was holding it aloft and favouring her right side, such that the mist dispersed more readily to the left; this explained the unilateral manifestations. The assumption was subsequently proven upon discontinuing the ipratropium, when the pupils size, symmetry and reactivity returned to normal after around 24 hours, in keeping with timescales documented in previous case reports.",

The incidence of ipratropium induced ocular complications is between 1% to \\ 1 per 1000 patients. Whilst there have been some case reports of ipratropium causing mydriasis, it remains in practice, a poorly recognised adverse drug reaction (ADR).

Yet, due to an unfavorable benefit-risk ratio, recommendations suggest avoidance or a maximal treatment duration of 4 weeks. We aimed to describe trends of BZRA use in older adults (C 65 years) over a 10-year period and associated factors in Belgium. Methods: BZRA use prevalence rates, standardized for age, sex and region, were calculated using Belgian Health Interview Survey data in 2004, 2008 and 2013 . Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess factors associated with BZRA use in 2013 (N=1286) and included socio-demographic factors, geriatric factors, comorbidities, medication use, healthcare services use, and subjective, mental and social health indicators. Results: Overall, standardized prevalence rate of BZRA use decreased significantly from 22% to 18% between 2004 and 2013 (rate difference (95% CI): -4.0% (-6.8; -1 1.3)). However, no decline was observed in z-drugs use nor in multiple BZRA users. In multivariable analysis, sleeping disorder was associated with BZRA use (OR (95% CI)=1.86 (1.31; 2.64)) but not with anxiety disorder. Other variables significantly associated to BZRA use included female gender, poor mental health, polypharmacy, trazodone and other antidepressant use. Key conclusions: An encouraging decline in BZRA use was observed from 2004 to 2013, but it remained highly prevalent in Belgian older adults. Promotion of alternatives to BZRA for sleeping problems remains essential. High-risk subgroups such as multiple BZRA users or concomitant users of BZRA and antidepressant should be targeted in deprescribing interventions.",

To support clinicians in the management of FRIDs and to facilitate the deprescribing process, a deprescribing tool was developed by a European expert group for STOPPFall (Screening Tool of Older Persons Prescriptions in older adults with high fall risk) items. Methods: STOPPFall was created using an expert Delphi consensus process in 2019 and in 2020, 24 panellists from EuGMS SIG on Pharmacology and Task and Finish on FRIDs completed deprescribing tool questionnaire. To develop the questionnaire, a Medline\u00d2 literature search was performed. The panellists were asked to indicate for every medication class a possible need for stepwise withdrawal and strategy for withdrawal. They were asked in which situations withdrawal should be performed. Furthermore, panellists were requested to indicate those symptoms patients should be monitored for after deprescribing and a possible need for follow-ups. Results: Practical deprescribing guidance was developed for STOPPFall medication classes. For each medication class, a decision tree algorithm was developed including steps from medication review to symptom monitoring after medication withdrawal. Conclusion: STOPPFall was combined with a practical deprescribing tool designed to optimize medication review. This practical guide can help overcome current reluctance towards deprescribing in clinical practice by providing an up-to-date and straightforward source of expert knowledge.",

Syncope is a frequent emergency in the old adult. To emphasis a less common side effect of the ivabradine, we present a clinical case of an 84-year-old patient, addressed for a syncope. He associated other symptoms such as severe vertigo, physical asthenia and fatigue. Emergency cranial CT scan ruled out a possible neurological etiology. His personal hystory included: chronic coronary syndrome, orthostatic hypotension and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Its chronic treatment included: ivabradine due to its intolerance to beta-blocker, nitrates and calciumblockers, aspirine and tamsulosin. Clinical examination revealed orthostatic hypotension, considered secondary to dehydration, chronic venous insufficiency, and tamsulosine side effects. The ECG Holter revealed intermittent second-degree atrioventricular block. We considered the second-degree atrioventricular block as iatrogenic, secondary to ivabradine treatment. The ivabradine treatment was stopped and after the proper wash-out period another ECG Holter mounted. The ECG Holter was normal during all monitored period. The patient did not experience another syncope or associated symptomatology. Atrioventricular block of second degree is a very rare, less than 0.01%, side effect of ivabradine. In an older patient, ivabradine treatment is well tolerated, despite his multiple co-morbidities and polypharmacy.

This study aimed to analyse prevalence and predictors of the most relevant adverse drug reactions in older hypertensive adults. Methods: We retrospectively analysed data on antihypertensive-and statin-related adverse drug reactions in adults aged 65 or older evaluated at the Hypertension Clinic of Careggi Hospital, Florence, Italy, between January 2018 and December 2019. Predictors were investigated using multivariate logistic regression. Results: Of 262 participants (mean age 75.9 years, 55.3% female), the 19% of the patients taking ACE-inhibitors reported cough while 33.6% of the patients taking calcium channel blockers (CCB) reported peripheral edema, occuring more frequently of amlodipine. The prevalence of statin-related myalgia was 23.5%. At multivariate analysis SNRI antidepressants and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) were predictive of ACE-inhibitors induced cough (OR 16.220, 95% CI 1.243 -211.621; OR 4.207, 95% CI 1.249 -4.171, respectively) and angiotensin-receptor blockers were associated with an increased risk of peripheral edema on CCB (OR 2.500, 95% CI 1.095 -5.710). GERD was predictive for statin-induced myalgia (OR 6.737, 95% CI 1.530 -29.662). Conclusion: ACE inhibitor-induced cough, CCB-related peripheral edema and statin-induced myalgia are common in older hypertensive adults. SNRI antidepressants and GERD are independently associated with ACE inhibitor-induced cough, while angiotensin-receptor blockers are predictive of CCB-related peripheral edema. GERD is also associated with statin myalgia. Background: Whilst statin use is recommended for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, increasing attention has been paid the potential benefits of these drugs in delaying the onset or course of dementia. Whilst some reports have generated concerns over statin safety in vulnerable groups, there is a paucity of data assessing their potential benefit and harm in older adults with dementia. Method: We analysed data from NILVAD, a randomised control trial of Nilvadapine in mild-moderate Alzheimer's Dementia (AD). We analysed the effect of statin use on cognitive function and dementia severity on three validated tools over 18 months using mixed-effects linear models in addition to the association between statin use and adverse events using poisson regression. Conclusion: Whilst statin use was not associated with attenuated cognitive decline or dementia progression in AD, they were not associated with any increase risk of adverse events or unscheduled healthcare utilisation. Our findings support the safety of statin use in older adults with AD for the ongoing prevention of cardiovascular disease.",

However, they are still overprescribed. Our objective was to determine the percentage of patients admitted to our Orthogeriatric Unit (OGU) with proximal femur fracture that were chronically taking BZD, and how many underwent deprescription after comprehensive geriatric assessment. Methods: Retrospective study of patients discharged from the OGU during a 2-year period through electronic clinical record analysis. We Compared the preadmission and discharge chronic medication according to the discharge report. Patients taking BZD before the hospital admission were classified into 5 categories according to the intervention at discharge: maintenance of the previous prescription; switching to lower risk BZD; dosage reduction; tapering schedule; discontinuation. Results: We included 384 patients, 68.92% women, average age 84 years-old, Barthel score 81.29, Lawton score 4.01, Global deterioration scale 3.10, ''Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatric'' 8.9. 38.54% (N=148) were taking BZD before hospitalization. 88.51% were taking one BZD, 11.49% were taking more than one.

It is a complex process influenced by multiple factors, facing several barriers to its implementation. Patients' attitudes and perspectives towards deprescribing is one of the most common obstacles encountered. In Portugal, polypharmacy prevalence in the elderly is among the highest in Europe (36.9%). Successful deprescribing strategy implementation needs to know the Portuguese reality in this area. Methods: Translation and cultural validation to Portugal of the revised version of the Patients Attitudes Toward Deprescribing questionnaire (rPATD). Quantitative cross-sectional study, with patients aged 65 or older with at least one medication, using the rPATD Portuguese version, sociodemographic characteristics and clinical data collection. The main outcome is older patients' willingness to deprescribe inappropriate medications. The cross-sectional study is in progress. Results (preliminary): 25 older patients, 16 females (64%) and nine males (36%) completed the study. The majority (80%) are overall satisfied with their current medicines. Still, at the same time, they would be willing to stop one or more of the regular medication if their doctor said it was possible (11.1 % strongly agreed, 62.9 % agreed.) Key conclusion: These are preliminary results, but they aligned with other studies using this instrument. The rPATD helps to identify if patients willing to have medicines deprescribed, which can guide Portuguese doctors in their clinical practice selecting patients most likely to succeed in this process. Introduction: Intervention studies have shown that adequate protein intake combined with resistance exercise (RE) can counteract declines in muscle mass and function (sarcopenia). However, the role of whole foods rich in protein, such as milk, in sarcopenia in older adults is less understood. We aimed to examine the feasibility and acceptability of milk?RE as an intervention for sarcopenia in communitydwelling older adults, and to collect exploratory pilot data for future substantive research. Methods: Thirty community-dwelling older adults (71.7\u00b13.6 years; 40% women) were randomised into three groups: WM (whole milk 3.6% fat)?RE, SM (skimmed milk 0.3% fat)?RE, and C (control (isocaloric carbohydrate drink)?RE. A 6-week intervention was delivered in a local gym twice weekly. After a structured RE programme for upper-and lower-body strength exercises (2-3 sets, 8-10 repetitions), participants consumed 500ml of milk (*20g protein) or control drink within 45 minutes post-exercise and another 500ml within the following 5-6 hours. Results: The groups had similar sociodemographic, health and lifestyle characteristics. Twenty-nine participants completed the intervention with an overall attendance of 97.1%; 89.7% rated their overall study experience as 'excellent'/'very good'. Drinking compliance was 97.1% (WM), 98.3% (SM), and 95% (C); 93.1% rated their drink intake as 'easy'/'very easy'. RE compliance was 97.5% (WM), 98.3% (SM), and 95.8% (C) with overall resistance training intensity rated as 'somewhat hard ' and 'hard' . No adverse effects were reported. Collection of exploratory pilot data was successful. Conclusion: The milk?RE intervention conducted in a community gym setting was feasible and acceptable to older adults.",

Additionally, limited number of studies have investigated the role of whole foods rich in protein in combination with RT in sarcopenia. To promote healthier lifestyles in older adults, an understanding of the acceptability of interventions and motivations and barriers to continued engagement is needed. Methods: Thirty community-dwelling older adults (aged 65.8-80.1 years) took part in a 6-week intervention consuming either whole milk, skimmed milk or an isocaloric control drink, in combination with RT. A health psychologist conducted interviews with 29 participants using standardised open-ended questions about their experiences in the study, acceptability of the intervention, and motivations and barriers to continued engagement. Data were analysed using content analysis. Results: The analysis revealed positive experiences and outcomes of taking part in the intervention, including: self-perceived improved health and physical fitness; knowledge acquisition in nutrition and exercise; positive reported outcomes (healthier lifestyle choices, increased energy and reduced pain), and social wellbeing. Social bonds and peer encouragement were motivations to continued engagement in widowed women. Having a personal instructor and being in a fun environment were highly valued by most. Drink consumption was viewed as a reward without negative effects on appetite. Barriers included affordability, environmental factors and concerns over negative health outcomes. Conclusion: To increase engagement, muscle health promoting strategies should focus on education and interventions should be enjoyable and offer social opportunities to promote and maintain health behaviours.",

Material and methods: 230 people were included in the cross-sectional study (average age 74 \u00b1 6.5 years; 96.5% women). EWGSOP2 criteria were adopted. Skeletal muscle strength was determined by grip strength and Chair stand test (5-times sit-to-stand). Skeletal muscle mass was calculated by Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASMM) by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Muscle function was evaluated by Short physical performance battery (SPPB). Results: Muscle strength in sarcopenics is lower than in non-sarcopenics (p \\0.001). The overall score for SPPB tests was reduced in both groups, but the sarcopenic level was lower than the non-sarcopenic level (p = 0.035). The prevalence of sarcopenia is 30% for older people living in the community, aged 65-74 years at 21.4%, 85? years at 52.9%. Men have a risk factor for sarcopenia of 2.64 (95% CI: 1.68-4.15, p \\0.0001).

Skeletal muscle assessments at L3 vertebra level were revealed to be significantly correlated with whole body muscle measurements. Herein, we aimed to provide gender specific cutoff sfor psoas muscle mass index (PMI) and skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) at the third lumbar vertebra level in Turkish population. Material and method: Preoperative plain CT images of living adult liver donors admitted our hospital transplantation center between June 2010-April 2018 were evaluated to determine PMI, skeletal muscle area (SMA) and SMI at the level of the third lumbar vertebra. Cutoff values using both 5th percentile and two standard deviations were considered to define low muscle mass in total study population, and in younger population aged 18-40. Results: 601 patients (age 18-59; 326 male, 275 female) were evaluated; 482 (%80) were young (age 18-40; 268 male, 214 female). In patients aged 20-40 gender specific SMI by using 5th percentile were calculated as 41.42 cm 2 /m 2 for males and 30.7 cm 2 /m 2 for females respectively. In the same age group, gender specific SMI by using two standard deviations were estimated as 38.67 cm 2 /m 2 for males and 27.8 cm 2 /m 2 for females respectively.

In our study, cutoff values for SMI were comparable with the other cutoffs reported in so far studied populations. Conclusions: The prevalence of UI in institutionalized older people was found high (77.9%) with the most common type being functional incontinence (80.8%) due to cognitive deterioration (48.1%) or walking difficulties (32.7%).

            "text": "Our aim was to evaluate influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates among older primary care outpatients in the period immediately preceding the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus infection. Methods: A cross-sectional study including people C 65 was conducted in February 2020 in a primary health care unit of rural Greece. Vaccination status of each participant was recorded according to self report and Greece's electronic universal prescribing system. Results: The study sample included 104 participants (median age=78 years, 49.1% women) from a population base of approximately 300 older adults in the community. The majority of the population was vaccinated with quadrivalent influenza vaccine for the current and previous influenza season (59.6%), whereas only 40.4% had been immunized against pneumococcus with either conjugate or polysaccharide vaccines after turning 65 years old. In total, 37.5% of the participants had not been immunized for either infection. In more detail, among 65 participants with inadequate vaccinations 61.8% lacked both vaccines, 30.9% lacked only pneumococcal immunization and 7.4% lacked only influenza immunization. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the unmet need for adequate influenza and pneumococcus immunization in rural communitydwelling older adults in the context of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. Background: Flu is one of the most prevalent winter-season infection, leading to poor prognosis in older populations (mortality, complex morbidity and functional decline). Vaccines is variably be efficient to prevent influenza but the question of a potential role of vaccines on severity of influenza episode is not well addressed. We aim to study this role using a cohort study of Older populations with influenza admitted to Hospital and performed in winter 2017. Materials/methods: We achieved a comparative analysis of vaccinated and non vaccinated patients who experimented a flu episode ([ 80 years) included in a national retrospective cohort over the 2016-2017 influenza outbreak in France (15 12 2016 to 30 03 2017). Demographic and baseline Data , all type of acute and middle complications (Mortality and functional status after 3 months) according use of antibiotic and oseltamivir have been analysed. Results: out of 515 patients with positive PCR, vaccine status wasn't known for 272 (52,3%), 159 (30.8%) were vaccinated and 84 (16.3%) non vaccinated. Mean Charlson index was the only variable statisically different between both goups at baseline. Mortality rate, acute organ failures, nosocomial influenza, length of stay, nursing home admissions were not different but functional decline at 3 month was lower in the vaccine group. Conclusions: Proven influenza hospitalized patients who were previously vaccinated exhibit a higher rate of comorbidities, but have a better functional outcome 3 months after a flu episode as compared with whose who were not vaccinated. No other outcome differences have been found. A prospective study measuring the the impact of influenza vaccine on influenza associated functional decline is warranted.",

Random capillary blood glucose (CBG) was measured in 103/336 (30.7%). CBG[11.1 mmol/l occurred in 21.4% of patients. Hyperglycaemia occurred in 100% of those already on insulin or with baseline HbA1CC 60mmol/mol. Hospital admission C1 occurred in 41.4% (139/336). This was associated with raised CBG (p=0.025) but not with a pre-existing diabetes diagnosis (p=0.370). Conclusion: Most patients do not have measures of glycaemia during chemotherapy",

Background: Early operative management of fragility hip fractures improves outcomes, hence surgery within 48 hours of presentation remains an important metric in standard of care. One reason for delay to surgery is anti-thrombotic medication use. University Hospital Waterford (UHW), a busy Irish trauma unit (c. 450 hip fractures per year) has local guidance on peri-operative anti-thrombotic management. We aimed to assess application of these guidelines to hip fracture patients, and explore the contribution of anti-thrombotic medication use to delays to surgery.

            "text": "Background and aim: Preventive lifestyle strategies have been proven useful against age-related cognitive decline, but there is still a lack of evidence on the reciprocal relationships between nutrition biomarkers and measures of both cognitive and physical performance. To fill this gap of knowledge, the relationship of plasma levels of the robust nutrition-and antioxidant defense-related biomarkers carotenoids and tocopherols with both indicators of cognitive and physical performance-within the established field of nutritional cognitive neuroscience-was investigated in a group of persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participating in a structured exercise program at the German Sport University in Cologne, Germany. Participants and methods: At baseline and after one year of either aerobic (AE) or stretching and toning (S&T) exercise, 73 participants (36 F, 37 M, 72.3 \u00b1 5.6 years) underwent cognitive and motoric performance tests as well as blood withdrawal. Carotenoids including lutein, zeaxanthin, b-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and aand b-carotene were analysed by HPLC with UV/vis detection at 450 nm. A second UV/vis detector was connected in series and set at 325 and 292 nm for quantitation of retinol (vitamin A), and aand c-tocopherol (vitamin E), respectively. Results: With respect to the associations found at baseline and published in Gerger et al., Nutrients 2019, when specifically looking at the physical performance outcome measures significant correlations at FU were found, independently of fruit and vegetable intake, between plasma levels of lutein and number of steps per day (S&T group) (p \\ 0.05), lutein and chair-rising test (S&T group) (p = 0.002), zeaxanthin and chair-rising test (S&T group) (p = 0.003), bcryptoxanthin and Timed Up&Go test (AE) (p \\ 0.02), b-carotene and chair-rising test (S&T group) (p = 0.001), a-tocopherol and number of steps per day (S&T group) (p\\0.05). Correlation analyses with cognitive measures are ongoing.

It has a specific behavior that transformed the infection initially localized in a single country in Asia into a real pandemic, situation never faced by mankind since 1918. There have been many data regarding this COVID-19 but for the time being it seems to be too early to draw some final conclusions regarding the complete epidemiologic characterization of this virus as well as effectiveness of various therapeutic approaches available, including development of some new vaccines. One striking aspect that maybe did not receive enough attention is a huge difference regarding prevalence of infections and deaths rates due to or related to COVID-19 between developed countries and developing Eastern European countries: 20-40 times lower in the latter. It is interesting to note that this pattern can be observed even in the immigrant communities that originated in Eastern European countries but lived in developed countries. Several populational characteristics are reviewed, including the compulsory anti-tuberculous (BCG) vaccination that was performed in all Eastern European countries, unlike the situation of developed countries (in Europe and other continents).Methods: We used admission data from ED and the COVID assessment unit to gather patient data over a 10 week period. We then used PIPE laboratory software and McKesson Radiology for results of investigations and clinical course. Results: 78 residents were admitted via the COVID assessment unit during this time. 12 patients passed away, and 9 of these tested positive for COVID-19. 64% of patients tested positive or where treated as such due to high clinical suspicion.The age groups were Many nursing home residents were admitted during the COVID pandemic for other medical reasons and this is important given that many issues may be reversible. The long length of stay of many of our patients warrants further investigation and care planning. Our findings in laboratory data and symptoms reflect the findings of other institutions in this patient group.Malaysia is only starting to age in 2020 where it becomes a home for 2.4 million older adults aged over 65 years. As the population ages, the number of older persons with frailty and multimorbidity will increase. Around 1% of Malaysian older persons were cared for in the care homes. COVID-19 impacted care homes in Malaysia differently in a way that it has more than 1400 care homes but only a quarter of that number was registered under the Malaysian law. The long-term care facilities in Malaysia were fragmented and multiple stakeholders Data will include an estimated 30,000 call records from the 1733-out-of-hs telephone triage call center in Belgium (more information available at: https://www.health.belgium.be/en/health/need -call-doctor-call-1733) obtained 3 months prior to-, during-, and after the Covid-19 pandemic peak. All calls concerning medical assistance for older patients (over 65 years of age) between December Data collection is currently in process. Findings will be analyzed and made available for presentation at the EuGMS 2020 digital congress. Conclusion: The current research will allow us to better understand how telephone triage services are used by older persons during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. In our cohort, presenting with falls, delirium and functional decline was as likely as with fever, cough and SOB. 30% of our cohort did not have any of the typical symptoms of fever, cough or SOB at presentation. Half of patients were delirious at presentation.Abisoye O. Akintimehin 1 , David Smithard 1 , Penelope J.

The mortality risk in confirmed Covid-19 residents was 3 times higher than in residents where COVID-19 was ruled out, especially for men. This increased risk could not be explained by differences in age, gender and comorbidities. Testing residents and staff with low symptomatic disease and their contacts together with provision of PPE declined infection rate in the nursing homes. The availability of blanket testing through official organisations started after the steep rise in infections. Despite the high number of infected residents, the hospitalisation of patients stayed below the annual rate. To establish whether there was a change in number and type of referrals to A&E when comparing referrals done in the two eras. Method: All patients who were transferred to A&E from SVP in April-May 2019 and April-May 2020 were included in the study. The search was carried out via iSOFT. Patients' demographics, investigations and diagnosis were looked at. 19 positive subjects were twice as high as that of COVID-19 negative subjects of the same cohort and at mortality rates during the same period during the previous 2 years.

Implementation relies on our population's ability to access and operate smart technology. Exploring practicalities with hospitalised older adults informs our virtual clinic design and protects against disadvantaging this group. Methods: Survey of older adults (n = 30) within Department of Medicine for the Elderly in an acute teaching hospital. Convenience sample. Exclusions: Those treated under Adults with Incapacity, unable to engage due to acuity of illness, or approaching end of life. Results: Mean age: 78 \u00b1 11.7 years. Whilst 87% (26/30) had access to a mobile device -only 40% had access whilst in hospital. The commonest use was audio calls (at least daily in 54%). In comparison, 88% had never used video-calling. Those with the highest self-reported competence in using their devices typically limited their use to audio calls. 35% felt limited by impaired vision; 23% by impaired hearing. When prompted, only 62% could switch on and unlock their device -and only 2 could access the virtual clinic test page (launch browser and manually enter URL). Our review has confirmed reduction in ED attendance but patients were more likely to be admitted to hospital with significant rise in the mortality. As expected, older patients especially above the age of 75 years were worse affected during COVID-19 pandemic.Hip fractures outcomes during COVID-19 pandemic in a district general hospital in United KingdomRadcliffe Lisk 1 , Carley Allen 1 , Hazel Watters 1 , Keefai Yeong 1 , Rashid Mahmood 1Ashford and St Peters NHS Foundation Trust, Chertsey, United KingdomIntroduction: Pandemics, like COVID-19, test the resilience of tested healthcare models. It is important to establish if these models were still capable of delivering high quality care during COVID-19 especially to older people presenting fracture neck of femur (NOF). At Ashford and St Peters NHS Trust, we operate shared care model, where patients are cared for by named orthopaedic surgeon and orthogeriatrician. During pandemic, orthogeriatricians were deployed on COVID-19 wards to support medical division. In newly configured services, NOF patients were moved to non-COVID hospital (Ashford), part of our trust, on day 5-7 postoperatively, and were solely looked after by orthopaedic team without the support of their medical counterpart. Method: Data of patients with fracture NOF was collected during the COVID-19 period (March-May 2020) and variables were compared with the data available from the same period from2018  and 2019.

In this paper, we describe the characteristics of our patients with the aim to understand the repercussions of this infection in elderly patients. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, observational study. 43 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to our Geriatric Unit a\u1e97 Hospital San Jos\u00e9 between February and May 2020. We collected multiple types of data, including sociodemographic, functional, cognitive variables, comorbidity, risk factors, length of stay and destination upon discharge.Results: 43 patients were included. Average age: 85.3 years old. Gender: men 53.5%, women 46.5%. Place of residence: 25.6% lived at home and 74.4% in an elderly residence. Marital status: single 18.6%, married 27.9%, widower 48.8%. Barthel index: independent 9.3%, slight dependency 27.9%, moderate dependency 16.3%, severe dependency 39.6%, total dependency 6.9%. Comorbidities: High blood pressure 76.7%, nutritional deficit 62.8%, dementia 47.7%. Hospital admission in the last 3 months for pneumonia or flu 25.6%. Average length of stay: 19.67 days. Destination upon discharge: elderly residence 49%, home 12%. 37% of the patients died during hospitalization. Conclusions: In this study, the average patient admitted with COVID-19 was an 85-year-old man, institutionalized, with severe dependence for basic activities of daily living, with high blood pressure and nutritional deficit, with a prolonged length of hospitalization and destination upon discharge to an elderly residence.

In the United Kingdom, care homes are largely run by private providers with healthcare accessed through general practitioners and community/ hospital services. As a care home provider, there is a need not only to reflect on the challenges, but also the gains during the pandemic. Methods: We reflect our perspective on how the change in working relationships between our care homes in South London and local healthcare services produced different processes of care. Whilst the COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on care homes and their residents, it has offered opportunities to build better integrated and collaborative working relationships between care homes and healthcare. 4% of them were men. They filled out the Depression,. In the adaptation process of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale were performed. Results: This study included 149 respondents from Malatya. In total, 72.5% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 14.8% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 57.7% reported moderate to severe depression symptoms;Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, UKIntroduction: It is crucial for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) to receive their medications in a timely manner as delays can cause worsening symptoms. 1 Parkinson's UK launched the 'Get it on Time' campaign to raise awareness and have advised that patients continue taking their medications as prescribed during the COVID-19 pandemic. 2 During the pandemic we conducted the second round of a Quality Improvement Project (QIP) in Barnet Hospital (United Kingdom) that had initially identified significant delays in PD medication administration among acute admissions, adapted to identify its impact on COVID-19 patients. Methods: Audit of patients with PD and a community prescription of medications to treat PD, admitted via Barnet Hospital emergency department over 3 months. We collected data on times to PD medication prescription and administration (including rationale for delays) and COVID-19 PCR status. Any deviation C 1 h from community prescription time was categorised as a delay. Almost half of the patients admitted to our hospital for severe COVID-19 were 70 years or older. Differences were observed in the rates of use of empiric drug treatments for COVID-19, with a reduced use of most drugs in older patients.Introduction: Even though prevention measures have been implemented early during COVID-19 pandemic there have been six Coronavirus outbreaks in the City of Zurich Nursing Homes in total. Residents and employees who tested positive or had contact with infected persons were identified as presumptive infection sources. However, two sources kept unknown. At the beginning of April, there were a series of outbreaks in two nursing homes, which were difficult to contain. A stringent cohort testing of all residents and employees in affected wards was carried out. Thus resulted in the detection of a high percentage of asymptomatic residents tested positive. Methods: To identify the spreading of infection retrospectively as well as to describe the outbreaks in chronological order we analyse data available from both residents and employees. Case series of 121 old aged patients with asymptomatic, mild, severe and critical courses will be analysed to gain further knowledge with respect to this specific population. Results: The preliminary results show that beside the high proportion of asymptomatic patients there are many oligosymptomatic patients, as well as a high proportion of critical cases and deaths. Conclusions: Our experiences show that 40% of virus carriers are asymptomatic upon diagnosis. For this reason, broad testing is needed in nursing home wards with COVID-19 infections. This approach is worth the effort, due to the high lethality of the COVID-19 virus in nursing homes. Frail older patients may be more vulnerable to negative triage practices, especially in cases where specialized care for older people is undervalued by national health care systems. Key conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic revealed a possibly underlying predisposition to unfavorable for the older patient distribution of limited health care resources. Geriatric medicine principles should be applied in and out of the context of sanitary crisis, may contribute to the formation of positive attitudes towards older age and may aid distributive justice and medically and ethically difficult decision making.COVID-19 pandemic response in Greece: awareness and concerns of primary health care professionals.

Its professional data warehouse is operational today in 298 French nursing homes (NH) and hosts all residents' data including the residents' care narratives fed on a daily basis. In the past, we designed syndromes by using the standard query language.Burnout syndrome among healthcare professionals in DR C.I. Parhon Hospital Geriatric Department During TheCOVID 19   Pandemic. We conducted a prospective, hospital-based study, to determine the presence of burnout among medical staff. We applied a burnout questionnaire to all medical staff involved in the monitoring and treatment of patients suspected of COVID 19 (doctors, resident doctors, and nurses), in the Geriatrics and Gerontology department of Dr C.I Parhon hospital. Results: As the COVID 19 pandemic continues, very important clinical strategies are needed to be able to support healthcare professionals. It is crucial to understand the psycho-emotional impact of the COVID-19 outbreak among them in order to maintain their psychological well-being in particular, given that a considerable proportion of health workers have reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia and suffering.Conclusions: There is a significant reduction in patients who have been examined in the O.C. of H.C. of Vari, compared to the same period last year. The same finding has been found in other health care units. This phenomenon is under study in order to discover the causes that cause it. The number of comorbidities of inpatients from nursing homes was measured to evaluate the impact in COVID-19 mortality. Chi-square and Relative Risk [RR] were used and a p-value \\ 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results: There were 283 hospital admissions which 47.3% were elderly and 51.9% females. Of those, 32.9% of the patients came from NH and frailty was identified in 87.1% of the episodes. The overall mortality was 33.6% and considering patients from NH the RR = Background: Frailty predicts inpatient mortality and length of stay, but its link to COVID-19 is under researched. Objective: Evaluate and compare the frailty in the COVID-19 ward and Internal Medicine ward. Methods: Prospective Observational Study in a tertiary Portuguese hospital. Were analyzed every inpatients between March 17th to May 31st 2020. Data was acquired from the hospital information systems. Patients were classified within a clinical frailty scale as no frail (CFS 1-4) and frail (CFS 5-8). Chi-square and t-test were used and a p-value \\ 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The Relative Risk was also performed. Results: There were 814 hospitalization episodes, which 65.2% belonged to medicine ward. There were 52.5% females and the mean age was 81 years old. The age group C 65 years old represented 81.8% of the admissions and the age group C 80 was 55%. Of all episodes, 57.7% of them were frail patients, of which 26.4 % belongs to COVID-19 ward. The length of stay was lower for internal medicine ward [10.46 p = 0.0001] but in frailty patients there was no difference. The overall mortality was 26.7% and there was no difference between wards. If we consider the frail patients, in COVID-19 ward the Relative Risk was 1.43. Conclusion: In this study frailty is linked to mortality in COVID-19 patients, but not to length of stay.

This pilot study assessed(1)  the Vet2Vet Maine mission to reduce veterans' social isolation and loneliness; and (12 effects of the program on care-partners. Methods: Mixed-methods research spanned 6-months from 2019 to 2020. Trained older Veteran Volunteers-VV (8 males/2 females) were paired with older Veteran Friends-VF (8 males/2 females); also Veteran Friend's Care-Partners-CP (1 male/3 females) participated. VVs completed pre/post Veteran Rand 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). VFs completed pre/post VR-12, PHQ-9, and Late Onset Stress Symptomatology (LOSS) Short-Form. CPs completed pre/post Zarit Burden Interview-22. After 6-months, VV and VF qualitative interviews were conducted in pairs; CPs were interviewed individually. Data (pre/post assessments) were analyzed with the Wilcoxon-Sign-Test and NVivo 12 + Qualitative Software. Results: COVID-19 was a confounding variable as Maine state stayat-home orders occurred at the study mid-point. Pre/post data failed to exhibit significance (P = 0.05). VR-12 and LOSS scores exhibited increases in stress/poor-health. Four qualitative themes were selected: (1) Effects of COVID; (2) Veteran Volunteers and Veteran Friends;(3) Care-Partners; and (4) Three-Words. Despite differences in interests or military background, VV and VFs valued their commonality as veterans. CPs confirmed the importance and benefits of these relationships. COVID dramatically affected the number and nature of visits reducing contact hours by 72%. Conclusions: The Vet2Vet Maine companion program relies on Veterans' face-to-face visits; COVID interfered with fostering companionship, mentoring, and supporting the Veterans' independence.Introduction: In 2016, the National Point Prevalence Survey showed 62.5% of antibiotic prescriptions for Lower UTI were inappropriate. This has a significant impact on clinical effectiveness; it leads to increased admissions with recurrent Lower UTI and urosepsis, whilst also promoting antimicrobial resistance and healthcare associated infections such as C. Difficile. Method: This resulted in a national CQUIN being created in April 2019 that focused on improving the management of Lower UTI in older people. The CQUIN set a mandate of achieving 90% of antibiotic prescriptions for Lower UTI in older people meeting NICE guidance for Lower UTI and PHE diagnosis of UTI guidance in terms of diagnosis and treatment. Our baseline audit showed 29% compliance in North Middlesex ED department. We created a focus group with ED staff and identified factors contributing to our primary outcome. We implemented changes targeted to these contributing factors using quality improvement methodology. We had a total of 3 iterative PDSA cycles and each cycle served as an audit-feedback loop. Implemented changes ranged from organising an educational programme for ED staff to applying behavioural change techniques using COM-B model. Results: Our results showed dramatic improvement in each criteria over 3 quarters. Prescribed antibiotics are now compliant with NICE in 90% of cases compared with 44% in cycle 1. Nitrofurantoin and Fosfomycin now make-up 83% of prescriptions, compared to 18% in cycle 1. Whilst co-amoxiclav, which has resistance rates [20%, fell from 45% in cycle 1-9%. Conclusion: We used QI Methodology at the frontline to make significant and sustainable improvements in the diagnosis and management of Lower UTI in the over 65's. We were on target to reach the CQUIN mandate but failed to reach due to COVID-19.Assessment of health status and lifestyle habits of vulnerable, community-dwelling older adults during the covid-19 confinement M\u00f3nica Mach\u00f3n 1 , Maider Mateo-Abad 2 , Kalliopi Vrotsou 1 , Naiara Pe\u00f1a 3 , Leonor Rico 3 , Itziar Vergara 4 1 1.

Results wereevaluated against the Blue Book standards and recommendations made. Method: prospective QIP, conducted in a district general hospital, London, UK, March -June 2020. All patients admitted with hip fracture wereincluded. Data gathered from medical notes and electronic patients'records was recorded. Results: 71 patients, mean age 84 y.o., more females [66% F: 34% M]. All patients were assessed by a Geriatrician/Registrar within 12-24 h of admission. A full MDT CGA was done in 3% [March] and 4.2% [April] of cases. Improvement was noted for May 9.4% and  June 19%. The decline in COVID incidence appear to improve the service provision in May/June. Pre-fracture bone protection improved from 38% to 83% post fracture. None of the patients developed thromboembolic disease. Comorbidities and frailty syndromes were documented in 54% cases. The median length of stay was 30 days: postoperative delirium, sepsis and advance frailty were identifiable causes. April had 7 % COVID induced delirium vs 3.5% inMay and  1.4%  in June. 30 days cumulative mortality was 4.8% in March vs 7% in June. Advance frailty and postoperative complications can explain the surge. Readmissions improved consistently: March 30%: June 0%. Conclusion: COVID had a negative impact across all the standards of care for hip fractures patients. This may guide future service development in the event of a second COVID pandemia. Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK, 2 Midlothian Health and Social Care Partnership, Dalkeith, UK, 3 British Red Cross, Midlothian, UK, 4 Public Health Scotland, Edinburgh, UKIntroduction: The frail elderly are considered high risk for COVID-19 but, for some, the stay at home policies intended to protect them have threatened their wellbeing and disrupted their support systems. Those without close family or friends are most vulnerable. Recognising this, we aimed to introduce a dedicated service to support the health and wellbeing of the frail elderly in Midlothian, Scotland. Methods Midlothian Health and Social Care Partnership, in partnership with British Red Cross (BRC), provided a proactive welfare calls service. Moderately and severely frail patients were identified using the electronic Frailty Index (a 'cumulative deficit' approach, using coding from primary care health records). BRC staff and volunteers contacted patients to offer advice, to ensure wellbeing and to identify needs requiring action. Results The purpose of this Quality Improvement 10 of 12 GP Practices opted in. Of 83425 registered patients, 1929 (2.3%) were identified as moderately frail and 780 (9.3%) as severely frail. Between April and May 2020, 2630 (97%) calls were made. Although most patients had support from family or friends, 209 (8%) requested at least one intervention. These included groceries (159-76%), social calls to mitigate loneliness (41-20%) and provision of hearing aid batteries (27-13%). Informal feedback from patients was positive. Conclusions: This innovative relationship between GPs and BRC has enabled a proactive support service to be delivered to the frailest patients, who otherwise may not have received the help they needed during the pandemic. It has also benefitted GP Practices as certain social problems are now being addressed effectively elsewhere. Galliera Hospital, Genova, Italy, Department of Interdisciplinary Medicine, University of Bari, Italy; Department of Geriatric Care, Orthogeriatrics and Rehabilitation, Galliera Hospital, Genova, Italy Background: Between March and May 2020 Italian Health authorities imposed strict lock-down measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of this, many vulnerable older patients with chronic conditions, normally followed in ambulatory setting, needed to be monitored and managed in alternative ways, including telemedicine. Aim:The Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI) is a well-established CGA-based tool able to assess patient prognosis. In the framework of a telemedicine program, we aimed to validate a telephone-administered version of the MPI (TELE-MPI) among community-dwelling older outpatients.Methods. From March 9 to May 11, 2020, 131 older patients (mean age 82.1 \u00b1 6.6 years; males = 26%), were contacted by telephone and interviewed by using a telephone-based survey to calculate the TELE-MPI. The TELE-MPI included the same scales of standard MPI to explore eight relevant domains, i.e. basal and instrumental activities of daily living, cognitive, nutrition, mobility, comorbidity, polypharmacy and cohabitation status. The standard MPI was performed by health professionals three months before or after the TELE-MPI. The Bland-Altman methodology was used to measure the agreement between MPI and TELE-MPI. Results: The mean MPI and TELE-MPI values were 0.Lower and upper 95% limits of agreement were -0.122 and + 0.124, respectively, with only 6 of 131 (4.6%) of observations outside the limits. Conclusions: TELE-MPI showed a strong agreement with the standard MPI. TELE-MPI may represent an useful way to follow by remote the health status of older adults and to promptly identify changes in their prognosis.Fear of falls of the elderly during the COVID-19 lockdown University of Patras (U.P), Medicine School of Patras (M.S.P), Greece, 2 University Hospital of Rio, Patras (U.H.P), Greece, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University Hospital of Heraklion (U.H.H), Crete, Greece, 4 Rehabilitation Department, University of Patras (U.P), Rio-Patras, GreeceIntroduction: Fear of falls is connected with negative outcomes, such as reduced quality of life, mobility and social contact. The aim of this study was to compare the fear of falls of the elderly before and during the emergency lockdown measures of COVID-19 in Patras. This research is co-financed by Greece and the European Union (European Social Fund-ESF) through the Operational Programme \u00abHuman Resources Development,Education and Lifelong Learning  2014-2020\u00bb  in the context of the project ''A Holistic Interdisciplinary Approach to Treating Patients with Fragility Fractures'' (MIS 5047167). Method: The cross-sectional study was conducted in January-March 2020, with random sampling from the list of members of an Open Protection Centre for the Elderly of Patras. The sample size was 64 people over 65 years, while the response rate of the repeat telephone interview was 85.93% (n = 55). The Falls Efficacy Scale International (FES-I) Greek questionnaire was used to investigate the fear of falls. Results: The largest percentage of the sample had a high fear of falls in both of FES-I measurements. Moreover, it was observed that in a short period of up to two months there was a significant reduction in fear of falls. Women had higher mean values of fear of falls compared to men. Finally, the Spearman's non-parametric r control showed a positive correlation of the fear of falls before and during the lockdown (r = 0.744, p\\0.05).Conclusions: The research showed a high fear of falls among the elderly, which was moderated during the pandemic.The Continuing Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Admissions to an Acute General Hospital Stroke Unit Introduction: In England, lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic was announced on the 23rd March 2020. Some patient groups have been more reluctant to attend hospital during this time. Management of a stroke is time-sensitive and delay in presentation may affect initial management and long-term outcome.Methods:Statistical analysis of the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) data and Bolton Hospital admission data, including time of symptoms on admission, tertiary centre management and length of stay (LOS).

This retrospective observational study investigates whether pre-admission anticoagulation (with Warfarin or Direct Oral Anticoagulant (DOAC)) improves all-cause mortality for geriatric COVID-19 patients compared to those who are not anticoagulated preadmission.Methods: A total of 309 patients aged 70 and over who were admitted to a district general hospital in South-East England between March 15th and May 31st 2020 were included. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed with viral PCR testing during that admission. Preadmission anticoagulant therapy was ascertained by looking at the medications section of the most recent hospital discharge letter on electronic records. Results: A total of 81 (26.2%) were prescribed oral anticoagulation prior to admission, 69 were on a DOAC and 12 on Warfarin. Pre-admission anticoagulation therapy does not appear to improve all-cause mortality for elderly patients with COVID-19, suggesting that patients on anticoagulation therapy have the same mortality rate as those who are not taking these agents.References: [1] Middeldorp, S, Coppens, M, van Haaps, TF, et al.

Methods: Senior-COVID-Rea is a multicentric survey designed to evaluate, on health data, in patients over 60 admitted in ICU for severe COVID-19 disease, the impact of age, geriatric parameters and paraclinical covariates on their mortality at 30 days of their admission. All patients over 60 admitted in ICU for severe COVID-19 infection (or their caregiver) were proposed to enter the study and to fulfill a questionnaire on their functional parameters prior (1 month before) COVID infection. Results: From March to May 2020, 232 patients where included in 7 hospitals. Median age was 73, 75% were male, 21% [ 2 comorbidities grade 2 or higher according CIRS-G, 21% and 30% had ADL and IADL disability respectively, 23% had at least 3 Fried's criteria.

This retrospective analysis aims to compare the differences around end of life (EoL) care received when lead by geriatricians compared to other medical specialties. Method: Parameters surrounding EoL Care were extracted from the electronic patient record of patients over the age of 65 admitted during the pandemic peak (16/03/2020-30/04/2020) who passed away. Results: 251 patients greater than 65 years were admitted for which the mortality rate was 45%. 90 patients who passed away were identified with a mean age of 82 years, male: female ratio 47:43. The median clinical frailly score was 6. They have been subdivided into two groups: Group A care delivered by a geriatrician (38%) and group B care delivered by general medical specialities. Group A: 82% EoL pathway initiated, 94% EoL medications prescribed, 87% EoL medications given, 33% on syringe driver, 85% families updated and 53% palliative care involvement. Group B: 74% EoL pathway initiated, 88% EoL medications prescribed, 82% EoL medications given, 22% on syringe driver, 76% families updated and 31% palliative care involvement. Conclusion: Despite the challenges faced during the Covid pandemic, patients were well managed at the EoL with practice adapted accordingly. Standard of EoL care delivered was similar between non-geriatricians and geriatricians.Managing delirium in patients with COVID-19-lessons to learnOmolade Okuwoga 1 , Sophie Picton 1 , Sadia Saber 1 , Cianan O'Sullivan 1Homerton University HospitalIntroduction: Delirium is an acute confusional state that affects cognition and alertness. Older adults were disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, in terms of susceptibly to the virus itself and to developing delirium as a result of the acute infection. This study evaluates the methods used to manage delirium in patients with COVID-19. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted of electronic patient records of patients aged [65 who were admitted to Homerton University Hospital (London, UK) with coronavirus. Admissions during a 6-week period spanning the peak of the outbreak were included. Data was collected to establish what medical and psychosocial methods were used to manage delirium in patients with COVID-19. Results: A total of 104 patients (mean age 84) with coronavirus were identified as having a concurrent diagnosis of delirium. 87.5% of patients received oxygen therapy. 58.7% of patients received injectable medications for symptomatic relief of agitation. 39% of all patients received psychosocial support-27.9% had family visitors, 9.6% were able to communicate with family using telecommunication methods and 2 patients were referred for review by the Psychiatry team.Conclusion: This study shows that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable impact on the care of older adults. Particularly, in managing older adults with COVID-19 and delirium, the focus is easily drawn to medically treating the virus as a potential underlying cause of delirium. However, there is a need to consider the use of psychosocial methods and pharmacological treatment to actively manage the delirium.Geriatrics. Hospital Central de la Cruz Roja, San Jos\u00e9 y Santa Adela, Cardiology. Hospital Central de la Cruz Roja, San Jos\u00e9 y Santa Adela Introduction: A prolonged QT interval in older patients seems to be associated with increased mortality. In the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the combination of drugs such as hydroxychloroquine/ azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine/lopinavir have a QT interval prolonging effect. We analyze the electrocardiographic changes, arrhythmic profile and their association with mortality in older patient. Methods: Unicenter ambispective cross-sectional study. Older adults C 75 admitted to an Acute Geriatric Unit diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection (confirmed by RT-PCR or suspected by clinical and imaging) from March and April 2020. Polypharmacy and cardiological comorbidities were collected. We selected all those patients with electrocardiogram (ECG) performed 48 h after starting medical treatment with any drug for SARS-CoV-2. Corrected QT was measured using the Bazett's formula. Prolonged QT was considered for women [ 470 msc and for men [ 450 msc. Results: The mean age was 86 \u00b1 6.5 (68.2% women, 60.6% hypertension and 26% atrial fibrillation). We observed 43.9% of polypharmacy (C 5 drugs) and 27.3% of extreme polypharmacy (C 10 drugs). The average QT was 430 \u00b1 47.43 msc. About SARS-CoV-2 treatment: 87.5% received hydroxychloroquine, 60% azithromycin and 18.2% lopinavir being the most frequent combination hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (48.5%). In univariate binary regression analysis, only antidepressants were associated with a prolonged QT (p = 0.09). In multivariate analysis, no drugs or cardiovascular morbidity was associated with a prolonged QT. Conclusions: In our cohort only 24.6% of the population presented prolonged QT, there was no severe arrhythmia during treatment for SARS-CoV-2 and mortality wasnt associated with prolonged QT.COVID 19 outbreak: organisation of a geriatric assessment and coordination unit. A French exampleIntroduction: During the COVID 19 outbreak, the assessment of the appropriate level of care for each older person and the organization of appropriate healthcare networks was essential. Methods: We have created a centralized unit dedicated to evaluation, geriatric care coordination, including territorial organization and individual decision support. It is coordinated by a geriatrician and includes emergency physicians as well as a medical hygienist, a physician specializing in infectious diseases and a palliative care specialist.The individual level of care decision was made by the unit in two stages: an initial assessment according to the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), followed by a search for additional information to allow for collegial discussion if necessary, thus ensuring a systematic personalized approach to the level of care from ''non-limiting intensive care'' to ''symptomatic management in the newly created 17-bed COVID + palliative unit''.Results:The call platform received 235 calls in 16 days. Of these, 80% (N = 189) concerned requests for assistance in determining the level of care. From them, 99 patients residing in nursing home. 11 % of nursing home residents were transferred to hospital (N = 11), including 2 patients for palliative unit management. 52% (N = 38) of the patients residing at home were transferred to the hospital they were geographically dependent. The remaining 46 calls were about various issues: hygiene, drug supply, feedback on organizational problems. Conclusion: This model allowed a reasoned and individualized ethics of access to care, allowing the avoidance of a form of ageism in pandemic situation.Introduction: During the coronavirus outbreak, medication reconciliation (MR) and pharmaceutical analysis of prescription were reinforced in the ward housing patients awaiting the outcome of coronavirus PCR and/or imaging. The objective of this work was to assess the clinical impact of this activity. Methods: Between March 23rd and April 27th 2020, three pharmacists have recorded alternately for each patient reconciled all data relative to pharmaceutical interventions (PIs) carried out. Clinical impact was assessed[1]. Results: 294 patients (mean age 78.2 years old) were admitted in the unit. 170 medication reconciliations (MRs) were performed (58% of patients), notably 33% proactively; 143 unintended discrepancies (UDs) have been corrected (mean 1.3 UD by retroactive MR) and mainly concerned drugs from nervous system (27%) and alimentary tract and metabolism (24%). The most frequent UD were non-prescribed drug after transfer (57%) and supra-therapeutic dosage (17%). The clinical impact was major in 11% of cases. 79% of patients were transferred in another ward. Moreover, 113 PIs were done which 61% (69 PIs) were accepted. They concerned mainly drugs from cardiovascular system (25%) and blood and forming organs (23%). The most frequent inappropriate prescriptions were therapeutic drug monitoring requested (22%) and supra-therapeutic dosage (16%). The clinical impact was major in 13% of cases. Overall 25 PIs with a major clinical impact were accepted representing 1.3 per day and 0.1 per patient. Key conclusion: The presence of pharmacists in the unit allowed correcting many inappropriate prescriptions and reduce the risk of adverse drug events, which was really appreciated by physicians.Bibliography: [1] Vo TH, Charpiat B, Catoire C, Juste M, Roubille R, Rose F-X, et al.

Besides mortality, patients experience relevant disability related to complications requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission or functional decline due to immobilization. Early and effective rehabilitation interventions are urgent. Aim: describe pre-post impact on physical performance of multi-component therapeutic exercise for post-COVID-19 rehabilitation. Methods: Cohort study of post-COVID-19 patients in post-acute care. We collected demographical and clinical variables, cognitive status at admission, pre-COVID functional and frailty status. Intervention: 30-min 7-days/week multi-component therapeutic exercise.Outcomes: Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB, gait speed, balance and chair-stand sub-tests Barthel Index for activities of daily living, ability to walk unassisted and single-podal balance.

Higher improvement in the post-ICU group might be due to their younger age and better functional and clinical status pre-COVID-19. We need future research with larger study samples to better investigate and validate therapeutic exercise as a rehabilitation tool.QTc prolungation risk score and hydroxychroloquine in COVID 19 patients: our experienceAlberto Castagna 1 , Raffaele Costa 2 , Carmen Ruberto 1 , Michela Pugliese 3 , Carlo Torchia 1 , Viviana Vespertini 4 , Lucio Cosco 4 , Giovanni Ruotolo 5 Center for Cognitive Disorders and Dementia, Azienda Sanitaria Provinciale di Catanzaro, Italy, 2 Geriatric Unit, ''Pugliese-Ciaccio'' General Hospital, Catanzaro, Italy, 3 Direttore Sanitario RSA/Recc San Vito Hospital /Associazione Vivere Insieme, 4 Infectious Diseases Unit, ''Pugliese-Ciaccio'' General Hospital, Catanzaro, Italy,",

COVID-19: End of life care in older people. https://www.bgs.org.uk/resources/covid-19-end-of-life-care-in-olderpeople (Accessed on 29th June, 2020).Aim: To explore mortality associated with different empiric treatments for severe COVID-19 in hospitalized patients over 80 years old. Methods: We performed an observational retrospective study of all patients 10-20 years old hospitalized in a large hospital in Madrid with confirmed COVID-19 infection between 2nd March and 25th May. We assessed age, gender and hospital mortality by reviewing electronic medical records. Treatment was based on hospital protocols that changed along the study time. Drugs were used off-label, as no approved drug was available for COVID-19 at the time of the study.Results: 694 patients were included, mean age 86.2 \u00b1 4 years (80-104), 52.6 % men. In-hospital mortality was 39.3% (n = 273). Those who died were older (86.7 vs 85.9 years, p = 0.019), and used a similar number of drugs usd for COVID-19 treatment (mean 1.85 vs 1.89 drugs, p = 0.6). The most frequent drugs used were hidroxicloroquine (81.6%), lopinavir/ritonavir (49%) and azitromicine (39%), 13.8% did not receive any drug. There were no differences in mortality based on the number of drugs used. Patients who died received less azitromicine (32.6% vs 43, 5%, p = 0.04), less enoxaparin (79.9% vs 90.3%, p = 0.001) and more corticoids pulses (10.6% vs 5.2%, p = 0.011). We didnt find differences in mortality related to the use of other drugs as hidroxocloroquine (79.55 vs 82.9%, p = 0.Mortality during hospital admission in very old patients with severe COVID-19 was 39.3%. Patients who died were older, received less azitromicine and heparin and more corticoids. These findings are only exploratory and should be confirmed in prospective, controled trials. OH)2D) are associated with mortality. In line with the free hormone hypothesis some studies suggested that free 25 (OH)D levels might be a better predictor for clinical outcomes. Here, the association between total and free 25 (OH)D and 1, 25 (OH)2D with all-cause mortality in a prospective cohort of community-dwelling European men was examined. Methods: 1970 men, aged 40-79, participated in the European Male Ageing Study between 2003-2005. In 5 of 8 centres, survival status was available until 1 April 2018. Free 25 (OH)D and free 1, 25 (OH)2D were calculated. All measurements were divided into quintiles. Cox proportional hazard models were used, and results were expressed as hazard ratios (HR), adjusted for centre, BMI, smoking and self-reported health. Results: 524 (26.6%) men died during a mean follow-up of 12.3 \u00b1 3.4 years. Men in the lowest total 25 (OH)D and total 1, 25 (OH)2D quintile (cutoff \\ 9.3 lg/L and \\ 46 ng/L respectively) had increased mortality risk (HR compared to highest quintile [HR 1.83 (95% CI 1.34-2.50); p \\ 0.001 and 1.41 (1.04-1.90); p \\ 0.05 respectively]. Likewise, men in the lowest three free 25 (OH)D quintiles (levels \\ 4.43 ng/L) had a higher mortality risk compared to the highest quintile [HR 1.91 (1.34-.73); p \\ 0.001 for the lowest quintile]. However, mortality risk was similar across all free 1, 25 (OH)2D and DBP quintiles. Conclusions: Ageing men with low total 25 (OH)D, total 1, 25 (OH)2D and free 25 (OH)D levels but not low free 1, 25 (OH)2D have an increased future mortality risk. Hence, vitamin D deficiency is predictive for a higher mortality risk.The association between herpesvirus burden and mortality differs between older women and menTimo Strandberg 1 , Pentti Tienari 1 , Kaisu Pitk\u00e4l\u00e4 1University of Helsinki and Helsinki University HospitalIntroduction: There are sex differences in immune responses which may contribute to different susceptibility to Covid-19 between sexes. We tested whether also the association between herpesviridae and mortality differs between sexes among home-dwelling older people. Methods: The DEBATE study consists of 400 women (65.2%) and men aged 75-90 years and with a history cardiovascular disease. With other questionnaire, clinical and laboratory data (including education and APOE genotype) at baseline, 383 (95.8%) were assayed for serum anti-cytomegalovirus, anti hV-1 and anti hV-2 IgG antibody titers using enzyme immunoassay. Titers were summed up as herpesvirus burden (HVB) and divided in tertiles. Cox regression was used to assess 7-year mortality risk (hazard ratios[HR]  with 95% confidence interval [CI]). Results: HVB was significantly higher among women than men (P \\ 0.001). In the whole cohort (lowest HVB = 1.While being lower in older men as compared to women, higher herpesvirus burden was associated with increased mortality risk among men, not significantly among women. Differences in immune responses to common viruses may contribute to sex differences in longevity and mortality.TERC variants associated with short leukocyte telomeres: implication of higher early life leukocyte telomere attrition as assessed by the blood-and-muscle modelSimon Toupance 1 , Maria G.

            "text": "Anticoagulant prescription and mortality in older patients with atrial fibrillation: the european study of older subjects with atrial fibrillation study(EUROSAF)    Objectives: Some studies suggested that a different risk of mortality may influence the attitude of physicians in prescribing oral anticoagulants in older patients affected by atrial fibrillation (AF). The Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI) showed a high grade of accuracy, calibration and feasibility for predicting mortality in older people, but prognostic information calculated through the MPI class (i.e. MPI-1 low-risk, MPI-2 moderate risk, MPI-3 high risk of mortality) is not yet included in the decision algorithm of treatments in older patients affected by AF. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the use of oral anticoagulants and 1-year mortality in patients with different MPI score. Methods: Older hospitalized patients (age [ 65 years) with nonvalvular AF were included. At baseline, functional and clinical information will be collected to calculate the MPI, the CHA2DS2-VASC and the HAS-BLED scores. Results: At 1st June 2020, 1708 older patients affected by AF from 22 European centers were included (mean age = 82.9 \u00b1 7.5, range 65-104 years, women = 57.0%). The mean HAS-BLED and CHA2DS2-VASC scores indicated patients at both higher risk of major bleedings and thromboembolic events. The mean MPI score was 0.50 \u00b1 0.21 points, with 447 (= 26.2%) at low risk (MPI-1), 809 (= 47.4%) at intermediate risk (MPI-2) and 452 (26.5%) at high risk of mortality (MPI-3). During 1 year of follow-up and after adjusting for MPI at discharge, age, gender, HAS-BLED, CHA2DS2VASC, the use of new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) significantly decreased the Conclusions: In older patients with AF, the use of NOACs seems to decrease the risk of death compared to people not taking anticoagulants, independently from the MPI categories.Effect of nurse-coordinated transitional care in high risk older cardiac patients: the cardiac care bridge randomized clinical trial Center of Expertise Urban Vitality, Faculty of Health, Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, 2 Center of Expertise Urban Vitality, Faculty of Health, Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, Amsterdam, the Netherlands., 3 Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Department of Internal Medicine section of geriatrics, Amsterdam, the Netherlands., 4 OLVG hospital, department of Clinical Pharmacy, Amsterdam, the Netherlands., Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Department of Cardiology, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.Introduction: After hospitalization for cardiac disease, older patients are at high risk of readmission and death. Currently, the integration of cardiac and geriatric care is limited. The Cardiac Care Bridge transitional care program (CCB program) investigated if unplanned hospital readmission and mortality can be reduced by integrating case management, disease management and home-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR). Methods: The CCB program was a Dutch single-blinded, multicenter randomized clinical trial. All cardiac patients C 70 years, admitted C 48 h were eligible if they were at high risk of functional loss or if they experienced an unplanned hospital admission in the previous 6 months. The intervention included a comprehensive geriatric assessment and integrated care plan, a face-to-face handover with the community care registered nurse (CCRN) and four home visits. The CCRNs collaborated with physiotherapists who performed homebased CR and with a pharmacist in medication management. The primary composite outcome was first all-cause unplanned readmission or mortality within 6 months. Results: In total, 306 patients were included. The mean age was 82 years, 57% had heart failure and C 90% were acutely hospitalized. Nearly 50% have experienced a hospital admission or a fall in the previous 6 months. Furthermore, 31% were cognitively impaired (MMSE \\ 24), 39% had functional impairments (Katz-6) and 31% were at risk of malnutrition (SNAQ). The main unblinded study outcomes will be presented during the online EUGMS conference.Conclusions: This study provides new knowledge on the effectiveness of a nurse-coordinated, multidisciplinary transitional care program in high risk older cardiac patients (NTR6316, April 6, 2017).Short-term readmission and mortality after a pneumonia admission in older patients with dementia and use of benzodiazepines, opioids or anti-psychoticsResearch Unit for General Practice, Aarhus, Denmark. Department of Public Health, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark., 2 Research Unit for General Practice, Aarhus, Denmark.,3  Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus, Aarhus, Denmark. Department of Public Health, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark., 4 Department of Geriatrics, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark., 5 Department of General Practice, Melbourne University, Melbourne, Australia.Introduction: Pneumonia and dementia are commonly recognized as interlinked in the older population. Yet, despite this co-existence, little is known about the prognosis of people with dementia who survive their pneumonia admission, and whether the risk of an adverse event is modified by other factors, including medication often prescribed to people with dementia. Methods: For people with pneumonia aged 65-99 years in 2000-2016, we used the Danish registries to estimate risk of 30-day mortality and readmission by calculating mortality rate ratios (MRRs) and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for people with dementia compared to those without dementia. Further, we investigated whether there was an excess risk due to use of specific medications, and whether this risk was modified by age and time since discharge. Results: We found 298,872 pneumonia admissions, hereof 25,948 (8.7%) with dementia. Compared to pneumonia patients without dementia, risk of readmission was slightly higher (IRR 1.07, 95% CI 1.04-1.10) for those with dementia, whereas risk of mortality was 129% higher (MRR 2.29, 95% CI 2.21-2.37). For those with both dementia and use of anti-psychotics, there was a 16% (0.16, 95% CI 0.10-0.22) excess risk of dying, which was modified by age.Pneumonia patients with dementia had higher risk of dying throughout the 30 days follow-up regardless of medication use, whereas risk of readmission was only higher in the first three days after discharge. Conclusions: Knowledge about the prognosis following pneumonia for people with dementia is important in order to perform individualized advanced care planning at time of discharge.Introduction: Some studies have determined a bidirectional relationship between frailty and cognitive disorders. This relationship may be justified because both entities share common pathophysiological bases and adverse outcomes such as hospitalization, falls, fractures, disability, institutionalization, and mortality. This relationship could also be revealed through a possible response to common interventions. Aims: Examine whether an innovative multicomponente exercise programme (VIVIFRAIL) has benefits for cognitive function and mood status in pre-frail or frail patients aged 75 years, with a Barthel Index C 60 and mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia (GDS B 4). Methods: Multicentre randomized clinical trial conducted in the outpatient geriatrics clinics of three hospitals in Spain, with a Barthel Index C 60 and mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, pre-frail or frail according to Fried criteria and having someone to help to supervise them when conducting the exercises, were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group.The VIVIFRAILis a multicomponent exercise intervention programme (www.vivifrail.com) designed to improve functional capacity and decrease risk of falls for patients over 70 years old. Results: Preliminary sample 160 patients out of a total sample of 220, mean age of 83.45 (\u00b1 4.55) and Barthel 92.29 (\u00b1 9.74.) Subjects assigned to the intervention group obtained improvements in cognitive function measured by MOCA test (pre = 14.9 \u00b1 5.97, post = 16.74 \u00b1 7.62, p = 0.035) compared to the control group (pre = 10.98 \u00b1 8.09, post = 10.34 \u00b1 8.69, p = 0.035). In contrast, physical exercise did not show statistically improved improvements in cognitive function measured by the MMSE (p = 0.941). Using Yesavege test significal improvements were found in mood status in the intervention group (p = 0.047).Conclusion:If the preliminary results of this study are confirmed and the VIVIFRIAL exercise program is more effective than conventional care in improving cognitive function and mood, this project can help to change the current clinical care paradigm that is provided to frail patients with cognitive decline towards a more comprehensive management. Likewise, it is also foreseeable that it can help to generalize the prescription of physical exercise to this population group that is usually excluded from most research studies.Monetary value of informal caregiving in dementia from a societal perspectiveKaisu Pitkala 1 , Marja-Liisa Laakkonen 2 , Minna Raivio 1 , Eeva-Liisa Kallio 3 , Hannu Kautiainen 1 , Reijo Tilvis 4 , Timo Strandberg 4 , Hanna \u00d6 hman 4University of Helsinki, 2 Department of SocialServices and Health  Care, Helsinki Hospital, Geriatric Clinic, 3  Clinical Neurosciences, Neuropsychology, University ofHelsinki and Helsinki University  Hospital, 4  University of Helsinki, Clinicum, Department of Geriatrics Background and aim: Dementia is one of the most expensive geriatric syndromes, with informal care being the most costly portion of the total costs. In previous studies, informal caregiving has been challenging to assess due to difficulties in estimating true time spent on caregiving work and how to value caregivers' time. The aim of this study was to compare the costs of dementia among patients living alone and among those living with a caregiver to show the monetary value of informal caregiving from a societal perspective. Methods: Data from our four dementia trials using the same measures were combined, allowing 604 participants to be included. Participants were followed up for 2 years or until death for their use of health and social services. Use of all services was retrieved from medical/social records. We included also the costs of lost production of those caregivers who were not retired. Results: The total mean cost of services and lost production was 22,068 \u20ac/person-year (pyrs). Participants living alone had a mean cost of 45,156 \u20ac/pyrs, whereas those living with a spouse had a mean cost of 16,416 \u20ac/pyrs (mean cost ratio 2.99, 95% CI 2.64-3.39). Participants living alone and having \\ 15 MMSE points had higher costs than the corresponding dementia patients in institutional care.Key conclusions: Detailed data of service use and characteristics of patients with dementia showed that from a societal perspective living alone is a very strong determinant of service use in dementia. Informal caregivers do invaluable work for society.Beat-to-beat blood pressure variability and cognitive function among participants of the Malaysian Elders Longitudinal Research (MELoR) Study Nur Fazidah Asmuje 1 , Sumaiyah Mat 2 , Ai-Vyrn Chin 2 , Shahrul B. Kamaruzzaman 2 , Maw Pin Tan 2 Kolej Genius Insan, Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia; Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala LumpurIntroduction: Hypertension is considered an established risk factor for dementia is currently diagnosed using one-off measurements. Blood pressure, however, varies with each heartbeat. Blood pressure variability (BPV) has generated interest in the relation to stroke and cardiovascular events, but few studies have addressed BPV and cognitive performance. We, therefore, evaluated the relationship between BPV and cognitive performance in an urban multi-ethnic population. Methods: Participants to the Malaysian Elders Longitudinal Research (MELoR) study comprised individuals aged C 55 years selected through simple random sampling from three local parliamentary constituencies stratified by ethnicity. Cognition was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test. Systolic (SBP) and Diastolic (DBP) beat-to-beat BPV was generated through time domain index; average real variability (ARV) and frequency domain indices; low frequency (LF); high frequency and ratio LF/HF for supine and standing positions were determined using the Taskforce monitor (CNSytems, Austria). Results: Data on MoCA scores and BPV were available for 1246 participants. A significant difference between BPV was identified according to tertile MoCA scores for SBP-ARV, HF, ratio LF/HF and DBP LF/HF for the supine position (p \\ 0.001) while standing (p \\ 0.005). Increased SBP-ARV index was associated with an increase of Increased time-domain BPV and increased sympathovagal balance with frequency-domain BPV were associated with increased risk of MCI and dementia. Further analysis will seek to determine potentially modifiable factors mediating these differences.Introduction: The 4 'A's Test (4AT; www.the4AT.com) is a short (\\ 2 min) instrument for delirium detection that was purposely designed for use in clinical practice. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy of the 4AT for detecting delirium. Methods: We searched the following electronic databases through Ovid: MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO. Additional databases were searched: CINAHL (EBSCOhost), clinicaltrials.gov and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 2011 (4AT publication) until 21 December 2019. Inclusion criteria: older adults (C 65) across any setting of care except critical care; validation study of the 4AT against a delirium reference standard (standard diagnostic criteria or validated tool). Two reviewers independently screened Abstracts and papers and performed the data extraction. Pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were generated from a bivariate random effects model. Results: 17 studies (n = 3721 observations; total n with delirium = 945) were included. Various settings including acute medicine, surgery and the emergency department were represented.",

Methods: Single-blind, cluster-randomized, controlled trial (RCT) in 20 nursing home wards with 324 residents (with less than 12.-mo prognosis). The staff in the intervention wards received four smallgroup 4-h educational sessions on the principles of palliative care (advance care planning, the adverse effects of hospitalizations, symptom management, communication, giving support to proxies, challenging situations). The sessions were based on constructive learning theory, patient cases, roleplays and small-group discussions. Primary outcome measures were HRQOL by 15D assessed at baseline,6 and 12 months and hospital days/person/years during 2-year follow-up. Secondary outcomes were symptoms by Edmonton symptom assessment system (ESAS) and hospitalizations. Results: 15D declined in both groups and there was no difference in the changes between the groups (p for time \\ 0.001, group 0.75, interaction 0.26). There was no difference in the use of hospital days between the groups (IRR 2.12 (95% CI: 0.62-7.26, adjusted for age, sex, do-not-resuscitate orders and clustering). Total use of health care services was higher in the intervention thn in the control arms. There was no difference in the changes of ESAS or admissions to emergency department between the groups. Conclusions: Our rigorous RCT on palliative care intervention in NHs showed no effects on HRQOL or use of hospitals. The reasons behind this and similar trials should be explored in future studies.Clinical clustering of eight orthostatic haemodynamic patterns in The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA)Falls and Syncope Unit, Mercer's Institute for Successful Ageing, St  James's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland, 2  The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), Trinity College Dublin, Ireland Background: Identifying orthostatic hypotension (OH) has become complex due to implementation of non-invasive continuous beat-tobeat haemodynamic monitoring during active stand (AS) testing; this has resulted in large volumes of data outside the scope of the traditional OH definition.

However, studies have shown that frailty parameters were already present in young seniors. We sought to identify frailty profiles in individuals aged 50-75 by considering frailty as an unobservable latent variable in a latent class analysis (LCA). LC4, 11%; 67 years); and ''impaired balance, cognitive functions, and depression'' (LC5, 4.3%; 70 years). Almost all members of LC3 and LC4 were female, were more likely to have a frail or pre-frail Fried phenotype. Non-accidental falls were more frequent in LC4. LC5 (almost all males) had the highest number of comorbidities and cardiovascular risk factors but none was frail. Conclusions: Our data-driven approach identified five frailty profiles. With a view to tailoring interventions and prevention, frailty needs to be detected among young seniors.Introduction: Frailty have been associated with adverse outcomes.

A 5-year longitudinal cohort study in community-dwelling older people. underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) to calculate MPI; moreover, an assessment of physical functions were carried-out by means of the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Timed Up&Go test (TUGT), gait speed (GS) and handgrip strength test(HGS). A follow-up visit was scheduled 30 months later (V2) to repeat the same clinical and functional assessments. Mortality was then recorded over a 5-year period. Results: The mean age of participants at V1 was 77.5 \u00b1 4.5 years (females = 51.6%). 19 subjects (4.7%) died before V2; among the survivors, 261 (67%) agreed to undergo the V2 evaluation. Basal MPI mean value was 0.23 \u00b1 0.13. Compared to V1 values, the mean timechange of the MPI at V2 was + 0.06 \u00b1 0.08. The overall mortality during the 5-year follow-up was 13% (53 subjects). In a multiple Cox model including the time-changes between V1 and V2, only MPI resulted significantly associated with death (HR 1.04, p\\0.001), with an increase of 4% in 5-year mortality for each 0.1-increase in MPI values. No significant associations were observed between 5-year mortality and physical function parameters, i.e. SPPB, TUGT, GS, HGS.Conclusions: Frailty progression, as assessed by changes in the MPI score over time, is significantly associated with death in communitydwelling older people. The periodic re-assessment over-time of the MPI is useful for monitoring older people at risk of negative clinical outcomes.Using Point-of-care C-reactive protein to guide Antibiotic prescribing for Respiratory tract infections in Elderly nursing home residents (UPCARE)T.

Consequently, CRP POCT might reduce unnecessary antibiotic use. The overarching aim of the UPCARE study is to achieve better antibiotic stewardship by introducing a cheap, quick and easy-to-use diagnostic tool for the evaluation of LRTI in nursing homes: CRP POCT. Methods: The design of the study is a cluster randomized controlled trial conducted in eleven nursing homes in the Netherlands (September 2018 until April 2020), with the nursing home as the unit of randomization. Nursing homes in the intervention group use CRP POCT, and nursing homes in the control group provide care as usual without CRP POCT. Nursing home residents with a new diagnosis 'suspected LRTI' fit the inclusion criterion for study participation. Patients are excluded if they reside at hospice/palliative wards, if they recently had a different type of infection, if they do not wish to be treated with antibiotics, or if they are already taking antibiotics.The main outcome is antibiotic prescribing for suspected LRTl at index consultation (multilevel logistic regression analysis). Secondary outcomes are cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit of the use of CRP POCT, associations between CRP POCT values and antibiotic treatment (logistic regression analysis) respectively LRTI signs/symptoms (prediction model, linear regression analysis). and key conclusions: Results regarding the main outcome and part of secondary outcomes will be available and presented in October 2020.Survival after discharge from geriatrics vs internal medicine wards, by risk status and diagnosis Introduction: Previous research suggested that there might be distinct patterns of functional decline in the last years of life depending on the condition leading to death, but the validity of these results and hence the explanatory value of the condition leading to death for latelife disability are uncertain.Methods: A total of 636 decedents from a cohort of 754 communityliving persons, 70 + years of age (Yale PEP Study) provided 33,700 monthly observations of self-/proxy-reported disability during the last 5 years of life. Non-linear trajectories and short-term fluctuations of late-life disability by cause of death (cancer, organ failure, phenotypic frailty, severe dementia, sudden death, other) were estimated with flexible mixed spline regression models.Results: Trajectories of functioning at the end of life varied distinctively by the condition leading to death. Estimated disability trajectories among cancer deaths increased gradually up until about 6 months before death, after which a steep terminal decline set in. Among those who died from organ failure, frailty and dementia disability was higher, increased more gradually, and there was no clearcut terminal phase. Adding the condition leading to death to other known risk factors increased the amount of explained between-person variance in late-life functioning from R 2 = 0.35 to 0.49. Short-term fluctuations were not specific for decedents with organ failure.Conclusion:The condition leading to death is an important determinant of trajectories of functioning in late-life. These trajectories follow distinct patterns partially resembling a previously outlined theoretical typology.Comprehensive geriatric assessment using multidisciplinary meetings in care homes without nursingMillicent Metz 1 , Emma Ladi 1 , Sharjeel Hasan 2 , Tania Kalsi 3 Kings College London, 2 Quay Health Solutions Care Home Service, Dept of Ageing & Health, Guys & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust Introduction: Comprehensive Geriatric Assessments (CGA) and multi-disciplinary meetings (MDMs) are effective in improving decision-making and outcomes but is less evaluated in the setting of care homes without nursing. This quality improvement project evaluates feasibility and effectiveness of delivering CGA using MDMs in care homes without nursing. Methods: Retrospective review of clinical documentation using electronic patient records in London. Feasibility evaluated by professionals attendance, number of residents discussed and coverage of CGA domains. Effectiveness evaluated by number of intervention plans. Comparisons were made to CGA completed by a community geriatrician. Results: 95 residents discussed between Jan and Oct 2019 across 7 MDMs in 2 residential homes. Mean age 83 \u00b18.3 years (range 62-98), mean 8.0 comorbidities. 100% of meetings held had a general practitioner, geriatrician and care home team leader present. A pharmacist was also present for 84.2%, additional MDM members for 15.9%. All but one CGA domain were discussed in 95.8-100% of residents including resuscitation and advance care planning. MDMs were less effective in discussing quality of life (63.2%). Geriatriciandelivered CGA had previously been performed in 69 (72.6%). The MDMs outperformed the liaison review for consistently reviewing all CGA domains. However, the liaison review out-performed the MDM in the number of intervention plans made (4.5 +/-2.4 versus 3.3 +/-1.7 intervention plans, p = 0.002). Conclusions: MDMs in care homes without nursing are feasible and comprehensive in delivering CGA with a small group of professionals. Geriatrician-liaison CGA appeared less comprehensive but more focused reflecting increased intervention plans. Likely the combination of both MDMs and focused geriatrician-liaison is required.Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for reliable, real time data on the care of older people. We aimed to identify current data availability, challenges, and priorities for future research and innovations in Care Homes. Methods: Scoping fieldwork in six Lothian (Scotland) Care Homes included (a) 'audit' of all data items currently collected through paper or electronic care planning and (b) interviews with care home managers to discuss (i) availability /use of data; (ii) gaps; (iii) digital capabilities; and (iv) priorities for future research.Results: All homes collected data routinely on dependency, nutrition, weight, falls, pressure sores and infections, and as required on wounds, frailty, bowels or fluid intake. Other data items are also recorded (e.g. pain, sleep, observations) that can identify changes in residents' condition in real time. There was significant variation between homes in recording processes and assessment tools. Data are often used as 'standalone' pieces of information rather than creating a holistic/longitudinal view of each resident. Priorities for future research included standardising documentation, recording non-care tasks, identifying change in residents' condition, and supporting staff. Key conclusions: Care homes can be data heavy, but there is significant heterogeneity in the data, and it is mostly used to direct immediate resident care. There is an opportunity for a National Care Home Data Platform, with strong foundations. This is essential to: provide a robust data source for policy and planning; enable real time digital connectivity between care homes and health & social care providers; and inform future innovative technologies.Nutritional status and loneliness among nursing home residentsPauMoreno-Martin 1 , Patricia Lizett Vilca-Salazar 1 , Meritxell Bonet-Costa 1 , Pau Farr\u00e9s-Godayol 1 , M\u00edriam Molas-Tuneu 1 , Albert Oliveras-Fabregas 1 , Cristina Vaqu\u00e9-Crusellas 1 , Javier Jerez-Roig 1 Research group on Methodology, Methods, Models and Outcomes of Health and Social Sciences (M3O).

Introduction: Malnutrition is common in aging, usually associated with multiple factors, including psychological factors like depression. However, there is scarce evidence of its association with loneliness. This study aims to verify the prevalence of loneliness in nursing homes (NH) residents and the risk of malnutrition and their possible correlation. Methods: Cross-sectional study in 4 NH in the Osona county of Catalonia (Spain). The Mini Nutritional Assessment long form (MNA-LF) was used to evaluate the nutritional risk and the De Jon Gierveld test (DJG) to measure loneliness. Exclusion criteria was; \\ 65 years, not living in NH, refuse to participate and hospitalization. The Spearman test was used for bivariate analysis between MNA and DJG, quantitative variables are represented by mean \u00b1 standard deviation with a confidence level of 95%. LF and DJG was found. Conclusions: The prevalence of loneliness was 72.2% and 3.7% and  53.7% had malnutrition and risk of malnutrition respectively. A nonsignificative and negative correlation was found between loneliness and nutrition status.Background: SARS-CoV-2 disproportionately affects nursing home (NH) residents, who account for 24-82% of COVID-19-related deaths. In Ireland, the first NH case of COVID-19 occurred on 16/03/ 2020. A COVID-19 testing program of residents and staff took place from 18/04/2020 to 05/05/2020. Aims: To examine characteristics of NHs across three Community Health Organisations (CHOs) in Ireland, proportion with COVID-19 outbreaks, staff and resident symptom profile and resident mortality rates. Methods: Forty-five NHs across three CHOs were surveyed. Details were collected on number of beds, occupancy, COVID-19 outbreak, date of first laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case (resident/staff), total symptomatic/asymptomatic cases, and outcomes for residents from 29/02/2020 to 22/05/2020. Results: Surveys were returned from 62.2% (28/45) of NHs (2043 residents, 2303 beds). Three-quarters (21/28) had COVID-19 outbreaks (1741 residents, 1972 beds). Median time from first case of COVID-19 in Ireland to first case in included NHs was 27.0 days. COVID-19 incidence in residents was 43.9% (764/1741): laboratoryconfirmed in 40.1% (710/1741), with 27.2% (193/710) asymptomatic, and clinically-suspected in 3.1% (54/1741). Resident case-fatality was 27.6% (211/764) for laboratory-confirmed/clinically-suspected COVID-19. Similar proportions of residents in NHs with ''early'' outbreaks (\\ 28days) vs ''late'' outbreaks developed confirmed/suspected COVID-19. A lower proportion of residents in NHs with ''early'' outbreaks recovered compared to those with ''late'' outbreaks (37.4% vs 61.7%; v 2 = 56.9, p \\ 0.001). 675 NH staff across twentyfour sites developed confirmed/suspected COVID-19; 23.6% (159/ 675) were asymptomatic. There was a significant correlation between the proportion of staff with symptomatic COVID-19 and resident numbers with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 (Spearman's rho = 0.81, p \\ 0.001).Conclusion: This study demonstrates the impact of COVID-19 on NH residents and staff. High infection rates lead to challenges in care provision.Adherence to the Mediterranean diet and frailty in communitydwelling older people Methods: Data are from the GLISTEN study, an observational multicenter study performed in 620 older patients admitted in 12 Italian hospitals in 2014. Data were collected through Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment; moreover, skeletal muscle mass (Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis) muscle strength (Hand Grip Strength) and physical performance (gait speed) were evaluated. Results: Among sarcopenic patients, the prevalence of sarcopenic obesity was 30.8% according to FNIH criteria, while no patients were defined as sarcopenic using EWGSOP2 criteria. According to EWGSOP2 criteria, 23.7% of sarcopenic and 30.8% of non-sar-Uta Ferrari 1 , Ralf Schmidmaier 1 , Theresa Jung 1 , Sebastian Martini 1 , Martin Bildlingmaier 1 , Michael Drey 1Department of Medicine IV; University Hospital, LMU Munich, GermanyContext: The pathogenesis of sarcopenia is still not fully understood. In particular, disturbances of the somatotropic axis in sarcopenic patients have not yet been adequately investigated. Patients with sarcopenia have lower serum levels of insulin like growth factor (IGF-I) than non-sarcopenic patients. For the biological effectiveness of IGF-I, the binding proteins IGFBP-3 (IGF-binding protein 3) and ALS (acid labile subunit), and for the effectiveness of growth hormone (GH) on the liver, GH receptors are necessary. Objective/Aim:Analysis of the association between the GH/IGF-I axis and muscle function to search for pathogenetic deficits in patients with sarcopenia.Methods. Cross-sectional study with assessment of sarcopenia status (EWGSOP2 criteria) determined from hand grip strength measurement and muscle mass (SMI, Skeletal Muscle Index; calculated by ALM/height 2 ) measured by DXA. Measurement of serum levels of IGF-I, IGFBP-3, ALS, GH, GHBP (GH binding protein); assessment of BMI and routine laboratory parameters. For statistical analysis univariate and multiple regression models were performed. Results:130 patients (81 women) over 65 years with an average age of 83.3 \u00b1 7.7 years and BMI of 25.34 \u00b1 5.02 kg/m 2 were included in the analysis. 26.7% (n = 35) of the patients had sarcopenia, 54.2% (n = 71) and 45% (n = 59) had pathologically reduced hand grip strength or SMI. Compared to non-sarcopenic patients (IGF-I 83.07 \u00b1 50.08 ng/ml; IGFBP-3 2028.33 \u00b1 1014.39 ng/ml; ALS 321.37 \u00b1 219.38 mU/ml; GHBP 921.30 \u00b1 451.11 ml/min) patients with sarcopenia showed significantly (p \\ 0.008) lower IGF-I (59.31 \u00b1 29.13 ng/ml), IGFBP-3 (1531.06 \u00b1 793.92 ng/ml), ALS (210. 40 \u00b1 129.98 mU/ml) and GHBP (562.14 \u00b1 313.67 pM) serum levels. ALS and IGF-I were constant statistically significant associated with sarcopenia status and pathological hand grip strength even after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and albumin, but not for pathological SMI. Summary/Conclusions: It was shown that not only IGF-I, but also IGFBP-3 and ALS are significantly decreased in patients with sarcopenia. These associations were not explained by age or BMI. The describe the prevalence and factors associated with poor performance in the 5-CST, and to examine the relationship between 5-CST and gait speed. Method: We used data from the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study II. Participants completed a comprehensive questionnaire, 5-CST and gait speed. We used multinomial logistic regression to assess associations between factors including the SARC-F questionnaire and 5-CST performance: fast (\\ 12s), intermediate (12-15 s), slow([ 15s)  or unable, with the latter two classed as poor performance.ResultsA total of 7171 participants aged 65-95 were included (54.1% female). The proportion with poor performance in the 5-CST increased with age, from 34.3% at age 65-69 to 89.3% at age 90-95.",

Varman 1 Background: H2H aims to ensure continuity of care in patients discharged from hospital into the community. H2H also requires elaborate care planning, knowledge of services, robust communication and handover processes. Geriatric Medicine (GRM) being main H2H user, QIA was performed with primary aim to reduce re-admissions and with secondary aims to improve flow, enrollment along with user satisfaction. Method: Current and future value states identified; Wastes in the workflow mapped upon Lean methodology, led to series of interventions over 6 months, focusing on workflow, education, referral and handover processes, including stakeholder's feedback. Data collected prospectively and descriptive analysis performed. Results: Total referrals 6 months before and after interventions: 320 vs 396; acceptance rate: 95.9 vs 97.7%; enrollment: 61.6 vs 75.3%; timely enrollment: 63.5 vs 59.4%; 30-day readmission 24.4% vs 17.1%. Improvements in knowledge and user satisfaction amongst teams noted. Improved satisfaction rates with adequacy of verbal handovers were registered by H2H team. Conclusion: Better awareness, knowledge and communication seem to have improved referrals, acceptance and enrollment rates. Though we expected an increased volume resulting in higher re-admissions, our interventions have actually resulted in reduction in re-admissions along with improved satisfaction in bothGRM and H2H teams.   Moving forward, we like to explore other factors in this complex cohort such as routine incorporation of advance care planning discussions; root cause analysis on re-admissions and usage of objective tools such as Care Transition Measure (CTM-3), to enhance H2H flow across wider hospital spectrum in alignment with improving care of older people. Surendra D. Varman 1 , Samuel E. E. Cheng 1 , Rachael T. Tambokon 1Changi General HospitalAim: Older people are the major users of health and social care systems. The 30-day all-cause readmission rate in Geriatric medicine (GRM) is 20%, a concern due to escalating costs in healthcare. This QIA with root-cause analysis (RCA) aims to identify the main causes of re-admissions; trends and propose possible solutions. Methods: Patients readmitted to GRM wards within 30 days of index admission were identified. RCA and descriptive analysis was performed by a team of Geriatrician and Medical officers.",

He was non-smoker. Examination was unremarkable apart from ankle oedema up to the thighs. FBC, LFTs and Ca were normal and eGFR 41. Serum protein electrophoresis showed no paraproteins and urine protein electrophoresis revealed no monoclonal free light chains. ECG showed AF, LBBB and poor R wave progression. Echocardiography revealed restrictive cardiomyopathy with mirror image hypertrophy of both ventricles suggestive of Amyloid infiltration. There was moderate bi-atrial dilatation. He underwent Coronary angiogram and myocardial biopsy. Histopathology showed features consistent with cardiac amyloidosis. Discussion: Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) has to be considered if the patient has other manifestations suggestive of amyloidosis or heart failure with preserved left ventricular function or heart failure without cardiomegaly or if he has left ventricular hypertrophy without identifiable cause. ECG can be normal or show voltage criteria of LVH or low-voltage complexes and pseudo-infarction patterns. Echocardiography may reveal thick walled ventricles and apical sparing is typical in CA. Thickening of both the LV and RV is an important echocardiographic clue that can differentiate CA from other diseases. Cardiac MRI is a more accurate imaging tool; late gadolinium enhancement is characteristic. CA is almost always ATTR or AL type.

In last years new drags were emerged to treat HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), like Sacubitril/Valsartan (Sa/Va) and Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). Although recent evidence underscores safety of these therapies, also in the elderly, few is known about safety of their combination in real world. With this clinical case we want to offer a hint for thought on this. The kidney function in older adults aged [90 years was decreased and didn't depend on the CVD. For the lowest values of eGFR CKD-EPI CystatinC equation overestimate means versus using other equations. For estimation of the degree of decrease of kidney function more research is needed bearing in mind the significant difference in estimated values.Introduction: Severity stratification of older adults affected by heart failure (HF) is difficult. Mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet distribution width (PDW), as platelet activation and thus inflammation markers, might be used for this purpose. The objective of the study was to analyse the association between MPV/PDW and HF severity indicators in older adults. MPV and PDW are unexpensive potential markers for severity stratification of older adults with HFmrEF/HFrEF, but not with HFpEF. Further studies are needed to confirm these results.

Data published by the WHO shows that there are 50 million people worldwide with dementia. Alzheimer's Type Dementia (ATD) is the most common form common dementia, representing 60-70% of all dementias. Interventions with caregivers and training in symptom management, both cognitive and behavioral, have shown more efficient than pharmacological treatment. Families assume 85% of the cost of their care. Objective: To analyze the prevalence of dementia and the profile of caregivers in the Home Geriatric Care Program (AGD) of the Insular Hospital of Lanzarote. Method: Descriptive cross-sectional observational study. Patients treated at AGD in 2018. Results: The sample consists of 214 patients, with a mean age of 84.73 years (Sx 7.37). Regarding sex, the sample corresponds to 73.4% (157) women and 26.6% (57) men. Barthel index score was 41.5 (Sx 30.12), GDS of 3.58 (Sx 1.85) and a Frailty index of 0.47 (Sx 0,12). Polypharmacy ([ 5 drugs) was 75.7%. The reason for consultation was mainly due to immobility (32.7%) and conduct disorder (26.2%). The caregiver profile was the couple (10.3%); siblings (47.6%), paid caregiver (35.5%). 90.2% of sample were living with their family. Conclusions: We are visiting people with advanced age and high level of dependence. Families assume most of the cost of care. The main reasons for home care are dementia, immobility and conduct disorders. The profile of the caregiver are family members.

The objective of the study was to determine if AI is a good risk predictor in diabetes mellitus patients.Material  and method: Present work included 199 older patients (over 65 years): 91 diabetes mellitus and 108 healthy control patients. Findings: Study revealed an increase of triglycerides (p \\ 0.001), increase of AI (2.99 \u00b1 1.5 vs. 3.58 \u00b1 1.77; p \\ 0.01) and a decrease of HDL-cholesterol (p \\ 0.0001) at diabetes mellitus patients vs. control. Diagnostic test evaluation indicated that AI test has 90.1% sensitivity, 31.48% specificity, and relative risk estimate = 2.51. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that, compared to low risk, patients with high AI had 4.18-fold risk for developing diabetes mellitus [OR 4.18, 95% CI 1.88-9.30; p = 0.0004]. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the higher is AI, the higher are the chances to develop diabetes mellitus, and therefore, prevention strategies and treatment guidelines should include AI as good risk predictor.

Objective of this study was to determine reliability, measurement error, content and structural validity of the observational (physical and cognitive) scales of the USER in geriatric rehabilitation (GR). Methods: The study consisted of three independent studies. Study 1 aimed to determine the content validity of the USER by means of a consensus-meeting with GR-professionals focussing on relevance, comprehensiveness and comprehensibility. Study 2 was a cross-sectional study where a pair of GR-nurses individually scored USERs for all patients on the GR-ward. This study determined inter-rater reliability (IRR), standardized-error-of-measurement (SEM) and smallestdetectable-change (SDC). Finally, study 3, with routine care data, was set up to evaluate the structural validity with a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and internal consistency by Cronbach's Alpha. Results: The content validity was sufficient for both scales. SEM was 5 points for both scales, with an SDC of 14 for the physical and 13 for the cognitive scale. CFA showed acceptable structural fit for both scales with a second order unidimensional model. The internal consistency was good (Cronbach's alpha;0.94). Conclusions: The USER is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring physical and cognitive functioning in geriatric rehabilitation.

The study aimed to determine the types of drug-related problems (DRPs) in older patients, to evaluate the implementation rate of pharmacist recommendations, the factors affecting implementation, and to assess the clinical significance of recommendations.Methods: A prospective interventional study was conducted over a 12-week period for all patients C 65 years admitted to an intermediate care unit. Data was collected on one pharmacist's recommendations to reduce clinically relevant DRPs. The clinical significance of recommendations was judged by four independent assessors using a validated tool. Statistical significance was predetermined as p\\0.05. Results: Of 494 clinically relevant DRPs identified in 91 patients, 406 recommendations were communicated to the medical team, and 89.2% were implemented. Overall, 48.5% were communicated verbally, but no difference was found between the implementation rates ofverbal and written recommendations (87.8% versus 90.4%; p =  0.4). Recommendations judged to be of 'moderate significance' (66.8% of total) were implemented more often than those of 'minor significance' (93.2% versus 81.6%; p \\ 0.001). The consultant was provided with a significantly higher proportion of recommendations of 'moderate significance' when compared to the junior doctor (79.6% versus 63.3%; p = 0.02), but implemented significantly fewer recommendations (69.4% versus 91.9%; p \\ 0.0001). Conclusion: The high implementation rate shows the importance of pharmacist involvement to reduce DRPs in older adults in this setting. Future research should focus on the impact of pharmacist interventions on older patient outcomes and the associated cost effectiveness in this setting.

However, there is limited information regarding socio-demographic and clinical associated factors with utilisation of healthcare services among Malaysian older persons. The objective of this study was to determine the socio-demographic and clinical associated factors of healthcare services utilisation in older persons with knee OA. Data were obtained retrospectively from the Malaysian Elders Longitudinal Research (MELoR) study. Cases were selected based on pre-determined criteria. Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics were examined as associated factors for healthcare utilisation. The results showed that healthcare utilisation among older adults with knee OA was significantly higher compared to those without knee OA (p \\ 0.01) with outpatient care services significantly used by this population (p \\ 0.01). Being married, female gender and having an income were associated with outpatient care (OR 11.136, 95% CI 1.73-52.82, p \\ 0.01), inpatient care (OR: 0.126, 95% CI 0.021-0.746, p \\ 0.05) and medication(OR 10.439,, p \\ 0.05) respectively. Older persons who are married, women and having an income were more likely to utilise healthcare services and medication to manage knee OA. There may be a need to provide self-management education for knee OA to this group of older persons.Investigation of the effect of pelvic floor muscle training on incontinence and constipation in elderly: randomized controlled trial Sebahat Yaprak Cetin 1 , Alime Buyuk 1",

Abstract introduction: General transmission of Covid-19 in Sweden was declared on 6 March 2020. Studies show that the elderly, particularly those with pre-existing comorbidities, are at risk of developing severe illness. Residents at care-homes have an increased degree of frailty making them especially vulnerable to the outcomes of a Covid outbreak. Methods: Tullhuset is an intermediary rehabilitation short-term carehome caring for 64 residents and is staffed cooperatively by \u00d6 rebro Municipality and from the Regional \u00d6 rebro County health authority. Most patients are admitted from the University Hospital. Responding to the general outbreak, a ward was assigned on 26 March for potentially frail (identified through Clinical Frailty Scale instrument) elderly individuals who needed additional care provision. An outbreak occurred at the facility and an investigation was initiated by monitoring patients and furthermore with a questionnaire to staff with confirmed infection. Results: During April 2020, a total of 17 patients (7 women; median age 83) and 38 staff members (34 women; median age 49) were diagnosed with Covid-19. All individuals, apart from two, were thought to have been infected at the care facility. Patients' symptomatology was discrete and differed significantly from the staff (pvalue = 0.04). 3 patients died, thus giving a case fatality of 17 % (3 of 17). Intensive educative initiatives lead to a complete reduction of infectivity. Key conclusions: Structured daily monitoring of frail patients is vital in detecting symptoms related to Covid-19. Simultaneous and continuous education of staff concerning infectivity is important for the optimal care of vulnerable patients and to minimise re-introduction of infection. Keywords: Covid-19, frailty, infection, care-homeAbstract # 331The effects of single and dual task training on balance and functional mobility in the elderly: a randomized controlled study Emel Ta\u015fvuran Horata 1 , Sebahat Yaprak \u00c7 etin 2 , Suat Erel 3 Afyonkarahisar Health Science University, 2 Akdeniz University,Pamukkale UniversityAim: Dual task training improves the balance skills and mobility performance of the elderly. For the beneficial effects of dual task training, it should include a certain level of exercise load and task specificity. According to this informations, the aim of current study was to evaluate the effects of single and dual task training on balance and functional mobility in healthy elderly individuals. Methods: The randomized controlled trial included 32 healthy elderly individuals, aged 60-75 years. Subjects were randomly separated into two groups as the single (n = 16, 64.56 \u00b1 3.34 years) and dual task training group (n = 16, 65.62 \u00b1 2.57) according to Timed Up and Go Test. The Tinetti Balance and Gait Assessment, Functional Reach Test and Single Limb Balance Test and The Timed Up and Go Test was used for assessment. All evaluations were performed at baseline and at the end of the 6th week. Results: Both groups showed an improvement in balance and functional mobility values (p \\ 0.05) after the trainings, with the exception of gait score of the single task training group (p [ 0.05).",

The diagnosis of this syndrome and related biomarkers can help clinicians to identify most vulnerable patients and to add therapeutic strategies to limit these adverse effects. Methods: A total of 46 men (51-92 years old) with PCa and receiving ADT were classified as frail, prefrail or robust according to the Fried scale. A geriatric assessment was performed, based on the Minimental State Examination for cognitive function, the Barthel index for basic activities of daily living, the Yesavage scale for geriatric depression, and the Athens insomnia scale. In addition, blood samples were collected to assess peripheral inflammation biomarkers including proinflammatory cytokines, fibrinogen, CRP and leukocyte differential count, as well as other biochemical and hematological parameters. Results: A significant negative correlation between the severity of frailty syndrome and lymphocyte count was observed (P \\0.01). The concentration of IL-6 (P\\0.05), CRP (P\\0.05), and fibrinogen (P\\ 0.01) were significantly associated with frailty syndrome, but not of TNF-a, IL-beta, or IL-8. The severity of frailty syndrome was not dependent upon the clinical disease stage at diagnosis, the time elapsed since CaP diagnosis, the presence of metastases, or prostatectomy Conclusions: Further research into the role of peripheral inflammation and the associated adverse outcomes in PCa patients under ADT is warranted in order to tailor interventions aimed at reducing symptoms of frailty syndrome, such as loss of muscle strength and low physical activity.Traumatology Department, Hospital of Medina de Campo (Valladolid), Spain, 2 Valladolid Este Primary Assistance Gerency, Valladolid, Spain, 3 Pilarica Health Center, Valladolid Este Primary Assistance, Valladolid, Spain, 4 Parquesol Senior Center, JCyL Social Services Gerency, Valladolid, Spain",

Small bowel neuroendocrine tumors (SBNETs) have been increasing in frequency over the past decades and constitute now the most common type of intestinal tumors. Methods: We present two geriatric male patients with acute abdomen due to SBNETs, who were successfully treated surgically. Case presentation: The first was a 68-year-old man who was admitted at the Emergency Department (ED) due to abdominal pain, nausea and anorexia. He had a positive Mc Burney sign. The computerized tomography (CT) scan showed acute appendicitis and he underwent an appendectomy. The histology report (HR) described a NET at the periphery of the appendiceal mesentery. He underwent a new operation (right colectomy) and the new HR described an SBNET of low grade, located at the ileocecal region, infiltrating the intestinal wall, the surrounding fatty tissue and 4 out of 13 lymph nodes (ln) of the surgical specimen. The postoperative course was uneventful. The second was an 81-year-old man admitted at the ED due to abdominal pain and vomiting. His past medical history included arterial hypertension and atrial fibrillation. He underwent a CT scan which revealed a mesentery mass with intestinal ischemia and had an intestinal resection with ln removal around the mass. The HR described an SBNET with infiltration of 2 ln. Conclusions: SBNETs usually have slow development which makes difficult early diagnosis. They may appear through a carcinoid syndrome, ileus or abdominal pain, frequently associated with distant metastases.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the elderly: a forbidden Drug ??UCSP Sete Rios, ACES Lisboa Norte;Consulta Multidisciplinar de Geriatria Hospital Curry Cabral, Centro Hospitalar Universit\u00e1rio Lisboa Central, 2 Consulta Multidisciplinar de Geriatria Hospital Curry Cabral, Centro Hospitalar Universit\u00e1rio Lisboa Central Introduction: In geriatric care, multimorbidity and the associated polypharmacy are a challenge and subsequent iatrogeny and the prescription cascade a reality. The risk increases when new medication is introduced, due to acute disease such as pain. Pain is a common complaint in the elderly (25-50% of community-dwelling elderly) whose prevalence increases with frailty and chronic diseases, arthritis, bone and joint disorders and cancer and still difficult to treat. Options include opioid and non-opioid analgesics, NSAIDs should be avoided. Case report: A 70 years old, autonomous, married and retired engineer, presented with an overwhelming mechanical right knee pain, that made walking impossible. He had a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, ischemic heart disease, benign prostate hypertrophy and previous herniorrhaphy, spine-cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis and surgery to eye cataract, medicated with alprazolam, simvastatin, dutasteride, tamsulosin, trazodone, acetylsalicylic acid, verapamil. Physiotherapy, glucosamine and piketoprofen cream were prescribed, and he started to autonomously take naproxen. The X-ray and magnetic resonance showed right internal meniscus fracture of the posterior horn, gonarthrosis and tendinitis. After 3 month he complained of heartburn and epigastralgia, iatrogeny was assumed and motivated the use of pantoprazole. Due to persistence of complaints, an upper digestive endoscopy was made, showing upper gastrointestinal pulsatile bleeding from a giant gastric ulcer with irregular borders in the transition body-antrum. The haemostatic therapy attempt was impossible due to hemodynamic instability and cardiac disease. The patient underwent urgent subtotal gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy. Anatomopathological examination showed poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma with mixed pattern and the thoraco-abdominal-pelvic CT scan had no signs of metastasis (pT3N0). The patient did adjuvant chemo and radiotherapy. At 1year follow up gastric cancer and the knee pain are controlled. Conclusions: Nowadays there is no role for the use of NSAIDs in geriatric patients' treatment according to BEERs and START and STOP criteria, but over the counter use is still very frequent. In this lucky case report, the upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to silent gastric cancer (still the fifth most common cancer but declining) was enhanced by the side effects of the overlap of acetylsalicylic acid and other NSAIDs. Glucosamine was not an innocent bystander but might contribute to epigastralgia.Group-based reminiscence interventions in older adults' with dementia assisted by technological innovations: a scoping reviewIsabel Gil 1 , Paulo Santos-Costa 1 , Elzbieta Bobrowicz-Campos 2 , Eduardo Santos 3 , Rosa Carla Silva 4 , Maria de Lurdes Almeida 1 , Jo\u00e3o Ap\u00f3stolo 1 Health Sciences Research Unit: Nursing (UICISA: E), Nursing School of Coimbra (ESEnfC), 2 Faculty of Psychology and Education Sciences of the University of Coimbra, 3 3 Rheumatology Department, Centro Hospitalar e Universit\u00e1rio de Coimbra (CHUC), Universidade Cat\u00f3lica Portuguesa, School of NursingIntroduction: Among the non-pharmacological interventions frequently implemented in older adults with dementia, group-based Reminiscence therapy (RT) emerges in the literature due to its efficacy in enhancing older adults' cognition and quality of life, while decreasing the incidence of depressive symptomatology. In parallel, there is a growing interest on the part of international researchers and healthcare professionals in the inclusion of technological and digital resources during the implementation of non-pharmacological interventions. Therefore, this study aimed to map the available evidence on group-based RT sessions/activities aided by technological innovations, and critically discussed the potentialities and weaknesses of its use. Methods: Following the recommendations of the Joanna Briggs Institute for scoping reviews, the review question and inclusion/exclusion criteria were defined according to the Participants, Concept, and Context (PCC) mnemonic. A three-phased search strategy was conducted in order to develop a comprehensive list of keywords and indexation terms. Two independent reviewers analyzed the relevance of the studies, extracted and synthesized data. Results: Of the 318 potentially relevant studies found, seven were included in this review. Overall, while the use of technological innovations seems to support the interaction and communication between the older adults and their relatives/healthcare personnel, recurrent issues related to ergonomics, connectivity, and intention of use were highlighted. Conclusion: Although technological innovations seem to potentiate group-based RT, there is still a wide gap in the literature regarding the involvement of older adults' with dementia in the development of such resources.Background: Audits on our Falls SOC over the past few years have mandated us in implementing few interventions to improve attendance. TCS was implemented using available resources in Geriatric medicine (GRM) in 2016. From 2016 until 2018, calls were made at two weeks prior to appointment by two executives and empty slots identified for rapid access flow. However in 2019 due to attrition and stretched out resources, existing service was modified with TCS at week prior for 3 months (April-June), followed by no TCS, July-September. Aim: To evaluate TCS, to assess its overall effectiveness in improving attendance; impact of service modification and justification for continuity of service and need for additional funding, the data of 2019 was analyzed. Methods: A retrospective descriptive analysis was performed on the data of first nine months in 2019, from January till September. Results: Available slots in 2019: 32 per month. Attendance: TCS at two weeks prior, from Jan tO March 2019 ,45%; at one week prior, April-June 2019, 45%; no prior TCS, July-Sep 2019 , 30%. Conclusion: TCS seems to have made improvement in attendances, similar to previous trends; and clear impact compared with no TCS. The timing at one week or two weeks prior, however seemed to have made no impact in attendances .Hence, moving forward, we recommend continuation of TCS, at two weeks prior, giving ample time for the unconfirmed slots for Rapid access flow. However for future continuation of TCS, depends upon designated funding from GRM.Developing a bedside robot with monitoring and communicative functions for older people in residential care homesFaculty of Healthcare Management, Nihon Fukushi University, School of Social Policy, Social Work and Social Justice, University College Dublin, 3 Universal Accessibility Ageing Research Centre,",

Methods: A retrospective study was performed on 208 patients with acute or chronic renal failure who were admitted to the Nephrology Department of Venizeleio Hospital of Heraklion from February 2013 to December 2018. The data were collected from the database of the Nephrology Department's electronic file and the file of the Microbiology Laboratory of Venizeleio Hospital of Heraklion. We assessed dialysis DCRBI risk factors including demographics, comorbidities, and duration and frequency of hemodialysis and we investigated the microbiologic etiology of these infections. For the analysis, the statistical pack IBM SPSS STATISTICS 24.0 was used, while p \\0.05 was considered a level of statistical significance. Results: Age groups 70-79 and 80? had the highest frequency in our sample with 38,0% (n=79) and 31,7% (n=66), respectively. Women had a higher incidence of microbiaemia (62,3%), whereas S. epidermidis was the most common pathogen in all cases, with 37.9%. It is worth noting that the results revealed a high incidence of co-morbidity with 92.8% hypertension, 53.8% diabetes mellitus, and 53.8% coronary artery disease. Duration of catheterization of over 10 days was OR 3.16(2.02-4.94). The OR was higher in the case of catheter placement [OR: 2.92 (2.12-4.03)] compared to fistula and graft [OR: 0.14 (0.09-0.22)]. The most common pathogens were Gram ? germs ,associated with almost 75% of the cases.Key conclusions: Vascular access to hemodialysis patients is a primary parameter in the treatment of the disease. Nurses' continuing education and further training in combination with patients' involvement through holistic care and information can lead to the prevention of vascular access complications by aiming in reducing duration of CVC and compliance to hygiene measures.

Material and methods: The study included 1158 patients -men 41.45% and women 58.54%, aged between 65 and 96, mean 71.74 \u00b1 ES 0.17, admitted to the Geriatrics and Internal Medicine departments, from 2015-2017. The obtained data were analyzed in the StatSoft database Statistics 7. Results: Evaluation of the weight of chronic cardiac pathology in elderly patients revealed-high blood pressure-88.63% cases, angina pectoris-45.44%, rhythm disorders-33.49 % cases. Chronic heart failure was diagnosed in 92.6% of cases.The types of rhythm disorders in elderly patients were-atrial fibrillation, extrasystole, sinus tachycardia.The assessment of cardiovascular risk factors in elderly patients showed a high level of dyslipidemia-49.43%, aggravated hereditary anamnesis-16.47%, glucose tolerance disorder-10.22%, alcohol consumption-9.09%, smoking-6.25% cases, overweight, with a mean BMI of 29.96\u00b10.48.Among the diagnosed co-morbidities the most frequent were osteoarticular pathology-98.0% cases, cerebrovascular disease-86.36%, digestive pathology-79.49%, urogenital pathology-77, 82% and Diabetes-24.42% cases.The impact of heart disease and co-morbidities on the quality of life of elderly patients was negative, the most affected item of quality of life was energy, with the mean value of 59.59\u00b13.02, followed by of pain-53.67\u00b12.30, physical ability-48.29\u00b12.018, sleep quality-47.7\u00b12.60, emotional reaction-35.20 \u00b1 2.16 and social isolation-27.78\u00b12 21.Conclusion: The quality of life of the elderly patients was affected in both groups, it was stablished that geriatric syndromes and chronic cardiac pathology had a negative impact on the quality of life, affecting more often the emotional reaction, affecting all life fields.Geriatric syndromes in consultation of neurologyMarta Mercedes Gonz\u00e1lez Eizaguirre 1 , Maria Jesus Vicente Romero 1 , Ana Mateo Abad 1 , Elisa Garc\u00eda Sancho 1 , Carmen Oquendo Marmaneu 1 , Mercedes Forcano Garc\u00eda 1 Hospital San Jos\u00e9 de TeruelIntroduction: Today, one in six people has a neurological disorder, equivalent to approximately 15% of the population. In this group of diseases are Alzheimer's, migraine, stroke (stroke), Parkinson's, epileptic seizures or multiple sclerosis. Very prevalent pathologies in the elderly patient, some of them being geriatric syndromes. Sometimes these pathologies are treated by neurologists and not by geriatricians.Method: A retrospective descriptive study of all patients over 69 years of age is carried out at the Neurology office from November 1, 2019 to January 31, 2020. Subsequently, the patients are classified by the pathology by which they are derived from primary care. Result: 126 patients come to the consultation. The main reason for consultation is for the study of cognitive impairment with 20 consultations, then 14 consultations for clopidogrel renewal, 14 for the onset of tremor, 13 repercussion after cerebral infarction, 9 for performing a dementia medication visa, 8 for headache, 7 for Parkinson's control, 7 for neuropathy and paraesthesia, 5 for control of epilepsy, 4 for control of trigeminal neuralgia, 3 for mitochondrial myopathy, 3 for agitation, 2 for brain neoplasia 1 for renewal of anticoagulation visa, and 9 that are a miscellaneous. Conclusions: Geriatric syndrome is the term used for the symptom or set of complex symptoms with high prevalence in older adults resulting from multiple diseases and risk factors. These syndromes are not only assessed by the geriatrician, sometimes it is the neurologist who receives the patients and treats these pathologies.Ankylosing spondylitis and anterior uveitisIker Sierra-Mart\u00ednez 1 , Leticia Sierra-Mart\u00ednez 2 , Rosario Mart\u00ednez-Fuerte 3 , Natalia Sanz-Gonz\u00e1lez 4 Traumatology Department, Hospital of Medina de Campo (Valladolid), Spain, 2 Valladolid Este Primary Assistance Gerency, Valladolid, Spain, 3 Pilarica Health Center, Valladolid Este Primary Assistance, Valladolid, Spain, 4 Parquesol Senior Center, JCyL Social Services Gerency, Valladolid, SpainAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease with joint and extra-articular manifestations, such as anterior uveitis, aortic incompetence, cardiac conduction defects, pulmonary fibrosis, neurological involvement, and renal amyloidosis. Description of the case: 67-year-old male patient with a history of hypovitaminosis D. He has a daughter and sisters diagnosed with axial and peripheral spondylitis. In 1985 he started with inflammatory low back pain and ankle arthritis. All three sections of the vertebral column ended up being affected and bilateral coxarthrosis also appeared. Several tests were performed, detection of HLA-B27?, with a diagnosis of spondylitis. Later bilateral uveitis appeared. It had an outbreak in 2013 resistant to salazopyrine and NSAIDs and methotrexate 20 mg/day was started. The pains persisted, with high CRP maintained despite uveitis control, so biological treatment was proposed and Cemidon was started, but was poorly tolerated due to the appearance of severe asthenia. A year ago it was the last review with Ophthalmology, in the area of Ocular Immunology, where the dose of methotrexate was reduced due to being well controlled. Recommendations: Ocular manifestations are frequent in ankylosing spondylitis. These can occur before the articular manifestations of AS. Family history and laboratory and physical examination studies are essential to avoid a delay in diagnosis and treatment. With early treatment, most uveitis responds favorably; however, without treatment or with a late approach, serious complications can occur that can lead to amaurosis.Introduction:The aim of the study is to illustrate the role of Ultrasonography (US) in the management of the elderly patients with Metabolic Syndrome (MS) and with suspected gallbladder's diseases. Material and methods: 500 elderly patients ( 65-95 years old, 300 women and 200 men) with Metabolic Syndrome were selected. Four groups of patients were identified: 1. 100 with diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia; 2. 200 with diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension; 3. 300 with diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity; 4. 100 with diabetes ,hypertension and obesity. Ultrasonography was performed in all elderly patients , with and without symptoms of suspected gallbladder's diseases. Results: Ultrasonography detected in 300 patients ( 210 women , 90 men ) the following diseases of gallbladder: 150 gallbladders with stones, 50 gallbladders with sludge, 5 gallbladder neoplasms, 20 gallbladders with cholesterolosis, 50 gallbladders with increased volume, 25 cholecystitis. In the group of patients with diabetes and dyslipidemia only in the 20 % of patients US detected gallbladder diseases; in the group with diabetes,dyslipidemia and hypertension the US revealed gallbladder's diseases in 25 % of patients; in the group with diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity the US diagnosed gallbladder's diseases in 60 % of patients; in the group with diabetes, hypertension, obesity the US detected gallbladder's diseases in 50 % of patients.",

Miller 2 MedEx Health Network, Inc, 2 University of Florida Introduction: Chronic heart failure (CHF) results in physical disability and decline in functional state resulting in loss of independence leading to home bound state. Physician home visits are increasing and generally patients are older and sicker. MedEx Health Network was originally established in 2011 to serve homebound CHF patients with the visiting cardiologist also serving as the primary care physician. This study aimed to explore characteristics of homebound elderly ([65) with CHF from the first cardiology home visit program. Methods: We analysed 3 year data from MedEx Cardiology Home program (MedEx) on CHF home visits and compared to American College of Cardiology's National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence (PINNACLE) outpatient Registry\u00d2. Results: From March 2016 to March 2020, 423 patients were visited. When compared to the PINNACLE (n=697,542), MedEx patients (n=423) are much older (81.3\u00b19.1yo vs. 69.1\u00b113.5yo), more women (62.9% vs. 43.4%), non smokers (83% vs 43%), higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) (130.3\u00b121.8 mmHg vs. 128.1\u00b118.8 mmHg) and heart rate (HR) (76.1\u00b112.9bpm vs. 73.1\u00b113.6bpm), higher ejection fraction (EF) (60.5\u00b18.7 vs. 48.5\u00b116.0) with more preserved ejection fraction (69.3% vs. 46.5%), stroke (13.2% vs. 9.7%), and diabetics (37.4% vs. 26.1%). MedEx patients have lower body mass index (BMI) (26.1\u00b15.5 vs. 29.9\u00b16.5), fewer hypertension history (74.5% vs. 75.6%) and atrial fibrillation/flutter (30% vs. 34.4%).In addition, 30.5% of MedEx patients have dementia, 21.5% have COPD, 97% have any form of vascular disease including coronary artery, peripheral vascular, carotid, aortic disease in any vascular imaging and 41.8% of MedEx patients expired during the follow up. Conclusions: In comparison with NCDR-PINNACLE registry, MedEx patients are a distinct group of CHF population. More research is needed to demonstrate the unique needs and effectiveness of cardiology home visiting practices among these frail home bound chronic heart failure population. References: 1.

Perrino'' Brindisi Italy, Geriatrics department Hospital ''A. Perrino'' Brindisi ItalyIntroduction: The aim of the study is to verify the clinical and ultrasound correlations in a series of 200 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) complicating liver cirrhosis in patients over the age of 65, hospitalized in the Geriatrics department. Materials and methods: 200 patients observed over the course of 8 years, aged 65 to 95 years, 119 men and 81 women ,were included in the clinical ultrasound evaluation. All patients had liver cirrhosis (129 related HCV and 46 related HBV, 25 non-viral) for over 10 years. All patients underwent ultrasound (US) every 6 months and were included in the study when only one solid intrahepatic lesion of up to 2 cm in diameter was found. The US diagnosis of HCC has been confirmed with at least one of the following methods (US with contrast medium, CT, MRI, Biopsy). The echogenicity of HCC has been correlated with AFP levels, patient age, cirrhosis etiology and Child Pugh classification. Results: 140 hypoechoic nodules (diameter between 10 and 20 mm), 10 isoechogenic nodules (diameter between 17 and 20mm), 50 hyperechoic nodules (diameter between 10 and 20 mm) were highlighted with US. AFP values were higher than normal in 30% of hypoechoic nodules, in 20% of isoechoic nodules, in 10% of hyperechoic nodules. In patients aged 85 to 95 all nodules were hypoechoic. Hypoechoic nodules were observed in 15 patients with non-viral cirrhosis out of a total of 25 patients (including 10 with alcoholic cirrhosis, 13 with cryptogenic cirrhosis, 2 with hemochromatosis cirrhosis), in 89 patients with HCV-related cirrhosis and in 36 patients with cirrhosis HBV related. Isoechoic nodules have been observed in 10 patients with cryptogenetic cirrhosis; hyperechoic nodules were found in 20 patients with HCV cirrhosis, in 20 patients with HBV cirrhosis and in 10 patients with non-viral cirrhosis. In relation to the classification of Child Pugh, 45 patients were observed in class A, 5 of which with isoechoic HCC, 15 hyperechoic and 25 hypoechoic; 80 patients with 67 hypoechoic and 13 hyperechoic HCC are included in class B and 75 patients with 61 HCC hypoechogens and 14 hyperechogenic HCC are present in class C. Conclusions: The analysis of the data allows to affirm that in the elderly patients with cirrhosis, above all of age[ 85 years, the small HCC is hypoechoic to the US. In most cases, the cirrhosis is HCV related; the dosage of AFP does not allow adequate surveillance of the elderly with cirrhosis but periodic control with US is essential. According to the Child Pugh classification, people in class B and C are prevalent in the case studies, with the prevalence of the hypoechoic aspects of HCC in both classes; the isoechogenic aspects of HCC have been highlighted only in class A. In conclusion, our study confirms that US is the most appropriate method for surveillance of the elderly patient with cirrhosis and for the early diagnosis of the small HCC. The most frequent ultrasound aspects are those of the unique hypoechoic nodule , without correlations with the etiology of cirrhosis and the classification of Child Pugh.Anticholinergic burden scales as predictors of functional impairment in elderly multimorbidity patientsAngelaTristancho-Perez 1 , Maria Dolores Santos-Rubio 2 , Bernardo Santos-Ramos 1 , Angela Villalba-Moreno 3 , Eva Alfaro-Lara 4 , Susana Sanchez-Fidalgo 5 Pharmacy Service.

Seville, SpainIntroduction: There are several scales that assess the anticholinergic risk (AR), but is unknown about their predictive value to functional impairment (FI) in elderly multimorbidity patients (EMP). Objective: to evaluate the ability of the different scales to predict FI in EMP. Methods: Retrospective, observational and multicenter study. EMP with at least 1 drug with anticholinergic burden (AB) in anyone scale. AB and AR were assessed with the Anticholinergic Burden Calculator, which contains ten scales. FI was considered when Barthel index decreased 20 points(3-15 months). Association (chi-square test), positive and negative predictive values (PPV, PNV) and ROC plot were calculated. Results: 473 patients (84 years (IQR=10), 60.3% women) were included and 40% suffered FI. Median of medications with AB was 2 (IQR=2). Among patients with FI the most prevalent pathology was cardiac disease (45.5%) and the most prescribed anticholinergic drug was furosemide (94 prescriptions). Among this cohort, those with high AR according to each scale were: 113 patients in the ABC scale Key conclusions: In EMP, only ABC showed association with FI, being its sensitivity and PPV moderate.Discovery of systemic scleroderma in the context of a pulmonary arterial hypertension assessment in an 83-year-old patient.

It is considered incurable. Its course can be controlled. Approximately 8000 patients are affected by SSc per year in France. They are mostly women between 50 and 60 years old. We present the case of an 83-year-old patient with a diagnosis of SSc. Case: An 83 year old patient with no particular history (cognitive disorders and Hashimoto's thyroiditis) was hospitalized for assessment of altered general state and loss of autonomy for 3 months, exertional dyspnea for several months with blockpnea, Raynaud's syndrome. Trans-thoracic ultrasound revealed a pericardial effusion at 12 mm circumferential diameter with right heart failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PH) at 100 mmHg and dilatation of the right cavities. Antinuclear factor antibodies and centromere antibodies returned positive. Right catheterization revealed pre-capillary PAH associated with limited systemic cutaneous scleroderma. Discussion: PH affects around 10% of patients with SSc and is marked by a high mortality rate of 30%. PH associated with SSc remains a feared and little-known complication with a poorer response to treatment and a poorer prognosis than in idiopathic PH. Conclusion: In a PH assessment in the elderly people, the hypothesis of SS should be systematically evoked.Sinus tachycardia and Parkinson's diseaseDerbal Samar 1 , Cherif Yosra 1 , Ben Dahmen Fatma 1 , Abdallah Meya 1",

CT TAP scan might be helpful in those situations. Objective: To determine the proportion of CT TAP scans performed for an increased CRP of unknown origin that contribute to the diagnosis. Material and methods: We conducted an observational prospective study at Bordeaux University Hospital between January 2019 and June 2020. All consecutive hospitalized patients aged C 75 years that underwent a CT TAP scan for an inflammatory syndrome of unknown origin (CRP [ 5mg/L) were enrolled. Clinical data were collected the day of the CT scan request. Factors associated with a helpful CT scan and the prevalence of incidentalomas were reported. Results: Among the 100 enrolled patients (mean age 86 \u00b1 5,7 years, 48 % female), the CT TAP scan allow the physician to raise the diagnosis up for 56 patients, mainly pulmonary infections (n=24) and gastrointestinal infections (n = 7). No factor associated with helpful exams was identified except a high level of CRP. The most frequent incidentalomas reported were Pleural and pericardial effusion (n = 35), cysts (n = 29) and old bone fractures (n = 27). Conclusion: In this pilot study, CT scan seems to be a useful tool to explore unexplained inflammatory syndrome in older patients hospitalized in acute geriatric units.

            "text": "Cardio-metabolic risk in elderly patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemicPre-existing cardiovascular and metabolic diseases could be a predisposing factor in itself for COVID-19 induced cardiac impairment, as elderly patients with heart injuries frequently have a history of coronary heart disease and hypertension, and metabolic pathologies (diabetes mellitus). Thus, in the report published in JAMA (april 2020), 25% and respectively 58.3% of patients with critical COVID-19 had a history of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Although there is currently little evidence to establish a direct link between acute cardiopulmonary lesions associated with COVID-19 and cardio metabolic comorbidities, it can be assumed that patients with chronic cardio metabolic disorders are susceptible to acute cardiac injury. Once these patients are infected and develop severe SARS-COV-2 pneumonia, myocardial ischemia, cardiac dysfunction, or pulmonary thromboembolism are more likely to eventually lead to acute hemodynamic impairment. Material and results: we further present the case of a 72-year-old woman patient, hospitalized in the Internal Medicine and Geriatrics-Gerontology Clinic Iasi, Romania, between may 21-31, 2020. The patient was transferred from the Infectious Diseases Hospital in the context of SARS-COV-2 (positive test April 2020) for continued treatment and monitoring of SARS-COV-2 infection. Hospitalization diagnosis: SARS-COV-2 infection (lung damage), SARS-COV-2 pneumonia, essential hypertension grade III additional high risk, type 2 diabetes. Among the reasons for hospitalization are dyspnea and moderate neurasthenia. The patient's evolution was stationary until May 30, when the general condition suddenly deteriorated, with loss of consciousness, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, agonizing breathing, and generalized edema. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation maneuvers were instituted, without clinical symptoms, and the patient's death was finally declared. Discussions and conclusions: Chronic cardiopulmonary pathology in an elderly patient with severe form SARS-VOC-2 infection (viral pneumonia) represent an high risk factor in these conditions and can cause sudden hemodynamic and respiratory decompensation with irreversible cardiopulmonary arrest. Thus, severe lung damage, caused by pneumonia, can lead to severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), evolving into septic shock, which cause the death of the patient.

Key conclusions: We revealed that GNRI was correlated with obesity and diminished muscle mass. Contrarily, a new index was inversely related to sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity. The new index could predict good nutritional and muscle status more efficiently.Changes in nutrition intake between 2007 and 2017 among older long-term care residents in Helsinki",

Methods: 111 geriatric in-patients of Kaunas Clinical Hospital Geriatric Department were enrolled. The MNA, MNA-SF, and NRS 2002 questionnaires were used. The diagnosis and stage of malnutrition were determined based on Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) Criteria. Pearson coefficient, t-test, and Mann-Whitney U test were used. Results: 67.6% of patients were women, mean age was 81.3\u00b17.3 years. Using the MNA, malnutrition and the risk of malnutrition were found to be 8.7 and 61.2% respectively. The average score was 21.8\u00b13.9. Using the MNA-SF, malnutrition was found to be 25.5%, and the risk of malnutrition was found to be 46.9%, with an average score of 9.8\u00b12.9. Malnutrition was found in 46.8% of patients using the NRS 2002 scale, with a mean score of 2.5\u00b10.7. Moderate malnutrition based on phenotypic and etiological diagnostic GLIM criteria was found in 20.0%, severe malnutrition-in 11.4% of subjects. The sensitivity of the MNA and MNA-SF questionnaires was 97%, and the specificity was 42 and 46% respectively. The sensitivity of the NRS 2002 questionnaire was 85%, and the specificity was 71%. Conclusions: The prevalence of malnutrition among geriatric patients was determined using different malnutrition screening questionnaires-the results differed significantly. Based on GLIM criteria, malnutrition was found in 29.7% of geriatric in-patients. The MNA and MNA-SF were the most sensitive in diagnosing malnutrition, but NRS 2002 was the most specific.Introduction: There is no data on the prevalence of oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) in Lithuania. The usual diagnostic method is a water drinking sample taken at the patient's bedside. The worldwide questionnaire EAT-10 is still rarely used in Lithuania. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of OD in geriatric in-patients and to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the swallowing disorder screening tool EAT-10. Methods: 353 geriatric in-patients of Kaunas Clinical Hospital Geriatric Department were enrolled. The Lithuanian version of the EAT-10 was used. The EAT-10 score C3 was defined as suspected dysphagia. A clinical water drinking sample was performed in order to justify the diagnosis of OD. Data was analysed with ANOVA, Pearson coefficient, and Student's t-test. Results: 71.1% of patients were women, mean age was 82.0\u00b17.4 years. The mean EAT-10 score was 2.6\u00b14.3. Cronbach's alpha for the EAT-10 questionnaire was 0.888; as patient age increased, the reliability of the questionnaire decreased to 0.882. EAT-10 score C3 was observed in 32.9% of patients. Bedside water drinking test was positive in 10.2% of patients. No statistically significant differences were found in EAT-10 and bedside test among age and sex groups. The EAT-10 tool had a sensitivity value of 94.4 %, and a specificity value of 74.1%. Conclusions: One third of geriatric in-patients were suspected of having dysphagia. However, the prevalence of OD based on the water drinking test was only 10.2%.

An ACB score of 1 or greater was higher in the malnutrition risk group than controls (46.8% vs. 31.6%, p=0.006). Multivariate analysis showed a 1.207 fold increase in the malnutrition risk among adults taking one or more anticholinergics independent of age, gender, and comorbidities (OR: 1.207 95%, CI:1.006-1.448; p=0.043).

Conclusions: Drugs with anticholinergic properties identified by the ACB scale are associated with the risk of malnutrition, which could lead to many adverse outcomes in older adults. Further studies are necessary to address the causality relationship between anticholinergics and impaired nutrition.FundingThis study was supported by the department of the Scientific Research Projects of University of Health Sciences, Turkiye (Project No. 2017/007).

Studies suggest that 20-65% patients suffer from nutritional deficiencies and it's very prevalent in geriatric patients with hip fracture. Nevertheless, its importance is not fully recognized[1][2][3].Methods: This study includes all patients with neck femur fractures admitted in an orthogeriatric unit in one year. The data included were: age, frailty score(FS), KATZ scale, comorbidities, nutritional assessment, length of stay and mortality. Were excluded all patients who didn't have any nutritional assessment.The nutritional assessment was made using the Nutritional Risk Screening 2002(NRS) which identifies patients at risk of malnutrition.[4] Consulta Multidisciplinar de Geriatria, Hospital Curry Cabral, Centro Hospitalar Universit\u00e1rio Lisboa Central, 2 Servi\u00e7o de Medicina Interna 7.2, Hospital Curry Cabral, Centro Hospitalar Universit\u00e1rio Lisboa Central, 3 Unidade de Nutri\u00e7\u00e3o, H Curry Cabral, Centro Hospitalar Universit\u00e1rio Lisboa Central), (4) NOVA Medical School, Universidade Nova de Lisboa",

The prevalence of slow gait speed was 39.5% (n=60). Compared to normal speed group (n=92), these patients had more clinically significant depression (geriatric depression scale score [ 5) (p\\0.001), cardiovascular disease diagnosis (p=0.004), recent falls and anticholinergic burden (p=0.001). Multivariate models yielded associations between age (OR=1.201; CI:1.101-1.311; p\\0.001), female gender (OR=3.891; CI:1.266-11.955; p=0.018), depression (OR=3.744; CI:1.475-9.500; p=0.005), fall history (OR=2.751; CI 1.100-6.880; p=0.030), and cardiovascular disease (OR=3.422; CI 1.265-9.256; p=0.015) and slow gait speed. Conclusion: Depression is significantly and independently associated with slow gait speed in older people with mild cognitive impairment. Hence, slow gait speed in these patients may not always indicate worsening cognitive status. Future studies are required to test whether the treatment of depression can improve functional performance in mild cognitive impairment.Funding:This study was supported by the department of the Scientific Research Projects of Universityof Health Sciences, Turkiye (Project No. 2017/007).

Associations between depression dementia and insomnia has been poorly studied in nonagenarians. The aim of our study was to investigate the prevalence of depression and its associations with dementia and insomnia in patients aged C90 years. Methods: One hundred and eighty-eight outpatients (23% male) aged 90-101 (mean 93\u00b12) years were included in the study. We evaluated mood using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), cognitive functions -the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), and insomnia -the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Results: The prevalence of depression (GDS-15 C5) was 69,7%, insomnia (ISI C8) -54,3%, and dementia (MMSE B23) -46,8%. Median of GDS-15 was 7 (IQR 4 to 10). Patients with depression (n=131) had the higher frequency of dementia (53,4% vs 31,6%; p=0,006) and insomnia (60,3% vs 40,4%; p=0,012) than those without (n=57). GDS-15 score was correlated with FAB (r=-0,335; p\\0,001), MMSE (r=-0,299; p\\0,001), and ISI (r=0,339; p\\0,001) score. Logistic regression showed that depression was associated with dementia (OR 2,49; 95%CI 1,79; p=0,006) and insomnia (OR  2,25; 95% CI 1,24; p=0,012). FAB score as a rank variable was associated with depression.(OR 1,86; 95% CI 1,86; p=0,005). Conclusion: We observed a high prevalence (69,7%) of depression in Moscow nonagenarians.

Patients with postoperative delirium had significantly lower MOCA score on admission [21.1(SD5.3) vs 14.9(SD7.8)] compared to those who had no delirium. The average Fried Frailty score for all patients was 1.3 (SD 1.4) with 14.8% categorised as non-frail, 59.3% pre-frail and 26% frail. The relationship between frailty and cognitive impairment with postoperative delirium after adjustment with age was found to have the following order of significance; Category A [OR=12.33 (95% CI: 4.27-35.65), p\\0.01], Category B [OR=5.0 (95% CI:1.9-13.6), p\\0.01], Category C [OR=3.5 (95% CI 1.1-10.7), p=0.03], Category D [OR=1.0 (95% CI 0.3-3.2), p=0.94], Category E[OR=4.2 (95% CI: 1.0-18.4), p=0.05], and Category F as reference group. Conclusion: Frailty syndrome and cognitive impairment are common in older surgical inpatients. Patients with dementia and mild cognitive impairment are associated with the development of postoperative delirium and the significance is stronger when combined with the presence of frailty.

University Hospital Virgen del Roc\u00edo, 2 Pharmacy Service. Hospital of Riotinto, 3 Pharmacy Service. University Hospital Virgen de ValmeIntroduction: Anticholinergic burden, excessive therapeutic burden and preventable adverse drug events usually jeopardies the success of chronic patients' treatment. Three important tools have been developed to counteract these problems: ABC-Calculator, Less-Chron and Trigger-Chron. They have demonstrated clinical benefits in some papers. The objective is to reveal to the scientific community an electronic platform that integrates and makes a much easier clinical use of these three important tools. Results: A free access, friendly, comprehensive, integrated web platform and app (English/Spanish). The main features are:-Easy free registration, access, description and bibliographic evidence of the tools. Continuous updates. Once the treatment and patient are introduced all tools calculus may be automatically done, selecting the tool to apply.-Patients: 1. ABC: calculates anticholinergic burden and estimates the risk of developing anticholinergic side effects summarizing 10 scales in a numerical and colored graphical display. 2. LESS-CHRON: generates deprescribing recommendations starting at patient clinical status and drug profile. A time/clinical parameter pack to evaluate the success with a proposed review date automatically generated (agenda), are also provided. 3. TRIGGER-CHRON: informs about the previous patient risk on drug adverse events-Patient history/Doctor's file: anonymized patient database plus all patients file from each individual user that may be exported. Key conclusions: LESS-PHARMA-CHRON manages to integrate into a single portal three useful tools for the optimization of the pharmacotherapy of chronic patients, thus supporting their applicability in clinical practice.Factors associated with potentially inappropriate medications in patients taking anti-dementia drugs: a secondary analysis of a nationwide survey of prescribing pharmacies Yusuke Suzuki 1 , Mikio Sakakibara 2 , Nariaki Shiraishi 2 , Hitoshi Komiya 1 , Masahiro Akishita 4 , Masafumi Kuzuya 5 Nagoya University Hospital, 2 Sugi Pharmacy,3  Nihon Fukushi University, 4 The University of Tokyo Hospital, 5 Nagoya University",

Methods: Cross-sectional study. Community-dwelling patients are included (both people living in their own homes and nursing homes) if they showed frailty (measured by Frail-VIG Index) C 0.20. Data were collected from June to December 2019. Each patient's pharmacotherapeutic plan was reviewed by an interdisciplinary healthcare team (including primary care physician, nurse, pharmacist and a consultant team with geriatrician and clinical pharmacist) applying a patient centred prescription model. ANOVA test was applied to associate frailty with polypharmacy, anticholinergic burden (measured by DBI), therapeutic complexity (measured by MRCI) and inappropriate prescription (IP). Results: We included 148 patients (mean age 83.3, SD 7.7; 63.9% female; 61.2% nursing home residents). Mean use drug per patient was 8.7 (SD 4.0), mean MRCI was 32.12 (SD 17.15) and median was DBI 1.85 (IQR 0.66 -1.99). 91.2% had at least 1 o more PI. Median Frail-VIG index was 0.40 (IQR 0.32 -0.48). Polypharmacy (p=0.239) and therapeutic complexity (p=0.701) did not show significance relationship with frailty. However, inappropriate prescription (p=0.017) and anticholinergic burden (p=0.008) showed relationship with frailty. Key conclusions: Total number of drugs and therapeutic complexity in the prescription is mainly the same, independently of the frailty degree. This lack of tailoring may well explain the highest inappropriate prescription detected in the frailest patients.Impact of a patient centred prescription model on pharmacogical outcomes in a community-dwelling cohort Abstract # 427 Pharmacologic mediated unilateral fixed mydriasis Julie McCarthy 1 , Atef Michael 1 Mary Stevens Hospice, UK, 2 Russells Hall Hospital, Dudley, UK",

Main outcome: Persons experiencing at least one all cause hospital readmission. Results: After screening 3,257 studies for eligibility, 25 studies were finally included. For the outcome persons experiencing at least one all cause hospital readmission within 30 days, a NMA including 11 studies (7,318 participants) was conducted. Medication review in combination with medication reconciliation and patient education (risk ratio (RR) 0.45; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26-0.80) and medication review in combination with medication reconciliation, patient education, professional education and transitional care (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.49-0.84) were associated with a lower risk of hospital readmissions compared to usual care. There was no statistically significant effect for medication review without co-interventions. For at least one all cause hospital readmission without any time constraints, the NMA included 24 studies (11,677 participants). Medication review in combination with medication reconciliation, patient education, professional education and transitional care resulted in a lower risk of hospital readmissions (RR 0.82;95%CI 0.74-0.91) compared to usual care. Conclusion: Medication review with co-interventions reduced the risk of hospital readmissions compared to usual care.

Mercer's Institute for Research on Ageing, St James's Hospital, Dublin, IrelandIntroduction: Potentially Inappropriate Medication (PIM) use is prevalent in older adults and is associated with adverse events, hospitalisation and mortality. We assessed patterns and associations of PIM use in older adults with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD), who may represent a particularly vulnerable group. Methods: Analysis of data from NILVAD, an 18-month Randomised Control Trial of Nilvadapine in mild-to-moderate AD. 448 older adults with mild-to-moderate AD from 23 centres in 9 European countries were included. The v2 STOPP criteria were applied in duplicate to identify PIM use. Associations between PIM use and adverse events/unscheduled healthcare visits in addition to the associations between PIM use and AD progression were evaluated. Results: Of 448 participants (mean age: 72.56 \u00b1 8.19 years), over half (55.8%) were prescribed a PIM with 30.1% being prescribed 2? PIMs. The most frequent PIMs were (i) long term benzodiazepines (11.6% N = 52/448), (ii) SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) without appropriate indication (11.1% N = 50/448) and (iii) Proton-Pump Inhibitors (PPI) without appropriate indication (10.7% N = 48/448). Increasing number of PIMs was associated with a greater risk of adverse events(IRR 1.17, p\\0.001), serious adverse events (IRR 1.27; 1.17-1.37, p\\0.001), unscheduled hospitalisations (IRR 1.16, 1.03-1.30, p = 0.016) and GP visits(IRR 1.22, p\\0.001). PIM use was not associated with dementia progression. Conclusions: PIM use is highly prevalent in mild-to-moderate AD and is associated with adverse events and unscheduled healthcare utilisation. Further attention to de-prescribing in this vulnerable group is warranted.Cause of syncope in an old adultRaluca Brodocianu 1 , Adina Carmen Ilie 2 , Anca Iuliana Pislaru 2 , Ioana Alexandra Sandu 2 , Ramona Stefaniu 2 , Anna Marie Herghelegiu 3 , Catalina Raluca Nuta 3 , Ovidiu Lucian Bajenaru 3 , Gabriel Ioan Prada 3 , Ioana Dana Alexa 2 CI Parhon Hospital Iasi, 2 University of Medicine and Pharmacy Iasi,",

SpainIntroduction: STOPPFrail is a screening tool to detect potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) use in frail older adults with limited life expectancy. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of chronic use of PIM in patients with end-stage dementia using the STOPPFrail criteria. Methods: Retrospective study of patients with end-stage dementia (Global Deterioration Scale 7) who died during 2017-2019 in an Acute Geriatric Unit (AGU). We collected sociodemographic variables, Charlson comorbidity index, geriatric syndromes, number of admissions and emergency department (ED) visits in the last year of life and previous admissions to the AGU. Chronic use of PIM on admission and along the last year of life were recorded. Results: n=99. Mean age 92.6\u00b14.6, 77% female. 44% lived in nursing homes. Mean Charlson index 3.2\u00b11.5. 76% on polypharmacy (mean 6.8\u00b13.1 drugs). 67% had malnutrition, 44% pressure ulcers, 84% dysphagia and 89% delirium. They had a mean of 2.7 ED visits and 1.7 admissions in the last year of life. 57% met at least one STOPPFrail criteria, mean 0.9\u00b11.0 (0-5). The 36% that had previous admissions to AGU had fewer PIM (40% vs 67% , p= 0.011). The most frequent PIM were: proton pump inhibitors (PPI) (34.3%), antipsychotis (17.2%), calcium supplements (12%), statins (8.1%), memantine (8.1%) and antiplatelet drugs (7.1%). Key conclusions: More than half of the patients with end-stage of dementia admitted to an AGU use PIM at the end of life. Former admission to the AGU was associated with a reduced use of PIM.Sibille Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier 1 , Maljean Laurentine 2 , Dehanne Fabian 3 , Schoevaerdts Didier 1 , Spinewine Anne 1 , de Saint-Hubert Marie 1 CHU UCL Namur/ UCLouvain (Belgium), 2 Universit\u00e9 Grenoble-Alpes (France),3 CHU UCL Namur (Belgium)",

Aim: To assess the adequacy of PPI prescription prior to admission to an Orthogeriatric ward.Methods: We conducted a retrospective crosssectional study in an Orthogeriatric Unit. All patients over 64 years of age with femoral fracture admitted in this ward, between June 2016 and June 2018, were included (n= 399). Demographic and clinical data was collected from clinical records, namely preadmission chronic medication and diagnosis that could justify the use of PPI, according Food and Drug Administration and National Institute for Clinical Excellence recommendations and prescription criteria for older patients (STOPP andSTART and Beers). Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 26\u00d2. Results: A total of 399 patients were included, 255 (63.9%) were women, with an average age of 85.6 \u00b17.73 years, Barthel score 81.4 and ''Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatric'' 9.1. At admission, 179 patients (44.9%) were on PPI, 84 patients (46.9%) of which had no indication for it. Of the patients who had an indication for PPI therapy (n= 95, 53.1%), the majority were in the context of gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis, in high-risk patients (n= 50, 52.6%). Conclusions: Despite well-established recommendations, the misuse of PPI in older patients remains an important problem to address, considering the high risk of potentially fatal consequences associated.The evaluation of a geriatric discharge medication and its link to rehospitalisations and days spent at home: first results of the prospective AGITATE trialMathias Freitag 1 , Tanja B\u00fclow 2 , Olaf Krause 3 , Albrecht Eisert 4 , Cornelius Bollheimer 5 , Thea Laurentius 5 Geriatric Medicine (Med.

Methods: The study included patients [ 65 years admitted to the geriatric outpatient clinic. Muscle mass was assessed with bioimpedance analysis (BIA). Muscle strength was evaluated by hand grip strength with a Jamar hydraulic hand dynamometer. Sarcopenia was diagnosed according to EWGSOP2 criteria. Skeletal muscle mass index (SMMI) was adjusted with two alternative methods: SMMI (height) and SMMI(BMI). Results: 197 participants were included aged between 65 and 99 years (76.2\u00b16,1 years old). 151 patients (76.6%) were female. RR, RX and XX genotype of ACTN3 were present in 31%, 45.2%, and 23.9%, respectively. No significant difference was observed in mean age, height, weight, body mass index, timed-up-and-go-test, chair stand, gait speed across the genotypes. 50.8% had low SMMI (BMI), whereas all participants except one case had normal SMMI (height). Alleles were not different between SMMI normal and low groups (p=0.81). 44.6% of the participants had probable sarcopenia, 29.4% had confirmed sarcopenia, and 19.2% had severe sarcopenia. In univariate analyses, there was no significant difference in ACTN3 polymorphism between older people with probable/confirmed/severe sarcopenia, and control group. In regression analyses, neither low muscle mass nor sarcopenia was associated with ACTN3 R577X genotypes. Conclusion: Our study suggests that there is no significant relationship between muscle mass or sarcopenia parameters and ACTN3 R577X gene polymorphism in community dwelling older adults in Turkey.Cutoff values to identify low muscle mass by computed tomography at l3 vertebra levelGulistan Bahat 1 , Banu Ozulu Turkmen 1 , Samil Aliyev 2 , Nezahat Muge Catikkas 1 , Baris Bakir 2 , Mehmet Akif Karan 1 Istanbul University, Istanbul Medical School, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Geriatrics, Istanbul, Turkey., 2 Istanbul University, Istanbul Medical School, Department of Radiology, Istanbul, Turkey.",

Introduction: We established the MASS_Lifecourse study to investigate changes in skeletal muscle between ages 45-85. Reduced physical activity (PA) is a key factor linked to the development of sarcopenia. Our aim was the describe the amount and patterns of PA and sedentary behaviour (SB), and relationships with muscle strength and quantity, among MASS_Lifecourse participants. Method: Participants wore a triaxial accelerometer on their dominant wrist for seven days. Recordings were analysed to calculate time in moderate-vigorous PA (MVPA) with time not in MVPA classified as SB based on wrist position.

Objectives: To investigate associations between pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination and mortality and hospital admissions in a large population of frail and very old people living in French nursing homes. Design: Observational cohort study. Setting: 254 French nursing homes. Participants: Population-based sample of 35,998 residents admitted after January 1, 2014 and followed until the end of 2018. Follow-up was complete. Exposure: 23-valent or 13-valent pneumococcal vaccination prior or during nursing home stay.Main outcome measures: We extracted from electronic medical records information about pneumococcal vaccination status, dependency level, diseases and drug use, and calculated their Charlson comorbidity score. Times to mortality and first hospitalization were analyzed among vaccinated and unvaccinated residents of the propensity score-matched cohort using Cox proportional hazards regression and the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Among the 35,998 residents of the cohort (mean age 87.0\u00b17.1 years, females 66.2%), 2684 (7.46%) had pneumococcal vaccination. The mortality rate was significantly lower among vaccinated residents compared with unvaccinated residents (hazard ratio, 0.438; 95% CI: 0.410 to 0.468; p\\10-4). The probability of first hospitalization was significantly reduced among vaccinated residents than among unvaccinated residents (hazard ratio, 0.721; 95% CI: 0.685 to 0.758; p\\10-4).Conclusions: Our findings suggest that pneumococcal vaccination is beneficial among nursing home residents.Influenza and pneumococcus immunization status of older adults in typical rural community in Greece amidst the emerging COVID-19 pandemic Maria Tampaki 1 , Alexandra Livada 2 , Maria-Niki Fourka 2 , Elli Lazaridou 2 , Marina Kotsani 3 , Athanasios Benetos 3 , Petros P Sfikakis 4 , Evrydiki Kravvariti 4 Primary medical care unit of Marmari, S.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficiency of GNRI for predicting sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity. We also proposed a new index to predict nutritional and muscle status. Methods: Patients admitted to polyclinic between January 2018 and January 2019 were evaluated retrospectively. Patients who had a creatinine clearance of less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 were excluded. EWGSOP 2 criteria were used to diagnose sarcopenia. Malnutrition was evaluated by GNRI [(1.489 9 serum albumin (g/L)) ? (41.7 9 (current body weight/ideal weight). We designed a new index, ''creatinine x1000/GNRI''. We analyzed the correlation of these indices with sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity. Data analysis was done SPSS version 22. Results: The study population was composed of 97 women and 80 men, of mean age 70.3 \u00b1 6.7 years. GNRI was negatively correlated with skeletal muscle mass index (SMMI). The new index was positively correlated with handgrip strength, SMM, and SMMI. Fat-mass, fat percent, hip and waist circumference, and body mass index were correlated positively with GNRI, negatively with the new index. In linear regression analysis, GNRI was related to fat-mass, fat percent, Introduction: Anorexia is commonly reported by older people and portends malnutrition and adverse outcomes. The 4-item Simplified Nutritional Appetite Questionnaire (SNAQ) predicted weight loss and adverse outcomes in outpatient and inpatient settings at cutoff of B14. We aimed to establish optimal cutoff of SNAQ and association with outcomes in non-frail community-dwelling older adults. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of 230 participants (mean age 67.2 years; 72.6% females) who were non-frail by FRAIL criteria. We performed receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for optimal cutoff of malnutrition risk via Mini-Nutritional Assessment. Using linear regression adjusted for age and gender, we determined the association of anorexia with International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and Frenchay Activities Index (FAI); Life Space Assessment (LSA); 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS); Social Frailty Scale (SFS-8); and modified Fried criteria for physical frailty. Results: The optimal cutoff for malnutrition risk was 15 (Area under curve=0.71, 95% CI: 0.56-0.85, Sensitivity=69.2%, Speci-ficity=61.8%). SNAQ cutoffs of B15 and B14 identified 93 (40.4%) and 42 (18.3%) participants respectively with anorexia. SNAQ cutoff B15 was associated with physical activity measured using IPAQ Results: Were admitted 114 patients, 58.8%(n=67) submitted to a nutritional evaluation.The majority were female, 77.6%(n=52), with an average age of 84 years. The FS more prevalent at admission was 6 (34.3% n=23) and KATZ level was A, 31.3%(n=21). The mean length of stay was 19.7 days.The BMI adjusted to age\\20.5 prevalence was 22.4%(n=15) and 46.3%(n=31) had a NRS [3. In patients with FS B5 the prevalence of NRS [3 was 40% compare to 55.5% in FS[5. Key conclusions: This study reveals that almost half of the patients are at risk of malnutrition, should initiate a personalized diet and nutrition supplements. The FS and malnutrition seem to be correlated and could lead to a worst outcome. If we miss a nutritional assessment, it could mean that a significant number of patients will lose treatment strategies and have a higher risk of worst outcome. [1,[5] [6] References : ",

In this procedure, we appealed to nine experts with doctoral degrees related to gerontology.Results: At the end of the translation process, a preliminary version of the Social Isolation Scale -PT (14 items) was obtained. After the first round, six items showed a CVI \\0.8. After review, the second evaluation had seven items that showed a CVIC0.89 and the remaining items had a CVI=1. The average value of the CVI was 0.95, the universal agreement of the CVI was 0.5 and the pc values ranged between 0. 018 Purpose: To explore the association between the number of medications and mortality in geriatric inpatients taking activities of daily living and comorbidities into account. Methods: A nationwide population-based cohort study was performed including all patients aged C65 years admitted to geriatric departments in Denmark during 2005-2014. The outcome of interest was mortality. Activities of daily living using Barthel-Index (BI) were measured at admission. National health registers were used to link ",

Opris 1 1 National Institute of Gerontology and Geriatrics ''Ana Aslan'', Bucharest, Romania Introduction: Diabetes mellitus has been recognized as a chronic metabolic disease which includes a variety of syndromes with different etiologies characterized mainly by hyperglycemia. Most of the studies have suggested that oxidative stress plays a key role in the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications. The mechanisms by which oxidative stress interfere in the appearance of vascular lesions in diabetic patients are: intensification of low density lipoproteins oxidation (oxLDL), endothelial dysfunction, vascular inflammation, activation of thrombosis processes. Methods: The purpose of this study was to assess the LDL susceptibility to lipid peroxidation in two study groups of older patients (aged 72 \u00b1 6 years): a control group and a group with type 2 diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The LDL susceptibility to ''in vitro'' induced lipid peroxidation was evaluated following its incubation with a prooxidant system. Results: The results obtained in patients with NIDDM showed a significant increase in the susceptibility of LDL to lipid peroxidation Introduction: Frailty has the potential to be delayed or reversed by appropriate interventions, however these are often not available in countries lacking formal geriatric education/infrastructure. The aim of this study was to: (a) explore ideas, perceptions and attitudes of primary health care (PHC) professionals towards frailty in a country where geriatrics is not recognised as a specialty; (b) explore PHC professionals' training needs in frailty; and (c) define components of a frailty educational programme in PHC. Methods: Qualitative study. Two focus groups with PHC professionals were conducted in Thessaloniki, Greece in November 2019. Focus groups were audio recorded, transcribed, and data was thematically analysed. Results: 31 PHC professionals participated in the study (17 physicians, 12 nurses, and 2 health visitors). Four main themes were identified: (1) Perceptions and understanding of frailty; (2) Facilitators and barriers to frailty identification and management; (3) Motivation to participate in a frailty training programme; (4) Education and training. The main barriers for the identification and management of frailty were associated with the healthcare system (e.g. duration of appointments, focus on prescribing, staffing of allied health professionals, multidisciplinary team not available). A gap in education on frailty was highlighted, with scarce training opportunities, based on personal incentive. Professionals were receptive to training in frailty with a focus on peer learning and practical skills with direct clinical application.Background: An Integrated Falls Prevention Pathway was established in 2015 in our Community Health Organisation. The services included in the pathway are the specialist falls clinics, community rehabilitation teams and community-based multifactorial falls risk assessment clinics (FRACs). We examined the demographics and risk factor profiles of those attending the FRACs over a 3-month period. Methods: Those who attended the five FRACs between January and March 2018 were identified from the falls service administrative database. Information on 11 risk factors for falls were extracted from Quickscreen\u00d2 summary reports. Quickscreen\u00d2 involves taking a falls history, medication review,, and it assesses vision, cognition, sensation, strength, balance and reaction time using formal screening tools. Fracture risk was assessed with the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX\u00d2).Results: Overall 82 people attended the FRACs during the study period. The average age was 78 years (range 54-95) and 65 (79%) were female. The average number of falls risk factors was 6 (range [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . 74 (90%) attendees had a history of falls, 69 (84%) were on four? medications. Visual impairment was present in 47 (58%) of attendees and 61 (74%) had impairments of strength, reaction times or balance. 2 Waterford Institute of Technology, 3 ",

However, they have not yet been widely implemented, due to challenges with translation into practice and limited capacity within health services. Methods: The DEFRAIL (Diet and Exercise for Frailty) intervention was developed by consensus using a modified Delphi process. It involves an eight-week multicomponent group exercise program, suitable for community delivery, with protein supplementation. Participants recruited from Geriatric Medicine clinics were assessed at baseline, after eight weeks of regular activity (Control period), and following the eight-week program (Intervention period). The primary outcome measure was the Fried frailty score. Secondary outcome measures included measures of physical performance, body composition, cognition, mood, pain and frailty biomarkers. Results: 28 participants (22 female, 6 male) commenced the program, of which 22 (16 female, 6 male) completed follow-up assessments. There were no significant changes in outcome measures during the 8-week control period. However, the median Fried frailty score improved from 4 (IQR 3-4) to 2 (IQR 1 to2) (Z = -4.102, p\\0.001) over the eight-week intervention, while the median ''Timed Up & Go'' improved from 18.09 seconds to 15.56 seconds ) (Z = -2.45, p = 0.014), and the median 30-second sit-to-stand improved from 6 (IQR 4.5-8.0) to 8 (IQR 3.75-10) (Z = -2.58, p = 0.010). Key conclusions: The DEFRAIL intervention may provide an effective community-based means of reversing frailty and its associated adverse outcomes. To demonstrate this, a larger longitudinal study is required.",

The aim of this cost analysis is to use published data to estimate a potential monetary saving that the DEFRAIL intervention could provide to the Irish healthcare system. Methods: DEFRAIL uses the Fried Frailty Index (FFI) to identify and track changes in frailty. A total of 22 patients completed the 8 week intervention. Median FFI pre-intervention and post intervention were 4 and 2 respectively. Components of the service costs required to deliver DEFRAIL were the exercise facility, dietary supplementation, instructors and equipment. The cost of these components were evaluated retrospectively. Potential cost savings due to DEFRAIL were calculated for each patient individually using data from a prospective 3 month analysis on the association of FFI with healthcare costs in Germany.Results: The cost of DEFRAIL was \u20ac341.62 per participant and \u20ac7,515.66 in total. At baseline prior to DEFRAIL the total projected 3 month healthcare cost of all 22 patients corresponding to their FFI was \u20ac29,911.41. After DEFRAIL, projected 3 month healthcare costs aligned to the re-calculated FFI, had significantly reduced to \u20ac4,650.02 potentially saving an average of \u20ac1148.25 per patient or \u20ac25,261.39 in total anticipated healthcare related costs. Conclusion: This analysis using published data indicates that there may be a significant cost saving in terms of healthcare resource use post DEFRAIL. It warrants further cost-effectiveness analysis using a definitive intervention trial.",

Objectives: This study aims to determine its prevalence and analyze its association with demographic, clinical, cardiological, laboratory, nutritional, functional and mental variables. Material and methods: Prospective longitudinal epidemiological study that included all subjects over the age of 75 with symptomatic SAS who could benefit from undergoing valve replacement, attended by the Heart Team between May 2018 and February 2020. Results: 286 patients with a mean age of 83.99 \u00b1 4.01 years, most of them women (61.2%) without high associated comorbidity (abbreviated Charlson 1.44 \u00b1 1.29) were included in the study; with good nutritional (MNA 11.61 \u00b1 1.80), functional (Lawton males 4.09 \u00b1 Background: Balance disorder due to age-related progressive loss of functioning are considered a global epidemic according to the World Health Organization. Generally, balance disorders contribute to a falling rate of approximately 40% in the older population ([ 65 years). An evidence-based prevention-and rehabilitation strategy of falling should include balance training. However, for clinical routine, no standardized exercise procedures exist, even if practice guidelines provide recommendations for the management of older adults at risk for falls. As part of the EU-project HoloBalance, a systematic review of the previous guidelines on balance physiotherapy was carried out Abstract # 332 Introduction: Growing evidences support safety and feasibility of elective breast surgery in elderly patients, while surgical treatment of other gynecological cancers seems to be a neglected issue. Methods: All over 65 y.o. patients referred for CGA before endometrial or ovarian cancer surgery from 02/15 to 02/20 at Bologna University Hospital were prospectively included. For each patient we recorded: oncological and surgical variables, G8 score, CGA test results, 30-day postoperative complications and hospital length of stay. Logistic regression identified predictive variables for complications.Results: 65 patients were included (median age 73); 53,7% had a FIGO stage C 3 cancer. Although 60.3% was ASA C 3, the majority were independent for ADL and IADL, had no cognitive impairement, no CIRS severe comorbidities, good physical performance and normal nutritional status. At least one complication was recorded for 26 patients (40%), but only 5 (7.7%) were Clavien Dindo C 3. Independent predictors of complications are number of CIRS-G categories endorsed (OR = 1,488; P=0.019) and the G8 (OR = 0.785; P = 0.048), which is the only independent predictor for major complications (OR = 0.560; P = 0.012); surgical variables do not reach statistical significance. Exclusive laparoscopy (p \\ 0.001) and SLNB (P = 0.012) seem to be associated with a shorter length of stay, robotic surgery with longer operating time (P = 0.009), without changes in outcome. Key conclusions: In this setting, surgery could be safe, CGA can be more complex and appropriate than anesthesiologist's judgement, G8 could be a complication predictor and minimally invasive techniques may be feasible, but further studies are needed to assess their real benefit Introduction: Prostate cancer is common in older men. Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) is an effective treatment but is associated with long-term medical complications including osteoporosis, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia, obesity and ischaemic heart disease. Despite this, there are no national/international guidelines on how to systematically monitor and manage these risks in patients receiving ADT. We evaluate current clinical practice in formally assessing relevant comorbidities at the start of ADT with a view to developing a clinical pathway to improve care.Methods: Consecutive patients attending the oncology first hormone injection clinic between 07/08/2018 and 23/04/2019 are included. Data was retrospectively collected from patients notes accessed via electronic patient records. Results: 190 patients were included. Median age was 70 (age range 53-94). Most common pre-existing comorbidities were hypertension (60.5%), hypercholesterolaemia (38.3%) and diabetes (19.2%) . Although parameters such as BP were often taken, explicit baseline assessment of comorbidity control was low. 22.1% had an explicit baseline assessment of blood pressure control, 20.6% diabetes control, cholesterol 4.2%, DEXA 11.1% and vitamin D 20.0%. This was not more likely even if the comorbidity was already present. The need for monitoring these comorbidities was not often explicitly communicated to the general practitioner (GP). As a result, a new protocolised baseline comorbidities assessment and communication plan was developed. Key conclusion: Relevant comorbidities are not systematically assessed at the start of ADT suggesting the urgent need for national guidelines. A new protocolised assessment and communication aid will be evaluated.",

Dekker 1 1 Introduction: Postoperative complications in older colorectal cancer (CRC) patients are common and associated with worse outcome. Prehabilitation might improve the outcome. The aim is to evaluate postoperative non-surgical complications and determine risk factors in older CRC patients, stratified by prehabilitation. Methods: This observational cohort included C 70 years non-metastatic CRC patients who had elective surgery from 2014-2019 in Reinier de Graaf Hospital, Delft. Patients were divided into prehabilitation and non-prehabilitation group. The primary outcome was non-surgical complications and the secondary outcome surgical complications. Results: In total, we included 357 patients. The 86 patients (24.0%) in the prehabilitation group presented with higher comorbidity scores and walking-aid use than the non-prehabilitation group. In the prehabilitation group 26.7% experienced non-surgical and 23.3% surgical complications. In the non-prehabilitation group 21.8% had non-surgical and 13.7% surgical complications (p-value 0. 339 and 0.034, respectively) . Multivariate analyses showed that C2 comorbidities (OR 3.1 95% CI 1.6-5.7), ASA score CIII (OR 2.7 95% CI 1.5-4.9), walking-aid use (OR 2.2 95% CI 1.1-4.4) and positive Geriatric-8 score (OR 2.7 95% CI 1.1-6.9) were associated with nonsurgical complications in all patients. These risk factors remained significant in the non-prehabilitation group, but had no association in the prehabilitation group. Conclusions: Despite differences in baseline characteristics, we observed similar non-surgical complication rates between prehabilitation and non-prehabilitation group. Furthermore, risk factors for non-surgical complications had no association in the prehabilitation group. This suggests that prehabilitation might compensate Introduction: Cost-effectiveness studies on pacemakers have increased in the last years. However the number of long-term costutility studies is limited. The objective of this study was to perform a cost-utility analysis comparing remote monitoring (RM) versus conventional monitoring (CM) in hospital of patients with pacemakers, 5 years after implant. Methods: This is a controlled, not randomized nor masked clinical trial. Initially, 82 patients with pacemakers were selected (CM=52; RM=30). Patients were monitored during 5 years, after what a total 34 for CM in hospital and 21 for RM finalised the study. It was performed a cost-utility analysis to assess the RM of patients with pacemakers in terms of costs per gained quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs from National Health Service (NHS) and patient perspectives were considered. Results: After follow-up period, total costs per patient were 23.02% higher in the CM than in the RM group, corresponding to a \u20ac82.10 cost saving per patient (p=0.033). However, the reduction of in-hospital visits derived from RM does not impact significantly costs from the NHS perspective, although there was a cost saving of 15.04% per patient (p=0.144). Patients in the CM group showed a slightly better QALY at the end of the study (3.579) than RM group (3.306) . Costs/ QALYs obtained by the CM group were lower than the RM group (p=0.773). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CM in comparison to RM becomes positive (\u20ac301.16).Conclusions: This study confirms that total costs per patient were 23.02% higher in the CM than in the RM group (p=0.033).",

Arthroplasty is a properly-established solution to this pathology witch Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most common in the world. Concurrently, technological advancement improved in many areas, including digital rehabilitation. Most of the studies assess rehabilitation outcomes only in a short time period, and when compared in a long-time, it does not include a digital rehabilitation program. This study aimed to present follow-up results comparing two different home-based programs after TKA in older people: (1) conventional face-to-face sessions (CRT; n=15) and (2) digital intervention (DRT; n=16) performed through an artificial intelligence-powered biofeedback system under remote clinical monitoring (Sword Health); and verify if DRT it is a good possibility to this population after a longterm follow up. Patients were assessed in baseline and follow up (22.6 \u00b1 3.4 months after TKA) through Timed Up and Go test (TUG) and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). The results showed that both groups attained clinically relevant improvements from baseline to long-term follow-up (p\\0.05). KOOS subscale scores and TUG were similar in both groups (p [ 0.05). Therefore, this study demonstrated that digital intervention rehabilitation after TKA is feasible and engaging. Furthermore, it is a promising alternative by demanding fewer human resources in the current paradigm imposed by the pandemic situation through Covid-19.",

Assistive technology (AT) is promoted as a means of retaining autonomy and quality of life for older adults [2] . Thus, the evolution of digitisation of services and eHealth technologies will be key to the restructuring of care delivery and help to personalise and customise individual care [3] . In this context, the SHAPES project [4] aims to create the first European open Ecosystem enabling the largescale deployment of a broad range of digital solutions for supporting and extending healthy and independent living for older adults who are facing permanently or temporarily reduced functionality and capabilities. Methods: The SHAPES Pan-European Pilot Campaign aims at engaging ?2000 older adults across 11 European countries and bringing forward technology to improve their health, well-being and autonomy. A user-centered interoperable SHAPES Technological Platform will be developed, including smart digital solutions tailored to health and care delivery. Among others, the Integrated Healthcare System Long Lasting Memories Care (LLM Care) [5], a web-based platform that combines state-of-the-art mental exercises against cognitive deterioration with physical activity [6] [7] [8] , will be exploited by older adults with or without neurodegenerative diseases. Key conclusions: This venture will lay the ground for the expansion of LLM Care's Ecosystem and its wider deployment across Europe aiming at improving health, well-being and autonomy of older adults.

Methods: This study was based on the population of a long-term care in the middle of Taiwan. There was a following research on the self-reliance care mode of daily life self-ability with the number of samples 40 collected by this study, comparing the self-reliance care mode group (n=20) and general care mode group (n=20) and used a structured questionnaire as the Physical Health Dimension of Quality of Life [1] , as data collection included demographic information and the dimensions of physical health. Data analysis used SPSS 22.0 for Window 2000, frequency distribution table, percentage and t-test to answer questions. Results: The results of this study, which examined the Physical Health Dimension of Quality of Life for Taiwanese elderly. A Chinese version of the Physical Health Dimension of Quality of Life including 7 items, has been used for elderly from the long term-care in Taiwan with good reliability, Cronbach's alpha 0.77 [2] [3] . For the sex distribution, there were 22 males (55%) and 18 female subjects (45%); there were 35 subjects aged 65-85 years and five subjects aged above 85 years; there were 25 subjects speaking both Mandarin and Taiwanese languages, 12 subjects speaking Taiwanese language, and 3 subjects speaking Mandarin. Finding shows the result of t-test analysis. Increasing physical health mostly showed a positive correlation with quality of life, the result suggested that there was a higher level of physical health dimension of quality of life on the self-reliance care mode group (25.5\u00b13.62) comparing with the general care mode group (18.45\u00b14.16). Finding shows the comparison of physical health dimension of quality of life significant differences with two groups p=.000 (p \\ 0.05). Key conclusion: This study indicates that Taiwanese elderly living in the long-term care, suggesting a trend, that choosing the self-reliance care mode group was higher than that general care mode group on the physical health dimension of quality of life. The results can also provide the reference for community, to encourage Taiwanese elderly living in the long-term care to participate in self-reliance care mode for daily life self-ability in the future, and therefore improving their physical health dimension of quality of life.",

            "text": "Nursing personnel in the era of precision health and geriatric care Abstract introduction: Elderly's people health status is characterized by changes in physiology as well as, multimorbidity due to the presence of chronic diseases and frailty. Moreover, they represent a special population group that receive the largest number of drug prescriptions and excessive needs for healthcare [1] . Methods: The authors carried out a bibliographic search using Medline database for the last decade. Search terms used were chosen from the USNLM Institutes of Health list of MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) and free text key terms were used as well. Results: Personalized nursing care (PNC) for elder, in the context of precision health, involves the interpretation and clinical use of -omics information as they derive from system medicine approaches (biology, pharmacology) towards patient advocacy and support throughout testing, treatment adherence and compliance as well as, ongoing chronic monitoring and support for patient decision making [2] . Nurses, representing the largest group of professionals in healthcare, should adopt in the challenges posed from this new era that shifts medicine from the reactive or one-size-fits-all scenario towards participatory, preventive, predictive and personalized healthcare (P4 medicine) [3] . PNC, entailing the uniqueness of an elder individual, not only should be able to adopt this knowledge but also consider the special characteristics of elder population such as polypharmacy or pathophysiological changes that result in different pharmacological response and clinical outcome [4] . Key conclusions: It is essential for nursing profession to stay up to date with the changes generated from the realization in clinical practice of precision medicine and integrate relative content for continuous education [5] . This will allow them to utilize state-of-theart approaches to the bedside, making contributions in the areas of symptom assessment, prevention, management, and treatment towards optimal healthcare in elder patients [4] . References: 1. Yarnall AJ, Sayer AA, Clegg A, Rockwood K, Parker S, Hindle JV. New horizons in multimorbidity in older adults. Age Ageing. 2017;46 (6) Introduction: Glaucoma is a major cause of irreversible blindness worldwide which appears mainly in people over the age of 60 and results in progressive damage to the optic nerve [1] . Nowadays, more than 64 million people are supposed to have glaucoma, with this estimate increasing over the years [1, 2] . Vision impairment is an important public health issue that influences the quality of life of elderly people [3, 4] . Methods: We carried out a bibliographic search using Medline database (English language) for the last decade, in order to investigate the effects of glaucoma on social and emotional wellbeing. Results: Because of the relatively strong association with older age, patients may suffer from multiple co morbidities. Advanced age, family history, race, ocular pathologies and injury and other pathologies such as diabetes and hypertension represent major risks for developing glaucoma.According to the current literature, there are various instruments available to measure quality of life. Many studies are carried out by the developed two instruments for measuring quality of life by WHO, revealing that several aspects of the disease may impair quality of life for glaucoma patients.Visual impairment is the major determining factor for a worse quality of life in such cases and may disturb the patient's daily habits such as reading, walking, driving and recognizing people and objects. Furthermore, fear of going blind and social isolation, side effects of conservative therapy and treatment costs may result in psychological disturbance such as anxiety, fear and depression. Key conclusions: Close monitoring and trusting healthcare providerpatient relationship remain essential for such patients, in order to maintain and improve their quality of life by using appropriate and individualized medical therapy.",

In France, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de G\u00e9riatrie et G\u00e9rontologie (SFGG) join by implementing recommendation to improve the appropriateness of care provided to older inpatients or those living in nursing homes. Method: The recommendations were drawn up according to an iterative model of co-construction with end-users and physicians with preliminary experiment in one region. Analysis and feedback of endusers lead to 5 final recommendations. These refer to the use of antibiotics in urinary tract infections, anxiolytics for a extended period of time, neuroleptics in psycho-behavioural disorders, statins for primary prevention and, finally, the proper collection of preferences concerning level of care of the end-users. The professional practice assessment was carried out using a one day data collection approach on medical records. Results: A total of 5428 practice screenings were conducted among patient-residents, and 1139 patients were included in the practice assessment. These revealed a total of 280 patient-resident situations corresponding to acknowledged practices (i.e. 25%) versus 859 situations (i.e. 75%) whose practice is questionable considering the literature. These situations of practices to be optimised mainly concerned the use of benzodiazepines, neuroleptics and antibiotics in case of urinary colonisation. Conclusion: The Choosing Wisely campaign in geriatrics in France shows a strong involvement of health actors in this type of evaluation, and very heterogeneous practices, particularly in the field of deprescription practices related to psychotropic drug, which must be specifically supported.",

In this study we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of prognostic nutritional index (PNI) in the elderly. We compared PNI with geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) according to their relationship with other nutritional tests and frailty indices. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted between September 2019 and December 2019. Malnutrition was assessed by mini nutritional assessment short-form (MNA-SF), long-form (MNA-LF), Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition criteria (GLIM), PNI, and GNRI. Frailty was assessed by using Fried and SOF (Study of Osteoporotic Fractures) criteria. Data analysis was done by SPSS version 22. Results: The study population was composed of 43 women and 35 men, of mean age 72.6 \u00b1 7.4 years. According to PNI 8 of them were severely malnourished and 11 of them mildly malnourished. According to GNRI 6 of them had high risk, 6 of them had moderate risk and 5 of them had a low risk for malnutrition. PNI and GNRI were related to each other (p\\0.001, r = 0.714). PNI and GNRI were positively related to MNA-SF, MNA-LF, and negatively related to GLIM. SOF scores were negatively related to PNI and GNRI. Fried scores were only related to GNRI. In linear regression analysis, only GNRI were independently related to MNA-SF and MNA-LF (r 2 = 0.214, p = 0.007; r 2 = 0.121, p = 0.018). Key conclusions: The results of this study made us thought that PNI was not as useful as GNRI in the geriatric population. More studies in larger populations could be better.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between malnutrition and polypharmacy in the elderly. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted for a period of 4 months between September 2019 and January 2020. Malnutrition was assessed by mini nutritional assessment short-form (MNA-SF), longform (MNA-LF), Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition criteria (GLIM), and geriatric nutrition risk index (GNRI).

The frequency of inappropriate medicine use was 38%. Key conclusions: In this study, we revealed that malnutrition was related to polypharmacy. Our study is the first that the relationship between polypharmacy and malnutrition was assessed by GLIM criteria. We designated that MNA-LF influenced polypharmacy independently. That made us thought that MNA-LF was more useful for polypharmacy studies. Prospective studies for evaluating the effect of the number of drugs used on malnutrition could be useful.",

In this assessment, the new GLIM criteria have been acknowledged, endorsed for the general population. Objectives: To know the prevalence of malnutrition in our patients. To identify whether GLIM criteria are an effective tool in our patients.METHODOLOGY: Cross-sectional descriptive study in hospitalized patients in two days in January/February 2020. Personal history, biochemical, anthropometric data, intake, MNA and GLIM were collected. SPSS. Results: 73 patients, 73.2% women, average age: 88 years (SD 6.15). Barthel.I\\20: 29.7%. Cholesterol\\150:45.5%. Albumin\\3:18.5%. According to GLIM criteria, 58.6% malnourished. According to MNA, 43.37% malnourished and at risk 42%. 52.4% suffered chronic disease malnutrition. Phenotypic criteria: 52% did not know their usual weight. For this reason, only the involuntary weight loss could be calculated. BMI\\22: 31.5%. Size/Length elbow-wrist: 69.86%.

Inflammatory load in the hospital little appraisable: 56%. Key conclusions: GLIM is a less useful tool in the dependent geriatric patient, taking into account the absence of real recording of criteria. Biochemical markers are not valid as nutritional parameters during hospitalization as they are known to be modified in acute processes. BC in postmenopausal women underestimates the loss of muscle mass by greater accumulation of adipose tissue. The use of CC is prefered. MNA provides our patients a better evaluation and more complete nutritional, functional, dietetic and anthropometric information.",

In an acute geriatrics unit, pharmacy students do not analyse prescriptions during medication reconciliation at admission. For training purposes, they have been asked to do so. Methods: Between November 2018 and March 2019, pharmacy students were instructed to obtain a medication history, reconcile this list with the medical chart and identify drug related problems. These pharmaceutical interventions were then exposed to a pharmacy resident and to the prescriber to assess the appropriateness of these interventions. At the end of the training period, the students were asked to give their opinion on this practice in an open manner. Results: Pharmacy students identified 600 discrepancies in 88 patients, 11.5% of which were rated as unintentional. Geriatricians confirmed 93.8% of the discrepancies and admitted that 8.3% of the discrepancies were unintentional. Moreover, students performed 30 pharmaceutical interventions, 60% of which were accepted by prescribers. Students appreciated this mission, which enabled them to better integrate into the unit and to understand the comprehensive geriatric assessment. Key conclusions: The acceptance rate of pharmaceutical interventions performed by students was not significantly different from the acceptance rate of those performed by the resident during this period, although this is partly related to the low number of pharmaceutical interventions completed. Pharmacy students provided a valuable service, improved the quality of patient care by identifying drugrelated problems.",

Objectives were to assess the percentage of medication related hospital admission (MRA), to highlight the number of pharmaceutical interventions (PIs) performed and to observe 7-day re-admission is these units. Methods: Drug assessment in patients admitted between November 2019 and March 2020 was determined by Kempen's tool, based on hospitalization report. All PIs performed were recorded to assess the targeted drugs, the clinical impact and the acceptance rate. Sevendays re-admission was audited on the computerized patient record. Results: 493 patients received a medication reconciliation. Hospitalization was possibly related to an adverse drug reaction (ADR) in 19.7% of cases (97 patients). 19 patients (19.6%) benefited from a reconciliation at discharge. A PI was performed upon entry for 28 patients (28.9%), during the stay for 37 patients (38.1%) and at discharge for 7 patients (36.8%). A total of 147 PIs were performed, involving mainly ATC classes N (43 PIs, 29.3%) and A (37 PIs, 25.2%), had a major clinical impact in 21.8% of cases (32 PIs) and were accepted in 81.0% of cases (119 PIs). One patient was re-hospitalized less than 7 days after discharge, for the same ADR. Key conclusion: Pharmacists can improve the drug management in geriatrics wards where medication-related hospital admission is frequent, up to 40% in a recent study even though very few patients are readmitted soon. Results: 789 PI were performed for 929 patients mainly for ATC classes: digestive tract and metabolism A (29%), blood and hematopoietic organs B (21%), cardiovascular system C (13%) and nervous system N (13%). The most frequent inappropriate prescriptions were therapeutic absence for validated medical indication (18%), supra-therapeutic dosage (14%) and non-prescribed posttransfer drug (14%). The clinical impact was major in 24% of cases. At admission and at discharge, 493 and 107 MR were performed for 507 patients, respectively; 235 and 62 UD were found, respectively and concerned ATC classes N (22%), C (18%) and A (17%).

School of Med., 2 Tohoku Univ.School of Med., 3 Kyorin Univ.School of Med.Background: Respiratory muscle (RM) strength plays important roles in coughing and ventilating. Whereas sarcopenia is an aging related loss of muscle mass and function (strength or performance) whose worsening is associated with malnutrition. Nobody has investigated the relationship between RM weakness and malnutrition on pneumonia in old people. Objective: Determine effects of RM weakness in correlation with malnutrition on incidence of pneumonia.Design A cross-sectional study Setting Geriatric ward at 2 hospitals in Japan Participants Inpatients with incidence of pneumonia (n = 47) and controls without pneumonia (n = 35) aged 70 years and older between April 2018 to March 2019. Measurements RM strength (maximal inspiratory pressure (PIMAX) and maximal expiratory pressure), the tongue muscle (TM) strength and sarcopenia, according to the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People were evaluated. Serum-albumin levels at admission and somatic-fat volume were determined as index of malnutrition of the study. All parameters excluding serum-albumin were measured at the time of recovery from pneumonia or other disease. Results: The RM and the TM strengths, body-trunk muscle mass, serum-albumin level, and somatic-fat were significantly lower in pneumonia patients than in controls. A logistic analysis rendered the depressed PIMAX strengths, the low body-trunk muscle mass and the low serum-albumin level in patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia (odds Ratio: 6.85, 6.86 and 5.46, respectively). Conclusion: Functional and quantitative decrease in RM in patients with pneumonia may force old people susceptible to develop pneumonia and intractable to be cured. Furthermore, malnutrition may involve it. Introduction: Sarcopenia is a progressive and generalized disorder of skeletal muscle morphology and function. Its associated with an increased risk of adverse health outcomes and impaired quality of life (QoL). In 2015, a questionnaire intended to measure the QoL in patients with sarcopenia, SarQoL\u00d2, was developed and validated in French. Objectives: Translation, cultural adaptation and validation of the psychometric properties of the original version of SarQoL\u00d2 into Spanish. Material and methods: cross-sectional study, 86 participants. Two direct translations, a synthesized version of the direct translations, two reverse translations, a pre-final version, pre-test and final version were developed.

However, as exercise induced adaptation is primarily driven by the physiological stress imposed (i.e. the internal training response), eliciting a consistent and standardised training dose is necessary to evaluate potential intervention effects. Methods: Thirty community-dwelling older adults (71.7 \u00b1 3.6 years; 12 female) na\u00efve to RE, performed 6 weeks of twice weekly, machine-based progressive RE involving a combination of upper-and lower-body exercises. Internal training response was quantified using ratings of perceived exertion (RPE). Following each RE session, participants provided an overall rating of perceived exertion (sRPE) and differential ratings of perceived exertion for upper-body muscle exertion (sRPE-U) and lower-body muscle exertion (sRPE-L) using the CR100 scale (range 0-100 arbitrary units [AU]; 12, easy; 22, moderate; 35, somewhat hard; 50, hard; 100, maximal). Results: Twenty-nine participants completed the intervention (97% attendance) with mean RE session intensity rated as between 'somewhat hard ' and 'hard' (sRPE: 38 \u00b1 19, .

Introduction: Given the need to establish new criteria, the EWG-SOP2 defines the sarcopenia as the loss of strength and muscle mass and determines the parameters by diagnosis. The objective was to identify the prevalence of sarcopenia in institutionalised older people who live in Catalonian nursing homes (NH), according to the new criteria of the EWGSOP2. Methods: A cross-sectional study in 4 NH of the Osona region (Barcelona) was conducted from January to March 2020. Residents with sarcopenia were identified using the algorithm developed and suggested by the EWGSOP2 for sarcopenia case finding and screening in practice. The main variables in the diagnosis of sarcopenia were strength, assessed by a hand grip dynamometer, muscle mass, measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis and physical performance, evaluated by the Four Meter Walking Test. Results: 145 individuals were initially included, of which 64 were excluded to no fulfil criteria of the main study (Clinical Trials register number NCT04297904) or for not being able to perform the three assessments. 81 participants (55.8 %), mean age of 84.6 years (SD=\u00b1 7.8), 67 (82.7%) women, were finally included. 6 (7.4%) had no sarcopenia, 55 (67.9%) were diagnosed of probable sarcopenia, 12 (14.81%) of confirmed sarcopenia and 8 (9.87%) of severe sarcopenia.",

Despite the available new criteria of sarcopenia developed by European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP2 algorithm), its early diagnosis remains difficult, highlighting the necessity of looking for a valid muscle wasting biomarker. Myostatin, a muscle mass negative regulator, is one of the potential candidates.The aim of this work is to point out various factors affecting the potential of myostatin as a biomarker of muscle wasting. Based on the literature review, we can say that although myostatin raised high hopes as a candidate for sarcopenia biomarker, recent studies produced conflicting results and revealed numerous potential confounding factors influencing its use in sarcopenia diagnosing. These factors include physiological variables affecting serum myostatin abundance (such as age, sex, physical exercise and activity of various agents inhibiting and promoting myostatin pathway), as well as a variety of disorders (including heart failure, obesity and insulin resistance, kidney failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and inflammatory diseases) and differences in laboratory measurement methodology.Our final conclusion is that although serum myostatin alone might not prove to be a feasible singular biomarker, it could become an important part of a recently proposed panel of muscle wasting biomarkers. However, a thorough understanding of the interrelationship of these markers for muscle mass and function, as well as establishing valid measurement methodology for myostatin and revising current research data in the light of new criteria of sarcopenia is needed.",

The elderly persons are the most susceptible to UTI that frequently requires successive hospitalization. Methods: We conducted a one-year retrospective study (2019) in Hospital Sf. Luca, on 1791 patients with a mean-age73 \u00b1 6,23 years. Data for the study were Urinalysis and antibiograms performed by AutomatMicroscan. We analyzed the demographic profile, the incidence of the favoring factors and the frequency of the symptoms encountered. Isolated microorganisms and their sensitivity to antibiotics were the basis of a comparative analysis using SPSS software. Results: There were 221 Urinalysis 23 of which were asymptomatic bacteria. 82.32% of patients are women; 51% are from rural areas; age group (75-84y) are the most numerous (46.6%). Constipation and insufficient hydration are the most frequent favoring factors (50%); drug abuse is very rare in Romanian elderly (0.5%). The most common symptoms (67%) are pollakiuria and dysuria.The distribution of Urine culture showed growth of Escherichia Colli(58.4%), Klebsiella(17.7%); Enterococcus and Pseudomonas in approx. equal to (4.52%). Escherichia Coli were sensitive to quinolones (73%), cephalosporins(54%) and carbapenem(90.9%). The most effective antibiotics were Amikacinum (80% sensitivity) for Proteus and Pseudomonas; Carbapenem(90%sensitivity) for Escherichia Coli and Proteus. The uropathogens that were the most resistant to antibiotics: Klebsiella (60%); Enterococcus(62%), Staphylococcus Aureus(68%). Key conclusions: Our outcomes show that isolated uropathogens have a low sensitivity to antibiotics. This increasing resistance to broad-spectrum antibiotics is particularly troublesome at elderly, a frail populational group.",

UI is thought to be related with depression and quality of life (QOL). In this study, we aimed to evaluate effect of UI treatment on QOL, depression, anxiety, and disability. Methods: This prospective study was conducted for a period of 6 months from August 2019 to February 2020. Women applied to outpatient clinic with urge incontinence were included to the study. Patients were evaluated for QOL, anxiety, depression, disability and geriatric syndromes before and after treatment. QOL was assessed by International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) and Incontinence of Quality of Life Questionnaire (I-QOL). Anxiety and depression was assessed by Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADs). SPSS versiyon 22 was used for data analysis. Results: The study population was composed of 42 women; aged 69.7 \u00b1 4.3 years. QOL, anxiety and depression symptoms, and daily activities of living (ADL) were revealed to be improved after treatment. ADL and I-QOL scores were positively, ICIQ-SF and HAD scores were negatively correlated to treatment. ICIQ-SF, I-QOL and HADs scores were associated with UI treatment when evaluated with one-way MANOVA (F [4, 79] =3.25, p=0.00, Wilk's K=0.859, partial g 2 =0.14). Key conclusions: This study revealed that fesoterodin improved QOL and psychological symptoms. Those findings demonstrated that proper treatment of UI is critical for healty ageing. Our study is unique because there was no previous study about the effect of anticholinergic treatment on life quality, anxiety and depression in patients with UI. ",
