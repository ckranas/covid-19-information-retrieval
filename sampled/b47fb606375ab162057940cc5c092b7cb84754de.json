            "text": "For robots to navigate and interact more richly with the world around them, they will likely require a deeper understanding of the world in which they operate. In robotics and related research fields, the study of understanding is often referred to as semantics, which dictates what does the world 'mean' to a robot, and is strongly tied to the question of how to represent that meaning. With humans and robots increasingly operating in the same world, the prospects of human-robot interaction also bring semantics and ontology of natural language into the picture. Driven by need, as well as by enablers like increasing availability of training data and computational resources, semantics is a rapidly growing research area in robotics. The field has received significant attention in the research literature to date, but most reviews and surveys have focused on particular aspects of the topic: the technical research issues regarding its use in specific robotic topics like mapping or segmentation, or its relevance to one particular application domain like autonomous driving. A new treatment is therefore required, and is also timely because so much relevant research has occurred since many of the key surveys were published. This survey paper therefore provides an overarching snapshot of where semantics in robotics stands today. We establish a taxonomy for semantics research in or relevant to robotics, split into four broad categories of activity, in which semantics are extracted, used, or both. Within these broad categories we survey dozens of major topics including fundamentals from the computer vision field and key robotics research areas utilizing semantics, including mapping, navigation and interaction with the world. The paper also covers key practical considerations, including enablers like increased data availability and improved computational hardware, and major application areas where semantics is or is likely to play a key role. In creating this survey, we hope to provide researchers across academia and industry with a comprehensive reference that helps facilitate future research in this exciting field. used in communicating between robots and humans or between robots themselves. There are several areas of relevance to robotics where semantics have been a strong focus in recent years, including SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping), segmentation and object recognition.",

There are multiple methods, but they can be split into two categories. Firstly, provided semantics describes situations where the robot is given the knowledge beforehand. Learnt semantics describes situations where the robot, either beforehand or during deployment, learns this information. The learning mechanism leads to further sub categorisation: learning from observation of the entities of interest in the environment, and actual interaction with the entities of interest, such as through manipulation. Learning can occur in a supervised, unsupervised or semi-supervised manner.",

Increases in dataset availability, access to the cloud and compute resources have also been critical, providing a much richer source of information from which robots can learn, and the computational power with which to do so, rapidly and at scale.

This review highlighted the evolution of SLAM, from its earlier focus on probabilistic formulations and analyses of fundamental properties to the current and growing focus on robustness, scalablity and high-level understanding of the environment -where semantics comes to the fore. Also discussed were robustness and scalability in the context of long-term autonomy and how the underlying representation models, metric and semantic, shape the SLAM problem formulation. For the high-level semantic representation and understanding of the environment, [1] discussed literature where SLAM is used for inferring semantics, and semantics are used to improve SLAM, paving the way for a joint optimization-based semantic SLAM system. They further highlight the key challenges of such a system, including consistent fusion of semantic and metric information, task-driven semantic representations, dynamic adaptation to changes in the environment, and effective exploitation of semantic reasoning.",

They categorized algorithms according to scalability, inference model, temporal coherence and topological map usage, while outlining their potential applications and emphasizing the role of human interaction, knowledge representation and planning. More recently, [8] reviewed current progress in SLAM research, proposing that SLAM including semantic components could evolve into \"Spatial AI\", either in the form of autonomous AI, such as a robot, or as Intelligent Augmentation (IA), such as in the form of an AR headset. A Spatial AI system would not only capture and represent the scene intelligently but also take into account the embodied device's constraints, thus requiring joint innovation and co-design of algorithms, processors and sensors. More recently, [9] presented Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) as an algorithmic framework suited to the needs of a Spatial AI system, capable of delivering high performance despite resource constraints. The proposals in both [8] and [9] are significantly motivated by rapid developments in processor hardware, and touch on the opportunities for closing the gap between intelligent perception and resource-constrained deployment devices. More recently, [10] surveyed the use of semantics for visual SLAM, particularly reviewing the integration of \"semantic extractors\" (object recognition and semantic segmentation) within modern visual SLAM pipelines.",

Most mobile robot and drone systems deployed today make relatively little use of explicit higher level \"meaning\" and typically only consider geometric maps of environments, or three dimensional models of objects in manufacturing and logistics contexts. Despite considerable success and uptake to date, there is a large range of domains with few, if any, commercial robotic deployments; for example: aged care and assisted living facilities, autonomous on-road vehicles, and drones operating in close proximity to cluttered, human-filled environments. Many challenges remain to be solved, but we argue one of the most significant is simply that robots will need to better understand the world in which they operate, in order for them to move into useful and safe deployments in more diverse environments.

            "text": "Semantics is a widely used term, not just in robotics but across fields ranging from linguistics to philosophy. In the robotics domain, despite widespread usage of semantics, there is relatively little formal definition of what the term means. In this survey, we aim to provide a taxonomy rather than specific definition of semantics, and note that the surveyed research exists along a spectrum from traditional, non-semantic approaches to those which are primarily semantically-based. Broadly speaking, we can consider semantics in a robotics context to be about the meaning of things: the meaning of places, objects, other entities occupying the environment, or even the language understand the level of depth required for a given Neural Network (NN) application. With a vision of creating general purpose learning algorithms, they highlighted the need for a brain-like learning system following the rules of fractional neural activation and sparse neural connectivity. [12] presented a more focused review of deep learning, surveying generic object detection. They highlighted the key elements involved in the task such as the accuracy-efficiency trade-off of detection frameworks, the choice and evolution of backbone networks, the robustness of object representation and reasoning based on additionally available context. A significant body of work has focused on extracting more meaningful abstractions of the raw data typically obtained in robotics such as 3D point clouds. Towards this end, a number of surveys have been conducted in recent years for point cloud filtering [13] and description [14] , 3D shape/object classification [15] , [16] , 3D object detection [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , 3D object tracking [16] and 3D semantic segmentation [15] [16] [17] , [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . With only a couple of exceptions, all of these surveys have particularly reviewed the use of deep learning on 3D point clouds for respective tasks. Segmentation has also long been a fundamental component of many robotic and autonomous vehicle systems, with semantic segmentation focusing on labeling areas or pixels in an image by class type. In particular the overall goal is to label by class, not by instance. For example, in an autonomous vehicle context this goal constitutes labeling pixels as belonging to a vehicle, rather than as a specific instance of a vehicle (although that is also an important capability). The topic has been the focus of a large quantity of research with resulting survey papers that focus primarily on semantic segmentation, such as [22] , [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] .",

They classified semantics-based methods for recognition into four categories: syntactic methods based on symbols and rules, affordance-based understanding of objects in the environment, graph-based encoding of complex variable relations, and knowledge-based methods. In conjunction with recognition, different methods to learn and execute various tasks were also reviewed including learning by demonstration, learning by observation and execution based on structured plans. Likewise for the service robotics field, [32] presented a survey of visionbased semantic mapping, particularly focusing on its need for an effective human-robot interface for service robots, beyond pure navigation capabilities.

[34] and [35] surveyed the \"semantic gap\" in current content-based image retrieval systems, highlighting the discrepancy between the limited descriptive power of low-level image features and the typical richness of (human) user semantics. Bridging this gap is likely to be important for both improved robot capabilities and better interfaces with humans. Some of the reviewed approaches to reducing the semantic gap, as discussed in [35] , include the use of object ontology, learning meaningful associations between image features and query concepts and learning the user's intention by relevance feedback. This semantic gap concept has gained significant attention and is reviewed in a range of other papers including [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . Acting upon the enriched understanding of the scene, robots are also likely to require sophisticated grasping capabilities, as reviewed in [43] , covering vision-based robotic grasping in the context of object localization, pose estimation, grasp detection and motion planning. Enriched interaction with the environment based on an understanding of what can be done with an object -its \"affordances\" -is also important, as reviewed in [44] . Enriched interaction with humans is also likely to require an understanding of language, as reviewed recently by [45] . This review covers some of the key elements of language usage by robots: collaboration via dialogue with a person, language as a means to drive learning and understanding natural language requests, and deployment, as shown in application examples.",

As can be seen in the previous section, there has been both extensive research across these fields as well as a number of key survey and review papers summarizing progress to date. These deep dives into specific sub-areas in robotics can provide readers with a deep understanding of technical considerations regarding semantics in that context. As the field continues to grow however there is increasing need for an overview that more broadly covers semantics across all of robotics, whilst still providing sufficient technical coverage to be of use to practitioners working in these fields. For example, while [1] extensively considers the use of semantics primarily within SLAM research, there is a need to more broadly cover the role of semantics in various robotics tasks and competencies which are closely related to each other. The task, \"bring a cup of coffee\", likely requires semantic understanding borne out of both the underlying SLAM system and the affordance-grasping pipeline. This survey therefore goes beyond specific application domains or methodologies to provide an overarching survey of semantics across all of robotics, as well as the semantics-enabling research that occurs in related fields like computer vision and machine learning. To encompass such a broad range of topics in this survey, we have divided our coverage of research relating to semantics into a) the fundamentals underlying the current and potential use of semantics in robotics, b) the widespread use of semantics in robotic mapping and navigation systems, and c) the use of semantics to enhance the range of interactions robots have with the world, with humans, and with other robots.",

            "text": "This survey is also motivated by timeliness: the use of semantics is a rapidly evolving area, due to both significant current interest in this field, as well as technological advances in local and cloud compute, and the increasing availability of data that is critical to developing or training these semantic systems. Consequently, with many of the key papers now half a decade old or more, it is useful to capture a snapshot of the field as it stands now, and to update the treatment of various topic areas based on recently proposed paradigms. For example, this paper discusses recent semantic mapping paradigms that mostly post-date key papers by [1] , [7] , such as combining single-and multi-view point clouds with semantic segmentation to directly obtain a local semantic map [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] . Whilst contributing a new overview of the use of semantics across robotics in general, we are also careful to adhere where possible to recent proposed taxonomies in specific research areas. For example, in the area of 3D point clouds and their usage for semantics, within Section III-C, with the help of key representative papers, we briefly describe the recent research evolution of using 3D point cloud representations for learning object-or pixel-level semantic labeling, in line with the taxonomy proposed by existing comprehensive surveys [15] [16] [17] , [22] , [23] . Finally, beyond covering new high level conceptual developments, there is also the need to simply update the paper-level coverage of what has been an incredibly large volume of research in these fields even over the past five years. The survey refers to well over a hundred research works from the past year alone, representative of a much larger total number of research works. This breadth of coverage would normally come at the cost of some depth of coverage: here we have attempted to cover the individual topics in as much detail as possible, with over 900 referenced works covered in total. Where appropriate we also make reference to prior survey and review papers where further detailed coverage may be of interest, such as for the topic of 3D point clouds and their usage for semantics.",

            "text": "1) Static and Un-embodied Scene Understanding, where the focus of research is typically on developing intrinsic capability to extract semantic information from images, for example, object recognition and image classification. The majority of research in this direction uses single image-based 2D input to infer the underlying semantic or 3D content of that image. However, image acquisition and processing in this case is primarily static in nature (including videos shot by a static camera), separating it conceptually from a mobile embodied agent's dynamic perception of the environment due to motion of the agent. Because RGB cameras are widely used in robotics, and the tasks being performed, such as object recognition, are also performed by robots, advances in this area are relevant to robotics research. In Section II, we introduce the fundamental components of semantics that relate to or enable robotics, focusing on topics that have been primarily or initially investigated in non-robotics but related research fields, such as computer vision. We cover the key components of semantics as regards object detection, segmentation, scene representations and image retrieval, all highly relevant capabilities for robotics, even if not all the work has yet been demonstrated on robotic platforms. 2) Dynamic Environment Understanding and Mapping, where the research is typically motivated by the mobile or dynamic nature of robots and their surroundings. The research literature in this category includes the task of semantic mapping, which could be topological, or a dense and precise 3D reconstruction. These mapping tasks can often leverage advances in static scene understanding research, for example, place categorization (image classification) forming the basis of semantic topological mapping, or pixel-wise semantic segmentation being used as part of a semantic 3D reconstruction pipeline. Semantic maps provide a representation of information and understanding at an environment or spatial level. With the increasing use of 3D sensing devices, along with the maturity of visual SLAM, research on semantic understanding of 3D point clouds is also growing, aimed at enabling a richer semantic representation of the 3D world. In Section III, we cover the use of semantics for developing representations and understanding at an environment level. This includes the use of places, objects and scene graphs for semantic mapping, and 3D scene understanding through Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) and point clouds processing. 3) Interacting with Humans and the World, where the existing research \"connects the dots\" between the ability to perceive and the ability to act. The literature in this space can be further divided into the \"perception of interaction\" and \"perception for interaction\". The former includes the basic abilities of understanding actions and activities of humans and other dynamic agents, and enabling robots to learn from demonstration. The latter encompasses research related to the use of the perceived information to act or perform a task, for example, developing a manipulation strategy for a detected object. In the context of robotics, detecting an object's affordances can be as important as recognizing that object, enabling semantic reasoning relevant to the task and affordances (e.g. 'cut' and 'contain') rather than to the specific object category (e.g. 'knife' and 'jar'). While object grasping and manipulation relate to a robot's interaction with the environment, research on interaction with other humans and robots includes the use of natural language to generate inverse semantics, or to follow navigation instructions. Section IV addresses the use of semantics to facilitate robot interaction with the world, as well as with the humans and robots that inhabit that world. It looks at key issues around affordances, grasping, manipulation, higher-level goals and decision making, human-robot interaction and vision-and-language navigation. 4) Improving Task Capability, where researchers have focused on utilizing semantic representations to improve the capability of other tasks. This includes for example the use of semantics for high-level reasoning to improve localization and visual place recognition techniques. Furthermore, semantic information can be used to solve more challenging problems such as dealing with challenging environmental conditions. Robotics researchers have also focused on techniques that unlock the full potential of semantics in robotics, since existing research has not always been motivated by or had to deal with the challenges of real world robotic applications, by addressing challenges like noise, clutter, cost, uncertainty and efficiency. In Section V, we discuss various ways in which researchers extract or employ semantic representations for localization and visual place recognition, dealing with challenging environmental conditions, and generally enabling semantics in a robotics context through addressing additional challenges. The four broad categories presented above encompass the relevant literature on how semantics are defined or used in various contexts in robotics and related fields. This is also reflected in Figure 1 through 'extract semantics' and 'use semantics' labels associated with different sections of the taxonomy. Extracting semantics from images, videos, 3D point clouds, or by actively traversing an environment are all methods of creating semantic representations. Such semantic representations can be input into high-level reasoning and decisionmaking processes, enabling execution of complex tasks such as path planning in a crowded environment, pedestrian intention prediction, and vehicle trajectory prediction. Moreover, the use of semantics is often finetuned to particular applications like agricultural robotics, autonomous driving, augmented reality and UAVs. Rather than simply being exploited, the semantic representations themselves can be jointly developed and defined in consideration of how they are then used. Hence, in Figure 1 , the sections associated with 'use semantics' are also associated with 'extract semantics'. These high-level tasks can benefit from advances in fundamental and applied research related to semantics. But this research alone is not enough: advances in other areas are critical, such as better cloud infrastructure, advanced hardware architectures and compute capability, and the availability of large datasets and knowledge repositories. Section VI reviews the influx of semantics-based approaches for robotic deployments across a wide range of domains, as well as the critical technology enablers underpinning much of this current and future progress. Finally, Section VII discusses some of the key remaining challenges in the field and opportunities for addressing them through future research, concluding coverage of what is likely to remain an exciting and highly active research area into the future.",

Nevertheless, these processes can all play a role in robotics, whether it be for a robot perceiving and understanding the scene in front of it, or searching through its map or database to recognize a place it has visited before. In this section we focus on the fundamental computer vision research involving semantics for static scene understanding which is directly relevant to robotics.

For example, images can be retrieved based on a \"query\" image (find images with similar content), or based on some description of the desired content within the image (find images of trees). Image retrieval in particular has a strong overlap with visual mapping and place recognition techniques, and hence much of the mapping or spatially-specific retrieval research is covered in that section.

            "text": "1) Image-based Classification: A typical goal of this task is to semantically tag images based on their visual content, for example, classifying an image as belonging to a category like \"peacock\" or \"train station\". The former represents the presence of an \"object\" within an image, whereas the latter represents a \"place\". In a broader sense however, image classification or recognition can be based on a hierarchy of concepts that might exist in the visual observation. [51] presented a hierarchical generative model that classifies the overall scene, recognizes and segments each object component, and annotates the image with a list of tags. It is claimed to be the first model that performs all three tasks in one coherent framework. The framework was able to learn robust scene models from noisy web data such as images and user tags from Flickr.com. [52] proposed a high-level image representation, Object Bank, based on a scale-invariant response map of a large number of pre-trained generic object detectors, for the task of object recognition and scene classification. [53] designed an approach to jointly reason about regions, location, class and spatial extent of objects, the presence of a class in the image, and the scene type. The novel reasoning scheme at the segment level enabled efficient learning and inference. [54] proposed the Fisher Vector -a state-of-the-art patch encoding technique -as an alternative to Bag of Visual Words (BoVW), where patches are described by their derivation from a universal generative Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). [55] developed a Bag of Semantic Words (BoSW) model based on automatic dense image segmentation and semantic annotation, achieved by graph cut and (Support Vector Machine) SVM respectively. While the SVM learns one-versus-all classification for different semantic categories, the reduced vocabulary size due to BoSW decreases computation time and increases accuracy. While effective, the methods above rely on hand-designed image features that are not optimally designed for image classification. Consequently alternative approaches that can automatically learn not only the classifier, but also the optimal features, have been investigated, with methods based on deep learning techniques generally being superior, as detailed below.",

With the availability of large-scale image dataset like ImageNet [56] and the availability of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), learning via deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) such as AlexNet [57] opened up enormous opportunities for enhanced scene understanding. [58] introduced the Places dataset, consisting of 7 million labeled scenes, and demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on scene-centric datasets. Through this dataset, complementing ImageNet, [58] highlighted the differences in internal representations of object-centric and scene-centric networks. [59] extended this line of work, discussing the released Places database of 10 million images and its corresponding Places-CNNs baselines for scene recognition problems. [60] showed that object detectors naturally emerge from training CNNs for scene classification. They argue that since scenes are typically composed of objects, CNNs trained on them automatically discover meaningful object detectors, representative of the learned scene category. This work then demonstrated that the same network can perform both scene recognition and object localization in a single forward-pass, without an explicitly taught notion of objects. The methods above are generally referred to as weakly supervised detectors, because they are trained with scene-level annotations but are able to localise objects within a scene. One of their main limitations was that their object detection accuracy was significantly inferior to fully supervised detection methods that relied on object localisation labels -further research in the area has focused on reducing this performance gap. A CNN visualisation technique was presented in [61] where the Class Activation Map (CAM) was based on Global Average Pooling (GAP) in CNNs. This work demonstrated that GAP enables accurate localization ability (i.e. activation of scene category-specific local image regions), despite being trained on image-level labels for scene classification.",

The proposed system uses a newly curated dataset with 8 semantic categories: home, school, work, restaurant, shopping, cinema, sports, and travel. [63] explored aggregation of CNN features through two different modules: a \"Content Estimator\" and a \"Context Estimator\", where the latter is comprised of three sub-modules based on text, object and scene context. The authors claim it is the first work that leverages text information from a scene text detector for extracting context information. The papers above were successful at introducing approaches that combined different modalities, but did not include geometrical information, limiting their ability to \"understand\" the scene. When depth information is available, including when explicitly available from range-based sensors, RGB-D-based scene recognition and classification techniques classify scene images using aligned color and depth information. Wang et al. [64] extracted and combined deep discriminative features from different modalities in a component-aware fusion manner. Gupta et al. [65] transferred the RGB model to depth net using unlabeled paired data according to their mid-level representations. More recently, Du et al. [66] presented a unified framework to integrate the tasks of cross-modal translation and modality specific recognition.

Much of the research in this area has focused on what form that knowledge should take, and how similarity should be calculated. [67] explored conceptrelationship based feature extraction and learning using textual and visual data for content based image retrieval. This was achieved by using five pre-defined specific concept relationships: complete similarity (Beijing, Peking), type similarity (Husky, Bulldog), Hypernym Hyponym (Husky, Domestic Dog), Parallel relationship (cat, dog), and unknown relationship; these conceptual semantic relationships were shown to improve retrieval performance. [68] proposed fusing low-level and high-level features from sketches and images, along with clustering-based reranking optimization for image retrieval. [69] developed a novel joint binary codes learning method that combines image features with latent semantic features (labels/tags of images); the intent was to encode samples sharing the same semantic concepts into similar codes, rather than only preserving geometric structure via hashing. [70] explored a method to retrieve images based on semantic information like \"a boy jumping\" or \"throw\", as opposed to traditional instance-level retrieval. They proposed a similarity function based on annotators' captions as a computable surrogate of true semantic similarity for learning a semantic visual representation. Learning a joint embedding for visual and textual representations improved accuracy, and enabled combined text and image based retrieval.",

[75] presented Situate -an architecture to learn models that capture visual features of objects and their spatial configuration to retrieve instances of visual situations like \"walking a dog\" or \"a game of ping-pong\". The method actively searches for each expected component of the situation in the image to calculate a matching score. [76] explored hierarchy-based semantic embeddings for image retrieval by incorporating prior knowledge about semantic relationships between classes obtained from the class hierarchy of WordNet [77] . [78] used an end-to-end trainable CNN to learn \"semantic correspondences\" as dense flow between images depicting different instances of the same semantic object category, such as a bicycle. To train the CNN, they used binary segmented images with synthetic geometric transformations and a new differentiable argmax function. [79] proposed the Visual Semantic Reasoning Network (VSRN), based on connections between image regions (ROIs from F-RCNN [80] ). This approach learns features with semantic relationships from the pairwise affinity between regions using a Graph Convolutional Network. The research included both image-to-text (caption) and text-to-image (image) retrieval capabilities; the learnt representation (also visualized in 2D) captures key semantic objects (bounding boxes) and semantic concepts (within a caption) of a scene as in the corresponding text caption.",

In the 3D object detection area, [88] explored a detection and tracking pipeline for autonomous vehicles using RGB, LiDAR, and dense semantic segmentation to form semantic point clouds (voxel grids), which are then fed into Complex-YOLO to obtain 3D detections. They use Labeled Multi-Bernoulli-Filter for multi-target tracking and claim to be the first to fuse visual semantics with 3D object detection. [89] presented a generic object tracking framework that uses a semantic segmentation network for object proposals by ranking and selecting relevant feature maps from the final layer based on activations. Temporal information and template models were used to improve prediction. [90] designed a Detection with Enriched Semantics (DES) network for object detection that uses semantic segmentation as an input to the network (in a weakly supervised manner) to enrich the learnt feature maps. They also use a global activation module for extracting high-level information from higher-order layers of the network.

Segmentation is tightly coupled to semantics because the most common segmentation approaches revolve around dividing up the image into semantically meaningful areas, with objects being a common example -in an autonomous vehicle context this could be pedestrians, vehicles, and traffic signs. Dense semantic segmentation is not only often more informative than specific object detection, it also discloses various ways of leveraging additional context for performing a task, for example, utilizing spatial co-existence or physics based priors.

Already a significant research topic before modern deep learning techniques became dominant, earlier works involved elevating the capability of coherent region-based segmentation [93] , including watershed [94] and mean-shift [95] like techniques, to a more meaningful parts-based semantic segmentation [96] [97] [98] . [96] induced semantic labeling using an example image from a common image domain based on a non-parametric model. [97] presented semantic segmentation and object labeling based on a novel region-growing algorithm, combined with context obtained from ontological knowledge representation. [98] explored a hierarchical tree based, rather than flat, partitioning of an image [99] , [100] within the scope of using graph cut [101] for image segmentation. Given that these approaches were mostly based on prior information about particular segmentation tasks, it was challenging for them to produce highly accurate segmentation results.",

They also defined a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Yu et al. [103] designed a CNN specifically for dense prediction, with their proposed model based on \"dilated convolutions\" systematically aggregating multi-scale contextual information without losing resolution. Badrinarayanan et al. [104] presented SegNet, an \"encoderdecoder\" architecture for semantic segmentation. The main novelty of SegNet was in the up-sampling strategy, where the decoder used the pooling indices from the encoder's max pooling step to perform non-linear upsampling, thereby eliminating the need for learning to up-sample. The system was relatively efficient in terms of memory and computation time. Another relevant model was the Unet [105] , that consisted of an encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections from the contracting path (i.e., encoder) to the expanding path (i.e., decoder), with the goal of addressing the issue of vanishing gradients. These approaches represent some of the first attempts to use deep learning for semantic segmentation, and the impressive results at that time significantly motivated the development of new deep learning approaches.",

The Faster R-CNN [80] approach was also extended by He et al. [123] for instance segmentation, by adding a branch for predicting object masks in parallel with existing bounding box recognition. The proposed system demonstrated state-of-the-art results on the following COCO challenges: instance segmentation, bounding box object detection, and person keypoint detection. Bai et al. [124] presented a CNN combining classical watershed transform and modern deep learning to produce an energy map of an image, where object instances are unambiguously represented as energy basins, enabling direct extraction of high quality object instances. Methods based on metric learning [125] , [126] have been explored for instance-level segmentation, with the aim of learning a pixel-based embedding where pixels of the same instance have a similar embedding. One of the current state-of-the-art methods is the masking score RCNN (MS-RCNN) [127] , based on a network block which learns the quality of the predicted instance masks. Unifying the tasks of semantic segmentation and instance segmentation, [128] proposed a joint scene understanding task, termed \"panoptic segmentation\", while also defining a novel Panoptic Quality (PQ) metric to evaluate performance on this task. Panoptic segmentation has become the focus of research in many applications, in particular autonomous driving, with a number of novel techniques developed only recently [129] [130] [131] [132] [133] [134] .

For reasoning about support, they used physical constraints and statistical priors. Gupta et al.

Their system produced contour detection, hierarchical segmentation, grouping by amodal completion, object detection and semantic labeling of objects and scene surfaces.

The authors demonstrated that learning a shared latent representation aids in semantic scene understanding even when input data has imperfect or missing information. [139] presented UpNet, a fusion architecture that can learn from RGB, Near-InfraRed, and depth data to perform semantic segmentation. They also introduced a first-of-its-kind multispectral segmentation benchmark of unstructured forest environments. [140] explored the use of easy-to-obtain synthetic data for semantic segmentation, particularly making use of geometry in the form of synthetic depth maps. They used geometric information to first adapt the input to the segmentation network via image translation, and then adapt the output of the network via simultaneous depth and semantic label prediction. More recently, [141] addressed the problem of open-set instance segmentation by projecting point clouds into a category-agnostic embedding space, where clustering is used to perform 3D segmentation independent of semantics.",

[149] explored joint learning of two tasks, depth estimation and semantic segmentation, using a single model with an uneven number of annotations per modality.

For typical computer vision and robotics problems, imagery constitutes a broad domain where the variability is unlimited and unpredictable, even for images with the same semantic meaning [154] . Historically, the main goal of an effective image representation is the reduction of the semantic gap [155] , defined as the difference between the visual information extracted from an image and its high-level semantic interpretation. Traditional image representations transformed the original image pixels into features spaces of color, shape or texture, with the goal of amplifying particular characteristics of the image that are relevant for representing the semantic information of the scene, while at the same time suppressing irrelevant information. Such a goal can be partially achieved by promoting feature invariance properties that makes the representation robust to (generally) non-relevant distortions to the image, such as geometric transformation, illumination changes, and weather variations. One important trade-off encountered in doing so was between discrimination power and robustness to distortions. So much of the classical work on the design of feature representations was significantly influenced by the goal of finding an effective operating point that balanced discriminative and invariance properties. Color invariance is typically achieved by transforming the original RGB (Red Green Blue) space into a more robust HSV (Hue Saturation Value) space (other similar spaces have also been proposed), where the hue channel is invariant to the illumination and camera direction with respect to an object's orientation [154] . The invariance to shape information is commonly obtained by computing image derivatives using scale-and rotationally-invariant operators [156] . Texture invariance is generally obtained by representing an image in the frequency domain [154] .",

Addressing the issue of scene graph generation dataset biases, Gu et al.

Zero-shot Learning (ZSL) addresses this problem: defined as a learning problem, it focuses on the scenario where the training process has access to the visual and semantic representations of only a subset of the classes. This observed subset is labeled as the seen classes; the challenge during deployment and testing involves the classification of unseen visual classes that do not belong to the set of seen classes [174] . Zero-shot learning generally depends on the learning of a mapping from the visual to the semantic space using the seen classes [174] [175] [176] [177] , where the hope is that this learnt mapping can be reliably used to classify the unseen classes. [178] proposed SP-AEN for zero shot learning to tackle the semantic loss problem in ZSL. Acknowledging that classification and reconstruction are contradictory objectives, an independent visual-to-semantic embedding was introduced for both the tasks. Both these semantic embeddings were used for adversarial learning, and to transfer information between the two tasks.",

This assumption allows the implementation of a conditional generative model that is trained to generate visual representations from their semantic representations using the seen classes. Once the generator is stable, it is then possible to generate unseen visual representations which can be used to directly train a visual classifier with real seen visual representations and generated unseen visual representations [179] . This method can work better than others for the problem of Generalised Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL), where the testing process involves the classification of seen and unseen classes. GZSL is more challenging than vanilla ZSL because the classifier tends to be severely biased towards the classification of seen classes. Much of the current research in the field is therefore focused on achieving a balance between the classification of seen and unseen classes. The general theme of this research is to combine the semantic and visual representations, with modulation of the classification of seen and unseen classes based on the input test visual sample. For example, Felix et al. [180] proposed a cycle consistency loss to generate visual representations from semantic ones, and then in reverse generate the semantic representation. The modulation of seen and unseen classes has also been addressed by Atzmon and Chechik [181] . One can also learn a joint semantic and visual space that mitigates the need for learning a mapping between these two spaces [182] . The classifier is learnt in conjunction with a domain classifier to differentiate between seen and unseen domains. Niu et al. [183] proposed to reduce the projection domain shift, defined as the lack of generalization of visual-semantic mapping based on seen categories to unseen categories. Their approach involved learning an adaptive mapping for each unseen category, followed by progressive label refinement using unlabeled test instances. More recently, [184] proposed LsrGAN, which explicitly transfers the knowledge of semantic relationships between seen and unseen classes by generating corresponding mirrored visual features.",

It can be commonly observed in all these fundamental areas of research that the use of additional sources of information in the form of sensor data, knowledge repositories and textual descriptions can significantly enhance the task performance. This is highly relevant to robotics, as a robot typically carries multiple sensors, can actively explore its environment and has access to additional resources from the \"cloud\" online or on a local network. These tasks also have high functional overlap with those required of robots in many applications. In the following sections, we discuss how semantic understanding approaches like those discussed so far can be used in robotics, and the associated further research advances required to do so.",

In neuroscience and biology, there has been a long running debate about what animals explicitly construct maps for navigation and to what extent they do so, versus achieving navigation through behavioural and reactive techniques [185] . Likewise in robotics, there have been multiple research streams in the robot navigation space; some involving reactive type techniques like behaviour-based robotics [186] [187] [188] but many involving the explicit construction of a map and localization of a robot within that map, in order to plan and execute navigation tasks. Although the field has been an active one for many decades, much of the pivotal work in modern mapping systems occurred in the late 90s and early 2000s with the advent of Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) -which is interchangeably referred to as both a problem field and desired capability.",

The mapping functionality in SLAM derives largely from the capability of the exteroceptive sensors to measure (directly or indirectly) structural or visual elements in the scene. While LiDAR and sonar were dominant sensing modalities in the early days of SLAM [2] [3] [4] , the use of cameras (e.g., standard RGB cameras, depth cameras, and event cameras) as the primary sensors for SLAM (thus leading to visual SLAM) is currently a major area of interest in robotics and computer vision. A key reason behind the popularity of visual SLAM is the flexibility and relatively low cost of optical sensing devices (e.g. consumer RGB and depth cameras). Moreover, compared to other exteroceptive sensors, cameras provide a richer source of information and thus the prospect of extracting higher-level understanding (e.g. semantics) of the scene.",

            "text": "1) Classical 3D Maps: Classical visual SLAM methods have largely focused on extracting the geometric 3D structure of the environment. Feature-based methods [204] [205] [206] [207] [208] [209] (both monocular and stereo) construct maps in the form of sparse 3D point clouds, where the 3D points are typically reconstructions of the salient local features detected in the images. To facilitate the generation of 2D-3D correspondences, descriptors of the local features associated with the reconstructed 3D points are also often embedded in the map. In contrast to featurebased methods, direct methods [210] [211] [212] [213] utilize a photometric error formulation to estimate structure and motion. Maps produced by direct SLAM methods are typically semi-dense or dense 3D point clouds, where each reconstructed 3D point is associated with corresponding pixels (that are not necessarily locally salient) observed across multiple frames in the input sequence. For visualisation, the point clouds are often texture-mapped with pixel RGB values. In contrast to conventional cameras, depth cameras [214] such as the Microsoft Kinect are able to directly acquire depth information at frame rate (such cameras are often called RGB-D cameras since they also record in the RGB channels, in addition to depth). Accordingly, RGB-D SLAM algorithms [215] [216] [217] [218] [219] are able to construct dense volumetric 3D maps of the environment. Since depth cameras can acquire metrically consistent depths, the 3D maps generated via RGB-D SLAM algorithms do not suffer from the global scale ambiguity problem which affects monocular visual SLAM systems.",

One of the limitations of classic metric maps had been the accumulation of error (drift) in global coordinates, despite the use of multiple sensors, beacons and elaborate error-tracking systems [222] . Topological maps do not suffer as directly from the accumulation of movement errors, as the robot has only to navigate locally between adjacent place nodes, although drift is still an issue for loop closure. Furthermore, topological maps are highly scalable when compared to classical metric maps that use detailed a priori models of the world [223] , [224] . Topological SLAM systems have been widely explored in the past where the use of multisensory approaches [225] has gradually been replaced with visual similarity-based metric error correction via loop closures [226] [227] [228] . One of the key enablers for relatively modern topological mapping systems has been the development of Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) [161] like methods, leading to robust large scale appearance-based topological SLAM systems like FAB-MAP [229] . Existing surveys on topological maps [230] and visual place recognition [231] provide further details about developments in this field in recent years.",

In such representations, metric information from the local geometry of the scene is incrementally fused into a global \"topometric\" map, which is defined at a large scale using topological relations between distinct places (the hierarchy is almost always globally topological and locally metric rather than the reverse). Thrun [233] proposed an integration of grid-based and topological maps, where the latter partitions the former into coherent regions. Simhon and Dudek [234] explored a hybrid map representation where local metrically accurate maps, dubbed \"islands of reliability\", form nodes of a topological model of the world, thus avoiding the need to perform large-scale error integration. The Atlas framework developed by [235] comprised an interconnected set of local coordinate \"frames\". Each frame is a local metric map of the environment, connected to other frames via transformations represented as edges in the global graph of coordinate frames. [236] proposed a hybrid map representation, based on extracting \"corners\" and \"openings\" that represented topology, and \"lines\" that represented local geometric structure using a 360 \u2022 laser scanner. [237] explored a landmark-based co-visibility graph representation of the environment, where co-visibility corresponds to the connectivity of a topological map and inter-frame motion is used to encode metric transforms between landmarks.",

[202] developed a probabilistic framework based on chain graphs to create a hierarchical hybrid map comprising four layers: sensory (accurate metric map), place (places and paths information), categorical (geometry and appearance of objects and landmarks), and conceptual (instances of spatial concepts relating a cereal box with kitchen). The proposed system used laser and camera sensors in indoor environments and attempted to relate conceptual knowledge with object and place semantics. [238] presented a cloud service-based semantic mapping system comprising an ontology to code concepts/relations in maps and objects (CAD models), built on top of an RGB-D metric map using both keyframe-based and 3D occupancy gridbased map representations. The proposed system enabled semantic mapping of novel environments and searching for novel objects within a semantic map. In [239] , authors used stereo frames to obtain depth, scene flow, visual odometry and semantic segmentation, all of which formed the input for semantic mapping based on 3D occupancy. This enabled reasoning on objects, and led to object instance discovery based on temporally consistent shape, appearance, motion, and semantic cues in the map, while also being able to handle dynamic objects. More recently, [240] presented a hierarchical framework for probabilistic semantic mapping using multiple cooperative robots in a distributed setting. Although hybrid maps, particularly those involving a semantic layer, are more amenable to human-robot interaction, they are still in a phase where certain implementation choices might limit their universal applicability. It's still unknown whether, given the complexity of robotic tasks and applications, a generalized solution is viable, or whether specialized solutions will be required for each class of applications.",

In this subsection, we first cover the use of scene classification and place categorization, where researchers have focused on abstracting the changing appearance of the scene into meaningful place labels as the robot explores an environment. We then discuss one of the clearest opportunities to enrich robot mapping systems with the use of objects. Since objects can be categorized and are meaningful by themselves, all this information can be used in a variety of ways by semantic mapping and localization approaches. In our discussion below, we further split the objectsbased approaches into two categories: those that use prior knowledge of the expected objects, often including 3D models, and those that have limited or no knowledge available beforehand, instead learning how to use objects at deployment time.",

Alternatively, a more general hierarchical framework approach can also consider the structural properties, for example, having a broad classification based on \"room\" and \"corridor\" be followed by specialization labels of rooms like office and classroom [242] . [241] combined vision and range information to extract objects (e.g. monitor and coffee machine) and geometric features, respectively, which were fed to AdaBoost [243] to classify places and perform efficient global localization. [244] used semantics as \"background knowledge\" to explicitly represent environments with corridors and other indoor structures. Such a semantic distinction led to efficient multi-robot exploration of an environment, through learning of a behaviour which rewarded robots to preference exploring corridors, which led to unexplored branches of connecting rooms.",

[246] presented a CNN-based semantic mapping system that overcame the closed-set limitations of supervised classification by complementing the system with one-vs-all classifiers, in order to recognize new semantic classes online. The proposed system used Bayesian filtering to incorporate prior knowledge and ensure temporal coherence. Furthermore, they also demonstrated the effective use of semantics for improving object recognition and modulating a robot's behavior during navigation tasks. [247] presented a scene classification CNN that incorporates object-level information by regularization of semantic segmentation, demonstrated on indoor RGB-D data. [248] proposed a Dynamic Bayesian Mixture Model (DBMM) -a mixture of heterogeneous base classifiers -that incorporates time-based inferences from previous class-conditional probabilities and priors. Their system used 2D laser scans and indoor data for experiments, and extended their prior work [249] . [250] explored the use of fully-convolutional CNN for learning better feature representations for the task of semantic place categorization. This system used a Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor (NBNN) method within the learning framework for end-to-end training. [251] developed a novel method for domain generalization for place classification to deal with the unknown/unseen deployment scenarios, when the test data might not be similar to the data used for training. In this case, domain generalization was achieved by automatically computing a model for the unknown domain through combining models of the known domains. [252] presented TopoNets for semantic mapping based on the topological structure of the environment, using a Sum-Product Network (SPN) as the backbone for learning and inference. The proposed system was demonstrated on various tasks: place classification, inferring semantics of unexplored space, and novelty detection using the COLD dataset, which includes semantic classes like doorway, kitchen, office, bathroom and laboratory.",

Approaches based on scan registration were among the earliest to emerge in this domain, such as the work presented in [256] . They proposed to learn and track 3D object models from RGB-D indoor data by aligning multiple views of these objects within multi-resolution \"surfel\" maps. Real-time alignment on a CPU was achieved using a probabilistic optimization framework and an efficient variant of ICP. Other approaches have built a point-cloud based 3D map, and then identified objects within it as in [257] . The authors developed a shape-based method to build a 3D semantic map using point cloud data from an RGB-D camera. Data was segmented based on planes (horizontal/vertical), and an a-priori model library was used to identify objects and extract object features; this information was then used for wheelchair navigation. Another example can be found in [258] , where the authors developed a mapping-only framework based on indoor RGB-D data that created a triangle mesh for extracting and classifying planar regions as different furniture objects. The recognized objects were then replaced by their corresponding 3D CAD models following ICP alignment. Their system used OWL-DL (Web Ontology Language -Description Logic) and SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) as the ontology for defining object-property relations. [259] presented a hierarchical mapping approach based on detecting and clustering different objects while also considering their spatial relationships using a Bayesian classifier. For example, an office is considered to be constituted by \"work-space\", \"meeting-space\", and \"storagespace\", each of which are further composed of several objects.",

[279] presented a dense RGB-D SLAM system that segments the scene into different objects using either motion or semantic cues while tracking and reconstructing their 3D shape in real time. It allows objects to move freely by fusing its shape over time using only the pixels associated to that object label. Consequently it is able to deal with dynamic scenes without treating moving objects as outliers, as was the approach in much prior research. [280] presented MaskFusion, a real-time, object-aware RGB-D SLAM system that recognizes, segments, and assigns semantic labels to different objects, even if multiple objects are moving. The proposed system uses image-based, instance-level semantic segmentation to create an object-level semantic map, unlike the voxel-level representations used in prior work. More recently, [281] developed a novel framework for dense piece-wise semantic reconstruction of dynamic scenes using motion and spatial relations, where moving objects are handled by imposing constraints based on the spatial locations of neighboring superpixels.",

[282] represented indoor environment objects as cuboids for semantic mapping; the cuboid detection method is based on image segmentation and plane fitting, and the cuboid matching is based on features like emptiness, orientation, surface coverage, and distance from edges. [283] presented QuadricSLAM, a factor graph based SLAM system that uses dual quadrics to represent 3D landmarks, derived from 2D object detections obtained over multiple views. They proposed a new geometric error formulation while also addressing the challenges of object occlusions. Building on this work, [284] integrated additional planar and point constraints that help stabilise the SLAM estimate. Later, [285] explored how single view point cloud reconstructions of objects (via a CNN) can effectively constrain the shape of dual quadric landmarks. [286] developed a framework to detect and compactly represent changes in the environment. This is achieved though multi-scale sampling of point cloud data, change detection using Gaussian Mixture Models, a superquadrics-based representation of objects that caused the change, and final refinement and optimization. Other related research includes research on cuboids from [163] as well as basic primitives from [287] . 4) Scene Graphs at Environment Level: A dense grid representation of an image or an environment can be thought of as a specific case of a graph structure. We discussed the use of scene graphs previously at image level based on spatial relationships between various objects or regions observed in a single image. In a robotics context, the concept of a scene graph typically comprises spatial elements at an environment level which the robot explores over time. In this vein, a number of researchers have explored the use of scene graphs for better representation of the environment [200] , [203] , [288] [289] [290] [291] [292] , leading to improved spatial reasoning.",

Semantic Representations for SLAM and 3D Scene Understanding 1) SLAM with Semantic Segmentation: [297] proposed a semantically meaningful indoor mapping system based on the Manhattan World assumption, where photometric cues were combined with pose information and sparse point cloud data obtained from an underlying metric SLAM system. In a subsequent work [298] , the authors developed a more efficient approach based on dynamic programming to label the indoor environment as floor, wall or ceiling. Further extending the use of Manhattan world, [299] presented a joint inference procedure based on a Bayesian framework that combines photometric, stereo and 3D data to reason about floor and ceiling planes, and thus enable effective semantic scene understanding. Beyond reasoning at the surface level, researchers have also explored 3D structure-based semantic representations. [300] proposed a 3D occupancy map based on joint inference of 3D scene structure and semantic labels for outdoor monocular video data. They used a CRF model defined in 3D space and class-specific semantic cues to constrain the 3D structure in areas where multi-view constraints are weak. [301] described a process for transferring labels from 2D to 3D based on Bayesian updates and dense pairwise 3D CRFs for indoor RGB-D data, combined with a fast 2D semantic segmentation approach based on Randomized Decision Forests.

The pipeline proposed in [302] is based on random decision forests and probabilistic labeling using a Bayesian framework, and performs in real time or better on CPU and GPUs. [303] developed a scale-drift-aware, monocular semi-dense mapping system that can seamlessly switch between indoor and outdoor scenes where previous methods struggled. The system also saves computation time by enabling frame skipping for 2D segmentation, and through only considering keyframe connectivity and spatial consistency. [150] presented SemanticFusion, a dense semantic 3D mapping system for indoor RGB-D data where semantic predictions from a CNN are probabilistically fused from multiple viewpoints using ElasticFusion (Dense SLAM) [304] . The fusion technique also improves 2D semantic labeling performance over single frame predictions. The proposed system works in real time at 25 Hz. [305] combined CNN-based 2D semantic labeling with RNN-based data association (found using ElasticFusion [304] ) for dense semantic mapping on RGB-D indoor data. [306] presented a 3D scrolling occupancy grid map, achieving near real time performance, with relatively low memory and computational requirements and an upper bound as environment size scales. To achieve this, they used a novel hierarchical CRF model with CNN-based 2D segmentation to optimize 3D grid labels on top of a stereo ORB-SLAM based grid map, and used superpixels to enforce smoothness. [307] proposed semantic labeling of indoor RGB-D data based on an encoder-decoder type network with two branches, one each for RGB and Depth, which improved performance when combined together. They found that the \"HHA\" representation [308] of depth images -encoding Horizontal disparity, Height above ground, and the Angle the pixel's local surface normal makes with the inferred gravity direction -improved performance. Both sparse and dense fusion also improved performance. [309] used a CNN to predict semantic segmentation for RGB-D sequences. They trained the CNN to predict multi-view consistent semantics in a self-supervised way, enabling improved fusion at test time -enhancing [307] with multi-scale loss minimization. Their system performed better than single-view baselines. Kimera [197] is a real-time metric-semantic SLAM system that works in real-time and integrates 2D semantic segmentation, IMU measurements, and optional depth measurements into a dense semantically annotated mesh of the environment.",

Instead of clustering similar views, their method searched for the ideal view that best supported the correct semantic labeling of each face of the underlying 3D mesh. Their proposed single-image approach performed better than label fusing of multiple images, while also being more efficient.

            "text": "3) Dense Volumetric Representation and 3D CNNs: Wu et al. [322] proposed representing a 3D geometric shape on a 3D voxel grid and learnt a joint probabilistic distribution of binary variables on the grid using a Deep Belief Network (DBN) [330] . Distinct from their generative model aimed at shape reconstruction, Maturana and Scherer [317] presented VoxNet: a basic 3D CNN architecture designed for voxel grid representation of point clouds aimed at real-time 3D object detection, with an order of magnitude fewer trainable parameters than 3D ShapeNets [322] . [331] extended U-Net [105] to 3D U-Net to learn from sparsely annotated volumetric data, applied to biomedical data segmentation. Unlike the use of pre-segmented objects in [317] , [322] , [331] , Huang and You [48] extended the use of 3D CNNs using a LeNet [332] based architecture for semantic segmentation of raw point cloud data in outdoor scenes comprising a variety of semantic classes. 3D voxel representations used with 3D CNNs often lead to coarse semantic segmentation [48] , [333] , by assuming all the points within a voxel belong to the same object class. Addressing this problem, [334] proposed SEGCloud as an end-to-end framework, where coarse voxel predictions from a 3D Fully Convolutional CNN are transferred back to the raw 3D points via trilinear interpolation. Fine-grained semantics are then obtained from a global consistency constraint enforced by the Fully Connected Conditional Random Field. 4) Scene Completion and Semantic Segmentation: \"Semantic Scene Completion\" [335] refers to the joint learning task of scene completion and semantic segmentation, leading to enhanced understanding of the environment, particularly relevant to robotic exploration. Song et al. [335] used single-view depth map observations to produce a complete 3D voxel representation with semantic labels. They proposed SSCNet: an end-to-end 3D CNN that uses a dilation-based 3D context module to efficiently expand the receptive field and enable 3D context learning. Dai et al. [336] presented a 3D CNN for shape completion that encodes the global context using semantic class predictions from a 3D shape classifier. They used a patch-based 3D shape synthesis method to refine the predictions, by imposing 3D geometry from shapes retrieved from a prior database. In follow-up work, Dai et al. [337] designed a 3D CNN to process an incomplete 3D scan and predict a complete 3D model with per-voxel semantic labels. The proposed CNN is a fully-convolutional generative network, with filter kernels that are invariant to the overall scene size, enabling processing of large scenes with varying spatial extent. They also developed a coarse-to-fine inference strategy to produce high resolution output. 5) Sparse Volumetric Representation and 3D CNNs: One of the common challenges in dealing with 3D point cloud data is its non-uniform density, where certain regions of the scene may not have any information at all, or where existing information may not always be semantically informative. A uniform voxel grid therefore may not be the best way to represent the data. In this vein, [338] proposed OctNet, a 3D CNN suited to sparse 3D data, enabling efficient representation of high resolution input. Their method hierarchically partitioned the 3D voxel grid using a set of unbalanced octrees [339] where each leaf node stored a pooled feature representation, thus enabling effective allocation of memory and computation to the relevant dense regions. Sparse 3D convolutions have also been explored to avoid redundant computations [340] [341] [342] . [340] extended sparse 2D CNNs used for hand-writing recognition [343] to sparse 3D CNNs, based on the concept of performing convolutions only on the \"active\" spatial locations that do not differ from their \"ground state\". [341] presented Vote3Deep: a feature-centric voting mechanism [344] to perform sparse 3D convolutions by only considering non-zero feature locations. The use of ReLU [345] after a sparse convolutional layer also prevented the dilation of non-empty cells, thus achieving greater sparsity than [340] . [342] proposed Submanifold Sparse Convolutional Networks (SSCN) that fix the spatial locations of active sites to prevent the \"submanifold dilation problem\" [340] , keeping the sparsity unchanged for subsequent layers of the network. [346] proposed learning high dimensional linear filters for sparse feature spaces using permutohedral lattices, and demonstrated learning the kernel parameters for a general bilateral convolution in semantic segmentation. [347] presented the Field Probing Neural Network (FPNN) that employs field probing filters to efficiently extract features from volumetric distance fields, learning the weights and locations of the probing points that compose the filter. In order to obtain a semantically informative map, [314] proposed using semantic segmentation to remove redundancy and noise from dense 3D point clouds attributed to planar surfaces like ground and walls. They developed a variety of point cloud simplification techniques that employed global and local region statistics to selectively decimate 3D points, while mostly preserving those near intra-class edges and discontinuities.",

To mitigate these issues, an alternative approach processes multiple 2D views generated from the 3D point cloud [348] and then projects them from 2D back to 3D [47] , [49] . [348] presented a Multi-View CNN (MVCNN) to learn shape recognition from 2D renderings of a 3D point cloud, demonstrating that even a single 2D view based prediction could outperform 3D CNNs based on volumetric representation [322] . [47] projected the point cloud onto a set of synthetic 2D images which are fed to a 2D CNN for semantic segmentation, and then re-projected this to the point cloud. Benefiting from the abundance of 2D labeled data and a multi-stream fusion of color, depth and surface normals, their method achieved superior performance to comparable baselines. [49] proposed to sample multiple 2D image views of a point cloud using random and multi-scale sampling strategies. They employed both RGB and depth-based views for 2D pixel-wise semantic labeling, with labels efficiently back-projected via buffering. [349] explored \"tangent convolutions\" with an emphasis on leveraging 2D surface information from 3D point clouds, by projecting local surface geometry on a tangent plane around every point to obtain a set of tangent images.",

            "text": "7) Unstructured Points Based Representations: While volumetric representations present the environment in a structured manner, handling point cloud data as a set of unordered and unstructured points has proven to also be a viable approach. [46] presented PointNet, a novel deep network that processes points sets without voxelization or rendering and learns both global and local features. Demonstrated to be efficient on tasks like object classification, part segmentation, and scene semantic parsing (dense semantic mapping), PointNet works on an unordered set of points exhibiting permutation-invariance, unlike ordered 2D image data or a 3D volumetric grid, while also being robust to input perturbation and corruption. [351] proposed PointNet++, a hierarchical NN that applies PointNet recursively on a nested partitioning of the input point set, enabling learning of local features with increasing contextual scales. With the ability to capture local structures induced by the metric space of points, PointNet++ demonstrated improvement on semantic segmentation of single-view 3D point clouds. [352] explored direct semantic segmentation of unordered point clouds by extending PointNet [46] , particularly enlarging its receptive field over a large 3D scene to incorporate larger-scale spatial context at both input and output level. Building on point-level representations, significant research has focused on developing learning algorithms based on characteristics like unordered structure, intra-point interaction and transformation-invariance [15] , for example, by using Point-wise convolutions [353] , [354] , Recurrent Neural Networks [355] , [356] , Graph Neural Networks [357] , [358] and Autoencoders [359] , [360] .",

[361] proposed an Edge-Conditioned Convolution (ECC) to learn from the local neighborhood of the point cloud represented as a graph, where filter weights were dynamically generated for each specific input sample. [362] designed a 3D Graph neural network that builds a k-nearest neighbor graph on top of 3D point clouds, where each node in the graph corresponds to a set of points represented by appearance features extracted by a unary CNN from 2D images. This approach consequently was able to leverage both 2D appearance and 3D geometric relationships. The method is capable of extracting long range dependencies within imagestypically difficult to model in traditional techniques. Inspired from superpixels [158] , [364] introduced SuperPoint Graphs (SPG) where nodes represent simple shapes, and edges encode contextual relationships between object parts, enabling semantic segmentation of large-scale point clouds. [350] proposed Kd-Net for parsing 3D point clouds, using a kd-tree structure [365] to form the computational graph, and hierarchical representations where the root node is recursively computed from representations of its children. Addressing the lack of overlapping receptive fields in Kd-Net, [366] presented SO-Net based on the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) [367] , where the receptive field overlap is controlled by performing point-to-node knearest neighbor (kNN) search on the SOM, enabling a better representation of the underlying spatial distribution of point clouds.",

This has led to numerous novel approaches, for example, ShapeNet [322] , VoxNet [317] , OctNet [338] , PointNet [46] , tangent convolutions [349] , SSCN [342] and Kd-Net [350] , which have pushed the boundaries of 3D scene understanding. Although capable of processing information at an environment level -beyond what can be achieved through a single image, these methods do not typically consider incremental scene understanding. In the near future, bridging the advances in 3D point cloud processing and 3D reconstruction capabilities of modern SLAM techniques will significantly benefit robots in semantic scene understanding.",

This same story also played out to some extent in robotics research focused on enriching the interactions of robots with the world around them, and with the humans who occupy that world.

In mixing freely with humans in the environment, robots will also need to understand humans; perhaps not initially at a deep cognitive level, but at least in terms of recognizing what humans are doing -their actions -in order to inform the robot's potential interactions with humans. The following sections survey the state of robotics research into semantics for enhancing the capability of robots to understand and interact with the world around them. We first discuss the literature in the context of \"perception of interaction\" which covers the works related to understanding of different actions and activities performed by humans, and the use of hands and arms to interact with objects. Then, we discuss \"perception for interaction\" covering the use of perception to interact with the objects or humans around a robot, including research related to interaction with objects (affordances, manipulation and grasping), performing higher-level tasks, interacting with humans and other robots and finally, navigation based on vision and language.",

Moving beyond just classification, localization of specific activities within a long video sequence involves identifying both the temporal and spatial location of each activity, often in so-called \"action tubes\" [377] .

In some cases the temporal aspect of an action is modeled through dense trajectory features [380] , which track the movement of keypoints through time. A sequence of atomic action units or \"Actoms\" [381] can also be used to represent a semantically-consistent action sequence as opposed to learning its discriminative parts. [382] show that a complex activity composed of several short actions is better represented and compared using a hierarchy of motion decomposition. The two-streams approach [372] separates appearance and motion (optical flow). A rank-pooling method developed by Fernando and colleagues [383] [384] [385] encodes frame order as a function of the frame's appearance. An efficient first-order approximation of rank-pooling, known as Dynamic Images [386] , has been applied successfully in many deep learning approaches for activity classification. However, even Carreira and Zisserman [376] , who ask the question \"Quo Vadis, Action Recognition?\" 1 , do not fully consider a more fine-grained understanding of human actions (e.g. different types 1 Where are you going action recognition? of swimming) likely necessary for robotic applications. Robots are likely to require not just classification of the activity being performed, but also localization of both the person performing the activity and the object being interacted with (if any).",

In one of the early applications of the concept in robotics, [405] presents a robot that learns the roll-ability of four different objects by \"playing\" with them and observing the changes in the environment; however the generalization of this affordance to novel objects and affordances is not studied. In order to formalize the concept of affordances in the context of autonomous robotics, [406] reviews the usage of affordances in other fields, and proposes a framework based on relation instances of the form (effect, (entity, behavior)) which are acquired through the interaction of the agent with its environment. [407] implements this framework for a mobile robot, enabling goal-oriented navigation by learning the affordances of its environment through the effects of primitive behaviours such as \"traverse\" or \"approach\".",

Closely related to the formalization of affordances above, the Object-Action Complexes (OACs) concept [408] attaches the performed actions to the objects as attributes and provides grounded abstractions for sensory-motor processes. By defining affordances as state transition functions, OACs allow for forward prediction and planning. Several researchers have studied deriving such attributes from visual information [409] [410] [411] [412] . The Semantic Event Chain (SEC) framework developed by [409] analyzes the sequence of changes of the spatial relations between the objects that are being manipulated by a human or a robot. This approach generates a transition matrix which encodes topological variations in a sequence graph of image segments during the manipulation event, allowing transfer of manipulation actions from human demonstration to a robotic arm. [410] designed an architecture for generic definition of a robot's human-like manipulation actions. Manipulations are defined using 3 levels: a top level, which abstractly defines objects and their relations and actions; a mid level, which defines chaining of action primitives via SEC; and a bottom level that defines sensory data collection and communication with the robot control system.",

More general methods work with familiar objects; those which are semantically or geometrically similar to objects previously seen, and are able to generalise grasps across instances of an object's class (for example mugs) [425] , [426] or object parts [427] , [428] (for example handles) [429] . Song et al. [430] present a hybrid grasp detection pipeline for familiar objects that fuses local grasp estimates based on depth data with global information from a continuous category-level pose estimation process, which is able to overcome the limitations of both approaches individually. Rather than rely on object models, Manuelli et al. [431] define grasping and manipulation actions by learning semantic 3D keypoints from visual inputs that generalise across novel instances of an object class, making them more robust to intra-category shape variation.",

A common successful approach in the Amazon Robotics Challenge was to use an object-agnostic grasp detection algorithm in parallel with a standalone semantic segmentation system [438] [439] [440] . Rather than use two separate streams, other approaches use joint representations of objectspecific grasp detection. Guo et al. [441] train a CNN to recognise the most exposed object in a cluttered scene while simultaneously regressing the best grasp pose for the detected object. This joint model outperformed a system comprising two models trained individually on object and grasp detection. [442] improve this idea by using a two-stream attention-based network that learns object detection, classification, and grasp planning endto-end. The two streams, ventral and dorsal, perform object recognition and geometric-relationship interpretation respectively, and outperform a single-stream model on the same task.",

They use CNN-based semantics to classify image regions that are compatible and incompatible with a task in combination with a geometric grasp model.

For humanoids, [287] used RGB-D data to build representations of the environment from geometric primitives like planes, cylinders and spheres. This information is used to extract the affordances of objects, such as their \"pushability\" and \"liftability\", as well as full-body capabilities such as support, lean, grasp and hold. [290] extends the work in [287] with semantic object information, such as chair or window, and uses spatio-temporal fusion of multiple geometric primitives (using a spatial scene graph representation) to identify higher level semantic structures in the scene.",

Given a task, this approach is able to answer queries such as \"Which horizontal surfaces are likely to be counters?\" by processing knowledge built during mapping. [453] present an interactive labeling system, where human users can manually label semantic features, such as walls and tables, and static objects, such as door signs. These labels can then be used to define navigation goals such as \"go to the kitchen\", or for specialized behaviour such as for passing doors. [454] presents a goal-inferring approach that detects deviations from operational norms using semantic knowledge. For instance, if the robot \"knows\" that perishable items must be kept in a refrigerator, and observes a bottle of milk on a table, the robot will generate the goal to bring that bottle into a refrigerator.",

[455] studies tool affordances through self-exploration based on their geometry -how the tool is grasped. In particular, they study the dragging action, parameterized by the angle of the drag, with the effect measured as the object displacement. In more recent work, Fang et al. [456] address task-oriented grasping from the point of view of tool usage, where a robot must grasp an object in a way which allows it to complete a task. For example, the best way to grasp a pair of scissors differs depending on the task: transporting the scissors may require a different, safer grasp to using them to cut a piece of paper. Their approach uses self-supervised learning in simulation to jointly learn grasping and manipulation policies that are then transferred to novel tools in the real world. 4) Semantics for Human-Robot and Robot-Robot Interaction: Semantics play a crucial rule in human-robot interaction, in particular for collaborative task execution which goes beyond the human-command-robot-execute model. This is achieved using inverse semantics, introduced by Tellex et al. [457] , to enable the robot to generate help requests (for an assembly task) for robots in natural language, by emulating the ability of humans to interpret requests. Inverse semantics involved using a Generalized Grounding Graph (G 3 ) framework [458] for the task and using models based on both the environment and the listener. Gong and Zhang [459] proposed temporal spatial inverse semantics to enable a robot to communicate with humans by extending the natural language sentence structure that can refer to previous states of the environment, for example, \"Please pick up the cup beside the oven that was on the dining table\". They used the G3 framework for mapping between natural language and groundings in an environment, and evaluated their method through randomly generated scenarios in simulation.",

This is achieved through language games that enable the robots to develop a shared lexicon to refer to places, distances, and directions based on their cognitive maps, and was demonstrated on real robots. Another example of robot-robot interaction is the computational model of perspective-taking introduced by Fischer and Demiris [474] . There, one robot assumes the viewpoint of another robot to understand what that other robot can perceive from this point of view. Such a perspective-taking ability has previously been shown to be of advantage in human-robot interactions [475] , [476] . 5) Vision-and-Language Navigation: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a task where an agent attempts to navigate to a goal location in a 3D simulator when given detailed natural language instructions. Anderson et al. presented the first VLN task and dataset in [477] . Numerous methods have been proposed to address the VLN problem. Most of them employ the CNN-LSTM architecture, with an attention mechanism to first encode instructions and then decode the embedding to a series of actions. Together with the proposing of the VLN task, Anderson et al. [477] developed the teacher-forcing and student-forcing training strategy. The former equips the network with a basic ability for navigating using ground truth action at each step, while the latter mimics the test scenarios, where the agent may predict wrong actions, by sampling actions instead of using ground truth actions.",

[478] developed a speaker model to synthesize new instructions for randomly selected robot trajectories. Other methods of increasing the training data available have also been proposed: Tan et al. [479] augment the training data by removing objects from the original training data to generate new unseen environments. To further enhance the generalization ability, they also train the model using both imitation learning and reinforcement learning, so as to take advantage of both off-policy and on-policy optimization. Predicting future actions is a key component of many approaches, but not all chunks of an instruction are useful for predicting this next action. Ma et al. [480] use a progress monitor to locate the completed sub-instructions and to focus on those which have the most utility in predicting the next action. Another way to improve navigation success is to equip the agent with backtracking. In [481] , Ma et al. propose treating the navigation process as a graph search problem and predict whether to move forward or roll back to a previous viewpoint. In [482] , each passed viewpoint is viewed as a goal candidate, and the final decision is the viewpoint with the highest local and global matching score. Most recently, Qi et al. [483] presented a dataset of varied and complex robot tasks, described in natural language, in terms of objects visible in a large set of real images. Given an instruction, success requires navigating through a previously-unseen environment to identify an object. This represents a practical challenge, but one that closely reflects one of the core visual problems in robotics.",

In a SLAM system performing mapping, the act of recognizing a familiar location is called \"closing the loop\" or \"loop closure\".

At one extreme, time of day, weather fluctuations and even momentary lighting changes contribute towards intra-day appearance changes. Longer-term factors such as seasons, vegetation growth, and climate change also lead to appearance variability. A significant additional contributor to appearance variations are human activities, such as construction work, general wear and tear, updating of signage/billboards/fa\u00e7ades including increased digital signage, and abrupt changes to traffic flow. Compared to natural causes of appearance variability, the changes caused by human activities can be far less \"cyclical\" or predictable.",

Compared to the majority of research in VPR that has so far considered static datasets (though with significant appearance variations within the datasets), lifelong VPR is an under-investigated area. To handle continuous appearance changes, some approaches attempt to extract the \"semantic essence\" of a place that is independent of appearance, and to transfer the appearance of the place seen in a particular condition to unseen conditions [512] [513] [514] . To date, such methods have primarily been demonstrated on natural variations such as time of day and seasons. Another paradigm continuously accumulates data to refine the system [515] [516] [517] . The practicality of such approaches depend on the ability to continuously collect data from the target environment at high frequency (e.g. weekly), which can be achieved using deliberate recording schemes (e.g. mapping vehicles [518] , taxi fleets [519] , [520] ) or opportunistic and crowd-sourced schemes such as useruploaded videos [521] or webcams [522] . The fundamental challenge arises from the perpetually growing database, which demands a VPR algorithm that is scalable; the computational effort for inference and continuous refinement of the VPR system must grow slowly or not at all with the database size.",

These non-uniform appearance variations are often caused by weather, time of day and season cycles. [524] presented an appearance-invariant localization system based on a 3D model of semantically-labeled points and curves, which were projected onto a single query image to minimize error for pose estimation. [525] proposed a temporal place segmentation approach based on semantic place categories [58] to improve VPR [526] under significant appearance variations occurring both within and across the traverses. [527] developed a method to learn salient image descriptions based on regions of the image which are geometrically stable over large time gaps (across seasons and weather changes).

[528] explored a cross-view geo-localization approach that used SVMs to learn relationships among image triplets: ground level image, its corresponding aerial image and a land cover attribute map. More recently, [200] presented a localization system for cross-view matching where aerial images were captured using UAVs.

            "text": "3) Semantics within High-Level Representations: In this subsection, we discuss the use of image representations that capture shapes and patterns at a higher abstraction level, which may not be strictly semantically meaningful to humans. To some extent, this can be attributed to feature extraction from higher-order layers of CNNs and methods like Edge Boxes [533] that provide a \"semantically-aware\" representation of whole images or image regions. [534] explored the use of Edge Boxes to detect and represent \"ConvNet Landmarks\" for visual place recognition. [535] represented the environment using a co-visibility graph of semantic image patches [533] , where an edge was established only if patches were observed in the same image, unlike the common notation of edges as spatial relationships. [536] presented Semantically-Aware Attentive Neural Embeddings (SAANE) that fused appearance features and higher-order layers of the CNN to learn embeddings for matching places under a wide variety of environmental conditions. [537] demonstrated that the higher-order layers of CNNs encoded semantic information about a place, which can be utilized for partitioning the descriptor search space. [538] showed that the fully-connected layers of a place categorization CNN, being semantics-aware, exhibited viewpoint-invariance and hence enabled place matching from opposing viewpoints, even with the additional challenge of significant appearance variations. The use of additional modalities like pixel-wise depth for visual place recognition has also been explored in the past [539] [540] [541] [542] [543] [544] [545] , where meaningful representations in the form of surfaces [539] , planes [546] , and lines [540] , [545] have been shown to improve VPR performance. [547] proposed FGSN (Fine-grained Segmentation Networks) based on k-means clustering of CNN embeddings for self-supervised pixel labeling and 2D-2D point correspondence. They showed that fine-grained clustering, even though non-semantic, is more suitable for visual localization than methods based on a limited number of semantic classes, for example, the 19 in Cityscapes [112] and 66 in the Vistas [548] dataset. However, it was also observed that pre-training on semantic segmentation networks improved performance significantly, suggesting semantics would still play a key, albeit different, role.",

            "text": "3) Cost: As a cost-effective alternative to a LiDAR-based 3D point cloud, Pseudo-LiDAR [567] has been proposed to represent pixel depth estimated using stereo cameras as a 3D point cloud, leading to a significant performance improvement for 3D object detection. In a subsequent work, the authors presented Pseudo-LiDAR++ [568] to improve depth estimation of faraway objects while also incorporating a depth signal from cheaper LiDAR sensors that typically have sparse 3D coverage. [569] extended the concept of Pseudo-LiDAR to monocular systems, while also addressing the numerical and computational bottleneck of the dense Pseudo-LiDAR point cloud. Recently, Qian et al. [570] developed an end-to-end Pseudo-LiDAR framework based on differentiable Change of Representation (CoR) modules to further improve detection accuracy. 4) Uncertainty Estimation: Uncertainty estimation is essential for semantic understanding and decision making during mapping and interaction. Current approaches for uncertainty estimation include approximations of Bayesian deep learning [571] such as dropout sampling [572] , deep ensemble methods [573] and the recently proposed Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG) [574] . For object detection, Monte Carlo Dropout Sampling was used in [575] to measure label uncertainty. Other works proposed estimating the uncertainty in detecting the location of the object in the image, introducing the probabilistic bounding box [576] . In [577] , an alternative representation of probabilistic bounding boxes was introduced through the spatial distribution of a generative bounding box model. In [578] , probabilistic bounding boxes were generated by replacing the standard nonmaximum suppression (NMS) step in the object detector by a Bayesian inference step, allowing the detector to retain all predicted information for both the bounding box and the category of a detected object instance.",

Towards this goal, [583] developed a multi-modal semantic space labeling system leveraging information from camera, laser scanner, and wheel odometry sensors. This work was further extended in [584] to incorporate high-level information as \"properties\" of a place, defined in terms of shape, size, appearance, and doorway (binary). While using multiple modalities, authors in [585] concluded that although combining features from depth and color drastically reduce uncertainty, depth information contributes more to the performance due to inherent illumination-invariance. For synchronized multiple modalities, [586] proposed a Local N-ary Patterns (LNP) descriptor to describe relationships among neighboring pixels of reflectance and depth images, as an extension of the Local Binary Pattern descriptor [587] . As a general framework for semantic place categorization using any sensor modality, [249] demonstrated the superiority of DBMM (Dynamic Bayesian Mixture Models) based temporal inference over a commonly used SVM approach.",

The complementary properties of the modalities can be harnessed via multi-modal fusion. Recently, Feng et al. [589] reviewed the state-of-the-art deep learning based approaches for object detection and semantic segmentation that employ multi-modal fusion, particularly exploring the answers to the \"what, when and how to fuse\" questions. Chen et al. [590] proposed a 3D object proposal method using stereo cameras, posing it as an energy minimization problem exploiting object size priors and depth-informed features like height above the ground plane, free space and point cloud density. In subsequent work [591] , the authors presented the MV3D (Multi-View 3D) object detection network, which combines RGB images and a LiDAR's front and Bird's-Eye Views (BEV) to enable effective multi-modal fusion based on interactions between different layers of the network. A similar multi-modal fusion is proposed in [592] , dubbed AVOD (Aggregate View Object Detection), with a novel use of high-resolution feature maps, 1 \u00d7 1 convolutions and a look-up table for 3D anchor projections, achieving real-time and memoryefficient high detection performance. Vora et al. [593] presented PointPainting as a way to \"decorate\" the LiDAR point cloud with the semantic segmentation output of color images for improved 3D object detection, addressing the limitations of previous fusion concepts that led to \"feature blurring\" [594] , [595] and limited maximum recall [596] [597] [598] .",

[599] proposed place classification of geographical locations based on individual demographics, timing of visits, and nearby businesses using government diary data. The demographic and temporal features of individual visits included age, gender, arrival and departure details and season. The place categories included home, work, restaurant, library, place of worship and recreation. [600] extended this work by also considering additional cues like sequential information in the form of the periodicity of the individual visits, cross labels extracted from multiple visits to the same place, travel distance, and place co-occurrences. [601] presented a semantic place classification system using GPS trajectories of users. Their method is based on visit-level features including day of week, time of day, duration, and response rate, which were then used to infer place-level features.

However, the same is not true for UAVs. [630] recently presented a UAV object detection and tracking benchmark that particularly highlights the contrast between the challenges of vision research for UAVs versus UGVs. The primary differences occur due to variations in object density per frame, relative sizes of observed objects, viewpoint, motion and real-time requirements. To further the research efforts in this domain, [631] released a benchmark challenge VisDrone2018 for object detection and tracking with 2.5 million annotated instances of objects within 180K video frames. [632] presented UAVid, an urban street scene segmentation dataset, particularly aimed at high-resolution slanted views from low-altitude flights, in contrast to the more common top view-based datasets [633] [634] [635] [636] . In a similar vein, [637] released AeroScapes, an aerial-view dataset of 3269 images with dense semantic annotation, captured using a fleet of drones. The scarcity of labeled data has also motivated researchers to explore alternative ways to utilize the existing data and approaches to semantic scene understanding. The authors in [637] used an ensemble approach to semantic segmentation of aerial drone imagery, based on knowledge transfer via progressive fine-tuning through different source domains. Similarly, [638] explored the use of GANs [639] for unsupervised domain adaptation to improve cross-domain semantic segmentation in aerial imagery.",

Similarly, natural environments that are prone to disasters like volcanic eruptions, forest fires or landslides can be better accessed by UAVs, which can aid in detecting and assessing such situations [641] . Nature conservation and wildlife management are also key areas where UAVs can offer a significant practical advantage over other platforms. [642] presented a nature conservation drone that detects, tracks and counts various animals in the wild. Extending this idea to the use of multiple devices, [643] developed a software platform that enables the use of different multirotors for cattle detection and management, mitigating the need to attach GPS devices to animals. [644] developed Systematic POacher deTector (SPOT) based on drones to spot poachers at night time. Beyond natural environments, UAVs have also been employed in the construction industry for site management and control [645] . Another distinct application area for UAVs is last mile delivery, which is already well on its way from research to commercial deployment [646] . As both the end-task and operating environment vary widely, the use of multiple sensors beyond just RGB cameras to achieve the objective is common, for example, the use of thermal cameras [640] , [644] and LiDAR [647] .",

Driven in significant part by advances in the field of deep learning, autonomous navigation is a topic of active exploration in the context of drones and UAVs, especially enabling end-to-end autonomous navigation. [648] proposed Collision Avoidance via Deep Reinforcement Learning (CAD 2 RL) where training is done only using simulated 3D CAD models, demonstrating generalization to real indoor flights. [649] developed DroNet that takes as an input a monocular image and outputs the steering angle along with a collision probability. Distinct from [648] and other methods that use synthetic data for training, [649] explored the use of ground vehicle driving data from city streets and demonstrated generalization to variations in viewpoint (from high altitude flights) and types of environment (parking lots and corridors). This study in particular shows that there are underlying meaningful semantic concepts that are not specific to a robotic platform or operational domain.",

Apart from a completely end-to-end pipeline, modular approaches have also been explored where perception and control are handled separately [651] [652] [653] . Similarly, [654] demonstrated autonomous navigation for a racing drone via sim-to-real transfer of its CNN training for predicting goal direction using data generated from domain randomization.

This is typically achieved by using multiple sensors and performing tasks in a modular fashion. [685] proposed a multi-sensor based human detection and tracking system and demonstrated its portability on different robotic platforms using a Pioneer and Scitos robot. [625] presented a tea-serving application using P3DX robot in an office environment, where an overall environment awareness was achieved by developing individual competencies in isolation like line following, obstacle avoidance, empty tray detection, approaching-hand detection and person following. Recently, aiming for precision agriculture, [686] presented an intelligent pesticide spraying robot that semantically segments the fruit trees that require spraying. Using semantic reasoning, perception, control and interaction abilities can be further improved. [257] demonstrated smart wheelchair navigation using semantic maps, emphasizing enhanced safety, comfort, and obedience due to the use of semantics. [462] presented a semantically-grounded learning-from-demonstration approach for a furniture assembly task using a PR2. [461] developed a semantic-reasoning based method for interpretation of voice commands for improved interaction between a service robot and humans. [394] , [397] , [399] demonstrated the use of semantic representations for human/robot activity understanding using humanoid and industrial robots. More recently, [687] proposed Semantic Linking Maps (SLiM) that exploit common spatial relations between objects to actively search for an object based on probabilistic semantic reasoning.",

The authors also discussed the methods and challenges of background subtraction, often the first step in the process, particularly when tracking a moving object under challenging conditions like those posed by a marine environment. [700] presented the applications and challenges of visual surveillance of human activities. The authors covered a wide range of uncontrolled environment scenarios: traffic flow monitoring [701] , detecting traffic incidents [702] and anomalies [692] , vehicle parking management [703] , safety operations at public places like train stations [704] and airports [705] , maritime administration [706] and retail store monitoring [707] . As with the natural environments, monitoring human activities in man-made environments also poses similar challenges including background subtraction when tracking a moving object.

The current solutions tend to address challenges that are often specific to the operating environment and the type of object being tracked. A more generalizable solution would require semantic scene understanding which can either be inferred from the observed scene or through the use of knowledge databases. With semantic reasoning, the fundamental task of detecting and tracking an entity of interest can likely be performed in a more robust and generalized manner. 4) Autonomous Vehicles: Industry has been largely responsible for increased research activity in the autonomous vehicle space, as evidenced by an increasing number of surveys and reviews dedicated to autonomous driving. Autonomous driving is a great test case for semantics, because it has rapidly become clear that classical robotics techniques, like SLAM, are clearly insufficient by themselves for enabling autonomous driving, and that a richer understanding of the environment is almost certainly required.",

For example, detecting a \"stop sign\" may not be trivial due to occlusions, weather and lighting conditions, infrastructural variations, special sub-categories and temporary road blocks where humans carry the stop signs [726] , [727] . One of the practical solutions to such object recognition problems is active learning where approximate detectors can be used to automatically sample more data for less confident predictions, especially under a map-vision disagreement, to train better classifiers or handle special cases, as adopted by Tesla, Inc. [726] . The Tesla talk [726] also highlights how general evaluation methods are supplemented by curated unit tests for measuring the scene understanding capability of an autonomous car before deploying an updated solution. Furthermore, semantic scene understanding for autonomous driving is at times limited by differences in road infrastructure and traffic rules across different geographies, for example, left-versus right-lane driving and differences in positioning of traffic lights near intersections. Therefore, learning general trends via deep learning often needs to be complemented by incorporating prior knowledge in the algorithm implementation and sensor specification [728] .",

Semantic mapping, particularly suited to autonomous driving on roads, is being explored at deeper levels involving lane detection in complex scenarios [747] , road centerline detection [748] , [749] , lane boundary estimation [750] , complex lane topology estimation [196] , drivable road boundary extraction [751] , crosswalk drawing [752] , and aerial view-based road network estimation [753] . Recent research has also demonstrated that using semantic maps can improve performance at tasks like object detection [754] and localization [755] .",

            "text": "Autonomous driving is a challenging task and one that is likely to rely heavily on vehicles having a deep and accurate understanding of how the world around them functions. As research in this field continues it will be interesting to see how far progress is made adopting a road-driving-specific focus, versus a broader understanding of the world, and how many of the insights gained are then relevant to other robotic domains like service robotics and drones. Will semantic advances for autonomous vehicles provide the final piece of the puzzle to safely and widely deployable highly autonomous on-road vehicles? And will these advances be of high relevance to other robotic domains, or will there be domain-specific aspects of how semantics are learnt and used? 5) Civilian applications: A number of vision and robotics based solutions have been developed with primary applications in civilian society. This includes visual surveillance, robotic search and rescue operations, social interactions, and disaster management. Beyond static surveillance, discussed in the Subsection VI-A.3, visual surveillance based on moving cameras is also becoming more common [756] . This not only increases the scope of surveillance applications but is also now more feasible due to the availability of better hardware and software technologies. This includes body-worn cameras of police or defence personnel [757] and crowd monitoring using drones or ground robots. The advanced sensing capability and maneuverability along with low cost and size makes UAVs a great choice for a standalone surveillance system [758] , although their effect on privacy and civil liberty remains an active topic of discussion [759] . Visual surveillance using UAVs has been explored in various contexts including change detection [760] , scene classification for disaster detection [641] , construction site management [645] , and border patrol [761] . Similarly, ground robots (UGVs) have also been used for indoor [762] and outdoor surveillance [763] . [756] highlighted some of the key challenges of visual surveillance based on moving cameras, including dealing with abrupt motion variations, occlusions, power and compute time constraints and increased background complexity.",

            "text": "Apart from surveillance, another important class of civilian applications is in disaster and crisis management. [764] reviewed the use of robots in this context. A recent example is the last mile delivery operations run by Starship Technologies [627] during the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, airborne deliveries by Wing [646] and other such platforms can help in providing critical supplies during floods, landslides or bushfires, where ground accessibility is poor or non-existent. For operation in disaster situations, remote teleoperation is still a primary control mechanism -thus mitigating its corresponding challenges is also important. In this vein, [765] explored the use of arbitrary viewpoints to mitigate blind spots for improved teleoperation of a mobile robot. Beyond vision-based sensing, [766] used ARMatron, a wearable glove as a gesture recognition and control device to better communicate with a remote robot. Furthermore, disaster management scenarios also require better communication protocols for robots to avoid system failure. For example, a robot-drone-fog device team may communicate by creating an ad-hoc network in a search and rescue mission [767] . Finally, sensor fusion is also a critical requirement for many such tasks, as demonstrated by [768] for robot-assisted victim search.",

            "text": "The end goals for most robotic applications require both detection and action processes to work in tandem. Robots need to have robust means of understanding their environment, and that understanding has to be consistently verified as the robot acts. As also discussed previously, situational awareness can be attained by semantic reasoning [662] , [663] . Furthermore, semantic understanding of the robot's surroundings also enhances the possibilities for interacting with those surroundings, including with humans. 6) Augmented Reality: Over the past decade, Augmented Reality (AR) applications have become a relatively common phenomenon. Augmented reality is also highly relevant to robotics and covered here because many of the capabilities -such as localization -are shared across both areas, and both rely on an enhanced understanding of the environment that moves beyond simple geometry. [769] recently reviewed AR in depth, covering its various components ranging from tracking and display technologies to design, interaction, and evaluation methods, while also highlighting future research directions. Other recent surveys and reviews include a summary of major milestones in mobile AR since 1968 [770] ; opportunities and challenges facing AR [771] , [772] ; AR trends in education [773] and browsing [774] ; AR in the medical area including developments and challenges [775] , radiotherapy [776] , image-guided surgery [777] , neurosurgery [778] , endoscopic sugery [779] , laproscopic surgery [780] , and health education [781] , [782] ; and general trends in AR research spanning from 2008 to 2018 [783] , following a previous decade-span survey [784] and other older surveys [785] , [786] . As noted in [769] , earlier attempts at developing an AR prototype date back to 1968 [787] and the current widespread use can be be witnessed in games, education and the marketing industry. While some of the initial work in the field of AR had been primarily based on sensors like gyroscopes, GPS, and magnetic compasses [788] [789] [790] [791] [792] [793] [794] , vision-based localization has gradually become one of the key areas of research focus, in order to achieve high accuracy and a more immersive experience [795] [796] [797] [798] [799] [800] .",

Real-time dense visual SLAM methods, for example, KinectFusion [216] , [801] paved the way for accurate surface-based reconstruction, enabling more immersive AR experiences in real-time. Doing away with non-parametric representations [216] by instead using semantics in the form of known 3D object models, SLAM++ [198] demonstrated a context-aware AR application using an object-based SLAM pipeline, where virtual characters completed the task of path finding, obstacle avoidance, and sitting on real-world chairs. In subsequent work [802] , the authors developed a real-time dense planar SLAM system and demonstrated its use in augmenting planar surfaces, for example, replacing carpets and styles on the floor and overlaying a Facebook \"wall\" web page on a real wall. Further to that work, [803] proposed ElasticFusion: a surfels-based map-centric approach to real-time dense visual SLAM and light source detection, leading to a more realistic augmented reality rendering.",

In medical procedures, this task is difficult due to a limited field-of-view vision, rapid motion, organ deformation, lack of sufficient texture, occlusion, clutter, and the inability to add artificial markers.

Notably, GPUs continue to advance, with recent hardware changes being increasingly focused on facilitating deep learning and related techniques, rather than just catering to the traditional consumer gaming, media production and modelling users. Key performance properties relevant to deep learning include memory bandwidth, total memory capacity, clock frequency, and architectural considerations that improve typical operations like inference. All these properties continue to advance rapidly from year to year. [8] highlighted the gap between the performance requirements of embodied devices and their practical constraints, indicating the need for co-design of algorithms, processors and sensors. The high compute requirements of visual SLAM and 3D reconstruction algorithms often make extensive evaluation difficult, especially for typical university research labs, so evaluation is often limited to qualitative visualizations and accuracy estimation on a few datasets. This trend deters the uncovering of design choices at algorithm level that could potentially lead to better tradeoffs between accuracy, compute time, power consumption and the quality of output. Hence, better design space exploration strategies are continuously being explored that involve both hardware and software, particularly taking into account the latter's low-level design [825] [826] [827] [828] [829] .",

Neuromorphic vision chips have been discussed in detail in [844] and more recently in [845] , where the latter discussed both frame-driven and event-driven vision chips. [846] comprehensively reviewed the neuromorphic computers, devices and model architectures that at some level model neuroscience to solve challenging machine learning problems. Neuromorphic computing provides opportunities to implement neural networks-based applications, particularly those based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), directly in the hardware, thus offering significant advantages in terms of power, compute time and storage footprint. This hardware is typically implemented as FPGAs [847] or an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) [848] . Robotic applications, especially those requiring autonomous navigation competencies, have been explored with the use of spiking neural networks [849] [850] [851] [852] . Furthermore, existing CNNs can be converted into SNNs and mapped to spike-based hardware architectures while retaining their original accuracy levels, as demonstrated on the object recognition task in [853] [854] [855] .

The recent focus has also been on creating equivalent benchmark datasets for 3D semantic scene understanding. In Table I , we list a sampling of datasets that are targeted at enabling semantic understanding by solving diverse tasks, for example, object detection in 2D [548] , [856] and 3D [519] , [857] , semantic segmentation in 2D [112] and 3D [135] , [858] , semantic place categorization [59] , robotic manipulation [411] , road semantics [749] , multi-spectral semantics [139] , UAVview semantics [637] , 3D object shapes [322] , multi-object tracking [716] , pedestrian intention prediction [738] , pedestrian locomotion forecasting [859] , collision-free space detection (drivable vs non-drivable) [860] , Near-InfraRed segmentation [861] , and semantic mapping [862] . This list of datasets is by no means comprehensive, and more details can be found in recent dataset review articles [22] , [589] , [721] , [863] and online [864] , although any single source does not provide a complete list, emphasizing the disconnect between the use of semantics for different tasks and applications. Table I mainly highlights the diversity in semantic understanding tasks, which are typically related to each other but often evaluated in isolation.

            "text": "The use of knowledge representation and ontology has been explored in semantic mapping for robots. [891] proposed an \"anchoring\" process to link the spatial and semantic information hierarchies for a semantic map representation. For representing knowledge, authors used the NeoClassic [892] system to encode the semantic (conceptual) information hierarchy. [893] presented a hierarchical map representation where the highest level of abstraction forms the conceptual layer, representing knowledge in the form of abstract concepts (TBox with terminological knowledge) and instances of such concepts (ABox with assertion knowledge). Using the OWL-DL ontology of an indoor office environment, the conceptual map is defined using taxonomies of room types and objects found therein in the form of is-a and has-a relations. Beyond considering just the objects in the space, [312] implemented a constrained network solver using Prolog to encode the environment and in particular, the relationships between different planes (walls, floor, ceiling) as being parallel or orthogonal. Using the knowledge processing system, KnowRob [889] , [894] presented a semantic mapping system, KnowRob-Map, that links objects and spatial information with two sources of knowledge: encyclopedic knowledge, inspired by OpenCyc [895] , comprising object classes and their inter-relation hierarchies and common-sense knowledge, based on Open Mind Indoor Common Sense (OMICS) [896] , comprising action-related knowledge about everyday objects. Riazuelo et al. [238] demonstrated the benefits of combining SLAM and knowledge-based reasoning through RoboEarth [897] , a semantic mapping system. In the proposed system, the RoboEarth knowledge base stores \"action recipes\" (hardware-and environment-agnostic abstract descriptions of a task), sets of object models, and robots' models in Semantic Robot Description Language (SRDL) [898] . For a requested action recipe (e.g. exploration), based on the robot's capabilities, an execution plan tailored to the robot is generated on the cloud. For plan execution, the robot downloads a set of object models expected in its environment for building a semantic map, which can be uploaded to RoboEarth for future use by other robots. Using the proposed system, the authors demonstrated two tasks: semantic mapping of a new environment and novel object searching based on semantic reasoning.",

This approach enables reasoning through multiple ontological interpretations of a robot's workspace. [900] used additional linguistic cues for text-based image retrieval, showcasing the potential of using knowledge databases to improve retrieval accuracy. Beyond entity-level knowledge graphs, [901] proposed HealthAidKB, a knowledge base with 71000 task frames structured hierarchically and categorically, mainly focused on procedural knowledge for queries that require a step-by-step solution to a problem at hand. Using Probabilistic Action Templates (PATs) [902] , [903] , [904] developed a probabilistic effect prediction method based on semantic knowledge and physical simulation to predict a robot's action success. [238] , [900] and a body of similar work [905] [906] [907] attempt to achieve generalization and solve the open-set problem that persists especially in visual perception systems. Using prior knowledge and learning from various new knowledge sources is likely to be key to further advances in the semantic reasoning capability of robots.",

            "text": "3) Online and the Cloud: Cloud robotics [908] or online [909] and networked [910] , [911] robotics mainly refers to the use of internet or local communication networks to share resources and computation between multiple robots or applications. It is also closely related to the concept of Internet-of-Things (IoT) [912] [913] [914] . Goldberg and Kehoe [915] reviewed five different ways in which cloud robotics and automation can be put to use: shared access to annotated sensor data, on-demand massively-parallel computational support, sharing of trial outcomes for collective learning, provision of open-source and open-access code, data, and hardware design, and on-demand human guidance for task support -all areas of relevance to semantics. Furthermore, [916] presented a concept of Robotics and Automation as a Service (RAaaS) that combines the ideas of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Software as a Service (Saas) and Platform as a Service (PaaS). Wan et al. [917] reviewed the development process of cloud robotics and its potential value in different applications: SLAM, navigation and grasping. [918] designed a cloud robotics architecture comprised of two sub-systems: a communication framework (machine-to-machine and machine-to-cloud) and an elastic computing architecture. The latter is defined using three different models: peer-based, proxy-based and clone-based, where their suitability to a particular robotic application is based on key characteristics like robustness in network connections, interoperability and flexibility for mobility within the network. The authors also highlight the key challenges for such a cloud system in terms of computation, communication, optimization and security. Under the constraints of limited communication, [919] presented a multi-robot SLAM system based on Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters [920] that required only a small amount of data to be exchanged across robots. A number of recent articles have reviewed the current trends in cloud robotics [921] [922] [923] [924] [925] [926] [927] . Saha et al. [922] highlighted the increasing range of applications for cloud robotics in various areas: manufacturing, social, agriculture, medical and disaster management.",

            "text": "Visual SLAM approaches can benefit significantly from an online and cloud based system. The Parallel Tracking and Mapping (PTAM) framework [928] developed by Klein and Murray has been one of the landmark works in the modern history of visual SLAM. It demonstrated the advantages of alternation and parallel computing (of tracking and mapping), leading to a robust real-time system with accuracy comparable to offline reconstruction. A number of present state-of-the-art visual SLAM and 3D reconstruction systems use similar principles [209] , [210] , [216] , [929] . However, the scale at which such a framework can be used is directly related to the compute resources and storage available on the embodied device, as well as the possibility of robot collaboration. Hence, online and cloud-based alternatives have been explored in the literature aimed at widely expanding the scope of using robots for various tasks. In [930] , the authors developed a Cloud framework for Cooperative Tracking and Mapping (C 2 TAM) as an extension to PTAM [928] . In this framework place recognition and non-linear map optimization is performed on the cloud, while tracking and re-localization is handled by the robot client. A cloud-based framework not only provides computational benefits but also the opportunity to share work tasks and knowledge, for example, in multi-robot exploration and mapping [931] [932] [933] [934] .",

One of the critical enablers of cloud robotics is network offloading where a number of challenges still remain to be solved [925] . In the context of robotic tasks based on semantic scene understanding, researchers have explored a number of ways to use a cloud-based paradigm. [940] demonstrated the use of semantic databases and sub-databases on the the CloudStack [941] ), comprised of text-based sub-database selection (tableware versus electric appliances) and vision-based representations of various objects. A semantic map of the environment is then constructed using \"belonging-annotation\" positional relationships between objects. In an industrial automation application, [942] proposed a decentralized robot-cloud communication architecture for autonomous transportation within a factory, particularly highlighting the benefits of their approach under communication and hardware failure conditions. More recently, [943] presented an analytical optimization of the trade-off between communication and computational delay in a network of homogeneous sensors.",

As we have discussed, modern approaches increasingly incorporate semantic information, which enables a higher-level and richer understanding of the world. In return, a variety of new robotic applications have already emerged, with new applications on the horizon. Still, many exciting directions for research remain. One open questions is about explicit or implicit representation of semantics: should we as researchers and algorithm designers enforce semantic information being explicitly represented, or do we enable an algorithm to implicitly learn task-relevant semantic concepts? Do we understand which semantic concepts are relevant for a particular robotic task, and is there a direct mapping between robotrelevant and human-relevant semantic concepts? In an age where explainability and the \"trustworthiness\" of autonomous systems is becoming increasingly important, how could we understand and interpret robot-learnt semantic concepts that bear no direct correspondence to any semantic concepts we are familiar with as humans? While it would be \"neat\" if the concepts are the same across robots and humans, if optimal robot performance involves semantic learning and representations that aren't directly interpretable by humans, this is likely to be an ongoing area of research focus.",

This is maybe most obvious for object class labels (object \u2192 indoor object \u2192 furniture \u2192 chair), but might also be a useful representation for affordances, room or place categories, and other semantic domains. This hierarchical structure also extends spatially, where semantic concepts might be expressed on the scale of object parts, objects, functional ensembles of objects, rooms, buildings and city blocks. Hierarchical semantic knowledge is likely not to be a \"clean\" representation, but rather to involve levels where the distinction between levels can be quite fuzzy; take for example a barista's coffee machine, which is both a single, complex object and an ensemble of objects. Understanding the different aspects of a semantic hierarchy can be important for robotic applications, especially when faced with imperfect perception or incomplete knowledge.",

This has already been investigated extensively in classical AI knowledge representation and reasoning research. An interesting middle ground is to try and incorporate hand-crafted semantics as priors into learning-based systems that can expand, continue to learn, or even re-learn semantics in a task-informed way. Given the wide range of potential applications of robotics with varying levels of complexity and operating requirements (especially around safety and reliability), a spectrum of approaches may be needed, informed by context; from pure end-to-end to hybrid, to entirely hand-crafted.",

To achieve sufficient progress in application-focused areas like autonomous vehicles, much of the work in semantics has focused on domain-specific implementations, leading to higher performance levels but at the possible cost of generality for all of robotics. It will be interesting to see to what extent the insights gained from targeted semantics research in an area like autonomous driving will benefit the robotics field more broadly, just as it will be interesting to see whether it is possible to make enough progress by focusing on providing robots -or in this case autonomous vehicles -with only a targeted, constrained understanding of the world around them.",

            "text": "Like many other topics, progress in semantics-related research suffers to some extent from a disconnect across disciplinary boundaries, especially between robotics and computer vision. A related issue is the dominance of dataset-based evaluation, especially for tasks like semantic segmentation. Papers at the leading conferences, arguably predominantly in the computer vision discipline at conferences like CVPR, are dominated by research that achieves new levels of performance on these benchmark datasets. Although there is a promising trend towards evaluation in high fidelity simulation environments, performance on datasets and simulation alone is only one step towards safe and reliable deployment on robotic platforms, as has been revealed in application areas such as autonomous on-road vehicles. Bridging the divide between performance on datasets and performance on robots in closed-loop scenarios is likely to remain a major challenge for the foreseeable future, but also presents a unique opportunity for what we might coin \"active\" semantics, where semantic learning and understanding are enhanced by active control of a robotic platform and its sensing modalities.",

While much progress has been made in the quest to imbue robots with a richer and nuanced understanding of the world around them, there is much still to be done. Future research will benefit from developments in the technologies and datasets underpinning much semantics-based research, as well as from new conceptual approaches, including those discussed here. The use of semantics in robotics will also continue to be informed by humans. Human communication makes rich use of semantic concepts of various kinds; we formulate tasks, give instructions and feedback, and communicate expectations based on the meaning of objects, affordances, or the wider spatial and temporal context. Incorporating semantics into robotics, especially by bridging classical approaches with modern, learning-based approaches could have great impact on future robotic applications, especially those where robots work closely with, for or around humans.",
