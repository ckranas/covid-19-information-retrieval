Trypanosoma brucei gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) is by screening using serological tests. Until recently, the Card Agglutination Test for Trypanosomiasis (CATT) was the only screening tool used routinely.

Sensitivity in passive screening (74.6%, 70.0% and 90.1%) was higher than in active screening (51.8%, 49.2% and 54.8%). The difference may be attributed to differential expression of antigens by parasites as infections progress, resulting in immune responses to multiple antigens with advancing disease. Combining RDT1 with RDT2 in passive screening resulted in a higher sensitivity (98.4%). The improvement in sensitivity was more pronounced in active screening, where it was low in each of the 3 tests, and combining the two RDTs resulted in a significant improvement (83.0%).",

Usually an outbreak starts with patients showing unspecific symptoms, such as headache, fever, back pain, etc. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is considered as standard tests for molecular detection of pathogens in an early diagnostic window. PCR assays rely on the use of known sequence data sets of specific target genes.

This research is funded by the European Union's H2020 Programme under the MSCA GA n\u00b0642609. The Drug Discovery Unit at the University of Dundee and the GlaxoSmithKline Kinetoplastid Discovery Performance Unit, with support from the Wellcome Trust, have formed a long-term partnership to conduct drug discovery within kinetoplastid diseases. This collaboration has made significant progress, highlighted by the identification of two new oral pre-clinical candidates for visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Here we describe the initial identification of both series through transitioning active series from Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi programmes into VL active series. Both series were profiled extensively in a panel of in vitro Leishmania assays including promastigote, axenic amastigote and intracellular assays as well as rate-of-kill and clinical isolate assays, an effort which helped us develop our Leishmania screening cascade. In addition we have demonstrated that both series work through different modes of action. A short overview of both lead-optimisation campaigns will demonstrate how for both series a focus on balancing potency and solubility delivered compounds with candidate-level properties. Current standard of care for VL suffers from multiple issues (lack of efficacy, safety, drug resistance, stability, cost, parenteral administration only) and community-wide there is a limited pipeline for VL. The two new chemical series presented here are a significant step forward towards the development of new oral drugs for visceral leishmaniasis and open avenues towards combination treatment. This work illustrates the substantial benefits that working in an academic-industry partnership brings for the development of new drugs for neglected diseases.",

However, the approach involves laborious processing of thousands of mosquitoes and requires a constant cold-chain to preserve the viral RNA. More recently, a new method using honey soaked Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) filter papers has been proposed to collect saliva from mosquitoes that may be analysed for arboviruses.",

Several cards placed during the 2015 Zika outbreak in Recife were positive for dengue, chikungunya, western equine encephalitis and Zika. Based on these promising results, the approach of combining honey-baited FTA cards with mosquito traps was then implemented in the 2016 arbovirus surveillance in Ticino, Switzerland.

In contrast, S. mansoni infection intensity was negatively associated with ectopic egg elimination. These associations were consistent over time and probably reflect biological interspecies interactions in the human host.

Introduction Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs; Ascaris, Trichuris, hookworm) are responsible for the highest burden among all neglected tropical diseases. Mass drug administration (MDA) programs, in which a single-oral dose of albendazole or mebendazole are periodically administered to (pre)school-aged children are the main strategy to control for STHs. This drug pressure makes MDA programs highly vulnerable to the development of anthelminthic resistance (AR), as has been described in veterinary medicine. This necessitates thoroughly designed surveillance systems that allow detection of any changes in anthelmintic drug efficacy that may arise through the evolution of AR.

Both methods show potential for the control of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis in the Americas; developments of the pheromone lure-and-kill strategy are underway. Methods The anti-phlebotomine activity of four systemic insecticides in dogs was evaluated using a randomized clinical trial. Thirty dogs were randomly allocated into five groups, four treatments and one control, of equal size. The treatments evaluated were: Guardian \u00e2 SR, Elanco (moxidectin); Comfortis \u00e2 , Elanco (spinosad); Bravecto \u00e2 , Merck Animal Health (fluralaner); NexGard \u00e2 , Merial (afoxolaner). All the treatments were administered to the dogs following the label indications. Blood from dogs was taken at days 2, 4, 21 and 31 post-treatment. Membrane feeding bioassays using Phlebotomus papatasi were used to evaluate the anti-phlebotomine efficacy of the different treatments. Sand fly mortality was observed 24 and 48 hr following the membrane feeding. Conclusion Fluralaner showed a rapid and significant killing effect on blood-fed sand flies. Results from days 4, 12 and 31 post-treatment should confirm this anti-phlebotomine activity. The use of fluralaner as a control tool for ZVL in endemic areas will be discussed. Background Leishmaniasis in Suriname is thought to be cutanenous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by Leishmania guyanensis, which is treatable with pentamidine. The sand fly vectors are poorly identified and a vertebrate reservoir is not established. Social factors related to the disease have not been studied at all.

Introduction Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), also known as 'kala-azar', is a life-threatening parasitic disease caused by the Leishmania donovani complex. In East Africa, first line treatment is with a combination of paromomycin and pentavalent antimonials, given in daily injections for 17 days. Patients are hospitalized during the entire course of treatment and at the end of treatment initial cure is established clinically and parasitologically. At discharge, patients receive a 6-month follow-up appointment. Patients are considered a 'definite cure' if no relapse has occurred within 6 months after discharge. However, as has been reported in MSF's kala azar clinic in Sudan, preliminary data suggest that a high proportion of patients are lost to follow-up and do not return to the clinic after 6 six months (>50%). As such, it is unclear what the true treatment outcomes of these patients are. This is vital to be able to correctly judge the effectiveness of the current regimen and 'real' program performance. No data from other VL programmes are reported on the issue.",

Mean total health system delay (constituted as diagnosis delay: 37.7 days + treatment delay 6.3 days) was 44 days. Diagnosis was based on rK39 rapid test for 93.7%, Amphotericin-B (45.5%) and Miltefosine (23.5%) were the most common treatments while 19.3% received some combination therapy, 11.8% received abandoned antimonial treatment. Of 332 patients, though 35.5% were diagnosed at public hospitals, only 22.3% of them took final treatment there. Remaining patients moved to either NGOs (47%) or private qualified doctors (30.72%).",

Similarly, an early focus on the ASHA as the centre of community health programming shifted to a comprehensive community processes strategy in which the ASHA is just one integrated component. The impetus for this evolution can be traced in part to civil society inputs. The number of incentivized tasks for ASHAs has grown and ASHAs require increasingly complex skills across a wide range of disease areas. Policy documents on ASHA selection grapple with the tension between including marginalized women and selecting women with sufficient education to perform their roles. ASHA wellbeing has been increasingly noted as a concern and is linked to the need for system-wide gender mainstreaming.

We found that in contexts where the public administration is seen as too bureaucratic, and unreliable in its financial procedures, managers perceive a fee exemption policy as a threat, especially if out-of pocket payment is a key financing mechanism. In such cases, charging an extra fee is a safety measure, grounded on mistrust in government. Fully free access of services requires trust between non-state actors and government. Trust is likely to be facilitated by (i) removing the risk of losing resources, for instance by setting up an agency, with simple, transparent and fast administrative procedures and refunds; (ii) compensating short-term financial loss in case of delayed reimbursements; (iii) fairness in resource allocation between state and non-state owned hospitals.

Diabetes features prominently within the wider context of NCDs in high national policy documents, also earmarked for action within Kenya's development agenda for health. Most documents and national strategies guiding the implementation process align strongly to international documents, however based on little locally generated evidence. The process was largely health sector driven. The non-health sector, despite its prominent role in disease risk factor modulation remained almost entirely excluded.

In most, economic gradients are lacking or favour the poorest for vector control while displaying pro-rich bias for interventions deployed through the formal health-care sector. A handful of countries including Ghana and Sierra Leone appear to have circumvented the inverse care law, consistently prioritizing the poorest when deploying and scaling-up malaria interventions. Expansion of control programs over the last decade also generally narrowed service gaps between poor and rich; economic gradients persist in countries where growth was pro-rich or baseline inequality in distribution of services was large. Despite progress in service coverage, malaria burden is consistently concentrated in the poorest; the degree of inequality in burden far surpassing that expected given gradients in distribution of services. Conclusion Ranking of countries by level and distribution of services across asset-wealth quintiles establishes a benchmark for performance of control programs. It shows that there is capacity within countries to deliver malaria services to the poor. However, compounding of health systems failures weakens the link between program performance and disease burden; equitable service coverage does not eliminate disparities in distribution of burden. This highlights the need for multispectral approaches to ensure that improvements in service coverage prioritize disadvantaged populations who suffer the greatest malaria burden. Methods Study participants were adult women of reproductive age (18-55 years old) living in one of the six study districts, two from each country. The indicators selected for the analysis were: use of contraceptive methods, access to HIV testing and a minimum of four antenatal care visits. The associations between these indicators and socioeconomic factors, such as wealthmeasured with an asset indexor education, were assessed by performing multivariate logistic regressions. To enable comparisons between districts and countries, Human Opportunity Indices (HOI) and dissimilarity indices (D-index) were calculated.

But persistence of the diagnostic target in blood after successful antimalarial treatment can affect the performance of this RDT and may result in missing true cause of fever in a malaria endemic area (2) Conclusion The use of a malaria RDT-PfHRP2 in a malaria endemic area may cause misdiagnosis of the actual cause of fever due to false positive test results. The development of practical diagnostic tool to screen for other causes of fever in malaria endemic areas is required to save lives and to improve the performance of the RDT.",

Second, that a woman is more likely to decide to terminate the pregnancy when the perceived psycho-socioeconomic consequences of pregnancy exceed those of abortion. In addition, the fear of the legal consequences was not a key obstacle to the abortion decision. In her abortion care seeking behaviour, the woman mobilizes a \"health management\" group that can be limited to herself or enlarged to its partner, relatives, friends, care providers and legal representatives of the society. This group influences decisions on how and where to abort according to financial resources, its social network and information available on abortion practices.

While in the past serogroup A strains were responsible for most epidemics, serogroup W strains are currently dominating. Aim To better understand the dynamics of invasive meningococcal disease in the meningitis belt, we have performed longitudinal colonization and disease studies in Ghana and Burkina Faso. Methods Meningococcal case strains were isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of suspected meningitis patients, and carriage strains were isolated from throat swabs collected during longitudinal carriage surveys. Bacterial isolates were characterized by conventional methods and subgroups of strains were analysed in-depth by comparative whole genome sequencing (WGS). Results In our longitudinal study we observed clonal waves of meningococcal colonization and invasive disease. After a succession of A meningococcal clones associated with the MLST sequence types (STs)-5, ST-7 and ST-2859, we recently observed the emergence of a new clone expressing the W capsular polysaccharide. Genomic data suggest that the W:ST-2881 meningococci have emerged from Y:ST-175(cc175) bacteria by capsule switching. They are completely unrelated to the W:ST-11 meningococci, which have caused numerous outbreaks after an epidemic in Mecca in 2000. The circulating W:ST-2881 populations were composed of a variety of closely related but distinct genomic variants with no systematic differences between colonization and disease isolates.",

There were 682 (2.2%) recrudescences and 3,738 (11.9%) new infections as classified by study investigators. A total of 85% (199/233) of treatment arms reported at least one new infection. On absolute scale, the overestimation using K-M was small with a median of 0 [range: 0-0.06]. The median relative overestimation was: 2.4% [range: 0-67.1%] and this increased with study duration: 0.6% on day28, 4.7% on day42, and 9.3%on day63. The relative overestimation was correlated with the proportion of new infections which becomes greater with longer follow-up (correlation 0.67 [95% CI 0.61-0.73]). Conclusion Censoring new infections in the K-M analysis led to a marginal overestimation of cumulative failure of recrudescence which increased with study duration.

This important public health victory is at risk due to the ongoing conflict in neighbouring South Sudan. The influx of South Sudanese refugees into the gHAT endemic area of north western Uganda is a challenge to the gHAT elimination programme in Uganda. By December 2016, over 625 000 refugees had settled in the region, both in refugee camps and integrated among local communities. A large number of them come from gHAT endemic areas in South Sudan. The huge population movement necessitates intensified screening for gHAT and implementation of vector control measures in and around refugee settlements to prevent outbreaks in already vulnerable populations.Aim Analyse the risk that the conflict in South Sudan poses on the elimination of gHAT in Uganda and report on the impact of emergency control measures that have been put in place.Methods Screening for gHAT in north western Uganda was intensified since November 2016. Targeted measures have been put in place to diagnose and treat gHAT cases among refugees, and vector control to reduce the risk of transmission. These measures are conducted in coordination with the Ministries of Health and Agriculture Animal Industry & Fisheries (represented by COCTU) and NGOs working in the refugee camps.ResultsThe measures put in place enabled the detection of two gHAT cases among the refugees; one in Adjumani in January and one in Yumbe in February 2017, Both cases were in the stage 2 of the disease. The results of control measures (screening and vector control) will be updated during the conference.",

Routine activities to control human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), and in particular active screening, were largely interrupted, raising concerns that resurgence of this disease could occur.Aim To explore the feasibility of combining passive screening and a new reactive active screening strategy to control HAT in the context of the Ebola crisis in Guinea.MethodsThe Ministry of Health of Guinea, in partnership with FIND, IRD and the World Health Organization, initiated in March 2014 a project to enhance passive detection of HAT in coastal Guinea. Three district-level laboratories were upgraded to perform confirmatory diagnosis of HAT by parasitology, and one of them was equipped to perform LAMP, a simple molecular test for detecting parasite DNA. Ninety peripheral health facilities were supplied with HAT RDTs and trained to screen and refer suspects for parasitological confirmation. A new reactive active screening strategy was piloted, in which small teams of 3 people visited individual households in villages that had reported HAT cases during the past two years and screened inhabitants with HAT RDTs.ResultsBetween March 2014 and September 2015, 1968",

In Southern Chad, the Mandoul area is a persistent focus, where around 100 HAT cases were still diagnosed and treated annually until 2013.Aim Because of the persistence of transmission and detection of new cases, we assessed whether the addition of vector control to case detection and treatment could further reduce transmission and consequently, reduce annual incidence.Method Before tsetse control commenced, a census of the human population was conducted and their settlements mapped. A pre-intervention survey of tsetse distribution and abundance was implemented in November 2013 and 2600 tiny targets were deployed in the riverine habitats of tsetse in early 2014, 2015 and 2016. Impact on tsetse and on the incidence of sleeping sickness was assessed through nine tsetse monitoring surveys and four medical surveys of the human population in 2014 and 2015. Mathematical modelling was used to assess the relative impact of tsetse control on incidence compared to active and passive screening.ResultsThe census indicated that a population of 38674 inhabitants lived in the vicinity of the Mandoul focus. Within this focus in November 2013, the vector is Glossina fuscipes fuscipes and the mean catch of tsetse from traps was 0.7 flies/ trap/day (range, 0-26). The catch of tsetse from 44 sentinel biconical traps declined after target deployment with only five tsetse being caught in nine surveys giving a mean catch of 0.005 tsetse/trap/day. Modelling indicates that 70.4% (95% CI: 51-95%) of the reduction in reported cases between 2013 and 2015 can be attributed to vector control with the rest due to medical intervention. Model predictions anticipate that elimination as a public health problem could be achieved by 2018 in this focus if vector control and screening continue at the present level.",

After exclusion, analysis of 10,493 students showed an overall malaria prevalence ratio of 1.92 in rural compared to semi-urban areas. The distribution of P. falciparum (Pf) malaria was significantly different between rural and semiurban HAs and between end of wet season and end of dry season. The 6-year prevalence of single infection cases with Pf, P. malariae (Pm) and P. ovale (Po) were 29.9, 1.8 and 0.3%, respectively. Mixed plasmodia species infections represented only 1.8%. From single species infections, Pf represented 88.5%, followed by Pm (5.4%) and Po (0.8%). Multiple species infections represented 5.3%. Malaria infection was independent of age and gender. Control program performance contributed to a significant decrease in mean Pf density in semi-urban compared to rural. Some rural areas remained highly refractory to standard control measures (mass distribution of insecticidetreated bed nets, periodic indoor residual spraying).ConclusionThe SMPS is a useful longitudinal-based measurement of malaria prevalence and demonstrating disease burden and impact of interventions. SMPS can assist in identifying more refractory areas of transmission and planning priorities accordingly.

Bhutan (2010) and Rwanda (2011) were the first countries in Asia and Africa to introduce national, primarily school-based, human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programmes. These programmes target 12 year-old girls and initially included catchup campaigns (13-18 year-olds in Bhutan and ninth school grade in Rwanda).",

In Guinea-Bissau, HIV-1 became an important cause of death after smallpox vaccination was phased out globally in 1980. Aim We hypothesised that smallpox and BCG vaccinations were associated with a lower prevalence of HIV-1 infection, and tested this hypothesis both in Guinea-Bissau and in Denmark. Methods We conducted two studies, a cross-sectional study of HIV infection and vaccination scars in Guinea-Bissau including 1,751 individuals, and a case-base study with a background population of 46,239 individuals in Denmark. In Guinea-Bissau, HIV-1 transmission is almost exclusively sexually transmitted, in Denmark we excluded intravenous drug users. Data was analysed using logistic regression. Results BCG and/or smallpox vaccination compared with neither of these vaccines was associated with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for HIV-1 of 0.62 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36-1.07) in Guinea-Bissau and 0.70 (95%CI 0.43-1.15) in Denmark; Combining results from both settings in a metaanalysis gave an aOR of 0.66 (95%CI 0.46-0.96). Data from Guinea-Bissau indicated a stronger effect of multiple smallpox vaccination scars (aOR of 0.27 (95%CI 0.10-0.75); the aOR was 0.18 (95%CI 0.05-0.64) for women and 0.52 (95%CI 0.12-2.33) for men).",

Systemic insecticides in dogs could be used in control programs of ZVL in endemic countries like Brazil. Four systemic insecticides approved for their use in dogs were previously selected based on their potential to be used as a new tool to control human cases of ZVL.

The Strategy was launched in 2006 and provides the framework for Danish support to SRHR. The Evaluation was carried out between December 2013 and August 2014. The evaluation had a two-fold objective: (1) to document the results that have been achieved in promoting the global SRHR agenda and (2) to inform Denmark's strategy to be at the forefront of global advocacy for progress of SRHR. Methods We used Contribution Analysis to assess the plausible contributions of Denmark's global strategy in sexual and reproductive health and rights to the promotion of a global normative policy framework on SRHR.

To identify the snail and fish intermediate host species and to investigate the prevalence and intensity of infection of O. viverrini and the duck species in these intermediate hosts in an opisthorchiasis endemic area in Central Vietnam. Methods A cross sectional survey was conducted in Binh Dinh Province, Central Vietnam, an endemic area of O. viverrini and the duck species. Fresh water snails and fish were collected to morphologically examine cercariae and metacercariae, respectively; in addition to molecular confirmation using the Cox1 mitochondrial marker. Results A total of 12 000 snails belonging to six families, of which 1616 Bithynia representing Bithynia siamensis goniomphalos and Bithynia funiculata; as well as 754 fish representing 12 species were examined. Shedding of O. viverrini cercariae was observed only in B. s.goniomphalos and B. funiculata, at infection rates of 0.86% and 0.14%, respectively. Carassius auratus, a fish species commonly eaten raw, and Rasbora aurotaenia and Puntius brevis had the highest prevalence of infection with O. viverrini of 74.0%, 55.8% and 31.6%, respectively. B. s. goniomphalos and three fish species, i.e. P. brevis, R. aurotaenia and Esomus metallicus were found to share infections with O. viverrini and the duck species. The DNA sequences of each developmental stage were 100% identical to those of its adult form. Conclusion This study is thefirst to report on the intermediate host species of O. viverrini in Central Vietnam and indicates a high risk of acquiring opisthorchiasis when eating raw fish dishes. Sharing of the same snail and fish intermediate host species was found for O. viverrini and a novel species in ducks that is taxonomically closely related to O. viverrini.

New or additional interventions for preventing malaria during pregnancy are therefore warranted.Aim To evaluate the effect of home screening for malaria with rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) by community health workers (CHWs) in a cluster-randomized controlled trial.Methods The proposed intervention was added to the standard IPTp-SP strategy. Artemether-lumefantrine was given in case of a positive RDT. RDT results were compared with microscopy or real-time PCR, and the sensitivity and specificity of RDTs performed by CHWs was estimated. The adherence to test results and treatment was assessed for both CHWs and pregnant women.ResultsOverall, CHWs were able to conduct RDTs with a sensitivity of 81.5% (95%CI 67.9 -90.2) and high specificity of 92.1% (95%CI 89.9 -93.9). After a positive RDT, 79.1% of women received artemether-lumefantrine. When treatment was not given, this was largely due to the woman being already under treatment. Almost all treated women finished the full course of artemether-lumefantrine (96.4%).",

In order to assess the impact of RDT-PfHRP2 testing on the management of febrile children, the malaria RDT was performed at health facility levels and the matching blood smear was independently assessed by microscopy at the laboratory of the Clinical Research Unit of Nanoro. Additional blood, urine and stool samples were collected to perform bacterial and viral testing in the laboratory. In total 683 blood samples were analyzed with microscopy and RDT-PfHRP2. Plasmodium falciparum malaria was diagnosed in 49.78% cases by microscopy compared to 69.55% by RDT-PfHRP2. The RDT-PfHRP2 reported 29.68% (141/475) false positive and 1.76% (6/340) of false negative cases.

Elimination is now the goal of malaria programs in many endemic countries, but resistance against artemisinin drugs has started to emerge in South-East Asia. Adding a third drug (triple therapy) with gametocytocidal proprieties such as primaquine (PQ) or methylene blue (MB) to the standard artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) reduces the probability of malaria parasite transmission and could also protect the artemisinin component against resistance development.The primary objective of this study was to compare the safety of artesunate (AS)-amodiaquine (AQ)-MB with AS-AQ-primaquine. Secondary objectives were to compare the efficacy and acceptability of the two regimens.The study was designed as a mono-centre, two arm, phase II trial. 100 children (6-59 months) with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were recruited and treated in the District Hospital of Nouna, Burkina Faso. The children were 1:1 randomized to AS-AQ-MB (n = 50) and AS-AQ-PQ (n = 50). The primary endpoint was haemoglobin on D7 compared to baseline values.

Paediatric hospital mortality is mainly due to deaths in the first 24 hr of admission; in order to reduce mortality it is important to establish appropriate emergency care. The coloured triage system and emergency triage and assessment treatment (ETAT) is widely implemented in developed countries, and recommended by the WHO 2 , but not put into practice in Northern Mozambique. We implemented a 3-coloured triage system in one rural district hospital from July 2016 until January 2017.Aim To evaluate the implementation of a coloured triage system and ETAT on the paediatric mortality at a district hospital.Methods A retrospective analysis was performed using routine patient files and registry books from Chiure district hospital between January 2014 and December 2016. All children <15 years of age that entered the emergency room were included in the analysis. Primary outcome: Child mortality rate amongst children admitted in the hospital. Secondary outcome: waiting time from triage to first treatment and the inter-rater reliability of the coloured triage rating. SPSS version 23 was used for statistical analysis: Chi-square test was used for the bivariate analysis and the Intraclass correlation (ICC) for the reliability analysis.Results 4360 admissions were included in the analysis. The annual child mortality rate decreased significantly over time with 50/1000, 51/1000 and 28/1000 in 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively (P < 0.003). 650 files were included to evaluate the triage system: 86% of the children received a colour: 5% (N = 30/650) green (not urgent); 71% (N = 462) yellow (priority symptoms) and 11% (N = 69) red (emergency symptoms). 89.6% of children were correctly triaged (ICC = 0.66), 53 were 'under-triaged' and 15 were 'overtriaged'. The median waiting time decreased with urgency: 2 h33 for 'green' (IQR 1 h58-3 h30), 0 h21 for yellow (IQR 0 h10-0 h58) and 0 h09 for 'red' (IQR 0 h02-041).Conclusion In a rural setting with nurse led clinical care, implementation of a 3-coloured triage system was feasible. Triage and ETAT training was associated with a significant decrease of paediatric deaths in the emergency room. Such an impact combined with the low cost and ease of implementation makes this intervention interesting for similar settings.Aim To estimate the prevalence of World Health Organizationdefined CSOM and educationally significant hearing impairment in a representative sample of school-entry age children in rural Malawi, and to evaluate the diagnostic quality of protocolised tele-otoscopy assessment in this setting.",

The pathological effects of schistosomiasis have been studied clinically, yet molecular approaches can bring valuable novel insights into the dynamics of infection and responses to treatment. In complement with other 'omics' approaches that elucidate expressional changes, metabonomics is a 'top down' approach that employs spectroscopic technologies and multivariate statistics to characterize downstream metabolic responses to pathophysiological stimuli.Aim We investigated the metabolic effects of Schistosoma mansoni infection and praziquantel treatment in pre-school aged and school-aged children with the aim of elucidating metabolic biomarkers of infection and clearance, and responses to praziquantel treatment.Methods This work was embedded within a randomized clinical dose-finding trial, which was conducted in the health district of Azagui e, southern C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. School-aged (n = 154) and pre-school aged (n = 177) children were stratified by infection intensity and randomized to receive 20, 40 or 60 mg/kg of praziquantel or a placebo. Non-infected and nontreated children (n = 11) were included as comparators. Urine samples were obtained pre-treatment, 24 hr post-treatment, and at the 3-week follow up period. Samples were measured using a 600 MHZ 1 H NMR spectrometer and the metabolic variation between the study groups was elucidated using multivariate statistical approaches.Results Discriminant urinary metabolic profiles were found between infected and non-infected children at baseline. Dosedependent responses to praziquantel intake were observed at 24 hr after treatment which resolved at the 3 week follow up period.

This assessed the incidence and characteristics of all unintentional injuries among children aged 18 years and below in a slum community in Uganda.Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among households in a slum community using a semi-structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. Incidence of unintentional injuries in children \u226418 years old was calculated. Crude and adjusted logistic regressions were conducted to obtain odds ratios and 95% CI for factors associated with injury characteristics by sex and age categories.Results Out of 1583 children in the 422 surveyed households, 44.6% (706/1583) had suffered from at least one unintentional injury yielding an annual incidence rate of 446 per 1000 children. Majority, 58.8% (415/706) of the injuries occurred among males. Cuts, animal bites or open wounds 30.6% (185/ 608) and bruises or superficial injuries 28.6% (174/608) were the commonest injuries. The majority of injuries occurred at home, 75.5% (459/608). The leading cause of injury and activity at the time of injury were, respectively, falls 56.7% (345/608) and playing or recreation 83.6% (508/608). In analyses adjusted for age and school attendance, boys were significantly more likely to be injured at school (AOR 4.34; 95% CI 1.22-15.54) and to be injured from falls (AOR 1.41; 95% CI 1.01-1.96), as compared to girls. Analyses that adjusted for sex and school attendance found significant differences by age category in the type of injury, setting where the injury occurred, the cause of injury, and activity at the time of injury. Older children (12-18 years) were more likely to suffer from fractures (AOR 2.37; 95% CI 1.26-4.43) concussions and organ system injuries (AOR 3.58; 95% CI 1. Conclusions Unintentional injury incidence rate was high among children with most occurring in the homes.

Maternal near miss (MNM) refers to a woman who nearly died but survived a life threatening complication that occurred during pregnancy, childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy.Aim To assess magnitude of MNM and maternal mortality and document their profile in a tertiary hospital found in eastern Ethiopia.Method Using a prospective cohort study, we identified woman fulfilling the proposed definition of MNM in sub-Saharan Africa. The SSA MNM tool was developed using a three-round Delphi study*. Cases were daily identified by the principal investigator and research assistants in the labour ward, gynaecology ward, ICU, and operation rooms. Identified woman were followed until discharge/death and their medical records was used for collecting information. Conclusion Obstetric haemorrhage and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy continued to be the major causes of near miss and mortality in a hospitals found in low income settings. The adapted SSA MNM tool generates manageable causes of MNM with acceptable sensitivity and specificity. *The Delphi study was presented in the RCOG 2017 and is part of BJOG 124 (S1). Monitoring of fetal heart rate (FHR) during labour is essential to recognise fetal compromise and allow for timely life-saving interventions. However, monitoring is often substandard. The high volume of deliveries coupled with few (human) resource is an important contributing factor. Task-shifting could be a strategy to improve intrapartum FHR monitoring.",

Focus group discussions and questionnaire surveys were held with 43 skilled birth attendants. Seven policymakers and 45 mothers were interviewed. Descriptive analysis was done and Coding of themes were used to analyse qualitative data.Results All health workers felt FHR monitoring was not adequate and contributed substantially to poor perinatal outcomes. Major reported obstacles were: (i) work overload (all groups), (ii) lack of equipment (all groups), (iii) lack of physical space (healthcare workers and policymakers) and motivational support (healthcare workers), (iv) lack of teamwork, job allocation, and supervision (healthcare workers and policymakers), (v) negative attitude, lack of knowledge, commitment and sense of responsibility (healthcare workers and policymakers), (vi) inadequate budget (policymakers). The mothers indicated a lack of respectful care and communication of staff with patients. The benefits of task-shifting of FHR monitoring were recognised: decreased workload and potentially earlier identification of foetal compromise, better maternal support (healthcare workers). Concerns were also raised: competency, confidentiality, competing duties (healthcare workers), private community practice (policymakers) and accreditation/certification (healthcare workers and policymakers). Nurse-midwives expressed concern about insecurity, overdependency on the new cadre, reduced work performance and loss of skills.Conclusion Most factors contributing to poor intrapartum monitoring were related to the healthcare system.

Working on NTDs is quite challenging, because of the rare funding opportunities, at the same time it is extremely rewarding as the effort put in research will be directed towards much needed medications for a population neglected due to its poverty.Results With the collaborations provided by the Euroleish.net, it is possible to use the state of the art labs at GSK-TC, ITM, LSHTM and Sanger Institute and get guidance from top experts in leishmaniasis. The training network was a perfect opportunity to enhance my networking skills, get insights to the academic and industrial perspectives of research as well as provide an interdisciplinary training.Conclusion Academic and non-academic training opportunities on NTDs can be improved by further interaction between the academic and industrial sectors, more interdisciplinary networking and further mobility options for travellers as well as understanding the needs of the people suffering from NTDs to deliver applicable scientific solutions.

In order to be able to address these needs, I was awarded with an EDCTP/TDR fellowship to join the European Vaccine Initiative (EVI), a Product Development Partnership (PDP) based in Germany, aiming to understand R&D and the role of PDPs in the mitigation of NTDs. This training focuses on implementation of clinical research for early stage vaccine development, in the context of NTDs. Additionally, the program includes transversal skills like portfolio and project management, fundraising and regulatory requirements during products' lifecycle that complement my academic and technical skills as a physician and epidemiologist. This knowledge will be transferred to my home institution. Complementarily, EVI's network of partners could strengthen or generate new opportunities for collaborative clinical research at CIDEIM. The fellowship will potentiate capacities for conducting clinical research in low resource settings, through interaction with peers, partners and more experienced clinical investigators.

Each participant was provided with a 'participation package' containing identity cards, food packages, supervision, regular payments, vocational training, and certificates for completing participation. This package enabled participants to: (i) invest in micro-businesses, (ii) support their families, (iii) develop hopes of employment in the clinical research sector. The pay scale was a major source of dissatisfaction among interviewed participants. Once the trial stopped, participants were concerned that trial identity cards, seen as sources of payments, were taken away. This complexity triggered gradual decrease of trust in researchers and local skepticism towards future clinical research.Discussion These findings point to peculiarities of participation in clinical research that parallel similar strategies and outcomes of 2004-2009 post-war reintegration programs (DDR and RRR). The presented case further exemplifies how clinical research can provide tangible benefits the state cannot provide. This, in return, turns the reality of participation in clinical research into a socio-economic process that attracts individuals seeking social protection and reintegration. Such a form of research subject training might provide awarded participants with opportunities to be invited to participate in next trials, directly bringing the notion of professional trial participation.Introduction Malaria transmission has decreased substantially in Cambodia, and there are initiatives to eliminate malaria in Cambodia by 2025. However, malaria risk can vary markedly between households in the same village and 'hotspots' of locally higher infection prevalence can occur.

A multidisciplinary study design comprising two malariometric surveys, a comprehensive household-based micro-epidemiological survey of individual and household-level social, behavioural and environmental data, two entomological surveys and a rapid ethnographic assessment was conducted between August 2015 and August 2017. Generalised linear mixed regression models were used to analyse risk factors for malaria infection at individual and household level using survey and malariometric data. Ethnographic and entomological data were used to further explain and contextualise findings from the quantitative studies.Results There were 713 respondents living in 269 households who responded to the micro-epidemiological survey across the three villages, and malariometric data was available for 82.3% of participants. Malaria prevalence varied between the three villages and over the 1-year period between the two malariometric surveys, ranging from 5.6% to 13.5% in 2016 and from 2.4% to 6.7% in 2017. 11 individuals were malariainfected in both years, and 72 individuals were living in 25 households with at least one malaria-infected household member in both years. Individual and household-level risk factors for malaria infection varied between the three villages, but included household wealth, housing construction, household water source, individual mobility patterns, outdoor evening activities, bed net use, and access to health care.Discussion Malaria epidemiology varied substantially between three villages in a low-transmission setting in Cambodia, indicating the need for micro-epidemiological approaches and scenario-based risk stratification in malaria elimination initiatives.",

Data were collected in 2 rural Ugandan districts, from March-May 2016, and were analyzed in Nvivo 11 through thematic analysis.Results Analysis highlights a primarily socially-modelled aeteological conceptualisation of PCMDs: there is a nexus of perceived interpersonal, socio-cultural, and socio-economic factors. Interpersonal issues, such as with the partner (or the lack of one), extended family members, and the larger community in which women live, are intricately linked to sociocultural beliefs and metaphysical causative factors, as well as socio-economic conditions such as poverty. Other factors such as dietary considerations, pregnancy and delivery complications, and infectious diseases are relatively secondary aetiological conceptualisations.
