The SPR has always prided itself on being a welcoming, diverse, inclusive society. Ill-conceived laws in the states of Tennessee and California have forced the SPR to directly deal with this issue. As a professional society, we welcome this as a positive opportunity. We have created an SPR Diversity and Inclusion Committee, co-chaired by Ashok Panigrahy and Stephanie Spottswood. This important committee will help the SPR to evaluate itself. How are we doing as a society with diversity and inclusion? What can we do better? How can we help members to promote diversity and inclusion in their home institutions and in the care of our patients and their families? Dr. Spottswood, Associate Vice Chair for Diversity in the Department of Radiology at Vanderbilt University and Chair of the Office of Inclusion and Health Equity Advisory Board at Vanderbilt Children's Hospital, will deliver a keynote address \"The Power of Diversity: Meeting Today's (and Tomorrow's) Greatest Healthcare Challenges\" to the whole society on Wednesday, immediately prior to the Neuhauser lecture.

He took a year off clinical service and worked as an instructor in anatomy where he helped to develop the teaching materials for a new undergraduate course in radiological anatomy.

As an \"early user\" and pioneer in exploring the diagnostic capabilities of ultraound--especially abdominal, obstetrical, and pediatric ultrasound-Fred pushed the field forward with determination and a level of enthusiasm that was contagious. In fact, he was so gripped by the potential of ultrasound to enable the safe, rapid, accurate diagnosis of so many illnesses affecting women and children, that he returned to the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), and in 1992, completed his PhD, magna cum laude, with the publication of his doctoral thesis on the \"Contribution of obstetrical ultrasound to our knowledge of the natural course of some congenital diseases\" -a work that simultaneously advanced our understanding of the capacity of obstetric ultrasound to evaluate fetal anomalies, and cemented the role of the pediatric radiologist as a natural fetal imager.",

He recognized and described the earliest radiological changes in Perthes' Disease. He called attention to the potentially serious effects of shaking children, and used this as a subject of his Jacobi Award lecture. He described, with the late Dr. Kenny, a hitherto unrecognized form of dwarfism which is now known as the Caffey-Kenny dwarf. The John Caffey Society, which includes as its members pediatric radiologists who have been intimately associated with Dr. Caffey, or who have been trained by his students, was established in 1961.

Clinical activity, laboratory tests (ESR, CRP and fecal calprotectin) and SBUS were evaluated at baseline (T0) and following 14 weeks of therapy (T1). Quantitative and qualitative ultrasound parameters were evaluated: disease extension (cm); bowel wall thickness (mm); presence of bowel wall hyperemia, strictures, creeping fat, free fluid, abscess, and / or obstruction; and degree of bowel dilatation, peristalsis, and stool burden. Results: 13 patients were included. All patients achieved clinical remission at T1 (p < 0.01) as well as statistically significant decrease in ESR and CRP (p < 0.01). Patients with decreased fecal calprotectin (69%) showed a decrease in bowel wall thickness and disease extension at T1 (4.9 \u00b1 1.5 mm and 6.8 \u00b1 3.8 cm versus 5.5 \u00b1 1.0 mm and 11.3 \u00b1 1.4 cm at baseline, respectively). In patients with increased fecal calprotectin (31%) there was an increase in bowel wall thickness and disease extension at T1 (3.9 \u00b1 0.7 mm and 4.6 \u00b1 2.3 cm versus 2.6 \u00b1 1.0 mm and 3.2 \u00b1 3.2 cm at baseline, respectively), despite clinical remission. The number of patients with bowel wall hyperemia, free pelvic fluid and creeping fat decreased at T1. The presence of stricture and degree of bowel dilatation, stool burden and peristalsis did not change at T1. Conclusions: Although caution is needed due to the small sample size, data suggests that SBUS in conjunction with fecal calprotectin can predict response to therapy with infliximab, despite clinical remission. Imaging results were correlated with colonoscopy, histopathology, genetics and inflammatory markers. Imaging protocols were also evaluated to optimize study quality. Safety profile and dosing for each patient were recorded. Results: For our cohort, diagnoses were Crohn disease (n=8) and indeterminate colitis (n=3). One (n=1) was too early in the disease process for definitive diagnosis. We identified a total of 23 diseased bowel segments. CEUS qualitatively identified at least one segment of active bowel inflammation in all subjects correlating with clinical and gray-scale evaluation.

A pediatric radiologist acquired images. Longitudinal and transverse images as well as still and cine clips were obtained. Tissue contact was enhanced with the use of either a waterbath or standoff pad. Results: Ultrasonographic evaluation of the base of the thumb was performed in 9 healthy infants (aged 8.9 \u00b1 4.5 weeks, BSA 0.27 \u00b1 0.032 m 2 , 56% female). Our protocol measured craniocaudal (CC) and anterior-posterior (AP) dimensions in the scaphoid (triangle), trapezium (plus), and first metacarpal epiphysis (diamond); measurement were successful among all participants (Fig.1&2 ). The first metacarpal epiphysis was measured in three planes (CC, AP, and transverse). Assuming an elliptical shape, the areas of the scaphoid, trapezium, and first metacarpal epiphysis measured (mean \u00b1 SD) 0.23 \u00b1 0.042 cm 2 , 0.19 \u00b1 0.066 cm 2 , 0.11 \u00b1 0.021 cm 2 , respectively. Area of the trapezium correlated well with age (by ordinary least squares regression, r 2 = 0.592) and BSA (r 2 = 0.602). Areas of the scaphoid and first metacarpal epiphysis demonstrated fair correlation with age (r 2 = 0.389 and 0.178, respectively) and relatively poorer correlation with BSA (r 2 = 0.326 and 0.116, respectively). The area ratio of the scaphoid/trapezius (mean \u00b1 SD, 1.31 \u00b1 0.34) exhibited the least variability. Conclusions: Our data suggest that ultrasound is well suited for the evaluation of the carpus and base of thumb in infants.

Results: More PFA-1 ependymomas were located laterally than PFA-2 tumors (p=.012) and the tumor subgroups differed in site of origin (p=.049) and pattern of relapse (p=.032). The PFA-1 and PFA-2 ependymomas did not differ in age at diagnosis, the presence of hydrocephalus, or extent of resection. Conclusions: Radiologic and neurosurgical criteria suggest that PFA-1 and PFA-2 ependymomas have distinct sites of origin. MRI findings indicate that the subgroups may have difference relapse patterns. Additional analysis with a larger cohort of patients is needed to truly establish these relationships. Purpose or Case Report: Palpable lymph nodes are a normal finding in the healthy paediatric population, particularly in the head and neck, with authors quoting figures over 90%. Additionally, true lymphadenopathy (LN) is most often benign, infections the commonest cause. This is a common cause of concern, with numerous referrals for radiological investigations, namely ultrasound. Different sizes and a round nodal shape with a short to long axis ratio (ratio S/L) over 0.5 have been suggested to correlate with an ominous diagnosis. This has been demonstrated for supraclavicular LN but no such association between lymph node size or morphology was shown for nodes at other sites. Furthermore, measuring methods are often unclear.",

Exams from patients with deficits other than unilateral SNHL were excluded. 68 exams were reviewed; 42 were excluded due to motion, asymmetric soft tissue signal, structural abnormalities, and/or lack of high-resolution T2WI or FIESTA labyrinthine images. Thirteen aged-matched normal MR exams from patients without hearing loss were chosen for comparison. Pseudo-color was applied with assignment of specific hues to each gray-scale intensity value using Functool software of ADW 4.3 workstation. Gray-scale and pseudo-color images were qualitatively evaluated for signal asymmetries by a board certified neuroradiologist blinded to the side of SNHL. Results: 26 SNHL (mean 7.6+/-3 years old) and 13 normal control exams (mean 7.3+/-4 years old) met inclusion criteria. All SNHL and controls had normal gray-scale cochlear signal and all controls had symmetric pseudo-color signal. However, in 42% of the patients pseudo-color images revealed occult asymmetries localizing to the affected ear with \"colder\" hues (lower values), possibly reflecting complicated intralabyrinthine fluid in patients with SNHL. In the other 58%, no discernible cochlear color differences were present. No discordant findings were present.

All skeletal surveys were performed according to ACR-SPR guidelines using high resolution computed radiography. Images and reports were reviewed by a pediatric radiology fellow. Images were assessed for presence of rib fractures, location and evidence of healing in each modality. Results: Data was collected on 57 patients who met inclusion criteria. Patients ranged in age from newborn to 8 years old. 25 (43%) of patients analyzed had a total of 225 rib fractures confirmed on CT. 49 (22%) of these rib fractures were acute. 62 (28%) of these rib fractures were anterior, 118 (52%) were posterior, and 45 (20%) were lateral. 10 of these 25 patients (40%) had 38 fractures not visualized on chest radiographs but demonstrated on CT, yielding a miss rate of 17%. 24 of the 38 missed fractures were acute (63%) and 14 were healing or chronic (27%). Acute rib fractures were much more likely to be missed on radiographs and this discrepancy was statistically significant (p < 0.01). 4 of the 38 missed fractures were anterior (11%), 24 were posterior (63%), and 10 were lateral (26%). Posterior rib fractures made up the majority of overall rib fractures as well as the majority of missed rib fractures. The ratios between these two groups was not statistically significant. All rib fractures were best see on the axial plane on CT. 8 patients had experienced accidental trauma; 35 cases were confirmed cases of non accidental trauma; and 14 cases were suspected non accidental trauma or unknown mechanism. Conclusions: Skeletal survey radiographs in cases of accidental and non accidental trauma fail to demonstrate rib fractures in 17% of cases, compared to CT. Acute fractures are more likely to be missed than healing fractures and this difference is statistically significant. Location of rib fractures-anterior, posterior, lateral-did not affect the miss rate of rib fracture. Low-dose CT used in conjunction with radiography may be helpful. without fractures was identified from the parent set. Gaussian noise was then added to each test image, with relative standard deviations of 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20% respectively, resulting in a total of 6 superimposed noise levels ( Figure 1 ). Each image was then classified by the two CNN's. Results: CNN-16 returned a sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 59.5%. CNN-64 returned an increased specificity of 79% but the sensitivity surprisingly dropped to 68.2%. When noise was superimposed on the images, CNN-16 showed no change in sensitivity, but the specificity steadily dropped from 59.5% to 43%. Similarly, CNN-64 showed practically no change in sensitivity, but the specificity dropped from 79% to 45%. (Figure 2 ) Conclusions: Reducing X-ray dose leads to increased noise levels in images. Yet, CNN's trained on images with no superimposed noise, were capable of reading noisy images with no change in sensitivity, although the specificity dropped significantly. The drop in specificity could be associated with the lack of superimposed noise in the training sets. CNN's have the potential to dramatically reduce the required X-ray dose for the radiographic identification of fractures. The positive ramifications as CNN accuracy improves with time will be less radiation burden to patients when radiographs are optimized for computer learning and diagnosis rather than for the human eye. Figure 3 ). The false positive exams were felt to be related to accentuated trabeculation which could mimic a nondisplaced fracture.",

Surgical and pathologic findings were obtained from the patient's medical records. Each pre-and post-natal diagnostic exam was reviewed for lesion size, appearance, margin, and presence of abnormal artery or vein. Patients without pre-or post-natal imaging preformed at our institution were excluded. Results: The final study cohort consisted of 83 patients, 21 of which did not undergo surgical resection. Of the remaining 62 patients (22 females, 40 males; mean age at CTA, 5.0 \u00b1 3 [SD] months; range, 1day -13months), histopathologic diagnoses included congenital pulmonary airway malformations (n = 40, 64%), sequestrations (n = 11, 18%), hybrid lesions (n = 8, 13%) and foregut duplication cysts (n = 3, 5%). 21/62 (34%) and 12/62 (19%) were found to have an abnormal artery or vein, respectively, associated with the congenital lung malformation at surgery. For the detection of anomalous arterial feeder, CTA was found to have a higher diagnostic accuracy compared to prenatal imaging: 21/21(100%) for CTA, 11/18(61%) for US, and 9/18(50%) for MRI. Similarly, for the detection of anomalous veins, CTA was also found to be more sensitive: 10/12(83%) for CTA, 1/9(22%) for US and 0/10(0%) for MRI. Conclusions: Prenatal US and MRI allows early detection and evaluation of congenital lung malformations but additional postnatal CTA adds diagnostic value in the detection of associated anomalous vessels, particularly in pre-surgical planning.

Purpose or Case Report: Radiographic evaluation of cystic fibrosis currently relies on chest radiography or computed tomography. Recently, digital chest tomosynthesis has been proposed as an alternative. We have demonstrated the feasibility of a stationary digital chest tomosynthesis (s-DCT) system based on a carbon nanotube (CNT) linear x-ray source array. This system enables tomographic imaging without movement of the x-ray tube and allows for physiological gating. This is the first in-human study of s-DCT in cystic fibrosis patients. Methods & Materials: CF patients undergoing chest radiography were also imaged on the s-DCT system Three board-certified pediatric radiologists reviewed both CXR and s-DCT images for technique and image quality. CF disease severity was assessed by Brasfield score on CXR and chest tomosynthesis score on s-DCT. Disease severity measures were also assessed against subject pulmonary function tests. Results: Fourteen patients underwent s-DCT imaging following chest radiography. Readers scored the visualization of proximal bronchi, small airways and vascular pattern higher on s-DCT than CXR. Correlation between the averaged Brasfield score and averaged tomosynthesis disease severity score for CF was -0.73, p=.0033. The CF disease severity score system for tomosynthesis had high correlation with FEV1 (-0.685), FEF 25-75% (-0.719), and good correlation with FVC (-0.582).",

Heart rate was used to determine target phase and ImageExact (Toshiba, Tustin, CA) used to reconstruct a motionless phase of the cardiorespiratory cycle for the organ/s of interest (lung, mediastinum, vasculature). Rate of sedation for chest CT before and after the institution of the target mode protocol was compared using a test of proportions.

The protocol includes having the families arrive one hour prior to the scan timed to nap-times, 3 hours of fasting, feeding just prior to scanning, tightly swaddling and rocking the child to sleep. Patients were given IV hydration (10 ml/kg/hr NS) and Lasix (1mg/kg) prior to the start of scanning. MRU study included localizers, 3 plane T2FS, heavily T2 weighted 3D sequence, and dynamic contrast enhanced images using DRV and post contrast T1-FS axial images. DRV is used with compressed sensing image reconstruction to achieve motionrobust high spatiotemporal resolution imaging (3 secs/volume) with improved image quality, reducing streaking artifacts. The data was processed after the study using Sourbon's tracer kinetic model analysis to calculate differential renal function. Results: 7 infants attempted FW-MRU on a 3T Siemens scanner between April 2016 to August 2017 with a mean age of 3.0 months (range 1.9 to 4.5). Sequence scan time was 45 minutes. In 6 of 7 patients, the infant was able to complete the study. In these patients, diagnostic anatomical and functional information could be obtained which led to useful data for medical/surgical management. Sample images showing different phases of contrast enhancement are shown in two patients ( Figure 1&2 ). Sample Gadolinium concentration curve is shown in Figure 3 .",

For CEUS, 0.5 mL Lumason in 500mL NS was instilled and imaged using ultrasound contrast mode and transperineal, anterior and posterior sagittal techniques. Anatomical relationships and measurements based on fluoroscopic studies, CEUS and surgery/endoscopy were compared. Results: In 5 of the 6 patients, the fistulous connections and anatomical relationships were identified both on CEUS and fluoroscopic or cone beam CT studies. In one male patient with imperforate anus, the rectourethral communication was only identified by fluoroscopic VCUG. However both CEUS and fluoroscopy revealed a urethral duplication. In the three patients with cloacal malformation, the length of the common channel, confluence of the vagina and rectum where they entered the common channel, and distance to the perineum were identified by both CEUS and contrast studies. All measurements and anatomical relationships were similar on fluoroscopic, CEUS and endoscopic/operative findings. Conclusions: CEUS is a novel way to image the child with complex anorectal and genitourinary malformations. As many of these children undergo many radiologic procedures and interventions requiring radiation and sedation/anesthesia in their lifetime, CEUS represents an attractive, radiation-free and sedation/anesthesia-free alternative imaging technique. Our comparison study shows that this method provides an accurate means of imaging these children without the need for radiation or anesthesia. Purpose or Case Report: The purpose of our project was to 1) design a life-like simulator for urinary catheterization in infant females 2) to evaluate clinician impressions of the currently available model (Fig 1) Purpose or Case Report: In pediatric patients with prior unilateral oophorectomy, physiologic changes are known to occur in the remaining un-resected ovary. However, the effect on the imaging appearance of the remaining ovary is not well described. Normative pediatric measurements are needed in the setting of a remaining unilateral ovary because size is an important indication of ovarian torsion and 15% of cases of ovarian torsion occur in pediatric patients. If there is a concern for torsion in patients with prior unilateral oophorectomy, it is not possible to compare the remaining ovary size to the contralateral ovary. Our aim was to determine the average remaining ovarian volume in pediatric patients with prior oophorectomy categorized by decade of life in comparison to patients with two normal ovaries. Conclusions: Although the mean ovarian volume is higher in patients of all ages with prior unilateral oophorectomy, the average volume remains <20mL, which is the reported volume previously correlated with torsion. The provided normative volumes can be used if there is concern for ovarian torsion in pediatric patients with unilateral oophorectomy. Purpose or Case Report: To estimate the frequency of multiple congenital thoracic anomalies at our center; determine prenatal ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of multifocal congenital lung lesions (congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM), bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS), and hybrid lesions); and determine the most common distribution or site of origin.",

Lesion location, size, echotexture and signal characteristics were assessed on prenatal imaging and correlated with postnatal surgical pathology. Results: Of 410 CDH, 9 (2.2%) were associated with BPS. Of 817 lung lesion cases, 14 (1.7%) were multifocal with referral diagnoses indicating possible multifocality in 3/14 (21.4%). An additional 4 (2 CPAM and 2 BPS) were associated with FDC. Mean gestational age was 23 weeks (range, 19.2-36.6 weeks). All BPS were ipsilateral to the CDH (8 left and 1 right). Multifocal lung lesions were bilateral in 2 cases, unilateral multilobar in 7, and unilobar multisegmental in 5. Mean total CVR for multifocal lung lesions on US was 0.84 (range, 0.16-1.54). Lesion combinations were CPAM-CPAM in 9 cases, CPAM-hybrid in 3, CPAM-BPS in 1, and hybrid-hybrid in 1. Prenatal US and MRI both correctly identified multifocality in 7/14 cases (50%). Multifocality was identified postnatally in the remaining 7. Of the 5 unilateral lesions prospectively identified, multifocality was established through intrinsic differences in lesion imaging features in 1 case and through identification of a band of normal intervening lung in the remaining 4. Conclusions: Multiple thoracic abnormalities were infrequently encountered but can be detected prenatally. Of multifocal lung lesions, the most common combination was CPAM-CPAM, with a unilateral multilobar distribution. Differences in intrinsic lesion imaging features and identification of normal intervening lung between lesions allowed for prospective prediction of multifocality in almost half of the unilateral lesions. Prenatal recognition of multiple thoracic abnormalities is important for pregnancy counseling and postnatal surgical management. Purpose or Case Report: The prognostic value of multiple prenatal imaging biomarkers in the diagnosis and treatment of CDH has been well-established. Our purpose was to combine qualitative and volumetric analysis of the various fetal MR biomarkers within a single population and use weighted indices from these biomarkers to calculate a severity score in patients with CDH. This score might then be used to estimate risk of mortality in high-risk CDH patients and to assist in family counseling.",

Factors identified on MRI included observed-to-expected total fetal lung volume (O/E TFLV), percent predicted lung volume (PPLV), and spleen, liver, and stomach position. Prenatal factors were compared with mortality. The ROC was optimized for O/E TFLV of 24% for mortality (sensitivity 64%, specificity 82%, AUC 0.72). Analysis was performed using bivariate and multivariate regression methods. Using weighted and normalized coefficients from the logistic regression of mortality, severity scores were calculated. The probability of mortality used to determine relative risk within this population was estimated using the method described in Figure 1 . Results: 41 patients were included in the study. Within our cohort of CDH patients, Mean (\u00b1SD) O/E TFLV was 32% \u00b122%, and survival was 41% (n=17). 48% had major comorbidities. Bivariate analysis identified O/E TFLV (p=0.007) and stomach position (p=0.049) as significantly associated with mortality. Multivariate regression revealed a relative weighting of prognostic factors as follows: O/E TFLV, stomach position, liver position, PPLV, and spleen position. These factors contributed to the probability of mortality results, as demonstrated in the Figure 2 . Conclusions: Using qualitative and volumetric assessment of various MRI biomarkers in patients with CDH, multiple of these biomarkers were found to be valuable collectively when assigned relative weighting, and multivariate analysis appears to stratify mortality. When combined into an algorithm after weighting, they can be used to estimate the probability of neonatal mortality and guide prenatal family counseling.

AFV-measuring software was developed in a Windows (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) environment using Interactive Data Language (IDL, Harris Geospatial, Broomfield, CO). The entire SSFP MRI sequence was loaded into the program in DICOM format. Several parameters such as minimum and maximum signal intensity were set empirically. After a satisfactory region of interest (ROI) was produced and confirmed visually, the calculated volumes were saved in a tabulated text format per slice. To evaluate the performance of the program, a pediatric radiologist, blinded to the results, used a hand-tracing method to calculate AFV per slice. To assess for agreement between the radiologist-and computer-generated measurements, Bland-Altman plots were created and intraclass correlation analysis was performed by slice and by total volume, respectively. Results: AFV measurements were performed in six subjects in the late second and early third trimester (mean 25.6 weeks; range 23.0-28.6 weeks). Computer-analyzed AFV measurement is shown in Figure 1 . Results of each volumetric assessment are shown in Table 1 and Figure 2 . Bland-Altman plots for each subject by MRI slice demonstrated agreement between the radiologist and computer within normal variation.

            "text": "Following IRB approval, all patients who underwent imaging autopsy between May 2013 and September 2017 at our large tertiary children's hospital were enrolled. Review of the electronic medical record, including imaging and conventional autopsy findings, was performed. Findings at imaging autopsy, including suspected cause of death, were compared to those at conventional autopsy and subdivided by organ system. Results: Eighty patients underwent IA between May 2013 and September 2017 at our institution. Of those, 62 (78%) also underwent conventional autopsy, including 30 (40%) unrestricted and 32 (38%) with restrictions. Mean gestational age of the IA/UCA combination cohort at birth was 31.6 \u00b1 4 weeks. Twenty-two infants (73%) with IA/UCA were liveborn, with survival ranging from 5 minutes to 6 months. Causes of death related to structural abnormalities were well characterized by both IA and UCA ( Figure 1 ). Seven (24%) discordant causes of death between IA and UCA were identified, with 6 accounted for by fulminant sepsis which was occult by IA ( Figure 1 ). One case of hydranencephaly by UCA was thought to be severe acqueductal stenosis by IA. Surface anatomy and intracardiac anatomy were more fully detailed at UCA and often not well visualized by IA. Placental information was included at UCA but not IA. Conclusions: Imaging autopsy may be a more palatable alternative to CA for some families, and determination of cause of death in the absence of perimortum infection is similar between the two modalities. In occasions in which CA is not authorized by the family, the combination of IA interpreted by an experienced reader, perimortum culture data, and external exam may be an alternative method to UCA.",

Purpose or Case Report: In recent years, there has been a movement towards more judicious use of computed tomography (CT) imaging in an attempt to limit patient exposure to ionizing radiation. Pediatric patients are particularly vulnerable to the detrimental effects of cumulative radiation exposure, and many efforts to delineate thoughtful use have been developed with this specific population in mind. The Image Gently Alliance created a campaign in the late 2000s advocating for safe and high-quality pediatric imaging worldwide. The landmark study by the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) in 2009 validated prediction rules to identify children at low risk for clinically-important traumatic brain injuries and thus avoid head CTs altogether in such patients. It is in the context of these efforts that review the CT utilization rates in the pediatric emergency department (ED) at an academic medical center from 2008-2017 and compare them with utilization rates from 2000-2006.",

Our institutional protocol is to evaluate for ovarian torsion in all adolescent females with suspected appendicitis. Using time-driven activity based costing (TDABC), capacity cost rates for each resource in the process map were established from institutional accounting data incorporating personnel, equipment, and facility costs. The cost of each process step was determined by multiplying step-specific capacity costs by the average time required to complete the step. Total pathway costs for US and MRI were computed by summing the costs of all steps through each process pathway. Analyzing US technologist cycle time variation presented an opportunity to improve the US protocol. Through use of Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles, a revised, standardized ultrasound protocol was implemented and total US pathway costs recalculated. Results: Process maps for US and MRI pathways were generated from 248 US and 52 MRI patient encounters ( Figures  1 and 2 ). Mean total pathway time for patients undergoing US exams was 92 minutes longer than those undergoing evaluation with MRI. Total cost for US exams ranged from $171 to $367 (mean=$269), depending on whether the patient's bladder was full enough to perform the pelvic and appendix US exams concurrently. Following implementation of the revised appendix US protocol, average appendix scan times decreased by seven minutes (Figure 3 ). This resulted in a cost savings of $10 for all pathway routes, with total costs ranging from $161 to $357 (mean=$259). Total cost for MRI exams ranged from $159 to $167 (mean=$162), depending on whether MRI screening forms were completed prior to arrival at the MRI suite.",

Data on demographics and questions regarding multiple stressors that contribute to development of burnout were included, which are based on previous studies regarding burnout in medicine. Topics evaluated include the call burden, financial stress, work-life balance, healthcare evolution and job market changes, and radiology overall as a career choice. Results: The response rate was 460/1453 (32%). 50% of responding pediatric radiologists were female and 42% were practicing at academic institutions. Prevalence of emotional exhaustion was 66% (286/435), of depersonalization was 61% (265/433) and perceived lack of personal accomplishment was 15% (67/436). Work-life imbalance and stress related to caring for dependents were more prevalent among female radiologists (75%, p-value=0.019 and 45%, p-value=0.011). After hours call and competitive radiology job market were more prevalent stressors among female radiologists than male counterparts (53%, p-value=0.002 and 17%, p-value=0.030). In a multivariable logistic regression model predicting emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, after hours call and concerns about work-life balance were consistent and statistically significant predictors of burnout (ORs=2.3-7.6; p-value <0.001). Decreasing rates of reimbursement was an independent stressor associated with emotional exhaustion (OR=2.7; p-value=0.030) and financial strain was an independent stressor associated with depersonalization (OR=2.3; p-value=0.020). Conclusions: Emotional exhaustion and depersonalization are prevalent among the community of pediatric radiology. On call responsibilities, work-life imbalance, and financial concerns were strong stressors contributing to the burnout. These stressors were more prevalent among female radiologists. Purpose or Case Report: The 2016-2017 academic year represented a significant recovery of the diagnostic radiology job market.

Positions were posted for a median of 2 months and an average of 2.9 months. California and Texas were the states with the most openings. There were 96 jobs for pediatric radiologists posted on the ACR Career Center with a daily average of 16.2 pediatric radiology jobs, representing 3% of the average number of total diagnostic radiology jobs. The number of total jobs and pediatric radiology jobs have continued to increase in 2017. There were less than 2 pediatric radiology fellows for every 3 advertised positions in 2016-2017. Progressive declines in the number of pediatric fellows have been observed since 2013. Resident survey data forecasts continued decreases in the number of radiology graduates opting for pediatric radiology fellowships. Conclusions: Progressive declines in the number of pediatric radiology fellows creates a favorable job market for current trainees, however, employers should expect significant declines in the number of new graduates over the coming years. Stakeholders should devote efforts to improving the appeal of pediatric radiology to current and future diagnostic radiology residents.",

The median age was 12.4 (4-16.6) yrs, with 13 (48%) presenting as an incidental finding, 6 (22%) with exertional symptoms (5 with syncope), 6 (22%) with non-exertional symptoms, and 2 (8%) with signs of myocardial ischemia . The median length for MB on CTA was 25 mm (range of 15-30 mm) with the left anterior descending coronary artery being the commonest affected vessel. 12 patients underwent cardiac catheterization with 6 exhibiting positive fractional flow reserve (FFR). Of these 5 have undergone surgery with 4 patients receiving unroofing of the MB segment and 1 undergoing bypass graft. Conclusions: MB is often diagnosed in a pediatric patient undergoing coronary CTA for investigating an anomaly. In this prospective evaluation of pediatric patients, MB involving a coronary artery was diagnosed in 15% of patients. We saw a high co-incidence of AAOCA and MB (63%), which had a direct impact on patient management. As pediatric radiologists we need to be aware that AAOCA and MB often coexist. Echocardiography was performed in the cardiology echo lab, and a pediatric cardiologist interpreted each exam. The echocardiographic coronary artery measurements were documented and compared with corresponding measurements on CTA. The presence and location of coronary artery aneurysms was recorded. To determine aneurysmal dilatation on CT, in addition to z-score (echocardiography based) extrapolation, we compared the size of the dilated segment to the native apparently normal coronary artery segment. Results: 45 patients met the inclusion criteria. 30 patients were male (67%) with a mean age of 6.4 +/-6 years and median age of 4.3 years at the time of imaging (Table 1) . Wilcoxon signed rank test was applied to compare the echocardiographic and CTA measurements. Coronary artery measurements showed a statistical difference in the left main coronary artery, proximal left anterior descending (LAD) and distal right coronary artery (RCA) (Table 1, Figure 1 ). CTA detected a total of 63 aneurysms as compared to 53 on echocardiography. Echocardiography missed 2 aneurysms each in the proximal LAD, mid RCA and distal RCA, and one aneurysm each in the proximal RCA, proximal circumflex, mid LAD, and conal branch. The aneurysm missed in the proximal RCA was heavily calcified on CTA. Conclusions: CTA is complementary to echocardiography in evaluation of coronary arteries in the setting of Kawasaki disease, especially the distal course. In patients with known distal coronary artery involvement CTA should be considered for follow-up. Purpose or Case Report: Delayed myocardial enhancement (DME) is a well-established method to assess myocardial fibrosis. In the pediatric population, utilization of the traditional segmented fast gradient echo inversion recovery technique (IR-GRE) is often limited by inability to breath-hold due to its long acquisition over several heartbeats. Single shot imaging (SS-GRE), wherein a slice is imaged in a single heartbeat, may overcome this limitation. However, establishment of utility and comparison to traditional DME methods is lacking in the pediatric population. We sought to evaluate the feasibility of using free-breathing (FB) SS-GRE for DME evaluation in a population with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and to compare it with conventional breath-held (BH) IR-GRE technique.",

In fact, only 8 out of 30 pediatric clinicians were aware of the \"Imaging Gently\" campaign. Lack of knowledge in set up of the fluoroscopic suite and amount of radiation administered during these exams also revealed that clinicians were not aware of how these exams are performed. However, it was determined that an educational session is effective in increasing overall awareness of radiation, dose administered and dose reduction campaigns amongst pediatric clinicians in regards to pediatric fluoroscopy. It is our hope that radiation dose awareness amongst clinicians will result in reduced overall radiation exposure in the pediatric population. Purpose or Case Report: Placement of a transesophageal feeding tube is a routine procedure for inpatients. Rarely, malpositioning in the airway may result in feeds being delivered into the lung, a critical adverse event. Radiography (XR) is the most accurate way to check feeding tube position, but its use is not standard. Care providers may be reluctant to order XR due to concern over radiation or uncertainly about which exam to order. Because the radiopaque tip of feeding tubes used at our institution is easily visualized under lower dose conditions, we developed a reduced dose and limited field of view XR protocol for focused evaluation of feeding tube placement.",

Results: Tip of the feeding tube was visible at the lowest mAs setting in all phantoms. During our 2-week monitoring period, 14 exams were performed. Age groups examined were 0 -6months (group 1), 6-months -2-years (group 2), and 6 -10-years (group 3), the majority in group 2. For an index patient in group 1, mAs was reduced by 66% and EI by 81%, while reviewers rated tip visible, location identifiable, and image quality \"routine diagnostic\". Group 2 results were the same as group 2, except image quality was \"somewhat limited\". In Group 3, mAs decreased by 71% and EI by 87%, while tube tip remained visible, location identifiable, and image quality \"somewhat limited\".",

Further protocol development will focus on statistical population doses, wider age range, and tabletop technique. Our preliminary work offers clinicians a simple, lowrisk method for verifying tube placement, reducing barriers to safe feeding tube use. reviewed the images in the axial and coronal planes, and then marked the appendix on the best axial image. They rated the likelihood for appendicitis on a 6-point scale (1-definitely normal to 6-definitely appendicitis) and the visualization of the appendix (1-well-visualized to 6-obscured). ROC curves were created for the diagnostic accuracy. Then, using a sliding scale, they changed the amount of noise in the study, adjusting it until diagnostic confidence decreased (Fig 1) . Marked appendix region stochastic noise was calculated at baseline and toleration level (Fig 2) . The noise tolerance for cases ranked 1-2, definitely or probably normal, was 2.19, for 3-4, possibly normal or appendicitis was 1.80, and for 5-6, probably or definitely appendicitis was 2.01. The easy to visualize appendixes noise tolerance was 2.15, appendixes that needed coronal images to confirm was 1.85, and appendixes that were difficult or obscured was 1.80. Conclusions: High ROC results are similar to published studies. Baseline appendix region stochastic noise was nominally 6.75 HU. The 2-fold noise tolerated by observers suggests a dose reduction potential of 75%. Easier to diagnose or visualize cases tolerated more noise than borderline diagnostic or difficult to visualize cases, indicating the need for challenging cases to avoid overestimating dose-reduction potential. These findings will be used to set the noise ranges to be tested in future dose simulation studies to achieve ALARA. . We compared brain CTs referred from the emergency room imaged on both scanners for reconstruction times, image quality, radiation dose, and physician diagnostic confidence.",

As expected, diagnostic accuracy significantly decreased as noise increased. However, confidence in the presence of a lesion did not change between the full dose and 75% dose scans. This suggests that readers are unaware of this decrease in performance, which should be accounted for in dose reduction efforts. Interestingly, higher noise studies did not take any longer to review, but the number of clicks decreased as noise increased, which may, in part, reflect less effort due to perceived decreased discrimination.

Conclusions: Liver and pancreatic fat fraction are both weakly but significantly correlated with visceral fat thickness suggesting a relationship between visceral, but not subcutaneous, adiposity and liver and pancreatic steatosis in children. Hepatic steatosis appears to have a softening effect on liver stiffness as measured by MRE, and increased visceral fat thickness appears to be associated with increased liver stiffness. None of our imaging findings could predict diabetic status. (Figure 1 ). Twin B demonstrated progressively increased TTP enhancement within the brain and brainstem at 115 and 129 days GA and post-mortem MRI confirmed hydranencephaly. Conclusions: CEUS of the brain is feasible in fetal lambs maintained on the EXTEND system and changes in perfusion can be quantified. These findings establish a foundation for further evaluation of this promising technique with potential applications in the setting of fetal hypoxia.

All evaluated variables, except vermian hypoplasia, were statistically significant discriminators (p < 0.0001) between the study and control groups ( Table 1) . Findings of pontine cleft and cerebellar dysplasia (abnormal signal and irregular contours) were highly specific (Figure 1 ), similar to brainstem kinking (Table 2 ). There was excellent agreement between pre and post-natal MRI for all the evaluated variables and good to excellent agreement between the readers (Table 1) . Conclusions: Pontine cleft and cerebellar dysplasia are highly specific findings of dystroglycanopathy, especially when seen in conjunction. Identification of these findings adds diagnostic confidence when evaluating a fetus for suspected dystroglycanopathy and can be adequately identified on prenatal MRI. (Figure 1a ) were obtained from fetal MR studies of normal brains performed for indications other than suspected posterior fossa anomalies from 2009 to 2017. For this initial assessment, 78 fetal brains were included in the retrospective analysis. Gestational age was determined by last menstrual period or earliest US measurements. Four radiologists reviewed images independently and recorded the following measurements for each case: the posterior fossa perimeter (Figure 1b) , the tegmento-vermian angle (TVA - Figure 1c) , and the superior posterior fossa angle (SPFA - Figure 1d) . Results: For each feature, the mean of the measurements, the percentage of absolute difference of the reader measurement compared to mean measurement, and the interclass correlation (ICC) were calculated. Values are reported as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (Table 1 ). Perimeter appears to be very linear with age ( Figure 2, Results: A total of 11 ONTD patients were imaged during the studied period. EPI sequences were considered non-diagnostic in 2 patients. Of the 9 diagnostic studies, the reviewers' assessment of the upper level of spinal bony defect was identical to the level determined by ultrasound in 8 (88.8%) of 9 evaluated cases (Figures 1 and 2) . The single misinterpreted case was in retrospect felt to be at least in part secondary to a technical error, as the coronal plane was centered at the thoracic spine rather than at the lumbosacral spine. Conclusions: EPI sequence during fetal MRI may be a complimentary or an alternative tool to ultrasound in the assessment of the upper level of spinal defects in patients with ONTD seeking in-utero repair. Optimal technique includes the use of axial and coronal planes performed sequentially and perpendicular to each other. The coronal plane should be centered at the lumbosacral region. This ongoing pilot study may serve as the starting point for a collaborative prospective multicenter study. Future directions include comparison with postnatal imaging and assessment of functional levels. (Fig. 1) . In the subgroup of patients who underwent \u22656 exams and received a median cumulative GB dose of 11 mL (range 3.9-31 mL) between the 1 st and 5 th , there were no significant changes in signal intensity ratios: +0.018\u00b10.087 (P=0.17) and -0.015\u00b10.11 (P=0.44) for the GP and DN, respectively.

            "text": "Use of ferumoxytol for MRA was approved by the pharmacy and therapeutics committee. We retrospectively included patients from our initial three cases undergoing whole body and brain MRI for vascular abnormalities such as Takayasu's arteritis and Loeys-Dietz Syndrome in 2017. Three children underwent MRA examinations at 3.0 T MRI after administration of diluted ferumoxytol at a dose of 3 mg/kg over 15 minutes. Whole body vascular imaging focused on the brain, chest, abdomen, and selected extremities based on clinical history. (fig 1, 2. ) Two blinded radiologists independently scored 11 named arteries on ferumoxytol-enhanced MRA according to a three-point subjective score where a score > 2 was considered diagnostic. The three-point scale was as follows: 1=Poor, precluding confident assessment; 2=Adequate for confident assessment of stenosis or occlusion, and 3=Excellent vascular definition sufficient for evaluation of fine detail. A total of 11 arteries in the head, neck, chest and abdomen were assessed for vessel caliber, tortuosity, stenosis and wall thickening. Results: In all patients, the arteries were clearly visualized from the circle of Willis to the lower extremities with excellent signalto-noise ratio. The average image quality scores for selected arteries was between 2.6 and 2.9. (fig 3. ) The radiologists were also able to confidently detect and characterize vascular abnormalities including tortuosity, stenosis, and wall thickening. None of the patients had an adverse reaction to the ferumoxytol. Conclusions: Ferumoxytol-enhanced MRA is a promising agent for the detection of vascular abnormalities in the brain or whole body. Additionally, the radiologist can interrogate multiple territories in one study, due to ferumoxytol's highly stable intravascular time. Therefore, from our early experience, ferumoxytol is a potential alternative to gadolinium-based contrast agents for high resolution neuro-and whole body MR angiography. Purpose or Case Report: With increasing interest in rapid MRIs aimed to reduce sedation in pediatric imaging, the purpose of this study was to evaluate a 3D golden-angle radial \"stack of stars\" gradient echo scan (i.e., RAVE -RAdial Volumetric Encoding) and to compare results with a conventional 3D inversion recovery sequence in post contrast brain imaging.",

            "text": "Studies were performed on a 3T Siemens Prisma system using either a 20 or 64-channel head array. Unlike traditional Cartesian acquisitions, MRI data in RAVE is acquired with consecutive k-space spokes that are rotated by the golden-angle (111.25 deg) to maximize k-space coverage efficiency. As a result of the radial trajectory, the center of k-space is oversampled and this feature affords RAVE's robustness to motion. When coupled with compressed sensing and parallel imaging, RAVE data can further yield time-resolved images during contrast passage. We evaluated RAVE in 20 patients (average age: 12.5y, range 2.2-21y) referred for brain MRI exams with contrast. Upon injection of standard dose contrast media (Gadavist), data from a RAVE acquisition and a conventional 3D IR-GRE (i.e., MPRAGE) were implemented (MPRAGE first). The two scans were matched in 1 mm native isotropic spatial resolution and volume coverage. On average, the MPRAGE acquisition took 5-6 minutes to complete, whereas the RAVE scan is ~25-30% faster. Three radiologists independently compared the data in terms of conspicuity of contrast-enhancing lesions and diagnostic image quality with respect to motion-related artifacts. A 3-point scale was used: -1=RAVE is superior, 0=RAVE and MPRAGE are equivalent, +1=MPRAGE is superior. Results: All evaluators found the RAVE with MPRAGE reformats to be similar when presenting contrast-enhanced details in 15 cases (score= 0). In the remaining 5, RAVE was preferred (score= -1). RAVE was notably more resistant to subject motion and pulsation artifacts. No significant artifacts were noted in RAVE. Figures 1 and 2 show data in non-sedated 13y and 11y old patients, respectively, with significant head movements. Figure 3 illustrates time-resolved images from RAVE in a 7y old, 20s apart, showing an enhancing lesion (arrow). Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the potential clinical utility of an accelerated 3D T1-weighted RAVE MRI sequence in unsedated pediatric brain imaging. The complementary technique is particularly useful in patients prone to head (and body) motion. Further evaluation in neonatal imaging and body and spine applications are warranted. Purpose or Case Report: With increasing concerns over intracranial Gd deposition, the purpose of this study was to evaluate a new quantitative 3D multi-phase arterial spin labeling (ASL) technique that yields cerebral blood flow, arterial transit time, and cerebral blood volume in neonates and children via a single acquisition. While the technique has been reported in adult populations, feasibility and application in pediatrics has not been previously demonstrated.",

Conclusions: Our preliminary study demonstrates the feasibility of multi-phase ASL in pediatrics. Further evaluation in patients with seizures, strokes, tumors, and vascular malformations is warranted. Purpose or Case Report: Intra-operative arthrography is commonly performed during closed hip reduction for the treatment of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) to confirm hip location and identify potential intrinsic obstacles to reduction. While an arthrographic limbus sign has been described in the literature, in some cases, a \"sliver\" of contrast can be also identified extending along the superolateral recess of the femoroacetabular joint ( figure) . The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence and MR anatomic correlation of the spica hip arthrographic sliver sign after closed reduction for the treatment of DDH Methods & Materials: A total of 51 hips in 42 patients, 37 females and 5 males less than 2 years of age who underwent closed reduction for DDH, were identified between 1/2011-9/2017. Syndromic and neuromuscular hip dysplasias were excluded. All patients had intra-operative arthrogram and subsequent spica MRI and were reviewed by a pediatric musculoskeletal radiologist. For intra-operative arthrography, the presence of sliver sign (figure), inverted limbus sign, or normal was determined. Findings were then correlated with spica MRI as reference and chondrolabral pathology was then categorized Results: For the 51 hips, arthrographic sliver sign, inverted limbus sign, and normal were present in 10/51 (20%), 35/51 (69%), and 6/51 (12%), respectively. The prevalence of any labral pathology in the setting of a sliver sign, inverted limbus sign and normal arthrography were 6/10 (60%), 33/35 (94%) and 4/6 (67%), respectively (P=0.0136). For the sliver sign, 4 true positive studies represented a chondrolabral junction tear and 2 reflected a labral tear. In re-review of false positive intraoperative arthrograms for the sliver sign with correlation with spica MRI, this false positive finding was attributed to a normal labrocapsular recess projecting over the lateral column due to obliquity of the pelvis to the beam (N=4) rather than a chondrolabral junction or labral tear Conclusions: We describe a new finding entitled the sliver sign, which is seen in approximately 20% of all arthrographic cases after closed hip reduction for the treatment of DDH. This sign corresponds to a chondrolabral junction tear in the majority of the cases although with a high false positive rate. It is important to obtain true AP views of the pelvis during arthrography as overlay of the normal labrocapsular recess along the lateral acetabular column can mimic the sliver sign. Purpose or Case Report: Intra-operative arthrography is routinely performed during closed reduction of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). When present, an arthrographic inverted limbus sign (figure) is thought to represent interposed hypertrophied fibrocartilaginous labral tissue that may prevent concentric reduction of a dysplastic hip. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and anatomic MRI correlation of an inverted limbus sign identified by arthrography in children treated with closed hip reduction for DDH Methods & Materials: This is a retrospective descriptive study. A total of 51 hips in 42 patients, 37 females and 5 males less than 2 years of age who underwent closed reduction for DDH, were identified between 1/2011-9/2017. Syndromic and neuromuscular hip dysplasias were excluded. All patients had intra-operative arthrogram and subsequent SPICA-MRI, which were reviewed by a pediatric musculoskeletal radiologist independently. For intra-operative arthrography, the presence or absence of an inverted limbus sign was documented. Afterward, MR findings of intrinsic superior femoroacetabular soft tissue interposition was evaluated and categorized based on pathology when present Results: An arthrographic inverted limbus sign (figure) was identified in 35/51 hips (69%). When an inverted limbus sign was arthrographically found, an inverted labrum was present in 20 hips by MRI (57%). Alternative diagnoses on MRI (N=15) were a displaced or sheered-off superior labrum (N=2), a chondrolabral junction tear (N=11), and an entirely normal superior labrum (N=2). For the 16 hips that did not have an arthrographic inverted limbus sign, the range of MRI findings included a chondrolabral junction tear (N=7), an inverted labrum (N=2), a destroyed superior labrum (N=1), and an entirely normal superior labrum (N=6). The sensitivity and specificity of an arthrographic inverted limbus sign to detect labral pathology were 77% and 76%, respectively Conclusions: An intra-operative arthrographic inverted limbus sign is a common arthrographic finding after closed reduction of DDH but is an unreliable indicator of an inverted superior labrum. Arthrography after closed hip reduction plays a valuable role in confirming concentric reduction of the hip intraoperatively. However, its role in identifying intrinsic obstacles to full reduction is limited when compared to post-reduction SPICA MRI Purpose or Case Report: Prior studies have shown that Diffusion-Tensor imaging (DTI) parameters (ADC, track length and volume) are higher in children who are at ages when the growth is fastest. Our purpose is to determine longitudinally the correlation between DTI tractography in the distal femur with growth rate and final height in children.",

Using a fractional anisotropy threshold of 0.15 and an angle threshold of 40\u00b0, we performed tractography and measured track number, length, volume and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). We used Mann-Whitney U test to compare DTI parameters with growth rate and Spearman Rho to assess correlation between DTI parameters and height change.",

Medical records were reviewed for demographics, presentation, physician referral history, initial diagnoses, imaging performed, and duration between presentation and diagnosis of posterior ankle impingement. Pre-and post-arthroscopy visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores and American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores were also documented. Results: 42 ankles in 32 patients underwent arthroscopic debridement for the treatment of PAI. The patients had previously been given several alternative diagnoses including peroneal subluxation/tendonitis, Achilles tendonitis, chronic regional pain syndrome, sural neuralgia, and chronic ankle sprain. Average patient age was 13.2 years (7.7-18.7 years) and 17 (53%) were male. The average delay in diagnosis from initial presentation was 20.2 months (range 24-60 months). 24 patients had a total of 27 pre-operative ankle MRIs (3 bilateral) and 20/24 had at least one normal pre-operative radiograph. The diagnosis of PAI was not specifically suggested on pre-operative imaging or initial clinical evaluation. All patients had arthroscopic confirmation of the diagnosis. They reported significant pain relief with debridement and showed improvement in average pre-to post-operative VAS pain scores (7.1 to 1.3) and AOFAS ankle scores (64.8 to 91.7) at average follow up of 3.0 months (range 1-6 months), further confirming the diagnosis.",

            "text": "Conclusions: PAI as a cause of posterior ankle pain in young athletes is a frequently overlooked diagnosis both clinically and radiologically. Patients with PAI are also often misdiagnosed, which leads to delays in care and associated morbidity. This condition is well described in the adult population, and although it presents similarly, is not as recognized in pediatric patients. Increased awareness about PAI is needed amongst orthopedic surgeons, primary care sports physicians, and radiologists involved in treating young athletes for timely diagnosis and management. Purpose or Case Report: MR PET is a relatively new technology with many theoretical advantages over PET/CT, especially in children. However, it is an expensive modality with reimbursement and workflow issues slowing its introduction into general paediatric imaging practice. The purpose of this paper is to document the successful introduction of a clinical MR PET scanner into a dedicated children's hospital, and report on the lessons learned during the first 18 months of operation.",

Analysis is provided by critical Medical Imaging Specialist review of the images, feedback from referring clinicians and patients, and from MR PET team technologist and physician discussions. Results: Oncology imaging was the most common indication with 22% of studies performed on patients with sarcomas, 21% on Lymphoma patients, 4% on patients with LCH and 3% on patients with other tumours. One third of studies were performed for the investigation of epilepsy, about 9% for the investigation of inflammation or infection, and 8% other indications. About 30% of studies were performed with a general anaesthetic. The radiation dose received by patients was usually about one half of that expected from a PET/CT offered off site at an adult hospital. Teamwork was considered important, with the interaction between the MR and Nuclear Medicine Technologists and their discussions with the medical imaging specialists critical in performance of diagnostic studies. Nurses, anaesthetists and educational play therapists also played important roles. Taking time to optimise patient comfort in the scanner is considered an important investment and anxiolytics are now used more frequently in older children during awake scans. MR generated attenuation correction maps were improved during the time period under review with better anatomical correlation observed, however a range of artefacts can be seen and must be dealt with in the same manner as accepted MR and PET/CT artefacts. The MR sequences must be chosen selectively to keep total imaging time within an acceptable range but still provide the required imaging information. Conclusions: MR PET is a complex imaging technology that can be successfully introduced into a clinical paediatric imaging practice. Advances in technology and faster MR sequences will facilitate wider adoption, but teamwork, patient comfort and appropriate imaging protocol selection are likely to be ongoing requisites of any successful MR PET imaging service.",

Patients were included if they had an MRI performed with the use of a hepatocyte specific contrast agent before biopsy/resection. MRI examinations were reviewed in consensus by two pediatric radiologists based with assessment of previously described imaging features. The frequency of imaging findings for each adenoma subtype was compared using a chi-squared test with a p-value of <0.05 considered to be significant. Results: 20 hepatocellular adenomas in 16 patients (12 females [75%], mean age at MR imaging: 14.9 \u00b1 6.1 years) were included in this study. There were 9 HNF-1\u03b1 inactivated adenomas, 3 inflammatory adenomas, 4 \u03b2-catenin activated adenomas, and 4 mixed type adenomas. The imaging features of each adenoma subtype are detailed in Table 1 . Of note, 6 adenomas (30%) were iso-or hyperintense in the hepatobiliary phase, including 1 inflammatory, 1 HNF-1\u03b1 inactivated, 2 \u03b2catenin activated, and 2 mixed type adenomas. Only the frequency of diffuse tumoral steatosis (p=0.004) and heterogenous hepatocyte phase appearance (p=0.005) significantly differed between adenoma subtypes. Diffuse tumoral steatosis was present in 89% (8/9) of HNF-1\u03b1 inactivated adenomas, but in none of the inflammatory or \u03b2catenin activated adenomas and in only 25% (1/4) of the mixed type adenomas. Hepatocyte phase heterogeneity was present in each (3/3) inflammatory adenoma, 50% (2/4) of the \u03b2-catenin activated adenomas, and 75% (3/4) of the mixed type adenomas, but in none (0/9) of the HNF-1\u03b1 inactivated adenomas. Conclusions: Of 20 molecularly subtyped hepatic adenomas, 30% were iso-or hyperintense in the hepatocyte phase, including 2 of 4 \u03b2-catenin activated adenomas which have the highest risk of malignant degeneration. HNF-1\u03b1 inactivated adenomas can be distinguished from other adenoma subtypes by the presence of tumoral steatosis and a lack of hepatocyte phase heterogeneity. Results: The xenograft model showed a low degree of tumor angiogenesis regardless of tumor size (Fig 1) . Spontaneous tumors in transgenic mice demonstrated a high degree of heterogenous vasculature throughout the tumor volume that was evident at all stages of tumor growth (Fig 2) . Intratumoral vessel diameter progressively increased with tumor size and age; vessels as small as 70 \u00b5m were delineated on CT images. The density of large, highly tortuous venous structures(>500 \u00b5m) increased with tumor age. Unlike xenograft NB mice, transgenic NB mice demonstrated vessel occlusion, most likely due to tumor intrusion into nearby vessel (Fig 3) Results: There were 117 requests and 101 sonographic studies performed. 82 studies showed normal or reactive nodes, 11 were abnormal within which 2 necessitated invasive sampling and did not reveal underlying malignancy. 3 studies were cancelled due to patient distress.

Data gathered included the number of participants and posts using the hashtags and the number of impressions generated by the posts. On Facebook, overall hashtag usage could not be measured. Results: On Twitter, overall usage of the hashtags was significant and stable to slightly increased over the course of the study. #FOAMRad was used on average by 925 participants per month who made ~ 2,500 posts per month which led to an average of 5 million post impressions per month. #PedsRad was used on average by 90 participants per month who made ~ 200 posts per month which led to an average of 0.23 million post impressions per month. On Instagram, overall usage of the hashtags was minimal and stable over the course of the study. #FOAMRad was used on ~ 200 posts per month and #PedsRad was used on ~ 60 posts per month. Conclusions: While social media use overall continues to increase rapidly, its use in pediatric radiology education does not appear to be increasing as rapidly. Indeed, its use as an educational method in pediatric radiology appears to have matured and reached a steady state. The reasons may include that both medical educators and learners are unaware of FOAM and thus do not tag and search for content with relevant hashtags, that Twitter, where the majority of FOAM occurs, is the only major social media platform that is not growing, and that individuals may not want to use, or are apprehensive to use, social media for work-related activities. Purpose or Case Report: Radiology trainees today may get less hands-on scanning experience than peers in Emergency Medicine (EM) or Critical Care. However, it is critical that radiologists maintain scanning expertise to better care for patients and to consult for or supervise point of care US. To improve our pediatric radiology fellows' scanning skills, we developed a 5-hour hands-on US course to teach them to scan the 10 most commonly ordered EM exams. We assessed fellows' prior scanning experience and the impact of the course on fellows' confidence for performing US. We also summarized the time and financial resources needed for this course.",

Prior to the course, mean confidence for ultrasound scanning was: overall, 2.1/5; appendicitis, 2.0/5; pelvis, 1.7/5; neonatal brain, 2.1/5. After the course, fellow confidence for scanning was: overall, 3.3/5 (p < 0.01); appendicitis, 3.6/5 (p < 0.005); pelvis, 3.3/5 (p < 0.005); brain, 2.9/5.0 (p = 0.13). For the 5-hour course, 4 faculty spent a mean 2.6 hours each preparing lectures. Handbook materials for 10 protocols were compiled by 3 attendings and 4 fellows, with mean 2 hours spent per protocol. Course organization required 18 hours over 3 months. The largest amounts of time were spent formatting course book (7.5 hours) and setting up the room for scanning (2 hours). Cost for the course was $3040, with the largest sums for technologist overtime ($936) and food ($633). Cost for the course was covered by the Department of Radiology. Conclusions: After a 5-hour hands-on US scanning course, pediatric radiology fellows were significantly more confident in their ability to scan. The cost and time burden is sustainable for our department, and the course will be continued in the future. To better serve patients, pediatric radiology fellows should gain a comprehensive understanding of body MRI that allows them to seamlessly transition into independent practitioners and future leaders.

In August 2017, an anonymous survey was distributed to 35 pediatric body attendings and fellows in our institution. The survey included questions regarding whether they had heard about or used NSDB, alternatives to NSDB, and their opinion regarding speed, ease of use, and reliability compared to alternatives such as web search, reference textbooks, other web sites, and search of our institutional PACS using a 5-point Likert scale. Anonymous NSDB access analytic logs were reviewed for utilization patterns. The logs were de-anonymized for a period of 30 days for analysis of user roles. Descriptive statistical analysis and nonparametric tests for differences between the attending and fellow groups were performed. Results: Thirty-one survey responses (24 attendings and 7 fellows) were received (89% response rate).

Simulator candidates were selected by assessing the type of scan, proximity to the hospital, age, and developmental or behavioral barriers. Each patient's parents were then consulted to make a final assessment of their child's potential for success in completing a non-sedated MRI. Parents showing interest were given the opportunity to have their child experience a simulator session. Prior to acquiring the MRI simulator, sedation was standard for patients under the age of 7 and whose chart showed past developmental or behavioral factors. Implementing the MRI simulator program decreased the number of patients requiring sedation. Practice time and education empowered patients to succeed without sedation due to being confident and aware of what an MRI entails. Results: Since August of 2014, 416 patients have utilized the MRI simulator. Patients who utilized the MRI simulator were between the ages of 5-18. All of the patients chosen had scans that were scheduled to be one hour or less in length. Of the 416 patients that utilized the simulator, 354 of them were able to complete their scans without anesthesia which resulted in an 85% success rate. The 15% that were not able to complete their scans without sedation were unable to hold still or became too anxious during the actual scan. The success rate shows the benefit of allowing patients to practice and become familiar with the MRI before the actual scan. The MRI simulator reduced the number of patients requiring sedation and therefore increased patient safety, created a positive patient experience and reduced the cost for many families. Based on our current capacity for performing patient training on our MRI simulator and the observed rate of sedation required for these patients, we estimate an annual cost savings of approximately $200,000 for families. Conclusions: Patients have a high success rate in completing their MRIs without sedation when it is paired with an MRI simulator session facilitated by a child life specialist.",

Of the 22 cases of accidental trauma or unknown mechanism, 9 patients had soft tissue injuries on CT (41%) and 13 did not. This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.05) with cases of NAT being more likely to have soft tissue injuries than accidental or unknown mechanisms. Soft tissue injuries included 17 cases of liver laceration, 5 cases of splenic laceration, 6 cases of bowel injury, 3 cases of kidney injury, 3 cases of adrenal hematoma, 2 cases of pancreatic laceration, 1 case of retroperitoneal hematoma, and 1 case of abdominal wall hematoma. There was no significant difference between NAT and accidental trauma for any of these injury types. Soft tissue injuries were statistically associated with rib fractures (p = 0.02) but not with other fractures, such as long bone fractures. Conclusions: Although skeletal surveys are the mainstay of imaging in NAT, intraabdominal soft tissue injuries can also occur in NAT. These injuries occur at statistically significant higher rate than that of accidental trauma and may be missed on radiographs. The most common intraabdominal soft tissue injury to occur in both NAT and accidental trauma is liver laceration but a variety of other injuries can also be seen. Furthermore, the type of soft tissue injuries appear to be similar for NAT and accidental trauma without a difference injury profiles. Purpose or Case Report: The distinction between perforated and non-perforated appendicitis is beginning to be clinically relevant as a deciding factor of whether to surgically intervene on a pediatric patient or not. Perforation is treated in some institutions conservatively initially while non-perforated appendicitis would require an emergent surgery. While CT scans have proven to be a good imaging modality for differentiating perforated from non-perforated appendicitis, they expose pediatric patients to ionizing radiation. On a previous study performed in our institution a scoring system that incorporates clinical, laboratory, and ultrasound findings was developed (see attached table) , with a high specificity (91%) and low-moderate sensitivity (29-61%, depending on the score cutoff value).

The MR protocol comprised axial and coronal T2 weighted SSFSE, sagittal T2 with fat suppression and axial DWI of the abdomen and pelvis. Clinical chart and radiologic images were reviewed by a pediatric radiologist and fellow. Location of abscess or collection, presence of restricted diffusion (minimum ADC) and size were recorded. The route of drainage was also recorded if a drainage procedure was performed. Clinical out come and need for repeat procedures were also recorded. Results: There were 53 patients with a mean age of 11 years. Three patients had tubo-ovarian abscesses, one had pelvic extension of a psoas abscess, and one had a post-operative abscess following ileoanal anastomosis. The remainder of the patients had perforated appendicitis or post appendectomy abscesses. The duration of the MRI study was 34 minutes. The average abscess volume was 120 cc with a mean ADC value of 1319 mm2/s.In 38 patients (72%), there was a collection in the pelvis, including 5 patients with both abdominal and pelvic collections. 35 patients underwent drainage by interventional radiology. Of these, 29 (82%) were drained transrectally, 3(9%) trans-abdominally and 3 (9%) had both transabdominal and transrectal drainages. All of the transrectally drained abscesses had a clear drainage path established on MRI, whereas ultrasound failed to demonstrate drainability in the 26 of these cases (89%). Of the 15 patients who had abscesses in the abdomen but not the pelvis, 12 (80%) underwent a percutaneous drainage while in 3 patients the collection was judged too small to drain. All patients had resolution of abscess although one patient required two drainage procedures for a recurrent abscess. In one patient the abscess collapsed during drainage and no catheter was left in place. None of the patients required CT. Conclusions: Rapid non-contrast MRI is easy to perform, and can guide the appropriate treatment, particularly in the case of trans-rectal drainage where ultrasound is equivocal in most cases, with good clinical outcomes. The main advantage is avoidance of CT with concomitant radiation exposure and contrast administration. Purpose or Case Report: Ileocolic intussusception is an emergent condition with concern for bowel ischemia prompting rapid treatment. Therapeutic enema performed by a pediatric radiologist, with progression to surgery if reduction fails is standard of care. However, many hospitals do not have pediatric radiologists available and require transfer, delaying treatment. Despite increased concern for risk of bowel complication, there is limited data evaluating the effect of increased time to therapeutic enema and patient morbidity/mortality. Our purpose is to determine if there is increased patient morbidity/mortality associated with prolonged time between diagnosis and treatment of intussusception.",

Purpose or Case Report: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is used for assessment of ventricular function by ejection fraction (EF) and myocardial fibrosis by late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) for DMD patients. Earlier studies have shown that LGE precedes decline in EF 1-2 . However, there is limited data on quantitative regional fibrosis variability in DMD that might help disease monitoring. In this study, we sought to determine the regional variability between different slice locations, and hypothesize that apical LGE is associated with a later stage of the disease, when EF is abnormal.",

Conclusions: R2* is a consistent measure of liver iron concentration independent of liver segment, MR parameters, and magnet strength. As such, R2* may be considered a robust noninvasive biomarker of LIC, and represents an improvement over Ferriscan's greater cost, longer acquisition time, and longer post-processing time, and over SQUID, which has limited geographic availability. Purpose or Case Report: Interventional radiology is becoming a clinical specialty by performing preprocedural consultation and also providing longitudinal care for patients to improve quality of care. The objective of this educational paper is to describe the process of establishing an inpatient consult service and aborting the old fashioned order based service for pediatric interventional radiology (PIR) Methods & Materials: At our large tertiary care children's hospital, PIR service had been a order based service for 10 years since its establishment. We performed approximately 4200 procedures in 2015, approximately 60 % of which were inpatients. We created an inpatient consult service starting October 1, 2016 at our medical center campus by allowing referring providers to only place a consultation order for PIR. Every consultation would then result in patient being evaluated by PIR team { Physician Assistant (PA) /Nurse practitioner (NP) / Medical Doctor (MD)} followed by a consultation note and a procedure order (one of 6 generic imaging orders) if a procedure was indicated, Results: Between 10/2016 to 09/2017, 1912 consults were performed resulting in total revenue of approximately 135,000. The consult service improved patient, IR staff and referring clinician satisfaction. Despite fears of significant delays in patient care, no delays were noticed in providing procedural care to the patients. We will describe the process as well as the lessons learnt such as omission of orders for feeding tubes (gastrojejunostomy and nasojejunal tubes), creation of consult notes in Epic and 6 generic IMG orders to improve efficiency of service, weekend consultation issues as well as introduction of consultation service at 2 other community hospitals since April 2017. Conclusions: Providing inpatient consultation for pediatric IR procedures can be achieved. This service shifts the model of PIR from \"procedural\" to \"clinical consultant\" and generates additional revenue for the division. Purpose or Case Report: The Society of Interventional Radiology's (SIR) classification grading system has been the standard for reporting adverse events in interventional radiology procedures since it was published in 2003. In response to concerns about inter-observer reliability, an updated grading system was developed by the SIR based on the Clavien-Dindo classification criteria used in surgery. The goal of this study was to measure the inter-observer reliability of the two SIR adverse event classification systems in a pediatric cohort.",

Four pediatric interventional radiologists scored all thirty pediatric clinical case scenarios according to both the standard and updated adverse event classification systems. Readers were provided with criteria for both classification systems at the time of their interpretation. Inter-observer agreement was assessed using Fleiss' kappa. The weighted degree of association of assessments by readers was measured using the Kendall's coefficient of concordance (KCC). Results: Patient age from the case scenarios ranged from 2 months-20 years (mean 8.36 years). Fleiss' kappa statistic for inter-observer agreement in classification of adverse events according to the standard and updated SIR systems are presented in Table 1 . The two systems were similar in terms of interobserver agreement overall, demonstrating fair agreement. Agreement across the severity categories ranged widely for both systems. Perfect agreement was observed for patient death. Otherwise, kappa values for each severity category ranged from poor to substantial for the standard system and from poor to moderate for the updated system (Table 1 ). The KCC for the standard and updated classification systems were 0.77 and 0.55 respectively.",

Our findings support the need for a pediatric specific adverse event classification system. Purpose or Case Report: For patients unable to maintain normal PO intake, gastrojejunostomy tubes represent a lifesaving and life-prolonging intervention. Maintenance of these tubes, however, does not always adhere to a regimen. Lack of a structured exchange schedule for pediatric gastrojejunostomy tubes results in problematic exchanges, often scheduled only when the original tube becomes clogged or falls out. This results in more complex exchanges and delays in feeding which sometimes require interim hospitalization for parenteral nutrition. We developed a structured tube exchange program with the pediatric gastroenterology service to improve patient experiences and outcomes for children reliant on gastrojejunostomy feedings.",

We measured fluoroscopy time of cases, wait time for tube exchange (measured from order date to case date), case time in the fluoroscopy suite (measured from KUB/scout time stamp to case completion), and number of de novo tube replacements (defined as a tube which had completely fallen out and could not be exchanged over a guidewire) before and after this intervention. The study was conducted over a period of 12 months with n = 9 cases pre intervetion and n = 10 cases post intervention. Results: Before our intervention, mean fluoroscopy time was 48 seconds; mean case time was 82 minutes; mean wait time was 44.8 hours; and percentage of de novo replacements was 19%. After this intervention, mean fluoroscopy time was 34 seconds; mean case time was 29 minutes; mean wait time was 35 hours; and percentage of de novo replacements was 0%. Overall, fluoroscopy time was reduced by 29%. Case time was reduced by 65%. Wait time was reduced by 22%. De novo tube replacements were reduced by 100%. Conclusions: Implementing scheduled gastrojejunostomy tube exchanges results in a better experience for patients with decreased radiation dose and wait time for tube replacement. Efficiency of the fluoroscopy suite was also improved, with shorter overall duration of cases and fewer de novo replacements. 54.9 \u00b1 6.4, p = 0.29; and mean EF = 58.8 \u00b1 5% vs 54.9 \u00b1 6.4 % ;p = 0.03 ); see figure 1. The scan times were significantly shorter for RT-cine (2 heart beats/slice; ~45 seconds for entire 14 slice acquisition) compared with BH-cine acquisition (6-8 beats/slice; ~5:38 minutes for 14-slice acquisition, p< 0.01). Figure 2 shows representative images acquired. Conclusions: CS-based free-breathing RT-cine technique is feasible and provides images of comparable quality and diagnostic value when compared to conventional BH-cine SSFP, while significantly reducing scan time. It offers a potential solution to avoid the need for sedation for functional evaluation, improve diagnostic utility of MRI in arrhythmia, and improve CMR efficiency and workflow. Future reduction in reconstruction times, is needed prior to implementation of CSbased RT techniques into clinical practice. Purpose or Case Report: There are multiple variations of Conjoined twins. Prenatal and postnatal imaging is crucial in defining the shared structures, vascularity, and identifying any other significant anomalies. The determination of the shared organs is instrumental in helping the physicians and parents make the decision or potential for separation. In this specific case the twins were referred to our institution and had an MRI, and Ultrasound. At this time not only were the shared structures identified but also two rather significant anomalies were found, a congenital diaphragmatic hernia and an omphalocele. A specific plan for delivery and immediate postnatal care was made based on this imaging. Additionally extensive postnatal imaging was performed shortly after birth to help guide the physicians in their decisions for the management of the twins care.",

Purpose or Case Report: Scimitar syndrome and subdiaphragmatic total anomalous pulmonary venous connections (TAPVC) are congenital pulmonary vascular anomalies that are not typically diagnosed on routine abdominal sonography. We present three cases of ultrasound diagnosis of neonates with subdiaphragmatic pulmonary veins diagnosed on abdominal ultrasound; to the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of abdominal ultrasound diagnosis of previously unknown scimitar syndrome. Case 1: 16 day old girl born at term with cardiac dextroposition and right lung hypoplasia. On abdominal ultrasound, a large vascular structure was seen draining into the inferior vena cava (IVC) near the hepatic confluence, arising in lung above the diaphragm. Doppler confirms venous flow into the IVC ( Figure  1) ; an arterial aortic branch with pulmonary spectral Doppler signature, extended into the base of the right lung. The diagnosis of scimitar syndrome was made, confirmed several weeks later with CT angiography. Case 2: One day old girl born at 29 weeks gestation had a prenatal diagnosis of complex congenital heart disease. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated asplenia. As part of the complex, the examination demonstrated the common pulmonary vein draining into the left portal vein, decompressing into the heart via the ductus venosus, with color and spectral demonstration of flow direction and velocity. (Figure 2 ) Closure of the ductus venosus contributed to the demise of this child who was inoperable due to her extreme prematurity and her other congenital cardiac lesions. Case 3: Eight day old term infant with multiple congenital anomalies. An abdominal ultrasound for heterotaxy evaluation demonstrated a large anomalous vessel arising in the chest between the descending aorta and esophagus posteriorly, and the atrium anteriorly, descending into the abdomen draining into the portal vein, with a partially obstructing membrane near the insertion point. (Figure 3 ). The TAPVC was repaired on day 9 of life with direct anastomosis to the left atrium.",

            "text": "A 24-year-old G 5 P 2 gravid female presented for fetal MRI following an abnormal antenatal ultrasound which showed a complex abdominal mass. The MRI was obtained 34 weeks, 5 days. The child was later born at term, and serial radiographs were acquired followed by a CT of the abdomen and pelvis on the 4th day of life. Upper GI was performed on the 6th day of life. Results: Fetal MRI revealed a lobulated, predominantly cystic mass occupying nearly the entire left hemiabdomen with internal septations and T2 hypointense nodules. The mass appeared to circumscribe the stomach. A normal distribution of meconium was present throughout the bowel. The patient was counselled by the radiologist at the time of the MRI who informed the patient that the most likely etiology for the mass was a meconium pseudocyst. Following delivery, an abdominal radiograph supported this diagnosis, as a large upper abdominal mass containing scattered internal calcifications was observed displacing multiple gas-filled bowel loops. The subsequent CT showed these central calcified components within both lobes of a bilobed upper abdominal mass. The left lobe of the mass was predominantly fluid attenuation, and the right lobe exhibited thickening and enhancement of the septations. Contrast flowed freely into the stomach and circumscribed the right lobe of the mass during an upper GI. The left lobe of the mass was not intraluminal. Contrast emptied into the duodenum and small bowel without evidence of obstruction. The mass was shown to represent an immature gastric teratoma following surgical resection. Conclusions: Immature gastric teratoma is an exceedingly rare diagosis. Several imaging features suggested the much more common entity of meconium pseudocyst, and even CT failed to show macroscopic fat within the lesion. This case highlights the value of a multimodality approach to a case of an unusual pathology. Purpose or Case Report: Acute colocolic intussusception is a rare in the pediatric population and generally involves a pathologic lead point, which usually necessitates surgical or endoscopic intervention. No prior published reports have demonstrated presurgical imaging findings of colonic polyp in cases of pediatric colocolic intussusceptions. We will present two pediatric cases from our institution that feature colocolic intussusception with an intestinal polyp as a lead point, with a goal to demonstrate specific sonographic and MR findings.",

An ultrasound and MRI abdomen/pelvis demonstrated a short segment colocolic intussusception at the hepatic flexure with suggestion of a polypoidal leadpoint. The ileocolic junction was normal. She was admitted to surgery for a second exploratory laparotomy, which revealed a colocolic intussusception involving the hepatic flexure with a polyp (3.4 x 2.2.cm) acting as a lead point which was resected. The patient did well after the procedure and was discharged to her home. Case 2 -A 5-year-old boy initially presented to the emergency department with acute exacerbation of chronic abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. An MRI abdomen/pelvis showed a short segment transient colo-colic intussusception with possibility of an intraluminal polypoidal mass. The patient returned a week later with worsening symptoms and an ultrasound study showed intussusception involving the transverse, descending and sigmoid colon as well as a pedunculated, well-defined heterogeneous intraluminal mass (measured 1.9 x 1.8 cm). An air enema successfully reduced the intussusception. Colonoscopy was performed the following day, which revealed a 2-cm transverse colonic polyp that was removed endoscopically. T Conclusions: Colocolic intussusception is a rare subtype in the pediatric population, and when present can suggest the presence of a pathologic lead point. While colocolic intussusception is difficult to differentiate from ileocolic intussusception on ultrasound imaging alone, a mass acting as a lead point should make it a diagnostic consideration. MRI abdomen/pelvis may be helpful as a complementary examination to better delineate the colocolic nature of the intussusception as well as the mass acting as a lead point, thereby directing the appropriate treatment.",

Purpose or Case Report: Fetal abdominopelvic cystic lesions have various etiologies but are most commonly ovarian or gastrointestinal in origin. Congenital pancreatic cysts are rare entities that typically arise from the pancreatic body and tail, more often in females. In contrast, pancreatic heterotopia or an ectopic pancreas is defined as pancreatic tissue found outside the normal region of the pancreas without a vascular or anatomic connection to the pancreas. It is most commonly associated with the gastrointestinal tract, with >90% of cases located in the stomach, duodenum, or jejunum, and has been known to form cystic structures. We describe an unusual case of a term female neonate with a prenatal diagnosis of an abdominopelvic cyst. The patient had episodes of hypoglycemia secondary to hyperinsulinism requiring a continuous glucose infusion. On surgical resection, the cyst was found to extend from the retroperitoneum towards the left colon without connection to the pancreas or gastrointestinal tract. Histopathological evaluation showed components of pancreatic heterotopia including islets of Langerhans surrounded by acinar cells and dilated pancreatic ducts. The immunostain for Chromogranin showed numerous alpha and beta cells confirming pancreatic tissue. Hypoglycemic episodes improved following cyst resection. This is the first reported case of retroperitoneal cystic pancreatic heterotopia in a neonate in the English literature. We will present the ultrasound findings as well as surgical and histopathologic images.",

We present her prior imaging leading to her initial diagnosis of Waldmann disease, as well as at the time of acute presentation, with imaging features raising suspicion for, and eventually leading to histo-pathologic confirmation of small bowel B-cell lymphoma. Via this case report poster, we hope to create awareness of this rare disease, as well as its feared association of lymphoma. Typical imaging features are presented and discussed.",

            "text": "Purpose or Case Report: Wilm's tumor (nephroblastoma) is the most common pediatric renal mass, with rare reports of extrarenal Wilm's tumors which primarily arise elsewhere in the retroperitoneum. We present a small series of patients who have recently been treated at our institution with histologically-proven extra-renal Wilm's tumors. The first patient is a six year old female who initially presented to an outside hospital with a draining \"perianal abscess\", who on subsequent workup was found to have a large infiltrative pelvic mass and multiple pulmonary metastases (image 1). The second patient is a six year old female who initially presented with abrupt onset of rightsided abdominal pain which woke her from sleep, and who was found on imaging to have a large right-sided retroperitoneal hemorrhage originating from a hemorrhagic suprarenal mass (images 2 and 3). We will review the pertinent imaging and histological findings from these patients, as well as briefly review what has been previously published about this rare rumor. The imaging features of extra-renal Wilm's tumor are heterogeneous and not specific, making it important that the radiologist consider this etiology when presented with a retroperitoneal mass in a pediatric patient within the first decade of life. Purpose or Case Report: An infant was born at 36 weeks, 3 days gestation with a known lethal skeletal dysplasia, diagnosed on prenatal ultrasound. The infant was born alive with APGARs of 5 and 3. Comfort care was initiated, and the infant expired one hour later. Plain films of the skeletal system were obtained, which showed short, horizontal ribs and a small thorax. They also showed hypoplastic iliac bones, flattened acetabula, and postaxial polydactyly. The metaphyses of the long bones had convex central areas with lateral metaphyseal spikes. The constellation of findings was consistent with Short Rib Polydactyly Syndrome type III (Verma-Naumoff). Inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, SRPS is a group of rare, lethal osteochondrodysplasias caused by mutations in the DYNC2H1 gene, a component of the cytoplasmic dynein complex, which is involved in the generation and maintenance of cilia. This mutation results in dyskinesia involving the chondrocytes, leading to arrested maturation of cartilage and generalized loss of synchrony in cartilage removal and osteogenic differentiation. Common anomalies that span all types of SRPS include a triad of micromelia, short horizontal ribs, and polydactyly. Four types of short-rib polydactyly syndrome have been described, which differ based on visceral involvement and the appearance of the metaphyses. Some have phenotypic overlap with various types of Short Rib-Thoracic Dysplasia. The four types of SRPS are: Saldino-Noonan (type I), Majewski (type II), Verma-Naumoff (type III), and Beemer-Langer (type IV). Type I (SN) is characterized by hypoplastic iliac bones, flattened acetabular roofs, rounded vertebrae with coronal clefts, and postaxial polydactyly. The long bones can have varied appearance of the metaphysis, including: pointed ends, convex central areas with lateral metaphyseal spikes, or ragged-appearing ends. A key distinguishing factor with type I is the absence of fibulae. Type III (VN) is very similar to type I, however, the fibulae are present. Visceral anomalies are less common with the Verma-Naumoff type. Type II (Majewski) presents with either pre-or postaxial polydactyly. The long bone metaphyses have smooth ends, the tibiae are ovoid and shorter than the fibulae, and the iliac bones are normal. Type IV (BL), like type II, can also have pre-or postaxial polydactyly and smooth metaphyses in the long bones. The distinguishing characteristics of the Beemer-Langer type include small iliac bones and bowed radii/ulnae. Purpose or Case Report: The purpose of this case report is to familiarize the radiologist with the MR imaging findings of fatal heat stroke. Heat stroke is a severe illness characterized by a core temperature > 40 degrees Celsius, with clinical manifestations of delirium, seizures, and coma, resulting from environmental exposure or physical exertion. This report focuses upon environmental, or classical, fatal heat stroke in the case of a 4 year old male who was left alone for 30 minutes in a vehicle with ambient exterior temperatures of greater than 37.8 degrees Celsius.",

            "text": "As a form of hyperthermia, heat stroke ensues from thermoregulatory failure in addition to systemic inflammatory and coagulation phase responses, and conceivably, from modified manifestation of heat shock proteins. Infants and young children comprise a population specifically vulnerable to heat stroke due to their large surface area to volume ratio, underdeveloped thermoregulatory system with small blood volume relative to body size, and decreased sweat production. The CNS is especially susceptible to hyperthermia as cerebral edema and cerebrovascular congestion may lead to increased intracranial pressure, and ischemia or hemorrhage. The cerebellum is the area most sensitive to heat injury, with known direct injury to Purkinje cells, and resultant cerebellar atrophy, often leading to neuronal dysfunction, including ataxia. MR imaging findings in heat stroke are typically multifocal reflecting the complex interplay of direct thermal injury, hypoxic ischemic injury, endothelial damage, cytokine mediated inflammation and coagulopathy. MRI in our case of fatal heat stroke demonstrates diffuse signal abnormality within the peripheral cerebellar hemispheres (eg. Purkinje cell regions). MRI recapitulates the known pathology of fatal heat stroke with injury to Purkinge cells and adjacent Bergmann glia. Other reported heat stroke related MRI findings include T2 prolongation and restricted diffusion involving the paramedian thalamic nuclei, dentate nuclei, basal ganglia, hippocampii, and cerebral cortex particularly the vascular watershed zones. If the health history for heat stroke is uncertain, the imaging differential diagnosis includes other cerebellar syndromes including: toxic -metabolic (eg. opiate toxicity), infectiousautoimmune (eg. Varicellar zoster cerebellitis), histiocytic neoplastic-like (eg. histiocytoses) and neoplastic (eg. leptomeningeal PNET) should be considered in the imaging differential diagnosis. Purpose or Case Report: An 11-year-old female presented with 3-weeks history of intractable vomiting, nausea, blurred vision, vertical nystagmus and ataxia with gait instability. A CT scan revealed a small calcification at the left craniocervical junction (CJJ) and mild effacement of the fourth ventricle (Figure) . MRI showed a partially-enhancing medulla oblongata lesion and a non-enhancing cystic exophytic lesion abutting the left premedullary cistern. There was avid thick enhancement along the ventrolateral surface of the medulla oblongata. No restricted diffusion was present. MR spectroscopy demonstrated decreased NAA and elevated lactates. Based on imaging findings, a brainstem glioma with exophytic component was suspected. The CBC, CMP, ESR and CRP were normal. The patient underwent suboccipital craniectomy with C1 laminectomy, and an exophytic pale gray mass was identified. Multiple specimens were taken, and frozen diagnosis showed only necrosis. The cyst wall was resected. Resection of the brainstem component was limited by neurophysiology. Histologically, the lesion consisted of a fibrous cyst wall lined by columnar to pseudostratified columnar epithelium, findings reflecting a neuroenteric cyst. No glial tissue was identified. Gram stain and Grocott stain were negative for bacterial and fungal specimens. An empiric treatment with wide spectrum antibiotic was started. Follow-up MRI demonstrated near complete resolution of edema in the medulla oblongata, and substantial decrease in enhancement in anterolateral exophytic component and patient has substantially improved clinically. In retrospect, a sinus tract extended from the cystic lesion at the craniocervical junction into the brainstem causing edema, inflammation and enhancement which resolved once the cyst was surgically decompressed. Conclusion: This case shows a neuroenteric cyst connected to the brainstem, through a sinus tract leading to chronic inflammation and infection, resulting in imaging findings resembling a brainstem glioma. Surgical decompression of the cyst and antibiotic treatment resulted in resolution of the brainstem lesion. Purpose or Case Report: Propionic acidemia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder in which a genetic mutation results in the abnormal function of propionyl co-enzyme A (CoA) carboxylase, an enzyme involved in protein breakdown and lipid catabolsim. This results in the accumulation of metabolites which can have devastating neurologic consequences. The incidence in the United States has been reported as 1 in 100,000 births. The genetic and metabolic factors contributing to this disorder are discussed.",

            "text": "Brain MRI findings in propionic acidemia are described in 2 patients. The first patient is a 5month-old male who was transferred from an outside hospital on respiratory support with severely elevated ammonia and metabolic acidosis. The second patient is a 15-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with a mild headache and increased sleepiness. Following admission, she decompensated significantly, and her serum ammonia level was shown to be three times the normal limit. Results: MRI of the brain in the first child demonstrated diffusion restriction in a subcortical pattern evenly distributed throughout both cerebral hemispheres. In the second patient, MRI revealed cortical diffusion restriction throughout the entire left cerebral hemisphere, however, the right cerebral hemisphere was affected to a much lesser extent. Interestingly, parenchymal volume loss was prominent throughout the right cerebral hemisphere. The basal ganglia and thalami were not affected in either child. Follow-up MRI obtained in both children after appropriate therapy showed improvement in diffusion restriction. There was diffuse cerebral atrophy on follow-up of the first patient. Follow-up MRI of the second patient showed resolution of diffusion restriction and continued volume loss throughout the contralateral (right) cerebral hemisphere. Conclusions: These cases illustrate unique and distinct patterns of diffusion restriction in propionic acidemia crises. Commonly reported findings in the literature include involvement of the basal ganglia and/or thalami which were not seen in these two children. The cases shown here further expand the differential diagnosis for nonspecific diffusion restriction and demonstrate uncommon presentations of an already rare disease entity. Purpose or Case Report: We will present imaging findings of segmental spinal dysgenesis in a series of 3 cases of this rare congenital abnormality. We will also describe the embryological basis and pertinent clinical features.",

Diffuse esophageal leiomyomatosis (DEL) was probably first described by Hall in 1916 in a case report of a 17 year old female who died of starvation due to dysphagia, with the diagnosis subsequently made on autopsy. While some cases of DEL are sporadic, as in our case, there is a well-established association with the x-linked Alport Syndrome, especially in the pediatric population. Up to 5% of Alport patients are affected by DEL and as much as 2/3 of pediatric patients with DEL carry the diagnosis of Alport Syndrome. Esophageal-Vulvar syndrome, characterized by leiomyomata of both the vulva and esophagus, presents with findings of DEL on imaging in many cases, often in young adult females. While presentations may vary, the majority of patients present with long standing dysphagia. An Iver-Lewis esophagectomy with a gastric pull-through is the treatment of choice. Purpose or Case Report: Spectral or multi-energy CT (MECT), obtains raw data at more than one energy spectra which allows the decomposition of materials into their constituent elements. As opposed to conventional CT which yields data based on linear attenuation, MECT yields both structural and materialspecific information. Only limited experience and literature are available regarding use and applications of MECT in the pediatric patient population. Our institution has recently installed a spectral MECT scanner which uses a single x-ray source modified multilayered detector CT, in our emergency department (ED). It is currently the only such scanner used for routine clinical pediatric imaging in the US, and 4 th such unit in a children's hospital in the world. In this educational exhibit we will review the basic physics of MECT, the benefits and limitations of the single-source multi-layered detector geometry, and clinical applications of MECT and our experience to date in the pediatric population.",

The feed and wrap technique in which feeding and warmth are used to induce sleep and swaddling is used to reduce motion is described. Indications and contraindications as well risks and benefits of this method versus general anesthesia and deep sedation are discussed. Multiple examples of congenital heart disease including atrial and ventricular septal defects, atrioventricular canal defects, and double outlet right ventricle are provided, with sequences used, length of scan, and diagnostic quality also summarized. The example shown in Figures 1-3 is a 12-day-old female. The scan was completed in 12 minutes without intravenous contrast. Figure 1 is the scout image showing situs inversus. Figure 2 is a gated axial steady state free procession (SSFP) image showing a membranous ventricular septal defect (yellow arrow), an atrial septal defect (yellow arrowhead), and atrial inversion. Figure 3 is a 4D flow reconstruction showing the superior and inferior vena cava entering anatomic right atrium on the left, a right aortic arch with mirror branch pattern, and relationship to the main pulmonary artery (MPA). Conclusions: After reviewing this educational exhibit, the reader will be able to implement the feed and wrap method as an alternative to general anesthesia or sedation in CT and MRI scans of infants. Examples are provided in cardiovascular imaging, of particular interest because the risk of adverse events under general anesthesia is higher in congenital heart disease patients and because of the complexity of disease being evaluated. Purpose or Case Report: CHD (congenital heart disease) occurs in approximately 1% of all live births with more than 90% survival into adulthood. Prevalence of coronary artery disease has been reported to be similar to general adult population. Patients with complex CHD may be subjected to non-atherosclerotic premature coronary artery disease due to anomalous coronaries, peri-coronary region interventions, or coronary re-implantation. Cardiac MRI (CMR) may provide valuable myocardium health information with pointers towards a coronary distribution in unsuspected chronic or acute cases. Acquisition of delayed enhancement sequences (LGE) and T1 mapping should be considered routine in CMR studies for assessment of interval ischemic events. Patients with complex CHD are also at risk for sudden cardiac arrest and LGE data may assist in further risk stratification of these patients. Three complex CHD patients who all suffered myocardial infarctions at a young age as a result of their multifaceted cardiac history are highlighted to illustrate the importance of this (see included table, Figure 1 ). Two CMR images (Figures 2,3 ) demonstrate delayed enhancement throughout the septum at the base to midcavity in a patient with truncus arteriosus type 1 who presented with a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Focal area of low-signal sub-endocaridum within the enhancement on Figure 3 favors microvascular obstruction. CMR is a vital component of surgical planning and postoperative care of patients with CHD, providing accurate anatomical, functional, and flow information that assists in clinical management. Delayed enhancement sequences and postgadolinium T1 mapping allow assessment of ischemic injury or infarct, and therefore should be considered part of routine follow up CMR studies in patients with complex CHD. Purpose or Case Report: The purpose of this educational presentation is to provide a pictorial review to promote recognition and understanding of the embryology, anatomy and spectrum of interruption of the aortic arch (IAA) in children.",

            "text": "Purpose or Case Report: The rare entity of an absent pulmonary artery has appeared in the literature since 1868, with most cases associated with congenital heart disease of various types. It has also long been observed that the absent pulmonary artery is contralateral to the aortic arch in almost every case. Isolated absence of a single pulmonary artery without associated congenital heart disease is less common, and these patients may present at any time from prenatal screening, neonatal period, early childhood, or even adolescence and adulthood. We will discuss the embryologic origins, clinical presentations, expected imaging findings, and treatment options based on patient ages from newborn to adolescence. In neonates with an isolated absent pulmonary artery, a patent ductus arteriosus will allow for continued systemic blood supply. Even early on, narrowing of the PDA may be seen as involution is inevitable without intervention. The lung parenchyma is typically preserved, without yet evidence of hypoplasia or oligemia. Once the PDA has closed, robust collateral formation will occur. As patients age without repair, the lung parenchyma may become hypoplastic with diminished lung volumes and vascular markings. Findings suggestive of recurrent infection such as bronchiectasis may also be evident. Early discovery and treatment is ideal as this will allow for prevention of long term sequelae and the greatest restoration of lung function as the options for repair are limited in the older patient. There is no universal standard approach for repairing the underlying mechanism of providing blood flow to the intrapulmonary pulmonary artery. Early intervention in neonates included PDA stenting or anastomosing the main pulmonary artery with the intrapulmonary pulmonary artery using a synthetic graft. Patients that present after the neonatal period are not likely to be eligible for surgical repair. The most common long term effect of an absent pulmonary artery is pulmonary hypertension, seen in 40% of patients. The entity of isolated unilateral absence of a pulmonary artery is rare, however demonstrates typical cardiothoracic findings depending on age at presentation. Understanding of embryology, specifically the 4th and 6th primitive aortic arches, allows one to understand why this malformation occurred and what findings to expect on imaging. The maintained PDA is vital for early lung blood supply and development and can aid in repair.",

A number of disease processes can interfere with rhombencephalic development, including genetic malformations and disruption such as hypoxia, toxins, infections, trauma, and vascular disorders. Structural changes associated with fetal imaging pathology that deviate from the normal gestational-age specific developmental patterns can define the etiology, improve our understanding of the disease, and help with prognostication. A comprehension of basic embryology and developmental anatomy is necessary to achieve a true understanding of posterior fossa anomalies and normal variants.

Consequently, an understanding of these findings and how they appear on different modalities is essential to the pediatric imager. This electronic exhibit features fetal ultrasound and MRI of mediastinal lymphangioma, type I-III congenital pulmonary airway malformations, intralobar, extralobar, and subdiaphragmatic sequestrations, left and right sided congenital diaphragmatic hernias, hypoplastic left heart, heterotaxy, AV canal defect, and rhabdomyoma. In addition to reviewing the correlation of findings on ultrasound and MRI, prognosis as well as conditions and syndromes commonly associated with these chest and cardiac anomalies will be examined. The goal of this exhibit is to provide an overview of common fetal cardiopulmonary abnormalities on different, complementary imaging modalities. Familiarity with these conditions is necessary for the radiologist to provide critical information to clinicians to allow prompt intervention in the postnatal period. These findings can additionally serve as an indication to the radiologist to search for associated findings, allowing prognostication and appropriate counseling of parents.",

            "text": "The Purpose or Case Report: With the increasing utilization of imaging in prenatal diagnosis, the fetal MR appearance of omphalocele has been well-described. However, as fetal MR plays a critical role not only for diagnosis but also for planning and family counseling, the radiologist is required to risk stratify the range of presentations of this anomaly. There is a broad spectrum of severity within this single diagnosis: ranging from a small and covered bowel-only defect, to a large and ruptured multi-organ hernia, to a complex omphalocele within a nonkaryotype fetal syndrome. Outcomes are highly variable, ranging from a simple hernia repaired with primary closure, to a protracted postnatal course with staged surgical repairs, to expected intrapartum demise. Further, neonatal pulmonary hypoplasia and hypertension often complicate more severe cases. Thus, accurate prognostication is essential to properly equip and prepare families, and thereby add value to perinatal care. In this presentation, we outline a 7-point, systematic method for analyzing the varied presentations of omphalocele, as seen on both 1.5T and 3T MR field strengths. The approach we describe details the following diagnostic criteria: (1) the size of the defect, (2) type and volume of herniated organ contents, (3) presence/absence of an intact membrane, (4) presence/absence of hernia sac ascites, (5) associated pulmonary hypoplasia, (6) insertion of the umbilical cord, and (7) presence of irregular cord vessels. Finally, we demonstrate how this diagnosis can correlate with associated ischemic changes in the placenta, a finding which can further aid delivery planning and prognostication. Purpose or Case Report: Immunoglobulin4 related disease (IgG4RD) is an inflammatory condition involving multiple regions of the body resulting in fibrosis which can lead to eventual organ failure. This entity was originally described with autoimmune pancreatitis. Recently many other previously described lesions have been brought under the umbrella of IgG4RD. These include a spectrum of conditions involving the head and neck region (orbits, salivary and lacrimal glands), thyroid gland (Riedel's thyroiditis), vasculature (periaortitis), kidneys, lungs, retroperitoneum, mesentery, pituitary gland, biliary tract, pericardium, lymph nodes and pachymeninges. Reports of IgG4RD are quite rare in the pediatric literature, however this may be due to potential unawareness about the condition as well as the variable presentations and non-specific imaging features of IgG4RD. The prevalence in pediatric population is poorly described.",

The imaging manifestations are non-specific, and primarily consist of tumefactive enlargement of involved organs and homogenous contrast enhancement and associated lymphadenopathy. IgG4RD may manifest in single organ or may present as widespread disease involving multiple organs. These features overlap with other mass forming conditions like malignancy or lymphoma. However, the presence of multifocal disease with more than one organ involvement may point towards possible IgG4 related disease. Other than IgG4 related autoimmune pancreatitis, there is no consensus on diagnostic criteria based upon imaging. Definitive diagnosis of IgG4RD is made with biopsy and the histology characterized by infiltration of lymphocytes and IgG4 plasma cells with storiform fibrosis and obliterative phlebitis. According to Boston consensus, the ratio of IgG4 /IgG in tissue should be more than 0.4 with more than 10 IgG4+ cells per high power field. Serum IgG4 levels range from normal to elevated. Steroids are effective as first line treatment in majority of patients. Our aim in this presentation is to familiarize radiologists with the spectrum of imaging features, and areas of involvement in IgG4 related disease using cases of IgG4RD collected at three different pediatric hospitals. It is important for pediatric radiologists to be familiar with this relatively newly described disease entity and be aware of the spectrum of manifestations of IgG4RD, ensuring prompt recognition and early treatment.",

There is growing awareness of the potential for a delayed complication if only the tip or otherwise subtotal length is removed. A remnant portion of the base of the appendix, referred to as a stump, if long enough can become obstructed and symptomatic similar to the etiology of acute appendicitis. In cases of recurrent right lower quadrant pain in a patient with a surgical history of appendectomy, appendicitis remains on the differential diagnosis alongside non-appendiceal causes such a colitis and epiploic appendagitis. Imaging diagnosis by computed tomography or ultrasound of stump appendicitis is similar to acute appendicitis with right lower quadrant inflammation and stump distension and wall thickening. In this educational exhibit we will review the imaging features of stump appendicitis as well as developments in surgical techniques relevant to this delayed complication. Relevant anatomy and differential diagnosis for right lower quadrant pain will also be summarized. Purpose or Case Report: There are a variety of masses in neonates, infants and young children that may disappear spontaneously without active intervention. However, there has been no published review of what type of masses could disappear and what the spectrum of their imaging features is.

Additionally, we will also present cases of some uncommon extra-intestinal manifestations such as granulomatous hepatic abscesses and non-infectious lung parenchymal involvement, which may mimic other disease entities thus creating potential pitfalls for the radiologist. Conclusions: Pediatric IBD is frequently associated with extraintestinal involvement. These findings may be discovered when imaging the bowel or IBD may be suspected based on the combination of intestinal and extra-intestinal findings. It is therefore important for radiologists to consider these manifestations to provide an accurate assessment of the patient to the referring physician. Purpose or Case Report: Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is characterized by permanent damage to the pancreas resulting in endocrine and exocrine deficiencies. CP is often associated with a history of acute recurrent pancreatitis. Pediatric CP is most commonly linked to known genetic mutations, such as PRSS1 or CFTR, and there is an increased risk of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in patients with hereditary pancreatitis. The mainstay of CP management involves controlling chronic pain and preserving quality of life. Total pancreatectomy and islet auto-transplantation (TPIAT) is an option for managing pain in pediatric patients with uncontrollable pain or pancreatitis secondary to genetic causes. TPIAT was first performed at the University of Minnesota in 1971. Currently there are more than 15 academic institutions in the US performing TPIAT and that number continues to rise. TPIAT has been shown to be effective for pain relief as well as maintaining insulin independence in adults and young pediatric patients. The timing of TPIAT in a patient's disease course is critical because islet cell yield is inversely correlated with pancreatic fibrosis, and postoperative diabetes outcomes depend on islet yield. Imaging prior to transplant is aimed at assessing changes of pancreatitis, vessel patency, and identifying vessel and pancreatic ductal anatomic variants. Preoperative imaging can also confirm adequate liver volume for the procedure and identify postoperative changes from previous procedures such as distal pancreatectomy or Puestow procedure (pancreaticojejunostomy). Routine postoperative imaging consists of liver Doppler ultrasound screening because elevated infusion pressures during autotransplantation can result in endothelial injury and portal vein thrombosis. Delayed gastric emptying and small bowel ileus are common postsurgical complications, and targeted crosssectional imaging, radiography, and fluoroscopy may be performed based on patient symptoms. Once bowel function has returned, enteral feeds are started via gastrojejunostomy tube and can sometimes be complicated by GJ tube-related intussusception. The largest retrospective review in pediatric patients showed a 20% surgical complication rate, with the most common complication being post-splenectomy thrombocytosis.",

Upper GI series remain the gold standard with the normal position of the duodenojejunal junction lateral to the left-sided pedicles of the vertebral body, at the level of the duodenal bulb on frontal views and posterior (retroperitoneal) on lateral views. However, a variety of conditions might influence the position of the duodenojejunal junction, potentially leading to a misdiagnosis of malrotation. Such conditions include gastric over distension, splenomegaly, renal or retroperitoneal tumors, liver transplant, small bowel obstruction, the presence of properly or malpositioned enteric tubes and scoliosis. All of these may cause the duodenojejunal junction to be displaced. We present a series of cases highlighting conditions that mimic malrotation to increase the practicing radiologist awareness and help minimize interpretation errors. Purpose or Case Report: Omental infarction and epiploic appendagitis are subtypes of a broader entity of abdominal fat necrosis known as intraperitoneal focal fat infarction (IFFI). IFFI is an uncommon cause of acute abdominal pain in children, and a known mimicker of acute appendicitis. The CT appearance of IFFI is well described, but the appearance is less familiar on MRI and is a potential imaging pitfall. Familiarity with the MRI appearance of IFFI is particularly timely, given the growing use of MRI in the evaluation of right lower quadrant pain in children.",

            "text": "Why: IHPS is the most common cause of gastric outlet obstruction and one of the most common conditions requiring surgery in infants. The exact pathogenesis of IHPS is unknown, but it is an acquired, gradual and progressive disorder. Who: The classic picture is 5 to 8-week old Caucasian male (4:1 M:F) who presents with non-bloody, non-bilious projectile vomiting. Classic physical exam findings including visible peristalsis and palpable pyloric olive are present in less than 50% cases. Delay in diagnosis can cause serious consequences. When: We can typically do US at any age at the time of the next feed and as the baby is being bottle fed (ideally). How: We use a linear 12-5 or curved 8-5 transducer, with 2D and cine imaging. The baby is placed in supine position, and we begin scanning at the epigastric region. We find the gastroesophageal junction and trace the lesser curvature of the stomach medially to find the pylorus. What: Once we find it; we measure the MWT, CL, and TDP, and look for all the signs. One way to remember the normal limits is our \"Rule of 4s\". In IHPS, MWT is more than 4mm, CL is 4x4 = 16mm, and TDP is 4+4+4 = 12+mm. The signs include target sign (hypertrophied hypoechoic muscle surrounding echogenic mucosa), shoulder/nipple sign (bulging of hypertrophied pyloric muscle into the lumen of the antrum), and double-track sign (elongated pylorus with hypoechoic lumen, sandwiched between echogenic mucosa). If the measurements do not meet our \"rule of 4s\" and there are none of the signs, we can confidently rule out IHPS, or we may consider another differential diagnosis, like pylorospasm and mucosal hypertrophy due to other causes like prostaglandins. We've come a long way with refining and defining US diagnosis of IHPS until finally ultrasound is now the gold standard diagnostic modality for IHPS. Purpose or Case Report: Iatrogenic upper gastrointestinal (GI) injuries are rare occurrences with predisposition in premature births, low birth weight, multiple attempts at OGT placement. Medical literature on the topic consists of case reports and mostly has been from the perspective of management with very limited literature on diagnostic evaluation. As the clinical presentation of such iatrogenic injuries is nonspecific, the radiographic appearance may be the only clue for diagnosis and the typical findings should be recognized and diagnosed by radiologists and neonatologists. The purpose of this presentation is to describe the radiographic findings and a diagnostic approach to guide the radiologist. A retrospective case-review was performed from 2009-2017, of neonates with upper GI injuries associated with naso/orogastric tube placement or with pharyngeal auctioning at birth (a single case). Seven cases were found comprising of five females and two males. Six of seven neonates were premature with gestational ages ranging from 24 weeks and 2 days to 28 weeks, and birth weights spanning 515-1085 grams. The 38 week neonate weighed 3500 grams. We report three types of injury: 1) posterior pharyngeal rupture, 2) non-complicated esophageal rupture with formation of a false lumen, 3) complicated esophageal rupture with penetration into the right pleural space. Management has evolved over time from a primarily surgically oriented approach to a more conservative approach involving TPN and antibiotics. Purpose or Case Report: Accidental traumatic injuries of the pancreas are rare but dangerous. In children, blunt abdominal trauma is the most common mechanism. The goal of this presentation is to review, through a series of cases, the diagnosis, imaging findings, classification, and management of accidental traumatic pancreatic injuries in children.",

Traumatic injuries, as graded by the guidelines of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma, span a gamut including contusion, laceration, transection, duct injury, ampulla injury, and massive destruction of the pancreatic head. Complications include fistula, pancreatitis, and the development of pseudocysts. Through multiple imaging modalities -including CT, MR, MRCP, ERCP, and ultrasound -our cases illustrate many of these injuries and subsequent complications. While nonoperative treatment of minor pancreatic injuries is widely accepted, the management of more severe pancreatic injuries, such as those involving the pancreatic duct, is more controversial. Duct injury, for example, has been reported to be predictive of failure of non-operative management. The radiologist, therefore, has the opportunity to play a pivotal role in patient care by characterizing the injury. Pancreatic organ and duct injuries can be subtle and correlation with multiple modalities as well as multidisciplinary discussion between the radiologist, surgeon, and gastroenterologist, are often required. Purpose or Case Report: Intussusception is a common cause of bowel obstruction in the pediatric population that is important for the radiologist to recognize. A delay in diagnosis can lead to bowel obstruction and necrosis and ultimately bowel perforation. Radiographs and sonography are the primary modalities for diagnosis of the condition. Computed tomography use is of limited use due to radiation exposure but may be helpful when a pathologic lead point is suspected. The purpose of this educational review is to describe the clinical and characteristic radiographic and sonographic findings of intussusception in the pediatric population. Classic ileocolic intussusceptions will be discussed as well as imaging features that may predict failure to reduce with air enema. Small bowel small bowel intussusceptions and intussusceptions with lead points will also be reviewed. Finally, intussusceptions due to gastrojejunostomy tubes will be discussed.",

Adjusting contrast and brightness on plain radiography allows for better visualization of the different densities and components within the FS. Conclusions: FS have become an increasingly popular toy among children this year and have been recognized as a foreign body internationally. FS comprise of small components that may lead to aspiration, small bowel obstruction and perforation, and caustic chemical injury due to the button batteries.

            "text": "Purpose or Case Report: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by repeated episodes of vaso-occlusion and hemolysis beginning in the pediatric period that result in serious multi-organ system complications. In particular, renal complications are often the cause of morbidity and reduced life expectancy of patients with SCD. Therefore, it is essential that radiologists be able to identify the imaging features early to help guide prompt and appropriate treatment. Sequelae in pediatric patients include sickle cell nephropathy, infarction and papillary necrosis, and assorted glomerulopathies. These in turn can lead to altered hemodynamics, impaired urinary concentrating ability, hematuria, proteinuria, and acute and chronic kidney injury. Children with SCD are also at increased risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria and urinary tract infection. Even those children and young adults who only have sickle cell trait (SCT) rather than SCD may develop chronic kidney disease later in life and carry markedly increased risk for renal medullary carcinoma. Segmental testicular infarction can compromise fertility in patients with both SCD and SCT. The genitourinary manifestations of SCD and SCT in the pediatric patient will be reviewed in this educational exhibit, with an emphasis on radiologic appearances. For each entity, the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and differential diagnosis of the imaging findings will also be briefly reviewed. The renal complications covered will include renal infarction, papillary necrosis, renal vein thrombosis (as a complication of nephrotic syndrome), urinary tract infection, hematuria, renal medullary carcinoma, and acute and chronic kidney disease. Testicular and penile sequelae of SCD including segmental testicular infarction and priapism will also be discussed. A variety of imaging modalities will be used to illustrate the various complications, including ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Purpose or Case Report: The ability to provide quick, realtime, easily accessible and radiation free diagnostic assessment makes ultrasound (US) imaging one of the most versatile imaging modalities. With the introduction and development of microbubble based ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) in the early 90's the ability to detect and visualize complex vascular structures became a reality, overcoming some of the limitations that were existent with grayscale and Doppler imaging. UCA's are used extensively in the adult population for visualization of vasculature and evaluating vascular kinetics in solid organs and lesions. Although contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can provide a powerful alternative approach to evaluate various pathologies in the pediatric population that would otherwise require radiation-based computed tomography (CT) or strenuous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it is important to understand the interaction between US and the microbubbles to optimize imaging and derive clinically relevant quantitative measures of vascularity.",

The gubernaculum was identified in this process. The patients were referred from NICU, maternity unit and outpatient settings. Results: These 26 male patients ranged in age from 0 days to 59 months. We examined 4 preterm and 22 full term patients. 23/26 had undescended testes. Bilateral undescended testes were seen in 20/23 patients and a unilateral undescended testis in 3/23 patients.

The gubernaculum was seen unilaterally in 8 cryptorchid boys. This provides a total of 38 gubernacula. It was not seen in 3 cryptorchid boys. The gubernaculum is homogeneous in echogenicity and less echogenic than the adjacent testis. The echo-pattern is loosely aggregated. It is soft and compressible. It is not vascular on color Doppler evaluation. It has a slippery behavior and variable shape. In cross-section, it's size is similar to or slightly greater than the testis. It lies distal to and contiguous with the testis. It can be demonstrated passing to and through the internal (deep) ring, into the inguinal canal and to the base of the scrotum, therefore it's length varies.

            "text": "Purpose or Case Report: The complete ultrasound (US) evaluation of the urinary tract in a pediatric patient should include both the urinary bladder and kidneys. Evaluation of the bladder as part of that overall US examination, however, can be deemphasized or incomplete due a number of factors, such as one's neglecting to fully image the bladder from dome to bladder neck, suboptimal bladder distension, incomplete distension due to presence of an indwelling drainage catheter or vesicostomy, or in some instances, because the bladder is not included as part of the routine kidney ultrasound exam. True masses arising from the urinary bladder in children are generally rare, and at times, subtle and non-specific, and potentially mimicked by so-called pseudomasses, so we emphasize that correlation of findings with patient history is of paramount importance. This pictorial review will illustrate and describe the US appearances (along with selective cross-sectional imaging), clinical manifestations, and tumor growth patterns of common and uncommon conditions arising from the pediatric urinary bladder, i.e. path-proven masses that include leiomyosarcoma, pheochromocytoma, nephrogenic adenoma, vascular malformation, low grade urothelial neoplasms, neurofibromatosis, fibroepithelial polyps, rhabdoid tumor, and rhabdomyosarcoma. Pseudomasses of the bladder that will also be illustrated and briefly discussed include hematomas, urachal remnants, complex ureteroceles, Deflux injection sites, foreign bodies, and cystitis (viral, eosinophilic, parasitic) . In addition to emphasizing the importance of the complete bladder examination, the purpose of this review is to increase radiologist's awareness of the US appearances of the common and uncommon conditions which afflict the pediatric urinary bladder, as well as those conditions that can mimic bladder masses, in order to determine proper clinical management. Purpose or Case Report: The duplication of structures in the body has been a curious topic to the field of medicine for centuries. It is rare to find a radiologist who has not seen at least one duplicated or partially duplicated organ, usually of the genitourinary system, and often incidentally. While implications of GU duplication have been study previously, often due to infertility or renal issues, other organ system duplications and their implications to the patient often remain a mystery.",

In 2008, there was not a single Ethiopian pediatric radiologist in a country of 100 million people, where 60% of the population is under the age of 20. As such, children are a major population for diagnostic imaging and the majority of radiologists are confronted with pediatric imaging. However, there was a lack of emphasis on much-needed training of pediatric imaging in radiology residencies. With an increasing number of pediatric subspecialties, the need for adequate pediatric imaging service had grown. This was particularly true at Black Lion Hospital (BLH), the country's main referral center, affiliated with Addis Ababa University (AAU). Radiology faculty at AAU saw value in a pediatric radiology fellowship. The partnership goals between CHOP and AAU were to support and expand the pediatric radiology component in the BLH radiology residency and to carry out regular national pediatric radiology continuing medical education. The purpose of our project was to establish an accredited local pediatric radiology fellowship training in the Department of Radiology at BLH.",

Results: A two-year fellowship was successfully launched with its primary base in Addis Ababa, with components of distance learning, local instruction, a limited observership at CHOP, and pediatric radiology-focused research requirements. The training culminated in a final oral examination conducted by international visiting faculty. In 2017, Ethiopia graduated its first two pediatric radiologists after two years of fellowship. They are currently based at BLH, established a Pediatric Radiology Section with a director, and are actively recruiting the next fellow candidates. Conclusions: Establishing a pediatric radiology fellowship through outreach is both doable and feasible. Our experience showed the request for a fellowship must arise from the host country. In order to optimize success, one must identify the needs of key stakeholders in the host country, engage them in the process, ensure accreditation, and base the fellowship there. Purpose or Case Report: Learning the skills used to master pediatric fluoroscopic exams can be challenging. Hand-eye coordination and specific timing is required while at the same time being mindful of radiation dose and interpreting the images generated in real time. Training on live neonates will often mean less diagnostic exams and increased radiation dose for those exams.",

While more research is needed to identify the causes and extent of the problem, there is an urgent need for educating physicians at different levels of training across different specialties regarding identification, imaging, and management of child abuse. Purpose or Case Report: This educational exhibit will review 1) challenges of CT imaging near metal, 2) current acquisition and reconstruction methods for reducing metallic artifacts, and 3) our initial experience using a GE Revolution CT system for Dual-energy scanning combined with metal artifact reduction (MAR) image reconstruction. Artifacts caused by metallic implants have limited clinical diagnoses for decades using single-energy CT (single kVp, polyenergetic beam) with standard image reconstruction. Low-energy photons in the beam are absorbed by metal, leaving only high-energy photons passing through (ie. beam hardening). Beam hardening due to metal, along with photon starvation and scatter, result in dark shading and bright/dark streaking, as well as lower signal-to-noise levels. Dual-energy CT (DECT) has demonstrated promise for beam hardening reduction because it enables reconstruction of a monoenergetic image, similar in theory to acquiring data with a monoenergetic beam. Recent developments in CT data reconstruction have also achieved better image quality near metal by mitigating shading and streaking artifacts. On our Revolution CT, MAR reconstruction is available solely in dualenergy mode. For our patients with metallic prostheses, we perform DECT and review monoenergetic images with and without MAR. MAR images typically show markedly reduced artifacts from metal and thereby improved image quality. Fig 1  displays 70 keV monoenergetic images both with and without MAR for a patient with a pacemaker. Streaking artifacts arising from the pacemaker were apparent throughout anatomy without MAR, while significantly reduced streaking and improved visualization of the aortic bifurcation is observed in the MAR reconstructed image. Images from a patient with pedicle screws and metallic rods in the spine are shown in Fig 2. Although present, shading and streaking was noticeably reduced with MAR allowing better visibility of the paraspinal soft-tissue structures and the main portal vein. On occasion, however, MAR yielded more severe artifacts for certain slices, such as in the thigh for a patient with a metallic femoral rod just above a total knee replacement (Fig 3) . In summary, recent technical advancements incorporated into the Revolution CT system have improved image quality for many of our patients with metallic implants. Predicting a priori when MAR will be worse is not yet possible, so viewing monoenergetic images with and without MAR is recommended.",

In Rwanda, the pediatric specialty is especially critical due to the high pediatric population as the country continues to recover from the 1994 genocide. Approximately 12 months of general radiology training, visiting faculty offered a two-month rotation in pediatric radiology. To assess efficacy, a pre-and post-rotation evaluation program was implemented. Objective, case-based tests consisting of 100 cases were implemented on the first and last day of the eight-week rotation, which comprised from nine to fifteen hours of formal lecture and case-based teaching each week. A paired t-test was used to compare pre-and post-rotation test results.View box examination scores for four first-year residents were recorded.

Furthermore, the sterile field created for catheter placement is typically maintained during the time of image acquisition and review, and the time lag in imaging interpretation may increase risk for procedure-related infection. US-guided UC placement has been demonstrated to have equal or often better ability to identify accurate catheter tip positioning, with the added benefit of being performed real-time during the procedure, significantly limiting delays in care and radiation exposure.

The femur is normally 10-20 degrees anteverted. Both decreased and increased femoral version are associated with FAI. The method for calculating femoral version is explained in Fig. 3 . Purpose or Case Report: The number of reconstruction surgeries of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in pediatric patients has risen dramatically over the past two decades as a result of changes in treatment philosophy and perhaps frequency of injury. It is therefore important for pediatric radiologists to recognize the normal postoperative appearance of the different surgeries as well as their complications. This educational exhibit will review the types of reconstructive methods used in both skeletally immature and mature patients (physeal-sparing, partial transphyseal and transphyseal), complications (growth disturbances, graft failure, impingement, arthrofibrosis, intraarticular bodies) and relevant imaging findings on plain radiography and MRI.",

Many children with a positive skeletal survey will undergo a 14-day follow up survey. The purpose of this study is to share our experience on patterns of CML healing by comparing the primary survey with its follow up. We have identified a few distinct patterns: Bone formation and sclerosis along the proximal metaphyseal zone, angular deformity of the metaphyseal corner, and subchondral metaphyseal lucencies. These patterns are represented by the accompanying supplemental figures and are described below. Figure 1 is the 14-day follow up radiograph of an acute distal tibial CML diagnosed on the primary skeletal survey. This radiograph reveals increased sclerosis along the entire length of the metaphyseal zone, a common pattern of CML healing. Figure 2 is 14-day follow up of a different patient who sustained a CML of the distal tibia. Healing in this case is denoted by the angular deformity and periosteal reaction along the metaphyseal corner. Figure 3 is a radiograph of the left wrist from a patient's primary skeletal survey. The subchondral lucency identified along the lateral metaphysis is another common pattern indicative of a healing CML. Interestingly, the 14-day follow up skeletal survey of this patient demonstrated complete resolution of this finding with no signs of prior injury. In several other cases, the metaphysis on follow up exam appeared completely normal.",

This educational poster will address normal coracoid anatomy and development, as well as pathologic conditions affecting the coracoid in the pediatric population, including fractures, infection, and neoplasm. The coracoid is a beak-like projection that extends anteriorly from the ventral scapula. It serves as the origin for the pectoralis minor, coracobrachialis, and short head of the biceps. Ligamentous attachments extend from the coracoid to the clavicle (coracoclavicular ligaments), acromion (coracoacromial ligament), and humerus (coracohumeral ligament). Additionally, the transverse scapular ligament attaches to the coracoid base.",

The coracoid appears within the first year of life with fusion of the coracoid base growth plate occurring by age 14 to 15. Physeal injuries occur at the base of the coracoid with imaging characteristics similar to other more typical locations (i.e. the proximal humerus in Little Leaguer's shoulder). Key features include physeal widening with irregular bony margins, thought to be secondary to chronic repetitive pull from the attached musculature. Additionally, coracoid fractures occur in acute trauma and can be easily overlooked as they are frequently associated with other fractures. Direct blunt trauma by either an external object or the humeral head are associated with fractures of the base of the coracoid. Avulsions of the coracoid tip are seen with acromioclavicular separations with injury to the cocacoclavicular ligaments, more commonly seen in the pediatric population as the ligaments are relatively stronger than their osseous attachments. While tumors of the coracoid are rare and more commonly occur in adults, primary tumors of the coracoid are seen in the pediatric population with case reports of osteoid osteomas, osteoblastomas, giant cell tumors, and aneurysmal bone cysts. Awareness of pathology affecting the coracoid process is helpful to the radiologist and clinician caring for the child with shoulder pain.",

After reviewing the interactive case series, the viewer will learn the imaging characteristics of the most common CPP pathologies and will be better equipped to identify these lesions in their work routine. Purpose or Case Report: The clinical implications of craniosynostoses reach far beyond their striking cosmetic deformities. If untreated, craniosynostoses can lead to increased intracranial pressure, restriction of brain growth, and developmental delay, making the recognition of the findings and appropriate diagnosis critical. This electronic poster will provide an overview of various craniosynostoses including trigonocephaly, scaphocephaly, plagiocephaly, brachycephaly, and the various combinations of abnormally fused sutures, with an emphasis on 3D reconstruction imaging. In addition, the expected timing of the fusion of sutures will be described, as well as potential pitfalls in the interpretation of craniosynostosis, including metopic ridge. A brief review of Crouzon, Pfeiffer, and Apert syndromes, those syndromes most commonly associated with craniosynostosis, will be provided. Purpose or Case Report: Epilepsy can be a progressive, debilitating illness, particularly in the pediatric population. More than half of brain tumors are associated with epilepsy, and 30% of these tumors will not respond to pharmacologic therapy. Recognizing lesions that cause seizures is imperative, as providing an accurate diagnosis can identify patients with surgically treatable disease. In the appropriate patient population, epilepsy surgery can be an effective management option that prevents significant morbidity and mortality from epilepsy and dramatically improves quality of life. This electronic poster will provide an overview of pediatric epileptogenic tumors including gangliogliomas, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors, pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, papillary glioneuronal tumor, pilocytic astrocytoma, and oligodendroglioma. Cases featuring these tumors and their distinguishing characteristics will be reviewed, as both tumor subtype and location contribute to the epileptogenicity of pediatric brain tumors. The goal of this poster is to provide a framework for the evaluation of pediatric epileptogenic tumors to establish a focused differential diagnosis when these lesions are identified. This is particularly important for trainees and well as those who do not commonly encounter epileptogenic tumors in their practice.",

            "text": "Purpose or Case Report: Pediatric cervical spine trauma, although rare with an incidence of only 1-2%, can have very high morbidity and mortality. The leading causes are motor vehicle collision, sports related injury and child abuse in infants. The incidence of upper cervical spine injury is more common in children than adults due to differences in biomechanics, with the pediatric head size being proportionally larger when compared to adults. Although conventional radiographs remain the standard initial imaging evaluation, CT has become an important modality to detect bony injury and subtle signs of underlying ligamentous injury and hemorrhage (although consideration must be made for the increased radiation exposure). The presence of ligamentous injury, dens synchondrosis fracture, spinal cord evaluation, and spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA), meanwhile, are better evaluated with MRI. We will review the normal appearance of the pediatric cervical spine including normal measurements on radiographs and CT, including the importance of the basion-dens interval, powers ratio, and atlanto-occipital distance with illustrations. The normal development of the cervical spine as well as CT and MRI anatomy of cervical spine ligaments will be reviewed with illustrations. Imaging findings of atlanto-occipital and atlantoaxial distraction and pediatric cervical spine fractures including clay shoveler's fracture and dens synchondrosis fractures will be illustrated with CT and MRI. Finally, a review of clinical decision criteria for pediatric cervical spine trauma and imaging approach will be presented. The importance of obtaining MRI in children under 5 years and appropriate use of imaging will also be discussed. Image 1: Sagittal CT image demonstrates increased basion to dens distance and normal atlanto-dental interval, consistent with atlanto-occipital dissociation.

Conclusions: MRI scanners use powerful magnets to create high resolution images. MRI safety is always paramount, and patients with implanted devices that are deemed MRI conditional, such as particular types of CIs, may be safely scanned with MRI only under very specific conditions, which will be reviewed in detail. Artifacts created by the implants can be extensive and we will also review artifact-reduction strategies. It must be emphasized that scanning patients with CIs without strictly adhering to the stipulated manufacturer's guidelines may result in severe patient injury and/or device malfunction. The objective of this electronic exhibit is to present the clinical and imaging findings of vascular tumors encountered in a large children's hospital over a 10-year period. These will be grouped according to the ISSVA benign, locally-aggressive, and malignant classification of vascular tumors. We will include unusual presentations of infantile and congenital hemangiomas, as well as the clinical features and imaging appearances of the less commonly encountered vascular tumors (tufted angioma, spindle cell hemangioma, pyogenic granuloma, epithelioid hemangioma, kaposiform hemangioendothelioma, and angiosarcoma). Treatment options and prognosis will also be discussed. Staging System. The new system shifts away from surgicopathologic classification to describe tumors according to radiologic findings. In addition to differentiating local from metastatic disease, the new system further delineates local disease based on the presence or absence of \"image defined risk factors\" (IDRF). With this, there is a recommendation for specific terminology to be used in order to accurately characterize an IDRF. These include the words: separation, contact, encasement, compression, infiltration, and invasion. Conclusions: As the care for Neuroblastoma patients evolves, radiologists must continue to provide value in the multidisciplinary efforts to advance the most up to date approach to staging of the disease. Now more than ever, the use of accurate and uniform language in reports will have a significant impact on the treatment of these patients. Conclusion: Through this exhibit, readers will gain familiarity with technical aspects of DECT of the lungs in children, understand the basics of post processing and recognize focal or regional perfusion defects, segmented perfusion analysis, and focal lesion perfusion characteristics as well as identify future applications. Purpose or Case Report: Interpretation of chest radiographs requires a good understanding of anatomy, the physiology of the lungs and cardiovascular system as well as good pattern recognition. Additionally, it requires a systematic approach to search for pathologies and pertinent clinical details for interpretation. With frequent use of CT / MRI, the residents (and even practicing radiologists) have become less skilled in the interpretation of chest x-rays, making one of the most commonly ordered exams the most challenging. With challenges of decreasing radiation exposure (especially in pediatric population), it is important that the relatively lost skill set of chest radiographs interpretation be revisited, for trainees (radiology and non-radiology services) and the practitioners.

Extracted data includes mechanism of trauma, clinical presentation, imaging performed, treatment and outcomes. Data was compared with the adult population. Results: On Sonography, ICLH typically appears as loss of fascial plane delineation involving the external, internal and innermost intercostal muscles. The degree of disruption of this latticework of structures and the resulting loss of structural support determines the severity of the lung herniation, which is best depicted on real time assessment with utilization of maneuvers to increase intrathoracic pressures. ICLH usually presents as a soft non-tender mass exaggerated by coughing and/or straining and may present long after the initial injury. ICLH was located in the anterior chest wall in 81% of pediatric patients. The most common mechanism of trauma was blunt handlebar injury. Chest radiograph was used to diagnosis in 88% and CT scanning in 44% of patients. Sonography was utilized in 19% of cases. Management was surgical in 63% of patients, with thoracotomy with primary closure the preferred treatment. The remainder of the patients received non-surgical management with chest strapping, with resolution in 2-6 weeks. Conclusions: Given the rarity of ICLH in pediatric patients and the lack of diagnostic and management guidelines, pediatric surgeons have mostly relied on published reports in the adult literature to guide work-up and management. The recent literature supports the feasibility of non-surgical management and the proposed imaging guidelines (Fig. 1) Purpose or Case Report: Stillbirth is a sad complication of pregnancy. Establishing the cause of death in intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) is important to bring psychological closure to the family and crucial for reproductive counseling. The gold standard to establish the cause of IUFD is perinatal autopsy. However, perinatal autopsy rates are falling worldwide, largely attributed to patients and physicians discomfort with death and discussion of postmortem examinations as well as social and religious reasons. There is a lack of experience with minimally invasive perinatal autopsy in the United States and even more limited publications in the subject. Our main goal was to investigate the added value of postmortem MRI to conventional autopsy in the clinical setting. Our program has had successes and failures, of which learning opportunities exist for other institutions that desire to implement similar programs. This paper will discuss the timeline of our progress and share examples of potential roadblocks and keys to success in implementing such a program.",

We sought out a partnership with the anatomic pathology department to brainstorm how we could work together to contribute to the growing body of research in the postmortem diagnostic branch of medicine. We received IRB approval in 2014 and started meeting with the bereavement specialists and maternal fetal medicine physicians to identify prospective subjects. Results: Since then, we have continued to adjust our protocol and inclusion criteria to optimize our number of subjects.

Conclusions: Our data demonstrates the potential utility of a free-breathing accelerated 3D T1w RAVE sequence in unsedated pediatric imaging.

The exact pathogenesis of NAFLD remains poorly understood, though it is known to progress to various chronic liver diseases, the most prevalent being hepatic fibrosis. The current gold standard for quantifying fat in the liver is via a core biopsy, which is expensive and carries an inherent risk of morbidity and mortality which makes it unsuitable for screening and monitoring purposes. We propose that MRI can be an effective, fast, and non-invasive method of screening and monitoring pediatric NAFLD.

Purpose or Case Report: Although ultrasound has advantages for bowel assessment in infants, the majority of bowel evaluation still takes place by radiograph. Although radiographic signs of advanced necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) have been well documented, there is poor understanding of gas patterns in less severe NEC or other causes of feeding intolerance. Progressively abnormal appearance of gas patterns in NEC has been described, but it is unclear what role a gastric sump plays.

To assess how the sump affected progression of bowel gas pattern, we randomly selected 11 infants with 5 -20 radiographs for the above indications performed < 24 hours from each prior. We evaluated supine radiographs using the Duke Abdominal Assessment Score (DAAS) and noted sump presence in the images. Chi-square tests assessed differences in proportions of infants with presence/absence of sump having positive/negative DAAS score. Results: Our review included 107 exams on 11 patients. DAAS score 4 (Separation or focal thickening of bowel loops) was associated with presence of a sump in 88% of exams (p = 0.01). DAAS scores 0 (Normal gas pattern) and 2 (Moderate distention) were associated with absence of a sump in 62% of exams (p < 0.01) and 78% of exams (p < 0.05), respectively. DAAS score 3 (Focal moderate distention of bowel loops) had a trending significance with a sump present in 77% of exams (p = 0.07). Remainder of the DAAS scores \u2264 7 had no association with sump. No DAAS scores > 7 were recorded in our study.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Presence of a sump was associated with the appearance of separation or focal thickening of bowel loops and may correlate with focal moderate distention in a larger sample. It is therefore worth considering whether these gas patterns truly represent progression of disease or simply bowel decompression with a sump. In such cases, ultrasound may help differentiate fluid-filled bowel from partially decompressed bowel. A better understanding of the pathophysiology underlying these gas patterns may help guide management before the advanced stage of NEC. (2014) (2015) (2016) . Patient records were reviewed for pertinent clinical information and information related to the GJ-tube including type of tube, presenting symptoms of GJI, and management of the GJI. Results: During the study period, a total of 123 patients had at least one GJ-tube tube placed or replaced. Of those patients, 17 developed a GJI. The median patient age was 3.3 years (range 0.4-15.1 years). All patients had complex medical histories ( Table 1 ). The last tube manipulation prior to intussusception occurred a median of 38 days prior to GJI, with 8 occurring <30 days after manipulation, and 5 occurring between 30-60 days after manipulation. Imaging was obtained after suspicious signs and symptoms (Table 2) . Abdominal ultrasound was ordered and diagnosed 10 cases (56%), CT 6 cases, and MRI 2 cases. There was a wide variety of tubes seen in patients with GJI (Table 3) . The initial management plan included GJ-tube removal in 11 patients, removal and replacement of a different tube in 3 patients, and monitoring in 4 patients, 2 of which were asymptomatic. A total of 9 patients either kept or required their GJ-tube be replaced, with replacement an average of 10.8 days after GJI. In 50% of patients, gastrostomy tube feeds were tolerated and replacement of the GJ-tube was not required. Conclusions: Given intussusceptions were observed across various GJ tubes, a specific device safety issue was not identified. We found a 14% rate of intussusception in our complex patient population, which is similar to previously published GJI rates. An unexpected finding was that 50% of patients went on to tolerate gastrostomy tube feeds, not requiring replacement of their GJ tube. A positive outcome of our research project has been an increased awareness of this complication throughout the hospital, and after education an increased utilization of abdominal ultrasound in patients with GJ-tubes and any suspicious symptoms.",

All patients underwent 2 RUS and 2 DR. Patients were excluded for comorbidities associated with bladder-level dysfunction, uninterpretable DR, or diuretic usage during only one RUS. Each RUS was paired with a contemporaneous DR and compared with a subsequent study pair. All studies were reviewed by an independent, blinded diagnostic radiologist. Change in hydronephrosis was determined by either (1) change in SFU/UTD grade or (2) any change noted by the radiologist. This was compared with change in DR, with a \u22655% change considered significant. Chi-squared and Spearman's correlation analyses were performed. Results: 85 patients aged 0-14 years (mean 12 months) were included in the final analysis. Patients were predominantly male (73%) with SFU 3/UTD P2 hydronephrosis (85%). Time between DR ranged from 1-112 months (mean 20). Worsening hydronephrosis was noted in 10/85 patients (12%) by SFU/UTD grade and in 28/85 patients (33%) by radiologist interpretation. Differential renal function decreased by \u22655% in 15/85 patients (18%). Changes in DR were significantly associated with changes in SFU/UTD grade on RUS among all patients (p=0.004, Table 1 ) and among patients with SFU 3/UTD P2 hydronephrosis (p=0.005, Table 2 ). Less substantial changes were not associated with DR findings (p=0.2). 10/70 (13%) patients with stable or improved SFU/UTD grade developed worsening renal function during the study period. When RUS and DR were directly compared, the Spearman's correlation was poor (r=0.2, CI [0.03-0.4]). Conclusions: While substantial changes in RUS findings were associated with corollary changes on DR, the overall correlation between imaging modalities was poor. 13% of children with SFU 3-4/UTD P2-3 hydronephrosis experienced a loss of renal function despite stable longitudinal RUS imaging. These findings are important to consider when counseling conservatively managed patients followed without DR. spatial resolution allow for better identification and measurement of ovaries and precise measurements and depictions of anatomic details.

Although not completely understood, pathogenesis of this coagulopathy, termed localized intravascular coagulopathy (LIC), is presumed secondary to stagnant blood in abnormal vessels and consumption of coagulation factors. LIC is characterized by elevated D-dimer, low fibrinogen, and/or mild thrombocytopenia and may progress to disseminated intravascular coagulopathy following surgical procedures.

Hematologic complications included any clinically relevant bleeding or clotting abnormality that occurred 2 weeks post-sclerotherapy and/or while on LMWH prophylaxis, up to 2 weeks, prior to sclerotherapy. Relevant hematuria included gross and large microscopic hematuria. Use of LMWH including dose, frequency and course length was evaluated. Results: Forty of 300 patients had slow-flow vascular malformations with associated LIC and underwent a total of 241 sclerotherapy procedures. In 87% of cases, LMWH was administered at 0.5mg/kg/dose once daily for 2 weeks before and after sclerotherapy. One patient on LMWH developed pulmonary emboli, presumably from deep vein thrombosis of the treated extremity. Two patients developed transient, asymptomatic hematuria. In 5 patients fibrinogen levels dropped below 100 mg/dL post-sclerotherapy for which cryoprecipitate was administered. No intra-op bleeding or thrombotic events occurred. Conclusions: Prophylactic LMWH use was common in this patient population and did not appear to increase the risk of significant bleeding before, during or after sclerotherapy. In children receiving LMWH, thrombotic complications after sclerotherapy appear rare but may still occur. Purpose or Case Report: Ultrasound guided percutaneous liver biopsy is frequently performed in pediatric patients. Published post-biopsy complication rates range between 0.3 -3.3% according to Society of Interventional Radiology Standards of Practice. Post-biopsy tract embolization has been prophylactically used to theoretically decrease the bleeding risk, but is not the current standard of care at our institution. The goal of this study is to determine if there is a need for prophylactic biopsy tract-embolization after ultrasound guided liver biopsy in the pediatric population.",

Majority of patients had a liver biopsy for increased liver enzymes (n=115, 55.8%) and 74 (5.4%) for prior liver transplant. Pre-and post-biopsy hemoglobin (Hgb) values were evaluated and one (0.2%) subject experienced a Hgb drop of >2.0 g/dL, twenty (3.6%) subjects experienced a Hgb drop of >1.0 g/dL and six (7.23%) subjects did not have a change in Hgb pre-and post-biopsy.

Management of recurrent biliary stenosis, percutaneous or surgical, was tracked. Variables of interest included transplant graft type, location of biliary stricture, time to drainage catheter removal, and number of recurrences. Results: Subjects included 32 males and 41 females with a mean age at transplant of 3.4 years and median follow-up of 5.7 years. The most common etiology of liver failure leading to liver transplant was biliary atresia (n=37). 64% of patients (n=47) were successfully managed percutaneously, including 43% (n=32) successfully managed via a single trial. Success rate did not significantly decrease with subsequent trials of percutaneous treatment. Success rate of PTC was higher in anastomotic strictures than in non-anastomotic strictures (71% vs. 31% success rate, p<0.01). Conclusions: Percutaneous management of biliary strictures complicating pediatric liver transplantation allows for successful treatment of most patients, precluding the need for surgical revision. An optimal treatment protocol remains unknown, but we have shown that a minimal dwell time of 3 months is sufficient. (6 patients) all with conventional spinal rods and some degree of spinal fusion required either CT or CBCT. The remainder of the procedures were performed with conventional fluoroscopy. 14 procedures (5 patients with conventional spinal rods), required trans-foraminal approach. After initial procedures were performed with CBCT or CT guidance, several patients had subsequent procedure performed with conventional fluoroscopy utilizing a trans-foraminal approach. 71 of the 73 procedures (97%) were technically successful with intrathecal injection. The two non-successful procedures were initially performed with conventional fluoroscopy and subsequently performed with technical success using CT (one with trans-foraminal approach). One complication of a CSF leak and one complication of persistent back pain 5 days post procedure were identified. Both complications were self-limited and resolved. Conclusions: In SMA patients with complex scoliosis or extensive spinal hardware with fusion, successful intrathecal can be achieved utilizing a trans-formainal or trans-pedicle approach. Some patients may require CBCT with fluoroscopy overlay or conventional CT with CT fluoroscopy and laser guide. Results: 25 hips in 21 patients (16 female, 5 males, mean age 0.99 years, range 0.4-3.1 years) were included in our study. The mean follow-up period was 2.7 years (range 0.7-5.1 years). 8 of 25 hips (32%) went on to develop osteonecrosis. The development of epiphyseal osteonecrosis was more likely with <80% enhancement (sensitivity 87.5%, specificity 88.25%, positive predictive value 78%, negative predictive value 94%). The mean contrast enhancement for patients developing osteonecrosis compared to those who did not was 37.5% and 86.5% respectively; p=0.001. The development of epiphyseal osteonecrosis trended, but was not statistically significant when the abduction angle was greater than 55 degrees (P=0.1). The odds of osteonecrosis is 9% lower with every 1% increase of perfusion. There were 3 hips (12%) that underwent reintervention based on the immediate post-reduction SPICA MRI results. For this subset, one (33%) went on to develop epiphyseal osteonecrosis.",

When discovered later through radiographic survey, the time since injury (TSI) may be important for the medical diagnosis of physical abuse and have implications for child protection. Prior research suggests that clinical and biological variables, such as fracture location and age, may influence pediatric fracture healing. However, radiographic determination of TSI has been poorly studied until recently. It has been commonly understood that in general younger patients heal faster and lower extremity fractures heal slower than upper extremity fractures. However, the influence of patient age and fracture location on fracture healing has only been explored on a limited scale and not between pediatric age groups.

Abuse-related fractures and individuals with co-morbidities or disorders affecting bone were excluded. Subperiosteal new bone formation (SPNBF) and callus were evaluated along with the time to complete healing. The presence, thickness, matrix, and character were recorded based on modified parameters set by Walters et al. (2014) . Results: Independence and goodness of fit frequency tests revealed correlations between age and the thickness and character of SPNBF as well as callus matrix and fracture margin definition, in addition to within bone location and bone type and rate of healing. Mean comparisons reveal significant differences in callus matrix thickness between younger and older age groups (p < 0.001). Statistical tests reveal no significant differences between sex and other variables of fracture healing. Conclusions: These results may provide an improved method of determining the age of fractures and TSI. Future research may provide better guidelines for radiographic characterization of fracture healing, and improved confidence in the estimation of TSI. Methods & Materials: Two musculoskeletal radiologists evaluated high resolution (HR), 3-dimensional with multiplanar reconstruction (MPR), and radially reformatted (RR) magnetic resonance images (MRI) of 33 patients who later underwent surgical treatment for FAI. Raters reviewed each MRI sequence for the presence of labral tear or injury to the transition zone or true acetabular cartilage as well as the size of the injury. An orthopedic surgeon reviewed intra operative images to assess for intra articular injury. Bland-Altman methods were used to estimate agreement between the percentage of hips affected by injury as measured by MRI relative to direct visualization. Bias or mean difference between MRI and arthroscopic visualization as well as the limit of agreement was also calculated for each of the three formats in assessing size of injury. The 12 o'clock to 2 o'clock positions within the acetabulum were used for comparison, the most common locations for intra-articular pathology in femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). Results: MPR was most accurate at identifying labral injuries (accuracy: 88%, sensitivity: 92%, specificity: 25%) compared to HR (accuracy: 82%, sensitivity: 87%, specificity: 0%) and RR (accuracy: 83%, sensitivity: 89%, specificity: 0%). MPR (accuracy: 38%, sensitivity: 38%, specificity: 50%) and RR formats (accuracy: 38%, sensitivity: 38%, specificity: 50%) were also more accurate at identifying transition zone injuries compared to HR images (accuracy: 29%, sensitivity: 27%, specificity: 100%). HR was more accurate at identifying articular cartilage injuries (accuracy: 65%, sensitivity: 40%, specificity: 76%) compared to MPR (accuracy: 56%, sensitivity: 30%, specificity: 67%) and RR (accuracy: 61%, sensitivity: 40%, specificity: 70%) formats. MPR had performed best in determining the size of labral injury (bias -0.10), while MPR and RR performed best in identifying transition zone (bias -0.06) and acetabular cartilage (bias -0.31) injuries. Conclusions: Labral injuries were best identified with the MPR format while transition zone cartilage injuries were best identified with MPR and RR formats, and the HR format was best to identify true articular cartilage pathology. 3D with MPR and RR are a less commonly utilized though beneficial approach in the evaluation of the labrum and transition zone injuries. Purpose or Case Report: MRI is the gold standard for the diagnosis of acute septic sacroiliitis. However, appropriate timing of the procedure has not been addressed in the literature. MRI is highly sensitive for detecting long tubular bone osteomyelitis as early as 24-48 hours of symptom onset. The hypothesis of this study is that the onset of bone marrow edema of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) of pelvis might be delayed as compared with long bone. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the optimum timing of MRI examination from the onset of disease.",

We separated the data into age bins (0-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-11, 12-14, 15-17 years), and nonlinearly co-registered the studies to an age-matched MRI atlas by age (18 mo, 4 yr, 7 yr, 10 yr, 13 yr, 16 yr) using BioImage Suite. Within each age bin, each registered brain image was normalized such that the mean of the PET voxels within the MRI mask was the same across patients. The mean and standard deviation for each age bin formed the normative atlas. This atlas was applied to PET brain studies performed for epilepsy assessment (n=10). Assessment of the epilepsy studies followed the same processing as entries for the atlas (registration, normalization within each age bin), and were then compared to the normative atlas in terms of ratio from mean and number of standard deviations from mean (z-scoring). The detection performance was evaluating by comparing the automatically identified epileptic zones to the original radiologist report. Results: Results: The FDG PET atlas was generated with 84 normal studies and tested with 10 abnormal epilepsy exams (age 2-16 yrs). The radiologist reports identified 15 epileptic foci in the abnormal studies. Using regions exceeding 4 standard deviations as a threshold for epileptic foci, the automatic identification with the normative atlas identified 14 of these sites (93% Sensitivity) and also identified 7 additional false positive sites. Conclusions: Conclusions: An age-matched normative FDG PET Brain database can provide a highly sensitive tool to help identify FDG PET abnormalities in epilepsy exams.

It usually develops within the first days following birth. NEC is a gastrointestinal disease, that can affect any part of the large or small bowel but most commonly affects the terminal ileum and colon. It causes inflammation and tissue death of the affected area and can lead to bowel perforations and a need for surgical resections. In severe cases, bacteria and waste products can pass through the perforated intestine and enter the baby's bloodstream or abdominal cavity which can cause a life threatening infection and shock. In a pediatric hospital, that treats premature infants, signs and symptoms of necrotizing enterocolitis are very important to diagnose quickly. Most common symptoms include poor feeds, bloating or swelling in the abdomen, bloody stools and diarrhea. In order to manage the disease medically and surgically, prompt diagnostic tests such as ultrasounds and xrays need to be performed. Abdominal X-rays are the gold standard of diagnosis and treatment planning. Therefore it is crucial, to recognize the radiographic signs of NEC. The purpose of this abstract is to describe radiographic appearances associated with NEC, which include: dilated bowel loops, thickened bowel walls with edema, pneumatosis intestinalis, abdominal free air, portal venous gas, absence of bowel gas.

During this stage the intestines normally migrate back into the abdominal wall following a brief period where they are temporarily located in the base of the umbilical cord. As the intestines returns to the abdomen it makes two rotations and becomes fixed into its normal position. The small bowel is located in the center of the abdomen and the large intestine drapes around the top and sides of the small intestine. When rotation is incomplete and intestinal fixation does not occur, this creates a defect known as malrotation. Malrotation occurs in one of every 500 births in the United States. Up to 40 percent of patients with this show signs of the disease within the first week of life. By one month of age 50-60 percent are diagnosed. 75 to 90 percent are diagnosed by age 1. The remaining cases are diagnosed into adulthood. Some symptoms of malrotation include vomiting and bilious emesis, fussiness, crying in pain, a swollen abdomen that's tender to the touch, fever, diarrhea and bloody stool or none at all. If malrotation is not treated, it can lead or turn into a midgut Recognition/retention, education opportunities for staff, staff support to our patients, having input into decisions and communication within the department.

We set up eight committees which balanced staff and the following leadership concerns: Recognition and retention, Patient centered care, Policy and procedures, Ancillary partnerships, Education, Quality improvement, Research/Equipment and Imaging protocols. Each group provided a mission, developed by them. Meetings and, topics are managed by staff. . Committees are supported by Team Leaders in the form of coverage to attend meetings, time to work on projects, dollars for projects, and ensuring that solutions meet hospital standards and policies. Leadership views this as a great opportunity to vet complaints and process and work issues to these groups to look for solutions. Conclusions: Challenges associated with the introduction of a nurse driven professional practice model into a technologist practice model suggests that greater attention to implementation may be required much more than a top down approach.",

Six staff members, across different shifts, were identified as Super Users and trained based on the Operation Manual provided by the manufacturer. Competency was deemed through staff demonstration of operating the remote control cars safely and practicing all safety measures associated with patient riders. The riders must wear the safety belt, keep all body parts inside the vehicle, be age three years or older and weigh under 60 pounds. There is a switch to deactivate the foot pedals; however there is not a mechanism to deactivate the steering wheel. Therefore, patients are asked to place their hands by their sides. Another consideration was storage of the cars, as multiple cars require a significant amount of space for parking and electrical outlet needs for recharging the batteries. Storing the cars in a publicly accessible location was not ideal for safety concerns. Ultimately, an alcove by a set of elevators was selected for easy access by staff during the day and the MRI Mock Scanner Room was utilized for recharging at night.",

A video posting on Facebook resulted in a local news story highlighting the cars and the fun experience for one patient, thus providing marketing exposure affirmative of the care being provided. The project returned favorable results, prompting the facility to add the rideable cars to a wish list that is shared with charitable donors. A total of 20 cars are now available for use throughout Radiology and other departments across the system. Conclusions: While the project initially centered on the reduction of patient anxiety, additional benefits identified were stress alleviation for the parents and entertainment for patient's siblings. The ride from the Radiology Waiting Room to the exam room also allowed the technologists to develop a rapport with the patient that allowed for more cooperation during the imaging study. Purpose or Case Report: The objective for a low dose imaging protocol was to eliminate patient risks and to reduce radiation doses. Tube placements are confirmed via imaging thereby avoiding utilization of malpositioned tubes. Reduced technical parameters lessen the absorbed skin dose. A limited field of view which includes distal espohagus and airway allows accurate assessment of feeding tube position. The new region of interest eliminates unnecessary exposure to hypersensitive organs including, thyroid and reproductive structures. This coned down view requires a lower image quality thereby allowing a lower dose approach.",

Workflows were mapped out for all patient visit types, providers and services. Exam codes were developed with associated CPT charges. Order panels for providers were updated. Macro templates for the Radiologist were developed and loaded at workstations. Lucite block and phantom testing were conducted using equivalent sized infant, toddler and adolescent phantoms on dedicated and portable units. Testing concentrated on portable units but table bucky techniques were also established. A 40\" source to image distance (SID) was used for table (grid) testing and a 36\" SID for portable/tabletop. A 6fr feeding tube was used to simulate placement. Established abdomen techniques were selected for corresponding phantom. The KVP factors were unchanged and mAS settings were decreased to lowest outputs by the units. The lowest mAs 1.25 mAs (table grid) was 0.32 for portable (non-grid). The field of view was mid-chest to iliac crest with proper collimation. Radiologist reviewed images and approved for trial. Exams performed using the new protocol. Image quality remained comparable to phantom testing with same technical factors.",

Acta2-/-females exhibit the greatest severity of cerebral malformation in the narrowing of L-SCA, curvature and mean circularity of L-ITCD and the lowest CoW area. Acta2-/animals show straightening of large cerebral arteries, characteristic features of MMD. Acta2-/-females have more prominent malformations compared to males. Fig2A shows diagram of CoW arteries with only the morphometric features that are significantly different between tested groups. Fig2B is a box plot of vessel narrowing, ACTA2 -/-females have significantly greater narrowing (p<0.02) compared to the other groups, consistent with human disease. The ACTA2 -/-model therefore recapitulates the increased severity of disease in females as observed in humans. Conclusions: The ACTA2 -/-model exhibits gender dependent MMD, consistent with the human condition. Morphometric analysis allows investigation of the alterations in cerebrovasculature of a MMD mouse model. ACTA2 -/-female mice show more severe arterial narrowing than ACTA2-/-male mice.Disclosures: Thomas Benkert has indicated a relationship with Siemens Healthineers for receiving a salary.

The majority of the lesions were in the extremity. Up to this date, this is by far the largest series of FAVA in the literature. Pathologic diagnosis was confirmed in 17 patients. Three different patterns were noticed: focal, focal infiltrative and diffuse patterns. Conclusions: FAVA has clinical and radiological features distinct from other common vascular anomalies and soft tissue tumors. Early recognition of this entity is crucial to direct proper management and avoid significant morbidity. The goal of this study is to evaluate improvement in patient quality of life, pre-and postprocedure pain, and imaging response to treatment. Our study aims to lay the groundwork for incorporating minimally invasive IR procedures/techniques to pediatric oncology protocols.Methods & Materials:We conducted a single site retrospective cohort study evaluating patients 0-21, whom underwent PTA from January 2008 to July 2017.

This study describes our initial experience with CEUS of the pediatric liver.Methods & Materials:This is an IRB approved retrospective review of clinical and imaging findings of pediatric liver CEUS exams over a 27-month period and relevant follow-up imaging. Results: There were 99 CEUS exams in 79 children with a CT prior to or within 26 days of the CEUS. 36/79 children had previous MRI, 16 of which used a hepatocytespecific contrast agent. Pathology was available for 9 patients: 3 malignant, 2 FNH, 2 inflammation, 1 granuloma, and 1 focal necrosis. Follow up imaging was available in 39% (n=39) of patients. The mean time between the CEUS and most recent imaging exam was 178 days (range: 3-609d). Review of the most recent study showed no lesion 18% (n=7), stable 48% (n=19), increased 10% (n=4) or decreased 23% (n=9) lesion size. Lesions with increased size had enhancement patterns thought to be FNH and RN. Conclusions: CEUS of the liver can complement or supplant CT and MRI thereby reducing radiation exposure and sedation.

The osseous, neurologic, and cardiac manifestations of MPS are well documented. Less well documented is deposition in large vessels, with only case reports and one series of eight cases reported in the literature. The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence of large vessel (specifically aortic) disease in patients with MPS.Methods & Materials:An IRB-approved retrospective study was performed. A searchable electronic medical record database was used to identify all patients with MPS at our institution -a MPS referral and treatment center -within the timeframe of electronic record-keeping. All MPS patients on whom contrast enhanced CT (CECT) of the body (chest and/or abdomen/pelvis) was performed were identified and that imaging reviewed by two board certified radiologists for abnormal thickening (defined as > 1mm wall thickness) of the aortic wall. Demographic information including age at time of imaging, gender, and subtype of MPS was recorded.Results:A total of 195 patients were identified, of which 69 (35%) had undergone CECT, with 30 (43%) demonstrating aortic wall thickness greater than 1 mm (see attached figures for representative examples). The average aortic wall thickness in these patients was 2.4 mm; 53% of those affected were male, 47% female (of those unaffected, 62% were male and 38% female). Median age at time of imaging for those with aortic disease is 1 year 2 months; median age at time of imaging for those without is 3 years 1 month. Twenty-eight (93%) of the patients with aortic disease had the Hurler subtype of MPS (MPS In patients with MPS, deposition disease in the aorta is much less well documented than coronary involvement, but in this series (to the best of our knowledge the largest yet done) 43% of patients with CECT body imaging demonstrate some degree of aortic deposition disease. Those with large vessel involvement tend to be of the more severe MPS subtype, and demonstrate aortic changes at a young age. Attention to the aorta during routine cross sectional imaging of these patients may be helpful in early recognition of vascular disease and in direction of treatment.Priya Sharma, MD 1 , priya.sharmamd@gmail.com; Dhanashree Rajderkar, MD 1 ; 1 University of Florida, Gainesville, FL Disclosures: Priya Sharma has indicated a relationship with the Association for Medical Imaging Management and Toshiba Medical for receiving a research grant.

Methods & Materials: 29 children and young adults with autoimmune liver disease (e.g., autoimmune hepatitis, sclerosing cholangitis) were enrolled in a prospective registry. Multiparametric MRI was performed on all subjects using a 1.5T imager (Ingenia; Philips Healthcare). Quantitative MRI sequences were performed through the mid liver, including MR elastography (MRE, 60 Hz), iron-corrected T1 mapping (cT1), T2 mapping, T1rho mapping, and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI, quantified as apparent diffusion coefficients [ADC]). Liver and spleen volumes as well as splenic stiffness were also obtained. Spearman correlation was used to assess bivariate relationships. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Mean subject age was 15.3 years (range, 7-23 years); 15 individuals were male. 8 of 28 bivariate comparisons were significant. Liver stiffness correlated with splenic stiffness (\u03c1=0.60, p=0.001), cT1 (\u03c1=0.39, p=0.038), and DWI ADC (\u03c1=-0.37, p=0.048). Splenic volume correlated with liver stiffness (\u03c1=0.67, p<0.0001) and splenic stiffness (\u03c1=0.73, p<0.0001). Other significant correlations included: cT1 vs. T2 (\u03c1=0.52, p=0.004), T2 vs. T1 rho (\u03c1=0.49, p=0.007), and cT1 vs. splenic stiffness (\u03c1=0.41, p=0.036). Conclusions: There were both significant and nonsignificant correlations between putative MRI biomarkers of chronic liver disease in our study population. This suggests that these quantitative imaging methods likely measure different components of the chronic liver disease process, and further research is needed to determine how these techniques predict liver inflammation and fibrosis when combined in a multiparametric manner.Purpose or Case Report: MR elastography (MRE) is being increasingly used in the pediatric population but data concerning diagnostic performance in this population is limited. The purpose of this study was to define the diagnostic performance of MRE in a population of children and young adults <21 years of age who underwent liver biopsy within three months of MRE.Methods & Materials:This was a retrospective review of patients undergoing hepatic MRE and liver biopsy for any suspected liver disease other than prior liver transplantation or Fontan palliation of congenital heart disease. A single experienced observer processed all MRE exams and a single experienced pathologist reviewed all biopsy specimens. The diagnostic performance of MRE was expressed in terms of sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Results: 89 patients, ages 0.3-20.6 years met inclusion criteria. Median interval between biopsy and MRE was 26 days. 44 patients (51.2%) had hepatic steatosis involving \u22655% of hepatocytes on histopathologic analysis. The population distribution of liver fibrosis stage and associated measured liver stiffness values by MRE are shown in the table. from \u22652 fibrosis in the entire population (68.6% [95%CI: 57.2-80.1%] and 74.3% [95%CI: 63.5-85.1%], respectively). Conclusions: In the pediatric and young adult population, there appears to be a confounding effect of steatosis on the prediction of liver fibrosis based on MRE-derived liver stiffness. MRE performs significantly better for the distinction of stage 0-1 from \u22652 fibrosis in patients without hepatic steatosis than in patients with hepatic steatosis.Assessment of pediatric liver allografts with shear wave elastographyJames Davis, MD 2 , davisjc2@upmc.edu; James Squires 1 , Allisin Drum 3 , Patrick McKiernan 1 , Wael Abdalla 3 , George Mazariegos 4 , Judy Squires, MD 3 ; 1 Department of Gastroenterology, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC, Pittsburgh, PA, 2 Department of Radiology, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA, 3 Department of Radiology, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC, Pittsburgh, PA, 4 Thomas E.

Although the operation restores essential blood flow and improves arterial oxygen saturations, resultant systemic venous hypertension and decreased cardiac output predispose to endorgan injury. Fontan-associated Liver Disease (FALD) is a major form of end-organ disease in this population. The purpose of this study was to define the relationship between two of the major components of FALD: liver stiffness (a surrogate for organ congestion and fibrosis) measured by MR elastography (MRE) and focal liver lesions.Methods & Materials:In this retrospective study, medical records were searched for patients that had been previously palliated with the Fontan operation and had subsequently undergone MRI of the liver with and without intravenous contrast material as well as MRE on the same day between January 1, 2012 and May 31, 2017. Mean and maximum liver stiffness (kPa) measured by MRE and the presence of focal liver lesions were documented. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare medians (age, mean liver stiffness, and maximum liver stiffness) between patients without and with focal liver lesions.Results:Of the 37 patients that met inclusion criteria, 26 (70%) had one or more focal liver lesions. Median age was 20.6 years (IQR [interquartile range]: 12.1-29.1 years) for patients without liver lesions versus 20.6 years (IQR: 17.0-28.9 years) for patients with liver lesions (p=0.81). There was no difference in mean liver stiffness between patients without liver lesions 5.Our study suggests that neither age nor mean liver stiffness measured by MRE is associated with the presence of focal lesions in patients status post the Fontan operation.",

A oneway ANOVA yielded liver stiffness values that were statistically different in segments VI and VII than in the other segments. In each individual, we further averaged measurements in segments II and III to represent the left lobe and segments V-VIII to represent the right lobe. We found three individuals(Patients #6,  18, and 19) who had statistically significant differences between the two lobes. Two individuals had stiffer right lobes; one had a stiffer left lobe. In comparing the global ROI to the local ROI approach for quantifying liver stiffness, we found average values in segments III, V, and VIII to most closely approximate the average stiffness across the entire organ. Conclusions: Our preliminary results support literature findings of using MRE in children and show that the technique is sensitive to detecting variations in tissue stiffness across hepatic lobes. We believe the difference in right and left lobe portal vasculature and their respective drainage from the upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts is partly responsible for the observed difference in hepatic stiffness.Methotrexate Therapy Increases Hepatic Stiffness inPatients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease Amie Robinson, BSRT(R)(MR) 1 , alrobinson@cmh.edu; Shweta Vadlamani 2 , Alka Goyal, MD 1 , Emily Kucera, MD 1 , Sherwin Chan, MD PhD 1 ; 1 Radiology, The Children's Mercy Hospital, Kansas City, MO, 2 University of Kansas School of Medicine, Kansas City, KS Disclosures: All authors have disclosed no financial interests, arrangements or affiliations in the context of this activity.Purpose or Case Report: The use of methotrexate as a first line immunomodulator and/or as an adjuvant to biologic therapy has been on the rise in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, there is paucity of data for evaluation and monitoring of hepatic fibrosis associated with prolonged methotrexate usage in patients with IBD. Ultrasound elastography is a noninvasive technique that can assess liver stiffness, which has been show to correlate with pathologically diagnosed hepatic fibrosis. We wanted to test the hypothesis that hepatic stiffness increases in IBD patients with methotrexate exposure Methods & Materials: This is a single site prospective crosssectional study evaluating ultrasound elastography results on IBD patients between 1/2017 and 10/2017. We included subject's ages 2 through 22 years who have a diagnosis of IBD and different cumulative dose exposures to methotrexate. Local institutional review board approval was granted for this study and all included patients gave informed consent. Subjects underwent a single ultrasound elastography exam. Clinical, medications and laboratory data were collected out of the subject's medical record. All subjects with pre-existing liver disease were excluded. The patients were divided into two groups, controls with no methotrexate exposure and subjects with prior methotrexate exposure. Results: A total of 42 (18 controls and 24 methotrexate exposure) subjects underwent ultrasound elastography. Twothirds of the patients are male (n=28, 67%) and the median age was 15 (range 5-22) years. Majority of patients had a diagnosis of Crohn Disease (n=29, 69%). The median cumulative methotrexate dose was 517 mg (range 118mg-2973mg). Shear wave velocity was compared between the control and methotrexate groups. The mean shear wave velocity values were significantly higher in patients with methotrexate exposure compared to the controls (1.37 vs. 1.23 m/s. p=0.04). Conclusions: Ultrasound elastography may be useful in detecting early changes in hepatic stiffness in patients receiving methotrexate prior to liver enzyme changes or clinically apparent liver disease. This technique should be studied further as a monitoring tool for patients on methotrexate.Abdominal Fat Distribution and its Relationship with Liver and Pancreatic Fat Fraction, Liver Stiffness and DiabeticStatus David Hunte 1 , David.Hunte@cchmc.org; Andrew Trout 1 , Marialena Mouzaki 1 , Alexander Towbin, MD 1 , Stavra Xanthakos 1 , Jonathan Dillman, MD, MSc 1 ; 1 Radiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH Disclosures: All authors have disclosed no financial interests, arrangements or affiliations in the context of this activity.Purpose or Case Report: Fatty liver disease is increasingly recognized as a multisystem disease. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between measures of anatomic fat depots, liver fat fraction, liver stiffness, pancreatic fat fraction, and diabetic status in pediatric patients.Methods & Materials:This was a retrospective study of pediatric patients with fatty liver disease who had undergone liver MR elastography (MRE) and multi-point Dixon-based fat quantification between September 2015 and July 2017. A single observer measured liver and pancreatic proton density fat fraction, abdominal subcutaneous fat thickness, and visceral fat thickness (deep fascia of rectus muscle to anterior aspect of L2). Clinical records were reviewed to abstract demographic data (age, sex, body mass index [BMI]), liver stiffness, and type 2 diabetes status. Bivariate correlations were assessed with Spearman's rho, and multiple linear and multiple logistic regression models were used to assess relationships between outcome and predictor variables. Results: 87 patients were included in this study (mean age: 14.3\u00b13.4 years; 27 [31%] females; mean BMI: 36.1\u00b17.8 kg/m 2 ). 7/87 (8%) patients were diabetic, and 45/87 (52%) were insulin resistant. Mean liver stiffness was 2.5\u00b10.9 kPa, mean liver fat fraction was 18.7\u00b110.3% and mean pancreatic fat fraction was 5.9\u00b15%. Liver fat fraction was significantly correlated only with visceral fat thickness at univariate analysis (\u03c1=0.31, p=0.004). Based on multivariate modeling, liver stiffness was significantly associated with liver fat fraction (-0.022kPa/+1%, p=0.018) and visceral fat thickness (+0.18kPa/1 cm, p=0.0007). At univariate analysis, pancreatic fat fraction was significantly correlated with age (\u03c1=0.28, p=0.012), BMI (\u03c1=0.34, p=0.002), subcutaneous fat thickness (\u03c1=0.23, p=0.04), and visceral fat thickness (\u03c1=0.24, p=0.03), but these relationships did not persist upon multivariate modeling. Diabetic status was not significantly associated with any measure of abdominal fat.",

Twin B was immediately subjected to a 12hour period of sub-physiologic flow (152mL/kg/min) and oxygen delivery (15.9mL/kg/min). Twin A maintained physiologic flow (>233mL/kg/min) and oxygen delivery (>22mL/kg/min). Lumason\u00ae ultrasound (US) contrast boluses were administered into the pumpless umbilical arterial to umbilical venous oxygenator circuit. Serial CEUS examinations were performed using a GE Logiq E9 US system and C2-9 transducer. Time-to-peak (TTP) measurements were obtained and Parametric maps were created. Hemodynamic parameters and measurements across the oxygenator were recorded. Serum oxygen and lactate values were obtained pre-and postexamination. Post-mortem MRIs were performed.",

To facilitate consistent SIJ assessment, numerous scoring systems have been proposed. We sought to systematically review articles that evaluated diagnostic accuracy and reliability of existing MRI-based SIJ scoring systems for the evaluation of spondyloarthropathy in children and adults, and assess their applicability to pediatric patients.Methods & Materials:Relevant studies were identified through a systematic literature search that included MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library Database. Studies reporting an element of diagnostic accuracy of an MRI-based SIJ scoring system were included: 1) reliability, 2) construct validity comparing MRI with other clinimetric measures, 3) criterion validity comparing MRI with a gold standard, and 4) ability of MRI to depict responsiveness to treatment. Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health guidelines were used to determine overall strength of recommendation (A-E) for scoring system utilization. Results: From 38 eligible studies, 5 scoring systems were identified: the Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) inflammation and structural scores, and the Leeds, Aarhus, and Berlin scoring systems. No scoring systems dedicated to pediatric patients were found, with none taking into account age-related changes of bone marrow. Only 1 study on the SPARCC scoring systems included pediatric patients, and was not dedicated to solely pediatric patients. Together the SPARCC scores had the highest number of studies reporting reliability (N=13), construct validity (N=10), and responsiveness (N=13). Good inter-observer reliability with intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) >0.8 was reported in 9/13 (69%) SPARCC inflammation, structural, 5/6 (83%) Berlin, 1/1 (100%) Leeds, and 0 Aarhus studies examining reliability. Seven (70%) studies demonstrated correlation between SPARCC scores and ESR, CRP, and standardized clinical severity indices. Twelve (92%) studies demonstrated decreases in SPARCC scores (lower scores = less severe disease) with treatment. Conclusions: Currently no MRI scoring systems are available in the literature focusing on pediatric SIJ assessment. There is fair (grade B) evidence to recommend the use of the SPARCC method use, however adjustments are needed in this scale (e.g. grading for bone marrow changes over time) before routine use can be considered in pediatric patients.",

Shawn Sato 1 , Yutaka Sato, MD 1 ; 1 Department of Radiology, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, IA Disclosures: All authors have disclosed no financial interests, arrangements or affiliations in the context of this activity.Purpose or Case Report: Neurocristopathies are a group of disorders characterized by a common origin in aberrant neural crest development. These include common pediatric disorders such as Hirschsprung's disease, Treacher Collins syndrome, Di George syndrome, MEN type 2A/2B as well as common pediatric tumors such as neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, Ewing's sarcoma, neurofibromatosis, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid and melanoma. Neural crest cells are derived from discrete cell masses that arise at the junction between the neural and epidermal ectoderm in neurula-stage vertebrate embryos. Neural crest cells migrate extensively in an organized manner and spread widely throughout the body. Derivatives of neural crest cells include Schwann cells in the leptomeninges, nerve root ganglia in the central nervous system, thyroid C cells, bone formation in the mandible and skull base, dermis of the head and neck, myenteric nerve plexuses of the intestines, pigment cells of the skin, paravertebral sympathetic ganglia, and adrenal medulla cells. Developmental disturbances of the neural crest cells give rise to a variety of disorders as listed above and have collectively been termed neurocristopathies by Bolande in 1974. Patients with one neurocristopahty have an increased risk of having other neurocristopathies. Familial inheritance has also been shown. There is a variability in the combinations of lesions found in the same patient or family.Recent advances in genetics and developmental biology have provided deeper insights into these collection of conditions. New technologies in biology including iPS cell technology are expected to further advance our understanding of neurocristopathies. Methods & Materials: 1.

Although radiologists with pediatric neuroradiology subspecialty training may be very familiar with many abnormalities encountered sonographically, pediatric radiologists without pediatric neuroradiology subspecialty training are often less familiar. Further, the ultrasound appearance of abnormalities of infant spine may be less well known than appearance on MRI. The purpose of this educational review is to demonstrate normal appearance of infant spine and illustrate abnormalities that are frequently and infrequently encountered during screening ultrasound evaluation, with MRI for comparison.Methods & Materials:An institutional review was conducted to identify neonatal patients with abnormal spine ultrasounds and subsequent MRI examinations. Imaging findings were correlated with clinical signs and symptoms, as well as treatment when available. Results: A spectrum of congenital and acquired cases are presented including simple tethered cord, closed spinal dysraphism (dorsal dermal sinus, lipomyelomeningocele, diastematomyelia), open spinal dysraphism (meningocele, myelomeningocele), dermoid cyst, spinal lipoma, infantile hemangioma, sacrococcygeal teratoma, caudal regression syndrome, and hematoma.

The purpose of the presentation is to show a multimodality pictorial review of characteristic findings of extra-axial CNS lesions detected on CT and MRI.Methods & Materials:A search for extra-axial CNS lesions was performed by reviewing studies stored on the picture archiving and communication system of an urban children's hospital between 2006 and 2017. A variety of cases were identified in the head and spine. A literature search on current information related to the diagnoses was performed. The presented cases include: lipoma, epidermoid, ruptured dermoid, transitional meningioma with brain invasion, inflammatory pseudotumor, lymphoma, atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor, craniopharyngioma, arachnoid cyst, epidural abscess, neurofibroma and ganglioneuroblastoma metastases.Results:A broad range of pathologies can occur in the extraaxial spaces, including benign and malignant lesions. By observing characteristics as described in the pictorial review, an appropriate differential diagnosis may be made enabling appropriate and efficient clinical management. Conclusions: Many extra-axial CNS lesions demonstrate characteristic features that may help narrow the differential diagnosis affecting clinical decision making. This presentation will help the radiologist recognize these characteristic features.

While SRBCT are similar at the cellular level, their location, imaging characteristics, clinical manifestations, and outcomes are widely variable. The purpose of this educational exhibit is to provide a pictorial review of small round cell blue tumors and to highlight key imaging findings that will aid the radiologist when faced with such tumors.Methods & Materials:A retrospective review of SRBCT was performed at St. Christopher's Hospital for Children. A series of cases with pathologically confirmed SRBCT were collected for review and presentation. Results: A multimodality approach including radiographs, CT, MRI, and nuclear scintigraphy is used to illustrate key imaging features of the various SRBCT. Cases to be presented include: medulloblastoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, pineoblastoma, retinoblastoma, neuroblastoma, Wilm's tumor, hepatoblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and desmoplastic small round blue cell tumor. Clinical manifestations, distinguishing imaging characterstics, metastatic patterns, prognosis, and treatment will be discussed for each tumor. Conclusions: Small round blue cell tumors encompass a wide variety of malignant tumors that have a similar histologic appearance.

It can have a variety of clinical outcomes, ranging from spontaneous resolution without therapy to fatal outcomes resistant to maximal therapy. Historically, neuroblastoma has been staged using the International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS). While this staging system has been used in clinical trials since its introduction in 1989, its reliance on surgical staging is problematic. Surgical resection can vary between surgeons and between tumors and occurs at an interval from diagnosis. This method complicates the process of standardizing therapy. Additionally, some patients have a disease that spontaneously regresses and does not require surgical management and thus cannot be staged.To combat these problems, the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) created a new staging system for use in clinical trials in 2009. This staging system relies on preoperative imaging for up-front staging. This helps standardize neuroblastoma staging and helps to guide a more standard approach to management. The INRG staging system is comprised of twenty image-defined risk factors (IDRF), across multiple organ systems, which help predict surgical outcomes and can be combined with clinical data to provide up-front risk stratification. Even though the INRG staging system has been in use since 2009, many pediatric radiologists remain unfamiliar with its definitions and application. Additionally, MR has now become an essential imaging tool for diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of patients with neuroblastoma. The purpose of this poster is to compare the INSS and INRG staging system, describe the limitations of each system, and illustrate the definitions and IDRFs that comprise the INRG staging system.Dual-Energy CT-Based Perfusion Imaging of the Lungs inChildren: Acquisition Technique, Post-processing, and Interpretation Jordan Rapp, MD 1 , jrapp24@gmail.com; David Saul, MD 1 , Summer Kaplan, MD MS 1 , Christian Barrera 1 , Hansel Otero, MD 1 ; 1 Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA Disclosures: All authors have disclosed no financial interests, arrangements or affiliations in the context of this activity.Purpose or Case Report: Background: Dual source dual-energy CT scanners (DECT) has allowed for the collection of two data sets with a single scan, opening the potential for functional data acquisition. The technique combines two energy beams at distinct voltages applied concurrently during a single scanning phase. The source data can be combined to generate a single mixed composite image, or iodine can be subtracted to create a contrast map or a virtual non-contrast image. The result is functional information in the setting of decreased radiation dose when replacing a biphasic scan, or dose neutral when compared to conventional single source CT. Post processing lung perfusion software allows for imaging display (qualification) and quantification of iodinated contrast volumes in the lungs, a surrogate for lung perfusion. Purpose: This educational exhibit will demonstrate: 1. How to perform DECT in children, 2. How to use postprocessing software, and 3. How to interpret lung perfusion results through clinical examples of current pediatric clinical indications including pulmonary embolism, lung hypoplasia, pulmonary AV malformation, and pulmonary hypertension.",

Acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome in children still confer significant morbidity and mortality despite advances in ventilation and resuscitative therapies. Much of the damage attributed to mechanical ventilation in critically ill infants and children is due to surface tension and ventilation of atelectatic lung. First reported clinically in neonates in 1989, partial liquid ventilation involves the endotracheal administration of an inert volatile perfluorochemical liquid. These perfluorocarbons aid in gas exchange due to their large oxygen and carbon dioxide carrying capacity. In addition, these chemicals possess low surface tension that allows for greater alveolar recruitment and improved lung compliance through clearance of debris and secretions. Early trials in preterm neonates and neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia suggested a role for liquid ventilation as salvage therapy for patients not responding to conventional mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Currently, efforts are underway to reassess its clinical utility in bronchopulmonary dysplasia. With this renewed clinical interest, it is important for pediatric radiologists at institutions utilizing these perfluorocarbons to be familiar with the clinical use and radiographic appearance of liquid ventilation.Conclusions: This presentation summarizes the imaging evaluation of liquid ventilation including information on the qualitative assessment of ventilation status and clinical relevance of particular imaging findings. Due to the presence of bromine, these perfluorocarbons demonstrate a strikingly radiopaque appearance on chest radiographs and computed tomography that can be confusing to radiologists unfamiliar with liquid ventilation. Understanding the radiographic distribution and clearance of perfluorocarbons from the lungs can be important in assessing the effectiveness of this experimental therapy. In addition, radiologists should be aware of the occasional retention of perfluorocarbons in extra-pulmonary tissues following discontinuation of liquid ventilation.Pediatric CXR -The forgotten art.Renato Ferreira da Silva, MD 1 , renato-silva@uiowa.edu; Prashant Nagpal, MBBS 1 , Sarv Priya, MD 1 , T.

Medical record and imaging was reviewed. Patients with pneumothorax in addition to pneumomediastinum were not included. Results: We found 14 pediatric patients with spontaneous, or non-traumatic, pneumomediastinum during this time period. Underlying causes included respiratory illness, asthma, drug overdose, extreme breath-holding and some truly idiopathic cases. All patients had at least one chest radiograph. 6 patients had chest CT in addition to a radiograph. Chest CT demonstrated pneumomediastinum in all patients but did not provide any additional information relative to the radiograph or clinical exam. The results of the chest CT therefore did not change management Conclusions: Many pediatric patients with spontaneous pneumomediastinum are evaluated with chest CT. In our series, CT did not change patient management or outcome. In keeping with the surgical literature, we recommend against the routine use of CT to evaluate patients with spontaneous pneumomediastinum. fistula, abnormal liver function, hepatic nodules, elevated blood ammonia, hepatic encephalopathy. Conclusions: MSCT can exactly diagnose type II Abernethy malformation and show the exact location of the portacaval shunt. Sometimes it is hard to make the certain diagnosis between Abernethy type Ib and II in MSCT, then DSA will help while necessary.Comparison of Fetal Radiation Dose Estimation MethodsIvey Royall, MD 1 , Ivey.Royall.MD@flhosp.org; Vincent Grekoski 2 , Matthew Hough, MS 1 , William Sensakovic, PhD 1 ; Florida Hospital, Orlando, FL, 2 University of Central Florida, Orlando, FLDisclosures: All authors have disclosed no financial interests, arrangements or affiliations in the context of this activity. or Case Report: To compare methods of estimating the fetal radiation dose delivered during computed tomography (CT) scanning. Further, to assess sources of variability in estimation methods.Methods & Materials:A database of 40 CT scans of pregnant patients was collected. Mean gestational age was 159\u00b163 days (7 first, 19 second, and 14 third trimester). Radimetrics, Bayer). Two observers made measurements necessary for dose calculation. These included fetal depth, maternal circumference, and maternal diameter. Agreement among methods was assessed using regression and Bland-Altman analysis. Causes of disagreement between methods and variability within methods was also investigated. Results: Fetal dose ranged from <1mGy to 32mGy. Differences between methods were significant (p<0.05), but generally small (<10mGy). Bias between methods was <5mGy and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were less than \u00b115mGy for pairwise method comparison. Regression between methods demonstrated typical slopes between 0.8 and 1.2 and R2 values between 0.3 and 0.8. When datasets were limited to avoid violating method assumptions both bias and 95%CI were cut by 50% or more. Complete patient circumference was not visible in the CT field of view for 30 of 40 patients (75%). This likely causes overestimation of fetal dose due to underestimation of the maternal size. Differences in measurement between the observers generally resulted in fetal dose estimate changes of <10mGy, though several outliers demonstrated larger changes. Conclusions: Fetal dose estimation methods demonstrated good agreement; however, variability and outliers exist. A qualified medical physicist should review dose estimates to ensure proper calculation. Differences between methods could become important if combined with other dose data in a dose index tracking system as it could elevate estimated dose above threshold considered acceptable for fetal scanning.Free-Breathing Motion Insensitive 3D T1-Weighted Post-Contrast Spine and Abdominal MRI Using a Golden Angle Radial AcquisitionHouchun Hu, PhD 1 , houchun.hu@nationwidechildrens.org; Thomas Benkert, PhD 2 , Ramkumar Krishnamurthy, PhD 1 , Mark Smith, MS 1 , Jerome Rusin 1 , Cody Young, DO 1 , Brent H.

All other authors have disclosed no financial interests, arrangements or affiliations in the context of this activity.Purpose or Case Report: Free-breathing MRI scans are attractive in pediatric imaging as they reduce the need for sedation and breath-holds. In this work, we evaluate a 3D T1w radial \"stack of stars\" gradient echo (GRE) acquisition (RAVE-RAdial Volumetric Encoding) in post-contrast abdomen and spine protocols and compare results with conventional Cartesian MRI of similar spatial resolution and volume coverage.Methods & Materials:Studies were performed on a 3T Siemens Prisma. With radial MRI, data are acquired along kspace spokes during repetitions of the sequence. Consecutive spokes are rotated in-plane by the golden-angle (111.25 deg) to maximize k-space coverage. The center of k-space is oversampled and this feature affords RAVE's robustness to motion. When coupled with compressed sensing and parallel imaging, the radial data further yields dynamic images, (i.e., during contrast passage). We have evaluated free-breathing RAVE in 20 patients referred for non-sedated abdominal and spine MRI exams with contrast. In the abdomen, we have acquired RAVE in both axial and coronal orientations (i.e., liver, enterography). In the spine, we have acquired RAVE in the axial plane. Three radiologists compared RAVE to conventional breath-hold GRE in abdomen scans and free-breathing fast-spinecho (FSE) images in the spine. A 3-point scale was used to evaluate diagnostic image quality: -1=RAVE is superior, 0=equivalent, +1=RAVE is inferior. Results: In all cases, RAVE images were considered robust to respiratory, cardiac, and gastrointestinal motion, and no artifacts that impacted diagnostic image quality were noted. In the spine, RAVE was consistently superior to FSE (p<0.01) in delineating nerve tracts and roots against CSF. In the abdomen, RAVE was comparable to breath-hold GRE scans.Fig 1 shows a seriesof cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine comparisons between FSE and RAVE in a 14y patient. Note the lack of motion-related artifacts in RAVE, without the use saturation bands.Fig 2 showscoronal RAVE dynamic frames ~15s apart, highlighting contrast uptake, in a 10y patient. A breath-hold post-contrast GRE image is shown for comparison.",

All authors have disclosed no financial interests, arrangements or affiliations in the context of this activity.Purpose or Case Report: A multi-disciplinary team of physicians developed a clinical practice guideline (CPG) in June 2010 to standardize the diagnosis and management of suspected appendicitis in pediatric patients (< 18 years) who presented to a single institution's emergency room. This study evaluated the utilization and efficacy of the CPG, comprised of Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS) and staged ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) imaging, from 1/1/13-12/31/16. Using baseline data from the first year after implementation, we hypothesized that increased US and PAS utilization would result in improved US performance and a concomitant decrease in CT utilization without loss of diagnostic accuracy.Methods & Materials:With IRB approval, a retrospective review of patients who had US for appendicitis was performed using Epic and AGFA Impax 6.6.1.3525. Analysis of the utilization and efficacy of US, CT, and the staged US/CT approach was conducted by determining the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values.Results: 1,466 patient encounters, representing 1,390 different patients, met inclusion criteria. 1,466 US and 261 CT scans were performed; 6 CTs with indications for other acute abdomen etiologies were excluded. 219 US were interpreted as positive, 1,085 as negative, and 162 as equivocal for appendicitis (Table 1). Abdominal US had a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 80.9%, 98.5%, 92.7%, and 95.5% respectively. Abdominal CT had a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 98.4%, 98.9%, 96.9%, and 99.4% respectively. The staged US/CT algorithm had a sensitivity of 97.9%, specificity of 97.7%, positive predictive value of 91.3%, and negative predictive value of 99.5% (Table 2). Conclusions: Experience and refinement of the appendicitis CPG led to improved US performance as sensitivity increased from 63.9% to 80.9% and specificity from 92.6% to 98.5%. CT utilization decreased overall, with CT use in only 17.4% of patient encounters; however, there was a trend of increasing CT use over time. Of the 316 with an appendectomy, 24.1% had CT (previously 45.5%). An algorithm strength was continuous patient reevaluation by clinicians. Thus, 60.5% of equivocal scans did not have CT, avoiding 98 CT scans. However, despite a negative US, 174 patients (16%) had a CT, only 32 of which proved to have appendicitis. 17 CTs were performed after a positive US, 15 of which characterized suspected ruptured appendicitis. Intestinal Stricture Formation Following Medically Treated Necrotizing Enterocolitis: A 10-year Experience at a Tertiary Care Children's Hospital Erica Poletto, MD 1 , eweinberg2@hotmail.com; Matthew Richards, MD 2 , Bernard Goldwasser, MD 1 , Teerin Meckmongkol, MD 1 , Sean Ciullo, MD 1 , Rajeev Prasad, MD 1 ; 1 St. Christopher's Hospital for Children, Philadelphia, PA, 2 Hahnemann University Hospital, Philadelphia, PA Disclosures: All authors have disclosed no financial interests, arrangements or affiliations in the context of this activity.Purpose or Case Report: The formation of one or more intestinal strictures is a known complication of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Multiple prior investigations have found that the occurrence of colonic strictures is higher than small intestinal strictures, at an approximate ratio of 2-3:1. We hypothesized that small intestinal strictures may be more prevalent than colonic strictures at our urban, academic, tertiary care children's hospital. Our first aim was to determine the incidence of small intestinal and colonic strictures in patients with prior medically treated NEC who had not undergone previous surgical intervention. Second, we attempted to evaluate for differences in demographics and other clinical variables between the group of patients with small intestinal strictures versus the group with colonic strictures.Methods & Materials:Infants who had undergone fluoroscopic imaging studies for the evaluation of intestinal strictures following medically treated NEC were included in the study. Of the 49 patients identified, 15 patients were confirmed to have had stricture formation during subsequent surgical exploration. For each subject the following demographic and clinical data were collected: gender, birth weight, gestational age at birth, age at first diagnosis of NEC, number of episodes of medical NEC, and age at surgery for evaluation of stricture. Results: 5/15 (33%) subjects had strictures limited to the colon, 8/15 (53%) subjects had strictures limited to the small intestine, and 2/15 (13%) subjects had both small intestinal and colonic strictures. Therefore, the overall incidence of colonic stricture was 7/15 (46.7%; confidence interval: 25-70%) and the overall incidence of small intestinal stricture was 10/15 (66.7%; confidence interval: 42-85%). There was no statistically significant difference in gender, birth weight, gestational age at birth, age at first diagnosis of NEC, number of episodes of medical NEC, or age at surgery between the group of patients with small intestinal strictures versus the group with colonic strictures (p-values range from 0.13 to 0.77). Conclusions: Small intestinal strictures are more common than colon strictures in our population of patients with medically treated NEC. This is contrary to the findings of most prior investigations that found colonic strictures to be most common. There was no statistically significant difference in patient demographics between the groups, limiting our ability to predict what type of stricture a patient might develop.Incidence and importance of portal venous gas in patients with hypertrophic pyloric stenosisSarah Milla, MD 1 , sarahsarvismilla@gmail.com; Cera Cantu 1 , Edward Richer, MD 1 , Kiery Braithwaite, MD 1 , Leann Linam 1 , Erica Riedesel, MD 1 , Jonathan Loewen, MD 1 , Stephen Simoneaux 1 ; 1 Radiology, Emory, Atlanta, GA Disclosures: All authors have disclosed no financial interests, arrangements or affiliations in the context of this activity. or Case Report: Idiopathic thickening of the pyloric muscle can occur in young infants, causing projectile vomiting, electrolyte abnormalities, and necessity for surgical intervention to relieve the gastric outlet obstruction. Case reports have been published describing infants with HPS who also have portal venous gas (PVG) visualized within the liver. The presence of PVG in other clinical scenarios often indicates a severe and potentially life threatening bowel condition. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) and concurrent portal venous gas (PVG), as well as whether there are unique clinical features or different outcomes in the HPS patients with PVG versus without PVG. Methods & Materials: IRB approval with waiver of consent was granted for this retrospective study. Institutional report search was performed for infant ultrasound reports containing the words \"pyloric stenosis\", excluding a negative descriptor. Attending pediatric radiologists reviewed sonographic reports and images to confirm positive diagnosis of HPS and collect imaging data. Imaging data recorded included: length of pylorus, thickness of pylorus, sonographic evaluation of liver, presence of portal venous gas, and whether any additional imaging was performed. Clinical data included demographic information, days of symptomatology, presence of electrolyte abnormality, and length of hospital stay. Results: Between 11/2010-9/2017, 559 ultrasounds were found to be positive for pyloric stenosis at our institution. 343 studies were deemed to have sufficient hepatic imaging to evaluate for portal venous gas. 6 out of the 343 HPS cases demonstrated PVG (1.8%). Pyloric thickness and length measured 4.4 mm and 18.9 mm respectively in HPS patients without PVG, versus 4.2 mm and 19.9 mm with PVG. Male gender predominance was seen in both groups. Average length of stay for both groups was approximately 2 days, with average length of symptoms and electrolyte abnormalities slightly decreased for the 6 patients with PVG than the group without PVG. Conclusions: Our retrospective study showed an incidence of PVG in approximately 1.8% of our patient population with HPS. Imaging and clinical characteristics were similar between the HPS patients without and with PVG, suggesting that the presence of portal venous gas does not portend overall worse clinical condition or outcome in HPS patients.",

Because of the length of the procedure and need for breath holds, patients require general anesthesia. The patient is induced in the MR suite on a detachable MR scanner gantry. Once anesthetized, the patient and gantry are moved out of the MRI suite for ultrasoundguided, bilateral, inguinal lymph node access, which is performed by a pediatric interventional radiologist with 22 or 24gauge angiocatheters. Once placed, the angiocatheters are connected to long tubing and a three way stopcock. A test injection of 1-2mL of saline is used to confirm intra-nodal access. The angiocatheters and tubing are stabilized, and the patient/gantry are wheeled back into the MR suite. MR imaging then ensues with injection of 0.1 mmol/kg of gadolinium based contrast at a dilution of one-part contrast to 2 parts normal saline. Rapid sequence, dynamic 3D gradient echo imaging is then performed of the abdomen and pelvis with a diagnostic radiologist performing the examination, while an interventional radiologist is in the suite injecting the diluted contrast. Results: MR Lymphangiography examinations have been performed in 5 patients (mean age: 27 months (range: 2-89 months); mean weight: 13 kg (range: 3.1-26 kg) at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. Presenting symptoms included: plastic bronchitis (2), chylous pleural effusion(s) (2), and chylous pericardial effusion (1). Four examinations successfully identified the lymphatic anatomic abnormality accounting for chylous leak; all of which were endovascularly or surgically repaired, subsequently. One MR lymphangiogram demonstrated normal central conducting lymphatics. (The child was later found to have plastic bronchitis from an aspirated foreign body.) Conclusions: MR lymphangiography with intra-nodal gadolinium contrast injection is logistically and technically feasible in a pediatric hospital setting.",

Modern treatment regimens have increased overall survival for Wilms tumor to over 90% [1] . Despite this, 10-15% of patients with favorable histology and up to 50% with anaplastic histology will experience primary progression or recurrence. The most common site of recurrence is to the lungs and the liver [2] . Peritoneal disease and recurrence has been described [3] [4] . We present an interesting case of a 13-year-old female with extensive peritoneal recurrence of Wilms tumor. The patient initially presented at the age of 12 with a 3-day history of abdominal pain. CT revealed a 13 cm right renal mass with no other lesions in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis. She underwent right nephrectomy, during which she was upstaged to stage 3 when tumor rupture occured. Histology was favorable. She completed chemo and radiotherapy. CT CAP at 6 months followup showed no recurrent disease. Approximately 7 months later or 13 months after initial diagnosis the patient presented with constipation and abdominal pain. Initial non-contrast CT demonstrated filling of the abdomen and pelvis with a high density material (Figure 1 ). Given the patient's history and concern about some nodularity to the density, MRI was performed and demonstrated extensive heterogeneous mass-like peritoneal disease filling the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 2 ). There were additional areas of peritoneal caking and thickening( Figure 3 ). Ultrasound guided biopsy was performed and the pathology was identical to that of the excised Wilms.

CT appearances of involvement of the peritoneum, mesentery and omentum in Wilms tumor. Purpose or Case Report: Traumatic laryngotracheal transection is an uncommon occurrence most often secondary to blunt trauma to the neck. The most commonly described mechanism is a \"clothesline\" injury or strangulation, involving high speed impact of the neck across a chain, rope, chord, or strap, usually associated with the use of a motor or recreational vehicle. It is often instantaneously fatal, and those who survive may have Purpose or Case Report: Genitourinary abnormalities are frequently detected on prenatal ultrasound, with findings detected on 1 in 500 routine prenatal sonograms. Early detection of abnormalities of the genitourinary system is essential as it allows planning for further work-up and intervention and appropriate counseling of parents. Findings on prenatal ultrasound often trigger further evaluation with fetal MRI, as MRI can provide superior anatomic detail and better assess for associated findings. An understanding of the appearance of genitourinary abnormalities on fetal MRI is important to enable accurate diagnoses and effectively guide clinicians in patient management. This educational poster highlights fetal MRI cases that demonstrate genitourinary abnormalities including bilateral renal agenesis with Potter sequence, crossed fused renal ectopia, multicystic dysplastic kidney, duplex collecting system, posterior urethral valves, patent urachus, allantoic cyst, prune belly syndrome, congenital megaureter, cloaca, bladder exstrophy, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, horseshoe kidney, and sirenomelia. The goal of this exhibit is to provide familiarity with these findings and their clinical implications, which is particularly important for those with less fetal MRI experience. In addition, the exhibit will provide an overview of the embryology of the genitourinary system as it relates to the abnormalities to provide further context of the pathophysiology of these complex congenital conditions.",

Absence of the ductus venosus is a rare anomaly associated with a number of serious, life-threatening and often deadly conditions. Studies have evaluated the use of ultrasound for prenatal evaluation and detection of absent ductus venosus; however, no studies have reported non-ultrasound postnatal radiological findings of absent ductus venosus. Here, we describe the expected anatomy in those with absent ductus venosus and present abdominal x-rays of 3 infants to illustrate an expected but abnormal course of umbilical venous lines in these patients. As many as 15.6% of patients with absent ductus venosus have it in isolation and with 67-100% postnatal survival when occurring in isolation. Thus, the postnatal incidental identification of absent ductus venosus is a clinical possibility for pediatric radiologists that review abdominal x-rays to check catheter/line placement. Familiarity with this abnormal course of umbilical venous lines may assist in making this rare postnatal diagnosis and avoid potentially life-threatening complications secondary to line malposition/repositioning. Purpose or Case Report: As an inexpensive modality that does not require ionizing radiation, ultrasound is the preferred method for screening for fetal anomalies. When an abnormality is detected on ultrasound, the limitations of the modality often Purpose or Case Report: In this educational exhibit we will present a series of gastrointestinal (GI) emergencies encountered in the neonatal period. We will focus on typical presentations but will also include atypical cases and discuss multi-modality approach to imaging these patients. Methods & Materials: GI emergencies are unfortunately a mainstay in the neonatal intensive care unit. Accurately diagnosing these potentially catastrophic disease processes is of paramount importance. Given that history and physical is extremely limited, accurately diagnosing neonatal GI emergencies can be quite the challenge often requiring the assistance of the radiology through x-rays and subsequent confirmatory fluoroscopic examinations, ultrasound or less commonly, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Since early diagnosis is associated with a substantially better outcome, imaging is essential in forming the proper management plan for these patients. Results: We will use a case based approach to discuss the following neonatal emergencies of the gastrointestinal tract: Malrotation Duodenal atresia Duodenal web Jejunal or ilieal atresia Meconium ileus Meconium plug syndrome Hirschsprung's disease Necrotizing enterocolitis Intestinal perforation Meconium peritonitis and complications Conclusions: Neonatal GI emergencies are all too common and remain associated with a high mortality and morbidity. Early diagnosis via knowledge of the classic as well as atypical radiographic findings combined with confirmatory tests can result in prompt diagnosis and management of these potential catastrophic events in the neonate.",

As many of 20-25% of patients with IBD initially present in childhood or adolescence, and the incidence of pediatric IBD is increasing. IBD primarily affects the bowel, but other organs can be involved. Nearly onethird of patients will have at least one extra-intestinal manifestation. Some extra-intestinal manifestations, such as that between UC and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), are wellestablished. Others are less understood and may mimic more common pathology, particularly infection. Therefore, pediatric radiologists must become familiar with these extra-intestinal Purpose or Case Report: Timely sonographic diagnosis of appendicitis can be critical for pediatric patients, as perforation rate is inversely related to the child's age, and atypical signs and symptoms can commonly obscure the clinical diagnosis. 1 In experienced hands, pediatric sonography for appendicitis has a high sensitivity and specificity and spares the child radiation. 2 Our educational poster entitled \"Unusual Appendicitis Presentations\" has been authored by experienced sonographers and will cover the following: Purpose or Case Report: To summarize our experience in diagnosis neonatal bowel obstruction in cystic fibrosis (CF) patient using contrast enema study. This pictorial review will illustrate and discuss several aspects of imaging findings in noncomplicated and complicated meconium ileus as well as the mimicker. Key imaging findings, pearls and pitfalls in diagnosis and guided treatment will be made, emphasizing what radiologists need to know. Correlation with intraoperative findings and follow-up images will also be provided. Methods & Materials: Using our radiology database, a retrospective review of barium enema studies in neonate with delayed pass meconium from 2010-2017 was obtained. Clinical data and imaging finding were reviewed. We will demonstrate imaging findings of non-complicated and complicated meconium ileus in CF neonate with delayed pass meconium, as microcolon secondary to meconium ileus, meconium plug, meconium peritonitis, colonic volvulus and ileal atresia. Imaging of the mimicker of meconium ileus will be discussed including microcolon secondary to very low birth weight and prematurity and total colonic Hirschsprung's disease. Imaging checklists for diagnosis and guided either therapeutic enema or surgery will be demonstrated. Results: Delayed pass meconium is the first sign of neonatal bowel obstruction. Approximately 20% of neonates with CF present with meconium ileus or meconium plug syndrome at birth due to abnormally thick and impacted meconium at the distal ileum or left-sided colon. However in some patients, it can present with complications such as meconium peritonitis or colonic volvulus which need immediate surgical intervention. Optimal imaging technique is important to generate a correct diagnosis and therapeutic treatment. Conclusions: Contrast enema plays an important role in diagnosis and guided treatment in CF neonate with delayed pass meconium. Understanding imaging findings of non-complicated, complicated and mimicker of meconium ileus are crucial for radiologist to generate a correct diagnosis and guide treatment.",

To review the normal imaging appearance of the spleen on ultrasound, CT and MRI. 2. Discuss the imaging characteristics of various pediatric splenic pathology. 3. Learn the epidemiology, appropriate imaging workup, and management of congenital pediatric splenic abnormalities. Introduction The spleen can be involved in a wide range of pathologies, yet can be frequently overlooked on imaging. Splenic disorders can be seen in isolation or may be secondary to a systemic disease. Different imaging modalities can be utilized to evaluate the spleen and include ultrasound, CT, and MRI. We will perform a case-based review of the imaging characteristics of various types of pediatric splenic pathologies. After completing this educational exhibit, the reader will be able to recognize the various causes and imaging characteristics of pediatric splenic diseases. The following topics will be discussed: Congenital splenic anomalies -asplenia, polysplenia, accessory spleen Splenomegaly Purpose or Case Report: The prevalence of fibrosing diseases is uncommon in adult patients, and significantly more rare in the pediatric population. The spectrum of fibrosing diseases may be subdivided into two sub-categories: Inflammatory pseudotumors (IMT) and multifocal fibrosclerotic diseases. IMT has a predilection for visceral soft tissues and the most common sites of involvement include lung, abdominopelvic region, but virtually any site may be involved, including the somatic soft tissues, bone, larynx, uterus and CNS. Multifocal fibrosclerotic diseases encompasses retroperitoneal fibrosis, mediastinal fibrosis, reidel's thyroiditis, orbital pseudotumor, and sclerosing cholangitis to name a few. IMT's are predominantly neoplastic but may be post-traumatic or post-infectious. Fibrosclerosing diseases may be associated with inflammatory diseases (inflammatory bowel disease), autoimmune conditions (juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus), malignant tumors (lymphoma), vasculitis and may arise secondary to drugs, toxins, trauma or radiation. Some may be idiopathic with no underlying cause. The clinical presentation can be quite variable and often depends upon the site of involvement as well which adjacent structures are affected by the fibrosis. Initial diagnosis can be suggested by imaging, but imaging findings are often non-specific. They can appear as mass forming and may be mistaken for more aggressive malignancy. Tissue is often needed for confirmation. Histopathology shows evidence of lymphocytic infiltration, activated fibroblasts, spindle shaped cells and granulation tissue. The key issue for the pediatric radiologist is to be aware of these rare conditions and thus include them in their differential diagnosis. This diagnosis should be considered to avoid over aggressive biopsy, operation and chemotherapy. In addition, it may warrant work up for other associated fibrosing diseases in the appropriate clinical scenario. In this presentation, we will provide a case based review of the features of pediatric inflammatory pseudotumors and fibrosclerotic diseases including myofibroblastic tumors, fibromatosis, fibrosarcomas, nodular and cranial fascitis as well as fibrotic conditions involving mediastinum, retroperitoneum, biliary tract and thyroid gland with their appropriate diagnostic work-up. Our aim is to make people aware of these rare presentations, so that they are not lost in the long differential!",

Examples include the use of ultrasound to differentiate shoulder and elbow dislocation from epiphysiolysis, for the detection of radiographically occult fractures, for the detection of osteomyelitis/brodie's abscess and subperiosteal abscess, for the evaluation of nursemaid's elbow, for the detection of classic metaphyseal lesions, and for the detection of pelvic apophyseal avulsion injury. Results: Review of these illustrative cases highlights the important role of ultrasound in the evaluation of pediatric musculoskeletal emergencies and can improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis. Conclusions: A pictorial review of illustrative cases in which ultrasound was instrumental in problem-solving pediatric musculoskeletal emergency cases can improve the accuracy of interpretation and efficiency of diagnostic work-up. Purpose or Case Report: 1. To review the contemporary literature and present an updated list of musculoskeletal and nonmusculoskeletal imaging findings of patients with autoinflammatory diseases in our hospital. Most of these patients are found to have a genetic mutation that is responsible for their disease. 2. To present follow-up imaging findings, when available, and correlate those with patients' symptoms and type of treatment administered in approximately 40 patients with autoinflammatory diseases such as Cryopyrin-associated autoinflammatory syndrome, familial Mediterranean fever, PAPA (pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenousum, and acne) syndrome and much more. These findings can be related to Results: Perfusion changes in response to acetazolamide occur in three patterns. In the first, there is normal blood flow at baseline with acetazolamide-induced increased perfusion. Patients with the second pattern have a decreased baseline perfusion, but the vasodilator improves flow. In the third pattern, there is also a decreased baseline perfusion, but acetazolamide exacerbates the relative regional blood flow deficit. In the third pattern, the chronically ischemic territory is felt to be perfused by vessels that are already maximally dilated, and the apparent paradoxical response to the vasodilator is due to a steel phenomenon. Conclusions: Acetazolamide challenge is a useful technique in the diagnostic evaluation of pediatric sickle cell patients with chronic cerebrovascular disease. Arterial-spin labeling obviates the need for intravenous contrast which is an important factor in the sickle cell population due to the inherent renal vulnerability of these patients.",

In this exhibit, we discuss the strengths and weakness of common sequences for LM detection; technical alternatives for reduction of motion, acoustic noise and scan time; and present a suggested targeted imaging protocol based on current best imaging practice.With visual examples, we will discuss: 1. Signal characteristics of LM and role of complementary sequences for detection 2. Optimizing scan planes and slice thickness for tumor/metastasis location and patient size 3. Strengths and weaknesses of T1 FLAIR, SE, FSE/TSE, gradient echo and ultrafast spoiled gradient echo (VIBE/FAME/LAVA/THRIVE) sequences in terms of time, resolution, SNR and CSF artifact 4. Utility and optimization of post-contrast FLAIR, DWI, TrueFISP/bSSFP, and subtraction images for metastasis detection 5. Reducing imaging time: targeted sequences, k-space undersampling (HASTE, partial Fourier imaging), parallel imaging 6. Reducing acoustic noise: lowering bandwidth, longer echo spacing, modified gradient wave forms, alternate encoding (PETRA, SWIFT, zero-TE) 7. Reducing motion artifact: 2D vs. 3D, non-Cartesian acquisition schemes, motion correction Purpose or Case Report: The purpose of educational exhibit is to summarize the radiological appearances of various conditions causing basal ganglia (BG) calcification in children. The pathogenesis for symmetric BG calcification is diverse and ranges from benign physiological calcifications to a variety of pathological disorders including metabolic, infectious and genetic diseases. We present a practical approach to further narrow the differential diagnosis based on associated musculoskeletal imaging findings in patients with BG calcification. Parathyroid disorders are the most common causes of pathological BG calcification. In hyperparathyroidism, distinctive subperiosteal bone resorption can be seen in phalanges on hand radiographs. Tapering of the clavicles, brown tumors and salt-and-pepper appearance of the skull are also classic radiographic features. In the Albright hereditary osteodystrophy phenotype of pseudohypoparathyroidism, shortening of the fourth and fifth metacarpals as well as advanced bone age can aid in diagnosis. Tumoral calcinosis is another radiographically distinct disease that can cause BG calcification, characterized in the extremities by periarticular calcific deposits. Cockayne syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive (AR) disorder with 4 overlapping subtypes, all with BG calcification as well as diffuse skeletal abnormalities that become apparent in the toddler years. Carbonic anhydrase deficiency type 2 is another rare AR disorder with intracranial calcification including the BG, as well as osteopetrosis and pathologic fractures. Coat's plus syndrome has characteristic rock-like intracranial calcifications paired with leukodystrophy and brain cysts. It manifests skeletally with osteopenia, delayed fracture healing, bowing of long bones, scoliosis, midface hypoplasia and femoral head avascular necrosis. Other common conditions such a Down syndrome and HIV, and rare disorders such Fahr's disease, malignant phenylketonuria, and Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome are in the differential diagnosis of BG calcifications.",

Tumors affecting the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses in children can arise from either soft tissue or bony structures and differ substantially from adult sinonasal masses. The aim of our exhibit is to review imaging features of a myriad of sinonasal neoplasms and tumor-like masses unique to the pediatric population ranging from the more well-known rhabdomyosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma to rarer lesions such as desmoplastic fibroma, nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma, and melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy.",

Histopathologically-proven cases from two large teaching children's hospitals will be presented encompassing an array of imaging modalities. Results: 1. Highlight imaging features of tumors in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses that present in children either from soft tissue or bony origins. Lesions include but will not be limited to: melanotic neuroectodermal tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, leukemia, lymphoma, pPNET/Ewing's sarcoma, nasal glioma, giant cell granuloma, nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma, and lobular capillary hemangioma. 2. Distinguish benign and malignant sinonasal lesions in children and demonstrate cases where imaging features may overlap. 3. Review relevant anatomic landmarks and complications of sinonasal tumors such as invasion of adjacent critical structures and neurovascular involvement. Conclusions: Sinonasal tumors are uncommon in children. They often present with nonspecific symptoms of nasal obstruction, pain, nasal secretions, or epistaxis. Imaging plays a crucial role in narrowing down the differential diagnosis when a child presents with clinical signs and symptoms referable to the sinonasal region. This review aims at familiarizing radiologists with the diagnostic possibilities in the pediatric population and raises awareness of the salient radiologic features.",

The brain MRI findings and relevant clinical information of two remotely related children with the same novel missense mutation in the perforin gene represent the basis of this educational poster. Perforin is a glycoprotein (encoded by the PRF-1 gene) involved in several human cellular functions, including, immune response and stored mainly in CD8-positive T-cells as well as natural killer (NK) cells. Normally, T-cells and NK cells are responsible for attacking dead cells. In the clinical setting of perforin deficiency, T-cells and NK cells attack the healthy immune system. This arises from a missense mutation of the PRF-1 gene. Links between perforin deficiency and the autoimmune clinical syndrome of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), have been reported. MR imaging abnormalities in patients with perforin gene mutations, are diverse and complex as the defect may occur in the setting of familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, primary necrotizing lymphocytic CNS vasculitis or associated with CNS infections such as the Epstein Barr virus. To date, MRI abnormalities that have been reported include mimics of septic cerebral emboli, confluent white matter abnormalities involving the cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum invoking the consideration of diffuse demyelinating disease, and multifocal infratentorial and supratentorial intraaxial lesions with \"necrotic-like\" character and marginal enhancement. Multifocal sites of perivascular space pathological enhancement has also been reported. Common to many of these reports is cerebellar involvement. The imaging differential diagnosis includes atypical infection, histocytic disorders of the CNS, lymphomatous granulomatosis, neurosarcoidosis, and primary CNS lymphoma. Purpose or Case Report: Spectral or multi-energy CT (MECT), obtains raw data at more than one energy spectra which allows the decomposition of materials into their constituent elements. As opposed to conventional CT which yields data based on linear attenuation, MECT yields both structural and materialspecific information. Only limited experience and literature are available regarding use and applications of MECT in the pediatric patient population. Our institution has recently installed a spectral MECT scanner which uses a single x-ray source modified multilayered detector CT, in our emergency department (ED). It is currently the only such scanner used for routine clinical pediatric imaging in the US, and 4 th such unit in a children's hospital in the world. In this educational exhibit we will review the basic physics of MECT, the benefits and limitations of the single-source multi-layered detector geometry, and clinical applications of MECT and our experience to date in the pediatric population. Methods & Materials: An IQon Spectral MECT (Philips Healthcare, Cleveland, OH) was installed in our facility in October, 2017. Though positioned in the ED, routine inpatients and outpatients are also examined. Results: We present brain, spine, facial trauma, and neck cases in which MECT aided in diagnosis through use of spectral data and propose areas of further clinical diagnoses and research. Clinical cases thus far examined include children suffering acute trauma, headache, and tumor. Features of MECT advantageous to pediatric patients include reconstruction of virtual non-contrast images, perfusion imaging, mitigation of beam-hardening artifact with high mono-energetic imaging, the use of low mono-energetic imaging to boost iodine density to improve angiographic images which may be limited by contrast or bolus timing, and urinary stone analysis and renal mass characterization. Conclusions: The use of Spectral MECT at our institution has provided a significant advance in our ability to confidently diagnose various disease processes. As we gain more experience in the use of MECT in the pediatric population, we will be able to better define its role and uncover further areas of research.",

In this educational poster we will review the appearance of a shunt with its three parts. We will correlate this to the imaging appearance of different shunt valves (programmable and nonprogrammable), and appropriate proximal and distal catheter positioning. We will describe the more common complications (i.e. shunt failure, subdural collections, slit ventriclular syndrome, etc.) associated with shunts in pediatric patients. The poster will also briefly highlight some of the relative advantages and disadvantages of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the assessment of hydrocephalus. Purpose or Case Report: The phakomatoses, or neurocutaneous syndromes, are the classically described congenital disorders with involvement of structures derived from the ectoderm. While the cutaneous manifestations of these conditions often establish their diagnosis, imaging characteristics can indicate the extent of disease and signify prognosis and potential complications related to the disorders. This educational poster reviews key multimodality imaging features and examples of infrequently encountered phakomatoses, including Sturge-Weber, von-Hippel Lindau disease, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, neurocutaneous melanosis, PHACES syndrome, basal cell nevus, and Parry-Romberg in pediatric patients. This case-based review of these syndromes will focus on relevant imaging findings with self-testing. After this electronic exhibit, residents will be able to describe the common imaging features of the less common phakomatoses.",

Significant restructuring has occurred for pediatric CNS tumors. For example, medulloblastomas are classified into four genetic subtypes. Other embryonal tumors such as embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes (ETMR) and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) are further defined by their molecular features. Also new entities have been added defined by both histology and molecular signatures including H3 K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma, RELA fusion-positive ependymoma and diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor (DLGNT). These more homogeneous and narrowly defined entities are expected to facilitate better classification, prognostication and patient stratification for precision therapy. This also improves the design of clinical trials and experimental models. In this presentation, we will review the new WHO classification scheme and review the imaging and as well as molecular/genetic features of pediatric CNS tumors.

Shawn Sato 1 ; 1 Department of Radiology, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, IA Disclosures: All authors have disclosed no financial interests, arrangements or affiliations in the context of this activity. Purpose or Case Report: Retroclival hematomas most often occur in pediatric patients following high speed motor vehicle accidents. Hematomas may involve the epidural, subdural, or subarachnoid spaces. Of these hematoma patterns, retroclival epidural hematomas are often associated with ligamentous injury to the tectorial membrane, transverse ligament, or alar ligament resulting in instability. Children's relatively large head size in proportion to their bodies, less muscular support and more superior fulcrum point of cranial vertebrae (C2-C3 in young children) relative to adults predispose pediatric patients to ligamentous injury. Retroclival subdural hematomas are the most often to be associated with non-accidental brain injuries. Therefore, when young non-ambulatory children present without significant trauma, it is not only imperative to recognize the radiographic findings of retroclival subdural hematomas, but to be cognizant of its association with child abuse. Radiological evaluation should include reconstructed sagittal CT images in soft tissue window as well as bone window. Special attention should be paid to the soft tissue window since hematomas often show low or intermediate attenuation on CT and can be easily missed on bone window. If only CT of the head is performed, extension to the craniocervical junction should be included. MRI, especially T2 weighted thin cut images are best suited for evaluation of ligamentous injury. STIR sequence can also provide ligamentous details as well as bone marrow edema. Methods & Materials: 1. Review craniovertebral junction anatomy as it pertains to retroclival hematomas. 2. Illustrate the retroclival hematoma injury patterns including epidural, subdural and subarachnoid bleeds. 3. Demonstrate the CT and MRI findings of retroclival hematoma and the significance of scrutiny of the soft tissue windows of the craniovertebral junction. Results: Demonstration of multiple cases involving retroclival hematomas with review of pertinent anatomical landmarks to help establish the diagnosis. Conclusions: It is important for pediatric radiologists to be familiar with this disease entity as findings can be subtle and therefore easily overlooked. Each of the hematoma patterns described is associated with certain traumatic injury to the spine or brain that requires different management. Retroclival hematomas among non-ambulatory children without significant trauma history should be considered as abusive injury until proven otherwise. Purpose or Case Report: Precocious puberty is defined as development of secondary sex characteristics before the age of 8 years in girls and 9 years in boys. Two types of precocious puberty have been recognized: central (CPP) and peripheral (PPP). The central precocious puberty is further divided into idiopathic or organic types. CNS imaging is indicated if CPP is diagnosed in boys at any age or in girls younger than 6 years. Different structural abnormalities are associated with CPP such as Hypothalamic hamartoma, Hypothalamic astrocytoma, germ cell tumors or suprasellar arachnoid cysts. The goals and objectives of the current presentation are as follow: 1-To briefly review the pathophysiology, clinical presentation and different types of CPP 2-To review the indications for CNS imaging work-up in children with CPP and to discuss the appropriate imaging modality and imaging protocol 3-To review different brain pathologies that are associated with CPP followed by discussion of main imaging characteristics through an interactive case series Methods & Materials: Review of the current literature and retrospectively research in our PACS database for patients scanned with clinical concern for central precocious puberty. Illustrative cases will be chosen and anonymized. Results: The exhibit will provide a brief review of the causes of central precocious puberty. Then, suggestions for dedicated imaging protocols will be provided, followed by an interactive series of illustrative cases of CPP.

Pearls and pitfalls in imaging will be discussed, including review of the normal distribution of FDG PET and major artifacts. Conclusions: Recognizing the utility of FDG PET of the brain, as well as its shortcomings and potential pitfalls, will help radiologists and clinicians better utilize this modality in the evaluation of pediatric epilepsy. Purpose or Case Report: Neuroblastoma is recognized as having a broad spectrum of clinical behavior in children diagnosed with the disease. Some tumors exhibit aggressive characteristics and portend a poor prognosis, while others that appear aggressive spontaneously regress. Accurately identifying high risk neuroblastoma is important in determining which patients will benefit most from intense chemotherapy, which unfortunately carries a risk of significant adverse effects later in life. Historically this has been difficult, as the classification schemes vary in different parts of the world, limiting the ability to pool data and improve prognostication. In recent years, efforts among experts around the globe have led to a consensus on the most evidenced based approach to staging. The aim of this educational exhibit is to describe the new standardized language for radiology reports, which will contribute to accurate staging and improve treatment for patients with neuroblastoma. Additionally, key imaging features highlighting image defined risk factors will be presented. Purpose or Case Report: Conventional cardiac MRI (CMR) acquisitions in children are limited by long acquisition time, need for sedation, and an inefficient workflow. A conventional cine SSFP short-axis stack typically takes 5-7 minutes to complete and is ineffective for subjects with arrhythmias. Available alternatives like free-breathing, real-time cine (RTcine) SSFP have suboptimal temporal and spatial resolution. Recent advances in compressed sensing (CS) MRI techniques may overcome this limitation. We hypothesize that a CS-based approach will allow the scan time for a short axis RT-cine stack to be shortened to less than a minute without compromising spatial or temporal resolution.",

The short-axis of the ventricles was covered with 14 slices in each patient. The spatial resolution for both acquisitions was 1.8x1.8x8 mm 3 ; temporal resolution was 32 ms (BH-cine) and 32 ms (RT-cine) per cardiac phase. End-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), ejection fraction (EF), and scan duration were computed using established methods, and compared between BH-cine and RTcine acquisitions using paired Student's t-test. Results: Both BH-cine and RT-cine images were deemed of diagnostic quality by two expert readers. The EDV, ESV and EF showed good agreement (Mean EDV (BH-cine first): 144 \u00b1 27 vs 137 \u00b1 27 ml, p = 0.03; mean ESV: 58.8 \u00b1 10.4 ml vs. 54.9 \u00b1 6.4, p = 0.29; and mean EF = 58.8 \u00b1 5% vs 54.9 \u00b1 6.4 % ;p = 0.03 ); see figure 1. The scan times were significantly shorter for RT-cine (2 heart beats/slice; ~45 seconds for entire 14 slice acquisition) compared with BH-cine acquisition (6-8 beats/slice; ~5:38 minutes for 14-slice acquisition, p< 0.01). Figure 2 shows representative images acquired. Conclusions: CS-based free-breathing RT-cine technique is feasible and provides images of comparable quality and diagnostic value when compared to conventional BH-cine SSFP, while significantly reducing scan time. It offers a potential solution to avoid the need for sedation for functional evaluation, improve diagnostic utility of MRI in arrhythmia, and improve CMR efficiency and workflow. Future reduction in reconstruction times, is needed prior to implementation of CSbased RT techniques into clinical practice.",

Colon was nonrotated in 7/9 cases, contralateral to the small bowel in 6/7 and on the same side as the small bowel in 1/7. Colon position was indeterminate in 1/9; not seen 1/9. Prenatal small bowel position corresponded to the UGI/SBFT or autopsy in all cases with nonrotation in 8/9; partial rotation of the duodenum in 1/9. Colon prenatal position corresponded to the SBFT/KUB or autopsy with nonrotation in 7/7 cases. Of the 2/9 with indeterminate prenatal colon position, postnatal colon was nonrotated. No postnatal cases were obstructed. Surgery confirmed diagnosis in 4/9; autopsy 1/9 cases. The prenatal MRI control group had GA ranging from 21 to 38 weeks and normal bowel rotation seen in all cases. Conclusions: Detection of bowel malrotation on prenatal MRI is possible with careful analysis of the small bowel and colon position. In a fetus with heterotaxy, prenatal analysis of the position of the bowel is useful secondary to the increased incidence of malrotation. If malrotation is suspected prenatally, postnatal evaluation prior to onset of symptoms may minimize potential for subsequent complication. Purpose or Case Report: Gadolinium deposition in normal tissues is an increasingly recognized consequence of intravenous gadolinium contrast agents. Children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) undergo frequent surveillance imaging with contrast enhanced MR enterography (MRE). Purpose: To determine the benefit (if any) of IV contrast in evaluation of IBD by MRE.",

            "text": "This was a retrospective, IRB approved study. The radiology information system was searched to identify all children who had undergone MRE and endoscopy within 6 weeks of each other in 2016. Imaging studies were interpreted by 2 radiologists, blinded to all clinical information, in 2 sessions 6 weeks apart (session 1 pre-contrast MRE; session 2 pre/post contrast MRE). The pre-and pre/post contrast assessment of bowel inflammation was assessed with respect to endoscopy. A logistic regression model was evaluated using receiver operating characteristics curves and expressed by c-statistics. The concordance of each assessment with endoscopy was compared by the c-statistics using the DeLong method. Agreement between the raters was evaluated using a Cohen's or the weighted kappa statistics, as appropriate, and 95% confidence interval. A two-sided P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Descriptive statistics were used for assessment of IBD complications, with pre/post MRE as the reference standard. Results: 52 children (46% female), mean age 13.2 (SD 3.42) years formed the study cohort. 77% (40/52) had evidence of inflammation on endoscopic biopsy. Pre/post contrast MRE showed no significant increase in the c-statistics compared to pre contrast MRE (Table 1) . Intravenous contrast showed no significant change in interobserver agreement for assessment of inflammation in either the small (kappa 0.92 pre MRE, 0.88 pre/post MRE) or large bowel (kappa 0.83 pre MRE, 0.73 pre/post MRE). IV contrast had no significant impact on interobserver agreement for length of small bowel inflamed (kappa 0.90 pre MRE, 0.95 pre/post MRE). Assessment of IBD complications was improved with IV contrast, with 3/5 cases with perianal penetrating disease not recognised on pre MRE. Conclusions: Routine administration of IV gadolinium has no impact on assessment of small or large bowel inflammation. However, there is potential for missing perianal penetrating disease using a non contrast protocol. Purpose or Case Report: Radiographic findings of right diaphragmatic eventration may overlap with true hernia if only liver herniates without bowel. We thus wanted to know the accuracy of ultrasonography (US) in the diagnosis of right diaphragmatic hernia.",

The medical record was reviewed for clinical presentation and surgical or pathologic diagnosis. US studies were reviewed for any diaphragm abnormalities. Surgical or pathology diagnosis was considered the gold standard. Results: 16 children (8 females, age range birth-16 months, mean 5.2 months) had US as well as surgery for eventration (n=7) or hernia (n=9; 6 Bochdalek and 3 Morgagni). The most common presentation was respiratory distress (12/16, 75%). US correctly diagnosed all 9 patients with hernia and misdiagnosed 3 patients with eventration, yielding 100% sensitivity for hernia, 57% specificity, and 81% accuracy. Presence of at least one of the following US findings increased the specificity to 86% with 100% sensitivity, and 94% accuracy: folding of the free diaphragmatic edge (n=8) or liver seen cranial to the diaphragm muscle (n=7).Conclusions: US imaging can be useful in the diagnosis of diaphragmatic hernia, although it is important to recognize presence of folding of free diaphragmatic edge and liver above the diaphragm muscle to improve specificity and overall accuracy.",

We identified all patients (1/2015-12/2016) who performed US for newly diagnosed HPS at an outside hospital (OSH), referred to our children's hospital. Only positive studies were included. Confidence of OSH diagnosis was grouped based on key words as follows: high confidence (compatible, positive, diagnostic of, consistent with, meet criteria for, highly suspicious), low (favor, concern, suspicious, suggesting, may represent), or equivocal (equivocal, non-diagnostic, borderline). OSH imaging and reports for discrepant cases were reviewed by a pediatric radiologist to determine reasons for false diagnosis. Surgical results were used as the gold standard for positive HPS, while the gold standard for negative HPS utilized was successful non operative management with no readmission for surgery on follow-up chart review. Results: 65 cases were referred from OSHs to our children's hospital. 6/65 (9.2%) were equivocal for HPS and 59 (90.8) positively identified HPS. Of the 59 cases that identified HPS, 30 (50.8%) did so with high confidence and 29 (49.2%) with low. 11/59 (18.6%) of cases diagnosed with HPS at OSH were not found to be HPS on further evaluation at our institution. Of discrepant cases 2/11 (18.2%) were diagnosed with high confidence by OSH and 9/11 (81.8%) low confidence. The most common 7/11 (%) reason for false positive results was misinterpretation of pylorospasm as HPS.In 13/59 (22.0%) the US were repeated in our children's hospital as the OSH study was considered technically limited. Conclusions: US for evaluation of HPS performed by nonpediatric radiologist is a limited study. About half of the positive studies were read with low confidence and 18% of the studies were false positives.",

A subset of patients with findings that are incompletely characterized by ultrasound or who have no sonographic evidence of disease but persistent clinical suspicion may receive magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). Pediatric inpatients who obtain an MRCP often experience longer inpatient stays, higher costs and delays in management. Relying on the sonographic findings or pursuing more advanced imaging as an outpatient may be a better option. To our knowledge, there have been no studies that have assessed whether inpatient MRCP performed following TUS in pediatric patients resulted in significant changes to additional inpatient treatment rendered. Our group ultimately looks to develop interdepartmental guidelines on when pursuit of an inpatient MRCP after TUS is indicated.",

            "text": "Our hospital is a pediatric, tertiary referral, level I trauma center with multiple transplantation services and approximately 80,000 emergency department visits each year. We sought to evaluate imaging data and clinical records for all patients at our hospital who received TUS followed by inpatient MRCP evaluation in 2016. This allowed us to investigate if MRCP studies performed after transabdominal ultrasound changed inpatient clinical management in pediatric patients with suspected pancreatohepatobiliary disease. The change was assessed by either an additional inpatient procedure or new treatment administered based on MRCP findings. Results: There were a total of 101 inpatient MRCPs performed in 2016, of which 84 had a preceding abdominal ultrasound performed. Of these 84 MRCPs, 28 (33.3%) resulted in additional diagnostic information not seen on the ultrasound. Of these 28 studies, there were only eight cases in which the additional information obtained from the MRCP lead to an additional inpatient procedure or new treatment during the course of the patients hospital stay (Figure 1 and Table 1) . Conclusions: Transabdominal ultrasound is the primary screening modality for pediatric pancreatohepatobiliary disease. For some patients, obtaining ultrasound alone, serial ultrasound evaluations, or outpatient MRCP may be sufficient for evaluation. Inpatient MRCP may be over utilized, as only 8 out of 101 (7.9%) of MRCPs performed lead to a significant change in inpatient clinical management. Purpose or Case Report: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn disease, is a cause of significant morbidity in the pediatric population. Perirectal disease is a Crohn related complication affecting as many as 62% of children. Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) is being increasingly utilized in characterizing the extent of IBD. Dedicated perirectal disease imaging, such as a T2 SPACE, requires an additional 10-15 minutes of imaging time on an already time constrained modality. The goal of our study was to determine the best imaging protocol for patients without clinically suspicious perirectal disease based on the incidence in this population.",

Patients with prior history of perirectal disease or who had clinically suspected perirectal disease by the treating gastrointestinal physician were excluded. All patients in our study population received dedicated perirectal sequences in addition to the conventional MRE sequences. The study population was evaluated for presence of perirectal disease on MRE. Local institutional review board was approved for this study. Results: A total of 301 patients had MRE for IBD during our two year time frame. Forty-two patients were excluded due to prior clinical suspicion of perirectal disease, yielding 267 patients in our total population. Fourteen patients (5%) had MRE findings of perirectal disease, five (35%) were found to have perirectal abscess and seven (50%) had a perirectal fistula or fistulous tract. Conclusions: Our study found a 5% incidence rate of perirectal disease in IBD patients without clinical suspicion of perirectal disease. Thus, radiologists need to be aware of this population to add on perirectal sequences where needed to conventional MRE examinations. However, it is an inefficient use of resources to routinely perform perirectal sequences on this group of patients.",

            "text": "In this IRB approved retrospective study, patients who underwent pelvic ultrasound because of abdominal or pelvic pain between 2005 and 2015 were identified and classified as either torsion-absent or torsion-confirmed, based on final radiologic and surgical evidence. Of patients with torsion, patients less than 1 year of age were excluded as infants with torsion have different presentation and imaging features than older patients. In total, 99 torsion-confirmed and 331 sequential torsion-absent cases from 2015 were included. Radiologic features extracted from the ultrasound images included binary variables of presence of Doppler flow, free fluid, peripheral follicles, as well as ovary medialization and the continuous variables of right and left ovarian size. These features were fed into supervised learning systems to find viable decision algorithms. Data was divided into 60% training and 40% validation data sets and performance was assessed using sub-sets of the validation set. Results: All variables had statistically significant differences between the torsion-confirmed and torsion-absent groups with pvalues < 0.005 (Table 1 ). Using single variables to identify torsion provided only modest detection performance with areas under the curve (AUC) for medialization, peripheral follicles, and absence of flow of 0.76+/-.16, 0.66+/-0.14, and 0.82 +/-.14 respectively. The best decision tree (Fig. 1) using a combination of variables yielded an AUC of 0.96 +/-0.07 and required knowledge of the presence of flow, peripheral follicles, the volume of both ovaries, and presence of cysts. Conclusions: An algorithm combining multiple ultrasound imaging features associated with ovarian torsion performs better than simple approaches relying on singular features. While complex combinations using multiple interaction models provide slightly better performance, a clinically pragmatic decision tree can be employed to detect torsion and provide sensitivity levels of 95+/-14% with a specificity of 92 +/-2%. Purpose or Case Report: Ultrasound has long been a readily available, noninvasive, and accurate means of evaluating the female pelvis and is widely used in the emergency setting for girls with abdominal and pelvic pain. One key element in evaluating for pathology is to measure ovarian size and compare left and right ovaries. Normative volume data stratified by age are available; however, these studies suffer from lack of numbers, and frequently older equipment. Technological advances in ultrasonic hardware and software have increased the resolution of both gray-scale and Doppler imaging. Increases in Purpose or Case Report: To describe the fluoroscopic practice patterns during pregnancy in pediatric radiologists and potential impact on professional relationships and career. Methods & Materials: An anonymous online survey was sent to SPR members via email. Results: Of 398 responses (65% female, 35% male), most females (78%) reported being pregnant while practicing radiology. The majority (72%) announced their pregnancy during the first trimester. Factors affecting the timing and decision to announce pregnancy included fear of miscarriage (43%), impact of co-workers having to perform extra work during maternity leave (42%), impact of co-workers having to perform extra fluoroscopy during pregnancy (32%), negative reaction from co-workers (22%), and fear of negative impact on career (21%). The majority (85%) performed fluoroscopy during pregnancy. Forty percent felt they had a choice whether to perform fluoroscopy; 28% said it depended on the pregnancy; and 32% felt they had no choice. Most performed fluoroscopy during all 3 trimesters (1st 78%, 2nd 90%, 3rd 87%). The majority (81%) double leaded; 45% asked a coworker to cover fluoroscopy; 38% observed trainees performing fluoroscopy; 37% used a lead shield. Forty-six percent felt their fluoroscopic responsibilities during pregnancy were stressful. Physical demands included lead aprons being too heavy (42%) or not fitting (29%), and back pain (38%), and 26% described no extra physical demands. Of all male and female survey respondents, 56% have had to cover fluoroscopy for a pregnant co-worker; a majority (76%) did not consider this burdensome. Twenty percent of women Purpose or Case Report: Treatment pathways for isolated distal radius fractures in children are evolving and becoming more tailored to specific fracture types, including different management plans for stable buckle fractures (BFs) versus unstable distal radius fractures (DRFs). We propose a measurement rule to aid differentiation of stable BFs from unstable DRFs in children. Methods & Materials: IRB approval was waived for this retrospective QI project. Medical record search identified children with closed radius fractures during a 14month period. Demographic and other study data were collected and recorded using REDCap. Original radiology reports were compared to consensus diagnosis of two senior readers, which was used as the reference standard. Agreement was calculated using Cohen's Kappa statistic. Fracture to distal radial physis distance was measured in mm on PA and Lateral (LAT) views. Diagnostic accuracy using fracture distance as a predictor for buckle fractures was analyzed on both views. An ROC curve was used to determine the cutoff values tested. Results: There were 148 BFs (73%), 55 isolated DRFs (27%). Agreement between the original report and final diagnosis was 'slight' (\u03ba=0.120, SE=0.058, n=203). The BF to physis distance was < 1cm in only 1 of 106 (0.9%) children 7-16y on PA view. No older children had a BF to physis distance <1 cm on LAT view and the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for BF diagnosis were all above 82% using a cut off of 14mm (PA) and 13 mm (LAT). The BF to physis distance was < 1cm in 1 (2.4%) of 42 children 3-6y on PA view and another 1(2.4%) on LAT view. Diagnostic accuracy was low for children <7 years old for all tested distances. The areas under the ROC curve increased after excluding patients <7y: 0.822 to 0.867 (PA) and 0.819 to 0.874 (LAT). Diagnostic odds ratios also increased when excluding patients < 7y: from 11.375 to 24.612 (>14mm PA) and from 10.095 to 22.815 (>13mm LAT). Conclusions: An isolated distal radius fracture in a child is not likely to be a BF if the fracture to physis distance is < 1 cm. We propose measurement cut offs to increase diagnostic accuracy in children \u2265 7y. Using measurements to differentiate stable BFs and unstable DRFs is less reliable in younger children.",

The rates of agreement for potential choices, and additional suggestions were discussed amongst the group after each survey, ultimately yielding to a structured WB-MRI scoring system for JIA. Results: Eighteen to 22 experts participated in three rounds of Delphi surveys and a concluding consensus meeting. A first iteration scoring system was developed that ultimately included assessment of 40 joints, representation of both axial and peripheral joints, 2-5 diagnostic items graded in each, and inclusion of levels from binary (presence/absence) to 4-level ordinal scoring. Recommendations specific to the imaging of each joint, consisting of anatomical planes and MRI sequences were constructed as a preliminary, minimally necessary imaging protocol to supplement the scoring system. Conclusions: A novel WB-MRI scoring system for JIA was developed by consensus. Further iterative refinements, feasibility, reliability and responsiveness testing are warranted in upcoming studies. Purpose or Case Report: SPICA MRI with gadolinium contrast administration is routinely performed after closed reduction for the treatment of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). Quantifying the degree of femoral head enhancement and abduction angles are routinely performed to identify and stratify those patients who may be at risk for epiphyseal osteonecrosis. The purpose of our study is to evaluate predictors for epiphyseal osteonecrosis based on percentage enhancement and abduction angles evaluated based on SPICA MRI.",

Very young patients who may be victims of child abuse, but who may not be able to express themselves, must be distinguished from those who have low bone mineralization due to disease. Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) has been used to evaluate volumetric bone mineral density (BMD) in children, but there is little information on BMD in very young subjects. 1,2 The goal of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of using QCT to evaluate BMD and volume (Vol) of lumbar vertebral bodies in children and to establish the need for a separate comparative database to evaluate these parameters in subjects less than 6 years.",

IRB approval to study anonymous data is not required. BMD and Vol of the vertebral body were evaluated on one image in a region of interest (ROI) through the mid-vertebral body (Figure 1 ). Volume was computed using an assumed 3-mm slice thickness. Student's ttests were performed to determine if BMD and Vol at each level differed between subjects of different groups. Linear regression analysis of the two groups separately was used to determine if BMD and Vol at each level were associated with age. A significance level of p<0.05 was used. Results: BMD was virtually independent of age in the younger group but increased with age at multiple levels in the older group (Tables 1-2, Figure 2 ). In contrast, Vol in 13-17yo was more than twice that in <6yo at all levels (p<0.002). Volume increased 0.09 to 0.29 cm 3 /yr in subjects <6yo (0.33 \u2264 R 2 \u2264 0.61, p \u2264 0.04), but was not associated with age in 13-17yo (p>0.7). Conclusions: This study demonstrated a QCT method for evaluating bone mineralization in very young subjects and showed that a separate normative database is needed for subjects less than 6 years. With future work, this method may be helpful for distinguishing very young patients who may be victims of child abuse from those with low bone mineralization due to disease or a metabolic process. ",

We recorded age, FSIQ scores, scan information and the radiologist's reports. We defined success of the fMRI by the radiologist's ability to locate Broca's and Wernicke's areas in their report. Under the old protocol, patient preparation consisted of a 10minute verbal explanation before the MRI consisting of 2 language tasks. Under the new protocol, the practice session lasted 60 minutes using a mock MRI scanner. Tasks were first practiced seated and then supine in the mock scanner. Coaching with real-time feedback was given during the practice and exam. Information from practice was used to select and modify tasks according to patient's ability. We increased the number of language tasks, and an additional specialist was responsible for task practice and coaching during the exam. On average 6 language tasks were administered during the MRI, increasing total length over the old protocol. Results: We identified 33 preoperative language-mapping fMRI scans of children with epilepsy. 13 of 33 were done under the old protocol with a mean age of 16 (range 12 -19 years). FSIQ scores were available for 10 of the 14 patients with a mean score of 84 (range 62 -108). 19 of 33 scans were done after institution of an new protocol with mean age of 14 (range 8 -19 years). FSIQ scores were available for 14 of the 19 patients with a mean score of 75 (range 49 -111). The radiologist could identify Broca's area in 9 of 14 scans (64%) under the old protocol, and 18/19 (95%) with the new protocols. The radiologist could identify Wernicke's area in 9 of 14 scans (64%) under the old protocol, and 19/19 (100%) of scans with the new protocol. Using the z-statistic for two group proportions, the success rate between new and old protocols were significantly different (p<0.05), with p=0.035 for Broca's and p=0.005 for Wernicke's. Conclusions: Higher pediatric fMRI success rates can be achieved with intensive patient preparation in an fMRI practice session using a mock scanner.Poster #: SCI-045The Pediatric Upper Airway: Thoroughfares and Road blocks Mark Whitehead, PA 2 , markallenwhitehead@gmail.com; Matthew Whitehead, MD 1 ; 1 Neuroradiology, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC, 2 Just 4 Kids Pediatrics, Hohenwald, TN Disclosures: All authors have disclosed no financial interests, arrangements or affiliations in the context of this activity.Purpose or Case Report: The human airway is fundamental to respiratory gas transmission and oxygen exchange.

Data was available from 2010-2017. Chart review was performed. Operative findings, pertinent demographic and clinical information was recorded. Preoperative MR imaging of 14 patients with surgically confirmed cSDH was retrospectively reviewed. NECT was reviewed if available. Imaging was surveyed by a senior pediatric neuroradiologist and a senior radiology resident. This retrospective study is pending approval by the Institutional Review Board.Results: 14 patients with 19 drained subdural compartments were identified. The majority of MR imaging was performed within 3 days antecedent to drainage (84%). Most cases were determined to be sequelae of non-accidental trauma (74%). Using gray matter as an internal control, the fluid signal characteristics were recorded (table 1) . All cases showed internal membranes (figure 1). The majority of the membranes demonstrated post contrast enhancement and a minority of cases showed enhancement of the meningeal dura (table 2) . A subjective determination was made as to which axial sequence showed the membranes most conspicuously. Membranes were determined to be most conspicuous on SWI (61%) or T2 (39%) in all cases. All sequences and planes were then evaluated to determine which best demonstrated membranes. Coronal T2 (31%), axial T2 (31%), and axial SWI (37%) were nearly equal. Conclusions: Our data of the signal characteristics of cSDH shares some similarities with current literature. We chronicle the paradoxical signal features of T2* and SWI as well as the confounding variability of T1, T2, and FLAIR imaging. However, analysis of fluid characteristics alone provides an incomplete evaluation of cSDH. Importantly, in our cohort, all patients demonstrated internal membranes within the cSDH and assessment of these structures is critical. Our results showed the most useful sequences for detection of membranes to be T2 and SWI, particularly when obtained in orthogonal planes. The administration of intravenous contrast was of limited utility in the evaluation of cSDH.",

Electronic records were queried to identify patients undergoing WB-MRI for cancer staging, CPS surveillance or evaluation for osteonecrosis. A single pediatric radiologist reviewed all studies to confirm findings in the report. Electronic medical records of imaging and notes within one year of WB-MRI were reviewed to assess impact on clinical management. Results: A total of 24 patients were included: 12 undergoing cancer staging (5 neuroblastoma, 2 Ewing sarcoma, 5 lymphoma), 5 undergoing CPS surveillance (4 hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma syndrome (HPPS), 1 Li-Fraumeni syndrome) and 7 undergoing evaluation for osteonecrosis. In the staging group, WB-MRI demonstrated known disease in 12 of 12 (100%) patients when compared to concurrent scintigraphy, PET, SPECT or CT/MR imaging ( fig  1) . In the CPS group, no new lesions were seen on follow-up imaging in 5 of 5 patients (fig 2) . WB-MRI identified known lesions in 1 of 2 (50%) HPPS patients, failing to detect a vertebral lesion seen on PET imaging. In the osteonecrosis group, WB-MRI confirmed osteonecrosis in 6 of 7 patients (86%) and ruled it out in 1 of 7 (14%). Imaging affected the decision to continue, hold or restart steroids in all 6 patients with steroid-based treatment plans (fig 3) . In one patient, WB-MRI identified an area of sub-clinical osteonecrosis in the femoral head.Conclusions: This preliminary single-institution study demonstrates the value of WB-MRI in pediatric cancer staging, surveillance and chemotherapy-related osteonecrosis. Study limitations included population size and retrospective nature of the analysis. We note that WB-MRI was used as an adjunct to other imaging modalities in our population, and further studies will be needed to assess WB-MRI performance in the pediatric oncology population as the sole surveillance imaging modality.",

Results: 1348 reports (595 inpatient, 124 ER, and 92 outpatient; 1129 ultrasound, 129 CT, and 90 MRI) from 1175 patients (1140 female, 208 male; mean 12 +/-6 years) were identified. The most common diagnoses were infection (abscess, cellulitis, mastitis) (n=244 patients), fibroadenoma (n=231 patients), gynecomastia (n=80 patients), breast buds (n=51 patients), ductal ectasia (n=30 patients), and hematoma (n=27 patients). Neoplastic disease was questioned in 16 patients; histopathology revealed 5 fibroadenomas, 1 hyperplastic lymph node, and 1 lipoma. The remaining 9 patients were either lost to follow-up (n=6) or considered to have benign disease after breast surgery consultation (n=3). There were no proven cases of breast carcinoma, sarcoma, or lymphoma. Conclusions: Pediatric breast imaging encompasses an array of typically benign etiologies. Breast disease in the pediatric population is generally benign; we found no proven cases of neoplastic breast disease in an academic children's hospital setting over 10 consecutive years.

Focused history was taken and imaging was performed at the site of pain. Images of the bilateral 7th-11th ribs were obtained in the parasagittal plane at rest and with dynamic maneuvers. Dynamic maneuvers included Valsalva, crunch, focal rib push/compression, and any other provocative movement that elicited pain per the patient. Imaging results were correlated with medical and surgical records generated by the pediatric surgeon specializing in treatment of slipping ribs. (3/3) . Two of the three examinations which did not detect SRS did not utilize dynamic crunch or push maneuvers. In the last patient, crunch was performed, but push maneuver was not. All but one exam utilizing the crunch and push maneuver correctly detected SRS. Conclusions: Dynamic Ultrasound imaging of the ribs, Purpose or Case Report: The purpose of this submission is to educate technologists in performing magnetic resonance (MR) lymphangiography in conjunction with intranodal gadolium contrast injection in the pediatric patient. MR lymphangiography is a new procedure in the pediatric population. The lymphatic system plays the important role of transporting fluid from tissue back into the venous system via lymphovenous connections. Despite this key role, there has been a poor understanding of lymphatic flow physiology. The recent development of dynamic contrast intranodal MR lymphangiography, which provides quick and reliable access to the central lymphatic system, has provided insight into understanding the pathophysiology of several lymphatic flow disorders and provides guidance for interventional procedures. It also makes it possible to see central lymphatic anatomy with high spatial and temporal resolution. This allows clinicians to map the anatomy of the lymphatic system to determine the location of lymphatic leaks. MR lymphangiography may reduce the need for conventional IR lymphangiogram and spare patient's radiation exposure.",

Precontrast sequences include coronal T2 \"Sampling Perfection with Application Optimized Contrasts using Different Flip Angle Evolution\" (SPACE), axial coronal and sagittal with \"True Fast Imaging with Steady State Free Precession\" (TRUFI) and precontrast coronal T1 \"Volumetric Interpolated Breathhold Examination\" (VIBE). Subsequently, under ultrasound guidance, 22-gauge spinal needles are inserted into bilateral inguinal lymph nodes and gadolinium followed by saline is injected into the lymph nodes timed over a duration of 15 minutes. TWIST sequences are acquired as well as delayed postcontrast sequences. Results: MR lymphangiography was performed in several patients who received conventional IR lymphangiogram contemporaneously. Qualitative evaluation of these cases indicates that MR lymphangiography may be diagnostically adequate for evaluation of lymphatic disorders. Conclusions: MR lymphangiography requires complex coordination between anesthesia, interventional radiology (IR) and the MR divisions. Despite these challenges, our recently developed MR lymphangiography protocol has been successfully performed in several patients and early validation looks promising.",

At times, utilizing this technology may be the only way to visualize anatomy due to factors such as maternal body habitus or fetal position. Our goal is provide the audience with the information and techniques required to take a volume sweep acquisition and obtain numerous rendering modes to evaluate the fetal craniofacial area. Aims: 1. To describe utility and benefit of acquiring volume ultrasound in detection of craniofacial anomalies in prenatal patients. 2. To describe tips, tricks, and current technology to optimize imaging and assist in minimizing equivocal exams.vovulus. This is when the gut twists counterclockwise around the superior mesenteric artery and vein causing a narrowing. This may cause abdominal distention and pain or acute bowel necrosis. It can also be life threatening or lead to a lifelong dependence on total parenteral nutrition, so surgical correction is the dependent treatment. When medical history and physical examination indicate a suspicion of malrotation and vovulus, patients must undergo blood tests and diagnostic imaging studies to evaluate the position of the intestine to determine if there is blockage or twisting. The imaging modality of choice remains the upper GI study. This is a fluoroscopic study using barium contrast to look at the upper and middle sections of the gastrointestinal tract. A radiologist's knowledge of normal anatomy is important in performing and interpreting the upper GI series. From a technical standpoint common pitfalls during this test that can lead to a misdiagnosis would be imaging quality. Improper patient positioning, nonsufficient images taken and the wrong amount of contrast administered during the most crucial part of the study can lead to false findings. The purpose of this abstract is to present case studies and imaging which mimic intestinal rotation but are a normal variant vs. actual cases of malrotation.",

DR systems in medical imaging have transformed planar xray, one of the oldest imaging modalities. Computed radiography (CR) and DR share some of the same image quality challenges including poor positioning, inappropriate techniques, and motion. There are image quality issues unique to DR that may be unfamiliar to new operators. Although, artifacts have been a part of imaging since the use of film-screen xray, with DR, the technologists have to be aware of new artifacts related to digital acquisition and processing. At times, pediatric DR imaging can present even bigger challenges. Technologists must learn methods to avoid DR imaging artifacts, and how to identify them before sending the image to the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). This exhibit will review how to identify common DR imaging artifacts, explain the reason they occur, and suggest methods to reduce their interference with image quality.",

A physicist was consulted regarding the source of these DR image quality issues. A radiologist was consulted to assess how much these artifacts interfere with clinical interpretation. Image quality issues were evaluated for their appearance on both image viewing station and the radiologist viewing station in order to assess differences in conspicuity and appearance. Example cases were identified where DR artifacts are significantly more prominent on high resolution PACS monitors than they appear at the technologists work station. A case-based technologist staff education was developed.Results: A case-based educational module was developed that reviews common artifacts in DR, the physical principles behind these artifacts, and their effect on diagnostic quality. Methods to reduce or eliminate these artifacts were reviewed and summarized. A protocol to communicate with Radiologists regarding digital artifacts was developed including best practices for determining when repeat imaging is required.",

Case based education on artifacts unique to digital imaging may reduce image quality issues and the need for repeat imaging leading to reduced radiation exposure in children. To identify a decrease in sedations after the installation of the SOMATOM Force, we analyzed sedation percentages before the installation to the sedation percentages after installation. A report was created within our EMR system to identify patients five years and younger that received CT imaging of the thorax and/or abdomen/pelvis. An additional report was generated by the sedation physicians' data regarding the number of sedations for the same time reference. These reports were analyzed and compared to generate the overall percentage of sedations. Results: Four months of data prior to the installation of the Siemens SOMATOM Force revealed sedation percentages on an average of 34.5% of patients aged five years and younger. The first full month after installation of the Siemens SOMATOM Force revealed a decrease in sedations to 15% of patients aged five years and younger. Conclusions: Installation of the Siemens SOMATOM Force at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Scottish Rite has resulted in a decrease in the sedation of patients five years and younger receiving CT imaging of the thorax and/or abdomen/pelvis.",

An approaching hurricane meant the area had to be reassessed for its ability to be used during violent weather. Inpatient imaging: Patient simulations were performed to determine which pieces of medical equipment could fit onto the mobile CT lift when transporting the patient from ground level into the scanner. Earlier communication to pertinent hospital personnel, notably Emergency Department and ICU staff, would have allowed for more education in preparation for transporting patients to the mobile CT. Issues around severe trauma and unstable ICU patients would have been addressed with more time for preparation. With more notice and simulations, staff in these critical areas would have been more prepared for the utilization of the mobile CT scanner. Emergency and Sedation Preparation: Anesthesiology and Sedation Services were involved in the process. Ultimately, Anesthesia decided that patients could not be safely performed at the mobile location, and these patients were performed on a PET/CT scanner. The sedation team was able to provide its services off-site, but again, simulations and early involvement were key. Security and the Code Team were also engaged to ensure that responses to codes were prompt and the site wellknown.",
