The investigational new drug ataluren is a protein restoration therapy designed to enable the formation of a functioning protein in patients with genetic disorders caused by a nonsense mutation.

Proteome/interactome maintenance by the proteostasis network (PN) is very dynamic -promoting/protecting proteome health both inside and outside cells found in diverse tissue and organ environments in response to stress and inherited disease such as cystic fibrosis (CF) (Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol (2011) 3 pii: a004499). Human biology has taught us that inherited folding chal-lenges such as found in CF alters the kinetics and energetics of key steps in a multistep folding landscape that can be routinely managed by changes in the proteostasis language, a feature of folding biology that offers us numerous opportunities to intercede with therapeutics that modulate the composition and/or function of the PN code to protect the host from folding disease such as found in \u2206F508 CFTR variant. By use of proteome-oriented mass spectrometry and bioinformatic tools we are building a multilayered view of healthy biological protein folding and the changes that occur in response to proteostasis targeted therapeutics to alleviate the folding stress that alters the protein fold function found in misfolding disease, potentially pointing toward new therapeutic approaches to CF. G551D mutation demonstrated sweat chloride reductions of almost 60 mmol and significant, dose-related changes in nasal PD. The first randomised, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, multinational phase 3 study was conducted in adults and children over the age of 12 with at least one copy of the G551D mutation. The primary outcome was FEV1, in which significant improvements of over 10 absolute percentage points were maintained out to 48 weeks. These were accompanied by a reduction in the exacerbation rate, significant weight gain, a similar large drop in sweat chloride to that seen in Phase 2 and improvements in the CF-specific quality of life tool, CFQ-R. The drug was shown to be safe, with adverse events equally reported in both arms. A second Phase 3 study in children aged 6-11 years has recently reported similar magnitude of change in FEV1 and significant improvements in weight and BMI. The majority of patients from both these trials rolled over into the open-label phase of the study and long term results are encouraging from both efficacy and safety perspectives.

Nine CFTR mutations associated with severe gating disturbance and responsive to ivacaftor in vitro have indeed been identified (1) .

The same was true for sweat chloride. Further evaluation of improvement in sweat chloride and lung function parameters will solve the question whether sweat chloride can be used as a marker of efficacy: whether it can be used quantitatively, i.e., the response predicts the size of the clinical benefit or qualitatively, i.e., the response predicts benefit but not size of it.

In many instances, the mutations do not affect specific functional sites but rather cause conformational changes that are unnecessarily recognized by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control system as misfolded leading to their intracellular retention and degradation. Examples of such loss of function conformational diseases include nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) and early-onset severe obesity that result from mutations in the vasopressin receptor type 2 (V2R) and the melanocortin receptor type 4 (MC4R) respectively. For both V2R and MC4R, we found that cell-permeant ligands, which bind to the receptors, increase cell surface expression and rescue their function; an observation leading to the concept of pharmacological chaperones (1) (2) (3) . By binding to the mutated receptors, pharmacological chaperones promote their proper folding, maturation and trafficking. For NDI, a V2R selective pharmacological chaperone was found to significantly improve patients' condition in a small clinical trial establishing its therapeutic value (4) . In order to establish an in-vivo proof of principle that the concept can be extended to early-onset severe obesity, we generated a novel model for MC4Rpormoted obesity. The potential therapeutic value of MC4R pharmacological chaperones is currently being tested in this new model of genetic severe obesity. Although pharmacological chaperones target directly the misfolded receptors, compounds that would interfere with the ER quality control system could also represent potential drug candidates for the treatment of conformational diseases. To identify potential targets, we performed a large scale bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based screen to identify proteins involved in the ER processing of GPCRs. Cornichon homolog-4 (CNIH4) was identified as one of the proteins selectively interacting in the ER with many GPCRs. Through the formation of a complex with COP-II vesicle proteins and other ER-resident proteins CNIH4 was found to play an important role in the ERexport of GPCRs. Whether such proteins may also represent targets for the treatment of conformational diseases remains to be established. ",

Despite the ongoing debate about whether these aggregates are cytotoxic or a protective mechanism, there is general agreement that these aggregates suggest some common etiology. In addition to diseasespecific proteins, aggregates contain other cellular proteins which may reflect a more general cellular stress response. Post-mortem studies have suggested pervasive disturbances of mitochondrial function (4) including energy balance and oxidation. For most of these neurodegenerative diseases, there appear to be both idiopathic (unknown) causes as well as genetic mutations in specific proteins found within these aggregates. Naturally, the genetics represent a sufficiently compelling handle by which to develop potential therapeutic agents, aimed at reducing or inhibiting these proteins.",

            "text": "Research in both CF and neurodegenerative diseases have contributed to expanding interest in regulatory processes of protein translation, folding, degradation and trafficking to different sites within the cell. Approaching protein homeostasis from opposite ends of the process, CF focused on protein biogenesis (increasing CFTR) and neurodegenerative diseases focused on protein degradation (removing toxic misfolded protein), have highlighted the quality control processes of protein folding. Recent advances in the understanding of these quality control processes in neurodegenerative disease will be used to illustrate potential new directions for developing CF therapeutics. In the classical form of \u03b11antitrypsin deficiency (ATD) a point mutation renders a hepatic secretory protein prone to misfolding and polymerization/aggregation. The mutant protein, \u03b11antitrypsin Z (ATZ), accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of liver cells, causing liver fibrosis and carcinogenesis by a gain-of-toxic function mechanism, which we will refer to as its \"proteotoxic\" effect. We know that there are least two general mechanisms by which ATZ may be degraded after it accumulates in the ER: the proteosomal pathway is responsible for disposal of soluble forms of ATZ and the autophagic pathway is uniquely responsible for disposal of insoluble ATZ and perhaps some soluble ATZ. Our recent studies have also suggested that there is a nonproteosomal, non-autophagic pathway for intracellular disposal of ATZ that is regulated by the insulin signaling pathway. Recently, we investigated the hypothesis that the accumulation of ATZ in hepatocytes and its proteotoxic effects reflect an inability of these disposal pathways to handle the hepatic ATZ load and that pharmacological enhancement of intracellular ATZ disposal prevents or ameliorates liver damage in ATD. Our progress has validated this hypothesis in showing that one drug, carbamazepine (CBZ), which enhances the autophagic degradation of ATZ reduces the hepatic load of ATZ and reverses hepatic fibrosis in a mouse model of ATD. Because CBZ is FDA-approved and has been used safely in humans as an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer it has rapidly moved into a clinical trial for severe liver dis-ease due to ATD. Using a novel and powerful C. elegans (worm) model of ATD in a high-content automated screening platform we discovered 5 additional compounds that reduce intracellular ATZ accumulation and 4 of these compounds have been found to enhance autophagic disposal of ATZ. Two of these drugs, which are FDA-approved as mood stabilizers, have been shown to reduce ATZ accumulation in mammalian cell line models of ATD. Futher, a pharmacophore model developed by computational analysis of this screen has been validated and can now be used to identify additional drug candidates. Finally, in preliminary studies we found that computational pharmacological strategies for analyzing RNAi screens of the worm model of ATD have identified novel candidate drugs for treatment of ATD. Together, the studies have provided evidence that endogenous proteostasis mechanisms can be utilized for therapeutic interventions for disorders caused by misfolded proteins and autophagy enhancer drugs appear to be particularly promising examples.",

Amicus Therapeutics, Cranbury, NJ, USA A large number of inherited diseases result from mutations that lead to a destabilized, unfolded or misfolded protein. Cystic fibrosis (CF) and Fabry disease are two examples where missense, small insertion or deletion mutations result in translated mutant proteins that retain some function but are largely unable to pass the protein quality control system for export out of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Instead, these conformationally challenged proteins are more commonly tagged for disposal by the ER-associated degradation pathway. Phar-macological chaperone therapy is an investigational approach currently in clinical development for the treatment of CF (e.g., Vertex Pharmaceuticals) and Fabry disease (e.g., GlaxoSmithKline Plc/Amicus Therapeutics). Pharmacological chaperones are small molecules that selectively bind and stabilize the native conformation of mutant proteins, allowing them to pass the ER quality control system and to be transported and delivered to their final functional location (e.g., cell surface, lysosomes). Pharmacological chaperone therapy therefore represents a new class of treatment for patients with diseases that result from protein destabilization, unfolding or misfolding.",

This accumulation of GL-3 is believed to cause the various symptoms of Fabry disease, including pain, kidney failure, and increased risk of heart disorders and stroke.

Oral administration of migalastat HCl to Fabry Tg/KO mice resulted in significant and dosedependent increases in \u03b1-Gal A activity, with concomitant GL-3 reduction in skin, heart, kidney, brain, and plasma that were comparable to those obtained with intravenous injections of agalsidase beta.",

Acquisition of both Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) in the CF airway may occur early in life and is associated with more rapid decline in pulmonary function (8) . The likelihood of acquisition of PA is increased by the use of antistaphylococcal prophylaxis; exposure to other CF patients with PA; nebulizer use; hospitalization for viral respiratory infection or treatment with IV antibiotics; and female sex (9) . Respiratory viral infections also appear to be associated with more rapid progression of CF airway disease, at least in the short term (10) .",

Nutritional status is highly correlated with pulmonary function in patients with CF, and while the causal relationship is to some extent bidirectional, there is strong evidence that early nutritional inadequacy is deleterious to the lung (15, 16) . The mechanism of this relationship is unclear. 19 Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene (1) . Although bacterial lung infection and the resulting inflammation cause most of the morbidity and mortality, how the loss of CFTR first disrupts airway host defense has remained uncertain. Proposed origins of CF lung disease include reduced mucociliary clearance due to decreased airway surface liquid (ASL) volume or altered mucus, reduced bacterial killing by ASL antimicrobials, defective bacterial elimination by phagocytes, abnormal inflammatory responses, reduced or increased bacterial binding by airway epithelia, and other defects (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . One or more of these defects could be responsible. Two factors have made it difficult to distinguish between hypotheses and identify initiating insults. First, as with many diseases, clinical manifestations may not reflect original deects, but it is problematic to study CF at its onset in newborn human infants. Second, mice with disrupted CFTR genes do not develop typical CF (7) . To circumvent these obstacles, we generated CFTR -/pigs (CF pigs) (8) , which spontaneously develop hallmark features of CF lung disease (8, 9) . At birth, their lungs lack infection and inflammation, but have a reduced ability to eradicate bacteria (9) . Thus, newborn CF pigs provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate mechanisms impairing host defense and initiating disease because they allow CF:non-CF comparisons without secondary confounds.",

We chemically linked biotin to S. aureus, bound streptavidin to gold grids, and combined them to attach S. aureus to grids. We chose S. aureus because we frequently isolate it from porcine CF lungs, and it is the most common organism isolated from young children with CF (9,10). A fluorescent live/dead stain revealed the state of bacteria. Exposing grids to ethanol killed most S. aureus. Importantly, placing grids on the porcine tracheal surface in vivo also killed bacteria.",

We investigated antimicrobials by measuring mRNA, protein, and aggregate activity under optimal conditions and found that non-CF and CF ASL had similar amounts of antimicrobials.

            "text": "Thus, these factors do not explain defective bacterial killing in CF. We also measured ASL pH and found that it was more acidic in CF, and reducing pH inhibited the antimicrobial activity of ASL. In addition, elevating airway CO 2 reduced ASL pH and inhibited bacterial killing in non-CF pigs, and, conversely, in CF pigs, aerosolizing NaHCO 3 into the trachea increased ASL pH and enhanced killing (as compared to aerosolizing NaCl). These results directly link the initial host defense defect to loss of CFTR, an anion channel that facilitates HCO 3 transport (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . Without CFTR, airway epithelial HCO 3 secretion is defective, ASL pH falls and inhibits antimicrobial function, and thereby impairs killing of bacteria that enter the newborn lung. These results suggest that correcting ASL pH might prevent the initial infection in patients with CF. That might be accomplished by delivering HCO 3 into airways, altering pH regulation by airway epithelia, enhancing activity of ASL antimicrobials, delivering pH-insensitive antimicrobials, or targeting mutant CFTR. These results also suggest that measuring ASL pH or adapting the bacteria-coated grid method to assay bacterial killing in patients could be useful for assessing potential therapies. Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterised by chronic bacterial infections, neutrophil dominated airway inflammation, progressive airway obstruction and bronchiectasis. Patients with CF or other underlying chronic lung diseases (e.g., COPD, asthma) are considered \"high-risk\" for developing more severe respiratory viral infections. More rapid deterioration of pulmonary function in CF patients has been associated with respiratory viral infections (1) and respiratory virus infection has been shown to result in more severe and prolonged disease in CF infants compared to infection of non-CF infants (2) . Although the frequency of respiratory viral infections involving CF infants is similar to non-CF infants, virus infections were more likely to result in lower respiratory tract infection, impaired pulmonary function, and hospitalization of CF infants (3) . Rhinoviruses (RV) and the paramyxoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza viruses (PIV) are the most commonly isolated respiratory viruses in the human infant population.",

This will ensure study completion while funding is still available Choosing appropriate outcome measures is a crucial step for the success of investigator-initiated trials. Outcome measures can be divided into clinically meaningful and surrogate endpoints. The Food and Drug Administration defines clinically meaningful endpoints as those that measure directly how a patient feels, functions or survives. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint (or marker) is a measure of effect of a certain treatment that may correlate with a real clinical endpoint but does not necessarily have a guaranteed relationship and acts as a substitute for a clinically meaningful endpoint. Most of the endpoints used in CF clinical studies fall into the latter category. Few outcome measures have been validated and are accepted by regulatory authorities; these include lung function measures, namely FEV1 as well as pulmonary exacerbations requiring treatment with antibiotics. FEV1 is often used as a primary outcome measure, but many patients now have FEV1 values within the normal range which limits patients' eligibility to trials. Flows at lower lung volumes such as MEF2575%VC are more sensitive for small airway disease, but also more variable. Measures of ventilation inhomogeneity such as LCI are both sensitive and less variable and are currently explored as outcome measures for clinical trials, but their ability to predict long term lung function decline and mortality still needs to be defined.",

Most phase III studies have used pulmonary exacerbations requiring intravenous antibiotics as an outcome measure as these have been linked to lung function decline and usually require hospitalization. With overall better clinical status of the CF patient population, these more severe pulmonary exacerbations become less frequent events and therefore a large sample size is required to show a significant difference in a clinical trial. The long term impact of milder exacerbations is less clear and needs to be further explored to identify the validity of these exacerbations as outcome measures in clinical studies.",

Investigator-initiated trials are also often proof of concept studies rather than pivotal phase III studies. Outcome measures for proof of concept trials can vary based on the therapeutic target (CFTR function versus infection versus inflammation); the range of potential outcome measures is therefore rather broad. However, a priori sample size calculations are often challenging as the information for the biological variability of many of these parameters is often rather limited. In addition, there is not necessarily a strong link between surrogate measures providing biological plausibility and established outcome measures for phase III studies. For example, changes in measures of CFTR function will not necessarily correlate tightly with lung function changes as the threshold for response as well as the reversibility of functional impairment will vary between tissues. Assessing the long term variability of outcome measures as well as their changes during clinically significant events such as pulmonary exacerbations can provide important information on their utility in clinical trials.",

The CF Foundation continues to support investigator initiated trials with vigor through financial grant support as well as supporting the infrastructure of the CF-TDN Coordinating Center and Site Network. Investigator initiated trials are also funded through federal agencies (NIH, FDA) and pharmaceutical industry sponsors.

During fellowship, an adult CF patient with chronic respiratory tract Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) presented with increased symptoms after receiving a course of IV antibiotics directed against P. aeruginosa. Since respiratory infection is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in CF (1), it was important to know if MRSA could be contributing to this patient's symptoms. A review of the literature suggested that methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) may be associated with a milder disease course in CF patients as MSSA is associated with increased survival in a 5-year survivorship model of CF (2) . While MSSA may be associated with better outcomes, there was not a lot of data on the impact, much less treatment, of MRSA in CF at that time. There is concern about MRSA being more virulent than MSSA because of differences in virulence factors and MRSA being associated with lung abscesses in CF patients (3, 4) . Since that day in clinic, the CF community has had increasing concerns about MRSA as the prevalence has continued to increase dramatically and is now detected in 25% of all CF patients (5) . Adding to the concern about MRSA in CF, Dasenbrook and colleagues have published cohort studies using the CF Foundation Patient Registry to show an association between MRSA infection in CF and more rapid lung function decline and worse survival (6, 7) . Furthermore, a recent study by Sanders and colleagues of 8,500 CF exacerbations reported MRSA was a significant risk factor for failure to recover lung function (8) . These studies support the conclusion that MRSA may be a modifiable risk factor for worse outcomes in patients with CF. Therefore, the next step is to determine if treatment of respiratory tract MRSA will improve patient outcomes.",

Similarly, patients infected with the same Burkholderia dolosa strain had greater decline in lung function and increased risk of dying [6] . Most recently, patients attending the same CF clinic were found to be infected with the same strain of Mycobacterium abscessus subspecies massiliense [7] . Furthermore, Dasenbrook et al. have shown using CFF registry data that chronic infection with methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was associated with greater decline in lung function and increased mortality [8, 9] . Finally, Stone et al. demonstrated that MRSA strains were shared between CF patients and their family members [10] .",

Intuitively, it would seem that a greater frequency of surveillance cultures would afford a greater probability to detect potentially transmissible species, thereby providing more opportunity to intervene with appropriate infection control. However, this granularity of information needs to be balanced against feasibility and carefully considered cost-benefit analyses that are generally unavailable.

Several shared -or so-called \"epidemic\" -strains of P. aeruginosa and B. cepacia complex have been described, and infection with some of these strains has been associated with a greater risk of poor clinical outcome (1). A great number of studies have documented inter-patient transmission of such strains within CF centers, and have served as the basis of implementing infection control measures that have effectively halted further transmission. Since publication of the 2003 Infection Control Guidelines for CF (2) , genotyping studies have enhanced our understanding of the epidemiology and clinical impact of B. cepacia (3) and P. aeruginosa (4, 5) and have also been used to demonstrate that strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) may be shared between CF patients and their family members (6) and that patients attending the same CF clinic may be infected with the same strain of Mycobacterium abscessus (7) . While there is little doubt, based on observations such as these, of the value of genotyping in infection control, there is little evidence-based data upon which recommendations can be made about the optimal frequency of genotyping or the signals that might indicate a specific need for genotyping. Nevertheless, given the success that genotyping has had in identifying spread of specific bacterial strains and guiding effective local infection control measures, it seems appropriate that active genotypic surveillance should be considered an important part of infection control in CF.",

In 1999-2000, B. cenocepacia isolates recovered from soil samples from New York state agricultural fields that had been planted with onions for several years were indistinguishable from the B. cenocepacia strain that was shared by many patients with CF in the mid-Atlantic region (1). Subsequently, these strains were also found in other cities in the US and Europe and were indistinguishable from isolates from patients with CF (2). Burkholderia spp have also been found in rice, wheat and maize rhizospheres, industrial settings, and human sewage. Of note, the species of Burkholderia found most frequently in the natural environment are found infrequently in CF patients. In contrast, B. multivorans is isolated frequently from CF patients, but only rarely from the environment. P. aeruginosa is widely distributed in the natural environment, mostly in aquatic habitats.

Although P. aeruginosa was isolated in 19% of surface samples of showers after hospitalized colonized patients had washed, environmental strains were different from clinical strains and no P. aeruginosa was detected before washing (4). In one study of a CF center with a high patient colonization rate with the more virulent Liverpool strain, patient clothes, bed linens, and external surfaces of the patients' personal respiratory therapy equipment were infrequently and transiently colonized (5) . Another study of bacterial surface contamination in 7 different CF clinics found that respiratory tract pathogens were recovered from only 1% of inanimate surfaces in the area of patients known to be colonized with those pathogens, most often from receptionists' counters, bathroom faucets and waiting room chairs; pulse oximeters and stethoscopes were rarely contaminated (6) . In contrast, one study from 2001-2005 recovered P. aeruginosa from 23% of samples from inanimate surfaces, mostly from sinks and drains. Twenty percent of the environmental isolates were genotyped and compared with clinical isolates: 19 of the 21 environmental strains were found to be genetically related to the clinical strains. In this study, it was estimated that each patient who was not colonized with P. aeruginosa had a 5.4% risk of coming into contact with a surface colonized with P. aeruginosa at each clinic visit (7) . Although an early study of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in patients with CF suggested the potential for acquisition from inanimate surfaces in contact with water, a more recent study demonstrated that isolates associated with persistent colonization of water, traps, and sinks were different from clinical isolates (8) . The variations in these study results may, in part, reflect variations in cleaning and disinfection practices in CF centers. In conclusion, studies to date support the recommendations for surface cleaning and disinfection, but indicate that inanimate environmental contamination is a less frequent source of new acquisition of pathogens.",

Several studies have recovered CF pathogens from nebulizers and contamination of nebulizers was associated with transmission and therefore, cleaning, disinfecting, rinsing and air drying after each use was recommended in the 2003 guideline for home and in hospitals. Studies of nebulizer care published since the 2003 have found: a) frequent failure to follow recommended practices; b) contamination with CF pathogens when recommended practices are not followed; c) failure of vinegar (acetic acid) to remove S. aureus and E. coli; d) no advantage of hypochlorite based solutions; e) failure to find microbial contamination of the cup of disposable nebulizers after 24 hours; therefore, consideration may be given to disposal of a nebulizer after 24 hours of use when in hospital (10) .

In some circumstances, changes in respiratory flora may limit options for lung transplantation. Due to the weighty importance of lung function in CF, the issue of infection control is emotionally charged for patients and their families, often provoking fears, protests and a strong desire to negotiate with providers. Clear evidence for inpatient infection control has grown in the past few decades. However, less is known about the risk of cross-contamination in the outpatient setting where residency is relatively brief but where patient traffic is often heavy.",

The effectiveness of surgical masks to protect healthcare workers (5), college students (6), and family contacts (7) from seasonal influenza and other respiratory viruses has been studied, but adherence to mask use is problematic (8) .

Recovery of pathogens from the air has been demonstrated at different rates depending in part upon experimental conditions. One study of adult CF patients harboring BS showed that air samples (obtained within about 1 meter from the patients) were positive before, during and after chest physiotherapy, respectively (11) . BS was detected in air samples obtained 15 to 45 minutes after the patients left the room, but samples obtained at 60 minutes were negative. Based on this study and others, CF patients have been routinely advised to remain at arm's distance from each other (the \"3 foot rule\"). Accumulating evidence now challenges the safety of this rule. Recent CDC guidelines state that infectious droplets may project at least 6 feet, farther than previously thought to occur (4) . Data supporting this revision are largely derived from observations of the transmission of viral pathogens and thus, their applicability to CF is uncertain. One recent study in CF patients showed that droplets contaminated with PA sometimes project more than 1 meter from subjects during talking or coughing under experimental conditions (12) . An intriguing study by Wainwright et al. measured the size of potentially infectious droplets generated during forced coughing in CF volunteers. A large proportion of the expectorated infectious droplets were within the respirable range under test conditions (14) . Based largely on epidemiologic observations of viral pathogens, Roy and Milton proposed a schema that modifies the classic categories of transmission to include obligate (only airborne transmission), preferential (can be transmitted by other means such as droplet), and opportunistic transmission (under some circumstances airborne transmission occurs) (13) . It should be emphasized that the relevance of these concepts to infection control in CF remains uncertain.",

Eligible subjects were attending clinic for routine or sick visits and were infected with PA, SA, SM and/or BS. For this study, spirometry was performed in a separate room from the remainder of the encounter (during which time subjects were randomized to wearing or not wearing a surgical mask). Air samples were collected with a single stage impactor (Andersen 1-STG) that drew ambient air onto a blood agar plate. The impactor was positioned >6 ft from the subject and air was collected for 10 min per sample. The following samples were obtained for each subject: during spirometry, 30 min after spirometry, and in the exam room. Plates were processed at a core laboratory using selective media, and bacterial isolates were characterized. The proportion of subjects with the same species isolated from > 1 air sample(s) and historic and/or current respiratory tract specimens was determined. The air exchange rate in each room was measured by the carbon dioxide decay technique. The rate of bacterial air contamination with CF respiratory pathogens was similar to that detected in our previous study. Air contamination was much more frequent during performance of spirometry than during other elements of office encounters and appeared to clear by 30 min after performance of testing. Additional discussion during this session will explore possible associations between rates of air contamination and patient mask use, carriage of specific respiratory pathogens, patient clinical status, cough frequency and exam room ventilation.

The presence of a \"critical mass\" of pancreatic acinar tissue is necessary for symptomatic pancreatitis to occur. However, not all PS CF patients develop pancreatitis, suggesting variability in disease development due to variations in CFTR dysfunction or presence of modifier effects or both. To evaluate the former, a novel classification system for mutation severity, known as the Pancreatic Insufficiency Prevalence (PIP) score, was recently developed and validated [20] . The PIP score for a specific mutation is calculated based on the ratio between PI patients carrying the mutation and all PI and PS patients carrying the same mutation in a homozygous state or heterozygous in a combination with mutations known to have severe consequences, such as F508del or most Class I mutations. The PIP scoring system permitted a more refined classification of the functional severity of CFTR mutations (than can be provided by the conventional 5 class system) and in a far greater number of patients than previous method(s) of classification. Furthermore, this scoring system could be applied to other genotype-phenotype studies. Categorically, mutations can be classified as either mild (\u22640.25) or severe (>0.25) on the basis of the PIP score.",

In addition, patients carrying mild genotypes had a significantly higher cumulative proportion and 71% increase in risk of developing pancreatitis at any given time (hazard ratio = 2.4) than those with moderate-severe genotypes. Furthermore, the presence of mild mutations on both alleles conferred a significantly higher cumulative proportion and greater risk of pancreatitis than those with mild/severe and severe/severe allele combinations. In fact, there appeared to be a gradation of risk of developing pancreatitis according to genotype severity. At any given time, patients carrying mild mutations on both alleles (mild/mild) had the greatest risk of pancreatitis (hazard ratio = 4.2) which is followed by patients carrying one mild (mild/severe; hazard ratio = 1.9), when compared with those who carried severe mutations on both alleles. Other phenotypic differences between PS CF patients with and without pancreatitis supported the contention that, as a group, those at risk of pancreatitis carried milder mutations. Patients with pancreatitis were diagnosed with CF at a significantly older age than those without pancreatitis (median (IQR) ages at diagnosis of 14.9 (9.5-27.7) vs. 9.3 (1.5-21.4); P=0.003).

To this end, there is much research focused on correcting this underlying defect in CF by either replacing part or all of the gene with exogenous CFTR through gene therapy or correcting the CF patient's endogenous abnormal CFTR with pharmacological compounds [1, 2] . As CFTR correction therapies become possible, there are still many questions that need to be answered. Can spe-cific CF manifestations be ameliorated or even avoided by CFTR correction? When is the optimal timing for correction? Where does CFTR need to be corrected to avoid specific CF manifestations? How much correction is necessary to avoid or improve CF manifestations? How can the utility of new CFTR corrector compounds be assessed as they are identified? To answer these questions, the CF research community needs in vivo models of CFTR correction. In this talk, several CF mouse models will be presented that may serve this function and answer these questions which will help set expectations and goals for future human therapies involving CFTR correction.",

For each clinical CF trait, one must determine if it is reversible upon CFTR correction, if decline can be halted, or slowed, or if the chain of events resulting from CFTR's absence are irreversible. These are important concepts, as currently we only have unaffected to compare with, and reverting a CF patient or mouse to a totally unaffected state is unlikely to be a realistic benchmark. In addition, understanding optimal time points for correcting each CF phenotype will be critical. For example, early postnatal intervention may be effective at preventing pulmonary disease in patients, but is unlikely to have much effect on exocrine pancreatic function, as most of that damage is done by birth. To investigate these questions about CFTR correction, we recently created an inducible model of CFTR correction in the mouse, in which the endogenous CFTR gene is nonfunctional but can be chemically induced to be functional leaving CFTR under its endogenous transcriptional control [3] . This CFTR correction can be completed at specific developmental timepoints throughout the whole mouse. We initially restored CFTR in adult CF mice to prove correction was possible using this model. When we restored CFTR in adult CF mice, we observed significant CFTR correction in all tissues examined displaying robust CFTR expression and/or function. However, since many CF phenotypes manifest very early in life we corrected CFTR in utero halfway through gestation. When we restored CFTR in CF fetuses we observed near normal weight gain, 100% survival to adulthood (compared to 40% without correction) and clear CFTR correction in all tissues tested. The effects of postnatal and juvenile correction are also being investigated.",

The correction of CFTR using our mouse model can also be restricted to specific tissues or cell types and thus we can ask the question of where is CFTR correction necessary to alleviate or avoid specific CF phenotypes. As an example, we used our mouse model to correct CFTR specifically in the intestinal epithelium. While restoration of CFTR in the intestinal epithelium eliminated the intestinal obstruction phenotype, the mice still displayed reduced growth [3] . These results suggest that CFTR correction in the intestinal epithelium is necessary for avoiding CF related intestinal obstruction but other sites of CFTR correction are necessary to correct growth reduction in CF. Since CFTR is widely expressed throughout the body, we can now begin to target where CFTR correction is necessary to improve or avoid manifestations.",

The identification of the minimal requirement of CFTR correction (i.e., percentage of cells with corrected CFTR) is necessary given that proposed treatments for CFTR cor-rection are unlikely to target 100% of cells. One study using CF airway epithelial cell cultures suggested that correction of CFTR in 6-10% of cells may be adequate to restore chloride transport [4] . A more recent in vitro study that utilized differentiated airway epithelial cultures observed that correction of CFTR in 25% of surface epithelial cells restored normal mucus transport rates and airway surface liquid volume, both factors in CF pulmonary disease [5] . The in vivo phenotypic consequence of the amount of CFTR correction in both of these studies is unknown, however both studies suggested that their results be verified if appropriate animal models existed. Until now, a controllable and titratable in vivo correction of CFTR did not exist. Since our inducible CFTR correction model uses a chemical that can be titrated, we are finally assessing how much CFTR correction is necessary to achieve normal CFTR function and what this means for CF manifestations. This aspect of CFTR correction may be very important if future therapeutic CFTR correctors can only achieve a small amount of CFTR correction.",

While the inducible mouse model of CFTR correction informs us about where, when and possibly how much CFTR correction is necessary, another critical question for the types of therapeutics currently under development is whether murine CFTR is an appropriate target on which to test them. Small molecule approaches to correct folding or increase activity may be quite sensitive to subtle structural differences between the two species, and stop codon suppression sensitive to sequence variation. Thus, we are generating mice carrying a genomic copy of human CFTR, and several of its common mutations, for testing these compounds. The feasibility of this approach has been established by others. Using a transgenic strategy, human CFTR cDNA has been shown to complement the loss of murine CFTR [6] and mice carrying a YAC (yeast artificial chromosome) containing human CFTR display complete complementation of CFTR deficiency [7] demonstrating species-conserved gene regulation. In addition, a BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) containing the human genomic CFTR locus has been developed and shown to express faithfully in murine cells as well [8] . We are currently using this BAC to introduce human genomic CFTR into mouse embryos to establish a human CFTR expressing mouse line. Once generated, the transgenic line with \"wildtype\" CFTR will be crossed onto a CFTR-null background and assessed for complementation of murine CFTR deficiency. Ultimately, the mutant versions of this mouse carrying \u2206F508, G551D and G542X of human CFTR will be made for the purposes of testing correctors for improving CFTR folding, activation or stop codon suppression, respectively.",

CF is an autosomal recessive disease leading to multisystem disease with significant morbidity and early death. Severe pulmonary disease is the primary cause of mortality in almost 80% of CF-related early deaths. Lung transplantation is commonly performed for patients with end-stage lung disease from CF with good outcomes and survival benefits. It is the most common indication for lung transplant in the pediatric population and the third most common indication in the adult population. Unfortunately, long-term survival following lung transplantation is still poor compared to that for other solid organ transplants. Within 5 years of receiving a lung transplant, nearly 50% of patients develop bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) the most important cause of morbidity and mortality beyond one year following lung transplantation. There is no effective treatment available for OB at present and one of the major reasons is the lack of an animal model that reliably produces human OB pathology.",

Currently, the leading, yet untested, hypothesis is that the destruction of exocrine tissue somehow compromises islet cell survival and/or replenishment. However, it is also possible that CFTR is required for beta cell generation, function or maintenance. We hypothesize that a reduced number of beta cells early during pancreas morphogenesis may increase the physiological burden of the remaining beta cells, in turn contributing to the development of CFRD. Our results show that loss of CFTR function leads to significant reduction in insulin-producing cells at an early stage, suggesting that CFTR plays a role in endocrine pancreas morphogenesis.

CFTR, a cAMP-regulated anion channel, is confined to the apical plasma membrane (PM) and mediates transepithelial water and electrolyte transport. CFTR belongs to the ATP-binding cassette transporter family and comprises two membrane spanning domains (MSD1, MSD2) with four cytosolic loops (CL1-4) and three cytosolic domains; a regulatory (R) and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1, NBD2). The CFTR domain swapped architecture containing multiple domain-domain interfaces is indispensible in coupling the ATP-dependent conformational changes of the NBD1-2 dimer to channel gating [1] .",

The premise of this approach is that robust correction of the folding defect should eliminate the requirement of potentiator and enhance both ER processing efficiency and the PM stability of the mutant. We hypothesized that a) the modest effect of individual corrector could be attributed to restoration of only one of the \u2206F508 CFTR structural defects. Thus second site suppressor mutation stabilizing e.g. the NBD1 may potentiate those correctors that preferentially restore the NBD1-MSD2 interface stability and vice versa. b) Combination of corrector acting on distinct CFTR structural defects similar to suppressor mutations may restore \u2206F508 CFTR folding and function synergistically. To achieve our goal, first we selected PCs and CCs that preferentially correct either the NBD1 or the NBD1-MSD2 instability in \u2206F508 CFTR. Next, we tested whether combination of correctors targeting complementary structural defects synergistically restores the \u2206F508 CFTR ER folding, PM expression and function in non-polarized and respiratory epithelial cells. The results of our ongoing experiments suggest that combination of compounds, including the CFFTI corrector panel (kindly provided by Dr. R Bridges), preferentially targeting distinct structural defects have synergistic and robust rescue of \u2206F508 CFTR folding defect in multiple model systems and primary epithelia, outlining a conceptually novel and potentially efficient therapeutic approach in CF. Support by NIH NIDDK, CFFTI, and CFC is acknowledged. Missense mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, CFTR, which prevent it from functioning as a regulated chloride channel, cause cystic fibrosis. By contrast to nonsense mutations or noncoding mutations that alter transcription or translation, alleles containing missense mutations produce fulllength mutant CFTR protein-albeit protein that fails to function due to a number of pathogenic mechanisms. Rehabilitating these mutant channels to function using a small molecule is a therapeutic approach that has been recently proven effective for the G551D mutation (1).",

A smaller number of disease-causing missense mutations form a stable, native structure, but fail to function due to alterations in either the mechanochemical gating cycle (eg. G551D), the ion conduction pathway, or other CFTR mediated activities (3). Thus, although CF is a monogenic disease, pharmacological approaches to treating CF will require distinct small molecules that target pathogenic mechanisms relevant to specific mutations. The feasibility of such an approach will depend on an ability to identify molecules that target these mechanisms and in determining which mechanisms are relevant to each disease-causing muta-tion.

            "text": "\u2206F508 offers a case in point. F508 resides in the first nucleotide binding domain of CFTR (NBD1) at a surface shown to interact with the fourth intracellular loop (ICL4) in the second transmembrane domain (TMD2). Deletion of this residue causes defective folding of NBD1 and defective interaction of the folded NBD1 with ICL4 (7, 8) . Whereas \u2206F508 accounts for approximately 70% of all CF alleles and more than 90% of all patients have at least one \u2206F508 allele, small molecules that could correct the folding defect could have therapeutic benefit for the majority of CF patients. Efforts to identify such correctors have been successful but have encountered an efficacy ceiling. This can be rationalized if the extant correctors act on one or the other defective steps but not both. In addition, compounds that act on one pathogenic step would be expected to act in synergy with compounds that act on the other. Methods have been developed to efficiently assess the impact of mutations on the NBD1 folding step and the coupled NBD1 folding-ICL4 association step (8) . These assays facilitate experiments that test if a corrector's mechanism of action is due to promotion of NBD1 folding, NBD1-ICL4 docking or neither. This mechanistic information would suggest compounds that might work in combination to overcome the efficacy ceiling. By contrast to \u2206F508, other CF-causing missense mutations may lead to CFTR folding defects by interfering with one or the other of these steps but not both. As such, compounds known to act at the relevant step would be predicted to correct these mutants without an efficacy ceiling. These, and similar analyses, could facilitate efficient integration of knowledge of the specific molecular defects of mutations with the mechanism of actions of correctors, and, thus, evidence based coordination of molecular genetics and molecular pharmacology.",

            "text": "References The major mutation (deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 -F508del-CFTR) accounts for disease in approximately 90% of cystic fibrosis patients. This mutation causes the protein to be misprocessed and retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it is subsequently degraded [1] . Low temperature conditions (27\u00b0C) enable partial rescue of the functional expression of F508del-CFTR protein on the cell surface [2] . However, upon restoration of F508del-CFTR expressing cells or tissues to normal body temperature (37\u00b0C), the mutant exhibits altered channel activity (low probability of being open) and instability with its rapid retrieval from the cell surface [3, 4] . Therefore, effective therapeutic compounds targeting this mutant will need to correct all three defects and 1) restore biosynthesis and 2) channel activity, and 3) prevent unfolding at the cell surface at normal body temperature. There has been considerable progress in identifying \"corrector\" compounds that exhibit partial efficacy in the functional expression of the major mutant on the surface of affected epithelia. However, the consequence of chemical intervention on each of the specific molecular defects discussed in the preceding paragraph remains unclear and in fact, it has been argued that even the best compounds lack efficacy in preventing the mutant protein from unfolding at the cell surface at 37\u00b0C [4] . Part of this uncertainty arises from the use of a diverse range of experimental assays on different cell types. We propose that the development of the next generation of \"corrector\" compounds would benefit from in vitro methods that can be used to predict the effect of new chemical compounds on preventing unfolding of the full length mutant CFTR protein using the purified protein itself as a discovery tool. This approach has the advantage of selecting compounds that bind directly to the CFTR protein itself to promote a stable conformation. Furthermore, our preliminary studies support the idea that there is a correlation between those small molecules that show superior efficacy in a novel in vitro assay of mutant protein stability and those compounds that show superior efficacy in promoting functional expression of F508del-CFTR in primary cultures of respiratory epithelia.",

In our previous work we employed assays of purified and reconstituted F508del-CFTR activity to determine whether small molecule corrector compounds bound directly to modify activity [5, 6] . We developed a new assay to monitor the propensity for unfolding and aggregation by the purified mutant. First, we showed that this assay reports the differential instability of the mutant protein as it exhibits a much faster rate of aggregation than the Wt protein.

The folding defects in \u2206F508-CFTR, as well as defects in other rare mutants, are correctable, but the mechanism of action for folding correctors is unknown. \u2206F508 occurs in nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD1) and blocks Clchannel assembly by hindering interactions of NBD1 with intracellular loops exposed by MSD1 and MSD2. Therefore, correction of folding defects in \u2206F508-CFTR requires assembly to a conformation to permit escape from multiple ERQC machines and may require repair of more than one folding defect. This talk we describe current knowledge about the mechanism for recognition of misfolded CFTR by ERQC machines and present information on the mechanism for folding corrector action in treatment of CF. Prospects for treatment of \u2206F508 homozygotes and compound heterozygotes with different combinations of folding correctors will be discussed. This work is supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Background: Delivery of drugs to the lungs is the mainstay of therapy for many lung diseases including cystic fibrosis (CF). Currently recommended inhalational therapies for CF patients include: antibiotics for eradication and chronic suppression of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, dornase alfa to decrease sputum viscosity, albuterol to prevent or treat bronchoconstriction, and 7% hypertonic saline to rehydrate the airway surface liquid compartment (1) . In addition to these medications, inhaled corticosteroids and long acting beta 2 agonist/inhaled corticosteroid combinations are frequently prescribed to this population. The benefit of topical inhalation therapy lies in the fact that higher in-situ drug concentrations coupled with lower systemic effects and faster onset of action are achieved while lower doses are given.",

The MMAD is defined as the diameter at which 50% of the particles by mass are larger and 50% are smaller. The GSD is a measure of the spread of the particle size distribution. The respirable fraction is the percentage of aerosol comprised in the 1 \u00b5m to 5 \u00b5m range. Particles larger than 5 \u00b5m mainly deposit in the oropharynx and upper airways, while aerosols between 1 \u00b5m to 3 \u00b5m will deposit in the peripheral airways. Particles smaller than 1 \u00b5m tend to be exhaled. Particles deposit in the airways by different mechanisms. Those particles larger than 3 \u00b5m deposit by inertial impaction. This mechanism is also responsible for deposition in upper airways and large intrathoracic airways. Aerosols travelling at a slower speed will suffer less impaction and will enhance intrapulmonary deposition. Particles between 0.5 \u00b5m to 3 \u00b5m will mainly deposit by sedimentation due to gravity. This mechanism is responsible for deposition in the smaller airways. Finally, particles smaller than 0.5 \u00b5m will deposit by diffusion. Breath holding maneuvers facilitates the latter two mechanisms. Drug delivery becomes more complex because some aerosols retain moisture (hygroscopic property) therefore increasing their particle size and potentially altering the site of deposition. Solutions are more easily aerosolized than suspensions.",

In addition to this, infants and young children may frequently cry and refuse wearing the mask, resulting in a significant decrease in lung deposition (3). Advanced lung disease will determine a more central and less homogeneous deposition compared to that of CF patients with minimal lung disease. Patients able to follow instructions and able to perform specific maneuvers could achieve a higher intrapulmonary deposition of inhaled drugs.

Many new devices and drug formulations reduce the time burden for the patient and family, and electronic devices have the capability of monitoring adherence with therapy.

The conversion from CFC to HFA propellant is almost complete, which in most cases yielded a slower, warmer plume of aerosol. HFA-solution pMDIs (e.g.. beclomethasone, ciclesonide) were designed to yield aerosols with micron-sized particles, thus avoiding upper airway impaction and improving lung deposition and distribution. Dose counters are now incorporated into many pMDIs to indicate when the inhaler is empty, and the first breath-actuated HFA pMDI was recently approved in the U.S., which improves coordination of inhalation and device actuation. Velocitymodifying pMDIs have been developed to reduce the high initial speed of the spray. The Tempo Inhaler combines slow spray velocity with breath actuation to triple the aerosol deposition of a typical pMDI with half the dose-to-dose variability. So far the Tempo has only been combined with a systemic migraine drug, but has the potential to be used for respiratory drugs also. Finally, the slow-mist, propellant-free, multi-dose Respimat inhaler was just introduced in the US for the albuterolipratropium combination, and was used in Phase 3 trials with tiotropium in CF. This device still requires coordination of inhalation and dose-firing, but the mist is very slow and much easier to capture in the inspired airstream, resulting in better lung deposition. Slow-mist inhalers and pMDIs are only capable of delivering microgram drug quantities, so are currently useful mostly for bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids, not for CF drugs.",

DPIs are small, portable, breath-actuated, require no power source other than the inspiratory effort, reduce administration time and eliminate the need for refrigeration of medication and complex cleaning rituals compared to nebulizers.

Vibrating perforated-membrane nebulizers are faster than jet nebulizers, are portable, battery operated and have unique efficiencies of operation. For example, one of the devices from the eFlow platform (Altera) was developed specifically for the nebulization of aztreonam; it has a very low residual volume and can deliver a dose in 2-3 minutes. Another eFlow device (Trio) has been available in the US for a few years, and is similar to the Altera (low dead volume, high output, 2-4 times the delivery efficiency of jet nebulizers). Another eFlow version (Rapid) has been available in the EU and just received approval in the US. The eFlow Rapid is designed to mimic the aerosol characteristics of the PARI LC PLUS jet nebulizer with the exception of a faster delivery time. Bench studies suggest that the delivery of a unit dose of medication would be similar between an LC PLUS and eFlow Rapid, but higher with the more efficient Trio nebulizer. Thus, one must be cautious about substitution of nebulizers for certain drugs that may have toxicity at higher delivered doses. Vibrating mesh devices address convenience, portability, and time burden, but they still require cleaning and disinfection. In the future these electronic devices can be modified to monitor adherence.",

As a bonus, the variability of deposition is reduced (better targeting). Two device technologies help control and slow the inspiratory flow of the patient. The I-neb device uses a vibrating horn and mesh to generate aerosol, monitors the breathing pattern of the patient and aerosolizes only during inspiration (Adaptive Aerosol Delivery, AAD). It can operate in a tidal breathing mode, but its \"targeted inhalation mode\" (TIM) utilizes a high-resistance mouthpiece and tactile indicators that coach the patient to take slow, deep inhalations. The TIM mode has the benefits of higher deposition efficiency and lower time to administer a dose. A chip in the device also can monitor patient adherence. The I-neb is currently available for the pulmonary hypertension drug iloprost, and also in the UK and a few other countries for colistimethate. The Akita is another device that allows individualized controlled inhalations in combination with either a jet nebulizer or a vibrating mesh.

Bruce Montgomery, M.D. Cardeas Pharmaceuticals, Seattle, WA, USA Regulatory guidance available in the United States and Europe give conflicting and often outdated advice in regard to clinical trial design for Phase 3 trials for inhaled antibiotics in CF. For instance, the availability of two approved drugs makes the conduct of placebocontrolled trials longer than 28 days problematic. Comparator drugs require labeled use, making comparator trials difficult to blind as taste, foaming, regimen, device and delivery time differences are present. Currently, there is no consensus on the most appropriate endpoints for evaluation of aerosolized antimicrobials. FEV1 is a surrogate endpoint that it is a predictor of mortality -it is standardized, reproducible, noninvasive, simple, and inexpensive to perform but small statistically significant changes may not be clinically important. FEV1 improvement also has a ceiling effect in patients with mild lung function impairment and spirometry cannot be reliably done in patients under the age of six years. A patient reported outcome is a promising clinical endpoint but there is not an accepted tool that can be used as a primary endpoint for the FDA or the EMA, although the latter recognizes the CFQ-R as a validated secondary endpoint and the FDA grandfathered acceptance of the CFQ-R respiratory domain in the pivotal aztreonam for inhalation study. Exacerbations are an important clinical endpoint that reflects morbidity and is a major driver of cost of care, but exacerbations occur infrequently and a standardized definition has not been reached. Furthermore, an exacerbation endpoint may fail even with an otherwise effective antibiotic. Regulatory authorities will have a difficult time approving any new inhaled antibiotic based on one clinical endpoint alone.",

Increased knowledge of the bacterial infection routes may provide new therapeutic strategies by disclosing new targets for interference, and specific bacterial adaptive mutations may be useful as genetic markers for chronic states of infections.

In contrast to other fluorescent pseudomonads P. aeruginosa is able to grow at high temperatures (up to 42\u00b0C) and has its maximum at 37\u00b0C. In addition, its genome encodes a number of virulence factors making it a model example of an opportunistic pathogen. The genome of P. aeruginosa encodes around 6000 genes, of which about 600 have been estimated to exert regulatory functions (1) . It is assumed that this very large regulatory repertoire plays a role during the early stages of infection in CF airways, when switching from an environmental to a host colonization life-style. Prolonged colonization and a switch to de facto chronic infection, however, seems to require genetic adaptation through mutations, which fix the life-style changes of the bacteria. One example of this is associated with the biofilm state of growth of P. aeruginosa, which is connected to the overproduction of alginate (mucoidy). CF patients chronically infected with P. aeruginosa most often display mucoid colonies in their lung expectorates, and in nearly all cases the genetic background for this phenotype includes mutations in the mucA gene encoding an anti-sigma factor, which interferes with one of the main stress regulators AlgU (2) . Thus mutations in mucA can be considered examples of genetic markers, which may be indicative of shifts towards chronic infection.",

One of these has involved accumulation of mutations in the genome with a low rate -0.7 x 10 -10 base substitutions per base pair per generation -and most of these are not adaptive but the results of genetic drift. However, a small number of early mutations in global regulatory genes seem to be highly important for the coloization success of this clone (3), and we are currently investigating the combined impacts of these mutations on the overall bacterial phenotype. The common evolutionary profile of the lineage based on analysis of a large number of patients is one of relative phenotypic and genetic homogeneity across the patients, suggesting that the early adaptive regulatory mutations found in all isolates from all infected patients resulted in optimal fitness followed by random neutral mutations with no significant phenotypic consequences.",

If consistent among several patients, bacterial functions found in severely diseased lung regions may serve as targets for future therapies.

We observed that some of our isolates possessed O antigen, while others did not (i.e., had a rough LPS). Remarkably, a single nucleotide in the glycosyltransferase gene BDAG_02317 correlated exactly with the presence of O antigen repeats. The ancestral genotype encodes a stop codon at this locus, corresponding to the absence of O-antigen repeats. We confirmed this association by showing that complementation with the full-length BDAG_02317 glycosyltransferase gene could restore O antigen presentation in an LPS rough strain. We also found that the last common ancestor of strains from nearly every patient possessed the truncated genotype and that a gain-of-function mutation occurred independently in 9 subjects. These results suggest that a rough LPS may provide an advantage during patient-to-patient transmission during outbreaks among CF patients and illuminate potential new avenues for the development of therapies that might disrupt the transmission of CF bacterial pathogens (4) Progress in understanding exacerbations has been hindered by several factors. First, tractable animal models that replicate chronic bacterial lung infections and disease flares do not yet exist. In their absence, the only way to learn about flare mechanisms is directly from patients and patient-derived samples. Second, primary mechanisms that mediate exacerbations likely produce secondary bacterial and host responses that can confound etiologic understanding.

To understand how composition shifts affect PA population functioning, we compared the proteomes of randomlyselected isolates from subpopulations that were dominant when the patient was \"well,\" dominant at onset of exacerbation (\"sick\"), and dominant after the patient was on antibiotics (\"treatment\"). Isolates (12 from each) were independently cultured and then pooled, lysed, and digested with trypsin. Equal aliquots of proteome samples were analyzed in triplicate using reversed-phase capillary liquid chromatography and data-dependent MS/MS using a Velos-FT high performance mass spectrometer. Data were analyzed using MaxQuant (2) with the PA proteome database. A total of 5928 peptides corresponding to 1159 proteins were identified, and 497 proteins showed statisticallyrelevant abundance changes (ANOVA) in the exacerbation or antibiotic treatment isolates relative to those from the well period. These data demonstrate for the first time that P. aeruginosa subclasses dominant during different stages of infection vary greatly at the proteome level. These data also illustrate excellent reproducibility among all technical replicates which is important for such label free quantitation schemes. Also illustrated are the levels of several proteins previously shown to affect aminoglycoside efficacy (3). Excitingly, these proteomics data show that the proteins amgR, amgS, mexY and several others increase in isolates dominant at the onset of exacerbation, suggesting that the PA population in patient airways could exhibit decreased sensitivity to aminoglycosides at exacerbation onset. More importantly, these results illustrate that the proteome of dominant isolates col-lected during different stages of infection can be used to evaluate conditions experienced by the bacteria. This approach can allow new bacterial proteins to be identified that could help better identify the onset of exacerbation conditions, help better understand the mechanisms involved in exacerbation and possibly serve as new therapeutic targets for treatment to further decrease loss of CF patient lung function during exacerbation.",

At baseline, healthy controls and CF with NGT had normal redox values for Cys/CySS (range (Eh Cys/CySS [x\u00b1SEM] = -86\u00b12.34 mV and -80\u00b14.17 mV respectively) but CF prediabetes and CFRD showed significant redox imbalance to the oxidized state (Eh Cys/CySS = -73\u00b13.62 mV and -71\u00b14.36 mV respectively, p<0.05, note that less negative = more oxidizing). The magnitude of this imbalance was not trivial as with normal aging, there is a 1 mV increase in oxidation for every 5 years of life. Thus this difference translates to these young adults with CF prediabetes and CFRD having the redox potential of an octogenarian. Two hours after the OGTT, CF with NGT, CF with IGT, and CFRD all demonstrated significant worsening of redox imbalance to the oxidizing state resulting in profound levels of systemic oxidation to a similar degree in all three groups that was significantly different from controls (2 hr Eh Cys/CySS: Control = -84\u00b12.59, CF-NGT= -63\u00b14.67, CF prediabetes = -60\u00b14.22, CFRD= -63\u00b12.45, p<0.05). This occurred even in the absence of any detectable hyperglycemia and when there was hyperglycemia, there was no correlation between the degree of hyperglycemia and the degree of redox imbalance.

Therefore, we have conducted experiments to determine how the CFRD environment of redox imbalance to the oxidizing state and hyperglycemia might enhance neutrophil toxicity and found the following. First, we found that both glutathione and Cys extracellular redox states regulate neutrophil-derived extracellular ROS, with more oxidizing environments resulting in increased ROS production by these normal neutrophils. Additionally, neutrophils maintained in oxidizing conditions with high glucose concentrations had an increase in ROS generation over 8-fold of that seen in neutrophils maintained in oxidizing conditions with normal glucose levels. Interestingly, in the presence of reducing conditions, the increase in ROS generation induced by a high glucose environment was completely ablated, suggesting that the extracellular redox state is a very important regulator of hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress. Our second series of experiments provide compelling evidence for a previously unrecognized metabolic defect in CF. Through a combinatorial approach of genome wide expression profiling, proteomics, and metabolomics using primary human airway epithelial cells and isolated human blood neutrophils, we found that CF neutrophils and CF airway epithelial cells have an intrinsic metabolic defect in glucose metabolism characterized by a switch to the glycolytic pathway. The implication of this phenomenon for CF neutrophils is a more primed phenotype, as neutrophils mainly depend on glycolysis for energy following activation (4, 5) . The increased glucose levels and redox imbalance to the oxidizing state found in the blood in CFRD are expected to enhance neutrophil priming and are expected to exacerbate responses once neutrophils are activated in the lung. Furthermore, normal adherent human neutrophils switch to glycolysis and generate ROS in the presence of hyperglycemia in a receptor-independent manner. This switch is temporary, lasting only a few hours before glucose is shunted away from the glycolytic pathway and ROS production diminishes. Given the increased expression of several enzymes of the glycolytic pathway in CF neutrophils, this regulatory step may be defective, resulting in prolonged, unabated production of ROS by CF neutrophils when in a hyperglycemic environment. This mechanism may be important not only in CF blood, but also in the CF airway wherein glucose and oxidized byproducts (e.g., advanced glycation endproducts) reach very high levels, thus potentiating neutrophil toxicity.",

In 2008, Dr. Ziady identified that airway epithelial cells had defective regulation of Nrf2, a transcription factor that drives the expression of a host of genes that protect against oxidant stress and that regulate redox balance (6) . More recently, he and his colleagues (7) have begun to uncover the mechanism of Nrf2 dysfunction and found that cAMP-mediated signaling markedly reduces Nrf2 activity in CF cells. Inhibition of cAMP restored Nrf2 activity AND decreased NF-kB activation. The mechanism of this was via the CREB binding protein, CBP, as Nrf2 and NF-kB competed for CBP and that an inhibitor of cAMP shifted CBP from NF-kB to Nrf2. Since altered cAMP-mediated signaling is a response to loss of CFTR function, this provides a mechanism linking mutant CFTR to decreased Nrf2 and increased NF-kB.",

CFRD is associated with worsening clinical status including reduced pulmonary function and increased mortality compared to CF patients without diabetes. While the pathophysiology of CFRD is multifactorial, delayed insulin secretion appears to be a key hallmark of disease progression. Partial insulin deficiency occurs in part due to islet loss associated with exocrine pancreas disease. However, CF pancreata at CFRD autopsy demonstrate that remaining islets contain roughly half the number of insulin-positive cells found in non-CF controls and this degree of \u03b2-cell loss is thought to be insufficient to explain diabetes. Thus, insulin deficiency in CFRD is relative and not absolute. Multiple non-pancreatic organ abnormalities, including those in the lung, liver, and intestine, may modify glucose disturbances and insulin action in CF patients. For example, hepatic insulin resistance and/or enhanced peripheral insulin sensitivity has been observed in CF patients. Furthermore, chronic lung disease in CF is thought to contribute to abnormal glucose regulation and insulin resistance by increasing metabolic demand.",

The recent development of CFTR knockout models in the pig and ferret provides new avenues for investigating the pathogenesis of CFRD. Both CF pigs and ferrets develop intestinal, hepatic, pancreatic, and lung disease that is pathologically similar to various stages of disease in CF patients; however, the progression of pancreatic disease in the two models is very different. CF pigs are born with significant exocrine pancreatic destruction, inflammation, and fibrosis characteristic of later phase damage in CF patients, whereas CF ferrets have mild pancreatic histopathology at birth.

Structurally, the newborn CF and non-CF endocrine pancreas was indistinguishable in terms of size and percent insulin and glucagon expressing cells in islets. However, there was an alteration in the distribution of large and small islets between genotypes and enhanced apoptosis in acinar and duct cells of CF animals at birth. Using L-arginine and glucose stimulation tests, our studies demonstrate that fasted newborn CF ferrets have impaired first phase insulin secretion (IFPI). Glucose tolerance tests (GTT) in fasted newborns also demonstrated that newborn CF kits have abnormal glucose tolerance. As expected with IFPI, delayed insulin responses following glucose stimulation to CF kits were accentuated at intermediate time points where hyperglycemia was observed during GTTs. However, the magnitude of insulin overshoot (~6 to 10-fold) at intermediate times points following glucose challenge was far greater for CF kits than that observed in CFRD adults and children with abnormal glucose metabolism. One explanation for the high insulin levels would be systemic insulin resistance often observed in older CF patients, however, no evidence to support systemic insulin resistance in CF newborn kits was found-plasma cortisol levels were normal and insulin/AKT signaling in liver, muscle, and adipose tissue was also not different from non-CF controls.",

Indeed this was partly the case, plasma insulin, C-peptide, insulin/glucose, and C-peptide/glucose values were highly variable and on average much higher in non-fasted CF kits compared to non-CF controls. Importantly, the molar ratio of plasma C-peptide/insulin was not significantly different between CF and non-CF animals, indicating that the elevated insulin levels in CF kits represents bona fide insulin hypersecretion and that insulin clearance rates were not significantly reduced in CF kits. These tendencies observed in CF kits towards insulin oversecretion might play a role in the hypoglycemia that is observed in humans with CF. Under non-fasted conditions, a relationship between glucose and insulin levels is expected. Indeed, in non-CF non-fasted newborns, glucose and insulin levels were positively correlated such that lower glucoses predicted lower insulin levels. By contrast, in CF non-fasted newborns, insulin did not vary with glucose, such that high insulin levels were observed even when glucose was low. These findings support the notion that insulin secretion by the newborn CF ferret pancreas is not properly regulated in a manner that extends beyond IFPI.",

At low glucose, in vitro cultured CF islets secrete 5.2-fold more of their insulin content relative to non-CF controls. This hypersecretion of insulin by CF islets at low glucose was blocked by activation of K-ATP channels with 100 \u00b5M diazoxide. Following stimulation with high glucose, non-CF islets demonstrated a significant induction in percent insulin secretion (5.1-fold), while the percent insulin secretion for CF islets was not significantly different at low and high glucose.

By 21 days of age, dilated pancreatic acini were lined by cuboidal epithelial cells lacking zymogen granules. The lumen diameter of the acinoductular units was significantly larger in CF pancreata in all age groups compared to non-CF, with a marked increase between postnatal day 9-32 compared to pancreata from younger CF kits. By 21 days, there was loss of lobular parenchyma and replacement by bands of fibrous tissue that separated remnant dilated acinoductular units. No significant differences in inflammation were noted between genotypes of newborn or early neonatal pancreata. However, inflammatory cell infiltration into the interstitium and peripancreatic adipose tissue was significantly higher in CF as compared to non-CF pancreata by 9-32 days and was characterized by the infiltration of neutrophils with fewer lymphocytes and macrophages. Interestingly, progressive destruction and inflammation of the exocrine pancreas in 1-2 month old CF ferrets was associated with the appearance of spontaneous hyperglycemia and glycosuria. Abnormalities in glucose handling with age were evaluated by mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) in CF and non-CF animals ranging from 45 to 90 days of age. Results from these studies demonstrated a variety of abnormal glucose tolerance phenotypes in CF animals consistent with impaired glucose tolerance and indeterminate glycemia, as defined using human clinical criteria. Despite these observed differences in MMTT profiles of CF animals, the average glucose profile for CF animals was significantly different from non-CF animals at all time points in the glucose curve. Additionally, AUC 0-120min was also significantly (P<0.0001) higher for CF (37,281 +/-4520 mg/dL\u2022min) as compared to non-CF (15,293 +/-1005 mg/dL\u2022min) animals. These older CF ferrets demonstrated a 52% loss of insulin positive cells, which is very similar to the~50% loss in \u03b2-cells seen at autopsy in CF patients including those with overt diabetes and glucose intolerance.

Ren, M.D. Pediatrics/Pulmonology, Univ. of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA Newborn screening (NBS) for cystic fibrosis (CF) is now available in the entire United States, as well as many other countries across the world. CF NBS algorithms vary amongst different states and countries, but in all cases a positive NBS ultimately leads to diagnostic testing for CF through measurement of sweat chloride [1] . In some cases sweat Clresults are outside the normal range (>29 mmol/L) but below the diagnostic threshold level for CF (<60 mmol/L), leading to an indeterminate result. Infants with indeterminate CF NBS results present a diagnostic challenge to clinicians and a psychological and emotional stress to families. Parad, et al were one of the first groups to describe what they termed \"diagnostic dilemmas\" [2] . Subsequently, the U.S. CF Foundation convened a panel of experts who proposed the term CFTR-related metabolic syndrome (CRMS) to describe infants who have elevated IRT detected by CF NBS, but initial genetic or sweat Clresults that are nondiagnostic of CF [3] . Guidelines for the definition and follow up of infants with CRMS have been published, but little is known about how the diagnosis of CRMS is being applied and the clinical outcomes of infants with CRMS. The CFF defines CRMS as healthy infants with hypertrypsinogenemia detected through CF NBS and either: (1) intermediate sweat chloride concentrations (between 30-59 mmol/L) on at least 2 occasions and fewer than 2 CFcausing CFTR mutations; or (2) a normal sweat chloride (<30 mmol/L) and 2 CFTR mutations, of which no more than 1 is known to be CF-causing [3] . It is important to distinguish CRMS from CFTR related disorder [1] . The former applies only to asymptomatic infants identified through CF NBS, whereas the latter occurs in older individuals with signs or symptoms of CF and a nondiagnostic sweat test. In 2010, the CFF Patient Registry began including patients with CRMS and CFTR related disorder. In 2009, there were 187 reported new diagnoses of CRMS [4] . CF centers are also asked to report the number of CRMS cases diagnosed at their center as part of the annual renewal process. In 2010, the proportion of positive NBS tests that resulted in a diagnosis of CRMS ranged from 0 to 84% [4] . This wide variation in reported prevalence raises questions about whether the diagnostic criteria for CRMS are being applied correctly.",

This is a sensitive test and will only miss a very small proportion of infants with classic CF. A second tier of testing is necessary to improve the specificity of the protocol and a variety of strategies are available, most commonly this involves DNA analysis for common mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Numerous different screening strategies (over 70) are in operation around the globe. This variance relates mainly to different cut-offs for the IRT assay and different second tier strategies. Whatever protocol is employed, there is a risk of identifying infants with an equivocal diagnosis. These infants have either an intermediate sweat chloride value (between 30-60 mmol L -1 ) with unclear genotype OR the recognition of two CFTR mutations, the molecular consequences of which are unclear and with a normal (or intermediate) sweat chloride value. Protocols with a low IRT cut-off and protocols that employ extended DNA analysis (including gene sequencing) are theoretically more at risk of recognising infants with an equivocal diagnosis. The recognition of infants with an equivocal diagnosis is also dependent on the population screened. There is a good argument that NBS programmes should consider strategies that reduce the recognition of these infants, as a significant number of them will have no longterm medical consequence from this result. Strategies that reduce the recognition of these infants may have an impact on the performance of the programme with respect to the recognition of infants with classic CF, so a balance must be achieved. Regardless of protocol, NBS will always result in the recognition of infants with an equivocal diagnosis. There has been much discussion on the term used to describe these infants. In the U.S., they are designated the term CFTR related metabolic syndrome (CRMS). There is some debate as to how these infants should be managed (7, 8) .",

The main argument for attending a CF clinic is that families will receive dedicated care and clear information. They will not become \"lost in the system.\" These are very challenging infants to manage, in some ways much more so than the infant who is homozygous for phe508del. These infants do not need to be seen as frequently as infants with classic CF, in fact following the diagnostic year, they should probably only be seen once a year. But again information for the family is the key to this. The family must be aware that if their child develops a cough that is not responding to antibiotic treatment that they need to contact the CF team and they must have a pathway to do this.

This can arise in a variety of ways depending on the newborn screening protocol used. The most common scenario is an infant with an elevated immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) and one CFTR gene mutation who has a borderline sweat chloride result, 30-59 mmol/L. Doubt about the diagnosis of CF, or exclusion of carrier status, exists because these infants have no symptoms attributable to CF, have genotype information that is incomplete (or results that are of uncertain clinical significance) and the sweat chloride test is also inconclusive. It should be remembered that newborn screening followed by sweat chloride analysis, can, in most instances, establish the diagnosis of CF, confirm carrier status to those infants identified, and exclude CF to almost all without CF. A small proportion of infants are left without a clear diagnosis, but given the widespread nature of newborn screening for CF in the United States and elsewhere, the number of these infants is not inconsequential. The implications of mislabelling these infants are huge. The consensus document that describes CRMS highlights that some physicians are reluctant to apply a medical label to symptom free infants who may never have symptoms, while others have experience with patients who have had significant symptoms develop. There can be no absolute answer as to who is right, since the development of clinical CF is a complex interaction between the infant's (unknown) CFTR function and environmental factors that cannot necessarily be controlled. In this presentation, however, I argue that it is wrong to treat these asymptomatic infants as if they have CF.",

As it stands, infants with the CFTR metabolic syndrome, by definition, have no features attributable to CF and therefore should not be labelled as having CF and should not be treated as such.

So what is the chance of the infant with the CFTR metabolic syndrome developing CF? We have no way of answering this, but do have a literature full of case reports about patients who may be the exception, and this seems to be driving the case to label all the infants with an uncertain diagnosis after newborn screening with CF. The consensus statements on the diagnosis of CF indicate that the diagnosis of CF is confirmed with evidence of CFTR dysfunction through gene mutation analysis or CFTR function as measured by sweat chloride (other tests of CFTR function such as nasal potential difference or intestinal currents are used as supplementary information in some centres). The difficulty with the genetics is that very few mutations have had functional studies to quantitate CFTR mRNA and predict outcome. CFTR sequencing may reveal sequence variations of uncertain significance, and even if a previous identified sequence has been linked to clinical disease, this is almost exclusively in patients who have presented with some CF-like phenotype, and does not predict that the infant with the same genotype will develop clinical disease. Equally, much hinges on the sweat chloride test, but even on repeating multiple times is unlikely to give the answer in the immediate term. Given the co-efficient of variation of the sweat chloride test is up to 20%, relying too heavily on cut-offs is problematic. These CFTR genetic and functional factors promote doubt as to the likelihood of developing CF, and reinforce the inappropriateness of applying a diagnostic label of CF.",

The consensus statement on management of these infants at once acknowledges the difficulty achieving consensus on recommendations and at the same time is quite prescriptive in parts of follow-up. I advocate that an approach based on ethical principles is required. To start with, what is needed for the patient and their family is disclosure of the uncertainty of the problem and options open to them. This respects their autonomy to make a decision for follow-up that suits them. This is a partnership of care that takes into account their knowledge of their family, their own circumstances and the way they wish to raise their child. Next, we need to ensure good, evidenced based outcomes for these infants. This is beneficence, and labelling them with CF is unlikely to achieve this. In considering this problem, we should not forget the intent of newborn screening, which is to find those infants with CF who would benefit from early diagnosis. Also remembering how hard it was to prove benefit of newborn screening to patients with a clear diagnosis of CF, there is no evidence of benefit to the CRMS group. In attempting to manage these CRMS infants \"in case they have CF\" there is little normal data on fundamental aspects of CF care such as throat/cough swabs, and little evidence of key treatments such as prophylactic antibiotics, infant airway clearance and mucolytic therapy. Basic genetic counselling is essential, in particular to offer choices to the parent carrier's family, but on this point it is no different to how carriers discovered by newborn screening are dealt with. Beyond routine health advice such as avoidance of cigarette smoke exposure, breast feeding where possible and annual influenza vaccine from six months of age there is not evidence for CF specific advice in this group. Just as important is making sure that no harm comes to these infants (and their families), this is non-maleficence. There are considerable psychosocial risks to the family or child taking on a sick role when there is no illness. Harm may also arise from medication side-effects, irradiation or general anaesthetic for procedures. There may be considerable harm from more in depth genetic counselling, trying to base future reproductive decisions on uncertain (or wrong) advice. Later there may be adverse insurance or employment outcomes, a consequence of a label misapplied many years before. The principle of justice is perhaps the weakest one upon which to argue, but in a health care setting that is increasingly limited, it is difficult to justify the expense of diagnostic and treatment resources on people with no illness.",

Better estimates of CFTR function for all the known sequence variations need to be developed. Data should be collected on the outcome of those infants whose families elect active surveillance. Newborn screening for CF provides the opportunity to optimize nutritional status early and to monitor for and potentially treat lung disease prior to the onset of irreversible structural airway damage.

Their study demonstrated that the airways of the CF cohort had thicker walls with more dilated lumens. Compared with airways from the healthy population, 94% of children with CF were reported to have at least 1 airway that was considered bronchiectatic. Martinez, et al (13) performed limited-slice high-resolution chest CT in younger subjects with CF (8 months to 2.5 years) and found that children with CF had airways with thickened walls and narrower lumens compared with controls. It is unclear whether the observed airway wall thickening is a precursor of the findings of Long, et al in slightly older subjects, or indeed, of bronchiectasis as there are few longitudinal data. However, bronchiectasis can be identified by high-resolution chest CT even in the first few months of life (10) with one prospective population-based cohort study showing that the prevalence of bronchiectasis increased subsequently during the preschool years (11) . Bronchiectasis is already established by 8 years of age in the majority of children with CF. In a recent prospective study (14) in children who had been diagnosed clinically with CF, 51/60 (85%) had evidence of bronchiectasis on volumetric chest CT at a mean age of 7.8 years.

This indicates that improvements in clinical management of CF lung disease in the preschool years, prior to the first performance of spirometry, has resulted in such detectable improvement. The improved outcomes are likely to be due to multiple factors although we are well aware that there is little evidence to support any specific treatment during the pre-school years. However, our accumulated clinical experience suggests that a combination of aggressive treatment of infections, airway clearance, nutritional treatment and support and attentive clinical supervision have contributed to better outcomes. Including all these facets in management of infants (maximum treatment) is necessary. In addition, newer strategies in CF, such as eradication of infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa by the use of aggressive antimicrobial therapy, which was also introduced widely into clinical practice without the benefit of randomized control trials but on the basis of results of observational studies, are also indicated. Many would suggest that there would not now be equipoise if randomized control trials of any of these component strategies were to be conducted.

The harms must be weighed carefully against the proposed benefits -not least because bronchoscopy in young children requires general anaesthesia. In one of the most important clinical trials to be conducted in screened infants with CF, Wainwright and colleagues (4) randomised infants to BAL directed therapy (initial BAL before 6 months; when hospitalised for respiratory symptoms; before and after P. aeruginosa eradication therapy). This was compared with standard therapy (treatment based on upper respiratory specimens). At 5 years the two groups were compared by looking for P. aeruginosa in BAL and by HRCT score. There was no difference between the two groups for either of the primary outcomes. However bronchoscopy was not without complications: 5% of procedures were followed by a substantial clinical deterioration and 29% by a worsening cough.",

Until then treatment should be restricted to those therapies where there is good evidence of benefit and where the benefits outweigh the harms. The results of the ISIS trial have been published (1) with an accompanying editorial (2). Briefly, this was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 7% hypertonic saline versus 0.9% isotonic saline inhaled twice daily for a year in 321 patients with CF younger than 6 years of age. This trial was the first to evaluate a non-antibiotic therapy in children with CF in this young age group, and speaks to the ability of this type of study to be done in the future in young children with CF. Assessing potential therapies before the age of 6 years is important because therapies in this age group may be able to prevent lung damage from occurring, rather than treating lung damage that is already irreversible. Hypertonic saline did not have any effects on the primary or secondary outcome measures, which included pulmonary exacerbation rates and measures of respiratory symptoms, respectively.

Activation of \"alternative,\" calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs) is considered to be a potential strategy for CF therapy, and potentially for pancreatic and biliary hyposecetion, dry mouth/eye and gastrointestinal hypomotility disorders. Airway epithelial cells express CaCCs, as do secretory epithelial cells and pacemaker cells in the gastrointestinal tract. In CF, the rationale is that activation of CaCCs would restore chloride permeability to CFTR-deficient, CF cells.

TMEM16A is also involved in intestinal and vascular smooth muscle contraction, nociception and bile formation. There are multiple TMEM16 family members, with the A and B isoforms functioning as CaCCs. In addition, there are multiple variants of each isoform produced by alternative splicing, which introduces considerable complexity in the analysis of TMEM16 expression, function and pharmacology. Though TMEM16A is likely the major CaCC in salivary and airway submucosal gland epithelia, and in intestinal pacemaker cells (interstitial cells of Cajal), the molecular identity remains unknown of the other, perhaps more than one, epithelial CaCC(s).",

            "text": "CaCC inhibitors. Until recently, available CaCC inhibitors included non-selective anion transport inhibitors with low potency such as DIDS, DPC, NPPB and niflumic acid. In 2008, prior to the molecular identification of TMEM16A as a CaCC, we identified CaCC inhibitors from a phenotype-based high-throughput screening in human intestinal epithelial cells (HT-29), in which YFP-H148Q/L152L was introduced using lentivirus (2). The most potent inhibitor, the arylaminothiophene CaCCinh-A01, had IC50 ~ 1 \u00b5M for CaCC inhibition in multiple cell types. CaCCinh-A01 is under evaluation as a candidate therapy for rotaviral diarrhea. Following the identification of TMEM16A, we carried out high-throughput screens to identify inhibitors that target TMEM16A directly, without affecting upstream calcium signaling. We found that some compounds, including tannic acid and related gallotannins (3), function as non-selective CaCC inhibitors that block TMEM16A and other, as yet unidentified, CaCC(s) in multiple cell types. We proposed that CaCC inhibition by gallotannins in red wines and green teas may account, in part, for their health benefits including reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. TMEM16A-selective inhibitors were also identified, including the aminophenylthiazole T16Ainh-A01 (4) and the natural product eugenol (5). T16Ainh-A01 inhibited CaCC chloride current in TMEM16A-transfected cells and in cultures of human salivary gland and IL-4 treated bronchial epithelia, but not in intestine, providing pharmacological data on TMEM16A involvement in CaCC function in various tissues, and for its limited involvement in CaCC activity in unstimulated human airway surface epithelium and intestinal epithelium. T16Ainh-A01 has been widely used in TMEM16-related research. In CF, TMEM16A inhibitors might reduce mucin secretion.",

By patch-clamp, N-aroylaminothiazole \"activators\" (Eact) strongly increased chloride current at zero calcium, whereas tetrazolylbenzamide \"potentiators\" (Fact) were not active at 0 calcium but reduced the EC50 for calcium-dependent TMEM16A activation. Of 682 analogs tested, the most potent activator and potentiator produced large and more sustained CaCC chloride currents than purinergic agonists of calcium signaling. Interestingly, analogs of activators were identified that fully inhibited TMEM16A Clconductance, providing evidence for direct TMEM16A binding. Eact increased CaCC conductance in human salivary and airway submucosal gland epithelial cells, and IL-4 treated bronchial cells, and stimulated submucosal gland secretion in human bronchi and smooth muscle contraction in mouse intestine. Phenotypebased screening is in progress to identify activators of non-TMEM16 CaCC(s) in human airway epithelial cells.",

Research suggests that a neonatal diagnosis can affect parent child-relationships, but the mechanism remains elusive. This investigation used video recorded observations of parent child interactions during feedings and parent self-reports to examine factors contributing to the quality of parents' relationships with their infants 12 months after receiving normal or abnormal newborn screening results. The sample included 131 mothers and 118 fathers of 131 infants whose newborn screening and follow-up diagnostic results ranged in severity to include cystic fibrosis diagnosis (CF group, n=23), congenital hypothyroidism (CH group, n=35), CF carrier status (CF-C, n=38), or healthy with normal NBS results (H group, n=35).

Results showed that mothers and fathers of infants with CF reported significantly higher perceptions of child vulnerability (p< 0.001, p=0.002) than parents in the H group. Mothers who perceived their children as more vulnerable were significantly more likely to also perceive their children as less attached than mothers who viewed their infants as less vulnerable (p=0.001). Mothers and fathers who perceived their infants as less attached were significantly more likely to engage in taskoriented feeding behavior than parents who viewed their infants as more attached (p=0.016, p=0.029). Mothers and fathers who engaged in more task-oriented behavior were also observed to show significantly less overall positive (p< 0.001, p< 0.001) and significantly more overall negative interactions (p< 0.001, p= 0.001) with their infants than parents who used less task-oriented feeding strategies. Fathers who perceived their infants as more vulnerable showed significantly more negative overall interactions with their infants than fathers who perceived their infants as less vulnerable (p< 0.001). When mothers and fathers demonstrated high levels of affective involvement and verbalization, their infants were significantly more likely to exhibit favorable levels of affective expressiveness, communicative skills, and social responsiveness (p< 0.001, p< 0.001). Similarly, when mothers and fathers demonstrated more negative affect and/or inconsistent and intrusive behavior, their infants were significantly more likely to be dysregulated and irritable (p< 0.001, p< 0.001). As predicted there was a significant positive association between the two infant observational factors. Although mothers with lower educational levels were more likely to report depressive symptoms than higher educated mothers, a neonatal diagnosis was not associated with increased anxiety or depression in mothers or fathers relative to the health comparison group 12 months after diagnosis. Fathers of infants identified as CF carriers through newborn screening tended to view their children as significantly more attached than H group fathers (p=0.021).

The pattern of symptoms in women with PPD are indistinguishable from the characteristic major depression that can occur at other times in a woman's life. The symptoms of PPD can include depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, insomnia, fatigue, decreased appetite, feelings of worthlessness, poor concentration, and thoughts of death or suicidal ideation. Untreated, PPD can have negative consequences for the infant including an increased risk of insecure attachment and cognitive and behavioral problems (7, 8) . Additionally, for the mother with CF, a postpartum depression can not only interfere with caretaking for the infant but may interfere with the new mom's ability to care for her CF.

For example, \"Since your baby was born, have you felt down, depressed or hopeless? Since your baby was born, have you had little interest or pleasure in activities most of the day nearly every day for the past two weeks?\" If the woman answers in the affirmative to either question, it is a positive screening result. The level of impairment and distress can be explored with the question, \"Has the depression made it hard for you to do your work, take care of things at home, or get along with people?\" Treatment: PPD screening improves recognition of the disorder, but improvement in clinical outcomes requires care that ensures adequate treatment and fol-low-up. Responses to a positive postpartum depression screening range from providing reassurance to supportive strategies for postpartum blues and mild depression, to referral for specific interventions for moderate to severe depression (Edinburgh score >13). Education is always important and lets the mother know she is not alone, she is not to blame, and that she will get better. Non-pharmacological interventions are useful in treating PPD, especially in mild illness, as an adjunct to antidepressant medication in more severe depression, and in women reluctant to use medications, for example during breast-feeding. Evidence exists for the use of both cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy in the treatment of PPD (13) . Antidepressants are often prescribed to treat PPD; however, few studies have systematically assessed the treatment specifically of PPD. For evidence based guidelines on the pharmacologic treatment of depression in adults, including PPD, see the American Psychiatric Association's practice guidelines at http//www.psych.org/guidelines/mdd2010 (14) . When concerns are significant to warrant referral mothers may be referred to their obstetricians for follow-up and to mental health providers for therapy and/or medication management. If suicidality or psychosis is a concern, or the score on the Edinburg scale is greater than 20, accessing crisis intervention services are necessary. To date, most studies in CF have found that both children and adults have higher rates of depressive and anxious symptoms (Smith et al., 2010; Riekert et al., 2007) than healthy peers and parents have also endorsed elevated psychological symptoms (Quittner et al., 1992; Driscoll et al., 2010) . To date, however, all of these studies have been limited by small sample sizes and single center recruitment. To address the limitations of prior studies, we have been conducting a national study of the prevalence of depression and anxiety in children, adolescents, and adults with CF and parent caregivers. The specific aims of this study were to: 1) use standardized screening tools to evaluate the prevalence of depression and anxiety, 2) to test the relationships between demographic and health variables and psychological symptoms, and 3) to evaluate whether recent medical events, such as IV antibiotic treatments, new diagnosis of CFrelated diabetes, or recent hemoptysis or pneumothorax are predictive of depressive and anxious symptoms.",

Anxiety and depression appear to be more common in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) than in the general population. For those who are living with a chronic illness, anxiety and depression have been shown to have negative impact on health outcome. Recent studies indicated that people with CF experience symptoms of anxiety more frequently than depression (1, 2) . Data from the German arm of The International Depression/anxiety Epidemiological Study (TIDES) reported an elevated anxiety scores found in 20.6% of the patients with CF and 9.6% high level of symptoms of depression. They also found that recent hemoptysis, pneumothorax and recent diagnosis of diabetes were associated with anxiety, whereas impaired lung function and transplant listing status were associated with depression (3). Hegarty and colleagues studied the quality of life in young people with CF including the effect of hospitalization, age and gender and differences in parent/child perceptions. Their data showed that inpatients score significantly lower than outpatients for the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised version (CFQ-R) in the domains regarding emotional state, social, body image and respiratory symptoms (4) . Their findings clearly demonstrated that there are added stresses during hospitalization, which in turn may provide a perfect opportunity for health care providers to encourage patients to express their concerns and seek appropriate referral or support for them.",

We have a 15 bed in-patient respiratory unit for adults with CF and other lung diseases. The majority of admissions are patients with CF at any given time. Most of them are admitted due to pulmonary exacerbation for IV antibiotics. However, other medical interventions including desensitization to antibiotics, steroid therapy, insulin regimen, oxygen or Bipap may also be initiated during the same admission. We have observed a fair amount of anxiety and fear and depression from our CF patients during their hospitalizations. According to our Picker Score from 2010, our patients were reporting that their anxiety and fear during their hospitalization were only addressed at 35% of the time. Therefore, in May 2010, as part of the corporate initiative for quality improvement, our unit nurses took on the task to reduce anxiety and fear in our hospitalized patients by utilizing the Best Practice Guideline of Establishing Therapeutic Relationship and Professionalism in Nursing. The frame-work for establishing therapeutic relationship is having knowledge about the disease, the patient, the nurse herself and the system (5). To implement the project, the unit nurses needed to know the source of patients' anxiety and fear, how they like their anxiety and fear addressed. The nurses also needed to have a standardized mechanism to communicate findings to other nurses on patient admission and shift report as well as to the interdisciplinary team on rounds. As for the patients, they need to have opportunities to convey fear and anxiety to their nurses. Both nurses and patients must have confidence in the standardized mechanism to ensure that fear and anxiety are communicated to the relevant team members and from shift to shift for appropriate interventions.",

A key to the understanding of CF airway disease was the finding that CFTR also regulated the epithelial Na + channel (ENaC), leading to raised Na + and fluid absorption in CFTR's absence (1) . This initial discovery that CFTR can regulate ENaC was made over 25 years ago. However, the mechanism of CFTR's influence of ENaC remains obscure. Both CFTR and ENaC reside in the apical membrane of airway epithelia and can be coimmunoprecipitated from native airway epithelia, which suggests a physical interaction, although a specific mechanism remains to be outlined (2) . CFTR may also indirectly regulate ENaC through soluble reporter molecules that are present in the airway surface liquid (3). This latter mode of regulation is variable, and may be lost under some experimental conditions. Pending a mechanistic explanation for the physical regulation of ENaC by CFTR, the possibility of indirect regulation will be discussed below.",

            "text": "Mucus clearance is an important aspect of the mammalian lung's innate defense system. During normal mucus clearance, inhaled pathogens become trapped in the mucus layer and are expelled before they can colonize the airways. The mucus layer is kept away from underlying epithelia by the presence of a ~7 \u00b5m periciliary liquid layer (PCL), which acts as a lubricant for the mucus. Together, these layers make up the airway surface liquid (ASL). The rate of mucociliary clearance is strongly influenced by the hydration state of the ASL. ASL volume hydration is largely maintained by Clsecretion through CFTR, with Na + and H 2 O following. However, as ASL moves up the respiratory tract, due to a reduction in surface area as airways converge, excess ASL is absorbed when needed via isotonic Na + -led ASL absorption, which is mediated by ENaC. Our experimental data indicate that ASL volume and ion transport regulation are in dynamic equilibrium, and that either a reduction in CFTR-mediated Clsecretion or an increase in ENaC-mediated Na + absorption will lead to PCL depletion and mucus dehydration. However, the contribution of ENaC dysregulation to chronic CF lung disease is currently controversial. The extracellular loops of \u03b1 and \u03b3 ENaC can be proteolytically cleaved at multiple sites by intracellular furin-type convertases and extracellular serine proteases, leading to activation of the channel and increased Na + absorption. Based upon studies of well differentiated nasal and bronchial cultures grown at the air liquid interface, we conclude that restraint of proteolytic cleavage of ENaC is an essential part of normal airway physiology and vital for limiting Na + absorption rates. Thus, while our data from CF nasal and bronchial epithelial cultures show that ENaC is hyperactive in comparison to normal nasal/bronchial epithelia, bypassing the spontaneous suppression of ENaC cleavage seen in normal airways also leads to ASL volume depletion.",

Importantly, these reporter molecules are contained within the ASL and are lost when cultures are mounted in Ussing chambers or following other experimental protocols that require flooding of the mucosal surface. Thus, the study of normal and CF airway epithelia under thin film conditions is essential to understanding the regulation of CFTR and ENaC and studies of airway epithelia under flooded conditions may produce aberrant results. In contrast, thin film studies correlate well with the increased cleavage pattern seen with ENaC in CF airways biochemically (2) .",

In contrast, adenosine levels are not different in CF airways, but the effector (i.e., CFTR) is absent or defective and so CF airways are unresponsive to changes in adenosine. Using a proteomic screen, we recently identified SPLUNC1 as an ASL volume-sensing molecule that acts as a potent negative regulator of ENaC that serves to prevent excessive volume absorption when ASL volume is at optimum levels (4). Removal or dilution of SPLUNC1 leads to increased ASL absorption and temporary ENaC hyperactivity in normal airway culturesuntil SPLUNC1 levels rise again. For reasons that are currently under investigation, SPLUNC1 is present in CF ASL but is unable to regulate ENaC, suggesting that indirect regulation of ENaC by reporter molecules is defective in CF airways. To better understand defective SPLUNC1 regulation in CF, we identified the ENaC inhibitory domain of SPLUNC1 and further proteomic analysis suggested that this domain may be functionally deficient in CF airways.",

Due to a salt/water imbalance, this mucus is sufficiently hydrated to increase ASL height but too dehydrated to be functionally cleared (i.e., 10-20% solids in CF vs.~2% solids in non-CF). Thus, we predict that continued mucin secretion in the absence of a functional PCL leads to a greater ASL height in CF compared to normal airways, but with decreased water availability (e.g., dehydration) and reduced ability to be cleared. We propose that this \"growing\" of dehydrated mucus in CF airways following Clhyposecretion and Na + hyperabsorption leads to mucus plug formation in CF airways. Failure of CF ion transport is likely heterogeneous, reflecting the heterogeneity of CF lung disease, and in some places this may be partially rescued by alternate Clchannels such as the Ca 2+ activated Clchannelat least until an insult such as a viral exacerbation overwhelms the ion transport capacity and tips the balance toward mucus dehydration. We conclude that CFTR may interact with ENaC in multiple ways and that dysregulation of either channel can lead to PCL collapse and mucus dehydration. Thus, any therapies aimed at removing mucus should be directed to normalizing ASL hydration levels and should begin as early as possible after birth.",

Aberrant HCO 3 secretion is likely to contribute to CF lung pathogenesis as efficient secretion and solubilisation of secreted macromolecules (such as mucus) is a pH-dependent process. Furthermore, abnormal pH/[HCO 3 -] negatively impacts mucus hydration and viscosity, bacterial killing and ciliary beat frequency, that collectively would predispose the lungs to mucus blockage, bacterial infection, and disease (3) (4) (5) .",

Loss of CFTR could therefore lead to aberrant HCO 3 secretion via reduced Cl -/HCO 3 exchange activity, as well as through reduced HCO 3 efflux through CFTR. We have been investigating HCO 3 transport in the Calu-3 cell line, which is used as a model of serous cells of human submucosal glands (SMGs). Our recent results (6) from these cells show that Cl -/HCO 3 exchange makes a major contribution to transcellular HCO 3 transport. Real time measurement of intracellular pH from polarized cultures of Calu-3 cells demonstrate cAMP/PKA-activated Cl --dependent HCO 3 transport across the luminal membrane via CFTR-dependent coupled Cl -/HCO 3 anion exchange. The pharmacological and functional profile of the luminal anion exchanger was consistent with the activity of SLC26A4 (pendrin), which was shown to be expressed by quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence. Pendrin-mediated anion exchange activity was confirmed by shRNA pendrin knockdown (KD), which markedly reduced cAMP-activated Cl -/HCO 3 exchange. Furthermore, pendrin activity was dependent on ion transport by CFTR, suggesting that lack of functional CFTR in CF would depress pendrin-mediated HCO 3 secretion. To establish the relative roles of CFTR and pendrin in net HCO 3 secretion, transepithelial liquid secretion rate and liquid pH were measured in wild type, pendrin KD and CFTR KD cells. cAMP/PKA increased the rate and pH of the secreted fluid. Inhibiting CFTR reduced the rate of liquid secretion but not the pH, whereas decreasing pendrin activity lowered pH with little effect on volume. These results establish that CFTR predominately controls the rate of liquid secretion while pendrin regulates the composition of the secreted fluid and identifies for the first time a critical role for this anion exchanger in transcellular HCO 3 secretion in airway serous cells. Physiologically, CFTR-regulated Cl -/HCO 3 exchange in airway SMGs may be important in maintaining the pH of the ASL, which could therefore explain the acidic pH reported in CF airways (7) (8) (9) . In the context of SMGs and CF, lack of pendrin-mediated HCO 3 secretion would therefore predispose the glands to mucus blockage and damage, a characteristic sign of CF airway disease and an important mediator of lung pathophysiology. Therefore, restoring ASL pH through a CFTR-independent, pendrin-mediated, mechanism could represent a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of CF, and current research is directed at this possibility. Furthermore, since pendrin expression has been linked to enhanced mucin gene expression in response to inflam-matory cytokines (10) , suggests that pendrin has multiple roles in airways physiology. Overall, our work suggests that a better understanding of pendrin function and dysfunction in the airways is vital for the development of future therapies for CF airway disease. Several members of the SLC26A family of anion transporters have been found to associate with CFTR and participate in a coordinated regulation of both CFTR function and SLC26A activity (1) (2) (3) (4) . Since the different SLC26A family members show significant diversity in function, substrate, and tissue specificity (5), their coordinated regulation by CFTR may confer the unique anion permeability and transport characteristics of the different organs that are affected by CF. Our lab has recently char-acterized the activity of SLC26A9, found in lung and gastric epithelia, and its coordinated regulation by wt CFTR (2) . In HEK293 cells, SLC26A9 exhibits chloride channel-like properties, is inhibited by CFTR channel blockers, and interacts with CFTR to enhance both constitutive and cAMP/PKA-stimulated chloride secretion. In primary, human bronchial epithelia (HBE) from non-CF donors, constitutive anion secretion bears the pharmacological fingerprint of SLC26A9. Importantly, SLC26A9 activity is absent in HBE from \u2206F508 donors even though SLC26A9 mRNA is abundant, suggestive of an interaction between CFTR and SLC26A9 that commences at an early stage of protein maturation. In support of this, SLC26A9 immunoprecipitates (IPs) contain both immature (band B) and mature (band C) wt CFTR.",

Indeed, co-expression of SLC26A9 with CFTR increased total protein expression for both, compared to the protein levels of the individually expressed channels. As with wtCFTR, SLC26A9 co-IPs both band B and C G551D CFTR, as well as band B \u2206F508 CFTR, confirming that the proteins interact at an early stage of protein maturation. The interaction between SLC26A9 and \u2206F508 CFTR does not appear to inhibit maturation of SLC26A9, however, as glycosidase assays reveal that the predominant form of SLC26A9 observed in whole cell lysates from HEK293 expressing SLC26A9 \u00b1 CFTR is complex glycosylated. Similarly, biotinylation assays indicate that the levels of SLC26A9 at the plasma membrane are not substantially reduced when co-expressed with \u2206F508 CFTR. Consequently, the suppression of SLC26A9 constitutive activity when co-expressed with \u2206F508 CFTR does not appear to result from a direct interaction, as the proteins are spatially distinct.

Our results have also shown that SLC26A9 exerts a strong influence on the cAMP/PKA-stimulated activity of wtCFTR, as evidenced by a synergistic increase in the forskolin-stimulated current observed during whole cell patch clamp of HEK293 co-expressing SLC26A9 + wtCFTR (2) . However, since both SLC26A9 and CFTR conduct anions, and we lack a spe-cific inhibitor of SLC26A9, determining the mechanism of the observed synergism is challenging. In experiments with SLC26A3 and SLC26A6, Ko, et al. (1) found that the STAS (sulfate transporter and anti-sigma antagonist) domain of these SLC26A family members interacted with the R-domain of wtCFTR, and that co-expression of the STAS domain alone with wtCFTR was sufficient to potentiate the single channel activity of CFTR. We utilized a similar approach, using a STAS domain construct of SLC26A9 (A9 STAS). HEK293 co-expressing A9 STAS + wtCFTR exhibited a forskolin stimulated current that was similar to cells co-expressing SLC26A9 + wtCFTR (-300 \u00b1 39 pA/pF, n = 5, vs. -282 \u00b1 28 pA/pF, n = 18, p=0.4) and significantly greater than cells expressing wtCFTR alone (-197 \u00b1 34 pA/pF, n = 26, p<0.05). Cells expressing A9 STAS + wtCFTR did not exhibit constitutive activity (-2 \u00b1 1 pA/pF, p<0.001), consistent with a lack of SLC26A9's conductive pathway. In excised, inside-out patch clamp of CHO cells expressing wtCFTR \u00b1 A9 STAS, the presence of A9 STAS significantly increased the single channel conductance of wtCFTR upon PKA+ATP activation (11.5 \u00b1 1.1 pS, n = 10 vs. 9 \u00b1 1 pS, n = 25, p<0.05). Thus, the observed synergy appears to result, in part, from an increase in the conductance of wtCFTR through an interaction with the STAS domain of SLC26A9.",

How these discreet changes in CFTR activity contribute to the unique anion transport functions of these organs is currently unclear; however, it is clear that even the microscopic properties of CFTR can be modified through interactions specific to the epithelia in which it is expressed. Our results have also demonstrated that co-expression of trafficking deficient \u2206F508 CFTR significantly mutes the constitutive activity of SLC26A9, while the functional mutation G551D CFTR or the absence of CFTR does not.

This will allow an organized release that is triggered by removal of calcium ions, something that bicarbonate is necessary for (1). Mice lacking functional CFTR (Cftr\u2206508) have no lung phenotype, but show similar ileal problems as humans. The ileal mucosa in CF have a mucus that adhered to the epithelium, was denser, and was less penetrable than that of wild-type mice (2) . The properties of the ileal mucus of CF mice were normalized by secretion into a high concentration sodium bicarbonate buffer (about 100 mM). In addition, bicarbonate added to already formed CF mucus almost completely restored the mucus properties. This knowledge and experimental system used allow novel ways of testing CF therapies and suggest more therapeutic options for a successful CF lung therapy. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive inherited disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.

First, we have found that lack of CFTR in the porcine airway leads to more acidic airway surface liquid (ASL) -an observation similar to earlier reports (5) (6) (7) (8) . Furthermore, the more acidic ASL in CF porcine airways impairs bacterial host defense and this defect can be restored with topical bicarbonate treatment. Second, the viscosity of methacholine-stimulated secretions from CF porcine airways is greater than non-CF. These findings suggest that lack of CFTR alters the physiochemical properties of airway secretions and these abnormalities are likely related to lack of CFTR-mediated Cland/or HCO 3 transport. Finally, we are currently investigating the role of CFTR in mucociliary transport in newborn non-CF and CF pigs, prior to the onset of infection and inflammation.",

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), an anion transporter of chloride and bicarbonate. Defective or deficient CFTR leads to severe mucoobstructive lung disease and severe morbidity and early mortality due to lung infections. Even though substantial advances in our understanding of CF pathogenesis have been made, we still do not fully understand the pathophysiologic mechanisms that lead to decreased mucociliary clearance (MCC) in CF patients. For example, whether absent CFTR function results in depletion of the airway surface liquid (ASL) in human airways, and whether this explains early deficits in MCC that lead to chronic infection is actively debated (1) . More recent studies in CF pigs have suggested the ASL \"low volume\" model may not be operative in vivo (2, 3) . These results emphasize the importance of accurately measuring ASL depth in vivo, so that the pathophysiologic relationship between ASL/periciliary layer (PCL) regulation and MCC can be defined. In contrast, innate abnormalities in CF mucus have long been postulated to contribute to the disease (e.g., mucoviscidosis), but whether this is a primary phenomenon, or a result of downstream consequences of the CF defect, also remains unknown (4, 5) . Resolving these issues is imperative, as discerning the nature of the innate CF defect in vivo could resolve a longstanding controversy and result in new therapeutic opportunities that address operative pathophysiology. This knowledge could also lead to new insights regarding the onset and progression of CF lung disease in children, including the small airways.",

Methods for measuring mucociliary clearance have been previously described (1, 2) . These techniques involve the inhalation of a radiolabeled particulate in liquid aerosol. Gamma camera images collected after aerosol delivery are then used to quantify particle clearance over periods from 60 minutes to 24 hours. These studies have provided important mechanistic proof of principle for treatments such as inhaled hypertonic saline (3) and mannitol (4) . Here we explore a novel aerosol-based technique to detect changes in airway liquid absorption. This technique uses multiple radiopharmaceutical probes delivered together in a liquid aerosol to the airway epithelium. We hypothesize that the absorption rate of a hydrophilic small-molecule probe (Indium 111-DTPA) will be influenced by paracellular liquid transport, and will provide a gauge of the total liquid absorption rate from the airway when stimulated by liquid volume addition. The clearance rate of the small-molecule probe will be influenced by mucociliary transport as well as absorption. The mucociliary contribution is estimated by simultaneously measuring the clearance rate of non-absorbable sulfur colloid particles radiolabeled with technetium 99m. The lung distribution patterns and clearance rates of the two probes can be quantified independently based on the different energy levels associated with In111 and Tc99m. We have studied the relationship between DTPA and liquid absorption rate using primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cell cultures from CF and non-CF lungs. We have also compared DTPA absorption rates in the lungs of CF patients and healthy controls (5) . Studies to determine DTPA absorption response to a well characterized therapy (7% hypertonic saline) are on-going as are studies of DTPA absorption in pediatric CF subjects and healthy controls.",

            "text": "In vitro observations: Multiple factors are likely to influence the absorption rate of DTPA. No previous evidence for a transcellular pathway for DTPA absorption has been described, so a paracellular path is assumed. Tight junction pore diameter and DTPA concentration in the ASL could influence diffusion across the epithelium. We propose that DTPA absorption can occur directly through paracellular liquid transport if a stimulus for liquid absorption is applied, and that the airway liquid hyper-absorption characteristic of CF will be reflected in increased DTPA absorption rates. To test this hypothesis we measured the DTPA absorption rate in 5 CF and 7 non-CF HBE cell lines (n=6 cultures/line) after the addition of 10 \u00b5L of 10 \u00b5Ci/mL technetium 99m labeled DTPA (Tc-DTPA) in Ringer's. The DTPA absorption rate was significantly increased in the CF HBE cells (54.9\u00b18.6 vs. 32.1\u00b17.3 %/24hrs; p<0.001). Using a previously described optical method for measuring airway surface liquid (ASL) volume (6) we compared liquid and DTPA absorption rates in CF HBEs after the addition of 2.5, 5 and 10 \u00b5L of 10 \u00b5Ci/mL Tc-DTPA. There was a linear relationship between the amount of DTPA absorbed (based on radioactivity) and the ASL volume absorbed for all three volumes tested (R2=0.96, 0.99, and 0.56 respec-tively). Both the DTPA and liquid absorption rates increased linearly as the volume added to the epithelial surface was increased. Previous studies have demonstrated increases in ENaC current in response to ASL volume expansion that would be expected to increase liquid absorption (7) . We also measured DTPA absorption after the establishment of several different transepithelial osmotic gradients. Basolateral mannitol (150 and 300 mM) increased DTPA absorption from the apical surface in a dose-dependent, linear fashion. Apical mannitol (300 mM) decreased but did not prevent the absorption of DTPA (28.6 \u00b1 8.7 vs. 45.9 \u00b1 13.2 %/24 hrs; p=0.005) in CF HBEs, suggesting a diffusive component related to concentration gradient. Notably, the DTPA absorption rate of the CF cells treated with apical mannitol approximates that of non-CF cells. Finally, we sought to determine the relationship between transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and DTPA absorption rate in CF and non-CF cells. TER was measured using a transepithelial volt-ohmmeter in 30 individual non-CF and 12 CF HBE cultures 24 hours prior to DTPA absorption measurements. While the average TER measured in the CF cells was lower than that of the non-CF cells, there was no relationship between TER and DTPA absorption rate across an extensive range of TER values. DTPA absorption was significantly increased in CF cells when compared to non-CF cells with similar TER levels.",

Beta carotene is the most well-known carotenoid however several others carotenes exists. Typically we ingest preformed vitamin A from animal sources (liver, egg yolks, etc.) whereas provitamin A is found in plant sources (green leafy vegetables, carrots). Oral vitamin A supplements can contain both the active preformed vitamin A (retinol) as well as the provitamin A which is converted to retinol within the body once ingested. Provitamin A is less potent than retinol. In order to understand the physiologic impact of vitamin A supplementation, one needs to calculate the total amount of active vitamin A by converting the provitamin A to its retinol equivalent and adding it to the preformed vitamin A that is ingested. The units associated with vitamin A can be expressed as international units (IU), micrograms (\u00b5g) or retinol activity equivalents (RAE).",

Retinol is the preferred measurement to assess vitamin A status over its derivatives because retinol concentrations are tightly controlled and will not drop until body stores are significantly compromised. In comparison, controversy exists over whether serum retinol levels accurately reflect vitamin A stores in the setting of excess. The ideal measure of body stores of retinol is to assess the liver content however there is no non-invasive way to accurately measure this, short of a liver biopsy. Dietary protein, energy, and zinc are required for synthesis of RBP therefore in severe malnutrition, serum retinol levels may be falsely low due to decreased RBP production.

In the 2002 CFF Consensus report on nutrition (1), it is recommended that vitamin A levels be measured annually and when serum levels are low, supplementation is initiated. The recommended supplementation varies depending on age. Some concern has been raised recently about elevated retinol levels with chronic supplementation in CF. A cross-sectional study of vitamin A intake and serum retinol levels from 73 pre-adolescent children with CF was compared with healthy age-matched controls (2) . The vitamin A supplementation was higher in the CF cohort as might be expected since vitamin A supplementation is standard therapy in CF. Mean serum retinol levels were also higher in the CF group compared to healthy controls although both groups remained in the normal range. Forty-seven percent of CF subjects, however, had serum retinol values above the 95th percentile reference range. A second study published in 2008 (3) assessed vitamin intake and serum levels in a cohort of children and young adults (mean age 14.5 yrs) with CF compare to healthy controls. In this study 58% of CF subjects had serum retinol levels above the upper limit of normal. Elevated serum retinol levels appear to be even more prevalent post-lung transplantation. Two published studies have shown that retinol levels significantly increase, frequently above the upper limit of normal, following transplantation despite no change in oral supplementation (4, 5) . This finding is not specific to CF as it was also found in those transplanted for reasons other than CF.",

Studies in the non-CF population have shown a correlation between bone disease/fracture risk and excess oral vitamin A intake as well as elevated serum retinol levels. One study found that serum retinol levels in the highest quintile (> 2.64 \u00b5mol/L) had a higher risk of any fracture (RR=1.64) and hip fracture in particular (RR=2.47) (7) . When serum levels were greater than 3.6 \u00b5mol/L, the RR increased to 7.14 for any fracture. Previous studies have shown that 77% of post transplant subjects had levels greater than 2.64 and almost 40% had levels greater than 3.60 \u00b5mol/L suggesting a large proportion of post transplant patients are at increased fracture risk from hypervitaminosis A (4).",

There are eight naturally occurring forms of vit E (tocopherols and tocotrienols). Fortified foods and vitamin supplements are synthetic compounds, usually alpha-tocopherol. These various forms have different levels of biological activity in humans. Food sources are mainly from vegetable oils/spreads (~20%), and the remaining from cereals, grains, nuts, fruits, vegetables and the fatty portion of meats. Recommended daily allowances (RDA) range from 4 mg/d in infants to 15 mg/d in adults and 19 mg/d for lactation. Gut absorption of vit E is inefficient and dependent on bile acids, pancreatic lipase, micelle formation, uptake in the enterocytes and chylomicron formation. It then travels from the liver with VDLD, VDL and LDL particles. Excretion includes urinary metabolites from alpha and gamma tocopherol with the majority of vit E excreted in the stool (un-absorbed) and minor amounts in bile secreted into stool.",

This pattern of intake resulted in mean serum levels of alpha-tocopherol and alphatocopherol adjusted for serum cholesterol that were much higher than the healthy population comparisons (4).

It is not clear how much these contribute to overall vitamin K status. Both can function as the essential co-factor for the posttranslational conversion of specific glutamyl residues to gamma-carboxyglutamyl residues in vitamin K dependent proteins. When undercarboxylated these proteins, e.g., prothrombin and osteocalcin (OC), are functionally defective. This may result in clinically significant bleeding and/or low bone mineral status. In the non-CF population in the absence of malabsorption, because of the efficient liver use of available vitamin K, impaired blood coagulation is rare but the dependent bone proteins are more susceptible to vitamin K deficiency. In the CF population in the absence of supplementation vitamin K deficiency is almost universal and people with CF are therefore likely to have negative coagulation and bone mineral density consequences.",

Leafy green vegetables and whole grains (fortified) are good sources of folic acid. Digestive tract atrophy, diarrhea, anorexia, weight loss, megaloblastic anemia, fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, thrombocytopenia, blunted WBC production and response, mood changes and impaired fetal growth as well as neural tube defects are signs and symptoms of deficiency. There is no known folate toxicity. Serum folate status reflects dietary intake whereas RBC levels reflect whole body stores. Recently there has been interest generated in folate supplementation in individuals with CF related to 1 methyl metabolic pathways in which supplementation with 5-methyl tetrahydrofolic acid + vitamin B 12 have been shown to decrease homocysteine levels and alter RBC phospholipid fatty acid profiles and reduce RBC membrane oxidative damage (1). B 6 background: Vitamin B 6 encompasses the pyridoxine family of compounds, involved in protein, lipid, neurotransmitter and RBC synthesis and function. Potatoes, bananas, lentils and spinach are good dietary sources. Skin lesions (perioral, periaural and genital), fissured corners of the mouth, lips, purplish tongue, anemia, impaired leukocyte function, reduced antibody production, mood changes, headaches, sleep disturbances, abnormal brain wave abnormalities, muscle twitching, tingling in the hands and feet, difficulty walking, seizures, and dyslipidemias are findings in deficiency states. Long term intakes of >1000 mg/day may increase risk for peripheral neuropathy. Most commonly status is measured as plasma B 6 or as pyridoxal-5-phosphate (active form); low levels of this active form have been reported in children with CF (2). B 12 background: Vitamin B 12 encompass the cobalamins, which are involved in 1-methyl metabolism DNA synthesis, and in the activation of folate to tetrahydrofolate (active form), fat metabolism, DNA and myelin synthesis, and act as antioxidants to maintain reduced glutathione. Animal protein is a good dietary source; vegetarian diets increase risk of deficiency. There are several perturbations in the digestive and absorptive mechanisms for B 12 in individuals in CF, and the Schilling test is frequently abnormal in patients with CF, which should indicate deficiency. However, B 12 deficiency is not common in the CF population. Atrophy of the digestive tract, megaloblastic anemia, weakness, shortness of breath, thrombocytopenia, blunted WBC development and response, mood changes with hallucinations, paranoid behavior, tingling in hands/feet, sensory loss, unsteady gait, muscle coordination issues are reported in deficiency states. There is no known toxicity. Serum B 12 levels are the most commonly measured lab test to determine status.

They enroll patients most likely to benefit from the new therapy and attempt to maximize the likelihood that the therapy is used correctly in order to provide evidence of biological activity. When, as has usually been the case in CF, there is no pre-existing proven therapy, RCTs are performed with placebo controls but when an efficacious therapy already exists, the performance of a placebo-controlled trial is ethically problematic. Alternative approaches, which are distinguished primarily by their statistical analyses and power calculations, are superiority trials (which are done to establish that a new therapy is superior to the established one, and are analyzed in the same way as placebo-controlled trials); equivalence trials, which aim to determine that a new intervention is therapeutically similar to another by predefining a range of difference in outcomes that would be considered equivalent; and, most commonly, noninferiority trials, which determine if a new treatment is similar to or better than an existing one, requiring the new one to perform within a limited predefined range of inferiority. The rationale for performing equivalency and noninferiority trials is that the new drug has some other advantage, e.g., fewer side effects, greater ease of administration, or lower cost 5 .",

            "text": "From a health policy standpoint, an interest in comparing the cost of care is intrinsic to the current interest in comparing effectiveness 6 . It is easy to justify the use of treatments that are more effective clinically when they are also less expensive, or even when they are equal in costs, but real-world relative cost calculations are often quite complex. Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is a form of economic analysis whose practitioners have developed formal analytic approaches to comparing the relative costs and outcomes of two or more courses of action 11 . These calculations involve using a number of assumptions regarding the estimation of costs and outcomes and how these can be extrapolated across different populations. These assumptions and other methodologic issues need to be stated explicitly, and a sensitivity analysis, which examines the impact of variations in these assumptions from a statistical standpoint, should always be reported 12 . The results of a CEA are expressed in terms of an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) to evaluate relative benefit. The denominator is a gain in health from an intervention (years of life, premature births averted, etc.) and the numerator is the cost associated with the health gain. Cost-utility analysis (CUA) is a specialized form of CEA that incorporates a quality of life component associated with morbidity to calculate relative indices such as disability-adjusted life years or, most commonly, quality-adjusted life years (QALY) to use in the denominator. QALYs are normally calculated using utility-derived quality of life measures that have been specifically designed for this purpose from surveys of the general population, such as EQ-5D and the SF-6D 13 ; CFQ-R was not designed to be used for this purpose. CUA allows comparison across different health programs and policies by using a common unit of measure, cost/QALY, but the calculation of QALY and use of CUA is controversial. On the one hand, applications for approval of new drugs in the UK are required by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) to be accompanied by a CUA that calculates ICER using QALY. In the U.S., the Patient Protection and Affordability and Care Act explicitly prohibits the use of QALY as a tool for establishing what type of health care is cost effective or recommended 14 .",

Overview: This study investigates the effect of socioeconomic status (SES) on outcomes in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) in the UK and Denmark. People with CF from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds die younger than those in more advantaged social positions in the UK and the U.S. The key challenge is to understand how and when these inequalities develop, in order to identify promising options for intervention.

In order to develop more effective interventions we need a better understanding of how these health differences are generated and maintained.

Furthermore O'Connor et al report a stepped social gradient in %FEV1 and weight centile, with an absolute difference of 5.5% between highest and lowest income quintiles in the under 18 age group [7] . A key issue is the role of the healthcare system in mitigating or perpetuating inequalities in CF. Michael Schechter's studies from the U.S. have shown mixed patterns of access to treatment by SES [10, 11] . Young people on Medicaid appear more likely to access care (sick hospital visits, chronic therapies and IV antibiotics). Children living in low-income areas are more likely to receive oral nutritional supplementation, but less likely to receive macrolide therapy, and IV antibiotics. The authors conclude that inequalities in CF outcomes are not explained by differences in healthcare or chronic therapy use. In their study of the effect of socioeconomic status on hospitalisation rates in CF in Ontario Stephenson et al suggest that the provision of universal healthcare in Canada may explain the lack of a socioeconomic differential in hospitalisations [12] .",

The Danish dataset was linked to population level registers in order to collect individual level socioeconomic data, on patients and their parents (e.g., employment, income, healthcare expenditure). In both countries we explored the effects of socioeconomic status measures on key clinical outcomes (%FEV1, growth and nutritional measures), healthcare use (access to care, use of chronic therapies), and social outcomes (employment and educational outcomes). The analyses employed longitudinal data modelling techniques to examine changes in outcomes over time in groups and individuals whilst allowing for correlation within patients, and potentially informative missing values [13, 14] .",

In addition, in 2012 there has been an increase in callers who indicate they have failed to fill a prescription for medication or failed to attend a CF care center visit because they were not able to afford the co-pay for such medication or treatment. Often callers indicated they had no information on available programs that could assist them with their financial issues.",

The CF Social Security Project allows attorneys to represent people with CF for free in an initial application for Social Security disability benefits or Supplemental Security Income benefits. The Project is a case management project funded by the CF Patient Assistance Foundation. Once the Social Security benefit application is approved the person with CF becomes eligible for Medicaid benefits immediately or Medicare benefits after a 29 month waiting period is met. Those waiting for Medicare can use their monthly cash benefit to pay for COBRA benefits which last until Medicare eligibility begins. The CF Social Security Project has successfully obtained benefits for over 650 children and adults with CF between March 2010 and May 2012. Clients surveyed who had restricted access to medication and treatment or no coverage at all before obtaining government benefits reported that they were able to access medication and treatment without much if any cost share once they became eligible for government benefits.",

Five prospective, randomized placebo controlled trials have shown beneficial effects on both FEV1 and frequency of exacerbations. However, the consistent improvement in respiratory function after 6 months of therapy has not been demonstrated for extended periods of time. Data reported by Equi show the maximum increase in pulmonary function at 6 months and a decline in efficacy over 1 year, with a tendency towards equivalence between azithromycin and placebo (1). In a trial by Saiman with Pseudomonas aeruginosa uninfected patients, the difference in FEV1 was not statistically significant (2) . The long-term efficacy of azithromicin urgently needs to be investigated. A retrospective study of Tramper-Stranders et al demonstrated an increase in FEV1 in the first year, but a decline in the following three years (3) . Recently, Wilms et al retrospectively studied 74 patients with cystic fibrosis, who were chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and who started azithromycin maintenance treatment between 1998 and 2005 (4). Mean duration of follow-up after start of azithromycin was 7.6 years. One year after start FEV1 was + 1.71% compared to baseline, after 18 months + 0.78% and after 24 months FEV1 was back to baseline (-0.19%). During the following years mean annual change in FEV1 was -2.26%. These data suggest that initiation of azithromycin therapy is associated with only temporary improvements in pulmonary function.",

There is extensive evidence that treatment for more than 6-12 months does more harm than good to these patients. CF lung disease starts early: When a child with cystic fibrosis (CF) is born the lungs show a normal structure. Chronic inflammation and infection occur early in life and contribute to progressive structural lung damage that ultimately leads to respiratory failure. The most important components of structural lung disease in CF are bronchiectasis (BE) -an irreversible widening of airways -and small airways disease. Treatment should start at an early stage with the aim to prevent any irreversible damage from occurring. We, as clinicians, should have zero tolerance with regards to progression of the disease! Therefore, both clinicians and patients need accurate and sensitive measures of the severity of BE and small airways disease so that action can be taken when needed and the effectiveness of interventions can be assessed.",

Unfortunately, we do not have adequate prediction models to identify patients at risk of developing progressive disease. Models using validated bio-markers are needed to personalize treatment and monitoring. Until we have such models we need to use sensitive and accurate tools to determine the current disease status in order to tailor treatment to the needs of the patient. Progression of BE needs to be diagnosed as early as possible since it cannot be reversed and progression needs to be avoided. Currently, chest CT is the gold standard to detect and monitor BE and trapped air. Symptoms, pulmonary function tests (PFT), and chest X-ray (CXR) are not sufficiently sensitive to diagnose and monitor BE. To evaluate the status of CF lung disease using only these insensitive techniques is no better than flipping a coin. \"Heads or tails? What's your call?\" -is that the way you like to practice medicine? Bronchiectasis cannot be diagnosed by functional tests: Spirometry and other PFTs have never been the gold standard to diagnose BE. PFTs at best tell you that something is wrong with the lungs but not what structural changes are causing these functional changes. Changes in various PFT variables are associated with structural changes. Spirometry served its purpose as a surrogate test to monitor CF lung disease at a time when patients were losing on average 10% of function per year and we had few therapies to stop this progression. Fortunately, prognosis has improved substantially and we have a wide array of potential treatments to pick from. Decline in spirometric indices are, on average, below one percent per year which is well within the noise range of spirometry. Does this mean CF lung disease is stable? Unfortunately not, it was shown that spirometry is just not sensi-tive enough to inform us adequately about the presence or progression of BE (2, 3) . Evaluating progression of CF lung disease only based on PFTs and or CXR is like driving blindfolded. Not a good idea! Chest CT is the best: Unfortunately, CXR is not sensitive to detect, and monitor the most important components of CF lung disease in individual patients. The reasons for this are simple. First, a CXR is a two dimensional representation of a complex 3 dimensional structure making accurate identification of structural abnormalities very difficult. A CXR at best tells you something is wrong with the lung but not what. Second, It has been recognized -since 1945 -that about one third of the lung volume cannot be evaluated using CXR because it is hidden behind the heart and domes of the diaphragm (4). Chest CT has emerged in the early nineties as the gold standard to diagnose BE (5). Chest CT is superior to CXR for detecting and monitoring structural abnormalities in CF patients in early and advanced disease (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . Chest magnetic resonance imaging is a promising alternative for chest CT but currently inferior to chest CT for detecting early disease and accurately monitoring progression (12) . CT is the only method that can detect and measure progression of structural lung disease in infants. Hence, to diagnose and monitor CF lung disease, chest CT is the current gold standard -why wouldn't one use it?",

On the other hand, it appears that children with CF are at higher risk for malignancies than the general population (15) . More recently, it has been reported that an extra case of leukemia will develop per 10,000 CT scans performed in children in the general population (16) . In a response widely covered in the lay press, the Alliance for Radiation Safety in Pediatric Imaging encouraged parents to ask several questions when their child's physician recommends a CT scan. We can use our answers to two of these questions to assess whether routine chest CT scans should be recommended.",

The answer to this question must be left to the treating physician, as there is no evidence that the use of chest CT scans has affected lung disease progression in children with CF (14) . Additionally, comparisons with PET scans have revealed that CT scans cannot reliably differentiate between localized active infection/inflammation and residual abnormalities (17) . Routine CT scans would logically provide the most information when lung disease is in its early stages, as once lung disease progression has advanced, spirometry, symptoms, and chest radiography can more easily detect changes in disease status (18) . However, most reports of chest CT scan abnormalities in CF have been in older children and adults, meaning there is little standardization of imaging protocols to guide individual radiologists (18) . Finally, to truly maximize the utility of chest CT, quantitative scoring is required. However, scoring protocols are not widespread or standardized, meaning that interpretations will have considerable variability, especially for radiologists not familiar with CF lung disease.",

Multiple risk factors for lung disease progression have been identified which can guide clinicians in being more or less aggressive in adding new therapies. The presence of mucoid P. aeruginosa alone has been shown to be asso-ciated with the presence of bronchiectasis on chest CT (19) . Chest CT scans are considered the gold standard of structural lung disease, but chest radiography has been shown to be sensitive in detecting concurrent chest CT abnormalities across childhood and adolescence (20) , and as strongly associated with future lung disease progression as chest CT scores (9) . This information can be obtained longitudinally with a fraction of the ionizing radiation. LCI may also be used to detect early functional abnormalities, and LCI has been shown to correlate with chest CT scans and future lung disease severity in young children diagnosed after newborn screening (6) . Finally, recent improvements in MRI technology make it possible to identify structural lung disease with nearly the precision as chest CT; MRI scans have the added benefit of not exposing patients to ionizing radiation and may be used to evaluate functional abnormalities (e.g., regional air trapping, mucociliary clearance) (21) . One of the main advantages of chest CT over chest radiography and spirometry is that small areas of localized structural disease can be identified (12) . However, there is no evidence that directing care against localized structural disease is more effective than treatments directed against modalities that measure averaged disease levels (e.g., LCI, spirometry).",

There is insufficient evidence to guide clinicians' response to chest CT abnormalities, and there are (or soon will be) sufficient alternatives to chest CT, especially in the young child with mild lung disease who may be especially sensitive to ionizing radiation and for whom appropriate CT scanning protocols are poorly defined. Children with CF who are at high risk for CT abnormalities and/or future lung disease progression can be identified without the use of chest CT. Chest CT should continue to be used as recommended by Borowitz et al: CT scans \"may be helpful in infants with symptoms or signs of lung disease who fail to respond to basic interventions\" (22) . Filamentous fungi are inhaled routinely with each breath, as \"spores\" (or conidia), which are produced asexually by moulds that grow in environments that contain organic material. Some organisms -Aspergillus species -and particularly, organisms within the A. fumigatus group, are well adapted to survive in human airways. If spores (conidia) survive in the airway, they can convert back into hyphal, or the filamentous forms of the fungus. This morphotype produces metabolites and products that serve to promote organism tolerance, survival, and polarized growth, such as proteases and other toxins [1] . Recent studies have actually documented that we have different immunologic mechanisms to distinguish between the different forms of the fungus, with conidia being phagocytosed and cleared by both airway epithelia and professional phagocytes without evoking much of an inflammatory response; in contrast, hyphal components evoke production of numerous inflammatory mediators and cellular recruitment through recognition of different cell wall components, such as beta-glucan [2] [3] [4] [5] . Thus, A. fumigatus is one organism that grows as different cell types, and our bodies are well adapted for distinguishing between the two morphologic states.",

Going a step further, we recently demonstrated that epithelial cells (EC) harboring CF mutations demonstrated impaired uptake and killing of conidia, and ECs with CFTR mutation undergo more conidial-induced apoptosis [5] . Germinated (hyphal) forms of the fungus evoke secretion of inflammatory mediators, with CFTR mutation resulting in increased airway levels of macrophage inflammatory protein 2 and KC, and higher lung monocyte chemotactic protein-1. After A. fumigatus inhalation, CFTR-/-mice developed exaggerated lymphocytic inflammation, mucin accumulation, and lung injury. These data definitively demonstrate a critical role for CFTR in mediating EC responses to A. fumigatus, and suggest that the fungus itself elicits aberrant pulmonary inflammation in the setting of CFTR mutation.",

This observation taken further would suggest that treatment of airway \"colonization\" will have a protective effect, much similar to that of treating P. aeruginosa. However, we have not yet shown this in clinical trials. One small placebo-controlled study evaluating itraconazole did not show a benefit; unfortunately, this drug is not well absorbed in this setting, reaches poor levels in the airways, and the study did not enroll enough people to show a treatment effect [9] . Thus, it may be considered a negative pilot study that suggests the need for more investigation. In vitro, in vivo, and epidemiologic studies suggest that antifungal therapy may benefit people with Aspergillus recovered from sputum, even in the absence of ABPA; a definitive clinical trial is necessary to define the optimal therapeutic strategy. As the CF population ages, and as intensive antibiotic suppressive therapy for bacterial infection becomes more common, the incidence and prevalence of A. fumigatus infection is increasing.

Determining whether fungus may be playing a pathogenic role in addition to bacteria is almost impossible. Thus the current standard of care amongst CF centers is to forgo antifungal treatment in CF patients who culture A. fumigatus in sputum but who do not have ABPA (16) . However to date, no prospective experimental studies have addressed the question of whether treating Aspergillus in patients with cystic fibrosis, without ABPA, could improve clinical outcomes. Clearly, if treatment of Aspergillus cultured from airway secretions results in improved clinical outcomes compared to a control group that did not receive treatment, then this would indirectly suggest that A. fumigatus is acting as a pathogen in the airways and is causing morbidity. We therefore conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial to determine if 24 weeks of treatment with the oral antifungal agent itraconazole improved clinical outcomes in CF patients whose sputum was chronically colonized with A. fumigatus. Thirty-five patients with CF whose sputum cultures were chronically positive for A. fumigatus were centrally randomized to receive either oral itraconazole 5 mg/kg/d (N = 18) or placebo (N=17) for a 24 week treatment period (17) .",

The most obvious explanation may be that A. fumigatus, although often isolated from the sputum of patients with CF, may not play a pathogenic role in CF patients who do not have ABPA. If A. fumigatus is simply a colonizer of the CF airway, rather than an infecting organism causing tissue injury and inflammation, then treatment of this organism would not be expected to provide clinical benefits. To date, studies in CF patients are inconclusive as to whether A. fumigatus is causing infection in these patients, and while it cannot be excluded that individual patients may benefit from therapy, our current study would suggest that treatment of this organism on the basis of sputum isolation alone is not indicated in CF patients. The genetic diversity in the CFTR gene is described in one of three ways: 1) as a clinical case report or case series; 2) as an inventory from labs performing genetic testing; or 3) as a summary report from a particular CF center or geographic region. Projects such as the HapMap and 1000 genomes have begun to catalog diversity across the genome in ostensibly healthy populations. A comparison of the relative frequency of mutations seen in CF patients with the frequency of mutations seen in the general population provides the basis for a case-control study, however there are several problems to consider. First, the mutations seen in CF patients are not uniform throughout the world. It has been well characterized that the incidence of c.1521_1523delCTT (legacy named F508del) in CF patients is greatest in northwestern Europe and declines as you move south and east across the continent. Second, CF is not a uniform disease. There is increasing recognition of atypical cases of CF, CF cases diagnosed in adulthood, and of CFTR related diseases in which there is organ dysfunction related to CFTR mutation that does not meet the diagnostic criteria for CF. Third, variance found in the general (presumably healthy) population represents both neutral CFTR mutations (polymorphisms) as well as disease-causing mutations that may be present in CF carriers. Finally, the large number of CFTR mutations (more than 1900) and the fact that many are very rare means the scale of such a case-control comparison must be enormous. These problems (as well as other inherent biases of a case-control study) make it challenging to sort mutations into CFcausing vs neutral on the basis of population or prevalence data alone. Importantly, this translates to a difficulty using what has been learned about the genetic epidemiology of CF in general to any given genetically unique population.",

There were 6 of the 122 CF-causing mutations that were only seen in Europe and not in North America. Many other mutations in the CFTR2 database unique or more common to Europe have unknown or variable clinical significance.",

For the entire CFTR2 database, the extent of genetic testing done on patients is not known. The CFTR2 project is actively seeking data from countries where the population with CF may be smaller, but may be enriched for rare mutations. This information will aid the CF community by expanding the list of CF-causing mutations. However, quantitative assessments of allele frequency worldwide or in a specific population will require great expansion of publicly available databases of genetic variation of the general population, as well as more comprehensive genetic analysis of CF patients. Therefore, specific recommendation on which mutations to test for in diagnosis and screening scenarios are best considered in view of local prevalence and testing objectives.",

Durie, M.D., FRCP(C) 1 The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) is usually straightforward in the presence of a typical phenotype and sweat chloride concentration exceeding 60 mmol/L. However, since the discovery of the CFTR gene, a spectrum of conditions associated with CFTR mutations has become recognized, particularly in adolescents and adults presenting with sino-pulmonary diseases, pancreatitis and in men with infertility due to obstructive azoospermia. In fact, different mutations in the CFTR gene give rise to a spectrum of ion channel abnormalities, which together with the influence of non-CF modifier genes and environmental factors result in a heterogeneous spectrum of phenotypes in the various organs affected by CF disease. The term \"CFTR-related disorder\" is used to define symptomatic individuals who are affected by CFTR dysfunction but do not fulfill the current criteria for CF disease. Furthermore, following worldwide acceptance of newborn screening (NBS) for CF disease, a subset of asymptomatic infants is identified with an equivocal diagnosis. Thus the diagnosis of CF may be difficult to establish or exclude in a subset of individuals at the extremes of age.",

In these circumstances, CFTR sequencing is of limited value and the results of ion channel testing may be equivocal and/or discordant. In such circumstances, integration of ion channel measurements by PCA may assist in the diagnostic assessment of patients with an equivocal diagnosis of CF. The California newborn screening program for CF began in July 2007. California's program conducts 40-mutation panel testing of blood spots found to have immunoreactive trypsinogen levels of 62 ng/mL or higher (top 1.5%). When a single mutation (as opposed to zero or two) is found by the panel (in 5.7% of hypertrypsinogenemic newborns, or 0.088% of all newborns), the blood spot is further tested for the presence of other mutations using DNA sequencing. A second non-panel CFTR mutation -defined broadly at the beginning of the program as a 5T variant (any TG Tract), novel variant, mutation associated with CFTR-related disorders (e.g., pancreatitis, male infertility) or other known CF-causing mutation -has been found in 36% of spots sequenced. Parents of newborns with one mutation are offered telephone genetic counseling. Newborns with two or more CFTR mutations are referred to CF centers for follow up. Follow up includes physical examination and sweat chloride, fecal elastase and other testing. When initial signs and symptoms of CF are not present and the mutation phase is unknown, focused parent testing is offered and the cost of genotyping borne by the screening program. When such newborns are found to be carriers, follow up ceases. When mutations are found to be in trans, then newborns continue to be followed up for at least one year with CF centers, regardless of initial or repeat sweat chloride results. The combination of California's (a) diverse population, (b) screening algorithm with comprehensive genotyping, (c) web-based screening information system to collect diagnoses, test results and clinical information, and (d) collaboratively-developed guidelines for CF center follow up of screen positive newborns has made it possible to examine the natural history of CFTR mutations from early in life in a population-based cohort of hypertrypsinogenemic newborns.",

However, since new mutations are being found at a high rate by the California program and by others worldwide, especially in non-White groups, there will continue to be a lag in our ability to delineate between mutations that are likely to cause CF, another CFTR-related disorder, or no disease at all. Of the close to 2000 mutations already documented, it is certain that more than the current ACMG-23 mutations are CF-caus-ing. Newborn screening and long-term follow-up will be critical in developing this knowledge base in the future. The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) in adulthood is nearly always precipitated by the presence of one or more characteristic clinical symptoms. In the absence of the diagnosis, patients are often subjected to extensive diagnostic procedures to rule-out other syndromes, and receive fragmented care focused primarily on reducing symptoms without a clear understanding of their underlying pathophysiology. Establishment of the CF diagnosis can result in a rational multisystem approach to care that is more firmly evidenced based, and can eliminate the need for additional diagnostic procedures and subspecialty consultations. The CF diagnosis also allows access to high quality CF centers, and an ever-expanding formulary of medications and therapies not generally available to non-CF patients. Although adult diagnosed patients have significant morbidity, they demonstrate a sustained response to standard CF center care, and can achieve a near normal lifespan (1) .",

FEV 1 values from all clinic visits between 1992 and 2007 (n=35,128) captured in the CFF Registry for patients over 40 years demonstrated that while AD patients have a significantly higher FEV 1 at age 40 years (57.9+3.0%) compared with CD patients (50.0+3.1%; P<0.01), the annual age-related FEV 1 decline after age 40 was not different between the two cohorts (CD, -0.50+0.07% vs. AD, -0.36+0.07%; P=0.19) (1). As expected, median AD survival greatly exceeded CD survival (1) . For patients in the Colorado database who survived past age 40 years, the median CD cohort survival was 51.7 years, versus 76.9 years for the AD cohort (P<0.0001). For patients in the CFF Registry database, the median survival for the CD cohort was 53.5 years, versus 68.2 years for the AD cohort (P<0.0001). However, despite a significantly longer life span, the frequency of death from respiratory failure or transplantation-related complications was 85% for AD, compared to 87% for CD (1) .",

AD patients treated at CF care centers demonstrate sustained improvement in FEV 1 , and report a high level of satisfaction with their care. Yet barriers exist that result in a low rate of attendance at CF centers and thus underrepresentation in the CFF Patient Registry. When the clinical consequence of adult diagnosed CF is viewed over the lifetime of the patient, it is apparent that the pulmonary manifestations are not a mild form of the disease, but rather a delayed but equally serious form of the childhood presentation. Thus when diagnosis and treatment are delayed, the morbidity of nonclassic CF can be unnecessarily severe. Although previously regarded as medical curiosities, AD patients represent an important and growing segment of the CF population that deserves increased study (6) .",

CF patients experience episodic worsening of symptoms commonly referred to as pulmonary exacerbations. Although a standardized definition of a pulmonary exacerbation is lacking, clinical features may include increased cough, increased sputum production, shortness of breath, chest pain, loss of appetite, loss of weight, and lung function decline (1). In school age children, adolescents and adults, pulmonary exacerbations have been shown to adversely impact quality of life (2) and are a major contributor to the cost of care (3). Despite current interventions, they can be associated with irreversible loss of lung function (4) and predict poorer survival (5) . Thus, prevention of exacerbations is of great interest, and time to first exacerbation or exacerbations rate have been common clinical trial endpoints in trials of chronic maintenance therapies enrolling CF patients over 6 years of age (6) (7) (8) . Pulmonary exacerbation is a clinical endpoint defined as affecting how a person feels, functions or survives, that complements surrogate endpoints such as lung function (9) .",

Essentially all of the experience with the use of pulmonary exacerbation as an endpoint in CF clinical trials comes from patients >6 years of age with established lung disease, in whom the goal is to reverse or slow the progression of existing pathology. Pulmonary exacerbations in young children with milder structural airway damage are likely to be quite different. In children with CF <6 years of age, there is a much higher prevalence of viral respiratory infections and lower rates of chronic endobronchial infection, particularly with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Furthermore, treat-ment of exacerbations is different, with a greater prevalence of oral or inhaled antibiotics and lower prevalence of intravenous antibiotics. The long-term sequelae of pulmonary exacerbations in children <6 in terms of effects on quality of life, lung function and survival are poorly understood. Thus, the impact of pulmonary exacerbations as a clinical trial endpoint in young children with CF will evolve as our understanding of the pathophysiology and outcomes of these exacerbations improves.

At present, assessments of infants and of children over age 6 in research protocols often rely on pulmonary function testing, and, to a much lesser extent, have involved computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest. For children from age 2 to 6, PFT assessments are challenging and rarely used in clinical research protocols. CT scans offer an opportunity to assess lung disease status in this age group. Of note, CT scans of the chest have been shown to be more sensitive to intercurrent changes in lung disease than PFTs; however, little data are available in children ages 2 to 6. As part of an NIH-funded, multi-site, randomized clinical trial of behavior and nutrition treatment for toddlers and preschoolers with CF, an ancillary study (funded by the CF Foundation) using CT scans of the chest was completed. The ancillary study afforded the opportunity to obtain CT data at baseline and 18 months later, providing what is to our knowledge, the first longitudinal CT scan data set of patients with CF in this age range. During this workshop, we will present information related to training the study radiologists on the CT scoring system and the protocol followed during the actual, blinded scoring of the scans obtained in this study. Future work will involve assessment of inter-rater reliability across the study radiologists and determination of lung disease status, as well as any change over time, for the sample of toddlers and preschoolers who completed the project.",

The presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has also been shown to be associated with diminished lung function measured from infancy through the preschool age group (7,13) and decline over time in infants (11) . Despite these associations causality cannot be inferred from the available data and lower airway infections may simply be a marker of early disease rather than the etiology of these abnormal physiologic findings.

In a retrospective study of 10 CF infants, forced expiratory flows and lung volumes significantly improved after an antibiotic course for a pulmonary exacerbation (16) . Recently, the change in FEV 0.5 when adjusted for baseline lung function, height, weight, gender and age was reported to be significantly greater in 22 infants treated with 7% hypertonic saline for 1 year compared to 23 infants treated with isotonic saline for 1 year (4). More data are needed to evaluate the efficacy of using infant and preschool lung function testing as an endpoint in a therapeutic trial, but these initial results are encouraging and indicate that studies using infant lung function as an outcome measure are feasible.",

            "text": "In conclusion, recent advancements in infant and preschool lung function testing highlight the potential applicability of these physiologic measures as validated endpoints for therapeutic trials. With the advent of newborn screening and novel therapeutics such as ivacaftor, defining and validating these tools has become more important than in past decades. International infant and preschool lung function trials are likely forthcoming, thereby highlighting the importance of standard operating procedures and standardized equipment. As we enter this new era of CF care, it is likely that infant and preschool lung function testing coupled with other endpoints such as imaging and measures of ventilation inhomogeneity will better define this early \"silent\" disease. Lung disease in CF has been demonstrated to start early in infancy, but is not necessarily associated with significant clinical signs and symptoms. Quantifying and tracking early lung disease with sensitive markers has become an area of significant interest both for clinical care and to enable early intervention trials in infants and young children. Early lung disease is focal and charac-terized by mucus plugging and air trapping which may not be captured by global measures of airflow obstruction. Multiple breath washout (MBW) derived measures of lung function such as the lung clearance index (LCI) have been shown to be abnormal in a high percentage of CF patients with normal spirometry and LCI in preschool children predicts future lung function (1, 2) . We have per-formed two interventional studies to date in school age children to assess the ability of MCI to detect a treatment of interventions known to be beneficial for CF patients: hypertonic saline and dornase alfa (3, 4) . Both studies were conducted as double blind randomized controlled trials in a crossover design with intervention periods of 4 weeks in CF patients with an FEV1 of 80% predicted or above and demonstrated significant improvements in LCI that were not detected using FEV1 as an outcome measure. Recently, a third study with ivacaftor in patients carrying at least one allele of a G551D mutation was performed as the first interventional study with LCI as the primary outcome measure in a multicenter setting (5). This study used a similar crossover design and included patients with an FEV1 of at least 90% predicted. Results support the concept that LCI is more sensitive than FEV1 with a treatment effect size that exceeded that of the previous studies with hypertonic saline and dornase alfa.",

Twenty-four of 26 (92%) of the subjects recruited at the Toronto site had paired baseline and follow-up measures at one year. There was a significant reduction in LCI from baseline to follow-up in the hypertonic saline arm; while LCI remained stable in the isotonic saline group. This change was primarily driven by changes in the preschool children. Infants treated with hypertonic saline LCI did not change, where it increased significantly in the isotonic saline group. While the treatment effect was not significant in the overall group (p=0.08), the effect size was higher than in the previously performed short term study in older children (3) .

            "text": "One of the challenges of moving MBW technology forward as an outcome measure is the lack of standardized equipment. Mass spectrometry based technology using SF 6 as a tracer gas is considered the \"gold standard\" for measuring LCI, but is only available in a few centers around the world. In an effort to validate a nitrogen based multiple breath washout system, we recently studied 60 healthy children and 60 children with CF on both technologies. We found LCI measured by nitrogen washout to be higher compared with mass spectrometry, but no systematic bias was observed in the differences between these two systems. This difference in LCI between the two MBW systems was more pronounced in CF compared to healthy children and not associated with weight-for-age or height-for-age centiles. However, when compared to FEV1 (percent predicted), the difference between the two systems was greatest for lower values of FEV1. These results suggest that LCI measured by the nitrogen system is more sensitive at detecting lung abnormalities than SF 6 based measurements in children with CF. The data demonstrate the validity of the nitrogen washout system for LCI measurement in school age children and form the basis for subsequent validation studies in preschool children.",

            "text": "While LCI is the main parameter measured by multiple breath washout in CF lung disease to date, it is affected by changes in breathing pattern which may impact on test variability especially in infants and young children. Moment analysis of MBW parameters assesses the shape (skewness) of the washout curve and has been shown to be less affected by variability in breathing frequency or tidal volume. Moment analysis is performed by setting the starting gas concentration at 100% and by plotting end-tidal gas concentrations against the number of lung turnovers (FRCs). Moment 0 is the area under this curve while moments 1 and 2 represent single and double multiplications with the number of lung turnovers. Results are then expressed as moment ratios (M1/M0 and M2/M0) with higher moment ratios being more reflective of ventilation inhomogeneity (VI) in the periphery of the lung. We used two data sets to assess the potential of moment ratio analysis to quantify VI in CF patients. First, we assessed the sensitivity of moment ratios compared to LCI to differentiate health and disease in a cross-sectional validation study of LCI equipment in both healthy and CF children. Subsequently, we reanalysed data from a recently conducted interventional trial (3) to investigate whether moment ratios were able to detect treatment effects of hypertonic saline similar to LCI. In the cross-sectional study comparing health to disease, both LCI the first moment ration were approximately 7 z-scores higher in CF compared with healthy children, whereas the second moment ratio was 12 zscores higher, suggesting greater sensitivity for this parameter compared to LCI. In the interventional crossover trial on hypertonic saline, treatment effects were observed for both moment ratios. These findings suggest that moment ratios may provide a complementary outcome to the LCI in clinical trials that should be further explored in the future.",

Patients with chronic PA infection suffer frequent disease flares known as pulmonary exacerbations where increased lung inflammation and injury produce worsening pulmonary function, and marked respiratory and systemic symptoms. While some flares produce only transient illness and symptoms, one out of four results in permanent lung function decline. Over time, the cumulative effect of these flares is respiratory failure and death, with median CF patient survival 35-40 years. Unfortunately, the mechanisms that produce exacerbations remain unknown, and new treatments that could mitigate or slow lung function decline have been difficult to develop.",

Blackwell, M.A. 3 and David Barker, Ph.D. 4Numerous studies have demonstrated that patients with chronic illnesses are at increased risk for depression and anxiety(Katon & Ciechanowski, 2002). In large, well-controlled epidemiological studies, rates of depression in medical populations have ranged from 17% to 50% compared to 5% to17.5% in healthy populations (Hermann, 1997; Riolo et al., 2005; Wells, Golding, & Burnam, 1988). In a community sample, Wells and colleagues concluded that there was a 41% increase in relative risk of having a psychiatric disorder as a function of having a chronic medical condition. Why do mental health issues need to be addressed in patients with chronic conditions? Depression and anxiety have been shown to have direct and indirect consequences on disease managements. Patients with a variety of medical conditions, who are also depressed, have been shown to be less adherent, are less likely to follow dietary recommendations, are more likely to cancel or miss clinic appointments, report worse functioning on several quality of life domains, and have increased health care utilization and higher health care costs (DiMatteo, Lepper, & Croghan, 2000; Katon & Ciecxhanowski, 2002; Sherbourne et al., 1996).",

While in vitro data has suggested that azithromycin may reduce effective autophagy (normal cellular process by which damaged organelles and unused proteins are sequestered and intracellular pathogens -including M. abscessus -are killed), the clinical relevance of this observation is unknown and requires additional study [8] . As expected, resistance to macrolide agents did occur; when compared with placebo participants, azithromycin participants had 27% more macrolide-resistant S. aureus and 7% more macrolideresistant H. influenzae [5] . However, numerous other agents are available for treatment of macrolide resistant bacteria in CF patients [9] . No macrolide resistant NTM were detected [3, 5] .Mechanisms of Action: While the mechanism of action of azithromycin in CF is not fully understood, increasing evidence suggests it is functioning as an antiinflammatory agent. In the clinical trials in which inflammatory markers were studies, azithromcyin was associated with reductions in C-reactive protein (CRP) [1] , neutrophil elastase [3] , and most recently with sustained reductions in absolute neutrophil counts, high sensitivity CRP, calprotectin, myeloperoxidase, and serum amyloid A [5, 10] . In this most recent study, reductions in calprotectin and CRP were significantly correlated with improved lung function and weight gain [10] .Thus, azithromycin currently represents the safest anti-inflammatory agent for CF. While associated with improvements in lung function, steroids were associated with decreased growth and cataracts in children with CF [11] . Similarly, while ibuprofen was associated with improvements in lung function, concerns regarding the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and the complexities of measuring serum levels have substantially curtailed the use of this agent [12] .Evidence-based Recommendations for Use of Azithromycin in CF: Evidence-based guidelines developed by the U.S. CF Foundation have recommended that azithromcyin be used in CF patients 6 years of age and older chronically infected with P. aeruginosa to improve lung function and reduce exacerbations [13] . An updated recommendation that includes the use of azithromycin in CF patients uninfected with P. aeruginosa is pending. Similarly, a Cochrane review conducted by Southern et al. concluded that azithromycin improved respiratory function after 6 months and was associated with a reduction in exacerbations [14] . Thus, evidence-based recommendations consistently recommend the chronic use of azithromycin for patients with CF due to clinical benefits and a favorable safety and tolerability profile.Study Radiologist Training on Scoring System: Two radiologists independently scored 10 Training CT Scans on a lobe specific basis. Each lobe, with the lingula scored as a separate lobe, was evaluated for the extent and severity of bronchiectasis, mucous plugging, peribronchical thickening, parenchymal opacity, ground glass density, cysts or bullae, and air trapping. The scoring system was modified to include a visual analog scale with continuous variables ranging from 0.0 up to 10.0. Following the initial scoring the radiologists discussed all discrepancies and developed common criteria for areas of frequent discrepancies. Inter-rater reliability was assessed on the Training CT Scans using Pearson Correlation Coefficients and these data were used to assess areas in need of more calibration between the study radiologists. Scoring was then repeated by the two study radiologists several months later to again evaluate inter-rater reliability and further the training process of refining radiologist calibration. This completed the training phase of the project.",

            "text": "We wanted to take the information from the training process and use the Training CT Scans as a part of the Research Study Scoring protocol. To meet this goal, two sets of panels using a subset of the Training CT Scans were developed. This development process included a review by one radiologist and the study coordinator of the end results from the two training meetings. Specifically, individual scores of lung abnormalities that represented varying levels of agreement were identified. This resulted in two CT panels that included a set of scores that demonstrated a range of lung disease status and instances of scores that ranged from perfect agreement to large differences in ratings. At the end of this process, the research coordinator summarized individual lung disease abnormalities for all the scans within each panel and asked the two radiologists to consider all the information that came from the training process to then establish a consensus score for each abnormality. The consensus score would be used as the \"anchor\" rating and a panel would be reviewed at the beginning of each research study scan scoring session. In this way, the culmination of the training process resulted in a way to help the radiologists systematically calibrate with each other on a set of \"true anchor\" scores as they independently looked at blinded study scans.Protocol for Each Scoring Session: At each consecutive CT scoring session, a CT Scoring Panel was reviewed immediately prior to scoring the blinded, ran-domized research study scans. The radiologists reviewed each abnormality and came to an agreement on the score and communicated the consensus score to the research coordinator. The research coordinator then communicated consensus score back to the radiologists so re-calibration and consensus could be established. The average length of time to review one scoring panel was approximately 50 minutes. Following CT Scoring Panel review, blinded research study scans were independently scored by the two study radiologists.Scoring of Research CT Scans: A total of 11 scoring sessions took place over 27 months. On average, 8 research study scans were reviewed each session. The protocol that used the calibration process was well received by the study radiologists and allowed for a systematic, routine approach to each blinded research CT scan scoring session.Analysis of Research CT Scans: Now that the CT sub-study is complete, analysis has begun on the research data from 42 baseline CT scans and 40 follow-up CT scans. To date, data from one expert coder has been reviewed. Descriptive data from one coder includes the mean presence of bronchiectasis and air trapping, and average lobes with presence of bronchiectasis and air trapping at the baseline and 18 month (follow-up) time points for all participants.Research Results: Mean and SD age of participants at baseline CT scan was 3.67 (1.3) years and at follow-up (approximately 18 months later) was 5.33 (1.28) years. Percentage with presence of bronchiectasis at baseline (N = 42) was 52% and follow-up (N = 40) was 55%. Mean and SD for lobes with bronchiectasis at baseline (N = 40) was 1.25 (1.75) and follow-up (N = 38) was 1.10 (1.43). Percentage with presence of air trapping at baseline (N = 40) was 83% and follow-up (N = 38) was 82%. Mean and SD for lobes with air trapping at baseline (N = 40) was 2.72 (2.19) and follow-up (N = 37) was 2.97 (2.22) .Discussion: Next steps for analyzing the CT data include determining inter-rater reliability on the blinded, randomized research CT scans. Additionally, change scores of the important aspects of lung disease status in young children with CF will be analyzed. Examples of change scores from baseline to follow-up (18 months later) within subjects will be presented at the workshop and compared to existing data from other studies in the same age. Regional differences in lung disease will also be examined and presented.",
