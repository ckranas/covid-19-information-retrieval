Despite this, detailed information on the molecular nature of IgE-allergen interactions is still lacking for most important allergens. Method: IgE-derived antibody fragments specific for the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 were isolated from combinatorial libraries derived from the IgE-repertoires of nasal tissue of allergic donors. Their interactions with Bet v 1 were characterised using immunological assays. The structure of one of the IgE in single chain fragment variable (scFv) format was solved using X-ray crystallography. Results: We isolated four novel Bet v 1-specific IgE-derived antibody fragments with genetic origin in the IGHV5 germline gene, suggested to be overrepresented in some IgE repertoires. We show that that such antibodies, despite their limited diversity, are able to fulfill the basic criteria for FceRI cross-linkage by targeting two nonoverlapping epitopes. These previously undescribed IgE-reactive epitopes were further defined and a molecular basis for differential recognition of Bet v 1 isoforms and homologous allergens of the PR-10 family was identified by pinpointing important single amino acid residues within one of the epitopes. Further, we present the first highresolution structure of a human allergenspecific IgE in the scFv format, a structure that demonstrates that a human allergenspecific antigen binding site may display a protruding CDRH3. Conclusion: We here demonstrate the potential of local IgE repertoires with limited diversity in their genetic origin to fulfill the basic criteria for initiation of allergic responses. Further, the non-planar epitope targeted by MO418 and its protruding CDRH3 contrasts previous findings, suggesting IgE to favour planar epitopes, calling for further investigations of the nature of such epitopes.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Papain impairs the epidermal barrier and independent of its enzymatic activityexhibits strong allergenic potential via the skin Background: The cysteine protease papain from the peptidase C1 family is commonly used in food, pharmaceutical, textile and cosmetic industries although it is known to induce allergic reactions like occupational asthma.

Conclusion: Our data suggest that papain has strong allergenic potential via the skin, even when not being enzymatically active. 463 Chitin stimulates adaptive T cell response to inhalant allergens through natural killer T (NKT) cell sensitisation, 50 lg of OVA was challenged intranasally on day 14, 15, 21 and 22, and 24 h after last OVA challenge, mice were sacrificed for evaluation. Results: HDM-derived chitin induced airway inflammation and increased the expression of all cytokines of Th1, Th2, and Th17 as well as the serum level of OVA-specific IgE, IgG1, and IgG2a. In the absence of CD1d, the expression of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines and the serum level of OVA-specific IgE and IgG1 were alleviated, while the expression of Treg cytokines and the serum level of OVA-specific IgG2a were more enhanced. Conclusion: NKT cell has a key role in the development of Th1, Th2, and Th17 response to inhaled allergens induced by intranasally administered chitin. 464 Site-specific protection against cinnamaldehyde depends on its haptenous state in a mouse model of fragrance allergy Background: Cinnamon aldehyde (CA) represents an ubiquitous fragrance that may lead to type I and IV hypersensitivity via the skin or mucosal surfaces (lung, gut) . Here, we investigated whether the encounter of CA as a hapten or coupled to a carrier influences whether the organism responds allergic or tolerant. Methods: Cinnamaldehyde (CA) alone, or conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (CA-KLH) was applied nasally to mice six times on two consecutive days in biweekly intervals. Subsequently, ears were painted with cinnamaldehyde and ear swelling measured after 24 and 48 h. Mice were also challenged by oral gavage of 2 mg CA and body temperature was measured for 30 min. Cytokine profile of stimulated splenocytes as well as CA-specific antibodies and corticosterone levels were assessed by ELISA and EIA. Results: Only in mice sensitised with CA-KLH a specific immune response with CAspecific IgG1, IgE, IgG2a and IgA levels as well as elevated IFNc could be observed. CA-KLH sensitised mice also showed a sig-nificant ear swelling response to CA after 24 h. However, CA-KLH mice were protected from anaphylaxis upon oral challenge. In contrast, although no specific antibody and cytokine response could be detected in mice sensitised with the hapten CA alone, 40% reacted upon oral challenge with CA by an anaphylactic decrease in body temperature and physical activity. In contrast, they were unresponsive upon epicutaneous challenge with CA. Interestingly, corticosterone levels of CA-sensitised mice did not differ between the time points. Conclusions: We conclude that fragrances may via the nasal route indeed lead to specific type I hypersensitivity, but that the type and extent of response is critically determined by their antigenic statehapten or complete antigen. Background: Dual H 3 /H 4 antagonists modulate IgE production both in atopic and non-atopic diseases via H 3 receptors on both lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells. This investigation evaluates IgE synthesis modulated by R-alpha-methylhistamine, an agonist selective for H 3 receptors. Methods: Supernatants obtained after 9days culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 10 healthy donors and 12 ragweed allergic subjects during the pollen season were assayed for total IgE by CAP FEIA method (Phadia). Concentrations of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL1b, TNFa, IL4 and INFc) were assessed by ELISA in supernatants of PBMC pre-treated with R-alpha-methylhistamine (RMH). Loratadine and cimetidine were used as H 1 and H 2 histamine receptor antagonists.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 553, "end": 556, "text": "463", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1391, "end": 1394, "text": "464", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1663, "end": 1674, "text": "(lung, gut)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "462"}, {"text": "Results: RMH at 10 \u00c05 M decreased IgE synthesis but at lower concentrations (10 \u00c08 M) highly increased IgE synthesis up to 4-fold. Pre-treatment of PBMC by combined H 1 and H 2 antagonists modulated IgE synthesis in PBMC culture of healthy donors, with higher concentrations of RMH highly increasing IgE, while low concentrations reduced IgE. In cultures of PBMC of ragweed sensitive patients with ragweed allergen, IgE-regulatory activity was less pronounced than in healthy donor PBMC cultures. After simultaneous pretreatment of PBMC by H 1 and H 2 antago-nists, RMH dose-dependently decreased IgE synthesis in allergic patient cell cultures. IgE-modulatory effects were highly cytokine dependent, especially influenced by levels of IL4 and INFc. Conclusions: Histamine H 3 receptors may be involved in the regulation and modulation of IgE synthesis both in healthy donors and allergic patients. The impact of H 3 histamine receptor agonists such as Ralpha-methylhistamine on IgE synthesis by PBMC is dependent on the levels of IgEregulatory cytokines. 466 Effects of long-term low strength static magnetic field exposure on Th polarization in vitro Background: Unlike electromagnetic fields, for health effects from exposure to static magnetic fields (SMF), few studies have been carried out. Most of them are related to acute, high strenght SMF, measured in several units of tesla (T), trying to explain possible adverse health effects of exposure to magnetic resonance imaging. For effects of long term, low strength SMF, in the millitesla (mT) range, especially on immune cells, there is a just a few studies. Noboy has studied in vitro possible different biological effects of north (N) and south (S) magnetic pole so far. Only the N pole was used in all previous studies. The aim of this study was to investigate effect of long-term exposure of low strength SMF on in vitro Th1, Th2 and Th17 interleukin production. Method: Cultures of allogenic purified T lymphocytes and human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC) induced to mature by lipopolysaccharide, were continuously exposed to 5 mT north and south pole of SMF. The samples were from healthy donors. Supernatants were assayed to quantify IFN-c, IL-4 and IL-17 by ELISA. Results: South pole of SMF increased release of IFN-c (almost 50% compared to control) in DC culture supernatants, and not affected the level of IL-4 and IL-17. North pole of SMF produced no significant changes in cytokines level. Conclusion: This is the first time in literature that has been shown in vitro different biological effect of N and S magnetic pole, what is unexplainable from the physics point of view. Not only this study will help better understanding effects of SMF on immune system, but also this selective effect on Th1 immune response could have Background: The adverse transfusion reactions are primarily caused by an 'allergic reaction', according to of monitoring structures of 2009-2011 made by the National Blood Centre, Italy.

Background: Houttuynia cordata Thunb, well known as 'E-Sung-Cho' in Korea, has been used in traditional oriental medicine for the treatment of allergy. Alveolar epithelial cells produce many types of chemokines such as RANTES, TARC, or eotaxin induced by IL-Ib, IL-4 or TNF-a and may contribute to allergic disease by recruiting eosinophils. This was investigated the effect of each fraction of Houttuynia cordata Thunb extract on human bronchial epithelial A549 cells after allergic stimulation. Method: Cytotoxic effects of Houttuynia cordata Thunb extract were estimated via WST assay, A549 cells were stimulated with TNF-a (100 ng/ml) and IL-4 (100 ng/ ml) to induce chemokines. Then after treatment of each fraction (10 lg/ml), inhibition effect assay were estimated by sandwich ELISA. Results: Treatment with each fraction (10 lg/ml) for 48 h showed no significant decrease in the survival rate of the A549 cells. We demonstrated that TNF-a and IL-4 induced the accumulation of chemokines in the pulmonary epithelial cell lines A549. After the treatment with 10 lg/ml each fraction for 48 h, expression of RAN-TES decreased up to 75% by EtOAc and 77% by Hexane fraction. In addition, expression of TARC significantly was inhibited up to 86% by EtOAc fraction. Conclusion: In the results of present study, EtOAc fraction of Houttuynia cordata Thunb suppressed the TNF-a and IL-4stimulated TRAC and RANES production in the human bronchial epithelial A549 cells.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of ONO-4053, a DP1 (PGD 2 receptor) antagonist, on allergic rhinitis in a cynomolgus monkey model. Method: All experiments were performed in Ascaris suum-sensitive cynomolgus monkeys. Animals were anesthetized, intubated, and mechanically ventilated. Changes in the level of chemical mediators, inflammatory cells, and cytokines in nasal lavage fluid were determined before and after A. suum antigen nasal challenge. The effect of ONO-4053 on antigen-induced decrease in nasal volume was evaluated by acoustic rhinometry for up to 8 h after antigen challenge. ONO-4053 was intravenously infused to animals starting 1 h prior to antigen challenge and continuing until the end of the experiment.

In some patients with hypereosinophilia (HE) may cause life-threatening complications, whereas other patients, referred to 'hypereosinophila of unknown significance (HE, US)' do not exhibit any organ damage. This retrospective analysis sought to summarize baseline clinical, and laboratory characteristics in patients with HES and HE, US and to review responses to treatment. Method: Clinical and laboratory data from patients having IHES or HE, US, between January 2004 and December 2013 at Hallym Sacred Heart Hospital, were collected retrospectively after chart review. Result: A total of 25 patients were enrolled; 7 patients (28.0%) were diagnosed with HE, US and 18 patients (72.0%) with IHES. The mean number of white blood cell and peak total eosinophil count (TEC) were significantly increased in patients with IHES, compared to those with HE, US (P = 0.008, respectively). FIP1L1-PDGFRA mutation analysis was done in 9 patients using in situ hybridization, and all showed negative. The most common clinical presenting symptom was gastrointestinal (44.4%), followed by constitutional symptoms (33.3%), and pulmonary (11.1%). All patients received corticosteroids as initial therapy. Seven patients (38.8%) showed complete response and 11 (61.1%) with partial response within a month. However, 9 patients (50.0%) recurred during tapering or discontinuation of corticosteroid. There was no significant association between treatment response and laboratory parameters including peak TEC, total IgE, eosinophil cationic protein or marrow eosinophilia. Conclusion: The majority of patients with IHES respond to corticosteroid therapy, however, discontinuation of corticosteroid is associated with recurrence. There are no clinical or laboratory markers to predict the prognosis of IHES. Background: Mastocytosis is a rare disease characterised by abnormal expansion and accumulation of tissue mast cells such as skin, bone marrow, intestines, liver, spleen, lymph nodes. Cutaneaous mastocytosis is a primary mast cell disorder. Method: Clinical and demographic features of patients diagnosed with cutaneous mastocytosis were reviewed retrospectively. Diagnoses of all patients were confirmed by pathological examination of skin biopsies taken from characteristic lesions that were reported as urticaria pigmentosa. Results: Twenty-eight patients were included. Eighty two percent of patients were male. Two patients had family history of mastocytosis and one had consanguinity. Initial appearance of skin lesions ranges between 1 month and 3 years of ages. Triggering factor was detected in 50% of patients. Food was the most common trigger (%21.4). Increase in weather temperature, trauma, drug and insect bite rarely lead to emerging of skin lesions. In addition to skin lesions there were two patients with cardiovascular system findings and one patient with pulmonary system findings those were related to mast cell mediator release. Basal triptase level was 7.5 AE 2.73 lg/l (5-11.6) . Conclusion: In this study; we assessed demographic and clinical features of 28 patients with cutanous mastocytosis. Although urticaria pigmentosa is the most common form of cutaneous mastocytosis and rarely lead to systemic involvement in pediatric population, local mediator release may lead to systemic symptoms such as anaphylaxis. Early diagnosis and follow up of patients and education of families are necessary for pediatric age group. 477 Hypereosinophilic syndrome with congenital heart disease Harmanci, K 1 ; Turhan, AB 2 ; Kocak, AK 3 ; Bor, O 2 1 Eskisehir Osmangazi University, Eskisehir, Turkey; 2 Pediatric Hematology, Eskisehir Osmangazi University, Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a multisystem disease with peripheral eosinophilia of 1500/mm 3 eosinophils for at least 6 months' duration, multiple organ system involvement, and no evidence for other known causes of eosinophilia. Cardiovascular manifestations of the syndrome are the major source of morbidity and mortality. This report describes the surgical treatment of a patient with patent ductus arteriosus with HES. Case: Nine month old baby boy was admitted to our hospital with complaints of cough and wheezing. Physical examination had rhonchi in the lungs. Pansystolic murmur was present at the heart examination. Initial laboratory results included a white blood cell (WBC) count of 74000/ mm 3 , with 87% eosinophils. His hemoglobin was 14.8 g/dl, and platelet count was 325000/mm 3 . A peripheral blood smear revealed an abundance of eosinophils with multiple nuclear lobes. Considering the patient\u2032s records, it was seen that the blood count, performed when the patient was 2day-old and 1-month-old, also provided information about the existence of hypereosinophilia. Stool was negative for ova and parasites. LDH and vitamin B12 levels were normal. The Total and specific IgE levels were normal too. Lymphoid subpopulations were normal. No clonal T-cell receptor rearrangement was found. Bone marrow aspiration showed a hypercellular bone marrow with 50% mature eosinophils and eosinophil precursors, without blasts. The marrow findings were not considered consistent with a malignant or dysmyelopoietic process. RT-PCR failed to demonstrate the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene in peripheral blood. Chest x-ray were normal. Tryptase levels were normal and C kit (A2457) mutation was not detected. Cytogenetic chromosomal analysis revealed a normal karyotype. M mode and 2D echocardiography showed a patent ductus arteriosus, and areas of increased echodensity in the region of the apex of the left ventricle and the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve, suggesting endocardial thickening.

Although most patients seek medical advice for the cutaneous manifestations of mastocytosis, alergists and dermatologists should perform an extensive search for systemic involvement. Case report: We present the case of a 42year-old female patient initially diagnosticated with urticaria pigmentosa based on the clinical picture, skin biopsy, normal bone marrow biopsy findings and increased levels of serum tryptase (17 lg/l). The patient had experienced multiple episodes of anaphylaxis with various triggers (NSA-IDs, food). The patient was instructed to avoid triggers; treatment with oral H1 and H2 antihistamines and phototherapy was recommended, as well as epinephrine as needed. Parallel with the extension of the skin lesions, serum tryptase levels increased and subsequent bone marrow biopsy revealed the presence of multifocal dense aggregates of mast cells, with atypical mast cells expressing CD25 and CD117/c-kit. The patient tested positive for D816V c-Kit mutation. These findings together with the lack of further criteria for the diagnosis of aggressive systemic mastocytosis lead to the diagnostic of indolent sistemic mastocytosis. We decided to postpone initiation of cytoreductive therapy and to carefully monitor the patient in order to promptly detect disease progression. Discussions: This case represents a true therapeutic challenge due to the lack of symptoms control with conventional medication. Other options have been considered. Interpheron treatment is indicated in aggressive systemic mastocytosis, but the risk/benefit ratio in less aggressive forms of the disease is a matter of debate. Imatinib treatment was not a choice in our patient due to the presence of D816V c-Kit mutation. Close follow-up and an interdisciplinary approach is essential in similar situations. 480 An in vitro culture system to investigate vascular permeability on primary human vascular cells Background: Anaphylaxis is considered the most severe manifestation of allergic diseases and is described as a reaction with sudden onset that may cause death. Many organs are involved in anaphylaxis including the airways, skin, gastrointestinal system and vascular system. Particular the vascular system is of great interest due to the phenomenon of vascular permeability. In order to study the mechanisms of vascular permeability a reliable in vitro model of human vascular cells is needed. This study aimed at establishing an in vitro culture system for primary human endothelial cells (EC) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) to investigate vascular permeability. Method: Human saphenous veins were obtained from resection of varicose veins. The veins were cut longitudinally and treated with collagenase I to detach EC. The veins were subsequently incubated with collagenase II to dissociate VSMC. To obtain pure cultures of EC, cells were further purified using magnetic-activated cell sorting targeting CD31. Purified EC and VSMC were passaged to a trans-well culture plate and grown to confluency. EC and VSMC were stimulated with histamine or CGRP and a change in vascular permeability was fluorescently assessed by FITCdextran measurement. Results: We were able to generate cultures of human EC and VSMC from saphenous veins. Permeability assays using EC showed a 1.5 and 1.4 fold increase in permeability when EC were stimulated with CGRP and histamine, respectively, compared to unstimulated EC. Preliminary results indicate that VSMC likewise respond to histamine stimulation with an increase in permeability.

Background: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical features and grass pollen sensitisation pattern in patients who have been attended in the Allergy Department in an area with low grass pollen concentrations. Method: Patients with rhinitis and/or asthma with positive cutaneous tests to grass pollen. Grass recombinant allergens quantification: rPhl p1, rPhl p5, rPhl p7 and rPhl p12. In those patients with food allergy symptoms we carried out cutaneous tests to food extracts and rPru p3, if it was indicated. Positive recombinant allergen was considered for values higher than 0.35 kU/l. Results: Hundred patients were included (56 men) with a mean age of 38.02 years old.

It would be interesting to compare our data with patients data from a geographic area with a high concentration of grass pollen. Background: Component-resolved diagnostics is becoming increasingly important in allergy diagnostics. We analysed the prevalence of sensitisation to individual components and protein families in a Dutch tertiary patient population using the multiplex Immuno-Solid phase Allergen Chip (ISAC). Our aim was to determine sensitisation patterns and the proteins families involved in the population. Method: Multiplex ISAC tests were performed within our academic outpatient clinic in case of suspicion of (extensive) poly-sensitisation. Results: Of 874 ISAC tests, 787 showed sensitisation to at least one component and were included for further analysis. The majority of patients in our population was poly-sensitised, with 68% recognizing more than ten components. The most frequently recognised components were PR-10 proteins. Seventy-three pecent of the population recognised at least one PR-10 component, followed by 29% for storage proteins and 19% for non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTP). The prevalence of sensitisation to cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants (CCD) was 13%. Extensive co-sensitisation was seen within the PR-10 family. PR-10 sensitised subjects were on average sensitised to 7.2 of the 10 available PR-10 components. The top 10 inhalation allergens in our population were birch (Bet v 1; 70%), alder (Aln g 1; 65%), hazel (Cor a 1.0101; 61%), timothy (Phl p 1; 61%), bermuda (Cyn d 1; 57%), mite (Der f 2; 55%, Der p 2; 54%, Der f 1; 49%, Der p 1; 49%) and cat (Fel d 1; 55%). The top 10 food allergens were: apple (Mal d 1; 65%), peach (Pru p 1; 63%), hazelnut (Cor a 1.0401; 63%), peanut (Ara h 8; 56%, Ara h 6; 23%, Ara h2; 15%), soy (Gly m 4; 39%), celery (Api g 1; 25%), kiwi (Act d 8; 20%) and walnut (Jug r 2; 15%). Conclusion: Bet v 1 is the allergen component recognised the most, followed closely by other PR-10 family proteins. Sensitisation to nsLTPs and CCD plays a limited role in our patient population. Here we present a comprehensive review on the past and present of modern allergy diagnostics in China. Methods: We searched publications on this topic in Wanfang and Medline database using keywords 'allergy research', 'allergy diagnosis ' and 'China' from 1938 to 2013. Allergy research in ancient China was also reviewed in medical history books. Major methods in allergy diagnosis in China were discussed. Results: China may be one of the countries which acknowledged allergy response in ancient times in the world. The earliest observation of horse induced allergy response by humankind from the concept of modern medicine was recorded in ancient documents by Chinese emperor Shen Nung. One thousand eight hundred and forty-three papers were searched in Wanfang database with allergen detection as keyword. After analysis, nearly 300 hospitals or medical research institutes published manuscripts related with allergen detection. SPT is the most widely used invivo allergy test in China, followed by APT. Allergen reagents resources are complexity. ELISA was the most widely used in-vitro allergen test in China, followed by allergen screen test and ImmunoCAP. Im-munoCAP was available in 65% of the provinces based on the manuscripts resource institutions in database. IgG4 and ISAC system have been introduced in China now and they are still in research field not in clinical practice. Only 35% AE 28% of the otolaryngologists used SPT or specific IgE serum test in clinical practice, while 74% of them could perform SPT. The major allergen in China varies from geographic conditions. Conclusion: A variety of methods have been applied in China while none of them alone could provide a reasonable and sufficient detection panel for screening, which may be due to differences in geographic regions and allergen diversity. Chinese Allergen atlas should be finished through multi-centre survey. The allergen reagents resources in China are complex and there is a still great demand for high-quality reagents used in allergen detection. The national GMP of allergen detection reagents and GLP of application of allergens in different allergic diseases needs to be published and drafted, national guideline for allergic diseases should be drawn and it is suggested that clinicians need continuous education in allergy diagnostics.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2756, "end": 2761, "text": "' and", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2762, "end": 2788, "text": "'China' from 1938 to 2013.", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "BAFF expression on basophils from allergic and non allergic subjects"}, {"text": "Background: Data on allergic sensitisation and prevalence of allergic diseases in the elderly are scarce.

Background: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory condition of the lungs leads to the narrowing of the airways. It 0 s one of the most common chronic diseases in different ages, sex and races all over the world. It has a great impact on the physical, emotional and social quality of life of affected individual. Objectives: To assess the quality of life of a sample of asthmatic adolescents from Saudi Arabia, through an Arabic adaptation of the mini AQLQ and PAQLQ questionnaires, and to determine whether differences exist between asthmatics and healthy teenagers of equivalent age. Methods: A questionnaire was conducted on a sample of 135 Saudi asthmatic patients aged 11-19 years old who were randomly selected and a 146 healthy control subject with similar age range. The questionnaire covered questions related to day to day activities, environmental, emotional, as well as social life. The data was analyzed using SPSS and GraphPad prism software. Mann-whitney 0 s, one-way ANO-VA, Bartlett 0 s test and Bonferroni 0 s multiple comparison tests were used to determine significant differences among the 4 asthmatic groups and healthy subjects. Results: Mean age of asthmatic patients was 13.06 years (SDAE1.823) while that of healthy individual was 14.5778 years (SDAE2.29036). Our data indicated that compared to healthy adolescents, asthma had a negative impact Saudi asthmatic adolescents including increased school absences, emotional disorder and restriction of social and physical activities. Also, asthmatic patients were bothered by dust, cigarettes smoke and weather more than the healthy individuals. These findings indicated that Saudi adolescents with asthma had lower perceived quality of life score than healthy ones. Conclusion: Our data indicated that asthma had a negative impact on the quality of life of Saudi asthmatic adolescents. This study will educate the patients families as well as the society in large about the effect of asthma on the adolescents and hence encourages ways to minimize that especially in public places. It will also increase the government's attention about the asthmatic adolescents 0 outcome in school absents and the design of an appropriate workplace in the future. Background: Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is highly prevalent in endurance athletes and may impact on their health and performance. In athletes a secure diagnosis is dependent upon objective testing and the eucapnic voluntary hyperpnoea (EVH) test is recommended for this purpose. The short and long-term repeatability of EVH in the setting of amateur athletes is not established, yet has implications for both screening and treatment surveillance. Method: Thirty-six sub-elite athletes were recruited to take part in the present study. Subjects were required to attend the laboratory on three separate occasions separated by a short-term period of either 14 or 21 days and a long-term period of 10 months respectively. Pulmonary function assessment including spirometry and impulse oscillometry (IOS) was conducted before and following an EVH challenge. Results: Over the short-term period eleven athletes were diagnosed with EIB at visit one and eleven athletes at visit two. Only seven athletes were positive at both visits. Over the long-term period nine athletes were diagnosed with EIB at visit one and ten athletes at visit two. No significant difference was observed in maximum change in FEV 1 (DFEV 1 max) post EVH between visits (P = 0.115) and test-retest DFEV 1max was strongly correlated (ICC = 0.76; r 2 = 0.58; P = 0.001). Although there was only a small bias in DFEV 1 max between tests (\u00c01.56%) the data exhibited wide limits of agreement (\u00c013.8 to 10.7%). Conclusion: In our cohort of sub-elite athletes, EVH demonstrated poor repeatability over both short and long-term periods. These findings highlight the need for caution when considering confirming or refuting a diagnosis of EIB based on a one-time indirect bronchoprovocation test utilising a cut-off value of 10% fall in FEV 1 . Background: Sustained intense exercise can result in exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in elite swimmers, which may be linked to epithelial damage. Objective: To study airway epithelial damage and release of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) after intense exercise in elite athletes and controls. Method: Competitive non-asthmatic swimmers (n = 26), competitive non-asthmatic indoor athletes (n = 13) and control subjects (n = 15) were evaluated before, immediately after and 24 h after a 90-min intense exercise protocol. Sputum induction was performed at baseline and 24 h after exercise. Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) was assessed by eucapnic hyperventilation at baseline. Results: Baseline sputum uric acid, High Mobility Group Box-1, IL-8 mRNA and neutrophil levels were significantly higher in competitive swimmers compared to control subjects. Intense exercise induced sputum IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF mRNA in competitive swimmers. Even in control subjects, sputum IL-6 mRNA and sputum neutrophils significantly increased after intense exercise. Baseline serum Clara Cell protein-16 (CC-16) levels were significantly higher in both competitive swimmers and indoor athletes compared to controls. Seven competitive swimmers met the criteria for EIB, whereas this was observed in one indoor athlete and one control subject. Conclusion: Competitive swimmers had higher degree of epithelial damage, sputum DAMP molecules and neutrophils in the airways, which cannot be attributed to preexisting asthma. Intense exercise induced an increase in innate cytokines in the airways of swimmers. These findings point towards epithelial damage in the airways of elite athletes as a result of intensive training, especially when combined with exposure to by-products of chlorination. Background: Dysautonomia has been independently associated with both endurance training and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. Moreover, neurogenic airway inflammation was recently associated with swimmers-asthma. We aimed to assess the impact of the autonomic nervous system function on airway responsiveness and asthma in elite swimmers. Method: Twenty-seven elite swimmers, of which 11 had asthma, were enrolled in this exploratory cross-sectional study. After resting for 15 min in a semi-dark room, pupillometry (PLR-200 TM Pupillometer) was performed. One pupil light response curve for each eye was recorded and mean values of pupil's diameters before and at constriction peak, % of constriction, average and maximum constriction velocities (parasympathetic parameters), dilation velocity, and total time to recover 75% of the initial size (sympathetic parameters) were used for analysis. Asthma was defined using IOC-MC criteria; subjects were divided by AHR severity accordingly to PD20 in: no AHR (>7.80), very mild (3.21-7.80), mild (0.81-3.20), moderate (0.11-0.80) and severe (\u22640.10) AHR. Results: A tendency to lower pupil diameters, a higher % of constriction and a higher maximum constriction velocity were observed in asthmatics, although differences between groups were not significant. When stratified by AHR severity, maximal and minimal diameters, and % of constriction were significantly lower among those with severe AHR. Conclusion: In our sample, a trend to increased parasympathetic activity was observed among asthmatic compared to non-asthmatic swimmers, especially among those with severe AHR. This exploratory study provides support to the hypothesis of a neuroimmune interaction on the development of AHR by exposure to chlorination products, but further research with larger sample is needed. Background: Elite athletes are at increased risk of immunodeficiency diseases. Winter sport has an especially high risk of upper respiratory tract infections during periods of heavy exercise and for up to 2 weeks following sporting events. This investigation analyzes the effects of specialised diets enriched by macro and micronutrients including microelements and antioxidants on immune responses of elite winter athletes. Method: Eleven elite athletes who ski were assessed at the Scientific Institute of Nutrition, Moscow, Russia, as well as during training period outside of Russia. Lymphocyte sub-populations were assessed by flow cytometry (Cytomics FC500, Beckman Coulter). Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1b, TNFa, IL6) in sera were measured by ELISA. Vitamin A, C, E, bcarotene and total carotenoid levels in serum were assessed by HPLC. An adequate dietary intake of protein and specific micronutrients including vitamins B, A, C, E, b-carotene along with iron, zinc, copper and selenium was used as a dietary supplement. Results: A decreased immunoregulatory index (CD4+/CD8+) occurred in 3 of 11 athletes due to low levels of CD4+ cells. Two athletes had marked reduction in CD8+ cells. Most athletes after intense exercise had decreased numbers of activated T-cells (CD25+). Up to 50% of athletes had reduced numbers of NK lymphocytes (CD3+16+56+ cells). Seven of 11 of athletes had deficiency of b-carotene and decreased levels of total carotenoids. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1b, TNFa, IL6) were increased more than 3-4 -fold in most athletes. Supplementation with specialised diets usually normalised these cellular and cytokine parameters. The level of total carotenoids remained lower, however, in comparison to normal levels. Conclusion: Immune suppression reflected in altered lymphocyte sub-populations in winter sport elite athletes enduring prolonged intense exercise was mainly seen in T-helper and NK cell sub-populations, as well as increased production of proinflammatory cytokines. Changes in lymphocyte subpopulations may be related to low levels of anti-oxidative micronutrients. Factors inducing immune suppression may include low serum levels of anti-oxidative carotenoids and b-carotene. Low levels of anti-oxidative nutrients may increase immune suppression induced by intense physical activity by skiers. Specialised diets including macro and micro nutrients appear to normalise most altered immune functions. Background: Respiratory heat exchange has been proposed as one of the mechanisms of exercise induced asthma. Therefore, we hypothesized that an increase in exhaled breath temperature (EBT) would be observed in asthmatic compared to nonasthmatic elite swimmers after strenuous exercise. Method: Twenty-two elite swimmers accepted to participate this study. Each subject performed skin prick tests, lung function, salbutamol reversibility, and airway responsiveness to metacholine. Asthma was defined according to International Olympic Committee criteria. EBT was measured with X-halo thermometer before and after a swimming training session in the pool. Swimmers performed training with different intensities (mild aerobic, moderate/severe aerobic, mild anaer-obic and moderate/severe aerobic trainings). SPSS (P < 0.05) was used to compare asthmatic and healthy swimmers. Results: EBT significantly increased after the training session (P = 0.02) for all subjects, even after adjustment for potential confounders: training intensity, axilar temperature, therapeutic with inhaled steroids and the number of hours trained in the last week. Asthmatic swimmers presented significantly higher airway responsiveness, but no differences were observed for baseline (P = 0.10), and post-exercise (P = 0.28) EBTs, nor for the EBT increase with the training session (P = 0.22). Conclusion: We failed to observe a higher increase of EBT in asthmatic swimmers compared to healthy ones. Our observations failed to support the respiratory heat exchange theory as a mechanism of exercise induced asthma, but provide support to the recent reported hypothesis of airway hyperesponsiveness induced by chloramines exposure and activation of nociceptive airway sensory nerves independent of inflammation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "494"}, {"text": "Innate immune protein levels in serum of competitive speed skatersassociation with exercise load, training conditions and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction Background: Intensive exercise provokes changes in the innate immune response which may increase systemic inflammation and modify susceptibility to respiratory infections.

Serum levels of Heat shock protein (HSP) A1, IL-1RA, IL-1b, soluble CD14, TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-10 were assessed by ELISA. Weather data were acquired from Weather Information Service available online. Data on exerciseinduced bronchoconstriction (EIB) and upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) were acquired from Allergy Questionnaire in Athletes (AQUA) and exercise load was assessed with International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Results: In athletes, serum HSPA1 and IL-1RA during period I were similar, while in period II significantly decreased compared to controls. HSPA1 and IL-1RA serum levels in athletes were significantly higher in period I as compared to period II. Serum IL-1RA level in period I negatively correlated with outside air temperature (R = \u00c00.51; P = 0.003), dew point temperature (R = \u00c00.39; P = 0.03) and positively correlated with exercise load (R = 0.46; P < 0.01). Percentage of IL-1RA change from period I to period II was negatively correlated with vigorous exercise load during period I (R = \u00c00.64; P = 0.002). Serum IL-1RA levels in period I were significantly higher in skaters reporting EIB (3.78 vs 2.74 pg/ml; P = 0.02, mean log values), but not in skaters reporting frequent UR-TIs. No differences in serum sCD14 concentration were observed between athletes and controls. Serum levels of TNF-a, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-1b exceeded the detection threshold only in single subjects. Conclusion: During training season, parameters of innate immune response in athletes may be modified by exercise load and ambient conditions. Poster Session Group I -Blue TPS 5 -Anaphylaxis: clinical aspects 506 x5-gliadin specific IgE is a sensitive indicator to diagnose and predict wheat induced anaphylaxis in wheat allergy patients: a 5-year follow-up study Zhu, R Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Allergy, Wuhan, China Background: Wheat allergy has become common in China, and the symptoms varied from mild such as urticaria to severe. Wheat induced anaphylaxis is a severe form of wheat allergy and sometimes may be fatal. Previous studies suggested serum x5-gliadin specific IgE has a correlation with wheat dependent exercise induced anaphylaxis, but the role of x5-gliadin specific IgE in wheat induced anaphylaxis is still under controversial. Our study aimed to evaluate the value of serum x5-gliadin specific IgE in the diagnose and predict wheat induced anaphylaxis in wheat allergy patients. Method: One hundred fifty-two wheat allergy patients were enrolled in our study and were followed up to 5 years. Wheat allergy was defined as a suggestive history, positive skin prick test and/or positive serum IgE. A detailed history was recorded by telephone each year and serum specific IgE to wheat, gluten and x5-gliadin were measured at the beginning and the end of the study. All the patients were informed not to eat wheat. Wheat challenge tests were performed in the 5 th year. Results: Among the 152 patients, 94 were allergic rhinitis or allergic asthma, 43 were atopic dermatitis, and 15 were anaphylaxis. In the allergic rhinitis or asthma patients, the positive rate of specific IgE to wheat, gluten and x5-gliadin were 93.6%, 74.5% and 12.8% respectively; In the atopic dermatitis patients, the positive rate of specific IgE to wheat, gluten and x5-gliadin were 83.7%, 90.7% and 16.3%; but in anaphylaxis patients, the positive rate of specific IgE to wheat, gluten and x5-gliadin were 86.7%, 80.0% and 93.3%; The positive rate of x5gliadin IgE were significant difference in the three groups (P<0.05) and the level of x5-gliadin IgE had a strong correlation to wheat induced anaphylaxis (r = 0.944). Among the 33 x5-gliadin IgE positive patients, 18 patients developed anaphylaxis after wheat challenge test or ingest wheat unawareness, 7 in allergic rhinitis or asthma group, 1 in atopic dermatitis group and 10 in anaphylaxis group. However, only 2 patients experienced anaphylaxis after wheat challenge test in the 119 x5-gliadin IgE negative patients. Conclusion: Our study suggest serum x5gliadin is a sensitive indicator to diagnose and predict wheat induced anaphylaxis in wheat allergy patients, patient with a positive x5-gliadin IgE has a risk to develop anaphylaxis in future and the level of x5gliadin IgE has a positive correlation to wheat induced anaphylaxis. Background: Wheat is responsible for 60% of cases of food dependent exercise induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA) in Japan. It 0 s incidence in the Mediterranean Area is unknown and only a few series of patients have been reported.

Two patients were atopic (both sensitised to Dermatophagoides*). Prior to the diagnosis the patients had several emergency care assistances and were diagnosed with recurrent urticaria, idiopathic anaphylaxis or NSAIDs intolerance. Four of the 5 patients had a prolonged period of time between the onset of the symptoms and the diagnosis. Conclusion: Hypersensitivity to x-5 gliadin may be responsible for recurrent urticaria, anaphylaxis and FDEIA, all related to wheat ingestion. To our knowledge, this is the largest series described in this region. The diagnosis of this condition may be delayed due to the heterogeneity of the symptoms and triggers, being necessary a high level of diagnostic suspicion.

Four children had overcome their CM allergy and tolerated regular CM ingestion (except one with partial tolerance). All patients had rhinitis, 7 asthma, 4 atopic dermatitis and 5 other food allergies (nuts, seafood and legumes). The median follow-up time was 5.5 years (6 months to 11 years). Medians of specific IgE to whole CM, CM casein, GM, and SM at the time of diagnosis were 6.3 (0.1-11), 1.29 (0.18-9.74 ), 17 (0.62->100) and 32 (1.88->100) kUA/.

Conclusion: The majority of goat/sheep allergic patients had anaphylaxis. In the follow-up, sIgE to goat and sheep levels remained high despite strict avoidance. Half of our patients have a selective goat or sheep allergy. The other half had previous CM allergy and in two of them their CM tolerance depends on the continue ingestion as happens in patients after CM OIT. Background: Pomegranate is a fruit of the Lythraceae family, native of Middle East and spread through Mediterranean area. Lately its use is more frequent in yoghurts, juices and other products. Allergy to pomegranate has been scarcely reported in the literature. We present a case of allergy to pomegranate. Method: A 15-year-old man, no previous allergies, developed facial angioedema, dysphagia, dysphonia, throat tightness, pruritus and generalised urticaria 30 min after pomegranate intake. Afterwards he did not take this fruit again, but tolerate citrics, banana and rosaceaes. Skin prick test with a battery of common allergens, fruits, nuts, LTP as well as with 1/1 and 1/10 natural pomegranate extract (protein content of the extract measured by Bradford's method was 1.7 mg/ml) and prick-prick with fresh pomegranate was performed. Specific IgE to pomegranate detected by direct ELISA and immunoblotting were performed in the patient's serum and in 10 healthy controls without any allergy history. Results: Skin prick test were positive for artemisia, apple, peach, peanut, sunflower seeds, pea, LTP (Lipid Transfer Protein) and both concentrations of pomegranate and fresh pomegranate prick-prick. Pomegranate prick test with both concentrations were negative in 10 healthy controls. The pomegranate SDS-PAGE showed 6 bands with the following molecular weights: 46, 35, 28, 20, 14 and 9 kDa. Immunoblotting showed a 28 kDa and 9 kDa (probably a LTP) that bound IgE in the sera of the patient. Positive specific IgE to pomegranate was detected by ELISA. Conclusion: We report a IgE mediated allergy to Punica granatum confirmed by in vivo and in vitro tests. Background: Hidden allergens are a severe clinical problem. There were several reports of anaphylactic reaction after ingestion of allergens hidden in a meal, for example peanuts, egg or strawberries. Method: Patient, 55 years old, male, was admitted to perform diagnosis of allergy. In May 2010, after an accidental ingestion of kiwi hidden in vanilla ice cream (it is most likely that a small amount of kiwi fruit was on a spoon used for scooping ice cream) the patient developed shortness of breath, swelling and numbness of tongue, dizziness and temporary loss of consciousness, involuntary urination and defecation.

Results: The result of the prick by prick test was strongly positive (histamine 4 mm/ 4 mm, negative controlnegative, kiwi 9 mm/12 mm). Ten minutes after the test, the patient experienced severe headache, weakness, rash on the neck and d ecollet e, and shortness of breath.

Specific IgE concentration was not elevated to birch, grass pollen, trees, mugwort, house dust mites, molds, mix. spices, banana and latex. Total IgE concentration was 176.42 IU/ml. Conclusion: This case proves that it is very difficult to avoid hidden allergens. Because of a risk of severe anaphylactic reaction in this case, patient was recommended to carry a 'rescue set' (adrenaline, oral steroids, antihistamines). Background: Kounis syndrome has been described as 'the coincidental occurrence of acute coronary syndromes with hypersensitivity reactions involving activation of interrelated and interacting inflammatory cells and including allergic or hypersensitivity and anaphylactic or anaphylactoid insults'. Two variants of this syndrome were proposed, one due to vasospasm of previously healthy coronary vessels, the other due to rupture of atheromatous pla-ques in diseased atheromatous vessels. Recently a third variant was proposed, Kounis syndrome due to stent re-thrombosis in patients with previous stent placement. We present the case of a 58 year old male smoker with a background history of an inferolateral infarct with stent placement in the distal right coronary artery and anterior descendent artery who presented chest tightness, dispnea, dysphagia, pruritis and hives after consuming hazelnuts, olives, anchovies and beer for which he seeked medical assistance at his local General Practitioner who performed an electrocardiogram demosntrating elevation of the ST segment in V2-6 leads which was reverted with sublingual nitroglicerine afterwhich he was sent to the emergency department and was atended by cardiologists who performed a coronary artery angiogram which revealed restenosis of the anterior descendent stent segment and stenosis in the middle coronary artery which was treated with baloon dilatation and stent placement respectively.

Results: Prick tests to nuts resulted positive only to hazelnut. IgE to hazelnt, walnut and anisakis were elevated however IgE to major allergens r Cor a 8 and r Cor a 1 were negative. Basal triptase and triptase during the acute fase reaction were elevated leading us to suspect underlying mastocytosis yet to be confirmed. The bone scan and the rest of the blood tests were normal.

Background: Allergy to PR-10 proteins is usually associated with mild clinical manifestations and is typical of Northern Europe. We report a case of a 54 years old male that suffered three anaphylactic reactions after ingestion of raw apple. This reaction subsequently repeated with green beans and almonds. No other influencing cofactors were known. This patient always lived and worked in Portugal. Methods: Skin Prick Test (SPT) to commercial extracts from aeroallergens and foods, prick-to-prick test (PP) and serum specific IgE determinations (sIgE) were performed. The molecular mass of the IgE binding bands was estimated by means of SDS-PAGE immunoblotting. Immunoblotting inhibition assay using green beans as solid phase and the extracts from apple and birch pollen as inhibitors was performed. Results: SPT (results shown in mm) were positive to birch 9, apple 4; profilin 4 and negative to green-beans and Pru p 3. PP (mm) reveals to be positive to apple (peel 14; pulp 9) and green-bean (raw 10; cooked 5).

The SDS-PAGE Immunoblotting demonstrated an IgE binding band of 17 kDa to birch, apple and green-bean extracts. Immunoblotting inhibition assay showed total IgE binding inhibition on the 17-kDa green bean protein when extracts from apple and birch pollen were used as inhibitors. Conclusion: The initial analysis seems to suggest LTP sensitisation. However, sensitisation to birch and to the PR-10 Bet v1protein was confirmed. Moreover, the results obtained demonstrate that the patient had specific IgE that recognise proteins of molecular mass of 17-kDa in extracts of green-bean, apple and birch. Immunoblotting inhibition studies suggest that green-bean IgE binding band probably belongs to the group of Bet v 1 homologous proteins.

However, prospective clinical studies on vitamin D measured in cord blood and development of clinical end-points are sparse. The objective of this study was to investigate the interdependence of cord blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)-Vitamin D) level and investigator-diagnosed asthma-and allergy-related conditions during preschool-age. Method: Cord blood 25(OH)-Vitamin D level was measured in 257 children from the Copenhagen Prospective Study on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC 2000 ) atrisk mother-child cohort. Troublesome lung symptoms (TROLS), asthma, respiratory infections, allergic rhinitis, and eczema, at age 0-7 years were diagnosed exclusively by the COPSAC pediatricians strictly adhering to predefined algorithms. Objective assessments of lung function and sensitisation were performed repeatedly from birth. Results: After adjusting for season of birth, deficient cord blood 25(OH)-Vitamin D level (\u226450 nmol/l) was associated with a 2.7-fold increased risk of recurrent TROLS (HR = 2.65; 95% CI = 1.02-6.86), but showed no association with respiratory infections or asthma. We saw no association between cord blood 25(OH)-Vitamin D level and lung function, sensitisation, rhinitis or eczema. The effects were unaffected from adjusting for multiple lifestyle factors.

Ferritin can also be found in serum: this marker correlates closely with iron stores and is often used as an index of iron deficiency, alongside Transferin Saturation (TS). Both transferrin and serum ferritin (which is also an acute phase reactant), can exert antioxidant action by binding free iron.

We defined fall group as patients who visited emergency department in Sept, Oct, Nov and the rest were defined as non-fall group. We compared the clinical features, allergen specific IgE, cytokine, total IgE, eosinophilic cationic protein between fall group and non-fall group. Results: Twenty-eight patients were included in fall group and 8 were non-fall group. Within the fall group, 14 (50%) vis-ited emergency department in October. Mean age of fall group was 6.0 and 15 (58.3%) were male. Mean age of non-fall group was 5.6 and 6 (75.0%) were male. Total IgE was significantly higher in fall group; 787 IU/ml in fall group and 247 IU/ml in non-fall group. Antibody titer for Dermatophagoides farinae was 50.9 kU A /l and 11.9 kU A /l in fall group and non-fall group respectively. Antibody titer for Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus was 126.4 kU A /l and 27.1 kU A /l in fall group and non-fall group. Fall group showed significantly higher titers for house dust mite. Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, G-CSF showed no significant difference between 2 groups. Antiviral cytokines such as IP-10 and IFNc showed no difference. Conclusion: We found that in Korea, asthma exacerbation occurs most commonly in October. We also found that atopic tendency and sensitisation to house dust mite plays an important role in asthma exacerbation rather than viral infection as previously thought. However, further study will be needed to clarify why such difference occurred. Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe bronchial asthma (BA) often share inflammatory features, including autoimmunity. We aimed to reveal if the serum assessment of IgG4/ IgE-auto Abs to lung tissue Ags in cohorts of patients with COPD and BA could be applied in clinical and immunological disease monitoring. Method: We measured PHA-induced production of IL-4, IL-8 IL-10, IL-17, TGF-b by blood mononuclear cells and the induced sputum samples, obtained from 86 patients with coexistence of moderate/ severe COPD and BA (GOLD stage III/ IV) compared with 34 atopic BA and 20 healthy controls. IgG4-and IgE Abs to human lung elastin, collagen III and myosin were detected by quantitative modified ELISA. Results: Patients with combined COPD and BA in 69% of cases revealed significantly higher levels of IgE Abs to myosin (4.1 AE 0.3 IU/ml) vs atopic BA (2.3 AE 0.053 IU/ml) and had oppositely lower rate (21%) and levels of IgG4-Abs to myosin, elastin and collagen III as compared with BA (P < 0.05). IgG4 autoAbs among con-trols were not been detected. The group of COPD/BA patients, positive for IgG4-autoAbs showed higher production of IL-8 vs IgG4-negative subjects (P < 0.001). IgG4-positivity was associated with enhanced sputum levels of a profibrotic cytokine TGF-b and IL-4 only in atopic BA. Seventy pecent of patients within COPD/BA group had emphysema and showed predominance of IgE Abs with lower IgG4 Abs to collagen III and myosin (P = 0.006). Obesity (BMI \u2264 30 kg/m 2 ) was observed in 60% of cases and was independently associated with enhanced production of IL-17 and higher levels of antielastin IgG4 Abs (r = 0.87). The level of serum leptin increased in BA vs COPD independently from BMI and was higher among patients, positive for antielastin IgG4 Abs (P < 0.001). Conclusion: The detection of IgG4/IgE Abs profile to lung elastin, collagen and myosin could be considered for further trials in monitoring of COPD patients, especially with combined BA and obese phenotype. Background: Previous studies have shown that proteasomes are involved in pathogenesis of different diseases. It is thought that proteasomal genes which encode proteasomes are important in development of asthma and its phenotypes. We aimed to compare proteasomal genes (PSMA6, PSMC6 and PASMA3) diversity between patients with allergic and non-allergic asthma. Method: One hundred and six subjects with asthma (71 patients with allergic asthma and 35 with non-allergic asthma), diagnosed according to the recommendations of Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) were enrolled to the study. Sensitivity to standard allergens was evaluated using skin prick test. Alleles and genotypes of PSMA6 (rs1048990 and rs2277460), PSMC6 (rs2295827 and rs2295827) and PSMA3 (rs2348071) were evaluated using allele specific amplification and cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence methods. DNA from peripheral blood was extracted using Qiagen (Germany) DNA blood mini kit standardised protocol. Results: Prevalence of studied genes polymorphism in patients with allergic and non-allergic asthma was found as following: PSMA6 (rs1048990) Background: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a complex polygenic disorder of the nasal mucosa with strong heritability component. T helper 1 cytokines play critical and various roles in allergic response against allergens and their genes are located in previously reported susceptibility loci for AR. Therefore, in this case-control study, we evaluated associations of 4 common genetic polymorphisms of interleukin 2 (IL-2), interleukin 12 (IL-12) and interferon gamma (IFN-c) with AR. Method: In this study, 98 patients with AR diagnosed according to modified allergic rhinitis criteria in the 'Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma' (m-ARIA) document were enrolled in the study and 139 healthy volunteers with no history of AR and with the same ethnicity of the patient were recruited as the control group. Allele frequencies for two polymorphisms of IL-2 (rs2069762 and rs2069763), one variant in IL-12 gene (rs3212227) and one variant in IFN-c gene (rs2430561) were determined in both groups using PCR sequence-specificprimers method. Results: G allele in rs2069762 of IL-2 and A allele in rs2430561 of IFN-c were more frequent in the patients than in controls. However, there was not any association between allele frequencies of rs2069763 in IL-2 and rs3212227 in IL-12 and susceptibility to allergic rhinitis. In some subgroups of patients, there were significant relationships between IgE levels, eosinophil count, eosinophil percentage and persis-tency of disease and 2 variants in IL-2 and IL-12. Conclusion: We found that genetic variants in IL-2 and IFN-c were associated with susceptibility to AR. These polymorphisms could also affect the clinical parameters and persistency of the disease in some subgroups of the patients. Background: Epidermal growth factor (EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), AA isoform of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-AA), BB isoform of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are involved in the pathogenesis of airway inflammation in asthma. This study investigates the relation between asthmatic phenotype and levels of these mediators in induced sputum and serum. Method: Sixtey-two asthmatic patients were divided into eosinophilic and neutrophilic phenotype by cytological classification in induced sputum; FEV1/FVC% >70% and FEV1/FVC%< 70% by lung function; mild, midrange and severe asthma by asthma severity. And the concentrations of EGF, bFGF, PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB and VEGF in serum and sputum were measured using sandwich enzyme immunoassays. Results: VEGF levels in serum and induced sputum were higher in subjects with eosinophilic phenotype than that of neutrophilic phenotype, in patients with FEV1/FVC%< 70% than that of patients with FEV1/FVC%>70%, in severe asthma than that of mild and midrange asthma. There were no differences of EGF, bFGF, PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB between various phenotypes. Conclusion: Increased VEGF in serum and induced sputum were found in asthmatics with eosinophilic airway inflammation, more severe airflow limitation and asthma severity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 462, "end": 474, "text": "19.7 (15-24)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2660, "end": 2677, "text": "Sept 22, 2008 and", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2678, "end": 2689, "text": "Nov 8, 2010", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "533"}, {"text": "Genetics variants of VDR in IPA + Colombian asthmatic preschoolers living a a poor community of the Caribbean coast Introduction: Asthma is a complex disease in where a genetics heterogeneous compenent is involved.

All of them were not unrelated. This work was approved by de bioethical committee of Health Division of Del Norte University, at Barranquilla Colombia. Levels of serum Ig E and Vit D were determinate by an commercial ELISA assays. Participant children were genotyped for the 4 SNPs: BsmI, Fok I, Taq I and Apa I. VDRs polymorphisms were evaluated by Real time PCR in a thermal cycler Applied Biosystems7500. Results: For the VDR SNPs no statistically significant differences were founds between FokI, ApaI, and TaqI polymorphisms when the IPA (+) wheezing group was compared to control group (P = 0.34, P = 0.93, P = 0.67) respectively. In contrast it was found a statistical significance for BsmI between the studied groups (P = 0.05). There were no significant differences between vitamin D and Ig E levels and the studied polymorphisms in these groups of cases and controls. On the other hand the distribution of allele and genotype frequencies was similar in both groups. Conclusion: Taken together these results it seems that BsmI SNPs may be implicated in asthma susceptibility in this Colombian preschoolers however large population study should be performed in this admixed populations in order to validate our results. Background: Bronchial submucosal fibroblasts have been known as key cells in the pathogenesis of airway remodeling in asthma. However, it is not easy to get these cells through fiberoptic bronchosocoy in asthma patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate cellular characteristics of nasal fibroblasts to mechanical stimuli, and then the usefulness of these cells as a substitute for bronchial mucosal fibroblasts. Method: We enrolled seven patients with various nasal disease requiring paranasal sinus surgery under general anesthesia. One piece of nasal mucosa was obtained from inferior turbinate during surgery. Nasal mucosa was incubated in the 6 well culture plate with medium until plates were fully covered with fibroblasts. After harvesting, cells were stored in nitrogen tank under \u00c020\u00b0C. In the experiment, cells were incubated in the culture plate, and then cells were harvested after 48 h. In second group, 24 h after incubation of cells, cells were harvested, and then reincubated for another 24 h. Harvested cells were immunocytochemically stained with a-smooth muscle actin (SMA), and extracellular domain A fibronectin (EDAcFN). Western blotting was also performed using fibroblasts obtained from two different culture conditions. Results: There were statistically significant differences of SMA expressions between two groups (P < 0.05). Fibronectin expression showed a tendency of more expression in mechanically stimulated group than no stimulated group, but there were no statistical significances (P > 0.05). Western blotting of these two proteins showed similar patterns with immunocytochemistry. Conclusion: Nasal fibroblasts showed that these cells can easily transformed to myofibroblasts under mechanical stimuli. We would like to recommend that nasal fibroblasts may be used to as a substitute for bronchial mucosal fibroblasts for the study of airway remodeling associated with mechanical stimuli. Background: Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) modulates the amount of NO that could be related with iNOS polymorphism. The purpose of this study is to analyze the association between iNOS gene polymorphism: + 14C> T (Ex16+14C>T, Ser608Leu; rs 2297518; antisense sequence), with asthma severity when compared with a control group of healthy blood donors. Method: Asthmatic patients (n = 100) compared with a control group (n = 72); the polymorphisms were analyzed by PCR-RFLP (Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism). Control of asthma assessed by validated instrument (ACQ7 and PAQLQ). Statistical analysis performed with PASW version 18 establishing a significance level of P < 0.05. Results: Mean age of 100 asthmatics: 38.1 AE 18.6 years (7-86 years); 65 females and 35 males. Mean age of control-group (n = 72) was 41.68 AE 11.71 years (19-69 years); 25 females and 47 males.

Many studies have shown that eosinophils and mast cells play some important roles in the pathogenesis of AERD. However, there has been no study in which the relevance of basophils, which also release cysLT, to AERD pathogenesis was evaluated. We have explored CD203c expression on basophils from AERD patients in stable condition and its relevance to cysLT overproduction. Methods: We examined 17 AERD patients and 20 ATA patients whose aspirin sensitivity was determined by the aspirin challenge test. We used flow cytometry to compare the spontaneous expression levels of surface markers on basophils from patients with stable asthma and healthy controls (HCs). Longitudinal changes in these expression levels were measured after basophil stimulation by IgE-dependent or IgE-independent (IL3 stimulated) mechanisms and compared with patients' asthma status. Results: The spontaneous CD203c expression level on basophils from AERD patients was similar to those from ATA patients and HCs (p value = 0.198).

Conclusions: These single nucleotide polymorphisms seems to potentiate their causal relationship with asthma. splicing. Alternative isoform of IL-5 receptor chain alpha is well studied. However there was no data available on alternative spliced variants of IL-5 itself. Therefore the aim of the study was to identify spliced variants of mouse IL-5 in different tissues. Method: Cell suspensions were collected from spleen, blood, thymus and lymph nodes of BALB/c mice. 5 9 10 6 cells were stimulated with 2 lg/ml concanavalin A. Total RNA which was used for cDNA synthesis was obtained from the cells 18 h after stimulation. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed with specific primers at standard conditions. PCR products were separated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis after that DNA bands were visualized, extracted from the gel and sequenced. Results: For the identification of mouse IL-5 spliced variants, cDNA from stimulated cells was PCR amplified using specific primers. Forward primer was designed complementary to the start of exon-1 and the reverse primer to the end of the last exon-4. Separation of PCR products using electrophoresis revealed two DNA fragments with different size. Heavy fragment (402 bp) corresponded to full-length mouse IL-5 and consisted of four exons which was confirmed by sequencing. Light DNA fragment was 33 nucleotides smaller (369 bp) and was extracted from the agarose gel. Sequencing of this fragment revealed lacking of exon-2 in mouse IL-5 mRNA. This alternative variant of mRNA was labeled as mIL-5d2. Both variants of mIL-5 were detected in all investigated tissues: spleen, blood, thymus and lymph nodes. Conclusion: The new spliced variant of mouse IL-5 mRNA transcript lacking exon-2 (mIL-5d2) was identified in different tissues. Further studies are required to find out whether mIL-5d2 transcript is translated into protein and to identify it's role in allergic inflammation. Protein kinase c a (PKC a), a member of the PKC family, has been reported to contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma based on the results of the cell culture and animal studies. Our study objectives were to explore the association between the PKCa gene and asthma in adults by a genetic epidemiologic design and SNP genotyping. Methods: In the present study, we recruited 524 asthmatic patients and 524 age and sex-matched community controls, and the controls have no physician-diagnosed asthma or other respiratory diseases. Three tagSNPs (rs3764402 T > C, rs17633401 T > C, rs4520871 T > C) for PKCa were selected from HapMap. Result: The asthmatic patients had higher IgE levels and lower predicted values of FEV1 (%, pred) and FVC (%, pred). There were also significantly higher frequencies of obesity, smoking, owning pets, and the habit of incense burning in cases than in controls. We observed that the rs4520871 CC/CT genotype significantly increased the risk of asthma (TT vs CC/ CT, adjusted OR = 1.567, 1.037-2.370). We used stratification analysis to clarify the interaction between obesity and genotypes on asthma. After adjusting for age, sex, smoking, pet ownership, incense burning, and IgE levels, subjects with the PKC a rs4520871 TT genotype and normal WHR had a higher OR (1.660, 95% CI = 1.038-2.653) than subjects with the CC/CT genotype and normal WHR. It also modifies the association between obesity and asthma, although the interaction effect is not significant. Conclusion: The rs4520871 genotype is significantly related to adult asthma, and this finding could provide a way to predict the risk of developing asthma. Background: Atopic bronchial asthma (ABA) is the most frequent disease of respiratory organs in children. The goal of therapy for ABA of any stage is achieving control over the disease. Allergic reactions are being developed under direct participation of different cytokines. The aim of this study was to investigate the main indices of humoral and cellular immunity, the levels of cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, TNF-a) and polymorphism of promoter regions of cytokine genes (IL4, IL10 and IL2, TNFA) in children with atopic bronchial asthma with different levels of disease control. Method: We have examined 2 groups of childrenfifty-nine children with controlled BA (CBA) and fifty-one with uncontrolled BA (UBA). Mean age in the sample was 13.36 AE 2.24 years. Control group of healthy children (n = 52) was also studied. All individuals were Russians (Eastern Slavs) from Krasnoyarsk Territory (West Siberia). Diagnoses, severity, level of disease control were defined according to GINA recommendations. Immunocompetent cells were counted in blood using fluorescent microscopy. Humoral branch indices and cytokine levels (IL-4, IL-10, IL-2, TNF-a) in blood serum were measured by ELISA. Genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphism in cytokine genes was performed by PCR and restriction fragment length analysis. Genotype frequencies were tested for deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) by Fisher's exact test. Results: Significant differences between the groups were found for TNF-a, IL-4, IgE levels and the relative amount of CD8 + cells (was increased), while the counts of CD3 + cells and the relative amount of CD4 + cells was decreased in UBA as compared to CBA (P < 0.05). In CBA, lower concentration of the IL-10 in serum associated with the IL10 A-597 allele was observed. The IL4 T-590 allele tends to be associated with UBA. Conclusion: The level of TNF-a, IL-4, IgE and the CD3 + , CD4 + and CD8 + cell counts were identified as markers of uncontrolled course of ABA in children. Polymorphisms of the IL4, IL10, IL2, TNFA genes are associated with allergic inflammation in UBA and can be considered as candidate markers of uncontrolled ABA.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2740, "end": 2752, "text": "[1.451-6.386", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3076, "end": 3085, "text": "[2.321-10", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3428, "end": 3440, "text": "[2.792-7.384", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion:"}, {"text": "The independent and interaction effects between GSTP1 gene and smoking habit in adult asthma for identifying bronchial hyperresponsiveness and asthma. In this study, the objective was to investigate the association between polymorphisms of GSTP1 genotype, lung function and IgE concentrations in adult asthma. Furthermore, we explored the relationship of GSTP1 genotype, smoking and asthma. Methods: We recruited 524 hospital based asthmatic adults and 524 community controls with age and sex matched controls in this case-control study, and excluded the controls who were asthma, pneumonia, tuberculosis, emphysema, COPD and cancers by self-report. The five tagSNPs including GSTP1 rs6591256, GSTP1 Ile 105 / Val 105 (rs1695), rs749174, rs1871042 and rs947895 were selected from HapMap website. All subjects were genotyped by using real-time PCR and analyzed by the questionnaire. Results: The smokers carried major homozygous allele for five SNPs had significantly increased risk of asthma after controlling the confounding factors (AOR = 2.58, 2.56, 2.49, 2.47 and 2.47 for GSTP1 rs6591256, rs1695, rs749174, rs1871042 and rs947895, respectively). It was founded that the major allele (AAC) of rs6591256-rs1695-rs1871042 on asthma (OR = 1.93) in ever-smokers had increasing risk in the haplotype analyses, but not in never smokers. Conclusion: The results observed that major homozygous carriers and the haplotype (AAC) of GSTP1 tagSNPs increased the risk of asthma in ever-smokers. There-fore, cigarette smoking and GSTP1 gene may play important roles in adult asthma. Background: Asthma has a complex genetic background, and it is likely that multiple genes contribute to their development through main direct effects and through gene-gene interactions. Cytokines contribute to different aspects of asthma as they could determine the type, severity and outcomes of asthma pathogenesis. Allergic asthma patients undergoing an asthmatic attack exhibit significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, but in general asthma is associated with the evident cytokine network disbalance. In recent years cytokines and their receptors have been shown to be highly polymorphic therefore we investigated polymorphisms of genes coding interleukins IL1B, IL6, IL10 in relation asthma in children. Methods: We analysed 5 polymorphisms in 3 interleukins genes in 497 children. Genotyping of healthy and affected individuals with asthma was realised using PCR-restriction fragment length polymor-phism technique. Restriction enzyme AluI was used to digest the PCR fragment of the IL1B gene. RsaI and MnlI were used for fragments of IL10 genes, BstaAI were used for IL13 gene and NlaIII and BsrBI were used for IL6 genes. Results: There were no significant differences in the genotype and allele of the 3 selected polymorphisms (IL1B, IL6, IL10) among asthmatic and healthy subjects. The frequency of recessive homozygote of IL10 gene (-592C/A) was significantly higher in the children with bronchial asthma (11.30%) than in healthy children (4.82%) (OR = 2.28; P = 0.01). The A allele was more frequent in asthmatic children compared to healthy individuals (OR = 1.849; P < 0.0001). We found that the wild homozygote of IL6 gene (-174G/C) was more frequent among asthmatics (OR = 2.47; P < 0.00001), whereas variant homozygote presented a protective factor in bronchial asthma (OR = 0.5; P = 0.0014). There were no differences between atopic and non-atopic form of asthma. Conclusion: Our study brings new insight into the complex relationship between the asthmatic inflammation and polymorphisms of selected cytokines genes. It was shown that expression and secretion of interleukins in asthmatic may be affected by genetic polymorphisms, what could contribute to the complexity and diversity of asthmatic phenotypes and endotypes. These polymorphisms may have a diseasemodifying effect in the asthmatic airway. Background: Many studies have shown the importance for BHR in children with bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis. However, studies have not been done in BHR in school age and adolescence with atopic dermatitis (AD). Method: The patients with history of bronchial asthma were excluded and MCT were performed in 103 children with atopic dermatitis. The positive of MCT result is defined as PC20 \u2264 8 mg/ml. According of the level of PC20, the patients were divided into two groups. Results: The Group 1 (=BHR + ) was observed in 43 (41.7%) of all patient. Of two groups, significant differences were observed in age, BMI, parental allergic disease. No significant differences were observed in the number of male, SCORAD index, admission history, smoking exposure history, other allergic disease. The Group 1 (=BHR + ) have higher levels of total eosinophil count compared with the Group 2 (=BHR \u00c0 ) (629.8 AE 36 0.5 vs 470.17 AE 253.9/lL, P = 0.01). No significant association was found between severity of BHR and SCORAD score, total IgE, total eosinophil count and ECP (Eosinophil Cationic Protein) (r = 0.008, P = 0.961; r = \u00c00.217, P = 0.162; r = 0.225, P = 0.147; r = \u00c00.032, P = 0.841). The list of allergen is that the house dust mite, tree, weed, food, animal hair, fungus.

A main difference between emergency and elective caesarean section is the rupture of membranes and thereby microbial transmission from the mother. The objective of this study was to analyze whether the asthma risk in the offspring differ with type of caesarean section in the Danish population. Methods: This prospective national registry study is based on all children born in Denmark during 1997-2010. Asthma was defined by recurrent in-patient hospital admissions; long-term outpatient treatments; or long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids. Emergency section after rupture of membranes was compared to elective section before rupture of membranes. Results were stratified by parity (including first-and second-born), and adjusted for calendar year, age, gender, birth weight, gestational age, multiple births, maternal asthma, age, employment, smoking and antibiotic use during pregnancy. Results: The 900 000 children were born in Denmark during 1997-2010. Both emergency and elective cesarean section increased the risk of all asthma phenotypes compared to natural delivery among the first-born children with confounder adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) of 1.12 and 1.14. Cesarean section also increased the asthma risk for second born children compared to natural birth, and in addition there was a significant difference between types of cesarean sectionselective section had 9% (P = 0.035) higher risk of asthma compared to emergency section. Conclusions: Both delivery by elective and emergency cesarean section was positively associated with increased risk of three different phenotypes of childhood asthma. The increased risk of asthma after elective section emphasizes the potential role of the microbiome in immune programming early in life. Objective: To compare the peculiarities of the course of severe bronchial asthma (BA) depending on the type of local inflammation. Materials and methods: Fifty-nine patients (27 male and 32 female) with severe BA, mean age (58.7 AE 11.7) years according to the questionnaire, spirometry, the local immunity (cellular composition of induced sputum) were divided into 4 groups depending on the type of inflammation. Results: In group I, (35 (59.3%) prevailed neutrophilic type of inflammation, in II (6 (10.2%)eosinophilic in III -6 (10.2%)mixed (neutrophil-eosinophilic) and IV -(12 (20.3%) mononuclear (lymphocytes and alveolar macrophages). All patients had the same degree of severity of the disease. But in the I group the number of patients with 3-4 exacerbations per last year was higher (80.0 AE 6.8)% (P < 0.05) vs II and III groups. In I group there were more patients with \u22654 exacerbations per year and with 3-4 hospitalisations, prolongation of exacerbations >30 days. In group I daily doses of inhaled corticosteroids weres the highest and patients received more than three courses of systemic corticosteroids (P < 0.05). In group I there were more patients in whom short-acting b2agonists were ineffective. Atopic status was most pronounced in groups II and III, where seasonal exacerbation of BA were more severe than in group I, linke symptoms with allergens was in (66.7 AE 19.2)% of patients ((P < 0.05) compared with group I).

The increasing number of evidence show, that body mass may play a role in disease severity, response to the treatment and prognosis. The aim of the current study was to analyze the degree airflow limitation measured in patients with asthma and COPD depending on the BMI and body mass. Methods: The group of 321 patients hospitalised in the Department of Allergology, Medical University of Gdansk in the years 2010-2011, Poland was studied including 191 patients with asthma (mean age 50 SD 14, 74% women, 26% men) and 130 with COPD (mean age 67 SD 10, 35% women, 65% men). Spirometric examination was performed using Lungtest 1000 (MES, Poland) at the end of the hospitalisation. Obesity, overweight and underweight was defined according to BMI classification. Results: Underweight was found in 6 (3%) of patients with asthma and 5 (4%) of COPD group. Overweight and obesity were observed in majority of subjects (respectively in 64 (35%) and 50 (26%) asthmatics and 59 (45%) and 24 (18%) of COPD patients). In both groups higher BMI was more often found in men than women (asthma 28.1% vs 26.3% P = 0.02; COPD 26.6% vs 24.7% P = 0.02). These results are similar with the general population of Poland (men 45% overweight, 17% obesity; women 30% overweight, 15% obesity) [data of the central statistic office of Poland 2009]. The clear relation of BMI below 20 and above 35 in patients with COPD is related with impaired airflow (mean FEV1 in patients with BMI in a range 20-35 is 58% SD 21, whereas in patients with BMI < 20 or >35 is 47% SD 16; P = 0.03). There was no relation of BMI and airflow limitation in patients with asthma. Conclusion: Overweight and obesity are common in patients with asthma and COPD. The BMI below 20 and above 35 is related with the impaired airflow in COPD patients. Such a relation was not found in asthma group, which does not exclude other negative influence of an improper body mass on the disease severity. Background: To study clinical, morphological features, to estimate influence of therapy on abilities of neogenesis of mucosas in patients with bronchial asthma (BA) of various age. Method: Clinical and epidemiological data of ambulatories were analysed. The risk factors, given laboratory and tool methods of research are studied. We used standard bench tests and tool methods. Special bench tests included immunogram, research of systemic hormonal level of a subthalamic hypophysial thyroid gland in Serum, using a radioimmunoassay and immunodetection enzyme methods. Morphological examination scraping nasal cavities (SNC), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was executed by using scanning and transmission eletron a microscopy, the same methods were used for semi-thin sections (STS). Results: Patients were divided into three groups: the first group -57 patients with BA (14-18 years), the second group -79 patients with BA (19-35 years), the third group -61 patients with BA (36-55 years). In group of teenagers the mild form of a disease is taped at 40.3%, an average form at 32.8%, and a serious form at 26.9%. At adult patients (19-55 years) forms made 20%, 50% and 30% respectively. Accompanying pathologies of BA which were diagnosed among a half of patients, were a gastrointestinal tract, endocrine systemic illnesses, vascular dystonia. In the third group the quantity of accompanying illnesses was more, than in other groups. Our practice shows that the complex treatment referred on well-timed purpose of the main treatment and allergen of a specific immunotherapy (ASIT), is the most effective method for asthma treatment now. After therapy of ASIT there is an intensive decrease of a reactivity of mucosas of respiratory tracts, intensifying of neogenesis of an epithelial barrier which at young patients are more expressed in comparison with adults. These data are confirmed by us clinical and morphological methods. Well-timed delivery of ASIT not only reduces development of clinical symptoms of asthma, but also reduces quantity of used drugs, reducing risk of development of serious forms of illness and improvement of quality of life of the patient. Conclusion: It is shown that well-timed purpose of the main treatment and ASIT leads to fast morphological neogenesis of an epithelium of mucosas of respiratory tracts (more at young patients), considerably extends the remission period, allows to reduce expenses of the patient.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "560"}, {"text": "Association between asthma and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders in children: potential risk factors Subjects-patients: Five hundred and twenty children with asthma and ADHD (A-ADHD) and 520 controls aged 5-16 years old matched controls.

No other papers have been published to assess the presence of allergens from mites, pollens, moulds or animal dander in small airways. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the presence or absence of allergens in small airway, by studying bronchoalveolar lavage with monoclonal antibodies (Alt a 1, Alternaria alternata; Phl p 5, Phleum praetense; Der p 1, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus). Methods: Samples of bronchoalveolar lavage were collected and prepared to perform electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and quantification of major allergen (antibody detection by ELISA). Results: A total of 48 samples were collected (21 females and 27 males). The quantification of the major allergen of Phleum praetense, Alternaria alternata and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Phl p 5, Alt a 1 i Der p 1) was negative for all the samples.

Results: Maternal usage of antibiotics in pregnancy was associated with increased risk of childhood asthma for all three asthma case definitions: inpatient admission adjusted Incidence Rate Ratio (aIRR) [95% CI] 1.24 [1.18-1.30 ]; outpatient attendance aIRR 1.22 [1.18-1.27 ]; steroid use aIRR 1.18 [1.15-1.20 ]. The effect estimates were similar for maternal antibiotic use before pregnancy and after birth. The risk of asthma increased with number of maternal antibiotic treatments and the association was observed both for antibiotics administered for respiratory tract infections and for antibiotics administered for other types of infections. Conclusion: Mother's use of antibiotics (both respiratory and non-respiratory groups of antibiotics) showed a dosedependent association with the risk of asthma in the offspring. However, this association was independent of the latent period between mother's use of antibiotics and her pregnancy. It is therefore unlikely that the association is mediated through changes in the human microbiome. Instead we suggest that maternal antibiotic use may be a surrogate marker of a propensity for infections as the genetic risk linked to childhood asthma. Background: Bronchial epithelial cells are the first-line barrier against respiratory infections by initiating acute inflammation and producing chemokines recruiting inflammatory cells and are involved in the pathogenesis of asthma. Regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES) is a chemokine which attracts eosinophils, mast cells and basophils toward site of allergic inflammation. Interferon c-inducible protein (IP)-10 plays an important role in asthmatic inflammation and exacerbation. Epithelial cell-derived neutrophil-activating peptide 78 (ENA-78) is a neutrophil-active chemoattractant contributing airway neutrophilia in patients with severe asthma. PGI 2 analogs are recently regarded as having potential in treating asthma for their anti-inflammatory effects. However, the effect of PGI 2 analogs on the expression of RANTES, IP-10 and ENA-78 are unknown. Methods: The human bronchial epithelial cell lines, BEAS-2B cells and normal bronchial epithelial cell lines were pretreated with different concentrations of PGI 2 analogs including iloprost, treprostinil, beraprost and ONO-1301, or dibutyryl-cAMP (a cyclic AMP analog) before polyinosinicpolycytidylic acid (poly I:C) stimulation. The levels of RANTES, IP-10 and ENA-78 were measured by ELISA. The involved signaling was investigated by receptor antagonists, pathway inhibitors and Western blotting. Results: Iloprost, treprostinil, beraprost and ONO-1301 suppressed poly I:Cinduced RANTES, IP-10 and ENA-78. The effect was partly reversed by the selective IP receptor antagonist CAY 10449 and EP4 receptor antagonist GW 627368X. Dibutyryl-cAMP conferred a similar effect. Iloprost suppressed poly I:Cinduced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-p38. Conclusion: PGI 2 analogs suppressed poly I:C-induced RANTES, IP-10 and ENA-78 via the IP/EP4-cAMP pathway and the MAPK-p38 pathway in human bronchial epithelial cells. PGI 2 analogs may have potential to treat asthma by suppressing asthma-related chemokines production by bronchial epithelial cells.

AD severity was evaluated through SCORAD and Quality of Life (QoL) through DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index). Results: A total of 44 patients were enrolledmean age (SD) of 31 (13) yo, 39% males. SCORAD mean (SD) was 45 (28) and DLQI mean (SD) was 8 (5) . Thirty-four percent of patients presented anxiety while only 14% presented depression. No correlation was found between anxiety and SCORAD while a positive correlation was suggested between depression and SCORAD (R = 0.3; P = 0.068). As for personality traits, a one-way ANO-VA mean comparison for each trait and SCORAD showed significant differences only for Consciousness (P = 0.039). Concerning QoL, a linear regression model presented SCORAD as the strongest predictor. Conclusion: As for other immune mediated skin diseases, future studies are required to undoubtedly prove the association between AD severity and several psychological parameters. Also, it is of vital importance to establish whether depression is a cause or a consequence of having a more severe phenotype of the disease. In a near future, psychotherapeutic interventions may present as an important instrument for disease control.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1699, "end": 1702, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "569"}, {"text": "This work was supported within the scope of PP_IJUP2011_91.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "569"}, {"text": "Atopic dermatitis in early life: arguments for at least two phenotypes?

We defined two phenotypes of doctor-diagnosed AD based on the time of onset of the disease: early AD, occurring within the first 4 months of life, and late AD, starting after the age of 12 months. Results: A maternal allergic history was associated with an increased risk of developing early onset AD (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 95% CI: 5.48, 1.11-27.15, P = 0.04), while infant consumption of antibiotics in the first 6 months of life was associated with an increased risk of late onset AD (OR, 95% CI: 5.37, 1.64-17.54, P = 0.01). Having siblings (OR, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.03-0.78, P = 0.02) was associated with a reduced risk of developing AD after 12 months of age. Early onset of doctor-diagnosed AD (OR, 95% CI: 5.34, 1.32-21.63, P = 0.02) was associated with an increased risk of developing allergic sensitisation, while late onset of AD was not associated with allergen sensitisation. Conclusion: We found that early onset of AD is mainly associated with familial factors, such as maternal allergy, while late onset of AD is mainly affected by environmental factors. Our study supports the concept that different phenotypes of AD exist in young children. Background: Atopic dermatitis in infants is a common disease. Changing the stereotype of diet and lifestyle, environmental and other factors can influence on the character of sensitisation.

It is encoded by the FLG gene, which is located within the epidermal differentiation complex on chromosome 1q21. Goal of our study was to estimate the association of four most com-monly described FLG mutations R501X, 2282del4, R2447X, and S3247X with the development of atopic dermatitis (AD), allergic contact dermatitis (ACD)) in Slovenian patients. Method: Four prevalent loss-of-function mutations in the FLG gene (R501X, 2282del4, R2447X and S3247X) were genotyped in 241 AD, 100 ACD and 44 CICD patients and in 164 healthy controls from Slovenia. Results: The most frequent FLG mutation 2282del4, but not R501X, R2447X or S3247X, was significantly associated with greater risk for AD (OR = 4.33, 95% CI: 1.26-14.96, P = 0.012). Furthermore, subgroup analysis among AD patients revealed that carriers of FLG loss-of-function mutation were more likely to have earlier onset (<2 years: OR = 8.09, 95% CI: 2.19-29.87, P = 0.0006) and longer persistence of the disease (>20 years: OR = 15.54, 95% CI: 4.13-58.44, P < 0.0001) as well as they more often required hospitalisation (OR = 12.38, 95% CI: 3.36-45.60, P < 0.0001). On the other hand no association between FLG mutations and ACD or CICD, were found. Conclusion: The FLG loss-of-function mutations increases the risk for development of AD, but not ACD or CICD, in Slovenian patients. Furthermore, FLG mutations are a predisposing factor for a more severe AD phenotype, leading to earlier onset, longer persistence and hospitalisation. Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory skin condition with important impact in patient 0 s quality of life. In severe cases, conventional management with emollients and topical corticosteroids (CS), or even systemic immunossupressant drugs may not be effective. Omalizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal anti-IgE antibody approved for severe refractory asthma. Its use in selected cases of severe AD can be beneficial. Method: We report the case of a 13 yearold girl with asthma, rhinitis, fish allergy and AD. She presented cutaneous symptoms since she was 2 year, with progressive worsening in the last 4 year resulting in a severely impaired quality of life despite adequate treatment, which included oral CS, cyclosporin and UV therapy. She was referred to our department at age of 12. Skin prick tests and specific IgEs were positive to house dust mites, grass pollen, pigeon 0 s droppings and several fish species, with a total serum IgE level of 1404 UI/ ml. There was no significant improvement of AD despite fish avoidance and treatment with oral antihistamines (AH), topical CS and/or pimecrolimus and oral CS. Authorization for a trial of 6 months (m) of Omalizumab (600 mg SC every 2 weeks, asthma weight-adjusted dose) was obtained. Results: Omalizumab was well tolerated with significant improvement in skin lesions and pruritus after 6 m (SCORAD reduction from 90.5 to 44.8) enabling AH discontinuation. Due to a respiratory infection Omalizumab was delayed 1 week, with recurrence of skin lesions, which recovered only 1 m after regular anti-IgE therapy. It was decided to continue treatment for further 6 m. Conclusion: Like previous reports, this case demonstrates that Omalizumab is a well tolerated drug that can be useful for the treatment of AD refractory to other systemic treatments. However there is still no consensus regarding appropriate dose or duration of therapy, so controlled studies addressing these issues, as well as efficacy in AD, are needed. Background: New efficient method for producing an aqueous dispersion of fullerene C 60 (DF) was developed. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of a DF in a mouse model of atopic dermatitis (AD). Method: Experimental model of AD was produced by using epidermal sensitisation with OVA (100 mcg/mouse) during for 7 days, 3 times with 2 week intervals. Four groups of mice were used to evaluate the effects of DF: subcutaneous, intragastrical and intravenous injections at dose of 2 mg/mouse and epidermal application with 20 mcg/mouse. A group of mice treated with saline was used as a negative control. The cytokine expression was measured in supernatants of spleen cells stimulated with OVA for 72 h and OVA antibody levels in serum samples using ELISA.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "575"}, {"text": "Results: The levels of specific IgE and IgG2a antibodies were decreased in mice of groups treated with DF (epidermal, subcutaneously and intravenously) compared to the non-treated group (atopic dermatitis).

The levels of IFNc and IL-12 in mice with epidermal application of DF were significantly higher compared with the non-treated group. Conclusion: These results obtained demonstrate that the DF exhibits a significant anti-inflammatory effect in mouse model of atopic dermatitis, especially via epidermal application, and possesses high therapeutic potential. The patients with AD are prone to search help in the area of complementary and alternative medicine. Complementary medicine can help in achieving the control over the disease, but should be used carefully. b-glucans are natural substances with potent immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory activity, which can be used also in the topical treatment of AD.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "575"}, {"text": "In the multicentre open splitbody study we evaluated the effect of cream containing pleuran (b-glucan isolated from Pleurotus ostreatus, Imunoglukan P4H \u00e2 cream) in the treatment of atopic dermatitis in a group of 105 patients (39 males, 37%; aged 20.4 years) during 6 months. The studied cream was applied 2 or 3 times per day on the left side of the body and as a control, standard emollient was applied on whole body 2 or 3 times daily. There were 4 visits across the study with the evaluation of subjective (using Visual Analogue Scale, VAS) and objective (EASI score, Eczema Area and Severity Index) characteristics of AD. Results: The study was completed by 80 patients (76.2%). Topical b-glucan application resulted in the significant improvement of both objective and subjective symptoms of AD. On the application side, significant decline in the number of days with AD exacerbation and its severity was observed at the end of observed period. Moreover, the subjects experienced decline of pruritus on the b-glucan half of the body (VAS score: 1.68 vs 1.95, P < 0.001). During the study, the continual and significant decline of EASI score on the site of b-glucan application was observed compared to second half of the body (V4: 1.57 vs 1.85, P < 0.001). The preparation was in general well tolerated, but 16 patients were withdrawn from the study due to intolerance to b-glucan cream. Conclusion: b-glucan-based cream (containing pleuran) can be used as a supportive complementary therapy of mild to moderate forms of atopic dermatitis due to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and immunomodulatory activity. Background: Emollients/moisturisers are widely used as adjuvant therapies in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Several brands contain various molecules with a presumed or demonstrated anti-inflammatory role, such as oat -proteins. Some studies have shown that these are safe for people sensitised to grains. Method: To report a case of type-1 hypersensitivity to an oat based emollient in a child with severe atopic eczema and food allergies. Results: A 3 year old boy with severe atopic dermatitis (AD) with allergy to nuts, egg and fish presented in the paediatric allergy service following A&E attendance as 'idiopathic' anaphylaxis. He suffered urticaria, angioedema and breathing difficulties and required Adrenaline. He had suffered previous anaphylaxis triggered by egg and Peanut. He declared a minor reaction on eating oats but tolerated other grains and with wheat on a regular dietary basis. The aetiology of the most recent reaction was not clear, with no time-relationship related to food. He was using several emollients including an oat based cream which his mother applied just before the A&E admission. On assessment we performed SPT with oat solution and this elicited a weal with flare of 16 mm. The SPT was repeated at age 6 and was 4 mm. Because of the reduced SPT size we performed a supervised challenge with oat but he developed anaphylaxis during the test. We then challenged him with oat-based cream and application of the cream triggered marked localised urticaria. Conclusion: Oat sensitisation in AD children has been reported to be higher than expected (1) . Its application via emollient in predisposed patients with impaired epidermal barrier is the postulated mechanism underlining this. We describe a case of oat allergy in a child who tolerated all other grains. We also report a case of anaphylaxis to the topical application of an oat-based emollient. Caution should be exercised when prescribing oat based emollients to patients with confirmed oat allergy. Background: Oral immunosuppressive drugs are off-label recommended for recalcitrant atopic eczema, in which conventional treatment cannot control disease activity. However, there is no study documenting the best systemic agent to choose and there is limited data on its correct use in the pediatric setting. This study was designed to retrospectively assess clinical response to azathioprine in a cohort of children currently being followed-up in our reference hospital clinic. Methods: Ten children (mean age 11 years-old, male to female ratio of 1.2) with severe atopic eczema were treated with oral azathioprine. Baseline thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) was measured in order to minimize the risk of toxicity and reach the effective dose (1-3 mg/kg/ day), and patients were followed-up every 6 weeks for clinical assessment and laboratory testing. Results are based on retrospective examination of data taken from the hospital notes of these children. Results: Clinical improvement was observed in all patients, being more pronounced after 3 months of therapy, with significant decreases in erythema, excoriation, lichenification and extent of eczema, with significant fewer flare-ups. In all patients, there was a decrease in the need for high-potency topical steroids or oral steroids prescribed for exacerbations. The only dropout patient corresponded to a 7 year-old female who developed neutropenia after 5 months (blood count with 1040 neutrophils), the reason why she discontinued azathioprine and restarted topical treatment. One 16 year-old male had completed 1-year treatment with significant improvement, and afterwards started on omalizumab due to concomitant severe allergic asthma; however an eczema flare-up was observed after stopping azathioprine which was then restarted. Conclusion: Although the small sample size may be a limitation, this study shows that azathioprine appears to be beneficial in the treatment of pediatric recalcitrant atopic eczema, with few side effects.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3204, "end": 3207, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods:"}, {"text": "TPS 10 -Atopic dermatitis II 583 Gender differences in association between body mass index and current eczema in adulthood Vindenes, HK 1 ; Real, FG 2,3 ; Svanes, C 1,3,4 ; Johannessen, A 3 ; Skorge, TD 1,3 ; Omenaas, E 3 ; Jarvis, D 5 ; Dharmage, S 6 ; Leynaert, B 7,8 ; Norb\u20ac ack, D 9 ; Lindberg, E 9 ; Stutz, EZ 10 ; Janson, C 9 ; Dratva, J 10 ; Russell, MA 6 ; Bertelsen, RJ 1,3 1 Department of Occupational Medicine, Haukeland", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Poster Session Group I -Blue"}, {"text": "Background: Obesity has been associated with an increased risk of atopic dermatitis in children, in particular among girls. Few studies have assessed the association between obesity and dermatitis and addressed gender-specific differences in adulthood. We aimed to describe the association between body mass index (BMI) and eczema in adulthood, with particular emphasis on gender-specific differences. Method: Information on measured weight and height and interview data on eczema was available from 8949 participants (aged 30-55 years) of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey II. Current eczema was defined as itchy rash coming and going for at least 6 months during the last 12 months. Persons with previous but not current itchy rash were excluded from the analyses. The association of current eczema with BMI was analysed with logistic regression models, adjusting for age, smoking, one or more specific IgEs, parental history of asthma/allergy, current use of asthma medication and clustering by study centre. Results: In the whole group current eczema (14.5%) increased generally with increasing BMI (OR per unit change = 1.02; 95%CI 1.01-1.04), an effect that was only identified among non-atopics (1.03 [1.01-1.05]). In women (15.6% with current eczema), the odds ratio for current eczema increased with increasing BMI categories (Table 1) , whereas a similar association was not seen for men (13.2% with current eczema). When including predilection areas affected by itchy rash as an additional criterion, current eczema remained statistically significant associated with the highest BMI category in women OR = 1.40 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.90). Conclusion: Current eczema was more frequently reported among women with high BMI. The association between BMI and current eczema was not observed among adult men. After adding eczema in predilection areas in the definition for eczema, women in the highest BMI group (BMI\u226530) were still more likely to report current eczema than women with lower BMI. The findings may point to metabolic or hormonal influences on eczema in adults. CRP was elevated (>5 mg/dl) in 23% of AD children and in none of the healthy ones (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Dietary intake of macronutrient was similar in AD and control group. AD children exhibited blood lipid profile within the age-specified range, but 15% lower mean HDL. This may suggest the role of HDL as modulator of immune system. Adequately powered longitudinal trials are needed to assess the effective relationship between atopic dermatitis and HDL lipoproteins in children. Method: Thirty-five children (17 M/18 F, mean age [SD]: 5.7 [3.9] years, range 1-14 years) with AD consecutively recruited at the Department of Pediatric, San Paolo Hospital, Milan, Italy, were enrolled in the present study. AD severity was graded by means of the SCORAD index. Patients with a SCORAD\u226440 were defined as having mild to moderate AD, and those with SCORAD>40 as having severe AD. A single measurement of vitamin D [measured as 25(OH)D] was obtained from each patients using a chemiluminescent method. Student 0 s T tests for independent samples, and Pearson's and partial correlation coefficients were used to analyse the data. Results: Children with mild to moderate AD (n = 19) had a mean AE sd serum 25 (OH)D level of 20.7 AE 5.9 ng/mL, and children with severe AD (n = 16) a level of 21.5 AE 8.5 ng/mL, with no significant difference (p t-test = 0.757). The corresponding 25(OH)D mean levels were 20.6 AE 3.6 ng/mL and 17.5 AE 3.6 ng/mL in females (p t-test = 0.105), and 20.9 AE 9.0 ng/mL and 23.9 AE 9.8 ng/mL in males (p t-test = 0.538). The lack of association between serum 25(OH)D level and disease severity was independent from the season in which blood sample was collected. Person's correlation coefficients between serum 25(OH)D level and SCO-RAD were 0.03 (P = 0.849) overall, \u00c00.397 (P = 0.103) among females, and 0.081 (P = 0.756) among males. After adjustment for season, the correlation coefficient was 0.019 (P = 0.917). Conclusion: 25(OH)D level is not associated to AD severity in our pediatric population, even after controlling for season. Background: Vitamin D levels are known to be associated with development of allergic diseases. However, existing data are controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate whether vitamin D levels are associated with food sensitisation (FS) in young children with atopic dermatitis (AD) Method: We performed a medical record review of all patients under 2 year presenting to pediatric allergic clinic in Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital for atopic dermatitis between March 1, 2012 and February 28, 2013 . Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and six specific IgE to common food allergens were measured in 132 young children with AD. We defined vitamin D insufficiency was 25 (OH)D < 30 ng/mL, and FS as specific IgE \u2265 0.35 IU/mL to any of six common food allergens. Associations between serum 25(OH)D levels and FS were examined by using multiple logistic regression, adjusting for potential risk and confounding factors. Results: The mean age was 10.1 months. Among the 132 children with AD, 65.9% had FS. In this group, there was a negative correlation between 25(OH)D levels and serum eosinophil percentage,(correlation coefficient (r) = \u00c00.335, P < 0.01) but not correlated with serum total IgE levels. Children with vitamin D insufficiency were more likely to have FS (adjusted odds ratio{aOR}, 17.1; 95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.36-215; P = 0.028) than those with adequate vitamin D levels. Conclusion: Vitamin D insufficiency is associated with food sensitisation in young children with AD. Further research is needed to confirm these findings. Background: The significant relationship between atopic dermatitis (AD) and some antioxidant nutrients was reported, suggesting that antioxidant nutrients may be more sensitive markers for AD compared with other micronutrients. The low level of vitamin D3 and coenzyme Q10 were previously observed in patients with bronchial asthma and may be connected with increased asthma severity. The aim of the study was to examine whether there are differences in the serum levels of vitamin D3, coenzyme Q10 and certain chosen parameters of inflammation status (C-reactive protein, white blood count-WBC, platelet count-PLT, red blood cell distribution width -RDW, mean platelet volume -MPV, eosinophil count -EO) between children with atopic dermatitis and without allergy symptoms. Method: Eighteen children with atopic dermatitis aged from 2 to 15 years (mean age 6 years) were enrolled into the study.

No changes were seen in CoQ10 levels. Conclusion: Our results suggest a possible contribution of AD exacerbation on low concentrations of vitamin D3 and provide rationale for its supplementation in this patient group. Background: It is thought that vitamin D deficiency has a role in atopic dermatitis (AD) pathogenesis but the debate whether it is protective or predisposing still continues. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of vitamin D deficiency on AD development, severity and on related parameters. Method: To our study, 50 patients under the age of 2 who were diagnosed with AD according to Hanifin and Rajka criteria together with 50 healthy children were recruited. In addition to the demographic features of the patient and control groups, eosinophil, total IgE, specificIgE, prick test, IgG, IgM, IgA and 25(OH)D levels were evaluated. SpecificIgEor prick test positivity was considered asatopy. The level of 25(OH)D \u2265 30 ng/ml was accepted as sufficient, 21-29 ng/ml was accepted as insufficient and \u226420 ng/ml was accepted as deficient. The severity of the disease was assessed using SCORAD index. Results: There was no significant difference between the patient and control groups in terms of age, gender, duration or dose of vitamin D usage. The rate of atopy history in mothers was high in the patient group (P < 0.001). Among the patients, 56% was atopic and egg-white sensitivity had the highest frequency (36%). SCO-RAD index was higher in the atopic patients, especially in those with food sensitivity (P = 0.048). Vitamin D deficiency was detected as 22% in the patient group, and 4% in the healthy children (P = 0.028). No correlation between vitamin D deficiency and the severity or age of onset of the disease was detected (P > 0.05). Additional ectopic disease risk, eosinophil number and total IgE levels increased in the patient group as the level of vitamin D decreased. Patients with hypogammaglobulinemia were determined to be non-atopic and have lower SCORAD index comparedto patients with normogammaglobulinemia (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency was determined to have a role in AD development. Vitamin D was shown to have no effect on the severity of the disease although it represses the increase of total IgE which increases the severity of the disease. The fact that vitamin D deficiency is concurrent with the additional atopic disease in our patients reveals the need for studies that investigate the effects of vitamin D on allergic march.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results: Concentrations of vitamin D3"}, {"text": "Immunoallergological and skin microbiological profile of adolescents and adults patients with long term atopic dermatitis Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease involving skin barrier defects and immunologic deregulation.

Sensitisation to Malassezia sympodialis is specific to AD and sensitisation to hTrx could be induced due to the high cross-reactivity of Mala s 13 and hTrx. However, it is unknown why such an effective immune response is mounted against these proteins instead of maintaining tolerance especially towards hTrx. Method: We compared cytokine induction by Mala s 13 and hTrx in PBMCs, monocytes and CD4+ T cells via ELISA and RT-qPCR. Western blots were performed to identify the activated signalling pathways.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "590"}, {"text": "Results: The expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines was induced in immune cells from AD patients as well as from control donors. Whereas the Th2 cytokine IL-13 was higher in supernatants from AD patients sensitised to Malassezia species, the anti-inflammatory IL-10 was reduced compared to non-sensitised AD patients or control donors. The main source of IL-10 were monocytes, which also produced pro-inflammatory cytokines such als IL-1b and upregulated expression of the inflammasome-associated molecule NLRP3. Stimulation with Mala s 13 and hTrx resulted in phosphorylation of NF-jB and the MAP-kinase p44/42 in PBMCs. Conclusion: Both Mala s 13 and hTrx are effective inducers of innate immune responses, which might be followed by activation of adaptive responses, such as Th1, Th2, Th17 and Th22, known to play a role in the pathogenesis of AD. That way sensitisation to Mala s 13 and hTrx could contribute to disease exacerbation in the affected patients, which also showed an impaired anti-inflammatory response towards both proteins. Background: It is known that S. aureus (SA) infects skin lesions in children with AD. But other staphylococci can be also found on skin lesions. The work aimed at studying the specificity of skin colonisation with different staphylococci in children with AD. Method: The study enrolled 88 patients with AD in active phase and 5 patients with contact dermatitis (CD). The patients were averagely aged 4.2 (2 months-17 years). We mostly observed children with acute forms among which erythematosquamous forms occurred twice as often as erythematosquamous forms with lichenization did (in 58.6 and 27.6%), 3 patients (3.5%) were with exudative elements and 9 patients (10.34%) had a lichenoid form. We identified 21 patients (23.9%) with mild, 43 patients (48.9%) with moderate (48.9%) and 24 (27.3%) with severe AD. The skin smear seeding was performed on blood agar. The isolates obtained were identified according to the conventional microbiological tests. The staphyl. types were identified and their antibiotic sensitivity was tested by means of the automated microbiology analyzer 'Walka-way 96 plus', Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Germany. Results: SA and S. epidermidis (SE) were found to be the most often isolated strains. We detected SA in 43 cases (42.16%) and 13 of them were patients with severe AD, whereas SE was found in 31 (30.39%) cases with 7 severe patients (25.93%) in the group. Thirteen patients (12.75%) demonstrated no bacterial formation. In 10 cases we isolated the following coagulasenegative staphyl. strains (CNS): S. haemolyticus, S. warneri, S. hominis, S. saprophyticus and S. sciuri. No difference between SA or CNS presence and AD severe forms was recorded. CNS were more frequently revealed in acute AD, while SAequally in chronic AD with lichenization and acute AD (P = 0.081). All strains were penicillin-resistant. Eight in 29 SE strains, 1 in 4 S. haemol. and S. sciuri were oxacilin-resistant. While observing the oxacilin-resistant strains behavior we detected 3 SE strains and 1 S. aciuri strain after SA eradication in cases with moderate AD and 2 S. haemol. Strains after Acinetobacter baumanii and Streptococcus pneum. eradication in cases with severe AD. Among patients with CD 2 cases showed no bacterial formation, while the other 3 demonstrated the growth of S. haemol., SE and S. hominis.

IgE-production remained constant in 19% or was reduced in 36% of eAD. In iAD or HC, no significant IgE-production was induced by CD8-depletion. In eADpatients with less or more than 10 000 kU/ l serum IgE, CD8-reduction augmented IgE production ex vivo in 6/28 (21%) or in 9/14 cases (65%).

Background: It is known that eczema is occasionally associated with phenylketonuria. Here we present an infant with phenylketonuria who admitted to our outpatient department because of persistent eczema and consequently diagnosed as atopic dermatitis and cow's milk allergy. Case: Six-month old girl with phenylketonuria was admitted to our outpatient department with eczema in her cheek and body since she was 2-month-old. She was fed with breast milk and formula without phenylalanine but sometimes she was fed with formula containing milk. Her eczema was aggravated when she was fed with formula or food containing milk. Skin prick test was positive with egg white (3 9 3 mm of wheal) but negative to cow's milk. Egg-white specific (s) IgE was 0.89 kU/l and cow's milk sIgE was 1.99 kU/l. Egg and cow's milk were completely eliminated in her and her mother's diet and then her eczema was significantly improved. After elimination diet, oral food challenge test with cow's milk was performed when she was eighteen-month-old. She had dry cough, wheezing and persistent repetitive vomiting after 40 min of challenge test. She was treated with intramuscular epinephrine, methylprednisolone and inhaled salbutamol and her symptoms resolved within an hour. Conclusion: Eczema may accompany metabolic diseases such as phenylketonuria. Although rare, in case of persistent and/or severe eczema with metabolic diseases, concomitant food allergy should be kept in mind and additional diagnostic tests should be made. Background: The link between atopy and contact delayed type sensitisation has always intrigued researchers and clinicians.

Results: No difference between both groups in the number of positive subjects could be found (P > 0.05). However, the total number of positive reactions was twice higher in AD than in healthy volunteers. Gender and skin phototype did not differ between patch positive and negative subjects.

Method: Ninety three consecutive patients with AE from 15 to 66 years were patch tested with the Extended International Standard Series and selected allergens from preservatives, medicaments and cosmetics. Results: Forty-two patients (39%) had one or more positive allergic reactions. The most common allergens were nickel sulfate, fragrance mix, neomycin, cobalt chloride thiuram mix, balsam of Peru and potassium dichromate. Twenty three (25%) reacted to topical preparations, among these, 7 (7.5%) reacted to topical steroids, including hydrocortisone-17 hydroxybutyrate, tixocortol pivalate and clobetasol. Contact sensitisation was more frequent among patients with severe and long lasting AE. Conclusion: The study demonstrated the importance of contact sensitivity as a concomitant or aggravating factor of the clinical dermatitis in atopic patients. We recommend that routine patch testing should be included in the diagnostic workup of AE patients, especially those with severe and refractory disease. Introduction: Allergic cheilitis to lipcare stick is well-known, particularly with balsam of Peru. We report 2 cases of allergic cheilitis from a lipstick due to a so far unknown other allergen, Polysilicone-15 (Parsol \u00e2 SLX), a UVB sunscreen agent. Methods: A 14-yo girl and an 83-yo male presented with acute cheilitis, extending around to the peri-oral skin. They had been using a lipcare stick (Dermophil \u00e2 ) several times a day for 2 months because of chapped lips. Patch tests (PT) were performed on their backs with the European baseline series and their own cosmetics, with two readings on D3 and D4. Both of them also had subsequent PT with the 10 ingredients of the stick provided by the manufacturer. Results: Both patients had a positive reaction to the lipstick (++/++) and the girl also had a fragrance mix I (++/++) and nickel (+/+) reaction, both with previous relevance. Among the lipstick ingredients, Parsol \u00e2 SLX showed a positive reaction in both patients (+++/+++). As no previous report of allergic contact dermatitis from this sunscreen agent could be found in the literature, we wondered if the manufacturer had not mistaken it for Parsol MCX i.e. ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, which is a well-known allergen. After performing the necessary checks, the manufacturer confirmed that the true name was Parsol SLX and sent us another sample. The two patients had subsequent PT with the second sample of Parsol SLX and the sunscreen agents series as well. The only positive patch test in both patients was Parsol SLX. Conclusion: To our knowledge, we report the first cases of allergic contact dermatitis to the sunscreen agent Parsol SLX.

Introduction: Allergic contact reactions according to hair dyes arrise mostly due to the sensitisation of para-phenylenediamine (PPD). PPD a derivative of p-nitroanaline is widely used as an oxidizable hair dye and also found in black henna tattoo. PPD causes local as well as systemic toxic effects when applied topically and/or ingested. Subsequent exposure PPD may lead to delayed type-IV hipersensitivity reaction manifesting as acute allergic dermatitis. We present a 15-year old girl with delayed hipersensitivity reactions after first exposure to hair dye who have been found to be sensitised before by a black henna tatto to PPD. Case: A 15-year-old girl was admitted to emergency department with a history of neck and facial swelling 3 days after the first hair dye has been made. Her physical examination was normal except for severe edema which beginning from neck extending to the ear, eyelids, forehead and scalp and a slight eczamatous reaction limited to frontal hair line was present The patient also had medical history of allergic contact dermatitis after use of temporary black henna tattoo before 3 years. We started peroral 1 mg/kg metilprednisolone and second generation H1 antihistaminic treatment. The patient was patch tested with European standart series after the neck and facial edema recovered completely. A strong positive reaction (+++) to PPD was observed. Patient was informed about avoid hair dye products and black henna tattoo that may contain PPD or para-dye ingredients. We provide a list of products that may contain PPD to the patient. Conclusion: Para phenylenediamine is a potential danger especially for children and adeloscents because of increasing use hair dye and temporary henna tattoo in this age group. Physicians and parents should be informed about the risk of hair dyes and tattoos that contain PPD and laws should prevent its use in different hair dye formulations and tattoos. Emergency physicians must be aware of possibility of allergic contact dermatitis from hair dyes and temporary henna tattoos.

It has antipyretic, antimalarial and analgesic properties. It has been widely used as a treatment for different pathologies and as a hair strengthener in various cosmetic products. Given its scarce use in the last years, quinine is currently considered an uncommon allergen. Method: A 33-year-old woman diagnosed with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis due to pollens presents with symptoms of scalp pruritus and bullous lesions with serous exudate that resolved with application of topical steroids for 3 days. No previous similar episodes reported. She related the symptoms with the application of a shampoo and serum used regularly for the past 3 months. Allergy study included patch testing with standard battery (Stallergenes), cosmetics battery (BIAL Aristegui), shampoo and serum (supplied by the patient) and 25% Quinine Sulfate (BIAL Aristegui). Results: Intense skin reaction (++++) at 48-72-96 h with shampoo, serum and 25% Quinine Sulfate. Conclusion: We report a case of quinineinduced contact dermatitis. Despite being an uncommon allergen, it is important to be considered and included in the study of patients with scalp eczema so as to reach an adequate diagnosis. Background: Transdermal nitroglycerin (NT) patch is cause of irritant contact dermatitis, contact dermatitis, urticaria, and widespread cutaneous reactions. Incidence of allergic contact dermatitis is small and usually local. The risk of systemic contact dermatitis after an oral administration is extremelly low, but exist.

Disperse dyes do not chemically bond to the fibers, and their small, liophilic molecules can therefore easily migrate onto the skin of the person who is wearing the garment, especially if the textile fastness is poor; they may be removed by exposure to water. This circumstance could explain why our patient presented dermatitis after bathing and not with regular clothes even orange-colored ones.

Skin patch testing is the gold standard in the diagnosis of ACD. After a complete medical history (complaints, professions, hobbies, etc.) , and physical exam, clinician should concerned with the cost-effectiveness and physicians can apply patch tests involving less allergens. This application will also reduce the risk of sensitisation to new allergens, that the patients have never met before.

Henna is often used with other coloring substances such as para-phenylenediaminen (PPD). PPD intensifies dark color and makes the tattoo last longer. It has high allergenity and may cause contact dermatit. We report a 14 year old boy who developed allergic contact bullous dermatit after having the name his girl friend on his forearm. Our patient was patch tested with European Standard series which investigated 28 allergens. Strong positive reaction (++++) to PPD was observed in our patient's patch test. Patient was informed about avoid black henna tattoo that may contain PPD or para-dye ingredients. We provide a list of products that may contain PPD to the patient. The lesion was partially resolved with systemic steoid, antihistaminic and topical steroid therapy. Background: The skin prick test (SPT) is a standard method in allergy diagnostics. In the daily routine, the use of conventional metal prick lancets was compared with a novel multiple allergen applicator, for patients aged below 18 years and for adults. Method: In suspected cases of allergy and suitability for testing (71 children/adolescents, aged 5-17; 273 adults, aged 18-67) a SPT was performed pursuant to the German guideline for skin tests (Ru\u20ac eff F et al. 2010) using metal prick lancets on one forearm and CLUSTO-Prick (ROXALL Medizin, Germany) on the other, each involving two controls and six different allergen extracts. Patients or accompanying persons were asked for sensation of pain, satisfaction and recommendation. The mean wheal diameters were documented as negative (=0 mm), doubtful (<3 mm) or positive (\u22653 mm) test results. Identical or divergent assessments were determined for the non-negative results (doubtful or positive in at least one system). Labour and working time for both systems were compared by the physicians on a 5-point rating scale (\u00c02 to +2). Results: The sensation of pain using CLU-STO-Prick compared with using lancets was lower or equal in 76.1% respectively 19.7% of children/adolescents and 71.1% respectively 23.8% of adults. Of all children/adolescents 85.9% were more and 11.3% equally satisfied with CLUSTO-Prick, of adults 91.6% respectively 6.6%. The rates of recommendation were 95.8% and 98.5%, respectively. Of the non-negative results (n = 95 for children/adolescents; n = 425 for adults) 94.7% respectively 97.2% were identical in both test systems. Much less labour and working time was rated by the majority of physicians in favour of CLU-STO-Prick, and more distinct test results. Conclusion: The multiple allergen applicator CLUSTO-Prick is beneficial for patients of both age groups reflected by less sensation of pain, more satisfaction, distinct test results and reduction of working time to perform a skin prick test. Background: The skin prick test is a standard method in allergy diagnostics. For adults, the use of metal prick lancets was compared in the daily routine with a multiple allergen applicator. Method: In suspected cases of allergy and suitability for testing (273 adults, aged 18-67) a skin prick test was performed pursuant to the German guideline for skin tests (Ru\u20ac eff F et al. 2010 ) by use of metal prick lancets on one and CLUSTO-Prick (ROX-ALL Medizin, Germany) on the other forearm. Non-negative test results in both systems were classified by the mean wheal diameters for three allergens (grass mix, n = 156; birch, n = 109; D. pteronyssinus, n = 77) as negative (0 mm), doubtful (<3 mm) or positive (\u22653 mm, subdivided 1+ to 4+). Identical or divergent assessments and the final statements (negative in only one system, doubtful, positive as summarized) were determined. Sensation of pain, satisfaction and recommendation were compared for male (n = 142, mean age 36.7) and female (n = 131, mean age 35.1) patients. Results: The classifications of non-negative test results were equal or higher in favour of CLUSTO-Prick in 63.5% respectively 35.2% for grass mix, in 64.2% respectively 34% for birch and in 63.6% respectively 32.5% for D. pteronyssinus. The final statements were equal in 100% for grass mix, 95.4% for birch and 96.1% for D. pteronyssinus. In one case for birch allergen the result with the lancet was negative and with CLUSTO-Prick positive, with a positive anamnesis. The sensation of pain using CLUSTO-Prick compared with using lancets was in 72.6% lower for male and 69.5% for female adults. Ninety-three pecent of men were more satisfied with CLUSTO-Prick and 90.1% of women. The rates of recommendation by males and females for the novel system were 98.6% and 98.5%, respectively.

H1 antihistamines represent a therapeutic option in all forms of allergic rhinitis. They reduce the specific symptoms of allergic rhinitis, but some compounds may also reduce the chronic inflammation of nasal mucosa. We evaluated the serum level of some cytokines involved in inflammatory process in patients with persistent allergic rhinitis (PAR) before and after 4week treatment with H1 antihistamines. Method: Eighty-five patients with PAR, mean age 29.91 AE 9.92 years were included in the study. The patients were under treatment with Desloratadine (Des) 5 mg/day (41pts) or Levocetirizine (Lev) 5 mg/day (44pts) for 4 weeks. The patients were clinically and biologically evaluated before and after the treatment. There were noticed rhinitis symptoms (presence and severity), type of sensitisation (indoor or outdoor allergens), serum levels of total IgE and eosinophils counts, serum level of IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-a. Results: Patients with PAR presented high levels of total IgE, eosinophils, IL-8 and TNF-a compared to healthy volunteers. Both antihistamines reduce all the symptoms of allergic rhinitis, including nasal congestion, Lev being more effective on nasal congestion compared to Des (P = 0.05). H1 antihistamines reduce the serum level of IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-a after 4 weeks of treatment. The reduction of cytokines was not influenced by the duration or severity of rhinitis and the type of sensitisation.

Lev has a better effect in decreasing the symptoms and serum cytokines. The aim of our study was to compare the effect of fexofenadine (F) vs ceterizine (C) on skin prick test (SPT). Method: Sixty atopic patients divided in three groups were enrolled. SPT were performed before and after 24 h from the administration either of 180 mg F or 10 mg C, and placebo (P) in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. The area of edema was measured 20 min after SPT and expressed as square mm. Percent of the inhibition of histamine and allergens induced effect, after treatment, was calculated from the values estimated at baseline. Results: A significant reduction of histamine edema area was obtained in 12 patients who received F (61%) vs patients who received C (6pts, 30%) or P (5 pts, 25%). Allergens edema area were also significantly reduced in all patients who received F (20 pts, 100%) vs 13 patients (66%) who received C or 5 patients with P (25%). Conclusion: Fexofenadine was more efficient in reducing the edema induced by allergen than the edema induced by histamine. Fexofenadine is more efficient than ceterizine in reducing the edema and flare of SPT to histamine and allergens after 24 h from administration. Methods: An electronic medical records review of grass pollen AIT prescriptions (ATC code: V01AA02) written for >6000 pedaitric allergic rhinitis patients from 2005 to 2012 was conducted using IMS Disease Analyzer. Pediatric patients were defined as <18 years of age. Administration modality was determined by the first prescription identified during each prescribing year (September-August). Results: The pediatric population use of SLIT-tablets has increased from 9% of total AIT initiations in 2008 to 25% of total AIT initiations in 2009 with the same level in the following years. The average age for AIT initiation was 12.1 years (SD 3.24). Within the pediatric population, the largest prescribers of SIT were pediatric and ENT specialists (together accounting for 65% of prescriptions). The largest prescribers of SLIT-tablets were ENT specialists (43%). Pediatricians were the leading prescribers of SCIT, with >80% of their patients initiating AIT with SCIT (in the overall study period and for those initiating treatment most recently in 2012). Conclusion: The majority of pediatric AIT patients are receiving SCIT despite availability of SLIT-tablets in Germany. Although the SLIT-tablet may be a more convenient treatment option, providers may prefer to prescribe SCIT rather than a single allergen tablet for children who experience sensitivities to multiple allergens.

When analyzed by product it was noted that SQ-standardised grass SLIT-tablet, GRAZAX \u00e2 (Phleum pratense 75 000 SQ-T/2,800 BAU, ALK, Denmark) had a clear peak in first prescriptions in Sep-Nov of the prescribing year, similar to SCIT patterns but of lower magnitude (Figure 1 ). The 300IR 5-grass SLIT-tablet (Oralair), indicated for pre-co season treatment, had highest peak of first prescriptions in Jan-Mar of each prescribing year; however, a second peak indicated a large proportion of patients received first 5-grass SLIT-tablet prescription in the Sep-Dec period.

A statistically significant increase in the proportion of patients prescribed SLIT-tablets was observed, from 8% (2006/07) to 29% (2011/12) (P < 0.001). The proportion of patients prescribed SCIT therapies declined from 87% to 67% (P < 0.001), while use of SLIT-drops was rare (~4% of patients annually) from 2006/ 07 to 2011/12. Similar trends were observed for both children and adults. Conclusion: The proportion of patients prescribed SLIT-tablets increased significantly following their introduction to the market. Despite this increase, SCIT remained the primary modality prescribed to patients with grass pollen allergies over the study period. This may be due to a preference of providers to prescribe SCIT to treat sensitivities to multiple allergens rather than prescribe a single allergen tablet. Background: There are gaps in our knowledge of the patient path from diagnosis to treatment and beyond. This survey aimed to assess AR diagnosis, treatment, concerns and expectations for the future from the patient perspective in Italy. Method: Doxa Pharma interviewed a sample of AR patients (attending a participating specialist centre for the first time) by computer assisted telephone interview. Results: Five hundred and fifty-two AR patients were interviewed (52% male, mean age: 32 years, mean duration of diagnosis: 5 years). The most frequently reported symptoms were sneezing (73%), rhinorrhea (68%) congestion (63%) and nasal itch (56%). GPs first suspected AR in 40% of cases, but 31% of patients said they suspected AR themselves. Specialists made the formal diagnosis in 79% of cases. On average patients used 1.7 AR products. Multiple AR therapies were used by 55% of patients (dual therapy: 36%; triple therapy 13%; >3 therapies: 6%).

Sixty-one pecent were concerned their health could deteriorate, with 59% worrying about the onset of other disease, most notably asthma (81% of patients). Finally, patients' main expectations for the future were to manage and ease their AR symptoms (45%) and be cured (22%). Conclusion: Almost 50% of patients are not satisfied with their AR treatment, even those on multiple therapies. More effective therapies such as an advanced intranasal delivery system of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate can now be recommended (pharmacists) and prescribed (physicians) to better manage moderate to severe AR. Background: Many allergic rhinitis (AR) patients self-medicate and combine over the counter products at the pharmacy.

Method: Doxa Pharma interviewed 100 pharmacists by computer assisted telephone interview, asking questions on (i) AR diagnosis (ii) treatment and (iii) knowledge of the guidelines. Results: Pharmacists were mostly male (54%mean age: 54 years), reportedly seeing 75 AR patients/month on average. Eye watering was considered most indicative of AR followed by sneezing, congestion and rhinorrhea. Seventy-six pecent understood that AR could lead to asthma if not treated in a timely manner.

Only 46% of pharmacists reported referring AR patients to a doctor, most commonly to a GP. Knowledge of, and willingness to refer to specialist centres was low. Conclusion: Pharmacists are the gatekeepers in AR management. Currently, referral to doctors is low and recommendation of oral AH is high. Future guidelines and education programs must also recognise pharmacists as their target audience and provide tools to simplify AR assessment (e.g. visual analogue score) and treatment so that pharmacists can recommend the most recent and effective treatment options (e.g. an advanced intranasal delivery system of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate) for patients who are known to have moderate to severe AR.

Method: Doxa Pharma interviewed 100 pharmacists by computer assisted telephone interview, asking questions specific to their last AR case on AR severity and treatment. Results: Last reported AR cases were mostly female (81%; mean age: 36 years) presenting with eye watering (45%) and nasal obstruction (41%) predominantly. According to pharmacists, their last patient case had moderate disease (5.2 out of 10 on average [1 = not severe at all; 10 = very severe]). Only 27% of patients presented with a prescription, the majority (55%) asking for a treatment recommendation or for a specific treatment (18%). If asked, 67% said they recommended an antihistamine (AH), 20% a vasoconstrictor, 9% a nasal corticosteroid, 4% a homeopathic product and 2% eye drops. When asked for a recommendation, only 7% of pharmacists reported referral to a doctor. Conclusion: Italian pharmacists, recommended AH to the majority of AR patients, despite patient severity and the limited effect of oral AH on nasal obstruction. Eye drop recommendation was low despite eye watering being reported as the most common presenting symptom. It is important that pharmacists are able to accurately assess AR disease severity, consider the predominant presenting symptom pattern and make guideline-informed treatment recommendations which triggers referral to a doctor in the majority of cases. Allergy societies must develop AR guidelines and education programs for pharmacists and provide tools to simplify AR assessment (e.g. visual analogue scale) and treatment so that they can recommend the most recent and effective treatment options (e.g. an advanced intranasal delivery system of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate) for their patients with moderate/severe AR.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "611"}, {"text": "Allergic rhinitis diagnosis, treatment and impact on patients in Italy: the GP perspective Background: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a chronic disease which is increasing in prevalence and becoming more difficult to treat.

For raw milk, an SPT wheal size 100% larger than 1% histamine control predicted a positive OFC reaction. (P < 0.05) Family responses: Out of 103 OFCs, 59.46% of families replied to the survey. Of these 63.6% found the OFC very useful, 18.18% somewhat useful, 11.36% somewhat useless. 65.9% of parents were satisfied with the OFC, 20.45% somewhat satisfied, and 2.27% completely dissatisfied. Qualitative themes from the family survey were: Satisfied because they now know their children's allergies and what to expect; Happy with the services pro-vided; Concerns about no clear or delayed follow up; Unclear instructions by nurses at time of challenge; wish to give bigger dose of food allergen as answer inconclusive. Nurse responses: Seventy-five percent of the nurses who responded were somewhat dissatisfied with the procedure and only 25% nurses felt satisfied. Main concern was lack of defined point at which to stop the challenge. Conclusion: OFCs performed in controlled settings by trained professionals are safe. To our knowledge, there is currently no standardised and systematic method to perform the OFC and store results in in public hospitals within NZ. Guidelines need to be modified for children undergoing OFC. Raw milk SPT appears to better predict a positive OFC compared to milk allergen and other raw food SPTs should be trialled. Background: Yellow pea has recently been introduced into the food supply. Cases of anaphylactic shocks were reported due to yellow pea (Dreyer et al., 2013) . The aim of this study is to compare threshold dose of yellow pea to other allergens of the same family of legumes: peanuts, lupine and soja. Methodology: Eight patient files with confirmed food allergy to yellow pea were studied. These patients benefited from skin prick tests, serum IgEs levels and food challenge tests were performed in order to determine threshold level of yellow pea. We compared the threshold level of yellow pea to the threshold level of lupine, soja and peanuts. Threshold levels were compared in mg of protein equivalent: (53% for soy flour, 36.2% for lupine flour, 25% for whole peanut) (Taylor et al., 2014) . Introduction: The nematode Anisakis simplex causes not only the zoonotic disease anisakiasis but also allergic reactions after seafood ingestion in mainly the coastal areas of Europe and Japan. Twelve Anisakis allergens have been registered to date, but the prevalence of IgE among them is not clear.

Results: Five patients developed gastrointestinal symptoms, one of whom was diagnosed with gastric anisakiasis by endoscopy. Three patients experienced anaphylactic shock. In the ImmunoCAP for A. simplex, all patients were positive and five patients' titers were over 100 UA/mL. In the IgE-immunoblotting with the crude extract of A. simplex, several bands were detected in the range from approx. 10 kDa to >100 kDa. In the ELISA, the highest rate of positive responses was for Ani s 11 (16/17, 94.1%), followed by Ani s 12 (15/ 17, 88.2%), Ani s 5 (10/17, 58.8%), Ani s 6 (10/17, 58.8%), Ani s 1 (9/17, 52.9%), Ani s 8 (7/17.41.2%), Ani s 9 (7/ 17.41.2%), Ani s 4 (6/17, 35.3%) and Ani s 3 (3/17, 17.6%). One patient with a history of gastric anisakiasis showed IgE response to Ani s 1 more strongly than the other patients. Conclusions: Newly identified allergens such as Ani s 11 and Ani s 12 might be more strongly relevant to Anisakis allergy than classical allergens such as Ani s 3, tropomyosin, and the sensitisation of Ani s 1, a secretory gland-derived enzyme, might be related to anisakiasis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods: Seventeen"}, {"text": "Predictive performance of specific IgE assay for oral food challenge outcomes in young children with suspected egg allergy -IPAD3 g study Background: Food allergy symptoms change with time especially in young children.

Background: Pru p 3, a Lipid transfer protein (LTP), is the major peach allergen. LTPs are plant food and pollen panallergens that can cause mild to severe allergic reactions. In peach allergy and LTP syndrome diagnosis, it is frequent to evaluate serum Pru p 3 specific IgE (sIgE) by Im-munoCAP (ThermoFisher Scientific, Sweden), an immunoassay with a detection limit of 0.1 kU/l and a cut-off traditionally set at 0.35 kU/l.

Background: House dust mite (HDM) and shrimp allergies are common. Double sensitisation to both allergens frequently occurs in areas with high HDM exposure and high shrimp consumption. Identification of primary sensitisation is important regarding proper allergen selection for immunotherapy and appropriate advice for food elimination. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of component resolved diagnostic (CRD) in the diagnosis of shrimp allergy in patients with house dust mite sensitisation. Method: Sixty-six patients with HDM sensitisation, with and without shrimp allergy were enrolled. Skin prick test (SPT), specific IgE (sIgE) to Der p and shrimp extract and sIgE to allergen components: nDer p1, rDer p10 and rPen a1 were performed. Results: Patients were divided into 3 groups according to clinical presentations; respiratory allergy, shrimp allergy and patient with both allergies. (44% vs 7% vs 49%, respectively). Twenty patients (54%) with shrimp allergy had anaphylaxis. Sensitisation profiles to HDM and shrimp components were different among the groups according to clinical presentations.

Despite comparable skin prick test wheal sizes to HDM and shrimp extracts, patients with respiratory allergy without shrimp allergy had significantly higher sIgE levels to nDer p1 compared with patients with shrimp allergy (5.68 vs 0.2 kUA/l) and had lower sIgE levels to rPen a1(0.04 vs 8.34 kUA/l). In patients with shrimp allergy, median levels of sIgE to rPen a1 were not different between anaphylactic and non-anaphylactic groups.

The diagnostic value of sIgE to Ara h 6, another 2S albumin, has so far only been studied in a case-control design. Our aim was to assess the diagnostic value of sIgE to Ara h 6 in an adult population suspected of peanut allergy in a cross-sectional design and to compare that with Ara h 2. Methods: Subjects with a suspected peanut allergy were included between 2003 and 2013 if a diagnostic double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge with peanut was performed. sIgE to Ara h 2 and Ara h 6 was measured by ImmunoCAP ISAC (Uppsala, Sweden) using serum that was collected during routine clinical practice.

Methods: Fifty adults allergic to peanuts (PA) with clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis, 22 sensitised (PS) and 22 controls (C) between the age 18-60 years old were recruited both retrospectively and prospectively into the study. Thirty-nine patients in the PA-group as well twenty patients in the PS-group were also sensitised to birch pollen. All patients and controls were investigated with SPT. Blood tests were taken for assessment of IgE for peanut and birch sensitisation, total IgE and for the basophil activation test (Basoflow Kit, Exbio). Results: The basophil response to peanut was significantly higher in patients with fistory of anaphylaxis to peanuts compared with patients sensitised to peanuts (P < 0.001). Both PA and PS groups were significantly more reactive than healthy controls which showed no basophil response to peanut. The median total IgE in PA-group was 380 kU/l, in PS-group 200 kU/l and in controls 17.5 kU/l. The median of sIgE for peanut was in in PAgroup 59.5 kU/l, in PS-group 2.45 kU/l and in controls 0.0 kU/l. There was only a weak correlation between the peanut specific IgE (r = 0.35 P = 0.014) and the basophil response to peanut in the PA group and no correlation in the PS group. There was no correlation with SPT response or the total IgE levels and the BAT response in any of the groups. Conclusions: BAT is helpful in determining the severity of peanut allergy and may be used as a complementary diagnostic tool to increase the accuracy in the diagnosis of severe peanut allergy in adults, without the need to investigate further with an open peanut challenge. Background: Sunflower seeds (Helianthus annuus) can trigger anaphylactic reactions, generalised urticaria, angioedema, oral allergy syndrome and other symptoms after ingestion. These reactions have been attributed to 2S albumins (SFA-8) and LTP (Hel a 3) . We aimed to characterise the basophil response to storage proteins and oleosins from sunflower seed in patients allergic to sunflower. Method: The proteins 2S, 11S and oleosins were purified from a raw sunflower seed extract by FPLC/HPLC and identified by specific antibodies and peptide mass fingerprinting. We tested the immunological recognition of these proteins by basophil activation test (BAT). Four concentrations (1, 0.1, 0.01 lg/ml) of each protein and the sunflower roasted extract were used. Ten patients were selected by clinical history and skin prick test positive to commercial extract. Five subjects with skin prick test negative to commercial extract and not food allergy were included as controls. Results: All patients showed a positive basophil response to roasted extract. BAT was positive in 87.5% of cases for 2S albumin, 60% for oleosins, and 57.14% for 11S albumin. Fifty pecent of patients were positive to the 3 proteins, 37.5% only for 2S albumin and 12.5% for storage proteins (both 2S and 11S albumin). In 40% of controls the concentration 1 lg/ml of 2S albumin induced low basophil activation. Conclusion: All the sunflower allergens tested in our group of patients were able to induce basophil activation in a high percentage of cases. Storage proteins and oleosins are responsible for sunflower allergy in 50% of cases. Background: Epitope identification provides information essential for understanding antigen components involved in food allergic reactions. In the present study, an in-silico approach is employed to map IgE binding epitopes of major and minor peanut allergens. Method: B cell epitopes were identified for Arachis hypogaea allergens Ara h 1 to 11 using ten web-servers, five each for continuous and discontinuous epitopes. Three dimensional structure was generated for three allergens -Ara h 8, 9 & 10 by homology modeling. The linear predicted epitopes were analysed for PD values by SDAP database and compared with other regions on the basis of different physiochemical discriminators like polarity, hydrophilicity & surface accessibility in terms of percentage of number of residues. Results: Eight of Ara h 1, three of Ara h 2 and two of Ara h 3, in silico predicted B cell epitopes overlapped with the experimentally identified regions. Further, twenty-six linear and eighteen conformational epitopes were predicted by a combination of methods for Ara h 5 to 11. Majority of the predicted residues were present in the coil regions and the highest percentage of hydrophilic residues were observed for Ara h 6 (70.49%). The absolute solvent accessiblity for all the B cell epitopes was > 70% indicating antibody recognition. Property distance index calculated for the predicted epitopes using SDAP showed that six linear epitopes shared similarity with soybean, hazel nut, tomato, maize, apple, sesame, capsicum, banana etc. allergens. These findings suggest that the identified regions may share cross reactivity with some of the known food allergens or may act as novel antigenic determinants. Conclusion: B-cell epitopes of A. hypogea allergens were identified by in silico methods and predicted epitopes of Ara h 1, 2 & 3 correlated well with the experimentally identified regions. This approach may be used to delineate epitopes for other allergens. Background: Peanut and hazelnut are common elicitors of food allergic reactions.

Background: Allergy to wheat can manifest in different forms: sensitisation to ingested wheat via the gastrointestinal tract can cause traditional food allergy or in combination with exercise, Wheat-Dependent Exercise-Induced Anaphylaxis (WDEIA). Sensitisation to inhaled wheat flour may lead to occupational rhinitis and/or asthma. Methods: We retrospectively investigated 156 patients (age 0.7-73 years) with a case history of wheat allergy. The population was divided into three groups, I: wheat allergy elicited by ingestion of wheat, II: by inhalation and III: WDEIA. All were examined with detailed case history, specific IgE (s-IgE), (Thermofischer AB, Swe-den), Skin Prick Test (SPT) and wheat challenge (nasal or oral AE exercise). Results:: Group I: Twenty one of 95 patients were challenge positive (15 children, 6 adults). All positive children had atopic dermatitis and 90% also other food allergies. All outgrew their wheat allergy (median age for acquisition of tolerance, 1.9 years).

Conclusion: Wheat allergy can manifest as different disease entities, rendering a detailed case history mandatory in each patient. Patient age, occupation and concomitant allergies (food or inhalant) are important factors for evaluation. Background: The uncertainty of nut and peanut sensitisation as well as allergies has increased. The misinterpretation of skinand IgE-test in addition to case history may result in the characterisation of some patients as allergics. Investigation with food challenges is time and resource con-suming, but may help to set an accurate diagnosis, if the suspected food has been avoided due to positive test results and/or history of milder subjective symptoms. Method: The aim was to retrospectively investigate all open food challenges to peanuts, almonds and other nuts with regard to specific IgE sensitisation profile to these foods and suspected symptoms. All food challenges were performed during 2009-2013 and involved peanuts, hazelnuts, almonds and cashew. The challenges were not performed on research basis and therefore only skin-and IgE-tests for native allergens were taken into account. Results: Two hundred and forty-three challenges were performed on 168 patients. Thirty-one pecent were male. The mean age was 31 years. Hazelnut challenge was the most common (120) followed by peanut (92), almond (22) and cashew-nut (9). The suspected clinical symptoms were classified as follows: oral allergic symptoms (OAS) (n:152, of which 107 with co-existent sensitisation to birch pollen), anxiety/ never eaten (ANX) (n:61), asthma (ASTH) (n:9), gastrointestinal symptoms (GI) (n:9), suspected anaphylaxis (SAN) (n:6) and urticaria (URC) (n:6). Almost all challenges in ANX-group (61/62) were negative. In OAS-group 56/152 performed challenges were negative. Out of all 243 challenges 140 turned out negative (56%). Of the 73 positive challenges, all patients experienced mild symptoms related to OAS while 5 cases presented symptoms also from other organs in addition to oral symptoms without developing full anaphylaxis. The titers of IgE-sensitisation were correlated to challenge outcome. Allergen components were not part of routine allergy investigation regularly while their evidence based clinical usage was not proved to be sufficient until now. Conclusion: Anxiety and mild OAS symptoms seem to be related with un-necessary strict dietary avoidance of peanuts and other nuts which may arise from co-existent birch pollen sensitisation. There were no severe reactions during the challenges despite the patient history. Background: Several reports have shown contradictory results in the diagnosis of quinolone hypersensitivity and the cross reactivity between different quinolones. Our aim is to detect the importance of in vivo diagnostic tests in diagnosis of quinolone allergy and to evaluate the cross reactivity between different quinolones including novel quinolone gemifloxacin. Method: We studied 17 patients who had experienced hypersensitivity reactions due to different quinolones. After detailed clinical history, prick and intradermal skin tests (STs) and single placebo controlled drug provocation tests (DPT) were done with the culprit and the alternative quinolones including ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moksifloxacin, ciprofloxacin and gemifloxacin. The patients who experienced anaphylaxis were not provocated with the culprit drug. Results: Twelve (70%) patients suffered from immediate reactions and 5 (30%) experienced late reactions with quinolones in history. Only one patient had allergic reactions to two different quinolones including ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Fifteen out of 17 ST results were negative with the culprit drug, however 7 out of 9 DPTs with the culprit drug were positive. A total of 68 STs with alternative drugs were applied and only 2 tests were positive whereas DPTs were negative in these two. Thirteen out of 65 DPTs were positive with alternative drugs. Among these reactions 7 appeared in only two patients. One of these two patients had reported a fixed drug eruption with both ciprofloxasin and ofloxasin and experienced the same reaction with the other three quinolones during DPT. The other patient had experienced an immediate reaction with gemifloxacin and experienced the same reaction with other four quinolones. Conclusion: These preliminary results suggest that STs are not helpful in the diagnosis of quinolone allergy and in the prediction of cross reactivity.

Most reported reactions to proton pump inhibitors are immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Skin prick and intradermal tests may be useful in immediate reactions and diagnosis of potential cross-reactivity. The basophil activation test (BAT) is a useful tool in the in-vitro diagnosis of immediate hypersensitivity reactions to drugs. Recently it has been proposed that basophil activation test (BAT) could be helpful in the diagnosis of IgE-mediated allergic reactions to PPIs. Aim: To assess the role of BAT in the diagnosis of PPI-related immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Methods: Nine patients diagnosed of immediate hypersensitivity reaction to PPIs based on the results of skin tests and oral challenge tests, were selected. We perform BAT in our patients and in several controls with: Omeprazole 2, 0.2 and 0.02 mg/ml, Pantoprazole 2, 0.2 and 0.02 mg/ml, Lansoprazole 2, 0.2 and 0.02 mg/ml, Rabep-razole 2, 0.2, 0.02 mg/ml and Esomeprazole 2, 0.2, 0.02 mg/ml. BAT was performed by flow cytometry FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, Aalst, Belgium) using CD63 expression as the activation marker and anti-IgE antibody as the basophil marker. Results were considered positive when the stimulation index was greater than 2. Results: BAT was negative in all controls. Six patients were diagnosed by skin test and 3 by drug challenge tests.

There is heighted awareness about the symptoms and potential consequences of drug allergies by both doctors and patients. It is likely that drug allergies will be increasing further. The first and oldest method of prevention of allergic (and pseudoallergic) reactions is anamnesis. But if it 0 s not always true? Aim: To estimate the usefulness of allergic anamnesis and skin tests for prevention of drug allergy to iodinated contrast agents. Method: The survey included 64 patients aged between 15 and 65 years. The average age was 52.0 AE 2.6 years; 59.4% of men and 40.6% of women with a diagnosis of 'ischemic coronary artery disease' for whom a coronary angiography intervention was justified. Anamnesis was carried out, after it epicutaneous, prick and intradermal tests for Vizipaque, Omnipaque, Ulravist were performed consequentially. The study was conducted in 2 groups: 40 patients without a complicated allergic anamnesis (group A) and 24 patients with anamnesis of drug allergy to other drugs (not iodinate contrasts)group B. In case of positive result of in vivo tests the patient gets another contrast agent for cardiac intervention, which result was negative. Results: It was determined that after the in vivo diagnostics 5.0% of patients in group A were positive for one of the drugs delivered in skin sample, while in group B they made 4.2%. The difference was not reliable (P > 0.05). No one of the patients had an allergic reaction after the intervention (except for a slight skin itching). Conclusion: In this way, it is established that modern iodinated contrast agents are relatively safe medicines. The relative risk of developing a positive in vivo tests results on iodinated contrast agents does not depend on available allergic reactions to other drugs in the anamnesis. Allergy tests in vivo allow carrying out prevention of drug allergy (pseudoallergy) to iodinated contrast agents in hospital setting during coronary angiography intervention. Background: Non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely prescribe in daily practice and their use for self-medication is also frecuent. Therefore, they are considered one of the most frequently reasons for adverse drug reactions. Often, the diagnosis of hypersensitivity to NSAIDs is exclusively made by clinical history due to the absence of diagnostic tests in-vivo and in-vitro. The provocation tests are considered the gold standard for diagnosis. Hence, the aim of this study was to value the clinical history as a diagnostic method in patients with a skin reaction history after taking ibuprofen. Method: A descriptive, observational study is presented in 44 cases related to suspected ibuprofen hypersensitivity. Patients recruited in the study (between October 2012 and May 2013) were older than 18 years of age and had hives and/or angioedema history immediately after taking ibuprofen. The skin prick test was per-formed with ibuprofen. Subsequently, oral provocation with ibuprofen to 600 mg was carried out. In case of a positive result, the study was completed with an oral ASA provocation made up to dose of 1 g. Results: From the 44 patients involved, 43.2% reported hives, 20.4% hives and angioedema, 22.7% only angioedema and 13.6% itching. All resulted in negative skin test with ibuprofen. 88.6% (39 patients) had negative oral challenge with ibuprofen and allergy was ruled out. Four of the remaining 5 patients showed positive oral ASA provocation, being diagnosed intolerance to NSAIDs. The fifth one had negative oral challenge and was diagnosed as arylpropionic acid allergy. Conclusion: The medical history may overestimate ibuprofen hypersensitivity.

However, the negative predictive value (NPV) of ICM skin testing remains uncertain. An initial study by our group in 159 patients, suggested a NPV of ICM skin testing of 96.6% (95% CI, 89.9-103.2). Here, we present data of the continuation phase of this prospective single center study. Method: During a 5.5 year period (July 2008 -January 2014), patients with a previous reaction to ICM who had positive ST for one or more ICM, were called and asked standardised questions about ICM re-exposure and information was retrieved from their medical records. Results: Forty-eight out of 445 patients tested, had one or more positive ST (10.8%). Response rate amongst these patients was 81.3% (39/48 patients) and 3 patients were included based on medical records only. There were 61.9% females, 7.1% had asthma, 35.7% were atopic, and the median age was 61 years (range 13-90). Interestingly, 8 patients had never been exposed to ICM before their first reaction. Initial reactions to ICM were immediate in 29/42 (69.0%) patients (of which 5/29 had grade I, 6/29 grade II, 17/ 29 grade III and 1/29 grade IV anaphylaxis, according to the Ring and Messmer classification), non-immediate in 12/42 (28.6%) patients and of unknown chronology for one patient. The median time interval between the reaction and ST was 3 months (range 1-360). Five patients (5/ 42, 11 .9%), of which 2 had immediate and 3 non-immediate reactions, were reexposed to a negatively skin-tested ICM and did not react. Of note, for 7/37 (18.9%) not re-exposed patients, the treating physician and/or patient had concerns about the validity of the tests and declined further use of any ICM. Conclusion: In patients with positive ICM ST, re-exposure to a negatively skin-tested ICM was safe. Evaluation of patients with only negative ICM ST is ongoing and will enable a more accurate determination of the NPV of ICM ST.

Background: Betalactams are the most frequent cause of antibiotic hypersensitivity reaction. Clinical history is believed to be unreliable and diagnosis could only be determined using the standardised diagnostic procedures proposed by the European Network for Drug Allergy (ENDA). However, the diagnostic value of this complex and time-consuming allergologic work-up in real life practice remains problem. This study aim to test accuracy of clinical diagnosis algorithm with standardised diagnostic testing. Method: This retrospective cohort included patients with a history of immediate and non-immediate betalactam hypersensitivity whom completed drug testing in adult allergy service since 2008-2013. We classified patients to five groups according to 0 probability of being true allergy 0 and 0 onset of reaction 0 consisting of group 1 anaphylaxis grade III/IV (mostly within 1 h), group 2 anaphylaxis grade I/II (onset varied from 1 to 24 h), group 3 localised urticaria/angioedema (any onset), group 4 delayed reaction with maculopapular eruption and group 5 other symptoms. SCAR were excluded in this study. Results: Of all 99 patients,14 (14.14%) patients were diagnosed betalactam hypersensitivity. Seventy-five percent (9/12) of patients presented with anaphylaxis grade III/IV and 16.7% (2/13) with anaphylaxis gradeI/II were diagnosed betalactam hypersensitivity, whereas 7.3% (3/42) in patients presented with maculopapular eruption. None of patients who presented with urticaria (24) and other symptoms (8) Background: Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) are widely used for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Common complications of LMWH therapy are bleeding and skin reactions, however the incidence of the latter is often underestimated. Lately, delayed time hypersensitivity (DTH) proved to be the most frequent cause of skin symptoms, occurring in 7.5 percent during LMWH therapy. Other causes, like heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), immediate type hypersensitivity, calcinosis cutis and generalised haemorrhagic bullosis are rare but sometimes life threatening conditions which must be excluded first. Method and results: During a 12 months period we observed 7 consecutive cases with LMWH allergy in a single dermatological institute. Dermal symptoms varied from erythematous plaques and nodules to skin necrosis. Lymphocyte transformation tests were positive to enoxaparine in one. Prick tests were performed with diluted and undiluted LMWH products which confirmed cross allergy to other LMWHs also in one case. HIT was ruled out in all patients with repeated platelet count measurements. Dermal lesions disappeared and all patients completely healed after stopping the ongoing LMWH therapy. Switch to a peroral selective Xa factor inhibitor was uneventful in one case. Conclusion: Our experiences suggest that patients receiving LMWH therapy must be followed up carefully and signs of dermal side effects must be regularly checked. In case of heparin allergy switch to an other LMWH or unfractionated heparin is not recommended, due to frequent cross allergies. In these cases fondaparinux, novel peroral Xa factor inhibitors or direct thrombin inhibitors might be the treatment of choice. Selective hypersensitivity to cefazolincase series Almeida, JP; Lopes, A; Barbosa, M Department of Immunoallergology, Santa Maria Hospital -CHLN, Lisbon, Portugal Background: There is an increasing body of evidence of hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins, parallel to its usage boost. In the particular case of cefazolin, the selective hypersensitivity seems to be the preferential presentation and, for its parenteral use, reactions are often immediate and severe. The authors present a retrospective study of all cases of cefazolin hypersensitivity in the last 2 years. Common drugs used were rocuronium, propophol and cefazolin. Case 2: Thirty-six year-old pregnant woman, otherwise healthy, who was submitted to epidural block with ropivacain and sufentanil; immediately after administration of cefazolin, oxytocin and ephedrine, a clinical picture of facial erythema, lips angioedema and hypotension was reported and hemodynamic support was required. Case 3: Sixty-six year-old woman diagnosed with bilateral gonarthrosis with indication for surgical treatment; after epidural block with bupivacain and antibiotic prophylaxis with cefazolin, she suffered an anaphylactic shock with mechanical ventilation support need for 10 days. Conclusion: The allergological investigation in three cases showed all the tests for culprit drugs were negative except for the intradermal test for cefalozin which was positive (immediate) at different concentrations. Challenge tests performed were negative for the other culprit drugs. Our investigation in these three cases has shown a selective hypersensitivity for cefazolin with good tolerance of other betalactam antibiotics. This of clinical reactivity pattern may be associated with the R1 side chain, which is known to be different in cefazolin when compared to other cephalosporins. Background: Drug allergy is caused either by drug itself or its metabolite. Allergenic potential of drug depends on its properties and transformation of drug to its allergenic metabolite strictly depends on metabolic activity. Drug metabolism is mostly controlled by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme, which has got many isoforms with specific functions in biotransformation. A lot of methods of CYP activity determination have been worked out and put into practice, but none of them have referred to drug allergy processes. In this study we aimed to develop validated method for simultaneous CYP isoforms activity determination for drug allergy testing. Method: Method is based on determination of substances in bio fluids using LC-MS detection. Most important and distributed isoforms of CYP are: CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP1A2. Endogenous chemical substances as reference substrates were used in order to protect patients from different adverse drug reactions. Cholesterol, cortisol, losartan, rosin spirit and caffeine with their metabolites were chosen as reference substances for these isoforms respectively. Results: Methods of determining these substances and their metabolites were developed, tested and validated on clinical samples. Possibility of simultaneous determination of substances and their metabolites mentioned above in bio fluids, using model mixtures, has been achieved.

In vivo and in vitro test should be performed as part of the diagnostic workup. The aim of the study is to describe the performance of these tests in the diagnosis of betalactam allergy. Methods: We included patients \u226518 yearold with suggestive AR to BL referred to our Department between July 2011 and November 2012. Skin prick test (SPT) and Intradermal test (IDT) were performed with PPL (penicilloyl-polylysine) and MDM (minor determinant mixture) (Diater, Madrid, Spain), AMP (ampicillin, 20 mg/ml), PG (benzyl-penicillin, 1000 UI/ ml), AX (amoxicillin, 20 mg/ml). Results were considered positive according to the EAACI/ENDA recommendations. Serum specific IgE (sIgE) to PG, PV (penicillin V), AMP and AX were measured by means of ImmunoCAP (Thermofisher Scientific Phadia). Results: Hundred and eight subjects were included. Mean age was 51.2 year (range 18-83), 33.3% were male. Following the EAACI/ENDA algorithm 34/108 subjects were classified as allergic on the basis of suggestive clinical history together with positive skin tests and/or sIgE to any of the BL determinants tested. The results of these diagnostic tests are shown in the table. In these 34 patients AX was the drug involved in >80% of the reported AR. Conclusion: ID tests provide a higher rate of positive results than skin prick tests and sIgE with the standard cutoff level of 0.35 kU A /l. When the sIgE cutoff level is established at 0.10 kU A /l the performance is similar to the IDT. Background: Walnuts, which are among the most commonly allergenic tree nuts in Europe and the US, frequently undergo thermal processing prior to consumption. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of such heat treatments on the antibody reactivity to walnut proteins. Method: English walnuts (Juglans regia) were roasted at 132 or 180\u00b0C for 5, 10, or 20 min, then ground and defatted with hexane to produce defatted walnut flour (DWNF). Protein extractions of the DWNF samples were performed and the total soluble protein concentrations determined by Bradford assay. Immunoblots of both soluble and insoluble protein fractions from raw and roasted walnuts were conducted with polyclonal animal antisera. Sera from 11 walnut-allergic subjects were used to perform both IgE immunoblots of soluble and insoluble proteins and indirect ELISAs of soluble proteins. Results: Only the walnut sample undergoing the highest heat treatment (180\u00b0C, 20 min) showed significant changes in the concentration or profile of soluble proteins, with an 84% decrease in protein solubility particularly affecting high molecular weight proteins. In blots with walnut-allergic patient sera or animal antisera, any changes observed in reactivity patterns appeared to be primarily the result of alterations in relative protein solubility after roasting. Most notably, IgE and IgG reactivity was observed with both soluble and insoluble walnut proteins. At equal concentrations, soluble roasted walnut proteins showed minimal differences in IgE reactivity by ELISA (1.62% change from raw proteins).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Diagnosis performance of skin prick and intradermal tests, and serum specific IgE levels in betalactam allergy"}, {"text": "The persistence of IgE reactivity to the insoluble proteins from roasted walnuts indicates that thermally-induced protein aggregation is not sufficient to eliminate allergenic potential.

Both rBer e 1 and nBer e 1-stimulated bmDCs maintained the immature bmDC phenotype while the control SFA8 induced the maturation of bmDCs and the polarisation towards a TH1 cell response, independent of Toll-like receptors. The transcriptomic analysis revealed that 446 genes, mainly involved in the inflammatory response and DC maturation, were differentially regulated when stimulated with SFA8. Only 84 genes comprised of mostly novel, non-annotated genes and small RNAs were differentially regulated in DCs when stimulated by nBer e 1 alone. Conclusion: These results suggest that the glycosylation of rBer e 1 affects the rate and route of endocytosis of protein in bmDCs compared to its native counterpart but is not responsible for the differential programming of DCs. Further mapping of the differentially expressed genes by DCs when stimulated with nBer e 1 or rSFA8 will reveal how the DCs are programmed to polarise TH1/TH2 cell response.

The concentrations of sTIMP-1 in groups of patients with food and airborne allergy were significantly higher than those in the control group (respectively P = 0.0000 and P = 0.0003) and were in the group with food allergies 164.3 AE 59.2; airborne allergy 145.4 AE 50.1, whereas in the control group 92.4 AE 26.7 ng/ml. There was no statistically significant difference sTIMP-1 concentrations between the group of patients with airborne and food allergy (P = 0.2458). Conclusion: MMP-2 and MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were significantly higher in patients with food allergy than in the control group. A similar observation (except sMMP-2) also applies to a group of patients with airborne allergy. The results of this study suggest an important role of MMPs and TIMPs in the allergic inflammation. Background: Allergies today are among the most common chronic diseases and are often referred epidemic 21st century, which is an important issue for both medical and social. The aim of this study was to evaluate the concentrations of myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (EN) and Eselectin in patients with allergic-type food hypersensitivity and in patients with dyspeptic symptoms without concomitant allergic diseases.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Component resolved diagnosis and unresolved questions in Anisakis hypersensitivity"}, {"text": "The study included 80 patients, including 50 with food allergy and 30 patients with dyspeptic symptoms without food allergy. Each respondent blood samples to determine the concentration of MPO, EN and E-selectin. Serum levels of neutrophil elastase, and E-selectin in the serum was performed using kits from Bender Medystem (Medysystem Diagnostic) -Immunodiagnostik Assay. In the test method was used 'Sandwich' ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay). The test was performed according to the manufacturer. Quantitative measurement of the concentration of myeloperoxidase (MPO) was performed by enzyme immunoassay (ELISA). Results: In the group of patients with food allergy, the average concentration of myeloperoxidase was 289.37 AE 241.1 ng/mL, the mean concentration of neutrophil elastase was 406.95 AE 317.66 ng/ml, and E-selectin 54.0 AE 21.6 ng/ml.

However, CD is an autoimmune disorder. Method: We studied two patients with CD that developed immediate allergic symptoms after eating wheat flour. Case 1: A boy diagnosed at 2-year-old with persistent asthma and egg and fish allergy developed recurrent diarrhoea and weight loss few months after following an egg and fish free diet. Then, he was diagnosed with CD by positive biopsy and anti-transglutaminase IgA. When he was 4-year-old, he developed several episodes of vomiting and hypotension immediately after ingesting foods with hidden wheat flour. Finally, at the age of 8, he developed rhinitis and asthma exacerbation during spring months. Case 2: A girl diagnosed with CD at 14 months, when she was 7-year-old, she developed nasal pruritus, facial angioedema, dyspnoea and cough immediately after eating a soft candy containing wheat flour. Finally, at the age of seven she began with rhinoconjunctivitis in spring season. We performed skin prick tests (SPT) to the foods involved in the reactions and pollen, mites, animal dander and alternaria. Specific IgE was determined by ImmunoCAP, and microarray ISAC was performed. Results: SPT and specific IgE were positive in both cases to grass and olive pollen, wheat flour, gluten, gliadin and Tri a14. Microarray ISAC confirmed specific IgE to rTri a14 -lipid transfer protein (LTP) from wheat in both cases (4.3 and 17.3 ISU, respectively) and measurements to rTri a1 9.0101, n Tria aA_T1 were undetectable, as were to rPru p3, rAra h9, rCor a8, nJug r3, nArt v3, nOle e7and rPla a3 (LTPs). Moreover, case1 had SPT and specific IgE positive to egg white and fish (sardines, cod, hake, tuna). Conclusion: Pediatric patients with CD may develop allergy to Tri a14 and symptoms by ingestion of wheat-derived foodstuffs. Background: IL17 is a cytokine produced by several cells. It plays a role in the mechanisms of allergic reactions involving neutrophils through the induction of production cytokines and chemokines. Activated neutrophils secrete elastase and ROS (reactive oxygen derivatives) important mediators of the inflammatory process responsible for tissue damage. We analyses: Interleukin 17A and neutrophil elastase concentration in serum and ROS production by neutrophils. The correlation between serum levels of IL17A and ROS, and of IL17A and serum elastase were measured. Method: The study included 30 patients with food allergy diagnosed based on history, clinical signs, the presence of positive SPT and serum specific IgE against food allergens selected immunoenzymatic method using sets of Hycor. The control group consisted of 10 healthy volunteers. Concentration was determined by ELISA using IL17A sets eBioscience and elastase with sets BENDERMED SYSTEMS. Examine chemiluminescence by kinetic method luminolo-dependant during 40 min was measured with a luminometer LU-MINOSCAN -Labsystem. Results: Serum concentrations of IL17A and chemiluminescence values obtained by neutrophils and elastase levels were higher in patients with allergic hypersensitivity to food than in the group of healthy subjects. Conclusion: The results obtained confirm the role and increased neutrophiles activity in allergy inflamatory process with examined patients.

The increasing occurrence of sensitivity to certain foods remains to be identified, and the allergen-epithelial interaction in particular remains elusive. Peanuts in particular are still one of the highest contributors of anaphylaxis after ingestion of a food allergen. Previous findings by our research group observed that peanut allergens were able to cross the Caco-2 cell culture model of the intestinal epithelium. Specifically, the major peanut allergens Ara h 1, Ara h 2 and Ara h 3, as well as Ara h 6. The direction of this research has deepened into identifying the mechanism by which the Caco-2 monolayers uptake peanut allergens, specifically by endocytosis. Here, we aim to further our understanding about the pathway from allergen to allergy.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Development of IgE-mediated wheat allergy in children with a previous diagnosis of celiac disease"}, {"text": "Method: To achieve this, we treated the human Caco-2 cell culture model with peanut extract and then utilised a combination of inhibition studies and confocal microscopy to identify the endocytotic mechanisms of peanut allergens. Results: Initial findings from the analysis of inhibition studies and confocal microscopy of peanut treated Caco-2 monolayers suggests that transcytosis occurs via endocytotic mechanisms. Conclusion: By increasing our understanding of peanut allergen epithelial transcytosis, we are closer to understanding the molecular mechanisms of the peanut allergen atopic pathway. Background: Food allergy animal models that mimic the human disease are useful for determining immunological mechanisms, predicting triggers and to investigate the safety and efficacy of new therapeutics. Allergies represent a socioeconomic problem that has affected increasing world population. Although allergy to fruits be relatively uncommon compared to other food allergies, they are not rare. We propose the development of a food allergy model for C. papaya in mice which allows investigate the contribution of abundant allergens in response. Method: Female Balb/c mice were maintained fasting for 7 h and then sensitised with fresh extract C. papaya through intragastric route, once a week per eight consecutive weeks. The body weight and blood sample are collected in 0, 21, 42 and 56 days. In last day 56 animals were challenge by oral route with a rectal thermometer the body temperature was registered and respiratory parameters was measured by Pletismography (Buxco) by up to 45 min. Histological methods were realised for measure infiltrate in stomach and small intestine. Results: C. papaya group mice were underweight when compared to the saline group. The oral challenge (day 56) promoted a drop of the body temperature (until 1.5 degrees) and alterations on the respiratory parameters as respiratory frequency, decreased the expiration and relaxation times in a framework of respiratory distress with bronchoconstriction. Specific IgG1 and IgE were detected in the serum of sensitised mice (ELISA) as well as an anaphylactic activity (title 1/40) by Active Cutaneous Anaphylaxis. In addition, after 24 h to oral challenge, sensitised mice presented an intense mast cell density in stomach and eosinophil in intestine. Conclusion: We established a new adjuvant free mouse model, which demonstrated that C. papaya is an allergenic food that induces specific antibodies able to degranulation mast cells and/or macrophage. We suggested that this adjuvant-free model could be a useful tool to study allergen components involved in food allergy trigged by tropical fruit since it mimics the natural human exposure to food. Background: This study is part of a multiphase project aiming to validate a mouse model to assess the potential allergenicity of hydrolysed infant formulas. Previous results showed its transferability and its ability to discriminate between the sensitising properties of whey protein and extensively hydrolysed whey protein. In the current study, the sensitising properties of 3 partially hydrolysed whey proteins (pWH-A, -B and -C) were investigated in the mouse as well as the classically used guinea pig model. Methods: Mice and guinea pigs were orally sensitised with whey by gavage or ad libitum via the drinking water respectively. Whey-IgE, mMCP-1, anaphylactic shock symptoms, body temperature and acute allergic skin responses were determined upon challenge in mice in four centers. In guinea pigs anaphylactic shock symptoms (ASA) were measured upon intravenous challenge at one center. Results: Elevated levels of whey-specific IgE were detected in sensitised mice in all centers although the group average did not reach significance for IgE in center 2. Therefore, all results of this center are excluded. The remaining three centers showed acute allergic skin responses and enhanced mMCP-1 levels in the positive control upon challenge. In two out of three centers, additional shock symptoms and a drop in body temperature were observed. All centers showed a clearly decreased sensitising capacity in the overall comparison of the pWH's as compared to whey with the highest decrease in sensitising capacity for pWH-A. However, none of the centers was able to differentiate between the sensitising capacities of the pWH's based on a single parameter, stressing the necessity of multiple clinical read-out parameters. In the overall comparison over the three institutes, no difference was observed on the acute allergic skin response and mMCP-1 in pWH-A mice compared to non-sensitised mice The ASA in guinea pigs was negative for all six animals sensitised with pWH-A, whereas pWH-B and pWH-C showed moderate ASA responses. Conclusions: Based on the overall data of three centers, these results suggest that the murine model is an appropriate model to determine the decreased sensitising capacity of pWH's based on the measurement of multiple parameters. The mouse model might therefore be favorable above the guinea pig model for testing the allergenicity of hydrolysed infant formulas. A future challenge is to develop an overall scoring system for proper risk assessment, taking all parameters into account. Background: LTP are pan-allergens present in many plants. Sensitisation to LTP was mainly described in the Mediterranean region but also exists in Nothern Europe. The clinical presentation varies from asymptomatic sensitisation to anaphylaxis. Cannabis Sativa, popular drug in Europe, also contains an LTP (Can s 3) and could play a role on the primo-sensitisation to ns-LTP. Methods: A Belgian male of 20 years old consulted in 2012 for an acute episode of urticaria with anaphylaxis after an early morning run. One hour before he ate yoghurt, fresh grapes, banana and kiwi, usually well tolerated. He mentions an oral allergy syndrome with different fruits such as apples and contact urticaria, rhino-conjunctivitis with asthma related to the use of marihuana (both by direct contact and smoking).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Development of IgE-mediated wheat allergy in children with a previous diagnosis of celiac disease"}, {"text": "Results: Pollen Skin Prick Tests (Stallergens) were positive to pollens of Birch (Betula a.), to Mugwort (Artemisia v.) and to the mixture of Grass Pollens. Native Skin Prick-Tests were positive to Grape, Kiwi and Banana and also to Cannabis Sativa Sativa and Cannabis Sativa Indica (4 and 10 mm for leaves, 10 and 20 mm for flowers). ImmunoCAP Hemp (Cannabis S Sativa) was positive at 13.10 kU/l (Laboratory of Professor D. Ebo, Antwerpen). Immu-noCAP ISAC (Thermofisher) confirmed sensitisation to rBet v 1 (2, and different other PR 10 proteins and to ns-LTP proteins (rCor a 8 3, 8 ISU-E and rPru p 3 2, 7 ISU-E). For Kiwi it also showed sensitisation to its Thaumatin-like Protein nAct d 2 (5,7 ISU-E) but not for its protein PR10 (rAct d 8 < 0.3). Conclusion: This patient has a known and confirmed allergy to Cannabis. He presented food anaphylaxis symptoms by sensitisation to LTP; with probably an additional role of the exercise. We therefore suggest that LTP sensitisation was initiated by repeated contact with Cannabis plants a few years ago. We don't really understand and cannot exclude the potential extra role of the Thaumatin-Like Protein in this case. Currently, sustainable food production, including alternative protein sources, is receiving a lot of attention and exploration of these sources is widely supported by international organizations. Existing guidelines to assess the allergic potential of these sources are restricted to a qualitative assessment of allergenicity and often results in an oversimplification of their hazard assessment. One of the major challenges is to accurately and quantitatively assess the allergenicity of new or modified proteins. Therefore, we propose a quantitative statistical prediction model which predicts the relative allergenicity of a new protein compared to known allergenic foods and proteins.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 509, "end": 512, "text": "(2,", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Development of IgE-mediated wheat allergy in children with a previous diagnosis of celiac disease"}, {"text": "As a first step, a scale for the relative allergenicity has been developed using data from a set of high/low allergenic foods and proteins.

Background: Anaphylaxis is an acute, potentially life-threatening multisystem syndrome. The aim of this study was to evaluate features of the transcriptional activity genes TGFB1 (transforming growth factor, beta 1), PLA2G7 (plateletactivating factor acetylhydrolase) and ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) in patients with anaphylaxis. Methods: 34 patients (median age 7 years; range 3-18 years) with a diagnosis of anaphylaxis in remission, 35 children with atopic dermatitis and 41 children of control group without allergic diseases and IgE sensitisation (negative results ImmunoCAP 100 Phadia AB) were enrolled in the study.Total RNA was prepared from blood samples using Trizol RNA Prep 100 kit (IsoGen, Russia). RT-PCR was performed with the MMLV RT kit (Evrogen, Russia), according to the manufacturer's instruction. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed with the qPCRmix-HS kit (Evrogen, Russia). Primers and probes were synthesized by DNA Synthesis, LLC (Russia). Amplification, detection, and data analysis were performed with a CFX-96 real-time detection system (Bio-Rad, USA). Nonparametric tests (U-, F-tests) were used for statistical analysis. Results: A significant decrease of gene expression PLA2G7 was observed in patients with anaphylaxis (P < 0.05) in compare with control group. A total loss of PLA2G7 gene expression was observed in 11.8% of children with anaphylaxis. TGFB1 gene expression was significantly lower in patients with anaphylaxis as compared with the expression of this gene in children with atopic dermatitis (P < 0.05). ACE gene expression was detected in 71.40% of children in the control group. Patients with anaphylaxis observed a significantly lower frequency of detection of ACE gene expression 38.2% (P < 0.05) compared with the control group. Conclusion: Patients with anaphylaxis are characterised by reduced transcriptional activity of PLA2G7 and ACE genes compared with children without atopy, and decreased expression of TGFB1 gene compared with atopic dermatitis patients. Background: International research shows that Food Allergy has an impact on the quality of life (QoL) for the affected child, adolescent and even in adulthoodas well for the parents. Methods: The cohort comprises an existing database with 394 Danish children, teenagers and adults diagnosed with peanut/egg/ hazelnut allergy in accordance with EAAC-I guidelines. We used the validated Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaires (FAQLQ) and Food Allergy Independent Measure (FAIM). The questionnaires have been translated from English to Danish in accordance to World Health Organisation 0 s criteria and are web-based. The questionnaire form varies according to patient's age group: Parent Form 0-12 years (N = 223), Child Form 8-12 years (N = 73), Teenager Form 13-17 years (N = 49), Adult Form 18 years and up (N = 29). The siblings receive an age-adjusted questionnaire. The patients and their relatives were invited by letter with a link to the homepage www.datafabrikken.dk and a code for each family member to access their specific questionnaires'. Results: We found a significant difference between QoL scores (FAQLQ-PF) for parents to children aged 0-7 years and scores for older children (M = 2.0), teens and adults (FAQLQ-CF/TF/AF) (M = 2.8), P < 0.001. The greatest burden is reported by adolescents (M = 3.2), P < 0.001. The impact on female QoL is greater than that of males and increases according to age, P < 0.001, peaking at adolescence. Furthermore, controlling for number of allergens and severity of symptoms, those who reported a wheat allergy had a significantly higher burden on QoL, than peanut/nut or egg, P < 0.01.

The fish allergy clinical symptoms can be severe and this type of food allergy is likely to be a lifelong disorder for most children. The prevalence of fish allergy in Russia is unknown. The fishing and use of uncooked river fish is a general practice of Siberian population, especially in rural settlements. Purpose: To estimate the prevalence of fish allergy in children of Tomsk Oblast (West Siberia, Russia). Method: The cross-sectional study in random samples of primary schoolchildren aged 7-10 years (n = 13 010) from the Tomsk Oblast, Russia, was performed as a part of the EuroPrevall project (FP6-FOOD-CT-2005-514000). The case-control sample was recruited for the second stage (n = 1288). Thus who reported adverse reactions to food in the screening stage were considered as cases, children without reported reactions were controls. The standardised screening questionnaires were used at the screening stage. The casecontrol stage included the completion of a clinical questionnaire, skin-prick test (ALK-Abell o, Spain), and serum specific IgE measurement (ImmunoCAP, Phadia, Sweden). Probable food allergy was defined as the combination of reaction within 2 h after food ingestion together with specific IgE \u2265 0.35 kU/l and/or positive skin-prick test to the same food (mean diameter of wheal \u22653 mm). Results: The prevalence of parent-reported symptoms to fish in children of Tomsk Oblast is 1.65% (1.66% in urban area and 1.65% in rural settlements, OR 1.01; CI 95% 0.76-1.35; P = 0.95). The prevalence of probable food allergy to fish is 0.32% (0.32% in urban area and 0.33% in rural settlements, OR 1.08; CI 95% 0.55-2.14; P = 0.80). Conclusion: The prevalence of food allergy to fish in children aged 7-10 years in West Siberia is 0.32% without significant differences between rural and urban population. Background: Food allergy is a growing public health issue, particularly in infants and children. Recently the World Allergy Organisation has lamented the paucity of accurate, current regional food allergy prevalence data. The incidence of food allergy in Irish children is not yet known. Studies in other populations may not be readily applicable to Irish children due to higher prevalence of Atopic Disease and differing early feeding practices. Methods: The BASELINE Birth Cohort study is the first birth cohort study in Ireland. Two thousand and thirty-seven infants were recruited from July 2008 to October 2011. Appointments were conducted shortly after birth and at 2, 6, 12 and 24 months. Screening questions for food allergic symptoms were asked at each visit. Potential adverse reactions to food were investigated using modified EuroPrevall diagnostic criteria. At 24 months all children had screening Skin Prick Test to Cow's Milk, Egg, Peanut, Cod, Wheat and Soya. Oral Food Challenge (OFC) was subsequently conducted unless the food was already safely tolerated in the diet. Children with previous positive OFC's were not re-challenged at 24 months if there was a clear history of a recent food reaction and IgE sensitisation was still evident. Results: Thousand seven hundred fortyfive infants participated to 12 months, with an adverse food reaction reported for 11.7% (204/1745). Fifty children had OFC confirmed food allergy while a further six infants were sensitised to a food with a positive clinical history of reaction but parents deferred OFC. Cumulative incidence of Food Allergy at 12 months was taken at 3.21% (56/1745).At 24 months, 1402 children had SPT screening conducted. Eighty-nine children had positive SPT to any food giving a food sensitisation rate of 6.34% (89/1402). To date, 30 children were sensitised only, 1 infant was lost to follow up and 1 infant awaits primary OFC. Fifty seven children demonstrated SpIgE mediated Food Allergy 57/1402 (4.06%). Conclusion: In Ireland IgE mediated food allergy is present in 3.21% of 1 year old and 4.06% of 2 year old children. This robust body of work fills the gap in Irish food allergy prevalence data and will aid towards the provision of adequate specialist health care services for food allergic children. FA-free diets were reported in the last year of the surveyed schools with upward trend year on year (P < 0.016) (total studied period 4.31%). The most common allergenic foods declared by allergists were egg (32.78%), fruits (21.04%), nuts (17.87%), milk (17.08%), fish (13.92%) and legumes (10.54%) (upward trend for nuts, P < 0.003). Milk and egg were the most common foods in patients <6 years of age, whereas fruits, nuts and legumes were the most prevalent foods in patients over 6 years. Significant differences were shown in FA-free diet prevalence in private schools (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Prevalence of FA-free diets in the Hortaleza District schools is high, similar to the Spanish Alergol ogica 2005 report. In private schools the prevalence of FA-free diets was higher than in state and grant aided schools.

Methods: Parents to 2585 (96% of invited) children in ages 7-8 years in Northern Sweden completed a questionnaire about allergic diseases and food hypersensitivity, an expanded ISAAC questionnaire. A subset of 1700 (90% of invited) children also participated in skin prick testing to ten airborne allergens. Results: The prevalence of FHS to milk, egg, fish, wheat, soy, fruits and/or nuts (any FHS) was 21% and significantly more common among girls. Most common was FHS to milk, 9%. Oral symptoms, reported by 47.4%, were the most common symptom. The major triggers for oral symptoms were fruits, reported by 87.4%. Gastrointestinal symptoms were reported by 45.7%.

Eczema was significantly associated with FHS to milk while FHS to other foods were associated with asthma, rhinitis and eczema as well. Conclusion: Perceived symptoms of food hypersensitivity were common in schoolchildren.

Eosinophil was higher in children with AD [6% (3. 5-9.4 )] than children without AD [3.8% (2.3-6. 3) (P < 0.0001)], whereas total IgE was lower [86 (32-230) vs 119 (54-292), P = 0.0017]. Initial cows' milk sIgE levels in children with AD were lower 1.7 (0.3-8.9) compared to non-AD group 4.8 (0.3-22.2) (P = 0.015) whereas initial egg sIgE levels were higher [3.9 (1.34-15.9) vs 3.1 (0.9-12.8), (P = 0.001)]. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that AD is more frequent in egg allergic children however AD accompanies less frequently to CMA. Existence of egg allergy, high eosinophil percentage and egg sIgE levels increase the risk of AD in children with food allergy. Background: Food allergy (FA) is a rising problem worldwide. No previous studies of FA and food hypersensitivity have been conducted in Latvia. This study was done to study the symptoms that are supposed to be caused by FA, identify food allergens and tests used in diagnostics of FA in different age groups in children up to 3 years of age. Method: Retrospective descriptive study. Data was collected from January 2012 till December 2012 from randomly sampled medical documents from ambulatory allergy care in Children's clinical university hospital in Riga. Children 0-3 years old with suspected FA and different symptoms participated in the study. For statistic analysis MS Excel and IBM Statistics 20.0 programs were used. Results: Data from 100 medical documents was collected. Sixty-one percent boys, 39% girls. Sixty-five percent were infants. In 92% of patients symptoms started in the first year of life. Patients most commonly had positive tests to egg and milk (71% and 40% respectively). Specific IgE tests were used in 61% patients, skin prick tests in 51%, atopy patch tests (in combination with prick tests or specific IgE) in 20%. Oral food challenges were not done. The most common complaints were skin symptoms (98%) and gastrointestinal problems (10%). Ninety-four percent (n = 94) had atopic dermatitis, 3% (n = 3) anaphilactic reactions, 2% (n = 2) respiratory symptoms. Twelve percent of patients had symptoms from different organ systems. Conclusion: This study shows that egg and milk are the most common food allergens found in children 0-3 years old. Skin problems could be the most worrying complaints for parents, what might explain why almost all patients who came to allergologist with suspected food allergy had skin problems. Gastrointestinal symptoms are poorly recognised and evaluated as a sign of food allergy. Severe reactions and respiratory symptoms are rare. Oral food challenges are necessary tests for diagnosis of food allergy and must be conducted in Children's clinical university hospital in Riga. Background: Coexistence of food hypersensitivity is often observed in patients with aeroallergy. Principal method cure of aeroallergy is immunotherapy (SIT). Effectiveness of this therapy is assessed based on clinical symptoms abated. Sometimes we observed less effect this treatment, probably connected with coexistence of food hypersensitivity, which could be cross allergy or co-allergy. Aim: The aim of this study was assessment prevalence of food hypersensitivity in patients sensitised for aeroallergens. Methods: We analysis case history 55 patients with SIT for aeroallergens, in age 18 to 72 years (medium 55 years), 28 women and 27 man. Results: More frequently we observed allergy for several aeroallergens -32 patients. Only 23 patients have allergy for one aeroallergen. Most of patients was treated SIT for grass allergy -16 patients, dust mites -11, trees -10, trees and grasses -6, ragweed, cat -4, and for one to: grasses and ragweed, trees and ragweed, alternaria. Prevalence of food hypersensitivity in analyzing group of patients was 27.2% (15 patients). More frequently we observed food hypersensitivity in patients with pollen allergy -33.3% (13 patients). Oral allergy syndrome (OAS) was more common clinical manifestation of food hypersensitivity -12 patients. More frequently we observed food hypersensitivity for apple -10 patients, carrot -7, cherry -5, hazelnut -4, peach -4, nectarine -3, celery -3, strawberry -2, kiwi -2, curry -2, pear -2, walnut -2, and one for: on raspberry, egg, citrus, shrimp, beetroot, morello, cow milk. Conclusion: Prevalence of food hypersensitivity in patients treated with SIT for aeroallergens was 27.2%. More frequently it was observed in patients with plant allergy -33.3%. Coexistence food hypersensitivity in this group of patients could influence on less effective results of SIT, because probably food hypersensitivity is important element supporting of allergy process in this patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1004, "end": 1010, "text": "5-1.5)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1470, "end": 1475, "text": "5-9.4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1510, "end": 1517, "text": "(2.3-6.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1564, "end": 1576, "text": "[86 (32-230)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "677"}, {"text": "Pattern and prevalence of allergen sensitisation to nuts in a paediatric allergy and asthma clinic Background: Nut allergies are often associated with the risk of anaphylaxis, especially in asthmatic subjects. A recent publication of the German anaphylaxis registry (NORA) identified peanut allergy as the main trigger of anaphylaxis in children. We were interested to assess the prevalence of nut allergen sensitisation and clinically relevant nut allergy in our paediatric allergy and asthma clinic. Method: Skin Prick Tests were performed over 19 years, in children and adolescents with asthma, AR or atopic eczema (n/gender: 2930 \u2642/1786 \u2640) and analysed retrospectively. Apart from sensitisation to common aeroallergens, sensitisation to nuts (peanuts, hazelnuts, walnuts and almonds) was also assessed. In the presence of a positive (histamine) and negative (diluent) control, weal size reactions >3mms were considered positive. In patients with positive skin prick tests to nuts, total-and nut allergen-specific IgE levels (Thermo Fisher ImmunoCap) were also measured. Results: Of 4716 tests analysed, 464 were positive to nuts. Two hundred and Eightynine (62.3%) were sensitised to peanuts, 273 (58.8%) to hazelnuts, 262 (56.5%) to almonds, and 117 (25.2%) to walnuts. Nut allergen sensitisation was significantly higher in boys than in girls (65.2% \u2642 vs 34.8% \u2640; P < 0.001). A clinically relevant nut allergy was diagnosed in 9.9% of patients. Of those, 35 patients (7.5%) were allergic to peanuts and 15 (3.2%) had developed anaphylaxis. Other clinically relevant nut allergies were observed in 11 patients. Nine (1.9%) were allergic to hazelnuts, including one with anaphylaxis. Only two patients were allergic to walnuts. Conclusion: Among children with asthma and other allergies, 9.9% were sensitised to nuts, with higher sensitisation rates in boys. A clinically relevant nut allergy was found in 9.9% of nut-sensitised individuals. Peanut was the leading nut allergen. In line with other Western countries, we observed a 1.0% prevalence rate of a clinically relevant nut allergy.

Background: Most Japanese peoples are used to eat raw seafood in their daily lives. Seafood is often polluted by Anisakis simplex. Sensitisation to Anisakis is one of the relevant factors induced urticaria and anaphylaxis after ingestion seafood. Investigation how often sensitisation to Anisakis was detected in asthmatic patients had not been found so much. Method: We performed three independent studies about allergy to Anisakis in Japanese asthmatics. Subject of each study differed. Study 1: We performed the questionary survey about urticaria or anaphylaxis occurred after ingestion of seafood for 98 asthmatics. Study 2: We examined titer of specific IgE to Anisakis simplex in blood samples of 37 adult asthmatics. Study 3: Measurement of specific IgE to representative allergen components of Anisakis simplex such as Ani s1 and Ani s3 in blood samples of 211 adult asthmatics was performed. Results: Study1: 15 of 98 subjects had experienced allergic symptoms after eating Mackerel. Study2: Titers of specific IgE to Anisakis were increased in serum samples from 10 of 37 asthmatics. Those titers had tendency to be high in middle to high aged asthmatics that were used to eat raw seafood frequently. Titers of specific IgE to Anisakis were shown not to be correlated with titers of specific IgE to air pollutant such as house dust-mites. Study 3: Ani s1 was positive in serum samples from 4 of 211 subjects and Ani s3 were positive in serum samples from 2 of 211 subjects. Conclusion: It was generally known that severity of anaphylaxis in asthmatics inclined to be serious. To prevent anaphylaxis, it is important that detecting sensitised allergen could cause anaphylaxis should be performed exactly. Both detailed interview about patients' eating habits and testing specific IgE to Anisakis simplex was thought to be useful for screening of Anisakis allergy and then suggestion to avoid seafood likely to be polluted by Anisakis simplex might be considered for suspicious cases.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "682"}, {"text": "Incidence of anaphylaxis among children in Tokyo based on a birth cohort study Background: Although many cross-sectional studies about incidence of anaphylaxis were reported around the world, few population-based prospective studies have been reported. Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the incidence of anaphylaxis and causal foods for the children at the age of 1 and 5 years. Methods: Data were extracted from a birth cohort study named as Tokyo-Children's Health, Illness and Development study which enrolled 1701 pregnant women and followed their 1550 children. The parents answered questionnaires about their children's anaphylaxis. The incidence of anaphylaxis was defined by the question, 'Has your child had anaphylaxis in the last 12 months?' We examined the incidence of anaphylaxis and causal foods against the children with the questionnaires at the age of one and 5 years. Results: Follow up rate was 88.3% at the age of 1 year and 90.3% at the age of 5 years. The incidence of anaphylaxis was 12.2% at the age of 1 year and 5.9% at the age of 5 years. In terms of foodinduced anaphylaxis, the prevalence of hen's egg-induced anaphylaxis was 5.3% and 1.9% at one and 5 years. The prevalence of cow's milk-induced anaphylaxis was 1.6% and 0.7% at one and 5 years. Out of 63 children who had hen's egginduced anaphylaxis at the ages of one, seven children developed the recurrence of hen's egg-induced anaphylaxis at the age of 5 years. Conclusion: Although the prevalence of anaphylaxis among 5-year-old children was lower than that among 1-year-old children, one-ninth of children experienced anaphylaxis induced by the same food both at the age of one and 5 years. Background: An Anaphylaxis Surveillance Project ASP was set up by the Food Allergy Referral Centre FARC involving ER and Pediatrics of eight hospitals in Veneto, Italy \u00c04.5 M inhabitants. The aim is to get a perspective of incidence and prevalence of anaphylaxis through real-time registration of anaphylaxis. Method: This ASP acts through combining an interactive LDAP Oracle database with intensive regular training to ER and pediatrics staff and on-site monitoring on monthly basis. The database consists of electronic recording in realtime of acute episodes on the intranets and takes advantage of warnings based on shared presettled diagnostic and treatment criteria. Moreover patients admitted to hospitals through this system must be referred to FARC or local allergists. Results: From Sep'12 to Aug'13, 164 cases were registered, related to 107 adults (A) and 52 children (C). Incidence varies from 4 to 13/100 000 people per year. Reactions due to food consumption accounted for 68.8% in C and 34.5% in A, drug reactions for 14.6% in C and 33.6% in A. Treatment: IV corticosteroid 80.9% in A -50.3% in C, IV antihistamine 58.2% in A -48.1% in C fluid therapy 69.1% in A -35.2% in C. Adrenaline was used IM in 16.4% A -24.1% C, IV in 5.5% A -1.9% C, inhaled in 2.7% A -1.9% C. In 30.9% A and 33.3% C adrenaline was not administered despite warning pops-up recommendation. Moreover, 28% of patients were discharged within a period between 1 and 3 h after ER arrival and 39% of registered patients were not referred to an allergist. Conclusion: Realtime implementation of a dedicated data entry is mandatory for getting good quality data on anaphylaxis. Sharing diagnostic and treatment criteria and intensive ER staff trainings have partially compensated the pitfalls related to ER high turnover and busy logistics. Further training is needed to implement the system on a daily basis usage improving its impact on medication error avoidance, diagnostics, and therapeutic efficiency. Background: The frequency of anaphylaxis in children is estimated to be 0.14% in Japan. However, the clinical background and causes of anaphylaxis remain unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate details of anaphylaxis in children who visited the emergency room of Jikei University Daisan Hospital, located in western Tokyo, Japan, over a 5-year period. Method: Eighty-two children with anaphylaxis (46 boys, 36 girls) with a mean age of 5.4 years (range, 6 months to 15 years) were retrospectively analyzed. Results: The main causes of anaphylaxis were foods (81%), mainly in the form of eggs (29%), milk (12%), or peanuts (7%). Only 12% of children visited the emergency room within 30 min after symptom onset. The event typically occurred at home (72%) or at nursery school/kindergarten/school (15%). Cutaneous signs were present in 59% of patients and 30% showed respiratory signs as initial symptoms. Epinephrine injection was administered in 73%. Conclusion: Although prompt injection of epinephrine is recommended to save lives, only 12% visited our emergency room within 30 min after onset of allergic symptoms. These results suggest that education of patients, caregivers and teachers should be improved. Background: Pru p 3 is known as a lipid transfer protein (LTP), which is a class 1 food allergen responsible for peach allergy. A lower prevalence rate of peach allergy in patients with systemic allergic manifestations and reactivity to Pru p 3 has been reported in Japan (approx. 10%) compared to Europe (approx. 60%). Method: Four peach-allergic patients (case 1: aged 15, M; case 2: aged 12, M; case 3: aged 14, F; case 4: aged 13, F) with systemic reactions to peach, whom had been diagnosed by exercise stress testing at our division since July 2012, were tested for specific IgE to Pru p 1, 3, 4 using Immuno-CAP and IMMULITE \u00e2 2000 3gAllergy TM specific IgE assays. Results: All patients had positive skin prick tests (SPT) and basophil activation tests (CD203c) to raw fruit. The SPT demonstrated a positive reaction to heated fruit for cases 1, 3 and 4, and a somewhat weaker reaction for case 2. Cases 1, 2 and 4 were positive, whereas case 3 was negative to whole peach extract when analyzed by ImmunoCAP and 3gAllergy TM . The Im-munoCAP results showed that all the cases were negative to Pru p 3; on the other hand, 3gAllergy TM suggested that cases 1 and 2 were positive to Pru p 3. Case 1 was solely positive to LTP, case 2 was positive to LTP and profilin, and case 3 and 4 was negative to both by either of the assays. Conclusion: The results showed that 2 out of 4 patients who were negative to rPru p 3 by ImmunoCAP were positive to nPru p 3 in 3gAllergy TM assay, indicating the influence of different assay methodology on the study results. Peach allergy in patients with negative Pru p 3-specific IgE results by both assays may possibly be attributed to other antigens, such as Pru p 7.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "684"}, {"text": "Breast feeding and infantile eczema before 6 month is high risk of sensitisation to egg white at 1 year of age in a high risk birth cohort in Chiba, Japan Nakano, T 1 ; Ozawa, N 1 ; Kojima, H 2 ; Yamamoto, T 1 ; Yamaide, F 1 ; Inoue, Y 1 ; Arima, T 1 ; Takemori, T 3 ; Kohno, Y 4 ; Shimojo, N 1 1 Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba City, Japan; 2 Higashi Koiwa Wanpaku Clinic, Tokyo, Japan; 3 Riken Research Center for Allergy and Immunology, Yokohama, Japan; 4 Chiba Rosai Hospital, Ichihara, Japan Background: The role of breastfeeding and infantile eczema in sensitisation to food allergen remains to be determined. Method: Three hundred and six healthy full term neonates born at the Chiba University Hospital or the Kawatetsu Chiba Hospital between April 2010 and February 2012 were enrolled. At least one family member had a history of atopic dermatitis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, or food allergy. At 1 year of age, serum specific IgEs (sI-gEs) to egg white were measured by Immu-noCap \u00e2 . Factors related with sensitisation to egg white at 1 year of age were analyzed using multiple logistic regression analysis. Results: 33.2% were sensitised to egg white (sIgE > 0.7 U/ml) at 1 year of age. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that infantile eczema before 6 months of age, breast feeding by 4 months of age and maternal history of allergy were significantly associated with sensitisation to egg white at 1 year of age (P = 0.001, P = 0.003 and P = 0.036, respectively). Furthermore, in subjects who had infantile eczema, almost exclusive breast feeding group had significantly higher positive rates of sensitisation to egg white compared to mixed feeding group (P = 0.002). In contrast, in subjects who did not have infantile eczema, there were no significant difference in sensitisation rates to egg white between almost exclusive breast feeding group and mixed feeding group (P = 0.59). Conclusion: Infantile eczema, breast feeding and maternal history of allergy were independent risk factors for egg white sensitisation at 1 year of age. The combination of infantile eczema and breast feeding was a highest risk factor for the egg white sensitisation at 1 year of age.

The demographic factors age and gender, and the physicians' information on symptoms, onset of reaction, and treatment were examined. Pollen allergies were recorded together with the most frequent incriminating food suspected or detected. Results: Cases with negative serology (NS) peaked at young adults aged 26 to 45 years, while cases with positive serology (PS) showed a higher frequency for the smallest children aged 0 to 5 years. For both groups, the ratio between genders shifted from 25: 75 female: male in children to the opposite in adults. Skin affections were the most frequent symptoms, while the most severe reactions involved the respiratory tract and loss of consciousness. The onset of reactions less than 1 h was 70% in NS, compared to 93% for children and 56% for the adults in PS. Treatment with adrenalin was used in 38% in NS and 49% in PS. Sensitisation to pollen was found to be 5% for the NS, 29% for the children and 85% for the adults in PS. Known asthma was reported for 17.5% with NS and 30% for all in PS. The incriminating food most often reported or detected were hazelnut and peanut. In addition, reactions to fruit and berries were frequently reported for NS and egg for the children in PS. Conclusion: Cases with negative vs positive serology peaked at different ages, showing opposite gender ratio. In NS, less frequent reports on asthma and lower incidence of sensitisation to pollen is apparent. This may suggest groups of individuals with different phenotypes, where PS may comprise a group of more atopic individuals with hypersensitivity reactions due to IgE binding. Background: Pinions are the seeds of Pinus pinea and consumed in various culinary presentations. Pinion allergy with other nuts especially peanuts and almonds, is well known, but the selective hypersensitivity is rare and pinion reactions after ingestion are usually systemic, including cases of anaphylaxis after skin testing with these nuts. Method: 25 year old male, after eat multiple foods like shrimp, walnut and pinion, after exercise had generalised urticaria, pruritus, lip and eyelid angioedema, dyspnea and wheezing, requiring emergency care, with intramuscular corticosteroids oxygen and fluid therapy administration. He had not taken NSAIDs, neither a concomitant infectious process. After this episode he has tolerated shrimp, seafood, fish, pistachio, sunflower seeds and almonds, pine nuts avoiding. Results: Blood test and biochemistry in normal limits, specific IgE to latex anisakis, echinococos shrimp and walnut: negative, serum tryptase within normality. Complement normal. Prick test to aeroallergens: Positive for olive, artemisia and LTP. Prick test with pinion: Positive. Conclusion: We report the case of a patient who presents anaphylaxis immediately after intake various foods, including the pinion, in the allergy study, selective hypersensitivity to this nut is evident, being negative for other food allergens, as well as a pollen sensitisation. After this episode he has tolerated all foods, including nuts, except pinions. In the literature reviewed the existence of cross-reactivity is confirmed between two pine species: Pinus cembra and Pinus pinea, and several antigenic determinants that may cause response in sensitised patients nuts. It should be noted that these bands are common, and can be as responsible panallergens for cross-reactivity in this food group.

She described symptoms of hoarseness, itching in mouth and ears, swelling at tounge and throath, difficulty in swallowing, dispnea, vertigo, loss of consciousness; 20 min after intake of parsley. It had happened 4 months ago. Method: Respiratory and food allergy panel has been carried out, along with skin prick test. No sensitisation has been detected. The patient was also subjected to a prick to prick test with fresh parsley puree. Ten min later, the patient developed symptoms like vertigo, respiratory distress, feeling of fullness in throat. The patient had to be evaluated in emergency conditions. Tension arterial was 80/40 mmHg. She was given 0.3 ml IM adrenalin, and intravenous fluid replacement was begun, along with other necessary anaphylaxis treatment medications. In clinical followup, the vital signs was stable. The prick test with parsley was positive with typical hyperemia and induration. The patient was given an 'adrenalin self-injection document' and taken to clinical follow-up.

Background: For the food allergy of infants of Japan, there is comparatively fewer soy bean anaphylaxis than an egg, milk and wheat. Recently it is reported that IgE to Gly m 5 and Gly m 6 is associated with severe allergic reactions to soybean in children. We examined a difference of soy bean specific IgE to Gly m 5, 6, 4 and 8 in the children induced anaphylaxis with the low allergenic fermented soybean food (Miso soup, and Nattou) and processed soy foods. Method: Specific IgE antibodies to Gly m 4, Gly m 5, Gly m 6, Gly m 8 was analyzed in sera from 11 Japanese children induced anaphylaxis with 6 fermented soy foods (2 cases by miso soup, 4 cases by Nattou) and 5 soy products (tofu, soy protein) aged 11 m~8 years old, and 8 nonsymptomatic cases aged 2-8 years old. All children were diagnosed either by food challenge or a clear history. Specific IgE antibodies to soybean, Gly m 4, Gly m 5, Gly m 6, Gly m 8 were measured by Immune-CAP. Results: Significant differences were noticed between the anaphylaxis cases and non-symptomatic group in sIgE. levels to soybean, Gly m 5, and Gly m 6 not in the sIgE level to Gym 8 and Gly m 4. Significant differences in the sIgE levels to Gly m 5 (P = 0.007) were detected between the anaphylaxis for fermented soy foods (66 AE 13 UA/ml) and soy products (13 AE 3.0 UA/ml), and significant differences (P = 0.0003) between non-symptomatic group (5.6 AE 2.5) . Specific IgE to Gy m 4 were negative in all soy anaphylaxis cases and on the other hand, were positive in two cases of non-symptomatic cases. Conclusion: In this study the levels of IgE responses to Gly m 5 were found to be associated with severe clinical reactions caused by fermented soybean in Japanese children. High IgE antibodies to Gly m 5 will therefore most likely better predict fermented soybean allergy.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3099, "end": 3111, "text": "(5.6 AE 2.5)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "691"}, {"text": "Gawro nska-Ukleja, EB; Ukleja-Soko\u0142owska, NE; _ Zbikowska-Gotz, M; Bartuzi, Z Allergology, Immunology and Internal Diseases, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University, Bydgoszcz, Poland", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A rare case of kaki allergy"}, {"text": "Background: There are only few described cases of patients allergic to kaki. Kaki is a fruit of a persimmon tree. Kaki allergens identified so far are: profilin Dio k 4, a protein, 17 kDa, homologous to Bet v 1, food related allergen Bet v 6which isoflavone reductase (IFR). Method: 7.74 year old female experiences extensive skin lesions in a form of polymorphous urticaria on the upper extremities, lower extremities and neck, and oedema of both eyelids. The symptoms were followed by vomiting and diarrhea. Symptoms occurred 10 min after ingestion of second half of a kaki fruit. The first half was consumed on the previous day without any side effects. Patient never experienced any symptoms of allergy and the family history of allergic diseases was negative. Symptoms resolved after steroids i.v. and antihistamine drugs. Skin prick tests (SPT) were performed with food allergens. The skin prick test using a standardised kaki allergen was not performed since the standardised allergen extract was not available. Prick by prick test with fresh kaki fruit was performed. The patient had a detailed diagnosis using the immunoblotting method. Results: Skin prick tests (SPT) with food allergens were negative. The prick by prick test with fresh kaki fruit was positive (Histamine 6/15 mm, kaki 15/15 mm). In immunoblotting no positive signal was obtained. Conclusion: Prick by prick test enabled to objectively confirm the source of symptoms in patient. Although there was no signal in immunoblotting, we presume that it did not exclude the presence of specific antibodies against kaki protein extract and the results may be a consequence of their low concentrations in the blood serum tested and partial change in allergen particles due to protein denaturation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A rare case of kaki allergy"}, {"text": "An interesting case; a kiwi allergy case in an adult that is not accompanied by latex allergy Bulut, _ I; \u20ac Ozs \u00dfeker, ZF Immunology and Allergy, Sureyyapas \u00dfa Chest Disease and Chest Surgery Training Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey Case: (H, S) 62 years old woman, applied to our clinic with complaint of kiwi allergy.

Allergic reactions provoked by tick bites include delayed mammalian meat anaphylaxis and immediate tick-induced anaphylaxis. Individuals allergic to mammalian meat after tick bites (first reported by van Nunen et al., 2007) possess IgE directed against alphagal (Commins et al., 2009) , and mammalian meat. Whilst several tick salivary proteins have been characterised in the sera of those with anaphylaxis to Ixodes holocyclus (Broady et al., 2011) there are currently no commercially available assays for tick salivary allergens. The presenting author noted that mammalian meat specific-IgE was detectable in tick anaphylaxis sufferers (van Nunen et al., 2012) . Alphagal has recently been found in the gastrointestinal tract of Ixodes ricinus (Hamsten et al., 2013) . The aim of this study was to examine the frequency of IgE directed against alphagal and mammalian meat in individuals with tick anaphylaxis who are both tolerant of, and regularly ingesting, mammalian meat. Method: Specific IgE directed against alphagal and mammalian meat was measured by Immunocap \u00e2 in tick anaphylaxis sufferers who were both tolerant of mammalian meat and were regularly ingesting mammalian meat (defined as consumption of mammalian meat 2-3 times weekly). Results: The sera of 41 mammalian meat tolerant patients with tick anaphylaxis were examined. Of these 41 patients, 37/41 (90%) had either or both alphagal and mammalian meat specific IgE detected. Of the 26/41 who had alphagal estimations, 24/26 (93%) had detectable anti-alphagal IgE (1/26 [3.8%] without co-existing mammalian meat specific IgE). 36/41 (90%) had mammalian meat specific IgE present. Of the 36/41 tick anaphylaxis sufferers with IgE specific for mammalian meat, 36/36 (100%) had beef specific IgE, 34/36 (94%) had mutton specific IgE and 35/36 (97%) had pork specific IgE present in their sera. Conclusion: In our study, the majority of patients with tick bite anaphylaxis had IgE directed against alphagal and/or mammalian meat, despite tolerating regular consumption of mammalian meat. In the absence of commercially available tests for tick salivary protein specific IgE, measurements of alphagal and mammalian meat specific IgE may serve as a useful surrogate in vitro marker in confirming a diagnosis of anaphylaxis due to Ixodes holocyclus. Background: Intramuscular (IM) epinephrine is the current standard treatment for anaphylaxis. Injection into the vastus lateralis muscle provides more rapid onset and higher peak plasma concentrations than subcutaneous routes. Most episodes of anaphylaxis occur outside of medical facilities and therefore require the use of epinephrine autoinjectors (EAI). Given the increasing epidemic of obesity affecting adults and children in Europe, we assessed whether the current commonly used EAIs have adequate needle length to ensure intramuscular delivery. The two common EAIs in the UK are Epipen with needle length 15.03 mm and Jext pen with needle length 15.36 mm. Method: Patients who had already been prescribed EAIs for a clinical history of anaphylaxis were examined with ultrasound (US) and measurements of subcutaneous tissue at anterolateral thigh, anterior thigh and deltoid areas were performed. Results: Twenty-eight patients took part in the study with female to male ratio 23:5 and age range 18-75 years. BMI ranged from 18-44 and skin to muscle distance for vastus lateralis ranged from 66 mm to 335 mm. In 19 patients (68%) the skin to muscle distance was significantly greater than EAI needle length. This number was reduced to 46% for the anterior thigh and to 18% for the deltoid area. Conclusion: Jext and Epipens do not have sufficient needle length to administer IM adrenaline in 68% of our patient group using the vastus lateralis site. We would recommend that when epinephrine is prescribed, a clinical assessment should be made of subcutaneous depth and if in doubt an US should be performed. In Emergency Departments or Respiratory Clinic this would be facilitated by the routine presence of hand held US equipment. Pharmaceutical companies also need to consider producing EAIs with longer needle length.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 485, "end": 508, "text": "van Nunen et al., 2007)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 547, "end": 569, "text": "(Commins et al., 2009)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 713, "end": 734, "text": "(Broady et al., 2011)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 923, "end": 947, "text": "(van Nunen et al., 2012)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1031, "end": 1053, "text": "(Hamsten et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "FIGREF53"}], "section": "697"}, {"text": "Anaphylaxis: a diagnosis we 0 re allergy to?", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "699"}, {"text": "Deiratany, S; Collier, JD Children's University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland Background: Anaphylaxis describes a potentially life threatening hypersensitivity reaction of acute onset. It is a condition that is under-reported internationally due to a failure by patients and healthcare professionals to properly recognise its signs and symptoms. We aimed to audit the recognition and management of patients presenting with anaphylaxis to our Emergency Department (ED) by retrospectively applying World Allergy Organisation (WAO) criteria for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis. Method: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients discharged from the ED from January 2007 to December 2012 with a diagnosis of 'anaphylaxis' as noted on our clinical information system. Results: Twenty-six patients (19 males, seven females, mean age 6.6 years) met the criteria. Notes were unavailable for one patient. Six patients did not meet the WAO criteria for diagnosis of anaphylaxis. Nuts were the most common allergen cited in the patient's history. 19 (100%) patients met WAO criteria: 2 (10.5%) were administered with adrenaline by a parent before arrival at the ED, 1 (5.3%) received from an ambulance crew en route to the ED, 4 (21%) were administered adrenaline by a general practitioner, and 3 (15.8%) had adrenaline prescribed and administered in ED after presentation. 9 (47.4%) patients did not receive adrenaline. With regard to discharge instructions and follow-up for this group, 9 (47.4%) patients had clearly documented follow-up with various clinics and care-givers. Nine patients (47.4%) were discharged with a prescription for an adrenaline pen. Conclusion: Anaphylaxis is an under recognised phenomenon, and in this department there were wide variations in its treatment and follow-up. Improvements in recognition will result from education and training of medical and nursing staff, the use of proforma documentation guiding treatment where anaphylaxis is suspected, improved discharge instructions and the provision of adrenaline pen training for parents and children by ED staff. Background: Food-dependent exerciseinduced anaphylaxis (FDEIAn) is considered rare. It is a potentially life-threatening syndrome where allergic symptoms appear when exercise is performed within hours after ingesting a particular food source. For fish as the culprit food-source only few cases has been reported. For the diagnostics of FDEIAn the clinical history is often sufficient. However an exercise challenge can be necessary to reproduce the symptoms. Nevertheless there is a lack of validated exercise protocols and often a lack of reproducibility of symptoms. Method: A 34-year old male presented in the clinic with a medical history of a severe allergic reaction after ingestion of pasta and salmon followed by a run. The patient was first tested with SPT and IgE for gluten and salmon. Then the patient was challenged with 200 grams of pasta followed by exercise 30 min after ingestion. Afterwards the patient was challenged with 100 grams of salmon followed by exercise and finally the patient was challenged with 200 grams of salmon followed by exercise. Results: There was no allergic reaction to the first two challenges with pasta (gluten) and 100 grams of salmon. However the challenge with 200 grams of salmon elicited an anaphylactic reaction with universal itching, vomiting, oedema, drop in peak flow and decreased blood pressure. The patient responded well to Epinephrine. A possible co-factor could be that the patient had used 400 mg of NSAID due to a lower back pain the morning of the final challenge. Conclusion: Even though it is questionable whether the patient responded to the additional amount of allergen or the reaction was facilitated by the NSAID it is clear that the patient did not respond to 100 grams of allergen followed by exercise. It is therefore shown that it is difficult to exclude an allergy diagnose through an oral food challenge even though the challenge is performed with similar settings as the medical history (i.e. exercise in this case). Background: Severe reactions are a main concern of OIT. Method: To characterise cases who required Intensive Care Unit admission for anaphylaxis to OIT doses among patients aged 5-18 on CM-OIT (N = 80) or egg-OIT (N = 50). Results: Case 1: An egg-allergic boy aged 12 experienced severe bronchoconstriction, hypotension and hypoxaemia, followed by urticaria, 1 h after an scheduled dose increase on 4th month of OIT in our Unit (1.8 g egg protein). Immediate treatment was given (adrenaline -3 doses-, salbutamol, hydroxicine, saline, steroids). Ventilation was needed for 8 h. He denied initial symptoms. Fasting and mild exercise -walk-might have acted as co-factors. He had well-controlled asthma on 'ICON step 3' treatment. Pre-OIT egg white-IgE: 75 kU/l. Case 2: A CM-allergic boy aged 14 had vomiting, urticaria, bronchoconstriction and hypotension leading to unconsciousness minutes after having 3.8 g CM protein on 5th month of OIT at home. Despite early im adrenaline, he needed advanced resuscitation and ventilation for 48 h. He had skipped OIT doses for 3 days and mistakenly increased his dose in 0.8 g. He had asthma on 'step 3' treatment, which became partly controlled since OIT start. Pre-OIT casein-IgE: 195 kU/l. Case 3: A CM-allergic boy aged 15 had dyspnea and dizziness, which progressed to hypotension, unconsciousness and respiratory arrest minutes after having 6 g CM protein on 17th month of OIT. Resuscitation and adrenaline were applied at ambulance. Ventilation was needed for 28 h. He was not carrying adrenaline. Fasting and mild exercise were involved. He had uncontrolled asthma on 'step 4' treatment. Controller medication compliance was poor and he had started smoking. Pre-OIT casein-IgE: >100 kU/l. Conclusions: Patients who had life-threatening reactions to OIT share common features: teenager, high specific IgE, persistent asthma -poorly controlled in two cases-and risky attitudes. OIT involves high risks in such patients. Strict monitoring is essential. Background: Allergic reactions to poultry meat, including chicken and turkey, are rare, while allergic reactions to poultry products such as feathers and eggs are more common. The symptoms range from oral allergy syndrome to anaphylactic reactions. We present a patient with turkey meat allergy without any history of other allergies. Method: An obtained history from a 23year-old female suggested turkey meat as the cause of her symptoms. She developed abdominal cramping 15 min after ingestion of turkey meat as well as chicken meat, suggesting turkey meat as the causal agent. The patient had never been diagnosed with asthma and was not sensitised to any common respiratory allergens. The results of specific IgE testing and a turkey food challenge is presented. No allergen skin prick testing was performed. In addition, turkey extract was prepared from turkey meat, separated by SDS PAGE and assessed for IgE reactivity by immunoblotting. Results: ImmunoCAP Specific IgE was positive for turkey and increased by more than 50% (from 0.44 kUA/l to 0.67 kUA/ l) after a food challenge with 100 g of turkey meat. Assessment of turkey extract for sIgE reactivity in immunoblotting suggested specific, but weak recognition of 2-3 bands, the identity of which remain open so far. Conclusion: This case describes an IgEmediated type-1 allergic reaction to turkey. The patient was not egg allergic and was not tested for other poultry meats as she did not report any other symptoms. This case outlines the importance of a detailed history in determining possible causative agents of allergic reactions with the use of IgE testing and food challenge. We confirmed the results using Western blot. Cross-reactivity between goose, duck, turkey and chicken meat has previously been demonstrated. Our patient tolerated duck meat but has not been challenged with goose meat.

In the evening, about 30 min after dinner, she showed a generalised urticaria, itching of the nose and mouth mucosa, difficulty swallowing, feeling of a lump in the throat and dyspnea. She was treated emergently. The dinner of the patient consisted of a mushroom omelette with salt, pepper, eggs and selfcollected bay boletus and coffee. Other foods that were consumed at the same day by the patient have been eaten since then and tolerated again. Cofactors, such as infections, alcohol or physical exertion, were not involved. Furthermore the patient has a ciprofloxacin-hypersensitivity, a seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis to pollen from grasses after immunotherapy, atopic eczema, an allergy to animal hair and an oral allergy syndrome to nuts. Results: Prick-to-prick tests (PP) to the homemade bay boletus omelette eaten by the patient before the reaction and to bay boletus (Boletus badius) were positive, as well as to shiitake, oyster mushroom und champignon (Agaricus campestris). Total IgE level was 341 UI/ml and sIgE was positive to grasses and birch pollen, cat dander and hazelnut. An oral challenge test with omelette without bay boletus was performed and well tolerated. Other prick test negative fungi such as mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) chanterelle and cep were also well tolerated. An oral provocation test with the culprit and with the prick positive fungi was not performed due to the primary severe reaction. With avoidance of the PP positive mushrooms, no further reactions occurred. An allergen characterisation of boletus badius is currently being attempted. Conclusion: Due to the patient 0 s history and the positive skin test results we diagnosed an allergy to bay boletus. Bay boletus (Boletus badius) is a species of fungus in the family of boletus. Boletus is a genus of mushroom, comprising over 100 species. Bay boletus are popular and common edible mushrooms in Germany. To our knowledge an allergy has not been published yet. In recent years, some reports of fungi allergies, especially on Boletus edulis (cep, yellow boletus) have been published. In our case, yellow boletus was well tolerated.

The aim of this study is to analyze the family history in infants with acute allergic accidents triggered by food. Method: The authors have studied acute allergic accidents triggered by food in children aged under 1 year admitted in the Toxicology-ICU Department of Emergency Hospital for Children 'Grigore Alexandrescu', Bucharest in a period of 24 months. We noted in all cases age, gender, family history of allergy, data of food anamnesis, signs and symptoms of illness. We identified food allergens by corroborating history (recent dietary attempts) with physical examination and laboratory data (specific IgE). Results: Between May 2011 and April 2013, 24 infants (13 boys, 11 girls) were admitted in the department with a diagnosis of acute allergic accident. We identified the following clinical forms: acute urticaria, angioedema, immediate gastrointestinal reactions, anaphylaxis. Cow 0 s milk proteins (CMP) were the allergic trigger in most cases (n = 16, 66.7%). We found a family history positive for allergy in 21 cases (87.5%). Eleven of these had at least two first-degree relatives (parents, siblings) with a history positive for allergy. Fifteen patients with CMP allergy had a positive family history. Conclusion: Food allergy is a major concern for specialists in pediatrics, allergology and immunology. Selecting the population at risk based on family history and development of nutritional strategies for preventing the onset of food allergy in the first years of life are key issues in the management of this condition. Background: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a functional disorder that affects with clinical history of abdominal pain/discomfort, associated with alteration of the hive. A nickel-related pro-inflammatory status has been documented at intestinal mucosal level. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible association between IBS and amount of nickel taken with their usual diet, and in a pilot group to assess whether a low nickel content diet obtained an improvement of symptoms. Method: Seventy-five patients with a diagnosis of IBS were included in the study. The patients filled a validated food/symptom diary for 2 weeks, and the data obtained were analyzed to evaluate a possible statistically significant association between the days in which they had symptoms and the intake of high nickel content (HNC) diet. The patients were then divided into two subgroups, IBS-constipated (IBS-C, 12 pts) and IBS-diarrhea (IBS -D, 63 pts) based on the Rome III criteria. Results: An association between symptomatic days and HNC diet was statistically significant in each subgroup. The results showed that the patients had a statistically significant association (P = 0.002) between diet days with HNC and the presentation of symptoms. Furthermore, the data have corroborated the presence of a limit threshold to define an ANC diet, equal to 600 lg/day, which had been derived through animal studies, but had never been validated for the man. Comparing subgroups separately IBS-D and IBS -C, the association between symptomatic days/ HNC diet resulted statistically significant only in the first group (P < 0.001 vs P = 0.119), in agreement with the hypothesis that the contact between the intestinal mucosa and Nickel can activate an inflammatory response in Ni-sensitive subjects. The second part of the study included 11 patients with IBS-D, who, after complet-ing a free diet food/symptoms, has been proposed a diet considered low nickel content (LNC), during which it was required to recompile the diary to compare the number of days with symptoms in the two different diets. Patients who have joined in a satisfactory manner to the diet showed an improvement in the presentation of symptoms, turned out to be statistically significant (P = 0.046). Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that a low nickel content diet can lead to an improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms, but more studies are needed for comparison with a control group for confirmation. Background: Despite all the undertaken measures, the prevalence of food intolerance (allergy/pseudo allergy) is increasing every year. It is necessary to consider that dermal syndrome is only a fraction of its symptoms. The greater part of themare gastrointestinal manifestations, frequently underestimated and undiagnosed. Therefore, the symptoms of food allergy are masked and burdened by accompanying diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. The aim: To establish whether the correction of the gastrointestinal pathology affects the course of food allegy. Method: During the two-stage prospective study, we picked 54 patients with severe food allergy in history from 312 examined cases. Age of the respondents ranged from 17 to 65 years, with an average of 35.0 + 3.2 years.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Poster Session Group I -Blue"}, {"text": "Male/female = 35.2%/ 64.8%, respectively. Two groups were formed: with the proven food allergy (31) and the alleged pseudoallergic reactions (23). The inclusion criteria for the first group was as followselevated levels of IgE or IgG4 to food products, typical anamnestic data (beginning at a young age, dose-independent reaction). Subsequently therapy of the discovered diseases of the gastrointestinal tract such as GERD, gastro, helminthic infestations, giardiasis, bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine, large intestine dysbiosis was conducted. The results of the treatment were assessed at 6 months. Result: At the moment, 12 people underwent a full course of therapy, seven people from the group with the proven food allergies and five with pseudoallergic reactions. Only 1 (14.3%) patient with a true food allergy, not noted improvement in disease course, in other 11 cases we registered a positive dynamics in the course of the food allergy in a varying degree. Three patients (60%) with pseudoallergic reactions observed complete absence of symptoms of food intolerance for 6 months after treatment. Conclusion: Despite the small sampling, the data suggest that: Correction of the pathology of the gastrointestinal tract has undoubted beneficial effect (91.6% of cases) on the course of the food allergy. However, the most significant improvement in the state (up to complete relief of the symptoms) is seen in the cases with pseudoallergic reactions to food. This pattern may be used as a standard procedure in the differential diagnosis. Background: Food allergy is the most common atopy manifestation in early childhood. This food allergy triggers atopic dermatitis in 30-40% of all children affected. Standard of care involves an exclusion diet that reduces symptoms, but this diet has a risk to be nutritionally incomplete. Sinlac is a rice and carob based infant cereal, allergens-free, offering full nutritional support for children suffering from food allergies. Apple polyphenols have previously shown some effect on mitigating allergic reactions. Objective: Investigate the safety and tolerability of Sinlac cereals (AE apple polyphenols) in infants with atopic symptoms. Methods: The clinical trial is an open labeled study (NCT01029184) to assess tolerance (symptoms stability) of Sinlac cereals compared to well-known allergenic foods during an open allergenic test enrolling 51 infants (4 to 40 months) with atopic symptoms (positive skin prick test or positive RAST-IgE or positive patch test). Primary endpoint was the risk of positive reaction to the allergenic tests. Study products were Sinlac, Sinlac + apple polyphenol extract (0.3% in matrix), wheat, potatoes, cow's milk and hen's egg. Results: Fourty-eight subjects completed the study. Both Sinlac and Sinlac + Apple polyphenol extract were significantly better tolerated by atopic infants compared to other allergenic foods: allergic reactions were 2% with Sinlac and Sinlac + Apple polyphenols and 49% with wheat, potatoes, cow's milk and hen egg. Valid conclusions and inferences can be drawn even though the number of subjects analyzed (51 in ITT) was lower than those supposed to complete the study. Conclusion: Sinlac and Sinlac containing apple polyphenols are safe and well tolerated by atopic infants and children. Future studies are needed to assess the efficacy of addition of apple polyphenols to infant cereals such as Sinlac on managing atopic symptoms.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Poster Session Group I -Blue"}, {"text": "Withdrawal of immunosuppressive drug decreased serum IgE levels in food allergy and eosinophilic gastroenteritis after cord blood stem cell transplantation with tacrolimus therapy Inoue, Y 1 ; Morita, Y 1 ; Arima, T 1 ; Shimojo, N 1 ; Kohno, Y 2 1 Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan; 2 Chiba Rosai Hospital, Ichihara, Japan Introduction: We previously reported patients who developed food allergy (FA)related gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms after cord blood stem cell transplantation (CBSCT) using tacrolimus (FK506). We herein report on a successful therapeutic management of a patient with FA and eosinophilic gastroenteritis after CBSCT in whom elimination diet switch from FK506 to cyclosporine (CsA) decreased serum levels of IgE, allowing food reintroduction. Case: A 2-month-old Japanese male was diagnosed with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 3. At 7 months of age, CBSCT was performed. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of FK506 and shortterm methotrexate. By age 15 months, he occasionally experienced vomiting and frequent diarrhea. A food challenge test with egg caused severe hives. Consequently, we diagnosed him to have egg allergy. GI endoscopy showed edema of the entire esophageal wall and erythema with dense eosinophilic infiltration in the walls of the stomach, duodenum and colon. As his total IgE was getting increased to 4461 IU/ ml when he was 23 months old, we decided to switch his immunosuppressive drug from FK506 to CsA. He rapidly responded with an improved appetite, and his total IgE decreased to 408 IU/ml. His total IgE decreased further to 82 IU/ml after he stopped taking CsA due to its side effect 9 months later. When he was 42 months old, he showed negative food challenges to egg, milk and soy bean.

Case report: A 26-year-old female (grav-ida2, para1) in 25 weeks of gestation, with a medical history of atopic dermatitis, but without a history of any food allergies or anaphylaxis, was brought to the emergency department because of dyspnea, generalised itchy rash, abdominal pain, and severe uterine contractions. She reported that she ate Japanese soba, fish, shrimp, crabs and vegetables, and developed the symptoms starting within 15-30 min. Her blood pressure was 104/72 mmHg, heart rate 112, respiratory rate 40, SPO2 100% (under supplemental 100% oxygen), and she was immediately treated by normal saline infusion, epinephrine i.m. injection two times, and additional H1-antihistamine, methylprednisolone. Obstetrically, fetal heart rate was almost normal (140-160 bpm) with variability and ultrasonography showed a vital fetus in the absence of fetal distress. Biphasic reaction of anaphylaxis did not occur and the patient rapidly recovered. On day 7, the patient was discharged. After 11 weeks, the baby was born without neurological deficiency. We could not disclose the cause of anaphylaxis in the mother. Discussions: Anaphylaxis is a relatively infrequent event during pregnancy, but maternal hypoxemia and hypotension can develop a potential risk of life-threating event to both a mother and a fetus. We should immediately commence measures to prevent further development of anaphylaxis reaction and fetus brain damage. Patients may require administration of intravenous vasopressors or caesarean delivery. More investigations toward the pharmacologic management and consensus for better directions in anaphylaxis treatment during pregnancy are necessary. Background: Cow's milk (CM) oral immunotherapy (OIT) use has increased in recent years, and has proven to be an effective procedure. However, studies about long-term evolution are limited. Objective: To evaluate long-term evolution of OIT, including dietary impact, adverse reactions, and patient's family satisfaction. Method: Fifty-two patients that had undergone a CM OIT treatment were included. All patients had fulfilled the treatment at least 4 years before the study period. Clinical and laboratory data was reviewed. Follow-up data was collected by means of a questionnaire. Patients were asked about daily CM consumption and symptoms associated with ingestion. Current family satisfaction was expressed as a value from 0 (lowest) to 10 (highest). Daily intake: unlimited in 19 patients (36.6%), one dairy serving plus free diet in 32 (61.5%), and less than one serving in 1 (1.9%). Thirty-six patients (69.2%) enjoyed drinking CM, while 43 (82.7%) tolerated cheese. Adverse reactions: 15 (28.8%) had three or more episodes, 10 patients (19.2%) suffered <3 episodes, while 27 patients (51.9%) denied any adverse reaction. Symptoms were mild (64%), moderate (16%) and severe (20%). Triggers: unapparent (52%), exercise (24%), infec-tions (16%) and other (8%). Current level of satisfaction: mean 9.8 (range 7-10). Conclusions: Isolated adverse reactions after OIT are not uncommon, but they are mostly mild. Satisfaction with the treatment is very high. A third of patients have unlimited dairy intake, but many patients chose to keep a minimum daily ingestion of CM in order to ensure a free diet.

Better risk assessment, management and communication requires cooperative working between many different stakeholder groups. Organisational culture, professional focus, lack of capacity and even lack of esteem have prevented sufficiently close working relationships. We describe the formation and development of an electronic food sensitivity knowledge network as a model for multidisciplinary working for the benefit of people with food sensitivity. Method: The Food Allergy and Food Intolerance Network established a presence in cyberspace and aims to improve the quality of life of those with food allergies or food intolerance and reduce the risk of anaphylaxis, make it easier for food companies to supply safe food for sufferers, and promote exchange of knowledge. Results: The Network has grown to over 400 members and achieved successes as follows. Regulation: The island of Ireland encompasses two jurisdictions. To avoid consumers and businesses being impacted upon by two different approaches to the new Food Information Regulation the Network facilitated the regulators in each jurisdiction to work together to avoid discrepancies and differences. Risk Management in Catering: Providing information on allergens and catering for people with allergies is daunting for many in the catering sector. The Network commissioned a professional film maker to make three 10 min videos, freely available on YouTube. These demonstrate how life can be made better and safer for people with allergies in the catering sector. Supporting Patient Support Groups: Allergy Awareness Week is a key means by which Allergy N I disseminates and influences on behalf of people with food allergies. Working together we made an impact with the media and politicians that, alone, we could not have achieved. Political Awareness: The Network has worked with the All Party Group on Science at the Northern Ireland Parliament to host talks and discussions on allergy helping to raise political awareness. Conclusion: The work and development of the Network include the functionality of the social medium electronic base and the interpersonal relationships built up within and outside of cyber space. The Network has grown and proved to be a valuable resource and influenced on behalf of people with allergies and intolerances. It is hoped that further synergies can be grown by joint working with EAACI in the future. Background: A high percentage of the population has symptoms consistent with allergies. In recent years an increasing number of people reported various food allergy symptoms. The diverse forms of allergy presentation led us to propose learning if the general population is aware of our specialty and explore the extent of their knowledge regarding food allergy. Method: Participants were asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire which asked for basic socio-demographic information (age, sex, educational level, presenting allergy, habitat), and various questions about food allergy (general, fruits, eggs, nuts, anisakis, spices and treatment of the reaction). There were 16 questions with three choices and a single correct answer. Scoring was as follows: correct answer +1, incorrect answer \u00c01 and do not know/no answer 0. Results: A total of 320 people completed the questionnaire (128 men, 40%) with a mean age of 20 years. Ninety-nine (31%) were considered allergic and 100% of these had been seen by a doctor for this reason. A total of 207 (65%) were university students. A total of 125 (39%) expressed interest in the subject of allergies. One hundred of those surveyed reported searching the Internet regarding health questions. The final average score was four points (out of 16). Thirty-one percent believed that celiac disease is an allergic disease. Only 44% (140) knew that there are allergies to spices (such as oregano and mustard). Seventeen percent thought that individuals allergic to the olive tree cannot eat olives. Seventy-five percent knew that anisakis is a fish-borne parasite, although only 38% knew that vinegar does not kill it. Fifty-two percent did not know there are egg allergies that allow consumption of the yolk. Just 12% knew that some people who are allergic to latex should avoid tropical fruits. Sixty-two percent knew that people allergic to fruit peel can sometimes tolerate eating the peeled fruit. Sixty percent did not know whether those allergic to wild cereals can eat bread and 48% did not know that adrenaline can be life-saving in a severe reaction. Conclusion: Overall, the general population has scant knowledge about food allergy. The low success rate on some questions leads us to emphasize the importance of health education about diseases that are increasingly prevalent in the general population.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "714"}, {"text": "The effect of processing on the allergenicity of mealworm proteins Broekman, H 1 ; Knulst, A 1 ; den Hartog Jager, S 1 ; Gaspari, M 2 ; de Jong Govardus, A 3 ; Houben, G 3 ; Verhoeckx, K 3 1 University Children's Hospital, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands; 2 Universit a 'Magna Graecia' di Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy; 3 TNO, Zeist, The Netherlands", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "716"}, {"text": "Background: Due to the imminent growth of the world population, shortage of protein sources for human consumption will arise in the near future. Alternative and sustainable protein sources (e.g. insects and algae) are now being explored for the production of food and feed. Mealworm (Tenebrio molitor) as a new protein source is of great interest since less energy and agricultural land is needed for the production and less greenhouse gasses are produced. Previously the allergenicity of mealworm proteins was assessed using imunnoblot and indirect Basophil activation test (BAT) (*Verhoeckx et al.). The results indicated a cross reactivity with house dust mite (HDM) and crustaceans, two common causes of allergy. In this study the effect of processing on the allergenicity of mealworm proteins was investigated. Methods: Different mealworm extracts (in tris, urea and SDS/DTT buffer) were prepared from raw, blanched, boiled, baked and fried mealworms. The protein patterns were identified using SDS page and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spec-trometry (LC-MS). The allergenicity was assessed using direct BAT and immunoblots with serum from patients with a food allergy to crustaceans and an inhalant allergy to HDM or sensitised to mealworm proteins. Furthermore, skin prick tests (SPT) prepared from the different processed mealworms were tested on the same patients. Results: The SDS page gels showed a clear difference in protein patterns between the processed and non-processed mealworm extracts. Processing had a clear effect on the solubility of the proteins, but no significant effect was observed on the allergenicity of the extracts in immunoblot, BAT or SPT. Introduction: The incidence of food allergy is increasing during the last two decades and affecting about 8% of young children and about 3% of adults. Gut bacteria play an important role in induction of oral immune tolerance to food components and in prevention of food allergies. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of two selected clones of gut probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus sp.) on an allergic sensitisation in a germ-free mouse model of food allergy. Methods: Two Lactobacillus clones with divergent immunomodulating properties were selected according in vitro testing of various clones of Lactobacillus species. Germ-free BALB/c mice were colonised with these two selected bacterial clones. Then, conventional and colonised mice were sensitised intraperitoneally and challenged intragastrically with ovalbumin antigen. Physiological symptoms (temperature, weight and allergic diarrhea) were observed during mice challenging. Levels of allergen specific serum antibodies were determined by ELISA (IgA, IgG1 and IgG2a) or by beta-hexosaminidase release test (IgE). Mast cell protease-1 (MMCP-1) were determined in sera and cytokine production in supernatants after mesenterial and spleen cells cultivation were determined by ELISA. Changes in induction of regulatory T cells, activities of brush-border hydrolases in jejunum and ileum, and levels of histamine in mice excrement were also determined. Results: We observed that the colonisation with two selected bacterial clones (Lactobacillus sp.) with divergent immunomodulating properties had a different effect on the allergic sensitisation and also differed from the conventional mice.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "716"}, {"text": "Conclusion: This mouse model of food allergy allows us to understand immune mechanisms by which various clones of probiotic bacteria influence allergic sensitisation in the gut. Background: Induction of oral tolerance (IOT) is a therapeutic alternative in those patients with food allergy as cow 0 s milk protein (CMP) or egg allergy. However, it remains still unknown whether long-term complications may occur as a result of such treatment. We describe seven cases of eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases observed during IOT performance. Method: We evaluated 75 patients on whom we administered IOT treatment to CMP and 24 patients to egg according to our protocol. We did a clinical follow-up at 6 months and then annually, asking specifically about digestive symptoms. Background: Respiratory epithelial cells play an important role in defense mechanisms of the lung by releasing chemokines responsible for recruitment of immune cells. Their receptor structures are able to recognise different signals from the environment and in the case of injury respond immediately by upregulation of proinflammatory genes. IL-1 related cytokines share similarities in their receptor distribution and signaling pathways, however, overlapping actions of these cytokines have not been clearly demonstrated. The aim of our study was to compare the capacity of different IL-1 related cytokines to stimulate the production and release of multiple CC and CXC chemokines by epithelial cells. Method: The chemokine gene expression has been studied using an cDNA array system in human alveolar type-II like cells A549 stimulated by IL-1 beta, IL-18, and IL-33. The chemokine levels in culture supernatants were measured using multiplex immunoluminometric assay (Luminex technology) or by ELISA. Results: In repetitive experiments, epithelial cells constitutively expressed mRNA for CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL6, and CXCL8. Stimulation with 50 ng/ml of IL-1beta for 24 h resulted in upregulation of 17 chemokine genes with the biggest increase in mRNA density being found in CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL18 (DC-CK1), CCL24 (eotaxin-2), CXCL3 (GROalpha), CXCL5 (ENA-78), CXCL8 (IL-8), and CXCL11 (I-TAC) genes. In two chemokine genes, CCL26 (eotaxin-3) and CXCL16 (SR-PSOX), slight downregulation of mRNA density was detected upon IL-1beta stimulation. Stimulation of A549 cells with 50 ng/ml of IL-18 slightly upregulated the expression of CCL1 (I-309), CCL5 (RAN-TES) and CCL15 (HCC2) while IL-33 stimulation resulted in moderate increase of mRNA density in chemokines CCL1 (I-309), CCL11 (eotaxin), CXCL11 (I-TAC), and XCL2 (SCM-1beta) as compared to unstimulated cells.

HAE 2 Mutational analysis can help if C1INH deficiency likely but serology uncertain. We present three patients from the same family with an identical 'HAE 2' mutation whose serology was aytpical and more like HAE 1. Many authorities state that both C1inh and C4 level are required for diagnosis, but even that can be misleading. Methods: A 22 year-old lady presenting with a new diagnosis of symptomatic HAE had marginally reduced C1INH and C1INHF with low C4 when well. Her father and 1 of 2 brothers also had angioedema. One of our existing HAE type 1 patients was her paternal great uncle. Serial C1INH, C1INHF in her father and great uncle were similarly unremarkable when they were between attacks, irrespective of treatment. C1INH was neither as high as in typical HAE 2 nor as low as in typical HAE 1 and could not reliably be stated to be diagnostic of either. Genotyping was therefore performed. Results: Three family members (index case, father and paternal great uncle) had a heterozygous 0 S438P/p.Ser460 Pro exchange 0 mutation previously associated with HAE type 2 yet were serologically unremarkable or Type 1. Only C1INHF and C4 changes during an attack reliably differentiated affected individuals. Conclusion: This mutation has previously been reported with a HAE 2 serological picture although the serology is not available to confirm this. Nevertheless serological diagnosis of HAE can be more uncertain than is generally recognised as this type 1 family often had atypical patterns.

Spearman rank correlation analysis was performed to assess inter-relations between of CD95 positive ejaculated sperm as well as cytokines in the seminal plasma. Results: Chronic abacterial and bacterial inflammation of the prostatic gland was accompanied by increased CD95 positive ejaculated sperm (P < 0.05) with no significant difference between patients with chronic abacterial prostatitis and chronic bacterial prostatitis. Twent-four h after ejaculation the number of CD95 positive sperm in patients with chronic abacterial prostatitis increases (P < 0.05), but in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis remains constant (P > 0.05). The number of CD95 positive sperm correlates with TGF-b1 but not with the number of leukocytes, or the levels of TNF-a, IL-6 or IL-8.

Background: The most effective way for influenza disease control is specific immunisation. This study compares immunogenicity of two inactivated influenza vaccines Fluvaxin and Vaxigrip used for immunisation of adults in Minsk, Belarus. Methods: This study assessed 157 people, of whom 81 had been vaccinated with Fluvaxin (Group 1), vs 76 vaccinated with Vaxigrip (Group 2). All participants had blood sampled before vaccination, and again 28 AE 7 days after vaccination. Specific antibodies determined by haemagglutinin using sera in HAI were determined employing WHO approved methods. Immunogenicity assessment was conducted in accordance with the requirements of the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP). Results: In Group 1 persons with protective antibody titers after immunisation significantly increased from 29.6% to 65.4% for influenza virus H1N1, from 19.8% to 61.7% for influenza A virus/H3N2, and from 22.2% to 58% for influenza B viruses (P < 0.05). Levels of sero-conversion for all three antigenic components of the vaccine in the vaccinated group met CPMP criteria. In Group2, protective antibody titers after vaccination also significantly increased from 5.3% to 51.3% for influenza virus H1N1, from 3.9% to 23.7% for influenza virus A/H3N2, and from 15.8% to 71.1% for influenza B viruses (P < 0.05). However, a seroconversion increase of less than 40% occurred for H1N1 and influenza B. Immunisation increased the geometric mean antibodies titers to all three components of the vaccines most notably for influenza virus H1N1. Conclusion: Used as prevention of influenza in adults Minsk, the inactivated vaccines Fluvaxin and Vaxigrip both demonstrated immunogenicity but differed in the magnitude of the antibody titers induced towards specific influenza types. These findings may impact vaccine utilisation as prophylaxis for specific types of anticipated influenza epidemics. Background: Histamine is a key immunoregulatory mediator in both immediate type hypersensitivity reactions and chronic inflammatory responses. Toll-like receptors (TLR) recognise bacterial ligands and histamine alters TLR signaling cascades, in particular via histamine receptor 2 (H2R). However, the influence of histamine on TLR responses in cells from inflamed patients has been poorly described. Method: Forty seven patients diagnosed with IBD (24 with Crohn's disease and 23 with ulcerative colitis) and 24 healthy volunteers were included in the study. Expression of histamine receptors (H1, H2, H4R), histamine-related enzymes (HDC, HNMT and DAO) as well as TLR-1, TLR-2, TLR-4, TLR-5 and TLR-9 was investigated using REAL-TIME PCR. Cytokine levels were determined in culture supernatants after 24-h Pam 3 -Cys (TLR-2 ligand) stimulation in the presence or absence of histamine or famotidine (H2R antagonist). T cell, B cell and monocyte expression of histamine receptors was evaluated by flow cytometry. Results: Significant differences in H1R, H4R, TLR-6, TLR-9 and DAO gene expression were observed in patients with IBD compared to healthy volunteers. Although TLR-2 and H2R gene expression was similar for healthy volunteers and IBD patients, cytokine responses were significantly different. Histamine altered TLR-2induced IL-12, TNF-a, G-CSF, IFN-g, MCP-1, IL-1b, IL-6 and GM-CSF secretion from healthy volunteers, while similar histamine effects on TLR-2-induced cytokine responses in IBD patients was only observed for TNF-a and G-CSF. Histamine mediated these effects primarily through the H2R as famotidine negated the differential response. The percentage of H2R+ monocytes was significantly reduced for IBD patients, compared to healthy volunteers. Conclusion: Patients with IBD display dysregulated expression of TLRs and histamine receptors. The anti-inflammatory influence of H2R signaling on TLR-2 innate immune response is abrogated in IBD patients, suggesting that deliberate manipulation of H2R-signalling may provide beneficial effects to patients with IBD.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "727"}, {"text": "The role of neurotrophin in a murine model of house dust mite induced allergic rhinitis Background: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) and mucosal inflammation disease mediated by IgE-associated processes that is characterised by sneezing, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea. The imbalance of Th1/Th2 immune response is considered to contribute to allergic diseases, however the interval between inflammation and AHR remains unclear. Growing information illustrated that nerve growth factor (NGF), a neurotrophin, plays an important role in neuroimmune interactions by augmenting an existing Th2 immune response. Method: Since probiotics and biocompatible water-soluble chitosan (WSC) have been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory properties that could inhibit the development of allergic Th2 response, we aim to assess the effect of WSC and probiotic extracts on NGF in Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p)-induced AR murine model. Results: Intranasal administration of both WSC and probiotic extracts attenuated AHR in Der p-challenged mice due to a lower respiratory resistance and improved the nasal congestion by manifestation higher respirator rate than non-treated mice. Under management of both WSC and probiotic extracts, the thickness of nasal respiratory epithelium was reduced in microscopy. Both of WSC and probiotic extracts treatment moderated allergic inflammation including a decreased level of total and Der p-specific IgE in the serum, lowered expressions of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 in nasal lavage fluid, as well as less eosinphil infiltration in the nasal cavity. In particular, therapeutics with both treatments reduced NGF performance in nasal lavage fluid along with its receptors, p75NTR and TrkA, in the respiratory epithelium of nasal mucosa in Der p-stimulated mice. Conclusion: We suggested that the reduced NGF and its receptor levels may correspond to a decrease in AHR and mucosa inflammation by both WSC and probiotic extracts treatment. Background: Delivery of intramuscular adrenaline with an epinephrine autoinjector (EAI) is first line emergency treatment for anaphylaxis, but failure to administer the drug promptly and effectively could prove fatal. Therefore patients must have sufficient knowledge about anaphylaxis and in the correct use of their EAI device. We assessed the knowledge of patients with known anaphylaxis about their condition and EAI technique. Method: Patients diagnosed with anaphylaxis were identified from hospital records and invited to complete a written anaphylaxis questionnaire and a practical demonstration using a training EAI. Results: Twenty-eight patients took part in the study. Only one completed all of the EAI demonstration correctly. Four patients admitted they did not know how to use an EAI.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "730"}, {"text": "None of the 28 patients scored 100% on the questionnaire.

Conclusion: Ninety-six percent of our patients could not demonstrate correct use of their EAI and there were significant and serious gaps in their knowledge. This is likely to impair their ability to manage their life threatening condition successfully. We recommend developing anaphylaxis education programmes and action plans. This would involve education about anaphylaxis, allergen avoidance, signs, symptoms and management of anaphylaxis and practical training in the use of an EAI with the widely available training devices. There is also a role for internet based training applications to educate patient groups who do not actively interact with secondary care services. Background: Training and education is essential to provide patients the skills to manage their disease and improve outcomes. This education requires constant repetition and reinforcement. There is evidence that education is effective in improving the outcome in chronic disease. The ultimate goal is to reduce morbidity, improve functionality, and quality of life. Method: We programmed a training workshop on allergic diseases and invited parents, caregivers and children with conditions such as asthma, rhinitis and atopic dermatitis seen at Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez. Multiple choice questionnaire that consisted of 15 questions about allergic disease was performed, the questionnaire was applied to the main caregiver before and after the workshop. A year later, the same patients and relatives were invited to participate and they were answered the same questionnaire in order to assess whether the knowledge remained over time or if necessary repetition and continuous reinforcement is needed. Results: We performed the questionnaire to a total of 107 families (mothers, fathers and caregivers) of children with any allergic disease. 17.6% of parents reported that their child had a diagnosis of rhinitis, asthma 23.1, 0.9% 0.9% food allergy and atopic dermatitis 42.6% reported more than one of these diseases. The mean number of correct responses on the first questionnaire was 7.14 while in the postworkshop questionnaire was 10.6. Of the 107 tested parents 89 answered over 50% of post-training questions properly. During the first examination it was found that 15% of households had less than 26% of questions correct, while in the post-workshop questionnaire only one family had that many correct answers. The best results were found immediately after the training, 1 year after the questionnaires results revealed the need for strengthening the teaching techniques.

Early intramuscular (IM) administration can reduce the risk of hospitalisation and death in individuals at significant risk of anaphylaxis. The only adrenaline autoinjector available in Portugal is Anapen \u00e2 . The aim of this study was to evaluate Background: EAACI and WAO recommended in the last decade the adoption of a global nomenclature for allergy. Although allergy specialists embraced the proposed terminology, this is not yet adequately coded in the International Coding of Diseases, and moreover it is not properly presented in many lexicography resources, important tools not only for the preservation, but also for the development of languages. Method: In order to estimate the correct or erroneous aspects in the definition of allergy, different Romanian language dictionaries and lexicons were evaluated, and allergy was assessed for the revised definition as a hypersensitivity reaction initiated by immunological mechanisms. Results: The Romanian lexicographic assessment included four revised, enlarged editions of explanatory dictionaries, two dictionaries of neologisms, one of synonyms, an online explanatory dictionary database and medical dictionary. In all explanatory and neologisms dictionaries, allergy is defined as a modified reaction, not induced by an allergen or antigen, but erroneously induced only by microbes, mechanical or chemical agents. The term hypersensitivity is not included in the definition. The evaluated dictionary of synonyms, also wrongly considers that allergy is synonymous with anaphylaxis, rash and exanthema. In the medical dictionary, the new aspect of hypersensitivity reaction is mentioned in the definition, while in the online explanatory dictionary database, due to personal volunteer contribution, the correct non-lexicographic definition of allergy was added according to revised EAACI nomenclature. Conclusion: The term allergy is often misused by general public to describe any adverse reactions to different agents, and this may be due also to outdated definitions from different language dictionaries. In the educational process to increase awareness about allergy, the accurate definition of the medical term is essential, and involvement of lexicographers may be also important.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "730"}, {"text": "K\u00f6 se, S \u00df ; T\u20ac urken, M; G\u20ac ol Serin, B; Akkoc \u00dflu, G; Ersan, G Tepecik Education and Research Hospital, Izmir, Turkey Background: Allergic diseases are chronic disorders that have an increasingly elevating incidence in all communities and affect quality of life of the patients.

Of these patients 20% (n:30) were allergic rhinitis, 60% (n:90) were urticare and 20% (n:30) were asthma. 48% (n:72) patiens were female and mean age was 30. _ It is reported that in patients with allergic semptoms, the score of the physical activity scale was higher compared to the score of the emotional and fatigued scale. Conclusion: It was determined that feeling fatigued and exhausted due to allergic rhinitis did affect patients' quality of life (vitality) and they did not experience any problems concerning their physical functions. Objective: To evaluate the features of the patients consulted to our allergy clinic and to interpret about the effectiveness of these consultations. Methods: Patients referred to our clinic with written consultation form between November 2011 and October 2012 were included in the study. We are working in a chest diseases research and education hospital and the pulmonologists are referring patients to our clinic. In May 2013, four pulmonologist evaluated these written consultation notes. They commented on the intelligibility of the aim of consultation (question 1), the efficacy of the note written by allergy clinic (question 2) and whether the patients benefits from the consultation (question 3). They score these three points according to a ten point scale. Results: Two hundred and Ninety-two consultation forms were evaluated. Nearly half of the (49.7%) patients were consulted with a diagnosis, the other half was consulted for a symptom. The most consulted symptoms were skin lesions and lower respiratory system symptoms. The most consulted diagnosis were drug allergy and asthma. The most frequent final diagnosis were drug allergy and asthma. Allergic diseases were not considered as a diagnose in a significant portion of patients (15.4%). The pulmonologists gave full 10 point for question three in 65.4-84.6% of the patients. The mean score for question 1 was lower than other questions (8.44 AE 2.0 vs 9.47 AE 1.20 and 9.06 AE 1.98 P < 0.01 for both). On the basis of final diagnosis, drug allergy patients' consultations were found to have more appropriate response (9.77 AE 1.19 vs 9.19 AE 1.48 P < 0.01) and found to be more effective (9.50 AE 1.25 vs 8.50 AE 2.53 P < 0.01). Although the score for question1 were lower in asthma patients compared to other diagnosis, the score for appropriate response and efficacy were similar. Conclusion: Drug allergy and asthma patients were referred to an allergy clinic in a chest diseases hospital. The consultations were mostly found to be effective according to pulmonologists' justice.

Method: We asked seven to ninth students in five junior high schools about history of asthma diagnosis and treatment during the past year by ISAAC questionnaire, passive smoking avoidance behavior by three items of 4-choice multiple question, and numbers of smokers in household members. Results: Of 1992 students (85% of all students) who answered appropriately, 396 students had a history of asthma and 102 students had asthma treatment during the past year. There were not significant associations between the number of smokers in household members and history of asthma diagnosis and treatment. In the group who had not asthma diagnosis (n = 1596), the number of smokers in household members was significantly negatively associated with behaviors of avoiding tobacco smell, selecting smoke-free eating places and restaurants, and avoiding smoking people. In the group who had asthma diagnosis but had not treatment during the past year, all avoidance behaviors were similar in the students who have no household smokers (n = 139) and those who have one smoker (n = 101), and all behaviors in each group were significantly more appropriate than those who have two or more smokers (n = 54). In contrast, in the group who had asthma treatment during the past year, all avoidance behaviors were statistically the most appropriate in the students without household smokers (n = 48), and the behaviors in the students with one smoker (n = 36) and those with two or more smokers (n = 18) were similarly less appropriate. Conclusions: Passive smoking avoidance behaviors in junior high school students were dependent on the number of smokers in their household members but were different according to asthma control.

Here we performed a comprehensive time-course analysis of mutual relationships between development of asthmatic response following allergen challenge and changes in several CD4+ T-cell subsets. Method: We characterised CD4+ T-cell subsets as either releasing interleukin-10 (CD4+CD25\u00c0CD127\u00c0 and CD4+CD25+ CD127+ T-cells) or responding to IL-10 (CD4+ T-cell subsets expressing CD210). Patients that developed asthmatic reaction were described as responders (R) whereas the others were named nonresponders (NR). Results: In R, in contrast to NR, at 6 h we demonstrated significant expansion of CD4+CD25-CD127-T-cells which was followed by drop to baseline values at 24 h. In contrast, in R we observed decrease in numbers of CD4+CD25+CD127+ and CD4+CD25-CD127+ T-cells at 24 h. Interestingly, at baseline, despite comparable IL-10 levels, R presented with lower levels of all CD4+ T-cell subsets expressing CD210. In R, numbers of CD4+CD210+ T-cell subsets were further decreased following bronchial challenge which was paralleled by decrease in IL-10 serum levels. Conclusion: Altogether our data suggest that dynamic interactions between IL-10 producing and IL-10-responding CD4+ Tcells could contribute to pathogenesis of asthmatic responses in atopic individuals. Background: Helper T (Th) cells have been implicated in asthma. To investigate a role of Th cells in airflow limitation, T celltransfer model was analyzed for immediate and late phase asthmatic responses after antigen challenge. Method: Ovalbumin (OVA) specific Th clones were derived from either the regional lymphnodes of Balb/c mice immunised with OVA/CFA or splenocytes of DO11.10 transgenic mice expressing T cell receptor specific for OVA/H-2 d . Th clones were adoptively transferred into unprimed mice. After intranasal or inhalation challenge with OVA, airway resistance was continuously monitored by either unrestrained whole body plethysmography (BUXCO) or resistance/compliance analyzer under anesthetized condition. Bronchoalveolar lavage and analysis of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) were performed 48 h after OVA challenge. Supernatants of stimulated Th clones were analyzed for contractile activity using collagen gels embedded with murine primary bronchial smooth muscle cells (BSMCs). Results: When unprimed mice were transferred with Th clones, T5-1, T6-2, T6-4, and T6-7, Penh values were significantly increased 6 h after OVA challenge. In contrast, mice transferred with other Th clones, BF7, T6-1, or T6-10 did not show any change. Airflow limitation was confirmed by a direct measurement of airway resistance under anesthetized, restrained, and intubated conditions. The airflow limitation was also induced by the challenge with T cell epitope peptide, OVA 323-339 . Contractile activity of BSMCs was detectable in the supernatants of T6-2 stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3.

Results: In OVA-OVA mice, inflammatory cytokine levels, airway inflammation, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness were increased than in OVA-SAL mice. Lung CLDN5 transcript and protein using RT-PCR, immunohistochemical stain, and confocal microscopy were significantly changed in OVA-OVA mice than in OVA-SAL mice. The phosphorylation of FOXO1 and AKT were changed in OVA-OVA mice than in OVA-SAL mice. Conclusion: These results indicate that tight junction CLDN5 might be implicated in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma in part through regulation of FOXO1 and AKT, and may be a novel therapeutic approach for asthma. Background: Increased proliferation of airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells is a key feature of airway remodelling in asthma. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid and key regulator of cell trafficking, cell differentiation and immune responses. Increased concentrations of S1P have been detected in airways of asthmatic subjects and S1P has been shown to stimulate proliferation and contraction of human ASM cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of S1P in signalling and regulation of gene expression in ASM cells from healthy and asthmatic individuals. Method: Human ASM cells were grown from bronchial biopsies of healthy and asthmatic individuals. Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays, real-time PCR, and western blotting have been used to determine gene expression. Receptor signalling and function was determined by a range of selective agonists and antagonists, mRNA knockdown, and calcium mobilization assays. Results: S1P potently regulated the expression of more than 80 genes in human ASM cells including genes known to be involved in cell proliferation and airway remodelling. Intracellular calcium mobilization, extracellular signal-regulated and Rhoassociated kinases were required for S1P induced gene regulation. Three of the five known S1P receptors were expressed in human ASM cells at mRNA level; however, only S1P2 and S1P3 were required for S1P induced regulation of gene expression.

The IOS resistance and reactance parameters R5, R20, R5-20, X5 and X10 were measured at baseline and after the Mch challenge. Results: At baseline R5-20 did not differ between the groups. After the Mch challenge the change in R5-20 was significantly higher in children with severe EIB (2.51 fold increase) compared to children with moderate EIB (1.62) or no EIB (1.96, P = 0.036). No significant differences were found in changes of R20, X5 or X10.

Background: Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma. Elevated concentration of PAI-1 has been demonstrated in plasma and sputum of allergic asthma patients (APs). We evaluated in vitro the effect of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dp) allergens and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on secretion of PAI-1 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of APs. Method: PBMCs from 15 mild-moderate APs and eight healthy controls (HCs) were cultured with Dp (2500 SBE/ml), LPS (10 ng/ml), or without any stimulation for up to 144 h (T 144 ). Concentration of PAI-1 in cell culture supernatants was evaluated using ELISA. Results: At T 144 the mean concentration of PAI-1 in APs (0.873 AE 0.59 ng/ml) did not significantly differ than that in HCs (0.484 AE 0.21 ng/ml; P = 0.049). Stimulation with Dp resulted in increase of PAI-1 concentration in APs (4.74 AE 3.7 ng/ml; P = 0.0012), but not in HCs (1.2 AE 1.15 ng/ml; P = 0.21). No significant effect of LPS stimulation on PAI-1 secretion in APs (0.94 AE 0.64 ng/ml; P = 0.26) or HCs (0.631 AE 0.31 ng/ml; P = 0.2) could be demonstrated. No significant effect of Dp stimulation on PAI-1 secretion was seen at T 6 or T 24 . Conclusion: Stimulation of PBMCs with Dp results in delayed increase in PAI-1 secretion. The increased secretion of PAI-1 associated with exposure to Dp may be implicated in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma. Background: Several papers show an increase in FENO (fraction of exhaled nitric oxide) after BAC (bronchial allergen challenge) or after a natural allergen exposure. Our earlier studies indicated that 72 h after BAC FENO was still increasing. Recent results have shown that the elevation lasts at least 2 weeks. The aim of the study was to compare the effects of BAC with pollens and mites on FENO for a period of 2 weeks. Method: Studies were performed on a group of 30 allergic subjects with history of sensitisation to mites (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae) n = 15 or pollens (grass pollen or birch pollen) n = 15. Before the BAC Pulmonary Function Test and FENO measurement were performed, and blood samples for sIgE evaluation were taken. BAC was performed according to modified Ryan 0 s method using Koko Digidoser (PDS-USA) both as a spirometer and a dosimeter. The deVilbiss 646 jet nebuliser connected to the dosimeter was used for the allergens nebulization. Commercial allergen extracts (Allergopharma) were used to the challenge. Serial FENO evaluations (16 timepoints -1st daybaseline and 8 h, and later once daily since 2nd to 14th day after BAC) were performed using Niox Mino both in clinic and in home. Results: All subjects with evidenced sensitisation to allergen used to BAC demonstrated a singnificant increase in FENO (independently of bronchoconstriction observed in first hours after BAC in some of them) starting from the second day after BAC and lasting until the end of the study. Background: Long-acting b2-adrenoreceptor agonists (LABAs) are used as controllers for treating asthma. Human myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) play a critical role in the pathogenesis of asthma. However, the effects of LABAs on human myeloid DCs (mDCs) and the detailed mechanisms are unknown. Methods: Circulating mDCs were isolated from six healthy subjects. The effects of LABAs, formoterol and salmeterol, on cytokine production, maturation and T cell stimulatory function of human mDCs were investigated. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)a and interleukin (IL)-10 were measured by ELISA. The expression of costimulatory molecules were investigated by flow cytometry. T cell stimulatory function was investigated by measuring interferon (IFN)-c and IL-13 production by T cells cocultured with formoterol-treated mDCs. Intracellular signaling was investigated by Western blot. Results: Formoterol and salmeterol induced IL-10, but suppressed TNF-a production in polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C)-stimulated mDCs. This effect was reversed by the b2-adrenoreceptor agonists (ICI118551). Forskolin, an adenyl cyclase activator, conferred a similar effect. Formoterol and salmeterol suppressed poly I:C-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phospho-p38 and nuclear factor (NF)-jB-phospho-p65 expression. Formoterol and salmeterol inhibited maturation markers HLA-DR and CD80. Formoterol-treated mDCs inhibited IL-13 and IFN-c production by T cells. Conclusions: LABAs may induce tolerogenic function of human mDCs by enhancing IL-10, suppressing TNF-a, inhibiting maturation markers and suppressing T cell stimulatory ability. Background: Different indexes are used to define the positive response to exercise. The forced expiratory volume in 1-s (FEV1) is the most commonly used index of respiratory function in exercise challenge. Other parameters such as FEF 50 and PEFR are rarely used. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the response to exercise in children using different indexes of respiratory function (FEV1, FEF 50, and PEFR). Method: This study was performed at the Pediatric Allergy and Asthma Unit of Erciyes University in Kayseri, in Turkey. Children with asthma (n = 67) were included in this study. All children underwent a standart exercise challenge according to ATS guideline. A reduction in FEV1 of at least 10% of the preexercise value was considered positive. The values of spirometric FEV1, FEF 50, and PEFR were determined and compared. Results: Two groups of children were determined in the study: asthmatic children with positive (n = 46) and negative (n = 21) responses to exercise. The cut off values for the fall of FEF 50 and PEFR were found as \u226524.4%, and \u226515.6%, respectively. These values were correlated with FEV1 values (for FEF 50: r = 0.552, P = 0, for PEFR: r = 0.620, P = 0). In the exercise negative groups, the FEF 50 and PEFR values decreased more than the established cut off values in 4, and three patients, respectively. Conclusion: The criteria to define the normal airway response to exercise is not standard. FEF 50% and PEF % can decrease in response to exercise without changes in FEV1%.

Conclusion: Our study showed that EBC Annexin A5 had preventive role in EIB in asthma. Annexin A5 and related compounds could provide novel therapeutic approaches to the treatment of EIB in asthma. Keywords: Exhaled breath condansate, exercise induced bronchoconstriction, Annexin A5, asthma Background: Measurement of serum IgE to peanut components can be clinically helpful and more accurate than IgE to whole peanut to predict peanut allergy. Different sensitisation patterns to peanut components have been documented in European regions, and not all studies have used prospective samples, multiple components and oral challenges. Currently, there are no data on this topic involving Italian children. Our aim was to determine the utility of peanut component-resolved diagnostics performed before oral peanut challenge and possible differences in peanut components recognition patterns in a population of Italian children with suspected peanut allergy. Methods: Thirty-two patients [median age 9 years, IQR 6.0-11.0 years] with reported history for peanut allergy and evidence of peanut sensitisation (skin prick test to peanut extract \u22653 mm) had serum analyzed for IgE to whole peanut and the recombinant allergen components Ara h 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9 with ImmunoCAP, and completed an open oral food challenge to peanut. Results: 12 (37.5%) children reacted on peanut challenge and were considered allergic. No differences were seen when comparing median values of IgE to peanut, Ara h 1, 3, 8 and 9, between allergic and tolerant children to peanut challenge. Noteworthy, 5 of 20 tolerant children had IgE to peanut >15 kUA/l (median, 23.5 kUA/l; IQR: 17.05-33.2 kUA/l) which is commonly considered a predictive value of peanut allergy. Conversely, a significant statistical difference was seen when comparing the median value of IgE to Ara h 2 in the two groups: 0.75 kUA/l (IQR: 0.22-4.34 kUA/l) in allergic children vs 0.1 kUA/l (IQR: 0.1-0.12 kUA/l) in tolerant ones (P < 0.001). Conclusion: IgE levels to Ara h 2 are significantly higher in children that react on oral peanut challenge. Our findings in Italian children are in line with recent reports and add confirmatory evidence that analysis of IgE to Ara h 2 could reduce the need for peanut challenge in suspected allergic patients. Background: Conglutin isoforms Ara h 2 and Ara h 6 are considered the most relevant peanut allergens, because they are frequently recognised by patient's serum, and highly potent in IgE-binding. This may be explained by the fact that Ara h 2 and Ara h 6 are highly resistant to digestion. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of digestion on the structure and IgE-binding of the different conglutin isoforms. Method: Purified conglutin isoforms Ara h 2.02, Ara h 2.01, and Ara h 6 were digested with immobilized trypsin. Digestion resistant peptides were analysed by SDS PAGE, 2D PAGE, Far UV CD spectroscopy, and Mass Spectrometry for structural characterisations, and by 2D Western blot and competitive IgE inhibition ELISA for allergenic properties. Results: Prolonged digestion with trypsin resulted of all three isoforms in digestionresistance peptides (DRPs), with masses close to the masses of the undigested forms. DRPs were identified, and their association by disulphide bonds was characterised. The secondary structure of the DRPs compared to the native counterparts was not changed. All three sets of DRPs exhibited virtually the same IgE-binding potency as the native conglutins. Conclusion: Digestion of peanut allergens Ara h 2 and Ara h 6 result in digestion-resistant peptides that resemble structure and IgE-binding from the native allergens, even although the peptide backbone is cleaved. Background: Natural Ara h 8, a Bet v 1homologous peanut allergen involved in the cross-reaction with birch pollen, is a low abundance, unstable peanut protein that is difficult to purify. Our goal was to produce recombinant Ara h 8 in Pichia pastoris for use in molecular diagnosis of peanut allergy. Method: Recombinant Ara h 8.0101 and de-glycosylated rAra h 8 were expressed in Pichia pastoris. The glycosylation site was silenced by substituting asparagine at position 80 with glutamine (N80Q), thus disrupting the N-glycosylation motif in Ara h 8 cDNA. Recombinant Ara h 8 and N80Q enriched ammonium sulfate fractions were purified by anion exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration chromatography. Identity of Ara h 8 was confirmed by liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry. N80Q was compared to rAra h 8 and natural Bet v 1 by SDS-PAGE and IgE Ab ELISA. Results: Expression of rAra h 8 in Pichia resulted in a mixture of hyper-glycosylated (19 kD) and non-glycosylated forms (17 kD) of Ara h 8. SDS-PAGE showed a reduction of glycosylation from 19 kD to 17 kD in Pichia pastoris expressed N80Q. The natural Bet v 1 band also appeared at 17 kD. Preliminary data confirmed immunoreactivity of rAra h 8-N80Q in an IgE Ab ELISA assay using sera from birchpollen sensitised individuals. Conclusion: Disruption of the N-glycosylation motif in rAra h 8 removed the hyperglycosylated forms in Pichia pastoris expressed rAra h 8. De-glycosylated rAra h 8 will distinguish peanut-sensitised individuals at risk of severe symptoms from those likely to have milder symptoms as a result of primary sensitisation to homologous tree pollen. Thus, rAra h 8 represents a critical molecular diagnostic tool for risk assessment of severe reactions to peanut. Aim of the study: To evaluate the prevalence of genuine sensitisation, co-sensitisation and pan-allergenes sensitisation in North-East Italian population. Method: Two hundred and fourty-four consecutive pollen sensitised patients (mean age 33; range 4-82) afferred to our Unit between December 2011 and December 2013 were evaluated by ImmunoCap ISAC (Thermo Fisher-Uppsala, Sweeden). Results: Sensitisations to Grass pollen, Birch, Cupressus, Olea Europea, Plantago, Artemisia, Parietaria, Mercurialis and Salsola resulted 24%, 16%, 17%, 12%, 5%, 7%, 2%, 6%, and 4% respectively. The molecoular profile of IgE to Phleum pratensae (Phl p) in patients with grass pollen allergy was: Phl p 1 = 80.5%, Phl p 2 = 44.7%, Phl p 4 = 51.5%, Phl p 5 = 53.7%, Phl p 6 = 31.5%, Phl p 7 = 2.6%, Phl p 11 = 23.1% and Phl p 12 = 15.2%. Positivity to Cyn d 1 was 67.9%. The combination of Phl p 1, Phl p 4 e Cyn d 1 covered 94.2% of grass pollen allergic patients revealed by skin prick tests. Positivity to Bet v 1, Bet v 2 and Bet v 4 in birch sensitised patients was 91%, 27%, and 5% respectively and to Ole e 1, Ole e 7 and Ole e 9 in Olea sensitised patients was 90%, 9%, and 3% respectively. Association between Bet v 1, Ole e 1, Cup a 1, Art v 1 and Par j 2 with the major allergen Phl p 1 resulted 42%, 37%, 48%, 18% and 10% respectively. Seventy percent of profilin positive patients resulted primarily sensitised to Bet v 1 and 30% to Phl p molecules. Sixty-three percent of polcalcin positive patients resulted primarily sensitised to Bet v 1 and 37% to Phl p molecules. Conclusion: The most prevalent pollen sensitisation in North-East of Italy is grass pollen followed by Cupressus, Birch and Olea. We confirmed Phl p 1 as the major allergen of grass pollen and its prevalent association with Cupressus followed by Birch and Olea. We also ascertain that the main allergen source of polcalcin and profilin sensitisation is rapresented by Birch pollen. In the context of a multicentric study on pollen and vegetable food allergy in Spain, we analysed the prevalence of nut allergy in a sample of 433 allergic patients to pollen and/or vegetables and 90 controls.

The multivalent nature of antibodies and the heterogeneity of allergens and antibodies often hamper a detailed molecular dissection. Functional and structural analyses however demand the availability of allergen-specific antibodies in defined form, e.g. by the recombinant production of monovalent Fabs. Method: Single chain antibody fragments were converted to Fabs by fusion with human IgG1 CH1 and kCL. The Fabs then were produced by baculo-mediated infection of insect cells and purified by affinity chromatography. Functionality and affinity of resulting antibody fragments was shown by ELISA and SPR analyses. Results: Single chain formats with specificity for diverse antigens/allergens could be produced as assembled and secreted proteins in Sf9 insect cells with high yields. The proteins could be efficiently purified by different affinity chromatography approaches. Resulting allergen-specific Fabs showed pronounced reactivities in ELISA with their particular antigens. The affinities of the monovalent Fab antibodies could be assessed by SPR and compared to those of the full immunoglobulins. Conclusion: Recombinant production in insect cells is a suitable strategy for high yield production of allergen-specific Fabs and will facilitate downstream functional and structural analyses of the recognition of allergens by specific antibodies on a monovalent level. Background: Patients attending to an allergy office in Geneva, an international town situated in Central Europe, are of diverse ethnic origin. We aimed to analyze sensitisation profiles for panallergens PR10, profilin and LTPs, the profile of clinical food allergy in this population exposed at least to four pollens family groups. Methods: Seventy patients being consecutively included and investigated by Isac 112 over a 1 month period following clinical practice were described and classified in three groups: Western/Central/East Europe (30), South Europe (21), Asia/Africa/South America (19). Routine SPT panel, including SPT of LTP peach extract (ALK Abello), purified palm tree pollen profilin, ISAC-CAP 112 microarray and a careful clinical evaluation was performed. Results: 5/30, 3/21 and 7/19 were sensitised to LTPs, 13/30, 13/21 and 6/19 were sensitised to profilin while 14/30, 11/21 and 5/ 19 were sensitised to Betv1. 64.3% of LTP, 40% of profilin positive patients complain for food allergy, melon or water melon being the most prevalent. Profilin and LTP results on Isac were compared at different cut-off levels with SPT to pure profilin and SPT to peach extract. Isac without cut-off did not change the number of peach allergy diagnosis patient but allow to diagnose 36.4% more of melon allergy patients. Discussion: All studied groups showed a high prevalence of profilin, LTP and PR10 resulting in a high complex food related allergy. In Areas with a high pan-allergen sensitisation prevalence, the use of multiplexed platforms have become a routine diagnosis tool in our hands. LTP and profilin being present in all vegetables are not only ingested but inhaled through many pollens sources by this multi-ethnic community in a nearly annual daily basis, grass pollen sensitisation being predominant. Similar highly represented panallergens have been described in Spain making us think that this is not an isolated phenomenon and that exposure and cofactors conditions are very region dependent. Taking all this into account, this analysis confirms the absolute need for complex area for suitable use of SPT and micro-arrays technology in daily practice in order to be able to perform individually adapted successful treatments.

ISMA 2013, Vienna Background: Carbohydrate Cross-reactive Determinants (CCD 0 s) are glucidic epitopes, with significant structural homologies, prone to cause wide spectrum of cross-reactivity interactions between many different allergen protein families. This fact consist a confusing factor in in serumbased IgE assays. Objective: To study sensitisation profile to CCD 0 s, using component resolved diagnosis (CRD) technologies, in allergic patients from our geographic area. Methods: Three-hundred and twenty-six patients attended in Allergy Deparment (rhinitis and/or asthma and/or food allergy) with CRD test between 2012-2013, were included. Age ranged: 4-65 years. Component resolved diagnosis was performed by InmunoCAP-ISAC 112 (Ther-moFisher Scientific), LuxScan scanner (CapitalBio Corporation) and software (MIA v.3.1.2.) . Values \u2265 0.35 ISU were considered positive. We excluded Ole e 1 component due to its clinical relevance in our environment. Results: Twenty-four patients (7.3%) were positive to CCD 0 s. Twenty-three (95.8%) were positive to cypress Cup a 1. Twentytwo (91.6%) were positive to grass Phl p 4, nineteen (79.1%) to plane tree Pla a 2, eighteen (75%) to walnut Jug r 2, seventeen (70.8%) to Japanese cedar Cry j 1 and fifteen (62.5%) to bromelin MUXF3. Jug r 2 appears as only one allergenic component in 66% of positive patients to walnut while Pla a 2 is the single component in 42.1% of positive patients to plane tree and Phl p 4 in 31.8% o positives to grass pollen. Seventeen patients (70.83%) were positive to lipid transfer proteins (LTP 0 s) and all of them show the next pollen sensitisation profile: Cry j 1, Cup a 1, Pla a 2. Conclusion: The CCD-bearing allergen most frequently detected in our geographic area is Cup a 1. The main CCD-sensitisation marker is Jug r 2 instead of MUXF3.

Nowadays, component-resolved diagnosis is increasingly used for detection of sIgE Ab to specific allergen components. Method: A total of 307 adults referred to the allergy clinic with suspected inhalation allergy were questioned on symptoms and seasonal variation. Clinical history of GPA was considered positive if typical symptoms (rhinitis/conjunctivitis or asthma) were restricted to the grass pollen season, or worsened in May-July, especially upon pollen exposure. Skin prick tests (SPT) were performed and sera were collected from all patients. Specific IgE Ab to grass mixture (gx3) and grass components were detected by ImmunoCAP \u00e2 (Thermofisher-Phadia). Results: A clear GPA history was retained in 141 patients.

All five had sIgE Ab to nPhl p 4 > 0.10 kU/l (range 0.16-1.88 kU/l). Because of its 10-15% carbohydrate content, sIgE Ab to nPhl p 4 might be attributable to the presence of anti-carbohydrate cross-reactive determinants (CCD) IgE Ab, therefore its clinical relevance remains a matter of debate. However, only 1 out of 5 patients had sIgE Ab to CCD (0.66 kU/l). Conclusion: Combined detection of sIgE Ab to nPhl p4 and rPhl p 1,5 had a sensitivity of 100% in our patient population with suggestive GPA history. It might provide a valuable, more complete alternative for gx3 for diagnosis of GPA. With the discovery of component-resolved diagnosis we are now able to analyze the type of sensitisation of our patients. Method: Twenty-three subjects were recruited, after present a clinical picture suggestive of LTP allergy with specific IgE to numerous fruits and dry-fruits. All of them included in a commercially avaible microarray of 103 allergenic components. Results: Thirty percent of the patients reveal anaphylaxis and 8.5% of them were exercise dependent; however, none had non steroidal anti-inflammatory hypersensitivity. The average total serum IgE was 208 UI/l (range 28-421). The most frequent molecular LTP components were nJugr3 and rPru p3, both found in 82% tested subjects.

Background: Molecular detection of allergenic components provides a large amount of allergen specific IgE antibody information in a single step. This enables patient investigations that require less time and resources. We try to obtain allergens map of asthma and allergic rhinitis of China using ImmunoCAP ISAC, provide more comprehensive distribution information of allergic patients. Method: Fifty-seven patients, diagnosed with asthma and/or allergic rhinitis based on GINA or ARIA guidelines, were recruited. SIgEs to 112 allergen components in sera were detected by Immuno-CAP ISAC (Phadia). We analyze the distribution of allergen components in patients with respiratory allergic diseases. To validate the credibility of ISAC, Der pteronyssinus Der p 1 and Der p 2 sIgE randomly selected from 47 patients were detected with ImmunoCAP (Phadia),and timothy grass (g6) sIgE from seven patients were also detected. Results: Seventy-four percent patients were sensitised to 2-4 allergens or 4-6 allergenic components. Among the 57 subjects, 74% showed IgE-reactivity to Der farinae Der f 2, 68% to Der f 1; 67% were IgE positive against Der p 1 and Der p 2, then followed by cat Fel d 1 (25%), bermuda grass Cyn d 1 (19%), grass pollen (Phl p 4 (18%) \u3001 Pla a 2 (11%)) and walnut Jug r 2 (11%). There were 5 (9%) patients simultaneously positive to anisakis Ani s 3, cockroache Bla g 7, shrimp Pen m 1 and Der p 10. Serum IgE positive to other allergens was in general low. All the seven cases Phl p 4 sIgE-positive were positive to g6. The specificities of ISAC were 100% when compared with ImmunoCAP, and the sensitivities were 82.9% and 87.5% respectively of Der p 1 and Der p 2. Conclusion: Most patients with allergic respiratory diseases are multi-allergen sensitised. The most prevalent allergens in allergic patients are dust mites, followed by cat, bermuda grass, timothy grass, plane tree and walnut. Pollen allergens are often neglected in southern China, but the positive rates to these allergens are not low. We found high cross-reactivity between house dust mites, cockroaches, anisakis and shrimp due to the common allergen protein: tropomyosin.

Conclusion: These findings suggest that PI3K-d signaling influences Aspergillus fumigatus-induced allergic lung inflammation via the regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Background: House dust mites (HDM) are one of the commonest aeroallergens worldwide. With understanding the heterogeneity of asthmatic inflammation, the role of innate immunity has been highlighted in asthma pathogenesis. Specifically, NLRP3 is one of PRR systems activated by HDM extract in airway epithelial cells. However, there is little available information on the molecular mechanisms related to the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in this situation. Method: In this study, we have investigated the effects of IC87114, a representative inhibitor of PI3K-d isoform, on the HDM-induced airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. In addition, we tried to define the role of PI3K-d in the HDMinduced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in airways using primary cultured tracheal epithelial cells. Results: HDM-sensitised and -challenged mice showed the typical allergic airway inflammation and hyperresponsivenss, and the increased levels of Th2 cytokines, IL-17, IL-1b, and TNF-a in lungs. Moreover, we found the increases of mitochondrial ROS and the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in HDM-exposed lung. Very interestingly, the administration of IC87114 decreased the numbers of airway inflammatory cells in BAL fluids, the peribronchial and perivascular inflammation in lung tissues, the increase in the levels of inflammatory cytokines, the levels of mitochondrial ROS, NLRP3 activation, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness in HDM-sensitised and -challenged mice. Primary cultured tracheal epithelial cells from HDM-inhaled mice showed the increased expression of NLRP3 compared to the levels in cells from control mice. Pretreatment with IC87114 or transfection of siRNA for PI3K-d dramatically reduced the expression of NLRP3 protein in primary cultured tracheal epithelial cells from HDM-inhaled mice. Conclusion: These findings suggest that PI3K-d plays an important role in HDMinduced bronchial asthma through the regulation of NLRP3 activation mediated by mitochondrial ROS.

We compared the data of acetylcholine inhalation test to continued treatment group and no treatment group for more than a year. Subjects and method: We examined acetylcholine inhalation test by standard method, and the respiratory threshold of acetylcholine (RT-Ach) was compared to 153 cases of continued treatment (treatment group), and 95 cases of remission for more than a year (remission group). Therapeutic agents in the treatment group were mainly inhaled corticosteroid and leukotriene receptor antagonist. Results: The age of total cases were from 8 years to 21 years, and the mean age was 12.0 years. Mean age of treatment group was 11.4 years old, and remission group was 13.4 years old. Geometric mean of the RT-Ach in all cases was 2370 lg/ml, 1900 lg/ml in the treatment group, and 3700 lg/ml in the remission group. Significant difference was seen between two groups. Patients of 313 lg/ml or less were all in the treatment group. Geographic mean of serum IgE level was 456 IU/l in the treatment group, and 338 IU/l in the remission group. There was no significant difference. A case was treated by inhaled corticosteroid and leukotriene receptor antagonist. The RT-Ach was 313 lg/ml before treatment, and became to 10 000 lg/ml after 1 year. Then the treatment was quitted. Since then, the data of RT-Ach was maintained 10 000 to 20 000 lg/ml for 7 years without symptoms. Conclusion: The RT-Ach of remission group was improved to compare with treatment group. But serum IgE level was not decreased significantly. Airway hyperresponsiveness is one of the indicator of quitting treatment for asthmatic children. Background: Extended nitric oxide (NO) analysis such as alveolar NO has been studied ardently because it is not affected by exhaled flow rate. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether extended nitric oxide analysis parameters are correlated with bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and bronchodilator response (BDR). Method: A total 200 children with a typical asthmatic symptom was evaluated. The exhaled nitric oxide test was done with methacholine challenge test for BHR on the same day for 126 children and spirometry before and after bronchodilator for BDR on the same for the other 73 children. We measured exhaled nitric oxides at 30, 50, 100, 200 mL/s and calculated J'awNO (total NO flux from the airways), alveolar NO, NO transfer factor and airway wall NO (CawNO) using Hogman and Merilainen algorithm. Atopy was defined as a positive skin test result or a more than 0.7 KUa/l specific IgE or a more than 150 IU/ml total IgE. Results: Among 200 children, atopic subjects were 83. In atopic children, J'awNO were significantly higher in the positive BHR (PC 20 < 16 mg/ml) than in the negative BHR subjects (P = 0.02) and correlated negatively with PC 20 (r = \u00c00.408, P < 0.0001). In atopic children, J'awNO were significantly higher in the positive BDR (DFEV1 \u2265 12%) than in the negative BDR subjects (P = 0.006) and correlated positively with DFEV1 (r = 0.315, P = 0.016). In non-atopic children, CawNO were significantly higher in the positive BHR than in the negative BHR subjects (P = 0.012) and correlated negatively with PC 20 (r = \u00c00.382, P = 0.012). In non-atopic children, CawNO were significantly higher in the positive BDR than in the negative BDR subjects (P = 0.002) and correlated positively with DFEV1 (r = 0.744, P = 0.001). Conclusion: The relationship of extended nitric oxide analysis parameters with BHR and BDR was different according to atopy. The J'awNO in the atopy and the CawNO in the non-atopy might give the useful information for understanding BHR and BDR in children with asthma. Background: Atopic children have increased levels of nitric oxide (NO) in exhaled air, and exposure to allergens further enhances lung inflammation and exhaled NO. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the route of allergen exposure (i.e. inhaled or ingested) can influence the primary localisation of the airway inflammation (i.e. central or more peripheral) and this is reflected as increased bronchial NO flux (BrNO) or alveolar NO concentration (AlvNO), respectively. Method: We recruited 79 atopic children and adolescents but no doctor-diagnosed asthma. Exhaled NO was measured at multiple exhalation flow rates and BrNO (J aw NO) and AlvNO (C A NO) were calculated. Serum ECP, EPX, MPO, total-IgE and gliadin antibodies as well as specific IgEs to timothy and egg-white were measured. Healthy schoolchildren (n = 66) served as control group. Results: Bronchial NO flux (BrNO, P < 0.001) and alveolar NO concentration (AlvNO, P < 0.001) were higher in atopic children than in healthy controls. In atopy, both BrNO and AlvNO correlated positively (P \u2264 0.001) with eosinophilic markers EPX and ECP. Atopic children were divided into two groups according to the presence of 1) timothy spesific IgE (posit n = 68, negat n = 11); 2) egg-white spesific IgE (posit n = 31, negat n = 48); and 3) antigliadin IgG (posit n = 28, negat n = 51). Interestingly, BrNO was significantly higher in the timothy-RAST positive than negative patients (P = 0.023), while there was no difference in AlvNO. In contrast, AlvNO was significantly increased in the egg-white sensitised group as compared to egg-RAST negative patients (P = 0.031), but there was no difference in BrNO. No differences in BrNO or AlvNO were found in antigliadin IgG positive and negative patients.

Based on the presence/absence of the persistent nasal symptoms, nasal eosinophilia and HDM sensitisation, HDM AR-like phenotypes were defined as confirmed AR that fulfilled all three criteria and incomplete AR that had 2 of 3 criteria. Results: The level of IgE to food allergens decreased and both prevalence and levels of IgE to house dust mite (HDM), dog, cat, and pollens (especially, Japanese cedar pollen) drastically increased during the 2years period. Dog sensitisation among inhalant allergens was most prevalent at entry but was replaced by HDM during the follow up. The prevalence of confirmed AR increased from 2.8% at entry to 6.6% and 12.2% at 1 and 2 years follow-up, respectively. The proportion of children with incomplete AR also increased from 11.3% to 23.7% and 37.1%. Prevalence of physician-diagnosed asthma at 2 years was only 12%.

Methods: This study is part of a parent study registered with trial number IS-RCTN65195597. Infants at increased risk of atopy were randomly assigned, if parents within 1 month of birth decided to stop exclusive breastfeeding (BF), to receive partially hydrolyzed formula (pHF) containing a specific mixture (0.8 g/100 ml) of oligosaccharides including short chain galacto-oligosaccharides and long chain fructo-oligosaccharides (9:1), or standard cow's milk formula (control) for the first 6 months of life.

Results: Intake of pHF containing prebiotic oligosaccharides was associated with increased abundance of Bifidobacteria and decreased abundances of taxa within the Firmicutes. Furthermore, decreased stool pH, lower concentrations of propionate and butyrate and increased concentrations of lactate and acetate were observed. Overall the gut microbial composition and activity in infants receiving pHF was more similar to the BF reference group than to the control group.

Methylation of 49 of 308,000 CpG sites was associated with abundant fecal Proteobacteria based on ttests (P \u2264 5 9 10 \u00c04 ); significance was further confirmed using Mann-Whitney tests (all P values <0.03). Among the genes having differential methylation were NOTCH2 and ORMDL1. Notch2 has specific roles in differentiation and function of immune cells such as B cells and dendritic cells. OR-MDL1 belongs to the protein family includ-ing ORMDL3, the first asthma susceptibility gene found using GWAS. Conclusion: For the first time we show that differences in human gut microbiome are associated with differences in leukocyte DNA methylation and period prevalence of eczema.

Factors affecting the recovery of PFTs other than the severity of exacerbation are not well-known. The primary aim of the study was to determine the risk factors for recovery of PFTs >7 days after a moderate to severe asthma exacerbation in children. Method: Children who had moderate to severe asthma exacerbation performed serial pre-bronchodilator PFTs on day 1, 3, 7 of the exacerbation and then once weekly until their PFTs reached a plateau. All children received systemic corticosteroid for 3 days and inhaled salbutamol as long as they needed. Results: Fifty seven children were recruited. When all PFTs were considered, 42% and 74% of children recovered within 7 and 14 days, respectively. The last recovered PFT parameter was FEF 25-75 . Allergic rhinitis (AR) (P = 0.016), persistent AR (P = 0.005) and severe asthma exacerbation (P = 0.009) were significantly higher in children whose PFTs recover >7 days; only severe asthma exacerbation was different for recovery >14 days (P = 0.048). Logistic regression analysis revealed that AR and severe asthma exacerbation increases the recovery of PFTs >7 days by 4.3 (95% CI: 1.29-14.67) and 8.1 (95% CI: 1.51-44.43), respectively. Conclusion: Recovery of PFTs during a moderate/severe asthma exacerbation may prolong until 4 weeks. Apart from severity of the exacerbation, AR is a significant factor affecting the recovery time of PFTs therefore may impact asthma management. This issue reinforces the combined treatment of AR and asthma. Introduction: Ageing is associated with an impaired immune response to infections.

The patient suffering from cold contact urticaria did not show clinically relevant improvement after 3 months of treatment. Adverse events were reported in three patients (60%) and consisted of headache, fatigue, and short-term malaise. Conclusion: Omalizumab seems to induce and maintain remission in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria, treated with immunosuppressants. In one patient, prednisolone could be tapered off completely after treatment with omalizumab, and remission was remained. Omalizumab may be effective in treating chronic spontaneous urticaria when this is accompanied by angioedema or anaphylaxis. Background: Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (MRS) is considered a rare syndrom consisting of the triad of persistent or recurrent orofacial swelling, relapsing facial paralysis and plicated tongue. It generally presents in oligosymptomatic forms, so an accurate incidence of MRS is difficult to determine. Therefore, MRS may not be rare because it may often go undiagnosed. Case report: A 48 years old woman presented with 1 year history that started with swelling of the chin, right-side of the face and upper lip. In 2 days she recovered without any medication. After 2 weeks she had swelling of the right-side of the upper lip. The swelling of the upper lip apared again a week later. She was diagnosed with angioedema. In 2013 she presented in our clinic with swelling of the upper lip accompanied by incomplete paralysis of the right-side of the face and afissured tongue. No drugs, no history of trauma, infections, allergies or aphthous ulcerations. Ophthalmological examination, and of all other systems were normal.

In 1931, Curt Rosenthal, described three patients who had fissured or plicated tongues in addition to orofacial swelling and facial palsies and proposed a link between the triad of symptoms. The most common symptom of MRS is recurring orofacial swelling in which the upper lip is more often affected. The etiology and pathogenesis of lesions associated with MRS are unknown. Abnormal regulation of the autonomic nervous system leads to excessive permeability of the facial cutaneous vessels. Non specific antigens stimulate the perivascular cells to form granulomas that cause obstruction of perivascular vessels that is an causative factor in the swelling. Other theories are the viral component or allergies and autoimmunity. We present a case of the MRS with the classic triad of symptoms, eventually diagnosed with MRS after being misdiagnosed with refractory angioedema, and wellcontrolled with antileucotriene. Conclusion: MRS is a refractory angioedema that could be controlled with long term treatment of antileucotriene and short term treatment of corticosteroids.

MP29-02* is considered a new standard of care in AR. Background: Moderate-to-severe allergic rhinitis (AR) is poorly controlled. Patients remain symptomatic on treatment, even multiple therapies. A more effective treatment is needed. We assessed the efficacy of MP29-02* (a novel intranasal formulation of azelastine hydrochloride (AZE) and fluticasone propionate (FP) in an advanced delivery system) for symptomatic relief during different seasons and for different symptoms and severities vs AZE, FP or placebo (PLA). Method: Four thousand and twenty-two moderate/severe SAR patients (\u226512 years) were randomized into four double-blind, PLA-controlled, 14-day, parallel-group trials to MP29-02*, AZE, FP or PLA nasal sprays (one spray/nostril bid), during the Texas mountain cedar (MP4001), Spring (MP4002), Autumn (MP4004) and Spring/ Summer (MP4006) seasons. Overall change from baseline (CFB) in reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) was the primary endpoint. It was assessed by severity post-hoc (median baseline rTNSS >18.9: more severe; \u226418.9:less severe). CFB in individual nasal and ocular symptom scores was also assessed. Results: The response to MP29-02* was consistent across seasons; mean CFB \u00c05.5, -5.5, \u00c05.6 and \u00c05.6 in each study. Nasal symptom relief was sig. greater with MP29-02* than with FP or AZE in all studies. In study MP4001 the relative difference was 47% to FP (P = 0.0031) and 66% to AZE (P < 0.0001). For less severe patients the relative difference to MP29-02* was 42% vs FP (P = 0.0188) and 64% vs AZE (P = 0.0002), increasing to 49% and 70% vs FP (P = 0.0436) and AZE (P = 0.0035), respectively for more severe patients. Similar results were seen in the other studies. MP29-02* provided superior relief from all nasal and ocular symptoms than AZE or FP, which was particularly evident for congestion & ocular itching.

A meaningful and statistically significant improvement was noted in moderate-to-severe AR patients following 14 days of MP29-02* treatment. A response ceiling of \u226560% was identified above which INS failed to differentiate from placebo. This may explain why moderate to severe AR patients still complain of bothersome symptoms despite ARIA-guided treatment. Patients who remain symptomatic on monotherapy should experience a significant reduction in their symptoms with MP29-02*, exceeding that which they have experienced in the past, and many days faster than an INS. MP29-02* comprises all the pharmacological principles foreseen in the ARIA treatment algorithm. allergic diseases and asthma. The right human physiological amounts of Vitamin D, obtained by sun exposure, decrease with increasing of geographic latitude. In western countries, the lack of Vitamin D is widespread. There is increasing evidence that vitamin D regulates immune responses promoting the allergic diseases. Unlike the theory of the decrease in the prevalence of allergic diseases in a narrowing of latitude, the incidence of Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) decreases with increasing latitude. The VKC etiopathogenesis is still unclear, but there are many potential triggers: environmental (sunlight, hot and humid climate, latitude), hormonal (the frequency is higher in males and the disease heals with the pubery), immunological and genetic factors. The patients with VKC have an immuno-allergic response that leads to the formation of giant papillae commonly observed on the superior tarsal (tarsal VKC) or limbal conjunctiva, (Horner-Trantas dots: limbar VKC) or in both districts (mixed VKC). Because of the increase of VKC incidence in seasons with higher UV irradiation, we aim to evaluate the possible lack of vitamin D (25 OH Vitamin D) in children whose exposure to the sun is avoided by the worsening of eye symptoms in these environmental conditions. Method: To evaluate the serum vitamin D levels in children with VKC a study is made in Fatebenefratelli/Oftalmico and Melloni Hospitals in Milan. Serum vitamin D level between 20-30 ng/ml is consider a slight deficiency, while level <20 ng/ml is insufficient. Results: Sixty-six children with moderateto-severe VKC presented blood vitamin D levels at an average of 24.72 AE 12.74 ng/ ml, median 22.35 ng/ml. Only 22.72% of children with VKC (15 out of 66 children) had normal vitamin D levels (30 ng/ml). Twenty-six out of 66 children (39.4%) had severe deficiency of vitamin D (<20 ng/ml), by considering the need for dietary vitamin D supplementation, as has been seen in children with allergy. Conclusion: The VKC is therefore a disease with immuno-allergic pathogenesis, with different triggers, and the involvement of potential nutritional deficiencies similar to other chronic diseases. The VKC requires a multi-specialised monitoring for both an exhaustive search of the possible pathogenetic mechanisms and for an adequate diagnostic and therapeutic follow-up with a possible therapeutic supplementation of vitamin D. Background: Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS) is a non-invasive form of chronic sinus disease and is most frequently found in immunocompetent, atopic individuals who present with difficult to treat rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis. This disease is associated with an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction against fungal antigens. AFRS is thought to represent 5% to 10% of all cases of chronic rhinosinusitis although the incidence varies, depending on geographic areas. Methods and results: A 46-years-old man with a 2-years history of bilateral progressive nasal obstruction was sent to our outpatient clinic. The patient had allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma due to grass pollen, nasal polyps and a deviation of the nasal septum operation. He was working in a greenhouse. In the last 6 months he had a yellow mucopurulent nasal discharge and anosmia unresponsive to topic corticosteroid therapy. We performed skin prick tests (SPTs) for common allergens, spirometry, hemogram, total and specific IgE and computed tomography (CT) scan of nose and paranasal sinuses. Positive SPTs were obtained with Lolium, Olea, Cupressus, Plantago and Platanus pollen, house dust mite, cat and dog dander and Aspergillus. Pheripheral blood eosinophils were 300/mm3. Total serum IgE was 3150 kU/l. Specific IgE (kU/l) was lolium 33.7; Olea 36.3; Cupressus 0.66; Platanus 76.9; Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus 2.05; cat 2.81; dog 1.61 and Aspergillus >300. The spirometry values were normal. The CT images revealed nasal polyps in maxilar and sphenoid sinuses. Mucosal thickening with retained mucosal secretions involved most of paranasal sinuses with presence of microcalfications in the right maxillary sinus, which could indicate a fungus ball. Surgical endoscopic, Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery, operation was performed in such a way that the whole mentioned sinuses were opened and cleaned transnasally. Microbiological studies of the paranasal sinus content revealed a positive culture for Aspergillus fumigatus. After the surgical intervention the patient was treated with topical corticosteroids. With all these data the patient was diagnosed of AFRS. Conclusions: We present a case of AFRS due to Aspergillus fumigatus.

Recent studies have shown that treatment with macrolides may have a positive effect on asthma exacerbation through its antiinflammatory and anti-bacterial properties. Method: Thirty-nine subjects were randomised to a 3-week study period with either clarithromycin at 15 mg/kg/day, twice daily or placebo. Sputum specimen for PCR analysis, Asthma Control Test questionnaires and spirometry were done prior to medication. Repeat ACT and spirometry were obtained after the study period. Results: There were 13 patients found in the clarithromycin group and 10 patients in the placebo group with FEV1 < 80% before the treatment. In patients with predicted FEV1 less than 80%, three weeks of clarithromycin results in significant increase in FVC (19.09 AE 6.96, P = 0.021), FEV1 (22.85 AE 6.00, P = 0.006), FEV1/FVC (7.09 AE 2.89, P = 0.034), FEF25-75% (31.00 AE 9.88, P = 0.011) and PEFR (13.91 AE 4.81, P = 0.016). Patients in the placebo group also have significant increase in FEV1/FVC (6.7 AE 2.76, P = 0.038), FEF25-75% (11.6 AE 3.87, P = 0.015) and PEFR (11.1 AE 4.77, P = 0.045) but no increase in FVC (10.8 AE 6.1, P = 0.110) and FEV1 (12.10 AE 5.72, P = 0.180). There was a significant difference in the change in the degree of asthma control between the two groups favoring the clarithromycin group after the treatment period (P = 0.006). Only one (4.8%) of the subjects in the placebo group was positive for M. pneumoniae by PCR, while none tested positive in the active group. Conclusion: Clarithromycin when added to regular treatment was associated with a significant improvement in the FEV1 and significant increase in the asthma control test scores. Background: Asthma is a major cause of chronic morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Since 1999, this investigative team used an integrative care model to address pediatric asthma and associated health adversities. Specifically, this clinical health promotion effort was designed to address clinical, social, and psychological issues impacting asthmatic youth. Method: ioEasma has evolved from a clinical initiative to the health promotion using an integrated care model by a multidisciplinary team of health professionals. Initially (1999 Initially ( -2002 , the pulmonologist was responsible for all aspects of care, including the educational component. Subsequently (2003 Subsequently ( -2006 , a team of specialists were implemented to institute a diagnostictherapeutic-educational pathway (PDTE) consisting of three clinical visits in 8-week intervals. The PDTE was further enhanced (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) to include a 6-month followup visit and then (2012) to include four health promotion interventions to address physical activity, smoking, psychosocial challenges, and nutrition, as well as a 1 year follow-up visit. Results: From September 2007 to December 2012, under the PDTE framework, 1411 patients, ages 0-15, were evaluated. Adherence for the three clinical visits are listed, respectively: 74%, 81%, 88%, 85%, and 83%. Conclusion: 'ioEasma' demonstrates the importance of integrated care and how a clinical health promotion initiative can increase patient adherence. Additionally, positive effects on daily asthma management and overall health and wellness were reported among patients and their families. 743 A trial to establish the efficacy and safety of budesonide/formoterol 160/4.5 mcg from a novel dry-powder inhaler (DPI) versus budesonide/formoterol 200/6 mcg from a DPI in adult and adolescent patients with persistent asthma Background: Fixed-dose combination therapy with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting b 2 -agonist (LABA) provides benefit to patients with inadequate asthma control on an ICS alone. GINA and NIH guidelines recommend the addition of a LABA in patients with persistent asthma in whom low-to-medium doses of ICS alone fail to provide satisfactory control of symptoms. The ICS/LABA fixeddose combination budesonide/formoterol fumarate administered by a dry powder inhaler (DPI) (Turbohaler \u00e2 ) is approved for long-term, twice-daily maintenance therapy in the EU. Here we report the methodology of a randomised controlled trial where we matched the medium dose (200/6 mcg) Turbohaler with 160/4.5 mcg budesonide/formoterol fumarate administered by a novel inhalation-actuated DPI device (Spiromax \u00e2 ) to compare the efficacy and safety over 12 weeks' treatment. Methodology: Six hundred male and female patients aged \u226512 years with persistent asthma, in accordance with GINA, are planned to be enrolled onto this trial. Patients will be receiving short-acting b 2agonist and ICS (with or without LABA) for \u22658 weeks before screening and maintained on a stable dose of ICS for 4 weeks prior to screening. After a screening visit and a 2-week run-in period, patients will be randomised to a 12-week double-blind, double-dummy treatment period where they will receive either Spiromax (budesonide/formoterol 160/4.5 mcg) and a Turbohaler placebo, or to Turbohaler (budesonide/formoterol 200/6 mcg) and a Spiromax placebo. The primary endpoint is the change from baseline in weekly average of daily trough AM peak expiratory flow (PEF) rate over the 12-week treatment period. Secondary endpoints include: change from baseline in weekly average of Poster Session Group I -Blue TPS 22 -Mechanisms of asthma II 749 The coalescence of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria is involved in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma Background: Under stress conditions, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) loses the homeostasis in its functions, which is defined as ER stress. In fact, ER stress has been suggested to be involved in the inflammatory component of chronic diseases including bronchial asthma. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a molecular platform activated upon signs of cellular 'danger' to trigger innate immune defenses through the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1b. Moreover, association between NLRP3 and mitochondria comes from the observation that activated NLRP3 appears to traffic from the ER to perinuclear areas similarly to mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs) . Method: In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the allergen-induced cellular stress evokes the conformational association between ER and mitochondria in the airway inflammatory cells and which are involved in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma. Results: The mice sensitised with OVA and LPS and then challenged with OVA (OVA LPS -OVA mice) mice showed the typical features of neutrophilic asthma; increased airway inflammatory cells, the pathologic changes, the increased levels of Th2 cytokines in lungs of OVA LPS -OVA mice, increased the expression of ER stress markers and NLRP3, and increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Interestingly, confocal analysis and electron-microscopic findings revealed that in BAL cells from OVA LPS -OVA mice, the ER and mitochondria get closed each other even seemed to be united one compared to the finding of cells from control mice. 4-PBA, an ER stress regulator significantly reduced the increases in inflammatory cytokines, mitochondrial ROS generation, airway inflammation, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Conclusion: These findings indicate that the development of ER-mitochondria complex induced by ER stress in airway inflammatory cells may be implicated in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma, providing the novel therapeutic target for bronchial asthma. Background: In recent times, the use of protein-specific probes in the field of proteomics have undergone evolutionary changes leading to the discovery of new probing techniques. Protein-specific probes serve two main purposes; epitope mapping and in detection assays. One such technique is the use of phage display in the random selection of peptide mimotopes (mimtags) that can tag epitopes of proteins, replacing the use of monoclonal antibodies in detection systems. Method: In this study, phage display technology was used to screen a random peptide library with a biologically active purified human interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) to identify mimtag candidates that interacted with these proteins. Once identified, the mimtags were commercially synthesized, biotinylated and used for in vitro immunoassays. Results: We have used phage display to identify M13 phage clones that demonstrated specific binding to IL-4R and IL-13 cytokine. A consensus in binding sequences was observed and phage clones characterised had identical peptide sequence motifs. Only one was synthesized for use in further immunoassays, demonstrating significant binding to either IL-4R or IL-13. Conclusion: We have successfully shown the use of phage display to identify and characterise mimtags that specifically bind to their target epitope. Thus, this new method of probing proteins can be used in the future as a novel tool for immunoassay and detection technique, which is cheaper and more rapidly produced and therefore a better alternative to the use of monoclonal antibodies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2355, "end": 2370, "text": "Initially (1999", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2371, "end": 2388, "text": "Initially ( -2002", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2487, "end": 2505, "text": "Subsequently (2003", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2506, "end": 2526, "text": "Subsequently ( -2006", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2719, "end": 2725, "text": "(2007)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2726, "end": 2732, "text": "(2008)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2733, "end": 2739, "text": "(2009)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2740, "end": 2746, "text": "(2010)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2747, "end": 2753, "text": "(2011)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3466, "end": 3469, "text": "743", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5505, "end": 5508, "text": "749", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6279, "end": 6285, "text": "(MAMs)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "annex"}, {"text": "Utility of specific IgE to Ara h 2 in the distinction of allergic and tolerant children sensitised to peanut Background: Polysensitisation is becoming increasingly frequent worldwide. It is very common to identify patients with multiple sensitisations to different allergens in Spain. Co-exposure or cross-reactivity may be the main cause. In many cases, different pollen species pollinate at the same time, difficulting the establishment of a link between symptoms and exposure. The main objective of this study was to identify cross-reactivity patterns between different pollen species, including Artemisia vulgaris, Cupressus arizonica, Olea europaea, Parietaria judaica, Phleum pratense, Platanus hispanica and Salsola kali. Method: Sera of patients sensitised to these pollens were collected in different areas of Spain. The sera were analyzed by ELISA and pooled according to the content of specific IgE against the allergens to be studied. Allergen extracts were prepared following standardised procedures. The allergen composition of the extracts was analyzed by Mass spectrometry to verify the presence of unique and cross-reacting allergens. Cross-reactivity was analyzed by ELISA inhibition. Positive cross-reactivity (>10% inhibition) was classified into three categories, depending on the 50% inhibition values: low (10-30%), medium (30-60%), high (60-90%). Results: Low and medium cross-reactivity were observed between different pollens. All of the allergens showed cross-reactivity with P. hispanica and S. kali when these extracts were used in the solid phase. None of the pollen allergen extracts cross-reacted with P. judaica or C. arizonica when the extracts were used in the solid phase. Common major and minor allergens were identified by Mass spectrometry. Conclusion: Various degrees of cross-reactivity were detected among these different pollen extracts. The presence of common allergens was found in all of them. This knowledge is important because the composition of allergen immunotherapy may depend, to a great extent, on the degree of cross-reactivity of the allergen components. Assessment of the allergen composition in diagnostic and therapeutic mite allergen preparations Augustin, S; Pump, L; Reese, G; Kahlert, H; Klysner, S; Nandy, A Allergopharma GmbH & Co. KG, Reinbek, GermanyBackground: The quality of allergen products is a prerequisite for successful diagnosis and therapy of allergic diseases. However, commercially available pharmaceutical allergen preparations have been shown to vary significantly with respect to the presence of major and minor allergens. In the presented approach the allergen composition of diagnostic and therapeutic allergen products was extensively assessed by mass spectrometry (MS) using the mite species D. pteronyssinus and D. farinae as example.Methods: Skin-Prick-Test-solutions, production batches of allergen extracts used for allergoid production, and production batches of aluminium hydroxide-adsorbed extracts of both species (all Allergopharma) were investigated (three batches each). In parallel, current in house reference preparations (IHRPs) were analysed. The presence of major mite allergens was investigated by allergen-specific monoclonal antibodies. To determine the allergen composition comprehensively, samples were subjected to tryptic digestion and resulting peptides analysed by tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Results: The major mite allergens (group 1 and group 2 allergens) were detected in all samples of the respective species both, by monoclonal antibodies and by MS. In addition, MS analysis allowed identification of 13 and 12 additional allergen groups in the D. pteronyssinus and D. farinae allergen preparations, respectively. While Casset et al., 2012 were able to detect the 'intermediate' relevant allergens of group 5, 7, and 21 in only two of 13 commercial extracts, these allergens were identified by MS in all analysed Allergopharma extracts and products. Conclusion: The investigated diagnostic and therapeutic mite products were found to be comparable regarding allergen composition. In addition to the major allergens, they contain not only all 'intermediate' relevant allergens, but also the majority of minor allergens. These results underline the quality of the investigated allergen preparations. Background: Cashew nut allergy has been consistently linked to pistachio allergy; the extensive degree of both in vitro and in vivo cross-reactivity would allow to suggest a 'cashew/pistachio allergy syndrome' (CPAS). Conventional extract-based IgE testing is suboptimally diagnostic, as there is considerable overlap between allergic and tolerant patients with respect to sIgE levels, and no clear decision points. The objective of this study was to determine the added value of component-based testing in the diagnosis of CPAS. Method: Sera from 101 well characterised cashew-and/or pistachio-allergic children (m/f: 68/33, median age 8.1 years) were analyzed for IgE against cashew components Ana o 2 (11S globulin), Ana o 3 (2S albumin) and conventional extracts (f202, f203) by ImmunoCAP (Thermo Fisher, Uppsala, Sweden). Sera from 71 children (44 nut-allergic), with proven tolerance to cashew/pistachio were used as controls. Receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves and performance characteristics were calculated for each diagnostic method. Results: The Ana o 3 assay demonstrated the best diagnostic characteristics for both cashew and pistachio allergy, yielding the largest area under the ROC curve (AUC) (0.977 for cashew allergy and 0.982 for pistachio allergy). At the cut-off point of 0.35 kU/L, Ana o 3 ImmunoCAP demonstrated similar sensitivity as the cashew Im-munoCAP (94% vs 95%), but with greatly improved specificity (97% vs 63%) for the diagnosis of cashew allergy. The assay performed equally well when discriminating pistachio-allergic from pistachio-tolerant children, with a sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 96%, respectively. Conclusion: Detection of IgE against Ana o 3 by ImmunoCAP provides a highly accurate tool for the diagnosis of cashew/ pistachio allergy syndrome in children, adding greatly enhanced specificity over conventional extract-based testing. Background: Weed pollen from Asteraceae are an important source of allergenic molecules. In particular pollen of ragweed and mugwort are prominent culprits of late summer pollinosis. Their two major allergens, Amb a 1 and Art v 6, respectively, were identified as pectate lyase enzymes. Further allergenic pectate lyases have been found in the pollen of Cupressaceae species whereas the most important representatives are Mountain cedar Jun a 1, Arizona cypress Cup a 1, Mediterranean cypress Cup s 1, and Japanese cedar Cry j 1. Methods: To investigate the sensitisation pattern, patients' sera from four distinct geographical areas (Austria, Canada, Italy and Japan) were tested by direct and inhibition ELISA with the clinically most relevant pectate lyase allergens Amb a 1, Art v 6, Cup a 1, Jun a 1, and Cry j 1. To determine the sensitising capacity of allergenic pectate lyases mice were immunised with the respective allergens and the humoral as well as cellular immune responses were determined. Results: We were able to identify specific sensitisation pattern for investigated geographic region by inhibition ELISA reflecting the natural allergen exposure. For all cohorts direct ELISA experiments revealed a high degree of IgE cross-reactivity of different pectate lyase allergens within the Asteraceae and Cupressaceae families, but only limited cross-reactions between the two families. At the B cell level, analyses of mouse sera showed a similar picture, whereas cross-reactivity at the T-cell level was in general limited. Moreover, our in vivo model elucidated different allergenic potencies of pectate lyase allergens. Conclusion: Amb a 1 and Cry j 1 were identified as the most potent allergic sensitisers of the Asteraceae and Cupressaceae families in different patient cohorts and also showed the highest allergenicity in a mouse model. Thus, our findings will allow a refined selection of candidate molecules for the diagnosis and therapy of pectate lyase allergy.Background: Egg allergy is one of the most common IgE mediated food allergies. Oral food challenges using fresh egg are common; however to limit the risk of food borne infection many allergy units use pasteurised raw egg. The five major egg allergens include: ovomucoid, ovalbumin, ovotransferrin, lysozyme, and the egg yolk protein chicken serum albumin. Pasteurisation and drying processes have the potential to affect the structure of egg proteins in egg powder and thus the allergenicity when compared to fresh egg. The aim of this study was to compare the binding of serum IgE from egg allergic children to in vitro digested and undigested pasteurised whole raw egg powder as well as fresh whole raw egg. Methods: Pooled Sera: Serum was collected from five egg allergic children (2.6 to 3.9 year) and pooled. Protein Separation and Western blot: Egg proteins from in vitro digested or undigested pasteurised whole raw egg powder, fresh whole egg, white and yolk were separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto a 0.2 lm pore nitrocellulose membrane, stained and incubated overnight with the pooled sera. Results: Protein bands corresponding with known molecular weights of the major egg allergens were present for both raw egg samples and the pasteurised whole egg powder. After in vitro digestion bands at 250 kD and 120 kD molecular weight were no longer detected. Serum IgE bound to the pasteurised whole raw egg in a similar manner to fresh whole raw egg. In vitro digestion did not result in a loss of IgE binding. Importantly undigested and in vitro digested egg yolk also bound serum IgE, indicating sensitisation to both egg yolk and egg white proteins. Conclusion: Results from our study indicate that the main egg allergens are still present in pasteurised whole raw egg powder and bind serum IgE of egg allergic children in a similar pattern to fresh whole raw egg, making it a suitable substitute for raw egg in clinical practice for oral food challenges.Background: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-d signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome activation play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory processes. However, there is no information about their association in allergic inflammation. In this study, we focused on an association of NLRP3 inflammasome activation with PI3K-d signaling in Aspergillus fumigatus-induced allergic lung inflammation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "762"}, {"text": "Aspergillus fumigatusexposed in vivo and in vitro experimental systems, we have investigated the role of PI3K-d in the regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the pathogenesis of fungus-induced allergic lung inflammation. Results: The protein expression of NLRP3, caspase-1, and IL-1b in lungs was significantly increased after Aspergillus fumigatus challenge in Aspergillus fumigatussensitised and -challenged mice. Protein expression of NLRP3 and caspase-1 was also remarkably elevated in Aspergillus fumigatus-stimulated cultured tracheal epithelial cells. But, administration of PI3K-d inhibitor significantly reduced the increases of the protein levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, Molecular profile in house dust mite allergic rhinitis in the patients from the north area of Gran Canaria Background: House dust mite allergy is the most common cause of rhinitis and asthma in our population. As usual, skin prick testing (SPT) and/or specific serum IgE determination confirms the diagnosis of allergy. Currently, the molecular diagnosis has been proposed as alternatives to identify patterns of sensitisation to specific allergenic components. This allows us to be more accurate in the allergy diagnosis. Objective: Describe the profile of sensitisation to major allergens of dust mites in patients with rhinitis. Method: Descriptive study of the sensitisation profile in 36 patients with allergic rhinitis. All of them have positive SPT to house dust mites, IgE specific (IgEs) and immunoassay for molecular allergen components to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p1, Der p2), Dermatophagoides farinae (Der f1, Der f2), B. tropicalis (Blo t 5) and L. destructor (Lep d2) Results: Of the 36 patients studied, the 58.3% were women; with a median age of 31 years (range: 5-59) and median 324 kIU/l total IgE. SPT revealed the fol- Background: Vitamin D and Vitamin D receptor have been associated with several immunoregulated diseases like asthma and other allergic diseases suggesting that those molecules as immunomodulatory of this type of inflammation. SNPs FokI, BsmI, ApaI and TaqI in the Vitamin D Receptor gene (VDR) have been associated with asthma, asthma severity and high levels of IgE. Allergic rhinitis is a high prevalence disease in Colombia and could be associated with VDR polymorphisms. Method: A case control study, 208 adults (105 cases and 103 controls) from a Caribbean coast department in Colombia were genotyped by RT-PCR with probes for the SNPs FokI, BsmI, ApaI and TaqI. The diagnostic of allergic rhinitis was assessed by using nasal provocation test. Total and specific IgE to B. tropicalis and D. pteronyssinus were determined through Immu-noCAP. And ELISA kit was used to measure sera level of vitamin D. All individuals consented before participate. Results: FokI was the only SNP that was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P = 0.54). The allele C for ApaI was not found in homocigotic form. TaqI and BsmI were heterocigotic in all population. There was not association between FokI and allergic rhinitis, but there was a risk association with higher levels of specific IgE to D. pteronyssinus for allele A in a dominant model, even after correction for confusion variables (OR: 2.52, IC: 1.1-5.8, P = 0.03). Conclusion: There is no association between allergic rhinitis and four polymorphisms in VDR evaluated in this study, but FokI is associated with higher sensitisation to D. pteronyssinus. This relationship suggests functional and clinical implications in allergic diseases. Background: The incidence of sensitisation to pet's allergens in allergic patients in Russian Federation is high. There no data about revealing IgE-aB to the pet's allergen components in Russia.The aimto investigate frequency of IgE-aB to pet allergen's components in patients with bronchial asthma. Method: The study was conducted 29 patients (pts) living in Moscow and St. Petersburg. They all suffered from moderate (18) to mild (11) bronchial asthma. The pts were aged from 10 to 43 years old, gender distribution was equal. Specific IgE-aB to cat, dog, mouse and horse allergen components were determined by means Immu-noCAP ISAC \u00e2 (ThermoFisher Scientific, Sweden). Results: The occurrence of IgE-aB to major cat allergen uteroglobin (rFel d 1) were positive in 93.1% of cases (27/29). The frequency of IgE-aB to other cat allergen's components were significantly lower: to nFel d 2 -17.2% (5/29), to rFel d 4 -13.8% (4/29). The positive levels of IgE-aB to all cat allergens (rFel d 1, nFel d 2, rFel d 4) was found only in 6.9% (2/29) of cases. Some pts (34.48%; 10/29) had both IgE-aB to rFel d 1 and rCan f 1. Specific IgE-aB to rFel d 1 and nMus m 1 were measured in 10.34% (3/29) pts, and to horse allergen (nEqu c 3)in 13.8% of cases (4/29). The positive levels to major dog allergen (rCan f 1) were detected in 37.93% of pts (11/29). Specific IgE-aB to other dog allergens (rCan f 2, nCan f 3, rCan f 5) were detected in 17.24% of pts (5/29) . Positive levels of IgE-aB to lipocalins were occurred in 41.38% (12/29) of pts; to serum albuminsin 24.14% (7/29).

Clinical severity is variable, and may change over time. The aim of our study was to describe the sensitisation frequencies to molecular allergens and to look for possible correlations between sensitisation and severity in a group of allergic children. Background: This study aimed to investigate new trend of asthma at the end of the preschool period in cildren in Novosibirsk and to research impact of concomitant allergic diseases from asthma persistience. Method: According to the ISAAC Phase Three by written questionnaire 3251 parents of children aged 6-7 years were examined in 2002 and 3270 parents in 2011-12 years. Compared groups were matched for age and sex of children.Results: There is some decreased prevalence of wheezing lifetime from 24.0% to 18.2% (P < 0.0001), the prevalence of current asthma symptoms is from 10.8% to 6.7% (P < 0.0001). The prevalence of asthma symptoms associated with the physical exercise was not significantly changed (3.5% in 2002 and 3.0% in 2011-12, P > 0.05). The diagnose of asthma was made in 2.5% of children in 2002. In 2011-12 this percentage increased up to 4.2% (P < 0.0001). It was performed the analysis of impact of concomitant allergic diseases from asthma persistience in 2011-12 years. Exacerbations, nocturnal asthma symptoms and symptoms limiting speech were more frequent in children with signs of allergic rhinitis in comparison with children with asthma symptoms only. From children with symptoms of allergic rhinitis: 4-12 exacerbations in the past 12 months OR = 5.16 (CI = 2.53-10.53; P < 0.0001), more than 12 exacerbations in the past 12 months OR = 6.29 (CI = 1.77-22.34; P < 0.01), nocturnal asthma symptoms less than one night per week OR = 3.42 (CI = 2.12-5.53; P < 0.0001), nocturnal asthma symptoms at least one night per week OR = 7.96 (CI = 3.36-18.86; P < 0.0001), symptoms limiting speech OR = 8.46 (CI = 3.16-22.62; P < 0.0001). Respectively in children with only asthma symptoms: OR = 0.12 (CI = 0.05-0.27; P < 0.0001), OR = 0.10 (CI = 0.02-0.47; P < 0.0001), OR = 0.19 (CI = 0.11-0.31; P < 0.0001), OR = 0.11 (CI = 0.04-0.30; P < 0.0001), OR = 0.11 (CI = 0.04-0.35; P < 0.0001).Conclusion: During last 10 years a new trend has been registered at the end of the preschool period: significant decrease of the prevalence of symptoms with some improvement in the asthma diagnostics. Allergic rhinitis is one of the most important factors of the asthma persistence. Background: Maternal obesity has been linked to offspring asthma, however the relation to other allergy-related diseases, as well as the effect beyond early school-age are largely unstudied. The aim of the study was to examine the associations between maternal BMI in pregnancy and offspring asthma, rhinitis, eczema and sensitisation up to 16 years of age. Method: Three thousand and ninty-four children from the Swedish birth cohort BAMSE were included in the analyses. Maternal BMI was assessed around week 10 in pregnancy. Information on asthma, rhinitis, eczema, lifestyle factors and environmental exposures were obtained by parental questionnaires at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 years. Sensitisation was defined from IgE levels of inhalant allergens at 4, 8 and 16 years in a subsample of 2850 children. Generalised estimated equation models were used to analyze the associations between maternal BMI and the outcomes at 1-16 years. Results: Maternal BMI was positively associated with overall risk of asthma up to age 16 years (adj OR per 5 kg/m 2 increase: 1.23; 95% CI 1.08-1.40 for prevalent asthma). In contrast, no significant associations were found for rhinitis, eczema or sensitisation. The effect of maternal BMI was restricted to obese, rather than overweight mothers. A causal inference test indicated that the child's own overweight was partly mediating the association between maternal BMI and offspring asthma. Conclusion: Maternal BMI is associated with an increased risk of asthma, but not rhinitis, eczema or sensitisation. This might indicate that the mechanisms are mediated through pathways specific for asthmatic disease. Background: Differences are seen between the impact of different atopic conditions on generic health-related quality of life (HRQOL). However data on the feasibility of the RAND general health rating index (RAND) in atopic children are lacking. In this study we investigate the validity of the RAND and evaluate the impact of allergic and respiratory conditions on the RAND score. Methods: In this cross-section study, data from 1309 Dutch children visiting outpatient clinics and participating in the Electronic Portal for children with respiratory and allergic symptoms were used. The impact of atopic conditions and recurrent infections in the last 12 months on the RAND score was assessed by multivariate linear regression analysis with adjustment for confounders. Validity of the RAND was evaluated by investigating internal consistency, floor and ceiling effects and discriminant validity. Results: Asthma was reported in 538 (41%), eczema in 548 (42%), allergic rhinitis in 429 (33%), food allergy in (49%) and recurrent respiratory infections in 495 (38%) children. Internal consistency of the RAND questionnaire was good in all subgroups (Cronbach's a range 0.84-0.87).Background: Prevention guidelines for infants at high risk for allergy, who are not breastfed, recommend use of hydrolyzed formula in the first 4-6 months, but evidence for efficacy is limited and conflicting. Specific mixtures of oligosaccharides may offer an additional strategy for allergy prevention. Objective: To determine the hypo-antigenic and immunological effects of early intervention with a partially hydrolyzed whey formula (pHF) containing oligosaccharides in infants with increased risk of allergic disease. Method: Infants at increased risk of allergic disease were randomly assigned to receive pHF supplemented with a specific mixture (0.8 g/100 ml) of oligosaccharides including short chain galacto-oligosaccharides and long chain fructo-oligosaccharides (9:1), or standard cow's milk formula for the first 6 months of life if parents decided to stop or supplement breastfeeding (n = 1047) (trial registration number: ISRCTN65195597). Serum (n = 562) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (n = 85) were obtained from a subgroup of infants at 6 months. Allergen-specific immunoglobulins were measured by CAP FEIA. Regulatory T cell (Treg) and plasmatocytoid dendritic cell (pDC) populations were analyzed by flow cytometry, and cytokine responses by multiplex assay. Results: pHF supplemented with prebiotic oligosaccharides intake was associated with reduced serum cow's milk-specific IgG1 (P < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney test) and increased percentages of Treg (P = 0.0176, Two-Sample T-test) and pDC (P = 0.0251, Two-Sample T-test) as compared to conventional formula. Cytokine responses were similar in both groups. Conclusion: These findings support the hypo-antigenic and immune-modulatory capacity of this pHF containing prebiotic oligosaccharides and demonstrate a capacity to influence regulatory immune parameters that may contribute to anti-allergic effects in later life.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "789"}, {"text": "Sensitisation patterns to common allergens in young Korean children 6 years of age or younger presenting with typical symptoms of allergic diseases: a single center study Background: Population studies have reported that sensitisation to inhalant allergens is rare in young children; however, most subjects in these studies have had little or no symptoms suggestive of allergic diseases. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence of sensitisation to inhalant allergens in young children 0 to 6 years of age presenting with symptoms of allergic disease. Method: We analyzed results of all specific immunoglobulin (IgE) tests performed at our hospital laboratory in children 6 years of age or younger presenting with symptoms suggestive of allergic diseases between 2008 and 2013. Specific IgE tests to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae, Alternaria alternata, German cockroach, cat dander, egg white, egg yolk, milk, peanut, wheat and soybean were performed in 279 children; a specific IgE concentration \u2265 0.2 kU/l was considered positive. Results: Overall, 232 (83.2%) tests were positive to at least one allergen and 132 (50.0%) tests were positive to at least one inhalant allergen. The prevalence of sensitisation to inhalant allergens increased with age (P = 0.006). In addition, there was no difference in the incidence of polysensitisation among different age groups. Conclusion: Our results suggest that specific IgE tests to common inhalant allergens, especially the house dust mite, should be added when performing blood screening tests for young children presenting with symptoms of allergic diseases. Background: Clinical studies of cough variant asthma (CVA) or nonasthmatic eosinophilc bronchitis (NAEB) rarely report any symptom as an important clue. The aim of this study was to investigate whether history of wheezing is useful in the prediction of CVA or NAEB among chronic cough patients. Method: Patients with cough more than 8 weeks were prospectively enrolled. They were divided into two groups according to the presence of wheezing history. Results of methacholine bronchial challenge and induced sputum examination were compared between two groups. Results: Four hundred sixty chronic cough patients (295 men and 165 women) were analyzed. Their mean age was 47.4 years and the median duration of cough was 13.5 months. Patients who experienced wheezing ever were 164 (35.6%). The prevalence of CVA (36.4% vs 5.8%, P < 0.01) and NAEB (15.4% vs 4.4%, P < 0.01)) were significantly higher in wheezing group compared to non-wheezing group.

Depending on academic achievements, which were categorized into high, middle, and low, cross analysis was performed. The correlation between the rating of students' quality of life and the percentile of their academic achievements were analyzed. Results: There was no significant difference between the allergic rhinitis group and the normal group in terms of total score, sum of math and science, and English; however, high school rhinitis students who had received treatments over the last 12 months had significantly high Korean language scores. Female rhinitis students showed the highest prevalence, especially those who scored high on Korean language. In addition, high school students who had been given treatment over the past 12 months showed a significantly high prevalence, especially those with high Korean language scores. There are significant positive correlations between quality of life represented by physical fitness index and the percentiles for the following subjects: math and science.Conclusion: This result contradicts the other research results that support the correlation between allergic rhinitis and low academic achievement. However, considering other research results on how one's academic achievement can represent social status, it is possible to conclude that allergic rhinitis is seen more often among people with high social status. Background: Asthma is a frequent chronic disease with considerable impact on children and their parents' quality of life. Environmental factors may act as triggers of acute exacerbations and as worsening factors of the disease. Our aim was to evaluate which triggering/worsening factors (TWF) were spontaneously identified by a population of asthmatic children. Method: The following data were retrospectively collected from the pediatric patients (aged 18 or less), with a diagnosis of asthma, who had their first appointment in our department during 2013: gender, age, sensitisation profile for aeroallergens and TWF spontaneously identified. Results: We studied 81 patients, 57% (n = 46) of which were males. Median age was 10 years (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . Approximately 84% (n = 68) of patients underwent skin prick tests that were positive in 85% (n = 58) of them. The most prevalent allergens found were house dust mites (59%, n = 48), cat and/or dog epithelium (23%, n = 19), grasses (26%, n = 21), weeds (11%, n = 9), trees (9%, n = 7) and fungis (1%, n = 1). About 75% (n = 61) of patients identified a TWF for their symptoms, which were: house dust (72%, n = 58), exercise (37%, n = 30), infections (31%, n = 25), temperature changes (21%, n = 17), pets (14%, n = 11), pollen (11%, n = 9), cold (9%, n = 7), intense odors (4%, n = 3) and air conditioning (1%, n = 1). The TWF identified related to the patients' profile sensitisation in 30% (n = 24) of the cases. Ages between 14 and 18 years were associated with a positive relationship between the TWF identified by patients and their sensitisation profile (P = 0.03). Conclusion: The most prevalent allergens found were house dust mites, which is in agreement with previous reports in the literature. The majority of patients identified a TWF for their symptoms and house dust was the most common one. Adolescents of Introduction: Delivery by caesarean section has been associated with increased risk of immune-mediated diseases in children suggesting early bacterial colonisation as an important environmental factor responsible for immune maturation. In this study, we describe the long-term microbial colonisation patterns of the gut and the airways in children of the Copenhagen Prospective Study on Asthma in Childhood (COP-SAC 2010 ) birth cohort. Methods: Seven-hundred children from the novel unselected COPSAC 2010 birth cohort participated in this analysis. Faecal samples were collected at age 1 week, 1 month and 1 year. Hypopharyngeal aspirates were collected at age 1 week, 1 month and 3 months. Samples were cultured for bacteria. Detailed information on delivery method and intrapartum antibiotics, social, and lifestyle-factors was obtained by personal interviews. Results: In the COPSAC 2010 birth cohort of 700 children, 78% were born by vaginal delivery, 12% by emergency and 9% by elective caesarean section. All mothers giving birth by caesarean section received intrapartum antibiotics, whereas only 13% of the mothers giving birth vaginally were treated. Birth by caesarean section was significantly associated with increased colonisation by Citrobacter freundii, Clostridium, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus at age 1 week, whereas only colonisation by Escherichia coli were strongly correlated to vaginal birth. Multivariate data-driven PLS analyses confirmed the affected faecal composition at 1 week and 1 month, while no differences were found at 1 year of age. Hypopharyngeal samples were not significantly affected by birth method. Conclusion: Delivery by caesarean section was associated with affected colonisation patterns of the neonatal gut but not of the airways. Colonisation patterns normalise within the first year of life. These microbial derangements may demonstrate a possible link between delivery by caesarean section and immune-mediated disease.Background: The human neonatal microbiome is believed to influence immune maturation and disease development, including the risk of childhood asthma and pneumonia. Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common infections in early childhood. The aim of this study is to describe the airway microbiota in neonates and associations with AOM in early childhood. Method: We studied the Copenhagen Prospective Study on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC 2010 ) prospective birth cohort following 700 unselected Danish children. Bacterial cultures of hypopharyngeal suction samples obtained at 1 week, 1 month and 3 months of age were categorized at species level. AOM symptoms were registered from birth to 2 years of age by the parents in a structured daily diary. Colonisation with known AOM pathogens was compared to diary entries of AOM. Results: One hundred twenty-three different bacterial species were identified in the cultures. Children colonised with Streptococcus pneumoniae at 1 month had an increased risk of developing AOM in the first 2 years of life Background: Patients' preference towards a particular health state, reported as utilities, is one of the measures to understand impact of differential severity of a disease on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). EQ5D is a generic instrument comprising five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/ depression. This allows the creation of descriptive patient profiles. A preference value, called utility, is also calculated for each profile or health state, allowing comparisons across various diseases in economic evaluations. Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) has detrimental effects on patients' HRQoL. It is important to understand the preference that patients place on specific health states in CSU. Objective: To estimate the utilities associated with health states in CSU. Method: Pooled patient level data from three randomised trials evaluating effect of omalizumab on symptoms of refractory CSU were used to derive utilities. Patients assessed their health state using EQ5D and also completed a daily diary (urticaria activity score-UAS) for their itch and number of hives to assess disease activity. Weekly UAS scores (UAS7) are calculated ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 42 (maximum symptoms). Health states were defined using intervals of UAS7 scores as follows: severe urticaria:28-42; moderate urticaria:16-27; mild urticaria:7-15; well-controlled urticaria:1-6; and urticaria-free:0. Background: The Urticaria Activity Score (UAS) is a patient-reported urticaria measure that captures intensity of pruritus (0: none to 3:severe) and average number of hives (0:none to 3:>12 hives). Daily pruritus and hives ratings are summed to create a daily UAS score which is summed over a week to create the UAS7 (0-42). It is not yet known if disease states, defined by UAS7 score ranges, are clinically informative of disease impact and response to treatment. Objective: To evaluate categorical UAS7 scores and compare with the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) to identify and initially validate CSU health states. Method: Pooled patient-level data from three randomised trials evaluating effects of omalizumab on symptoms of refractory CSU were used (baseline and week 12 data). Patients completed the UAS and DLQI. UAS7 score-based health states were defined as follows: severe urticaria:28-42; moderate urticaria:16-27; mild urticaria:7-15; well-controlled urticaria:1-6; and urticaria-free:0. Validated DLQI ranges show the impact on patients healthrelated quality of life (no effect: DLQI:0-1; small:2-5; moderate:6-10; very large:11-20; extremely large:21-30). Results: At baseline, all patients had only moderate or severe urticaria. Corresponding mean DLQI scores (10.9 and 14.3, respectively) were significantly different (P < 0.001). At 12 weeks, the full range of UAS7 health states was evident, reflecting treatment effect. Mean DLQI scores between adjacent UAS7 health states were statistically different (all P < 0.0001): severe vs moderate urticaria (DLQI:11.7 vs 8.1); moderate vs mild urticaria (DLQI:8.1 vs 4.9); mild vs well-controlled urticaria (DLQI:4.9 vs 2.3); and well-controlled urticaria vs urticaria-free (DLQI:2.3 vs 0.4). These show an increased impact with increase in urticaria severity. Conclusion: Categorising the UAS7 into five ranges efficiently describes CSU health states, contributing to a better understanding of impact on patients and response to treatment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2545, "end": 2548, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2549, "end": 2552, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2553, "end": 2556, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2557, "end": 2560, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2561, "end": 2564, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2565, "end": 2568, "text": "(6)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2569, "end": 2572, "text": "(7)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2573, "end": 2576, "text": "(8)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2577, "end": 2580, "text": "(9)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2581, "end": 2585, "text": "(10)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2586, "end": 2590, "text": "(11)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2591, "end": 2595, "text": "(12)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2596, "end": 2600, "text": "(13)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2601, "end": 2605, "text": "(14)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2606, "end": 2610, "text": "(15)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2611, "end": 2615, "text": "(16)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2616, "end": 2620, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2621, "end": 2625, "text": "(18)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "807"}, {"text": "Chronic urticaria: relation between autologous serum skin test and autoinmune disease Introduction: Chronic urticaria (CU) is a common disease in which most cases (40-50%) were considered autoimmune in origin. Autologous serum skin test (ASST) provides an easy, unexpensive investigation in CU and helps direct attention to underlying systemic autoimmune diseases. About a 27-60% positivity in AAST in CU has been reported previously. Objective: We aimed to characterise the frequency of ASST positive in chronic spontaneous urticaria and the association with autoimmune diseases. Methods: We present a retrospective study of patients referred to Allergy Outpatient in Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre for urticaria and/or chronic spontaneous angioedema between January 2010 to February 2013. These patients were referred by severity of symptoms and/or no response to treatment. Furthermore, other causes of urticaria were ruled by a blood count, liver, renal and thyroid function tests, C3 and C4 complement level estimation and antinuclear antibodies. The ASST was performed following EAACI/GA LEN task force consensus report: ASST in urticaria recommendations. Results: We studied 42 patients (22 male/ 20 female) with aged median (45.3 years;Background: Urticaria and angioedema are inflammatory skin diseases characterised by short-lived swellings due to the transient leakage of plasma from the small blood vessels into the surrounding connective tissue. An interplay between inflammation and coagulation has been suggested as one of the complex pathomechanism in urticaria and angioedema. Method: To investigate the coagulation status in patients with chronic urticaria (CU), both classical coagulation tests including prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and factor assays, and thrombin generation assay (TGA) were performed using plasma of 23 patients with CU and their results were compared with those of 23 healthy controls. Results: CU group showed both hypocoagulable and hypercoagulagle profiles. In patients with chronic urticaria, factor X, peak thrombin levels, and ETP (1011 AE 61.25 vs 1606 AE 46.98) were reduced and APTT was prolonged (34.16 AE 0.73 s vs 31.73 AE 0.33 s), while factor VII (121.6 AE 6.83 vs 107.1 AE 3.67) was increased and PT was shortened (10.82 AE 0.10 vs 11.54 AE 0.11) compared to those of healthy controls. Comparing with patients with autoserum skin test (ASST) positive CU, patients with ASST negative CU had more prominent shortening of PT and lower thrombin inhibition rate. Conclusion: CU is related with subclinical coagulation dysfunction without clinical thrombosis or hemorrhage, and ASST negative CU revealed more hypercoagulable state compared to ASST positive CU. Background: Recently, the efficacy of omalizumab was determined in patients with chronic urticaria, after 4 fold doses of antihistamines and combination therapy. In patients treated with ciclosporine or prednisone, the efficacy of omalizumab is less well described. Objective: To determine efficacy of omalizumab in patients with symptomatic chronic urticaria despite immunosuppressive treatment or during tapering off. Method: Four patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and one patient with inducible (cold contact) urticaria, all with or without angioedema or anaphylaxis, were treated with omalizumab according to individually determined regimens.All patients were treated with high dose H1-antihistamines plus immunosuppressants at baseline, and despite of this treatment they experienced symptoms during therapy or during tapering off immunosuppressants. Results: Of the four CSU patients, three were free of symptoms within 9 days after the first dose of 150 mg omalizumab. Of these patients, two remained in remission with maintenance of 150 mg omalizumab every 4 weeks (up to 8 months of treat- Urticaria is a vascular reaction of the skin marked by the transient appearance of wheals often attended by severe pruritus. Most cases of acute urticaria are self-limited and of short duration. Individual lesions resolve without scarring in some hours. In some cases it may be recurrent over weeks. The most common causes of acute urticaria are allergic reactions (food, drugs, latex) or infections.The authors report a case of a woman, 48 years old, caucasian, childhood educator, with ankylosing spondylitis since 2009, treated daily with naproxen, salazopyrin, methotrexate and infliximab (6/6 weeks). She was referenced to the Emergency Room (ER) by generalised maculopapular rash pruritic and palmoplantar swelling with 3 days of evolution. The patient denied others symptoms such as fever, fainting or dyspnoea. The rash started 10 min after an injection of intravenous magnesium metamizol, which appealed for lombalgia. Allergic reaction was assumed and she was medicated with antiH1 with partial improvement. Two days after she went again to the ER with sore throat, febrile, chest tightness and maintenance of hives. She had bilateral purulent conjunctivitis and oropharyngeal hyperemia without petechiae or pus. Pulmonary auscultation was rude. Chest radiograph revealed interstitial infiltrate. Analysis showed a slight increase of C-reactive protein. The diagnosis of acute urticaria due to infectious disease was then assumed. The patient was treated with amoxicillin 1 g (15 days) and azithromycin 500 mg (10 days), besides an-tiH1 and systemic corticosteroids. Fourtyeight hours after, the cutaneous symptoms totally resolved. Viral serologies were negative. IgG and IgA serum antibodies to Chlamydia pneumoniae were both positive. The patient waits allergologic study for magnesium metamizol allergy.Infections, including respiratory, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract are an important cause of hives. However, it's important an adequate allergologic study to exclude other possible causes. Background: In a woman with persistant angioedema with an unknown cause who are unresponsive to antihistamines and steroids, and have normal C1 inhibitor activity and quantity, and a negative family history of angioedema, it is unclear whether they have idiopathic angioedema or systemic disease. Case report: A 53 years old woman presented (May 2013) in our clinic with a generalised erythema, face angioedema, dyspnea, disphagia, abdominal swelling and prominent distention, dolorous abdomen. She refered to have 9 month history with urticaria, dyspnea, disphagia, abdominal swelling and dolorous abdomen, especially in standing possition and during walking. Despite the treatment with antihistamine and corticosteroids, urticaria persisted, almost every day and some episodes included face angioedema, dyspnea, disphagia, abdominal swelling and very severe distention. Physical examination revealed woman with dolorous and swollen abdomen, and also a swollen face. The pharynx was oedematous. She was not taking any drugs and had no history of infections. Usual laboratory tests were unremarkable. Blood test and bone morrow egzam were normal. Antigliadine antibody, antitissue transgloutaminase IgM and antitissue transgloutaminase IgA, SPT for food and inhalant were negative. C1 Esterase inhibitor, C4, C3, C1q was normal. The gastroenterologist confirmed no gastrointestinal pathology, he also recommended abdominal CT with contrast. The result of CT was:calcification in sickle in the wall of the abdominal aorta at the origin level of celiac trunk. She came out of hospital with the diagnosis of Idiopatic Urticaria and Angioedema, and treated with corticosteroids and antihistamins. She also was treated with a-blockers but abdominal swelling persisted. Discussion and conlusion: We presented a case of a woman with recurrent angioedema unresponsive to antihistamines may be idiopathic angioedema or systemic disease. The laboratory test ruled out all the tipes of Hereditary Angioedema or gastrointestinal pathology (Celiac desease etc.). We didn't bring to evidence the etiology of abdominal swelling and distention. The etiology of abdominal swelling and persistent severe distension is not clear, it might be an insufficiency of abdominal mesenteric arteries. Background: Recurrent angioedema (rAE) in young adults has several etiologies: hereditary, acquired, infectious, drugs, etc. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) are rarely prescribed at a young age, but should not be forgotten because angioedema induced by ACEis (ACEiIA) is present in 0.1-0.7% of treated patients. Case report: A 42-years-old woman presented with her fifth episode of non-pruritic edema affecting the lips and face in the past 10 months. The previous episode resolved over one to 2 days after administration of antihistamines and corticosteroids. She had no urticaria, abdominal pain, vomiting or diarrhea. There was no family history of angioedema, no history of drug related allergy and she was compliant with her medications in the past 3 years. Her past history included an interatrial communication, ostium primum defect; she was submitted to surgery in 2009 and since then she had been taking Bisoprolol 25 mg, Aspirin 100 mg and Lisinopril (ACE) 5 mg once a day. Physical examination was normal except for the swelling of the lips and face. Laboratory tests, including complement levels, were normal. Lisinopril was withdrawn and 48 h later the edema had disappeared, but 8 days later she presented with facial erythema. She was switched to therapy with Candersartan (ARBs)) prescribed by o her cardiologist due to a moderate mitral and tricuspid insufficiency. No recurrence was reported during a follow-up period of 21 months. A diagnosis of ACEiIA was made and the facial erythema was considered an adverse effect of corticosteroids. Conclusion: ACEiIA is the leading cause of rAE; the increase of ARBs' prescription leads to more ACEiIA cases. ARBs can be an alternative for patients with high therapeutic need for angiotensin inhibition. It is important for all Physicians to be aware of this presention so they can recognise the need for the patient to discontinue the offending agent and to avoid other potential offenders in the future. Primary localised cutaneous amiloydosis in a 50 years-old woman Background: Amyloidosis is defined as extracellular deposits of heterogenic, misfolded proteins, amyloid fibrils, in various tissues. Primary localised cutaneous amyloidosis (PLCA) is caused by this cutaneous deposit without the coexistence of systemic involvement. This material is insoluble and resistant to proteolysis proteins. Method: The patient is a 50 years-old woman with a personal history of hypertension. She presented light brown patch on the back and upper limbs together with itching in the area of the lesions, without other symptoms. Unrelated triggers. To reach the diagnosis we did: skin prick test with food 0 s battery (cereals, nuts, vegetables, fruits, milk, egg, meat, fish, seafood, profilin, LTP, Latex and Anisakis), laboratory exams (hemogram and biochemistry, thyroid hormones, auto-antibodies ANA and antithyroid, study of the complement, immunoglobulins IgA, IgG and IgM), analysis of urine and skin biopsy of a macula of her back. Results: The skin prick-test, laboratory exams and analysis of urine were normal. The histological exam of the back biopsy showed an amorphous eosinophilic substance, located on the superior and vascular dermises, positive for red Congo staining and with green birefringence to polarized light, which confirmed the diagnosis of amyloidosis. Conclusion: We present a case that consider interesting for being rare and remember that we must have it present in the differential diagnosis of urticaria. It is difficult to control the symptoms. PLCA is a benign disease with a good prognosis that is associated with a low risk of developing Sistemic Amiloydosis, but routine followup for this patient is necessary to detect any potential disease progression. Background: Pruritus is the most common skin disorder in elderly people and its prevalence increases with age. Persistent pruritus is frequent cause for patients presentation to allergists, but allergies can be proven in relative small number of cases. Differential diagnosis of persistent pruritus in elderly is complex and should consider, besides allergies, many infectious, systemic, metabolic, psychiatric and neoplastic diseases. The most frequent neoplasia associated with pruritus are hepatobiliar and pancreatic cancers, Hodgkin and cutaneous lymphoma. Method and results: We report a case of a 69 years old woman presented to our Allergology Department for progressively aggravated pruritus for more than 1 year, with no clear cause, despite many visits to dermatologists and other specialities. Hiperpigmentation, persistent reticular exantema of the thorax and upper limbs and severe xerosis followed after 6 months of apparently isolated pruritus. All blood tests for infection, food allergy, as well as inflammation, autoimmunity, hepatic and renal diseases and CT scan were negative. The second dermatological opinion considered the aspect of the skin suggestive for poikiloderma atrophicans vasculare and a skin biopsy from affected area was performed. The path report with immunohistochemical confirmation showed mycosis fungoides, a cutaneous T cell lymphoma stage IB, without systemic involvement. The topical treatment with emollients, psoralen-enhanced phototherapy, oral retinoids, tricyclic antidepressant and antihistaminic was started, with good results. Conclusion: This case is illustrative for importance of complex evaluation of persistent pruritus in elderly patients and correct indication of skin biopsy if any characteristic skin changes appear. In spite of escalated treatment with high doses of a variety of non-sedating and sedating antihistamines H1, montelukast 10 mg/d, deflazacort 30 mg/d, levothyroxine 25 mg/d (due to anti-antibodies tiroglobulin positive results), no improvement was observed. We also treated with colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily based on previous studies with no response. Skin prick test with commercial standard panel of food allergens, inhalants, skin pressure test, blood count, blood biochemistry, thyroid hormones, immunoglobulins, proteinogram, ANA, total IgE, serum triptase, complement (C3, C4, C1 inhibitor), specific IgE to ascaris, echinococcus and anisakis were between normal values. Antibody anti-thyroglobulin 405 IU/ml. Cutaneous biopsy revealed leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Results: We started treatment with Omalizumab 300 mg monthly achieving remission of symptoms after the first dose, maintaining a score of 0 in UAS 7 in monthly visits and a progressive decrease of medication, at the present time only hydroxyzine 25 mg daily. Conclusion: We 0 ve only found one abstract communication of efficacy of Omalizumab in the treatment of UV. This good response was confirmed in our case too, therefore, Omalizumab could be a therapeutic option in these patients. Background: In clinical trials MP29-02 (a novel intranasal formulation of azelastine hydrochloride (AZE) and fluticasone propionate (FP) in an advanced delivery system) provided complete/near complete symptom control in 1 of 6 moderate-tosevere SAR patients 1 and complete relief in 7 of 10 mild-to-moderate PAR patients. 2 This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of MP29-02 in routine clinical practice. Method: Results from Germany (n = 1133) from a multinational, multicentre, prospective, observational study in adults/adolescents with moderate-to-severe AR for whom MP29-02 was prescribed according to summary of product characteristics are reported. Patients assessed symptom severity using a visual analog score (VAS) from 0 mm (not at all bothersome) to 100 mm (very bothersome), in the AM prior to MP29-02 use, on Days 0, 1, 3, 7 and treatment end. Intended study duration was 14 days. This was flexible to allow for normal clinical practice. Patients had acute AR symptoms on Day 0 and VAS >50 mm. VAS <20 mm was considered controlled. 3 Patients' perceived level of disease control (i.e. well-, partly-and uncontrolled) was assessed on Day 3. Results: MP29-02 (1 spray/nostril bd; daily doses:AZE = 548 lg;FP = 200 lg) provided effective symptom control from Day 1, averaging 21.03 mm by treatment end. 62.7% of patients had VAS <20 mm at that time. Symptoms were well-controlled in those with more-(baseline VAS 75-100 mm) and less-severe symptoms (baseline VAS 50-74 mm). One in every two patients felt their symptoms were wellcontrolled after just 3 days treatment. Conclusion: MP29-02 provides effective and rapid symptom control in a real-world setting with responder rates higher than those observed in a clinical trial with moderate to severe AR patients, supporting MP29-02's position as the drug of choice for the treatment of AR. Background: Intranasal sprays must be delivered to the nasal cavity in sufficient volume, appropriate viscosity and droplet size and with a technique that allows optimal retention, maximizes absorption from the mucosa, and the potential for max therapeutic effect. The aim of this study was to evaluate nasal drug run-off after administration of MP29-02* (a novel intranasal formulation of azelastine hydrochloride (AZE) and fluticasone propionate (FP) in an advanced delivery system) with sequential administration of marketed AZE and FP nasal sprays in vitro. Method: A normal adult human nasal cavity in vitro model was used. 1,2 A single spray of MP29-02* (0.137 ml [137 lg AZE/50 lg FP]) or single sequential sprays of AZE (0.137 ml) followed 1 min later by either branded or generic FP (0.100 ml; i.e. multiple therapy) were manually actuated into the model (away from the septum). A slight vacuum was applied during spray delivery to simulate inhalation. Results: Three replicates of MP29-02* showed no dripping or back flow from the nasal cavity. However, three replicates of sequential sprays of AZE followed 1 min later by either branded or generic FP showed significant anterior nasal drip (i.e. run-off) from the nostril and also toward the back of the nasal cavity (i.e. posteriorly, which would be swallowed in vivo). Conclusion: MP29-02* is a new AR treatment, comprising AZE and FP in a single spray in an improved formulation and device (vs marketed FP). In this model, the delivery of MP29-02* showed improved retention in the targeted areas compared to sequential administration of marketed intranasal monoproducts. These could not be administered together without run off (posteriorly and anteriorly) which could diminish efficacy. Background: New allergic rhinitis (AR) treatments should provide rapid and sustained relief from all nasal symptoms. Our aim was to assess the efficacy of MP29-02* (a novel intranasal formulation of azelastine hydrochloride (AZE) and fluticasone propionate (FP) in an advanced delivery system) in providing nasal symptom relief vs AZE, FP or placebo (PLA). Method: Six hundred and ten moderate/ severe SAR patients (\u226512 years) were randomized into a double-blind, PLA-controlled, 14-day, parallel-group, US trial (NCT00660517) to MP29-02*, AZE, FP or PLA nasal sprays (one spray/nostril bd; daily dose: AZE = 548 lg;FP = 200 lg). 1 Overall change from baseline (CFB) in reflective total nasal symptom score Background: MP29-02 (a novel intranasal formulation of azelastine hydrochloride (AZE) and fluticasone propionate (FP) in an advanced delivery system) provides faster, more complete nasal symptom relief than current firstline monotherapy. 1 However, ocular symptoms are frequently the most troublesome complaints for patients with SAR. Our aim was to compare the proportion of SAR patients achieving substantial and complete/near-to-complete ocular symptom relief and the time taken to achieve these responses, following treatment with MP29-02, FP, AZE or placebo (PLA). Method: A total of 610 moderate to severe SAR patients (\u226512 years) were randomized into a double-blind, PLA-controlled, 14day, parallel-group trial (NCT00660517) to MP29-02, AZE, FP or PLA nasal sprays (one spray/nostril bd; daily dose: AZE = 548 lg; FP = 200 lg). Overall change from baseline in reflective total ocular symptom score (rTOSS) was assessed secondarily. A symptomatic patient sub-set was identified with baseline rTOSS \u22658. Time to achieve \u226550% rTOSS reduction from baseline (i.e. substantial relief) and \u22641 point left in each ocular symptom (AM + PM, range 0-6; complete/near-to-complete relief) were assessed post-hoc in this sub-set. Results: The ocular symptom burden was halved in one in every two MP29-02patients (53.2%) or AZE-patients (50.2%) vs 35.0% of FP-and 36.2% of PLApatients. MP29-02 achieved this response \u22647 days faster than FP (P = 0.0047) and \u22649 days (P = 0.0024) faster than PLA. FP did not differ from PLA. More MP29-02 patients also achieved \u22641 pt remaining in each ocular symptom (27.8%; one out of four) vs 20.4% of FP-, 19.8% of AZE-and 6.9% of PLA-patients; \u22647 days faster than FP or AZE and \u226410 days faster than PLA. Conclusion: More MP29-02 patients achieved complete/near to complete relief from their ocular symptoms, and do so days faster than current firstline therapy of either AZE or FP nasal spray. Background: The Meibomius glands, situated in the depth of palpebral tars, are sebaceous, tubular glands that produce the lipid layer of the tear film. The Meibomium gland dysfunction is a noninflammatory disease characterised by changes in the quality of gland secretion, obstruction of drainage ori-fices with consequences on the tear film. This is interpreted in practice by dryness due to excessive tear evaporation and instability.Ocular allergies are often associated ocular surface phatology, especially with the dry eye. An insufficient and/or low quality tear film is responsible for the increase in concentration of allergens on the ocular surface. The Meibomium gland dysfunction is responsible for the decrease in thickness or the disappearance of the lipidic layer of the tear film leading to exaggerated evaporation and increase of its osmolarity.The diagnostic of allergic conjunctivitis assumes a rigurous patient history and a positive allergic assessment. Method: The present study is a prospective one, performed on a 1-year period, which involves 45 patients who suffer from Meibomium gland dysfunction and feature ocular surface specific symptoms. Criteria for inclusion: Meibomium gland dysfunction, revealed through biomicroscopy, signs of xerophtalmy, history of allergic manifestations, ocular allergy symptoms. Criteria for exclusion: Patients with ocular dry eye syndrome without Meibomium gland dysfunction who respond well to the use of artificial tears. Results: Of the 45 patients, 31 (68.8%) presented type I hypersensitivity. Among patients with allergic sensitivity, the allergen is represented by dust mite allergy-18 patients, pollen from grasses -7 cases, Ambrosia elatior pollen-7 patients, birch pollen-1 patient, cat epithelia-3 patients, molds-2 cases. Nine patients presented sensitisation to more than one allergen: three patients to house dust mites and Ambrosia pollen, two patients to house dust mites and grasses pollen, one patient to house dust mites and molds, one patient to house dust mites and cat epithelia, one patient to both Ambrosia and grasses pollen, and one to both cat and dog epithelia. Conclusion: Meibomium Gland dysfunction which often generates dry eye syndrome is a risk factor for eye allergies. The diagnosis and treatment rigor is given by the cooperation with the allergy specialist. Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS) results from exuberant IgE-mediated inflammation of the nasal mucosa and sinuses triggered by hypersensitivity to fungal allergens. Mixed phenotypes are rare with only 32 cases reported in the literature, all of which occurred in pairs with the commonest combination being AFRS and chronic granulomatous invasive fungal sinusitis (CGFS). We report the first patient, to our knowledge, with four concurrent mixed phenotypes of fungal sinusitis -AFRS, CGFS, fungal ball and local fungal colonisation. A 12 years old immunocompetent, non-atopic Arabic girl presented with unilateral proptosis. Imaging showed masses in several facial sinuses invading into adjacent structures including the left orbit, cavernous sinus and intracranial fossae. Total serum and Aspergillus specific IgE levels were significantly raised, indicative of an Ig-E mediated systemic inflammation. Aspergillus fungal hyphae were found in all biopsy specimens. There was eosinophil-rich (allergic) mucin in the right nasal mucosa, invasive granulomatous inflammation in the left orbital mass, pterygopalatine and infratemporal fossae and a fungal ball and local fungal colonisation in the left sphenoid sinus. Complete surgical debridement is conventionally recommended for such patients, but was limited in this case by close proximity to crucial structures. Thus the mainstay of treatment was restricted to oral corticosteroids and systemic antifungal therapy alone, which still achieved very good clinical response. Subcutaneous fungal immunotherapy is being considered as well. This is the first known case worldwide of such extensively mixed fungal sinusitis phenotypes and initial response to the unconventional treatment was excellent. Long term prognosis is still unknown and close follow up is essential for monitoring of recurrence.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 15284, "end": 15285, "text": "2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 19200, "end": 19201, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 19515, "end": 19516, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "827"}]}
