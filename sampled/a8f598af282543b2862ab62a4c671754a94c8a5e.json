            "text": "Background and objectives: CLS Is characterized by loss of intravasa] fluids to the interstitium. CLS is a side effect of cytokine infusion, and a complication of sepis and/or bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The classical pathway of complement is activated in this condition. and the activation marker C4d shows Increased plasma concentrations. We tested the effects of CI esterase Inhibitor (C] INH) in CLS after BMT in a randomized unblinded pilot study. -Materials and Methods: Definition of CLS was ~ncrease of body welght more than 3% within 24 hours combined with generalized edema and impaired hemodynamic system (tachycardla and/or hypotonla). 32 patients (pts] underwent 8MT during the study period. 8/32 pts developed CLS; 4 pts were randomized to recelve C1 INH, and the other 4 pts received the standard treatment only. Dosage scheme for CI INH was 60 U/kg (initial dose) followed by 2 doses 6 30 U/kg and 4 doses 6 15 U/kg each 12 hours. -Results: Total weight gain in the CLS pts was 9.2+3.8% (of body weight pre-BMT) at randomization for C1 INH treatment. C1 INH treatment q_rQuD: The body weight was normalized In 3/4 pts after 7 days due to negative fluid balances; none of these ptients required hemodialysis. In 1/4 pts, CLS was improved after 3 days, but was recurrent after end of C1 INH treatment, This patient developed lung edema, required mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis and died for nosocomlal pneumonia while beeing on the respirator. Patients that did not recelv9 C1 INH: 3/4 pts died with severe CLS and a septic shock-like syndrome, combined with ascites, renal failure and/or lung edema; 1/4 pts showed worsening CLS for three days. At this time, the latter pt was switched to C1 INH treatment, followed by normalization of body weight, edema and ascltes. Lqboratorv O$$OV~: The complement system was activated in all pts with CLS. In the treatment group, C4d concentrations were 3,2+_1.6 mg/I pre BMT. increased to 5.9+2,4 mg/i prior to Cl INH treatment, decreased to 3,6+1.4 mg/I after the initial dose of Cl INH, and were 3.7-+0,8 mg/dl at the end of the C1 INH treatment cycle.-Conclusions: C1 INH appears to be a promising therapy for CLS after BMT. A double-blind, randomized trial is indicated to assess the effects of C1 INH on the overall outcome of patients with CLS. Administration of high doses of IL-2 induces a septic shock-like syndrome, the vascular leak syndrome (VLS), which is characterized hypotension and capillary leakage. We have observed that many of the mediators known to be involved in the pathogenesis of septic shock, are also released and activated during the VLS induced by 11_-2. Also the complement system becomes activated during VLS, which activation, occurring via the classical pathway, correlates with the severity of this syndrome. We investigated the possibility to attenuate the toxicity of 11_-2 by co-administration of the main inhibitor of the classical complement pathway, C1 -Inhibitor (C1 -Inh). Six patients with metastatic melanoma or renal cell carcinoma received 72xl 06 IU of IL-2 daily together with exogenous C1-Inh (2,000 U initially, 1,000 U every 12 hours thereafter) for 4 days. Two patients tolerated this dose of IL-2 without needing vasopressor medication, another needed this medication for only one day. The degree of hypotension in the 6 patients was the same as observed in patients who received a four-fold lower dose of IL-2 without exogenous C1-Inh. Moreover, activation of complement in the 6 patients was less then expected for the dose of IL-2 given. These results suggest that Cl-lnh therapy is able to reduce IL-2 toxicity and IL-2 induced complement activation. LPS is the major cell wall component of bacteria being responsible for the pathological consequences of infection with Gram-negative bacteria. Whereas LPS is only found in Gram-negative bacteria, peptidoglycan (PG) is a cell wall component present in Gramnegative as well as Gram-positive bacteria. PG constitutes a polymer of 131,4-1inked N-acetylmuramic acid-N-acetylglycosamine disaccharide being crosslinked by peptides bridges. PG expresses inflammatory properties like LPS and has already been described to induce inflammatory cytoldnes in monocytes/macrophages. More recently it was reported that PG and LPS share the same 70 kD binding protein on murine B-lymphocytes. This finding raised the question as to whether LPS and PG also share common properties on activation of monocytes. For our investigations we used a soluble PG preparation (sPG) released by Staphylococcus aureus upon treatment with penicillin. Our experiments show that sPG induces monokine production in human monocytes. Surprisingly, antagonists of LPS action, i.e. anti-CD14 monoclonal antibodies and lipid A partial structures, were also able to inhibit activation of, cells by sPG. In contrast, fetal calf serum enhanced the responsiveness of monocytes only to LPS, but inhibited monocyte activation by sPG. Furthermore, bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI) only blocked LPSbut not sPG-induced monokine release. Our results indicate that CD14 is not only involved in monocyte activation by LPS but also by sPG. However, the serum components BPI and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) do not affect the activity of sPG.",

The N-terminal lipopeptide of the lipoprotein has been identified as its biologically active part. Lipopeptides prepared by chemical synthesis constitute potent activators of human and murine B cells and monocytes/macrophages. As shown by electron energy loss spectroscopy lipopeptides are rapidly taken up by leukocytes. Minutes after stimulation they are found within different compartments of the cells including the nucleus. Applying the freeze-fracture technique we showed that the initial step of leukocyte activation is associated with alterations in density and size of the intramembrane particles implying a possible role of plasma membrane constituents in lipopeptide induced signal transfer. There is little known about signalling pathways initiated by lipopeptides. They bypass phosphatidylinositol metabolism and protein kinase C activation. They lead to changes in the intracellular calcium concentrations; however, this intracellular event does not seem to play an essential role in leukocyte activation. Associated with lipopeptide induced activation in macrophages is the change of the ADP-ribosylation state of a cytosolic protein.",

The explosion of knowledge occurring around that time provided an excellent background against which the first conference in 1988 provided stateof-the-art information and consensus on factors involved in injury and sepsis. In 1991, the Second Congress was held at the time of another resurgence of research, study and information on injured and operated patients. It seemed then that there would be a lull in the development of new information and therapy, and that another state-of-the art conference might not be necessary until 1995 or 1996.",

            "text": "However, the explosion in molecular biology has continued. The wonderful world of cytokines has gone from ILl to IL-6 to IL-11, IL-12 and IL-13 and beyond. The vast amount of information about mediators and their importance in disease is impressive. This has all suggested a magic bullet that might be used to alter or block inflammatory responses. This has not happened, however, and the question is \"Why not\"? Our science is powerful, but our therapy is still weak. What are the issues, then, in 1994, to be dealt with at this symposium and congress? (1) Proposals for new terminology. There have been a number of proposals for new terminology and new classifications of injury, sepsis, inflammation and various other problems related to human illness. The question is whether this is the way to go. Will this contribute to better clinical trials, information basis and better research? The pros and cons of this development will be reviewed by those making the proposals and those questioning the need for and wisdom of this effort. (2) Magic bullets: the prospect of a magic bullet to deal with inflammation in injury and infection seemed highly promising earlier. Many preclinical trials and a lot of animal research suggested the possibility of a great breakthrough in clinical care. What has become, then, of all the expensive and extensive multi-institution randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of agents that block mediators and endotoxin. Many such studies have yielded equivocal, marginal or negative results. The reasons for this and the future of clinical research will be the subject of presentations and discussions to set the stage for further work. (3) Should future clinical trials be based on new classifications of illness such as MODS, SIRS, APACHE III, SAP II, MRM, etc., or should trials be dedicated to specific diseases -urinary tract infections, pneumonia, trauma patients, cardiac surgery and other specific problems, rather than generalized problems of sepsis, the sepsis syndrome and other classifications? In other words, should we now begin to have clinical trials on specific diseases with causes that are known and can be attacked? The causality of disease becomes an important consideration in this regard. (4) A multitude of potential therapeutic agents has been proposed on the basis of animal studies. How should we decide which of them should be brought to clinical trial? The possibilities are endless as we develop new clinical information about the mechanisms and pathogenesis of human disease. (5) Information on the pathogenic mechanism of disease states and of injury continued to emerge in an explosive fashion, and in light of our gathering knowledge we can look forward to working out a cohesive system of response to injury. (6) Additional information will be provided in plenary sections, many symposia and free communication sessions and posters, which will update the participants on a variety of relevant topics presented by many of the leading in-IV vestigators in these fields. Topics will range from molecular mechanisms, such as signal transduction, through the explosive growth of information on the role of cytokines and pathophysiology, to practical considerations in the design of immunomodulatory therapeutic regimens. These merely touch on a few areas, from the basic to the clinical, which will be the subjects of those symposia. All this information will fit into the jigsaw of this exciting area and its stimulus to further research study.",

In addition to hradyk{nln, another product of the contact system, kaIlikrein, can mediate inflammation by virtue of its chemotaetic mad neutrophJ/activating properties. Using functional and immunochemical tech~2ques, we have demonstrated activation of the contact system in the adult respiratory distress syndrome in typhoid fever and clin/cal sepsis. We have also been able to inhibit the hypotension but not the disseminated intravaseular coagulation in a model of primate sepsis by the use of a monoclonal antibody directed agsi~st factor XII, the initiating protein of the contact system, in volunteers given E. coil endotoxin, who did not develop hypotension, we were also able to demonstrate activation of the contact system with a rise of alpha-2macrogiebulin-kalllkrein complex. We have also examined, J~ an i~tensive care situation, patients with SIRS. We found that serial measuremezzts of the contact system were useful in eva~u~ting prognosis+ These studies suggest that inhibition of kalllkrein a~d l e r bradykinin actions might be useful i~ obviating many .of the features seen in sepsis and septic shock. Dextran sulfate (DXS) activates the contact system and, in vivo, produces transient hypotension. In order to better define the mechanisms underlying the DXS-induced hypotension, we investigated the effects of either the plasma kallikrein inhibitor, des-Pro2-iArg]5]aprotinin (BAY 4620) or the B2 kinin antagonist, Hoe 140 on the hypotensive response to DXS. In the first study, anesthetized miniature pigs (5 pigs/group, randomly assigned) were given one of the following treatment protocols: 1) DXS (5 mg/kg), 2-5) DXS plus BAY 4620 (45, 90, 180, or 360 rag), or 6) saline. DXS alone produced a profound but transient systemic arterial hypotension with a corresponding reduction in plasma kinin-containing kininogen. Circulating kinin levels, complement fragment C3adesArg and fibrin mom)mer were all increased. BAY 4620 produced a dose-dependent delay or attenuation in these effects with the highest dose completely blocking DXS-induced hypotension and elevations of kinin, C3adesArg and fibrin monomer levels. Thus, the effects of DXS are solely dependent on contact system activation and this activation is sensitive to BAY 4620. llowev~:r, contact system activation is known to produce changes in a variety of vasoactive mediators, all of which can affect blood pressure. In a second study, two groups of pigs (3/group) were given either DXS alone (2 mg/kg) or DXS 10 minutes after a bolus injection of Hoe 140 (30 #g/kg). DXS alone produced transient hypotenmon. This response was completely blocked by Hoe 140 pretreatment. Both groups had identical reductions in kinin-containing kininogen. We conclude that DXS-induced hypotension is produced by activation of the contact system which results in the production of bradykinin. Liberation of bradykinin is both necessary and sufficient to produce all of the hemodynamic changes observed.",

A number of pathological disorders as reperfusion injury, bone marrow transplantation, polytrauma and septic shock are associated with capillary leakage. As the activation of the complement system and the contact phase play a major role in these diseases we investigated whether Cl-lnhibitor (C1-INH), which inactivates Cl-esterase, kallikrein and clotting factors XII and Xl, could abolish vascular leakage. A capillary leakage was induced in rats by the administration of interleukin-2 (5 x 106 IU/kg). The increased vascular permeability was monitored for one hour as the extravasation of FITC marked rat serum albumin from a mesenterial vessel by a video-image processing system. CI-INH (Berinert\u00ae, Behringwerke) given as a single i.v. bolus in concentrations of 100, 250 or 500 U/kg dose-dependently prevented the capillary leakage. Carrageenaninduced inflammation in the rat leads to vascutar leakage and to edematous swelling of the paw. CI-INH in this model leads to a dose-dependent decrease in paw edema formation. Finally, we investigated the effect of CI-INH (infusion (100-125 U/kg x h) on a LPS-induced shock in the rat by combination therapy with the antithrombotlc agents antithrombin Ill (Kybernin\u00ae) or rec. Hirudin (both substances from Behringwerke). In this animal model mortality was 90 % in the untreated control. Both antithrombotic agents decreased mortality rates by inhibiting formation of DIC; a further significant improvement of survival was achieved by the treatment with CI-INH. Thus+ it could be concluded that C1-INH has a beneficial effect in diseases associated with a vascular leakage.

C3 levels were lower for septic-patients (840 + 480 lag/ml) than for non-septic-patients (1340 _+ 770 lag/ml). The most profound difference between both groups was found, when the C3a/C3 ratio was compared (1.84 + 2.28 for septic-patients and 0.4 _+_ 0.18 for the control group). No significant differences between both patient groups were observed in C5a plasma levels (5.9 + 2.1 ng/ml in septic-patients vs. 5.6 _+ 1.5 ng/ml in control patients). In 13 of 20 cases of clinically defined sepsis causative organisms like bacteria, protozoa or fungi could be cultured from blood, bronchoalveolar lavages and/or section materials. Application of the complement parameters to survivors (n=9) and non-survivors (n=l 1) within the septic-group revealed, that the C3a/C3 ratio could also be used as a prognostic parameter for clinical outcome. The possibility of rapid and easy measurement of C3a and C3 in only 20-25 minutes (2) and the significant difference of the C3aJC3 ratio between the septic and non-septic group renders this parameter a good candidate for early diagnosis of sepsis in the intensive care unit. Hirudin, a single polypeptide chain composed of 65 amino acids with 6 cysteine residues (MR 7000 daitons), is the most potent and specific thrombin inhibitor, which is now available as a genetically engineered product (rec. Hirudin -HBW 023, Behringwerke; Marburg). The aim of our study was to establish a rabbit model of tissue factor (TF) induced activation of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation and to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of rec. Hirudin. Coagulation was induced in female NZW rabbits by infusion of 0.5 p.g/kgxh thromboplastin for 7 hours. Development of disseminated clotting was manifested by a decrease of fibrinogen and platelets to 27.0 % and 33,0 % respectively, and by an increase of fibrin monomers from 13.2 to > 85.0 ~tg/ml. We administered rec. Hirudin to rabbits in 3 different concentrations (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg); treatment started simultaneously with the infusion as an i.v. bolus. Rec. Hirudin significantly prevented the decrease of fibrinogen, platelets and the increase of fibrin monomers. This effect was dose dependent and long lasting, even 7 hours after the administration of rec. Hirudin, clotting was still significantly reduced. As could be drawn from the plasma levels, rec. Hirudin had been cleared from plasma at this time. In a post-treatment study we administered rec. Hirudin (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg i.v. bolus) as late as 2 hours after the start of TF infusion. At this time there was already a prominent activation of coagulation. Even in this post-treatment regimen rec. Hirudin significantly prevented disseminated clotting. Hence, it was concluded, that rec. Hirudin by inkihiting thrombin could be effective in the prevention of coagulation disorders including disseminated intravascular clotting (DIC) induced by a septic disease.",

UTI is a glycoprotein with a structure in which 2 Kunitz-type inhibitor domains are linked in a row. We isolated the gene encoding the second Kunitz-type inhibitor domain of UTI, and then constructed expression plasmids by ligating it to the E. coli PhoA signal peptide gene. These plasmids expressed the second domain in E. coil strain JE5505 which lacks the membrane lipoprotein. The recombinant second domain (R-020) inNb[ted trypsin, plasmin, neutrophil elastase and chymotrypsin. In addition it inhibited blood coagulation factor Xa and plasma kallikrein in a concentration dependent and competitive manner. The in vivo effect of the recombinant R-020 was investigated in a rat model of septic shock induced by cecal ligation and puncture. The administration of R-020 significantly improved the survival rate of the rats and attenuated the pathological changes of lung and iiver. We found out the novel protease inhibitory activities of the second domain of UTI and its protective effects on sepsis-induced organ injury. Macrophages are known to secrete lysosomal proteinases,mainly cathepsin B and cathepsin L, and also ~-proteinase inhibitor (PI),related to acute phase proteins.Disturbances of proteinases/ proteinase inhibitors correlates with inflammatory process,leading sometimes to noncontrol \"pathGlogical\" proteolysis (Jochum et ai.,1990) . The cathepsin L-like and cathepsin B-like activity were measured in serum of 42 patients with chronic bronchitis (14 -with obstructive, 28 -with nonobstructive bronchitis),acute bronchitis (15) and 35 healthy persons.Simultaneously the level of~PI was determined in the same groups.Cysteine proteinases were measured with help of fluorogenic substrates,as was presented earlier (Korolenko et ai.,1991) , ~PI with help of immune enzyme method. It was shown increase of cathepsin L-like and cathepsin B-like activities during aggravation of chronic bronchitis comparatively to the controls (2-4 fold) .After treatment there was a tendency to normalization of indices,but the increase was about 30-40% more than the control values.~PI level in this group was also increased (two-fold),in patients with acute bronchitis -2-4-times more comparatively to the control.It is possible to conclude that chronic bronchitis induced increased secretion both cysteine proteinases and d{PI into blood. Some peculiarities of ratio were noted in patients with emphysema. Endotoxins are microbial products derived from the outer cell membrane of Gram negative bacteria. The active component of endotoxin is lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a complex macromolecule consisting of polysaccharide covalently bound to a unique lipid, termed lipid A. Now recognized to embody the endotoxic principle of LPS, lipid A consists of a/31-6 diglucosamine backbone, both ester and amide linked fatty acids, some of which are acyloxyacylated, and charged constituents such as phosphate, phosphorylethanolamine and 4 amino arbinose LPS, exerts its biological effects in vivo by noncytotoxic interactions with a variety of host inflammatory mediator cells, primarily the mononuclear phagocyte and the endothelial cell, although other host cells also participate. These interactions are modulated by LPS-specific binding proteins found in plasma, including LPS-binding protein (LBP) sCD14 and perhaps other proteins as well. Specific receptors for LPS have been identified on mammalian cells which mediate signal transduction via multiple pathways. LPS-activated host cells are stimulated to secrete or express multiple proinflammatory mediators, including TNF-a, ILla, IL-1/3, IFN-a, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, PAF, PGE, LTB 4 and procoagulant activity. The overproduction of these proinfiammatory mediators results in the manifestations of endotoxemia, observed experimentally as fever, hypotension, disseminated intravascular coagulation and death. Modulation of activity of these mediators protects animals against lethality. Similar pathways are thought to be operative in Gram negative sepsis, and control studies with human volunteers support such conclusions. Immunotherapeutic approaches in clinical Gram negative sepsis have, to date, been less successful. In vitro experiments and studies in animal models have recently shown that several proteinaceous bacterial exotoxins can evoke cytotoxic effects that ultimately lead to cardiovascular collapse and shock. Since the possible relevance of bacterial exotoxins in the pathogenesis of septic shock has received very little attention in the past, an attempt will be made here to provide a brief overview of this generaily neglected topic.",

Major representatives of the former group are the adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylating toxins, e.g. cholera and cholera-like toxins, diphtheria toxin), and the neurotoxins. Most medically relevant toxins of this category have been studied in great detail. Although often responsible for severe and sometimes fatal disease, their association with septic shock is rare. In contrast, experimental evidence is accumulating for a role of membrane<lamaging toxins in the pathogenesis of inflammatory lesions. Formation of transmembrane pores is probably the most widespread mechanism via which such physical membrane perturbation can occur (1,2), the present discussion will be restricted to this category of toxins. The author shall first discuss basic properties of pore-forming proteins, and consider the factors that direct their attack to specific targets. Thereafter, attention will be drawn to diverse functional consequences that may follow membrane damage so that a general concept of how pore-forming toxins may contribute towards the development of shock will evolve. I. Bhakdi, S. and Tranum-Jensen. J. 1987 Gram positive bacteria produce exotoxins that, at least in part, exhibit the unusual properties of superantigens. Superantigens (SAg) activate V/3 selectively T cells to produce lymphokines including I1-2 and TNF/lymphotoxin. Systemic application of the SAg staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) to D-galactosamine sensitized mice causes lethal shock within hours. SEB reactive V/38 + T cells accumulate within 90-120 min mRNA for the II-2, I1-4, TNFaI~ and IFN-3,. Parallel in time high concentrations of bloodborne I1-2 and TNF are noted. Anti TNF t~//3 neutralizing mAb protect mice against SEB induced T cell dependent lethal shock thus indicating a key role of TNF in effecting lethal toxicity. Within 12-18 h distinct levels of tolerance to SEB become discernable on ligand reactive V/38 T ceils, dependent of the dose of SEB used. These levels include anergy, T cell receptor downregulation, loss of CD2, CD4, CD8 accessory molecules and programmed cell death.",

The sensitivity towards endotoxin (LPS) is genetically determined, however it may be increased under different experimental conditions. These include treatment with hepatotoxic agents such as D-galactosamine, and with live (infection) or killed bacteria. It is well established now that D-galactosamine sensitizes to LPS by increasing the susceptibility of the host to toxic activity of LPS-induced TNF~. Sensitization by bacteria, especially by Gram-negative once is of especial interest because it implies that infecting microorganisms not only produce LPS, but als0 sensitize the host to its lethal activity. Sensitization to LPS by bacteria proceeds in all LPS-sensitive (Lps n) mouse strains that have been investigated so far. It also proceeds in LPS-resistant (Lps d) C3H/HeJ mice. The absence of sensitization to LPS in Lps d C57BL/10ScCr mice was identified as being due to their inability to produce interferon-7 (IFN?). Administration of exogenous IFN? to these mice conferred sensitivity to LPS. Conversely, administration of anti-IFN? to Lpsn; mice inhibited the development of sensitization'by bacteria. It may be concluded therefore that IFN7 is the mediator of sensitization to LPS by bacterial infection.",

The IFN?producing cells themselves were shown to be intact. On closer investigation the impaired IFN? response was identified as the result of a defective accessory function of macrophages. Macrophages of C57BL/10ScCr mice are incapable of producing interferon-~ (IFN~) which we could show to be obligatory for the production of IFN? in response to bacteria. Although antibiotics are required to clear bacteremia, they do not reverse evolving shock, because endotoxin free in the bloodstream or exposed on the surface of circulating bacteria continues to activate the production of inflammatory mediators, Furthermore, antibiotics have been shown to induce release of endotoxin from gram-negative bacteria during the treatment of severe infection. In an in-vitro study, using live Escherichia coil, we have observed the release of endotoxin upon treatment with several antibiotics like cefuroxim, imipenem, ceftazidime and aztreonam. Incubation with imipenem or ceftazidime induced an early lyeis and a mild rise in endotoxin levels, whereas incubation with cefuroxime or aztreonam resulted in the formation of filaments with a late but dramatic rise in endotoxin levels. In a second study we studied the influence of different antibiotics on the TNF-= production of E.coli stimulated human monocytes. We found again great differences in the production of this important cytokine among the different antibiotics according to their capacity to induce liberation of endotoxin. These differences in the amount of endotoxin release are probably caused by Penicillin-Binding-Proteins (PBP) specificities of the antibiotics with resultant differential morphological changes, In a rat sepsis model treatment with imipenem or ceftazidime resulted in a transient increase in IL-6 levels, whereas treatment with aztreonam resulted in progressively increasing levels of IL-6 and a significant increase in mortality. The increased mortality in PBP-3 specific aztreonam treated rats might have been the result of filament formation in the abdominal cavity of the septic rats. The endotoxin sequestered at local sites may account for the precipitation of gram-negative shock. Finally, we've also demonstrated that in patients under treatment for septic shock endotoxin release can be related to the administration of antibiotics.",

Kropp, Merck Research Laboratories, Rahway, NJ B-lactam (cell-wall active) antibiotics are generally deemed the class of antibiotics most responsible for the release of free endotoxin (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria due to their cell lytic actions although all antibiotic classes studied thus far induce release of endotoxin. We have recently shown in-vitro that antibiotics within the b-lactam class (i.e. imipenem , meropenem and ceftazidime , with equivalent MICs) differ in their propensities to release excessive amounts of LPS from both smooth-(s-) and rough-(r-) LPS laboratory and clinical and antibiotic-sensitive and -resistant P. aeruginosa isolates and that LPS release is independent of cell lysis. Additionally, variations in the induction of endotoxin release is antibiotic concentration dependant and correlate with antibiotic penicillin-binding protein (PBP) affinities which result in morphological changes. These studies also show that LPS differences measured via chromogenic LPS (C-LAL) assay correlate with LPS lethality in LPS-sensitive mice. Release of LPS was compared to changes in CFUs, cell mass, morphology and antibiotic PBP-specificity. Corresponding in-vivo studies in CD1 mice against s-LPS P. aeruginosa isolates show that, despite equivalent in-vitro protection, antibiotic efficacy in mice differ as much as 100-to lO00-fold. To establish a possible in-vivo role for antibiotic-induced release of free LPS we compared antibiotic efficacy results in mice challenged with virulent parent s-LPS and its relatively avirulent r-LPS mutant (lacking only its 0 side chain) P. aeruginosa isolates. Results show the relevance of quantity and physiochemical composition (bioreactivity) of free LPS to virulence and in-vivo antibiotic efficacy. In other in-vivo studies chemical agents that destroy cells (m~) which mediate LPS lethality in-vivo were used to pretreat mice prior to antibiotic therapy and bacterial challenge with wild type Pseudomonas. We conclude that circumstances in which antibiotic-induced filamentation occurs are also conditions that yield excessive LPS release, the in-vivo effects of which are shown through the requirement of larger amounts of antibiotic to afford equivalent protection. Bacterial endotoxins have been reported to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of Gram negative sepsis by their interaction with, and stimulation of, host inflammatory mediator cells to produce cytokines, biologically active lipid intermediates, and procoagulant activity (TFa). Although both microbe-associated and free endotoxin are capable of stimulating mediator production, studies from our laboratory suggest that free endotoxin may be the more potent stimulus for TNF and TFa. Further, our studies suggest that the majority of the proinflammatory activity released from antibiotictreated E. coli coisolates with LPS by two different fractionation techniques.",

Parallel studies with endotoxin hyporesponsive C3H/HeJ mice indicate significantly greater levels of protection with imipenem (> 80 fold vs saline controls).

Even if this therapy was sometimes successful in bacterial infections, it has been largely replaced by antibiotics. However, antibiotics have their limitations, especially in critically-ill patients. To improve outcome, adjunctive therapies such as immunotherapy with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies particularly against endotoxin are again considered. The role of humoral immunity in host defenses against bacterial infections is weU known. For instance, tile importance of antibodies in the defense against gramnegative infections has been established clinically by studies relating the outcome of patients with gram-negative bacteremia to tilers of antibodies directed at the offending pathogens at the onset ofbacteremia (McCabe 1972; Pollack 1979) . Ever since we know the role of endotoxins in the pathophysiology of sepsis, antibodies against the S-and R-LPS have also been detected in sepsis patients. The aim of the administration of IV/G to the sepsis patient is as follows: 1 ) Enhancing of opsonization and phagocytosis(antibactericidaI activity) 2) Synergistic effects with [3-1actam antibiotics 3) Neutralization of endotoxin, the main pathogenic mediator of gram-negative sepsis 4) Modulation and/or inhibition of cytokine release The enhancement of opsonic-and phagocytic-activity especially with IgG via Fc and C3 receptors has been well documented. Monoclonal antiendotoxin antibodies, proven in clinical studies, do not appear to neutralize endotoxin in vitro and are not reproducibly protective in animal models of sepsis. Also they can not suppress endotoxin-induced TNF-~, IL-6 release in mice (Baumgartner 1990, Corriveau and Danner 1993) . In conlrast, recent studies of a polyclonal immunoglobulin preparation, containing high levels of antibodies against gram-negative bacteria and their O-antigen of LPS in IgG, IgM and IgA classes (Pentaglobin\u00ae) provide evidence to neutralize endotoxin. This effect is demonstrated in vitro (Berger 1990 (Berger ,1993 , in animal models (Stephan 1985 , Berger 1993 and also in prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials (Schedel 1991 , Poynton 1992 , Behre 1992 .

Other cells such as human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), smooth muscle cells, and some epithelial cells, which do not express mCD14 but nevertheless respond to LPS in the presence of serum, have receptors for complexes of LPS with the soluble form of CD14 (sCD14). These complexes of LPS with sCD14 are only formed efficiently in the presence of LBP. We have begun to characterise the mechanisms by which LBP enables LPS to bind to CD14, either soluble or membrane bound. With the use of fluorophore and radiolabelled reagents we have developed procedures for quantitative measurement of the association of LPS with LBP and of LPS-LBP complexes with CD14. These results show that the delivery of LPS to sCD14 is catalysed by LBP, i.e., LBP is not included with the LPS-sCD14 complex. In contrast, on the surface of cells, LBP does not dissociate from the cells after LPS binds to mCD14. The kinetics, equilibria and stoichiometry of these reactions will be discussed in the context of models for cellular activation by LPS and cellular uptake of LPS.

Ulmer Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Forschungsinstitut Borstel, D-23845 Borstel Lipid A constitutes the active moiety of endotoxin (LPS) of Gramnegative bacteria. It activates mononuclear phagocytes to produce cytokines, such as TNF, I1_-1, and IL-6, which are the major mediators of the endotoxic effect of LPS in vivo. Lipid A precursor la (synthetic compound 406) does not induce cytokines, but is able to specifically antagonize LPS-or lipid A-induced mediator production in human mononuclear cells, vascular endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, we present evidence for the first time that T-lymphocytes proliferate in response to LPS and express mRNA for interleukin-2 and interferon-~ and that these responses are also antagonized by synthetic lipid A precursor la. When comparing the agonistic and antagonistic activity of lipid A and different partial structures at the functional and binding level, the number and length of the fatty acids and the number of phosphoryl groups were Pound to be of crucial importance. Unexpectedly, lipid A precursor la, although biologically inactive, turned out to be both the most potent antagonist and competitor in inhibiting the binding of LPS. Taken together, our results provide evidence for a model in which lipid A partial structures compete with LPS for specific cell surface receptor(s). In this sense, biologically inactive lipid A analogues may be good candidates as therapeutic agents for the prevention of Gram-negative septic shock. Two mammalian lipid A-binding proteins have been identified that are believed to have important roles in mediating the host response to endotoxin: lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) and bactericidal/ permeability-increasing protein (BPI). Human LBP shares a 45% amino acid sequence identity with human BPI. Despite the sequence homology, the two lipid A-binding proteins have very different functional activities. LBP is an acute phase serum protein that markedly potentiates the proinfiammatory host response to gram-negative infection by a mechanism which involves binding of the LBP-LPS complex to CD14 receptors on monocytes, neutrophils and endothelial cells. In contrast, BPI is a neutrophil granule protein with potent bactericidal and LPS-neutralizing activities. The divergent functional properties of these two LPS-bindlng proteins can be explained by the inability of BPI-LPS complexes to bind to cell-surface CD14 receptors. A recombinant protein (rBPI23), corresponding to the amino terminal 23kD fragment of human BPI, has been shown to retain the potent biological activities of the hdlo protein and may represent a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of gram-negative infections, sepsis and endotoxemia.",

            "text": "For therapeutic effectiveness in many clinical situations, rBPI23 will have to successfully compete with relatively high serum levels of LBP (5-60 ~g/mI) for binding to endotoxin and gram-negative bacteria. To evaluate this issue, experiments were conducted to compare the relative binding affinities of rBPI23 and human recombinant LBP (rLBP) for lipid A. The binding of both proteins to Iipid A was specific and saturable with apparent Kd'S of 2.6 nM for rBPI23 and 58 nM for rLBP. In a competition assay format rBPI23 was approximately 75-fold more potent than rLBP in inhibiting the binding of nSI-rLBP to lipid A. These results demonstrate that rBPI23 has a significantly higher affinity for endotoxin than does rLBP and may explain the potent inhibitory activity of low concentrations of rBPI23 in a variety of in vitro functional assays for LPS activation of cells despite the presence of high LBP levels. For example, rBPI23 at 0.2 ~tg/mi was able to totally inhibit LPS-induced TNF release from monocytes despite a 100-fold weight excess of rLBP over rBPI23. and for heparin binding. Three separate domains which inhibit the LAL reaction to LPS and bind to heparin were identified in amino acid regions 17-45, 65-99 and 142-169 . A single synthetic peptide (85-99) was bactericidal. These results suggest that rBPI23 contains three separate functional domains which may contribute to its high affmity interaction with Gram-negative bacteria and heparin. The individual activity of each domain and the cooperative interaction among domains provide the basis for developing rBPI23 analogues with increased biologic efficacy. A considerable body of experimental data has accumulated implicating tumour necrosis factor (TNF) as a principal mediator of the pathophysiological features of septic shock. These data prompted the development of clinical strategies designed to limit excess (inappropriate) TNF production. Monoclonoal antibodies (Mobs) were developed and a phase II dose escalation trial in 80 patients confirmed that the Mab was safe, and suggested that it was having a beneficial effect on certain parameters. Preliminary results of a large phase III study indicated that (a) the Mob was safe; (b) that it was of no discernible benefit in non-shocked patients; (c) that it reduced mortality in shocked patients, especially during the first 3 days. An alternative strategy was to take advantage of the high binding affinity of soluble receptors for TNF (sTNFR). sTNFR-IgGFc constructs were made for both the p55 and p75 receptors. Both were effective in animal models of LPS challenge, but when a clinical trial was done with the p75 sTNFR-Fc there was unexpected mortality in the treated arm. Using an animal model of live E.coli sepsis, we have shown that this may have been due to the release of bound TNF from the construct. Plasma enhances while BPI inhibits LPS-induced cytokine production from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).",

In contrast to LPS, ETA was a strong inducer of TNF~ which was produced only in marginal amounts by LPS. These results suggest that the septic shock induced by gramnegative bacteria (LPS) and by gram-positive bacteria {extracellular superantigens) follows different pathogenic pathways. LPS-induced shock is mainly mediated by monocytes and monocyte-produced cytokines (IL-I and TNF). The ETA-induced shock is mediated by T-cells or depends on T cell help for the production of monocyte-liberated cytokines. Production of T cell cytokines such as TNF~ and interferon 7 in addition to the other cytokines contribute very likely to the severity of the toxic-shock resulting from S. auzeus and S. pyogenes infections in humans.

The result showed that, in SA group (40 cases), the total effective rate was 87,5%, in the contral group (Combined administration of gentamycin and dexamethasone, 25 cases) the total effective rate was 84%. However the obviously effective rate in SA group 70% was significantly higher than in contral group 44% (P<O.OS). SA group appeared to be more obvious than the contral group in raising arterial pressure, recovering consciousness and pulse, improving cold lilmbs and reducing fever (P<O.O5). It was found that SA could inhibit the pathogeneses changes of septic shock such as the decreases of superotide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) in erythrocytes and the increases of plasma free hemoglobin (PHb), plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) and 13-glucuronidase (13-GC) occured in septic shock. SA had stronger effect than GD in inhibiting the changes mentioned above. Hence, these results suggest that SA has beneficial effect in the treatment of septic shock. SA could diminish the decrease of the antioxdase activities and inhibit lipid peroxidization and stabilize cellmembrance. This may be one of the principal mechanisms of the beneficial effect of SA in the treatment of septic shock.",

From 1982 to 1992 31 patients with septic knee joints have been treated. Treatment in acute cases started with asp#at[on of the effusion to evaluate for cultures. Without awaiting the result treatment was continued with immediate joint irrigation under arthroscopic control. Three redon tubes ( CH 16 ) were introduced for continuous irrigation and for intermittent distention of the joint cavity. In case of chronic joint infection additionally all foreign and synthetic material was removed. Systemic antibiotics were given. Patients could be re -examined with a mean follow-up of 6 years. Re-examination showed that immediate arthroscopic lavage started at the onset of septic sings had best results (less signs of osteoarthr[tis, less synovitis, less pain while loading and less range of motion loss ). 21 patients (80%) out of 26 patients with s tre_=.tsd acute se.~tic knee joint had excellent functional recovery, whereas all 5 patients with chronic septic knee joints showed poor results. Additionally, in 3 of these 5 patients with chronic septic knee joint after irrigation a further procedure was necessary due to recurrent septic knee joint. The concept that bacteria can translocate across the intestinal mucosa under a variety of circumstances is well established. However, due to the inherent limitations of in vivo studies, the cellular mechanisms underlying the process of bacterial translocation (BT) across the epithelial barrier are poorly understood. This is especially true in those circumstances in which there is no merphologic evidence of mucosal injury. Consequently, we have utilized an in vitro cell culture model system to investigate the cellular events involved in the translocation process. In this model system, a polarized monolayer of intestinal cells (Caco-2 cell line) is grown on a 3 micron filter in a two compartment system. After tight junction integrity is established, bacteria are placed in the apical surface chamber and BT across the Caco-2 monolayer is measured by culturing the basal chamber. The results of our studies utilizing the Caco-2 system indicates that; l) Several strains of non-pathogenic bacteria will translocate across the Caco-2 monolayer in a time-dependent and dose-dependent fashion. However, the incidence and magnitude of BT are highest for those strains of bacteria (gram-negative enterics) that are most commonly cultured in vivo.",

            "text": "These in vitro studies suggest that Caco-2 cells can function as \"nonprofessional\" phagocytes and that both bacteria and enterocytes are involved in the translecation phenomenon. Bacterial translocation due to gut barrier dysfunction is considered to be a major cause of septic complications and multiple organ failure following trauma, burn injury, hypoxia, shock and shock-like states. The invasion of bacteria into the circulation from the gastrointestinal tract or even from other sources, however, should not necessarily result in systemic infection or organ cohinisation, as long as the humoral and cellular defense mechanisms are not impaired. Thus, a reduced RES clearance capacity and hepatic clearance function of bacteria and toxins can be observed under the same conditions which enable bacterial translocation from the gut. In order to evaluate the influence of circulatory, metabolic and humorul disorders on the elimination of bacteria out of the blood circulation, a series of experiments were performed in anesthetized and ventilated rabbits which received defined numbers (1.3 x 108 colony-furming units) of Escherichia coli as a bolus injection. In unaffected control animals the intravenously injected bacteria are eliminated about 99.9% within the first 15 minutes and are totaiy cleared within 90 minutes. 57% offue total CFU counted in the cultures of the organ homogenates were found in liver and spleen, whereas only very low numbers could be detected in the lungs and kidneys. Systemic injury of the animals by hemorrhagic shock, endotoxinemia, hypoxia, coagulation disorder, systemic vasoconstriction by norepinephrine and other types of injury reduced the elimination rate of bacteria and changed the pattern and degree of their dissemination and tissue distribution. The bacterial clearance was delayed mostly in rabbits subjected to hypoxemic hypoxia in which about 100 CFU of viable E.eoli per ml blood could still be counted 3 hours following their injection. The number of viable bacteria was some ten powers higher in organs of hypoxic rabbits in comparison to control ardmais, and an excessive colonisation of the lungs and kidneys with 25% respectively 11% of the total CFU of the cultared organ homoganates was observed. Unilateral iscbemia of the kidney prior to the intravenous injection of E.coli only moderately delayed the bacterial clearance, bowever, caused an intense eohinisation of the affected reperfused organ. In contrast to this, inhalation injury did not promote the accumulation of bacteria in the lungs. Conclusion: Shock, systemic and local affections reduce the clearance of bacteria from the blood circulation and enable their dissemination and accumulation in vital organs. The degree of this reduction and the organ pattern of the bacterial distribution varies with the type of injury. Thus, these factors seem to be essentially involved whether or not bacterial translocation and multiple organ failure will follow the invasion of bacteria into the circulation as in the ease of gut barrier dysfunction. Movement of enteric baaterla from gut to extralumeaal sites (bacterial tra~sloeation) m~y play a role ~. nraltipl~ orga~ failure.

HS was induced in rats by bleeding the animals to MAP of 30-35 mmHg 90-180 rain followed by resuscitation. Results and conclusion: In rats, LPS increased in the systemic circulation, plasma TNF levels were found to be significantly elevated at 90 min and were still markedly increased at 150 rain postshock. Plasma TNF, IL-6, and sTNF-R levels increased already during the shock period in baboons, while TNF was not detectable. Our data suggest that haemorrhagic shock may lead to early BT in the intestinal wall (at 30 min following resuscitation in rats subjected to HS for 90 min, similarly at 3 h after the end of oxygen debt period in baboons ) and transient access of gut-derived LPS into the circulation (levels became significant at 120 min, while in baboons higher levels up to 300 pg/ml were found at the end of shock and 1 h after reinfusion, partially accompanied by bacteremia). In addition, since the treatment of rats with anti LPS measures or anti TNF therapy significantly improved the 48-hour survival rate it can be assumed that endogenous LPS and LPS-induced mediator(s), in particular TNF, may lead to organ injury and mortality following haemorrhagic shock. Alteration of the mesenteric blood flow and the consequent ischemia / reperfusion injury to the intestine appear to be one of the earliest events in the systemic inflammatory response following severe thermal injuries. The causative relationship between the subsequent disruption of the intestinal integrity and the potentiation of the translocation of indigenous bacteria and/or endotoxins to remote body organs and the systemic circulation has been deeumented in several studies. Among other effects, endotoxemia solely or acting synergistically with thermal injuries has been shown to promote bacterial translocation. As these sequences continue without adequate intervention, multiple organ failure and eventually death may become inevitable. Hence, the crucial need of treatment modalities with the capacity of modulating the intestinal blood flow and preventing the manifestations of these pathological incidents. Although the underlying mechanisms of this process have not yet been fully elucidated, there is accumulating evidence that various interacting vasomediators are involved. The actions of these mediators can probably be modulated by either nonspecific or selective agents. Among the nonspecific agents, the composition, volume and timing of the resuscitation fluids appear to play an important role in this process. Nitropmsside, a nonspecific vasodilator, has been shown to prevent the decrease of the postbum mesentefic blood flow when selectively infused in the mesenteric artery. The nonspecificity of various vasodialators with their possible undesirable systemic effects emphasizes the importance of the identification and modulation of selective vasomNiiators. Thromboxane A2 (TxA2) and angiotensin II (A-II) appear to be the primary mediators of the postburn vasoconstriction. Both mediators were found to be elevated following thermal injuries. In a previous study, pretreatment with OKY-046, a thromboxane synthetese inhibitor was found to attenuate the postbarn mesenteric vasoconstriction. In a bum/sepsis porcine model the efficacy of DuP753, an A-11 receptor antagonist as a posthum treatment modality was evaluated. Treatment with DuP753 prevented the early posthum and the late posteodotoxin elevation in the mesenteric vascular resistance and subsequently abrogated the fall in the mesenteric blood flow. The incidence of burn & endotoxin induced bacterial translocation was significantly reduced by DuP753 from 86% to 29% (P<0.05, Fisher's exact test). The indigenous flora of the gastrointestinal tract exerts a potent influence on the developmental maturation of normal systemic immunologic responsiveness. Moreover, both oral and intraportal administration of experimental antigen is associated with a systemic state of immunologic hyporesponsiveness, known as oral tolerance. Since trauma and critical illness are associated with changes in the flora of the gut and with altered systemic immune reactivity, we have hypothesized that the interactions of an altered gut flora with immune tissues in the gut and liver play a role in the pathogenesis of the immunologic derangements of critical illness.",

Conversely, measures directed against Gram negative bacterial overgrowth in experimental peritonitis result in partial restoration of impaired DH reactivity. To ascertain the role of the liver in the pathogenesis of these alterations, we studied the differential immunologic sequelae of portal versus systemic (IVC) infusion of killed bacteria. Experimental infusion of live or killed Gram negative organisms into the portal vein produces DH suppression in rive, and profound suppression of mitogen-driven lymphocyte proliferation in vitro; systemic administration of the same organism has no effect on these phenomena. Suppression is TGF3-dependent, and mediated by a soluble factor released by fixed tissue macrophages of the lung and spleen. The suppressive influence appears to be mediated at the level of interactions between IL-2 and its high affinity receptor. Release of this factor can be induced by a second circulating factor present in the plasma of portally-, but not systemically-infused animals two hours after bacterial administration.",

The central question being tested in this study was whether liposome encapsulated dichloromethyLene-diphosphonate (CI2MDP) mediated elimination of liver and splenic maorophages would influence zymosan induced systemic toxicity (ST) and bacterial lranslocation (BT). Materia|s and Methods. 90 male Swiss (ICR) mice were used weighing 21-25 g Elimination of liver and spleen macrophages was accomplished by intravenous injection of 200/11 suspension of CI2MDP-liposome suspension. Control mice received an i.v. injection with 200 pt phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) . Two days later all mice were challenged with an i.p. injection of zymosan suspended in paraffin (Z) at a dosage Of either 01 mg/g, 0.5 mg/g or 1.0 mg/g body weight (n=8 in each group), Signs of ST and bacterial translocation BT were measured 24 hours later The ST was assessed by blindly grading the degree of lethargy, conjunctivitis, diarrhea, and ruffled fur of each mouse on a four point scale. BT to the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and systemic organs (liver, spleen, lung and blood) was tested by culturing on blood and MacConkey's agar At the time of sacrifice sections of the distal ileum were taken for histology. An additional two control groups (n=6 in each group) were tested to verify that neither paraffin nor PBS or CI2MDPqiposome suspension alone induced BT or ST. Furthermore survival over a 12-day period was assessed in a control and macrophage-depleted group with a dose of 1D mg/g Z. Results. Neither the paraffin nor CI2MDP-tiposome suspension induced BT or ST The incidence of bacterial translocation to the MLN was similar between macrophage depleted and control groups. However, macrophage depletion was associated with a significantly higher incidence of systemic spread of bacteria. Data expressed as positive tissues/total tissues tested: 11/32 vs. 1/32 at 0.1 mg/g Zymosan (p~O.01); 19132 vs. 10132 at 05 mg/g Zymosan (p~Q05); 23/32 vs. 11/32 st 1.0 mg/g Zymosan (p~O.O1).The magnitude of BT however did not show any differences. Although systemic BT was greater in the macrophage depleted groups, the systemic toxic response was significantly less at doses of 0.5 mg/g Zymosan (3.14 -+ 0.69 vs. 7.13 -+ 3, p~O.01) and 1.0 mg/g Zymosan (4.38 -+2.50 vs. 11.25 -+ 2.5, p<_.O.01) . The 12 day mortality after 1.0 mg/g Zymosan was 27% in the control group and 0% in the macrophage depleted group (p=O.05). Histology did not show any differences between the control and macrophage depleted groups. Conclusion. The lethal and toxic effects of zymosan in this model appear to be more related to the excessive activation of macrophages than to the systemic spread of bacteria. Bacterial translocation (BT) in hemorrhagic shock was studied using a porcine model. In this study three groups were randomized: one control (n=3) and two experimental (n=6 each). A portal vein catheter was placed and remained in situ 48 hrs. A femoral artery and vein catheter were in place 12 hrs. The arterial eaanula was used for monitoring mean arterial pressure (MAP) in all animals and to bleed the experimental animals and the venous cannula to repelfuse with Ringer's lactate (RL) or autologous blood (AB). Baseline samples and values were taken in this period. Control animals were observed for a sham shock period of 6.5 hrs., given 2 more hours of anesthesia, and studied for further 48 hrs. 40% of the estimated blood volume was withdrawn from each experimental animal over 30 min. These animals were kept in shock for 6.5 hrs. At the end of the shock one group was perfused with RL and the other with AB. Two hours later they were extubated and further studied for 48 hrs. Samples from portal blood for cultures and measurement of Leukotriene B4 (LTB4), Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and nitric oxide (NO) metabolites were taken from all animals at intervals beyond baseline up to 48 hrs. After 48 hrs. under general anesthesia a second laparotomy was performed and samples for culture from mesenteric lymph nodes (MIN), liver and spleen were taken; as well as samples for histologic study with light and scanning electron microscopy were taken from jejunum, ileum, and colon. Animals were then euthanized. RESULTS: significant shock was induced as indicated by MAP and arterial blood gases. Significant BT to MIN was observed in all groups. No significant BT was observed in cultures from liver and spleen in any of the groups. Increased values for LTB4, PGE2 and NO metabolites were found during the period of shock. These results suggest that the isehemic phenomenon triggers a significant inflammatory response, and that BT to MIN may be an epiphenomenon without apparent significant influence on the inflammatory response. Objective: To study the potential effects and mechanisms of action of systemic administration of monoclonal antibodies anti-endotoxin (HA-1A) in a animal model of gut-origin sepsis. Materials and Methods: Exoeriment A. BALB/c mice were transfused with allogeneic blood (from C3HB-IeJ mice). Five days post-transfusion the animals were gavaged with lxl09 viable Escherichia coil and randomized into 3 groups (n=22/group) to receive a sham burn (SB group) or a 20% thermal injury immediately followed by the systemic administration, via a tail vein, of monoclonal antibodies (6 mg/kg) (HA-1A group) or a 20% burn injury and administration of equal volume of sterile saline (C group). All 3 groups were resuscitated by intraperitoneal injection of 0.3 ml of saline. The animal survival rate was observed for 10 days post-burn. Experiment B, Transfusion and burn procedures were identical to experiment A but the mice (n=8/group) were gavaged with 109 viable E.coli labeled with mMndium oxine. Four hours after burn the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), liver, lungs and blood were harvested to determine plasma endotoxin levels and the magnitude of transtocation of labeled bacteria as measured by the residual radioactivity (dpm) in the organs. Circulating endotoxin levels were determined by limulus colorimetric assay. Diamine 0xidae(DAO) is an enzyme existing in the mucosa of small intestines, but its activity is low in the plasma. It is evoked in the blood with the intravenous injection of much heparin.",

            "text": "PURPOSE: Disturbances of intestinal permeability have been advocated as a pathogenetic factor of posttranmatic multisystem organ failure (MOF). A close relationship with impairment of the stationary reticulocndothelial system (RES) and a systemic inflammatory response (SIR) was discussed. These tactors were investigated prospectively in patients with multiple trauma showing posttraumatie complications (multiple organ failure, MOF). METHODS: 31 polytranmatized patients were studied prospectively. According to a MOF-score (GORIS) those with posttrattmatic complications were selected (>7 points at 2 days), others were excluded. Every second day gut permeability according to the ratio of urine concentrations of lactulose and mannitol (L/M) was evaluated (enteral application). At parallel time points RES clearance capacity (K-value, invasion constant, normal range 0.6 -0.8 mind) was studied after i.v. injection of 100 mBq 99roTehuman albumin. Liver perfusion was calculated from these data, total serum bilirubin (/zmol/l) was documented. Serum elastase (#g/l) levels were determined enzymatieally. RESULTS 86.0 148+ 239+ Liver perfusion did not ehangu, bilirubin showed progressive worsening indicating MOF. A positive correlation was present between L/m and K (r=0.88) and between L/m and Ela (r=0.71). CONCLUSIONS: There is a positive correlation between the time pattern of intestinal permeability dysfunction and RES hyperactivity as well as between intestinal permeability and the systemic intlammatory response (elastase levels). The results speak in favor of an interaction between intestinal and extraintestinal inflammatory systems, which in eombiuation are likely to be responsible for post~anmafic complications. Endotoxemia, IL-6 release and consecutive acute phase reaction are observed as a host response to surgical trauma. As well vasodilative prostaglandins (PG) and thromboxane (TX) are released after abdominal meaenteric traction (MT). The following hypotension and acute hypoxeraJa are duo to prostacyelin (PGIz) arm can be avoided by perioperative cyclooxygenase inhibition. We therefore focused on the effect of PG and TX liberated following MT on the induction of endotoxemia. METHODS: In a prospective, randomized double-blinded protocol 50 patients, who were scheduled for major abdominal surgery (pancreatic or infrarenal abdominal surgery), were studied. Ibuprofen (400 mg i.v.) or a placebo equivalent was administered 15 minutes before skin incision. MT was applied in a uniform fashion. Baseline values were obtained before induction of anesthesia. Further measurements followed before the incision of the peri[onenm (tl) and 5, 30, 90, 180 min, . The plasma concentrations (,pc) of 6-keto-PGFt,, TXB: and-KI-12-PGF ~ (stable metabolites of PGI2, TXA2 and PGE~) were determined by RIA. We measured Endotoxin pc by Limulus-amoebocyte-lysate test and IL-6 levels by ELISA. Data are given as mean+SEM (* p< 0.05 placebo vs. [ibuprofen] ). RESULTS: Endotoxin plasma levels increased before incision of the peritoneum tl both in the ibuprofen pretreated and in the placebo group. Peak pc were observed 180 minutes after MT. Endotoxin pc were significantly higher in the ibuprufen treated group (t5 0.16+0.02e[0.32+0.06] EU/ml). IL-6 pc demonstrated an increase continuously from t4 to t7 (t7 115+12 [91 + 15] ng/l) in both groups. After intentional abdominal mesenteric traction we observed a marked increase of 6-keto-PGF~,, pc up to 6h after MT in untreated patients with a peak of 2450*[60] ng/1 at tl. Also TXB: and KH2PGE 2 pc showed a considerabe increase up to 6h after MT in the placebo group. In ibuprofen pretreated patients the PG and TX pc remained within the normal range. DISCUSSION: Our data clearly indicate a significant endotoxemia and IL-6 release following major surgical trauma which is not initiated either by prostaglandin or thromboxane release. Moreover endotoxemia is accentuated by ibuprofen pretreatment. Therefore we hypothesize that in major abdominal surgery prostacyclin release-after MT may play a crucial physiological role in maintaining splanclmic microcirculation and thus preserving gut mucosal barrier function. Objectives of the study It has been shown recently that parenteral and certain euteral diets promote the translocation of gut flora to the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and systemic organs, a process termed bacterial translocation (BT). In chow fed rats BT usually does not occur without further promoting factors. The goals of the present study were to determine whether the provision of defined amounts of standard lab chow during IV-TPN administration wotfld redane the incidence of BT, Materials und methods Male SPF Spragnle-Dawley rats were divided into 6 groups. Group 1 received standard laboratory chow feeding ad lib. In group 2 a central venous catheter was placed, ligated and secured by a spring coil tether attached to a swivel allowing free movement in the housing cage and chow was fed ad lib. In group 3 50% of the calculated daily required calory intake (DRCI) (307/Kcal/kg) was given by IV-TPN (28% glucose, 4,25% amino acids) and 50% by limited chow administration. Groups 4 and 5 received 70% and 90% of the DRCI by i.v. TPN and 30% and 10% respectively by chow feeding. Group 6 received IV-TPN only. After 7 days the rats were sacrificed and the MLN, liver, spleen and cecum removed aseptically, homogenized and cultured for BT Samples of distal ileum were taken for light microscopy. The group with the least amount of chow shown to be protective against BT received the amount of non-fermentable fiber of that chow regimen during IV-TPN feeding and BT was studied. 4 5,5+0,9 4 12 23,9 -2,3 16 ,7 2/12 63+11 125~1 \"7,7-+0,7 6,7-+1 5 12 24~6 -3,5 67 8/12 241+~243 170+163 8_+0,7 7+1,1 6 18 25, 5 -4 88,8 16118 2061-+3224 2211+4015 8,4~0,7 8,1-+1~1 Conclusions: The administration of 30% of DRCI by chow feeding during IV-TPN significantly reduced the incidence of BT and maintained gut barrier function. The addition of the respective amount of dietary fiber of this group did not prevent IV-TPN-indueed BT. Dr. med. M Naruhn., Dep. of General Surgery, Eberhard-Karls-University, Hoppe-Seyler-Str. 3 Previous experimental studies have suggested that a disturbed ecology of the enteric bacterial population might contribute to the development of bacterial translocation from the gut in acute liver failure (ALF). In the present study, the effect of oral administration of Lactobacillus reuteri R2LC and oat fiber on bacterial overgrowth and translocation was investigated in rats with acute liver failure induced by subtotal (90 %) liver resection.",

Twenty-one of 32 patients showed a significant increase of endotoxin plasma levels during colonoscopy (p=0.003), whereas only one patient had a positive blood culture with bacteria obviously derived from the gastro-intestinal tract. The ENC decreased significantly five minutes after the beginning of eolonoscopy and was diminished further thereafter. The baseline values were reached after 24 hours. ~hromboxane B o levels also increased after five min. from 89 to 376 pgYml peaking at 30 min. with 1332 pg/ml. 6-Keto-prostaglandin,leucotriene C 4, Ii-6 and CRP remained unchanged. A control group of i0 volunteers who were not subjected to endoscopy, were prepared for eolonoscopy by orthograde lavage. The blood sampling procedure remained identical. No differences were seen in all described parameters for the controls. These data show that the gut barrier can be compromised by mininml invasive procedures, at least, concerning bacterial products. Living bacteria, on the contrary, do not pass the gastro-intestinal wall. Endotoxin, when determined by ENC, is more sensitive than the conventional limulus-amebocyte-lysate test. No acute-phase reaction was induceri by the observed endotoxin translocation. It can be speculated from the dramatically enhanced thromboxane B 2 levels, together with its hemodynamie effects, that the thromboxane release may support translocation of bacterial products. Sepsis is common after hemorrhagic shock. This study aims to demonstrate that hemorrhagic shock alone can promote translocation of gut bacteria from intestinal tract to its regional nodes and subsequently to blood. One hundred twenty mice, divided into 4 groups were subjected to 30, 60 and 120 minutes of 20%, 30% and 40% of hemorrhagic shock.

In our earlier studies we have investigated the dynamics of granuloayte infiltration of the ischemic/reperfused s~all intestine (G. Illy~s, J. Hamar Int. J. Exp. 9athol. 73. 161. 1992.) . There was a increasing infiltration of the mucosa c111m~nating at the 3d to 4th hours of reperfusion. In the present series we have studied sc~e of the conseqn/ences and the possible role of this cellular reaction. 45 ~in isehemia was followed by a 4 hour reperfusion in the anesthetized rat. Arterial ~/ad mesenteric venous blood samples were collected at 5 m_in, I, 2~ 3, and 4 hours of reperfusion. Elastase and lactate concentrations were determined and hamoculture was carried out from the blood samples, and tissue pieces from the heart, lung, liver and kidney were collected for histological analyses at the above mentioned times of reperfusion. All blood samples were free of Cell bacteria. Staphylococci appeared only occasionally at the 4th hour in the arterial blood .and at the 3d and 4th hours in the venous blood, respectively. Arterial and venous elastase activities were high throughout the reperfusion, venous concentrations being higher at all times. Lactate concentrations of the arterial and mesenteric venous blood samples increased during shock. ~ranuloeyte infiltration of all organs studied appeared during the 2d hour and it increased at later times of reperfusion. It is concluded that heavy infiltration of the intestinal mucosa can block bacterial translocation in most of the cases during reperfusion. Granulocytes activated either by the reperfused area or by the released cytokines infiltrate other organs contributing by this way to the mesenteric shock s!rndrc~e. Intestinal motility plays an important role for maintaining nutrient transport and absorption and for balancing the enteric bacterial population. Disturbances of intestinal motility may be one of the earliest notable changes in intestinal function. In the present study, we aimed at determining early alterations in intestinal transit time following ischemia-reperfusion injury induced by occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery in the rat.",

Moreover, NF-~:B was shown to be activated upon treatment of cell cultures with p.M-amounts of hydrogen peroxide. These data suggested that NF-~B prinicipaliy is an oxidative stress-responsive transcnption factor. The notion is supported by numerous reports on the induction of oxidative stress by many NF-nB-inducing agents. NF-~B activition can likewise be suppressed by protease inhibitors. These drugs apparently inhibit a yet unidentified protease responsible for the inducible decay of InB. We propose to use NF-nB inhibifors as novel drugs with a very broad application under acute phases el inflammation, injury and infection. Northern Blot experiments revealed that expression of the recently discovered Lipopolysaccharide Binding Protein (LBP), a 58/60 kD Glycoprotein, in the liver rises substantially during the acute phase response. Experiments with an in-vivo acute phase model using New-Zealand-White rabbits and also in-vitro experiments employing stimulated Hep-G2 cells showed that LBP transcripts could be induced 10 to 100 ford within 24 hours after induction with cytokines. By using a newly established nonradioactive nuclear run-on technique we show that induction of LBP during the acute phase is transcriptionally regulated. Furthermore we screened a human genomic library and were able to clone the LBP gone, containing the promoter 1.5 kB upstream. Several liver-specific and \"acute-phase-typical\" potential binding sites were found fn the promoter region and reporter gone assays were set up. Several CAAT-boxes, the IL-6 responsive elements HSTF-hsp 70.5 and H-APF-1 RS as well as the transcription factor HNF-5 and the glucocrticoid-responsive elements Oct-2-D and GCRE were found, which correlates with the induction pattern of LBP mRNA in Hep-G2 cells by IL-6, IL-1 and Dexamethasone. PCR-based analysis of the exon-intron pattern of the LBP gene revealed similarities with the genes of two other LPS binding proteins, namely BPI and CETP. Further analysis of this novel acute phase protein, that also has an important role in Endotoxin recognition and immunomodulation will help in understanding the complex acute phase mechanism and potentially lead the way to new therapeutic strategies.",

Savedra, S. Vogel and M. J. Fenton Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the major constituent of the outer leaflet of Gram-negative bacteria. During the course of serious infection, shock may occur as a result of the interaction of LPS with macrophage LPS receptors. CD14, a 55 kDa glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked protein, functions as an LPS receptor. A critical issue in LPS activation concerns the mechanism by which CD14, which has no transmernbrane domain, transduces a sig,nal after LPS binding. Evidence exists which suggests that CD14 may signal cells after LPS binding by interacting with an LPS signal transducer with tyrosine kinase (TK) activity.",

Stimulation of CHO/CDI4 with as little as 1 ng of LPS/ml resulted in the release of 3H-arachidonic acid (3H-20:4) into the culture supernatant. In addition to 3H-20:4 release, we examined LPS-imiuced activation (transl0cation) of the transcription factor NF-~B. Similar to LPS-induced 3H-20:4 release, these responses were observed only in CHO cells lransfected with CD14 closely resembling the same response in the marine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. Maximum NF-~cB expression occurred at 30 minutes. In contrast to LPS-induced 3H-20:4 release, dexamethasone, cycloheximide, and actinomycin D had no effect on activation of NF-r,.B in CHO/CD14, suggesting that NF-r,B activation begins early after LPS binding to CD14 and does not require transcription or translation.

The absence of observable LPS-induced phosphotyrosine residues in CHO/CD14 cells as well as the failure of TK antagonists to inhibit LPS-induced NF-~cB activation suggest that the proposed CD14-related LPS signal transducer in CHO/CD14 is not a tymsine ldnase. Dimished cardiac inotropic function and response to 13-adrenergic receptor (13-AR) stimulation are frequently seen in septic patients, These cardiac defects are also seen in animal models of entoxemia. To determine the characteristics of the decreased transmembrane signal associated with the decreased beta adrenergic response we measured the force and rate of contraction of atria harvested from Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to endotoxin (0:2 gm/kg). To stimulate various components of the transmembrane signal cascade of 15-AR was isoproterenol (I3-AR), acetylcholine (M2ACH receptor), NaF(Gs and Gi proteins), forskolin (adenylate cyclase), and calcium (intracellular contracttile signal) were used. To eliminate the transmembrane control of calcium and test the intrinsic contractile response, hypothermia (22\u00b0C) was used The results showed alterations in the inotropic function with no significant difference in chronotropic response. The inotropic reponse for the endotoxin exposed atria and controls is shown below These results show that there is a transmembrane signal defect both for the I~-AR signal and for Ca +. These data indicate that the level of the defect appears to be at the G proteins. Ischemia-reperfusion of the rat intestine produces an injmry both to the intestine and to distal organs, notably the lungs and liver. Prior studies have shown that 1 h of intestinal ischemia leads to a nemtrophil independent reperfusion injury of the gut. Thus, rats rendered neutropenic by Pl~l antiserum have been shown to express a severe local gut injury when subjected to ischemia and reperfusion. This gut injury is postulated to he mediated at least in part by the complement system. The soluble (s) CRI receptor which binds to C3b and Cdb was given to rats at a dose of 12 mg/kg by intravenous bolus, 15 min before reperfusion of the ischemic gut. A control group was given PBS buffer. At 4 h of rmperfmsion the animals were sacrificed. PBS treatment led to a significant activation of both classical and alternate complement pathways while sCRI inhibited both pathways (fall to zero of CHbo ). Intestinal mucosal injury score, assessed by histological grading was reduced by sCRI (2.49\u00b10.22 to 1.73_+0.17,p<0.05) . Intestinal neutrophil sequestration estimated by assay of myeleperoxidase was also reduced (0.05 \u00b1 0.01 to 0.02 \u00b1 0.01 U/g). C3 was detected in the gut hy i~unohistochemistry. Remote organ injury was modified that is lung permeability (ration of concentration of radiolabelled albumin in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid to that in blood) was reduced (11.3\u00b11.4 x i0 3 to 3.9\u00b10.8 x 103, p<O.05). However, neutrophil sequestration by the lungs was unaffected. This remote protection is thougth to be related to prevention of iC3b deposition on Imng andotheli~ which activates adherent neutrophils. These findings support the hypothesis of complement mediated local and remote injury. We postulate that complement fragments may be deposited either as a result of the ischemia induced loss of membrane bound complement regulatory proteins, such as decay accelerating factor or membrane cofactor protein, which allow complement fragments to accumulate on the endothelial cell surface. Alternatively, increased expression of P-selectin on the endothelial cell surface may, by means of its complement binding domains, act as a lattice for complement deposition. Indeed, P-selectin has been detected on the surface of endothelial cells ans platelet-neutrophil aggregates recovered from the intestine of these animals. Ischemia (4hr) followed by reperfusion (dhr) of rat hind limbs resuits in local (muscle) injury as well as in remote (lung) injury, which is characterized by increased vascular permeability (leakage of J2Sl labeled albumin) and neutrophil accumulation (tissue content of myeloperoxidase, MPO). Within 60 minutes of reperfusion following ischemia, tumor necrosis factor-o~ (TNFc 0, interleukin-I (1L-I) and IL-6 plasma levels increased significantly, reaching maximum levels after 2 hours ofreperfusion. Polyclonal antibodies to TNFet and 1L-I provided significant protection against muscle and lung injury. Muscle and lung vascular permeability decreased in anti-TNFct treated rats by 41% and 74% respectively and MPO was reduced by 72% and 83%. AntML-1 yielded a protection in muscle and lung vascular permeability of 24.7\u00b0,4 and 52.4% respectively whereas muscle MPO was reduced by 46.4% and lung MPO by 25.9\u00b0,4. These results were confirmed by the use of soluble TNF~ receptor and IL-I receptor antagonist (IL-IRa). When ICAM-I expression in vivo was examined using 125Mabeled antMCAM-I, constititive expression of ICAM-1 was evident only in lung but not in muscle. During reperfusion ICAM-1 expression increased by 98.2%. Treatment with anti-TNFcx or IL-IRa reduced ICAM-I upregulation by 73.9\u00b0,4 and 74.8% respectively. Frozen sections of normal rat lung revealed no evidence of E-selectin expression, whereas lung sections obtained after ischemia and reperfusion immunhistochemically demonstrated expression of E-sdectin. Lungs from rats pretreated with anti-TNFct were negative for E-selectin staining. Our data indicate a role for cytokines in the upregulation of adhesion molecules in ischemia/reperfusion injury.",

            "text": "Adherence of neutrophils to the coronary endothelium is associated with significant myocardial injury following 90 min of ischemia (MI) and 4.5 h of reperfusion (R). P-selectin is expressed by activated endothelial ceils and platelets within 10 min and tethers polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) to the endothelium. We examined the cardioprotective effects of a monoclonal antibody (MAb) designated PB1.3 to P-selectin in a feline model of MI+R. PB 1.3 (1 mg/kg) administered 80 rain post-occlusion (10 min prior to reperfusion) significantly attenuated myocardial necrosis compared to a non-blocking MAb (NBP1.6) for P-selectin (15 + 3 vs 33 + 5% of area-at-risk, p<0.01). Endothelial dependent relaxation to acetylcholine was also significantly preserved in ischemic-reperfused coronary arteries isolated from cats treated with PB 1.3 compared to NBP1.6 (67 + 6 vs 11 + 3, p<0.01). Furthermore, PMN adherence to ischemic-reperfused coronary endothelium was significantly attenuated in PB1.3 treated cats (64 + 7 vs 136 + 12 PMNs/mm z, p<0.01). Also, normal coronary endothelium activated with thrombin (2 U/mt) had increased PMN adherence under conditions of shear stress, an effect which was significantly (p<0.01) blocked by PB1.3, but not by NBP1.6. Furthermore, P-selectin is markedly upregulated 10-20 min post-reperfusion in coronary arterial and venous endothelinm. Similar results were obtained in a rat model of mesenteric ischemia/reperfusion, including upregulation of P-selectin on mesenteric vascular endothelium. These results demonstrate that tethering of neutrophils to endethelium by P-selectin is an important early consequence of reperfusien injury, and a specific monoclonal antibody to P-selectin exerts significant endothelial preservation and cardioprotection in ischemia and reperfusion states. As recent interest has increased in the role of extracellular matrix proteins in inflammation, we examined the role and relationship of laminin and fibronectin to the processes of cell infiltration in a rat model of heart isografts. Changes occurring in this system are on a nonimmunological basis and may be an effect of the initial surgical manipulation and the warm and cold ischemic times of transplantation. Lewis (LEW) donor hearts were transplanted into LEW recipients, naive LEW acted as naive controls (NC). Grafts were harvested 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 48, 72, 120 and 168h after transplantation (n=6/time point) . Snap frozen sections of organs were stained for CD-4 (W3/25), CD-8 (OX8), T-lymphecytes (TL) (OX-19), macrophages (ED1, ED2), neutrophils (PMN) (MOM), ICAM-I (IAP29), laminin and fibrinogen. Results were evaluated visually by counting cells/field of view (CF) for W3/25, OX8, OX19, ED1, ED2 and MOM, staining for ICAM1, Lain and Fib was assessed visually using a scale (VE=0-10). As early as 2h after transplantation, fibrinogen and laminin expression increased in I, peaking 8h after transplantation (VE= 4.5; NC: VE=I.5) . At 16 and 24h in I, on both vessels and interstitial cells laminin and fibrinogen expression had declined to baseline (VE=I.5) but rose again at 48h, peaking at 72h (VE=4) and remaining elevated thereafter (VE=3). The high expression at 8h correlated well with the maximal PMN infiltration at that time (CF=6) in I returning to baseline at 24h (CF=0.5) and thereafter. The second peak at 72h correlated with the onset of macrophage and T-lymphocyte infiltration. Thus, laminin and fibrinogen seem to guide leucocyte infiltration following graft ischemia during the time of reperfusion. Background. Reperfusion of ischemic kidneys with xenogeneic blood leads to activation of endothelial cells and circulating leucocytes with the final consequence of microvascular thrombosis. In concordant systems, the mechanisms of rejection can be studied due to cross-reactivity of mediators with anti-human monoclona~ antibodies. Aim of the study. To obtain information about the kinetics of proinflammatory cytokines and production of soluble adhesion molecules in the acute phase of reperfusion, eight kidneys from rhesus monkeys were perfused ex-vivo with human blood (group B/O) for one hour in a closed system. Blood levels of IL-lb, IL-6, TNF-a, soluble ICAM and E-Selectin were measured in ELISA-technique under steady-state conditions. Results. Cytokine levels rose significantly within the 60minute interval (IL-lb: 6,1__+2,6 to 161,1__+98,5 pg/ml; IL-6:30.24-7,7 to 274,2__+75,8 pg/ml; TNF-a: 544,2__+363,6 to 1651,0+25,7 pg/ml; p<0.05). Immediately after the beginning of reperfusion, soluble ICAM-1 and Selectin levels were abnormally high and constantly rising throughout the observation period, reaching significance at 60 minutes. Discussion. High levels of proinflammatory cytokines may lead to an induction of adhesion molecules, thus upregulating the leukocyte-endothelial interaction in an complement-independent mechanism. Specific pretreatment with monoclonal antibodies against ICAM-1, LFA-1 or other soluble mediators may be useful in downregulating hyperacute rejection in transspecies transplantation. Prolonged ischemia has been associated with later dysfunction of solid organs as it may cause upregulation of adhesion molecules, production of cytokines on vascular endothelium and migration of host cells into the graft. These early events may lead to irreversible organ injury. This study evaluates the effects of global ischemia on early immunohistological changes in cardiac grafts transplanted in rats. Isografted hearts (Lewis->Lewis) were were divided into ischemic and non-ischemic groups (n=30/group). All donor hearts were flushed immediately with cold saline. Non-ischemic hearts were then transplanted within 30 rain, ischemic hearts were stored in cold Ringer's solution for 3 hours before revascularization. Representative grafts were removed after 12. 24, 72hrs, 10 and 100 days, and evaluated immunohistologically (cells/field of view=C/F). Restitution of ventricular activity was significantly delayed in ischemic grafts (5 vs 1 rain). After 12 hrs, all ischemic grafts exhibited an extensive interstitial edema, declining slowly thereafter. At the same time, numbers of PMN peaked (3 vs 1 C/F in non-ischemic grafts), whereas EDl+macrophages (9 vs 2 C/F) and TNFe expression peaked by 24hrs. By 72 hrs T-lymphocytes began to enter ischemic myocardium and ICAM-1 was moderately increased. After 10 days cellular infiltration had returned to baseline, and no differences were seen among both groups after 100 days. Global myocardial ischemia inhibits initial graft function, and engenders a brisk inflammatory reponse, primarily PMN and macrophages, with increased MHC Class II and cytokine expression.",

The migration of leukocytes to the lung during endotoxemia is dependent upon the coordinated expression of lung vascular adhesion molecules and the subsequent production of appropriate leukocyte chemotactic proteins. In experimental animals, neutrophils accumulate within the lung soon after the administration of endotoxin, while mononuclear cell infiltration occurs in a more distal manner. A kinetic analysis of lung leukocyte levels revealed a 3-fold increase in neutrophil numbers associated with dispersed lullg tissues 2 hours after LPS treatment, while macrophage levels increased by 4-fold at the 24 hour time point. Thus, the recruitment of different leukocyte populations to the lungs during endotoxemia is likely directed by different mechanisms. Recent studies have identified a supergene family of small inducible chemotactic cytokines (chemukines) which possesses chemotactic and activating properties for neutrophils. The prototype of this family is interleukin-8 (IL-8). Interestingly, a related supergene family has been identified which possesses activity for recruiting mononuclear cells. Examples of this group of inflammatory chemukines are monocyte chemotactic protein-i (MCP-I) and macrophage inflammatory protein-i alpha (MIP-I). In initial in viva studies we examined whether MIP-I was expressed systemically or in a compartmentalized fashion post LPS challenge. Assessment of plasma cytokine levels revealed maximal TNF levels occurred I hour post LPS administration, returning to baseline by 4 hours, while MIP-I levels were maximal at 2 hours (2,5 ng/ml), with a second peak at 24 hours after LPS challenge. Interestingly, aqueous extracts of liver homogenates from LPS treated animals demonstrated no MIP-I levels, while aqueous extracts of lung revealed a 4-fold increase in MIP-I levels over control lungs. Immunohistochemical analysis of the lungs from 24 hour LPS treated animals demonstrated the alveolar macrophage was a rich source of MIP-I protein. Cell-associated MIP-I was also expressed by blood monocytes adherent to the pulmonary vascular endotheliun, however the expression of monocyte-MIP-i was observed by 2 hours post LPS administration. Immunohistochemical analysis also demonstrated that MIP-I antigen is associated with the extracellular matrix on the interstitial side of the endothelium. This suggests that the extracellular matrix, which is produced during inflammation, can bind MIP-I and this may serve as a depot for the prolonged presence of NIP-1.",

Thereby PMNL are proposed to avidly adhere to vascular endothelium causing damage by the subsequent release of toxic agents. As cellular adhesion is primarily mediated by 62-integrins and Lselectins, the present study compares the expression of these adhesionmolecules on PMNL in septic patients and healthy volunteers. Methods: Expression of 62-integrins and L-selectins on PMNL was measured in whole blood by flow cytometry using the monoclonal antibodies IB4 and Dreg 200, Baseline values were determined immediatley after drawing blood. In addition cells were incubated 45 min at 37\u00b0C to allow for spontaneous regulation of adhesion molecules. 55 blood specimens from 8 septic patients were obtained during the course of their illness. Control values were determined in 12 healthy volunteers. Results: Baseline expression of 62-integrins and L-selectins was not signifcantly different in septic and in healthy subjects. In contrast, there was a significant upregulation of g2-integrins and shedding of L-selectins of PMNL in septic patients (SP) compared to healthy volunteers (HV). The local or systemic production of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFc~), can serve to modulate multiple aspects of neutrophil function. The ability of neutrophils to leave the circulation and migrate to areas of infection is one essential component of host defense. L-selectin, a leucocyte-associated adhesion molecule, is responsible for the initial reversible contact between neutrophils and endothelium and the subsequent roiling action of neutrophils along the vessel wall. In contrast to other adhesion molecules, L-selectin expression is rapidly down-regulated after neutrophil activation. The loss of L-seleclin may thus be a critical determinant of how neutrophils become unbound from their endothelial attachments and enabled to proceed towards an underlying extravascular area of infection. We hypothesize that the shedding of L-selectin is a strictly controlled process, occurring primarily at localized sites of inflammation, which may be modulated by TNF~, A flow cytometric method of staining neutrophHs by monoclonal antibodies in whole blood is described whereby the kinetics of L-selectin shedding may be followed in real time. The dose response and time course of in-vitro L-selectin shedding by neutrophils from normal human subjects was assayed after exposure to N-formyl-methionylleucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) and TNFc~. either singly or in combination, Our results show that L-selectin shedding can be reliably followed over time. A significant percentage of cells shed L-selectin after exposure to 2000 pg/ml TNFc~ or 1000nM FMLP (but not at 400pg/ml TNFc~ or 200nM FMLP). Greater numbers of cells were able to shed their L-selectin when FMLP and TNF~x were presented in combination rather than alone. High levels of TNFc~ did not appear to alter the threshold concentration of FMLP required to induce shedding, We conclude that the extent and rapidity of L-selectin shedding may be modified by different combinations of ligands and that shedding, by vidue of the high concentrations of cytokines or chemotactic factors required, is a process localized to sites of infection or inflammation. We prospectively studied 23 patients with severe sepsis syndrome; Group A : Septic shock with or without Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome lARDS) (n =7, bacteremia = 6); Group B : Sepsis syndrome without septic shock (n = 16, bacteremia = 9). Serial plasma samples obtained on day 0, 1, 3, 6, 10 and 14, were assayed using ELISAs method (British Biotechnology), Normal control levels of soluble ICAM-1 and E-Selectin, obtained from 11 healthy volunteers, were respectively 205 \u00b1 19.4 ng/ml and 45 \u00b1 5.7 ng/ml (mean _+ SE), Acute lung injury was quantified dally on a tour-point score system (Murray, Am Rev Respir Dis,1989) . Compared to control mean values, initial levels of groups A and B were significantly higher for ICAM-1 (p < 10 -4) and E-Selectin (p < 10-3). Comparisons of group A and [] (* = p<0.05; ** = p<0.00t) Soluble ICAM-1 levels of group A enhanced significantly (p<0.05) during the first 24 hours, and a sustained high levels was of bad prognosis (25% of survivors at day 6). The evolution of soluble ICAM-1 and E-Selectin levels were significantly correlated with Murray's score (Spearman test : p <0.001). Conclusion: These results suggest that endothelial adhesion molecules are released into the plasma of patients with severe sepsis syndrome. Soluble ICAM-1 and E-Selectin are correlated with endothelial lung damage, and lOAM-1 seems to be a better indicator of the severity of endothelial injury. ",

The development of antimicrobial therapy represented a major breakthrough in the struggle against disease. It strengthened the notion that disease could be overcome by eliminating foreign invaders threatening the host. This paradigm has proven to be very successful, the threat of many infectious diseases has significantly changed, some have even been eradicated. Nevertheless, sepsis has remained a severe condition, increasing in incidence while mortality remained very high. More recently, it has become increasingly clear that besides the nature and treatment of an exogenous agent, the reaction of the host defense itself plays a pivotal role in the outcome of the event. Endogenous mediators, such as TNF, IL-I, IL-6 and IL-8, govem many of the actions of the host defense system. While the expression of these cytokines more often than not benefit the host, (over)-expression can cause severe damage. Based on this hypothesis,anticytokine strategies, such as those targeted against TNF or IL-1, have been evaluated for the treatment of sepsis. Results of these early studies have not yet indicated success in improving the outcome of the disease. It has been difficult to define a patient population where a benefit could be reproducibly shown. Furthermore, it has been documented that synergy between cytokines occurs, but detailed knowledge of the cytokine network is not yet available. It is conceivable, that neutralization of one cytokine prompts the induction of another which will evoke the intended response in the host. Recent data obtained in human endotoxemic volunteer models seem to confirm this. If this turns out to be the case, neutralizing a single cytokine may not be a successful approach. Cytokines in tum, induce various adhesion molecules, such as ICAM-1. Such molecules regulate for instance the neutrophil-endothelial cell interactions, which are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of systemic organ injury. The potential for monoclonal antibodies to adhesion proteins to reduce vascular and tissue damage has been studied in a large number of experimental models. Protective effects have been observed in a wide variety of inflammatory, immune, and ischemia-reperfusion injuries. Thus, altering the host response by modulating the function of adhesion molecules may attenuate the inadvertent injury caused by inappropriate behavior of host defense cells. Targeting cellular surface interactions has been added to the efforts to change the outcome of disease. Modulation oftheseprocesses seems very promising, but may temporarily leave the host without effective defense mechanism. Great care therefore, must be exerted when studying this powerful two-edged sword in a clinical setting. Our knowledge of the role of adhesion molecules in the intlammatory response has increased rapidly due to the availability of new reagents and mice geneticly deficient in adhesion molecules. These molecules are important in interactions of leukocytes with endothelial cells, other leukocytes, platelets, and epithelial cells. When these molecules are engaged, they can also play a role in activating leukocytes and their effector functions. In the venules of the systemic circulation, adhesion often occurs through a series of sequential interactions. Initial interactions are mediated by members of the selectin family to loosely associate the leukocytes with the endothelium and are followed by firm adhesion requiring members of the integrin and immunoglobulin family. Later interactions with endothelium may require PECAM. Adhesion molecules are usually required for leukocyte emigration in response to extravascular stimuli and for neutrophil-mediated endothelial cell injury. They are critical for host response in many diseases including infections. However, when the inflammatory response results in damage to host tissues, patients may benefit from blocking the leukocyte response. Anti-adhesion molecule agents are an important potential antiinflammatory therapy. The focus of anti-adhesion therapy may be at any step of the sequence. Diseases where anti-adhesion molecule therapy may benefit patients include ischemia/reperfusion injury in many organs, ARDS and MOF, and transplantation, both to protect the donor organ from ischemia/reperfusion injury and to inhibit graft vs host disease. Many strategies have been considered and include: 1) blocking the ability of adhesion molecules to recognize their ligand using antibodies that have been humanized or soluble receptors linked to IgG to prolong their circulating halflife, 2) blocking the ligands for adhesion molecules using soluble adhesion molecules, peptide analogues, or oligosaccharides, and 3) blocking the production of the adhesion molecule using anti-sense oligonucleotides. Because the synthesis of adhesion molecules is usually regulated by cytokines, inhibiting the action of cytokines is another potential site for interrupting the adhesion process. Although important issues of safety must be evaluated, the potential for modulating the inflammatory response make this an exciting area of improvement in health care delivery. Claire M.

The central role of inflammatory cells in the pathogenesis of lung and systemic organ injury is well recognized. Binding of neutrophils to endothelial cells and migration into the parenchyma are largely regulated by complementary adhesion molecules. The leukocyte integrins are glycoproteins expressed on the neutrophil surface and in the cytoplasmic granules. Integrins consist of a common beta2 or cluster differentiation (CD)18 chain covalently linked to one of three different alpha chains (CDlla, CDllb, CDIlc) and exist on the cell surface as three distinct heterodimers. CDlla/CD18 is expressed on all leukocytes, whereas CD 11 b/CD 18 and CD 11 c/CD 1.8 are restricted to cells of myeloid origin. CD i 1/ CD 18 interacts with intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-I), its ligand on endothelial cells. The potential for monoclonal antibodies to adhesion proteins to reduce vascular and tissue damage has been studied in a large number of experimental models. Protective effects with anti-CD18 antibodies have been observed in a wide variety of inflammatory, immune, and isehemia-reperfusion injuries, such as arthritis, burns, endotoxic shock, bacterial meningitis, autoimmune diabetes, nerve degenemrion, allograft rejection, allergic asthma, acute lung inflammation, skin lesions, and ischemia-reperfusion models of the intestine, myocardium, lung, skeletal muscle, and central nervous system. Protective effects have also been observed in animals resuscitated following hemorrhagic shock. Blockage of CD18, however, would affect all leukocytes, as would antibodies to CDlla/CDI8. Targeting CDllb/CD18 would affect cells of the myeloid lineage only, which could prove to be beneficial. CD11b/CD18 is not only involved in transendothelial migration, but is also implicated in adherencedependent formation of reactive oxygen species. Blocking CD1 lb/CD18 may therefore not only reduce the numbe r of leukocytes accumulating in the tissue, but also attenuate the oxidant stress of infiltrated neutrophils. Anti-CD 11 b treatment has been used effectively to reduce tissue injury initiated by ischemia-reperfusion, complement activation and endotoxemia. Altering the host response by modulating the function of adhesion molecules may attenuate the inadvertent injury caused by leukocytes, but may also temporarily leave the host without effective defense machinery. Overall, animal studies suggest that it may be safe to inhibit neutrophil adhesion for a limited period of rime. These observations will have to be confirmed in carefully designed clinical trials.

Progressive microvascular damage in the tissue adjacent to a cutaneous burn injury results in extension of burn size. The role of leukocytes in the pathogenesis of microvascular injury was investigated by inhibition of their adherence to the microvascular endothelium using monoclonal antibodies directed to leukocyte CDI 8 or its endothelial ligaud, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1, CD54). A model of thermal injury was developed using New Zealand White rabbits. Two sets of three full-thickness burns separated by two 5 x 30-mm zones were produced by applying brass probes heated to 100\u00b0C to the animals' backs for 30 sec. Cutaneous blood flow determinations carried out with a laser doppler blood flowmeter were obtained for 72 hours. There were five experimental groups: controls given saline alone; animals given monoelonal antibody to the CD 18 R 15.7 prior to burn injury (pre-R 15.7); animals given R 15.7 30 min after burn injury (post-R 15.7); animals given a monoclonal antibody to ICAM-I, R 6.5 prior to burn (pre-R 6.5); and animals given the R 6.5 30 min postburn injury (post-R 6.5). Blood flow in the marginal \"zone of stasis\" between burn contact sites was significantly higher in the antibody-treated animals. Administration of the antibodies 30 min after injury was as effective as preburn administration in preserving blood flow. At 72 hr post-burn all antibody -treated animals had blood flow in the areas at risk for progression (i.e., the zone of stasis) at or above baseline levels while the control animals had levels equal to 34.7 _+ 12% of baseline (P < 0.05 by analysis of variance and Mann-Whitney U test). These results indicate that leukocytes play an important role in the pathogenesis of burn wound progression, and that this progression can be attenuated by moduIating adherence to endothelial cells. A wealth of information now supports the hypothesis that inhibition of cell adhesive mechanisms will Nter the course of immunologicand inflammatory processes. What remains unclear is whether inhibition of specific mechanisms wfl[ be of therapeutic benefit in any specific human disease. Current data derived from animal models are not inconsistent with the hope of therapeutic benefit, but techniques for inhibition (e.g., antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides, inhibitory peptides, inhibitory carbohydrates, smaII synthetic inhibitors, etc), tissue and species differences in the relative contributions of adhesion molecules to the inflammatory process, and the casCade model of adhesive interactions are all confounding issues, making predictions of therapeutic benefit in any specific human disease process very difficult.",

            "text": "Inhibition of leukocyte adherence to endothelial cells can represent a novel therapeutic approach to septic shock. We performed a pilot study to evaluate the safety and tolerability to CY-1787, a monoclonal antibody against human E-selectin, in patients with septic shock. Septic shock was defined by clinical signs of sepsis, a documented source of infection, and fluid-resistant hypotension requiring the use of vasopressors. Eleven patients entered the study, but 2 patients who died during the first 24 hours were excluded, as this was part of the protocol. CY-1787 was administered as a single intravenous bolus of 0.1 mg/kg (N=3), 0.33 mg/kg (N=3) or i mg/kg (N=3) mg/kg. The antibody was well tolerated. None of the 9 patients died during the 28 day follow-up period. Organ failure was assessed for 5 organs (CNS, lungs, liver, kidneys and coagulation). The mean number of organs failing, which was initially 2.7 \u00b1 1.2, decreased to 0.2 \u00b1 0.4 at the end of the study (p<O.O01). These results are therefore encouraging. Administration of an antibody to E-selectin in patients with septic shock requires further study. The importance of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in the host defense mechanism against viral as well as parasitic and bacterial diseases is becoming increasingly appreciated. The design of vaccines to generate cytotoxic T ceils from nonviable or subunit constructs, however, poses challenges due to the unique characteristics of antigen processing and presentation by class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Since the final antigen recognized by CTL are short peptides capable of high affinity binding to class I MHC molecules, we have designed strategies: a) to define the structural characteristics of peptides that are required for their high affinity binding to MHC; and b) to formulate these peptides into immunogenic vaccines that are capable of generating cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The strategy and results to accomplish these two goals will be discussed. Amnon Altman and Erich Gulbins Ras proteins represent essential intermediates in receptor-mediated growth and differentiation pathways. They couple signals initiated by receptor or nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) at the cell surface to cytoplasmic targets which coordinate signal transduciion to the nucleus. Ras also participates in T lymphocyte activation initiated by the antigen-specific T cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex, which leads to lymphokine production and proliferation. Receptor ligation causes activation of associated PTKs of the Src and Syk families as the earliest identifiable event in this pathway. The importance of Ras in T cell activation is indicated by the findings that an oncogenic Ras protein activates the interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene promoter; conversely, a transdominant inhibitory ras mutant inhibits this event and the activation of MAP kinases. The rate-limiting step in Ras activation is the exchange of bound GDP for GTP, which is catalysed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). We identified the SH2/SH3 domain-containing Vav protein, which is selectively expressed in hematopoietic cells, as a Ras-specific GEF coupled to several hematopoietic receptors. Vav can be activated by two pathways, i.e., by PTK-mediated phosphorylation or by binding of diglyceride second messengers to a cysteine-rich, protein kinase C (PKC)homologous Vav domain. These pathways are independent as demonstrated by structure/function analysis and the use of pharmacological inhibitors. The two activation pathways may enable Vav to integrate signals from distinct hematopoietic cell receptors, and couple them to Ras. T cells express another, ubiquitous Ras GEF, i.e., Sos, which is known to be coupled to activated TPK receptors. T cell activation leads to membrane association of a signaling complex consisting of Sos and two other signaling proteins, Grb-2 and Shc, via direct binding of the Shc SH2 domain to the tyrosine-phosphorylated chain of the TCR/CD3 complex. Thus, multiple receptors, PTKs and Ras activators participate in signaling pathways that lead to hematopoieitc cell growth and differentiation. The interactions and function of these various signal transducers will be reviewed. phagocytes. Immunity is mediated by specific T lymphocytes, Cytokines produced by these specific T cells activate antimicrobial capacities in mononuclear phagocytes, thus contributing to protection. Other immune mechanisms also participate in the acquisition of resistance. On the other hand, T cells are also crucial for many pathologic sequelae of intracellular bacterial infections. Although IFN-y is central to macrophage activation, synergistic and antagonistic effects with other cytokines occur.",

Knock-out mice in which the genes for various T cell receptor chains, for MHC class I or MHC class II molecules, for cytokines or cytokine receptors had been deleted, have provided extremely helpful tools for analyzing the role of T cell subsets and cytokines in antimicrobial immunity. Using these mutant mice, the role of distinct T cell subsets and cytokines in bacterial elimination and granuloma formation was analyzed in detail. These studies underline the central role of a//3 T cells and IFN-y in antibacterial immunity and, furthermore, show a distinct function of 7/$ T cells. Moreover, these studies show that the relative contribution of CD8 or CD4 T cells to antimicrobial immunity varies in response to different pathogens. Apoptosis is an active form of cell death in which the cell participates in its own demise, providing the biochemical pathways that trigger and mediate the complex events of the process. Although this phenomenon has been studied for many years, it is only recently that significant progress has been made towards the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that control apoptosis. Once such mechanism came as something of a surprise: in a number of eases, apoptosis can be promoted by the action of the c-Myc protein, a protooncogene product that had previously been associated only with cell proliferation (and presumably, survival) . Expression of c.Myc in cells can cause them to enter an apoptotic pathway or proliferate, mad this \"decision\" depends upon additional signals, such as growth factors that inhibit apoptosis and allow the ceils to proliferate. Thus, c-Myc directs cells out of rest and the choice of proliferation or death depends upon the presence or absence of survival signals. Other survival signals are generated by oncogene productS that can cooperate with My\u00a2, including Bcl-2 and AbL There are implications of this interplay between apoptotie and anti-apoptorlc signals in cell Iransformation and the resistance of some tumor ceils to therapeutic agents capable of inducing apoptosis. Oncogene interactions therefore control the life or death of transformed ceils but also have important roles in normal, development processes. In the immune system, developing T ceils are \"screened\" for potential self-reactivity by a process of negative selection, in which activation via the T cell receptor (TCR) induces apoptosis. This process can be mimicked in T cell hybridomas, and appears to depend upon the expression of the c-Mye protein.",

As such, they gave us new ways to look at the life and death of a cell Recent attention has focused on macrophage release of cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF as important mediators of septic shock. However, serum cytokine levels have correlated poorly with outcome of septic shock. The purpose of this study was to compare the functional status of macrophages to serum cytokine levels in early sepsis by an analysis of splenic macrophage protein synthesis during abdominal sepsis. Macrophage total protein distribution and biosynthetic activity was assessed by large format 2-D PAGE, autoradiography of 35S-labeled proteins and computer assisted densitometric analysis. Sepsis was induced in Sprague Dawley mts by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Untreated and sham operated rats served as controls. Splenic macrophages were harvested at 3 and 24 hrs. following CLP. Serum IL-6 levels were determined at 3,12, and 24 hours by the 7 TDI bioassay. By 12 hrs. 100% of the CLP mls exhibited multi-microbiaJ bacteremia. Control or sham operated rats did not show bacteremia. CLP resulted in a significant 286% elevation (p < 0.05) in serum IL-6 levels at 12 hrs. There was no difference in IL-6 at 3 and 24 hrs. when compared to the control groups. 2D PAGE studies examined splenic macrophage total protein distribution and biosynthetic activity at 3 and 24 hrs. post-CLP. At 3 hrs. macrophages from CLP rats showed a substantial decrease in total protein pattern (353 protein spots vs 503 protein spots) when compared to non-septic control macrophages. A decrease in the number of lower molecular weight proteins (< 40 kD) was observed. At 24 hrs. post-CLP, splenic macrophages from CLP rats showed a substantial increase in the synthesis of low molecular weight (< 40 kD) proteins, when compared to non-septic controls.

Staining with CD14 and CD16 mAbs will identify two monocyte subpopulations in human blood: A major population of regular monocytes, which strongly expresses the CD14 antigen (CD14++) and a minor population with weak expression of CD14 and expression of the CD16 antigen lCD14+/ CD16+ cells). In healthy control donors(n=35) the latter cells account for 45+22 cells/mm 3 and 9%+5% of the monocytes. In sepsis patients, the CD]4+/CD16+ cells can become a major population with more than 50% of all monocytes in 3 of 18 patients and with more than 500 cells/mm 3 in 4 of 18 cases. There was no correlation of CD14+/ CD16+ cells to any clinical parameter except for CD14+/CD16+ percentage and body temperature (p= 0.013).",

Three-color-IF shows that the CD14+/ CD16+ cells in sepsis patients when compared with the CD14++ monocytes exhibit a higher level of class II antigen and a lower level of CDIIb and CD33 antigens, consistent with a more mature nature of the CD14+/CD16+ cells. Levels of IL-6 were increased in sepsis patients: 3 of 5 patients with high numbers of CDI4+/CD16+ cells ( 200/mm 3) had high levels of IL-6 (250U/ml). These data suggest that septicemia may lead to substantial changes in blood monocyte composition and this may be related to elevated levels of cytokines such as IL-6. Human peritoneal macrophages were exposed to increasing doses of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or a synthetic Lipid A analogue (MRL 953) and production of the cytokines IL-lb, iL-6, TNF-a and G-CSF was assessed at the protein-and mRNAlevel. Cells were also stimulated with low doses of LPS and MRL 953 to study their \"adaptation\" to a secondary challenge with high doses of LPS. TNF-a production after stimulation with LPS could be almost completely relieved by preincubation of cells with low doses of LPS and similarly, IL-6 production was suppressed. Surprisingly, however, \"adapted\" cells were able to synthesize even larger quantities of of G-CSF and IL-lb when exposed to a secondary LPS challenge. The changes in TNF-a, IL-6 and G-CSF protein synthesis could a/so be detected on the mRNA level, whereas transcript levels for IL-lb remained unaltered as assessed by Northern blot analysis. High doses of the synthetic lipid A analogue MRL 953 were also able to \"adapt\" macrophages for a secondary LPS challenge by downregulating TNFa-and IL-6-production, while priming secretion of G-CSFand IL-lb as well. Taken together, here we describe for the first time the discordant adaptation of human peritoneal macrophages to a secondary LPS stimulus in vitro. These findings appear to bear ramifications for the in-vivo endotoxin response during inflammation and gramnegative septicemia. Shock states with inadequate cellular oxygen delivery may contribute to macrophage (MO) activation or dysregulation. In this study we compared the effect of transient hypoxia and endotoxin pretreatment (LPS 1) on MO mediator release with a second endotoxin stimulus (LPS2). Methods: In vitro cultures of marine peritoneal exudate MO were exposed to 2 hr. of hypoxic or normoxic conditions, then incubated 22 hr under identical normoxic conditions _+ 10 ng/ml of LPS 1 pretreatment. During the final 24 hours all M~l were exposed to a range of LPS 2 concentrations. M~i supernatants were assayed for TNF, IL-1, IL-6, PGE2, nitric oxide (NO), and superoxide release. Results: LPS 1 markedly inhibited MO TNF release by LPS 2 but hypoxia had no effect on LPS 2-triggered TNF release. Hypoxia increased MO IL-6 production in the absence of LPS 1, but inhibited LPS 1 augmentation seen under normoxic conditions. Pretreatment with LPS 1 increased NO production from LPS 2 under normoxic conditions, but bypoxiainhibited this effect. Pretreatment with LPS1 signifcantly augmented MO release of IL-i and PGE 2, but hypoxia had no significant effect (data not shown) Superoxide production was increased by LPS 1 under normoxic conditions, but hypoxia significantly inhibited superoxide release (not shown A. Lepape, C. Docile, F. Arpin, M. C. Gutowski, V. Banssillon and J. Bienvenu. I AIM OF THE STUDY. Increased levels of TNF are inconsistently correlated with the severity of sepsis. One possible explanation is a decrease ability of ceils to produce eytokines. The objectives of this study were m compare at different levels of of clinical severity the responsiveness of cytokine producing cells. This was evaluated by the response to a stimulation by LPS as well as to the inhibitory effect of PTX. The technic used is a whole blood ex-vivo model, as described by DESCH et al. (1) . H MATERIALS AND METHODS. Different groups of ICU patients, postoperative (n=12), sepsis (n=12), septick shock (n=13), and healthy control (n=10), were studied. Blood was drawn in endotoxio free heparinized robes. Stimulation was achieved by addition nf75 pl ofLPS (10ng/ml) to 675 Id of whole blood in presence of various concentrations of PTX (0, 10 \"5, 10 -4, 10 \"3, I0\"2M). After 5 hrs incubation at 37\u00b0C, the tubes were centrifuged and supematants frozen at -80\u00b0C. TNFa and/L6 were measured by ELISA (Medgenix R and Immunotech R respectively). Monocytes were quantified on a Technicon H6000. The results are expressed as median values. Non parametric tests are used for testing differences between groups. HI RESULTS, TNFtx and 11,6, corrected for monocytes count, are given as % of their initial value, the baseline before stimulation or inhibition being 100%, 1) STIMULATION BY LPS. The control group is much more stimulated (>21000% for IL6, >8000% for TNFa). Blood samples taken postoperatively and in patients with simple sepsis are significantly less stimulated (>1500% for IL6, >600% for TNFa ). The lowest stimulation was observed in patients with septic shock (median = 168%), some patients being not stimulated at all. 2)EFFECTS OF PTX.The inhibitory effect of PTX on TNFtx production is effective in all groups at 10 -3 M (reduction to less than '\u00bc of the median values), and is almost complete at 10\" 2 M. The septic shock group has a decreased sensitivity to PTX. IL6 production exhibits a lesser reduction at 10 -3 M (~ 'A to \u00bd of the median values), further increased at 10 -2 M. The septic shock group is again less sensitive to PTX. IV CONCLUSION: The reduced ability of circulating monocytes to produce cytokines during severe infections is confirmed here. PTX is able to reduce significantly TNFc~ at 10 -3 M and the inhibition is nearly complete at 10 -2 M. Surprisingly, there is a lesser, but significant suppressive action of PTX on IL6, not found in experiments using purified monocytes. One possible explination could be the interplay between cytokines production.",

By comparing transcript abundance both prior to and following differentiation, individual genes can be identified whose transcription is regulated both positively and negatively. In order to examine monocyte activation, the human monocyte line THP-1 was induced with phorbol ester (48 h) and activated for 4 h with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) after which polyA + RNA was purified. The RNA from control and LPS-treated cells were each used to construct a cDNA library under identical conditions, and all resulting clones were selected for cDNA sequence analysis. Each clone sequence was evaluated by matching with both GenBank and our own gene databases. Very different patterns of gene expression were seen in the two libraries, the latter reflecting very high levels of known inflammatory mediators such as IL-1 and TNF. A second set of libraries were made from umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), both with and without LPS stimulation, and were analyzed in a similar fashion. The effects of LPS induction on specific gene transcription in both cell types will be discussed. T. Tadros, MD, Th Wobbes, ME) PhD, RJA Goris, MD PhD",

Cook*, Departments of Physiology , Pharmacology \"l\" and Medicine \"t, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, S.C. 29425. Adherence of monoeytes to endothelium and extracella/ar matrix proteins is essential for accumulation at sites of inflammation. TXA2, an arachidonic acid metabolite, inhibits human monocyte chemotactic responses suggesting that TXA 2 may alter monocyte adhesiveness. We selected the THP-1 cell line, a human monocytic leukemia cell line to further investigate the effect of TXA 2 on adhesion. We tested the hypothesis that TXA 2 alters LPSinduced adhesion of THP-1 cells and that TXA 2 exerts its effect on adhesion via a cAMP dependent mechanism. THP-I cells were exposed to S. enteritidis endotoxin (lp.g/ml) _+ the cyelooxygenase inhibitor lndomethacin (IN), the TXA 2 mimetic I-BOP (0.11.tM,) or TXA 2 receptor antagonists BMS180291 and L657925 (10~M). Cells were allowed to adhere for 24 hours and adherent protein/well was determined. LPS-induced a significant (p<0.05;n=7) increase in adherence of THP-1 cells (Basal, 2.4+0.85gg protein/well; LPS, 20.4+_6.0p.g protein/well). The amino acid glutamine is an essential compound for synthesis of purine and pyrimidine basis and therefore necessary for RNA-and DNA synthesis. In human plasma the concentration of glutamine is between 0.5 -0.6 mM, and is reduced in septic patients up to 80 % (0.1 -0.2 mM). Monocytes play a central part in the inunune system and it was of interest, whether glutamine is involved in the modulation of cell surface markers and phagocytosis of these cells. Human peripheral blood mononuclear ceils were obtained from 500 ml heparinized blood of apparently healthy donors by Ficoll-Paque density gradient and isolated by counterflow elutriation. The puritiy was more than 90 %. Subsequently cells were cultured in phenolred-free RPMI 1640 medium with various concentrations of glutamine (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.6, 1, 2 mM) in teflon-fluorinated ethylene propylene bottles to exclude cell adhesion and possible cell activation. Aider seven days culture, cell viabilty was determined by trepan blue exclusion and varied between 70 and 90 %, independent of glutamine concentrations. Cell surface markers were detected by flow cytometry, noaspecifie phagoeytosis was measured with latex beads and specific phagocytosis with opsonizied E.eoli using a FACScan. Lower concentrations of glutamine decreased the expression of HLA-DR and ICAM-1/CD54 on monocytes in a dose-dependent manner. The receptor for Fc'/RUCD64 as well as the receptors for complement CR3/CDllb and CR4/CDllc were down-regulated. CR1/CD35 which is only slightly expressed on monocytes was not influenced. Furthermore, no effects on the expression of CDI4, the receptor for transferrin CD71 and Fc'fRIII/CD16 were seen. Our data indicate, that lower concentrations of glutamme influence the phenotype of monocytes. We are now interested to study whether glutmnine influences non-specific phagocytosis, or whether specific phagocytosis correlates with the decreased expression of Fc'/R and complement receptors. We investigated immunologically more than 300 patients who were admitted to ICU because septic syndrom during the last four years. Patients were immunologically followed up 2-3 times per week until release from ICU. The expression of HLA-DR antigen on monocytes turned out to be the best prognostic parameter. The persistence (> 5 days) of low HLA-DR expression (< 30%) predicts fatal outcome (mortality > 85%). The altered phenotype was associated with a functional deactivation of monocytes (diminished APC, ROS formation, cytokine secretion). We called this phenomenon \"immunoparalysis\". IFN-gamma and GM-CSF were able to restore the altered phenotype and function in vitro. However, addition of autologous plasma from septic patients with \"immunoparalysis\" to these cultures prevented the cytokine-induced restitution. The inhibitory activity could not be removed by dialysis. Therefore, we started a study to prove the therapeutic efficacy of plasmapheresis. Indeed, [7 of 33 patients recovered from \"immunoparalysis\" following repeated plasmapheres; 16 of them survived (46 %). 7 patients recovered temporarely and 9 patients did not respond (all 16 died). The survival rate in the control group of septic patients with persistent \"immunoparalysis\" was 4 of 38 (11%; p<0,01). In summary, plasmapheresis in association with immune monitoring may be an alternative strategy to improve survival rate in severe sepsis.",

            "text": "Taurolidine, a synthetic taurine-formaldehyde derivative has antiadherent, bactericidal and anti-LPS properties functioning primarily through binding of the lipid A region of the LPS molecule. The active derivative of Taurolidine, taurine, modulates calcium channel activity, critical to the initiation of a number of immunostimulatory pathways. We hypothesised that Taurolidine may have direct immunostimulatory activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the immune effects of Taurolidine on peritoneal macrophage (PMO) function and then determine the role of taurine in this response. Study 1: In vivo stimulation:CD-1 mice (n=35) were randomized to receive Taurolidine (200mg/kg BW/i.p.) or saline cor~trol. PeritoneaI cells were harvested after 24 hours and were assessed for PM0 function [Superoxide anion generation (O2-), Nitric oxide (NO), Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), Fc/CR3-mediated phagocytic function (Phago) Study 2: Control PM0 were harvested and cultured in vitro with taurine (1.0mg/ml for 10 hrs), after which time they were assayed for 0 2-and TNF release. In vivo stimulation with Taurolidine Taurolidine has specific immunological effects on M0. Release of the inflammatory mediators 0 2-and TNF, and Fc/CR3-mediated phagocytosis were significantly increased, while release of the endothelial relaxing factor NO was significantly reduced. In addition, the amino acid taurine, which is released as a byproduct of Taurolidines breakdown has an immunostimulatory effect on PMO and may be the active moeity of the compound Tanrolidine. In sepsis, a number of mediators which affect vasomotor tone and cardiovascular function are produced. Inasmuch as sepsis causes decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR), attention is usually focussed on vasodilators such as lactate, tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-i & 2, and nitric oxide. But injury and inflammation als0 cause production of several vasoconstrictors whose effect may not be evident in changed SVR, but may significantly affect organ blood flow or function in the paracrine environment. Endothelin (ET) is a 21 amino acid peptide vasoconstrictor produced by ischemic or injured endothelial cells (EC's). ET is also a potent constrictor for renal mesangial and coronary vessels, an endocrine regulator, and a negative cardiac inotrope. Systemic ET levels increase significantly in hypoperfusion and ischemia. While ET is principally produced by EC's, we asked if human monocytes might also produce ET and thereby regulate vasomotor tone in areas of inflammation. Monocytes from healthy donors were separated on Ficoll, resuspended in RPMI 1640 +5% fetal calf serum and stimulated with i0 ug/ml endotoxin (LPS). ET was measured by radioimmunoassay. LPS-stimulated monocytes produced 87 ! 6 fM of ET/106 cells (vs. unstimulated controls of <25). This calculates to 15-30% of the amount of ET observed in patients with low cardiac output, sepsis or ischemia. We conclude that ET is a cytokine produced by both EC's and monocytes with potent effects on numerous cells and organs in the critically ill. Wuppertal 5, Germany We and other authors showed that fatal outcome in septic disease is associated with a decreased capacity of peripheral blood monocytes for the in vitro production of proinflammatory cytokines, especially TNF-alpha. We found that this monocytic deactivation is completed by a persistent and marked decrease of HLA-DR expression on monocytes (< 30 % HLA-DR+ monocytes) and a diminished antigen presenting activity whereas the capacity to form the antiinflammatory IL-1 receptor antagonist remains high. In order to evaluate the in vivo situation and to determine at which level TNFproduction/secretion is altered we assessed the TNF-alpha mRNA expression in freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) from septic patients. TNF-mRNA was onty rarely detected by semiqaantitative polymerase chain reaction in PBMNC's from septic patients with monocyte deactivation. Meanwhile, it was found in almost all PBMNCs from septic patients without monocytic deactivation. We wondered, whether IL-I0, which ,is known to depress monocytic proinflammatoly response and MHC class II expression, could be one of the mediators in fatal sepsis. In fact, we found that IL-10 message in PBMNCs of septic patients peaked in the beginning phase of monocytic deactivation. In further investigations we found that TNF-administration can induce monocytic deactivation in a murine model/n vivo and provoke IL-10 message in human PBMNCs in vitro. These results support our hypothesis that an excessive delivery of proinflammatory cytokines in a first phase can induce an overwheiming inhibitory feedback, mediated by immuninhibitory mediators like IL-l0, which leads to often fatal monocytic deactivation in a second phase. Interferon-gamma which is known to counteract IL-10 production and the effects of IL-10 on monocytes restores the function and phenotype of monocytes from septic patients with monoq, te deactivation in vitro and could be a possible therapeutic agent in otherwise fatal sepsis. Our laboratory previously reported that LPS dependent macrophagederived TNF-a production can be enhanced by pretreatment with LPS at substimulatory LPS priming doses coincident with a suppression of LPS dependent nitric oxide (NO) production (Zhang and Morrison, J. Exp. Med 17:511, 1993) . In order to extend the characterization of these LPS priming effects in mouse macrophages, we examined the capacity of substimulatory LPS to modify LPS dependent IL-6 production. Macrophages were obtained from peritoneal exudate of thioglycollate treated C3Heb/FeJ mice and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Macrophages were pretreated with various subthreshold stimulatory concentrations of LPS (Olll:B4) for 6 hours, washed three times, and then stimulated with the effective stimulatory concentration of LPS for 18 hours. The amount of IL-6 in the supernatant was measured by IL-6 dependent cell line (B9 and 7TD1) proliferation assay. IL-6 was produced by macrophages at lower threshold doses of LPS than those required for TNF-o~ or NO production. Subthreshold doses of LPS modulated IL-6 production in a biphasic manner characterized by an initial suppression and then potentiation. Higher doses resulted in secretion of IL-6 during the initial incubation with LPS and subsequent desensitization.",

The role of macrophage (Mph) stimulation in mechanism of protective effect of new immunomodulators yeast polysaccharides -heteropolysaccharide Cryelan and homopolysaccharide mannan Rhodexman (both produced by Petersburg Chem.-Pharm. Inst.) was studied. In vitro according to NST test incubation of murine peritoneal Mphs with Cryelan or Rhodexman, 150 ~g/ml,30 min was followed by increase of potencial microbicidic activity of Mphs. In vivo Mph stimulation by immunomodulators studied included increase rate of carbon particles phagocytosis during single i.v. or i.p. mode of administration to mice 1-14 days after (peak at 2nd day for i.v. and 5th day for i.p. mode of administration of the same dose of 5 mg/100 g b.w.).The preliminary injection of Cryelan (5 mg/100 g, 24 or 48 h before) to mice with acute cold stress (-10 \u00b0 C, 1 h) revealed protective effect restorating the value of depressed phagocytosis up to the normal level;the positive effect on ultrastructure of hepatocytes was noted also.There was no changes of plasma corticosterone level between group with acute cold stress and mice with Cryelan + acute cold stress (several fold increase comparatively to the control mice).As was suggested, the mechanism of protection can include Mph stimulation and secretion of some acute phase proteins responsible for positive effect of immunomodulators. New yeast polysaccharides Cryelan and Rhodexman can be used for macrophage stimulation,especially in pathological states. Immunomodulators were shown to increase production and secretion of lysosomal enzymes (like zymosan). Secreted enzymes,especially cysteine proteinasescathepsins B and L -involve in the process of inflammation;however, excessive release of these enzymes may lead to noncontrolled proteolysis followed by tissue degradation (Assfalg-Machleidt et al.,1990) .The effect of zymosan,BCG and new immunomodulator carboxymethylglucan (CMG), second fraction on secretion of lysosomal enzymes by murine peritoneal macrophages was studied. Zymosan increased the secretion of N-acetyl-~-D-glucosaminidase and ~-galactosidase into the culture medium (3-4 fold); BCG possessed similar effect.CMG in the same concentrations (50 /~g/ml) increased release of these enzymes only sAightly (1.6 times).It's known that zymosan-induced secretion reflects the enzyme release from formed lysosomes (Warren,1989) .It was suggested that CMG activated macrophages via interaction with scavenger-receptors,followed by weak secretion of lysosomal enzymes and as a result decrease of tissue damage. In vivo zymosan induced stimulation of mononuclear system of phagocytes followed by increase of cysteine proteinases activity in liver at the 5th day. In the same time in blood N-acetyl-~-D-glucosaminidase and N-acetyl-~-D-galactosidase activity increased 2-5 fold. It was concluded that in drug design it's possible to select such immunomodulators,e.g. CMG,which can activate mononuclear system of phagocytes and do not damage tissue. Endothelin-i (ET-I) is produced by injured/ ischemic endothelium, mobilizes intracellular Ca ++ and is a potent vasoconstrictor. It is also a Ca ++ agonist for anterior pituitary or renal mesangial cells and monocytes. ET-I causes monocytes to produce interleukin-l, 6, 8, prostaglandin E2, and substances which trigger neutrophil superoxide production. ET-I levels increase in shock and ET may play a role in activating leukocytes post shock causing reperfusion injury. But blood flow experiments suggest splanchnic circulation changes more profoundly in shock than peripheral circulation. We therefore asked if ET-4 (or VIC), the ET which predominates in splanchnic vessels, had any effect on monocyte cytokine production. Human monocytes from health~ blood donors were separated on Ficoll. 0.5 x 10Ucells/ ml in RPMI 1640 + 10% FCS were incubated i0 min., 6 & 24 hrs. with 10 -8 M ET-I, 10 -8 M VIC or I0 ug/ml of LPS. Supernatants were assayed by ELISA. We have shown that low dose endotoxin pretreatment (LPS 1 ) for 24 hrs markedly inhibits the macrophage (MO) release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and increases interleukin-1 (IL-I) in response to a subsequent endotoxin stimulus (LPS2). In this study we examined the kinetics of LPS 1 inhibition of TNF and augmentation ofIL-1. Methods: Murine peritoneal exudate MO from Balbc mice were exposed in vitro to medium or 10 ng/ml of LPS1 for intervals of 0 to 24 hours. Culture medium was then replaced with 0, 10 or 1000 ng/ml of LPS2 for 24 hrs. TNF and IL-1 in MO supernatants were measured by specific bioassays. During sepsis endotoxin (LPS) activates macrophages (MO) to release mediators such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-I (IL-I) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). We showed that preexposure to LPS (LPS 1) alters the response of murine M~i to subsequent LPS stimulation (LPS2). We hypothesized that in vitro cytokine release by LPS2 in human monocytes (MO) is also be altered by preexposure to LPSI. Methods: Human peripheral blood MO were obtained from healthy volunteers (N=8), cultured in vitro 24 hrs, then pretreated 24 hr _+ LPS 1-Cultures were then stimulated with LPS 2 and mediators in MO supernatant measured: TNF, IL-I, and IL-6 by specific bioassays, PGE2 by immunoassay kit. Serum cytokine levels (specific ELISA kits) were compared to in vitro supernatant levels. Data is expressed as % control_+SEM, LPS2= 1000 ng/mh The table shows that all mediators were increased, in the absence of LPS 1. Pretreatment with LPS 1 resulted in complete inhibition of LPS2-triggered TNF release. In contrast, LPS 1 significantly increased MO secretion of IL-1, IL-6 and PGE 2 (data not shown). Serum cytokine levels were as follows: TNF 407_+21, IL-I 241+208, and IL-6 8.0-+2.5 ng/ml. These serum levels were low, showed an extremely wide variation, and did not correlate with in vitro LPS2-triggered mediator production. Conclusion: Human monoeyte mediator production is differentially regulated by preexposure to LPS 1. Provocative in vitro testing of monocytes may ultimately be clinically useful to identify prior in vivo LPS exposure or MO Macrophages release numerous secretory products involved in host defense and inflammation. Activated macrophages with cytokines produced have been implicated in tissue damage in sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction. Aimed to elucidate the organ-association phenomena,this study is to compare peritoneal macrophage(PM),alveolar macrophage(AM), and Kupffer cells(KC) during sepsis in terms of cellular protein contents as symbol of activation by flow cytometry analysis. Sepsis were produced by cecal ligatien and perforation (CLP) in Wistar rats weighing 210-290g.PM were obtained by peritoneal lavage,AM by bronchial lavage and KC by incubating the collegenase digested liver with pronase-E. Leukocytes have been implicated as a mediator of the microvascular dysfunction associated with reperfasion of ischemic tissues. A role for Ieukocytes is largely based on observations that rendering animals anutropenic with anti-neutrophil serum or preventing leukocyte adhesion with monoclonal antibodies attenuates the increased fluid and protein leakage from the vaseulature that is normally observed in postischemic tissues. We have recently undertaken studies designed to determine the relationship between leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion and albumin leakage ia rat mesenterlc venules exposed ~o ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). Leukocyte adherence and emigration as well as albumin extravasafion were monitored in single postcapillary venules using iatravital fluorescence microscopy, lschemia was induced by complete occ!usion of the superior mesenteric artery and ~dl parameters were monitored at various intervals following reperfusion. The magnitude of the leukocyte adherence and emigration, and albumin leakage elicited by I/R was positively con-elated with the duration of ischemia. The albumin leakage response was also highly correlated with the number of adherent and emigrated leukocytes. Monoclonal antibodies against the adhesion glycoproteins CD18, CDllb, ICAM-1 and L-selectin, but not P-or E-selecdn, reduced I/R-induced leukocyte adherence and emigration as well as albumin leakage. PhaUoidln, an F-aetin stabilizer, largely prevented the emigration (but not adherence) of leukocytes and greatly reduced, the raicrovascular protein leakage. Plateletleukocyte aggregates were formed in postischemic vemdes; the number of aggregates was reduced by antibodies against P-selecdh, CDIlb, CD18, and ICAM-1, but not E-selectin or Lselectin. A significant fraction of the mast ceils surrounding the posteapillary venules degranulated in response to ischemia/repeffusion, but mast cell stabilizers did not afford protection against the albumin leakage elicited by I/R. These results indicate that reperfusloninduced albumin leakage is tightly coupled to the adherence and emigration of leukocytes in posteapillary venules. This adhesiomdependent injury response is primarily mediated by CDllb/CDI8 on activated neutrophils and ICAM-1 on venular endothellum, and appears to require L-selecda dependent leukocyte rolling. Mast cell degranulation does not appear to conwibate to the vascular pathology associated with I/R.",

More recently it has been proven that the PMN can make mRNA for and secrete the proinflammatory oytokines ILla, IL-IB, TNFS, IL-6 and IL-8 as does the other major circulating phagocyte, the monocyte/macrophags. Furthermore it has been shown to make the potentially autoregulatory oytokines GCSF and GMCSF. These functional capabilities suggest that the PMN is not an Wend cell ~, but one which has a potential role in regulation cf ~he immune response and that this potential ~cle should no longer be ignored when considering the immune abnormalities existing in patients following maJo~ injury or surgery. We have investigated the proinflaznmatory oytokine secretion patter~ by PMN in patients following major ~hermal or tra~matic injury and in volunteers fellowinq endotoxemia. ?ollowing major injury there is variable PMN secretion of these cytokines when stimulated in vlero. Following endotoxemia in a group of human volunteers PMN showed a hypo=esponsivenesa to LPS 4 hrs following endotoxin infusion followed at 24 hre by an overshoot. Pretreatment with steroids modulated this overshoot phenomenon, suggesting that receptors for steroids are involved in the regulation of cytokin\u00ae secretlon by FMN. These results sugges~ that the PMN, the most numerous cell in the circulation and the first to respond to an ins~l~ may be a so~rce of the prolnflammatory cytokine cascade following injury that has been recognized as significant in the process which often leads to multiple o;gan failure, The immunosuppresslon which occurs following major thermal Injury may predispose these individuals to infection and sepsis, which remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.",

LPS and f'MLP resulted In a slight Increase (3 fold) In the expression of CD11b on PMNS from burned patients compared to an 8 and 14 fold increase, respectively, on PMNs from healthy individuals. This Inability of LPS or fMLP to increase CD11 b expression was not due to the amount of LPS bound to the two cell populations. Because the same defect Is seen after either LPS or fMLP stimulation, It Is speculated that the defect must be in the amount of preformed CD1 ] b or Its transport to the plasma membrane. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) and neutrophils have been implicated in the patbophysiology of ischemia-repeffusion injury, In addition, PAF stimulates neutrophi[ (PMN) oxidative metabolism in vitro. The present study examined the potential role of PAF in repeffusion injury in an in viva rabbit model. Eight anesthetized rabbi~s underwent retroperitoneal exposure of the infrarenal abdominal aorta after percutaneous insertion of a catheter through the jugular vein into the infrahepatic inferior vena cava. Doppler flow probes were placed around the abdominal aorta and the right common femoral artery to assess flow through these vessels. An occlusive ligature was placed around the abdominal aorta (superior to the flow probe) at t = 0 and total occlusion of blood flow to the lower extremities was maintained for g0 mins., after which the ligature was released allowing for reperfusion of the ischemic lower limbs. Effluent blood from the ischemic hind-limbs was collected through the IVC catheter at the times indicated below and assayed for PAF by a direct radioimmunoassay. In addition, neutrophil H202 production was determined by a previously described 2'7'-dichlorofluorescein flowcytametric assay. 185 _+ 53 amean _+ s.e.m, pg/ml blood; brelative fluoresenee (% of baseline); Caortic and femoral artery flow (% of baseline); *p < 0.01 vs. baseline; 1\"p < 0.05 vs. baseline. A significant elevation of PAF was observed in ischemic hind-limb effluent blood at 15 min. after release of the aortic ligature during the repeffusion phase, as compared to baseline levels. In addition, PMN H20 2 production was increased by 2.3-fold above baseline values by 1 hour after ligature release during the reperfusion phase. Both of these elevations were transient and returned toward baseline by 2 hours post-isehemia. Tatar occlusion of hind-limb flow was achieved as evidenced by the absence of aortic or femorat flow at 90 rain. post-ischemia, however after release 01 the ligature a significant reactive hyperemia was observed by 15 mln. into the rapeffusion phase. Histolog[c examination of reper[used gastrocnemius muscle revealed moderate PMN infiltration into the interstitium. In conclusion, these data indicate that PAF is released into the circulation during repeffusion, and is likely involved as a mediator in the observed PMN oxidative burst activity, thereby contributing to reperfusien injury. Following thermal Injury and Infection granulocyte function ts abnormal. To elucidate the mechanism by which thermal injury and Infection affect the granulocyte's ability to polymerize and depolymedze actin, we serially measured F-Actin levels in granulocytes from 14 burned patients (mean age 42,1 +_ 17.7 years, mean burn size 39.8% _+ 22.2%) during the first S weeks post injury. Six of the patients had infections during the course of the study, (septicemia, wound Invasion and pneumonia). Actin levels In granulocytes from eleven healthy volunteers (mean age 34 years) were measured repeatedly and served as controls. Lysecl white blood cell preparations were brought to 370C and incubated with N-formyl-met-leu-phe (STIM) or with Dulbecco's phosphate unbuffered sellne (UNSTIM). The cells were concomitantly stained and fixed with formaldehyde, lysoleclthln and fiuoresceln phafioidin. Actin depolymedzation (DEPOL) was measured by Incubating stimulated cells at 0\u00b0C before the stain-fixative was added. Baseline (BASE) F-actln levels were assessed by adding stsln-fixatlve to Icecold unstimulated cells. Fluorescence was estimated In a FACSCAN and expressed as Ilnesr mean channel fluorescence_+ SEM (MCF). Figure 1 displays granulecyle Fectln levels In Infected and uninfected patients as compared to controls. F-actln levels were consistently lower In control cells than In those from burned or burn-infected patients under all measured conditions. Granulocytes from Infected burned patients demonstrated a significant decrement In their ability to depofymerlze F.actin compared to both uninfected burned patients and controls, while there were no significant differences between Infected and 1,~ uninfected patients In the baseline, unstlmuleted and stimulated conditions.

In order to study tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor sensitivity in septic critically ill patients we investigated 20 blood samples of such people in reaction of leucocyte migration inhibition. Migration of their polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs) was studied with stimulation with human recombinant TNF in concentration of 166.7 U/ml (recommended by manufacturer is the range of 10-200 O/ml) and without such.

At the same time normal PMNs in control group did show migration changes upon TNF stimulation. Considering all the above we come to a conclusion that externally added TNF fails to activate PMNs in critically ill patients more than they are by their endogenous TNF. Moreover, this TNF no longer serves a positive chemotactic factor for such PMNs. These findings may suggest that in critically ill septic patients reactivity of PMNs to TNF is deeply altered. TNF receptors of PMNs are either exhausted as such by excessive stimulation with endogenous TNF or further transmission of their message is impossible due to \"fatigue\" of the cell's activation mechanisms.

The task of this investigation was to evaluate the possible regulatory role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and its potential immunosupressive opponent, the transforming growth factor-&, in regulation of neutrophil degranulation. We analysed the concentration of the al-proteinase-inhibitor complex of the lysosomal elastase as marker for the degranulation of neutrophils as well as the levels of IL-6 and TGF-61 in the plasma probes of patients undergoing multiple trauma and severe surgeries. The time courses of IL-6 and elastase were found to be highly correlated, wheras the concentrations of the cytokine TGF-E~ were found to be not significantly altered in comparison to the control group.

The conclusion is that neutrophil proteinases can be involved in the balance of rat skeletal muscle neutral proteinases after ~A. A lot and new clinical problems complicating the outcome of polytrauma, burn and septic patients in Surgical Intensive Care Units, have arisen as the care improvement prolonged the patient's survival: a progressive degradation of organ and system functions often develops, usually making its first clinical appearance by ARDS, followed by the other organ failure (MOF) and sepsis symptoms. The clinical picture is polymorphic, the end result of a complex systemic pathophysiological reaction trigg~ed off by trauma consequences (tissues disruption, hypo~xygenatiun and necrosis). Nowadays there is not a preventi~ or specific therapy to lower the mortality rate (70-80%) and-'mdy-a~ early, aggressive surgical approach .-evacuating haematomas, stopping bleeding, toileting all septic, necrotic foci and restoring anatomic continuity-, seems to be of some help This complex clinical entity has not an univocal denomination yet. The proper labelling of an illness should come from the full understanding of its pathopysiology and suggest the proper treatment choice. Clinical and experimental studies demonstrated that pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in the past-traumatic illness, share the same anatomo-pathological elemem: the interstitial edema, due to a generalised endothelial micro circulatory injury. This alteration, as constantly seen in polytrauma patients, develops in a few hours after trauma as a consequence of the deregulation of the homoeostatic and immune mechanisms. In fact the overproduced oxygen free radicals and r~ombinam cytokines (IL1,TNF), together with the complement degradation fragments, the proteolytic enzymes and many other mediators are all strongly h~l ~ ,_he e,,j,yheha! ceils. Our~osect, atim~,-bnsed on examination of autopsical specimens from 85 polytraanm patients, showed that such endothelial damage, supporting the interstitial edema, is widely and simultaneensly distributed, ensues shortly aRer trauma and shows its effects in different organs at different times, only because each apparatus has different fimctienal reserves: the lung is the first organ to fail just because its ah, celocapillary membrane is one of the most delicate bodily structure, and its function is irroplace~le. We think it will be of a great help, in planning a preventive therapy, to chose a denomination focusing the physician's attention on the earl)\" generalized endothelial injury and its effects, as in trauma patients it is present -even if latenflysince the first few hours. We would like to see the generalised endothelial microcircolatory injury properly highlighted when considering the best definition and the optimal nomenclature for the post-traumatic s3mdrome. The presence of interleukin (IL)-8 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of critically ill patients correlates clinically with the development of the adult respiratory distress syndrome lARDS), and inhibition of IL-8 in animal models can attenuate lung injury. Collectively, evidence to date suggests that IL-8 attracts and activates neutrophiis (PMN), which are then responsible for the capillary leak of ARDS. However, an alternative explanation is that IL-8 is directly toxic to the endothelial cell (EC). In this study, we have hypothesized that IL-8 can disrupt endothelial integrity independent of PMN. Meth ods: Human umbilical vein (HUV) EC monolayers were cultured to confluency on collagen-coated micropore filters. To assess EC integrity, 1251.albumi n leak was quantitated by measuring the 1251 counts which crossed the monolayer, using a gamma counter. IL-8 (lpg/ml) was incubated in the culture medium with 1251.albumi n for 21 hrs. The IL-8 dose was not cytotoxic. To determine the involvement of protein synthesis in this process, selected monolayers were pretreated with cycloheximide (CH) prior to 11.-8 addition. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVMFisher PLSD. We have previously shown that Platelet Activating Factor (PAF) enhances CDt8 expression and primes PMN's for subsequent 02generation. Both are important steps in PMN mediated injury and are assumed to occur in concert. Following major trauma non-specific PMN inflammation is activated, however, unbridled systemic PMN activity needs to be minimized. Since circulating catecholamines are high early post-injury, we hypothesised that they downregu/ate CD 18 expression and PMN priming via the [3 adrenergic signal transduction pathway. Methods: Normal human PMNs were primed with PAF (10ng/ml for 5 min) or pre-treated with 10-5M of Isoproterenol (I) or Forskoklin (F) for 5 rain and then primed with PAF. CD18 expression was measured by flow cytometry (Fig.l) and 02-generation in response to 10-rM fMLP was determined as SOD inhibitable reduction of cytochrome C ( Fig.2 Holler** and Georg W. Bornkamm* Lymphocyte-endothelial interactions are crucial for various immune responses, including cytokine driven inflammatory processes. Protein kinase C (PKC)-inhibitors on the other hand are discussed as potential cytokine antagonists. In the present study we investigated the influence of the PKC-inhibitor GF109203X on cytokine-and endotoxin induced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and on adhesion of lymphocytes to cytokine activated endothelial cells. We found that Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFo0-and Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ICAM-1 expression on human endothelioma celts (EAhy926) were unaffected by the PKC-inhibitor and thus appeared to be independent of PKC activation. In contrast, GF109203X significantly reduced ICAM-1 expression induced by Interferon-y (IFN-?) and Interleukin-1 (IL-1). The functional relevance of these findings was evaluated in an adhesion assay using human umbilical vene endothelial cells (HUVEC) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In fact, the IFN-? and IL-1 induced adhesion of PBMC to cytokine treated HUVEC could be downregulated by the PKC-inhibitor, whereas TNFc~-and LPS-mediated adhesion was not influenced. Additionally, the IL-1 driven ICAM-1 expression on EAhy926 cells as well as the IL-1 induced adhesion of PBMC to HUVEC was found to be TNF-dependent, since both effects could be inhibited by an anti-TNF monoclonal antibody (195F) . These in vitro data further support the idea of examining PKC-inhibitors, such as GF109203X, for their biological relevance in cytokine related dysregulations. Seiffge, D., Bissinger, T., Laux, V., During inflammation there are some key processes, which occur in the microcirculation: The release of mediators from various cell types, the migration of inflammatory cells towards a chemotactic stimulus in the tissue, the expression of adhesion molecules on different cells, and the extravasation of plasma proteins. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the mediator induced interaction of leukocyte adhesion and plasma leakage in postcapillary venules. Using an analogous video-image analysing system we have studied the effect of different mediators on leukocyte adhesion and macromolecular permeability in the mesentery of the rat. The increase in permeability was measured as changes in optical density. We found that topical administration of leneotriene B 4 (LTB4, 5x10 \"6 tool/l) or intravenous injection of interleuldn-2 (IL-2, 5-106 IU/kg b.w.) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 15 mg/kg b.w.) resulted in a significant extravasation of FITC-labelled rat serum albumin (FITC-RSA) in venules but not in arterioles. We could correlate the changes in vascular permeability with a locally increased number of rolling and sticking leukocytes in venules. Both effects were dose dependently inhibited by different drugs. Pentoxlfylline inhibits LPS-indueed FITC-RSA extravasation and leukocyte adhesion at a dose of 3 mg/kg b.w., superoxid-dismutase (SOD, 10.000 IU/kg b.w.) was able to decrease the LTB 4 effect, and the immuumodulating drug leflunomide (HWA 486) exerted inhibitory effects on IL-2-induced permeability at a dose of 3 mg/kg b.w.i.v. The obtained results demonstrate that LPS, LTB 4 or IL-2 induced extravasation of FITC-RSA is mediated by activated leukocytes and can be deminished following administration of different drugs. Platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-i (PECAM-I), a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is constitutively expressed at high levels on the endothelial cell surface. In vitro data have suggested that PECAM-I functions as a vascular adhesion molecule, specifically in neutrophil transmigration across the endothelium. This current work is the first demonstrating the in vivo role of PECAM-1 in neutrophil migration. Blocking antibodies to human PECAM-1, in which the antibodies are crossreactive with rat PECAM-1, were able to block the movement of neutrophils into the rat lungs after IgG immune complex deposition.

To determine this, rats were subjected to sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), following which these and corresponding shams received 3 ml/100g BW normal saline. At 5 hr after CLP (hyperdynamic sepsis) or sham operation, the thoracic aorta was isolated, cut into rings, and placed in organ chambers.

After pre-contraction of blood vessels in the isolated gut with 5xl04 M NE, vascular responses to ACh (5x10 6 M) and an endotheliumindependent vasodiiator, nitroglycerine (NTG, 5xl0 -7 M), were determined.

Methods: In anesthetized female SPRDrats Co.w. 200-230g) shook was induced by fractionated withdrawl of arterial blood within 5 rain and maintained for 1 h (MAP at 40 mm Hg, Cardiac output 50 % of baseline). Rats were adequately resuscitated with 60% of shed blood and twice the volume in Ringer's solution additionally. Following 5 h of reperfusinn (MAP >100 mm Hg, CO >120% of baseline) the microcirculation in liver lobules was examined by intravital fluorescence microscopy after labelling of leukocytes. Continuous administration of IL-lra (Synergen, Boulder, Colorado, 5mg/kg/h) was started at different time points in a randomized and blinded manner. The animals in group P (n=6) received the IL-lra as pretreatment beginning 5 min prior to shock induction. In the group T (n=6) the application of IL-lm started at the beginning of the reperfusion period with a bolus injection of 5 mg/kg and was followed by continuons administration of 5 mg/kg/h. The control group C (n=4) received equal volumes in NaC10,9%, the sham-operated group S (n=4) was not exposed to shock. Results: Macrohemodynamics were comparable in all shook groups. The increased percentage of permanendy adherent leukocytes after hemorrhagic shook (S: 9,1% +1,1%; C: 42,1% _+5,4%) was significantly reduced by pretreatment or treatment with IL-lra (P: 16,9% -+1,9%; p<0.001, T: 28,8% -+3,6%, p<0.01, ANOVA). Temporary adhesion of leukocytes was unaffected by application of IL-lra. Liver microcirculation measured by volumetric blood flow in liver sinusoids and sinusoidal diameters was impaired after hemorrhagic shock in all groups and was not affected (C: 31993iam3/s +40971um3/s, P: 32768llm3/s +4445}am3/s, T: 326211amS/s -+2998 lam3/s, S: 390201am3/s -+39041am3/s). Di.seu~sinn: The results demonstrate that permanent adherence of leukocytes to endothelium is in part regulated by IL-1. Pathological adherence could be reduced by application of ILlra, even given at die time of resuscitation. The effect of lL-lm on permanent adhesion is a specific event and might be caused by reduced expression of specific receptors on sinusoidal endothelial cens and leukocytes. Objectives of the study. The adhesion of activated neutrophils (PMN) to endothelial ceils (EC) and the concomitant production of reactive oxygen metabolites (ROM) initiates organ damage after trauma, sepsis, shock and organ reperfusion. Aien of this study was to investigate the effect on adhesion and ROM production of the highly water-soluble, membrane-permeable and physiological ascorbic acid (ASC). Materials and methods. Adhesion of PMN to nylon fiber (cell count) and simultaneous ROM production (chemiluminescence-CL-response) were measured up to 6 retool/1 ASC as well as adhesion, ROM production and EC damage (lllln-release from labeled EC) of endotoxin-activated PMN to cultered EC moanlayers. In an in vivo animal model (sheep with lung lymph fistulas) the effect of ASC (1 g/kg bw bolus, followed by 0.2 g/ kg-h infusion) on the endotoxin-induced (0.5 Ixg/kg bw) neutropenia (cell count), lung capillary permeability damage (lung lymph protein clearance) and ROM production of neutrophils (zymosan-induced CL response) was measured. Results. ASC scavenged ROM dose-dependently during adhesion of PMN to nylon fiber (p<0.0005 at 6 mmol/l ASC), adhesion itself was unchanged. During the activated PMN/EC interaction ASC scavenged ROM (p<0.025 at 6 mmol/l ASC) and reduced the adhesion dose-dependently (p<0.0005 at 6 mmol/l ASC); EC damage was also reduced (p<0.0005 at 6 retool/1 ASC). In the in rive model ASC increased the endotoxin-induced blood PMN decrease (p<0.05), decreased the protein clearance (p<0.05) as well as the zymosan-induced ROM production (p<0.03), indicating the ASC-mediated reduction of adhesion, ROM production and lung tissue damage processes. Conclusions. By in vitro and in rive experiments ascorbic acid reduced the adhesion-and ROM production-initiated tissue damage. Therefore, i.v. administration of ascorbic acid is recommended for oxidative stress-associated states after trauma, sepsis, shock and organ reperfusion. for neut rophi l-accumulat ion and activation.

Multiple Organ Failure (MOF) has been hypothesized to be the result of an excessive uncontrolled autedestructive inflammatory response. Since the complement system is an important mediator and initiator of the inflammatory response, interruption of this cascade could theoretically lead to an attenuation of MOF. In order to test this hypothesis we evaluated the response of C5-delicient mice in a model of zymesan indt~ed MOF. Materials and Methods. 25 C5-deficient B2D10/OId and 25 C5-sufficient B2D10/New mice were used in this study. On day 0 all mice received an intraperitoneal injection with zymosan suspended in paraffin in a dose of 1 mg/g body weight. Between day 0 and 12, biological parameters (temperature, body weight and clinical condition) were measured daily and mortality was monitored. Clinical condition was assessed by blindly grading the degree of lethargy, conjunctivitis, diarrhea, and ruffled fur of each mouse on a two point scale (maximum score=4). On day 12 all surviving mice were sacrificed and relative organ weights of lungs, liver, spleen and kidneys (relative organ weight= (organ weight/body weight)x100) wore calculated. Earlier experiments with our model have shown a good correlation between histological organ damage and relative organ weights. Statistical analysis of biological parameter was performed using the Koziol curve analysis. Analysis was divided in an acute phase (day 0-4) and a late phase (day 8-12). Relative organ weights were analyzed using Wilcoxon's test and mortality rate using Fischor's exact test. Results. All zymosan injected mice showed a typical triphesic illness. Deterioration of the clinical condition as indicated by the symptom score and the decrease in temperature and body weight in the acute phase were all significantly lass severe in C5 deficient mice (all p<0.005). In the late phase no differences could be noticed in the courses of biological parameters. Overall mortality was 2/25 (8%) in C5 deficient mice and 8/25 (32%) Jn C5 sufficient mice (p=0.049), a difference mainly due to a difference in the acute phase. Organ damage assessed as the relative organ weights did not show any statistical differences for any organ between both strains. Conclusion. Complement factor C5 appears to play an important role in the acute hyperdynamic septic response in this model but deficiency of C5 could not prevent organ damage in the late MOF phase. This suggests that other factors could be more important in the development of the inflammatory response leading to MOF. Proinflammatory cytokines are thought to play a critical role in the pathophysiology of Multiple Organ Failure (MOF). In mice, Zymosan-lnduced Generalized Inflammation (ZtGI) leads to MOF. Therefore we performed a sequential study into plasma levels of, and macrophage production capacity for, four cytokines during the development of MOF in the ZIGI model. Male young-adult C57BL/6 mice received zymosan (1 mg/g body weight) intraperitoneally. Groups of 14 animals were killed after 3, 6, 8, 18 and 24h and subsequently at each day until day 12. Plasma was collected and peritoneal macrophages were isolated and cultured overnight with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Interleukin 1-ct, and -6 (IL-lc~,~,), and tumour necrosis factor-o~ (TNF-c 0 were measured in plasma and culture fluid by means of a RIA (detection limit 0.1 ng/ml).

We have shown that Proenkephalin (PENK), a neuropeptide encoding gene, is expressed in lymphoid cells in culture. To study the physiological significance of these observations we have used the model of experimental endotoxemia. In this model, a disease state is induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), that activates the immune system, the adrenocortical axis and the nervous system. We found that the expression of PENKmRNA is markedly enhanced in vivo immediately after LPS injection both in the adrenal glands and in the lymph nodes. In situ hybridization analysis combined with immunohisto-chemistry indicated that the induced PENK expression is confined to macrephages within the lymph nodes and chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla.

Our research has shown that PGE inhibits B cell activation (specifically enlargement, class II ~C and Fc~ RII expression), proliferation, IgM and IgG3 responses, T cell proliferation, and IL-2 synthesis in the mouse model. In contrast, PGE greatly promotes class switching to IgE,the isotype responsible for Type I allergic hypersensitivity. Thus, our model mirrors th~ general immunosuppression and elevated IgE titers of the trauma or sepsis patient. PGE increases the number of cells secreting IgE and IgGl, acts on surface IgM positive B cells, synergizes with IL-4 and LP$ to induce preswitch germline transcripts, and induces more rapid expression of mature VDJ~ mP~A than in eontro~ PGE intracellular signalling occurs through cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and can be mimicked by cAMP-inducing agents and blocl~ed by an inhibitor of cAMPdependent protein kinase A. PGE action requires de novo protein synthesis and candidate PGE-inducible regulatory proteins have been identified by 2D gel eleetrophoresis. Thus, PGE inhibits a number of immune mechanisms while promoting IgE production. A deeper understanding of PGE immune regulation may lead to more effective treatment of immune perturbations as sequelae of trauma, shock or sepsis. During infrarenai aortic surgery mesetueric traction (re.t.) results in prostacyclin (PGI:) release and consecutively in hemodynamic disturbances (decreased systemic vascular resisteace, mean arterial pressure; increased cardiac output, heartrate). These symptomes are bypassed by cyclooxygenase inhibition. Hemodynamic symptoms vanish after 30-45 rain even without cyclooxygenase inhibition although PGI2 levels remain elevated. To study the endocrine vasopressor system in a prospective double blinded protocol, we investigated 26 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery as compared to 26 ibuprofen (400 rag, i.v.) pretreated (ibu) patients. The surgeon applied m.t. in a uniform fashion. We chose a general anesthesia combined with a supplemental thoracic epidural anesthesia. At the points in time 5, 15, 30, 45, 90, 180, 360 , 1440 rain after and before (to) mesentzrie traction we determined the plasma concentrations (pc) of 6-keto-PGF~o~pr~, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, renin, aldosterone, ADH and cortisol. Pc of 6-k-PGF~,tp~, peaked 5 minutes after m.t. (2274_+284, ibu: 102_+12, to: 60+I ng/l) and declined monotonously over 6 h (203 +_42, ibu: 84_+ 12 ng/1). Catecholamine pc \"s did not exceed the reference range during the observation period. Reninpc peaked after 45 rain (66_+23, ibu: 18+3, to: 16-+2/~U/ml); aldosteronc also presented a maximum after 45 rain (110 + 12, ibu: 66-+ 15, to: 56 +-7 pg/ml), whereas cortisol demonstrated irrespectively of circadian rhythms a maximum 6 h after m.t. (26+_1, ibu: 24-+3, to: 10+_1 ~g/1). ADH pc peaked 5 min after m.t. (71+7, ibu: 20-+6, to: 5+_1 pg/ml) and showed analogously to 6-k-PGFt~j~ pc a monotone decline over the observation period. Our data demonstrate a counteractive reaction to PGIz mediated vasodilation via ADH secretion. The second regulative is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which is activated 45 min after m.t., the aldosterone pc does not paratlel the cortisol pc, which peaked post operafionem in both groups, probably due to the end of anaesthesia. A regulative release of catecholamines could not be documented. The activation of ADH and RAAS after MT is not a hormonal response primaryly related to surgical trauma and/or stress but a counterregulation to systemic vasoditafion induced by prostacyclin. Although ADH and RAAS support systemic circulation, angiotensin and vasopressin may compromise local organ blood flow (e.g. splancimic vascular bed).",

This response is induced by prostacyclin (PGI2). We examined oxygen transport after traction on the mesentery root and the transpulmonary prostacyclin levels in a prospective placebo controlled study with intravenous ibuprofen. METHODS: With approval of the Human [nvestigadon Review Board we studied 52 patients in a prospective, randomized double-blinded protocol who were scheduled for major abdominal surgery. Ibuprofen (400 mg i.v.) or a placebo equivalent was administered 15 minutes before skin incision. Pulmonary artery thermodilution and radial artery catheters were placed after induction of anesthesia. MT was applied in a uniform fashion. Baseline values preceded the incision of the peritoneum (tO). Fulther assessments followed 5, 15, 30, 45, . Tile plasma concentrations (pc) of 6-keto-PGFt, (stable metabolite of PGI2) were determined in arterial and mixed venous blood by radioimmunoassay. At all points in time we measured arterial and mixed venous blood gases. Qs/Qt was calculated by standard formula. Data are given as median (p < 0.05 placebo vs. [ibuprofen] [117] mmHg (*p< 0.0i). These changes were accompanied by a marked increase of 6-keto-PGF~ pc up to 180 rain after MT in arterial and mixed venous blood of untreated patients with a peak of 2450*[60] ng/l tl (*p< 0.00Ol). There was no difference between arterial and mixed venous pc. Ibuprofen pretreated patients (n=zr) demonstrated stabile Qs/Qt and paO2 while 6-keto-PGF~ pc remained within the normal range. DISCUSSION: Our data clearly indicate that mesenteric traction response includes a critical rise in Qs/Qt followed by significant decrease of paOv Stable oxygen transport determinants following cyclooxygenase inhibition signify an action mediated by prostacyclin.

Aim: To determine whether infectious challenge, as CLP alone or combined with TI causes further immune abnormalities in the days following CLP. Study Plan: On day 1, two groups of n=36 8 week old AJ mice were subjected to either a 20% scold burn (TI), or were untreated (C) n=18. On day 10, 18 mice (TI+CLP) and 24 mice (CLP) were subjected to CLP. The two other groups (TI and C) were untreated. At days 11, 12 and 13 after thermal injury splenocytes (SP) were harvested and cultured with ConA for an assay of IL-2 and adherent splenocytes (AS) were cultured with LPS for IL-1, TNF, IL-6 and PGE2. Results: Either TI + CLP or CLP alone result in significantly decreased secretion of all cytokines tested. In the TI group almost every cytokine production determined was elevated in comparison to TI + CLP and Prosmcyclin (PGI2) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of septic shock. However, PGI~'s role in the inflammatory response to sepsis is not well-defined. The purpose of this study was to identify which acute septic events are mediated by PGI 2 during graded bacteremia. METHODS: Eleven ~nesrhetized, hemodynamically monitored adult swine were infused IV with Aeromonas h. (109/ml) at rates increased incrementally from 0.2 to 4.0 mI/kg/hr over 4 hours. Animals were studied in two groups: septic control (SC), graded bacteremia only (n=6); PGA (n=5), graded bacteremta plus anti-PGIz antibody, 50 ml/hr IV, beginning at 2 hours.

The condition of central and peripheral compartments of erythron was studied with unified morphologic, immunogematological, biochemical and radiological methods. It was revealed that irrespective of the experimental animal species (dogs, rats) or in clinical experiments (patients) and irrespective of the injuring factor type (skeletal trauma, craniocerebral trauma, loss of blood) in erythron can be observed one-directed unspecific reaction realized by the considerable lowering of hemoglobin concentration, erythrocytes number and hematocrit. In the initial period (1-7 days) in the system of erythron prevail processes of distraction and elimination of er~zthrocytes relatively to the general production of stimulated erythropoiesis. The primary alterating factor is the prolonged intensification of peroxydation of membrane iipids of erythrocytes with simultaneous lowering of reserves of reduced glutathione. The distraction of erythrocytes is supported by the developing phenomena of autoallergization of organism that becomes apparent by the appearance of sensitized T cells and antierythrocyte antibodies. The intensified production of erythropoietin rules to the realization of he program of fetal and terminal (reserved) erythropoiesis. Failure of erythropoiesis function is supported by disturbances of the processes of the injuring of cell metabolic apparatus. Using of dalargin (15 microgram per kilogram of body mass intrap'eritoneally within 5 days after the trauma) showed the precise pharmacotherapeutic effect revealed by the diminishing of anemia of experimental rats, more . Fiberbronohoscopic procedures are known to produce \"PEEP-like\" effects and to increase pulmonary artery (PA) resistance [2] . PEEP can affect RV function by reducing preload and ejection fraction (EF) [3] . Since changes of RV function during bronchoscopy in septic patients are not reported, we measured RV parameters before, during and after fiberoptic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Method: This 34-year-old patient (APACHE-II:24) developed a hyperdynanlic septic state due to Staphylococcus aureus (blood culture). We inserted a \"fast response\" thermistor PA-catheter (Baxter-Edwards) to evaluate RV performance [4] . The therapeutic procedure included volume replacement, vasopressors (dopamine 5, dobutamine 3 gg/kg/min. IV) and analgosedatior/. Before bronchoscopy (Olympus BF-30, OD=6 mm) the patient received pancmonium for muscle relaxation. Ventilation was not changed during the procedure (endotracheal tube: ID=8 ram, Bennett 7200a, pressure controlled mode, Pm~x=25 mbar, PEEP=8 mbar, I:E=I:I, FiO2=1.0). We measured RV enddiastolic volume (EDV), stroke volume (SV), EF, heart rate (HR), cardiac index (CI) and mean PA pressure (MPAP Gerlach H, Gerlach M, Clauss M, Falke KJ Renal hypoxia and/or ischemia initiates the development of a deteriorated medullary perfusion based on fibrin deposition in the peritubular capillaries, vasoconstriction, and perivascular edema, which is followed by a swelling of the tubular epithelial ceils, intraluminal tubular obstruction, and a backleak of fluid through the injured tubules into the renal interstitium, finally leading to an acute tubular necrosis (ATN) [1 ], clinically diagnosed as acute renal failure (ARF). One important pathway for induction of enhanced vascular procoagulant activity and permeability is based on the synthesis and expression of macrophage-derived cytokines, which bind to specific endothelial cell surface receptors. We recently described the identification and purification .of a new 55,000 Dalton polypeptide, which is synthesized and expressed by murine macrophages after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide, and exerts procoagulant activity on cultured endothelial cells [2] . In the presented study, we demonstrate that the new polypeptid is also synthesized by macrophages under hypoxic conditions. The protein binds to specific receptors, which are expressed by endothelial cells dependent on the environmental oxygen tension. Animal studies were performed after approval by the local committee for animal safety; the animals were anesthetized, treated and supervised in accordance with the guidelines of this committee. In contrast to other authors, who performed long-term hypoxia experiments in awake animals, we preferred to implement the studies under anesthesia for ethical reasons, although regulatory functions for ventilation might be influenced. Animal studies demonstrated that the intravenous injection of the polypeptide initiates fibrin formation in the peritubular vessels. Keeping the animals under hypoxic conditions induces similar effects, which are reduced by a rabbit-antiserum against the new protein. In conclusion, the new polypeptide obviously contributes to the pathogenesis of acute renal failure by tubular necrosis during and after hypoxic events. The use of verapamil as cardioprotective agents for management of patients with acute ischemic/reperfused heart is based on the assumption that the increased intracellular Ca+ level is a key factor in causing cell death. Our in vitro study was designed to focus on effects of verapamil on the metabolic potential of cardiac slices after reversible ischemia in rats. The material consisted of two main groups : group A (non ischemia/reperfusion group) and group B (ischemia/reperfusion group), Each is subdivided into two subgroups (a and b). Each subgroup included 10 rat hearts. Group Aa is the control group, Group Ab is verapami] added group. Group Ba is ischemia group without verapamil. Group Bb is verapamil added group. Ischemic cardiac slices were obtained from rats subjected to 15 min. haemorrhage to induce reversible global ischemia. Both nonischemic and ischemic cardiac slices were placed in well oxygenated krebs Ringer phosphate buffer containing 150 mg% glucose & 5 gm% bovine albumin and incubated in Dubnoff shaking water bath for 60min at 37\u00b0C The results revealed that there was an enhancement in release of free fatty acids (FFA) (240%) and lactate (163%) and in glucose uptake (160%) in group Ba as compared with group Aa. These metabolic alternations produced by ischemic cardiac slices were reversed by verapamil addition (200 ml%) but in group Ab verpamil did not alter the release of FFA & lactate from non-ischemic cardiac slices, whereas it inhibited glucose uptake from these slices by 67%. The improvement of the metabolic intervention of ischemic myocardium indicates that verapamil may be of importance in reducing the extent and severity of acute myocardial ischemic injury in acute haemorrhage. Severe endothelial dysfunction occurs following injury to carotid arteries which is characterized by a decreased ability of these arteries to dilate when challenged with ACh or A23187, but not with a direct vasodilator (NaNO2). This failure to relax to ACh and A23187 reflects an inability of endothelium to generate EDRF, but relaxation recovers gradually to control values by 2 weeks. Exogenous NO donors (e.g., C87-3754 or SPM-5185), accelerate the recovery of the injured endothelium in rat carotid arteries. Intravenous infusion of an NO donor (30 p.g/day) with an implanted osmotic pump significantly accelerated the recovery of regenerated endothelium to produce EDRF at 7 days. Rat carotid artery rings relaxed only 17 + 5% and 15 + 5% to 10 gM ACh in vehicle treated rats and in inactive NO donor treated rats respectively 7 days following injury compared with 67 + 6% in NO donor rats (p<0.001). Relaxation to 100 gM NAN02 was normal in all groups indicating that the differences in relaxation were not the result of damage to vascular smooth muscle. Contraction to L-NAME (1 mM) was markedly reduced by injury, but was protected by NO donors (p<0.01). Thus, exogenous NO donors enhance the ability of the endothelium to regenerate and to release EDRF in response to endothelium-dependent vasodilators. This may be due to an anti-proliferative and anti-mitogenic effect of NO on vascular smooth muscle cells, allowing the endothelium to regenerate without intimal thickening. NO also has been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation, and to attenuate neutrophil adherence and activation. The superoxide scavenging effect of NO is not the basis for these effects since hSOD is inactive in preserving endothelial function in injured arteries. Thus, NO exerts a variety of cytoprotective effects which may be of importance in protecting against vascular injury. Much evidence has now accumulated to show that the excess production of the vasodilator nitric oxide (NO) in sepsis is an important contributor to the hypotension and multiorgan failure characteristic of this condition. Various cytokines play an important role in this process through their ability to induce the production of one of the enzymes responsible for NO synthesis, the inducible NO synthase (iNOS). We have studied the effects of cytokines on the induction of this enzyme both in vitro using vascular smooth muscle cells, and in a murine model of Gram-negative sepsis.",

In order to define the molecular basis for this synergic effect, we have linked the promoter of the iNOS gene to a \"reporter\" gene, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT), and transfected these constructs into vascular smooth muscle cells. Assays of CAT activity reflect the activity of the promoter in this system, and by generating sets of deletion mutants of the promoter sequence we have been able to define the area within the promoter which mediates the synergic effect of these cytokines. In addition to stimufatory effects on iNOS production, certain cytokines are able to down-regulate the production of iNOS in vascular smooth muscle cells, and the effects of these counterregulatory cytokines will be discussed. The interaction of these cytokine effects in the whole organism has been studied in a murine model of Gramnegative sepsis. Widespread induction of iNOS occurs in this model as assayed by enzyme activity and through use of specific antisera to iNOS. Neutralizing antibodies to TNF-~ and tFN-y are both able to prevent death in this model, but it is only the anti-IFN-y which attenuates the induction of iNOS assayed in the liver. Clearly there is some redundancy in the effects of cytokines on the production of iNOS in sepsis, and greater understanding of the most important factors in iNOS production is required in order to target anti-cytokine therapy most appropriately.

Stadler, Department of Surgery, TU MQnchen, FRG Hepatocellular nitric oxide (NO) synthesis is induced by proinflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1 and interferon gamma or by bacterial toxins such as lipopolysaccharide. Stimulation of the hepatocytes (HC) with a combination of these agents leads to an output of NO in quantities which are not seen in any other celltype. It has been demonstrated by various investigators that important effects of these cytokines and bacterial toxins on HC metabolism can be attributed to the action of NO. In contrast to other celltypes HC seem to be relatively resistant to suppression of basic metabolic functions such as energy metabolism by NO. Therefore, cell damage has not been described to a significant extent following exposure to NO. However, NO does inhibit total protein synthesis. The exact biochemical mechanism of this phenomenon has not been uncovered yet, but it has been demonstrated for some specific proteins that their production is inhibited at a posttransscriptional level. As in many other celltypes cGMP generation is elevated in HC by NO through activation of the soluble guanylate cyclase. Cyclic GMP may possibly exert a plethora of metabolic functions, but it is interesting to note that most of the cGMP seems to be transported out of the cell. Some very specific effects of NO on HC metabolism include the inhibition of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Inhibition of GAPDH activity is mediated through nitrosylation of critical domains of the enzymes by NO which enhances auto-ADPribosylation. This effect on GAPDH activity might be responsible for the inhibition of gluconeogenesis by NO, which has been described recently. Finally, NO-mediated inhibition of CYPs may help to explain the suppression of hiotransformation processes which is a characteristic featur,'~ r ~ \"~flamed liver.",

            "text": "Nitric oxide (NO) is an endogenous inhibitor of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) adhesion which limits PMN-endothelial cell interactions under normal conditions. We have previously demonstrated that following ischemia, NO production by the vascular endothelinm is dramatically reduced. Accordingly, we investigated the effects of NO-Donors on PMN accumulation and tissue injury following hemorrhagic shock and ischemia. Hemorrhagic shock was induced in anesthetized rats by bleeding to 35 mmHg for 3 hours followed by reperfusion. Segments of superior mesenteric artery (SMA) were isolated and suspended in organ baths. In rats receiving saline SMA relaxation to acetylcholine (ACh, 100 nM) was reduced by 80% compared to control SMA segments (p<0.01) while relaxation to sodium nitrite (100 gM) was unaffected. In addition, mesenteric tissue PMN accumulation as determined by myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was significantly elevated compared to controls (p<0.0l). Interestingly, treatment with the NO-donating agent, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) significantly preserved SMA relaxation (p<0.01), attenuated mesenteric MPO (p<0.05) activity, and significantly improved survival compared to saline vehicle. In anesthetized, open-chest dogs we investigated the cardioprotective actions of a novel NO-Donor, SPM-5185 (Schwarz Pharma), following regional myocardial ischemia (1 hour) and reperfusion (4.5 hours) . Treatment with SPM-5185 (500 riM) significantly reduced myocardial necrosis by 70% (p<0.01) compared to an NO-deficient analog of SPM-5185, SPM-5267. Furthermore, MPO activity within the ischemic-reperfused zone was also significantly (p<0.01) reduced following treatment with SPM-5185 compared to SPM-5267 (1.6 + 0.5 vs. 3.8 + 0.3 U/100 mg tissue). These data strongly suggest that NO is a potent inhibitor of PMN-mediated tissue injury following hemorrhagic shock as well as in acute myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Overproduction of nitdc oxide (NO') may contribute to sepsis-induced hypotension. During septic shock, excess NO\" is produced by an isoform of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) which is induced by inflammatory mediators. Nonselective NOS inhibitors have been proposed as a new therapeutic approach to treating hypotension in septic shock. We studied the differential hemodynamic effects of N~-methyI-L-arginine (L-NMA), a NOS inhibitor, in normal canines versus those challenged with endotexin (LPS) and compared the activity of this drug across the venous, pulmonary and systemic vascular beds. Awake canines were challenged with LPS (0 mg/kg, n=15:8 mg/kg, n=21 ; or 16 mg/kg, n=30) and treated with L-NMA (0, 1,2, 4,10 mg/kg/hr) for 22 hours following a 0, 10, or40 mg/kg loading dose. Animals were resuscitated with IV Ringers solution (10 ml/kg/hr). Hemodynamic data were collected at 0, 2, 6, 10, 14, and 22 hours using intravascular catheters and radionuclide heart scans and analyzed by ANOVA. In both normal and endotoxemic animals, L-NMA at all doses studied similarly increased mean arterial pressure (p=0.07), and systemic vascular resistance index (p=0.Ol) and decreased cardiac index (p=0.05) and oxygen delivery index (p=0.01). In contrast, the effect of L-NMA on mean pulmonary artery pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and pulmonary vascular resistance index was greater in LPS-challenged canines compared to normal animals (p<0.05), but this differential effect on the venous and pulmonary circulation occurred, >6 hours after LPS challenge. L-NMA did not significantly increase survival rates or times at any of the doses studied (1, 2, 4, or 10 mg/kg/h) in either the low (8 mg/kg) or high dose (16 mg/kg) LPS-challenge groups. A nonsignificant (p>0.2) trend toward a beneficial effect on survival ol low dose L-NMA (1 mg/kg/h) in animals given the 8 mg/kg LPS-cha[lenge was not enhanced by increasing the lethality of the model or by administering higher L-NMA doses. At the highest L-NMA dose used in this study (10 mg/kg/h), survival time decreased significantly for both the low and high dose LPS-challenge animals (p<0.05). This increased mortality was not explained by changes in plasma concentrations of either LPS or TNFc~. Thus, L-NMA did not have a greater effect on the systemic arterial circulation in endotoxemic compared to normal canines. However, in the venous and pulmonary vascular beds, the effect of L-NMA increased with time after endotoxin-challenge These data suggest the induction of NOS activity by endotoxin in canines may be relatively greater in venous and pulmonary vessels compared to systernic arteries. L-NMA, a nonselective NOS inhibitor, did not decrease mortality in endoloxemic canines and the highest dose studied was harmful. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) and arterial hypoxemia are characteristic features of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Reducing pulmonary vascular pressures may promote the resolution of pulmonary edema. Intravenously infused vasodilators lower PH in ARDS, but, as a result of their general vasodilatatory effects, systemic mean arterial pressure may also decrease. Furthermore, blood flow may be increased to non-ventilated or poorly ventilated lung areas resulting in a rise of intrapulmonary shunt, thus causing a further fall in PaD 2. Recently, short term inhalation of low concentrations of the gas nitric oxide (NO), an endogenous endothelium derived relaxing factor, which is rapidly inactivated in blood by hemoglobin, was reported to decrease PH without causing systemic vasodilation in sheep [1]. Similar changes have been observed in patients with severe ARDS during repeated short term inhalation of NO (18 and 36 ppm), which rapidly and selectively decreased the mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and, in contrast to intravenously infused prostacyclin, induced a remarkable increase of PaD2 [2] . This improvement in oxygenation was caused by a redistribution in blood flow away from intrapulmonary shunt areas to normal ventilated lung regions. Continuous NO inhalation (5-20 ppm) consistently lowered the PAP and augmented the PaO2/F.O 2 for up to 53 days. No negative side effects were observed during the whole time span examined. In particular methemoglobin levels always remained below 1.5%. Following these investigations, it could be shown that these effects may also occur using concentrations in the parts per billion range [3] , which may reduce possible toxic side effects. However, in the same study it was demonstrated that the dose-response curves for Pa02 and PAP have different patterns. Whereas PAP presented a continuous dose-dependent downward tendency with an EDs o of approximately 2-3 ppm, the improvement of oxygenation had a maximum at 10 ppm and, at higher doses, drifted back towards the baseline data. The ED~o was estimated at approximately 100 ppb, i.e. more than ten times lower than for the reduction of PAP.",

NO inhalation should be performed using low concentrations which are less toxic, although any possible risks still have to be considered carefully. Dose-response studies for the individual patients are recommended urgently. Finally, controlled randomized studies are required to demonstrate that additional NO inhalation is able to reduce mortality of ARDS. Inhibition of the activity of glyceraldehyd-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), an enzyme of the glycolysis/gluconeogenetic pathway, through ADP-ribosylation is promoted by nitric oxide (NO). Since NO is produced in the septic liver and hypoglycemia is a major problem of late sepsis, it was investigated whether NO interferes with gluconeogenesis of hepatocytes. Hepatocytes (HC) were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats using a collagenase perfusion technique and differential centrifugation. Exogenous NO was applied by incubation with the NO-donors S-nitrosyl-acetylpenicillamine and sodium-nitroprusside. Endogenous NO synthesis was induced by incubation with cytokines (TNFcq IL-1, IFNJ and lipopolysacchafide (LPS). 24 hrs later the incubation medium was changed to a solution containing lactate, ornithine, lysine, ammoniumchloride and glucagon for optimal conditions of gluconeogenesis. After 3 more hrs glucose and nitrite levels were determined spectrophotometrically. GAPDH activity was measured by the NADH-dependent conversion of 1,3-diphosphoglycerate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. Incubation of HC with NO-donors led to a concentrationdependent inhibition of gluconeogenesis and GAPDH activity. However, GAPDH activity was about 5 times more sensitive to the inhibitory effect of exogenous NO. incubation of HC with cytokines and LPS induced NQ synthesis as measured by an increase in nitrite concentrations. Endogenously produced NO suppressed gluconeogenesis by 49_+3%. In contrast to exogenously applied NO, the effect of endogenous NO synthesis was less on GAPDH activity resulting in an inhibition of only 32_+12%.",

Methods: Juvenile pigs were randomized to one of the following treatment groups: 1) Encletoxin and L-NAME, 2) Endotoxin, 3) NaCI and L-NAME, 4) NaCh Preliminary results from groups 1 (n=7) and 2 (n=8) are presented. Catheters for pressure measurement were introduced into the aorta, hepatic and portal veins and ultrasonic transit time flow probes were placed on the hepatic artery and portal vein. A catheter was introduced into the pulmonary artery. Endotoxin (1.7 gg/kg/h) was given as a continous portal infusion over the entire observation period of 8 hrs. L-NAME (25 mg/kg) was given as a bolus after 3 hrs. of endotoxemia. Results: Endotoxin transiently reduced portal vein flow (PVF) by 25%* and hepatic artery flow (HAl e) by 45%*, while L-NAME caused a further and lasting reduction in flow (PVF 78%, HAF 90%)*. Transhepatic (portal-hepatic vein) vascular resistance increased to 3 times baseline value during endotoxemia while L-NAME caused a further marked increase in resistance to 12 times initial value. Portal oxygen saturation (SO2) decreased by 60%* during endotoxemia. L-NAME caused a reduction in portal SO2 by 87%*. Arterial SO2 was unchanged in both groups. Hepatic oxygen uptake was not changed by endotoxin, but was markedly reduced after addition of L-NAME. Endotoxin caused a 27% reduction in cardiac output (CO). The addition of L-NAME reduced CO by a total of 71%*. *: p < 0.05. Conclusion: Is the present model of endotoxemia treatment with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME markedly reduced liver perfusion and portal oxygen supply. This might explain the increased liver damage reported in previous studies using NO-inhibitors. The increase in transhepatic resistance found after L-NAME treatment will tend to cause pooling of blood in the splanchnic veins, resulting in reduced filling of the heart and thus contribute to the observed reduction in cardiac output.",

Three hours of endotoxaemia significantly reduced the contractile effects of noradrenaline (NA) in the thoracic aorta ex vivo. The hyporeactivity to NA was partially restored by in vitro treatment of the vessels with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 20 min, 3x10 -4 M). Pretreatment of rats with TNFab or IL-Ira significantly (p<0.05) prevented the LPS-induced hyporeactivity of rat aortic rings ex vivo. L-NAME did not alter or only slightly enhanced the contractions of aortic rings obtained from TNFab or IL-ira treated LPS-rats, respectively. At 180 min after LPS there was an induction of calcium-independent NOS activity in the lung (5.14-+0.57 pmol citrulline/mg/min, n=8), which was attenuated by TNFab and !L-ira by 37-+6% and 46-+6%, respectively (n=5; p<0.05).

Neal Garrison, MD Objective: Sepsis is often accompanied by organ dysfunction, in part due to impaired microvascular perfusion. Recently, nitric oxide (NO) has been described as an important mediator of the hemodynamic changes of sepsis, and NO synthase (NO-S) inhibitors have been advocated for treatment of septic shock, but their visceral microcirculatory effects are inadequately characterized. We postulated that NO-S inhibition would EXaCErbatE the impaired organ pErfusion of sepsis. Methods: Six groups ofdecerebratE rats were studied. Bacteremia was induced with 109 live E. coli, which consistently increased cardiac output 15-20% above baseline (BL). The NO-S inhibitor Nm-nitro-Larginine methyl ester (L-NAME,1 mg/kg IV), prevented this increase and elevated MAP by 25-30%. In the first 3 groups, total hepatic blood flow (THBF, ml/min by time transit flowmetry) and microvascular perfusion (MI-IBF, \u00bc BL by laser Doppler flux) were measured. In the other 3 groups, in vivo videomicroscopy was used to observe renal microvascular responses (ILA=interlobular artery, AFF=afferent arteriole, EFF=efferent arteriole; % BL for all).

Bacteremia decreased MtlBF but not THBF, and MI-IBF was further impaired by NO-S inhibition. E. coli caused renal preglomemlar, but not postglomerular constriction and reduced flow. L-NAME exacerbated these E. coli-induced alterations and caused EFF constriction. These data indicate that NO-S inhibition exacerbates bacteremia-induced impairment of renal and hepatic blood flow, suggesting that NO is an importam compensatory dilator mechanism in these organs during sepsis. IRF (iron responsive factor) is the central regulatory protein of intracellular iron metabolism able to bind to responsive RNA elements (IREs) present atthe 5'untranslated region (UTR) of ferritin mRNA and 3'UTR of transferrin receptor mRNA. Binding of IRF to IREs results in repression of ferritin mRNA translation and increased stability of transferrin receptor mRNA leading to enhancement of transferrin receptor translation. We describe here that either tetrahydrobiopterin dependent stimulation as well as cytokine (IFN-~)/lipopolysaccharidemediated induction of nitric oxide synthase activates IRF, which is due to direct interaction of nitric oxide with the iron-sulphur-cluster of IRF. This was shown by gene expression studies using a plasmid containing a ferritin IRE and a CAT indicator box which was transfected into K562 myelomonocytic cells, which were shown to have a constitutive form of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Furthermore, the increased binding of 1RE to IRF due to IRF activation of IRF by nitric oxide was demonstrated by gel shift assays. IRF activity was much more increased in cellular extracts from murine macrophages (J774) where a cytokine inducible form of NOS has been characterized earlier as compared with IRF activity in K562 cells, where NOS was stimulated by increasing the availability of the essential NOS cofactor 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin. We then demonstrated that activation of IRF by nitric oxide is accompanied by alterations in ferritin translation as checked by metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation. These results suggest a reasonable mechanism for the regulation of iron disturbances under chronic inflammatory disorders, characterized by increased concentration of immune activation parameters like IFN-5or neopterin and low serum iron and hemoglobin concentrations. Taken Nitric oxide, NO, the putative endothelial derived relaxant factor, EDRF, has been shown to be a potent inhibitor ofplatelet aggregation in vitro. In vivo evidence however, is scarce. Accumulation of platelets in the lungs has been shown to occur during extracorporeal circulation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of inhaled NO on this reaction.

Parallel to this the hemodynamic response in terms of increased pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance was blunted in this group Conclusion: Inhaled NO in this model seems to affect pulmonary platelet sequestration. An associated attenuation of the changes in central hemodynamics was also seen. Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that vascular contractility decreased in endothelium-intact blood vessel rings in early and late stages of sepsis. Although endothelium removal in early sepsis restored vascular contraction, the depressed smooth muscle contractility observed in late sepsis was not restored by endothelium removal. This indicates that impairment of smooth muscleper se may be responsible for such dysfunction in late sepsis. The aim of this study, therefore, was to determine whether or not smooth muscle-derived nitric oxide (NO) plays a role in producing vascular smooth muscle dysfunction during late stages of sepsis. To study this, rats (250-300g, n=4-5/group) were subjected to sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Septic and shamoperated rats then received 3 rrd/100g BW normal saline. The animals were killed at 10, 20, or 35 h post-CLP (10 h post-CLP=early sepsis; 20-35 h post-CLP=late sepsis), and thoracic aortic rings were prepared for contraction studies using organ chambers. The complete removal of endothelial cells was tested by the absence of any significant acetylcholine-induced vascular relaxation. Contractile responses to norepinephrine (NE, 10 9 to 10 -5 M) were determined in the aortic rings without intact endothelium. NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, 300/~M, an inhibitor of NO synthase) was then added to the organ chamber and NE-induced peak contraction was determined before and after the addition of L-NMMA.

In contrast, L-NMMA administration produces an 18% increase (P<0.05) in peak contraction during late sepsis. Therefore, the vascular smooth muscle contractile dysfunction observed at 35 h post-CLP is partially due to smooth muscle-derived NO over-production. Thus, unlike macrophages in which inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is observed in early sepsis, the iNOS in vascular smooth muscle appears prominent only in the late stages of sepsis. In three cases of human septic shock in which NG-monomethyI-L-Arginine, (L-NMMA) a nitric-oxide-synthase-inhibitor was applied, we isolated three completely different types of pathogens: Candida, Pseudomonas aeruginose and multiresistant coagulase-negative staphylococci. This observation suggests that endotoxin alone is not the main factor triggering hypotension in septic shock by the nitric oxide pathway.

Administration of L-NAME before E.coli injection increased the number of bacteria in PLF and TNF level in plasma, The result suggests that NOS inhibitor may depress the host's ability to kill the injected bacteria and that it may induce greater systemic TNF production. We conclude that NOS inhibitor is detrimental to animals in sepsis. The hypothesis that SOD prevents reperfusion injury to the liver by protecting the endogenous endothelium derived vascular relaxing factor (NO) from being inactivated by oxygen free radicals should be investigated. Male Wistar rats were subjected to 60 min of partial liver ischemia (70%) and 30 min of consecutive reperfusion in situ. Some rats were pretreated with the NO synthase inhibitor nitro-L-Arginin (NLA: I0 mg/kg). SOD, when used, was given as Mn-containing preparation at a dose of 6000 U. i.v. i0 min prior to ischemia.

NLA had no ~ffect on untreated animals submitted to the same protocol. These results may suggest, that oxygen free radicals interfe~:e with the endogenous vasodilator NO and that the benefit of SOD can be attribuated in large part to a protection of NO during reperfusion. Nitric oxide (NO) reduces pulmonary vascular resistance and increases oxygenation by inhalation in ARDS patients [1] . Animal studies on the endogeneous NO production proved that NO is exhaled after synthesis in the respiratory tract [2] . With approval by the hospital ethics committee, we studied healthy volunteers and ventilated patients by measurement of inand exhaled NO by NO/NO2-chemiluminescence in segments of the upper respiratory tract. We found that NO is synthesized predominantly in the nose and in the upper nasopharynx, leading to inspiratory tracheal NO concentrations of 0.07-0.13 parts per million in non-smoking volunteers; data during mask ventilation per nose were as follows:",

About 50% of NO is resorbe.d by the lung, and the exhaled NO -in contrast to former presumptions -is the remaining part of the autoinhaled NO. Intubated and ventilated patients are deprived of NO autoinhalation, and the exhaled NO in the trachea decreases more than 95% {O.043 ppm before intubation vs. 0.003 ppm after intubation, ~, < 0.01), whereas the nasal NO concentration increases by cumulation. Hence, low-dose NO inhalation in ARDS patients might be considered as a NO replacement, especially since the tracheal NO concentrations we measured in volunteers are similar to those which could be demonstrated to be effective for ARDS in former studies [3] . The data demonstrate that NO is synthesized in the nose, and inhaled and resorbed by the lung. This phenomenon of NO autoinhalation, which is reduced in smokers and in ventilated patients, does possibly contribute to the regulation of the ventilation-perfusion ratio in the lung. ",

By means of NO-donating agents we studied the mechanism of NO-mediated cytotoxicity against rat liver microvascular endothelial cells. Materials and methods: 3-morphoiinosydnonimine-N-ethylcarbamide (SIN-l) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were used as NO. donators, LDH release and trypan blue exclusion were applied to indicate cell viability. Results: SIN-1 (5mM), which releases both NO. and O2-., caused a time-dependent cytoreduction of 60% and 80% after 3 and 6 hrs, respectively. This effect was not inhibited by superoxide dismutase (SOD), which removes 02--to form H202 and 02. In contrast, the addition of catalase (CAT), which removes H202 to form H20 and 02, diminished the cytotoxic effect ot SIN-1 to 30%, equivalent to high concentrations of SNP (20mM), which solely releases NO.. In addition, the amount of H202 formed by 5mM SIN-1 equaled the amount ot enzymaticany produced H202 by 5mU/L glucose oxidase (GOD). Whereas GOD in this concentration and SNP in low concentration (5mM) alone were not toxic to endothelial cells, the combination caused an 80% reduction of viability, comparable to the effect observed with SIN-1 (5mM) alone. Moreover, toxicity mediated by high concentrations of SNP (20mM and 50raM) was reduced by 20% under hypoxic conditions indicating synergism with NO-and 02. Conclusions: We conclude, that NO.-induced toxicity against endothelial cells is enhanced slightly in the presence of oxygen and is not due to an interaction with 02-. However, toxicity increases dramatically in the presence of H202. This may possibly occur either by a chemical formation of more potent reactive hydroxyl radicals or by independent actions on different cellular targets. ",

Materials and Methods: NO-production was induced in the murine macrophage cell line J774 with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [llJg/ml] and interferon ;f (IFNy) [200U/ml]. After 18 hours of incubation NO-release was determined as nitrite (NO2) by using a colorimetric assay based on the Griess-reaetion. Results: Preincubation of cells with the PKC-inhibitors staurosporine (STP), chelerythrine, bisindolylmaleimide (BIM) and D609, that recently has been identified as a selective inhibitor of PC-PLC, diminished significantly LPSand ]FNT-induced NO2-production (p<O,001). Although we observed no toxic effect on cell viability, NO2-production was related to protein concentrations to exclude any inhibitory effect on celt growth. Celts preincubated with STP [lO0nM] released 20% less NO 2 in response to LPS and IFN,[ compared to control cells cultured without inhibitor. Chelerythrine [30}JM] and BIM [IOIJM] reduced the NO2-formation by 50% and 85%, respectively. Interestingly, the most potent inhibitor of NO-production turned out to be the xanthate D609 Cells pretreated with D609 [301~g/mt] released 96% less NO 2 than stimulated controls The inhibitory effect on NO 2production decreased the later the inhibitore were added after stimulation; e.g. BIM added 6 and 12 hours after stimulation reduced NO2-production only by 50% and 12%, respectively. Accordingly, iNQS activity present in stimulated cell lysates supplemented with L-arginine and co-factors was not suppressed by the inhibitors tested. Conclusions: Our findings suggest, that the induction of iNOS but not its activity is a PKC and particularly PC-PLC dependent process.",

IL6 is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of various diseases. Therefore, specific inhibitors could have therapeutic value. A human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody to IL6 has been applied in a phaseI clinical trial in patients with multiple myeloma and in primate models of sepsis. No toxicity was observed and the most remarkable outcome of this study was the build up in the circulation of IL6-anti-IL6 complexes, suggesting that plasma IL6 measurements represent a gross underestimation of IL6 production in the patient. Until now no natural antagonists of IL6 have been described. The biological activities of IL6 results from binding to a lowaffinity IL6-receptor (IL6R). The IL6/IL6R complex induces disulfide-linked homodimerization of the signal transducing receptor component, gp130. Studies on the structure-function relation of IL6 revealed that disruption of the gpl30-interaction site on IL6 gives rise to a mutant IL6 that, by virtue of its intact binding to the IL6R, acts as a potent antagonist on human hepatocytes and on human B cells. In vivo studies using this molecule will be initiated in the near future. The evolution of infla~ation involves a dynamic series of cellular events controlled by specific signals which are important to the initiation, maintenance, and final resolution of the inflammatory response. The various phases of inflammation are influenced via the expression and subsequent regulation of a number of key mediators which play a predominant role during each particular stage of the developing lesion. For example, the initial elicitation of blood born leukocytes to on inflamed area is a complex system that is dependent upon the expression of early response cytokineSo These proximal mediators, including both interleukin-i (IL-I) and tumor necroisis factor (TNF), are important in the initiation phase by activating both immune and non-immune cells and establishing a series of cytokine networks, Thus, the above proximal mediators can stimulate endothelial cells, epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts to generate more distal cytokines. These latter cytokines include interleukin-8 (IL-8), macrophage inflammatory protein-i (MIP-I), and monocyte cbemoattractant protein-i (MCP-I). The importance of the above chemukines can be found in the role they play in leukocyte elicitation, as well as wound repair. Numerous investigations have shown the diverse cellular sources of IL-8 and the ability of IL-8 to elicit neutrophils in vitro at pM to nM concentrations, however, recent studies have sho%~ an additional role for IL-8 during the resolution phase of the inflammatory process. Using corneal pocket animal models of angiogenesis/neovascularization, IL-8 was found to be a potent angiogenic factor at concentrations ranging from 2-40ng/ml. Sequential fluorescein angiograms demonstrated that IL-8 induced neovascularization by 14 days, which regressed by 6 weeks. In further analyses, both conditioned media recovered from either inflamed human heumatoid synovial tissue macrophages or LPS-stimulated peripheral blood monocytes were found to possess potent angiogenic activity, which was effectively blocked by neutralizing antibodies directed against human IL-8. In addition, an IL-8 antisense nligomunclentide blocked the expression of a functionally active angiogenic factor from LPS treated monocytes. The above data demonstrate that IL-8 has multifumctional activities during the initiation, maintenance, and resolution of a local inflammatory response.",

This notion is supported by recent studies which indicated that IL-10 also prevents lethal LPS-induced toxic shock in mice. Five of the chamekines (HIP-I~,eRA~TES.

The 8 chemoklnes and IP-IO were also sho~rn to promote the adherence of ~he same subsets of anti-CD3 activated T cells to ILI activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HITVEC).

Presumably, chemokines as regulators of the adhesion, migration and homing of all kinds of leukocytes participate in many types of inflammatory diseases. Natural killer cell stimulatory factor or interleukin-12 (IL-12) is an heterodimerie cytokine formed by two covalently linked glycosylated chains of 35kD and 40 kD. IL-12 was originally purified from the supermatant fluids of EBV-transformed human B ly~phobiastoid cell lines. However, in addition to B cells, phagocytic cells, i.e. monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils, have been identified as the major physiological producers of IL-12. Phagocytic cells produce IL-12 in response to bacteria, bacterial products such as LPS, and intracellular parasites. The cell types on which IL-12 exert biological activity are T and NK cells. The major direct biological function of IL-12 on these cell types are the induction of cytokine production, primarily IFN-y, the enhancement of a generation of cytotoxic cells, and a mitogenic effect on antlgen-activated lymphocytes.",

The ability of IL-12 to induce IFN-y production from circulating. NK cells and at least a proportion of T cells determines a rapid, antigen-independet production of IFN-y during infections. IFN-y acts as a potent enhancer of phagocytic and bacteriocidal activity of phagocytic cells, participating early in infection to activate some of the inflammatory mechanisms that represent the first innate resistance against infection. This antigem-independet activation of phagocytic cells that involves, in addition to IL-12, other monocyte derived cytokines such as TNF and IL-l, has been shown to be important in experimental animals for the resistance against infection by microorganisms such as Limteria monocytogens and Toxoplasma gondii. In addition to this role, early in infection in the antigen-independet phagocytic cell activation, IL-12 has a major effect in the ensuing antigenspecific admptive immune response by facilitating the generation of T helper type 1 (TH-I) response and suppressing a Th-2 response. The presence of IL-12 during antigen stimulation in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes, or both in vivo and in vitro in experimental animals, induces generation of Th-i cells producing IFN-y and IL-2, and inhibits the generation of Th-2 cells producing IL-4. IL-12 induces a direct differentiative effect on Th-cells, priming them for high IFN-y production. ~is priming effect is stable and maintained even when T cell clones are cultured for extended periods in the absence of IL-12, however, IL-12 needs to be present during the first few days after stimulation with antigen or mitogen and established Th clones are resistant to the priming effect of IFN-y. Unlike the generation of high IFN-y producing clones, the IL-12-mediated inhibition of IL-4 producing cells in probably due to selective mechanisms, which may include a selective mitegenic effect of IL-12 for Thl cells and an inhibitory effect of IFN-y on Th2 cell proliferation. In several experimental systems, it has been shown that the enhancing effect of IL-12 on Th-i responses is dependent on production of IF~-y and on the presence of NK cells, possibly needed for the early production of IFN-y. The importance of phagocytic cells and NK cells in determining the characteristics of the Th response during antigenic stimulation indicated that the mechanisms of innate resistance have a determining influence on the subsequent antigen-specific immune response: IL-12 appears to have a key role in mediating the interaction between phagocytic cells.

Human IL-13 is a non-glycosylated protein of 132 aa with a molecular mass (Mr) of 10 kD and has biological activities on monocytes and B cells, IL-13, like IL-4, strongly enhanced the expression of class II MHC antigens on monocytes and induced expression of CD23 (Fc~RII). Furthermore, IL-13, like IL-4 and IL~10, inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, ]L-6, TNFo~ and chemokines MIPlc~ and tL-8 by LPS activated monocytes. Both IL-13 and IL-4 enhanced the production of IL-lra by monocytes. In contrast, IL-13 lacked the T cell stimulating activities of IL-4. The responses of monocytes to IL-13 and IL-4 were not additive or synergistic, supporting the hypothesis that IL-13 and IL-4 receptors are complex and share a common component which is important for signal transduction, Taken together, these data indicate that IL-13, IL~4 and IL-10 have important anti-inflammatory activities on human monocytes. In addition, these results indicate that IL-13 is unique in that it can modify inflammatory reactions without stimulating (as does IL-4) or inhibiting (as does IL-10) T cell responses. Transforming growth factor beta I (TGF-fll) belongs to a family of proteins that have potent immunoregulatory properties ranging ftom effects on the growth and dfflerentiafion of primitive stem cells to the differentiated functions of immune system effector cells. TGF-I~I is synthesized as a large secretory precursor polypeptide of 390 amino acids that is inactive until processed to a disulfide linked homodimeric molecule of 1t2 amino acids each. Recently it has been found that TGF-[~I can have autocrine as well as paracrine effects on the immune system indicating that immune cells can activate the inactive secreted form of TGI~-~I. In addition, TGF-I~I has differential intraceUular effects on cell surface receptor modulation, tyrosine phosphorylation and cytokine gene transcription as well as cell mediated cytotoxicity. The systemic administration of TGF-131 has proven beneficial in a variety of animal models such as septic shock, allograft rejection and experimental forms of autoimmunity including collagen induced arthritis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Moreover the increased levels of TGF-Ill and other TGF-13 isoforms found in several disease states associated with immunosuppression such as different forms of malignancy, chronic degenerative diseases and AIDS implicate the involvement of TGt~-I~ in the pathogenesis of some diseases. Hopefully, well designed clinical trials will define the potential roles of the TGF-[3 family of proteins in the treatment of diseases of man. Patient development of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIS) after severe trauma is accompanied by a wide range of immune aberrations and altered cytokine production. In particular, T lymphocyte proliferation and IFN, t production is suppressed while monocyte (MO) TNFc~, IL-6, PGE2 and TGF~ production is massively increased concomitant to decreased antigen presenting capacity. Recently, two new cytokines, IL-10 and IL-12, have been characterized as critical in regulation of MO TNFa and IL-6, as well as in induction of T lymphocyte proliferation and IFN 7 production. In this study, peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) from severe trauma patients (Injury Severity Score >35) were analyzed for their IL-10 levels, their in vitro proliferation to mitogen (PHA) and their response after IL-12 addition. Since IL-10 produced either by MO or by T lymphocytes can depress M~ antigen presenting capacity, inhibit T cell IFN,/production and directly diminish T cell proliferation, it might be suggested that immunosuppressed patients' MO and/or T lymphocytes would have increased IL-10 levels. Increased patient IL-10 production might also be resulting from the high levels of TNFa a known stimulator of IL-10. Conversely, since IL-12 augments MO antigenpresenting capacity, Thl induction and proliferation, post-trauma leukocytes might be IL-12 deficient. PBL of trauma patients were compared to normals' PBL, either unstimulated or PttA induced, and their levels of IL-10 found to be dramatically and significantly reduced. Patients' isolated M~, either stimulated with the bacterial cell wall analogue, MDP, or unstimulated, also had depressed IL-10 production concomitant to elevated TNFa production when compared to normals' MO. Mechanisms for the depressed patients' MO IL-10 were explored. Increases in TGF[3 may have partially contributed to the patients' depressed IL-10 level, but elevated PGE2 had no effect. Addition of IL-12 to patients' PBL significantly increased their mitogen responses. These data imply that SIS is characterized by disruption in the interactions between MCi and T lymphocytes so that patients' M~i produce excesses of some mediators (TNFa, IL-6, PGE2) and a dearth of other monokines (IL-12, IL-IO). T lymphocytes are not activated and, therefore, unable to function in both immune defense and monocyte regulation. It is known that lgE receptor-mediated or Ca-ionophore-induced activation of mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (13MMC) may result in the production of different cytokines including the interleukins (IL) 3, 4, 5, and 6 as well as GM-CSF and TNF-a. In the present study we analyzed the effects of exogeneously applied pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, 1L-6, TNF-c 0 as well as various mast cell growth factors (IL-3, IL-4, IL-9, IL-10, NGF, KL (kit ligand)) on cytokine production in primary mouse BMMC using a standard activation protocol (lxl06 BMMC/ml; ll.uM ionomycin; 24-48h). The actixdties of BMMC supernatants were assessed in specific biological (IL-3, IL-4 IL-6, 1L-9) and/or ELISA assays (IL-5, IL-9). Here we show that homogeneous populations of BMMC (>97%Alcian blue+/Safranln-; in vitro age: 4 weeks) generated in the presence of recombinant (r) raiL-3 from normal BALB/c mice produced modest amounts of 1L-6 and low or undetectable levels of IL-3, -5, and -9 after induction with lp.M ionomycin only. However, a dramatic increase (5-to 10-fold) of these cytokine activities was noted, when in addition to ionomycin also human (11) rlL-la was provided during the induction period. This IL-1 effect was dose dependent with a maximgm at 2-10 U/ml hrlL-la and specific, as pre-incubation (lh) of BMMC with 20 ng/ml hrlL-1 receptor antagonist abolished the action of 2 U/ml hrlL-lcc Similar effects were noted with hrlL-lg or rurlL-lB (lng/ml, respectively), but not with rhlL-6 or rmTNF-~. Both mrlL-10 and hrlL-10 substantially enhanced ionomycin-induced 1L-6 production of BMMC in the absence or presence of IL-1. IL-10 significantly enhanced IL-6 and IL-9 production while decreasing IL-3 activities to abont 50-90% of control levels, when IL-I0 was provided in the presence of IL-l/ionomycin. A monoclonal anti-nfiL-t0 antibody (ascites 1:200) abrogated the effects of mrlL-10. Other mast cell-active cy~okines (]1,-3, IL-4, 1L-9, NGF, or KL) added to ionomycia-or 1L-1/ionomycin-treated BMMC had no major effects on cytokine production. IL-1 and IL-I0 did not induce significant cytokine release in the absence of ionomycin suggesting tlmt Cadependent signalling was required. At doses of 10\"6M, dexamethasone, corticosterone, or hydrocortisone almost completely abolished ionomycin/IL-1/lL-10induced cytokine production. The inducer cocktails per se did not interfere with the cytokine bio-assays. In case of IL-9 inducibility of this cytokine in BMMC was confirmed at the mRNA level by Northern blot analysis. Hence our data show that activated mast cells are a source of IL-9 previously recognized as a product of TH2type lymphocytes only. Moreover, our study reveals novel functional roles for I-L-I, IL-10, and ghicecorticoids in the regulation of cytoldne production in mast ceils. Accumulating data suggests that cytokines, peptides involved in regulation of both physiological and pathological immunological responses, predominantly are produced at the local site of antigen stimulation. A new method was used to detect cytokine-producing cells in haman tissue at the protein level. Single-cell production of 17 different httman cytokines, ILia, ILl [3, ILlra, IL2, IL3, IL4, IL5, IL6, ILS, ILl0, GM-CSF, TNFa, IFN 7 and TGF[31.3, was identified by indirect immunohistochemical staining procedures and use of carefully selected cytokine-specific mAb's. Frozen sections were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and permeabilized by 0.1% saponin treatment, eluting cholesterol from the membranes. The intracellular presence of all cytokines except ILl, ILlra (late) and TFG[31_3, could be demonstrated by a characteristic perinuclear configuration in producer cells. In addition, the immunoreactivity extended over a large extracellular area encompassing the producer cell. A localization of the cytokine to the Golgi-organelle was established by use of two culour staining including a haman Golgi complex specific mAb. This staining pattern was only evident in producer cells because injection of recombinant human cytgkines into the tissue caused a membraneous and extracellular staining pattern. Both the extra-and the intracellular types of staining reaction could, however, be blocked by preincubating the cytokine specific mAb with pure human interleukins. Oxygen radicals (OR) directly induce lipid peroxidation, indirectly they trigger adhesion and activation of PMN leukocytes. We investigated whether OR also lead to a release of acute-phase response cytokins such as TNF-alpha, IL-I beta or IL-6 in whole blood cultures to maintain the induced inflammatory reaction.",

Transforming growth factor-I~l (TGF-131) is released from inflammatory ceils following injury and in sepsis. In vitro experiments have confirmed that low concentrations of TGF-131 (0.1-1.0 ng/ml) are chemoattractive for monocytes, whereas higher levels of TGF-131 (>5.0 ng/ml) potentiate production of the immunedepressive prostaglandin E 2. Other investigators have shown that TGF-]31 can cause the appearance of CD16 (Fc immunoglobulin receptor) on monocytes exposed to 10 ng/ml of TGF-[~I for 24 hours. Monocytes also express on their surface a glycoprotein that binds complexes of lipopolysaceharide (LPS) and LPSbinding protein (LBP). Such binding is associated with generation of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha. We have shown that CD14 is depressed in septic patients and therefore we hypothesized that TGF-131 could account for the down-regulation of CD14 observed in these individuals. We incubated normal human monocytes with platelet-derived TGF-[31 for 2 and 24 hours at 37\u00b0C and examined ceils for CD14 and CD16 expression using flow cytometry after immunnfluoreseent staining with appropriate monoclonal antibodies. Monocytes were selected on the by usual criteria for size and granularity. Non-viable ceils were excluded with the use of propidium iodide. Two populations of monocytes could be found afcer incubation at 37\u00b0C alone. One displaying high density of CD14 had increased fluorescence over the homogeneous expression of CD14 in cells maintained at 4\u00b0C (baseline). The other population displayed decreased CD14 expression relative to the baseline cells. TGF-I~I (10-50 ng/ml) caused a shift of ceils from the high density into the low density CD14 population. This trend was observed within 2 hours of incubation and was complete by 24 hours. We observed a net decrease in CD14 expression 0f32% for all subjects studied (p<0.05 vs controls). Phorbol myristate acetate (100 ng/ml) also caused down-regulation of CD14 to a similar degree as TFG-I~I. We also confirmed that monocytes could be induced to express CD16 after incubation with TGF-131 (10 ng/ml) for 24 hours. These studies demonstrate that monocytes incubated with immunodepressive levels of regulation of CD14 by TGF-131 deplete their surface expression of CD14 while generating CD16. This down-regulation of CD14 by TGF-131 correlates with our clinical observations of lower CD14 expression on monocytes obtained from septic patients. For over 25 years, activated T lymphocytes have been considered to be the cellular source of MIF. We recently isolated and cloned the murine homolog of MIF after identifying the specific secretion of this protein by LPSstimulated pituitary cells in vitro and in vivo. However, further experiments showed that MIF protein is detectable both in T-cell deficient (nude) and hypophyseetomized mice, suggesting that yet additional cell types may produce MIF in vivo.",

We found that MIF is expressed constitutively in the murine macrophage-line RAW264.7 and in thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages. Significant amounts of MIF mRNA (RT-PCR) and protein (Western blotting) were observed in cell lysates. In RAW 264.7 cells, MIF secretion was induced by as little as 10 pg/ml of LPS (E.coli 011 l:B4), peaked at 1 ng/ml, but was not detectable at LPS concentrations >1 txg/ml. Similar data were obtained with elicited macrophages, but higher LPS concentrations were required, unless the cells had been preincubated with IFN 7. Production of MIF by LPS-stimulated (l ng/ml) macrophages peaked at 12 hr. Expression ofMIF mRNA and TNF mRNA by LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages was investigated by RT-PCR. As expected TNF mRNA expression increased over the range of LPS concentrations (1 pg/ml to 1 p_g/ml). In contrast, levels of MIF mRNA correlated inversely with LPS concentration. By competitive PCR, MIF mRNA was observed to increase approximately 2-fold after LPS induction (100 pg/ml). MIF secretion also was induced by TNFoc (1 ng/ml) and IFN?

            "text": "However, other cells, including polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) do contribute to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We investigated the capacity of the so-called anti-inflammatory cytokines to control the release of IL-8 by activated neutrophils. Human PMN were purified following glucose-dextran sedimentation and FicolI-Hypaque centrifugation. The cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C for 24h in the absence or presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or TNFa. IL-8 release was measured in the supernatants using a specific ELISA. Among tested cytokines, IL-10 was the most efficient inhibitor of IL-8 production by LPS-activated PMN. IL-4 was also active, whereas no down regulation was noticed with TGFP~I. When TNFa was used as a triggering agent, none of the cytokine could prevent IL-8 production. Northern analysis are under investigation to precise the level of the IL-4-and IL-10-induced inhibition of IL-8 production by PMN. Our data illustrate that IL-10 and IL-4 possess the capacity to down regulate the production of IL-8 by both monocytes and PMN, whereas TGFB has a more limited inhibitory activity. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), a member of the IL-6 superfamily, has recently been shown to promote axonal growth and neuronal healing. CNTF production is also increased during neuronal and muscle damage, associated with soft tissue injury or trauma. We postulated that production of CNTF may explain the loss of skeletal muscM protein that occurs in inflammation. 40 female, Wistar (175-200 gm) rats received either 250 or 25 pg/kg BW s.c. injections of recombinant rat CNTF for seven days, or received sham injections and were freely-fed. Additional animals were pretreated with 10 mg/kg ibuprofen Lp prior to 250 pg/kg BW CNTF. Rats treated with 250 ,ug/kg BW CNTF lost 6.8_+0.4 gms BW as compared to freely-fed controls which gained 17.0_+3.1 gms (p<O.001 by ANOVA and LSD), and ibuprofen treatment had no effect on CNTF-induced weight loss (-5.8_+0.7). Animals pair fed to the high dose CNTF gained body weight (10.2-+3.5), although weight gain was less than seen in freely-fed controls. Rats treated with 25 pg/kg BW had reduced body weight gain (+7.8+_4.4 gin). Food intake was also reduced by 29% in 250 pg/kg CNTF (from 23.7+_0.7 gm/day to 16.8_+0.6 gm/day; p<O.05) and was also unaffected by prior ibuprofen treatment (18.4+-0.6 gm/day). Despite the loss in body weight noted in the high dose CNTF animals, there was no appreciable hepatic acute phase response, since liver weight (8.6+0,1 gms vs. 9.4_+0.3 gins), total protein (54.5+-2.9 gms/L vs 44.8+-3.6 gins/L) and albumin (29.0+1.5 gms/L vs. 26.0+_1.6 gms/L) were not different between CNTF and freely fed animals. We conclude that CNTF causes anorexia, and increases body weight loss in excess of the associated anorexia. Unlike the cachexia associated with IL-1 and TNF infusions, which is associated with an acute phase response, CNTF acts predominantly on food intake and carcass weight through a prostaglandin-independent mechanism and has only minimal acute phase inducing properties, N.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) constitutes a well established activator of monocytes/ macrophages (MIZI) and murine B lymphocytes. The hydrophobic part of LPS, termed lipid A, represents the endotoxic principle of LPS. We now demonstrate that LPS is also capable of inducing proliferation of human T cells at a dose of 10 to 1000 pg/ml. The specificity of this stimulation was analysed by the following experiments: i) The synthetic hexaacyl Escherichia coiltype lipid A (compound 506) also stimulated human T cells; ii) the synthetic tetraacyl lipid A precursor (compound 406) or the 1phosphono-oxyethyl analogue PE-4, structures known to antagonize LPS-induced monokine production in human MZ, also inhibited LPSinduced T-cell proliferation. The T-cell proliferation expressed the following features: i) CD4 \u00f7-as welt as CD8 \u00f7 T cells proliferate in response to LPS, ii) limiting dilution analyses reveal that the frequency of responding cells was between 1/500 to 1/1000 cells; iii) purified T cells alone cannot be stimulated by LPS, but need the help of monocytes. This help cannot be replaced by B cells or fixed monocytes. Furthermore, for activation a direct cell-to-cell contact between T cells and monocyte is neccessary; iv) T cells stimulated with LPS express mRNA for IL-2 and IFNF, but not for IL-4 or IL-5 (determined by PCR). In supernatants, IFNF was detectable (ELISA); v) LPS-activated CD4 \u00f7 as well as CD8 + T cells express CD25, the high affinity IL-2 receptor. Our results indicate that in contrast to previous reports human T cells respond to LPS with IL-2 receptor expression, lymphokine production, and proliferation. The reactive cells appear to belong to the T,1 cell type, The finding that human T cells can be activated by LPS is of important relevance for the understanding of the pathomechanisms of infections by Gramnegative bacteria. This may lead to new strategies for the therapy of sepsis. We have recently shown that human eosinophils produce mRNA for interleukin (IL)-8 when stimulated with calcium ionophore (Eur. J. Immunol. 23 (1993), 956). We now present evidence that human eosinophils contain preformed IL-8 protein although they do not express mRNA for IL-8 as measured by RT-PCR. IL-8 protein expression was determined using specific anti-human IL-8 monoclonal antibodies by Western blotting, FACS analysis and immunohistochemistry. Moreover, preformed IL-8 was re/eased into supernatant by 99% pure eosinophils after priming with GM-CSF or IL-5 and subsequent 25-min stimulation with PAF, RANTES, ionomycin or PMA, however not with IL-1 or IL-2, as measured by ELISA. This observation implies that activation of protein kinase C and/or intracellular calcium mobilization are necessary events for IL-8 release in human eosinophils. The determined amounts of preformed IL-8 protein was higher in patients with asthma compared to normal individuals suggesting a role for eosinonhi! derived IL-8 in asthma. Since the eosinopnit is the ,,r~:=z~mmant cell in the asthmatic airways, we determined IL-8 concentrations in bronchoaIveolar lavage (BAL. ~ids from normal !i~.~iJvtduals and asthmatic patients. Indeed, IL-8 concentrations in BALs from both groups were similar to those seen in the supernatants released by activated eosinophils. The role for IL-8 in asthma remains to be determined. ",

            "text": "Based on a well established rat model named activity-induced ulceration (ASU) or activity based anorexia (ABA), we have developed a rat model for chronic stress. Male rats were exposed to a feeding schedule in order to reduce body weight by 20-30% within 14 days. While one group of rats was kept sedentary, the other had access to a running wheel. Food restricted rats allowed to exercise developed highly increased activity as compared to ad libitum fed rats in wheels (ca. 15 versus 2 kin/day). They developed elevated plasma corticosterone levels (30_+5gg/dl) at their circadian peak, increased adrenal weight and decreased thymus and spleen weight as compared to control rats and weight matched sedentary rats, establishing this paradigm as a model of chronic stress. No differences in plasma ACTH were seen among the various groups, suggesting increased sensitivity of the adrenal glands to ACTH. The effect of chronic stress accompanied by hypercorticism on baseline and endotoxin-induced cytokine levels was studied in this model. Under baseline conditions,splenic IL-1 a was suppressed in both food-restricted groups. This was more pronounced in rats with access to a running wheel. IL-6 and TNF activity in plasma was not affected. After administration of 1001.tg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS), TNF activity in plasma was suppressed by food restriction but there were no differences between sedentary or exercising rats. In addition, no differences were found among groups for corticosterone, spleen IL-lc~ and plasma IL-6 activity. We conclude, that the food restriction-induced hyperactive rat model is a useful model for studies on the effects of chronic stress. In this model, under basal conditions IL-le~ in tissues may be subject to downregulation by glucocorticoids, whereas after LPS-stimulation of cytokine production only TNF activity is regulated by fast acting feedback loop between cytokines and the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis). This is supported by strong correlations between plasma TNF activity and corticosterone in stressed rats. Cytokine antagonists modulate cytokine actions and it appears that a balance between production of cytokines and cytokine antagonists is important to control of host responses. Recent observations show that during myocardial infarction there is an increase in circulating cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). We tested the idea that compensatory increases in cytokine antagonists likewise occur and investigated changes in plasma concentrations of TNF and interleukin i (IL-1) and those of their specific antagonists interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1 ra) and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor type I (s TNF r-I). We also measured plasma concentrations of ~-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (~-MSH), an endogenous neuropeptide that occurs in pituitary, brain, skin, gut and other tissues. When administered to laboratory animals, this peptide has potent antiinflammatory and antipyretic activity, perhaps by mimicking an endogenous modulatory influence on cytokine actions. Samples were obtained from 20 patients with acute myocardial infarction at presentation in the Coronary Unit, every three hours for 24 hours, and daily thereafter until discharge. We found elevations in the plasma cytokines IL-1 and TNF only in a proportion of subjects whereas cytokine antagonists c~-MSH, IL-lra, and sTNFr were elevated in all patients, o~-MSH was elevated at presentation but it decreased progressively in successive tests, reaching normal values within 24 hr whereas sTNFr and 1L-lra peaked at 3-6 hr or later. There were significant correlations between plasma concentrations of cytokine antagonists and enzymes released from injured myocardium, including creatine kinase (CK), aspartate serum transferase (AST), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The data show that cytokine antagonists increase in the circulation of patients with acute myocardial infarction likely to modulate prninflammatory effects of cytokines. Objects of the study: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifunctionai cytokine known to be involved in important homeostatic processes. IL-6 levels are increased in many pathological situations, and correlates with disease activity and patient outcome. To exert its effect IL-6 binds to its receptor on the membrane of its target cell. This receptor is also present in a soluble form in plasma and in urine. In this study we quantitatively measured the availability of soluble IL-6 receptor (slL-6R) in biological fluids in healthy volunteers. Materials and methods: Blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and synovial fluid (SF) are obtained from healthy volunteers, sIL-6R and IL-6 are measured using ELISA's. Both ELISA's are tested for interference of sIL-6R mid IL-6. The effect of slL-6R in the IL-6 bio-assay (B9) is tested. Results: Baseline levels are (mean + SD): 76.6 -+ 19.3 ng/ml in serum, 3.7 -+ 1.3 ng/ml in urine, 1.64 _+ 0.4 ng/ml in CSF and 11.6 + 3.3 ng/ml in SF. There is no interference of slL-6R in the IL-6 ELISA or bio-assay and no interference of 1L-6 in the sIL-6R ELISA. Conclusions: In all investigated biological fluids slL-6R can be found. These data provide baseline values for investigations concerning pathological situations. Both ELISA's described are useful tools to do these investigations. Trauma-associated immune aberrations coincide with augmented release of immunoregulatory and proinflammatory cytokines. The present study examines the effect of thermal trauma on the capacity for specific (receptormediated) response of lymphoid cells to interleukin 1 (IL 1) and to turnout necrosis factor ~x (TNFc0.",

METHODS: Balb/c mice (n=40) were randomized to 4 groups: Saline-Sham(NS-Sham), Alcohol-Sham(EtOH-Sham), NS-Bum, EtOH-Bum. Animals received 20% EtOH or NS daily for 14 days by gavage. A 30% full thickness bum was induced 4 hrs after the last dose of EtOH or NS. Animals were resuscitated, then sacrificed 4 days post bum. Splenic lymphocytes were cultured for 5 days with LPS, and LPS with two concentrations of N-Monomethyl-L-Arginine, a nitric oxide inhibitor (L-NMMA 2.5ug/ml, 10ug/ml). Splenocyte production of IL-10, Interferon-gamma, IL-2, PGE2 were measured, and lymphocyte proliferative response examined. RESULTS: IL-10 production was significantly suppressed in thermal injury. Exogenous L-NMMA normalized the suppression of 11.-10 in a dose-dependent manner, indicating nitric oxide may modulate IL-10 and Interferon-gamma production in thermal injury. IL-10 production is normal in EtOH-Burn animals.",

Inhibition of NO synthesis normalizes IL-10 production and should be investigated further as an immanomodalator in thermal injury. Surgery, infection and inflammation results in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which mediate metabolic and immunologic host responses. The aim of this study was to characterise the elaboration of cytokine release following a variety of surgical procedures. Twenty one patients undergoing elective intermediate, hip, knee and major gastrointestinal surgery were studied. Levels of interleukin-1 (I1-1), interleukin-6 (I1-6), the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (I1-1RA) and the acute phase C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured in bloods drawn 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours following operation.

Since astrocytes within the brain constitute one of the major cell type contributing to the inflammatory response through the release of cytokines and other factors after injury, we investigated the functional relationship of IL-6 and NGF on a single cell niveau using cultured astrocytes. Methods CSF was obtained from patients with severe brain injury (Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) <8 and CT abnormatities or GCS <8 over 6 hours) after implantation of intraventricular ICP monitoring device for therapeutic purpose and collected over 24 hours CSF and serum. IL-6 and NGF were assayed by ELISA. Astrocytes were isolated from neonatal mouse brain as described (4) . NGF production by cultured astrocytes was measured by ELISA in the presence of CSF, IL-6 and IL-6 antibody. Astrocyte migration was tested in a chemstaxis chamber. Results 17 head trauma patients were included in this study (approved by the University Hospital Medical Ethics Board) and the CSF was obtained through intraventricular catheters. High levels of IL-6 were detected in the CSF of these patients when compared to serum during the first days after brain trauma. Furthermore NGF could be found inside the intracerebral compartment.

Since astrocytes are involved in maintaining the homeostasis of the brain, we further investigated the possible role o1 IL-6 on astrocyte functions, IL-6 promoted NGF production in vivo and in vitro, thus contributing to neuronal cell survival and regeneration. Furthermore IL-6 stimulated astrocyte migration in a dose response fashion, potentially contributing to astrocytosis following brain injury and inflammation, These results show that IL-6 represents a key cytokine in traumatic human brain injury with possible systemic effects, which are at preserlt under investigation. We studied a) the role of TNF and b) the therapeutic effect of a mab to TNF with regard to haemorrhagic shock (HS) related ,pathophysiologic alterations and mortality in rats. Method: A prolonged HS was induced by bleeding to a blood pressure of 30-35 mmHg for 180 pin followed by reinfusion of shed blood (SB) and resuscitation with two times of SB volume of Ringer's lactate over 50 rain. 15 animals received a bolus dose (20 mg/kg) of TNF mab (Celltech, Berkshire, UK) at 15 min after resuscitation (TN3). The control group (n = 15) was treated similar to the TN3 group but received Ringer's lactate (CON). Results: At 180 min the prolonged HS resulted in a metabolic acidosis indicated by a significant decrease of blood pH (7.16 + 0.04), HCO3-(16.3 ___ 2.0 mM), and base excess (-12.5 + 1.9 raM) values with pCO2 (47.9 + 7.7 mmHg) and pO2 (136.2 + 20.1 mmHg) in the TN3 with no difference to the CON group. Immediately after resuscitation (230 min) plasma endotoxin levels were found to be increased in both groups (48.8 + 73.3 in TN3 vs 30.1 _ 25.7 pg/ml in CON group) . Prior to the treatment with TNF mab (230 min) there was also no difference between plasma TNF levels of the two groups (42.1 + 60.7 in TN3 vs 60 + 141.8 pg/ml in CON group). Treatment with the TNF mab at 65 rain post-HS improved the 48hour survival rate to 73.3 % as compared to 26.7 % in the control group. Macropathologic evaluations revealed frequency of intestinal bleeding in onIy 2 animals in the TN3 vs 11 in the CON group. No bleeding in the kidneys was found in the TN3 but in 4 rats in the CON group. The significant increase in lung wet weight observed in non-survivors in the CON (n = 11) was prevented in animals which died in the TN3 (n = 4) group ((9.3 +_ 2.4 vs 6.3 +_ 1.0 g/kg). Conclusion: Our data suggest that TNF formation induced by HS in rats is an important mediator for pathophysiologic alterations leading to multi organ failure and lethality. Antibodies to TNF might be a useful agent in the treatment of haemorrhagic shock related disorders. 55-+8 n=ll*$ 15-+5 n=7 78_+22 n=5* * p<0.05 vs BASELINE :~p<0.05 no anesthesia vs anesthesia Thus 1) TNF production increased 2-3 fold by 48-72 hrs following trauma in unstimulated blood, but was reduced or not changed after LPS stimulation, so circulating leukocytes are probably not an important source of TNF post trauma; 2) antiCD18 had no obvious effect on TNF production in unstimulated or LPS stimulated blood, relative to vehicle, which suggests that the protective mechanism of antiCD18 does not involve TNF suppression; 3) fentanyl anesthesia at 72 hrs following trauma unexpectedly decreased LPS-evoked TNF production, which suggests that anesthesia alone can influence an inflammatory response. Proinflamrnato~ cytokines have been shown to play a signific~t role in the pathogenesis of sepsis, which is a very common occurrence in born injury.

Hypoxia induces enhanced binding of TNF to specific receptors on the endothelial cell surface in a time-and dose-dependent manner by a mechanism, which is not dependent on oxygen radicals, as shown by additional protocols with radical-scavenging drugs. With respect to former findings about a correlation between growth and TNF receptor affinity [3] , these data lead to the hypothesis that enhanced TNF binding during hypoxia is due to a biochemical conversion of the receptor protein from the low affinity to the high affinity state, possibly by posttranslational phosphorylation of the binding protein by intracel)ular kinases. The proposed involvement of TNF-dependent pathways in pathogenesis of organ dysfunction and multiple organ failure after hypoxia/ischemia may provide a basis for understanding the initiation of hypoxic vascular injury, as manifested by increased permeability and prothrombotic tendency, and, thus, merits further attention. The levels of activity of circulating cytokines (ILl, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) which are believed to play important regulatory role in response to trauma are determined (by hioassays and respective anti-cytokine antibodies) in mice and rats subjected to scald injury ion C,10 see, \u00b00v BSA, LD 50) and (80 C, 30 see, 20 ~ B ~^)~ , respectively.",

Immunology (1) and Neurosurgery (2) , Medical School (Char#d), Humboldt University Berlin, FRG In patients after polytrauma or major abdominal surgery a hyperinflammatory phase seems to be followed by the development of a phase of monocyte inactivation. The latter is charaeterised by a decrease of monocytic HLA-DR expression and a shift to anti-inflammatory cytokine production. As shown, by us and others, this phenomenon indicates severe immunodepression with a high risk of infection. However, the mechanisms leading to monocyte inactivation in the above mentioned syndromes may be multiple. To elucidate the influence of a selective, sterile trauma to the central nervous system (CNS) on immune reactivity the neurosurgieal patient is an interesting model. Initially, 30 patients who developed a systemic inflammatory response syndrome following neurosurgery were analysed. In all of them a marked decrease of monocytic HLA-DR expression was observed soon after the operation. These results suggest that neurosurgery alone can induce immunodepression and lead us to conduct a prospective study, in which we closely monitored l0 patients undergoing neurosurgery from the first preoperative day until at least day 6 after the operation. HLA-DR expression was decreased hi all patients to various extent only hours after surgery. In one patient only we found a persistently reduced HLA-DR expression and this was the only patient to develop sepsis syndrome. This suggests that a prolonged, postoperatively decreased HLA-DR expression is predictive of infection following CNS trauma. In order to assess, whether a decrease of HLA-DR expression was associated with a preceding inflammatory response, local cytokine release in the CNS was compared with systemic cytokine release. For this purpose, paired samples of earebrospinal fluid (CSF) from a vantricle drainage and peripheral blood plasma were obtained. In the CSF extremely elevated futerleakin (IL)-6 levels, peaking already a few hours after the operation were found. In plasma, by eontrast, IL-6( and TNF-alpha) was detectable not until days later and only if infection was present. The antiinflammatory ILI-RA, on the other hand, was also present in CSF but peaked after IL-6 and was detectable in peripheral plasma too. We believe there is an association between the inflammatory response in the CNS and the following depression of HLA-DR expression on peripheral blood monocytes. Our results suggest that even a sterile CNS-trauma by itself may contribute to general immunodepressinn leading to septic complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of haemorrhagic shock (HS) a) on total capacity of the host, and b) the circulating blood cells to produce TNF immediately after bleeding. In vivo studies: Baboons were subjected to a limited oxygen deficit (180-200 ml/kg) hypotension phase (mean arterial pressure = MAP of 35-40 mmHg for 2-4 hours followed by adequate resuscitation). Rats subjected to HS (MAP of 30-35 mmHg for 90 rain followed by reinfusion of shed blood and fluid resuscitation) were challenged with endotoxin (1 ~g/kg i.v.) at the end of shock (RHS group). The control group (RCO) received the same dose of endotoxin as RHS group but without prior bleeding. In Vitro studies: Whole blood (WB) obtained from both baboons and rats before and at the end of HS were incubated with endotoxin (100 ng/ml) for 2 hrs at 37 \u00b0C. Results: At 90 min post-LPS challenge we found significantly higher plasma TNF levels in rats that were subjected to HS prior to the endotoxin challenge as compared to the control group (956 _+ 585 vs 276 + 199 pg/ml) . After HS the TPC was significantly decreased in in vitro stimulated CBC of both rats (12 + 4 post-HS vs 164 + 89 ng TNF/ml pre-HS) and baboons (8 \u00b1 16 post-HS vs 233 \u00b1 188 pg TNF/ml pre-HS). In contrast, the IL-6 productive capacity was increased in baboons CBC (not yet analysed in rats) stimulated at the end of HS (224 \u00b1 106 pre-vs 1545 \u00b1_ 1254 pg IL-6/ml post-HS). Conclusion: From our data we suggest that despite of down regulation of the CBC to produce TNF the overall TPC is enhanced at the early stage of I-IS. With regard to the related literature (Chaudry's group) it can be assumed that among the macrophage/monocyte populations, as the main source only the Kupffer cells (KC) exhibit enhanced TNF production capacity following haemorrhage. The mechanisms of down/up regulation of cytokine response of CBC and/or KC following HS remain to be examined.",

            "text": "It has been shown previously (Ehranreich et al., 1992, New Biol. 4: 147 ) that mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) synthesize and secrete endothelin-1 (ET-I) and express ETA-type endothelin receptors (ETA). So far, however, no functions of ET-1/ET A in BMMC have been described. In the present study we investigated the effect of exogeneously administered ET-1 on the release of histamine, serotonin, and leukotriene C 4 (LTC4) by primary mouse BMMC (in vitro age: 4 weeks) caltured with different recombinant mttrine cytokines (interleukin 3 (IL-3) and/or kit ligand (KL) in the presence or absence of IL4) for two weeks prior to activation. ET-1 (5x10 -8 to lxl0 -6 M) induCed an extremely rapid (_<lmin) and dose-dependent release of histamine and serotonin (up to 20% and 16% of total mediator content, respectively, comparable to IgE/Ag-indueed mediator release) from BMMC cultured with IL-3 and IL-4. Only when cultured in the additional presence of IL-4 rather than in medium containing KL or KL plus IL-3 alone, BMMC released histamine and serotoaln upon challenge with ET-1.Furthermore, ET-1 stimulated LTC 4 biosynthesis up to 4-fold in BMMC cultured in the presence of IL-4. In contrast, the peptide was without major effect on LTC4 biosynthesis in BMMC culturd without IL-4. The release of histamine and sereotonin was not altered if BMMC were preincubated for i h with IL-4 prior to activation with ET-I, suggesting that a differentiation process rather than a functional priming effect had been initiated by ]L-4. ET-1 (10\"6M) -induced histamine and serotouln release from BMMC was inhibited by an ETA-specific antagonist (cyclic ID-Asp-Pro-D-Val-Leu-D-Tel ) in a dose-dependent manner, with a complete inhibition observed at an antagonist concentration of 10 -8 M. Crude peritoneal cells (containing 2-3% serosal mast cells) obtained from normal BALB/c-mice released 87% histamine upon challenge with ET-1 (10 -6 M; 20 rain). Taken together, these resu/ts demonstrate that ET-1 can directly function as a histamine and serotohin secretagogue and as a stimulator of LTC 4 production in mast cells. IL-4 appears to be involved in the differentiation of immature mast cell prec~trsors towards an ET-l-reactive functional phenotype. When inflammatory reactions are advanced, type II phospholipase A2 (type II PLA2) is produced in high levels by various cells at the site of inflammation. Cytokines such as TNF-a and IL-I activate type II PLA2 and promote the production of eicosanoid, which is one of the mechanisms by which they enhance the inflammatory reaction. In the present study, the blood levels of type II PEA2, endotoxin, TNF-c~, IL-6 and IL-8 were determined in patients with sepsis to examine the relationship between these levels and the patients' pathological conditions. The levels of type II PLA2 and TNF-a in these patients were 218.3 \u00b1 179.9 ng/ml and 98.5 \u00b1 92.1 pg/ml, respectively, the two parameters being significantly correlated (r = 0.6460, p = 0.0001 ). There were also a significant correlation between the level of type II PLA2 an IL-6 (r = 0.4262, p = 0.0188). There was no significant correlation between the level of type II PLA2 and IL-8. These in vivo findings suggest that TNF-a may be involved in the production of type II PLA2. ",

GSF-Iustitut ff~r Experimentelle H~imatologie, Munich, and \u00b0Iustitut fttr Immunelone , Johannes Gutenberg Universit~t, Mainz, Germany The product of c-kit, a transmembrane tyrosin ldnase receptor, and a corresponding kit ligand (KL) are critically involved in the control of different hemopoietic cell lineages including the proliferation, maturation, migration, and function of mast cells. It has been reported previously that interleukin (IL)-4 down-regulates kit receptors in human primary myeloid leukemic cells and in a human mast celt line (Sinaber et al. 1991, J. Immunol. 147: 4224) . Transforming growth factor (TGF) gl, was also found to down-modulate c-kit mRNA and kit receptor proteins in human AML blasts, a mechanism probabely contributing to the anti-proliferative effect of TGFIH on KL-stimulated AML ceils in vitro (de Vos et at. 1993, Cancer Res. 53: 3638) . In porcine endothelial cells transfected with a retroviral construct carrying the human (hu) e-kit gena, exogenous hu KL transiently down-regulated kit receptors (Blume-Jeusen et al. 1991, EMBO J 10: 4121) . In the light of these previous findings we analyzed the effects of these exogenously applied cytokines (IL-4, TGFgl, KL) on kit receptor expression and KL-mediated proliferation and chemotactic migration of primary mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) (in vitro age: 4 weeks). Our results show that in BMMC cultures initiated with recombinant (r) marine (mu) IL-3 the additional presence of rmulL-4 for 3 or 14 days did not change the expression of kit protein (assessed by FACS analysis with the anti-mouse c-kit antibody ACK-2) nor KL-mediated proliferation or chemotaxis. In contrast, IL-4 syeergistically increased KL-stimulated growth of BMMC in a short-term proliferation assay (MTT-tes0. Pre-incubation of BMMC with rhuTGFl~ 1 (5.0, 1.0, or 0.1 ng/ml) for 24h had no effect on kit receptor expression, although TGFfil at concentrations of 0.5 -5.0 ng/ml completely suppressed the proliferative action of KL on these ceils. Similar anti-proliferative effects of TGFg 1 were observed in various factor-dependent mast cell lines stimulated with different mast cell growth factors (IL-3, 1I,-4, IL-9, and/or IL-10). Moreover, pre-incuhation (24h) of BMMC with TGF-gl (>500 pg/ml) significantly enhanced spontaneous undirected cell movement (chemokinesis) and synergistically increased IL-3-or KL-induced chemetaxis. When BMMC were preAncuhated with rmuKL (200 ng/ml) for 1, 3. or 5 days, a transient down-modulation of kit receptors with a maximum effect on day 1 was demonstrated by FACS analysis and correlated well with a decreased chemotactic response of these cells. In conclusion our results show that neither IL-4 nor TGFI31 affect expression of kit receptors in primary murine BMMC. It is reasonable to suggest that c-kit expression is controlled in a cell type-specific manner.Interestingly, TGFgl is obviously able to dissect the proliferative from the migrational signal transducted by KL in these cells. Objectives of the study: Antisense strategies using DNA-otigonucleofides (ODN) to modulate the cytokine response are presently under investigation. ODN are thought to act very specifically with little or no relevant negative side effects. We now report that ODN unspeeifically protect WEHI 164 cells from TNF-mediated cytolysis.",

With increasing amounts of TNF the protective effect of QDN decreased and no protection was detectable at 8ng TNF per ml Conclusions: DNA-oligonucleotides were found to unspecifically inhibit TNF-induced cytolysis. We hypothesize, that this protective effect of QDN results from an inhibition of the binding of TNF to its receptor, or from interference of ODN with the subsequent signal transduction mechanisms. As a consequence, to discriminate the specific effect of ODN in biologic systems, several control ODN should be used.

In addition our evidence suggest that the balance of extracellular protease/antiprotease activity may be regulated by free radical generation, possible superoxide anion, resulting in inactivation of the antiprotease. IL-1 release may be subsequent to TNF release. Objective: During sepsis one can observe a dramatically impaired production of proinflammatory cytokines like the Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), Interleukin I-alpha (IL-la), Intedeukin I-beta (IL-I&) and Interferon gamma (IF~) upon in vitro stimulation of circulating cells. However there is also evidence of a decreased ability to produce cytokines in other immuno-deficient states. In this study we compared the capacity to secrete proinflammatory cytokines upon in vitro stimulation of patients in severe sepsis and patients with malignant tumors. Methods: Heparinized blood samples of ten patients (62+ 14 years) in severe sepsis (sepsis score > 15 according to E}ebute and Stoner) were drawn at onset of disease, From fifteen patients with solid growing carcinoma (59+19 years) blood was drawn at diagnosis prior to any therapy. Controls were obtained from fifteen healthy volunteers. 50 pl of whole blood were incubated either with 450/4 of a standard medium or with 400 pl of a standard medium and 50 pl of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) a potent mitogen. After an incubation period of 24 hours plasma concentrations of TNF-a, IL-la, IL-16 and IF-~ were determined by ELISA. Comments: Our results suggest that down-regulation of cytokine secretion or of cell responsiveness to non-specific mitogens during sepsis has occurred. We observe a similar phenomenon for the group of carcinoma patients vs control significant for stimulated TNF-a and stimulated IF-T. Sustained immunological interactions between tumorcells and cytokine producing cells could effect responsiveness of the latter, A general increased immuno-tolerant state in patients with carcinoma has to be discussed. However we found significant differences between sepsis and cancer concerning the in vitro capacity of responsable cells to produce IL-la and IL-I#. The dramatically decrease of the ability to produce IL-I upon in vitro stimulation could be more sensitive for a septic state than stimulated TNF-a or IF-3,. Objective: Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) has been implicated as a central mediator of sepsis and its sequelae. Increased systemic levels of this cytoklne seem to be correlated with severity of sepsis and outcome. However mechanism of action and metabolism of TNF-G are not fully understood. In most studies blood samples for TNF-a determinations are obtained either by peripheral venipuncture, a central venous catheter or by an indwelling arterial catheter. Very often blood samples are taken in different manners within the same study. In this study we measured circulating TNF-a and the amount of TNF-a released upon in vitro stimulation in arterial and central venous blood.",

Upon in vitro stimulation there was also a significant difference (p < 0,002) between released arterial TNF-~' {746 pg/ml _+ 88 SEM) and venous TNF-a (637 pg/ml +_ 76 SEMI. Conclusions: These results are difficult to interprete but could reflect the influence of paO 2 and SaO 2 on TNF a release. It could also be the result of different concentrations of TNF-o release influencing factors like for example endotoxin, interferon-F or prostaglandin. A possible pulmonary and/or a hepatic metabolism of TNF-n and TNF-a producing cells cannot be ruled out. However for better interpretations of TNF-a release in septic states it is necessary to use either arterial or venous blood samples. Early inflammatory processes following trauma and/or infections were found to be associated with the secretion of high amounts of proinflammatory cytokines. Besides intedeukin-t (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-c 0 and interleukin-8 (IL-8) the multifunctional cytokine intedeukin-6 (IL-6) was described to be a central regulatory element of the primary cellular and humeral defence reaction. The previously described close temporal correlation of pathologically elevated IL-6-concentrations and the extracellulary release of lysosomal enzymes from activated pelymorphnuclear neutrophils suggests, that IL-6 may be a potential substrate of these preteases. The serine preteases elastase (EC 3.4.21.37 ) and cathepsin G (EC 3.4.21.20) derived from the azurophilic granules were assumed to be mainly involved in unspecific proteolysis at sites of inflammation by cleavage of structural as well as soluble proteins at random sites, if the inhibitory potential is decreased. The possible proteolytic activity of elastase and cathepsin G toward the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) was investigated. The addition of purified neutrephil elastase and cathepsin G to recombinant human IL-6 leads to a rapid sequential degradation in vitro. At least two intermediate products could be detected by silver staining and western blotting following protein separation under reducing conditions. The serine protease inhibitor G-anitrypsin was shown to prevent the proteolytical degradation of intedeukin-6. Furthermore the loss of the biological activity of both, recombinant and natural human IL-6, was demonstrated by determination of the capacity of protease-treated IL-6 to stimulate hybddoma growth (7TD1 bioassay). These data suggest a possible downregulation of pathologically elevated IL-6 levels by proteolytic activity of extracellulary released enzymes at sites of inflammation. The aim of the study was to compare circulating levels of three cytokines -IL-1, IL-6, 11_-8 -between critically ill subjects who developed Gram-negative sepsis and who did not. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patient population consisted of 39 patients admitted to an Intensive Cars Unit, with different underlying diseases. Sepsis diagnosis was given according to pre-estabilished cdteda. Nineteen cases were enrolled in sepsis group, twenty in control group. Serum sampling was collected in sterile tubes at study entry and every three days until study dismissal. Serum concentrations of IL-1, 11_-6 and IL-8 were measured using commercially available test kits, based on the dual immunometric sandwich principle. RESULTS: The causative patogens of sepsis were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Eseherichia co~i, Serratia marceseens, Proteus mirobilis and Citrobacter freundL The time of observation was equal to 12 days, for a total of four tests performed (to, tl, t2, t3). I1.-1 was not detected in any samples. The serological profiles of the two cytokines 11.-6 and 11_-8 were similar; augmented levels were found at study entry and throughout the observation period, peaking at t3 and decreasing at t4. However, in patients with sepsis, IL-6 and 11_-8 concentrations were significantly higher in respect to control group. CONCLUSION: Our observations shown that in ICU patients increased IL-6 and IL-8 release may be induced by cdtical illness; however, in subjects in which sepsis occurred, IL-6 and IL-8 production appears more significantly elevated, suggesting a role of IL-6 and 11_-8 in the pathophysiology of sepsis.

To gain more insigths on the contribution of TNF~, IL-I~ and IF 7 to LPS toxicity, we explored the time-course of the cytokine production in Ealb/C mice given different doses, from the lethal (= 3 LD50) to the sublethal (= 1/3 LD50) of three different LPS (E.coli OIII:B4 and 026:B6; P.aeruginosa R261) endowed with different degree of toxicity Cytokines were measured in serum and organs with specific ELISAs up to I0 h after LPS administration. Results demonstrate that i) circulating and organ levels of TNF~ do not reflect LPS toxicity. In fact, the lethal dose of LPS 026:B6 induced as much TNF~ as the sublethal dose of LPS 0111:B4; furthermore, LPS R261, whose cytokine inducing capability is far lower than that of LPS from E.coli, induced higher TNF~ levels at the sublethal than at the lethal dose. In addition, policlonal anti TNF Ab, that were able to protect mice from E.coli LPS induced mortality, failed in mice treated with LPS R261 2) Circulating IL-I~ levels are generally low and increase significantly only in muribond animals. On the contrary, in spleen and lung very high levels of IL-I~ are persistent from I to 8 h post LPS administration Moreover, the treatment with 6 mgr of neutralizing policlonal anti IL-I~ Ab, did not modify survival in LPS challenged mice. 3) Circulating and organ levels of IF 7 are proportional to the dose and degree of toxicity of all the administered LPS even if LPS R261 was again a less efficient cytokine inducer than LPS from E.coli. CsA is an immunos~ppressive drug, able to inhibit gene expression for many cytokines, including IF 7. To study the effect of cytokines modulation on LPS toxicity, CsA was administered to mice twice at the oral dose of i00 mg/kg before the challenge with LPS. Mice were monitored in terms of mortality and TNF~, IL-I~ and IF 7 production. Together with the total ablation of IF7, the strong reduction of TNFu and unmodified IL-I~ levels, a significant increase of LPS toxicity was also observed. These results suggest the hypothesis that the numerous factors that jointly mediate LPS toxic effects, can also be protective, the final outcome depending on their relative ratio rather than on the absolute amount Interleukin-1 (IL-1) mediates the septic shock syndrome and affects intestinal secretion in vitro. We studied the intestinal production of IL-t and its effects on diarrhea during endotoxic shock. CD-1 mice were randomized to 15 mg/kg E.coli 0111:B4 LPS or saline infusion (I.P. or I.V.). Diarrhea invariably occurred following LPS infusion. Mice were sacrificed at 0, 30', lh, 2.5h, 4h, 6h, 12h, and 24h (3 mice/group/time-point). The small bowel was compressed and the intestinal contents were weighed and expressed per g SB weight. The small (SB) and large bowels (LB) were eventually frozen, weighed, and homogenized for either cytosolic protein or total RNA. IL-I~ (cell-associated agonist) was measured with a radioimmunoassay specific for mouse IL-l~ (detection limit 100 pg/mL) and expressed as ng/g weight + SEM (lowest detectable amount 1 ng/gWT). Northern analysis of total RNA and in sfu hybridization of paraformaldehyde-fixed frozen tissue were done with [0~-32p]-Iabeled mouse IL-lc~ cDNA probes. Only SB had IL-I~ constitutively present (6.2 + 1.6 ng/gWT). LPS I.P. or I.V. induced elevation of IL-lc\u00a2 in both organs in a biphasic pattern; LPS I.V. induced 3-fold more IL-I~ than LPS I.P. Following LPS I.P., IL-I~ in SB was 19.2 + 0.6 ng/gWT at lh, reached maximal levels at 2.5h (31.8 -+ 0.5 ng/gW-I) and returned to baseline at 24h. Saline controls maintained their constitutive IL-I~ levels. SB had 2fold more IL-1 \u00a2 than LB and identical kinetics, but LB showed a clearer doseresponse. Northern analysis of SB-total RNA showed induction of IL-I~ mRNA by LPS in correlation with IL-lc\u00a2 kinetics. IL-I~ mRNA producing cells were mononuclear cells in the lamina propda and epithelial cells at the bottom of the crypts of Ueberkuhn. Mucus and fluid were increased in the small bowel post-LPS in correlation with intestinal IL-lc~ kinetics (R2=0.9). Separate mice were pretreated with saline I.P. orthe IL-1 receptor antagonist (IRAP, 30 mg/kg bolus I.P.) and were challenged 20 rain later with 1.5 mg/kg LPS I.P. or saline I.P.

Inflammatory cytokines initiate the host response to endotoxemia, causing severe physiological and hemodynamic changes which may lead to septic shock. Among the regulatory systems that play an important rote in controlling host inflammatory responses is the pituitary. It has been known for many years for example, that hypophysectomized animals are extremely sensitive to LPS lethality. While investigating the possibility that protective, pituitary mediators might explain this phenomenon, we identified the cytoldne MIF to be a specific secretory product produced by pituitary cells in vitro and in vivo after LPS challenge. Analysis of serum MIF levels in control, T-cell deficient (nude), and hypophysectomized mice revealed that pituitary-derived MIF contributes significantly to the rise in serum MIF that occurs after LPS administration. Of note, pituitary MIF content (0.05% of total pituitary protein) and peak serum MIF levels (80-340 ng/ml) were determined to be within the range observed for other pituitary hormones that are released after pituitary stimulation.",

Moreover, MIF may play a critical regulatory role in the systemic host response in septic shock. Our results suggest that anti-rMIF antibody might be of potential therapeutic use in the treatment of septic shock. Although anti-Interleukin-1 (IL-1) antibodies and IL-1 receptor antagonist have been shown to improve survival in animal models of endotoxemia and abrogate the lethal effects of TNF, the presence of IL-1 in the serum does not correlate well with outcome. We hypothesized that this may be because IL-1 acts mainly in a paracrine fashion and is metabolized before it diffuses into the circulation. Methods: We measured the IL-I~ mRNA expression with the differential reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using g-actin as internal standard in the peritoneal macrophages and lung tissue in normal controls and mice after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). CLP resembles human intra-abdominal sepsis in that it is characterized by very slight elevations of serum IL-1 levels. Results: IL-lg mRNA levels after CLP are expressed as % of normal (mean+SEM, n=5 In several experimental models of infection exacerbation of disease was observed, when infected animals were depleted of tuaJor necrosis factor (TNF). After sublethal cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) leading to peritonitis and sepsis the survival of mice also critically depends on TNF as demonstrated in earlier studies, when CLP-treated mice injected with anti-TNF antibody died, whereas mice injected with a control antibody survived after CLP (Echtenacher et al. 1990, J. Inununol. 145: 3762) . From a panel of different cell types (macrophages, neutrophils, T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, mast cells) able to produce TNF upon activation~ the mast cell is apparantly the only one capable of storing in cytoplasmic granules preformed TNF-ct which is rapidly released following challenge. In the present study-we analyzed serum TNF after LPS injections as well as the outcome of CLP in severely mast cell deficient mutant mice (WAV v) as compared to syngeaeic wild-type littermates (+/+). We proposed that concentrations and/or kinetics of serum TNF should be different between WAVv mutants and wild-type mice, if mast cell-derived TNF significantly contributes to the rise in serum TNF levels following systemic stimulation with endotoxin. Although similar levels of increased TNF were detected in the sera of both genotypes after 1 and 2 hours of LPS injection (100 btg/ 0.5 ml / mouse i. p.), mast ceil-deficient mice indeed showed decreased serum TNF levels 30 iron after injection amounting to only 12 to 25% of the concentrations observed in the corresponding sera of normal wildtype mice. In the CLP model of septic peritonitis we found that mast celldeficient mutant mice were dramatically more sensitive to CLP than syngeneic normal mice resulting in 92% mortality in W/W v versus 8% mortality in +/+ mice 2.5 days after initiation of CLP. Further experiments with W/W v mutants selectively reconstituted with cultured bone marrow-derived mast cells from normal syngeneic wild-type mice and the use of an antibody specifically blocking the action of TNF tn vivo should clarify a potential protective function of mast cells in this model of septic peritonitis. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) inhibits cytokine production, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-aetivated maerophages. We recently observed that LPS injection (E.coli 055:B5, 100 gg ip) into Balb/c mice induces the rapid release of circulating IL-10 (17\u00b19 U/ml at 90 min). Blocking endogenous IL-10 using monocIonal antibody (JES5-2A5, 2 mg, 2h before LPS) resulted in a massive increase in TNF production (107\u00b147 in LPS+anti-IL-10 treated mice vs 6\u00b12 ng/ml in LPS alone, p<0.05, n=4 to 5 mice per group) and an enhanced LPS-induccd lethality (53% vs 7% in anti-IL-10+LPS or LPS alone respectively, p=0.01, n=15 mice per group). Irrelevant IgG1 rat monoclonal antibody (LO-DNP) did not influence neither TNF production nor lethality associated with endotoxin shock. This led us to study the production of IL-10 during human septicemia. Plasma samples were obtained from 65 patients with gramnegative (GNS, n=22) or gram-positive septicemia (GPS, n=43) and from 20 healthy volunteers. Among these patients, 17 suffered from septic shock at the time of sampling. IL-10 levels were measured by ELISA (detection limit: I 1 pghrd). We found that 35 patients (54%) had increased IL-10 plasma levels (range 12 to 2740 pg/nd). Patients with GPS had IL-10 levels similar to the ones observed in GNS (median: 12 vs 17.5 pg/M, respectively). Patients with septic shock had higher IL-10 values (median: 58 pg/ml) than septicemic patients without shock (11 pg/ml, p=0.002). No IL-10 was detected in plasma from healthy volunteers.",

Patients and Melhods: 20 septic patients fullfilling sepsis criteria of American College of Chest Physician and Society of Critical Care Medicine were studied. TNF-cc and STNFR-I (60kDa) were measured by enzyme immuneassays (norms1 values = 13+8 pg/mL and 1.06_+0A ng/mL respectively). Results: The mean TNF and sTNFR-I values for each patient (mean+SD) were 93+64 pg/mL and 11.1+5.5 ng/mL respectively. These values are approximately seven and ten times greater than those observed in normal healthy volunteers (P<0.001). Mean TNF concentrations for each patient were significantly greater in non survivors (112+52 vs 64_+74 pg/ml P<0.05); sTNFR-I levels also were greater in this group, but the difference was not statistically significant (12.6+5.2 vs 8.8_+5.5 ng/ml). Plasma TNF and sTNFR-I concentrations were significantly correlated (r = 0.65 P<0.005). Mean TNF levels were significantly correlated with APACHE II (r = 0.49 P<0.05) and SSS (r = 0.54 P<O.01); sTNFR-I levels were likewise correlated with both scores (r = 0.80 P<0.001 and r = 0.76 P<0.001 respectively). TNF and sTNFqGI levels increase with the number of dysfuctional organs; in particular TNF and STNFR-I increase when hemodynamics deteriorate and kidney failure ensues. Conclusions: The correlations between TNF and sTNFR-I levels and sepsis severity scores suggests that TNF is involved in sepsis and may influence the occurrence of MODS and finally clinical outcome. TNF and sTNFR-I are in fact especially increased when MODS occurs. In particular their concentrations are elevated when cardiovascular system and kidney failure ensue, suggesting that TNF can have a direct role in hemodynamic derangements caused by sepsis and that kidneys are involved in TNF and sTNFR-I excretion. LIF is a pleiotropic cytokine that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis in animal models. We conducted a prospective study in 33 septic patients to correlate LIF plasma levels with patient's clinical and biological data (among them IL-6). Plasma was drawn daily from day one to .ten and LIF presence was determined with a specific ELISA and with the DAI,a bioassay (sensitivity of 100 pg/ml and 1 ngml respectively). Risk factor associated wftt~ with elevated LIF plasma level was determined by an univariate analysis. A multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis was subsequently performed with a BMDP statistical software. LIF was detected with the ELISA and with the bioassay in 11 and 2 out of the 33 patients, respectively. LIF peak plasma levels were statistically associated with high creatmin levels, temperature and IL-6. Multivariate regression analysis showed that high serum creatinin level was the major independent risk factor associated with elevated LIFplasma levels. This correlation was also found for IL-6. Peak plasma levels of both LIF and IL-6 correlated inversely with patients survival duration. Cox's analysis for plasma levels of LIF >480 pg/ml yelded a hazard ratio of [exp (1.86)=6.44]. Our study indicates that LIF levels were associated with clinical and biological parameters of illness severity and significantly increased (cut-off value 480 pg/mI) in patients with fatal outcome. Current consensus exists about the central role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha in initiating the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). A correlation with SIRS has inconsistently been found. TNF effects its pleiotropic reactions upon two distinct cellular receptors. Soluble extracel]ular fragments of the human 55 kDa TNF receptor (sTNFRI) and the 75 kDa receptor (sTNFRII) are detectable in the circulation. The kinetics of these endogenously produced TNF-inhibitors were measured to evaluate their role in patients with SIRS. Fourteen patients of an operative ICU were included with the diagnossis of SIRS (mean APACHE II score: 20 points). Serial blood samples were obtained within 12 h after diagnosis of SIRS, every 6 hrs for the first 48 hrs and every 12 hrs thereafter until patients died or recovered. Soluble TNFRI and sTNFRII were assayed by an enzymed-linked immunological binding assay. Soluble TNFRI and II could be detected in all samples with a significantly higher level (p<O,O01) compared to healthy controls (normal value: TNFRh 1,5 ng/ml; TNFRII: 2,3 ng/ml). The serum concentration of TNFRI (14,1 ng/ml) as well as TNFRII (18,2 ng/ml) were significantly higher in nonsurvivors (n=6) compared to survivors (8,6 and 9,5 ng/ml; n=8) at the onset of SIRS and during the course of the inflammation response (p<0,05). A positive correlation exists between both receptors (r-0,57; p < 0,01 ). Increasing levels and maximal values of sTNFRI (59 ng/ml) and I1 (82 ng/mI) were detected only in patients who died. The serum concentrations of patients who recovered did not change and are remaining at the initial level. TNF alpha bioactivity was detected in 10 out of 14 patients. No significant correlation exists between the concentration of both receptors and TNF alpha as well as the APACHE II score at the onset of SIRS. Elevated serum concentration of sTNFRI and 11 are found in patients with SIRS. These naturally occuring antagonists reflect the inflammatory process. The measurement of soluble TNF receptor levels may be useful in monitorina SIRS and in the prediction of outcome. 11-2 is given to patients with advanced melanoma or renal carcinoma. However, this therapy is accompanied by severe side effects, including the Vascular Leak Syndrome (VLS) that closely resembles septic shock. To investigate the involvement of cytokines and phospholipase A z in the pathogenesis of the VLS we collected serial plasma samples from patients during the first 24 hours after administration of IL-2. In these patients we monitored temperature, blood pressure and heart rate and assessed levels of the cytokines TNF, IL-6 and IL-8 using immuno assays. In these plasma samples we also measured phospholipase A 2 activity using an enzyme activity assay, since this enzyme is beleived to play a major role in the generation of lipid mediators. We demonstrate that during IL-2 therapy the cytokines TNF, IL-6, and IL-8 are produced and that the release of these cytokines is followed by an induction of phospholipase Az activity in the plasma of these patients, We further discuss the role of these mediators in the development of the vascular leak syndrome observed in patients receiving IL-2. Objectives of the study: Sepsis caused by Candida albicans (CA) is no longer a clinical rarity but a common consequence of immunosuppression and surgery, and is associated with high mortality. Tumor necrosis faetor-c\u00a2 (TNF-<~), interlcukin-lg (IL-lg) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of the sepsis syndrome. We therefore studied the in vitro production of TNF-<x, IL-IB and IL-6 by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated by CA compared to stimulation by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Materials and methods: PBMC were isolated from venous blood of 5 healthy volunteers and cultured at a concentration of 2.5 \u2022 10 ~ eells/ml in culture medium with a dose-range of either heat-killed CA or LPS. Supernatants were harvested after 24 hours. Using ELISA, TNF-c~, IL-IB and IL-6 concentrations were measured. CA was isolated from a patient with CA sepsis and cultured under sterile conditions. Results: CA and LPS stimulate the production of TNF-~t, IL-11] and IL-6 by human PBMC. We observed a dose-dependent synthesis of these three cytokines in human PBMC.

The sc-Fv has a similar affinity (3,8x10-9M) as the Fab-fragment (2,7x10-9M) but bind the antigen with a eightfold lower avidity compared to the parental mAb (4,8x10-10). The parental mAb as well as its fragments can compete the binding of rhuTNF to both TNF-receptors. This was shown by competitive binding to the cell line HL-60 and to immobilized rTNF-receptors. In the nutralization assay on the cell line, L 929, the sc-Fv can neutralize TNF but in comparison to the mAb or its Fabfragment, the capacity was three-fold lower as expected from the molar ratio of the dissociation constants. The in rive-neutralizing capacity was tested in a mice receiving toxic dose of rhuTNF. The sc-Fv showed a 15-fold lower neutralizing capacity in comparison with the Fab-fragment. This could be explained in different manners: i) partial instability of scFv at 370C, ii) shorter half-life because sc-Fv but not Fab-fragments are eliminated via kidney, iii) elimination of TNF-immunocomplexes may be improved by opsonization mechanisms which requires some structures of the constant region (as in Fab or mAb). In summary, despite the encouraging in vitro experiments, the in vivo data suggest that sc-Fv are not the right strategy for neutralizing TNF in vivo.",

IAzAr Glucocorticoids inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNF production and TNF can stimulate pituitary adrenocorticotropin secretion, resulting in the release of corticosterone. Earlier studies (1) reveales that the glucocorticoid antagonist RU 38486, nufepristone, sensitizes both endotoxin responder and nonresponder, C3H/HeJ, mice to endotoxin lethality. We have also shown that the glucocorticoid antagonist RU 38486 sensitizes endotoxin-tolerant (endotoxin-pretreated) and normal mice to the lethal effect of septic and endotoxin shock. On this basis, we set out to study the influence of RU 38486 on TNF production induced by endotoxin in endotoxin responder and non-responder mice. One and 2 hrs following LPS injection, RU 38486 significantly increased the TNF concentration in the serum, liver and spleen of treated animals as compared with the control and methylprednisolonetreated groups. In tissue cultures, RU 38486 induced the TNF synthesis of myeloid cells and increased the TNF production of genetically modified HeLa cells, which synthesize TNF constitutively. Normal and tumor cell cultures exhibited an increased sensitivity toward TNF in the presence of RU 38486. However, the same dose of LPS did not induce TNF production in the serum, liver and spleen of endotoxin non-responder mice and this was not influenced by concomitant RU 38486 treatment. These studies suggest that RU 38486 aggravates LPS lethality via factors other than TNF in endotoxin non-responder, C3H/HeJ mice. The cytokine response to a novel exnacellular mitogenic factor, MF, produced by the group A streptococci (GAS), and to the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins (Spe) A and B, was determined by in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from healthy blood donors. The induction and kinetics of 14 different cytokines was studied at single-cell level using cytokine specific monoclonal antibodies and intracellular immunofluorescent staining. All three mitogens induced a massive IFNy and TNFI3 response in 10-16% of the PBMC after 48-96 hours of cell stimulation. In contrast, IL2 and TNFc~ containing cells was only detected in 1-3% of the PBMC. The induction ofIL3, IL4, IL5, and ILl0, was weak or completely absent. Thus, the response indicates activation of TH1 cells. However, ILlc~, ILll3, ILlra and IL8, were consistently found and gradually produced, peaking at 24 hems in approximately 5-8% of the PBMC. MF induced an equally extensive cytokine as well as proliferative inducing capacity, as did SpeA and SpeB, which suggests that also MF is a superantigen. A marked inter-individual variation could be noted between lymphocytes isolated from different individuals, both in the toxin induced proliferation and cytokine induction. This may be one explanation for the varying clinical severity noted in patients after infection with clonal GAS strains. Introduction -Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is released by mononuclear cells in response to inflammation and sepsis. It has been implicated as a possible mediator in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) but its pathogenic role remains uncertain. This study assessed the relationship between TNFct and disease activity by measuring plasma and faecal TNF concelnmtions in an experimcntaI model of IBD. Methodologo' -Colitis was induced in male Wistar rats by intmcolonic instillation of 30rag 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphunic acid in 0.5mL 50% ethanol (n=12). Control animals received an isovohlmetric instillation of normal saline (n=12). Faecal pellets were collected before induction of colitis (Day 0) and throughout the experiment. After 8 days the colon was excised, ueighed and the colon macroscopic score (CMS) assessed Plasma TNF (pTNF) samples were assayed by bioassay and ELISA. Faecal samples were vortcxed in water and the supernatant removed for estimation of protein and faecal TNF (iTNF) content (ELISA). There is a significant increase in ITNF on day 4 -#p=0 02 alld the total fTNF measured during the study correlatcs with the CMS oll day 8 -p=0.04 There is no correlation between fTNF and pTNF. Conclusions -Therc is evidence of coloific TNF excretion by macroscopically normal animals and following induction of colitis there is increased faecal TNF which correlates with disease actMty. There is no significant elevation in bioactive or imnmnoreactive plasma TNF in colitie animals This data would suggest that faecal TNF is a marker of colonic inflamrnatiort and serial TNF assessment inay be useful as an indicator &severity in IBD.

            "text": "We wondered whether our in vitro results were actually reflected by the incidence of CMV reactivation in diseases which go together with high TNFalpha levels. Cellular immunodeficiency as well as at least temporarily increased TNF levels are known to occur in septic disease. We tested for the presence of CMV infection in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) by means of 24h centrifugation culture, immunocytological detection of different CMV antigens (APAAP-technique), and PCR technique (CMV-IE DNA). In striking contrast to healthy controls almost all examined septic patients were positive, irrespective of the method for CMV-ddtection applied, including the less sensitive immunocytology. Follow-up studies showed that CMV-antigen positive PBMNC ceased to be detectable in patients with good outcome once septicaemia had been overcome. To further back up our hypothesis, we looked for a coincidence of enhanced TNF-alpha serum levels and CMV antigenaemia (immunocytology) in some other diseases which are known to have either enhanced TNF serum levels or increased incidence of active CMV infection and found the majority of patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, liver cirrhosis, and common variable immunodeficiency to be positive for these two parameters. We now wondered whether, apart from CMV reactivation, TNF-alpha could also cause cellular immunodeficiency this way promoting CMV replication and spreading and eventually causing CMV disease. In summary, we were able to show that a diminished cellular immune response results from/n vitro or in vivo Methylprednisolone (MPS) is used to suppress both inflammatory and immune responses. IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-lra) and TNF binding protein (TNFbp) are naturally occuring anti-cytokine proteins, possibly modulating inflammatory and immunological responses. To define MPS modulation of cytokine and anticytokine responses, we examined effects of MPS on IL-lra production and TNFbp generation as well as IL-I~ and TNFa production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). PBMC were purified from the blood of healthy volunteers, then incubated with LPS (10ng/ml) supplemented with different concentrations of MPS (0, 500pg/ml, 50mg/ml). After 24hrs incubation, the supernatants were collected for RIAs of secreted cytokines. The cell lysates obtained by 3 cycles of freeze-thaw, were also collected for R IAs of cell-associated cytokines. Both the supernatant for secreted cytokines and the cell lysates for the cell-associated cytokines were subjected to RIAs for IL-I~, TNFa, IL-1 ra, and TNFbp-I (TNFsRp55). IL-la, IL-1 ra, and TNFbp were produced mainly as cell-associated forms in response to LPS, whereas most TNFa was secreted into the supernatant of LPS-stimulated PBMC. MPS supplement resulted in reduction of IL-la, IL-lra, and TNFa production. IL-la production was reduced up to 5.4+1.6%(50mg/ml) by MPS in a dose dependent fashion, whereas about 50% decrease in TNFc, and IL-lra production was observed at both high and low dose MPS supplement. However, total TNFbp generation was not reduced significantly by MPS supplement. Furthermore, TNFbp secretion was increased 12 times more in the supernatant of LPS-stimulated PBMC with 500gg/ml of MPS. These data suggest that MPS could effectively block TNF activity by both reducing its production and up-regulating TNFbp generation and that MPS works as an anti-inflammatory drug as well as an immunosuppressant by modulating cytokine and anticytokine responses. In severe gram-negative sepsis, excess of proinflammatory cytokines is associated with increased morbidity and the mortality. We have found that immunocytes possess functional 13-adrenergic receptors (~-AR) which, when activated, down regulate the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced gene expression and subsequent secretion of TNF-~ in vitro. In the present study, we used a lethal endotoxic model in mice to test the hypothesis that 13-AR stimulation will down regulate the gene expression thus decreasing the circulatory levels of proinftammatory cytokines and improve the survivals in severe endotoxicosis. The animals (ISO group) were injected 3 times with !3-AR agohist isoproterenol (0.5 mg/kg i.m. and 0.5 mg/kg s.c.) 4, 2 and 0 hours prior to a lethal dose of LPS injection (25 mg/kg i.p.). Control group (CTL) received same volume of saline at the same times before the LPS insult. At the appropriate time points after LPS injection animals were sacrificed and venous blood was collected from the inferior vena cava. The plasma levels of TNF-cc and IL-loc were determined by ELISA.

In the hmg and liver, this was primarily due to a reduced bleeding and PMN infiltrate and to an additional maintenance of tubular integri~:y in the kidney. Hence, in tlais model anti-TNF treatment markedly reduced the biochemical and histological indices of severe ,, ~gan damage during liaemorrhage and rAnerfn~ion. Thermal injuries and systemic bacterial sepsis produce a wasting diathesis with anorexia and marked loss of lean tissue and body fat. Endogenously produced cytokines, including interleukin-1 (IL-1 ), are thought to mediate many beneficial as well as pathologic host changes that occur during burn injury and infection. To evaluate whether bluckade of IL-1 in vivo would affect survival and attenuate the anorexia and cachex[a associated with a thermal injury and chronic fulminant gram negative infection, 24 Sprague-Dawley rats were studied. Anesthetized rats were divided in 3 groups, implanted with Alzet R minipumps and randomized to receive the following treatment for 14 days:i: 25 gg/kgBW/min of IL-lcc; II: 25 ~tg/kgBW/min of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-Ira); III: buffered vehicle. The animals were subjected to a 30% BSA, full thickness scald burn and the wounds then infected with 10 + cfu/mL Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Eight additional rats were anesthetized, but were not burned, and served as healthy controls. . IL-hx reduced food intake transiently but was otherwise without effect However, IL-lra significantly attenuated weight loss over the first 8 days and improved food intake between days 5 and 8. We conclude that blockade of IL-1 after a thermal injury with superimposed infection does not adversly affect the progression of the disease, but does attenuate the anorexia and weight loss associated with this model. These data indicate that IL-I receptor blockade may offer a means to minimize the morbidity associated with catabolic illness. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and its downstream induced mediators have pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of sepsis and septic shock. The suppressive effect of pentoxyfillin (PTX) on TNF production may be of clinical importance. When peripheral white blood ceils were stimulated with either LPS or Staphylococcus aureus, pentoxyfillin inhibited TNF production. In contrast, no inhibitory effect was observed on the induction of IL-6. PTX inhibited not only the TNF production of monocytes but also the TNF secretion of both granulocytes, and unseparated whole blood. The FACS analysis revealed that the expression of CD14 antigen on monocytes was not influenced by pentoxyfillin. The in vitro TNF and IL-6 producing capacity in septic patients were higher than in the control group, but decreased on subsequent days especially in fatal cases. Administration of PTX (200 mg/day) in septic patients resulted in TNF and IL-6 productions similar to those found in control donors. It also subsequently led to an improvement of the clinical status. A further improvement in APACHE score could be achieved by administration of Pentaglobin \u00b0 (Biotest)( 5ml/kg/day ). The prevention of LPSinduced in vitro TNF and IL-6 production by Pentaglobin \u00b0 could be demonstrated in in vitro experiments involving the use of whole blood rather than purified lymphocytes, very probably because of the presence of LPS binding protein in the plasma. The level of soluble ICAM-1 in sera of septic patients was significantly higher (800-1200 ng/ml) than in normal individuals (50-150 ng/ml), but it decreased following the PTX and Pentaglobin \u00b0 therapy. It is presumed that PTX and Pentaglobin \u00b0 can antagonize eytokine production at different levels, resulting synergistic action being beneficial in the treatment of sepsis.",

Splenic M6 from hemorrhage-resuscitated mice exhibited a significantly reduced cytotoxic response, whereas KC showed an enhanced cytotuxic capacity. The increased KC cytotoxicity is probably mediated through the increased expression of cell-associated TNF and the release of reactive nitrogen. The enhanced production of reactive nitrogen may play an important role in the clearance of microbes translocated from the gut following hemorrhage. However, excessive release of reactive nitrogen by KC may have deleterious effects on the adjacent hepatncytes.",

Thus, the use of ATP-MgCI~, dfltiazem, chloroquine or interferon-7 offers new therapeutic modalities in the treatment of immunosuppression and for decreasing the susceptibility to sepsis, which is observed following severe blood loss. The production of macrophages from bone marrow precursor cells is a dynamic and highly regulated process.

The impaired immune response associated with multiple system organ failure (MSOF) has been most widely studied following surgery for inflammatory disease and trauma. The majority of late deaths following trauma are due to infection and MSOF. Not all patients with multiple organ failure have concomitant infection present, yet most have been septic at some time in their hospital course. Their generalized inflammatory condition often persists whether or not organisms have been recovered. Immune failure probably precedes MSOF with or without overt infection and indeed may perpetuate such widespread sepsis. Macrophage tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) production is thought to represent an important pathogenic mechanism by which this is mediated. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) is a clinically relevant murine model of intra-abdominal infection and sepsis. Serum TNF and endotoxin levels, and peritoneal macrophage TNF production are only slightly elevated in this model even in endotoxin sensitive animals. Mortality in this model, therefore, does not appear to be attributed to overwhelming endotoxemia and/or TNF production. It has therefore been postulated that TNF and other cytokines may act in a paracrine fashion to Cause local injury. TNF messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was therefore measured and found to be increased in the lung and liver following CLP. A different pattern of expression was seen after endotoxin administration, characterized by a more rapid rise and fall, and enhanced TNF mRNA expression in the spleen as well. Route of spread of infection as well as the type of stimulus may determine the organ specific cytokine response. These data support the concept of locally produced TNF as a contributing factor in tissue damage and multiple organ failure during sepsis. The estimation of histamine's role in SIRS changed over the years based on increased knowledge in shock pathogenesis, evidence later found to be faulty, and the discovery of other, more fashionable mediators. Over the decades, the prevailing view has been that histamine is a noxious mediator contributing to the fatal outcome of shock.",

In the later phase of septic shock (low out-put, high resistance states), however, it can be assumed that histamine exerts strong vasodilator and positive inotropic effects via H2-receptors. These effects are considered beneficial in counteracting or attenuating the effects of sympathetic responses of catecholamines and other mediators. Thus, a blockade of the early reaction with Hi-antagonists and a stimulation of the H2-receptors by H2-agonists are worthwhile therapeutic approaches.

These mediators which are released in high concentrations by activated macrophages, endothelial cells, and connective tissue cells cause a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), thus leading to a shock-like state and tissue destruction. Recently, a number of proteins have been characterized in in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrating potent anti-inflammatory properties. These latter cytokines include interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-10 (IL=10), transforming growth factor-6 (TGF-J3), and the newly sequenced interleukin-13 (IL-I3). They are considered antiinflammatory, since in vitro studies using purified macrophage cultures or whole blood assays revealed an inhibitory effect of these antMnfiammatory cytokines on ~he synthesis and release of TNF-cL and IL-U3. In addition, they reduced the severity of disease and reduce plasma levels of TNF-c~ and IL-II3 when administered to animals with infection or inflammation. Furthermore, naturally occurring substances have been described that specifically neutralize the bioactivity of IL-1B and TNF-a. The IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-I ra) is related structurally to IL-I and binds to the same cell-surface receptors, but does not stimulate the cell. In animal models orE. coB-induced shock, inflammatory bowel disease, and peritonitis, injection of IL-lra significantly reduced the severity of disease. The cytotoxicity of TNF-c~ can be inhibited through two types of soluble TNF receptors (sTNFR) type I (p55) and type II (p75). These sTNFRs are proteolytic cleavage products of the cell-bound TNFreceptors. When given to baboons to combat E. coil-induced shock, soluble receptm's to the TNF type [ receptor decreased the severi~ of the shock-like state. It has been well accepted that shock and severe injury result in an increased release of proinflammatory cytokines with a high incidence of SIRS and MODS. Our studies investigating plasma levels of anti-inflammatory mediators (IL-4, IL-lra, sTNFRs) in patients after severe injury further suggest that shock and injury lead to an activation of anti-inflammatory processes with altered plasma levels of these mediators. However, while plasma levels of IL-4 and 1L-lra were significantly increased in trauma patients compared to healthy volunteers, sTNFRs did not differ from control samples. Thus, shock and severe injury result in different activation patterns of anti-inflammatory processes.",

This IL-2 deficiency could be an underlyin~ cause of all the afo~ementloned immune defects by failing to activate both helper and suppressor T cell functions. Mo~a recent work has focused on the molecular mechanisms of this IL-2 deficiency end shown that the defect lies post-transcrlptionally since mRNA for IL-2 is also depressed following thermal injury. We have also investigated the potential of a defect in Ii-2 receptor status on peripheral blood mononuclear uolls from patients fQllowing burn injury and in a murine model. In both oases no decrease in IL-2R was found either by phenotypic markers or by funational assays. Another hallmark of thermal injury is hyperao~ivatlon of proinflammatory ~ytok~ne secretion, which may play a significant role in multiple organ failure following burn injury. Therapy O~ major burn injury may reasonably be aimed, therefore, at up-regulating T cell ~unction and down-regulating hyperactive secretion Of proieflaam~ntory cytokines. The majority of patients dying of bums succumb to sepsis which coincides with dysfunction in the specific and non-specific host defences. Generally, concepts relating to the mechanism(s) of specific immune failure in thermal trauma imply that inhibition of T (CD4+) cell responses is imposed by the injury or infection-related factors. However, the same factors elicit strong biological reactions within the lymphoid compartment. Recent evidence indicates that systemic activation is inherent in the burn patient. To establish the relation of molecular and cellular events to the development of post-bum anergy we examined the state of and the capacity for T cell activation with regard to: 1) occurrence of activation-induced cell death (AICD), 2) activation-related phenotypic and functional_ diversity in the pool of peripheral CD4+ T cells. Initially, (up to 7 days post-bum), peripheral blood lympliocytes from severely injured (> 35% total body surface area) patients exhibited high levels of constitutive expression of surface receptor for ]L 2 (CD 25) and spontaneous blastogenesis. The presence of activation-related T cellproducts in bum plasma was also apparent. Subsequent impairment of the T cell receptor (TCR)-regulated T cell responses in vitro was accompanied by significantly increased DNA fragmentation that is associated with cell death by the mode of apoptosis. Using molecular markers we established that flesh peripheral blood ceils from immunosuppressed patients also contain large numbers of apoptotic cells. Fluctuations in the number of viable (PI-) peripheral blood lymphocytes involved primarily CD4+/CD45RO+ (memory) subset of T ceils. The above observations suggest that thermal trauma-associated T cell anergy develops through AICD, a phenomenon commonly associated with the tolerogenic activity of bacterial superantigens. Persistence of staphylococcal infections in the burn patient may support this assumption.",

The immune, nervous and endocrine systems interact via both direct and indirect pathways which utilize neuro and endocrine hormones, neurotransmitters, neurepeptides and immune cell products. It is now known that the immune system may be affected by all of the neuroendocrine products produced during a stress response, with evidence for innervation of iymphoid organs, lymphoid cell receptors for neuroendocdne products, and leukocyte production of chemicals which are virtually identical to certain neuroendocdne peptides (ACTH, endorphins). Trauma induced alterations in the equilibrium of various neuropeptides and neuroendocdne hormones have a significant impact on immune response potential, affecting control of proliferation, differentiation and function of immune cells. For example, the neurohormone melatonin is thought to be a natural antagonist to counteract glucocorticeid associated immunosuppression resulting from stressful challenges, such as surgery and trauma, Plasma melatonin levels are known to be significantly reduced in burn patients. The administration of exogenous me[atonin improved cellular immune response following burn injury in an animal model. Melatonin was also shown to have in vivo cytokine regulatory activity, increasing the potential for IL-2 secretion and downregulating excessive IL-6 and IFN~ in burn injured, stress susceptible mice.",

Animals receiving E were given a single dose daily of either 2.4 g/kg of E in a 20% solution by garage (GE), or 1.25 g/kg of sterile IVE in saline. Four hours following the last dose, bum animals were subjected to a 30% body surface area bum injury to their dorsum. Twentyfour hours following injury, the animals were sacrificed and spleen cells were harvested for assessment of lymphocyte function. Splenocytes were prepared by mincing the spleen, followed by incubation on glass petri dishes to remove adherent macrophages. Non-adherent cells were then tested for proliferative response to T-cell mitogen Concanavalin A (Con A) and B-cell mitogen lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Data were analyzed by ANOVA. RESULTS: Chronic alcohol exposure and burn injury independently inhibit lymphocyte response to Con A but not to LPS. The combination of E plus bum injury, however, pmfouedly decreases this response to both Con A and LPS as outlined in the This data clearly identifies the synergistic impairment of immune function produced by ethanol and bum injury. It is furthermore apparent that Ibis effect is gut mediated and that gastrointestinal exposure to alcohol is necessary to produce this effect. Further studies will work to identify cellular and subcellular mechanisms to explain this effect.

            "text": "In conclusion, our results demonstrate that changes in cell surface markers and cytokines can help evaluate the magnitude of tissue trauma in diffei'ent surgical approaches. The relationship between lymphocyte subpopulation changes after thermal injury and the increased susceptibility of burned patients to infection is unclear. In this study, we have attempted to correlate such subpopulation changes with the presence of infection in burned patients. Peripberal blood from 19 patients was monitored for lymphocyte subpopulation changes three times weekly for three weeks postburn and weekly thereafter for three additional weeks. Mean bum size was 44.7% (range 24%-84%) of total body surface and mean age was 38 years. Infection was diagnosed by carefully defined clinical and laboratory criteria and its presence or absence noted each time blood was drawn. Samples taken when patients had wound infection, bacteremia, or pneumonia were compared with samples taken in the absence of systemic infection. Whole blood samples were stained with four monoclonal antibodies, the red blood cells lysed and the leukocytes fixed and analyzed by flow cytometry. For each patient sample, the proportion of lymphocytes falling within the light scatter gates was determined as the percentage of cells negative for CD14 and most strongly positive for CD45. This percentage was used to correct each sample for the presence of debris or nonlymphocytic cells. The proportion of CD4 and CD8 positive cells was slightly greatc~ in the samples from infected patients, while the proportion of B cells (CD20+) was unchanged and NK (CD16+) cells were decreased by ahnos[ 50% compared to sampie~ li'om uuiuleclcd patients. The percentage of cells positive for CDIlb (c~ integrin) decreased sharply and CD4RO (memory cells) decreased slightly in samples from infected patients while the expression of the lymphocyte homing receptor and CD29 were unchanged. CD25 (IL2 receptor) and CD69 (early activation marker) were significantly increased in the samples from the infected patients while HLADR was unchanged. These changes in lymphocyte phenotype correlate with the presence of infection. If they closely precede or occur during the early development of infection they may be valuable clues to the mechanism of susceptibility following thermal injury. Trauma patients are subjected to an immediate massive impact on their host defense integrity due to the combined effect of tissue trauma, shock and endotoxemia. Cytoldnes are playing a crucial role within the course of an impaired cell mediated immune response (CMI) resulting from a disruption of intact M%/Tcell interaction. The current study was undertaken to further elucidate the mechanisms of dysfimctional CMI following major burn and mechanical trauma -via comparative analysis of mRNA expression and protein release. The major regulatory levels for different cytokines were determined in mitogen, respectively LPS stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures of trauma patients on consecutive days (13) t, 3, 5, 7 and 10 post injury. We analyzed the cumulative data for Interleukin-1 beta (IL-I[3), IL-2, IL-8 as well as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-~) and saw a considerable impairment of the protein release in the stimulated PBMC cultures until D5 post-trauma and recovery thereafter. *p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs control Comparing the autoradiographies of the specific cytokine mRNA expression with the protein release in the supernatants, we saw a good correlation between mRNA signal intensity and protein synthesis for IL-8 and 11,-2, suggesting that for these cytokines the main regulatory mechanisms are located at the pre-/transcriptional level. For the other cytokines investigated one has to suppose posttranseriptional mechanisms.",

            "text": "The analysis of our data clearly indicates a severe impairment of forward regulatory immune mechanisms following trauma. Most likely the regulatory mechanisms, that are involved are greatly different among the cytokines investigated. It may be concluded, that depressed CMI responses post-trauma are partly due to an impaired pro-inflammatory cytokine production. The severity of the injury (ISS) correlated with the development at multiple organ failure (MOF-score; r=0.612). The levels of mediators and markers of the inflammatory response were generally higher in the more severely injured group (ISS>30, n=16). I1-6, 11-8, G-CSF, FPA, and C3a -levels differed significantly (p<0.005) between the ISS-groups (>-< ISS 30) at the time of admission, whereas on day 3 TNFa, C3a, 11-6, and EalPI showed significant differences. Beyond the first week, major differences were restricted to PGE 2 and C3a. The formation of two groups with respect to later multiple organ failure (MOF < 3; MOF > 2 n= 14) yielded similar results. Leukocyte-FACS analysis revealed significant differences mainly in the CD14 (monocytes), CD3/CD25 (I1-2R + T-cells), and CD29/CD4 (TH 2calls) populations. Summarizing our findings we were able to detect some alterations in the surface antigens of immunocompetent cells. The inflammato D response, however, seemed to be more pronounced and correlates wi~ the further clinical course. Using an experimental bum model in rodents, we have demonstrated that administration of a full thickness, scald burn involving 20% or more of the total body surface area (TBSA) elicits systemic responses which are characterized by numerous alterations in T-ceU function (i.e., lymphokine production and contact hypersensitivity (CH) responses) plus an enhanced susceptibility to bacterial infection. In the present study we questioned whether the apparent systemic effects mediated by large burns would be elicited as site-specific alterations in immune function following administration of small area burn trauma (5% TBSA). Following a 20% TBSA burn, CH responses to contact sensitizing antigens were found to be altered. The depression in CH responses could be induced independent of the site used for topical skin sensitization. Following a 5% TBSA thermal injury, development of CH responses were affected in a site-specific manner. Immunization of 5% TBSA thermally injured mice in a site near the position of the burn resulted in depressed responsiveness, whereas immunization through a contralateral site resulted in responses that displayed both the intensity and kinetics of a CH response equivalent to sham-bumed mice. Similar systemic and site-limited changes in lymphokine production were observed with 20% and 5% TBSA thermal injuries, respectively. A 20% TBSA injury affected the lymphokine producing potential of all cells regardless of which lymphoid tissue the cells were isolated from. The effect of a 5% TBSA burn was significant but site-specific. Thus, ceils from lymph nodes receiving drainage from thermally injured tissue were specifically affected, whereas lymphokine production by cells from lymphoid organs receiving drainage from unaffected skin was normal. It was concluded that modulation of lymphokine production and cellular immune responses may be a normal consequence of burntrauma regardless of the size of the burn. Changes in immune competence can be mediated either regionally or systemically in direct proportion to the area of skin exposed to the burn injury.

Increase in plasma IgE was significantly greater in patients with sepsis syndrome (p=0.021) and renal failure (p<0.001). Although mean plasma IgE was higher with ARDS, pneumonia, hepatic dysfunction, and shock, these differences were not significant (p>0.05). Plasma IgE increase was not related to severity of injury by ISS score (p =0.42). The mean day to highest IgE was 9.1-+6.5. The day sepsis was first observed preceded the day of highest IgE by 4.2+6.6 days. There was a significant association between the day of sepsis onset and the day of highest IgE (p=0.018). Eight of nine patients with sepsis syndrome had > 100% increase in plasma IgE from admission. One patient's IgE levels were normal (20-100 ng/ml) for 24 days and then increased to 7300 ng/ml over the next 12 days, after onset of sepsis syndrome. Changes in IgE plasma levels may reflect the action of cytokines, such as IL-4, which concurrently regulate production of IgE and IL-1 receptor antagonist in a response to sepsis. Sepsis remains a leading cause of late mortality in trauma and HS. Although HS-induced bacterial translocation is supposed to be the major cause of sepsis and MOF, depression of the RES increases susceptibility to infection after injury. The purposes of this study were: a) to evaluate the RES in the lung, spleen and liver after HS and subsequent Hypertonic Saline (HSL) treatment, and b) to document the patterns of phagocytic activity in these organs during 24 hrs. Adult male Wistar rats (250+_23 gin) were submitted to HS (SBP 40 tort) and after t hr (Shock I hr) and 24 hrs (Shock 24 hrs) HSL (NaC17.5%, 3.5 ml/Kg) treatment, 1131 E. coli (I 131) was injected into the portal vein 10 ~tCi (n_>12). Twenty minutes later, the lungs, spleen and liver were harvested and scintilographic counts obtained. Data is depicted as mean_%+SEM * p<0.05, ~\" p<0.001 and statistical analysis was performed by Analysis of Variance and Wilcoxon tests. One hr after treatment, lung 1131 uptake was increased and liver and spleen 1131 uptake were reduced compared to sham. Twenty four hrs after treatment, all organs, except lung uptake, returned to normal values. Radioautographic histological analysis revealed radiolabeled particles inside phagocytic cells of all organs. We conclude that pulmonary phagocytic activity increases after 1 hr of HS HSL reatment, diminishing by 24 hrs although still above normal values. In contrast, RES suppression occurs in liver and spleen after 1 hr HS HSL treatment, returning to normal values by 24 hrs. These results may explain lung complications and immunosuppression after trauma. Infusion of endotoxin as well as major surgery is followed by lymphopenia in peripheral blood. The purpose of this study was to investigate to which tissues the lymphocytes are redistributed in response to endotoxaemia and major surgery. In addition changes in lymphocyte subpopulations and expression of MECII was measured.",

The redistribution of lymphocytes were imaged with af gamma camera, and calculated with an interfaces computer before, and 2, 4 and 6 hours after major surgery or infusion of endotoxin or saline. Interleukin-l~ and serum cortisol were measured. In addition we followed CD2, CD3, CDlla/b, CDIS, CD20, CD44, MHCII and CD4/CD8 ratio. Following endotoxaemia Interleukin-lf~ increased significantly, following endotoxaemia as well as major surgery serum cortisol increased significantly. Following major surgery as well as endotoxaemia there was significant lomphocytepenia in peripheral blood with a decreased CD4/CD8 ratio while the CD3 positive subpopulation increased. In addition there was a decrease in the expression of MHCII on the lymphocytes peripheral blood.

In contrast, in vitro ethanol exposure increased the production of inhibitory monokine, TGFI]. These results provide both in vivo and in vitro evidence for the effect of acute ethanol exposure increasing immunosuppression and cytokine shock. The 'systemic inflammatory response syndrome' (SIRS) with consecutive septic multi-organ dysfunction represents the major cause of late death following major mechanical and burn trauma. Systemic hyperinflammation and concurrent depression of cell mediated immune response (CMI) render the traumatized host anergic, resulting in profound susceptibility to opportunistic infection. Monooytes/macrophages (MO) play a central role within the host defense system in developing and manifesting states of injury, shock and sepsis. The mechanistic scrutiny of the synthesis patterns of crucial cccytokines appears to be a helpful tool to further analyse MO behaviour in the compromised individual. The objective of this study was to further dissect the characteristics of cytokine regulation in PBMC under stressful conditions, via analysis of the expression of CD14+ receptor, the proinflammatory mediator IL-6, the macrophage activating factor IFN-5,, and Neopterin (NPT) a metabolite of activated MO. We investigated PBMC's on consecutive days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 after mechanical trauma of 9 and after bum trauma of 5 patients (mean age 38~17 years; mean ISS 34\u00b12 pts). In trauma patients we saw a massive increase of PHA induced neopterin synthesis compared to controls. However, when discriminating the NPT levels in the supernatants for the amount of MO stimulated, the NPT output of the individual cell was lower compared to MO of nontraumatized individuals. Interestingly there was a contrary coarse in the cumulative protein release patterns of IL-6 and IFN-7 in mechanical versus burn trauma patients. Wheras in burn patients IFN-y was decreased significantly (16+5 U/ml) compared to controls (58+6 U/ml) as well as mechanical trauma (59+12 U/ml). IL-6 showed a significant suppression following mechanical trauma (662+58 U/ml) vs control (1266+91 U/ml) and bum patients. The rt~,NA signal intensity for beth eytokines was in concurrence with the protein release in more than 85% of the individual patients investigated. From these data we can conclude that the inadequate low NPT synthesis predominantly in bum patients appears to be a sign of cellular immaturity and is probably partly due to low T-cell IFNo T signals. In addition we could state that the quality of trauma is apparently responsible for the different synthesis patterns of ]L-6 and IFN-q,. It has been postulated that bacterial invasion or endotoxemia are necessary for cytokine production following burn injury. We studied the organ distribution and kinetics pattern of IL-fc~ (cell-associated IL-1 agonist) in eutrophic rats subjected to either 20% TBSA cutaneous scald injury (BI), muscle scald injury of equivalent 20% TBSA (MBI), sham muscle bum (resection of skin only, up to 20% TBSA) (SMBI), and sham cutaneous burn (SBI), followed by saline resuscitation (15 mUkg I.P.). Separate rats were infused with 15 mg/kg E.coli 0111:B4 LPS or saline LV. Unmanipulated rats were baseline normal controls. Liver, lung, spleen, ileum, thymus, kidney, skin, and plasma were harvested at various time-points within the first 24h. Tissues were frozen, weighed, homogenized, the homogenates centrifuged and the supernates assayed with a radioimmunoassay specific for rat IL-l(z (detection limit 150 pg/rnL). IL-lc~ was expressed as ng/g weight + SEM (lowest detectable amount 1.5 ng/gWT). IL-lo~ was constitutively present only in the skin (102 + 16.4 ng/gWT). Cutaneous burn and sham cutaneous bum induced biphasic elevations of IL-lcc in the liver and lung only, with maximal levels at 2.5h (in the liver, BI = 16.5 _+ 6.2 ng/gWT, SBI = 1.7 + 0.1 ng/gWT, p _< 0.05; in the lung, BI = 10.3 + 1.3 ng/gWT, SBI = 1.9 + 0.8 ng/gWT, p -< 0.002). Of note, both BI and SBI rats had detectable IL-I~ in the liver at timepoint 0 already (2 min real-time). These levels increased in parallel until 30 min and became eventually different by 1 log at 1 -2.5h. All other organs as well as plasma were below detection limits. Muscle burn injury and sham muscle burn (skin resection) induced similar elevations of IL-10~ in the liver at lh, indistinguishable from each other and from cutaneous burn. In contrast, LPS challenge induced dramatic elevation of IL-t~ in all organs tested except for the kidney; the spleen was the most responsive organ to LPS-induced IL-lo~ production. These data indicate that thermal or mechanical injuries induce very early and organ specific production of IL-1 c~ in vivo by mechanisms other than endotoxemia. Injury-induced complement and platelet activation may be involved as well as the neuro-endocrine axis, which may explain the low levels of IL-lo~ induction observed in all rats at the very early time-points.",

It remains unknown, however, if lIES affects cell mediated, specific immune functions after trauma and hemorrhage (hem). To study this, non-heparinized C3H/HeN mice underwent midline laparotomy to induce trauma and were then bled to and maintained at a BP of 40 mmI-Ig for 60 rain. The animals were then resuscitated with either 4 times (x) the shed blood vohune as lactated Ringer's solution (LRS) or 2x LRS + lx 6% lIES. Sham mice were neither hemorrhaged nor resuscitated. At 2 or 24 hours post hem serum, peritoneal (PM~) and splenic macrophages (SM~) were obtained. Bioassayes were employed to assess the levels of II-l, IL-6 ( Alternatively PMqb showed no differences in IL-1 release between all groups at 2 and 24h, while SM~ from the LRS + HEN group showed a depression at 24h. TNF production by PM~ was depressed in all groups at 2h and remained so in the LRS + HES group at 24h. SM~b showed decreased TNF release values in both hem groups at 2 and 24h. In summary, the levels of inflammatory cytokines (particularly the values of circulating IL-6) after trauma/hem are positively influenced by the administration of HES. This might be due to a protective effect on PMqb and SM~, but also on other cytokine producing cells, e.g. Kupffer ceils. We conclude that HES is not only a safe, but also beneficial agent in the resuscitation of patients atler trauma/bemorrhagic shock.

            "text": "Conclusions: Multiple trauma is associated with temporary endotoxemia. Endotoxins probably translocated from the gut cause specific increase of anti endotoxin antibodies in blood of the IgM-class. Endotoxins cause no increase of antibodies to gramposilave bacteria. IgM antibodies are most unspecific. During cardio-pulmonary bypass, as well as postoperatively, high levels of endotoxin, interleukin-6 (II-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured in 30 patients. I0 female and 20 male, ageing from 30 to 73 with a median age of 59. Blood sampling was done preoperatively, immediately after induction of anaesthesia, after thoracotomy, after cannulation of the aorta and right atrium after the first half of the reperfusion phase, after closure of the thorax, 2 and 4 hours after the operation and then every morning until the 5th postoperative day. Blood was drawn into heparinized tubes (I0 IU/ml) which were free of endotoxin. CRP levels were determined through the use of the Behring Nephelometer. 11-6 levels were measured by using commercially-available ELISA test. The endotoxin level was determined by a chromogenic modification of the limulus amebocyte test. The statistical analysis was done using the Wilcoxon ranks test and correlation analysis. A significant increase {p 0.01) in endotoxin plasma occurred during surgery, culminating in a peak (median value of 0.795 EU/m!) during reperfusicn. Plasma levels of endotoxin continued to be slightly raised till the 5th day after surgery, whereas those of interleukin-6 rose at the end of the operation and were at their highest 4 hours later (median value of 217.5 pg/ml). CRP levels were also high postoperatively with a median value of 114 mg/l, and were markedly raised on day 2 (191 mg/l). A definite, statistically significant correlation between the plasma levels of endotoxin and 11-6 during the operation was establisthed (p 0.05), leading us to conclude that the endotoxin liberated during cardiac surgery acts as the main trigger in the releasing of 11-6, and thus induces the postoperative acute phase reaction. There was no evidence of a correlation between CRP and endotoxin or 11-6 plasma levels. Impaired immune function is well described following trauma and hemorrhagic shock (HS). Prior studies have utilized peripheral blood or spleen cells to index immune function following HS. However, changes in mucosal immunity are not weII characterized in this setting. Gut origin sepsis is thought to be an important cause of organ failure and death following trauma. A rodent model was utilized to allow comparison of mucosal-associated immune function vs, systemic compartments after HS.",

We have found that transplantation of bone marrow in a hind-limb graft to syngeneic lethally irradiated recipient is followed not only by rapid repopulafion but also overpopulation of bone marrow cavities. The question arises whether this unexpected phenomenon could be the result of stimulation of stem cells by factors (cytokines) released from surgical wound at the site of anastomosis of graft with recipient. AIM OF THE STUDY was to investigate which tissues damaged during the procedure of limb transplantation may be a potential source of humoral factors accelerating in vivo bone marrow proliferation. METHODS. Experiments were carried out on LEW rats in 5 groups. In group I, the hind limb was transplanted orthotopically to a syngeneic recipient; in group II, sham operation was performed; in group III, a four-cm long cutaneous wound was made on the dorsum; in group IV, limb skin was harvested, fragmented and implanted into peritoneal cavity; in group V, BM from femur and tibia was implanted intraperitoneally. BM, lymphoid tissues and blood were sampled 10 and 30 days later for cell concentration and phenotype evaluation. RESULTS. The yield of nucleated cells from tibia was on day 10 in the control 29.3 + 3.2, in group 1 58.1 +2.0, in group II 47.1 + 1.6, in group III 50.8+2.0, in group IV 48.5_+2.0, in group V 37.4_+4.9x10(6). The evident increase in BMC yield in all groups continued until day 30. Increase in weight and total cell count of spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes in all but group III was also found. No differences in percentage of maturing erythroid cells, but higher of mature myeloid cells and lower of lymphocytes were observed. CONCLUSIONS. Trauma of skin, muscles, and bone brought about an increase in bone marrow cellularity and acceleration of maturation of myeloid lineage. Transplantation of BM ceils alone did not produce this effect. Transplantation of BM in limb graft is a good model for studies of natural factors reaulatin~ BM hemormesis.

The following parameters were determined pre-, peri-, and postoperatively: Elastase and CRP as indicators of activation of PMN-leukocytes and injury severity; prostacyclin (PGI 2) and thromboxane (TXA~) as parameters of lung endothelial response; prostaglandin F2~ (PGF~) and PGM representing pulmonaly metabolic activity; PGE a and neopterin as proof of macmphage activation. Statistics were performed using analysis of variance for repeated measures. Results: Group B pts revealed postoperatively an increase in CRP (p<0.001) indicating a higher injury severity in comparison to the thoracoscopic procedure (C). Both, controls (A) and group C pts did not show PMN-activation, whereas group B demonstrated a reversible increase in elastase. Surgical trauma caused in all groups a release of PGI z and TXA 2 which was more pronounced in C (p<0.05) and most in B (p<0.01). Similar results were found for PGE~ and PGF2=. There was no activation of maerophages since neopterin did not increase. Apparently, metabolic lung function was not impaired because there was no marked rise in PGM except in B (p<0.05 vs. C). Discussion: Our results demonstrate that lung tissue injury aggravates the mediator release induced by thoracic traum. These mediators among others are able to increase capillary pressure and hence lung edema formation. Impairment of lung function, however, seems dependent on the extent of the liberation. Therefore, the maximal release reactions occured in group B and C after lung tissue resection, whereas the controls showed the highest levels immediately after the incision. We conclude that thoracoscopic procedures are superior in reducing the resection trauma per se and hence might prevent severe mediamr-induced (pulmonary/systemic) sequelae. In a prospective study we investigated 45 patients using radiochemical method according to Sch~dlich (S) and photometric method according to Hoffmann (H). Serum of severly traumatized patients was withdrawn directly after admission at our emergency room and in narrow time intervals during first 24 hours after trauma. Follow up control samples were taken daily until day ten. Whereas no elevated PLA-CA was found during first 24 hours, a peak was regularly observed around day four. There was high correlation between PLA-CA and ISS (r=0.71, p<O.O001) except patients suffering from thoracic trauma, Thoracic trauma {TT) provoked similar gons-score-and PLA-CA-values compared to multiple trauma (MT) despite significantly lower ISS: PLA-CA (H) MT 32.9 + 6.4",

A control group of 30 healthy volunteers was also evaluated. AAT and Cp showed increased values from day 3 which kept elevated untill the end of the study. AMG elevated from day 24. When infection developed, AAT and Cp values were even higher whereas AMG values decreased. Fixation rejection caused AAT, AMG and Cp increment. AAT and Cp increment in non complicated fractures might be due to accompanying inflamation, by means of cytokines release and APRPs hepatic synthesis induction. Therefore, increment is higher when infection or rejection develop. AMG behaviour at early stages of evolution is secondary to hiperconsumption, considering mean life shortening after proteases ligation. AMG modifications in fixation rejection remain obscure.",

Clinically, APRPs might be useful parameters in determining complications onset in fractures evolution. Hemorrhagic shock (HS) is a common complication of trauma, as well as some major surgical procedures. The alteration of the immune system by HS is thought to contribute to the increased septic morbidity and mortality seen in these patients. Multiple mediators are released following HS. IL-1, IL-6, TNF, PGE 2 and TGF-B have all been implicated in these immune system changes. In vitro, PGE 2 causes many of the immune system changes following HS, yet the time course of PGE 2 release has not been well deliniated. The aim of this study was to determine the time course of PGE 2 release by peritoneal and splenic macrophages following HS. C3H/HEN mice were bled to a mean BP of 35+5 mm Hg for 60 minutes. The animals were resuscitated with the shed blood and normal saline. Control animals were cannalated, but blood was not withdrawn. The animals were sacrificed at 2, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours following HS. Peritoneal and splenic macrophages were harvested from each animal and cultured with LPS for 24 hours. The supernatants were collected and frozen until assayed. PGE 2 was assayed using an ELISA (Cayman Chemical). Results are shown below for the peritoneal macrophages: PGE 2 release by peritoneal macrophages was significantly elevated at 24, 48 and 72 hours over control. It was maximal at 48 hours, but by 72 hours it had started to decline. Splenic macrophage PGE2 release was much more variable. (Data not shown.) There was less consistency between time points and no clear trend was seen. In conclusion, PGE 2 is significantly elevated at 24 hours following HS, and reaches a peak at 48 hours. PGE 2 release may be responsible for the immune system changes seen in the first few days following HS. Splenic and peritoneal macrophages resPOnd differently in their release of PGE 2 following HS; which may be due to differences in their milieu. There is an obvious association between the altered immunocompetence of patients following traumatic injury of various types and the increased riskto develop complications. The present investigation was undertaken in order to analyze the value of both Neopterin (N) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in monitoring disease course in patients with multiple trauma. We were interested to compare Nconcentrations as marker of T-cell/Macrophage activation with CRP levels as indicator of the inflammatory acute-phase response Daily serum concentrations(N and CRP) were measured in 12 patients (9 male, 3 female, mean age 31.42), admitted to our ICU following serious trauma (mean ISS=34) and in 10 control subjects. The clinical course of each patient was evaluated with APACHEII score according to Knaus. Mean stay in ICU was 9.25 (range 5-13). 5 patients didn't develop organ failure(NOF-group), 4 patients survived, developing MOF (S,MOF-group), 3 patients died with MOF (NS, MOFgroup).

Although several in vitro studies suggested the catalytic action of iron in oxygen free radical generation, few data are available concerning iron-metabolism following ischemia-reperfusion injury and hemorrhage in vivo. Aim of the present studies was to evaluate iron metabolism following mild and severe hemorrhage in the presence and absence of intraperituneal hematoma. Methods. Male Lewis rats (300 g) divided in 4 groups (observation time 120 hrs): A: mild hemorrhage by sequential blood sampling (0.9 ml each)(0, 2, 4, 6, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 hrs). B: A with hemoperitoneum (HP)(2 ml/100g), C: hemorrhagic shock: blood withdrawal of 3 ml/100g over 30 min and resuscitation with Ringer's lactate (2 x shed blood) and isogenic donor blood; D: C with HP. Parameters: serum iron ([g/dl], ferrozin-method); 59Fe labeling of erythrocytas (application of 1 Ci 59Fe i.a. into a donor rat, 5 days later bleeding of the rat and injection intraperitoneally in experimental rat; plasma transferrin ([g/ml], RIA). T-tests and Mann Whitney. Data are expressed as mean + SEM. Results. Compared to baseline, mild and severe hemorrhage caused a significant increase in serum iron at 24 and 48 hrs, respectively (212+30 vs. 248+35; 185+_28 vs. 255+_22). HP reduced this increase (209+_17 vs. 177+21; 194+25 vs. 197+-48, p<.05). I-IP significantly increased hemoglobin between 24 to 96 hrs in mild (12.1+_.8 vs. 14.2+.7) and severe hemorrhage (10.3+.6 vs. 13.1+.6). In mild and severe hemorrhage comparable maximal resorption (59Fe labeled erythrocytes in circulating blood) of intraperitoneal hematoma occured at 24 hrs (mild: 318+_71 vs. severe: 364+-114 counts/rain). HP increased survival-rate following hemorrhagic shock (no HP: 10/17; HP: 10/13). In mild hemorrhage no alterations of plasma transferrin concentrations. In shock group without HP, there was at 96 hrs a significant higher transferrin level than with HP alone (3.2+_.5 vs. 2.23 + .2). In conclusion, hemoperitoneum with hemorrhage prevents increase in plasma iron levels by increasing hemoglobin through resorption of erythrocytes and thereby suppressing iron mobilization from endogenous iron resources, e.g. liver. This suggests that intraperitoneal hematoma not necessarily promotes iron-mediated oxygen free radical production, especially since survival in these groups was improved. Increased transfarrin levels in group C at the end of the experiment suggest increased iron turnover which was not observed in shock groups associated with hemoperitoneum. Primary immune response to thymus-dependent (SRBC) and thymus-independent (Vi-polysaccharide) antigens was determined during 30 days after CCT. Antigenic challenge was made on day i, 5, 15 or 30. Number of spleen plaque forming cells (PFC) and serum haemagglutinin (HA) titre were studied on day 5 after immunization.

Endothelin is a 21 amino acid peptide produced by ischemic or injured endothelial cells. In vitro and in animal studies, ET is also a potent constrictor for renal mesangial and coronary vessels, a negative cardiac inotrope and an endocrine regulator. Our lab has shown that ET is an agonist for monocyte production of interleukins i, 6 & 8, prostaglandin E 2 (PGE2) , and substances which trigger superoxide production. Systemic ET levels increase in hypoperfused and septic patients, and ET may be yet another important cytokine in critical illness. But while ET has been shown to be a potent vasoconstrictor in healthy dogs, systemic vascular resistance does not increase in critically ill patients with high ET levels. (We hypothesize that this might be due to PGEz-mediated vasodilation predominating over ET-mediated vasoconstriction.) We next asked what happened to systemic ET levels in patients with major burns (>20%.) Ten hemodynamically stable patients resuscitated by a modified Parkland formula to a urine output >30 cc's per hour had ET levels drawn on admission, at i, 6 12, 24, and 48 hrs. ET levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Mean levels were elevated at 205\u00b128 pg/ml at all time points versus levels in healthy controls of 39\u00b19. In summary, systemic ET levels increase significantly in patients with major burns. ET may be yet another cytokine playing a significant role in the immune, inflammatory and multiorgan dysfunction observed with major burns. Restoration processes in an organism after ischemic damage are realized through ~n~lammatory mechanisms~ the intensity of which is significantly defined by blood levels of neuropeptides.

At the same time low intitial levels of substance P slowed down the development of necrotic processes which lead to delay in refunctioning of the heart and complicated the healing process. Thus, regulation of the levels of neuropeptides in the blood in trauma forms a perspective method of its treatment.",

Compared to open abdominal surgical procedures (LAP), laparaseopic surgery (LSC) is associated with a decrease in hospital stay and in accelerated patient recover. The aim of the study was to evaluate the sensitivity of the immune sermn parameters of IL-6, SAA and neopterin, the percentage of CD14+ cells, the in-vitro IL-2 synthesis after mitogen stimulation and lymphocyte proliferation, in order to purposefully discriminate differences in the severity of trauma. We investigated the blood of 27 patients with cholecystolithiasis undergoing either laparascopic (16) or open (I 1) cholecystectomy on consecutive perioperative days -1, 1, 2 and 3. There was no significant difference between the two groups concerning age and sex. Patients with clinical signs of acute cholecystitis were excluded from the study. Operation time and hospital stay were obviously longer in LAP patients (67 versus 145 minutes, 5 versus 20 days) compared to the LSC group. Concerning the unspecific acute phase reaction we could show no difference in the increment of senun amyoid A (SAA) synthesis in the LSC group (D-I 40 + 1 lng/ml, D1 362 + 43ng/ml) versus LAP group (D-1 61 + 19ng/ml, D1 457 + 45ng/ml), while in serum IL-6 levels we saw a less steep increment in the LSC group (7-fold from D-1 to D 1) compared to the LAP group (10-fold from D-1 to D 1). The analysis of CD14+ receptor expression and serum neopterin did not reveal any difference between the groups. Lymphocyte function showed an impairment of proliferation to antigen stimulation in LAP (D -1:24.000 + 3.330 cpm, D 1:17.300 + 3.000 cpm) compared to the LSC group (D -h 22.500 + 4.200 cpm, D h 26.000 + 2.900 cpm). In both groups IL-2 synthesis was decreased post-operatively. Our data indicate that laparascopic cholecystectomy reusults in a less distinct unspecific acute phase reaction post-trauma compared to that following LAP. Neopterin serum levels and CD14 receptor expression show that these parameters apparently are less useful markers to detect differences of surgical trauma severity while it appears that the impact of LAP is reflected most impressively on the lymphocyte compartment.

Confronted with the routine procedure of prophylactic treatment of candidates for surgery in a rural African hospital, we initiated studies on the fre'Quency of post-surgical malaria. In Tanzania 195 non-pregnant patients from rural areas were followed. Of preoperative patients 10% had a parasitaemia and those maintaining it showed no increase or complaints. Nine percent of patients without detectable parasitaemia before surgery came down afterwards and one-third had malaria-like complaints. Spinal and general anaesthesia were equally applied in these last patients. In Burkina Faso we studied 120 patients of which 16% had a parasitaemia on admission and 6% had postoperative malaria. Half of the surgical patients came from rural areas, whilst only 14% of those with malaria lived in the city (with much less exposure and immunity). 57% underwent major surgery and 43% minor. Bloodtransfusions (4% with parasites) never evoked a parasitaemia in recipients. Post-surgical malaria is thus a reality in about 10% of the adult cases, both in East and West Africa. Surgery evokes a cascade of factors, varying from cortison to interleukines and acute phase proteins; immune responses may temporarily be suppressed. Clinical attacks of malaria in otherwise immunes could be evoked by one of these factors. Though malaria can easily be cured, the differential diagnosis is difficult because of post-surgery fevers; we found that 16% was treated without justified indication.

            "text": "We have recently shown that the combined administration of noninjurious doses of LPS and PAF in the rat produce ARDS-like lung injury characterized by neutrophil adhesion to lung capillary venules, neutrophil accumulation in lung parenchyma, pulmonary edema, and increased protein and neutrophil count in BAL fluid. This new paradigm of lung injury was associated with elevated serum TNFc~ and pretreatment with anti TNFa mAb dose-dependently prevented these responses. Also, the combined administration of LPS and PAF induced lung mRNA levels of TNFe~ (5 fold vs. LPS or PAF alone), lL-lg (80 fold), KC (60 fold) and IL-6. Taken together, these data suggest that this new paradigm of lung injury is cytokinemediated and that LPS/PAF in vivo can functionally couple to the activation of gone expression of a multi-cytokine network system, all of which may be involved in the pathogenesis of ARDS. Materials and methods. The sheep model included hemorrhagic shock and closed femoral nailing at day 0, 12hourly injections of E. coli endotoxin and zymosan-activated autologous plasma at clays 1-5 and further observation and measurements at days 6-10. From venous blood and bronchoalveolar lavage(BAL)fluid of ten merino sheep (mean weight 30 kg) neutrophil counts (10e6 PMN/ml blood or epithelial lining fluid-ELF-), the ELF/ plasma ratio of albumin (R), and the zymosan-induced (stim) and non-induced (spont) chemiluminescence response (CL) of blood (10e6 cpm/250,000 PMN), and of blood-and BAL-isolated PMN (10e6 cpm/25,000 PMN) were measured. For statistical calculations the Wilcoxon test was used. Data of the Changes in polymorphonucleur leukocyte (PIVINL) metabolism have been suggested to play a pivotal part in the post-traumatic systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The underlying cellular mechanisms which control this response are not yet completely understood. Since the 'Ca 2+ second messenger'-system has been shown to be involved in regulation of PMNL-'respiratory burst', we investigated changes in PMNL-Ca z\u00f7 regulation in relation to oxygen free radical mediated injury. Methods. In 12 polytranmatized patients (mean injury severity score = 32) arterial and venous blood samples during 15 days. Daily evaluation of Horowitz-quotiant (PO2/FiO2), plasma lactate (mg/dl) and body temperature ( Results. Body temperature peaked at day 6 and 7 (day 0: 36+.4; day 7: 39.8+.4). Plasma lactate was significantly increased at day l (36+2) and day 7 (16.2+2). Hurowitz-quotient (day 0: 344+43) was low at day 4 (199+19) and day 7 to 10 (178+25)(p<.05). At day 7 a substantial rise in venous PMNL-superoxide production (day 5: 1.9+_.45, day 7: 3.3+.7, day 9: 1.72+_.8), oecured with significant increase in plasma lipid peroxidation (day 1:0.6+0.2 ; day 7: 1.3+0.2). PIVIN~-myeloperoxidase activity was high at day 2 (2.3+--.5) and then continuously declined (day 7: 1.3+.3). Plasma antiexidant activity (glutathione pemxidase) was reduced by 34% at day 7 (day 1: 5.3+.3; day 4: 4.4+_.2; day 7: 3.5+.2). Whereas basal Ca 2+ concentration remained unchanged (day 4: 68+_17, day 7: 68+_15), FMLP-stimulated cytosolic Ca 2+ mobilization increased at day 7 (day 4: 457+89, day 7: 11084410, day 9: 670+262). Conclusion. The present study in polytraumatized patients shows, that seven days after injury the agonist-induced PMNL Ca 2+ mobilization is significantly enhanced. At the same time, PMNL-oxygen free radical release and phagocytotic activity, systemic fever response and lactate concentrations were maximal. These observations were accompanied by post-tranmatic respiratory failure and in some patients by clinical signs of multiple organ failure. Preliminary data from an ongoing study using HES-and dextran-infusions in these patients show attenuation of this inflammatory response.",

            "text": "The selectins are a family of adhesion molecules (L-selectin, E-selectin, Pselectin), all of whom are implicated in inflammatory cell transendothelial migration. They, as a family can be proteolytieally cleaved from their parent cell and exist in a soluble form within the circulation. ARDS is a disease state in whic neutrophils and neutrophil transendotheliat migration have been implicated. In this study we wished to investigate whether the levels of these circulating soluble receptors from patients at-risk of ARDS at initial hospital presentation, correlated with subsequent ARDS progression. Eighty-two patients were enrolled (pancreatitis (n=19), perforated bowel (n=12), and multiple trauma (n=51)), of whom 14 progressed to ARDS. Assays for soluble L,P & E-selectin were performed on collected plasma samples via a sandwich ELISA. (NS = Not significant, **** = p<O.0001) We have found a highly significant inverse correlation between a low circulating soluble L-selectin (and not soluble E & P-selectin) and subsequent ARDS. These results further our understanding of neutrophilendothelial interactions in the early stages of ARDS pathogenesis and offer the promise of sL-selectin in combination with other markers of inflammatory events being used to identify individuals at particularly high risk of ARDS progression on initial hospital presentation. It has been suggested that polymorphonuclear leukocytes aggregate in the lung capillaries of patients developing the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and account for the endothelial damage while releasing toxic metabo-Iites such as o.a. free oxygen radicals. Among many antioxidants which have been investigated in in vitro systems and in animal models, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been established to be useful as a free radical scavenger in vivo. To assess the influence of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on the activation of neutrophils in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery with extracorporeal circulation (ECC), we evaluated the plasma levels of elastase and myeloperoxidase (MPO) throughout the operation and up to 24 hours after surgery. Four hours after surgery also a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed. A spectrophotometric method was used for the detection of plasma elastase activity and MPO levels were measured using a radioimmunoassay. We found that pretreatment with intravenous NAC prevented the increase in elastase activity (632 _+ 231 pmol/I vs 1666 _+ 187; P -0.027), but not the release of neutrophil related mediators (2.20 _+ 0.56 ng/I vs 1.80 _+ 0.17; P=0.63). Besides, NAC had the capability to prevent the enhancement of neutrophil numbers in lavage fluid as is normally seen during CPB (1.4 + 0.8 % vs 25.0 _+ 14.3; P =0.04). Although not significant, NAC prevented also the increase in elastase levels in lavage fluid (19.0 + 18.5 pmol/I vs 172.7 + 101.4; P = 0.12). It is concluded that NAC is able to protect against the inactivation of a 1-proteinase inhibitor, the main inhibitor of elastase activity, and that NAC interferes with adhesion and migration of neutrophils. Therefore NAC may be useful in the prevention of tissue damage. This study is supported by Inpharzam Belgium. Sodium nitroprnsside (SNP) has previously been shown to attenuate the neutrophil induced lung injury associated with limb ischaemia and repeffusion. Glyceryl Trinitrate (GTN), already widely used in aortic surgery, also increases nitric oxide but has a less marked splanchnic \"steal\" effect. We examined the effect of GTN on lung injury, neutrophil infiltration and activation in a model of aortic occlusion (30 rain) and repeffusion (120 min). Sprague Dawley rats were randomized into: control (N=I 1); ischaemia repeffusion (IR) (N=12); and IR treated with GTN (2ug/kg/min) during repeffusion (N=10). Myeloperoxidase activity (MPO) measured pulmonary neutrophil influx. Pulmonary endothelial permeability was measured by wet to dry weight ratio (W/D), broncboalveolar lavage protein (BAL) and neutrophil counts (BAL pmn). Neutrophil superoxide release (mean channel fluorescence MCF) was measured by flow cytometry in a further IR v GTN experiment (N=6 per group).",

LIPTON Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is marked by increased vascular permeability of the lung to white blood ceils (WBC). Indeed, influx of WBC into the lung is believed to be the central mechanism in acute lung injury of ARDS. Evidence is developing that the neuropeptide c~-melanocyte stimulating hormone (c~-MSH), a proopiomelanocortin derivative, inhibits inflammatory reactions in animaI models of inflammatory responses in humans. To test the influence of a-MSH on experimental ARDS, the peptide was administered to rats after intratraeheal infusion of endotoxin (S. typhosa, 500 #g in 0.25 ml saline). Three groups (n=10 each) received: intratracheai infusion of endotoxin plus ip injections of o~-MSH (100 ~tg in 0.2 ml saline) at 0, 2, and 4 hr post-endotoxin treatment; intratracheal endotoxin infusion plus saline injections; control intratracheal saline infusion plus saline injections. The BAL data showed overall differences among groups (F2,29=6.2, p<.003), o~-MSH treatment inhibited endotoxin-induced WBC migration into the pulmonary tree (p<.05). Circulating WBC counts were markedly lower in both groups given endoroxin than in the control group (p<.01), but there was no difference in WBC count between these two endotoxin-treated groups. The results indicate that c~-MSH can reduce WBC migration in experimental lung injury. In further experiments we tested the hypothesis that c~-MSH, administered alone or in combination with an inhibitor of gram-negative bacterial growth, increases survival in a model of peritonitis/endotoxemia/septie shock. Cecal ligation and puncture were performed under sodium pemobarbital anesthesia (75 mg/kg, i.p.) in female BALB/c mice (16-20g) that were then randomly assigned (15-17 mice per group) to receive at time 0 and 3 hr later: control saline thjectioas (i.p.), injections of ~-MSH (100 ~tg), gentamicin sulfate (I0 mg/kg), or both ~-MSH and gentamicin. One ml of normal saline was given s.c. to each animal for fluid replacement. Both Ix-MSH and gentamicin treatments administered singly improved survival; when given in combination survival was even greater These findings suggest that the anticytokine ot -MSH molecule might be useful for treatment of systemic inflammation, perhaps particularly when used in combination with agents that inhibit bacterial growth. Previous studies showed a close relationship between xanthine oxidase activation, membrane damage and postischemic cardio-respiratory failure following aortic clamping and reperfusion. Aim of the present study was to evaluate alterations of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL)-metabolism and signal lransduction systems during ischemia/reperfusion induced by aortic clamping in man. Methods, In 14 Patients (3 female, 59+4 years) with elective reconstruction of infrarenal aortic anearysms, arterial (a) and venous (v) blood samples were obtained before clamping and declamping, and 60 min after declamping. Arterial PLA 2 concentrations were higher than venous (113+32 vs. 71+30). While cytosolic basal PMNL Ca 2+ concenlxation was not altered at the end of ischemia (v: 52.3+8; a: 42_+6) and during reperfusion (v: 60+8; a: 69+12), FMLP-stimulated cytosolic Ca 2+ mobilization showed a significant arterial increase as compared to venous (1652_+601 vs. 638+85, p < .05). These presented data indicate that the reperfusion syndrome after infrarenal aortic clamping is characterized by 1) pulmonary membrane damage possibly due to PMNL-degranulation, 2) activation of PMNL-superoxide radical production with release of activated PMNL in arterial circulation, and 3) a significant arterial increase of PMNL cytosolic Ca 2+ mobilization after FMLP-stimulation parallel to PMNL-activation. In conclusion, ischemia/reperfusion in man induces pulmonary damage and activation of PMNL superoxide production possibly due to an altered PMNL-Ca 2+ messenger system by inflammatory mediators (e,g. II-8, TNF, PAF). The septic lung diseases (i.e. ARDS) generally show distinct alveolar damage and surfactant disturbances. It is thought that alveolar macrophages are involved in specific release products like H202 and cytokines like TNF. In this pathway the type II alveolar epithelial cell (P2 cell) is not only an important target, but as recently shown it is also capable of producing H202. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of endotoxin on H202 release of P2 cells. We obtained P2 cells from lungs of female wistar rats and investigated the effect of lipopolysaccharid (LPS) on H202 release of fresh isolated cells and on cells cultured for 2 days in a fibronectin matrix. Furthermore we conditioned isolated alveolar macrophages for 16 hours with 1 p.g/ml LPS and tested the conditioned medium (MCM) on cultured P2 cells. P2 cells 5 h ex vivo were _> 70 % pure, _> 95 % vital and had an basal H202 release of 64.5 _+ 1.8 nmol H202 per hour and million cells. Adding 1 p.g/ml LPS to the incubation medium the H202 release decreases slightly but significantly to 54.2 _+ 2.3 nmol. Adding 0.3 p.g/ml phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) to the basal incubation medium the H202 release increased 3-fold to 148.3_+ 26 nmol. PMA induced H202 release decreased to 128.3 + 41.5 nmol after addition of 1 p.g/ml LPS. After 2 culture days the P2 cells were _> 98 % pure and showed a PMA inducible H202 release of 174.8 _+ 9.9 nmoL Addition of 1 p.g/ml LPS had the inverse effect as on freshly isolated cells as it increased the H202 release up to 216.2 _+ 2.4 nmol. Addition of MCM to cultured P2 cells increases PMA-stimulated H202 release to 223.3 +_ 10.7 nmol. The release decreased to 191.9 _+ 2.4 nmol when an murine anti-TNF-alpha antibody was added. Vitality of cultured cells was > 96 % in all experiments. The results show that LPS has an direct effect on P2 cells cultured on fibronectin. We conclude that the observed additional stimulatory effects of MCM seems to depend on TNF-alpha. The induction of H202 release of P2 cells could be important for generating internal oxidative stress in P2 cells before external oxygen radicals exceed. The produced H202 did not necessarily damage P2 ceils, but it can effect surfactant metabolism, especially when extracellular H202 release of alveolar macrophages following an immune response is increasing. INTRODUCTION: Primary stabilization of femoral shaft fractures in patients with multiple trauma is beneficial. However, in patients with associated lung contusion we have found an increased incidence of ARDS, apparently associated with primary Reamed Femnral Nailing (RFN). Previous animal studies revealed, that perioperative disturbances of lung ftmetion appear to be related to the reaming procedure, IX~ssibly due to pulmonary embolizafion of bone marrow fat. In a prospective clinical analysis we compared effects of intrameduUary nailing with and withont reaming on parameters known to be related to ARDS-pathoganesis. In order to gain further insight into the role of endotoxin and cytokines in the pathogenesis of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), we enrolled 23 patients with severe lung injury after sepsis (17) or polytrauma (6) and obtained multiple blood samples (14 days) for endotoxin, tumor necrosis factor e (TNFa), interleukin 18 (IL-18) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) determination.",

The difference among stimulated cytokines levels and the basal plasma concentrations were defined as \"delta values\", an expression of the cytokine releasing capacity of the blood. The pao2/fiao2 quotient was used as an index of the severity of lung injury (SLI). The endotoxin plasma level was significantly higher in patients with SLI < 200 (0.288 \u00b1 0.038 EU/ml, mean values \u00b1 SEM) versus the patients with a SLI > 200 (0.175 \u00b1 0.023 EU/ml, p<O.01). The basal plasma concentration of ll-6 also correlates with the SLI index (p<O.O01). The delta TNFe and delta IL-6 values were s~gnificantly decreased in patients with a severe lung injury. Compared with the survivors (n:11), the deceased patients (n=12) showed higher endotoxin level, a reduced TNFa and IL-6 releasing capacity of the blood and higher basal IL-6 levels. We can conclude that endotoxemia, high IL-6 plasma level and a decreased capacity of the blood to release TNFa an IL-6 under endotoxin stimulation associates with the severity of lung injury.

IL-8 increased in the lung is an important mediator of neutrophil recruitment and activation in the lung. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) is commonly used to cause edema and other tissue damages in the lung. Lung injuries induced by the administration of PMA has been shown to be mediated mainly by neutrophils. Neutrophils recruited to the lower respiratory tract may damage lung tissues by releasing reactive oxygen species, neutral proteases and lysosomal enzymes. The present study was conducted to investigate whether c~tocopherol, entrapped in dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes and delivered directly to the lung, could counteract some of the PMA-induced lung injuries. Plain liposomes or c~tocopherol-containing liposomes (8 mg c~-tocopherol/kgbody wt.) were instilled into the lungs of rats 24 h prior to PMA exposure (25 pg/kg, intratracheally) and treated rats were killed 3 h later. Lungs of control animals exposed to PMA developed increases in lung weight and lipid peroxidation as well as decreases in lung angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activities. PMA treatment also caused an increase in myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the lung, suggestive of neutrophi] infiltration. Pretreatment of PMA-treated rats with plain liposomes had no effect on PMA-induced injuries. In contrast, pretreatment of rats with liposomal c~-tocopherol, 24 h prior to PMA administration, resulted in a significant elevation of pulmonary a-tocopherol concentration, accompanied by a concomitant reduction in MPO activity and reversal of PMAinduced changes in lung edema, lipid peroxidation, ACE and AKP activities.",

Sixteen other animals were divided into two groups receiving either ~-l-fucose 100 mg iv or metylprednisolone 150 mg iv 15 min before PMA admininstration. Results:After PMA administration notable physiological changes including marked increase in MPAP(2.0-+O.~6 kPe3 ..lere found. The increase of NPAP was observed to be completely blocked in both groups of animals which received ~-l-fucose or metylprednisolone. Conclusion:In aur rabbit model ARDS CZ-l-fucose pretreatment prevents pulmonary hypertension after PMA administration. The effect is comparable with high dose metylprednisolone. The possible explanation is that G-l-fueose molecules block iectin domains of GNP-140 or ELAM-I preventing the adhesion of the neutrophils to the pulmonary endotheliom.",

            "text": "Bartens C, Elmadfa I, Steltzer H, Fischer M, Druml W Introduction: Various micronutrients and vitamins are particulary effective in modulating immune functions and host defense. The nutritive ant\u00b1oxidants vitamin C, E and B-carotene, as well as selenium lower the burden of reactive free radicals and protect the structural integrity of cells and tissues of the immune system, as well as other systems in the body. Certain cells of the immune system like polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN's) use free radicals as a weapon to destroy invading pathogens. These reactive molecules, when released into the surrounding area, mediate lipid peroxidation and tissue injury. There is growing evidence that PMN's are activated in vivo by complement or immune complexes in disorders such as ARDS. The respiratory host defense mechanisms of patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may be defective. The aim of this study was ta evaluate the status of the free radical scavengers and their activity in ARDS and to investigate the respiratory burst of ARDS patients. Methods: Seven ARDS patients (3 sepsis, 4 trauma) with an Fie 2 of 0.59+0.(36, a PEEP of 8.50\u00b10.99, and a Murray score of 2.83 \u00b10.18 were included in this study. 15 healthy adults served as controls. Superoxide anion production in granulocytes was measured photometrically, and the hydrogen peroxides by fluorimetric assay. Vitamin A, E, and g-carotene concentrations were assessed by HPLC, and plasma vitamin C photometrically. Plasma selenium was determined by dectrothermal AAS. Plasma lipid peroxidation pruducts, expressed as malondialdehyde (MDA), were determined by thiobarbituric acid assay and HPLC. Results: MDA-plasma (/xmol/l) 0.74~: 0.46* 0.37 \u00b1 0.16 *= <0.01, **=p<0.001 Condusion: ARDS patients showed significantly decreased plasma concentrations of vitamin C, E and g-carotene, as well as selenium. These nutritive ant\u00b1oxidants are consumed during increased oxidative stress. MDA, a final product of lipid peroxidation, is increased. However, a difference in rates of release of hydrogen peroxides and superoxide-anion of PMN could not be detected. Therefore, oxygen radical accumulation is more likely a result of excessive inspiratory oxygen concentrations (F.iO2), pro-oxidant drugs, and a high settlement of PMN in the lungs, and not an increased release of free radicals of the single PMN.",

Our results may suggested that there was some relation between this leakage of SP-A and the alveolar-capillary permeability because of the higher SP-A levels observed in the ARDS patients. However it is also likely that higher serum SP-A level represents the proliferation of alveolar type II cells as the regeneration of damaged lung. Further studies are now being done.

Grimminger et at., Mol. Pharmacol. 41:757, 1992) . We investigated the features of PAF-evoked LT synthesis in a model of pulmonary microvascular leukostasis, in the presence and absence of intravascular n-3-and n-6 -prescursor fatty acid supply. Human neutrophils were infused into isolated, ventilated and perfused rabbit lungs to achieve microvascular sequestration of ligand-responsive leukecytes. Leukotrienes (LT) and hydroxyeicosatetra(penta)enoic acids (HET(P)E) were quantified by ItPLC techniques. Intravascular application of PAF (5 uM) or arachidonic acid (AA;IOuM) provoked the generation of limited quantities of 4-series LTs and 5-HETE (total sum of 5-1ipoxygenade products rd. 7 and rd. 27 pmol/ml.; both in PMN-preloaded and non-preloaded lungs). Combined administration of PAt r and AA caused amplification of 5-1ipoxygenase product formation with predominance of cysteinyl-LT synthesis both in lungs without (total sum rd. 67 pmol/ml) and, much more strikingly, with pro-application of neutrophils (total sum rd. 308 pmoFml). Eicosapentaeooic acid (10 uM) elicited exclusive generation of 5-series LTs and 5-HEPE (total sum rd. 82 pmol/mi). Dual stimulation with PAF and EPA provoked amplification of EPA-derived 5-1ipoxygenase product formation, again with predominance of cysteinyl-LTs, in lungs without (total sum rd. 224 pmul/ml) and in particular in those with preceding microvascular PMN entrapment (total sum rd. 545 pmol/ml). We conclude that the PAF-evoked 5-1ipoxygenase product formation in the neutrophil-harbouring lung capillary bed is critically dependent on intravascular precursor fatty acid supply, with EPA representing the preferred substrate as compared to AA. PMN-related transcellular eicosanoid synthesis is suggested to underly the predominant generation of cysteinyl-LTs. These findings may be relevant for lipid mediator profiles provoked by infusion of n-3-versus n-6enriched lipid emulsions in diseases with PMN-related inflammators events. Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) involves damage to the alveolar epithelium and microvascular endothelium. Products released from neutrophils (PMN) are thought to be among the chief causes of this damage, while the role of mononuclear cells (MNC) is uncertain.",

            "text": "The liver is made up of several different cell types which subserve distinct functions in vivo. In addition to the different functions of the distinct cell types, it is now evident that even within the population of hepatocytes substantial functional heterogeneity exists. This heterogeneity occurs in a very organized fashion in the normal liver based upon the position of the hepatocyte in the acinus. Although it has been proposed that the acinar heterogeneity of hepatocytes arises from migration of immature hepatocytes from the periportal region to the perivenous region where they become senescent and die, many of the heterogeneous responses can be accutely reversed by reversal of the oxygen gradient via retrograde perfusion. Under normal conditions in which the acinus is exposed to unidirectional flow, the periportal hepatocytes are exposed to relatively high levels of oxygen, substrates and hormones. As these substances are extracted along the aeinus their concentration decreases leaving relatively low concentrations for the perivenous hepatocytes. In the normal liver, the heterogeneity of response is attenuated by extensive communication via gap junctions. The major liver gap junctions are made up of hexamers of connexin 32 (Cx32) which forms channels between cells capable of pas.~ing any molecule smaller than 1000 D. Coupling is sufficient to allow diffusion of molecules such as ATP or cAMP from one hepatocyte into > 20 adjacent hepatocytes within 60 seconds. During stress conditions such as endotoxemia or zymozan inflammation, expression of Cx32 is markedly decreased while the secondary gap junction protein Cx26 is either unchanged or even increased. While Cx 26 readily effects electrical coupling, molecules > 350 D pass only very slowly. This would result in restriciton of transmission of moecules the size of ATP or cAMP. Since inhibition of gap junctions also attentuates metabolic response to hormone or nerve stimulation, it is evident that modulation of hepatocyte hetereogeneity by gap junctions must be considered in determining the mechanisms of metabolic alterations during stress.

Jaundice, hypoglycemia, encephalopathy and bleeding secondary to low levels of liver-synthesizing clotting factors are, however, signs of rather severe end-stage hepatic failure. Furthermore, elevated liver enzymes (SGOT and SGPT) represent hepatucyte damage and not hepatocellular dysfunction. In view of this, a more sensitive indicator of hepatic function is desirable in order to detect early hepatic abnormality. In this respect, indocyanine green (ICG) is a tricarbocyanine dye that possesses several properties which makes it particularly valuable inthe assessment ofhepatic function. This dye is bound m albumin and is cleared exclusively by the liver through an energydependent membrane transport process and is nontoxic at lower doses. We propose that maximal velocity (Vm~,) of ICG clearance is a valuable measure of active hepatocellular function, since the total concentration of functioning receptors is directly proportional to Vm~. We have utilized a fiber optic catheter and an in vivo hemoreflectometar to continuously measure the administered ICG in vivo and consequently determine its clearance without the need of blood sampling. Using this technique, we have found that in the early stages of sepsis (i.e., 2 and 5 h following cecal ligation and puncture), the Vm~ and kinetic constant (K=) of ICG clearance was significantly depressed. It should be noted that at this stage of sepsis, there was no elevation in serum enzyme levels. Furthermore, hepatic blood flow and cardiac output increased at the above mentioned time points. Thus, the extremely early depression in active hepatocellular function in sepsis, despite the increased hepatic blood flow and cardiac output, may form the basis for cellular dysfunctions leading to multiple organ failure during sepsis. Additional studies indicated that following hemorrhage, active hepatocellular function was markedly depressed. This returned to prehemorrhage levels after Ringers lactate resuscitation, however, this function was not maintained and decreased significantly after fluid resuscitation. Nevertheless, the depressed active hepatocelinlar function following hemorrhage was markedly improved by post-treatment of animals with either ATP-MgCI2, peutoxifylline or diltiazem. Thus, the use of ICG clearance provides an early sensitive indicator of hepatic abnormality during sepsis and following hemorrhage and this method should be used, not only experimentally, but also in the clinical arena for the early detection of hepatocellular abnormality. Although multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity in intensive care units, very little is known about the mechanisms that precipitate its development. Since an episode of inadequate tissue oxygenation is considered to be the trigger for MODS, we have proposed that a primary localized injury such as ischemia/reperfusion may be sufficient to cause a change of gene expression of remote and apparently unaffected organs. Such modulation of remote organ gene expression may decrease the organ's tolerance to a subsequent stress contributing to the development of MOFS.",

The latter were not subjected to any surgical manipulation. These studies suggest that the gene expression of the kidneys is specifically modified after a remote organ injury (hepatic ischemia/reperfusion). We speculate that this change of gene expression in kidneys after an indirect injury may be part of the early events leading to the development of MODS. A priming event, e.g. local ischemia, in combination with a second insult, e.g. sepsis, may amplify a host's response and lead to multiple organ failure. To better understand the mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology, male Fischer rats were subjected to 20 min of hepatic ischemia followed by reperfusion (RP) and injection of 0.5 mg/kg Salmonella enteritidis endotoxin (ET) at 30 min of RP. ET injection potentiated the postischemic liver injury as indicated by histopathology and an increase of plasma ALT activities from 870+122 U/L (I/RP only) to 3900+470 U/L at 4h RP. Inhibition of Kupffer cells (KC) with gadolinium chloride (7 mg/kg) attenuated liver injury in this model by 70%, however, monoclonal antibodies (CL26, WT3) directed against adhesion molecules (132 integrins, CD18) on neutrophils had no effect on the injury despite the substantial accumulation of neutrophils in the liver at that time (467+52 PMNs/50 HPF; baseline: 13+3). Isolation of KC and neutrophils from the postischemic liver indicated a 10-fold increase of the spontaneous superoxide formation only in the KC fractions [3.85+0.68 nmol O2-/h/10%elts (KC2); 6.82_+0.92 (KCa) ] at 4h RP compared to control cells. In addition, stimulation with phorbol ester or opsonized zymosan revealed a substantial priming of KC for reactive oxygen formation. In contrast to the short-term experiments (4h), the antibody WT3 (4 mg/kg) attenuated liver injury by 90% at 24 h of RP and improved survival. Conclusion: Liver injury during the early RP phase is mediated mainly by KC generating excessive amounts of reactive oxygen while neutrophils are primarily responsible for organ damage during the later RP period.

            "text": "Here we describe a cell culture system, in which the direct toxicity of TNF towards mouse hepatocytes was examined. The toxicity of TNF, as determined by LDH-release or formazan-formation, was dose-and time-dependent. The threshold of toxicity was 10 ng/ml, which corresponds to serum concentrations found in mice after LPSinjection. Toxicity was only observed in hepatocytes sensitized with transcriptional inhibiters such as GalN, actinomycin D (ActD) or cxamanitin. Sensitization was neither observed with different translational inhibitors nor with various other metabolic inlaibitors or toxins. Inhibitors of protein synthesis or protein processing such as cycloheximide, puromycin, tunicamycin and ricin protected ActDsensitized hepatocytes from TNF-induced cytotoxicity. TNF induced apoptotic changes and DNA-fragmentation in sensitized hepatocytes which is in line with the above findings that cell death is dependent on protein synthesis. Thus TNF may be a trigger of programmed cell death during inflammatory organ damage. With the purpose of studying the role of complement activation in tissue injury after ischaemia and reperfusion we blocked the complement cascade in a model of rat liver isehaemia and reperfusion, either by administration of Soluble Human Complement Receptor Type 1 (sCRI), 25 mg/Kg IV after vascular occlusion (n=8) or by depleting the complement system using Cobra Venom Factor (CVF), 0.5 mg IM, 24 and 6 hours before ischaemia (n=10). Non-ischaemic rats (n=8) and ischaemic non-treated rats (n=15) were used as controls. The experimental procedure consists of the temporary interruption of arterial and portal blood flow to the left lateral and medial lobes of the liver during 45 minutes, followed by reperfusion, recording the liver blood flow and haemoglobin saturation with a Laser Doppler Flowmeter and Photometer during one hour after declamping; ALT levels were assayed and immunoperoxidase stainings for C3 and C9 were performed. There were statistically significant differences between the experimental ~roups and the untreated ischaemic control group in terms of post-isehaemic blood flow (p<0.001) and haemoglobin saturation (p<0.001). C3 and C9 were present in the endothelium of the ischaemic control group. No deposits of C3 or C9 were found in the CVF group. Few C3 and no C9 were found in sCRI treated rats. These results show that the effect of reperfusion injury in the rat liver is ameliorated either by depleting complement with CVF or by regulating complement activation with sCRI. Hepatic dysfunction, a major cause of mortality following hemorrhagic shock, has not yet been well characterized. The present study was designed to assess the effects of liver blood flow and cytokine levels on hepatic function following resuscitation from severe hemorrhagic shock in normal and cin-hotic rats. METHODS: Aftor pentobarbltal anesthesia, 23 control and 38 cirrhotic Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to severe hemorrhage to reduce their systolic blood pressure to 50 + 5 mm Hg. This level of hypotension was maintained until the skeletal muscle transmembrane potential (Era) depolarized by 25%.; the animals were then resuscitated with Ringer's Lactate solution in three times the volume of the shed blood. Serial blood samples for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) determination (a modified flow-cytomeUic WEHI cell bioassay) were obtained at baseline, during hemorrhage and following resuscitation. Liver blood flow measurements by low dose galactose clearance (GLC) and functional bepatocyte mass (FHM; defared as galactose elimination capacity [GEC] from the zero order portion of the plasma disappearance curve following an intravenous galactose bolus [500 mg/kg], divided by liver weight) were measured before shock and after resuscitation. RESULTS: Higher survival rates (p < .05) were observed in control as compared with cirrhotic rats. Shock produced a significant reduction in GEC (to < 0.01); FHM (19 < .01); and liver blood flow (p < 0.01) in normal and cirrhotic rats. Decreases in GEC and FI-IM were greater (p < 0.05) in cirrhotic rots. TNF levels were higher (p < 0.05) in cirrhotic rats at baseline and during induction of shock.",

            "text": "Pre Gap junctions provide pathways for metabolic signals between cells. In the liver, the majority of gap junctions are composed of connexin 32 (Cx32) polypeptide subunits, and are regulated by gluconeogenic hormones. Since sepsis and other inflammatory states alter hepatic glucoregulatory control, we have evaluated the contribution of gap junctional conductance to the metabolic dysregulation in the liver. An acute inflammation was induced in rats by injection with E. coli endotoxin (LPS lmg/kg). Northern blot/hybridization analysis of total RNA isolated from livers after endotoxin injection show a decrease in the steady state transcript levels of Cx32 to 18% of sham controls. Immunostaining of liver sections using anti-Cx32 revealed punctate fluorescent staining on the plasma membrane at regions of call-cell contact in saline injected animals, whereas, staining was only observed in cytoplasmic vesicles 6 hrs after animals were treated with LPS, suggesting the internalization of Cx32 without replacement on the cell surface. The staining was quantitated and expressed as % of pixels above threshold. At 6hr post injection 3.6% ofpixels exceeded threshold, compared to 16.2% in sham controls. Functional gap junctional communication was assessed by dye coupling using lucifer yellow in an isolated perfused liver under intravital fluorescence microscopy. Dye diffusion was markedly decreased 6hr after endotoxin injection. This suggests that decreased metabolic coupling after LPS injection results from decreased gap junction abundance. The present data suggest that metabolic dysregulation during sepsis may arise in part from changes in intercellular communication caused by a decrease in gap junctional expression and communication. Given the marked metabolic heterogeneity of hepatocytes with respect to acinar location, metabolic signaling via gap junctions most likely serves to moderate this heterogeneity, contributing to a coordinated metabolic response. Altered cellular Ca 2\u00f7 regulation might be a critical step in organ dysfunction during sepsis and ischemia/reperfusion events. The aim of the present study was to evaluate hepato-ceUular Ca 2\u00f7 regulation in isehemiah'eperfusion after hemorrhage and to assess effectiveness of TNFc~-monoclonal antibody (TNFo~-MoAB). Methods. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250g, n>_6/group; pentobarbital 50 mg/kg) with hemorrhage for 60 rain at 40 mm Hg.

Hepatecyte resuspension in radioisotope-free medium and farther incubation (exchangeable Ca 2+ (Ca2+ex) [nmol Ca2+/mg protein]; Ca 2+ membrane flux [nmol Ca2+/mg protein'min]). During incubation, aliquots (100 ~tl) were centrifuged through oil/lanthanum gradient and acivity measured by scintillation counting. Statistics: ANOVA. Mean + SEM. Results. Hepatocyte Ca2+ex and membrane Ca 2+ flux were significantly increased at both, the end of ischemia (14.3+.9; 0.41+.05) and reperfusion (16.4+.9; 0.50+.2), as compared to sham-operated animals (7.6+_.5; 0.09+.02)(19<.05 ). TNFc~-MoAB treatment significantly prevented reperfusion-induced increase of Ca2+ex (10+.8) and membrane Ca 2+ flux (0.17+.03)(p<.01). Fast Ca 2+ influx was significantly increased by epinephrine in hepatecytes from sham-operated rats (0.23+.03 vs. EPI: 0.52+.1, p< .05). This hormone effect was not observed in isehemia (0.47+.05, EPI: 0.6!-_.2) or reperfusion (untreated: 0.13+.06, EPI: 0.07+.01; TNFt~-MoAB: 0.26_+.04, EPI: 0.33+.07). Conclusion. The present study clearly demonstrated hepato-cellular Ca 2+ overload in ischemia and reperfusion as a result of hemorrhagic shock. Analysis of membrane Ca 2+ fluxes and hormone Ca 2+ mobilization suggests disturbances of membrane Ca 2+ transport mechanisms, e.g. through Ca2+-ATPases. Reperfusion-induced oxygen free radical generation which affect exchange kinetics of cellular Ca 2+ buffering compartments might also be operative. Prevention by TNFct-MoAB indicates the pivotal role of TNF as an early inflammatory mediator of hepatocellular alterations in signal transduetion mechanisms and cellular homeostasis. Although the precise mechanism has not yet been elucidated, bacterial translocation and endotoxin absorption have been frequently shown after burn, and have been postulated to be one of the underlying processes of sepsis. The purpose of the current study is to define the hemodynamic response of the liver to endotoxin release in burns, in correlation to bacterial translocation. Twelve female minipigs, weighing 20-28 Kg, underwent a laparotomy & transition time ultrasonic flow probes were positioned on the portal vein, the common hepatic artery, and the superior mesenteric artery. 6.5 Fr catheters were inserted in the superior mesenteric vein and the left hepatic vein. A jejunostomy was also performed. After five days all animals were anaesthetized and randomized to receive 40% of TBS A third degree burn. Eighteen hours after burn. 100 gg/Kg E. Coli LPS was intravenously administered over 30 rain. alI animals were studied for additional 24 hours and then sacrificed. Several recent data suggest that in severe injuries, such as shock state, the gradual activation of Kupffer cells and the excessive release of destructive and immunosuppresive products from macrophages may contribute to the development of \"multiple organ failure\". In in vivo experiments in mice, the effect of Kupffer cell phagocytosis blockade on the correlation between the tissue distribution of LPS, endotoxin sensitivity and LPS-induced TNF production was investigated. To depress the activity of the Kupffer cells, gadolinium chloride (GdC13) or carrageenan was used. Th~e studies indicate the dissociation of tissue localisation of Cr Jllabelled endotoxin and endotoxin lethalithy. Both GdC13 and carrageenan depressed Kupffer cell activity, but endotoxin sensitivity was enhanced only by carragenan treatment. However, there was a close correlation between the sensitivity to LPS and LPS-induced TNF production as measured in the serum, since LPSinduced TNF production was enhanced only by carrageenan treatment. On the other hand, GdC13 pretreatment significantly increased TNF production in the spleen. These results support our earlier findings that GdC13-indueed Kupffer cell phagocytosis blockade leads to activation of the spleen, and may explain some of the immunological effects of GdC13. Inositol(l, 4, 5) triphosphate (IP3) has been proposed as a second messenger for calcium mobilization. The addition of IP3 at low concentration has been shown to cause calcium release from intracellular microsomal store in rat hepatocytes. The effects of sepsis on the IP3 binding from microsomal fraction of rat hepatocytes during sepsis were investigated. Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation & puncture (CLP). Control rats were sham-operated. Three microsomal fractions (rough, intermediate and smooth) were isolated from rat liver. Study of IP3 receptor binding was performed with tridium label IP3. The results shewed that the IP3 binding was significantly depressed by 40-47% (p<0.05) during late sepsis (18 hrs after CLP), but not in early sepsis (9 hrs after CLP). The IP3 binding depression during late sepsis was most significant on rough and intermediate endoplasmic reticulum (p<0.05), but not on smooth subfraction. Since IP3 binding plays an important role in the regulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis in hepatocytes, an impairment in the calcium release due to depressed IP3 binding on smooth and intermediate endoplasmic reticulum during late sepsis may have a pathophysiological significance in contributing to the development of altered hepatic metabolism during septic shock.",

Cirrhotic patients were divided into Child's A, B and C categories using Child's classification. Complement levels (C3, C4) were measured and functional assay for complement (CH50) were performed in each of these groupings in addition to normal blood donor controls. These results show that the qualitative C3, C4 and the functional CHS0 complement assays have good predictive values in assessing deteriorating liver function\u2022 in particular, the functional assay for complement (CH50) showed marked impairment in Child's C patients (p<0.000001) confirming the impaired immunological status of these patients. Sera from this group of patients (Child's C) were titrated with pig red blood cells (RBCs) in a haemolytic assay. The results showed that there were significantly less haemolysis of pig RBCs in these patients (p=0.0177) as compared to the controls. This findings strongly support an impaired immunological status in Child's C liver cirrhosis and may explain the high incidence of sepsis as a terminal event in these patients. Aim:Kupffer cells(KC) have an importamt play to cause hepatocellular injury in sepsis, because these cells release many kinds of substances. We reported that oxygem radicals released by KCs stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) caused hepatocellular injury. Aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between imtracellmlar calcium(Ca) concentration of cultured rat KCs stimulated by LPS and release of oxygen radicals, and effect of prostaglandin E~ (PGE~) on imtracellular Ca concentration.

Under uncoupled conditions, mitochondria exposed to free radicals exhibited a significant decrease in 02 consumption supported by NAD+-Iinked substrates, but showed almost no change in 02 consumption in the presence of succinate and ascorbate. The activity of electron transfer complex I (NADH oxidase and NADH-cytochrome c oxidoreductase) and the energy-dependent reduction of NAD+ by succinate were unaltered by oxidative stress. Exposure to free radicals also had an uncoupling effect at all three coupling sites. The degree of mitochondrial swelling was closely correlated with the inhibition of state 3 oxidation of site I substrates and with the increase in state 4 oxidation of succinate. The immunosuppressive agent cyclosporin A (CyA) completely prevented the mitochondrial damage induced by oxygen free radicals (swelling, Ca2+ release, sucrose trapping, uncoupling, and selective inhibition of the mitochondrial respiration of site I substrates). The same protective effect was found when Ca2+ cycling was prevented, either by chelating Ca 2+ with EGTA or by inhibiting Ca2+ re-uptake with ruthenium red. These findings suggest that the deleterious effect of free radicals on mitochondria in the present experimental system was triggered by the CyA-sensitive and Ca2\u00f7-dependent membrane transition, and not by direct impairment of the mitochondrial inner membrane enzymes.",

The conditions of GSH-depletion and -richness were produced by intraperitoneal administration of buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a specific inhibitor of GSH synthetase, and of GSH-monoethyl ester (GSH-ME), respectively. GSH-ME, which was esterified the caboxyl group of the glycine residue, is readily transported into cells and is hydrolyzed intracellularly; this leads to greatly increased the cytosolic and mitochondrial levels of GSH. BSO and GSH-ME were administered intraperitoneally 3 mmol/kg and 10 mmollkg, respectively, and LPS (2 mg/kg) given 1 h later. Hepatocytes were isolated by in situ perfusion of the liver with collagenase 6 h after LPS injection. The degree of hydrogen peroxide (H202) synthesis and mitochondrial membrane potential were measured by flow cytometry using fluorescence probe dichrolofluorescein diacetate and tetrametyl rhodamine ethyl ester, respectively. The degree of mitochondria membrane permeability transition (MMP) was assessed by [014]sucrose entrapment. We found that LPS treatment results in a decrease in hepatic GSH level and mitochondrial membrane potential, and an increase in H202 synthesis and MMP. LPS administration to BSQ-pretreated mouse worsened at[ these parameters. In contrast, GSH-ME pretreatment ameliorates. All together, GSH may acts an important role in cellular defence against LPS-mediated liver damage, and MMP may result in the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. It has been shown, up to now, that disturbances of enzymatic processes in the cell organella are the basic factor of the changes taking place during endotoxin shock It has been observed that lysosomes are biochemically changed as result of the effect of lipopotysacharides of gram negative endotoxic bacteria. The purpose of the experiment was: 1.evaluation nfthe course of the EES due to the biochemic changes 2.determination of the influence of the EES on the activity of lysosomal enzymes in liver cell 3.deterrmnatian of the influence of H and D on the activity of some lysosomal enzymes in liver cell during EES Material and method: Examinations ware carried out on 30 dogs. The shock was evoked by i.v. administration of endotoxin E.coli. The dogs were divided into 5 groups: Icontrols, I[ -dogs with untreated shock, III-dogs in shock treated with H, IVdogs in shock treated with D, V -dogs in shock treated with H and D. The following parameters were determined: 1.Activity of acid phosphatase in the venous blood serum. 2-6.Total and free activity of acid phosphatase and catepsins in the full liver cell homogenate, in mitochondrial-and-lysosomal fraction, and in the superuatunt (all after 4 hours of the experiment). Conclusions 1. Essential increase of activity of lysosomal enzymes was observed in the EES. 2. Increased activity of lysosomal hydrolases in the liver cell homogenate corresponds, as a result of the endotoxin effect, with increased enzymatic activity in the peripherial blood. Extensive investigations from our laboratory of the pathophysiology of hepatic no-flow ischemia (45 min) -reperfusion injury demonstrated substantial Kupffer cell activation with reactive oxygen formation during the first few hours of reperfusion as indicated by increases in plasma glutathione disulfide (GSSG) levels in vivo (Am. J. Physiol. 260: G355, 1991) and enhanced superoxide formation by Kupffer cells (KC) isolated from the postischemic livers (Free Radic. Res. Commun. 15:277, 1991) . The early KC-induced injury initiated the later, primarily neutrophilmediated reperfusion injury (FASEB J. 4: 3355, 1990 ). To test whether or not similar mechanisms are operative during hepatic ischemia induced by hemorrhagic shock, male Fischer rats (230-250 g) were subjected to 60 rain of hemorrhage (mean arterial pressure 40 mm Hg) followed by resuscitation (RS) (reinfusion of shed blood). Hepatic ATP levels declined from 2.3+0.2 txmol/g to 0.24_+0.08 (60 min shock) indicating severe ischemia, and recovered to 1.04--0.2 at 90 min RS. To test for potential oxidant stress during RS, plasma GSSG conc. were measured. Although GSSG levels increased by 120% compared to baseline levels (0.69!-_0.31 I.tM), there was no significant difference to shamoperated controls. Spontaneous superoxide formation of isolated KC was 0.32+0.05 nmol O2-/min/10ecells (KC2) and 0.51+0.11 (KC3) in controls and did not change significantly after shock and 90 rain RS. Addition of phorbol ester or opsonized zymosan to isolated KC did not indicate a priming of these cells. Conclusion: In striking contrast to our previous findings with hepatic no-flow ischemia, there is no evidence for a significant KC activation after 60 min of hemorrhagic shock and up to 90 rain of resuscitation.

Eleven nuclear and cytoplasmic parameters were measured and statistically significant results are summarised in the RESULTS: Ascorbic acid levels were slightly elevated after the HS and returned to basal values after 120 rain. Glutathione concentrations were increased significantly after the HS and the GSH levels kept rising continuously to as much as 4-fold of basal levels at the end of 120 min. MDA showed no significant variation before and after the hemorrhagic shock. Plasma concentrations of ratine, teucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, proline, threonine and serine showed significant increase over basal levels during the whole ischemic period. Glutamic acid was slightly elevated at the onset of HS and remained the same for the rest of ischemic period. Hydroxyproline was significantly below the basal value at the mid-point of ischemic period. Alanine, glycine, histidine and aspartate did not change significantly throughout experimental time course. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Oxidative stress might not be severe in the systemic hemorrhagic shock for pigs since no significant variations were observed for ascorbic acid and MDA (2) the increase of GSH might be that it was released from hepatocytes when the animal was under systemic ischemia.

            "text": "\" The project supported by NSFC. In the past few years it has become evident that cytokines are implicated in various pathophysiological mechanisms. Therefore measurement of cytokines and their potential inhibitors in biological fluids may be helpful in diagnosing and monitoring of diseases. However, dependent on the type of assay used investigations performed in different laboratories have often yielded conflicting results. In order to assess reliability and reproducibility of cytokine measurements two comparative studies for the determination of cytokines in biological fluids were launched by several investigators interested in this field: one national Austrian ~tudy and one European study in the context of the European Workshop for Rheumatnlogy Research. Serum and synovial fluid samples were distributed by the organisers, and participants had to measure one or several of the following cytokines in all samples: IL-1, IL-2, 1L-6, I58, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, and the soluble receptors for IL-2 and TNF; both commercially available immunoassays and home-made assays were allowed. So far, the main conclusions emerging from these preliminary studies are: (1) the same immurzoassay (ELISA) yielded comparable results in different laboratories; (2) immunoassays from different manufactureres usually measured the highest concentrations in the same samples, yielded similar relative values but disparate absolute values; (3) assays for soluble receptors yielded less discrepant results; (4) some assays seem to be more suitable for measuring cytokines in biological fluids than others. The mean retrieval of exogenous recombinant human cytokines was approximately 50% for most cytokines tested. However, it must be borne in mind that natural and recombinant cytokines may behave differently in immunoassays. This raises the question as to the necessity of setting up international standards for all cytokines. Possible interferences by serum components such as (lipo)proteins, complement, rheumatoid factors, etc., which may either decrease assay sensitivity or yield false positive results, must also be considered. In addition, natural cytokine binding proteins (e.g. soluble receptors) might interfere with cytokine determination in immunoassays. The problem of immunoassays versus bioassays has not yet been approached, but is without any doubt worth indepth investigation. Thus, these studies are a promising first approach to deal with the difficulties of cytokine analysis in biological samples, and it is hoped that they will help to overcome some of the major methodological problems in the near future. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a pleiotropic cytokine which plays a key role in a number of immunologically mediated disorders like septicemia or cachexia. TNF receptors are found on the surface of a variety of cells, where they provide molecular signals for the cytokine effect. There exist two types of soluble TNF receptors (sTNF-Rs), TNF-R p55 and TNF-R p75. These sTNF-Rs can compete with the cell surface receptors and block their activity. The expression on and shedding from the cell surface of sTNF-Rs is enhanced by interferon gamma.",

            "text": "The final value of sTNF-Rs within the complex network of cytokines is not yet clear. However, there exist striking parallels between infectious and malignant disorders pointing to a key role of endogenous immune activation. Biochemicatly, D-erythro-neopterin derives from guanosine triphosphate. In vitro studies show that large amounts of neopterin are produced by human monocytes/macrophages stimulated with interferon-j (IFN-J). Neopterin is biologically stable, and its halflife in the blood seems to solely depend on renal excretion. Specimen for neopterin determination can be stored without special precautions. Increased concentrations of neopterin have been described in body fluids of patients suffering from diseases which are apparently associated with an activated cellular immune response and with enhanced endogenous formation of IFN-~', e.g,, 1 ) increasing neopterin levels predict rejection episodes in allograft recipients 2) virus infections induce increased neopterin concentrations, and the degree of neopterin elevation predicts prognosis in these patients which is particularly true in HIV-1 infection 3) in autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis neopterin levels reflect activity of the disease 4) increased neopterin concentrations in patients suffering from certain types of cancer indicate poor prognosis. Significant associations between changes of neopterin and decrease of hemoglobin as well as the development of weight loss and cachexia, e.g., in cancer patients and in patients with HIV-1 infection, support the concept that endogenously formed cytokines such as IFN-~\" and tumor necrosis factor-~( are involved in the pathogenesis of such symptoms. In conclusion, neopterin monitoring is a sensitive tool to detect the activation status of the cell-mediated immune system in vivo. Repair and healing or perpetuation of acute inflammation is characterized by a complex network of interacting cellular and humoral defence mechanisms. Of the numerous inflammatory mediators/effectors investigated hitherto, the proteolydc lysosomal enzyme PMN elastase has turned out to be highly destructive when released extracellularly thus contributing considm:ably to organ dysfunctions in severe posttraumatic and postoperative courses.",

The challenge is to detect and characterize these changes in geae expression and relate them to the injury. The development of cloning techniques has emerged as the methodology of choice. Changes in gene expression are usually characterized by variations in the concentration of cellular messages because synthesis of the final product \"the polypoptide\" is usually proportional to the concentration of mRNA. Due to the rapid regulation of gene expression the cellular concentration of messages changes very quickly. This is commonly referred to as steady-state levels, a balance between transcription and degradation. Steady-state levels of mRNA can be detected in a single cell (in situ hybridization) or in total RNA isolated from cells or organs and separated in agarose gels (Northern blots). Although analysis of mRNA steady-state levels are very useful, they do not provide information about the mechanisms that regulate gene expression. Changes in gene expression primarily occur at the level of transcription; characterization of the RNA species being synthesized at a given time is performed by the nuclear run-off technique. When there is no a priori information about the gene that may be regulated after a particular situation such as sepsis, the total pool of messages present in cells at given time can be characterized by a combination of in vitro translation of the cellular messages and fractionation of the in vitro translated products by two dimensional gel electrophoresis. Such approach permits the visualization of the general pattern of gene expression, a \"finger print\", of the physiologic state. In summary, researchers now have access to a great variety of techniques to identify and characterize genes expressed in response to a physiological condition that may be utilized as \"molecular tools\" to study the organism's responses to shock and sepsis. The acute phase proteins are a set of plasma proteins with greatly increased plasma concentrations during acute inflammations and after tissue trauma, e.g. after major surgery. The proteins counteract the source of injury, facilitate clearance of infectious particles by phagocytes, assist immune responses and initiate wound healing. The corresponding genes are expressed in liver hepatocytes and regulated by the inflammatory mediators interleukin 1 and interleukin 6 (ILl, IL6). Class1 acute phase genes are mainly controlled by ILl and by combinations of ILl plus IL6; class2 genes mainly by ii,6. The human C-reactive protein(CRP), serum amyloid A(SAA) and complement C3 genes will be discussed as examples of class1 genes, and rat c~2 macroglobulin as a prototypical class2 gene. Both classes of genes use different types of \u00a2ytokine response elements in their promoter-proximal transcription control regions; class1 genes use the transcription factor NF-IL6 or C/EBP as the key factor to mediate cytokine responsiveness; class2 genes use a different, so far unidentified factor to achieve responsiveness to IL6. Ongoing efforts to purify this factor, called the IL6-Response Factor (IL6-RF), from rat liver nuclear protein extracts will be described. The IL6-RF apparently mediates the effects of IL6 in a broad range of cell types, including B lymphocytes and other hematopoietic cells. It is therefore likely to be of equal general importance for gene regulation by IL6 as NF-IL6.",

Alternatively, normal promoter sequences can be hooked to a gene whose expression is lethal to the cell (e.g., diptheria toxin A chain) to ablate all cells expressing that gene. Another approach uses an intact gene with its normal regulatory sequences. Here, an elevated level of the gene product is delivered from the correct cells in the correct tissues at the correct developmental stages or in response to natural signals.

Will they be helpful in the study and esro of patients? Our speakers in this session will review thcsa proposals and the evidence as we strlVO for eoasensns. It has been well demonstrated that the administration of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and especially tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can result in a picture similar to septic shock with secondary multiple organ failure. It is also clear that tissue hypoxia can lead to organ damage. We believe that it is the interaction between the two phenomenons that can lead to MOF. On the one hand, the inflammatory response is amplified in the presence of hypoxia. On the other hand, the release of the mediators of sepsis can increase tbe oxygen demand ef the tissues, alter their oxygen extraction and decrease myocardial contractility, and the combination of these elements accounts for the development of septic shock. This hypothesis is supported by two lines of evidence. First, MOF is usually preceded by an episode of acute circulatory failure (even though frank circulatory shock may not be evident). Second, recent experimental and clinical studies indicated that immunotherapy (especially antibodies to TNF) is particularly effective in the most severe forms of sepsis, associated with circulatory shock. Hence, an effective way to prevent MOF may be a combination of aggressive cardiovascular management and immunotherapy. Development of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in the critically ill follows an heterogeneous group of stimuli including infection, sterile inflammmion, extensive tissue injury, ischemia, intoxication with a variety of substances, and immune system activation. Whether the resulting physiologic abnormalities reflect a common pathologic process, or are simply a non-specific manifestation of tissue injury is unknown. Moreover, the lack of clearly-defined functional criteria for the characterization of the syndrome on the one hand, and of reliable biochemical markers of its evolution on the other, has made attempts to define its epidemiology and natural history difficult.",

Acute lung injury (ALI) and its most severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) characterized by severe hypoxemia, diffuse infiltration of both lungs, a reduction of compliance and a wedgepresure lower than 18 mm Hare related to direct or indirect injury. When ALIresults from direct injury (toxic agents, lung contusion, pneumonia), the lesions of epithelial barrier and the activation of lung macrophages are the first events leading to the release of inflammatory mediators wh:ch are responsible for alteration of the membranar permeability and for invasion of the alveoli by fluids, proteins and cells. An inflammatory reaction develops, with injury to endothelial cells, adhesion of polymorpbonuclear leucocytes (PMN) and the release in blood stream of intlammatory mediators dispersing the inflammatory reaction to other organs and tissues. The failure of lung function also results into hypoxia in other organs, leading to tissular ischemia, triggering an inflammatory reaction leading to organ dysfunction. Frequent complications of direct lung injury are septic pneumonia with endotoxin release, phagocytes activation and cytokine production disseminating inflammation. By this way, direct lung injury can be at the origin of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), the frequence of which having been estimated to 40% and is increased when ALl has occured in patients alreadypresenting an organ dysfunction (immunodepresslon, cancer...). When ALI results from redirect or extrathoraclc injury (trauma, infections, hypovolemic shock, acute pancreatitis...), inflammatory mediators and micro-aggregates released in particular organs or tissues reach the lung via the blood and lymph streams, are filtered in the organ or trapped in the lung capillaries, and are responsible for a local inflammatory reactaon (endothelial cell activation, PMN trapping and adhesion, platelet aggregation, release of mediators). Sepsis acts by the way of endotoxiu and sequential eytokines release (TNF, ILl,...) while trauma with important blood loss acts especially by the way of hypoperfusionreperfusion phenomena leading to a disseminatedinflammatory reaction and to a possible bacterial transloeation when intestinal hypopeffnsion is present. In these conditions of indirect injury, ALl (or ARDS) is a Iocal early (often the first) manifestation of a general phenomenon of altered membrane permeability and inflammatory reaction, easily and rapidly recognized by its clin~cai signs. The iung is one of the numerous organs participating to the MODS, In these conditions, the mortality rate is high, reaching more than 80% when sepsis is present or when at least 3 organs are implicated in MODS. By direct or redirect injury, lung is so a target organ for MODS and injured lung can be the cause of MODS or simply a participant to this syndrome.",

The blood-brain-barrier of cerebral blood vessels can be opened by stroke, cerebral trauma, inflammation, convulsions, acute hypertension and changes in the blood osmolarity. The consequence is brain oedema, increase of lOP and decrease of the perfusion pressure. A close correlation between intraventricular pressure and the fate of patients with severe brain injuries has been established. Regional CBF values of 16 to 18 ml/100g/min are reflected in isoelectric EEG, and values about t5ml/100g/min, result in loss of somatosensory evoked potentials. For ionic pump failure the threshold has been determined by values of about 10 ml/100g/min and is reflected in massive release of intracellular potassium. In stroke and in brain trauma when the oedematogenous condition is initially localized the tissue pressure variance within and between the hemispheres lead to tentorial and falciform herniations are the common cause of death even before the critical threshold of intracranial pressure is reached. The increase of the ICP over the level of the perfusion pressure leads to the arrest of the CBF. If this persists {or periods exceeding 6 seconds of global brain ischemia loss of conciousness and developing seizures appear. If it exceeds 10 min irreversible injuries of the brain appear. Following cerebral ischemia and after severe head injury a tendency to increased coagulation can be detected.

The formation of microthrombi is triggered by the plateletactivating factor a mediator in central nervous injury also responsible for aggravation of posttraumatic brain edema.

Babcock * Major accidental, burn and operative injury often precipitates a profound multicentric immunologic depression that is believed to predispose patients to become anergic and thus to develop towards a higb probability of infection. Anergy or a lack of immunologic reactiVity stands for a total elimination of skin test reactivity and recall antigen responses in the inununocompromised patient. Anergy following overwhelming trauma or major septic conditions results from a massive impairment of cell mediated immunity (CMI) together with a whole body malignant inflammationiike state. We and others have demonstrated clearly that the skeration of CMI following trauma is mainly due to the disruption of intact monocyte (MOO) / T-cell interaction. Within this phenomenon we see a shift of the cell ratio in the compartment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with a considerable increase of prostaglandin E 2 synthesizing M~ and a simultaneous decrease of functionally competent CD3+ and CD4+ lymphocytes. T-cell dysfunction in states of profound stress is characterized by impaired synthesis of two crucial lymphokines -Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and gamma-Interferon (y-IFN). The inability to produce adequate amounts of IL-2, most likely attributable to alterations in the transmission of signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus, results in incomplete proliferative T-cell responses to antigenic stimuli, while a lack of ?-IFN results in inadequate M~ antigen processing and presentation. The role of the two functionally distinct T-helper subsets, T-helper-1 (Thl) secreting principally IL-2 and ?-IFN and T-helper-2 (Th2) acting principally in inducing antibody formation with a secretion of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and TNF-[3 has still to be established within the context of major trauma. Antibody formation to common protein antigens is impaired, the predominant finding is a shift from IgM to IgG synthesis. Although excessive secretion of prninflammatory cytokines (IL-U3, TNF-c~, IL-6, IL-8) has been considered to be deleterious for the host in states of major inflammation and infection, in-vitro and whole blood investigation of Me function has clearly revealed that there is initially a marked suppression of MOO from septic patients to synthesize and secrete proinflammatory cytokines to endotoxin. This probably will result in immunodeficiency of traumatized as well as septic patients, since these cytokines in low concentrations are involved in the upregulation of the essential humoral and cellular immune functions. Abnormalities of PMN function noted after serious injury have been interpreted by some investigators as signs of unresponsiveness of this cell population, others have demonstrated signs of PMN byperactivation. Latest findings revealed that there is a clear PMN dysfunction in circulating blood: 70% of all PMN's in this compartment show downregulated or non existent ~-integrins within 72 hours posttrauma -these cells do not phagocytose, have a reduced respiratory burst and appear to be completely degranulated. Restoration of these cell functions within 7 days post-trauma is significantly correlated to survival of traumatized patients. Other reports however stress increased expression of CR3+ receptors (CDll/CD18 complex) on circulating PMN's, increasing the ability of these cells to adhere to intercellular adhesion molecules, thus contributing to play a major role in inducing the pulmonary capillary leakage. Our knowledge about the perturbation of host defenses associated with serious injury and sepsis is continuously increasing and represents the precondition for the design of effective therapeutic measures to prevent and counteract the resistance to invading microorganisms.",

            "text": "LG Thijs~ CE N~ck Sepsis is the most common cause of acute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and coagulation disorders as well as abnormalities of fibrinolysis are common in septic patients. Some clinical and experimental studies indicate that DIC is a pathogenetic factor for the development of multiple organ failure. Endotoxin and various mediators (TNF, IL-I) enhance tissue factor and decrease expression of thrombomodulin on endothelial cells in vitro. Also, tPA activity is suppressed and release of PAI-I is stimulated. In such a way the endothelial surface becomes procoagulant whereas fibrinolysis is inhibited. Following administration of endotoxin to normal volunteers levels of prothrombin fragments (FI+2) and thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes increase, indicating thrombin generation. Also the fibrinolytic system is activated as evidenced by a rise of levels of tPA and plasmin-antiplasmin (PAP) complexes but this is counteracted by a subsequent release of PAI-I. In severely ill septic patients levels of TAT complexes are increased and concentrations of the natural inhibitors of coagulation (AT III, protein C) are usually decreased. Also, tPA levels snd PAP complexes as well as concentrations of PAI-I are elevated. The severity of many of these alterations is related to mortality. Thus, both coagulation and fibrinolysis are activated in sepsis, but not in a balanced way, thereby promoting coagulation. One of the hallmsxk pathological alterations associated with sepsis is the development of microvascular thrombosis, an entity ~lmre~erizod by microvas~tlar plugBing with leukoeyies (predominately nentrophils) and fibrin deposits.",

There are three types of immune ceils that must exit the blood stream into the extravascular space: lymphocytes ; polymorphonuclear leukocytes; and non-lymphocyta mononuclaar cells (monooytes, basophlls, aoslncphils). B lymphocytes exit the blood stream and recircu}ate mostly via the high endothelial venule (HEV) in lymphatic tissue, Rarely, in chronic }nfectlon=, they may recirQulate vie HEV in non-lymphoi:t tissue. T-lymphocyte recircutation on the other hand can occur via HEV in lymphoid tissue, as well as, the endothalium of the skin, returning to peripheral lymph nodes via the lymphatic channels. Lymphocyte recirculation is the mechanism which allows \u00a2ontaot between the immune repertoire and pathogens, and homing delivers these cells to the appropriate environment for activation and for effeotor function, PMNs exit the blood stream through endotbelium in close proximity to the site of inflammation after appropriate endothelial membrane receptor expression. They must reach the site of pathogen tnveslon quickly in order to be effective. Their exudation to the inflammatory site can be modulated by their intravascular pdmlng, which results from appropriate receptor expression. Because endotoxin leak from the gut has been postulated as an important trigger mechanism for the systemic inflammatory response syndrome seen after serious injury, the immunologic and metabolic effects of bacterial endotoxin infusion into normal volunteers can be expected to shed considerable light on the validity of this hypothesis. We and ethers have used tbis model to show that endotoxin causes a temporary paralysis in the ability of circulating monocytes to prudce the proinflammatory cytokines Interleukin-i (IL-I) and TNF-a. Endotoxin, however, causes increased production of PGE2 by the same cell population. Endotoxin infusion causes significant suppression of circulating T-cell numbers and a profound suppression in the ability of the circulating T-cell population to proliferate and to produce Interle~in-2 (IL-2) upon in vitro stimulation. After endotoxin circulating T-cells are also more sensitive to the inhibitory action of exogenous PGE2. Administration of cyclooxygenase inhibitors at the time of endotoxin infusion largely abrogates the effect of endetexin on T-Cell proliferation and IL-2 production. Endotoxin infusion also causes the release of increased levels of circulating catabolic hormones including cortisol. Administration of cortisol alone or cortisol along with endetowin to volunteers has allowed dissection of cortisol effects from those of endotoxin itself. Cortisol infusion alone causes a diminution in the circulating T-cell population but the remaining ceils continue to produce IL-2 after appropriate stimulation. Cortisol infused along with endotoxin blocks the overshoot in monocyte proinflammatory cytokine production seen 24 -48 hours after endetoxin infusion. At present, one may conclude that administration of sublethal doses of bacterial endetoxin to human volusteers produces alterations in cytokime production and Tlymphocyte activation which are both similar and dissimilar to those seen following serious injury. Hemodynamic support is based first on intravenous fluids and second on vasoactive agents. Colloids are usually preferred to crystalloids, for their more rapid hemodynamic effects and their lesser passage in the interstitial space. In the presence of hypotension, the pharmacological profile of dopamine makes it the first agent of choice. It is only when high doses of dopamine are insufficient to restore a sufficient tissue perfusion pressure that norepinephrine should be added. Even when cardiac output is not decreased, a dobutamine infusion is often indicated to counteract the myocardial depression, prevent vasoconstriction, and increase oxygen delivery to the tissues. The benefit derived from the administration of \"renal\" doses of dopamine is doubtful, but stimulation of dopaminergic receptors may increase blood flow also to the gut. In any case, none of these catecholamines has been shown to significantly improve the oxygen extraction capabilities of the tissues. Agents with antiinflammatory properties but also with some vasodilating properties, such as N-acetylcysteine, prostaglandin El or pentoxifylline represent more attractive options to increase oxygen extraction. Cardiovascular support should aim not only at the restoration of a sufficient arterial pressure but also at the maintenance of an optimal oxygen delivery to the cells. It should thus be guided also by measurements of cardiac output, mixed venous oxygen saturation and oxygen extraction, and indexes of cellular hypoxia, such as blood lactate levels, gastric intramucosal pH or vanearterial PC02 gradients.

Falke Klinik for Anaesthesiologie und operative Intensivmedizin, UKRV, Freie Universit \u00a7t Berlin, Germany Important contributory factors to the high mortality of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome lARDS) are the aggressive therapies required, such as mechanical ventilation with high inspiratory oxygen concentrations and airway pressures. As specific therapies for reducing or preventing the general inflammatory reaction of the lung resulting in severe hypoxemia is unknown, today's therapy is limited to procedures which predominantly support or maintain pulmonary function, i.e. pressure limited ventilation with PEEP and permissive hypercapnea, avoiding or treatment of fluid overloading, and positional maneuvers. Extracorporeal lung assist combined with low frequency positive pressure ventilation has been recommended, when conventional therapy fails. Today, extracorporeal gas exchange may be carried out using a system internally coated with covalently bound heparin. This allows for a lower level of systemic heparinzation reducing the risk of severe hemorrhagic complications of extracorporeal respiratory support. From April 1989 to August 1993 89 patients, aged from 15 months to 60 years, were transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU) for treatment of severe ARDS. All fulfilled at least the slow entry criteria of the U.S. National ECMO Study. Due to hypoxemia 13 patients required veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) immediately after transfer to our ICU. The other 76 patients were first treated with pressure controlled mechanical ventilation, permissive hypercapnea, prone position, and dehydration, if necessary. In 23 out of these 76 patients, in which the gas exchange did not improve in the following days, veno-venous ECMO with heparin-coated systems was additionally performed. Heparin was given to achieve a partial thrombin time between 40 -55 s and an activated clotting time between 120 -150 s. If surgery was performed during ECMO, heparin infusion was interrupted. No severe bleeding complications related to anticoagulation for the extracorporeal bypass could be observed, however, in some patients, after three weeks of ECMO thrombi in the drainage cannula were observed. A problem of of membrane leakage shortened the life span of the membrane lungs to a mean of about four 4 days. In the conventionally treated group 87% survived and in the additionally with ECMO treated group 58% survived, representing a 75% survival rate in patients whose risk of death is considered more than 50%. On the basis of these experiences, we conclude that the described strategy, including veno-venous ECMO with heparin-coeted systems, may improve the survival in patients suffering from severe ARDS.",

            "text": "Abnormally high skeletal muscle pO 2 in septic patients and its normalization during recovery: Evidence against tissue hypoxia but for impaired oxygen metabolism of skeletal muscle? P. Boekstegers, K. Werdan Department of Medicine I, Gro6hadern University Hospital, Munich, Germany A pathological oxygen uptake supply dependence was suggested to indicate tissue hypoxia in sepsis-a hypothesis which is discussed controversially. Because the detection of reduced oxygen transport to tissue and &tissue hypoxia would have important implications for therapy, skeletal muscle oxygenation was studied in patients with sepsis. Intermittent and continuous determination of skeletal muscle pO 2 by polarographic needle or catheter probes provided no evidence for skeletal muscle hypoxia even in severe stage of sepsis (Boekstegers et al., Crit Care Med 1994) . In contrast, mean skeletal muscle pO 2 was found to be abnormally high in patients with sepsis (48 _+ 10,4 mmHg, n=39) compared to patients with limited infection (28, 4 + 4, 7 mmHg, p<0.001, n=16) , to patients with cardiogenic shock (22,3 + 6,2 mmHg, p<0.001, n=lS) and to healthy subjects (33,3 _+ 8,1 mmHg, p<0.001, n=10). Furthermore, serial measurements in patients with sepsis showed that skeletal muscle pO 2 was higher (44,1 _+ 10,3 mmHg) on days with severe sepsis than on days with intermediate state (30,1 _+ 8 mmHg) and than on days without sepsis (26, 8 _+ 5, I mmHg) . Thus, a decrease of abnormally high skeletal muscle pO 2 was related to improvement of sepsis. This was also demonstrated by comparing the decrease of abnormally high skeletal muscle pO 2 with the decrease of APACHE II score or Elebute score as well as Interleukin-6 serum levels in a separate study (Boekstegers et el., Shock, in press). In summary, our data provide no evidence for skeletal muscle hypoxia in patients with sepsis but support the assumption &impaired oxygen metabolism in severe sepsis. NeutropNlic emigration from the vascular space into the extracellular matrix is important for the response to tissue injury or contamination by providing a large recruitable pool of tissue-based phagocytes. The consequences of neutrophil exposure to intravaseular chemoattractants, likely relevant for IL-8 and C5a in sepsis, trauma, and in burn injury, are suppression of neutrophil attachment to endothelial cells and matrix proteins. It is probable that proteoglycan-bound attractants are of considerable biologic relevance, and may result in enhancement of responses to subsequently encountered cytokines. In the presence of connective tissue proteins expressing integrin-specific binding ligands, neutrophils respond to TNF-cq GM-CSF and other cytokines by producing large amounts of hydrogen peroxide. This response is likely important in the digestion of contaminated or injured tissue by facilitating activity of neutrnphil granular proteases and inactivating plasma anti-proteases. This matrix-dependent oxidative response is important in defining potential novel targets for therapeutic intervention. The response appears to involve signalling by integrin-linked tyrosine kinases. The net effect of matrix protein injury through this mechanism is enhancement of the fibrotic response which underlies much of the prolonged ventilator dependence of patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome. This adherence dependent response has also been implicated in direct hepatocyte injury, and may represent an early component of the syndrome of multisystem organ failure. Study purpose: In this patient (pat.) population with a considerable sepsis morbidity and mortality, parameters proposed for sepsis assessment (Elebute sepsis score [Ele], SIRS) were investigated with regard to their use in the early classification of pop. pat. at risk for developing sepsis. Patients and Methods: In a previous observational study on 110 consecutive pat. after elective open-heart surgery, we had determined Ele daily for at least 3 pop. days (in pat. with a longer stay: until ICU discharge). After publication of the newly proposed SIRS definition, these criteria were retrospectively calculated and compared to Ele. Results: On the total of n =515 patient-days, both Ele and SIRS showed significant (p<0.0001) correlations with parameters reflecting the general and sepsis-related severity of the pop. clinical course. Compared to SIRS, the Ele correlations were better (ICU mortality: 0.59 vs. 0.32; ICU treatment days: 0,51 vs. 0.32; days on mechanical ventilation: 0,54 vs. 0.32; days with vasopressor requirement: 0.59 vs. 0.33; number of microbiological findings: 0.44 vs. 0.29), The optimal classification criteria for the mainly sepsis-related outcome gave maximal Youden indices of 0.87 for Ele (Ele >_12 on >_2 days, accuracy: 94%) compared to 0.42 for SIRS (SIRS present on >3 days, accuracy: 67%). Accordingly, Ele ROC curve areas for both overall (0.92) as well as sepsis-related prognostic evaluation (0.99) were significantly (p<0,05) larger compared to SIRS (0.79 and 0.86, resp.), This higher overall accuracy of the Ele criterion was primary due to a more valid assessment already on the first and second pop. day, where SIRS still had a high false positive classification rate (46% and 53%, compared to 7% and 1%, resp.). Conclusion: In the early postoperative course after cardiac surgery, the SIRS definition displayed a high false-positive classification rate (low specificity) for subsequent sepsis-related mortality compared to better classification results obtained by the Elebute sepsis score.",

Physiological risk was assessed by the APACHE III score 1, while one component of immunologic function was evaluated by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) eytokine production after in vitro LPS stimulation 2. Four of the nine patients died. APACHE III scores at 72 h were lower in survivors (S) than in non-survivors (NS), (51-+13 vs 111-+1 5 p<0.05), while APACHE III scores at admission were not significant different between S and NS (82-+13 vs 95-+13). Down regulation of cytokine production by PBMC upon LPS stimulation was a transient event in S. While S demonstrated an 3 fold increase of TNF-a bioactivity with[r~ 72 hours, NS did not demonstrate any increase at all. A similar pattern was demonstrated for IL-1[3 and IL-6 immunoactivity. TNF was measured by WEHI bioactivity, IL-1[~ and IL-6 immunoactivity were determined by ELISA. The sensitivity was 35 pg/ml for TNF, 30 pg/ml for IL-ll3 and 35 pg/ml for IL-6, respectively. In conclusion, both physiological as well as immunological functions of severe critically ill septic patients demonstrate predictive value for ultimate survival. While patients biological status seems to be more predictable by APACHE III at day 3, p<0.05, the pattern of cytokine production by PBMC upon LPS stimulation over the first 72h might be a reliable predictor as well. Introduction: Therapy of sepsis and its sequelae depends largely on its early recognition. Many studies have investigated the change of certain mediators during sepsis and their potential to predict multiple organ failure and outcome. It was the objective of this study to investigate whether the onset of sepsis can be predicted by alterations of levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour-necrosis-factor (TNF), PMN-elastase and C-reactive protein (CRP). Materials and methods: Over a one year period, 40 polytraumatized patients were prospectively studied (mean age 42y, 71% male, ISS 28). Serum and EDTA-plasma samples were taken in 12h intervalls until the patient left the ICU. IL-6, TNF, elastase, and CRP were determined immunologically. Sepsis was defined according to the criteria of 'systemic sepsis' (Veterans\" Administration Study, 1987) with at least 4 of 7 clinical signs: (1) tachycar-dia> 100/min, (2) temperature >38,9\u00b0C, (3) blood pressure < 100mmHg, (4) mechanical ventilation, (5) leukocytosis > 15.000 /ml, (6) thrombocytopenia < 100.000/ml and (7) presence of an obvious septic focus. Clinical parameters, sepsis severity and serum levels were documented on a daily basis, beginning on day 2 after trauma. Results: 21 of 40 patients developed a systemic sepsis (52.5%), and 5 died. All mediator levels were elevated under septic conditions. The clinical severity of sepsis correlated well with the respective levels of mediators. In patients, who developed a sepsis the following day, IL-6 (510 vs. 195 ng/l; p=0.029), CRP (160 vs. 121 mg/l; p=0.035) and TNF (32 vs. 15 ng/l; p=0.045) were significantly increased as compared to those patients who remained non-septic. Elastase levels were considerably elevated but did not reach the level of significance. We conclude that IL-6, TNF and CRP appear to be sensitive markers for prediction of septic complications in polytraumatized patients. Objectives of the study: The assessment of liver function in polytraumatized patients who are at risk of developing MOF is too inaccurate and late by using conventional biochemical parameters.",

Lidocaine is given at a dose of 1 mg/kgBW over 2 rain. i.v. and is metabolized in the liver by a cytochrome P-450 mechanism to monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX). The metabolite is measured by a fluorescence polarization immunoassay. Serial determinations of the test were performed between the 1 ~t and the 11 ~ day after trauma and were compared with other liver function tests (bilimbin, GLDH, ALT, AST). The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is still a challenge concerning early diagnosis, therapy and prognosis. Therefore, evaluation of inflammatory and disease activity becomes more important. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a well established acute phase protein in chronic inflammatory diseases. Recent reports suggest an induction of CRP by interteukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine involved in the mediator cascade of SIRS. On the other hand, tumornecmsisfactor alpha (TNFcx) is a very early released mediator in SIRS removed very rapidly from circulation. In addition, soluble TNF receptors (sTNFR~5, sTNFR75) are released into circulation in the acute phase response. This study examines the kinetics of five acute phase proteins (CRP, IL-6, TNFot, sTNFR55 , sTNFR75 ) in patients suffering from SIRS. Eighteen patients entered the study after diagnosis of SIRS. Blood samples were drawn every six hours during the first two days and every twelve hours thereafter. CRP was measured in an routine turbimetric assay. IL-6 was detected in an biological assay using the/L-6 dependent 13-cell line 1313/29. Detection of TNFc~ was performed in an ELISA system using a monoclonal antibody\" for TNFo~. Soluble TNF receptors were also measured by ELISA. CRP levels were elevated (>10 mg/L) in all patients and at all time points. CRP values did neither differ significantly in patients with (143\u00b133 mg/L) or without (129a:39) multiple organ failure (MOF) nor in survivors (133\u00b141) or non-survivors (147:t:44). In contrast, 1L-6 was elevated in patients wilh MOF (mean 740 pg/ml, range 0-8900 pg/ml). IL-6 levels correlated especially with lung dysfunction. TNF(x levels were consistently elevated in patients with MOF. CRP, IL-6 and TNFoc did not correlate with each other. In contrast, levels for both sTNFR showed a positive correlation (r=0.7). Patients could be divided into two groups by values for sTNFR~5 and sTNFR75: The group with higher soluble TNF receptor levels showed increasing values combined with a poor prognosis. The group with lower levels of soluble TNF receptor consisted of patients surviving MOF or without MOF.",

Patients: In 135 consecutive patients with multiple injuries (ISS 40.6) the inflammatory response to trauma was prospectively studied. The patients were divided into 4 groups according to their ISS points. Additionally, the alterations after 79 secondary operations (>24 hr) were determined (msteosynthesis of the femur (n=28), pelvic girdle (n=ll) and spine (n=8), facial reconstruction (n=13), smaller osteosynthesis (n=13) and others (n=6)). Methods: Specific and unspecific parameters of the inflammatory response were determined in the trauma patients every 6 h, beginning on admission of the patient to the emergency room for a period of 48 hr, and in the operative patients on the morning of the operation, at the end of the procedure and every 6 hr during the first two days. Results: Lactate, neutrophil elastase, heart rate, pO2/FiO2-ratio, and other parameters discriminated significantly between the 4 injury severity groups during the first 48 hr (Kruskal-Wallis-test, p<.05). The degree of postoperative changes differed significantly (Kmskal-Wallis-test, p<.05) between the 5 types of operations for lactate, heart rate, pO2/FiO2-ratio, nitrogen excretion and showed a strong discriminating tendency for neutrophil elastase and C-reactive protein. The extent of changes were highest after operations of the pelvic girdle, followed by procedures on the femur, spine, smaller bones, and the facial region. The postoperative changes after osteosynthesis of the femur or pelvis were comparable to the alterations noticed after smaller (ISS 1 to 24) or moderate (ISS 25 to 40) accidental trauma for neutrophil elastuse, heart rate, pO2/FiO2-ratio and parameters of the coagulation system. Conclusions: There is a considerable inflammatory response to operative procedures that varies with the type of surgery. Large operations cause changes in the body homeostasis that resemble those after multiple injuries. It remains to be established whether the inflammatory sequelae of surgical trauma are additive to the changes caused by accidental trauma. Objective of the study: We retrospectively compared characteristics of elderly patients (~65 years) and yeunger patients admitted to a surgical {SICU) and a medical intensive care unit (MICU). We further studied the relations between advancing age, chronic disease, sepsis, organ system failure (OSF) and mortality in the elderly group. Material and methods: During a 1-year period, 538 patients were consecutively admitted into the 8ICU; and during a 2-year period, 487 patients were consecutively admitted to t~MICH. Criteria for chronic disease, sepsis, OSFsi.e. cardiovascular (CF), pulmonary (PF), renal (RF), neurological (NF), haematological (HF), hepatic (LF), and gastrointestinal failure (GF)-were derived from the literature. Results: Patients from the SICU and~CU were similar in age, number of OSF, and length of stay. However, when compared to SICU patients, MICU patients had more CF (p<O.O1), sepsis (p<O.O01), and mortality rate (27% vs. ii~, p<O.OOl). In contrast, SICU patients had more HP and NF, and prior chronic disease (all, p<O.O01). Of the total group of 1,025 patients, there were 406 (40%) patients 65 years of age or older. Elderly and younger patients had comparable length of stay in the ICJ, but elderly patients had significantly more chronic disease, sepsis, and number of OSF (all, p<O.O02). All OSFs, except HF and NF, were more ~o~mon i~ mdeLjl, eompard to you-ger patients. ~he mortality is also higher in elderly patients (29% vs. 11% in younger patients). After multiple logistic regression, only number of OSF increased mortality by a factor of 2.48 (95% confidence limits, 1.97-3.12), age did not increased [odds ratio 1.05 (i.01i.i0)], while admission to the SICU reduced risk of death by a factor of 0.15 (0.08-0.30).",

Furthermore, the patients in the septic group were divided into two groups,survival (n=5) and non-survival group (n=4).tn these patients,lL-6,1L-8,ACTH and cortisol had been measured every day after diagnosis of septic shock or LOS.The total number of measurements were 12 points in survival septic group, l l points in non-survival septic group and 10 points in LOS group.Statistical analysis was used student's t-test to compare the mean of each group,and the changes were reported as clinicat significant if P<0.05. Results: IL-8 levels in non-survival septic group were higher than in both survival septic and LOS group.lL-6 levels in non-survival septic group were more significant than in both survival and LOS group.Otherwise,there were no differences with respect to ACTH and cortisol among three groups. Conclusions: We assumed that LOS would make several organs dysfunction as well as septic shock. But our results showed septic shock, especially non-survival,had different cytokins network mechanism for organs failure from LOS. Lasson ,~, G/3ransson J, JiJnsson K.",

The aim of this study was to analyse if complications after surgical trauma of various extent could be diagnosed earlier using preoperative or daily postoperative measurements of various plasma proteins than by using climcal signs of complications. Material and Methods: Two acute phase proteins (C-reactive protein and antichymotrypsin), lbur main plasma protease inhibitors (alpha-2-maeroglobulin, C 1estemse inhibitor, antithrombin Ill and alpha-2-antiplasmin) and one collagen precursor (procollagen III peptide) were measured preoperatively and then once dally for 7 days postoperatively. For the plasma protease inhibitors immunorcactive as well as functional levels were measured. Haemoglbin, albumin and the white blood cell count were also measured. Measurements were done preoperatively in 256 patients and continued postoperatively in 78 patients, 70 % of the patients were operated on for malignancy. Resulls: Preoperative plasma C-reactive protein levels were higher in patients developing postoperative complications. This discrimination increased when plasma was sequentially analysed postoperatively, when a remaining high level ora second increase in plasma levels depicted a complication 1-3 days earlier than clinical signs. High levels were seen both in patients developing local as well as in patients developing general complications. There was no clear correlation between plasma protease inhibitory levels and complications, neither pre-nor postoperatively. Procollagen III paptide levels were slightly (but not significantly) higher postoperatively in patients developing complications. Contusions: The acute phase response, especially concerning C-reactive protein, predicts postoperative complications better than both plasma protease inhibitors or collagen precursors. Preoperative plasma C-reactive protein levels indicate the risk of postoperative complications, while daily postoperative measurements more readily depicts a complication, usually preceeding the clinical signs of complication by 1-3 days.",

            "text": "Dept. of Surgery M'alm6 General Hospital, S-2 I4 01 Malmr, Sweden. MOF is a major threat to the extensive burned patients and associated with a high mortality rate. The role of endotoxemia in the pathogenesis of MOF in burned patients remains controversial. In this study, We examined the relationship of plasma endotoxin levels to development of MOF, and outcome in patients with thermal injury. Methods: A prospective cohort study of 17 patients admitted with burns covering more than 70 per cent of body surface area was undertaken. Circulating endotoxin concentrations were measured by modified limulus amebocyte lysate assay in serial samples of plasma. Results: 7 out of 17 burned patients developed MOF according to multiple criteria. The plasma endotoxin concentrations of patients with MOF were 0.512--1.127 EU/ml, significantly higher than that of 10 patients without MOF (0.216-0.553 EU/ml) on 3, 14, 21 and 28 days postburn (p< 0.05--0.01). Significantly more incidence of positive endotoxin test (>_ 0.120 EU/ml) was found in patients who developed MOF as compared to that of Non-MOF during the observation period (p<0.05). As the mean endotoxin levels increased, the prevalence of MOF and death also increased (see table below), persistent endotoxemia carried a poor prognosis. Conclusions: The present investigation provide further evidence that endotoxemia in severely burned patients commonly occur. Cimulating endotoxin has also been found to be strongly associated with development of MOF and mortality following major burn injury. Multiple hemostatic changes occur in sepsis mad multiple organ failure (MOF). To evaluate the role of platelcts in patients with sepsis and MOF, we examined changes in surface glyeoproteins on circulating platelets of t4 patients with suspected sepsis and MOF. The severity of sepsis and MOF was assessed by Eiebute and APACHE 1I scoring system, respectively.Using flow cytometric techniques and platelets specific monoclonal antibodies, platelet surface expression of fibrinogen receptor on GPIIb-IIIa, ofvon Willebrand receptor GPIb, and of granula glycoproteins (thrombospondin, GMP-140, and GP53) was measured. Receptor density of GPIIb-Illa mad GPIb on circulating platelets was not affected by sepsis or MOF. In septic patients surface expression of activated fibrinogen receptor (LIBS1 expression) was significantly elevated (p<0.05) and correlated well with severity of disease (F0.597). NO significant change in surface expression ofthrombospondin, GMP-140 or GP53 was noted in septic patients. In contrast, degranulation ofgraanle glycoproteins was significantly elevated in MOF (!0<0.05) that correlated well with severity of MOF (GMP-140, r=0.611; Thrombospondin, r=0.643).We speculate, that platelets in sepsis circulate in a hyperaggregable (fibrinogen receptor activation ) but still reversible state that results in increased risk of microthrombotic events. In the course of the disease, irreversible platelet degranulation might occur and may play an important role in development of MOF. Abdominal sepsis is still associated with high morbidity and mortality. The present study aimed at evaluating patients with abdominal sepsis treated at our surgical intensive care unit during a 10-year period with the aim of identifying potential prognostic factors, bacteriological cultures, diagnostic procedures, treatment and outcome. During the period 1983-1992 I66 patients with abdominal sepsis were treated at the ICU at our university hospital. 60 patients were women and 106 men with a mean age of 64 (17-101) years. In 74 cases, the abdominal sepsis occurred as a postoperative complication. The patients were scored according to APACHE II and bacteriological cultures and the occurrence of organ failure were noted.",

Two control groups were performed: Serum of healthy volunteers (CO, n =24) was investigated as. well as serum of patients undergoing elective herniotomy (n=12) 24 hours before (OP I) and 24 hours after operation (OP II). Serum bactericidal index (SBI) was determined using a hemolytic E.coli strain 08:K87:H19. 200/11 suspension with a final concentration of 250 -400 CFU were incubated with l OOpl serum.

Patients undergoing elective surgery showed slight but significant diminuation of SBI 24h after operation. Deterioration of SBI was observed in serum of traumatized patients directly withdrawn after admission at our hospital. Ten days after trauma significant improvement of SBI was found. Further investigations have to be done to proof sensitivity and prospectivity of this simple but reliable test. A sepsis like syndrome (SLS) occurs in i0 % of our patients following cardiac surgery. SLS is characterized by a severe decrease in systemic vascular resistance requiring the use of vasopressors to maintain adequate hemodynamics in the presence of negative blood cultures. In order to determine whether preoperative factors predict the occurrence SLS we retrospectively studied 62 patients with SLS (group i: age 61.1 ~ 10.8 years); they were compared to 52 control patients (group 2: age 58 \u00b1 14.3 years). Treatment of SLS consisted of aggressive fluid replacement and norepinephrine infusion. Rydrocortisone (200 mg/24 hrs) was given on the first day. Antibiotics were switched prophylactic to cover gramnegative bacteria in 48 pts. Preoperatively pts in group 1 revealed a significantly lower cardiac index (2.5 \u00b1 1 i/min/m 2) compared to group 2 (3.1 \u00b1 1.2 i/min/m2; p < .02) higher left atrial pressure (group i: 17.8 ~ 8.1 mmHg; group 2: 13.1 ~ 6.1 mmHg; p < .005) and lower ejection fraction (group i: 57.9 Z 16.3 %; group 2 65.2 \u00b1 10.9 %; p < .03). Bypass time, minimum and mean blood pressure on bypass and aortic clamp time were not different between the groups. Immediately postoperatively (pop), the white blood count was elevated (group i: 15,700 \u00b1 8,200/ui; group 2: 10,200 ~ 4,400/ui; p < .0005) and core temperature 12 hours pop was higher (group i: 38.3 7.6 \u00b0C; group 2: 37.6 ~ 8.4 \u00b0C; p < .004). Serum lactate was already elevated on arrival on the ICU pop (group I: 5,0 Z 1.9 mmol/l, group 2: 2.2 ~ 0.9 mmol/l) but dropped within 24 hours (p < .0005). ICU stay (group i: 3.7 ! 4.3; group 2: 1.6 \u00b1 1.9 days; p < 0.001) and mortality over 3 months (group I: 19.1 %; group 2: 3.1 %; p < .005) were significant higher in group i. SLS is observed more frequently in patients with preoperative cardiac congestion and results in longer ICU stay and higher mortality. Although intraoperative hemodynamics are similar in both groups, the white blood count and serum lactate levels suggest an intraoperative cause for SLS. Further investigations will focus on possible intraoperative causes of SLS. The objectives of the study were to estimate the problem of stress ulcers in critically ill patients and to compare Ranitidine and Omeprazole to determine their efficacy in the prophylaxis of stress ulcers. 33 patients who were admitted to the Intensive Care Units between January and July '92 with polytrauma, sepsis or those requiring ventilatory support for more than 48 hours were selected for the study. The patients were randomized into 3 groups to receive Ranitidine, Omeprazole or a placebo. The changes in gastric pH were monitored 4 hourly and the patients underwent an upper GI endoscopy 48 hours after the start of the study to look for stress ulcers and hemorrhage. The drugs were withdrawn one week after the start of the study. Of the 33 patients selected for the study, 14 had undergone cardiac surgery, 6 had polytrauma and 13 had sepsis. The change in average pre and post drug gastric pH was +1.1 in the Omeprazole group, +0.5 in the Ranitidine group and -).9 in the placebo group (p < 0.05). Endoscopic evidence of stress ulcers was seen in 62% of patients not on prophylaxis, 18.1% of those on Omeprazole and 54.5% of those on Ranitidine. While all the patients in the placebo group who had stress ulcers showed endoscopic evidence of hemorrhage, 82% of the patients with ulcers in the Ranitidine group and none of the patients with ulcers in the Omeprazole group showed hemorrhage (p < 0.01). In critically ill patients the incidence of stress ulceration is high. An alkaline gastric pH is protective against stress ulcers. Omeprazole when used for prophylaxis against stress ulcers in critically ill patients or those on short term ventilation will reduce the incidence of formation and hemorrhage from stress ulcers. The early and accurate diagnosis of sepsis is of key importance for critically ill patients survival. Many studies have shown that tumor necrosis factor ~x (TNF ~) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are mediators of the inflammatory response in sepsis. Bacterial antigens interact also with antigen specific T cell receptors and the activation of T ceils takes place. Activated T cells release soluble interteuldn-2 receptors (sIL-2R). The aim of this study was to evaluate: the significance ofTNF c~, IL-6 and slL-2R in the diagnosis of bacterial sepsis and to evaluate the correlation of clinical and laboratory parameters with serum levels of TNF ~x, IL-6 and slL-2R. We examined 19 patients with clinical signs of sepsis treated in the intensive care units of University Medical Centre Ljubljana. Venous blood was drawn from each patient within 24 hours after the first clinical signs of sepsis. Clinical data (body temperature, blood pressure), laboratory dam (peripheral white blood cell count with differential, platelet count, C-reactive protein), and quantitative blood cultures were recorded. Serum levels of TNF c~, 11,-6 and sIL-2R were measured in 19 septic patients and in 20 adult healthy controls. TNF ct, IL-6 and sIL-2R serum levels were measured by commercially available RIA and ELISA (Amersharn and Eurogenetics) kits. The differences in serttm levels of TNF ~, IL-6 and sIL-2R between healthy control and patients and correlation between clinical and laboratory parameters were calculated. We found that only slL-2R serum levels were significantly (p<0.005, Student t test) increased in patients in comparison with healthy controls. Of all indicators of sepsis that we compared, only hypotension was significantly correlated with TNF ~x levels and leukocytosis with ]1,-6 levels. We conclude that only the increased serum sIL-2R levels were predictive of bacterial sepsis within 24 hours after the first septic signs. TNF c~ and IL-6 levels were not significantly increased at that time in lifts small group of patients. In order to create high precision prognostic system for patients with sepsis and septic shock we have made prospective and retrospective analis of 200 cases of sepsis.",

Different subsets of lymphocytes and neutrophils were determined to evaluate their prognostic role in developement of MODS. In 16 trauma patients with an injury severity score (ISS) > 20 (mean ISS = 32; mean age 41 years) lymphocyte and neutrophil phenotypes CD 3 (T-cells), CD 4 (T-helper cells), CD 8 (T-suppressor cells), ratio CD 4/CD 8, CD 11b (receptor for CR 3) and CD 16 (FcRIII) were measured on day 1,2,3,5,7 and 10 post trauma. The expression of class II histocompatibility antigen (HLADR) on monocytes (HLADR+ CD 14) and IL 2-receptors on T-helper cells (CD 25/CD 41 were determined as well.

Due to the fast discovery of new chemical factors in SIRS it wilt otherwise be impossible to come up with results of randomized trials which are fascinating enough to be incorporated in daily routine treatment. Severity scoring systems are intended to provide a population-based estimate for the risk of an unwanted outcome resulting from some disease process. In the area of infections and the \"septic\" response, this has routinely been defined as death. For anti-infective trials, there has been a reasonable correlation of severity (APACHE ll) with outcome measured as persistent or recurrent infection, but this is not as robust as the association with mortality. It is expected that non-lethal failure would not immediately correlate with disturbed physiology: the basis for antiinfective failure depends on a variety of factors not measured in severity scoring, such as type of infecting organisms, density and susceptibility to administered antimicrobia[s, and anatomic features of infection (e.g., pancreatic). Severity scoring is important in differentiating these \"categorical\" variables from continuous (physiologic) variables. There are, additionally, a series of problems related to the cause of death in relation to severity scoring. In those tdals in which cause of death is analyzed, high severity scores did not routinely predict death as an immediate sequelae of sepsis/septic shock. Many of the predicted deaths occurred remotely of progressive background diseases. Other important problems with severity scoring have to do with lead-time bias: hew long patients were ill before entry into the study. Statistical techniques for condensing various categorical and continuous variables, as well as factoring in information requiring the pharmacodynamics of agents which affect outcome, are being developed to further refine deviation from predictive equations as an outcome measure. Stepwise logistic regression analysis has identified the presence of shock, intm-abdominal or unknown source of infection, hospital acquired infection, age greater than 70 years, neutropenia and inappropriate antimicmbial therapy as independent variables associated with increased mortality in sepsis. Maldistribution or\" these variables is a concern in targe randomized clinical studies. It should be noted that only the selection of antimicrobiaI therapy could be addre.~'sed and altered at the time of enrollment in a sepsis clinics] trial. Inappropriate antimicrobial therapy has been noted in 41%-66% of septic patients. Well designed, randomized sepsis trials do not assure the absence of imbalance between treatment and control groups with regard to inappropriate antibiotic therapy, especially with subgroup analysis. Statistical manipulation to correct for any imbalance is appropriate but avoiding imbalance is ideal. Selection of antibiotics in septic patients requires such considerations as clinical setting (history, physical examination and underlying disease), appropriate laboratory tests (such as gram stain), identification of source and associated bacterial flora, antibiotic susceptibility patterns for that hospital and likelihood of resistant organisms. Determination of inappropriate antibiotic therapy is made retrospectively after culture results are available. In some circunmtances the organism and antibiotic sensitivities cannot be predicted, while in others it can. Leibovici et al identified hospital acquired infection, antibiotic treatment before a bacteremic episode, endotracheal intubetion and thermal trauma as independent variables which predicted isolation of a multiresistant organism. The same authors developed a predictive index for resistant organisms, which when compared to prescriptions of attending physicians, improved antibiotic selection in critically ill patients. Including a standard antibiotic regimen for all septic patients in a clinical trial is impractical. There is too much interhopsital variability in flora and antibiotic susceptibility. In addition, the aggressive broad spectrum coverage necessary for some patients is inappropriate for others. A protocol which guides a prescribing physician through a logical chain of reasoning might improve antibiotic selection in critically ill patients and could be included in the design of a clinical trial in sepsis. Although this approach might minimize potential for maldistribution of inappropriate antimierobial therapy, it would likely create multiple problem areas. Will the patient's physicians agree to the protocol choice? What is the availability of speciftc antibiotics at a participating hospital? What is the aplpiieability of study results in typical clinical situations? If there is agreement that thin is an appropriate antibiotic protocol, should it not be used in all seriously ill septic patients in the hospital? In other conditions such as ARDS, the success of protocol therapy is dependent upon measurable goals such as Pao 2 and highest plateau pressure, while measurable goals are not as clear in choosing antibiotics. Based on the above confounding issues, a complex and extensive algorithm covering many potential possibilities of error and specific antibiotics seems impractical; however, an algorithm focusing on three to four major common errors in antibiotic selection and dealing with classes of antibiotics is plausible for inclusion in sepsis clinical trials. In this session we will attempt to outline the methodology of such a future study, emphasizing the immense difficulties involved in its proper conduction including: design, selection of patients, surgical considerations, supportive treatment, the \"human factor\" and ~nd points.",

Although in many instances it is entirely possible that the agent in question does not have clinical efficacy, an equally plausible explanation for the multitude of negative results is that the studies were improperly designed and thus could not show therapeutic benefit, if it existed. Problems which have been identified in these various trials include inappropriate or unrealistic definitions of response to the drug; inadequate sample size, with attendant insufficient statistical power to demonstrate a difference, if it existed; insufficient standardization of customary therapeutic maneuvers in septic patients; imprecise criteria for patient entry into the study, which creates unacceptable inhomogeneity between control and treatment groups and invites unjustified post-study subgroup analysis; the lack of a formal sequential monitoring procedure for interim data analysis, which could potentially affect patient safety; and a primary analysis of study results that excludes protocol deviants and is not according to intent-to-treat. These and other problems have impacted upon the validity of the various trials conducted to date and may well have prevented the resolution of controversies surrounding the use of certain agents in the treatment of septic patients. The complexity of bacterially-induced septic shock involves a cascade of events that evolve over time, beginning with the proliferation of offending organisms and followed by the release of toxic mediators from the bacteria. Endotoxins [e.g. lipopolysaccharides) from gram-negative bacteria initiate septic shock by precipitating a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) through release of a broad spectrum of hostderived mediators. Over the last century, hundreds of these endogenous mediators have been proposed to serve as pathophysiological substances in this \"alphabet soup\" of cytokines, eieosanoids, biogenic amines, kinins, peptides, ions and hormones. An evaluation of the literature on septic shock leaves the investigator with a sense that, although many pieces of the septic shock puzzle have been presented, no clue was provided to indicate how these pieces fit together, In an attempt to assess objectively the causal role of individual mediators, we recently completed a collective meta-analysis of 24 mediators that were individually reviewed and subjected to Koch-Dale analysis of causality by distinguished authorities in the field (1). In summary, our attempt analyze available evidence to support a cause-and-effect relationship for putative mediators of septic shock revealed that only eight of the 24 mediators analyzed could be strongly inferred as playing a causal role in septic shock. Evidence supported the involvement of endotoxln, endorphins, complement, interleukins, tumor necrosis factor, eieosanoids, platelet activating factor and calcium. Other mediators either lacked adequate supportive evidence or were not conclusively involved. Posttraumatic outcome may be reduced by an amplified stress response mediated by neural and humoral stimuli. The classical hormonal catabolic response is predominantly mediated directly or indirectly by neural stimuli, while most changes in inflammatory responses such as leukocytosis, acute phase proteins and changes immunofunction are mediated by humoral mediators. Clinical experience from controlled studies suggest afferent neural blockade and modification of stress response to improve organ function and postoperative outcome, and limited experimental studies also suggest neural blockade to be of beneficial value in shock states. Of special value may be the improved gastro-intestinal motility after neural (visceral) blockade. No outcome studies are available from patients with major truma, multiple organ failure or sepsis, conditions where humorai mediators may be more important to modify than neurally mediated responses. Future studies should investigate the clinical outcome effect of combined neural and humoral mediated blockade, as well as the potential role of an initial neural blockade in elective trauma (first hit) to improve the metabolic scene and outcome if a postoperative complication (second hit) should occur. Neutrophil elastase is the predominant protease of the human neutrophil. This enzyme, and a variety of other enzymes, including neutrophil collagenase, are released by activated neutrophils in the setting of high concentrations of reactive oxygen metabolites. In addition, in this extracellular environment, the normal antiprotease defense mechanisms of the organism may have been severely inactivated oxidatively especially along capillary endothelial cells. Accordingly, release of neutrophil elastase which mediates inflammation and degrades most extracellular matrix proteins, including elastin, fibronectin and many forms of collagen, may contribute to tissue injury and organ failure in a variety of diseases ranging in severity and acuity from pulmonary emphysema to the Adult Respiratory Distress syndrome (ARDS). As a result, significant efforts by the pharmaceutical industry have been directed not only toward the development of human neutrophil elastase inhibitors, but also toward their characterization in a variety of animal models of neutrophil mediated diseases, and their evaluation as potential therapeutics for the treatment of a variety of human clinical conditions. Data from animal models of organ injury and failure along with data collected from a series of patients at risk for ARDS and with ARDS will be presented and discussed as a rationale for inhibition of neutrophil elastase. Parameters that need to be monitored to obtain success in future clinical studies will also be presented in this context. have turned out to initiate and maintain organ dysfunctions in severe posttraumatic and postoperative courses. Such proteolysis-induced disorders are especially rendered possible by the concurrently arising consumption of inhibitory regulators (e.g. a Vproteinase inhibitor=a 1PI, antithrombin III=AT III) via cofnplex formation and/of proteolytic/oxidative inactivation.",

Soluble mediators of inflammation are cytokines (e.g. IL-1, IL-6 and TNFe) as well as breakdown products of complement proteins (e.g. C5a and terminal complement complex). Therefore, attenuation of both, release and generation of these synergistically functioning mediators together with stimulation of release of antagonists including soluble forms of receptors are potentially beneficial in all kind of inflammatory diseases. Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs) are known to have an anti-inflammatory effect in humans (NIH Consensus Conference on WIG, 1990) . The mechanism of action becomes more and more clear. In single cells stimulated by anti-CD3 mAb WIG was able to down-regulate production of IL-2, IL-10, IFN% and TNFJ~ significantly. IgG coated solid-phase stimulates release from monocytes of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-lra) but not of IL-1; this observation is very much in contrast to the effect of endotoxin in the same in vitro system. Furthermore, naturally occurring anti-cytokine antibodies can be demonstrated in apparently healthy individuals and in WIG prepared from plasma pools. Some of these antibodies can be detected by antigen/antibody reactions in fluid phase (anti-lL-le, anti-IL-6), some only by solid-phase detection systems (anti-lL-8, anti-IFN% anti-TNFc 0. Infusion of WIG to patients suffering from inflammatory disorders have resulted in a decrease in IL-6 in circulation. During infusion WIG might induce an acute but transient rise of TNFo~, IL-6, and IL-8. Self limitiation of this process might be due to demonstrable instant release of IL-1 ra and soluble TNFo~ receptors. In vitro IVIG has also been shown to attenuate complement activation via the classical pathway. Furthermore, acid haemolysis of erythrocytes in paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria could partially be prevented by IVIG. IVIG was able to attenuate Forssman shock in guinea pigs. We have seen a patient with congenitally elevated turnover of alternative pathway of complement who repeatedly showed an increase of haemolytic titres after administration of IVIG. Thus, WIGs apparently have multiple potencies including attenuation of soluble mediators of inflammation and might therefore be of benefit in trauma, shock, and sepsis.",

Peter Imrodnetlea and Methods: Hydrocortisone (HC) at an infusion rate similar to the maximal secretory rate of cortisol in man improves hemodynamics in human septic shock (1). We hypothesized that the HC-induced hypercortisolemia prevents a harmful overshoot of immune reactions. To test this hypothesis we prospectively investigated 12 patients admitted to the ICU in refractory septic shock. After resuscitation (mechanical ventilation, fluid resuscitation, titration of vasopressors, and initiation of antimicrobial therapy) HC Was started with a loading dose of 100 mg/ 30 rain, followed by a continuous infusion (10 mggh). With hemodynamic improvement (dopamine < 2 gg/kg/min) the infusion rate nfHC was tapered over a period of 3 days. Phospbolipase A 2 (PLA2), C-reactive protein (CRP), and elastase-proteinase inhibitor complex (E-PI) were deierminated daily. Results: According to our previous results hemodynamics improved during HC infusien. After 4 days dopamine requirements decreased to less than 2 gg&g/min in all patients. This corresponded to an attenuation of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) indicated by the abrogation of fever and the decrease in heart rate and inflammatory mediators. PLA 2 activity and E-PI concentrations decreased to near normal values and CRP concentrations decreased as well. After cessation of HC infusion (between day 5 and 7) a reinforcement nfthe SIRS was observed despite cortisol levels within the normal range. This was first indicated by E-PI, followed by fever, increases in heart rate, CRP, PLA2, and finally by the relapse of septic shock in four patients on days 7,8 9, and 1O. A second infusion of HC again resulted in shock reversal and in a decrease in PLA2, CRP, and E-PI in the patients under study. Discussion: There is growing evidence that the endogenous steroid HC and proinflammatory cytokines integrate a complex immunoregulatory feec~ack circuit. The elaboration of TNF, IL-16, IL-6, and IL-8 is attenuated by-100 rag HC prior to endotoxin challenge in humans (2, 3) . Cytokines like TNF, IL-16, IL-6, and IL-8 are potent proinflammatory signals for acute reactants (--, CLIP), neutrophil degranulation (--, E-PI), and PLA 2 synthesis and secretion. Our data provide evidence that HC at an infusion rate similar to the maximal secretory rate of cortisol in man attenuates the systemic inflammatory response in human septic shock. To evaluate the feasibility of a nigh-dose regimen of antithrombin III (AT III) treatment in patients with multiple injuries regarding blood levels of antithrombin III and undesired side effcts and to analyse effects of the initibitortherapy on the systemic inflammatory response. Patients and methods: 20 patients with an ISS nf more than 28 points who could be treated with AT III administration within 180 rain after trauma were randomized to receive either AT III or placebo. AT III was given to reach an antithrombin III inhibitory capacity in plasma of 140% by using the following calculation: AT III to administer = (140% -AT III measured) x body weight. AT III was given every six hours for a period nf48 hours and on the 4th day. Patients were followed up throughout their stay in the ICU but at least 14 days. In this abstract the data of the first 10 patients are included. Results: The patients' median injury severity score was 41 points with a median age of 42 years. The patients were equally distributed between verum and placebo groups with respact to age , ISS, prehospital treatment, blood pressure, hemoglobin and AT nMevel on admission, and time from the accident until the test solution was given. The patients of the AT III group received 18,100 units of the inhibitor on average during the first 4 days. With our regimen, the AT III levels could be kept between 125% and 140% of normal, whereas control patients an AT HI concentration of 40% to 60% was observed. Patients with AT nI treatment required less red blood cells bur received the same amount of FFP and fluids. There were no differences with respect to platelet count, partial thromboplastin time, l~rothrombin time and prothrombim. We did not observe bleeding disorders or any other side effect with peak concetrations of up to 206% of normal. White blood count, PMN--elastase, Interleukin 6 and 8 and C-reactive protein tended to be lower in the AT III group. There were no differences with respect to renal and hepatic function parameters but the duration od mechanical ventilation was shorter in the AT II1 group (8.5 vs. 15.8 days) Conclusions: We conclude that our treatment protocol (a) was able to restore AT IIl levels to the desired range of 140%, (b) did not lead to coagulation disorders, (c) did not increase transfusion requirements, (d) did not reveal other undesired side effects, and (e) showed a tendency towards reduced posttranmatic inflammation and mechanical ventilation requirements Department of Trauma Surgery, 45122 Essen, Germany Antithrombin-lll (AT-Ill) acts as an inhibitor of thrombin, further proteases and the alternative pathway of the complement system.

Permission for the clinical study was given by the local ethic committee. Bradykinin (BK) and related kinins are potent inflammatory peptides which possess the ability to induce, vasodilation, increased vascular permeability and hyperalgesia. CP-0127, a novel homodimer BK antagonist has previously been shown to increase survival in rat and rabbit models of lethal endotoxin shock and is now in clinical trials for sepsis. We have now evaluated the effect of CP-0127 in other models of inflammation. Male rats were precannulated with a catheter in the carotid artery. 24h later BK was injected ia and the pain score ranked from 0 (no responses) to 5 (vocalization). CP-0127 at 3.6 umoles/kg completely inhibited the pain responses for a period of 2.5 -3h. CP-0127 at 3.6 umoles/kg s.c. was also found to inhibit the increase in paw volume and hyperalgesia induced in rats over a 3-4h period by an intraplantar injection of 0.1% carrageenan. The abdominal constriction response 1o an intraperitoneal injection of kaolin was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by CP-0127. When 50 ul of 0.5% formalin was injected into the paw of a mouse a characteristic licking response was observed which was biphasic in nature. CP-0127 significantly inhibited both the first (0-5min) and second (15-30 min) phase responses. ]n a rat burn model, where the hind paw is immersed in water at 55\u00b0C for 15 sec the increase in paw volume was significantly reduced by pretreatment with CP-0127, 3.6 umoles/kg s.c. Finally cerebrai edema was induced in rats by applying cold (-78\u00b0C for 10 sec) to the dural surface following a craniectomy. CP-0127 at 3.6 umoles/kg s.c. produced a significant reduction in the amount of edema compared with sham controls 24 h later. These data suggest that BK is an important mediator of inflammation and hyperalgesia and that the bradykinin antagonist, CP-0127, may be useful in the treatment of such inflammatory, hyperalgesic disorders. Partial hepatectomy in humans is associated with a considerable morbidity due to hemodynamic and metabolic derangements, which increase the risk for organ failure and mortality. We hypothesized that endotoxemia may play a pivotal role in these complications. We therefore, investigated whether peri-operative infusion of rBPI23, a recombinant protein of the human neutrophil BPI with bactericidal and endotoxin-binding capacity, could prevent postoperative derangements following partial hepatectomy. Male Wistar rats (230-250 g.) received a 70% liver resection (phx) or a sham operation (sh), and a continuous intravenous infusion of either 0.2 mg/kg/hr rBPI23 (phx-bpi, n=8; sh-bpi, n=7) or the (iso-electric, iso-kD) control protein thaumatin (phx-con, n=8; sh-con, n-8). Various parameters were measured 4 h after the resection or sham operation. Mean arterial pressure, cardiac output and heart rate were significantly decreased in phx-con rats compared with sh rats, which effects were not observed in phx rats treated with rBPI23. Blood pH was significantly decreased in the phx-eon group, whereas the leucocyte count, hematocrite and IL-6 levels were significantly increased compared to sham levels. In the phx-bpi group, these parameters were restored to near sham levels. In vitro experiments with rat plasma and human mononuclear cells (MNCs) revealed that plasma of phx-con rats is highly capable of activating MNCs, accompanied by the release of cytokines. This activation is attenuated with phx-bpi plasma. In vitro added aCD14 or polymyxin B was able to reduce the activation by phx-con rat plasma to the levels of phx-bpi rats Thus, these data suggest that systemic endctoxemia, possibly of gut origin, is a major cause of postoperative hemodynamic and metabolic derangements following phx and that rBPIzz can prevent these changes. More recently we reported a transient appearance of both endotoxin and TNF in the circulation of rats subjected to the haemorrhagic shock (HS) already at 90 -120 rain. Similar to BPI, recombinant BPI was found to bind LPS and inhibit TNF formation in vitro. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of rBPI21 (kindly provided by Xoma corporation, Berkeley, CA) against haemorrhage related endotoxemia and mortality in rats. Method: A prolonged HS was induced by blood withdrawal to a mean arterial pressure of 30-35 mmHg for 180 rain followed by reinfusion of shed blood (SB) and resuscitation with two times of SB volume of Ringer's lactate over 50 rain. rBPlg. 1 was administered at a total dose of 5 mg/kg i.v. (2.0 mg/kg at the16-eginning followed by two doses of 1.5 mg/kg each at end of shock and the end of resuscitation). The control group was treated similar to the BPI group but received thaumatin as a protein control preparation at the same dose as rBPI21. Results: Imrffe?diately after resuscitation (230 min) the detected plasma endotoxin levels in the control group (mean = 61, range = 0-120 pg/ml) were almost neutralized by rBPI21 treatment (mean = 13, range = 0-53 pg/ml) . Plasma TNF levYIs were not significantly influenced by rBPI treatment at the two time points 230 and 320 min of experiment (means: 65 and 51 in BPI vs 49, 65 pg/ml in the control group). The 48-hour survival rate was improved from 6/16 (37.5 %) in the control to 11/16 (69 %). Conclusion: These data suggest that haemorrhagic shock may lead to bacterial translocation and/or transient endotoxemia with concomitant cytokine formation that may play an important role in the pathogenesis after shock and trauma, rBPI21 might be a useful therapeutic agent against endogenous bacterFal/endotoxin related disorders in hemorrhagic shock. Morbidity and mortality after hypoxia of the vital organs had been correlated to the production of oxygen radicle which is mediated by xanthine oxidase activity,",

Serial gastroscopy, gastric pH, hemodynamics, ABG's, physiologic dead space ventilation, leukocyte counts, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels were recorded for 180 min. Baseline values and units were cardiac index 102 _+ 9 ml/min/kg (CI), arterial PO2 228 + 11 mmHg(PaO2), base excess 6.5 -+ 1 meq (BE), physiologic dead space fraction 23 +_ 4% (PDS), and TNF 0.4 + 0.1 units/ml. Baseline gastric pH was 3.9 -+ 0.4 and 4.8 _+ 0.5 in the placebo and ranitidine groups, respectively. The gastritis following hemorrhage was marginally attenuated in the ranitidine group. Following LPS infusion the following were obtained: CI PaO2* BE* Gastric* PDS* Peak* 120 rain 60 rain 120 rain pH 120 min TNF Ranitidine 167_+17 118_+15 -4.4\u00b11. Bum injury results in hypermetabolism, fever and nitrogen wasting. Endotoxin (LPS) has been proposed to mediate these effects, either directly or via activation of macrophages to produce cytokines such as interleukin-6 (II-6). This study was designed to clarify the role of LPS and 11-6 in the metabolic response to bum injury. Twenty-five burn patients (49 -+ 17%; 16 + 15% FT BSA burn; 32 _+ 16 years old) were studied serially for three weeks post bum. Patients underwent partitional calorimetry to assess metabolic rate and compartmented heat loss. Nitrogen was assayed using chemiluminescence.",

Patients were excluded if they suffered smoke inhalation, showed any sign of sepsis or failed to rapidly meet their nutritional needs via the enteral route. Ten patients received intravenous Polymixin B (5,000 U/kg/day to bind LPS). These patients did not differ for the remainder. All patients were hypermetabolic and febrile in proportion to the size of their bum wound but were not endotoxemic (3.1 +_ 5.6 pg/ml; normal <40 pg/ml). I1-6 did demonstrate a significant correlation with cole temperature (Tr~ = 37.6 + 0.21ogi1-6, P=0.04) and with nitrogen excretion (Nou t = -5.2 4-0.091ogi1-6 + 0.14TR, P=0.01). Administration of polymixin B had no effect on metabolic rate, temperature or I1-6 levels but did reduce nitrogen excretion resulting in more positive nitrogen balance (0.t grn/day vs. -0.1 gm/day, P=0.04). Although bum injury does not produce an obligatory endotoxemia, I1-6 does appear to play a role in the fever and nitrogen wasting seen with such injuries. The effect ofPolymixin B on nitrogen excretion suggests that LPS may play a role either locally or in the portal system. Introduction: There is substantial evidence that release of inflammatory mediators by activated Kupffer cells contribute to the course of a systemic inflammatory process, e.g. after shock or lrauma. Besides the systemic effects of mediators such as TNF, PAF or interleukines, local actions on hepatic microvasculature and hepatic inflammatory response have to be considered. Our aim was to assess the role of TNF and PAF by blocking their effects using anti-TNF monoclonal antibody, pentoxifylline and a PAF antagonist. Methnds: In anesthetized SPRD-rats, hemorrhagic shock was induced by withdrawl of arterial blood within 5 rain and shock state was hold for 1 h at a MAP of 40 mm Hg (cardiac output of 50 %). Following adequate resuscitation with 60% of shed blood and twice of this volume as Ringer's solntion, animals recovered to MAP >1130 mm Hg and CO >120%. Hepatic microcirculation and sinusoidal leukocyte-endothelium interactions were examined by intravital epi-fluorescence microscopy at 1, 3, or 5 hours after resuscitation. In a blinded fashion, a rat-specific monoclonal anti-TNF antibody [2 mg/kg, Celltech, UK) , pentoxffylline (PTX, 50 mg/kg, Hoechst, D), and a PAF antagonist (WEB 2086, Boehringer, Ingh., D) were given either as pretreatment or at the time of resuscitation (n=6-8 group Bolla.

            "text": "Prevention of temporary/secondary immune deficiencies or reduction of their severity and/or duration as well as the reduction of the perifocal inflammatory processes belong to the rational targets of posttraumatic/pedsurgical medication. Such a targeted medication can result in less frequently occurring nosocomial infections, and in reducing the duration of the intensive care and convalescence period. The results of in vitro studies performed with the amino acid sequence 32-35 of thymopoietin, i.e., with thymocartin in whole blood and peripheral mono-nuclear celI(PBNC) cultures clearly show some characteristic effects of this immunomodulator. Preincubation with the tetrapeptide significantly (p<O.Ol) and concentration-dependent reduced the endotoxin(LPS)-induced TNFalfa production from 95,7 to about 20 pglml, but did not abolish it. The inhibition of the LPS(0.1 ug/ml)-induced TNF production occured already in presence of 0,1 pg peptide/ml and peaked at the concentration of 0,01 ng/ml. Higher concentrations did not increase this effect. In contrast to the other two small thymic peptides (TP-3 and TP-5), thymocartin did not enhanced the PWM-induced PGE 2 production in PBMC cultures up to a concentration of 1 ng/ml, inclusive. The selection of thymocartin (TP-4) for perisurgical medication and/or for treatment of trauma-induced temporary immune depression has been strongly supported also by targeted animal experiments. Thus, mortality of about 90% registered in mice infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa after bum injury could be reduced with the tetrapeptide treatment to a level which did not differ significantly from that of the infected non-burned controls. Moreover, observations gathered first of all with the inflammatory model of air poach/croton oil grenuloma (SELYE) clearly showed, that a very definite, antiexudative effect can be achieved with this thymic peptide. As to this effect, thymocartin has been confirmed, e.g., to be equipotent with locally administered fluocinolone acetonide and/or s.c. injected prednisolone.",

The treatment significantly reduced the occurence of nosocomial infections, the days spend in intensive care and on antibiotics as well as it shortened the bed-out time and reduced the additional medication. Objective of this prospective randomized study was to further delineate the mechanisms leading to these alterations and to investigate the effects of immunomodulatory intervention. Patients and Methods: 20 patients (pts) formed control group A. 20 group B pts received 3x50 mg Indomethacin (Indo) from the first (dl) to the fourth postoperative day (d5) intravenously to block prostaglandin E2induced suppression of CMI response as well as 50 mg Thymopentin (TP-5) subcutaneously preop., on d2 and d4 to augment CMI reactivity. In vitro investigations preoperatively, on dl and d7 included measurements of the percentage of CD4+ T-helper (TH) cells, pbytohemagglutinin (PHA)induced synthesis of interleukin (IL)-2 as one cytokine primarily produced by THl-cells, and PHA-induced synthesis of IL-6 as one cytokine primarily produced by TH2-cells. Delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin response to an antigen skin test battery and specific antibody (AB) production following tetanus vaccination preoperatively and on d7 were used as in vivo tests for THl-and TH2-induced immune response respectively. Results: Postoperatively, group A pts showed a persistent significant reduction of CD4+ TH cells, IL-2/IL-6 ratio, and DTH skin response as compared to baseline values (BL), while AB production increased (p<0.05 vs.BL). In group B pts no change in CD4+ TH cells, IL-2/IL-6 ratio, or DTH skin response was observed (p<0.05 vs.group A), and postoperative AB production increased significantly (n.s. vs. group A). Conclusions: 1.These results clearly indicate a significant suppression of TH1 induced CMI response, while TH2 induced response remains normal following OHS. 2.These alterations may gain clinical significance whenever a postoperative infection requires a TH1 response and may explain the susceptibility to opportunistic microorganisms observed in pts after OHS. 3 The aim of this study was to find out whether the establishment of administration of Thymostimulin (TP-I) in jaundiced and anergic rats would return the rats to the state of immunocompetence.

Adoptive transfer of L~ymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells has been demonstrated as a means of enhancing therapy in malignant tumors. We therefore attempt to use LAK therapy on burned-infected mice instead of IL-2. Under anesthesia, 8-weekold male C3H-Hej mice were subjected to a 20% scald or sham burn and then resuscitated. Sham burned mice served as controls. Scald burn mice were subjected to peritonitis by intraperitoneal innoculation of 105 organisms of P. aeruginosa 24 hr after burn. Burned-infected-mice were divided into two groups. One group had no further treatment, and the other group received LAK cells (2x105) intraperitonelly after septic challenge. The mice were scored for survival daily. On day 7 after burn, Using Moabs dual-color flow cytometry, we studied lymphocyte expression in mice with use of blood and spleen. Simultaneousely we studied the alteration of IL-1 and IL-6 in their serum using immunoassy kits. Sham burned animals had no mortality. The mortality of the LAK-treated mice was significantly reduced when compared with that of the burned-infected mice. The most consistent changes observed were depressions in percentages of Thyl, 2 positive cells and a remarkable depression of NK cells in spleen. After LAK cell treatment, those two percentages of cells significantly increased. All the data of assay of ILl and [L 6 were not detected on sham burn mice serum. Due to burn and septic challenge the levels of ILland IL 6 (n=6) were raised to 45.9_+17.4 and 3866_+1045 pg/ml, while the levels in LAK treated mice were reduced to 4.23_+2.37 and 437_+110 pg/ml, respectively. The results reported here demonstrate that LAK therapy is able to improve cell-mediated immunity in burned-infected mice. This is associated with a significantly improved survival rate, since ILl has been demonstrated to mediate immune and inflammatory responses. Also a cause effect relationship between elevated endetoxin levels and increases of [L6 has been recently established.

            "text": "Oxidants play a role in physiology. The potential noxious oxidant biochemistry is restrained by chemically distinct antioxidants. These antioxidants, which may reside in different cellular compartments, can act synergistically. In normal physiology an oxidant/antioxidant bai&nce exists. Unbalance in favour of the oxidants is called oxidative stress. Oxidative stress has been implicated in many pathologies including lung diseases(e.g, doxorubicin induced cardiotoxicity), ischemia/reperfnsion damage and central nervous system trauma. Transition metals such as iron are involved in the early events leading to oxidative damage in these pathologies. This has been underlined by the finding that postischemic CNS pathology closely resembles that caused by a chemical oxidative insult (e.g. iron microinjection). Moreover, a protective effect of oxygen-radical scavening agents or compounds that inhibit lipid peroxidation (antioxidants) in brain ischemia/trauma is apparent. Some known drugs (e.g. anti-arrhythmics or histamine H2-antagonists may act as non-specific antioxidants. Howe~er, recently, interesting new membrancespecific antioxidants (e.g. 21-aminosterdids) have been designed. Subt&e effects on iron redox chemistry contributes to the potent antioxidant activity of these 21aminosteroids. Since a few years, one area that greeted enthusimastlcally in clinical medicine is that of reoxygenatlon injury or ischemia-repeffusion, a phenomenon accepted to make a majo:\" contribution to organ dysfunction in trauma, shock and sepsis through the formation o( oxygenated free radical species. However, thei detection in vivo always remains a difficult challenge. Efforts have been made recently to directly establish the formation of free radicals in biological samples as complex as blood, plasma or tissue with the use of electron spin resonance (esr) spectroscopy. Using spin trapping agents, the presence of reactive carbon-and oxygen-centered radicals has been demonstrated in animals blood submitted to heart, renal and intestinal ischemia-repeffusion or to liver transplantation. Recently, the in vivo formation of free radicals in the cerebra; extracellnlar fluid during cerebral isehemia-repeffusion has been assessed by the spin trapping technique coupled to brain microdialysis. Esr investigations have also been conducted to detect endotoxin-induced free radical generation in rat or baboon liver and ",

            "text": "Oxygen free radicals (OFR), produced both at intra-and extra-cellular levels, seem to play a major role in the pathophysiology of tissue injury and organ dysfunction in sepsis, through induction of lipid pemxidation in cell membranes. Oxidative damage can result both to an OFR-overpmduction or to a depletion of endogenous antioxidant defenses, which are represented by scavenger enzymes (e.g. SOD), hydrosoluble and liposoluble antioxidants (e.g. ascorbate, vitamin E), and other mechanisms such as metal-ion sequestration. In animal models, oxidative damage has been proved by detection of increased levels of lipoperoxidative products, and a depletion of antioxidant defenses was found both in plasma and tissues. In the few clinical studies a similar results have been reported, and oxidative damage appears to correlate with DIC, with organ dysfunction and with red blood cell deformability. In a group of critically ill septic patients we found increased levels of conjugated dienes (CD) (bioproducts of lipoperoxidation) and decreased plasma levels of alpha-tocopherol and coenzyme Qlo (CoQI0)(endogenous liposoluble antioxidants). A relationship between CD and uric acid (p<0.004) was found, may be related to xantine-dehydmgenase to xantine-oxidase conversion. Antioxidant depletion is due both to overconsumption and to a nutritional deficiency, even if a reduced synthesis can also be present. In fact one more relationship between CoQI0 and plasma cholesterol (p<0.0005) demonstrates the commun hepatic biosynthetic defect. Is there any role for antioxidative therapy in sepsis? Can it achives a significant improvement in the septic course, organ dysfunction, and final outcome? Several antioxidant drugs, have been evaluated in experimental and clinical sepsis: scavenger enzymes, natural antioxidants, alloporinol, 21-aminosteroids or lazaroids, have been proved to reduce lipopemxidative damage, to protect organ dysfunction, and in some cases to improve survival. Several questions must be addressed in evaluating safety and utility of antioxidative therapy. More specific and standardized methods must be applied to detect and quantify the lipoperoxidative damage. Antioxidant drags must act selectively on OFR-production, without interference with other than that are beneficial for the organism. Antioxidants must be able to achive in adequate amount the tissue or cellular compartment where their action is required. Many antioxidants have also a pro-oxidative effect which can he detrimental in some conditions. The timing of administration, the dosage used and the association wih others antioxidant drugs must be defined. Nutrition plays an important role as antioxidative therapy, since it supplies all compounds needed to maintain adequately levels of endogenous antioxidant or to support their synthesis. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) concentration in serum has been determined in a large population of healthy subjects and in patients suffering acute hepatitis and chronic cases of hepatitis C, as well as several other processes. The correlation with different physiological and clinical parameters in these populations is also presented. Treatment with interferon of the chronic active hepatitis C patients, 5x10 U three times a week during two months, led in those patients whose SGPT activity normalized in serum, to a concomitant decrease in serum TBARS content. The possible theoretical involvement of peroxidation and antioxidants in this beneficial effect of i~terferon in hepatitis C patients is discussed. The results presented confirm the value of TBARS as laboratory test in the management of disease and as a useful tool for the study of pathogenic and/or therapeutic mechanisms. 4-Hydroxyalkenals are among the different substances measured by the TBARS assay. These compounds show several biological effects that have been demonstrated mainly in different experimental models. We have studied the capacity of different tissues to conjugate these compounds ",

Among the many treatments that have been prol~osed to treat this condition, none has been shown to be satisfactorily effective. Recently, a new drug, namely the 21-aminosteroid Tirilazadmesylats, has been studied in a large, prospective, multicentor trial for its effectiveness to improve the outcome of patients with aneurysma! SAId. The study was conducted in Europe and Australia in 41 neurosurgical centers and included 1023 patients. All patients received presently accepted standard treatment, including nimodipine. Patients were randomized to four different groups: placebo and 8 groups of tirilazad in escalating dosage (0.6 -6 mg/kg/day). The clinical outcome was compared for these 4 groups and cerebral a~giography was performed in 75 % of patients on day 7 -11 follovang SAH, to study the effect 0f'the dflf~ off Cerebral vasospasm. The study reached its planned endpoint 6 months ago. Preliminary results ~how a significant improvement with regardto mortality in those patients receiving the highest tirilazad dose as compared to placebo and the two lower dose groups. Additional beneficial effects were seen in the 6 rag/day groups with regard to the occurence of symptomatic vasospasm and good clinical outcome. Although the final analysis of all data is still pending, these results suggest that tirilazad-mesylate could represent a major improvement for the treatment of patients with SAIl. Experimentally lipidperoxidation products (LPO) are increased in acute pancreatitis (AP) due to oxygen radicals (OR). The purpose of this clinical study was to determine the antioxidant status and LPO in patients suffering from AP and tO evaluate the effect of antioxidant treatment with sodium selenite (SE) thus improving the function of the SE dependant glutathione peroxidase which is the major detoxifying system for OR. Materials and Methods: In Z0 patients sufferin s from severe AP (C-reactlve protein >120 mE/l) we determined on day 1 and day 8 after admission the LPO ma!ondialdehyd (MDA), conjugated dishes (CD), reduced (GSR) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione, the vitamins A,C,E and SE. Moreover the patients were evaluated clinically using the RANSON and the APACHE II score. I0 patients were randomly treated with 600 ug/day of SE for 8 days. Results: All patients suffered from a severe depletion of antioxidants,especially a low concentration of SE (only 1/3 of normal). Thereby the increase in LPO correlated with the clinical course. During SE treatment LPO decreased and the levels of antioxidant vitamins improved. SE had no influence on leth-slity the lenl or the chan in RS or AP II. Background: Since reperfusion injury occurs when oxygen is reintroduced into ischemic tissue, the ideal timing for administration of therapeutic compounds aimed at ameliorating oxygen radical mediated injury is at the time of initial fluid resuscitation. Currently used colloid or crystalloid preparations do not provide optimal, or even significant, anti-oxidant protection. Systemic iron chelation affords protection against the iron catalyzed components of oxygen and lipid radical mediated tissue injury. The conjugate resulting from chemical attachment of the clinically approved iron chelator, deferoxamine (DFO, Desferal \u00ae, Ciba), to hydroxyethyl starch (HES) represents a novel approach to colloid based fluid resuscitation. HES-DFO contains 85% HES and 15% chemically bound DFO. The polymer-drug conjugate has a lower molecular weight than that of HES in order to allow more rapid excretion. Results: Preclinical and initial clinical trials indicate that HES-DFO is well tolerated, even at high doses. In animal studies, fluid resuscitation with HES-DFO does not significantly improve central hemodynamic recovery beyond that observed with HES, but HES-DFO seems to afford better protection of microcirculation in organs at risk (lung, liver and gut), possibly by decreasing neutrophil sequestration. In a burn model, total fluid requirements are lower and oxygen utilization higher in HES-DFO treated animals compared to HES controls, suggesting decreased vascular leak and improved tissue perfusion. Conclusion: HES-DFO represents a means by which potent antioxidant protection can be administered at resuscitation. Iron has been suggested to play a pivotal role in oxygen flee radical mediated tissue injury. In vitro experiments indicated its critical role as a katalyst in hydroxyl free radical generation 0Fenton-reaction). Since iron chelator deferoxamine administered in shock alone demonstrated severe side effects, a hydroxyethylstarch (HES)daferoxamine (DFO)-conjugute was used to modulate oxygen free radical injury during the ischemia/reperfi~ion syndrome induced by hemorrhagic shock. Methods. Female LEWIS rats (190-215 g, n>6; pentobarbital anesthesia 50 mgjkg), in hemorrhagic shock ( The aim of the study was to elucidate (1) whether the generation of OR would affect lung and kidneys as primary shock organs in the very early phase of sepsis and (2) whether DFO-HES could prevent this tissue damage. Methods: In 67 rats sepsis was induced by cecal ligation puncture (CLP) peritonitis. The animals were randomly assessed to 2 groups: one group was treated with 3 ml DFO-HES (100 mg/kg iv), the other rats received solely 3 ml of the carrier starch solution. 30, 60, 120, and 240 min after induction of sepsis respectively, the animals were sacrificed, the organs collected, and tissue contents of glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and conjugated dienes (CD) determined. Plasma samples were obtained for analyses of endotoxin (chromogenic LAL test). Blood pressure (MAP) was measured via a carotid artery catheter. Results: CLP caused sepsis with high (> 1.84 EU/ml) endotoxin levels. MAP in both groups decreased slightly but significantly during sepsis regardless any treatment. In the lungs MPO concentration was increased (p<0.05) in the lIES group already 30 min after sepsis induction. Concomitantly, tissue GSH level decreased and lipid peroxidation was pronounced as shown by elevated MDA and CD levels. DFO-HES diminished tissue PMN accumulation and MPO concentration. Moreover, at each time point lung MDA and CD levels were lower (p<0.02). Histomorphological examination showed marked micro-atelectases, destruction of the alveolar septa, and splicing of the basal membranes in the lIES group. In contrast, in DFO-HES treated rats the alveoli remained well-ventiIated and only some enlarged reticular fibers without splicing were observed. Almost similar results were found for the kidneys. MPO levels differed neither within nor between both groups. The slight decrease in GSH levels seen after 60 min in the DFO-HES group seems to demonstrate an oxidative stress to a lesser degree. The most impressive effect of iron chelation, however, was revealed by the lipid peroxidation products. At each time point, MDA and CD levels were lower (p<0.02) compared to the HES group. Light and electron microscopic examination disclosed tubulotoxic and mitochondriat damages while DFO-HES lxeatment prevented that alterations. Conclusion: Both the biochemical and histological results of this study reveal an early and remarkable generation of OR in peritonitis-induced sepsis. Thereby, these OR obviously cause pulmonary and renal tissue damages, intravenous application of DFO-HES may, however, benefit by preventing early lipid peroxidation of the tissue.

Erythropoietin (EPO) was hypothesized to exist in the early 20th century, however the protein was not isolaled until 1977. The human gene was identified and cloned in 1983, which permitted the production of EPO through recombinant techniques. The earliest clinical trials were performed in anemic end-stage renal failure palients on hemodialysis. Treated patients experienced increases in erythropoiesis with normalization of hematocrit and hemoglobin levels, cessation of lrans-fusion requirements and improvement in general wellbeing. These studies, however, identified side effects of EPO treatment such as hypertension, seizures and Ee deficiency. Volunteer trials have established that the hypertension is not a direct pressor effect but rather the result of abnormally rapid increases in red cell mass in the face of the incompetent volume-controlling mechanisms of the end stage renal failure patient. Lower doses of EPO and the subsequent gradual increases in red cell mass are associated with significantly lower incidences of hypertensive complications of EPO therapy. Likewise, seizure activity is not the result of a direct epileptogenie effect but parallels the incidence of hyper-tensive-related sequelae during high.dose EPO treatment. In cross-over designed studies, pre-existing iron deficiency has been demonstrated to decrease or negate stimulated erythropoiesis but effective-hess can be restored with appropriate Fe supplementation. Exogenous EPO is effective whether given by IV or SQ routes and dose response curves do not vary with route of administration. Increases in RBC mass are directly related to the dose of EPO, both in amount and frequency of administration although there is a 3-5 day time lag between the first EPO dose and laboratory indications of its action (i.e. increase in the number of reticulceytes in peripheral Wood). EPO is currently labelled for use in the treatment of anemias associated with end-stage renal disease and AIDS. However, its use in the surgical population has been explored because of its unique direct dose-response, EPO has been used to effectively increase the blood harvest amounls in autologous pre-donation, significantly increase hematocrils in children following thermal trauma and successfully increase red blood cell mass following essential surgical procedures in patients with religious aversion to transfusion.",

            "text": "In conclusion these data indicate that allogeneic blood transfusions lead to a remarkable macrophage/RHS stimulation. This is corroborated by the boostered humoral IgG-response which was initiated before onset of surgical trauma and blood transfusion. Concerning CMI this caused a substancial suppression probably due to a stimulated secretion of immunosuppressive monokines. Objective: Firstly, to analyse the concentrations of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNc), interleukin-1 (IL-I), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and coagulatioo/fibrinolysis parameters in postoperatively retrieved blood from a surgical area, secondly to characterize the correspanding cytokine patters in the patients and thirdly to study cytokine concentrations in the initial portion of drainage blood from a surgical area. Materials and Methods: Blood retrieval was performed in a closed-loop system without anticoagulant during 4-6 hours after surgery in 10 patients undergoing arthroplasty (9 hips and 1 knee). 7KF, IL-1, It-6, thrembin-antithrombin complexes (TAC) and antithrombin (AT) ~ere determined in shed blood. Patient plasma TN v, IL-I and IL-6 concentrations ~ere analysed at the beginnLqg and end of the 4-6 hour blood retrieval period. In a separate study (5 hip arthroplasties) f~F, IL-I and IL-6 ~ere determined in the initial portion of drainage blood. Cytekine analyses ~re performed usiog ipmuooassays. An omidolytic method was used for AT determinaf.ion and TAC was analysed by ELISA. N~n-poram~tric tests was used for the statistical comparison. Results: The patient plasma IL-6 coocemtratiems rose from a median value of 0 to 116 pg/ml, p<O.01, during the blood ret.rieval period. IN c was detectable in 4 patients, range:15-50 pg/ml. IL-I was not detectable in the patients. In retrieved blood TAG was >200 mg/ml in all samples (ref:<4.1 mg/ml) and AT was 0. 16-0.51 units/ml (ref:O.80-1.20) . The IL-6 concentrations in retrieved blood was >1000 pg/ml in all samples. TN v or IL-I was not detectable. In the separate study, (n=5), characterlzing eytokine content in the initial portiere of drainage blood, IN= (range: 11-277 pg/ml) and IL-I (range:5-125 pg/ml) ~re present in all samples but II-6 (range:O-25 pg/ml) was detectable in o.qly one semple. Conclusion: Theses findings indicate that hypereoagulability and hic~ ccrcentratioos are present in retrieved blood. The cytokine pattern in the initial portion of blood from a surgical area differed from these observed in retrieved blood and in the systemic circulation. To identify the role of both autOlogous and homologous blood on postoperative infections in elective cancer surgery. Materials and methods: 159 patients with colo-rectal cancer submitted to curative elective surgery were prospectively studied. On hospital admission the following nutritional measurements were assessed: serum level of albumin, cholinesterase, delayed hypersensivity response , total lymphocyte count and weight loss, as were age and sex, Duration of operation , operative blood loss, amount and type of blood given, pathological Dukes' stage of the disease and the attending surgeon were also recorded. Results : Eighty-four patients (52.8%) were perioperatively transfused. Thirty-six (42.8%) patients were given autologous blood , while 48 (57.2%) received homologous blood. No patients received both autologous and homologous blood. Twenty eight (17.9%) patients developed postoperative infections. Non transfused patients had a 9.3 % infection rate , those receiving autologous blood had a 13.9 % infection rate, whi]e in the homologous blood group the infection rate was 33.3% (p < 0.001). Univariate analysis showed that infections were significantly related to operative blood loss (p<0.01), length of operation (p<0.05) blood transfusion (p<0.05) and attending surgeon (p<0.05) . Multivariate analysis identified homologous blood transfusion as the only variable related to the occurrence of postoperative infections , while the other variables failed to reach statistical significance. Blood transfusion (BT) remains an essential life-saving treatment for surgical patients. However, besides the beneficial short-term impacts, negative longer-term effects are observed, which include various alterations in the immune responsiveness. In surgical patients these alterations may contribute to the increased risk for infections and cancer recurrence. Since relatively few data demonstrate immunologic changes occurring in other lymphoid compartments than blood after BT, we studied the effect of ET on the frequency and responsiveness of immune cells in bone marrow (BM), spleen (SPL) and blood (B) in a rat model. Normovalemic, 2 month old rats were transfused intravenously with syngeneic heparinized venous blood (3x2ml, every other day), and 3, 7 and 14 days after the last transfusion BM cells ( LEH is an experimental oxygen-carrying resuscitation fluid. Since LEH is cleared from the circulation primarily by the MPS, its effect on the development of sepsis and the nature of its relationship with the MPS remain a major concern. Preliminary in vivo data from our laboratory failed to show any LEH effect on the hemodynamic and hematologic responses to endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the rat. In contrast, LEH exacerbated the LPS-induced TNFa production and early mortality. The exacerbation of early mortality by LEH was attenuated by pretreatment with the TNFu synthesis inhibitor rolipram. Ex vivo, peritoneal macrophages from rats treated with LEH and LPS have shown increased IL-lg mRNA signal as compared to LPS alone. Also, LEH increased TNFtx production by peritoneal macrophages in response to LPS stimulation in vitro. Additionally, recent pilot studies indicate that LEH attenuates PMA-induced superoxide production from rat peritoneal macrophages and that LEH augments fMLP-induced migration of human monocytes. Taken together, these data strongly support possible interactions of LEH with the MPS and therefore the nature of such interactions should be further explored. Over the last decade, we have developed liposome encapsulated hemoglobin (LEH) as an artificial oxygen carrying fluid, or blood substitute. Our efforts have focused on studies to define the safety and efficacy of this resuscitative solutions. LEH consists of distearoyl phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, dimyristoyl phosphatidylglyeerol, and alpha tocopherol in a 10:9:0.9:0.1 mole ratio and can encapsulate hemoglobins of different origin (bovine, human, recombinant human). LEH is fabricated using hydrodynamic shear to create an average particle size of 0.3 microns. LEH can be lyophilized using disaccharides and stabilized in the dry state and easily reconstituted before administration. Histopathology and clinical chemistries indicate that LEH rapidly accumulates in tissue resident macrophages in small animals injected in the tail vein, principaI1y in the liver and spleen. The consequences of accumulation in the reticuloendothelial system are manifest by transient increases in liver transaminases (AST, ALT), bilirubin, and BUN over 24-48 hours with no change in biliary function (GGT, aP) . Clearance through the liver and spleen is observed over the course of 1-2-weeks. More recent attention has been focused on secondary consequences of LEH administration especially with regard to inflammatory eytokines. LEH does not elicit expression of tumor necrosis factor in vivo and in isolated macrophage cultures, but does result in a transient increase in serum IL-6. We have also examined the interaction of LEH with LPS in vitro macrophage culture to further understand how this blood substitute may effect the immune system. We have labeled LEH with technetium-99m (99mTc) to study the biodistribution of LEH non-invasively in anesthetized rabbits. Rabbits were infused with a 25% topload of LEH (200 mg of phospholipid, 2.5 g of hemoglobin per kg of body weight) and imaged continuously with a gamma camera. At 20 hours, images were again acquired. Animals were then sacrificed and tissue counts obtained, images revealed an initial rapid uptake bythe liver, 8% at 30 minutes and 15% by 2 hours. The spleen accumulated activity at a slower rate, 3% at 30 minutes and 7% at 2 hours. At 20 hours, autopsy biodistribution studies revealed that approximately 42.6% of the dose is in the blood pool, 15.4% in liver, 18.1% in spleen, 3.2% in lungs, 2.4% in muscle and 1.6% in urine, with trace levels in kidney, brain and heart (<1 \u00b0/o). In a hypovolemic model, rats were 10% or 50% exchange transfused with 99mTc-LEH. In the 10% exchange model, 99mTc-LEH was rapidly taken up by the liver and spleen with minimal activity in the circulation at 20 hours. With the 50% exchange, 50% of the LEH was in circulation at 20 hours.",

Moreover, the LEH originally produced as a solution can be transformed into a lyophilized form which can be reconstituted and delivered as a fresh solution.

Most notably, the long term consequences of LEH on host defense mechanisms and, in particular, immune cell function. In addition, it is important to understand more fully the metabolic fate and repercussions of LEH delivered at clinically relevant dose/schedule regimens. Finally, while LEH is a highly promising strategy for a blood substitute, the present formulations consist of human hemoglobin derived from human blood, To improve the safety profile, a recombinant preparation for liposome entrapment will be much desired, Aa-ginine, a semi-essendai dietary amino acid, possesses several unique and potentially pharmacologic properties.

In addition these changes in PUFA will after the physical characteristics of the membrane including flujdity, receptor function and transmembrane signals. Animal studies have shown that there is omega-3 incorporation with continuou~ enteral feeding both in control and endotoxic animals within 3 days. This includes the liver, spleen, circulating and alveolar marc0phages and the lung. This incorporation resuls in significant changes in the eicosan0id production including PGF 2 and ket0-PGFlalpha.

The incubation with the enteral diet in vitro was followed by a higher dose-related rate of phagocytosis, especially in the healthy group, that was not statistically significant. After addition of L-Argintne we atso observed an iqcrease in phagocytosis, that was lower than in the group with the complete diet. Using a modern immunefluorescence-cytometric essay we founfl an improved phagocytic function in septic shosk. There are signs for an influence of nutrient substrates on phagocytosis which seems to be complex and should be further investigated. ARG and GLN were lower in the 49%-BCAA vs 16%-BCAA group; ARG was related directly to ARG dose and inversely to BCAA dose (p<O.O01 for all).",

Relationships between ARG, GLN and other AA seem to be ruled by patterns involving specific intracellular AA transport systems. Regulation of ARG and GLN clearances through BCAA administration may be related to an increased flux of AA into synthetic processes. Intestinal segments from rats immunized by infection with the nematode Trichinella spiruUs undergo intestinal anaphylaxis or type I hypersensitivity when challenged in vitro with parasite antigen. Immunized rats exposed to T-radiation (7Gy) and sustained on rat chow,fail to fully express type I hypersensitivity up to 14 Days Post Irradiation (DPI). We hypothesized that enteral nutritional support immediately following irradiation may be effective in preserving mucosal immune responsiveness or in reducing the recovery time after radiation-induced injury. Rats were infected with 3x103 T.spiralis larvae. Thirty to fifty days later rats received 7Gy T-radiation from a Co source as total abdominal irradiation (TAI). Immediately following TAI, rats were fed an elemental amino acid diet (EAAD) and at various DPI sacrificed and tested in Ussing chambers for local anaphylaxis, expressed as antigen-induced CI secretion. The normal CI secretory response to antigenic challenge which is suppressed after irradiation,was restored by 3 DPI when rats were placed on the EAAD. Antigen-induced C[ secretion is dependent on the interaction o~ antigen with specific IgE antibodies on the surface o5 mucosal mast cells and their subsequent degranulation. Mast cell-derived 5-HT,histamine and PG, together effect CI secretion.In irradiated rats on rat chow,the failure to respond to antigenic challenge appears to be associated with the destruction of mast cells. They are undetectable with standard staining procedures and mucosal histamine levels are drastically reduced. Also,el secretion can be induced by direct stimulation of epithelium with cr secrctagogues and circulating IgE levels are normal. Despite a more rapid recovery of immune responsiveness in irradiated rats receiving EAAD,mast cells were not restored. We conclude that the EAAD contributes to an adaptation that supports the expression of local anaphylaxis in the absence of mast cells. Total parenteral nutrition (PN) and bowel rest may influence the host response to infection. This study examined the different host response to infection in parenterally and enterally fed animals. Forty-three rats were divided into PN group and total enteral nutrition (EN) group. They received identically constituted isocaloric isonitxogenous diets for seven days. Animals were then challenged intraperitoneaUy with 3xl(Y Escherichia Coli and survival were observed. In other experiments, they were sacrificed before and two hours after bacterial challenge. Peritoneal cavity was lavaged with 10ml saline and peritoneal exudative cells (PEC) were harvested and cultured in vitro for 24 hours with and without lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Colony f(m, ning units of bacteria (CFU-b) in the peritoncal lavaged fluid (PLF) were determined and TNF in the PLF, serum and PEC culture supernal,ants were measured by L929 bioassay.",

However, for the group of rats maintained on SO diet, the liver membrane phospholipid fatty acid composition before and after LPS administration was unaltered. These finding suggest that although a reduction in AA was associated with a decrease in the production of pro inflammatory eicosanoids after 5 days of continuous MO feeding, there was no marked effect on the survival following LPS challenge. Animal models have been used to examine the effects of various nutrients and nutrient combinations upon the immune system. We studied the effects of standard and specialized enteral formulations on the response of mice to infectious challenge with Listeria monocytogenes, Influenza A or Candida albicans in order to test the efficacy of specialized ingredients.

Deasoness Hosp.,Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA] Stress causes alterations in the homeostasis of an organism with major changes in various organs, lifespans of cells, protein turnovers, metabolic pathways of activation or stimulation, energy mobilization, etc. Punctual changes have been described in several organs and various cell types of the nervous, endocrine and immune systems. Many stored or newly synthesized proteins are released to the bloodstream to be transported to target organs or to be disposed of. As stress alters protein synthesis and requirements in the targets, the bloodstream is a useful system for monitoring the relevant changes. We present here the pattern of newly synthesized or released serum proteins in C57BL/6 mice that have been stressed by immobilization. The proteins have been labelled with 3sSmethionine in vivo and the study was performed by two dimensional gel electrophoresis based on the method originally described by O'Farrel. The electrophoretic run was carried out in an ISODALT apparatus. A Molecular Dynamics laser scanner and the Kepler Image Analysis System (LSB, Rockville, USA) were used for modelling the radiofluorographic images. The radiofluorographic images of the gels from serum samples obtained from mice injected with I mCi of 3SS-methionine reveal about 440 protein spots, from which a small fraction -about 20are altered in both qualitative and quantitative manner. The major changes are in the range of 25 to 60.000 d. The analysis displays a highly reproducible pattern, where clear differences between stressed and non-stressed conditions are shown. Differences between patterns attributed to chronic vs. acute stress will be presented. Patients with severe trauma or major surgery are known to acquire alterations in neutrophil functions which contribute to their enhanced susceptibility towards microbial infections. We analyzed neutrophil functions from fourty patients admitted for major surgery 6 days and 1 days preoperatively and on the ist and 6th postoperative days (study-days i, 2, 3, and 4) in a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study. Patients were divided into two groups, one ~eceived 6 days preoperatively an enteral nutrition enriched with omega-3 fatty acids, arginiee, and RNA (IMPACT), the other an isocaloric, not enriched control nutrition (placebo). Meutrophils were isolated from the peripheral blood and stimulated with the Ca-ionophor A23187 (7.3 pM). The capacity of the respective neutrophils to generate leukotrienes was analyzed by RP-HPLC. Neutrophils from IMPACT group generated significantly higher amounts of LTB5 (mean values 6.6 ng/l x i~ cells) compared to the placebo group (2.6 ng) at study-day 2 [p, 0.01). In contrast, the capacity of neutrophils to produce LTB4 was not significantly different in both patients populations at study-days 2 and 3. The omega-oxidation of LTB4 to its biologically less active metabolites OH-LTB4 and COOH-LTB4 was not significantly different in both groups. However, neutrophils from group F patients generate more LTC4 at study-day 2 (p(0/5). The capacity of the patients'neutrophils to generate reactive oxygen radicals upon stimulation with fMLP, PMA or the Caionopbore A23187 exhibited patient dependent differences but no correlations to the repective nutritional supplementation as was measured by luminol dependent ohemiluminescense= These data indicate that an enteral nutrition enriched in omega-3 fatty acids lead to alterations in distinct parameters of neutrophil functions. Clinical patient characteristics and mean caloric intake were similar between the two groups. Both formula were tolerated well and the incidence of diarrhea was low. The number of infectious and wound complications as well as the APACHE II score was evaluated for the two study groups.",

In this animal study with 18 male Wistar-rats we tested the hypothesis that glutamine-dipeptide supplementation during TPN for 10 days would restore small bowel atrophy and TPN induced dysfunction. A conventional TPN solution (250 Kcai/kg bw) was compared to an isocaloric and isonitrogenous TPN (0,5 g N/animal/d) supplemented with alanin-glutamin (Ala-GIn) dipeptide (0,15 g N derived from Ala-GIn =30% GIn-N). An enteral fed cqntrol group was included. Mucosal thickness, villous height and architecture, absorption of water and glucose as well as dissacharidase activity of maltase and alkaline phosphatase were evaluated. Total parenteral nutrition in rats causes villous atrophy, a significantly reduced absorption rate and a decreased activity of villous enzymes compared to an enteral fed control (p<O,01). Addition of Ala-GIn to parenteral nutrition solutions prevents intestinal atrophy and restores functional alterations with a significantly increased rate of water and glucose absorption as well as a higher dissacharidase activity compared to the standard TPN group (p<0,01). There was no significant difference found between the enteral fed control and the dipeptide supplemented animals concerning intestinal structure and absorption, The enzyme activity was significantly decreased in the Ala-GIn supplemented group compared to the enteral fed control (p<0,01).

Substrate oxidation rate, energy expenditure as well as short life proteins were measured daily. Six patients were excluded from analysis as drop outs, due to surgical complications. We could find a dose-dependend effect of growth hormone on resting energy expenditure, carbohydrate oxidation, fat and proteine oxidation. With increasing growth hormone resting energy expenditure increased from 20.9 calories per kg body weight to 26.6 calories. This was mainly due to an increased carbohydrate and fat oxidation, while proteine oxidation decreased. This was in accordance with a decreased urea.production rate and an improvement in cumulative nitrogene balance, which increased from minus 12.7 to plus 8.5 g N / 7 days.

During the 2-week study clinical parameters did not differ significantly between groups; however, there was a tendency for increased glucose levels, insulin need, and energy expenditure at the time of test B in the GH group. Leucine oxidation (X+SE) during test A;B was 117+10; 111+15 (CO) and 110+7; 100\u00b112 (GH) pMol/kg FFM/h (n.s.). Protein breakdown was 134\u00b116; 131+30 (CO) and 156+14; 178+30 (GH) pMol/kg FFM/h (n.s.). Nonoxidative-leuine disposal was 119\u00b19; 127+16 (CO) and 139\u00b111; 177+20 (GH) pMol/kg FFM/h (p<0.05 for the rise in the GH group). Tracer data were supported by cumulative urea nitrogen excretion (days 1-4: GH 52+3 vs CO 66\u00b17 g; p<0.05). We conclude that after major abdominal surgery GH lowers nitrogen excretion by increasing total body protein synthesis. It is not known which organs contribute to this effect. In several investigations it has been shown that the protein saving effect of recombinant human Growth Hormone (rhGH) in the postoperative state is accompanied by raised IGF-1 levels in plasma. It was concluded that the anabolic effects of rhGH were probably, at least in part, mediated by IGF-1. This study was aimed at detecting the efficacy of IGF-I on modulation of the protein metabolism in the catabolic state.",

All patients received hypocaloric and hyponitrogenous total parenteral nutrition (3g CHNg, O.6g AA/kg) troughout the whole study period. Cumulated nitrogen balance, 3-methyl-histidin exretion in urine as well as Serum-IGF-1 levels have been determined. The two tailed Wilcoxon test was used for statistical analysis Results: first results will be presented Previous studies have suggested that growth hormone (GH) potentiates various activities of leukecytes. However, it is not clear whether GH can improve survival of animals with gram-negative sepsis. We investigated the effects of GH on host response to infection in septic mice model. METHODS BALB]c mice were randomized to 3 groups (n=10/gronp): GH-high (4+8mg/kg/day), GH-Iow (0A8mg/kg/day) or control (saline). Following subcutaneous treatment (every 8 hours for 6 days) with GH or saline, mice were challenged i.p. with E.coli (lxl08/body). Survival rate was recorded every 2 hours. In the next experiment, GH-high and control animals were sacrificed 4 hours after bacterial challenge. Peritoneal cavity was lavaged with 3ml saline and the peritoneal exudative cells (PEC) were harvested and counted. Colony forming units (CFU) of bacteria in the peritoneal lavaged fluid (PLF), liver, lung and blood were determined. PEC were cultured in vitro for 24 hours with lipopolymccharide (10p.g/ml In normotensive adults growth hormone (GH) rises when clonidine challenge is performed. Recently evidence was shown for GH to accelerate wound healing. While GH secretion patterns are inconstant the GH-dependant insulin like growth factor (IGF-1) and the insulin like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP-3) reflect the integrated GH secretion over days. Since we administer clonidine to patients with acute alcohol abuse we determined plasma levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3. Materials and methods: 21 patients sheduled for esophagus resection were investigated once they had given written informed consent. 8 patients showed acute alcohol abuse and were treated with clonidine postoperatively\u2022 13 Patients with no history of acute alcohol abuse served as controls.

Further studies are required to discriminate whether our results are due to impaired postoperative liver function or if clonidine has not any impact on the GH-IGF-axis in patients with alcohol abuse. Recent studies have revealed that IGF-I has several immanoregulatory roles. However, little is known about its effects on septic animals. We tested whether IGF-I could increase the survival O f mice challenged intraperitoneally (i.p.) with E. coli. M~THQD$ BALB/c mice received either high dose IGF-I (n=10, 24mg/kg/day), low dose IGF-I (n=10, 2.4mg/kg/day) or saline (11=10) every eight hours subcutaneously for six days. Animals were then challenged i.p. with lx108 E. coli. Survival was observed every two hours. In the other experiment, mice that received high dose IGF-I or saline were sacrificed four hours after bacterial challenge. Peritoneal cavity was lavaged with 3ml saline and the peritoneal exudative ceils (PEC) were harvested and counted. Colony forming units (CFU) of bacteria in the peritoneal lavaged fluid (PLF), liver, lung and blood were determined. In addition, PEC were cultured/n vitro for 24 hours with lipopolysaccharide (10).tg/ml). Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the supernatants of PEC culture, PLF and serum were measured by L929 bioassay. RESULTS IGF-I improved the survival rate at a dose of 24mg/kg/day. Severe chronic neutropenia (SCN) is a disorder characterized by severe neutropenia secondary to either a maturational arrest of myelopoiesis at the level of promyelocytes (Kostmann-Syndrome; SCN) or regular cyclic fluctuations in the number of blood neutrophils with a median absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of less than 500/~tl (cyclic neutropenia). Patients suffering from SCN have an impaired acute inflammatory response to injury and an increased susceptibility to infections, i.e. bacterial or fungal infections, resulting in chronic oral inflammation, severe pneumonia, abscess formation and bacteraemia. We have treated 36 patients (32 SCN, 4 cyclic neutropenia) with r-metHuG-CSF (filgrastim). Thirty of 32 patients with SCN and all 4 cyclic neutropenia patients responded to this treatment with an increase of the median ANC to greater than 1000/~tl. The dose of r-metHuG-CSF needed to achieve and maintain the response varied between 0.8 and 120 ~tg/kg/d. Long-term treatment did not exhaust myelopoiesis: the ANC remained stable after up to 6 years of treatment and antibodies to r-metHuG-CSF were not detected. The increase of ANC was associated with dramatic clinical responses: significant reduction of severe bacterial infections, reduction of intravenous antibiotic treatment, and reduction of hospitalizations. No severe bacterial infections occurred in any of the r-rnetHuG-CSF responders during longterm treatment. Severe adverse events, most likely due to the underlying disease, included the development of MDS/Leukemia in two patients, and osteopenia/osteoporosis in 12 patients. These results demonstrate the beneficial effects of r-metHuG-CSF treatment in severe chronic neutropenia patients. The newborn is predisposed to mortality during infections due in large part to developmentally immature host defenses. Recently cytokines have been identified that regulate the development of these defenses. One such cytokine is specific for neutrophils and is termed granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). In the studies to be discussed, we have attempted to impact hematopoiesis in the fetus using exogenous rhG-CSF delivered through the pregnant dam. Our rationale was that an enhanced myeloid system may result from such in utero treatment leading to, perhaps, enhanced protection to microbial insult. RhG-CSF crossed the placenta and reached peak fetal serum concentrations 4 hours after administration. These levels were 1000-fold lower than the levels detected in the adult dams serum. White blood cell counts were elevated approximately 2-4-fold over control newborn blood. This increase was due to circulating numbers of neutrophils. The marrows from these pups were hyperplastic consisting of predominately immature and mature neutrophilic cells. No changes were seen in the thymus or livers. Pups born to mothers treated with rhG-CSF since day 15 of gestation (parturition in rodents occurs on approximately day 21) survived a lethal challenge of group B-13 hemolytic Streptococcus. In contrast their untreated yet infected counterparts did not survive. Recent clinical developments have led to trials of rhG-CSF in certain neutropenic states including cyclic and chronic neutropenia. We have identified several of these patients who were pregnant during treatment with rhG-CSF. Biologically and anfigenically identifiable rhG-CSF was detected at increased levels in the cord serum of these neonates. We will discuss our findings with these patients in light of our animal model of neonatal myeloid development. We have previously demonstrated decreased G-CSF production and G-CSF mRNA expression from activated mononuclear cells from newboms compared to adults (Cairo, Pediatr Res 31:574, 1992) . We have also recently observed that administration of a single dose of rhG-CSE to one-day-old newborn rats induced significant neatrophilia, while administration for 7 days induced neulrophilia and increased the bone marrow (BM) neutrophil storage and progenitor pools (Cairo, Blood 76:1788 , 1990 Cairo, Pediatr Res 27:612, 1990) . We embarked on a phase I trial exploring the safety, pharmacokinetics, and biological efficacy of G-CSF in newborns with presumed sepsis. 42 infants <72 hrs old with a diagnosis of presumed sepsis were stratified into three groups: very preterm (26-30 wk), preterm (31-35 wk), and term (>36 wk) and randomized to receive either a placebo or 1, 5, and 10 gg/kg/qd or 5 and 10 p.g/kg/bid of rhG-CSF infused by pump over 1 hour for 3 consecutive days. CBCs were obtained at 2, 6, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hrs. Tibial bone marrow aspirations were performed 72 hrs after study entry and differential counts and CFU-GM pools were determined. C3bi expression was determined at 0 and 24 hrs after rhG-CSF, and G-CSF pharmacokinetics were performed after the first dose of rhG-CSF utilizing a sandwich ELISA. A significant increase in the ANC was observed at 48, 72 and 96 hrs following administration of both 5 and 10 ~tg/kg/d of rhG-CSF. The maximum increase in the ANC occurred 72 hrs after 5 and 10 ~tg/kg/d (397 -116%) (p<0.01) and (621% -+ 200%) (p<0.001), respectively. There was a significant dose-dapendeat increase in the BM neutrophil storage pool (18 _+ 4% vs. 62 + 6%) (p<0.01) (placebo vs. 10 ~tg/kg/d). There was no significant difference in the nantrophil proliferative pool. An increase in CFU-GM and CFU-GEMM was seen at all doses tested, compared to placebo (53.5 _+ 8.6 vs. 87 -+ 15) (colonies/l(P cells/plate). C3bi expression was significantly increased 24 hrs after 10 Bg/kg/d of rhG-CSF (233 + 81% vs. 83 +-26%) (p<0.012). Peak serum G-CSF levels occurred at 2 hrs and were dosedependent. The half-life of rhG-CSE was 4.44 + 0.4 hrs. Most importantly, there was no observed toxicity from G-CSF in all patients studied. 31 of 42 patients were on ventilators prior to administration of rhG-CSF and there was no increase in pulmonary toxicity. These preliminary data suggest that rhG-CSF is well tolerated at all gestational ages in newborns with presumed sepsis. A multi-center phase II/III randomized double-blindad placebo controlled trial is required to determine the efficacy of rhG-CSF in this clinical setting. ",

The use of G-CSF in sepsis prophylaxis in neutropenic patients is well established and has been ascribed to accelerated recovery in granulccyte counts. Here, an additional sepsis-prophylactic property could be demonstrated in healthy volunteers: Eleven volunteers were employed in a sinqle-bTind, controlled study and were given 480 uq G-CSF or saline placebo via subcutaneous injection. Blood was withdrawn immediately before and 20 or 44 hours later. LPS-inducible TNF, IL-1, sTNF-R p75 and IL-lra were assessed in the supernatant of whole blood incubations stimulated with 10 ug/ml LPS from Salmonella abortus equi. Similarly to previous animal studies, LPS-inducible TNF was attenuated by about 50% 20 hrs. after treatment. The same was true of IL-lb. In contrast, LPS-inducible sTNF-R p75 which was indetectable in blood incubations from untreated donors increased dramatically 44 hrs. after G-CSF treatment. IL-lra found after LPS challenge was increased tenfold by G-CSF treatment. It is concluded that G-CSF treatment switches peripheral leukocytes to an antiinflammatery state characterized by an attenuation of IL-I and TNF releasing capacity and an augmentation of the release of cytokine antagonists. This findinq minht offer a novel concept in septic shock prophylaxis. Objective.The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of recombinant human G-CSF (rhG-CSF) on survival, bone marrow neutrophil myelopoiesis, neutrophil counts, levels of bacteria and some important sepsis mediators in a model of rat abdominal sepsis.",

            "text": "These data demonstrate the proinflammatory capacity of GM-CSF and suggest that the hemopoietic cytokine plays also a role as an endogenous modulator of LPS toxicity. Immune dysfunction, developing in the wake of multiple trauma, overwhelming infection and other forms of critical surgical illnes% is associated with increased infections, morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms responsible for alterations in immune regulation are incompletely understood but monocyte appear to play a central role. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are known to play a central role in the inflammatory response of the host toward invading microrganisms. Reports of defects in all the aspeots of PMN function have been accumulated in recent years. The possible role of GM-CSF in modifing the state of immuno suppression detected in severe intraabdominal infected pt~. inspite of surgical appropriate procedures and in reducing the expected mortality is investigated. The safety of rh-GM-CSF administration in sepsis is also evaluated. A double blind randomized study is proposed. This study include 60 ICU patients who do not exhibit signs of shock and/or ARDS, with clinical signs and symptoms of abdominal infection. Immunodepressed patients-AIDS, Chronic chemotherapy or chronic steroid administration do not partecipate to the study. Patients will receive rGM-CSF (l~g/Kg/day) or placebo in 24 hs. continuous infusion for 15 days. SafetyandefYieacy will be assessed till to Day 30. The APACHE II Score is adopted for risk stratification of patients because it is reliable and validated, objective and composed of information that is indipendent of diagnostic criteria. Patient's entry criteria is APACHE II > 16 (Score 16 corresponds to expected mortality rate of 38%).In this protocol the surgeons report the judgement of the efficacy of surgical procedure to remove or not the focus of infection. Objectives: Infections and subsequent septic responses remain the leading cause of death among surgical intensive care (SICU) patients despite tmprovetaunts in supportive care and brond-epectrum antibiotics. Usually invading bacteria are efficiently cleared by neutrophil granulocytes. However, during sepsis various neatrophil dysfunctions have been demonstrated, leading to impaired host defense. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) induces a sustained increase in circulating neutrophils and enhances various noutrophil functions. It was the purpose of the present study, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of G-CSF (filgrastim) in SICU patients at risk of sepsis. Materiel a.d Methods: The study was designed as an open-label phase-ll study of filgrastim. Ten consecutive SlCU patients, with a Therapeutic Interveotion Score greater than 30, were included in the study. Filgrastim was given by daily continuous intravenous infusion for 7 days or discharge from the SICU. APACHE ll-score, multiple-organ-failure (MOF) score, definitions of infections, sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and acute respiratory failure were applied daily. A response to filgrastinl th_erapy was defined as an improvement in disease severity quantified by a decrease of > 4 APACHE 1I score points on day 4 after onset of treatment. Results: None of the 10 patients developed a sepsis or MOF later on and no patient died during hospitalization. Specific postoperative complications occured in one patient ~Jth a leekage of the oesophagou-gastric anastomosis after oesophageus resection. At study entry the leucocytes amounted to 10.110 + 2.000/~tl (mean + SEM) and reached a level of 29.280 +_ 5.810/tal at day 6 after onset offilgrastim therapy. The APACHE II score initally was 14 + 1.57 (mean + SEM) and as an indicator of filgrastim response a decrease of 5 points ~dthin 4 days oceured in 7 out ot 10 patients. Filgrastim was well tolerated, side effects were not noted. Growth of solid tumors might be modulated by the activity of inflammatory and/or immune effector cells of undefined specificity. In this study patients undergoing surgical treatment for gastric (n= 41) or colorectal (n= 47) cancers were evaluated for endogenous serum levels of granulocyte colony-stimulatingfactor (G-CSF) during a pre-and postoperative time period. From the same blood specimens mononuelcar cells (MNC) were prepared. The release of IFN-%, and IL-2, which are secreted by Thl cells, were stimulated in vitro by PHA during a cell culture period up to 48 hours. The patients were further classified for their immunreactivity by responses in DTH skin testing to seven different antigens (e.g. tetanus toxoid, PPD, diphtheria toxin, trichophyton, streptococcus, candida and proteus antigens). DTH testing has been repeated in each patient Two remarkable results were obtained. The serum levels of endogenous G-CSE showed a biphasic increase with maximum values of 900 pg/ml (preoperative < 70 pg/ml) on day 1 and day 3 to 5 after surgical treatment. Similar patterns of G-CSF production were found in both groups of patients with gastric or colorectal cancers. High serum levels of G-CSF were significantly (p < 0,01) correlated with infectious complications in patients whh gastric cancer (n= 17/22). Secondly patients could be arranged into two groups according to an anergic (n= 25) or normergi\u00a2 (n = 63) responsiveness in DTH testing. The frequency of anergi\u00a2 responsiveness was similar in both patients with gastric (n= 11/41) or colorectal (n= 14/47) cancers. Interestingly we found a significant correlation (p < 0,01) between low serum levels of G-CSF and anergy during the postoperative period in both groups. Stimulation of MNCs from anergic patients (n= 30) within the pre-and postoperative period resulted in reduced mean values (about 50%) for IFN-ff release (preoperative means llO0 pg/nfl), if compared to patients with normergic DTH (n= 63, preoperative means 1960 pg/ml). Similar, but less significant results were obtained for IL-2 secretion. Our results confirm a correlation between infectious complications and G-CSF in the postoperative period, however elevated levels were also found in some patients without any signs of infections. More interestingly there might be an association between cytokine (C~CSF, IFN-% and IL-2) release and DTH, which is known to be mediated by activated Thl calls. To recognize anergic DTH as a possible higher risk in the postoperative outcome of cancer patients extended periods of observation are needed.

GM-CSF was given subcutaneously at a dally dose of 2 to 5 mcg/kg/day, according to renal function. Results : In all cases, neutrophil counts returned to normal levels within 1 to 4 days. In most of them, spectacular correction was observed within 24 hours, with a single injection. Adverse events due to GM-CSF at this dose were mild and easily managed (2 cases of bone pain treated with paracetamol). One acute rejection episode was observed after correction of leukopenia.

            "text": "We measured serum immunoreactive interleukin 6 (IL-6) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) levels of the patients undergoing major thoraco-abdominal surgery for esophageal cancer. Serum samples were collected from eight patients on the day before surgery, at the time of operation, and thereafter at suitable intervals for one week. IL-6 and G-CSF were measured by means of enzyme linked immunoassay. The normal range of serum ]L-6 was less than 2 pg/ml and G-CSF less than 4 pg/ml. Values between groups were compared with linear regression analysis. Both serum G-CSF and IL-6 levels reached their maximal levels at the first postoperative day and decreased thereafter. The correlation between G-CSF (y) and IL-6 (x) was y=3.28x+6.16 (r=0.786, n=86, p<0.01 ), showing a significant correlation. In the case who suffered from aspiration pneumonia and ARDS at the second postoperative day, the peak level of IL-6 was 50 pg/ml and G-CSF 69 pg/ml respectively. The estimated value of G-CSF was 171 pg/mi by the regression equation. This means the real G-CSE level was less than half of the estimated value. It suggests that low responsiveness of G-CSF is one of the reason of immunodeficient state after the major surgery, Neutrophils from injured patients ingest and kill bacteria less efficiently as compared to those of healthy individuals, probably reflecting the suppression in respiratoly burst which occurs after severe trauma. One of the main mechanisms of killing bacteria by neutrophil granulocytes is production of oxygen radicals (respiratory burst). Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), a 20kilodalton cytokine, leads to a sustained, dose-dependent increase in circulating neutrophils. Thus, it was investigated whether filgrastim (recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, rhG-CSF) therapy fits for prophylaxis of sepsis in postoperative/posttraumatic patients, and whether, besides an expected increase in neutrophil count, filgrastim would also augment neutrophil function. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was designed as an open label, prospective phase II study of filgrastim and performed in a surgical intensive care unit (SICU) (university hospital). 10 postoperative/post-traumatic patients with a Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS) score greater than 30 were treated with filgrastim (0.5 -1 l.tg/kg/day) for prophylaxis of sepsis on 7 days or until discharge from the SICU. Production of oxygen radicals can be quantified by analysis of FMLP-and zymosan-induced chemiluminescence. Neutrophil oxygen radical production was tested by FMLP-and zymosan-induced chemiluminescence by the polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) of these patients in multiple blood samples over a period of up to 14 days. RESULTS: None of the patients treated with filgrastim for prophylaxis of sepsis developed sepsis. In vitro FMLP-induced (10 -7 reel/l) neutrophil oxygen radical production was significantly increased under therapy with filgrastim by a maximum of 797% +-570% (217% -1826%) compared to pretreatment values of 100%. Tapering of filgrastim resulted in a reduction of FMLP-induced neutrophil oxygen radical production within 48 hours. In contrast, zymosan-induced neutrophil oxygen radical production was not affected by filgrastim treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Besides its quantitative effect on neutrophil counts enhanced neutrophil function, documented here as increased FMLP-induced oxygen radical production, may account for the beneficial effect of filgrastim for prophylaxis of sepsis in posttraumatic/post-operative patients. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocytemacrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) have been recently introduced in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Effects of these CSFs on cellular immune system were evaluated in 38 neutropenic gynecological cancer patients during chemotherapy. G-CSF and GM-CSF were equally able to induce a rapid recovery of white cell count within one or two days. G-CSF treatment resulted in a significantly higher concentration of leukocytes measured in the peripheral blood although by GM-CSF a sufficient effect was achieved (p<0.05). Before initiation of CSF treatment urinary neopterin was similar in both groups of patients (283+/-38 and 267+/-40 lamol/mol creatinine for GM-CSF and G-CSF respectively expressed as mean +/-one SD). In G-CSF treated patient only a marginal induction of neopterin was observed. On day 4 the mean value was about 40% above the basal level (p<0.05). On the other hand GM-CSF treated patients were characterized by a pronounced increase in urinary neopterin levels. In comparison with the basal level a more than 2 fold induction was noted and the difference between G-CSF and GM-CSF was highly significant (p<0.01). This effect was confirmed in vitro by investigating the effects of these CSFs on interferon-gamma mediated pathways in THP-1 human myelomonocytic cells. Results suggest activation of immune effector cells by GM-CSF which may help the organism to overcome infections. However, activated macrophages produce several growth factors which may increase malignant proliferation, and augmented neopterin production as sign of macrophage activation has also been associated with poor prognosis m several malignancies. More data are therefore necessary to clarify whether CSF mediated immune activation is beneficial or deleterious for cancer patients but considering our results caution in applying CSFs in oncology seems advised. From a historical perspective, the development of humoral immunity to bacterial endotoxin has assumed a prominent position in the spectrum of therapeutic approaches which have been explored for the treatment of Gram negative septic shock. Predicated upon the fact that rough strains of bacteria manifest LPS containing exclusively conserved structural features common to LPS from all Gram negatives, specific antibodies were elicited which conveyed cross protective immunity in experimental models of bacteremia and endotoxemia.",

Nevertheless, the numerous successes which have been documented in experimental models of endotoxemia continue to foster promise for this immunotherapeutie approach. Several recent studies with human polyclonalimrnunoglobulin preparations containing antibodies reactive with LPS and lipid A have yielded promising results in treatment of patients with sepsis. In addition, the recent development of an antiidiotypic monoclonal antibody which reflects an internal image of a kDO specific monoclonal antibody has provided an alternative experimental approach to generate anti-LPS antibody. Immunization of mice with the antiidiotype provides significant protection against subsequent LPS lethality consistent with the development of circulating immunoglobulin specific for LPS. Thus, the use of polyclonal immunoglobulins contrives to provide an alternative and potentially cost effective method for the treatment of endotoxin shock. Supported by R37 A123447 and POt CA54474.",

Our approach has been to evaluate active immunization as a prophylax~s against sepsis. Mice were inoculated twice (two weeks apart) with liposomes containing DMPC[I.8], DMPG[0.2], cholesterol [1.5] , and monophosphoryl lipid A [20-200 gg/txmole phospholipid] by several routes (i.p., i.m.), and serum was collected 10-11 days after each inoculation. After a single injection, highest tilers of Ab were produced in mice inoculated i.p., but mice inoculated by all routes produced anti-lipid A Ab. Following the second injection. Ab levels were roughly equivalent in mice inoculated by all routes, regardless of lipid A concentration. Mice vaccinated i.p. with liposomes containing 0, 20 or 200 gg lipid A were treated with cyclophosphamide to produce neutroperda and then challenged with E. cole in an infection model of gram negative sepsis. The LDS0 for control (liposomes with no lipid A) mice was 3x10 bacteria; LD50 for mice vaccinated with 20p.g was 24x103 (8-fold increase in resistance) and with 200~tg was 48x103 bacteria (16-laid increase in resistance). Mice vaccinated as before were also treated with Actinomyein D to increase sensitivity to LPS (Salmonella minnesota) challenge in an endotoxemia model of grain negative sepsis. The LD50 for control (liposomes with no lipid A) mice was 30 ng LPS; the LD50 for 20gg lipid A was 70rig LPS (2-fold increase in resistance) and for 2001xg was 570ng LPS (19-fold increase in resistance). Mice were similarly vaccinated and challenged with an aggressive gram negative pathogen, Francfsella tularensis. The LD50 of FranciseUa in normal mice or mice inoculated with liposomes without lipid A was 20-40 bacteria. In contrast, mice vaccinated with liposomal lipid A (200ggl survived challenges as high as 30,000 bacteria, (3 logs of protection). The impressive protective capacity of this vaccine did not correlate with Ab Liter in any of the sepsis models, nor did it correlate with classic nonspeeific events, such as macrophage activation. Maerophages harvested from the peritoneum of mice vaccinated and protected against sequelae of gram negative infections did not spontaneously kill the bacteria in vitro, but could be activated by IFN-y for antimicrobial activity equivalent to that of macrophages from unt#eated mice. Research is underway to defme the protective mechanism(s) activated by this liposomal-Lipid A vaccine.",

            "text": "INTERVENTION BY MONOPHOSPHORYL LIPID A IN SEPTIC SHOCK Jon A. Rudbach, Ribi ImmunoChem Research, Inc., Hamilton, Montana, USA Monophosphoryl Lipid A (MLA), the clinical form of which is called MPL\u00ae-immunostimulant, has been tested extensively as an intervenient material in septic shock. MLA is protective when given to experimental animals prior to a live microbial challenge or challenge with lethal doses of microbial products or certain cytokines. This is shown with Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria, Gram negative bacterial endotoxins, and Gram positive bacterial exotoxins. Furthermore, animals treated with a regimen of MLA which results in a refractory state to a lethal dose of Gram negative bacterial endotoxin concomitantly display increased resistance to a live bacterial challenge. Thus, both endotoxin tolerance and nonspeciflc resistance to infection can be manifested simultaneously. Also, prophylactic doses of MLA do not interfere with other therapies given subsequently; an additive or a synergistic protective effect can be demonstrated with certain combinatorial treatment regimens, such as MLA followed by antiendotoxin monoclonal antibodies. The preclinical studies were extended to human trials wherein the safety of agonistic doses of MLA was verified. Furthermore, when MLA was administered to human volunteers 24 hr before challenge with a pharmacologically active dose of reference endotoxin, febrile, cardiac, TNF, IL-6, and IL-8 responses were all decreased significantly as compared with the responses of subjects pretreated with a control solution and challenged with endotoxin. Human trials with MLA are being extended into patient cohorts which have high probabilities of developing septic shock; this will expand the safety base and establish clinical efficacy for MPL\u00ae-immunostimulant. A considerable body of in vitro evidence supports the concept that the effects of LPS on cells of the immune/inflammatory systems are controlled by interactions of LPS with CD14. To evaluate if blocking LPS-CD14 interactions has potential as a therapeutic in septic shock we have evaluated the effect of anti-CDI4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) on LPS-induced cytokine production and physiologic changes in an experimental model of endotoxin shock performed in cynomolgus monkeys. A novel model has been established where animals were treated with interferongamma for three days prior to infusion of highly purified LPS over an eight hour period. In this model LPS challenge resulted in marked release of eytokines in the blood, substantial hemodynamic changes, release of liver enzymes and alteration in lung permeability observed over a 24 hour period. To evaluate the effect of treatment with anti-CD14 mAb, animals were given either nothing, an isotype control or anti-CD14 mAb (5mg/kg) 30 rains, prior to the beginning of the LPS infusion. Evaluation of physiologic changes including mean arterial blood pressure and cardiac output, quantitative analysis of eytoldne levels including TNFct, IL-113,1I,-6, IL-8 and IL-10, and liver enzymes during a 24 hour period revealed that treatment with anti-CD14 mAb markedly attenuated all parameters of injury including decreased mean arterial blood pressure, increased cytnkine levels and the release of liver enzymes observed in animals given the isotype control mAb or those not treated. Administration of anti-CD14 mAb to interferon-gamma treated animals NOT challenged with LPS did not induce any detectable physiologic changes or increases in cytoldnes. These studies suggest that strategies to block LPS-CD14 interactions will have utility in diseases such as septic shock or ARDS where LPS plays a central role in initiating injury.",

            "text": "Preclinical Studies with Recombinant Bactericidal/Permeability Increasing Proteins (rBPI and rBPI23). P.W. \"Frown, Dept. of Preclinical Science, XOMA Corporation, Berkeley, California, USA. Bactericidal/permeability increasing protein (BPI), from neutrophils, binds to and neutralizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS); it also specifically kills gram-negative bacteria (GNB). These properties, which reside in the N-terminal half of the molecule, indicate potential therapeutic application in the treatment of gram-negative sepsis. The gene for human BPI has been cloned and recombinant holoprotein (rBPI) and a 23 Kd N-terminal fragment (rBPI;3) have been produced in sufficient quantities for preclinical studies. Both rBPI and rBPI23 bind to lipid A and neutralize the biological activities of LPS derived from a variety of organisms, rBPI23 has equivalent antibacterial activity to BPI against rough GNB but is up to 30X more potent than BPI vs. serum-resistant and smooth GNB. rBPI and rBPI23 compete with LPS-binding protein (LBP) for binding to LPS under physiological conditions. Consequently, both rBPI and rBPI23 block the CD14-dependent LPSinduced synthesis of the cytokines TNF, IL-1, EL-6 and IL-8 in vitro. rBPI23 has also been shown to inhibit the LPS-induced synthesis of reactive 02 metabolites, endothelial adhesion molecules and the procoagulant molecule tissue factor. In animals, rBPI has been reported to increase survival of endotoxin-challenged rats and mice, to inhibit the dermal Schwartzman reaction in rabbits and to increase survival of neutropenic rats with Pseudomonas bacteremia, rBPI23 increases survival and decreases cytokine production in endotoxin challenged mice and rats. It normalizes LPS-induced changes in hemodynamic, pulmonary and/or metabolic parameters in LPS-induced rats, rabbits and pigs. Treatment with rBPI23 also increases survival and decreases cytokine production in bacterial challenge models in rats and mice. rBPI23 was not toxic to rats after 10 daily consecutive i.v. doses of 10 mg/kg. This combination of properties indicate that recombinant BPI may be useful in the treatment of sepsis. Phase I/II clinical trials of rBPI23 have begun. The discovery of LPS binding protein (LBP) and subsequent identification of CD14 as a receptor for LPS or LPS-LBP complexes has resulted in a new understanding o\u00a3 how LPS responsive ceils are stimulated. CD14 is found either as a glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol (GPI)-anehored membrane glycoprotein (mCD14) of myeloid cells or as a soluble serum protein (sCD14) lacking the GPI-anchor. Binding of LPS to mCD 14 triggers cell activation while binding of LPS-sCD14 complexes to cells such as endothelial or epithelial cells that normally do not express mCD14 activates these cells. These pathways are shown in schematic form below. 4 ~DI mCD14 plays a crucial role in presentation of LPS to additional membrane components that make up a functional LPS receptor. An immediate consequence of engagement of this functional receptor is protein tyrosine phosphorylation. The molecular mechanisms leading to these events will be discussed. Understanding of these pathways will lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches to controlling host responses to LPS. Pretreatmen t Posttreatment (before or after TNF peak) D) with different antibody dosages: 15 mg/kg ---0.1 mg/kg Pretreatment with anti-TNFab prevented death in most model situations (except peritonitis), but also posttreatment up to 4h after sepsis induction was successful in the few studies performed. There is additional evidence that low-dose TNFab is partially effective. Especially baboon anti-TNFab studies provided many insights into the pathophysiological sequences of sepsis induction, due to crossreactivity with human reagents. Those events include the cytokine sequence with TNF-dependent IL-I, IL-6, or IL-8, but also IL-lra or sTNF receptor release. Granulocyte as well as endothelial cell activation were shown to be partly TNF related, and the procoagulatory response was influenced by anti-TNF treatment. From many animal studies the concept that TNF plays a pivotal role in sepsis is clearly evident and therefore anti-TNF therapy is a major candidate tbr clinical studies. The beneficial or harmful effects of TNF-mediated inflammatory responses depend on the clinical context. Decreasing exaggerated TNF-mediated inflammatory responses may be useful in some patients with organ failure. TNFR:Fc (Immunex, Seattle, WA) is a recombinant human protein composed of two identical extracellular p80 TNF receptors linked by the Fc region of IgGl. It neutralizes TNF with an affinity for TNF<z of 10-10 M and has a T1/2 of \u2022 63h in normal humans. Methods: 18 normal volunteers were randomized to receive either TNFR:Fc vehicle (n=6), or low dose (LD) TNFR:Fc (10 mg/m 2 iv, n=6), or high dose (HD) TNFR:Fc (60 mg/m 2 iv, n=6) infused over 30 rain prior to endotoxin (E) (Escherichia coil 0:113; 4 ng/kg iv) administration. Plasma cytokines were measured using ELISA and TNF bioactiv'dy. Systemic hemodynamics were evaluated with indwelling arterial and pulmonary artery catheters and radionuclide heart scans and compared before and after fluid loading in subjects given vehicle with HD TNFR:Fc. Results: Endotoxin-related symptoms were unchanged after LD or HD. Peak temperature occurred at a later time point (4-5h) in subjects given TNFR:Fc compared to vehicle (3h) (p=.004). At 3h, 5h (post fluid load ), and 8h, subjects given vehicle developed increased cardiac index and heart rate and decreased systemic vascular resistance index (all p=.0001 ). HD TNFR:Fc did not alter this hyperdynamic cardiovascular response. LD and HD inhibited the E-induced teukopenta at I h post endotoxin (p<.03) and later leukocytosis (p<0.05). Peak TNF bioactivity in subjects given vehicle was 154 + 44 pg/mL and <10 pg/mL in the LD or HD TNFR:Fc groups (p<.001). Two immunoassays for TNF were performed because the detection of receptor bound TNF varies with ELISA. TNF (Biosource) was decreased in LD vs vehicle or HD (p=.0001) whereas TNF (R&D Systems) was increased after HD or LD vs vehicle (p<.001). Decreased levels of IL-8 (p=.00t), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (p=.03), and IL-1 receptor antagonist (p=.001) were found after LD or HD vs vehicle. IL-6 levels were lower after LD vs vehicle or HD (p=.006). IL-10 levels were similar among subjects given vehicle, LD, and HD TNFR:Fc. Conclusions: LD and HD TNFR:Fc delayed the febrile response to E but did not alter the early hyperdynamic cardiac response. This suggests that mediators other than TNF play an important role in the initial cardiovascular response to E in humans. TNFR:Fc attenuated the release of some E and TNF-induced cytokines. Ti~e antiinflammatory responses of TNFR:Fc may be useful in some patients with disease processes resulting from excessive TNF-mediated inflammatory responses. The biosynthesis of TNF within macrophages is regulated both at the transcriptional and the translational levels. The 5' flanking region of the TNF gene contains several transcriptional control elements, including two KB enhancers similar to those of immunoglobulin genes and a \"Y box\" similar to that of the MHC class II promoter. These elements are critical for the enhancement of transcription noted after stimulation of macrophages with LPS. Despite these and other elements, transcriptional regulation alone accounts neither for the absence of TNF protein during normal homeostasis nor the profound increasein TNF production following stimulation with LPS or other secretagogues.",

This region not only destabilizes mRNA, but also confers a translational blockade so that TNF protein is not normally synthesized despite leaky basal transcription. LPS stimulation releases translational blockade and, together with enhanced trancriptional rate, accounts for significantly increased TNF secretion. Opportunities for inhibition of TNF production are available at each of these two levels. Agents which increase intracellular cAMP (pentoxif\u00a51ine, amrinone) inhibit accumulation of TNF mRNA; in contrast, corticosteroids act primarily at the level of translation, inhibiting LPS induced translational activation. Understanding the regulation of TNF biosynthesis may assist in clinical strategies designed to regulate TNF secretion. The serine protease thrombin is formed by enzymatic conversion from its proenzyme form after coagulation activation and may enhance the inflammatory response in various ways. In the last step of the coagulation cascade, thrombin cleaves its substrate fibrinogen, thus forming fibrin. The fibrin clot may prevent phagocytosis of bacteria and promote local bacterial growth. Thrombin can also stimulate a specific th.rombin receptor that exists on a variety of cells. For example, minute amounts of thrombin ma), stimulate platelets to develop tissue factor and boost the activation of more thrombin, thus initiating a positive feedback loop. Other cellular effects of thrombin receptor stimulation include increase in intracellular calcium of platelets and monocytes, contraction of smooth muscle cells, increase in endothelial permeability, thromboxane generation by neutrophils and lymphocytes, pulmonary vasoconstriction, and enhanced cytokine production.",

The data concerning the effects of this therapy is, however, conflicting and in large prospective studies, the use of early administration of high doses of corticosteroids have been found to give no beneficial effects in patients with sepsis. We have particularly been engaged in studies on possible effects of corticosteroids on the plasma cascade systems and on the mediator release from leukocytes. In in vitro studies, high doses of methylprednisolone were found to facilitate endotoxin induced generation of plasma kallikrein. Furthermore, plasma prekallikrein and kallikrein inhibitor values decreased together with formation of kallikrein-C1 inhibitor complexes (1). In this in vitro plasma model we also found that methylpredoisolone alone in doses of 1 mg/ml induced contact activation with the formation of kallikrein-C1 inhibitor complexes. Methylprednisolone was also found to have an additive effect on endotoxine induced decreases in kallikrein inhibitor functions. In the same experimental model on endotoxemia methylprednisoione was found to give an additive effect on activation of the initial part of the complement cascade (2) . Activation of the terminal part of complement, however, was inhibited by the same dose of methylprednisolone. Addition of methylprednisolone alone to plasma was also found to activate the initial part of complement. Using a full blood model, we studied the effect of methylpredoisolone in modulating the endotoxin induced cytokine response. When 103 ng/l E. coli endotoxin was added to citrated blood from healthy human donors preinkubation with 20 gg/ml methylprednisolone significantly reduced the release of tumor necrosis factor et (79 %) and interleukin-6 (63 % ) at two hours after exposure to endotoxin.",

Furthermore, we also observed that this drag in in vitro conditions facilitated activation of complement. On the other hand, corticosteroids were found to reduce endotoxin induced cytokine release from leukocytes in whole blood. These studies also showed a dose dependence of the effects of corticosteroids on endotoxin induced cellular and cascade system activation. Different predisposing conditions like extensive trauma, infection or pancreatitis result in a remarkably similar inflammatory response. Although thls inflammatory response primarily aims at the removal of devitalized tissues, destruction of bacteria and reestablishment of the integrity of host tissues, it may potentially become unregulated and generalized and thereby producing deleterious effects to vital organs or the body\" as a whole. Cytokines play an important role in the development of the systemic inflammatory response. Most of their biological effects, however, are not directly mediated but exerted through other mediator systems. When the inflammatory response results in the formation of capillary leak syndrome and refractory hypotension, the unregulated activation of complement and contact systems appears to be the cause. Both systems are almost exclusively regulated by C1-1nhibitor. Am unbalanced degradation of the inhibitor protein was found to be associated with the onset of capillary leakage in various conditions such as bone marrow transplantation, severe burns, and septic shock. These observations suggest a relative deficiency of biologically active C3-1nhibitor in these septic shock like syndromes. Therapeutic intervention studies were initiated using high doses of C1-1nhibitor concentrate.",

Rabinovici, SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, King of Prussia, PA, USA, and *Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, PA, USA Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a severe pulmonary insufficiency syndrome associated with diverse diseases and injuries. ARDS is believed to be the consequence of a massive acute inflammatory reaction consisting of activated neutrophils infiltration into the lung. Neutrophil activation is likely the result of multiple factors of which complement is believed to play a major role. A potent complement regulatory system in the form of the Complement Receptor Type-1 (CR-1) exists on many cells where protection against complement injury is provided by inhibition of both the alternative and classical pathways for C3/C5 convertase formation. We have recently purified the human recombinant CR-1 in a truncated form (BRL55730, TP-IO, sCR-1) and tested this soluble protein for protective effects in several models of ARDS. Specifically, we have used the following rat models: 1) endotoxin-induced ARDS in PAF primed animals; 2) 11.-2induced ARDS; 3) thermal injury (30% body surface)-induced ARDS; 4) acid aspiration-induced ARDS. ARDS-like features included edema (increase in lung wet weight and water content), neutrophil accumulation (histological inspection and myeloperoxidase assay) and increase in cells and protein in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAD. sCR-1, 1-25 mg/kg, i,v., given as prophylactic (and in some cases, therapeutic) treatment significantly inhibited edema formation and leukocyte infiltration and, in some cases (e.g., endotoxin/PAF or IL-2), virtually completely. These comprehensive studies strongly support the therapeutic potential of sCR-1 in ARDS due to diverse injuries. The xanthine derivative pentoxifylline (PTX) and several analogs of PTX have been evaluated for their protective effect in various animal models of septic shock. Data from these in vivo studies demonstrate that (1) PTX suppresses LPS-induced TNF release from activated macrophages; (2) PTX prevents TNF-induced PMN activation; (3) PTX attenuates LPS-or TNFinduced acute lung injury as evidenced by prevention of increased pulmonary vascular permeability and detoriation of gas exchange; (4) PTX exerts its .protective effects even when administered following initiation of sepsis. The sum of these actions suggest that administration of PTX in sepsis may have therapeutic potential.",

            "text": "Pentoxifylline [POF] and related xanthins are drugs of known haemorrheologieal activity and widely used clinically. Recently, new pharmacological aspects of these established drugs could be demonstrated. It was found that POF selectively inhibits the formation of TNF but not IL-6 most likely by causing accumulation of intraceliular cAMP via inhibiting phosphodiestersse activity, and, secondly, by inducing prostacyclin in different cell types. Furthermore, POF is able to counteract TNF-mediated adherence of neutrophils to vascular endothelium and to inhibit FMLP-indueed respiratory burst in neutrophils. We and others have, therefore, studied its effect in different animal models. It was found that POF protected from increased pulmonary vascular permeability and sequestration of neutrophils into the lung in different animal models of acute lung injury. Moreover, in pigs with induced faecal peritonitis the drug improved haemodyrmmle variables as well as pulmonary compliance and reduced the number of pulmonary neutrophila and lymphocytes. Consequently, as a general outcome, POF could be found to improve survival in different models of haemorrhagie and endotoxie shock. The protective effect of POF was dose-dependent and observed even when POF was given up to 4 hours after endotoxin. In order to evaluate these pharmacological effects of POF in humans, we studied POF under controlled conditions of endotoxlnemia in volunteers. We found that POF selectively inhibits the LPS-indueed endogenous formation of TNF without affecting IL-6 and IL-8. Moreover, POF counteracts the LPS-indueed initial leukocytopenia by interfering with the adherence of neutrophils in the microvasculature. Meanwhile the inhibition of endogenous formation of TNF by POF could be demonstrated under different clinical conditions of acute and chronic cytokine release syndromes, {OKT3 first-dose reaction, cancer-or tuberculosis-induced cachexla}. It appears worthwile and promising to investigate wether POF exhibits beneficial effects also in septic patients. Objectives: To determine the specific role of PAF in both lethal primate bacteremia and nonlethal human endotoxemia. Materials and methods: Two double-blinded placebo controlled studies were performed. First, ten baboons (14.5 +.7 kg), were randomized to a control group receiving 101\u00b0 cfu/kg of intravenously administered E. co/i (n=5) and a treatment group (n =5), pretreated with .1 mg/kg of PAF receptor antagonist Ro24-4736 two hours prior to E. co/i infusion. In a second study, ten healthy male volunteers were randomized to a control group receiving 4 ng/kg of intravenously administered endotoxin (LPS) (n=5) and a treatment group (n=5) pretreated with 10 mg of Ro24-4736 eighteen hours prior to LPS administration. Physiologic parameters and cytokine levels were measured continuously in both studies for 24 hours. Results: Baboons pretreated with the PAF antagonist had improved oxygenation (96 + 11 mm Hg v 59 -+ 6 in controls, p < 0.05) and creatinine clearance 12 hours post E.coli (39.8 + 23.4 ml/min v 0.1 _+ 0.1 in controls, p < 0.05). Similarly, volunteers pretreated with the PAF antagonist experienced fewer symptoms, including rigors and myalgias at 1 hour post LPS. This was in concert with a diminished peak cortisol (668 +_ 107 mmot/L v 959 +-159 mmol/L in controls, p < 0.05), epinephrine secretion (1057 + 165 nmol/L v 2029 + 431 nmol/L in controls, p < 0.05). Hemodynamics and circulating TNFa levels (data not shown) were unaffected in either study by prior PAF antagonism. Concluslons: PAF influences some components of the multi-organ failure syndrome in lethal gram negative sepsis and the counter-regulatory hormonal system in human endotoxemia through TNF-independent mechanisms. PAF antagonists may serve as adjuncts to cytokine blockade in the treatment of gram negative sepsis. The mediator Role of Platelet-Activating Factor in Gramnegative Septic Shock Pierre G. Braquet, David Hosford and Matyas Koltai Institut Henri Beaufour, Le Plessis Robinson, France Considerable evidence has been accumulated to support the concept that a PAF/cytokine autogenerated feedback network is responsible for priming and amplification of inflammatory mediator release in septic shock. Cytokines, such as TNF~x, IL-1 and other interleukins interact with PAF which then amplifies cytokine production, therefore, PAF may be the principle mediator in endotoxin shock. A single factor identified as TNF is suggested to play a pivotal role in the fatal phase of septic shock. Presumably excess TNF release is the result of amplification process primarily triggered by PAF. One may assume that the high TNF concentration in the blood of 'non survivors' is the consequence rather than the cause of cell death. The dubious results of clinical trials with anti-TNF antibodies and IL-1Ra, a naturally occurring IL-1 antagonist protein, have risen debate around the exceptional role of cytokines in the pathomechanism of septic shock or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) induced by Gramnegative microorganisms. There are similar problems with the interpretation of the results obtained in clinical trials of monoclonal IgM antibodies against E. coli endotoxin, HA-1A and E5. Future studies will answer the question as to the effectivity of inefficiency of this treatment. Perhaps when the plasma concentrations of LPS and cytokines exceed a critical level, treatment fails to save the patients life. With regard the causal role of LPS in septic shock, the putative role of bacterial porins may have to be taken into consideration. The marked release of PAF induced by endotoxin leading to excess TXA2 production may be responsible for the microvascular failure and death in septic shock. Antagonists of PAF markedly protect against the release of TXA2, and may interrupt the vicious circle of amplification process. NO produced by the inducible NO synthase plays a pivotal role in causing vascular paralysis in LPS-induced SIRS. To explore the relationship of PAF to NO synthesis will provide better understanding of the pathomechanism of septic shock. Several PAF antagonists, including BN 52021, have undergone phase II and phase III clinical trials. The strategy in the treatment of SIRS, however, remains multifactorial, since little is known about the SIRS caused by microorganisms other than Gram-negative bacteria. Evidence has begun to accumulate which suggests that in sepsis excess production of LPS and cytokines can lead to uncontrolled production of iNOS and that this might in part explain the severe unresponsive hypotension seen in some septic patients. A number of strategies have been explored in an attempt to limit excess NO production. A favourite target has been competitive inhibition of NOS by arginine analogues such as L-NMMA. In animals, some investigators have shown that the haemodynamic effects of LPS challenge can be attenuated by L-NMMA, but there is a narrow toxic-therapeutic ratio. In a model of live E. cell sepsis, we have been unable to reproduce these findings. Localisation of NO production by immunohistochemistry suggests that NO production is compartmentalised, and more subtle methods of regulation may be required if this approach is to have clinical valuc.",

The neutrophil has been implicated as a pivotal player in the pathogenesis of multiple organ dysfunction. An important first step in the process of neutrophilmediated organ injury involves the binding of neutrophils to endothelial ceils. This process is largely regulated by complementary adhesion molecules, some of which are present constitutively on the cell surface and others that can be upregulated in response to chemotactic and pro-inflammatory stimuli. Several different adhesion molecules have been described. L-selec tin is expressed on the plasma membrane of neutrophils and is shed from the surface early in the inflammatory process. It is therefore thought to mediate the initial interactions with endothelial cells. E-selectin and P-selectin are endothelial adhesion molecules. E-selectin is not constitutively expressed but is upregulated by inflammatory mediators, particularly IL-1 and TNF. P-selectin is present in the Weibel-Palade bodies within the endothelial cytoplasm and can be upregulated rapidly in response to thrombin, histamine, and oxidants. All selectins recognize oligosaccharides, particularly sialylated Lewis X antigen. This carbohydrate moiety is expressed on many proteins, including the selectins themselves. The leukocyte integrins are glycoproteins expressed on the neutrophil surface and in the cytoplasmic granules. Integrins consist of a common beta2 or cluster differentiation (CD)I 8 chain covalently linked to one of three different alpha chains (CD11 a, CD1 lb, CD1 lc) and exist on the cell surface as three distinct heterodimers. CD1 l a/CDI 8 is expressed on all leukocytes, whereas CD1 l b/ CD18 and CD1 lc/CD18 are restricted to cells of myeloid origin. CD1 I/CD18 interacts with intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), its ligand on endothelial cells. ICAM-1 is a member of the immunoglobulin family of adhesion molecules. It is constitutively expressed on endothelial cells and can be upregulated by cytokines. The potential for monoclonal antibodies to adhesion proteins to reduce vascular and tissue damage has been studied in alarge number of experimental models. Protective effects have been observed in a wide variety of inflammatory, immune, and ischemia-reperfusion injuries such as arthritis, bums, endotoxic shock, bacterial meningitis, autoimmune diabetes, nerve degeneration, allograft rejection, allergic asthma, acute lung inflammation, skin lesions, and ischemia-reperfusion models of the intestine, myocardium, lung, skeletal muscle, and central nervous system. Protective effects have also been observed in animals resuscitated following hemorrhagic shock. Since modulating the function of adhesion molecules may temporarily leave the host without effective defense machinery, safety evaluations are of utmost importance in evaluating this therapeutic approach.",

By comparison, nine (32%) of 28 control group patients died during this period (p <. 01 ). Within the first 48 hrs after onset of the clinically apparent septie process, significaptly increased activity of circulating endotoxin and simultaneously decreased specifie IgG serum titers to lipid A were detected in the group of nonsurvivors. The rationale for the use of polyvalent intravenous immunogiobulins (IVIG) to treat severe infections stems from in vitro and animal studies documenting that high-dose IgG enhance opsonization and phagocytosis of pathogenic bacteria. Moreover, recent clinical studies have shown that in septic patients the phagocytic function of circulating polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) is defective; the degree of such impairment correlates to the severity of the septic state, The beneficial effect of administering high dose IgO in septic patients can be two-fold: I) IVIG provides large quantities of antibodies against invading pathogens; the IgG bound to the pathogens can opsonize their phagocytosis; 2) the opsonization of phagocytosis by exogenously administred polyvalent IgO would be of special importance in those patients who present a significant defect of their phagocytic function, when they are challanged by a large bacterial invasion. A prospective, randomized, double-blind study was carried out comparing the administration of IVIG (Sandoglobulin@) vs, paeebo (human albumin) in severely septic surgical patients, Only patients with gepis score >_20 (meaning a mortality risk >70%) were accepted into this protocol. Patients were randomized to receive 0.4 g/Kg of IVIG or placebo on day 0 (when they reached sepsis score>20), repeated on day +1 and +5. At the beginning of ICU treatment, the two groups of patients were similar for severity of sepsis, age, concomitant disease, type of surgical procedures, antra and perioperative procedures, antibiotic administration. The results of the study indicated a significantly reduced mortality in patients with severe surgical sepsis treated with IVIG as compared to placebo control patients (mortality: 38% vs, 67% respectively; p< 0,05). In conclusion, the results of our study in patients with severe surgical sepsis were the following: 1) IVIG plus multimodal treatment of sepsis, including antibiotics, reduce mortality significantly', 2) the reduction of mortality seems to be due to a decreased incidence of lethal septic shock.",

The majority of deaths are now caused by either an initial overwhelming response to infection or subsequent multiple organ system failure attributed, in part, to the effects of intrinsic biologic responses of the host. Type of organism, therefore, may not be as critical as determining the exact severity of the host's severity or risk of death from infection. We also know that both the relative benefit of a new treatment across groups and its absolute benefit for an Individual patient will vary with their risk in a predictable fashion.",

Use of a predicted risk of mortality in the design and analysis of clinical trials could improve our understanding of the clinical benefit of these new therapeutic approaches. The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is a term recently proposed to describe patients with systemic inflammatory responses to insults such as infections (sepsis), trauma, burns, pancreatitis, and other initiating events. Patients with SIRS may have similar activation of inflammatory mediators and similar outcomes independent of the initiating event. These outcomes include organ dysfunction and failure, shock, and death. Challenges to the successful conduct of clinical trials in SIRS include the complexity of illness in these patients and the important--but limited--clinical benefits of novel compounds that may be limited to selected patient subsets. Addressing these challenges will require new tools and approaches. These will include more sensitive and appropriate endpoints, and the use of methods such as baseline risk adjustment, to allow detection of drug risk interactions not captured adequately by categorical definitions, such as sepsis syndrome.",

Study PurPose: In post-cardiac surgical patients (pat.) at risk for sepsis, the efficacy of early i.v. immunoglobulin (Ig) treatment was compared to a matching historical control (con.) population. Postoperative risk assessment: Using APACHE II scores LAP) (first postoperative [pop.] day) in a pilot study phase, we were able to differentiate between the large population (95.2%) of pop. low-risk pat. (AP< 19; mortality: 1%) and the small groups of pop. pat. at risk LAP= 19-23) and high risk LAP_24) with a significantly higher mortality (14% and 76%, mainly due to sepsis). Subsequently, among 1341 consecutive pop. pat. we prospectively identified and treated these pat. Iq treatment reqimens: First study period (n =41): (gG (Psomaglobin N a, Tropon Biologische Pr~parate, Cologne, FRG, day 1:8 ml/kg, day 2:4 ml/kg). Second study period (n=25): IgGMA (Pentaglobin R, Biotest, Dreieich, FRG, 5 ml/kg on days 1 to 3). Results: Ig pat. and con. were comparable in demographic data, operation characteristics and baseline disease severity LAP and Elebute sepsis scores). In contrast to con. (risk: n=21, high-risk: n-21), the Ig pat. showed a marked improvement in disease severity (fall in AP), especially in the high-risk group (IgG, n=26: p<O.05; IgGMA, n=13: p: 0.08). In this group, Ig led to higher (p<0.05) response rates, defined as an AP score decrease ->7 within four days (IgG: 54%, IgGMA: 62%; con.: 19%), and reduction in mortality (IgG: 46%, IgGMA: 46%; con.: 76%), statistically significant (p<0.05) for Ig treatment as a whole (IgG and IgGMA). Conclusion: Given the good comparability of the study groups, our results indicate, despite the non-randomized design, that early supplemental Ig treatment can improve disease severity and may improve prognosis in prospectively APACHE II score-identified high-risk patients after cardiac surgery. Objective. Elevated plasma levels of Endothelin (ET) have been demonstrated in both experimental and human sepsis. ET has been proposed as a sepsis mediator leading to vasoconstriction with tissue hypoperfusion and organ failure. The aim of the study was to determine the effects of sepsis treatment with volume resuscitation, antibiotics and the anti-LPS monoclonal antibody ES\u00ae on big ET and active, 21 aminoacids ET (ET 21) in rat abdominal sepsis. Methods. Lethal peritonitis was induced with a 4 mm coecal perforation (CP) in male Wistar rats. Plasma levels of big ET and ET 21 were determined with Amersham TM Endothelin RIAs 4, 8 and 12 h after sepsis induction. Experimental groups: 1. CP control, 2. Volume replacement (VR); 0,9% saline 10 ml/kg/h continous iv infusion started after 2 h, 3. Antibiotic; imipenem 40 mg/kg iv after 2 h, 4. E5\u00ae; 10 mg/kg iv after 2 h, 5. VR + imipenem + ES\u00ae after 2 h. Results. High concentrations of both big ET and ET 21 could be demonstrated after 2 h and lasting for 12 h after CP. Neither volume replacement nor imipenem did influence the elevated plasma ET. E5\u00ae significantly reduced ET 21 both 4, 8 and 12 h after sepsis induction, but did not reduce big ET. When ES\u00ae was combined with VR and imipenem, reduction of ET 21 was the same as for E5\u00ae alone. These results strongly suggest that bacteria and hypovolemia per se are not decisive stimuli for ET production during sepsis. E5\u00ae reduces circulating LPS and TNF which is the probable mechanism of the suppressed ET 21 synthesis. The unaltered big ET fraction after E5\u00ae treatment indicates conversion of big ET to ET 21 as the site of action responsible for reduced ET 21.",

Introduction: The cardiovascular therapy of hypodynarnic shock states is a challenging problem. In clinical as well as experimental studies beneficial functions of a new Hg-agonist BU-E-75 in congestive heart failure has been demonstrated 03aumann, 1989). Therefore, we investigated the effect of BU-E-75 in hypodynamic shock in pigs. Materials and Methods: Pigs (Deutsches Hausschwein, Pitrain, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] were anesthesized with Fentanyl/Dormicum, ventilated (N20:O 2 = 2:1) and cardiovascular parameters were monitored with a complete ICU-eqnipment. The hypodynamic model was established in a pilot study (4 animals) to evaluate the effective concentration of BUE-75 in healthy and endotoxin (LPS)-treated animals. Endotoxic shock was induced by continous infusion of 10 ~g LPS/kgKG/h (055:B5, Fa. Difco). The hypodynamic state was defined as a decrease of cardiac output by 30 % of steady state levels. A wedge pressure of 10-12 mmHg was kept constant by volume resucitation during the experiment. In a subsequent randomized controlled trial (RTC) 3 groups with 6 animals per group were studied. The groups were treated as follows: group I, LPS and 0,9 % NaC1; group II, LPS and BU-E-75 (100 #g/kgKG/h); group III, Famotidine (H2-blocker) pretreatment (1 mg/kgKG), LPS and BU-E-75. Results: The pilot study in healthy pigs revealed, that BU-E-75 had positive inotropic effects. These effects were inhibited by the H 2antagonist Famotidin. BU-E-75 however had no beneficial effects in the hypodynamic phase of endotoxic shock in the RCT. Cardiac Index (CI) and the oxygen delivery (DO2) were not significantly influenced by BU-E-75 application (group I versus group II). BU-E-75 did not ameliorate the negative inotropic effect measuring left ventricular stroke work (LVSW) in hypodynamic shock phases. On the contrary, BU-E-75 led to a further significant decrease of LVSW (p < 0,05). Famotidin pretreatment did not affect the response (group III versus group II). Conclusion: In hypodynamic shock states the H2-agonism seemed to have no beneficial effect under these experimental conditions. Receptor down regulation or changes of signal transduction under septic conditions may be responsible. Cellular studies may help to identify these mechanisms. Objectives. Antithrombin III inactivation of proccagulant proteases is so far the only inhibitory therapeutic approach to disseminated intravascutar coagulation (DIC). We therefore set out to investigate whether Cll substitution reduces coagulation activation in an endotoxin induced rabbit DIC model. Materials and Methods. 29 male rabbits Chbb:HM(SPF) were randomty assigned to one of the following groups. Group K : NaCI 0.9% (control without endotoxin, n=10). Group E : Endotoxin 120 tJg kg \"1 bolus i.v. + NaCI 0.9% (control with endotoxin, n=10). Group C : Endotoxin 120 pg kg -1 bolus i.v. + Cll 400 U kg -1 bolus + 400 U kg \"1 4h \"~ i,v. (treatment group, n=9). All animals were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated. Blood samples were drawn prior to endotoxin administration (M1) and after 120 (M2) and 240 rain. (M3). Thereafter, lung and liver tissue samples were taken intravitatly in a standardized fashion for H&E microscopic fibrin quantification using a triple score (FIBS). From all blood samples the prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrin monomers (FM), and d-dimers (DD) were measured. For statistical significance of differences between the groups ANOVAs and the Wilcoxon test (FIBS) were performed. Results. FIBS for lung/liver were significantly different (p<0.05) between group E (lung 180, liver 159) and C (lung 89, liver 0) (Group K : lung 11, liver 0). , a synthetic serine proteinase inhibitor, has an anticoagulant activity in the absence of\" antithrobim III. Gabexate has been reported to be useful in the treatment of disseminated intravascular coaguiation due to neoplastic diseases. In this study, we investigated gabexate therapy for the treatment of DIC due to sepsis in the postoperative critical patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From July 1992 to June 1993, 15 patients in the surgical intensive care unit met the criteria of DIC or pre-DIC. Eleven were male and four were female with the mean age of 66.7 years. All these patients suffered from some complication of operations which led to the development of sepsis. FOY was administered at the rate of 2mg/kg/hr untiI the coagulation profile retumed to normal or the patient died. The coagulation parameters were monitored before and on the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th day. RESULTS: Fourteen of these fifteen patients died despite transient improvement of the coagulation parameters in five patients. These patients suffered from sepsis resulting from surgical complications which could not be well controlled. The only survival was a case of recurrent intrahepatic duct stone with biliary tract infection complicated with sepsis and DIC. After choledocholithotomy and the use of FOY, the patient recovered gradually. CONCLUSION: DIC is a late manifestation of sepsis in the critical surgical patients. The most important thing is to eradicate the cause of sepsis. If the underlying septic focus cannot be controlled, DIC will persist despite the use of gabexate mesilate.",

The BK 1 receptor is also constitutive but in the majority of cases is inducible and involved in chronic inflammatory syndromes such as sepsis, hyperalgesia and airways hyperreactivty in animals. The mechanism(s) involved in the upregulation of the BK 1 receptor is unclear, however a variety of agents including LPS, E Coil and ILl are particularly efficacious in vitro and in vivo. ILl and Bradykinin acting at their respective receptors are believed to be involved in SIRS/Sepsis. We have investigated the effect of antagonists at ILl (Antril), BK 2 (Bradycor [CP-0127]),BK~ (CP-0298) and BKz/BK 1 (CP-0364) receptors on the de novo generation of BK~ receptors (reflected by hypotensive responses to a BK 1 agonist) in the LPS-treated (10ug iv) rabbit.",

Antril alone had no effect on BK 2 or BK~ responses. Within 30-60 min after stopping the infusions of antagonists the responses to BK~ and BK z agonists were the same as those in nonantagonist infused rabbits. These results indicate, at least in the LPS-treated rabbit, that neither BK2,BK ~ or ILl receptors alone or in combination, are involved in the de novo generation of BK 1 receptors. In vitro studies demonstrated that beth Bradycor and CP-0364 (but not Antril) were antagonists at both BK z and BK~ receptors. If both BK z and BK 1 receptors are significantly involved in chronic inflammatory situations in man such as SIRS/sepsis then the rationale for the use of compounds such as Bradycor or CP-0364 is clear. Infection is a major cause of or contributor for morbidity and mortality in liver transplant recipients. Effectiveness of prophylactic and therapeutic protocols is important for the success of liver transplantation ( OLT ). SDD is used as prophylaxis for reduction of infection caused by Gram negative or fungal microorganisms. Between September 1988 and July 1993 400 OLT's in 368 patients were performed at our department. The actuarial 1-year patient survival is 90 %. Infection prophylaxis is started with SDD and ciprofloxacin once the patient is accepted as an OLT candidate. Perioperatively metronidazol, tobramycin and cefotaxim, postoperatively cotrimoxazol are prescribed additionally. The table shows Pneumonia, peritonitis, major wound and urinary tract infection are common nosocomial infections following severe injury. In a series of severely injured patients from the University of Louisville Hospital, pneumonia was the most common infection followed by peritonitis, intra-abdominal abscess formation and burn wound infection. Pneumonia is actually the leading cause of death from nosocomial infection. These are defined as occurring from 48 to 72 hours after hospital admission. This definition has important implications for antibiotic therapy because the likely pathogens and their respective sensitivities are different for community acquired pneumonia. The diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia is difficult following major injury as many patients will have pre-existing fever, leukocytosis, tachypnea, and chest X-ray changes. Reliance on sputum gram stain and culture is important and best obtained by a bronchoalveolar lavage or protected specimen brush during bronchoscopy. Predisposing risk factors include severe head injury, emergent intubation and shock, and such patients have been shown to benefit by early tracheostomy. Staph aureus has been the most common pathogen isolated from the sputum and the remainder gram-negative organisms with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumonia predominating. Bacteria recovered by site as well as by intensive care unit is published in the six month antibiogram which also includes recent antibiotic sensitivities. This aids in empiric antibiotic selection against such nosocomial organisms. In a series of severely injured patients (ISS -30), mean temp. was 101.4F, leukocytosis was 16k, Pan2 was 87, Fin2 was .47, and PEEP was 5.1 at the time of diagnosis (ARDS excluded). There was marked reduction in class II histocompatibility antigen (HLA-DR) density on peripheral and BAL monocyte/macrophages which recovered over time with resolution of pneumonia. Immune suppression occurred prior to development of pneumonia, was especially localized to the infected tissue, but recovered with clinical improvement. Specific immune modulation targeted to pulmonary white cells may hasten clinical recovery and minimize pulmonary dysfunction.",

Its advantages include a broad spectrum of activity and intravenous administration. The major disadvantages of amphoterlcin B is its severe side-effects, especially the nephrotoxicity. To decrease the toxic side..cffccts various liposomal amphoteficin B formulations have been produced. It was found that these liposemal formulations were as effective as amphotericin B but in contrast had a low incidence of toxicity. At present there are three ~different variations of lipid formulations under assessment: Amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC), amphotericin B coloidal dispersion (ABCD) or true liposomes. The ABLC has a ribbon like structure. It has been shown to have a reduced toxicity and an efficacy ranging from being as effective to four times less effective that conventional amphotericin B. Regarding ABCD the particles have a disk-like structure with a diameter of around t00 am and a thickness of 4nm. The ami-fungal efficacy is 2-4 times less than that of conventional amphotedcin B. Both ABLC and ABCD are presently investigated in phase II/III studies in the US. AmBiseme is currently the only commefieally available true lipesome. AmBiseme is a spherical small unilamellar lipesome with a diameter less than 100 nm with a mutina LD50 of > 175 mg/kg.

The mycological efficacy range from a 83% response rate for invasive Candida infections to 41% response rate for Aspergillosis. AmBisomc have been evaluated as anti-fungal prophylaxis in randomized trials in bone marrow (BMT) and liver transplant (LTX) recipients. It was well tolerated. In BMT recipients the incidence of proven fungal infections was 8% among placebo treated patients compared to 3% for the AmBisome treated patients (ns). In LTX recipients AmBisome prophylaxis was effective, significantly reducing the incidence of deep fungal infections from 16% to 0% ill placebo and AmBisome treated patients respectively (p<0.01).

Seroposltive recipients did not benefit from treatment and seronegatlve recipients of a seronegetlye donor were not et risk for CMV infection at e!l. In a open study the incidence of CMV Infection and disease was evaluated In 143 consecutive I~eart sllograft recipients. Sixty-five patients were CMV seronagatlve and they all received passive immunlzation according to the dosage schedule used in the kidney patients, but starting on the day of transplantation, This scheme resulted in median sntI-CMV IgG titers of 1200 ELISA units during 3 months. CMV infection occurred in 21/65 ~eronegetlve and in 40/81 seropositive recipients (n,s,), In ssronegetive donor-recipients pairs the incidence was significantly lower (3/34] , The passively Immunized seronegstive recipients of e seroposltlve donorheart showed comparable incidence of CMV infection f18t29) vs the seropositive recipients. Primary infection more often resulted in disease than secondary infection (11121 v8 10/40), but no difference in incidence of disease (11165 vs 10/81 ) or severity in symptoms was noted between the Immunoglobulln treated serone(]ative patients and the seropositiva recipients.",

Methods: Peripheral-venous blood was withdrawn on admission and furthermore twice weekly in as yet 36 patients with acute pancreatitis and tested for the parameters mentioned below. In parallel, polymorphounciear granaIocytes were isolated using density gradient centrifugation and assessed for superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical producing capacity using electron spin resonance techniques.

As yet little is known about the mechanisms by which oxidative stress and leukocytes damage pancreatic cells. The present study examines (I) the susceptibility of pancreatic acinar cells to attacks by oxidants and leukocytes and (2) the potential of antioxidants to prevent such damage in order to better understand the cellular mechanisms of pancreatic injury in inflammatory states. Methods: Freshly isolated rat pancreatic acinar ceils were exposed to a model system of oxidative stress consisting of 20 mU/ml xanthine oxidase (XOD), 500 mM hypoxanthine (HX), 50 mM FeC13 and 75 mM EDTA. In a second set of experiments, acinar cells were exposed to excess autologous neutrophils or neutrophils obtained from patients with acute pancreatitis. Neutrophils were stimulated by zymosan A, PMA, and IL-8. Cell viability was assessed by both cellular uptake of trypan blue (TB) and by release of LDH. Results: The XOD/HX system caused a time-dependent acinar cell injury. This injury was effectively prevented by catalase (CAT) and gfutathione peroxidase (GPx). In comrast, superoxide dismutase (SOD) enhanced cell injury. Addition of both SOD and CAT abolished the damage seen with SOD alone. The non-enzymatic scavengers mannitol, DMSO, DMTU and the iron chelator deferoxamine were not protective and at a higher concentration even accelerated cell decline. The newly developed antioxidants of the lazaroid type effectively prevented oxidative acinar cell damage. Stimulated neutrophils, both autologous and heterologous, did not damage healthy acinar cells but had even protective effects. Conclusion: Pancreatic acinar ceils are very susceptible to oxidative injury. A combination of catalase and SOD prevented cell damage effectively. SOD when given alone may rather damage than protect aelnar cells when H202 is generated in concentrations overwhelming the capacity of endogenous catalase. Therapeutic approaches to pancreatic disease using antioxidants should, therefore, include combinations of protective substances. The lazaroids seem to be candidates for clinical use as antioxidants in pancreatitis.

The natural history of such infection is either resolution without clinical sequelae, which is uncommon, abscess formation, or generalized peritonitis, which occurs as a result of failure of peritoneal host defenses. Early clearance of microorganisms by peritoneal fluid circulation and filtration througti subdiaphragmatic lymphatics into the thoracic duct and systemic circulation occurs as well. Simultaneously peritoneal macrophages and the omentum approach the area of inflammation and lead to neutrophil influx and abscess formation adjacent to the affected viscus. We have found a shift in peritoneal macrophage function from antigen presentation to proinflarnmatory cytokine production that occurs early after experimental peritonitis produced by cecal ligation and puncture. This is also reflected by reduced class II histocompatibility antigen expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and peritoneal macrophages. This is accempauied by an influx of both neutrophils and macrophages into the peritoneum and subsequent abscess formation. Interestingly, there is little serum endotoxin or TNF seen in this model despite TNF mRNA expression in peritoneal macrophages. We believe this model is more clinically relevant than other models of endotoxemia or bacteremia in which different patterns of cytokine expression are seen. Newer agents aimed at reduction of systemic manifestations of sepsis originating from intra-abdominal infection such as monoclonal antibodies against cytokines or IL-1 receptor antagonists may need to be directed against remote organ macrophage populations while preserving peritoneal macrophage function.",

Methods: Patients were studied in a 6 to 10 hours period during their first surgical intervention because of intraabdominal infection. All were monitored for their cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic and renal function. Plasma samples for LPS. TNFa and IL-6 determination were drawn preoperatively, intraoperatively, and until 2h postoperatively in regular intervals (min 7/pat), Results: Preoperative APACHE II was 12 in median (rain 4, max 25). 10 patients fulfilled the criteria of SIRS. 4 of them were in septic shock.There was a significant correlation between preoperative TNFa and APACHE II (p=0,000 I, Spearman coefficient). Preoperative cardiovascular (systol.

The severe immunosuppresslon often seen in patients with severe trauma or large burns may predispose these patients to life threatening infections. Included among the many Immune alterations are changes In the Functional capabilities of neutrophlls (PMNs). We have examined the expression of the p 2 integrins (CD1 l a, b,c/CD18), and the Fc'?R (CD16, CD32, and CD64), as well as several functional parameters, on PMNs from thermal and non-thermal traumatic injury, PMNs were obtained from patients sustaining severe trauma (initial APACHE II score >10) or thermal injury (>30~ total body surface area, 15% full thickness), and healthy controls. The expression of CD11 b and c and to a lesser degree CDI 1 a was significantly reduced on PMNs. The expression of CD16 and CD32 but not CD64 was also significantly reduced. PMNs displaying this reduction In receptor expression have a significantly reduced ability to phagocytose bacteria and undergo the oxidative metabolic burst response. Thermal and traumatic injury result In global reduction in the expression of 132 integrins and FoR which may lead to decreased functional capabilities, These abnormalities may In turn account at least In part for the Increased rate of Infection in these patlems,",

These alterations reflect changes developing in the hemopoietic compartment. A release to the circulation of mature forms of cells and accelerated maturation in the BM and lymphoid organs, followed in the case of prolonged stress by the release of immature ceils, is a commonly seen process. Our question was whether operative trauma produces changes in the hematopoietic centers resulting in a release of progenitor ceils to blood. The study was carried out in 10 patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained before, and 1, 3, 7 and 14 days after operation and their phenotypes identified with monoclonal antibodies in FACS (B&D). Results: A slight increase in the percentage of CD1 + (dendritic cells with thymocyte antigen) was seen on days I and 3. An evident rise in the percentage of CD45RO + (memory cells), CD13 +, CD14 +, CD33 + (myeinid lineage cells), CD34 + and CD38 + (stem, pre-B, myeloid ceils), TdT+ (pro-B, pro-T, thymocyte cells) were observed, mostly on days 1-7. More HLA-DR + ceils were noted. There was a slight drop in the percentage of CD3 +, CD4 + and CD8 + ceils. No changes were seen in CD22 +, CD23 + (B) as well as CD11a/18 + and CD44 + cell populations.Discussion: Results of these studies indicate that operative trauma of intermediate degree (general anaesthesia, no blood tx) causes an appearance in blood of stem cells, immature myeloid lineage cells and pre-B ceils. This rapid response of the BM compartment lasts for 1-3 days. The mobilization of reserves of cells of phagocytic and antigenpresenting lineage serves to eliminate host cellular antigens released from the damaged tissues and to aid healing processes. Less clear is the role of the stem cells that appear in the blood circulation. Do these cells colonize lymphoid organs and regulate proliferation of dendritic cells and lymphocytes there?Conclusions: Operative trauma causes a release from BM of stem, immature myeloid and pre-B cells. Mobilization of immature populations suggests an inadequacy of peripheral reserves of phagocytic and antigen-presenting ceils for scavenging and repair of the damaged tissues. Surg. Res.

RESULTS & DISCUSSION: Both Poloxamer 1107 and Poloxamer 188 reduced the rate of dye loss from the electroporated cells to baseline no shock conditions (p<0.01). Dextran did not induce sealing of the membrane, and the rate of dye loss was equivalent to the P~BS control.

Prmcipally, a greater decrease in IL-I and an increase in TNF after thoracotomy was observed. Larger groups of patients may show an inverse relationship between lgG and TNF in the postoperative period. 316 LEUCOCYTE AND THEIR SUBTYPE COUNT IN PERIPHERAL BLOOD AND IN THE WOUND DURING INGUINAL OPERATIONS IN SMALL CHILDREN Mattila A,Salo M.,Lisalo E,Viljanto J,Pajulo 0",

Statistics: ANOVA, non-parametric tests, Data as mean + SEM. Results. At the end of isehemia no changes in XO, MI~ or lipid peroxidatian products were observed in shock groups when compared to sham-operated animals (XO: sham: 1.57+0.4, HES: 3.14+-0.7, HES-DFO: 0.55+0.1; MI~: sham: 1.02+0.2, HES: 1.25+-0.1, HES-DFO: 1.06+_0.2; TBA-RS: sham: 2.62+-0.3, HES: 3.65+-0.3, HES-DFO: 3.34+0.4). During reperfusion, in addition to an early increase at 2 and 5 rain, XO activity after 45 man was significantly higher in HES-Shock (28.2+-4.7) as compared to sham (1.67+0.7) and HES-DFO (7.83+-1). At 45 min., MPO (sham: 1.02+-0.2, HES: 3.65+2.1) and TBA-RS (sham: 19.8+3; HES: 98.01+-8.3) were also significantly increased in HES-shock compared to sham, but prevented by HES-DFO (MPO: 1.27+0.2; TBA-RS: 13.27+0.6). Conclusion. HES-deferoxamine-conjugate inhibited XO and leukocyte activation in rats with hemorrhagic shock It also significantly prevented oxygen free radicalmediated membrane injury. Current experiments in our laboratory investigating hepatocyte Ca 2+ regulation and changes in PMNL-radical metabolism are also showing protecting effects of HES-DFO. HES-DFO seems to be a promising approach in therapy of hypovolemic shock states since it not only restores macroand microhemodynamics, but also attenuates concomitant oxidant injury observed during reperfusion events.

Results: No significant changes in WBC and BM cell numbers were seen while a decrease in SPL cell number on days 7 and 14 was noted. Analysis of BM revealed a significant rise in the percentage of cells of lymphoid and myeloid lineage (including myeloblasts and myelocytes in the latter) on days 3 and 7 after BT. At the same time a drop in the percentage of cells of erythroid lineage (including early and intermediate normoblasts) was observed. Monoclonal antibody analysis showed a significant elevation in the percentage of OX7 \u00f7 stem cells in BM at 3 and 7 days, in SPL at 3 days and in B at 7 and 14 days after BT. Further analysis of lymphoid and myeloid cell populations within OX7 \u00f7 BM cells revealed that the rise could be atributed to lymphoid cells. The percentage of ED1 + monocytes increased in B 3 days after BT. The percentage of OX12 + B cells had risen in BM at 7 days and in B at 7 and 14 days post-transfnsian. There was a significant decrease in the percentage of OX6 \u00f7 class II antigen positive cells in BM at 3, 7 and 14 days and an increase in SPL 3 days after BT. No changes in T, helper/inducer, suppressor/eytotoxic and IL2-R \u00f7 cells were seen through the entire observation period. Interestingly, a significant drop in the responsiveness of B, SPL and BM lymphocytes to PHA by 47-58%, ConA by 59-76% and PWM by 41-68% was observed after BT. In conclusion, BT caused an increase of BM lymphoid and myeloid compartments as well as a rise in the percentage of OX7 \u00f7 stem cells in BM, followed by a release of OX7 + stem ceils to the blood circulation. Decreased responsiveness of B, SPL and BM lymphocytes to mitogens may partly reflect a diminished frequency of immnnocompetent cells due to dilution by less mature EM cells and possibly a suppressive effect of these cells on circulating lymphocytes.

The modulation of some immune parameters with an arginine, RNA and omega-3-fatty acids supplemented enteral diet after surgery for upper gastrointestinal malignancies was investigated in a prospective double-blinded study. Patients (n=42) were fed postoperatively either with the arginine, RNA and omega-3-fatty acids enriched diet or an isocaloric and isonitrogenous placebo diet. The cytokines IL-1, IL-2 and IL-2 receptor as well as IL-6 and TNF-c~ were determined preoperatively and on postoperative days 1, 3, 7, 10 and 16. In the placebo diet group mean IL-6 levels (spontaneous stimulation) were significantly higher on postoperative days 3 and 7 (p<0.05). TNF-ct levels (spontaneous stimulation) were significantly higher in the placebo diet group on postoperative day 7. In contrast mean 11,-2 receptor levels on postoperative days 3 and 7 and 1L-1 13 and IL-2 on postoperative day 16 were significantly higher in the supplemented diet group (p<0.05) after PHA stimulation. These data suggest, that enteral nutrition supplemented with arginine, RNA and omega-3-fatty acids positively influences the immune response and results in faster restitution of humoral immune function after surgery. 543 Clinical Outcome In Cancer Patients Postoperatively Fed With Arginine-, Omega-3-Fatty Acids And RNA Supplemented Enteral Diet M Kemen, M Senkal, H.-H Homann, U Eickhoff, V Zumtobel Supplementation of enteral diets with arginine, omega-3-fatty acids and RNA has been shown to be of benefit for patients who underwent major operations.

Department of General Surgery, University of ULm, FRS Endotoxin represents the main pathogenetic principle of gram-negative bacteria arid plays a major role in the pathogenesis of gram-negative sepsis. Endotoxin neutralizing capacity was assigned to rmnocLonat antil:x~dies of the ]gG and [gH class. However these preparations did not show any crossreactivity uith different endotoxins. The aim of the present studies was to determine endotoxin neutralizing capacity of paLyclonaL ]gN at different [gM concentrations in comparison with HA-1A antibody and pure ]gg preparations. By use of the Limutus amebocyte tysate test no effect of the monoctonal preparation HA-1A could be established. The same fact passes for pure IgG preparations. PolyctonaL IgH was found to neutralize endotoxin together with plasma of healthy volunteers in a linear concentration dependent manner up to 50% at the highest concentration tested. The effect of IgA was less pronounced, whereas IgG did not neutralize significantly. [gM with plasma of septic patients however lead to an increase of endotoxicity as determined by the LAL test. The same results were seen in a controlled randomized study with patients suffering from peritonitis. Endotoxin plasma values mere significantly increased in the verum group already 2 h after start of IgM infusion. Endotoxin induced cytokine release from whole blood was again not influenced by HA-1A or IgG even at doses up to 5 mg/mt of blood. IgH inhibited the release of I[-1, I[-6, and TgF in a concentration dependent manner. In conclusion paLyc[onaL IgH are able to influence endotoxicity in the LAL test and can reduce endotoxin induced cytokine retease by whole blood\u2022 No effects were observed by monoclona( lgH and po[yclonal [gg preparations.603 EARLY IMMUNOGLOBULIN THERAPY IN APACHE II SCORE-IDENTIFIED POST-CARDIAC SURGICAL PATIENTS AT RISK FOR SEPSIS.

PGE is produced by many cell types including fibroblasts, macrophages, monocytes, follicular dendritic cells, and epithelial cells and is induced by IL-I, bacterial LPS, components of the complement cascade, TNF, IL-6 and cross-linking of surface Fc receptors for IgG, IgA and IgE. Our research has shown that PGE inhibits B lymphocyte activation (enlargement, class II MHC and Fc RII expression), proliferation, IgM and IgG3 responses while greatly increasing class switching to IgE. Thus, PGE acts through cAMP and inducible regulatory proteins to inhibit a number of immune mechanisms while promoting IgE production.

Adhesion of inflammatory cells to EC adhesion molecules may play a role in inflammatory cell activation. We asked if CDllb receptor activation affected monocyte intracellular ionized calcium ([Ca++]i), a common first step in cell activation. Human monocytes from healthy donors were harvested on Ficoll, incubated 35 min. in 5 ug/ml Fura-2AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), washed & resuspended in extracellular buffer. 4x106 cells were placed in 1 cc cuvettes in a fluorometer. Either 5 ug/ml of phytohemagglutinin (PHA-binds to several different receptors that transduce signals via [Ca++]i ) or i0 ng/ml of anti-CDllb monoclonal antibody (mAb-Ortho) were added. Anti-CDllb mAb caused a 10-20 sec. burst in [Ca++]i of 23+5 nM compared to 79_+9 for PHA (N=6, p<0-\u2022 01. ) The spike was monophasic and morphologically different from PHA's. It was unaffected by Ca ++ removal from buffer, and could not be blocked by prior PHA. Anti CDllb mAb caused a [Ca++]i activation signal in monocytes. Adhesion of monocytes to EC's and wound matrix proteins may not be a passive process but may cause important activation signals\u2022 H.J.

Ashton, and Perry V.Halushka, Departments of Physiology and Pharmacology and Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425 U,S.A. Previous studies have suggested that endotoxin tolerance induces macrophage desensitization to endotoxin (LPS) through altered guanine nucleotide regulatory (G) protein function. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that LPS tolerance decreases G-protein content. Total Gprotein content of macrophage membranes from LPS tolerant and control rats was determined using the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue GTP3'[35S]. Crude membranes were prepared from peritoneal macrophages harvested from rats 72 hours after two sequential daily doses of vehicle or Salmonella en teritidis LPS (100~tg/kg on day 1 and 500/.tg/kg on day 2). GTPT[35S] bound to a single site that was saturable and displaceable in control and endotoxin tolerant macrophage membranes. The maximum specific binding of GTPT[35S] was significantly decreased in membranes from tolerant rats compared to controls. There were no significant differences in the K d values. Non Tolerant The apparent amount of both Gi~ and Gs( ~ in the membranes of endotoxin tolerant cells was decreased compared to controls as determined by Western blotting with specific antisera to Gia and Gsa. In contrast, the apparent total cellular homogenate Gic ( and Gsa content were increased in macrophages from tolerant rats. The results demonstrate that endotoxin tolerant macrophages exhibit decreased membrane GTP binding capacity and decreased membrane expression of Gia and Gsa. These observations raise the possibility that these alterations in G proteins may contribute to the broad desensitization of multiple responses in endotoxin tolerance(Supported in part by NIH GM 27673).

However PMN activated by exogenous or endogenous inflammatory mediators can induce EC necrosis. Thus activated PMN play an important role in EC necrosis and this interaction may be central to the development of increased vascular permeability and subsequent organ injury during sepsis.

J.T.M. Frieling, M. v. Deuren, J. Wijdenes, C.J.v.d. Linden, R.W. SauerweinObjects of the study: Cytokines are well known mediators-in sepsis. However, it has become evident that not only the cytokine itself but also circulating cytokinereceptors and cytekine/cytokiaereceptor complexes are involved in the eventual biological effects of cytokines. In this study levels of IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor (slL-6R) are measured in septic patients and compared with levels in healthy volunteers. Materials and methods: Bloodsamples of 2I patients with the sepsis syndrome according to the Bone criteria are drawn sequentially during a seven hour time period starting just before the first antibiotic gift. As a control one bloodsample is drawn from 19 healthy volunteers, sIL-6R and IL-6 are measured using sandwich ELISA's. Both ELISA's are not influenced by the addition of either IL-6 or sIL-6R. Results: Levels of slL-6R in normals are 81.0 -+ 19.4 ng/ml (mean + SD). IL-6 levels in normals are all below 20 U/mL In septic patients IL-6 levels range from 21-810,000 U/ml. Median levels of IL-6 in nan-survivors are significantly higher than those in survivors (p = 0.04). sIL-6R levels in septic patients are 48.6 _+ 27.7 ng/ml (mean +_ SD). This is significantly lower than the control group (p < 0.01). Levels of sIL-6R in survivors do net significantly differ from those in non-survivors (p = 0.22). IL-6 and sIL-6R concentrations are negatively correlated (correlation coefficient is -0.76).Conclusions: sIL-6R is present in high concentrations in the circulation of healthy volunteers. In septic patients the sIL-6R concentration is significantly lower compared with normals. High IL-6 levels are associated with low s]L-6R levels in septic patients.University Hospital Nijmegen, Department of Surgery P.O. Box 9101, 6500 HB Nijmegen The Netherlands",

The aim of this study was to investigate whether chronic exposure of the rat cardiomyoctes to plasma of patients with heart failure or sepsis may have a TNFu-dependent effect on cardiomyocyte GDH activity. After pretreatment of rat cardiomyocytes for 72 hours with plasma of intensive care patients in the absence or presence of TNF~ antibodies, cardiomyocyte GDH activity was determined. Among the 16 patients included, a TNFu-mediated decrease in GDH activity by more than i0 % was induced by plasma of 8 patients.The TNFudependent decrease in cardiomyocyte GDH activity was not correlated to the plasma TNFu level The data indicate that the effect of patient's plasma on cardiomyocyte GDH activity depends on the relative concentrations of plasma TNF~ and soluble TNF-receptors in the patient's plasma. Thus, the TNF~/soluble TNF-receptor ratio may be a marker which reflects the TNFa bioactivity in the plasma of intensive care patients. DURING SEPSIS AND CANCER K. Wronger, J. Baler*, B, Modion, E.

These processes may be modulated by several cytokines in clinical situations. In this study we evaluated the relationship between the serum level of G CSF and the peripheral neutrophil kinetics {functienalandcytoeh~micalbehaviors) after surgical stress. <Methods and Materials> We investigated peripheral neutrophil functions (C3bi-receptor expression, supercxide production), neutrophil alkaline phosphatase activity (NAP) as an endogeneeus z~aturation marker, end sermm G CSF concentrations in i0 patients after surgery. <Results> Seru~m G-CSF increased dramatically within 24 hours after operation. In thisperiod, the rapid increases in theneutrophil counts were accompanied by the increases in C3bi receptor expression and superoxide pro<9~ction by the circulating neutrophils. The NAP activity of the neutrophils in the circulation decreased up to 4 hours after operation, foll~edbythe significant increases of NAP scores of the neutrophils 24 hours later. When the neutrophil counts returned to preoperative levels, the circulating neutrphils had highi~Pactivity. <Conclusions> Because G-CSF is suggested to be a pivotal modulator of the NAP in neutrophil, G-CSF elevated after surgical stress may accelerate the kinetics of the peripheral neutrophil, in addition to stimulate tbecirculatingneutrophil function.

            "text": "A murine-anti-human TNF-monoclonal antibody known as CB6 was the first ANTI-tnf MaB which was studied in a phase II multinational trial in the treatment of patients with severe sepsis.This was an open-label, dose-escalation trial consisting of 80 patients who were enrolled into one of four treatment groups: (1) 0.1 mg/kg of anti-TNF mAb, (2) 1.0 mg/kg, (3) 10 mg/kg or (4) 1.0 mg/kg at study entry and the second dose 24 hours later. The small sample size in each group (n=20) precludes detailed statistical inference in this study. Nonetheless, a considerable amount of useful information was obtained from this investigation. irst, this study demonstrated the clinical feasibility of specific anticytoldne therapy in septic patients. Second, the measurement systemic levels of TNF proved to be an elusive target; Interleukin-6 may prove to be a more useful indicator of cytokine activation. Third, immunologic reactions including TNF: anti-TNF mAb immune complexes and human anti-routine antibodies were frequently found in these patients. Despite their apparent lack of overt toxicity in this study, these immunologic reactions may complicate this form of anticytokine therapy. Additionally, the potential benefits of anti-TNF mAb therapy occur within the first 48 hours of therapeutic administration in these septic patients. Infecting organisms differ in their potential to induce TNF in vitro and these differences correlate with circulating TNF levels observed in septic patients. Rapid methods to define those patients most likely to respond to anticytokine therapy are needed to determine the ultimate therapeutic potential of these agents in clinical medicine. Wherry, J., Abraham E., Wunderink R., Silverman H., Perl T., Nasraway S., Levy H., Bone R., Wenzel R., Balk R., Allred R., Pennington J. and the TNFa MAb Sepsis Study Group.TNFa MAb (Bay x1351) is a murine monoclonal antibody raised against human tumor necrosis factor. TNF~ MAb has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in animal models of septic shock and has been safely administered to septic and non septic patients.To evaluate the efficacy and safety of TNF~ MAb in patients with sepsis syndrome, a prospective, multicentered, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 31 hospitals in North America. Patients were prospectively stratified into shock or nonshock groups and then randomized to receive a single intravenous infusion either of 15 mg/kg TNF~ MAb, 7.5 mg/kg TNF~ MAb or placebo (0.25% human albumin).Patients received standard aggressive medical/surgical care during the 28 day post dosing period.The three treatment arms were well balanced with respect to demographics, APACHE II score and other parameters. For all infused sepsis syndrome patients, those who received TNF~ MAb had slightly reduced 28 day all cause mortality compared to placebo. Among shock patients there was a more pronounced trend towards efficacy at day 28 post dosing with lower mortality rates in both active treatment arms. Among nonshock patients TN~ MAb did not appear beneficial. The initial clinical experience with a chimeric anti-TNF monoclonal antibody, cA2, was undertaken in septic patients. The objectives of the study were to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics and effects on cytokine levels of cA2. as a single infusion or in combination with HA-1A in septic patients. The study was conducted with the intent to progress to an efficacy trial based on the information collected.The trial was conducted in three stages. Stage 1 was an open label trial in which 4 groups of 5 patients each with the clinical diagnosis of sepsis received ascending doses of cA2 (0.1, 1, 5, 10 mg/kg). Stage 2 was a randomized, double blind study in which patients received a single dose of HA-1A (100 mg) and placebo or one of 3 doses of cA2 (1,5,10 mg/kg). Stage 3 was a randomized, double blind study in which patients received a single dose of placebo or one of 3 doses of cA2 (0.1, 1, 10 mg/kg). In addition to usual laboratory tests, the following assays were performed: chimeric anti-TNF concentration, anti-chimeric antibody, endotoxin, TNF, IL-1, and IL-6 levels.A total of 141 patients were enrolled from 13 clinical sites (20 in stage 1, 60 in stage 2 and 61 in stage 3). Primary analyses were performed on patients in stage 1 and 3. There were 65 patients who received cA2 exclusively and 16 patients received placebo. Administration of cA2 was well tolerated at doses up to 10 mg/kg. No patient discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Human anti-chimeric antibody responses were positive in 61% (30/49) of evaluated patients. Mean Cma \u00d7 and AUC increased proportionally with increasing doses of cA2. The mean half-life was -70 hrs (58-96 hrs). A dose related decrease in TNF concentration was observed 1 hr post infusion of cA2. TNF is considered to be one of the central endogenous mediators for the inili'ation of the pathophysiological changes in patients with sepsis and septic shock. High TNF levels were demonstrated to correlate with patient outcome. Blocking or neutralising TNF with specific antibodies was effective in preventing death in some animal modets of sepsis. In a placebo controlled prospective randomized study we tested the mur~ne derived antibody MAK 195F. It is a F(ab')2 fragment. The fragment rather the complete antibody was selected in order to reduce the potential immunogenicity and to facilitate tissue penetration. 122 patients with severe sepsis or septic shdck were enrolied in the study, three different doses of MAK 195F or placebo were administered (0,1; 0,3 and I mg/kg) over a perid of 72 hours in random order. The patients were evaluated for side effects, hemodynamics, organ dysfunction, cytokines (IL 6, IL 8 and TNF), and outcome. At this time only an interim analysis of 60 patients is available I indicating that MAK 195F in all 3 dosage groups resulted in a decrease in IL 6. This contrasted to a further in crease of IL 6 in the placebo patients. No serious side effects have been reported so far. A more detailed analysis on all 122 patients in the study will be presented and discussed.$152 S154 Staubach,K.H., Otto, V., Kooistra,A,, RosenfeId,J.A., Bruch, H.P., Univ. Lfibeek, Germany Once endotoxinemia occurs in sepsis a vieieus cycle with translocation of ET can be established. Increasing the clearance capacity for ET would therapeutically be the ulimate aim. We developed a new ET on-line adsorption (AD) system in whole blood by means of Polymyxin B (PB) coupled eovalently to a matrix (acrylic particles) via a 13 atom-chain spacer. The detoxification capacity was 150 ug[ET/ml column material. The biocompatbility resulted in 90~ platelet recovery. The column contained 7 ml of ADmaterial and was sterilized by high steam autoclave, Anticoagulation was achieved by heparine 1.000 IU/h in the inflowline after bolus injection of 5.000 IU. HP was performed on 8 pigs at a rate of 50 ml/min by means of a roller-pump until the animals succumbed (H). 8 animals served as controls (C). Serum ET levels rose from 3.40 pg/ml to 74,9 pg/ml after 5 hours in the C and from 2.77 pg/ml only to 28 pg/ml in the H group after 7 hours whieh was highly significant. Survival time could be extrended from 216 to 313 min. Results are listed in the following L. Blinzler, P. Zaar, M. Leier, R. B(2rger, D.

            "text": "MOF seems to be generated by cascade-activation of immune competent cells and plasmatic mediators (e.g. bmdykinin, eicosanoides, cytokines, anaphylatoxins, etc.). Therapeutic approaches aim to inactivate or eliminate single substances. CWH with high-flux membranes in combination with high-volume exchange allows elimination of many mediators with different molecular weight and therefore may contribute to improve the prognosis of MOF. Other significant advantages of this teqalnique like adequate nutrition, optimized fluid balance and control of body temperature should not be negicctod. Introductioni Pseudomonas (P) aeruginosa has to be considered an important pathogen of nosocomial pneumonia and septic organ failure. The lung seems to be the predominant target organ for the pore-forming P. aeruginosa cytotoxin, thus inducing microvascular injury. With respect to therapeutical consequences, the potential protective effects of PAF-antagonist (WEB 2086), cyelooxygenase inhibitor (diclofenac) and specific and unspecific antibodies on cytotoxin-induced pulmonary vascular reaction and mediator release were studied in the isolated perfused rabbit lung. Methods: Cytotoxin (6p_g/ml) was administered into the perfusion fluid in all groups, either in the absence of inhibitors (n=6), or after pretreatment with WEB 2086 (5xl0-gM, n=6), or diclofenac (10#g/ml, n-6). Furthermore, the application of specific antitoxin (mg/ml, n=6) was tested in comparison with the unspecific immunoglobulins (Venimmun\u00ae, Behring, 7.5 mg/ml) (n=6) and the combination of immunogiobulins, WEB 2086 and diclofenac (n=6). Six experiments without toxin served as controls. The arterial pressure mad the weight gain as an indicator of edema formation were continuously monitored during the three hour peffusion phase. Arachidonic-ucid metabolites, as well as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and K + concentrations were determined at 30 rain intervals. Results: Cytotoxin caused a gradual increase in pulmonary arterial pressure, reaching a maximum value of 2.5 times higher than the control, starting after 1 min and a delayed onset of edema formation resulting in a mean weight gain of 20 g after 120 min. This was paralleled by a significant increase in prostacyclin generation and a continuous release of K + and LDH. Thromboxane synthesis exceeded about 10 times that of controls in the toxin treated lungs. Pretreatment with WEB 2086 or diclofenac significantly attenuated the pressure response and edema formation evoked by cytotoxin. The addition of the unspecific immunognbulin preparation alone induced a transient pressure increase within the first minutes, but mean values remained below those of the cytotoxin group in the continuing observation period. Mmost complete inhibition of the pressure reaction, the edema formation and the metabolic alterations was achieved mainly by the combination of immunoglobulin, WEB 2086 and diclofenac and to lesser extend by the specific toxin antibody. Conclusion: The current results point towards the crucial role of PAF and AA-metabolites as mediators of cytotoxin induced microvascular injury. The systemic or local application of cytotoxin antibodies or even unspecific immunoglobolins in combination with PAF-antagonist and diclofenac appears to be a promising therapeutic approach in the case of infection with cytotoxin-preducing strains. Cytokines have long been shown to be of particular importance in the metabolic derangements occurring in LPS-induced shock. Recent studies strongly imply the involvement of Platelet Aggregating Factor (PAF) in the pathogenesis of Gram-negative bacterial sepsis. An autocatalytic feedback network has been postulated to exist between PAF and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF), a key cytokine involved in septic metabolic cascade, leading to an uncontrolled amplification of inflammatory mediator release. We have previously shown that ST 899 (4-N,N,N trimethylammonium-(R)-3-isovaleroyloxy-butanoic acid Z-3-(5-chlorphtalidiliden) ethyl ester bromide) was quite effective in inhibiting the \"in vitro\" binding of 3H-PAF (Ki=7.5x10 -8 M) to rabbit platelets. The present study shows that pretreatment of C57BL/6 mice with ST 899, administered by different routes, dose-dependently and significantly reduces the lethality induced by endotoxin (E.coli 055:B5 injected at 30 mg/kg intraperitoneally). Very interestingly, ST 899 administered at the same doses as above (i.e. 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg body weight) results to be significantly effective in reducing the endotoxin-induced release of serum TNF. The reported dual activity of ST 899 (i.e. PAF antagonism and decreased circulating TNF levels) may turn out to be greatly beneficial, in combination with current therapies, in the treatment of diseases that involve overproduction of TNF and PAF such as septic shock. Introduction: Recently, we reported that prophylactic whole body hyperthermia (42.5\u00b0C) induces heat shock protein ('ASP) 72 and increases smvival 2-4 fold in a mouse endotoxin model (Am. J. Physiol. in press). Other investigators reported that prophylactic pharmacologic induction of HSP-72 by sodium arsenite improves survival in a rat sepsis model (abstract A95 Am. Rev. Resp. Dis. Vol. 147, 1993) . The effects of heat are complex and in addition to formation of liSP-72 include release of cytokines, changes in cellular pH etc. Thus, the protective mechanisms of heat may differ from those due to pharmacologically induced . The purpose of this study was to compare the protection of heat vs the protection of pharmacologically induced HSP-72 in a mouse endotoxin model to determine if different protective mechanisms were likely to be involved.. i%'lethods: Both sodium arsenite (10 mg/kg) and ethanol (400 ~1 of 39% ethanol) caused marked induction of HSP-72 in lung, gut, kidney, and liver, which was comparable to heat-induced HSP-72. Female ND4 mice weighing 22-25 gms were pretreated with arsenite or alcohol 8 hours prior to challenge with Escherichia coli endotoxin (-LD 80) and survival was compared to control mice.",

(p<0.01) (n=25 mice per group). However, at 7 days post endotoxin, there were no differences in survival in the 3 groups, i.e., ~ 4% survival for all 3 groups. In contrast, the protective effect of hyperthermia remains present at 7 days, i.e., ~ 70% survival vs 20% survival control. Conclusion: The protective effect of heat is probably due to other factors such as the effect of hyperthermia to release IL-lc~ and is not due solely to HSP-72 formation. It was the aim of the study to examine whether bacteria play a causative role in the pathogenesis of anastomotic insufficiency following gastrectomy in man.The study was carried out in form of a prospective, randemised, double-blind, multicenter trial. Primary endpoints were the rate of anastomotic insufficiencies, infectious-and uncomplicated postoperative courses. All pat. received a periop, i.v. prophylaxis with Cefotaxim. Identical numbered vial either contained Placebo or Polymyxin B, Tobramycin, Vancomycin and Amphotericin B . The vials were administered 4X per day from the day be ~ fore the operation until the 7th postop, day. Insufficiencies were detected by gastrographin swallow and recorded by X-ray on day 7 postop.. Evaluation was carried out on an \"intention to treat'basis. Statistical analysis was done with the Pearson's Chi Square and Fisher's Exact Tests~ Results: Interim analysis was carried out in 3/93 after 137 pat. had been recruited. Along with a significant reduction of S.aureus and enterobacteria there was a reduction in the rate of anastomotic insufficiency of the esophago-jejunostomy from 10.6 % in the Placebo-group to 3.5 % in the treatment group. The difference was not yet significant. The rate of nosocomial infections (e.g. respiratory tract infection and UTI) were significantly reduced from 33.3 % in the Placebo-group to 16.4 % in the Treatment-group (p ~ 0.0281;Fisher's Exact Test). In march 1994 final results with more than 200 patients will be presented for the first time. (= pO2 <80 mm Hg, b s-creatinin >2 mg%). Respiratory insufficiency was the most frequent systemic complication followed by sepsis and respiratory insufficiency. Etiology of pancreatitis and initial serum increase of pancreatic enzymes predicted neither complications nor outcome. Only 2 of 14 deaths occurred during the 1st week, all other deaths occurred late (after 4-12 weeks), generally as the consequence of septic complications and multi-organ failure. High levels of CRP were correlated with a compliacted course and a fatal outcome. Although same cytokines (e.g. 11--6) were found increased in severe disease, the predictive value of these markers was not better than the combination of ctinical scores (Ranson, Imrie, APACHE II) with GT or CRP. CONCLUSIONS: Intensive care medicine can often control the inital shock situation in severe pancreatitis. Thus. only 15% of deaths today occur eady in the course of the disease, whereas this percentage varied between 40-70% just 10 years ago. Nowadays, most deaths are caused by late septic complications and multi-organ failure. Ranson-and CT-scores as well as serum CRP predict a course with systemic complications; they are less helpful for prediction of sepsis and late mortality. It is doubtful whether measurements of cytokines will help to better predict the late outcome. As yet, only careful and continuous monitoring of patients (e.g. by APACHE scores) may help to early identify those who develop septic complications and multi-organ failure.",

            "text": "The classic description of severe acute pancreatitis has hinged upon the release of large volumes of activated enzymes into the peritoneal cavity and thertce the lymphatics and blood stream. These activated enzymes escape from the pancreas due to disruption of cells with associated ischaemia and occasional infarction of tissue. For 20 to 25 years it has been postulated that the bocly's defence system to activated pancreatic enzymes required supplementation iu the form of anti-protease support either in the vascular space or in the peritoneal cavity. All controlled studies have shown that this is either impracftcal or unnecessary.Hore recently release of a large number of cytokines from monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils have been considered to be harmful to the body and various agent~ which oppose the action of TNF alpha, PAF and similar cytokines are being examined in experimental anim~is and certain clinical trials, It has clearly been shown that higher levels of cytokines are released in the patients with objectively graded severe acute pancreatitis than in those with milder disease. We now seem to be moving into an exciting phase of potentially beneficial therapy in acute pancreatitis which has had no specific effective therapy through studies utilising aprotinin, gabexate mesilate and fresh frozen plasma. Inflammation cascades may play a role in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. To evaluate the status of the cellular immune system we examined serum concentrations of immune activation markers in 24 patients with acute pancreatitis (14 males, 10 females; median age: 56 years, range: 32-81 years). Concentrations of neopterin, serum soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor (sTNF-R) and serum soluble intercellular adhesion molecule type 1 (slCAM-1) were determined using immunoassays (Henning, Bender, T Cell Sciences). 13/14 had increased concentrations of sTNF-R compared to the 75th percentile obtained in healthy controls (>4.2 ng/ml), and 9/24 patients had increased neopterin (> 8.7 nmol/I), 9/24 presented with elevated slCAM-1 (>440 U/I). All patients with increased neopterin also had increased sTNF-R, 4 patients had concentrations of all three markers outside the normal range. There existed a significant correlation between neopterin and sTNF-R (rs = 0.728, p < 0.001 ). Weak associations between age and sTNF-R (rs=0.435, p=O.05) or neopterin (rs=0.456, p = 0.044) were also found. Our results demonstrate activation of the cell-mediated immune system taking place in a sub-group of patients with acute pancreatitis. The finding of increased neopterin and sTNF-R levels implies that activated monocytes/macrophages are involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Further data are necessary to evaluate potential associations between changes of marker concent-rations and the course of the disease. Pancreatic injury after heart surgery was reported as soon as 1970 ( 1,2) and characterized by increased serum or urine amylase levels (in about 33% of patients) in the 5 fi~t postoperafi.'ve days. This pancreatic injury, which sometimes led to acute pancreatitis, was atreaay at~buted to inappropriate perfusion of this organ. In the 198ffs, 3 studies were published dealing with pancreatic suffering alter heart surgery, in large series of patients, concluding ~n~at panc~a~c injury (with a low incidence of pancreatifis) is more common than previously recognized and is a potential source of complication after camliac surgery (3, 4, 5) . In a recent study (6), evidence of pancreatic cellular injury was found in 80 out of 300 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, with 22 out of these 80 patients presenting abdominal signs or symptoms and 3 developing severe pancreafitis. This injury was associated w~th preoperative renal insufficiency, valve surgery, ~..stoperalive hytxXension, calcium administered periopuratively and length of bypass. We studied 300 patients submitted to cardiopulmunary bypass (CPB) for heart surgery and used the measurement of uN:~sin, pancreatic iso-amylase and lipase in plasma for biochemical characterization of pancreatic cellular injury. Blood samples were obtained before surgery, directly aller surgery (return to inte~ve care unit), 8 hours alter surgery and in the folfowing days alter surgery (days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8). Computed tomography scan of pancreas was performed in patients presenting hi~ levels of amylase on day 1. We measured abnormal levels of trypsin and pancTeatic iso-amylase in 30% of patients and observed 2 simultaneous releases of these 2 enzymes, the fi,'st one in the 24 hours after surgery and the second more intense from day 4 and pa~icularly on day 8 after smgery. This second release was concomitant with abnormal levels of llpase. These biochemical observations were accompanied by radiological and clinical signs of pancreatic injury in about 2% of our patients : pancrealic abnormalities were revealed by scan in 7 patients and acute pancreatitis in I patient. More pronounced pancreatic suffering was observed in patients undergoing valve replacement than in patients undergoing coronam-anrtic bypass grafm~g. Analysis of trypsin and pare're, tic 1so-amylase are sw.cific of pancreatic cellular injury and their simultaneous ir~rease in plasma alter CPB in our padents confirms the presence of an exocrine pancreatic injury. The presence of a simultaneous peak of lipase mcaezse~ the specificity of overt pancreatic injtu 7 diagnosis. The precise cause of th/s injury could he related to hypoperfnsion leading to ischemic injury of foe splancbnic area, pancreas being largely sensible to hypoperfnsion (7). This hypoperfosion could he responsible for the ftmt release of pancrealac enzymes observed in our patients and would contribute to the deterioration of other organs leading to an inflammatory reaction developing in the following days and responsible for the second release of pancreatic enzymes observed in our patients. Patients with necrotizing pancreatitis show a heigh rate of pulmonary, renal and septic complications, whereas the course in acute interstitial pancreatitis is generally very mild. We have prospectively analysed the value of Endotoxin, Interleukin-6(IL-6) and Transferrin in compare with c-reactive protein(CRP) for the early assessment of the severity of acute pancreatitis. Patients aud methods: The values of Endotoxin(measured by limulus-lysate-test), II-6(ELISA), transferrin and CRP (nephelometry) were analysed daily along the first i0 days of hospitalisation by 28 patients with acute pancreatitis admitted to our Hospital from 4/1991 to 4/1993 . It was judged whether the patients have either interstitial (AIP) (n=9) or necrotizing (ANP) (n=lg) pancreatitis. 5 patients with ANP have died during the course of pancreatitis (Mortality=17.5%). Results: 1-Severity o~ Pancreatitis: Signifcant differences (P<O.05, Mann-Whitney test) could be calculated between AIP and ANP for endotoxin, IL-6, transferrin and CRP during the I0 days of monitoring. 2-Mortality: Except of IL-6 on days 2, 3, 4 and 5 after ad-mission there were no significant differences between the values of analysed parameters in patients who survived and those values in patients who died. 3-Organ failure: The patients with pulmonary, renal or multiorgan failure have significantly heigher values of endotoxin, IL-6 and CRP along the I0 days of monitoring in compare with those patients without an organ failure. Conclusions: Endotoxin, IL-6 and Transferrin, an important endotoxin carrier, are promising parameters to differentiate between the severe and mild form of pancreatitis comparable with CRP. This parameters may be helpfull in the early clinical assessment of patients with acute panereatitis. The determination of cytokines may elucidate the pathophysiologic mechanisms that produce early systemic complications in acute interstitial (i) or necrotizing (n) pancreatitis (AP). The appearence of respiratory insufficiency (RI) is used to appraise the early systemic complications and is compared to the results of cytokine blood levels.",

            "text": "In a prospective clinical trial from 10/92 -8/93, 23 patients with AP were recruited and blood samples taken for cytokine determination with commercial ELISA-kits. The differentiation between i (n=12) and n (n=l 1) AP was made through Ct-scan in all and laparotomy for drainage and necrosectomy in 13 patients. The etiology of AP was gallstones in 9, alcohol abuse in 7, hyperlipidemia in 2 and other or unknown causes in 5 patients.Five of 11 patients with nAP died early (n=l) or of late septic complications. None died of iAP.The peak of cytnkine level in the first three days of hospitalisation was used for calculation. RI was diagnosed in the first week of hospitalisation, if oxygenmask or iutubation for at least 3 days was nescessary to treat arterial hypoxemia. For statistical analysis U-Test of Wilcoxon, Mann and Whitney was applicated.The IL-6 concentration in blood reached up to 2600pg/ml in the first days depending on the severity of AP and dropped to almost zero in the next days, independently of the clinical course. The differentiation of i-versus nAP, using a cutoff-line of 600 pg/ml was correct in 20 patients (87%, sensitivity (SE): 82%= specificity (SP): 91%, (z:0,001). High levels of IL-6 over 500 pg/ml correlated well with the prognosis ifRI in the first week (Accuracy: 87%, SE: 80%, SP: 100%, c~: 0,001). The blood levels of IL-8 reached a maximum of 1381 pg/ml in the first days, depending on the severity of AP, and showed a correlation to the clinical course in the following days. The peak of 1l,-8 blood levels indicated correctly the severity of AP in 18 out of 23 patients using a cut offtevel of 200 pglml (Accuracy: 78%, SE: 82%, SP: 75%, ~: 0,01). There was no correlation between cytokine blood levels and mortality, Also there seemed to be no correlation between the levels of IL-6 and IL-8. In the bloodsamples of five patients with i-or nAP no c~-TNF was detectable.The blood levels of IL-6, and to a lesser extent of [L-8, can predict the severity and early systemic complications of AP in men. The excessive rise of cytokines can be explained by the stimulation of immunological cells ( macrophages, lymphocytes and endothelial cells) in the course of AP. Objectives: In an opossum model, ligation of the sphincter of Oddi or separate ligation of the bile and the pancreatic duct together leads to severe haemorrhagic pancreatffis while single ligation of the pancreatic duct causes only an exocdne atrophy. Since BO has been discussed to be a contdbutor t\u00a2, RES dysfunction, this may depdve the organism of a potent defensive mechanism thus promoting the course of pancreatitis. The present study wa,,; carded out tc develop a new method for measuring dynamic liver RES func.. tion and to test the hypothesis that BO causes a RES dysfunction. Material & Methods: 18 opossums were randomly placed in three groups. All received a central venous line. After midline laparotomy, a specially designe0 tourniquet was placed around the common hepatic duct above its junction with the pancreatic duct (group A, n=6), around the pancreatic duct (group B, n=6) or around both ducts (group C, n=6). After one week, the tourniquets were closed. Using a scintillation camera, the liver uptake of Nanocoll, a 99mTcalbumin colloid with a diameter of 25 nm, was measured before, 2,5 and 6 days after the obstruction. The curves were analysed by a computer and two parameters (R, S) were calculated using natural logarithmic regression. As a common measure for RES function, the corrected granulopexic index (a) wa,,; determined, After day 6, the pancreas of each opossum was searched for necrosis by morphometdc methods. Results: All animals survived till day 6. The opossums in groups A & 8 had a macro-and microscopic normal pancreas, while those in group C showed a severe hemorrhagic pancreatitis. The granuinpexic index showed a significan~ change to the worse starting at day 5 in group A & B (p<O,05) and at day 2 it~ group C (p<0,Ol). At day 6, RES function in group C was significantly worse than that in group A & B (p<0,01). The regression parameter R showed no significant change in groups A & B, but a highly significant decrease in group C starting at day 2 (p<0.005), thus showing a dysfunction of the hepatic RES. Conclusions: Obstruction of the hepatic or pancreatic duct alone does no{ result in immediate dysfunction of the hepatic RES, while obstruction of beth ducts does. Because only ligation of both ducts is followed by a severe hereof.. rhagic pancreatitis, RES dysfunction could be an important factor in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis and resulting organ failure.Logarithmic regressinrL has proven to be a valuable tool to analyse dynamic hepatic RES function.

There were five groups: group A (n=14) were untreated controls; group B (n=7) were given isotonic saline intraperitoneally and observed for 48 hours; group C (n=7) 2 ml x 108 E. coli intraperitoneally and observed for 48 hours; group D (n=7) were given 4 ml x 108 E. coli and observed for 48 hours; group E (n=7) 4 ml x i08 E. coli and observed for 24 hours, The rats were than killed, the spleens were removed and heparinised blood taken for immunological tests. Total T-ceils, helper T-ceils, suppressor T-cells, monocytes, and the interleukin 2 receptor were determined by monoclonal antibodies, indirect immunfluorescence, and flow cytometry (FACS analyser 11). Statistical analysis was by the t test on rank transformed data.In group B (isotonic saline) the total T-ceils increased in the blood (p=0,003) and spleen (p=0,0001 )com pared with the untreated rats (group A), In the groups with peritonitis (C, D, and E) we found highly significant rises in suppressor T-cells in the blood and spleen (both p<0,0001 ) compared with the non-infected control groups A and B. This increase was significantly higher in group D than in groups C and E.

The past SO years have brought a number of major advances in burn care. The initial advance was the discovery that burn victims required large volumes of resuscitation fluid in the initial 24 hours to maintain hsmodynamic stability, This was followed hy the dsvelopmsnt of topical antimicrohlal agents to prevent end treat infections. Next, was the reporting that early excision of burn wounds, with autografting of the excised wounds was possible.Finally, was the identification of the importance of aggrsssive nutritional support for the hypermstabolic burn patient.These advances have markedly increaesd survival rates for given burn mimes, s~ch that burns which would previously have been considered to be aniformly fetal, are now readily survivable.Thsre remain two unsolved problems in burn care, which are limiting survivability cf burn patients.The first ie ths treatment of inhalation injury. Ths sscond is how to obtain Coverage of ths maaaivsly burned patient, who has limited skin graft donor sites available.This ssssion will focus on the new treatments being developed to obtain permanent coverage of burn wounds.These include the use of various tcplcal growth \u00a3aotore which can Speed the rate of reepithelialization of wounds, Both the beneficial and dstrimental effects of using cultured karatinooyte preparations, to obtain in excess of one squats meter of a pseudoskin from a single fifteen square centimeter biopsy of unburned skin, will be discussed, Finally, the used for artificlal dermal preparations will be discussed. integumentary wound healing consists of simultaneous epithelializalion and contraction. Not long ago, it was thought that healing proceeds at an optimum fixed rate and could only be delayed. The recent explosion in molecular biology and recombinant gene techniques have produced information on the biological activity of compounds previously believed to be biologically inert. Many current attempts to modulate the rate of wound healing center on the topical application of various growth factors produced by integumentary cells or agents designed to modulate growth factor expression or response. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), plateiet derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor (TGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) have been demonstrated, both in vitro and in vivo, to stimulate the proliferation and diferentiation of their designated cells types. EGF and PDGF have been clearly demonstraled to increase the rate of wound closure in partial and full thickness wounds. PDGF also has demonstrated efficacy in the closure of recalcitrant pressure sores, whereas TGF increases the tensile strength of incisiona[ wounds and FGF stimulates angiogenesis. It appears that epidermal keratinocyte migration during wound healing depends on integrin-mediated interactions with compounds and ceils extracellular matrix. Additionally, the activities of extracellular glycoproteins such as fibronectin, fibrinogen, laminin and thrombospondin are coordinated by multiple integrins with specific distributions and binding affinities. Currently, agents which incorporate specific protein sequences essential for the interaction of the glycoproteins with the cells of the extracellular matrix are being investigated. It is has been clearly established that the rate and nature of wound healing can be influenced by the application of various agents and that sufficient quantities of these agents can be manufactured. The future challenge is to develop techniques to Now the objective evaluation of the clinical efficacy of these various agents and to employ the appropriate agents in a cost-effective manner. ",

This increased possibility for allogeneic graft and host interface in the treatment of wound brings renewed interest in the regulation of allogeneic immune response, and the effect of introducing allogeneJc cells into the wound environment on wound healing and other relevant clinical parameters. The skin, and especially the epidermis, contains many immunogenic and immunoactive cells. When allogeneic skin grafts/cells are used as wound coverage, there may be a differential profile of cytokine/growth factor release due to allospecific immune recognition and reeponse by host and graft cells within the wound/graft microenvironment This elicits the possibility of alterations in the balance of regulatory cytokines in allogeneic component grafts, which in turn may have an effect on wound healing, graft viability and systemic host status. The probability and intensity of an allogeneic response and the resultant effects are dependent upon 1) the type of allogeneic graft; split-thickness skin graft, confluent sheet of epidermis, or isolated cellular components (epidermal, dermal); 2) the degree and nature of the histoincompatibillty between donor and recipient and expression of class t and class 11 antigens on allogeneic cells; 3) the preservation technique or other manipulations of the graft or skin components which may reduce immunogenecity or immunoreactivity prior to"

Our development of a temporary living skin replacement (TLSR) addresses these issues; the TLSR consists of highly screened human neonatal fibroblasts (HF) cultured in Biobrane a, a bilayer dressing consisting of nylon mesh laminated to a thin silicone membrane which controls water-vapor transmission. Studies in our lab indicated that \"fresW ~ TLSR grafts reproducibly close full-thickness wounds in mice & perform better than BB controls. We studied wound adherence & structural/molecular properties of fresh & cryopreserved (CRYO) TLSR. METHODS: TLSRs were prepared by seeding 4000/co 2 HF in BB nylon mesh in DMEM. HF quickly attached to the nylon mesh & were allowed to proliferate 3-6 wks. Fibroblast mitochondrial activity was assayed by MTT assay. Matrix proteins were identified by immunostaining, mRNAs for specific growth factors were identified by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification, & quantitated by gel scans. BB structure was studied by scanning electron microscopy & stretching measurements pro/post CRYO. 80 grafts were CRYO'd in 10% DMSO, quick-thawed & sutured onto 2X2 cm excised full-thickness dorsal wounds on athymic mice. 40 \"fresh\" grafts were similarly placed. Controls grafts were CAS and aeellular BB. Adherence was quantitated by a device which peeled grafts from wounds at intervals following placement, using a serve motor and a strain gauge. RESULTS: PostCRYO, storage and subsequent thawing tile TLSRs maintained >60% cell viability by the MTT assay, indicating continued mitochondrial activity, and BB structure & stretchability were maintained. Multiple matrix proteins secreted and deposited in the BB nylon mesh (types l/III collagen, decorin, fibroneetin) were identified by specific immunostaining. Growth factor mRNAs in the TLSRs (aFGF, bFGF, KGF, TGF~,p~,) were present in 10-10,000X higher levels in fresh/CRYO TLSRs than in adult HCS. Grafts adhered to wounds on mice through 40 days of followup. Histologic exams on days 6-40 showed excellent vascular ingrowth and minimal inflammation. Adherence of TLSRs to wounds was >CAS adherence. Burn wound coverage in the massively burned patient remains a difficult problem.

A review of CEA applications performed by physicians using cultured outologens epithelium obtained from Blusurfaoe Teclmology, Inc. shows a marked discrepancy in the results obtained utilizing different methods of wound bed preparation. TGF-B is an important modulator coordinating complex physiological events associated with growth and development. It is assumed that TGF-B is also involved in the well-coordinated process of cutaneous wound healing by regulating proliferation, differentiation, chemotaxis and matrix deposition. The purpose of our study was to analyze the spatial and temporal pattern of TGF-B expression during granulation tissue formation in patients with accidanutl surgical trauma (monotraumata mid polytraumata) and bum wounds. After debridement (day 0), the full thickness wounds were covered with Epigard, a synthetic dressing until day 10. After this time the granulated wounds were closed by transplantation of mesh graft. Biopsies of the wound center were taken from 30 patients at the beginning of surgical treatment (day 0) and after 3, 6, and 10 days. Cryosections were stained with antibodies against TGF-fi s using the APAAP technique and -for standard histology -with Hematoxylin-Eosin. For identification of the cell type expressing TGF-6, double staining immunofluorescence experiments were conducted using antibodies specific for monocytes/macrophages, polymorphoanclear neutropkils and fibroblasts. The results showed a characteristic pattern of TGF-t~ distribution during wound development. TGF-fi appearence was mainly cell-associated znd the absolute and relative number of cells that were positive increased with lime. Infiltrating cells and developing blood vessels were most prominently stained; epithelial and T-cells showed no immuno-reactivity.

They also participate in the process of skin wound healing. Cells which traffic through the skin can be harvested from efferent lymph drained from a given area of skin. The type of migrating cells changes after trauma, heating and infection. We have developed a method for collection of human afferent lymph in lower limbs.

AIM OF THE STUDY was to characterize skin immune cells in situ and in skin lymph with use of immunohistological methods (staining, FACS). RESULTS. Group 1, cells migrating through skin: 75+4% T lymphocytes (CD3), 6+3% Langerhans and dendritic cells (CDla, HLA DR, S100), 41+9% CD4, 18+6% CD8, no B cells (CD22, 23), 74% CD45R0 (memory cells), 6+3% IL2R. Approximately 90% cells possessed CDlla and 18 antigens. CD1 lc was expressed only on large cells. The frequency of all phenotypes was different from the blood populations. Group 2, cells in skin: Langerhans cells were found only in epidermis, CD3,4 and 8, CD45R0, RB, ila/18 cells around venules, CD68 (macrophages) uniformly dispersed, no IL2R and B cells. HLA DR positive were endothelial and some dispersed mononuclear cells. Group 3, one, three and thirty days after surgical wound (simple varicous vein extirpation): high density of epidermal Langerhans cells, HLA DR positive keratinocytes and all endothelial ceils, few IL2R cells, perivenular infiltrates of CD68, 45R0 but less CD3 cells, high density of CDlla/18 cells.

            "text": "Abstract: Wound healing is a complex biologic process that is well characterized at the histological level, but its molecular regulation is poorly understood. After clot formation, inflammatory cells are rapidly drawn into the wound, followed by migration of fibroblasts and epithelial cells that divide and repopulate the wound area. During the last decade peptide growth factors and cytokine are thought to play a key role in initiating and sustaining the phase of tissue repair. These factors which are released from different cells appear to initiate the cascade of events that lead to healing. Different studys described the rapid activation of a family of proteins,named heat shock proteins (HSP) in differnt tissue that were exposed to various forms of stress (heat, toxic agents, mechanical). In this context HSP's have the ability to regulate protein folding and assembly, to transport proteins across cytoplasm and membranes, to disrupt protein complexes, to stabilize, degrade and regulate the synthesis of proteins and to take part in DNA replication and repair. We now attempted to find out if HSP-gene activation is also involved in injury and wound healing, which likewise resemble a stress situation for cells. Therefore we collected tissue samples during operation and single biopsies from chronic wounds (Decubitus for example) and granulation tissue. After RNA preparation from these samples we used RNA-PCR and Nothern analysis to study the expression of Objectives of the study Chronic, non-healing cutaneous tflcers are a challenging clinical and socioeconomic problem. Several animal studies have shown that cytukines (e.g. EGF, PDGF, FGF, TGFB) accelerate the healing process and tissue repair in general. Results from first clinical trials indicate a promising value of cytokines in the treatment of chronic non-healing diabetic and venous ulcers. Recent reports in the literature indicate that the biological activity of the solution of platlet derived wound healing formula (PDWt~) released from c~-granules (mainly PDGF & TGFI~) is greater than the activity of the recombiant single factors like e.g. PDGF-BB (Robson, Lancet 1992) . The aim of our study was to determine whether a correlation exits between the concentration of TGFI~ & PDGF and the time course of wound healing. Materials and methods PDWHF was prepared from 200ml of auto]ogous patient blood and diluted with a special buffer to a final concentration of 30 ng/ml g-thromboglobulin. The concentrations of PDGF and TGFg were determined by ELISA-tests developed in our laboratory. 22 patients with chronic non-healing ulcers have been evaluated alter treatment by topical application of PDWHF. PDFG and TGFf~ concentrations of the topical solution were measured and two patient groups formed for analysis The time course of wound healing was regularly and meticulously documented and evaluated by photography and casting. The time from initiation of treatment instil o wound volume reduction to 50 go of the origional size (T50%) was noted\u2022 Results: Healing of extensive burn wounds can be accelerated by grafting cultured autologous or allogeneic keratinocytes. The stimulation of granulation tissue formation and reepithelialization is presumably based on growth factors and cytokines released by keratinocytes. We wanted to prove this hypothesis by investigating the bFGF expression during wound development, bFGF is mainly described as an angiogenic protein with mitogenic activity on various mesodermal and ectodermal cell types pointing to its stimulating potential in wound heating. In the present study we compared the pattern of human bFGF m-RNA expression and the localization of bFGF protein during the first days of wound healing. Biopsies were taken from 5 juvenile human bum patients, immediately after wound debridemerit mad on day 8 after transplantation of cultured allografts. Biopsies were snap frozen and cryosected. The pattern of bFGF expression was assessed by in situ hybridization of the bFGF m-RNA with a digoxigenin-labelled antisense-RNA and the parallel detection of the mature protein with an anfi-bFGF monoclonal antibody. Our study revealed typical patterns of bFGF-m-RNA-expression and intense bFGFprotein deposition during granulation tissue formation and reepithelialJzation of healing bum wounds. 'it, is known that major thermal injuries cause early impairment of wound healing followed by decreased influx of granuiocytes St. the site of injury. The role of granuiocytes in the process of wound healing is not ~\"~ \"\" elucidated, it is now assumed that they are not merely phagocytic cells but active participants in ~n~*'1~.,.,a+~o~: processes secreting_ a number of various cvt-;kines, in order to investigate the effect of There is accumulating evidence that neuropeptides could be involved in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory reactions. Vasocactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) and Substance P (SP) have been detected by immunohistochemistry in normal as well as inflammed skin mostly in perivascular and periglandular location. Both VIP and SP are involved in vasodilatation, mast cell degranulation and irnmunomodulation.We determined the influence of SP and VIP on the proliferation of lymphocytes in patients with psoriasis and healthy individuals. Peripheral blood T-lymphocytes of 6 psoriatics and 6 healthy controls were isolated by density gradient centrifugation and passage over nylon wool. Cell enrichment was controlled by FACS analysis, lx105 T-lymphocytes were then incubated alone or in coculture with 2x104 irradiated autologous lymphocytes in culture medium containing 10 -7 mol/I SP or VIP. Cell proliferation was measured semiquanfitatively by TdR uptake in a betacounter. Significance was tested by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.Our results show that SP and VIP exert only an effect on unstirnulated T-cells. In healthy individuals but not in patients with psoriasis SP increases significantly proliferation of T-cells. VIP, however stimulates significantly the blastogenesis of T-lymphocytes only in psoriatics.Our results confirm the psychoneuroimmunologic component in inflammatory reactions and VIP and SP could be partially implicated in their pathogenetic mechanisms. Moreover psoriatic lymphocytes show an altered reaction to SP and VIP. This might be due to a preexisting (genetic?) or more likely to an epiphenomenal receptor defect. The adhesive interactions between endothelial cells and circulating ~enkocytes in shock and innammatory vondltions is mediated by several distinct families of ce11-surface determinants. Of particular importance are the leukocyte integrins CDIB / CDlla-c. In this study monoclonal antibodies to two of the u chains (CDlla & CDIIb) and the common [~ chain (CDIB) have been used to investigate leukocyte-dependent and leukocyte-independent plasma leakage in tee skin of rabbite. Plasma leakage was measured as the local accumulation of t2sI-HSA over a 30 rain period, The chemotac~c peptide IMLP (0.1. 30ng) and bradykinin were used to induce cell.dependent and cell-5ndependent leakage respectively, The antibodies used were 6.5E (CDIS), NRI85 (CDlla) and antibody 198 (CDllb). ]ntradermal in~ections of bradyklnin and ~dLP both caused a dose dependent increase in plasma extravasatien (15.~. ffi 2.1p.l to 54.4 z B.Bttl and 16.4 ,-1.8~ to 59.8 z 6.71d respectively. 6.5E (0.0072-2.4mF,/k~ iv) caused a dose dependent inhibition of IMLP-induced but not bradyldnin.inducecl plasma exudation. At 0.24mk/kg, the plasma leakage was completely inhibited, Antibody NR185 produced similar results, Treatment with antibody 198 did not cause inhibition o\u00a3 plasma leakage due to either Tnedi~tor. In vitro, The irmnune system ex~nination in persons with bone, chest and abdominal traumatic injury (I group . 22 patients without infectious coz~lications and 2 group -53 patients with wound infections development) was carried out. To restore found immunity disorders and host defense to infection 23 patients of the 2 group were treated with Thymalin-the biologically active peptides prepared from bovine thymus. The examination on t~e I-3 days after injury revealed a considerable decrease of lymphocytes, eD3\",$D4 ~ and CD8 cells amo~it in the blood, CD4 /CD8 ratio and indexes of let~ocyte migration inhibition test in both groups of patients. The imm~lity disorders recovered to norm on the 7-10 days in pateents of+the I group. But stable ~eple$ion of CD3 and CD4 cells amount, lower CD4 /CD8 ratio and indexes of leukocyte migration inhibition test in patients of the 2 group were observed~ Besides that, these persons showed higher CD19cells amount and Ig level in the blood. After Thymalin therapy valid ii~rovement of inun~e status was discovered. Also good clinical effect of immunotherapy and best wo~id healing observed in 80% of cases. These results allow us to propose that the thymus involution and the reduction of cell-mediated immunity responsiveness with disturbances of immu_uoregulatio~ on the level of restriction of activated CD4 ThO cells play the most important role in the pathogenesis of wound infections development in persons with traumatic injury.Dept. of Immunology, Military-Nedical Academy, Lebedeva Str. 6, 194175, St.Petersburg, Russia",

Expectorated sputum may be unreliable in pneumonia, because of contamination by oropharyngeal flora. Although blood cultures may be negative, they provide a precise diagnosis and should be obtained in all pneumonias. Other more invasive procedures are transtracheal needle aspiration, fibrobronchoscopic techniques including protected specimen brush and bronchoalveolar lavage with quantitative culturing and cytological analysis, transthoracic needle aspiration, thoracoscopy -guided biopsy and open lung biopsy. Recently M. E1-Ebiary, A. Torres et al, 1993 reported quantitative cultures of endotracheal aspirates for the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia offering reliable results in these patients and should be further investigated. Any invasive procedure in a severely ill patient should be carefully directed weighing the risks as well as the benefits, whilst taking the underlying diseases and expected survival into consideration. -Current therapeutic approach is based mainly on monotherapy with broad spectrum antibiotics. Combination therapy is apparently indicated only in P. aeruginosa infections and severe S. aureus pneumonia. ",
