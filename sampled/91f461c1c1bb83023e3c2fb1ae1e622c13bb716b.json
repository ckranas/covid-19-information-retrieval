            "text": "Quality of life (QOL) is an important aspect of the management of animals with cardiac disease. Because owners often euthanize their animals with cardiac disease for quality of life issues, this parameter can influence survival time. Quality of life also can be a key outcome measure to assess the success of medical and surgical therapy of cardiac disease. Whereas many QOL assessment tools have been developed for use in people and dogs with cardiac disease, no validated QOL assessment tools are available for use in cats with cardiac disease. The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a questionnaire to assess QOL for cats with cardiac disease. Items related to clinical signs of cardiac disease in cats (eg, appetite, urination habits, interactions with others) were generated and a QOL questionnaire was developed. The questionnaire included 16 questions assessing owner perceptions of the cats' clinical signs using a 0-5 scale, as well as an overall quality of life item. To evaluate the QOL questionnaire, the instrument was self-administered by owners of cats with cardiac disease between June and November, 2009. An independent measure of disease severity [International Small Animal Cardiac Health Council (ISACHC) classification of heart failure] was recorded for each cat. The questionnaire was evaluated for internal consistency, construct validity, criterion-related validity, and test-retest reliability by Spearman rank correlation. The QOL questionnaire was completed by 75 owners of cats with cardiac disease and re-administered after an interval of 1 to 3 weeks to 10 owners. Mean age of the cats was 9.1 AE 4.9 years and the study included 51 male cats and 24 female cats. The most common underlying diseases were hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n 5 56), congenital diseases (n 5 9), dilated or unclassified cardiomyopathy (n 5 7), restrictive cardiomyopathy (n 5 2), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (n 5 1). Cats were distributed between ISACHC class 1a (n 5 3), 1b (n 5 32), 2 (n 5 27), 3a (n 5 10), and 3b (n 5 3). Internal consistency was tested by evaluating the relationship between individual questions and the total QOL score, which ranged from 0.06-0.57. Cronbach's alpha was 0.90, indicating high internal consistency. Correlation between overall quality of life and the total QOL score was 0.64 (P o 0.001). The ISACHC class was correlated with the total QOL score (r 5 0.43; P o 0.001), suggesting moderate criterion validity. Among the 10 owners who completed the questionnaire twice to assess test-retest reliability, total scores on the two tests were highly correlated (P 5 0.94; P 5 0.001). We conclude that the QOL questionnaire for cats has good validity and reliability, and represents a promising new tool for assessment of quality of life in cats. Prospective evaluation of this QOL questionnaire in a larger population of cats with cardiac disease, including responsiveness to change, is ongoing. DNA vaccination against tumor specific proteins is a potential strategy for cancer therapy. In order to have a successful vaccine, one must identify tumor proteins that have a restricted expression pattern (i.e. tumor only) and can facilitate an appropriate immune response while not generating immune tolerance or significant auto-immunity. To this end, a vaccine has been developed for use in dogs with melanoma that has been shown to target the tumor-specific antigen, tyrosinase. Furthermore, pending the expression pattern of this tumor-specific antigen, this vaccine may also be considered in other appropriate species such as the horse. Unfortunately, the expression of this protein in canine (and equine) melanocytic tumors has not been described. In this report we describe the tumor-specific expression levels of tyrosinase in canine and equine melanocytic tumors. We also compare these levels to those found in normal cutaneous tissues from both species. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues were collected from 50 dogs and horses previously diagnosed with a melanocytic tumor. RNA was isolated and quantified from these tissues using standard techniques. A TaqMan RT-PCR assay was then designed to amplify the exon 1/2 boundary. Relative expression levels (DDCt) were determined and compared to both pigmented and nonpigmented cutaneous tissues. Results demonstrate high tyrosinase expression in both pigmented and non-pigmented melanocytic tumors with insignificant levels found in the normal skin. No significant difference in tyrosinase expression was found between the different canine or equine anatomic locations of melanocytic tumors. The specificity and sensitivity of tyrosinase expression was also compared to traditional methodology of immunohistochemistry with S100 and MelanA and found to be similar; correctly classifying all amelanotic melanomas and three undifferentiated sarcomas. In summary, this methodology is highly sensitive and specific for the detection of tyrosinase expression in both fresh and fixed tumor samples and has demonstrated the tumor-specificity of this antigen. lower than those in BMCs obtained by aspiration method (15.3 AE 7.6 and 9.2 AE 3.6) (both P o 0.001). Percentage of CD34 1 cells was significantly higher by perfusion method (5.5 AE 1.9) than aspiration method (4.2 AE 1.8) (P o 0.01). Colony forming unit in culture (CFU-C) was significantly higher by perfusion method (63.7 AE 21.2) than aspiration method (21.9 AE 7.8) (P o 0.01).",

Diagnosis was based on concurrent findings of plasma creatinine 4 2 mg/dl and urine specific gravity (USG) o 1.035, with persistence of azotemia for 2 weeks. All cases were first screened using objective criteria and then classified by two clinicians. Renal function was approximated using the reciprocal of plasma creatinine concentration (1/creatinine) and linear regression was used to assess changes over time. For cases to be considered progressive, a negative slope in 1/creatinine (p o 0.1) was required. For cases to be considered non-progressive, they were required to have no significant negative slope in 1/creatinine, at least 3 plasma creatinine values spread over 40 weeks follow-up, and no linear weight loss (p o 0.05). Graphs of 1/creatinine and bodyweight against time were plotted for cats meeting the above screening criteria. These were randomised and classified independently by the clinicians (HS and JE).

The median PCV for the progressive group was 32(IQR 29-36)% versus 36(IQR 34-41)% for the non-progressive group.

There was no difference in mean survival between groups ( These preliminary results suggest that neither signalment nor histopathologic diagnosis affect the likelihood of dogs with glomerular disease being concurrently diagnosed with NS, and that NS is not associated with a concurrent diagnosis of azotemia or survival time in dogs with glomerular disease. These findings are in contrast to those in people with NS, in whom specific diseases are more likely to result in NS, and the diagnosis of NS may be a negative prognostic indicator. Use of cranberry juice decreased or eliminated recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women. In dogs, as with people Escherichia coli (E. coli) is the most common pathogen associated with UTIs. Cranberry proanthocyanidins (PACs) inhibit the attachment of the P-fimbriated E. coli (Pf E. coli) to uroepithelial cells. A supplement containing these PACs was assessed in six male dogs for anti-adhesion (AA) activity. Urine samples were tested in an in vitro assay for the ability of Pf E.coli to agglutinate human red blood cells. One Crananidin TM tablet containing 16 mg of bioactive PACs (mean dose 1.14 mg/kg bw) was administered daily for three weeks. Urine samples were collected on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 21 at 0-3, 3-6, 6-12 and 21-24 hours post administration. AA assays were scored based on the following scale: 0 5 no AA activity, 0.5 5 25%, 1 5 50%, 1.5 5 75% and 2 5 100% AA activity. Control urine demonstrated hemagglutination activity. AA activity appeared within 3 hours of Crananidin TM administration, peaked on Day 7 at 80 AE 26.5% and remained elevated on Day 21 at 73 AE 28.5% over the 24hour period. No clinically significant clinical chemistry or hematology changes were observed. This innovational ex-vivo study shows that the bioactive PACs in Crananidin TM produce metabolites in the urine of dogs sufficient to reduce adhesion of Pf E. coli, and once daily usage may be beneficial in preventing E. coli associated UTIs in dogs.",

Both factors may impact treatment outcome. Current testing for serum aldosterone uses a 5 mg/kg dose of Cortrosyn with sampling before and at 60 minutes post. Preliminary studies showed that a 1 mg/kg dose of Cortrosyn yields peak aldosterone concentrations at approximately 20 minutes. Thus, with the current test protocol, the peak concentration of aldosterone secretion may not be accurately being measured, making the current test non-diagnostic. The purpose of our study was to determine the ACTH dose necessary to maximally stimulate aldosterone secretion as well as to determine the time of maximal aldosterone response in relation to the dose administered.",

Defining treatment success in veterinary diabetes mellitus (DM) is generally limited to diminishing DM related clinical signs as well as demonstrating reductions in average blood glucose values. This study reports the design and application of a novel individualized, patient and owner-centered survey measuring perceived impact of DM on quality of life (QoL) of diabetic cats and their owners. Discussions and pilot-surveys were conducted with veterinarians, diabetic cat owners and human DM QoL survey designers, leading to the design of 29 specific DM-associated QoL questions (DIA-QoL-pet). Each item was scored according to frequency with which it impacts upon lives of owners and their cat (range: all the time...never) and perceived importance (range: very important . . . not at all important). The Item-Weighted-Impact-Score (IWIS) for each item was calculated by multiplying frequency and importance ratings; the Average-Weighted-Impact-Score (AWIS) by averaging all IWISs. Two overview questions measured overall QoL and diabetes-dependent-QoL. 221 owners of insulin-treated diabetic cats completed the survey. 87% of respondents originated from the UK and USA. The cats' average age was 12.41/\u00c03.1years (mean1/ \u00c0standard deviation); body weight 5.71/\u00c01.9 kg; 64% were domestic short or long hair. Average insulin dose was 0.471/\u00c00.5 iu/kg and 82% received insulin 12 hourly. The 29-item DIAQoL-pet had high internal consistency reliability (Cronbach a50.89) and could be summarized into an AWIS of \u00c01.761/\u00c02.4. Areas reported as most negatively impacting on QoL (based on IWIS) included: 'boarding difficulties' (\u00c04.671/\u00c05.3), 'owner wanting more control over DM' (\u00c04.341/\u00c04.7), 'difficulties leaving cat with friends/ family' (\u00c04.211/\u00c04.7), 'worry about cat's DM' (\u00c04.101/\u00c03.9), 'hypoglycemia worry' (\u00c03.671/\u00c03.5), 'adapting social life' (\u00c03.481/\u00c03.9), 'DM-related costs' (\u00c03.041/\u00c03.8), 'adapting work life' (\u00c03.031/\u00c03.7), 'pet's moods' (\u00c02.871/\u00c02.9) and 'limiting activities like holidays' (\u00c02.811/\u00c03.9). 51% considered their cat's present QoL 'as good as it could possibly be'; 49% felt their cat's life would be 'a little better' without DM. The DIAQoL-pet showed high internal consistency reliability and identified specific areas most negatively impacting on the QoL of a group of diabetic cats and their owners.

In fact, the low-dose ACTH stimulation test may be more sensitive in detecting mild degrees of adrenal insufficiency in ill dogs. The purpose of this study was to characterize urine sodium concentrations in hyponatremic dogs with and without hypoadrenocorticism. In the hyponatremic state, the kidneys should conserve sodium; expected urine sodium concentrations are less than 25 mEq/L. However, in the case of aldosterone deficiency, the kidneys cannot conserve sodium; urine sodium concentrations are increased. Medical records of hyponatremic dogs that had urine sodium concentrations measured were reviewed. Dogs were excluded if diuretics, mineralocorticoids, or intravenous or subcutaneous fluids were administered prior to urine collection. Fifteen dogs were included; 7 were diagnosed with hypoadrenocorticism and 8 were diagnosed with hyponatremia of other etiology (control), including pyelonephritis, biliary mucocele, diabetic ketoacidosis, and heart disease. A Wilcoxon sum rank test was used to compare results between groups. Median urine sodium concentrations in hypoadrenocortical dogs was 125 mEq/L (interquartile range (IQR): 76.5-188.5) and in control dogs was 22 mEq/L (IQR: 7.5-58). Dogs with hypoadrenocorticism had significantly higher median urine sodium concentrations than control dogs (P 5 0.004). Diagnoses of the two control dogs with urine sodium 4 25 mEq/L included diabetic ketoacidosis with pyelonephritis, and biliary mucocele. These results suggest that urine sodium concentrations can be used to help to characterize the etiology of hyponatremia in dogs. Measurement of a single urine sodium concentration 4 25 mEq/L in a hyponatremic dog is supportive of, but not diagnostic for, hypoadrenocorticism. The pathophysiology of canine diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is incompletely understood. Dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines has been documented in humans with DKA or poorly regulated type I diabetes. The purpose of this study was to compare cytokine, chemokine and hormone concentrations in dogs with DKA before and after resolution of ketoacidosis, and to compare concentrations before treatment of DKA to those measured in dogs with uncomplicated diabetes mellitus (DM) and healthy dogs.

Hereditary equine regional dermal asthenia (HERDA) is an autosomal recessive connective tissue disorder affecting horses of Quarter Horse lineage. 1 Although a mutation in the cyclophilin B gene has been linked to HERDA 2 , its causal association with the disease is not yet documented. Clinical parallels between HERDA and the Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes (EDS) prompted our laboratory to investigate the intermolecular cross-links of collagen, specifically pyridinoline (PYD) and deoxypyridinoline (DPD), which give collagen its tensile strength. We have previously demonstrated that horses homozygous for the HERDA trait can be identified from birth by a significant elevation of urine DPD and DPD:PYD ratio 3 and have significant decreases in skin tensile strength which are not restricted to the dorsum. 4 These findings are similar to those of human EDS VIA. 5 The purpose of this study was to determine if the decrease in skin tensile strength of HERDA horses could be explained by a similar collagen cross linking pattern in the skin of HERDA horses as has been identified in their urine. The collagen cross linking pattern and amino acid (AA) composition of skin acid hydrolysates from 22 horses (6 homozygotes, 6 HERDA carriers, and 10 HERDA negative horses) was determined using reversephase HPLC and a Biochrom AA analyzer, respectively. Data subjected to one way ANOVA with a Bonferroni post hoc analysis indicate significantly lower concentrations of PYD and significantly higher DPD and DPD:PYD ratios in HERDA homozygotes versus negative or carrier horses. Hydroxylysine (HL) concentrations were significantly lower in affected versus negative and carrier horses. Total pyridinium cross links were not significantly different between groups. This alteration in the biochemical composition of HERDA skin, which is known to correlate to poor tensile strength in human EDS, is the first evidence to explain the clinical syndrome of skin fragility that is characteristic of HERDA. Furthermore, the significant decrease in HL (for the precursor of pyridinium crosslinks) in HERDA horses suggests that altered collagen lysine metabolism may be physiologically relevant to the clinical manifestation of the disease. ( A key feature of effective immune responses against viruses and intracellular bacteria is the ability to destroy infected cells. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) have this ability and are a critical component of the adaptive immune response. Unfortunately, eliciting protective CTL against several important intracellular pathogens by vaccination has been difficult in the horse. Efficient priming of na\u0131\u00a8ve CTL requires that antigens be delivered to and processed intracellularly by dendritic cells, which are derived from bone marrow precursors and are the principle antigen presenting cells for initiating T cell responses. Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) is a lentivirus that causes persistent infection in horses, and CTL are critical in its control. Importantly, EIAV directly infects equine dendritic cells. Thus, a replication-defective vaccine vector based on EIAV could provide an effective means to elicit CTL in horses against a variety of intracellular pathogens. The purpose of this study was to determine if such a vector could elicit durable CTL responses in horses.",

Morgan horses had increased MSH and ACTH concentration compared with light horses from the same location during the fall months; there was no difference during the non-fall months. Hormone concentrations in ponies were not different than in horses during either season. In healthy horses, 8% of the non-fall samples had ACTH 4 50 pg/ml and 1% had MSH 4 35 pmol/L. In horses with PPID, 67% of non-fall samples had ACTH concentration 4 50 pg/ml and 83% had MSH 4 35 pmol/L. Both MSH and ACTH concentrations were significantly greater in the fall compared to spring in horses with PPID (P o 0.01). In summary, latitude of residence and breed may affect onset and/or amplitude of the seasonal increase in PI hormones. Horses with PPID continue to have seasonal variation in PI hormone concentrations. Obesity and insulin resistance have been associated with laminitis in equids. Adipose tissue (AT) produces many hormones (adipokines) that have important local and systemic effects on metabolism; two well-characterized adipokines are leptin and adiponectin. Leptin is an important regulator of satiety, and adiponectin can modulate inflammation and insulin sensitivity. In humans, expression of leptin and adiponectin in subcutaneous AT has been shown to decrease in reponse to chronic exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines (PIC); however, acute inflammation increases AT leptin expression, suggesting a biphasic tissue leptin response to PIC. Recent work has shown depot-specific differences in PIC gene expression in equine AT, with nuchal ligament AT expression of IL-1 and IL-6 significantly higher than that of visceral and other subcutaneous AT depots. Depot-specific adipokine expression patterns (which may relate to PIC expression) have not been reported in the horse. This study evaluated gene expression of leptin and adiponectin in several AT depots of insulin-resistant (IR) and insulinsensitive (IS) horses. Eleven mares receiving an identical diet (8 Quarter horses, 2 Thoroughbreds, and 1 Standardbred) and categorized as IR (insulin sensitivity [SI] 5 0.58 AE 0.31 Lmin \u00c01 mU \u00c01 ; n 5 5) or IS (SI 5 2.59 AE 1.21 Lmin \u00c01 mU \u00c01 ; n 5 6) based on results of an insulin-modified frequently-sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test were studied. Omental, retroperitoneal, and mesocolonic AT was collected via ventral midline celiotomy; nuchal ligament and tail head AT biopsies were collected via skin incision. Tissue samples were snap-frozen; plasma samples were collected concurrently. For each depot, total RNA was extracted and cDNA produced and analyzed via real-time quantitative PCR to quantify expression of leptin and adiponectin; plasma leptin concentrations were measured with a commercially-available radioimmunoassay (Millipore; Temecula, CA). Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA for repeated measures or non-parametric equivalent (p 5 0.05). The expression of leptin and adiponectin were significantly lower in nuchal ligament AT compared with other depots (p 5 0.006 and p 5 0.0001, respectively), with no observed effect of insulin sensitivity status. Plasma leptin concentration did not differ significantly between the IR and IS horses, nor did it differ between these horses (BCS 5 7.2 1/\u00c0 0.7; scale of 1-9) and a lean historical cohort of horses (n 5 13; BCS 5 6.1 1/\u00c0 1.0) (p 5 0.38). The finding of decreased leptin and adiponectin expression in nuchal ligament AT is in keeping with the previously reported PIC expression data from this depot and suggests a relatively stable (chronic) inflammatory state in the tissue. These data provide further support for the hypothesis that nuchal ligament AT displays unique biological behavior in the horse relative to other depots. Metformin hydrochloride is used as a treatment for insulin resistance (IR) in equids. This drug may also be useful for controlling IR when insulin-resistant horses are reintroduced to pasture. We therefore tested the hypothesis that metformin alters glucose dynamics in insulin-resistant horses undergoing reintroduction to grazing. Six adult horses with chronic IR were transferred to grass paddocks after spending 4 15 months confined in stalls with attached gravel turnout areas. Glucose dynamics were assessed using the combined glucose-insulin test (CGIT) before and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 wk after horses were transferred to grass paddocks. After horses were housed in grass paddocks for 2 wk, they were treated with metformin (15 mg/kg q12h) for 2 wk, taken off treatment for 2 wk, and then treated with metformin at a high dosage (30 mg/kg q12h) for 2 wk. Horses were also reevaluated 2 wk later.",

No differences were detected between pre-and post-metformin mean values for resting glucose concentrations or AUCg at either dosage level. However, mean AUCg significantly decreased (18.6%) across the 10-week study period. Metformin did not affect glucose dynamics in this study, but AUCg decreased over time when insulin-resistant horses were transferred to grass paddocks. Recent evidence suggests that laminar inflammatory events, similar to those previously reported in the black walnut extract model, also occur during the developmental phase of carbohydrate (CHO) induced laminitis. In the CHO model, early increases in laminar mRNA concentrations of the neutrophil chemokines CXCL8 and GRO are followed by increases in proinflammatory cytokines and monocyte chemokines. Digital hypothermia has been shown to reduce the severity of laminitis after induction with the CHO oligofructose (OF). Because hypothermia has been reported to reduce inflammatory injury in several diseases including traumatic brain injury in humans, we hypothesized that digital hypothermia inhibits inflammatory signaling during the development of laminitis induced with OF.",

Median concentrations of UCH-L1 (6.57 ng/mL; 2.35 to 11.90 ng/mL) in foals with a clinical diagnosis of HIE were significantly (P o 0.001) higher than those of healthy controls (2.52 ng/mL; 1.4 to 4.01 ng/mL). Using a cut off of 4.01 ng/mL, the sensitivity and specificity of the UCH-L1 assay for the diagnosis of HIE were 70% and 94%, respectively. UCH-L1 has potential as a marker of brain injury in neonatal foals with CNS disorders. Low-dose hydrocortisone replacement therapy has been shown to improve outcome in people with Critical Illness-Related Corticosteroid Insufficiency. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a proposed hydrocortisone replacement therapy regimen on ex vivo measures of immunity in healthy neonatal foals. A hydrocortisone dose of 1.3 mg/kg/day was divided and administered as six intravenous boluses to 11 healthy 2-day foals for 24 hours. This dose was halved for another 24 hours, halved again for 12 hours, and then discontinued. Peripheral blood leukocytes were collected from foals before treatment, at 48 hours, and 12 hours after cessation of therapy. A separate group of 12 age-matched foals received saline and served as the control group. Endotoxin-induced mononuclear cell gene expression of TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 was measured by RTqPCR. Neutrophils were incubated with labeled, killed S. aureus or E. coli for assessment of phagocytic function, and with phorbol myristate acetate, zymosan, or endotoxin for measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Data were compared between groups with Mann Whitney tests and ANOVA, with significance set at P o 0.05. No adverse effects were observed in any foals receiving hydrocortisone. Neutrophil phagocytosis and ROS production were similar in both groups. However, foals receiving hydrocortisone had significantly decreased endotoxin-induced production of TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-1b. These data suggest that this hydrocortisone replacement therapy regimen is both safe in foals and effective at ameliorating endotoxin-induced inflammatory cytokine expression without significantly altering innate immune responses needed to combat bacterial infection. Hepatic failure is one of the most common complications in foals requiring blood transfusions to treat neonatal isoerythrolysis. The strong association between development of liver failure and the volume of blood transfused as well as the nature of the histologic lesions suggest that iron toxicity is the likely cause of hepatic injury. The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of deferoxamine on iron elimination following blood transfusion in neonatal foals.",

Although the deletion was observed in some apparently unaffected dogs, their health status may reflect a later onset or variable penetrance of the disease. Affected dogs were either homozygous or heterozygous for the deletion. The deletion disrupts several splice site enhancer sites and leads to the presumed use of a cryptic splice site within the intron. Electron microscopy of myocardium from affected dogs demonstrated mitochondrial disruption. We conclude that a 16 base pair deletion in a splice site region of a gene encoding for a mitochondrial protein located on chromosome 14 is associated with the development of DCM in at least some DOBE families. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility and shortterm effectiveness of cutting balloon valvuloplasty (CBV), followed by high pressure balloon valvuloplasty (HPBV) in dogs with severe subaortic stenosis (SAS). Eleven dogs o 30 months old with severe SAS (peak Doppler systolic left ventricular pressure gradient (PG) 4 80 mmHg) underwent CBV and HPBV and were reexamined at one day (n 5 11), one month (n 5 11), and three months (n 5 8) post-procedure. Under general anesthesia, cardiac catheterization was performed via the carotid artery. Left ventricular and aortic root pressures were obtained before and after valvuloplasty.

For every 1 m/s increase in aortic velocity (4 2.5 m/s) a statistically significant odds ratio (OR) for demonstrating presence of subvalvular ridge, LVH and AI was identified (OR 5 2.95, P 5 0.007; OR 5 4.65, P 5 0.0001; OR 5 2.54, P 5 0.01 respectively). The combination of LVH, AI and subvalvular ridge was reported in 10 of 11(90%) golden retrievers with aortic velocities ! 4.0 m/s. Subvalvular aortic stenosis was observed in multiple generations of several families and appears familial. Evaluation of pedigree data has ruled out an autosomal dominant or X-linked dominant mode of inheritance as two unaffected parents produced affected offspring. X-linked recessive mode of inheritance is ruled out as an affected female produced an unaffected male offspring. An autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance seems most likely as the trait appears to skip generations and unaffected parents are observed to produce affected offspring. Subvalvular aortic stenosis in the golden retriever is familial and best fits an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Characterization of SAS in golden retrievers suggests a similar phenotype to other reported breeds. Severity of stenosis determined by aortic velocity correlates well with the cumulative presence of echocardiographic characteristics (LVH, subvalvular ridge and AI). Cardioembolic events are a devastating complication of myocardial disease in cats. Multiple antithrombotic agents have been used in cats but evidence of clinical efficacy with any agent is lacking while new antithrombotics are constantly being evaluated.",

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common cause of feline heart disease.

In humans, two genetic polymorphisms within the Beta-1 adrenergic receptor (1-AR) gene have been shown to correspond to variable pharmacologic responses.

No remarkable differences were noted on the images obtained at 7.0 T. In our study, special importance was given to thalamocortical structures, which are the areas of the brain where seizure activity originates and spreads from, both in humans and dogs. Definitive diagnoses of intracranial diseases often remain elusive. Several markers have shown promise for systemic malignancies, but none have been fully evaluated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of veterinary patients in association with specific intracranial diseases. Current examination of CSF in canine veterinary practice is based on cellular examination and total protein measurement, though additional analyses may be useful. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) stimulates endothelial cell proliferation and has a pivotal role in tumor angiogenesis. VEGF was evaluated in the CSF of dogs with various intracranial diseases to probe its utility as a biomarker. CSF was prospectively banked in patients with intracranial disease during routine diagnostic evaluation or immediately post-mortem after euthanasia. VEGF concentrations were assayed using a commercially available ELISA kit, which has been validated for use in dogs. VEGF was readily quantifiable in canine CSF. Samples were subdivided into neoplastic (primary intracranial, n 5 28), inflammatory (n 5 22), and other neurologic disease (n 5 35). There were significant differences in VEGF levels between all groups (mean values in pg/ml were 159.4, 50.9, and 2.2, respectively, P o 0.0001). Within the neoplastic group, there were significant differences in VEGF levels between specific malignancies (P 5 0.035); choroid plexus (631.1) and glial cell (300.2) tumors demonstrated the highest average levels, followed by meningiomas (13.1), CNS lymphoma (3.0), and pituitary adenomas (2.12). Inflammatory brain diseases had variable VEGF levels (range 0-489.96), while other intracranial disease rarely had detectable VEGF in the CSF. These observations provide a potential basis for differentiating etiologies of intracranial masses. Central nervous system (CNS) neoplasia has been reported in 1-3% of canine necropsies and occurs in approximately 14 in 100,000 dogs. Parallels exist between primary canine and human brain tumors including frequency, tumor types, classification, immunohistochemical markers, and tumor behavior. While it is generally accepted that both genetics and environmental factors contribute to CNS neoplasia, the etiologies for human and, particularly canine brain tumors, are largely unknown. Over the past decade, DNA and RNA viruses have been identified in various primary human brain tumor types. However, the causal relationship between CNS viral infection and primary brain tumors in humans has been a source of debate because of conflicting laboratory reports documenting the presence or absence of viruses in various brain tumor types.",

However, a small population of collapsing Labradors are clear or carriers of the recessively inherited mutation.",

Recommendations for tapering of glucocorticoid therapy in cats with lower airway disease (eosinophilic or neutrophilic inflammation) have traditionally been based on resolution of clinical signs and radiographic abnormalities. In people, resolution of clinical signs is a poor predictor of airway inflammation. In cats, there are no reports on the sensitivity of clinical signs in predicting airway inflammation, in particular while receiving glucocorticoid treatment. Since assessment of the presence of clinical signs is often the driving force behind recommendations to alter therapy in cats with lower airway disease, it is essential to determine if they can reliably predict the presence of airway inflammation.

Serum Blastomyces antigen levels become negative quickly after the initiation of therapy and significantly prior to clinical remission, and should not be used to determine resolution of disease. Babesia rossi infections in dogs are frequently complicated and patients have a high mortality rate within the first 24-hours after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Hypoglycemia and hypercortisolaemia at admission as well as persistent hyperlactataemia have been identified as strong prognosticators, indicating metabolic dysbalance to be important to outcome. Recently, the cytokine monocyte chemoattractant protein [MCP]-1 was identified as a strong predictor of mortality in human sepsis and has also been reported to increase in experimental canine sepsis. The aim of the study was to determine whether MCP-1 is a marker for mortality in complicated babesiosis caused by B.rossi. This prospective, cross-sectional, observational study included 72 client-owned dogs diagnosed with canine babesiosis and admitted to the ICU of the Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Pretoria. Diagnosis was based on morphological demonstration of the intraerythrocytic trophozoites on blood films. Dogs with concurrent infections or with a history of treatment for an infection in the preceding 7 days were excluded. Infection with B.rossi was confirmed by PCR. Dogs infected with B.vogeli, or concurrent Ehrlichia canis or Theileria spp. infection, and dogs euthanized for reasons other than poor prognosis were excluded. Five healthy dogs were included as controls. Blood samples were collected at admission. Serum MCP-1 concentration was assessed by a canine-specific assay (CCYTO-90 K, Millipore, USA) and glucose by standard enzymatic methodology. Mortality during hospitalization was recorded. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the cytokine level in controls vs. babesiosis patients and in survivors vs. non-survivors. Analysis of the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) was used to compare the prognostic abilities of MCP-1 and glucose. P o 0.05 was considered significant.",

Previous experimental studies have demonstrated MCP-1 as an important immunomodulator in sepsis and the results of this study indicate that dysbalances in immunoregulation play an important role in the outcome of babesia caused by B.rossi, in addition to the previously described metabolic dysbalances. The inflammatory response to infection can activate the coagulation system via complex interactions. If uncontrolled, this may lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which has been identified as a major risk factor for poor outcome in both human and canine medicine. Studies have indicated that patients naturally infected with Babesia rossi suffer from Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) with possible DIC, without clinical signs of bleeding. We hypothesized that a consumptive coagulopathy is present in dogs with B. rossi infection and that the extent of the coagulopathy is related to outcome.

Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic routinely used in veterinary medicine. Ketamine has demonstrated positive cardiostimulatory effects, immunomodulation, decreased leukocyte-endothelial adhesion and analgesia in various species challenged by lipopolysacchride (LPS). A recent report in canids demonstrated significant blunting of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) production using subanesthetic doses of ketamine during periods of endotoxemia. In-vivo and in-vitro immunomodulation following endotoxemia has been demonstrated in mice through direct inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B and inhibition of LPS-induced TNFa and interleukin-6 production in an equine macrophage cell line model, respectively. TNF-a is considered the earliest cytokine released during endotoxemia along with the induction of the vasoactive substance thromboxane (TXB 2 ). The aim of this prospective study was to determine if a subanesthetic continuous rate infusion (CRI) of ketamine could be safely administered and result in positive immunomodulation in horses with experimentally induced endotoxemia. Specifically, this pilot study addressed whether a subanesthetic dose of ketamine could attenuate both the LPS-induced production of TNF-a and TXB 2 , and the induction of clinicopathologic findings of endotoxemia. 20 mares of various breeds were randomly assigned to two groups, control or ketamine treated. Each horse in the ketamine group received a subanesthetic CRI (1.5 mg/kg/h over 5 h) of racemic ketamine, following a loading dose, while the control group received an equal volume of 0.9% saline. Both groups were administered endotoxin (LPS, Escherichia coli 055:B5, 30 ng/kg over 30 min) 1 hour after initiation of the ketamine or saline CRI. Clinicopathologic parameters and sample collection were monitored at half-hour and hourly intervals relative to LPS administration.",

Given these findings, further studies regarding the clinical utility of a subanesthetic ketamine CRI are warranted. Endotoxemia is responsible for the severe illness in horses associated with colic, diarrhea, pleuropneumonia, peritonitis and metritis.

This has direct survival value, as laboratory rodents with induced endo- however, the cytokine responses associated with this have not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to describe a method for inducing ET in equine cells in vitro, and to describe the cytokine profile which is associated with the ET. Blood was collected from 6 healthy horses and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated. ET was induced by culturing cells with a variety of concentrations of endotoxin (0.1, 1.0 and 10 ng/ ml), followed by a second endotoxin challenge (1.0, 10 and 100 ng/ ml). The state of tolerance was identified by assaying cell culture media for TNF-a concentration (ELISA). ET was confirmed when the TNF-a production was reduced by greater than 75% compared to non-tolerized control cells.

Infected horses cause significant economic loss due to treatment, fatalities and restriction on trade with nonendemic nations. To date, no drug has been shown to completely eliminate infection and infected horses create a risk of transmission. Ponazuril, a metabolite of toltrazuril, has been used as an anti-protozoal agent to successfully treat equine Sarcosystis neurona and other domestic animal protozoa such as Toxoplasma gondii. In an attempt to establish the in vitro activity of this drug against B. equi, tissue cultures containing the Florida strain of B. equi were established. Ponazuril was diluted in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and then added to the culture media to create 1% DMSO solutions with varying concentrations of ponazuril. Prior to treatment, all cultures were evaluated by light microscopy, combined and redistributed to yield separate culture wells with similar percent parasitemias. Treated media was created at 100 mg/mL, 250 mg/mL, 500 mg/mL, 750 mg/mL, and 1000 mg/mL concentrations. Control culture wells were also maintained with media containing only 1% DMSO. The treated media was substituted for the normal media during maintenance of the cultures once daily for 5 days. The cultures were treated in triplicate at each drug concentration. After the 5 day treatment period, routine maintenance of the cultures resumed. The cultures were evaluated via light microscopy of giemsa stained slides for percent parasitemia daily for the 5 treatment days and then daily for 30 days after discontinuation of the drug. Slides were prepared and labeled as to prevent evaluator bias. The control cultures continued to grow as expected. Degree of parasite inhibition was variable between drug concentrations. The 100 mg/mL inhibited parasite growth during the treatment period but the parasite was never completely eliminated. The 250 mg/mL, 500 mg/mL, 750 mg/mL, and 1000 mg/mL did completely eliminate detectable parasitemia during the treatment period.",

This inconsistency was potentially related to the difficulty encountered with complete dissolution of this high concentration of drug within the culture media.

Future research to evaluate this drug in vivo is warranted. Bartonella are emerging, potentially zoonotic pathogens, found in several wild and domestic animals, causing various clinical syndromes.

Blood lactate is a marker of tissue perfusion and inflammation in critically ill patients. In humans, lactate clearance has largely replaced single measurements in predicting mortality due to improved accuracy. The association between lactate clearance and outcome in acute colitis warrants further investigation. This retrospective study aimed to determine the prognostic value of lactate clearance in horses with acute colitis. Medical records for horses with colitis between 2003 and 2009 were reviewed. Early (admission to 4-8 h post) and late (admission to 24 h) lactate clearances were calculated. The sensitivity and specificity of different lactate clearance cutoffs were calculated. Two way ANOVA was used to evaluate differences in lactate between survivors and nonsurvivors and horses with and without systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Mortality was compared between lactate clearers and nonclearers using Fisher's exact test and odds ratios. 96 cases were included. An early lactate clearance of ! 40% and a late clearance of ! 50% had the maximum sum of sensitivity and specificity. When these cutoffs were used, early and late lactate clearance were significantly associated with outcome (P 5 0.02, OR: 3.35 [1.27-8.80] and P 5 0.02, OR: 3.62 [1.26-10.41], respectively). Horses with SIRS had higher lactate concentrations over the first 24 h as compared to those without, however there were no significant differences in lactate concentrations between survivors and nonsurvivors. The association between lactate clearance and survival, and lactate concentrations over time with SIRS, suggest an importance in early identification and treatment of hyperlactatemia in colitis cases. Equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM) resulting from equine herpes virus (EHV) infection continues to be associated with high mortality in the horse. Therefore, appropriate prophylaxis and treatment is important to the equine industry. Previous pharmacologic research has focused on acyclovir and its prodrug, valacyclovir. However, the higher potency of ganciclovir makes it an attractive candidate for use in horses already infected with EHV. This study investigated the pharmacokinetics of ganciclovir after intravenous administration of 2.5 mg/kg of injectable ganciclovir as a slow bolus to five horses. Plasma ganciclovir concentrations were assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography and preliminary noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was performed. Ganciclovir pharmacokinetic characteristics were similar to those of intravenous acyclovir, with a volume of distribution at steady state of 9.2 AE 2.5 L/kg and clearance of 4.0 AE 1.2 mL min \u00c01 kg \u00c01 . The pronounced multi-compartmental decay and extended elimination half-life of 24-58 hr also resembled those of acyclovir, and are expected to similarly produce accumulation of ganciclovir at steady state. Although up to one week of dosing may be required for steady state conditions to occur, a rapid onset of action would be required during an EHM outbreak. Nonparametric superposition predicted that a loading regimen of 2.5 mg/kg of intravenous ganciclovir every 8 hours for the first day, followed by 2.5 mg/kg every 12 hours, would maintain trough ganciclovir concentrations above the targeted IC 50 of 0.1-0.4 mg/mL, within the first day of beginning therapy. Further studies are needed to examine the safety and efficacy of multiple doses of ganciclovir in horses. Equine motor neuron disease (EMND) resulting from prolonged vitamin (vit.) E deficiency has a poor prognosis. Diagnostic criteria include vit. E o 2 mg/dl and neurogenic atrophy in the sacrocaudalis muscle. We hypothesized that an early stage of reversible myogenic atrophy may exist in horses with low serum vit. E prior to occult EMND. The first objective of this study was to retrospectively characterize clinical cases and muscle pathology of horses that had myofiber atrophy in the sacrocaudalis muscle. The second objective was to prospectively describe the clinical attributes and muscle pathology of 10 horses that presented to the UMN Equine Center with moderate weakness, muscle atrophy and low vit. E that successfully responded to treatment.",

The epidemiology of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), including its modes of transmission and maintenance has been well described. However, few studies have examined insects as indirect vectors of BVDV. The horn fly (Haematobia irritans) is the most prevalent insect affecting cattle in the southern US and this study sought to evaluate the potential for BVDV transmission by horn flies. Horn flies were collected from four persistently infected (PI) cattle and distributed into fly cage cylinders, with 25 flies per cage. An additional aliquot of 50 flies per PI animal was tested for BVDV by RT-PCR. Four principal and four control BVDV na\u0131\u00a8ve calves were housed in individual isolations rooms. Two cages were attached to each animal. While cages on principal calves allowed flies to feed, a plastic barrier prevented feeding from control calves. After 48 hours, the cages were removed and fly homogenates from each calf were tested for BVDV by RT-PCR. Blood samples were collected from each calf on days 0, 3, 6-10, 14, 21, and 28 and tested by virus isolation and virus neutralization. Fly homogenates from three of four PI cattle were positive for BVDV by RT-PCR. Of the fly homogenates removed after 48 hours, three were positive from principal calves and four from control calves. Virus isolation and serology remained negative throughout the study. These results indicate that BVDV may be detected in horn flies that are feeding on PI animals, but they do not appear to be an important vector for BVDV.",

The average prevalence of intramammary infections (IMI) in heifers at calving ranges between 30-40%, with coagulase negative staphylococci as the predominant bacterial cause, followed by S. aureus or streptococci. Currently, there is no universally recommended procedure to predict IMIs in heifers at calving. Many producers are unwilling to collect prepartum secretions for fear of predisposing the mammary gland to an IMI. Some producers prophylactically treat all prepartum heifers to control IMI at calving.

No CPS were isolated from teat skin, 92% (102/112) of mammary quarters that had a CNS on teat skin did not have a CNS IMI at calving, 3% (3/112) had an IMI, and 5% (6/112) were infected with a different bacterial pathogen. A greater proportion of mammary quarters (26%; 103/396) that were not sampled pre-partum had IMIs at calving than quarters that were sampled (19%; 61/327) (P 5 0.024). Based on the calculated Se (0.81), pre-partum secretion culture is marginally useful for predicting IMIs in heifers at calving. However, given that 52% of quarters were culture negative prepartum and only 6% of these culture negative quarters acquired new infections after calving, prepartum sampling would be useful to producers for preferentially treating mammary quarters prepartum. Prepartum sampling did not increase the likelihood of IMI at calving. Otitis media appears to be a common disease of young calves however the true prevalence is unknown. Diagnosis is based upon clinical signs and radiography, which often can be difficult to interpret. The purpose of this study was to compare radiography and computed tomography in the diagnosis of otitis media in calves. Seventeen Holstein calves between 5 to 7 weeks of age were included. All calves following neurological examination were sedated with intravenous xylazine (0.5-1.0 mg/kg) for routine radiographs (3 views) and computed tomography of the tympanic bullae followed by necropsy. Based upon necropsy findings, 11 of 17 calves were affected with otitis media, 4 unilaterally and 7 bilaterally. Radiographic and computed tomographic changes associated with otitis media included increased soft tissue opacity within the bulla, thickening of the bulla wall, enlarged bulla, and osteolysis of the bulla wall and trabeculations. The most reliable radiographic change was lysis of the trabeculations within the tympanic bulla which was present in 92.3% of affected bullae. However, 50% of normal bullae were considered affected based upon radiography. On computed tomography images, increased soft tissue opacity within the bulla was present in all affected calves. Sensitivity of radiography and computed tomography was 72.2% and 94.4% and specificity was 50% and 100% respectively. The kappa value for agreement between the two imaging modalities was 0.29 indicating slight agreement. Results indicate that computed tomography is more specific and sensitive, faster to perform and easier to interpret than radiography in the diagnosis of otitis media in the calf.

The purpose of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of tramadol (2 mg/kg) and its metabolite M1 after intravenous and intramuscular administration to llamas. Tramadol is a centrally acting analgesic that possesses opioid agonist features that has been used to treat moderate to severe pain in humans. Camelids are a rapidly growing aspect of small ruminant agriculture in the US. The popularity and numbers of llamas being kept as pets, packing animals, and show animals has increased in recent years. With the increased numbers of animals there is an increased demand for veterinary service; however, there are no drugs approved by the FDA for use in camelids and pharmaceutical companies cannot economically justify seeking approval of drugs in this species. Six healthy adult male llamas were used to determine the metabolism of tramadol. In a prior study we demonstrated that current methods of estimating ideal body weight for weight loss feeding are inaccurate in dogs having ! 45% body fat. The purpose of this study was to develop simple and accurate methods of measuring body composition in clinical practice in overweight to morbidly obese dogs. Current morphometric measurement methods do not adequately predict body composition in obese dogs. Additionally, these methods tend to be difficult to use and have poor accuracy. This study evaluated two methods of predicting lean body mass (LBM) from animal morphology, radiographic measurement of skeletal size and external physical measurement of body size.",

Multiple regression analysis using DXA results as the dependent variable was used to develop regression equations for the prediction of LBM from the skeletal size and body size data. Several equations were developed that had high (4 0.9) correlation coefficients for both methods when the dogs were divided into 2 size groups ( 40 lbs and 4 40 lbs).

This approach shows great potential for the development of simple and accurate tools to be used in clinical practice. Further studies must be done to validate the equations in a population of dogs other than those used to develop the equations. With an estimated 35-40% of pet dogs being overweight or obese, veterinarians must accurately assess energy needs to prescribe appropriate food doses. Body condition scoring (BCS) is the most popular and accessible method for estimating degrees of obesity in dogs, but these scales were designed to assess animals with body fat percentages below about 45%. Many obese dogs have body fat percentages of 50% and greater. This project compared the accuracy of using body fat percentages to the 5 and 9 point BCS systems for estimating ideal body weight and resting energy requirements (RER) in overweight dogs. Thirty-six healthy, client-owned dogs ranging from 5 to 73.6 kg underwent dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning to assess their percentage of body fat (BF). BF percentage was then used to estimate ideal body weight, calculate RER, and classify each animal into the 5 and 9 point BCS system. Once a BCS was assigned, the median body fat percentage for each score was used to estimate ideal body weight and RER (5 point scale -4 5 30%, 5 5 40%; 9 point scale -6 5 30%, 7 5 35%, 8 5 40%, 9 5 45%). Based on DXA, body fat ranged from 28.3% to 63.7% with a mean of 45.9%. To assess the accuracy of BCS for moderately versus morbidly obese dogs, patients were divided into two groups: o 45% body fat (n 5 15) and 4 45% body fat (n 5 21). Compared to DXA, estimations of ideal body weight were significantly higher using the 5 (23.0 vs. 19.2 kg) and 9 (21.1 vs. 19.2 kg) point BCS in dogs with BF 4 45% (p o 0.001) but did not differ in dogs with o 45% BF (p 4 0.05). DXA estimations of RER were also significantly lower than estimations using the 5 (709 vs. 616 Kcal/day) and 9 (665 vs. 616 Kcal/day) point scales in dogs with BF 4 45% (p o 0.001), but did not differ in dogs with o 45% BF (p 4 0.05). The results of this study demonstrate current BCS systems provide good estimates of ideal body weight and RER in dogs with less than 45% BF, but are inadequate for calculating RER and ideal body weight in morbidly obese dogs (BF 4 45%). As a result, food dose calculations will be overestimated and this may affect weight loss efficacy. As canine obesity rates climb, we must develop new methods to assess our most obese patients and provide better weight management. Adiponectin, an adipokine that attenuates insulin resistance, decreases with obesity in humans and cats. In particular, the more biologically active HMW (high molecular weight) isoform decreases to a greater degree in human subjects than the less active LMW (low molecular weight) isoform. We determined plasma concentrations of total, LMW and HMW adiponectin in client-owned, lean and obese adult, neutered, domestic shorthaired cats.",

Thirty-one beagle dogs (initial weight, 13.5 AE 1.27 kg, age, 11.0 AE 2.23 years) with lameness and radiographic changes consistent with DJD in at least one joint were included in the study. All dogs were fed a control maintenance food for 28 days followed by canine j/d. Canine j/d contains increased levels of EPA and DHA, glucosamine, chondrotin sulfate, Vitamins C and E, and L-carnitine. Blood and urine samples were collected on the last day of the control food and after 14 days on canine j/d. Serum fatty acids, cartilage biomarkers, urine biomarkers, and plasma metabolomics were measured. Orthopaedic exams were performed every 14 days during the study and collars with activity watches were worn throughout the study. Dogs fed canine j/d had significantly higher serum eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexanoic acid at day 14. After consuming canine j/d, arthritic dogs had improved orthopaedic scores at day 14, and reduced night activity compared to while on the control food. They also had lower mean serum concentrations of bone specific alkaline phosphatase, BAP:NTx ratio, CS846:KS ratio, C-reactive protein, and C1,2C at day 14 on canine j/d. As well, serum CPII, CPII:C2C ratio, IGF-1, keratan sulfate, urine LTB4, and urine PGE2 were elevated after consuming canine j/d.

Cycads (also called sago palms) are commonly encountered in various parts of the world. They are part of the native flora in tropical and subtropical regions. Additionally they have been extensively used in residential landscaping in the South of the USA. Cycads produce a variety of toxins that are poisonous to humans and animals. These toxins can be found in all parts of the plant, but seem to be present in highest concentration in the seeds and roots. After ingestion the main toxin cycasin is metabolized by the intestinal flora to its active compound, which is most likely responsible for GI and hepatic toxicity in dogs.

Several laboratory parameters may be helpful in determining the prognosis of intoxicated dogs on presentation. They likely reflect the severity of the liver function decrease, the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, DIC, or a combination of these problems. Liver disease resulting from trauma or inflammation compromises the ability of the tissue to heal and regenerate. In dogs, chronic liver inflammation leads to life-threatening damage. The liver regenerative process relies on the critical participation of pro-inflammatory mediators which are responsible for priming hepatocytes to release growth factors necessary for regeneration. Hepatocytes, the main cellular constituent of liver, account for the regenerative capacity of liver. They also detoxify and metabolize noxious agents. We have developed a hepatocyte culture model that facilitates adhesion, proliferation, and maintenance of hepatocyte phenotype. We used this hepatocyte model to induce inflammation and oxidative stress with the cytokine interleukin-1 beta (IL-1). We then determined whether S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) and silybin (SB), which are known to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, can attenuate this response. SAMe and SB are commonly used to support liver function and are found in commercially available Denamarin s . Both SAMe and SB have been reported to promote protein synthesis in hepatocytes, protect against oxidative stress by synthesizing intracellular glutathione (GSH) for detoxification, and suppress inflammation by inhibiting leukotriene production.",

In humans, vincristine induces gastrointestinal motility disorders due to its neurotoxicity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the gastric motility after vincristine administration and the prokinetic effect of mosapride citrate in these dogs. We used ultrasonographic evaluation to assess daily changes of gastric motility in dogs. The validity of this method was confirmed by its correlation with gastric emptying assessed by the 13 C-octanoic acid breath test in advance. Five healthy dogs were administered vincristine (Oncovin) intravenously at a dose of 0.75 mg/m 2 . Motility index (MI) of antral contraction was ultrasonographically evaluated before injection and daily over a 6-day period after injection. Gastrointestinal adverse events observed during the study were recorded. A significant decrease (P o 0.05) in MI was observed on day 3 (6.64 AE 0.38, mean AE SD) and day 4 (8.02 AE 0.72) compared with pre-injection (10.00 AE 0.62). Gastrointestinal adverse events were observed in 4 dogs (anorexia in 3 dogs, and vomiting, diarrhea, and hematochezia in 1 dog each). When 2 mg/kg of mosapride citrate (Pronamide) was orally administered to same dogs with vincristine and throughout the subsequent 5 days, MI improved significantly on day 3 (11.20 AE 0.52) and day 4 (11.11 AE 1.65). Furthermore, gastrointestinal adverse events occurred less frequently (vomiting and hematochezia in 1 dog each). In conclusion, administration of vincristine induces gastric hypomotility in dogs. Preventive administration of prokinetics such as mosapride citrate improves the hypomotility and may be effective for reducing the adverse gastrointestinal effects of vincristine. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) associated with general anesthesia is one of the most common causes of canine esophagitis and stricture. The ability of proton pump inhibitors and prokinetics to reduce intra-operative gastric and esophageal acid exposure is uncertain.

Improvement was significantly greater in cats fed diet B compared to diet A. Dietary changes should always be considered for cats with chronic diarrhea. Tylosin-responsive diarrhea (TRD) refers to canine diarrhea that responds to tylosin in a few days, but reappears in many dogs a short time after discontinuing the treatment. The daily dosage recommendations for tylosin in canine enteropathies vary in textbooks from 30 to 80 mg/kg. A total of 17 client-owned dogs with diagnosed TRD responding to tylosin at a dose of 25/mg/kg q 24 h were enrolled in the study. The aim of our randomized, blinded prospective clinical trial was to assess if an even lower dose of tylosin is sufficient to stop the diarrhea. At the beginning of the trial all the dogs were taken off tylosin and had normal fecal consistency. A follow-up period of a maximum of two months commenced to determine whether diarrhea would reappear. The owners evaluated and marked down the fecal consistency of each stool according to previously published guidelines using a nine-point scale of one to five with half point intervals. No additional medical treatment or dietary changes during the trial occurred. During the two month follow-up 15/17 of the dogs developed diarrhea, reaching a fecal consistency of at least four on the scale. After onset of diarrhea, the dogs were randomly assigned to two different dosage groups receiving tylosin orally either 5 mg/kg (n 5 8) or 15 mg/kg (n 5 7) q 24h for seven days. The owners were blinded to the dosage. Treatment outcome was evaluated as the mean of fecal consistency scores assigned during the last three days of the treatment period. A responder was defined with a mean value of 3, a non responder of 4 3. Of the dogs 8/8 responded to the 5 mg/kg dose, whereas 6/7 responded to the 15 mg/kg dose and one did not. It is noteworthy that 93% (14/15) of the dogs responding to tylosin at a dose of 25 mg/kg q 24h responded also to the 5 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg q 24h tylosin treatment. The study indicates that a suitable dose of tylosin for the treatment of canine TRD is thus less than the current recommendations in textbooks and could be as low as 5 mg/kg once a day. Dendritic cells are thought to play a vital role in the regulation of gut immunity and maintenance of tolerance to commensal microflora and dietary antigens. Disturbances in dendritic cell number and function may therefore be implicated in the breakdown of gut homeostasis seen in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In mice and humans, CD11c serves as a marker for dendritic cells, and cells expressing this marker have been shown to have similar morphological and functional characteristics in the canine system. The aim of this study was to quantify the expression of CD11c positive cells in the duodenum of dogs with and without IBD using immunofluorescence.",

Counts were made in six areas measuring 400 mm by 300 mm (central villus tip, central mid-villus, left villus tip, left mid-villus, right villus tip and right central villus) in healthy and diseased sections and the total number of cells expressed in 720,000 mm 2 . In addition, counts were also made in three additional areas (central crypt base, left crypt base and right crypt base) in the control sections so that a comparison could be made between the number of CD11c positive cells in the crypt and villus in dogs without IBD. Statistical comparison between areas in normal duodenal sections was made using Kruskal-Wallis test and a comparison between cases with and without IBD was performed using Mann-Whitney U test.",

The depletion of CD11c cells seen in the duodenum of dogs with IBD may reflect an increased migration of these cells to the local mesenteric lymph node to activate na\u0131\u00a8ve T cells and this may be driving the continued T cell inflammation seen in this disease. Future studies will determine whether CD11c is useful as a marker for the diagnosis and monitoring of canine IBD. Nucleotide oligomerisation domain two (NOD2) is an important cytosolic pattern recognition receptor, recognizing muramyl dipeptide (MDP) from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Although single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in several genes have been implicated to play a role in the etiology of Crohn's disease in humans, the most prominent are those in NOD2, with a relative risk of 44 and 38 for compound heterozygotes and homozygotes developing Crohn's disease respectively. Previous studies have shown up-regulation of NOD2 expression in a canine colonic epithelial cell line following challenge with various infectious stimuli, thus suggesting a potential role for this receptor in the pathogenesis of canine IBD. However, to date no studies have been performed to investigate the presence of SNPs in the NOD2 gene in dogs with IBD. The aim of this study was to investigate whether SNPs in the canine NOD2 gene are associated with IBD in German shepherd dogs (GSDs).",

Spirocerca lupi (S.lupi) is a nematode with an indirect life-cycle with the dog as the predominant definitive host. Canine spirocercosis typically results in nodule formation in the caudal esophagus. It has been found that these nematodes shed eggs intermittently. Dogs may become re-infected, presenting with multiple nodules in various stages. Nodules can undergo neoplastic transformation into fibrosarcomas, osteosarcomas and sarcomas. It is reported that worms within these neoplastic nodules do not exist, are not viable or do not shed eggs.

This may indicate that neoplastic nodules may contain fewer worms or that these worms shed fewer eggs. The negative results in some of the non-neoplastic cases might be due to intermittent shedding and immature worms, factors which complicate such an analysis. The use of fecal examination as a tool to differentiate between dogs with neoplastic and non-neoplastic spirocercosis does not appear to be useful, although non-neoplastic cases tend to shed more eggs. The presence of multiple benign nodules concurrently with neoplastically transformed nodules in the 6 dogs (14%) which were excluded makes fecal examination unsuitable as a diagnostic tool in this group. Signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG) is used for identification of ventricular late potentials (LP), low-amplitude electrical signals that occur in fibrous myocardium and are predictors of risk of sudden death. The objective of this study was to determine normal values of SAECG in healthy German Shepherd (GS; n 5 21) and Boxer (B; n 5 17) dogs. Animals were screened by physical examination, arterial pressure measurement, electrocardiography, echocardiography, thoracic radiography, laboratory tests, and 24-hour Holter monitoring. In face of normal results, dogs were submitted to SAECG performance without sedation. The parameters analyzed to detect late potentials were QRSd (width of filtered QRS complex), LAS o 40 mv (low amplitude signal in terminal portion of filtered QRS) and RMS 40 (root mean square of last 40 milliseconds of QRS complex). Statistical analyses was performed by T Student test (P o 0,05) to identify differences in each parameter between the two groups. Boxer dogs may have two forms of cardiomyopathy, the arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and the dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), both of them with frequent ventricular tachyarrythmias.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of late potentials on SAECG of Boxers with ARVC and DCM. Animals were screened by physical examination, arterial pressure measurement, electrocardiography, echocardiography, thoracic radiography, laboratory tests and 24-hour Holter monitoring.

The intensity of training was individually determined by a maximal heart rate (MHR), observed in a maximal progressive effort test. Gradually, the intensity of training was increased in 50% of MHR, in the first week, to 60%, 70% and 80% of MHR in the second, third and fourth weeks, respectively. The paired t test was used to compare data before and after training. The improvement in functional capacity of the dogs was attested by a better performance on the physical test after training, achieving higher levels of intensity (9,0 km/h to 11,1 km/h; p 5 0,0155) and decreasing the area under the curve of lactate (31,2 to 26,0; p o 0,0001). Increase in parasympathetic tone on HRV was verified by SDANN (155,5 AE 35,2 ms to 231,7 AE 46,7 ms; p 5 0,0059), rMSSD (115,3 AE 50,4 ms to 181 AE 51,9 ms; p 5 0,0118), amplitude of heart rate (188,5 AE 21,9 bpm to 200,3 AE 17,5 bpm; p 5 0,0033), and by a higher percentage of respiratory sinusal arrhythmia on a maximal progressive effort test (4 50% until 2 km/h before training and 8 km/h after training).

Plasma renin activity, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin II (Ang II), aldosterone, adrenaline, noradrenaline and urinary aldosterone were measured in the dogs before and after running on a treadmill at 7 km/h for 10 minutes. Benazepril hydrochloride significantly (P o 0.05) decreased ACE (0.9 AE 1.0 U/l) and aldosterone (21.1 AE 16.1 pg/ml) compared with the placebo (4.0 AE 1.5 U/l, 42.9 AE 29.8 pg/ml). Plasma renin activity, Ang II, aldosterone and adrenaline levels increased during exercise. Heart rate and blood pressure significantly (P o 0.05) increased with both placebo and benazepril hydrochloride during exercise, and heart rate and blood pressure did not significantly differ between the two groups. These results suggest that the increase in heart rate and blood pressure during exercise is related to activation of the RAAS and sympathetic nervous system. Therefore, ACE inhibitors might modulate circulatory function and the RAAS during exercise. Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has previously been described in British Shorthair cats (BSH), but until now, no reports have been published on how prevalent the disease is within this breed. The aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of HCM in a large cohort of BSH and to evaluate the effect of gender, weight and age as potential risk factors to presence of the disease.",

All cats were examined by the same two trained ultrasonographers using a Vivid 7 ultrasonographic system (GE Medical) with a 10 S phased array transducer (8-10 MHz). Measurements of the left ventricle were obtained by conventional 2D-and M-mode imaging of right parasternal longand short axis views. Diagnosis of HCM was based on an overall assessment of echocardiographic findings, but cats were classified as to have a concentric hypertrophy if the interventricular septum (IVS) and/or left ventricular free wall (LVFW) measured 4 5.5 mm in diastole. To rule out other causes of left ventricular concentric hypertrophy, a complete blood count, biochemical profile, thyroxin level and blood pressure were measured in affected cats. In the statistical analyses occurrence of HCM was expressed as a percentage and age, weight and echocardiographic variables as mean AE standard deviation (SD). A logistic regression analysis was used to test the effect of gender, weight and age on HCM as outcome and a pvalue of o .05 was considered significant.",

Most affected cats presented with pronounced, diffuse hypertrophic changes affecting the IVS, LVFW and papillary muscles. As in many other breeds, male gender predisposed to development of the disease. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by progressive and irreversible lesions to the nephrons which result in renal failure and, often, in systemic arterial hypertension secondary to the chronic activation of compensatory mechanisms. Although the canine species is used as an experimental model for humans, information about cardiac function, compensatory enzymatic activation and biomarkers for myocardial lesion are scarce. The objective of this study was to clinically characterize the hypertensive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in dogs with CKD. For this purpose, 30 dogs, males and females, with a mean age of 10 years and 16 kg of body weight, were distributed into two groups composed of healthy dogs (control -CG, n 5 10) and dogs with CKD of glomerular origin (CKDG, n 5 20). Both groups were evaluated using non-invasive blood pressure measurement, radiographs, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, as well as measurement of cardiac markers as troponin I, creatine phosphokinase-MB (MB-CK) and enzymes as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), aldosterone and renin. Mitral endocardiosis (ME) and obesity are frequently observed in dogs and as in human patients, lower life time expectation and higher sudden death risks can be expected. Researches enrolling predisposed dog breed to develop ME or using experimental induction of mitral insufficiency indicated decrease in parasympathetic tonus. In the same way, obesity in dogs induced by supplementation of rich saturated fat diet seams to impair the autonomic control. Therefore, to verify in natural conditions we evaluated dogs with Ib functional class of endocardiosis or natural morbid obesity using time domain heart rate variability (HRV).",

Electrocardiograms were registered in the same day time (9 to 11am) and environment, using a three channel digital holter recorder. The variables mean NN, SDNN, SDANN, SDNNi, rMSSD and pNN50 were calculated from two hours of revised ECG. All 32 dogs were free from medical therapy, and other diseases associated with ME or obesity. Normality of data was attested by the Anderson-Darling test, and groups evaluated by ANOVA. MEG and OG were compared with CG by the Dunnett test with 95% probability. The mean values of mean NN (CG-570 AE 51 ms/ MEG -580 AE 94 ms/OG -650 AE 130 ms), SDNN (CG -175,6 AE 46,8 ms/MEG -169,5 AE 56,3 ms/OG -192,3 AE 62,4 ms), SDANN (CG -100,5 AE 33,9 ms/MEG -93,8 AE 34,0 ms/OG -100,0 AE 37,9 ms), SDNNi (CG -139,9 AE 40,8 ms/MEG -137,1 AE 40,1 ms/ OG -164,3 AE 58,1 ms), rMSSD (CG -171,4 AE 51,3 ms/MEG -170,5 AE 76,1 ms/OG -222,1 AE 93,6 ms), and pNN50 (CG -44,6 AE 13,7%/ MEG -51,5 AE 15,8/OG -53,95 AE 13,5%) were not statistically different (p 4 0,05) in comparison between the diseased dog groups (MEG or OG) and the healthy dog group (CG). Although small amounts of sudden death in initial stages of ME in dogs are described, possibly involving decrease in parasympathetic activity, our results allowed concluding that the Ib class of ME class had no influence on the autonomic nervous systems. Similarly, the natural morbid obesity in dogs had no effect on autonomic control, refusing the observations of induced obesity. These values should prove useful for future investigation about advanced phases of ME or obesity in this species. Pulmonary edema is the most common complication of congestive heart failure in dogs. Interstitial pulmonary edema, which usually precedes more severe alveolar edema, may not be radiographically detectable. In human medicine, transthoracic ultrasonography is used to detect narrow repetition artifacts, or comet-tail artifacts, that indicate the presence of edema in the lung.",

It may provide additional information in combination with traditional diagnostic tests for the assessment of dogs with heart failure, the most important being the detection of early signs of heart failure and monitoring of the response to treatment. The objective of this study was to assess the clinical usefulness of measuring plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentrations for assessing the severity of degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD) in dogs. Eighty five dogs with MMVD and 16 healthy control dogs were prospectively examined from October 2009 to December 2009. ANP was measured using a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA). Results of the physical examination and echocardiogram were recorded for dogs with DMVD. ANP was significantly higher in dogs with DMVD (ISACHC Ia: 52.1 AE 45.8, Ib: 78.6 AE 55.5, II: 158.0 AE 132.7, IIIa: 306.7 AE 188.3) as compared with control dogs (12.9 AE 4.0). ANP rose significantly in the groups with progressive heart failure. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.96 (95%CI, 0.93 to 0.99). An ANP concentration 4 15.6 pg/mL could be used to discriminate dogs with DMVD from control dogs with a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 81%. In dogs with DMVD, ANP was significantly correlated with heart rate, the left atrium/aorta ratio, and end-diastolic left ventricle internal diameters. The results indicate that ANP rose with an increase in the left heart load. The ANP may be useful for assessing disease severity in dogs with DMVD. The cardiac biomarkers N-terminal-pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-pro-BNP) and N-terminal -pro-Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (NT-pro-ANP) have been shown to be of value in the diagnosis of heart disease and heart failure in cats. In humans, it is well known that natriuretic peptides are influenced by factors other than primary cardiovascular disease, including hyperthyroidism. The purpose of this study was to investigate natriuretic peptide concentrations in hyperthyroid cats before and after anti-thyroid treatment and to compare them to normal cats.",

This is not unexpected given that abciximab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the human GP IIb/IIIa complex. However, our results are discordant with data from an in vivo feline model. This could suggest that abciximab may have antithrombotic effects outside of the inhibition of platelet-mediated effect on blood coagulation. Concerns have been expressed about adverse cardiovascular effects of high-salt diets. The objective of this blinded study was to compare the effects of normal-versus high-salt diets on systemic arterial blood pressure (ABP), ECG, and several echocardiographic and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) variables in aged cats. Twenty healthy neutered cats (10.1 AE 2.4 years old) were included. Following baseline measurements, cats were randomly allocated in 2 groups according to their glomerular filtration rate, sex, age and body weight. One group was fed a high-salt diet (1.30% sodium, 2.27% chloride, 4000 kcal ME/kg) and the other one a control diet (0.35% sodium, 0.70% chloride). Systolic and diastolic ABP, heart rate, myocardial wall thicknesses, shortening fraction, left atrium/aorta ratio, and lastly, radial and longitudinal systolic and diastolic TDI variables assessed in the left ventricular free wall were measured before, and 3 and 6 months after diet implementation. Statistical analysis was performed using a general linear model.",

            "text": "In conclusion, over a 6-month period a high-salt diet has no adverse effects on ABP and cardiac function in aged healthy cats. We previously reported that dogs developed hypercytokinemia after mitral annuloplasty and were in a state of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) that could have been alleviated by steroid administration before starting extracorporeal circulation (2008 and 2009 ACVIM FORUM). However, the complication rate of pulmonary edema is often high after mitral annuloplasty whereas the incidence of preoperatively elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell (WBC) counts is low. Such preoperative inflammation is thought to facilitate postoperative SIRS. The present study assesses the relationship between prognosis and preoperative inflammation in 20 dogs after mitral annuloplasty. Pre-surgical values for WBC, CRP, Interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 were obtained, and differences in preoperative clinical signs (ISACHC classification), cardiac murmur grade, LA/Ao, WBC, CRP, IL-6 and IL-10 between five dogs that died postoperatively (deceased group) and 15 that survived (surviving group) were determined. Mean age was significantly higher (12.3 AE 1.7 vs. 9.5 AE 1.8 y), and mean body weight was significantly lighter (4.3 AE 1.1 vs. 7.5 AE 2.7 kg) in the deceased, than in the surviving group. Neither WBC nor CRP significantly differed between the groups. Values for IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly higher in the deceased, than in the surviving group (IL6, 197.8 AE 198.1 vs. 4 .3 AE 8.3; IL-10, 29.9 AE 47.3 vs. 2.9 AE 4.6; p o 0.05). These results suggest that besides age, increased IL-6 and IL-10 that indicate preoperative inflammation can help to predict postoperative prognosis.",

Complete blood counts, serum creatinine, EPO, serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC) and transferrin saturation (TSAT) were measured. Levels of EPO were significantly elevated in dogs with DMVD stages Ib, II and IIIa compared with healthy dogs (20.7 AE 8.6, 21.0 AE 9.2, and 21.5 AE 5.6 vs. 11.7 AE 2.0 mIU/mL; P o 0.05). Hematocrit did not differ between each stage. Red blood cell counts were significantly higher in dogs with DMVD stages Ia and Ib compared with healthy dogs (6.50 AE 0.82 and 6.52 AE 0.52 vs. 5.72 AE 0.67 \u00c2 106/ml; P o 0.05). Hemoglobin was significantly higher in dogs with DMVD IIIa than in healthy dogs (17.8 AE 5.71 vs. 13.9 AE 1.61 g/dl; P o 0.05). Serum iron concentrations were significantly lower in dogs with DMVD Ib than in healthy dogs (121 AE 29.4 vs.73.3 AE 42.6 mg/dl; P o 0.05) and TSAT was significantly lower in dogs with DMVD stages Ib and II than in healthy dogs (29.5 AE 8.11% and 30.6 AE 9.07% vs. 42.4 AE 6.80%; P o 0.05). These results suggest that mitral regurgitation modifies erythropoietin production. Right to left (R-L) shunt concurrent with pulmonary stenosis (PS) may cause an unexpected paradoxical embolism and worsening of cyanosis post balloon valvuloplasty due to augmented tricuspid and/or pulmonary regurgitation. The purpose of the study is to investigate the prevalence of R-L shunt due to patent foramen ovale (PFO) in dogs with PS. Clinical signs, echocardiography and CBC were evaluated in 33 dogs diagnosed with PS. Patent foramen ovale was diagnosed when intravenously injected microbubbles appeared at the left atrial level in PS dogs with intact atrial septum on echocardiogram (bubble-positive dogs). In addition, atrial septum was directly observed in 54 hearts from clinically healthy Beagle dogs who were euthanized due to other experimental purposes. Prevalence of R-L shunt due to PFO was 36.4% (12 out of 33 cases). In contrast, prevalence of PFO in healthy Beagle hearts was 0%. The pressure gradient across the pulmonary valve and relative thickness of the right ventricle (RVWd/LVPWd) were significantly increased in bubble-positive dogs compared with bubble-negative dogs. None of the dogs with mild or moderate PS (pressure gradient o 80 mmHg, n 5 2) demonstrated R-L shunt. Clinical signs were frequently observed in bubble-positive dogs, although polycycemia was not a common abnormality. Tricuspid regurgitation was observed in 83% of bubble-positive dogs (48% in bubble-negative dogs). Transient worsening of cyanosis was observed in 2 out of 9 bubble-positive dogs immediately after balloon valvuloplasty. Diastolic hypertension due to thickened right ventricle and tricuspid regurgitation appeared to be responsible for the occurrence of R-L shunt due to PFO. Juvenile dilated cardiomyopathy (JDCM) is an autosomal recessive inherited disease in the Portuguese water dog causing myocardial dysfunction that typically progresses to heart failure and death prior to four months of age. The autosomal recessive inheritance pattern suggests carrier dogs have 50% reductions in the mutant protein, however these dogs do not exhibit any cardiovascular abnormalities and lead normal life spans. Dobutamine stress testing (DST) can identify the extent of myocardial contractile reserve, and has been utilized to predict systolic function improvement with medical therapy in humans, dogs and mice with dilated cardiomyopathy. This study sought to investigate whether DST could identify subclinical myocardial dysfunction in carrier dogs with the genetic mutation for JDCM and to determine if affected dogs demonstrate reduced contractile reserve prior to development of clinical disease.",

DST was capable of identifying affected, subclinical JDCM dogs, but not carriers. Differences between normal dogs and carriers were ex-tremely subtle (and likely not clinically relevant), suggesting the causative mutation affects a protein, which if expressed at 50% normal levels, enables the affected animal to maintain normal cardiac function and a normal response to dobutamine. This finding will be important for researchers who continue to search for the causative mutation.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is characterized by frequent disorganized atrial depolarizations typically associated with less productive atrial contractions, increased ventricular response rates and decreased cardiac output. In veterinary medicine treatment is most often aimed at decreasing heart rate in order to maximize stroke volume via pharmacologic intervention. Assessment of these therapeutic interventions to control heart rate is most often performed utilizing brief in-hospital electrocardiograms. However, twentyfour hour Holter monitor testing allows assessment of the dogs' heart rate in their normal environments.

Median age was 3 years (range, 1-10). Dogs presented for syncope (n 5 4), exercise intolerance (n 5 2), bradycardia (n 5 1). Heart failure was not diagnosed in any dog. Bradydysrhythmias in CP dogs included high grade 2 nd or 3 rd degree atrioventricular block (n 5 6) and sinus bradycardia with 1 st degree atrioventricular block (n 5 1). Ventricular arrhythmias were documented in 4. Outcomes included euthanasia (n 5 4) three of which were cardiac related, sudden death (n 5 1), alive (n 5 1), lost to follow-up 36 months post-pacemaker implantation (n 5 1). Median survival was 12 months (range, 0-36). Dogs with sudden death or euthanasia related to cardiac disease were paced for 5, 12, 36 months. In one dog, the presence of multiform ventricular arrhythmias, troponin I of 17.8 ng/mL and difficulty maintaining capture with a temporary pacemaker led the owner to elect euthanasia prior to permanent pacemaker implantation. Bradydysrhythmias can result in clinical signs requiring pacemaker implantation in CP dogs. Progressive cardiac disease or sudden death are possible outcomes in this population. An ultrasound contrast agent Sonazoid s allows for vascular and parenchymal imaging in the liver and spleen. Sonazoid s -enhanced ultrasonography improves the diagnostic accuracy to differentiate benign and malignant focal liver lesions in dogs. The utility of Sonazoid s for the differentiation of splenic lesions, however, has not been determined. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to clarify the utility of Sonazoid s -enhanced ultrasonography for the differentiation between benign and malignant focal splenic lesions. In a prospective study, Sonazoid s -enhanced ultrasonography was performed for 29 dogs with focal splenic lesions. Qualitative assessment of the enhancement pattern was performed in early vascular phase, late vascular phase, and parenchymal phase. Histology (n 5 24) or cytology (n 5 5) identified 13 benign and 16 malignant lesions. In the late vascular phase, hypoechoic pattern was significantly correlated with malignancy (P 5 0.001) with a sensitivity of 81.3% [95% Confidence Interval (CI), 65.7-89.5%], a specificity of 84.6% [95% CI, 65.4-94.8%]. In the early vascular phase, hypoechoic pattern was significantly correlated with malignancy (P 5 0.02) with a sensitivity of 37.5% [95% CI, 24.7-37.5%], and a specificity of 100% [95% CI, 84.2-100%]. On the other hand, there was no significant difference between malignant and benign lesions during the parenchymal phase. The detection of hy-poechoic nodule in the early and late vascular phase with Sonazoid s -enhanced ultrasonography was strongly suspicious of canine malignant splenic lesion. Oxidative stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of many systemic diseases, including tumors. Lymphomas comprise one of the most common groups of tumors in cats. The aim of this study was to evaluate the oxidant/antioxidant total status and erythrocyte antioxidant defense in cats with lymphoma. Blood samples were obtained from 17 cats with lymphoma, at the diagnosis and without previous treatment and 23 healthy cats (control group). Systemic oxidative status was measured by the analysis of malondyaldehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant status (TAS) was measured by the use of a commercial kit (Randox Laboratories Ltd). In red blood cells hemolysated, were determined reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSHpx), glutathione reductase (GSHr) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), using commercial kits.(Randox Laboratories Ltd). Kolmogorov Smirnov followed by Mann Whitney or T student tests was used to compare the groups. Median of TAS was significantly lower (p 5 0.0039) in cats with lymphoma (1.30 mmol/L) than in healthy cats (1.57 mmol/ L). There was no difference in the MDA between the groups (mean 0.658 and 0.566 mM respectively). Mean of GSH was significantly lower (p 5 0.0337) in cats with lymphoma (24.06 mg/dL) than in healthy cats (31.02 mg/dL). There were no difference in the enzymes GSHpx, GR and SOD.",

This may be explained by increased oxidation caused by DOX or, alternatively, this trend may represent a movement toward normalcy with treatment. Production of reactive oxygen species is the result of aerobic metabolism for energy production. Oxidative stress is an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidant defense mechanisms in favor of the oxidants. Proteins, lipids and DNA oxidative damage can contribute to aging, mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. SOD is an antioxidant enzyme that catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide to oxigen and hydrogen peroxide, protecting cells from injury induced by free radicals. Lymphomas comprise one of the most common groups of tumors in dogs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD) concentration in dogs with multicentric lymphoma (ML) when compared to healthy dogs. Blood samples were obtained from 24 dogs with ML, at the diagnosis and 20 healthy dogs (control group). Dogs with signs of concurrent disease or that were previously treated with prednisone or chemotherapy were excluded from the study. SOD was measured in red blood cells hemolysated by the use of a commercial kit (Ransod -Randox Laboratories Ltd). Kolmogorov Smirnov followed by Mann Whitney tests were used to compare the groups. Median was significantly lower (p 5 0,0168) in dogs with multicentric lymphoma at the diagnosis (1.751,6 U/g Hb) than in healthy dogs (2.237,3 U/g Hb).",

Further studies are necessary to verifiy if this alteration may contribute to inadequate erythrocyte survival and the development of anemia in canine lymphoma. Alimentary lymphoma is the most common anatomic form of lymphoma in the cat. Our purpose is report a prospective analysis of feline alimentary lymphoma, presenting clinicopathological, therapeutical and prognostic data, from 32 cats with diagnosis of alimentary lymphoma seen at a private Cat Clinic in Sa\u02dco Paulo -Brazil, from January 2004 to July 2009. All the 32 cats were treated with a combination of L-asparaginase, prednisone and chlorambucil. Response to treatment was defined as either complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR) or no response (NR). The following variables were evaluated for their effect on response to the treatment and survival times: age, sex, breed, infection or not by feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), clinical signs, histologic and immunophenotype classification of the lymphoma and chemotherapy toxicity. Fisher's exact test was used to determine the statistical influence of these factors on the response to the treatment. Kaplan-Meier survival statistics were used to determine overall survival times and Cox regression was used to determine the influences of these variables on the duration of survival time. A P value o 0.05 was considered significant.",

We reconfirmed the strong and specific DLA class II allele/haplotype association for NME in Pug Dogs. DLA class II genotyping of the Chihuahuas showed Chihuahuas to have more allelic diversity than Pug Dogs. There was no apparent association between specific DLA class II genotypes or haplotypes and NME in Chihuahuas. Therefore, NME in these two breeds either has no genetic associations in common, or if genetic associations exist, they are outside of the DLA class II genes or at other loci in the genome.

Assessed type of disc protrusion/extrusion (acute versus chronic) correlated well between MRI and surgical assessment. We conclude that it is difficult to distinguish between mineralized disc material and hemorrhage on MR images following acute disc herniations. However, chronicity of herniation can be predicted from MRI. We hypothesize that MR imaging of spinal plasma cell tumors (PCT) is more sensitive than survey radiography in the detection of solitary and multifocal lesions. A multicenter retrospective case series of 10 dogs with a cytologic or histologic diagnosis of PCT was used to identify the typical MR appearances of this tumor type. Tumoral signal characteristics were examined with a high-field strength MR using T1-weighted (T1W), T2-weighted (T2W), short tau inversion recovery (STIR), and T1W post-gadolinium sequences. Other variables evaluated were signalment, clinical signs, disease progression, serum globulin concentrations, radiographic findings, lesion location and presence of spinal cord compression. Radiologic interpretation was blinded with respect to MR imaging findings. Mean age was 12 years (range 9-14). Three of 10 dogs were Labrador retrievers. No sex predilection was noted. All cases presented for paraparesis and 8 dogs showed paraspinal hyperesthesia. Serum globulins in 8 dogs were outside the reference range (2.7-3.8 g/dl) with a mean concentration of 4.6 g/dl (SD 1/\u00c0 1.16). Three dogs had focal and 5 dogs had multifocal evidence of axial skeletal osteolysis, while 2 had no identifiable lesions on radiography. All dogs had multiple identifiable spinal lesions on MR studies. All lesions identified on T2W were hyperintense relative to paraspinal musculature. Identified lesions on T1W were hypointense (4/10), isointense (3/10) and hyperintense (3/10). Degree of contrast enhancement in the affected vertebra was variable, with one showing no enhancement. STIR sequences were uniformly hyperintense and identified all lesions visible on radiography and other sequences. Importantly, in all 10 dogs, between two to twelve lesions were identified on STIR that was not seen on radiography. Eight dogs had lesions in the thoracic spine and 7 dogs in the lumbar spine, with none in the cervical spine. Sites deemed safe for biopsy were best identified using MR imaging. All dogs had 1-3 compressive spinal cord lesions not associated with fracture or subluxation, suggesting the presence of intraspinal expansile osteolysis. Compared to survey spinal radiography, MR imaging is a sensitive modality to detect vertebral sites of PCT. Lesion conspicuity is greatest on STIR sequences. PCT can be highly proliferative and expansile, resulting in invasion into the spinal canal. Little is known about the etiology of DAWS. The relative size and shape of the vertebral canal have been proposed as potential risk factors for this disorder. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if selected vertebral ratios, representing vertebral canal stenosis, could be used to differentiate between Doberman Pinschers with and without DAWS.",

From these measurements, the following three radiographic ratios were calculated from C3 to C7: canal body ratio (CBR), defined as VCHm/VBH; longi-tudinal ratio (LR), defined as VCHm/VBL; caudal to cranial height ratio (CCHR), defined as VCHcd/VCHcr.

Cell clustering is a recognized feature of disc degeneration in hu-mans, and future studies comparing normal with degenerative canine discs would be of interest. Improving our knowledge of normal cervical disc structure and organization will allow us to understand the mechanisms involved in the initiation and progression of intervertebral disc degeneration. The aim of this study was to determine the biomechanical characteristics of the canine lumbar spine in flexion and extension following three different internal fixation techniques. 1. Cortical screws and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), 2. SOP TM locking plate system with cortical screws placed bicortically and 3. SOP TM locking plate system with cortical screws placed unicortically. Fifteen canine cadaver lumbar spines from L2-L5 were collected from dogs ranging from 23-36 kg. A fracture was simulated in each lumbar spine at the L3-L4 vertebral space by performing bilateral facetectomies and discectomy. The spines were then stabilized with one of the three fixation techniques and subjected to incrementally increasing flexion and extension bending moments in a 4-pointbending hydraulic machine. Force and displacement were recorded during each loading cycle. Fixation techniques were compared on load to failure, defined as bending or breaking of the implant or to an overall displacement of greater than 1/\u00c0 25 mm, which represented a disc space angle of 10 degrees. None of the spines fixed with the SOP plates with bicortically placed screws failed at the stabilized L3-L4 fracture site, but failed either due to fracture of the facets or an endplate of adjacent vertebrae. Four of the five specimens fixed with PMMA failed due to cracking of the PMMA and one failed due to fracture of adjacent facets. The PMMA group had less overall displacement of the entire L2-L5 spine as compared to the other groups; however, further analysis of the biomechanics at the L3-L4 disc space is warranted. Idiopathic Epilepsy (IE) is the one of the most common neurological disease in dogs with a prevalence reported between 1 and 5%. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a useful tool in veterinary medicine for the determination and classification of seizures and for the evaluation of cerebral function in patients with intracranial disorders including IE. Based on human studies, first-time short-term EEG (less than 30 minutes) has a diagnostic yield to detect pathological activity between 22 and 25%. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the utility of a single outpatient short-term EEG recording (between 20 and 60 minutes) in detecting pathological activity in dogs diagnosed with IE and to determine whether the ability to detect pathological activity was influenced by the time between the last documented seizure and EEG recording.",

Neurological examinations, CBC, biochemistry profile and brain MRI were normal in all dogs. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of suspected IE was made. Upon presentation, each dog was sedated to effect with propofol (1-6 mg/kg IV) to allow the setting of a canine standardized EEG electrode montage. Using a routine video-synchronized EEG system, all subjects underwent a recording that lasted for a minimum of 20 minutes up to a maximum of 60 minutes. The period of time between the last documented seizure and the EEG recording was categorized as ''acute'' (up to 7 days) or ''chronic'' (greater than 7 days). 22% (5/23) of the recorded subjects presented pathological activity of which 80% (4/5) occurred within the first 20 minutes of recording, whereas the other 20% (1/5) occurred within a 60-minute recording period. Overall, 61% (14/23) of all dogs had EEG recorded within 7 days following the last documented seizure and 39% (9/23) of all dogs were recorded within the ''chronic'' period (after 7 days following the last documented seizure).

D-dimers are degradation products of cross-linked fibrin generated by the action of plasmin and, consequently, specific indicators of fibrinolysis. Plasma D-dimer concentration is a sensitive marker of systemic fibrinolytic activity and it is widely used for the diagnosis of thromboembolic disease in humans and animals. Inflammation and coagulation are interrelated processes that may affect each other. Inflammation leads to activation of coagulation, but coagulation also affects the inflammatory response. The aims of this study were: 1. To assess fibrinolytic activity in the CSF of canine patients affected by different neurological disorders by measuring CSF D-dimer concentrations, 2. To compare CSF D-dimer concentration between different etiological groups, and 3. To determine whether CSF D-dimer concentrations were related to plasma D-dimer concentrations.

            "text": "One hundred and forty CSF samples were collected from 133 dogs. Seven dogs were sampled two times (pre-and post-treatment): 5 SRMA, 1 suspected cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and 1 meningoencephalitis of unknown etiology (MUE). Citrated blood samples were obtained from all dogs at the time of CSF sampling. Following initial CSF analysis, CSF and plasma D-dimer concentrations were detected by a quantitative immunoturbidimetric latex agglutination assay. Dogs were grouped into eleven categories according to the disease process (vascular [mainly ischemic CVAs], idiopathic epilepsy, idiopathic non-epileptic disorder, traumatic CNS disorder, SRMA, MUE, extraaxial neoplasia [mainly meningiomas], intra-axial neoplasia [mainly gliomas], extra-dural compressive spinal cord disorder, degenerative spinal cord disease, and control group [non-neurologic diseases]), and median and range of CSF D-dimer values were calculated. Statistical differences in CSF D-dimer concentrations were found between different groups (p o 0.05), with the highest CSF D-dimer values in the SRMA and the extra-axial neoplasia groups. No relationship was found between CSF D-dimer and plasma D-dimer levels by lineal regression (R 2 5 \u00c00.02). Statistical differences were found between pre-and post-treatment CSF D-dimer concentrations in the SRMA group (p 5 0.016). Results of this study indicate that CSF fibrinolytic activity in dogs can be measured using the D-dimer assay. Diseases such as SRMA and extra-axial neoplasms induce higher concentrations of CSF D-dimers, and CSF D-dimer levels do not seem affected by plasma D-dimer concentrations, which suggest the existence of intrathecal fibrinolytic activity in some inflammatory and neoplastic CNS disorders. CSF D-dimer levels can be a good indicator of response to treatment in cases of SRMA. The underlying etiology and pathophysiology of encephalitis and myelitis in canine patients is usually enigmatic. Cytokines and chemokines are proteins that control the immune response through effects on leukocytes and other immune cells and evaluation of these molecules might provide insight into the mechanisms of inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine cytokine and chemokine levels in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of canine patients diagnosed with meningoencephalitis or meningomyelitis of unknown etiology (MUE). A canine-specific, multiplex assay (Milliplex MAP, Millipore) was used to analyze interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8 (CXCL8), IL-10, IL-15, IL-18, interferon (IFN)-g, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 (CCL2), interferon-inducible protein (IP)-10 (CXCL10), and keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC or CXCL1) in these samples. Compared with control dogs, a number of patients with MUE showed elevations of IL-2, IL-7, IL-15, IL-18, GM-CSF, CXCL1, and CCL2 in serum and IL-2, IL-8, and CCL2 in CSF. These patterns suggest an environment favoring the proliferation and maintenance of lymphocyte populations (including memory cells) in the peripheral compartment (IL-2, -7, -15, CCL2), while promoting lymphocyte proliferation and survival within the CNS (IL-2, CCL2). IL-18 also supports lymphocyte proliferation and has been identified as an important cytokine contributing to CNS inflammation in other species. Serum GM-CSF and CSF CCL2 may help drive monocyte production in the periphery with subsequent recruitment into the CNS of dogs with MUE. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of enzymes responsible for maintenance and remodeling of the extracellular matrix throughout the body after cleavage from latent to active form. MMP-2 and -9 in particular have been implicated in the pathophysiology of a variety of disease processes, including tumor invasion and encephalitis. Latent MMP-2 is present in normal canine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), but the presence of MMP-9 indicates pathology. This study evaluated levels of active and latent forms of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the CSF of dogs with CNS disease. Samples of CSF from patients with intracranial meningiomas (n 5 12), gliomas (n 5 5), choroid plexus tumors (n 5 3), lymphosarcoma (n 5 3), and inflammatory CNS disease (n 5 9) along with normal control animals (n 5 6) were evaluated using gelatin zymography. All samples showed bands consistent with latent MMP-2. Active MMP-2 was not detected in any samples. Bands consistent with latent MMP-9 were seen in CSF from patients with meningioma (n 5 1), glioma (n 5 1), choroid plexus tumors (n 5 3), lymphosarcoma (n 5 3), and inflammatory CNS disease (n 5 1). Bands matching active MMP-9 were seen with 1 meningioma, 1 glioma, 1 animal with inflammatory disease, 1 choroid plexus tumor, and 3 lymphosarcomas. Patients with detectable MMP-9 had higher nucleated cell counts in the CSF than those without (P 5 0.0009). This data suggests that MMP-9 may play a role in the pathogenesis of a subset of intracranial tumors and encephalitis afflicting canine patients. Evaluation of MMPs in CSF may prove useful in the diagnosis, monitoring and prognosis of patients with intracranial disease. Tumor-immune system interactions are complex. Studies of brain tumors in humans and experimental animals have shown improved survival with immune cell infiltration; however, these tumors may create an immunosuppressive environment that impairs this response. Cytokines and chemokines mediate the immune response through effects on immune cells. The purpose of this study is to examine cytokine and chemokine levels in the CSF and serum of dogs with intracranial neoplasia. Canine-specific, multiplex cytokine/chemokine assays (Milliplex MAP, Millipore) were used to analyze transforming growth factor-beta (TGFb1, -b2, -b3), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8 (CXCL8), IL-10, IL-15, IL-18, interferon-gamma (IFN)-g, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2), and keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC/CXCL1) in samples from dogs with intracranial meningiomas (n 5 23), choroid plexus tumors (CPT, n 5 6), lymphosarcoma (LSA, n 5 6), and gliomas (n 5 13). Evidence of immunosuppression included CSF TGFb1 elevations in several dogs with gliomas or CPT, a trend towards increased CSF TGFb2 in dogs with tumors compared to control samples, and elevations in serum IL-4 and IL-10 in a few patients. Proinflammatory changes were mainly limited to elevations of serum IL-6 and IL-18 in some dogs. Cytokines associated with lymphocyte survival and proliferation (IL-2, IL-7, IL-15) were noted in the serum of a number of dogs with a variety of tumor types. There appeared to be consistent elevations of CCL2 and IL-8 in the serum and CSF of dogs with tumors when compared with controls, which may facilitate immune cell recruitment into the CNS. Syringomyelia (SM) is a disorder characterized by fluid-filled cavitations of the spinal cord leading to parenchymal disruption and generation of severe neurological signs. The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) breed is overrepresented for this condition with an incidence rate of 50%. The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity of transcranial magnetic motor evoked potentials (TMMEP), somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP), spinal evoked potentials (SEP) and brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAER) in the assessment of motor and sensory pathways throughout the central nervous system of CKCS dogs with and without SM diagnosed by MRI.",

Both the 14 and 16 gauge needles provided adequate tissue for histological interpretation (96-100%). There was a significant relationship between the amount of aspiration pressure and the amount of tissues obtained for both gauges (p o 0.05). However, the amount of aspiration pressure did not affect the degree of tissue artifact for both gauges (P 4 0.05). Overall, we conclude the 16 gauge side-cutting biopsy needle is just as effective as the 14 gauge needle for obtaining brain tissues for histopathology in dogs. Based on Dunn's Multiple Comparison Test, the most effective aspiration pressure for both gauges was 2.0 ml. Hydrocephalus is a common congenital or acquired neurologic condition in dogs and has been managed surgically for several decades. However, there is a lack of data and long term follow up on ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) placement in dogs with hydrocephalus for which no active cause was identified.

The overall NF-H concentration and the recovery of hindlimb locomotor function depended on the severity of the injury; the severe group being the worst and the mild group being the best. In canine SCI models, changes of post-injury NF-H levels showed different patterns in 2 dogs; NF-H levels increased sharply after injury with the peak on day-3 in first dog whereas the levels increased slowly with the peak on day-9 in the other dog. Significant motor recovery was not observed in either dog. These findings suggest that measurement of NF-H allows assessment of lesion severity and may aid in judging prognosis of SCI. NF-H is a unique biomarker of SCI and can be used to assess the efficacy of prospective neuroprotective agents in future SCI research. Acute polyradiculoneuritis (AP) is a sporadically occurring peripheral neuropathy of dogs of unknown etiology. A multicenter retrospective study is being undertaken to characterize the clinical disease course and outcome of dogs with AP and to identify prognostic indicators. A total of 86 cases of canine polyradiculoneuritis diagnosed between 1982 and 2009 were identified. Preliminary data analysis including 32 of these cases is reported here. Dogs that presented with an acute development of diffuse lower motor neuron signs and normal cranial nerves were included. Animals presenting for a relapse of a previous polyradiculoneuritis episode or clinical and/or diagnostic features consistent with myasthenia gravis, tick paralysis, botulism, or paraneoplastic neuropathies were excluded. Recorded data included: signalment, concurrent illnesses, vaccination history, raccoon encounters, number of days hospitalized, progression of clinical signs during hospitalization, and electrodiagnostic results. The severity of clinical signs at the time of presentation, rapidity of disease progression, secondary complications, survival to discharge, and clinical outcome were assigned numerical scores. Dogs that died before discharge had more rapid disease progression than those that survived (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, median progression score 1.75, 4.0 respectively, p 5 0.022). There was no significant association between initial disease severity score and outcome. These results suggest that severity of disease at diagnosis is not prognostic in dogs with AP, but that dogs with rapid disease progression are less likely to survive. The cutaneous trunci muscle (CTM) is a thin but extensive sheet of skeletal muscle that covers most of the dorsal and lateral walls of the abdomen and thorax, and is innervated by the lateral thoracic nerve. Nociceptive stimulation of the skin elicits a CTM reflex contraction. This reflex is commonly used to localize spinal lesions, but there is little data available on the CTM reflex in normal dogs. The purpose of this study was to describe the sensory field, contraction strength and latency of the CTM reflex in normal dogs of different breeds and ages. The caudal border of the CTM reflex sensory field was evaluated in 100 dogs aged 2 to 10 years and 50 dogs aged 11 years or older. Hemostatic forceps were used to stimulate the skin two centimeters from the dorsal midline, starting at the level of the seventh lumbar (L7) dorsal spinous process and moving cranially until the CTM reflex was elicited. The border of the reflex was expressed as the corresponding vertebra identified by palpating the dorsal spinous processes. The lateral borders of the CTM reflex were evaluated in 50 dogs and the distance from the midline to the lateral border was expressed as a percentage of the hemi circumference of the trunk at each of four levels (the caudal border of the scapulae, the 13 th thoracic and 3 rd and 6 th lumbar dorsal spinous processes). The mean and median values were calculated. Finally, the strength and latency of ispilateral and contralateral contraction were described at the same four levels.",

The caudal border was at L5 in three of the 2 to 10 year old dogs and at L1 and L3 in two old dogs.

The median percentage was 70% at the level of the scapulae, and it decreased caudally to 53% at the level of L6.

The lateral borders of the CTM reflex extend further ventrally than previously believed; the dorsal cutaneous branches of the thoracic and lumbar spinal nerves provide the afferent arm of the CTM reflex and are reported to supply the dorsal third of the thorax and abdomen only. We conclude that either the sensory field of these cutaneous nerves is larger than believed, or that the lateral cutaneous nerves also contribute to the CTM reflex. This description of the normal CTM reflex provides baseline data for studies of the abnormal CTM reflex in dogs with thoracolumbar myelopathies. Acute intervertebral disc herniations occur most commonly between the eleventh thoracic and second lumbar vertebrae. Lesions in this location cause the caudal border of the cutaneous trunci reflex (CTMR) to advance cranially. We propose that changes in the caudal border of the CMTR in the immediate post operative period are predictive of outcome in dogs with acute, severe intervertebral disc herniations. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the CTMR in the post-operative period in dogs that have suffered a severe spinal cord injury due to an acute thoracolumbar disc herniation, and to compare these changes with the outcome.",

Pituitary-dependent hypercortisolism (PDH) is a very common endocrinopathy in dogs, generally caused by an ACTH-secreting corticotroph adenoma although the underline pathogenesis is still unknown. There is a high incidence of PDH in Poodles and familial pituitary-dependent hypercortisolism have been identified suggesting a genetic involvement. An increased CRHR1 expression was demonstrated in human and canine ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas, despite the autonomous ACTH secretion and the low portal levels of CRH. In addition, prolonged exposure of human corticotroph adenoma cells to CRF does not result in receptor desensitization. The aim of the present study was to screen the Crhr1 gene for mutations in genomic DNA from Poodles with PDH. Fifty Poodle dogs (33 female, median age of 8.71 years, range 1.5 to 14 years) with PDH were studied. The diagnosis was based on clinical signs (polyphagia, polyuria, polydipsia, abdomen enlargement, panting) and cortisol levels 4 1,4 mg/dl after dexamethasone suppression test, plasmatic ACTH levels 4 17 pg/ml, bilateral adrenal enlargement at abdominal ultrasound, hyperlipidemia, hyperphosphatasemia, low urinary density. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood, amplified by PCR using intronic primers to amplify 13 exons, and submitted to automatic sequence. The coding sequence was compared to the canine Boxer genomic DNA sequence available at NCBI site. We found the heterozygous allelic variation p.V97M (GTG 4 ATG) in exon 4 in one dog. To investigate if this variation is a mutation or a single nucleotide polymorphism, we studied fifty normal poodle dogs (32 female, median age of 9,38 years, range 6-16 years) and p.V97M was not found in one hundred normal alleles. The codon 97 is located in the extracellular aminoterminal domain of the CRHR1 and is extremely important for high affinity ligand binding. The molecular study of the quaternary structure of normal and mutated proteins showed a structural rearrangement of the mutated protein by changing the contact surface between the CRH and its receptor, Crhr1, resulting in a 17% higher binding energy comparing to the wild type. In conclusion, this study identified a Crhr1 gain-offunction mutation, probably responsible for ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism in a poodle dog of our cohort. Pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH) is a common canine endocrinopathy that results in bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia and small breeds are at increased risk for developing PDH. Adrenal thickness (caudal polar width) evaluated by ultrasonographic is an important tool to determine adrenocortical hyperplasia and the current cut-off for PDH diagnosis is 0.75 cm.However, a markedly variability in adrenal thickness has been reported in normal dogs, from 0.2 to 0.7 cm, probably reflecting weight-associated variation. Our aim was to determine the size of the adrenal glands ultrasonographically in normal healthy dogs weighing 10 kg and compare these measurements in dogs with PDH with similar weight. Ultrasonographic adrenal gland evaluation was performed in 50 dogs with PDH (30 females and 20 males) from various breeds (30 Poodles, 7 Teckels, 6 Yorkshires terrier, 1 Maltese and 6 mongrel dogs) and in 109 healthy control dogs. The diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism was based upon the characteristic signs and symptoms, such as polyphagia, polyuria, polydipsia, abdomen enlargement, panting, hyperlipidemia, hyperphosphatasemia, low urinary density and cortisol levels 4 1,4 mg/dl after dexamethasone suppression test. PDH dogs had similar age in comparison with control ones (8.7 AE 2.6 vs. 7.7 AE3.4 y., p 5 0.07), but they were heavier than controls (7.7 AE 1.4 vs. 5.9 AE 2.2 kg, p o 0.001). There was no difference in breed distribution between both groups. There was no difference between left and right adrenal thickness measurements, which was positively correlated with animal weight (r 5 0.41, p o 0.001) and age (r 5 0.364, p o 0.001) in control group but not in PDH group. All dogs with PDH had bilaterally symmetrical normal shape adrenal glands. Adrenal thickness measurement in PDH dogs (0.74 AE 0.12 cm) was significantly greater than adrenal thickness in control dogs (0.5 AE 0.11, p o 0.001). ROC curve analysis suggested that adrenal thickness measurement ! 0.59 cm has the highest accuracy for PDH diagnosis. Using this cutoff 45 (90%) of PDH dogs presented at least one enlarged adrenal, whereas 28/109 (25.7%) of control animals had adrenal thickness 4 0.59 (sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 74%). Using the classical cut-off for adrenal thickness measurement of 0.75 cm, only 24 (48%) of PDH dogs of this cohort will be considered as having enlarged adrenals. In conclusion, our results indicate the need to correlate the thickness of the adrenal glands with the dog's body weight to improve the sensitivity of adrenomegaly detection in PDH dogs. Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of metabolic abnormalities that increases the risk for type 2 diabetes and vascular disease. Pituitarydependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH) is one of the most common endocrinopathies in dogs. PDH, characterized by excessive levels of glucocorticoids, results in increased glucose and insulin levels which cause insulin-mediated effects on adipose tissue, ultimately promoting visceral adiposity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and hypertension. This group of abnormalities is observed in obese human patients with metabolic syndrome and at least three of these events must occur simultaneously in the same individual to confirm the metabolic syndrome diagnosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in dogs with PDH. Seventy-seven dogs (54 females, mean age of 9.5 AE 2.6 years) from various breeds with untreated PDH were evaluated in the University Guarulhos Veterinary Hospital over a period of 4 years. The diagnosis of PDH was based on clinical signs (polyphagia, polyuria, polydipsia, abdomen enlargement, panting), cortisol levels 4 1.4 mg/dl after dexamethasone suppression test, bilateral adrenal enlargement at abdominal ultrasound, hyperlipidemia, hyperphosphatasemia and/or low urinary density. The metabolic syndrome investigation was based on measurement of systolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose paired with basal insulin levels, serum cholesterol and triglycerides. Blood pressure measurement was conducted in 62 dogs and fasting serum insulin was determined in 35 recent cases. Sixty per cent of the dogs (n 5 37/62) had arterial hypertension with an average systolic pressure of 164 AE 24 mmHg. Elevated blood levels of cholesterol (mean AE SD, 382 AE 155 mg/dl) and triglycerides (181 AE 108 mg/dl) were observed in 74% (n 5 57/77) and 75% (n 5 58/77) of the cases, respectively. Absolute basal hyperinsulinemia (37 AE 27 mUI/ ml) associated to normoglycemia (81 AE 11 mg/dl) was observed in 68.5% (n 5 24/35) of the dogs. All animals with insulin resistance had dyslipidemia (increased blood levels of cholesterol or triglycerides). Hypertension and dyslipidemia was observed in 54.8% (n 5 34/62) of the dogs in addition to visceral obesity. In conclusion, a significant number of PDH dogs of our cohort presented metabolic syndrome, confirming that hypercortisolism shares many characteristics of metabolic syndrome and should always be investigated in order to reduce morbidity and mortality of this endocrinopathy. Considerable evidence suggests that food has a significant impact on the gastro-intestinal (GI) function and the microbial ecology of the canine GI tract. The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of dietary carbohydrates and animal-derived proteins with high collagen concentrations on the canine colonic microbiota.",

Therefore, significant changes in the total number of bacteria in response to omeprazole treatment may not have been discovered. The role of Helicobacter spp. (H. felis -HF, candidatus H. heilmanni -HH, and H. bizzozeronii -HB) in the pathogenesis of gastric disease in dogs and cats remains poorly understood, whereas in people, gastric colonization by H. pylori is causally associated with gastric mucosal inflammation, ulceration and neoplasia. The epidemiology and major mode of transmission of Helicobacter spp. is still unknown, despite 4 20 years of research, but zoonosis is not considered an important aspect of H. pylori acquisition. Gastric infection with non-H. pylori species has, however, been associated with gastritis and MALT lymphoma in 0.25% to 6.0% of human Helicobacter infections, which suggests a zoonotic risk. This is supported by the recent PCR-based discovery of Helicobacter genus DNA in the saliva and dental plaque of 4 70% of dogs (n 5 27/38).

Lastly, fecal colonization with Proviable s species was independent of individual weight (in both cats and dogs) or age (in dogs). Further studies are warranted to corroborate our findings using other probiotic formulations. Several studies have reported a high prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances in racing sled dogs during strenuous exercise, the cause of which is unknown. While a recent study has not shown an association between exercise and enteropathogens in sled dogs using bacterial culture, the global intestinal microbiome has not yet been studied. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the intestinal microbiota in fecal samples obtained from racing sled dogs before and after a 300 mile race. To assess the effect of 2 different types of exercise, samples were also obtained from a group of working Retrievers before and after a field trial, during which dogs ran 4.4 miles.",

Further studies are needed to clarify whether these changes observed contribute to clinical signs reported in the sled dogs or if they reflect an adaptation to physiological changes within the GI tract that occur during exercise. Tritrichomonas foetus (T. foetus) is a flagellated protozoan parasite that has been recently recognized as an important cause of diarrhea in cats. It primarily colonizes the surface of the distal ileal and colonic mucosa, leading to chronic or intermittent diarrhea.

It is concluded that routine prophylactic antibiotic treatment in dogs undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy is not necessary. Vigorous exercise, such as running a marathon, has been associated with gastrointestinal disturbances in people. Similarly, previous studies have revealed a high prevalence of gastrointestinal abnormalities in racing sled dogs during strenuous exercise. Affected dogs frequently have diarrhea, and up to 61% of dogs develop gastric mucosal erosions and/or ulcers. Increased intestinal permeability has also been demonstrated. The cause of these changes is currently unknown. N-methylhistamine is a stable metabolite of histamine and has previously been shown to be increased in fecal samples from dogs with gastrointestinal disease.

Larger scale studies are needed to determine whether pancreatitis may occur as a rare complication in dogs treated with MA. The exocrine pancreas synthesizes enzymes (e.g., pancreatic lipase) and zymogens of digestive enzymes (e.g., trypsinogen), stores them in zymogen granules, and releases them into the pancreatic duct system in response to gastrointestinal hormones. To measure canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (cPLI) in small intestinal chyme or fecal extracts in response to varying dietary components such as protein, fat, and carbohydrates, an assay with a high analytical sensitivity is needed. The aim of this study was to analytically validate a previously described radioimmunoassay (RIA) for the measurement of cPLI in chyme and fecal extracts from dogs.",

COMMD 1/\u00c0 Beagle-Bedlington terriers, although asymptomatic, may have an uncharacterized defect that results in liver cobalt accumulation. Early impaired CD8 1 and CD4 1 CD25 \u00c0 T cell immune responses, reminiscent of anergy, correlate with activation of CD4 1 CD25 1 T regulatory cells (Treg) in AIDS lentiviral infections. Using the FIV model, we reported previously that CD4 1 CD25 1 T regulatory cells in both the acute phase and long-term, asymptomatic phase of infection are constitutively activated and suppress CD4 1 CD25 \u00c0 and CD8 1 T cell immune responses. T cell anergy is defined by G 1 cell cycle arrest and failure to proliferate in response to appropriate stimulation. Because Treg cells are known to induce G 1 cell cycle arrest in T cell targets; we asked whether Treg cells altered the expression of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases and their inhibitors that regulate progression from G 1 to S phase. To address this question, lymphocytes were obtained from SPF negative control cats or cats chronically infected with NCSU 1 FIV and sorted by FACS into CD4 1 CD25 1 and CD8 1 populations. Following either 12 or 24 hour co-culture with CD4 1 CD25 1 cells, CD8 1 target cells were examined by western blot for changes in cyclins D 3 , E and A, retinoblastoma protein (Rb), as well as the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) p15 ink4b , p21 cip1 , and p27 kip1 . Following co-culture with CD4 1 CD25 1 Treg cells, we have observed up-regulation of p21 cip1 and cyclin E with down-regulation of cyclin D 3 , and cyclin A in CD8 1 cells from FIV 1 cats; while little change was noted in p15 ink4b and p27 kip1 expression. As expected, CD8 1 targets from FIV-negative control cats were relatively quiescent with little up-regulation of p21 cip1 and cyclin E as was observed in the FIV 1 cats. Hyper-phosphorylation of Rb is consistent with irreversible commitment to S phase; and further investigation showed there was a lack of Rb phosphorylation in CD8 1 target cells consistent with late G 1 cell cycle arrest. We are currently performing FACS cell cycle analysis in CD8 1 targets, following CD4 1 CD25 1 co-culture, to confirm G 1 cell cycle arrest. Collectively these data suggest that CD4 1 CD25 1 Treg cells are activated in FIV 1 cats in vivo and induce anergy of CD8 1 T cell targets by disruption of normal G 1 to S regulatory mechanisms.",

Bartonella henselae is a zoonotic pathogen causing cat scratch disease and bacillary angiomatosis. We investigated the role of BadA as a pathogenic factor on inflammatory response and angiogenesis in HUVECs to help understanding the bacterial pathogenesis. We prepared the recombinant BadA protein using the pET-28a Expression System and evaluated the expression of pro-inflammatory related adhesion molecules and cytokines, and VEGF in HUVECs incubated for 6, 12, 24 and 48 h after treatment of BadA (200 ng/ml) using comparative RT-PCR and ELISA analysis. We also investigated the proliferation of HUVECS and quantitative adherence of U937 monocytes to HUVECs after BadA treatment (200 ug/ml). BadA exhibited very minimal endotoxic activity in HUVECs incubated for 24 and 48 h at a concentration of 100-1000 ng/ml. BadA also showed the enhanced ability on proliferation of HUVECs and on adherence of U937 monocytes to HUVECs. The expression of E-selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, IL-8 and MCP-1 mRNA were significantly increased in HUVECs from 6 to 48 h after BadA treatment (p o 0.05). The expression levels of IL-6, IL-8 in HUVECs culture supernatant was significantly higher at 24 h and 48 h after treatment of BadA than control (p o 0.05), which is in accordance with the results of RT-PCR analysis. Interestingly, the expression of VEGF mRNA and protein was significantly upregulated at 24 h in HUVECs after BadA treatment (p o 0.001). Our data show that BadA stimulates inflammatory response in HU-VECs as well as production of VEGF, implicating BadA plays an important role in Bartonella pathogenesis including cat scratch disease and bacillary angiomatosis.

The purpose of the present study was to determine if there was an association between Leishmania, FIV and FELV infections in 211 adult cats from Arac\u00b8atuba, Sa\u02dco Paulo, Brazil, an endemic area for visceral leishmaniasis. Leishmaniasis diagnosis was based on serology by ELISA (cut-off: 0.365), IFAT (cut-off: 1:40) and direct parasitological examination by needle aspiration biopsy of lymph nodes and bone marrow. Serology for FIV and FeLV was determined by the SNAP Combo FeLV Ag/ FIV Antibody Test (IDEXX Laboratories). From the 211 cats, 16 (7.58%) had amastigote forms of Leishmania sp either in lymph nodes or in bone marrow without the presence of antibodies against Leishmania chagasi; two (0.94%) were both serologically and parasitologically positives and 12 (5.68%) were only serologically positives, totalizing 30 (14.21%) infected cats. From the 30 positive animals, in four (13.33%) were detected antibodies against FIV, and in one (3.33%) we detected the FeLV without antibodies against FIV. Twenty five (83.33%) cats were infected by Leishmania sp without FIV or FeLV infections, and eight (26.66%) cats had antibodies against FIV without evidence of Leishmania sp infection.

Aiming to identify the nature of muscular lesions, biopsies of the triceps brachii, extensor carpi radialis, biceps femoris and gastrocnemius muscles were made from 25 dogs naturally infected with Leishmania chagasi. The biopsies were performed under general anesthesia, with the protocol accepted by the Ethical Commission from the Veterinary Medicine Course from the Sa\u02dco Paulo State University. The samples were evaluated by the hematoxylin-eosin stain. Only one animal (4%) had all muscular samples within normality. In two dogs amastigote forms of the parasite were identified in muscular fibers. From 25 animals with visceral leishmaniasis, 20 (80%) showed degeneration and necrosis of muscular fibers; twelve (48%) developed a mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate, suggesting a myositis of an immunological nature; 15 (60%) developed a reducing in the diameter of the muscular fibers; 14 (56%) showed perimysial and endomysial fibrosis and 10 (40%) displayed adipose tissue in the endomysial and perimysial region, suggesting that the inflammatory myopathy was in a chronic stage.

            "text": "FHV-1 DNA and FCV RNA can be amplified from samples collected from apparently healthy, vaccinated cats and which could represent current subclinical infection or shedding of vaccine strains. These findings should be considered when attempting to interpret results of molecular diagnostic assay results from clinically ill cats. The inability of traditional serologic testing, such as microscopic agglutination testing (MAT), to provide reliable data in acute cases of human and canine leptospirosis has led to the development of novel testing modalities. Currently, the most commonly used novel technique is quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). This modality, performed on whole blood, has been used successfully in the diagnosis of human and animal disease and is currently offered commercially by a number of veterinary laboratories. The common usage of available bacterin based canine Leptospira vaccines presents a unique challenge for the use of whole blood qPCR as a diagnostic tool, since recent vaccination might induce an artifactual false positive result if the targeted DNA fragment is present within the vaccine. This is especially problematic in the weeks after vaccination when high vaccinal MAT titers already complicate the diagnosis of true infection. The aim of this study was to assess whether the 2 currently available (in the US) 4 serovar vaccines induce a positive qPCR reaction in healthy recently vaccinated dogs. Following owner consent -20 student and staff owned dogs at Cornell University, College of Veterinary Medicine were enrolled in the study. Each dog was randomly assigned to 1 of 2 vaccine groups: A purified sub-unit vaccine (Fort Dodge Animal Health s ) or a microfiltered bacterin vaccine (Pfizer Animal Health s ). Both vaccines included Leptospira interrogans serovars Pomona, Canicola and Icterohaemorrhagiae and Leptospira kirschneri serovar Grippotyphosa. A very sensitive (has been shown to be able to identify 1-2 leptospiral bacterial copies per sample) 16S qPCR assay previously validated for use in canine blood was utilized. Whole blood for qPCR and serum for MAT testing was collected from each dog prior to vaccination (day 0), as well as 3 and 7 days after vaccination and weekly thereafter for 8 weeks. Negative (canine blood, mastermix, water) and positive controls (cultured organisms diluted in canine blood and a standard curve) were run in triplicate on each plate as were the experimental samples. Both Leptospira vaccines produced a positive qPCR reaction when assayed undiluted or diluted 1:100 in canine blood. Vaccines not including Leptospira antigens, run as controls, were negative. All blood samples drawn at all time points for all vaccinated dogs were negative for the presence of Leptospira DNA. These results suggest that recent vaccination with the commonly used canine vaccines in the United States does not interfere with the use of qPCR for the identification of acute Leptospira infection in dogs. The ability of vaccines to prevent renal colonization and urinary shedding for at least 1 year after vaccination is an important objective when vaccinating dogs against leptospirosis. Little is known about the degree of success of many vaccines in achieving this goal. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of vaccination on renal colonization in experimentally infected dogs more than a full year following vaccination. Forty young dogs were divided into 2 groups: Vaccinates and controls. Vaccinates received 2 doses, 3 weeks apart of a multi-valent inactivated bacterin vaccine against 4 serovars of Leptospira spp. including Leptospira kirschneri serovar Grippotyphosa. Controls were unvaccinated. The groups were age and sex matched, and the dogs were allowed to co-mingle during the study. An intraperitoneal and subconjunctival challenge with Leptospira kirschneri serovar Grippotyphosa was given approximately 15 months after the second vaccine. The dogs were sacrificed on day 35 following challenge. Blood was tested by microscopic agglutination test (MAT), a whole cell Leptospira ELISA and Western blot and blood and urine were cultured for Leptospira spp. on multiple days. Renal histopathology was evaluated and scored in a blinded fashion from all dogs. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed on DNA purified from 2 separate urine samples as well as from frozen renal tissue from all dogs in a blinded fashion using a16S qPCR assay previously validated for use in canine blood (L16). All dogs were determined to be serologically negative by MAT (for 4 serovars), Western blot and ELISA at the time of challenge. Vaccination significantly reduced the scores of qPCR (urine and renal tissue), renal histopathology, and blood, urine, and kid-ney reisolation (p o 0.001). Renal qPCR was positive in 10/21 control cases, and 2/19 vaccinates. Positive urine reisolation or qPCR results were not observed in any vaccinates, while 16/21 controls were positive on reisolation and 11/21 controls were positive on qPCR. This study demonstrates that vaccination can protect dogs from leptospiral colonization of the kidneys and urinary shedding even when the challenge occurs more than a year after vaccination and at the time of negative serologic tests including MAT. Hemoplasma (hemotropic mycoplasma) causes hemolytic anemia in infected domestic cats. There are three species of Mycoplasma known to cause hemoplasmosis, Mycoplasma haemofelis (Mhf), Candidatus M. haemominutum (CMhm) and Candidatus M. turicensis (CMt). Mhf is known to be more pathogenic than the other two species. Most infected cats become asymptomatic carriers; however, immunosuppressed cats are likely to experience acute onset of disease. Previously, an epidemiological study concerning hemoplasma infections in cats was carried out in Japan. The number of cats included in this study was small and clinical information was limited. In the present study, we conducted a nation-wide molecular epidemiological survey of feline hemoplasmosis to investigate its infection rate, clinical characteristics, and the identity of hemoplasma species.",

The final number of cats included in this study was 1,770; 465 (26.3%) were infected with one or more species of Mycoplasma. The infection rate for each species was 5.1%, 21.0% and 6.7% for Mhf, CMhm and CMt, respectively.

The immunofluorescence assay (IFA) is a well-accepted method used to test human and animal serum samples for evidence of vector-borne infection. While IFAs usually possess very good sensitivity, they have been shown to have reduced specificity due to antibodies which cross-react with common proteins among closely related organisms. The goal of this study was to compare the IFA with ELISA-based assays that use peptides derived from speciesspecific proteins or protein sub-domains found in the following organisms of interest: Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Aph), Anaplasma platys (Apl), Ehrlichia canis (Eca), Ehrlichia chaffeensis (Ech), and Ehrlichia ewingii (Eew). We compared the serological results from these five assays with those from three commercially available IFAs using samples derived from dogs experimentally infected with each of the five pathogens (23 dogs tested in total). At least three time points were tested; day 0, day 14-30 pi, day 60-90 pi. All samples from day 0 of the respective infection study tested negative on the peptide-based assays, but two were seropositive for E. canis by IFA. The following table summarizes by assay the number of dogs testing positive for antibody at a minimum of one time point post-infection.",

While cross-reactivity within a genus is to be expected, reactivity across genera typically occurred at a lower endpoint dilution. Our data also suggests these peptide assays possess comparable sensitivity to IFA. The assays derived from species-specific analytes may offer an alternative to IFAs with comparable sensitivity, improved specificity and greater ease-of-use.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is one of the major positive acute phase proteins in the dog. It is produced in response to infection and inflammation, but is non specific as it is part of the innate host response. In humans, CRP has shown potential as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in a variety of neoplasms namely Hodgkin's lymphoma amongst others. In dogs, CRP is elevated in multicentric lymphoma and is useful in predicting complete remission status. Spirocerca lupi (S. lupi) is a nematode of canidae which commonly infests the esophagus, forming a nodule which can undergo neoplastic transformation into a sarcoma. Both benign and malignant nodules show histopathological evidence of inflammation. Currently the determination of malignant transformation is based on histopathology samples obtained via endoscopy, an invasive and expensive procedure. Samples obtained are often falsely negative due to the necrotic periphery of the tumor. The purposes of this study were to determine if serum CRP concentration is (1) elevated in spirocercosis, (2) could be used to differentiate benign from neoplastic cases and (3) could be used to monitor response to treatment in dogs with benign spirocercosis.",

Serum inorganic phosphate and total calcium levels decreased over time but remained well within the reference range. White and red blood cell counts were normal at all observation time points with a slight but significant decrease of erythrocyte counts over time. Blood hemoglobin levels and packed cell volume also steadily decreased to achieve levels in the low reference range at the end of the 4.5 year observation period. The majority of animals showed mild accumulation of indoxyl sulfate in blood without significant changes over time.",

The BD Vacutainer TM plus urinalysis preservative tube is better than the refrigerated plastic tube for preventing in vivo crystalline debris formation. The measurement of cytokine concentrations within body fluids provides a means to recognize subclinical and/or unresolved infectious or inflammatory states in patients. In the urinary tract such information could be useful in identifying asymptomatic bacteriuria, recurrent infections, and non-infectious inflammatory conditions. Complicating the development of reliable testing is the inherent biological nature of urine. Urine can vary widely in composition, as indicated by the range of pH and urine specific gravity (USG) observed in healthy patients. Other contributing variables include urinary protein and carbohydrate moieties that create a matrix capable of hindering immunologic testing modalities, such as ELISA. The purpose of this study was to optimize a sandwich ELISA capable of accurately measuring IL-6 within the urine of dogs. IL-6 is one of the primary inflammatory cytokines produced in the urothelium following exposure to bacterial virulence factors. Standard dilutions of a capture polyclonal goat anti-canine IL-6 antibody and a detection biotinylated goat anti-canine IL-6 antibody were utilized to optimize the chemiluminescent quantification of canine recombinant IL-6 within a dynamic range of 4 ng/ml to 15 pg/ml. Urine obtained from purpose bred beagles and/or clinical samples spiked with 4 ng/ ml of IL-6 failed to replicate the standard curve with cytokine quantitative recoveries as low as 30% in neat samples and o 70% after 1:64 dilutions. To counteract nonspecific binding of IL-6 to matrix components, reagent diluents composed of bovine serum albumin combined with goat serum, proprietary calcium chelators, and/or proprietary non-mammalian proteins were tested. Diluents containing calcium chelation combined with non-mammalian proteins achieved the best results, improving quantitative recovery of IL-6 in the spiked samples to 4 75% for all dilutions. The increased recovery came at the cost of reducing the range of IL-6 detection to 4 ng/ ml-62.5 pg/ml. The effects of pH and USG variability on the ELISA were also assessed. Identical urine samples with an adjusted pH range of 5.5 to 9.5 revealed no appreciable effect on urine IL-6 measurements with quantitative recoveries all within 1/\u00c0 15% of each other. USG was more variable as spiked undiluted samples with USG o 1.015 had significantly (p o 0.01) lower quantitative recoveries compared to samples with USG between 1.030 and 1.040. There was no significant difference when comparing undiluted samples with USG of 1.015-1.040, however the quantitative recoveries did vary from 55%-85%. The use of matrix neutralizing agents was able to improve a previously unacceptable ELISA allowing for the measurements of IL-6 within the urine of dogs. The testing is imperfect as urine variables such as USG can alter IL-6 recovery and hence may underestimate IL-6 concentrations by as much as 45% for samples with USG o 1.015. For many tests this would be diagnostically un-acceptable however given that IL-6 is not found within the urine of healthy individuals, absolute values are less critical than relative amounts of cytokine present. There is a need for non-invasive methods to reliably identify tubulointerstitial disease in its early stages in dogs with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Proteomic techniques are powerful tools that can aid in the discovery of new biomarkers of renal injury. The objective of this study was to identify predictive biomarkers of early tubulointerstitial injury in urine of male dogs with X-linked hereditary nephropathy (XLHN) using SELDI, which is a proteomic technique that combines chromatography with mass spectrometry to detect proteins and protein fragments.",

Regarding the statistically significant peaks, more abundant protein was generally present as renal disease progressed, especially for those peaks 4 20 kDa. Peaks at 11.5 and $21 kDa are similar to those identified as markers of renal disease in a previous veterinary study, while the remaining peaks may serve as candidates for novel markers of early renal disease. Renal failure is treated by peritoneal dialysis, but the catheters often cause difficulties. We designed a new method of implanting disk-type PD catheters and compared it with the conventional straight catheters. Four healthy dogs were anaesthetized using isoflurane, placed in the dorsal position and disinfected. A catheter was inserted through a small incision made 3$5 cm above the umbilicus. The tip of the cath-eter was positioned at the bladder side for the conventional procedure, and the catheter disk was positioned between the liver and the diaphragm during the new procedure. Peritoneal dialysis was performed using 500 ml of dialysate and the amount drained and time required for drainage were measured. We collected 4 100% of the infused dialysate within 30 minutes using the new method, whereas the catheter became obstructed using the conventional procedure which rendered dialysate collection impossible. These results indicate that our new procedure is effective for performing peritoneal dialysis in small animals. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of a test food on whole blood gene expression profiles when fed to cats with appendicular degenerative joint disease (DJD). Thirty-one domestic short hair cats (initial weight, 4.2 AE 1.27 kg, age, 12.1 AE 2.98 years) with lameness and radiographic changes consistent with DJD were included in the study. All cats were fed a control food for 28 days followed by a test food. The test food contained increased levels of DHA and EPA, methionine, manganese, Vitamins C and E, and L-carnitine. Whole blood samples were collected on the last day of the control food and after 14 days on the test food. After consuming the test food for 14 days, cats with DJD had decreased expression of the 6 genes (INDO, ANXA1, MMP8, CD79a, ODC1, and STXBP2) previously identified to be up-regulated in DJD versus healthy geriatric cats. These genes are associated with cartilage degradation, B cell function, polyamine synthesis, and protein trafficking. In summary, feeding the test food to cats with DJD resulted in reversal of the gene expression patterns previously observed in the blood of cats with DJD versus healthy geriatric cats after 14 days. Furthermore, this study helps increase the understanding of how the test food may aid in improving mobility in cats with DJD at the molecular level. A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of Prescription Diet s canine j/d TM on selected arthritis related genes in whole blood when fed to dogs with osteoarthritis (OA). Thirty-one beagle dogs (initial weight, 13.5 AE 1.27 kg, age, 11.0 AE 2.23 years) with lameness and radiographic changes consistent with OA in at least one joint were included in the study. All dogs were fed a control maintenance food for 28 days followed by Prescription Diet s canine j/d TM . Canine j/d contains increased levels of EPA and DHA, glucosamine, chondrotin sulfate, Vitamins C and E, and L-carnitine. Whole blood samples were collected on the last day of the control food and after 14 days on canine j/d. Improved orthopedic exam scores were noted in these dogs after 14 days on canine j/d. After consuming canine j/d for 14 days, OA dogs had increased expression of 22 genes (IL-6, ADAMTS-4, IFNG, HAS2, BGN, SOX-9, ADAMTS-5, MMP3, ACP5, IL1A, TNC, HAS3, COMP, IGF-1, GHR, Xaa-Pro Peptidase, RANKL, SMAD7, PGE2, TLR9, PLOD1, and SCL2A9) that were previously demonstrated to be down-regulated in OA versus healthy geriatric dogs and decreased expression of ANXA1 that previously was shown to be up-regulated. In summary, feeding canine j/ d to dogs with osteoarthritis resulted in reversal of the gene expression patterns previously observed in the blood of arthritic versus healthy geriatric dogs after 14 days. Furthermore, this study helps increase the understanding of how Prescription Diet s canine j/d TM improves mobility in arthritic dogs at the molecular level. The aim of this study was to determine whether a therapeutic diet with increased levels of manganese, methionine, n-3 fatty acids, and reduced n-6:n-3 fatty acid ratio was effective in the management of cats with historical, clinical and radiographic signs of appendicular degenerative joint disease (DJD). 47 adult cats were recruited prospectively from 21 veterinary clinics in Europe for an open-label clinical trial. The cats underwent a veterinary examination that included scoring the severity of overall arthritic changes on a scale of 1-5 for the presence of lameness, joint swelling, reduction in joint movement and pain on joint manipulation. Owners were also asked to score (on a scale of 1-5) seven aspects of their cat's mobility including the cat's willingness and ability to jump, presence of stiffness or pain, the amount of time spent playing and interacting, grooming behavior and overall activity levels. Cats were transitioned onto the therapeutic diet over 7 days and then fed the diet exclusively for 30 days after which time the clinical evaluation and questionnaires were repeated. Following feeding of the therapeutic diet, there were significant improvements seen in all of the parameters evaluated. The most marked and frequent changes seen were an improved ability to jump, reduced stiffness, increased activity, reduced lameness and reduced pain on joint manipulation. The results of this study suggest that feeding the therapeutic diet may have a significant impact on the morbidity associated with feline DJD and that comparison to a scientific control diet is warranted to confirm these observations.",

A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of Prescription Diet s canine b/d TM on inflammatory biomarkers and gene expression in healthy geriatric dogs. Twenty-nine geriatric beagle dogs (initial weight, 13.51 AE 1.66 kg, age, 10.7 AE 2.33 years) were included in the study. All dogs were fed a control maintenance food for 28 days followed by Prescription Diet s canine b/d TM . Canine b/d contains increased levels of omega 3 fatty acids, lipoic acid, antioxidants from a fruit and vegetable blend, Vitamins C and E, and L-carnitine. Serum and whole blood samples were collected on the last day of the control food (day 0) and after 14 days on canine b/d. Inflammatory and hormone biomarkers as well as gene expression changes were measured. RNA was extracted according to the procedures provided in the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit Handbook (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA was hybridized to an Affymetrix GeneChip Canine-2 Genome Arrays and normalized using Robust Multi-Array Average. Transcripts having a P o 0.05 (following a false discovery rate adjustment value of 0.2) and a fold change range of at least 1.25 were considered different. After consuming canine b/ d, geriatric dogs fed Canine b/d had lower IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, KC, and total cytokines. No differences in hormone biomarkers were detected. Geriatric dogs fed Canine b/d also had 1123 genes that were up or down regulated compared to day 0. Of these, genes associated with amyloid beta plaque formation were down-regulated while genes associated with clearance of beta amyloid plaque were up-regulated. In addition, genes associated with neurotransmitter signaling and cell adhesion were significantly up-regulated when geriatric dogs were fed Canine b/d compared to the day 0 on the control. This study provides gene expression evidence that support the benefits observed in geriatric dogs for memory and behavior associated responses previously shown with Prescription Diet s canine b/d TM . Non-sedated healthy adult cats (5.11/\u00c01.7 kg) withheld from food for 12-hrs were used to 1)validate an open-flow indirect calorimetry (IC) system determining REE, 2) validate a multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (MF-BIA) device estimating total body water (TBW) for LBM calculation, and 3) normalize REE against LBM.",

Lipoic acid is a coenzyme of several enzyme complexes involved in energy metabolism. It also functions as a biologic antioxidant attributable to its thiolane ring structure which undergoes oxidationreduction chemical reactions. Previous work has shown lipoic acid to act as an antioxidant in dogs but it is unknown what the lowest effective supplementation is for antioxidant benefits. As such the antioxidant effects of graded levels of lipoic acid inclusion in dry dog food were evaluated in 50 dogs. Racemic alpha-lipoic acid was added to a control food (C) at levels of approximately 50 ppm, 100 ppm, 150 ppm and 300 ppm on a dry matter basis for administration to the five different groups (n 5 10 per group). All other dietary constituents were held constant in the formulation. All 50 dogs (M 5 25, F 5 25) were fed the control food for 2 months prior to allocation into groups. Serum chemistry, complete blood count, vitamin E, GSH:GSSG ratio, malondialdehdyde, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, CD4:CD8 ratio, body weights and fecal scores were evaluated monthly for 3 months. Data were analyzed with a repeated measures procedure with day 0 and concentration of vitamin E in serum as covariates. The concentration of vitamin E in serum was used as a covariate because lipoic acid has been shown to spare vitamin E. Adjusted means of the GSH:GSSG ratio for the different groups were as follows; B 5 13.1 AE 2.2, 0 5 16.8 AE 2.5, 100 ppm 5 16.3 AE 1.8, 150 ppm 5 19.3 AE 1.7, 300 5 16.9 AE 1.8. Supplementation with lipoic acid resulted in a significant increase (P o 0.05) of GSH:GSSG ratios in foods for adult dogs at all inclusions administered above control. There were no significant differences between groups in which lipoic acid was added for the previous GSH:GSSG ratios, however, the highest adjusted mean occurred at the 150 ppm inclusion level. No significant improvements were noted in the other outcomes measured and, no adverse changes were observed in either clinical chemistry or complete blood count analyses at any time points. In conclusion, addition of racemic lipoic acid to dry dog food resulted in a significant antioxidant benefit with no adverse effects noted at doses lower than 150 ppm as previously reported. Specific biologic benefits other than antioxidant activity remain to be determined. A prior study showed that a high protein, low carbohydrate, moderate fiber food induced ketosis in obese cats during weight loss. The objective of this study was to determine the effect dietaryinduced ketosis on body composition during weight loss in obese cats.",

Age and gender have little effect on the body composition of neutered grown cats. A study was conducted to evaluate the affect of dietary crude protein and lysine:calorie ratio in healthy adult and geriatric cats on body composition and kidney health. The study utilized 25 healthy adult (5.6 AE 0.81 years of age (range 5-7)) and 25 geriatric American short hair cats (11.1 AE 2.1 years of age (range 8-15), initially 4.64 AE 1.18 kg.Cats were blocked by age, gender, urine specific gravity, and body fat and assigned to one of five experimental maintenance foods (34% crude protein (CP), 34% CP with ideal amino acid balance, 34% CP with 5.5 lysine:calorie ratio, 44% CP, or 54% CP) for the 180 day feeding period. Chemistry screens, glomerular filtration rate, serum bone biomarkers, serum and urine kidney biomarkers, DEXA scans, and microalbuminuria were evaluated at day 0, 30, 90, and 180. No differences in kidney function as measured by glomerular filtration rate, microalbuminuria, urine specific gravity, serum creatinine, urine creatinine, or urinary biomarkers of kidney function were detected. Body weight and fat changes over time were unaffected by dietary treatment. Most interestingly, cats fed the 44% and 54% CP treatments had decreased bone mineral density (P o 0.01) at day 180, bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) (P o 0.05) at day 90, and BAP:NTX (N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen) ratio (P o 0.05) at day 90 indicating greater bone turnover compared to the 34% CP 5.5 lysine:calorie ratio food. This study suggests that feeding foods containing crude protein levels of 34-54% do not affect kidney health, lean muscle mass, or fat mass in healthy adult and geriatric cats. However, feeding high CP foods (44% and 54%) appears to have negative consequences on bone mineral density through increased bone turnover. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of feeding a low protein therapeutic renal food on lean body mass in senior cats. Hill's Prescription Diet s Feline k/d s dry (28.2% crude protein, 22.6% crude fat 0.52% phosphorus and 0.24% sodium on dry matter basis (DMB)) was fed for maintenance (average intake 46.2 AE 2.6 grams) to twelve senior cats (average age 5 10.05 AE 2.20 years (range 7 to 13 years); average weight 5 5.49 AE 1.03 kg; average creatinine 5 1.23 AE 0.07 mg/dL) for a period of four months. Cats were group housed and had free access to water. Additionally, cats were offered enrichment toys, received routine grooming, and had daily opportunities for socialization with other cats and people. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA; DXA-QDR-4500, Hologic, Inc., Waltham, MA) scans were performed at months 0, 2 and 4 to assess the effect of the food on body weight, total fat mass, lean body mass and bone mineral content during the study. Cats consuming this food maintained total body weight, total fat mass, lean body mass and bone mineral content throughout the study. In summary, senior cats fed a low protein (28.2% crude protein on DMB) therapeutic food for maintenance were able to maintain body weight and lean body mass. Established reference intervals for biochemical analytes in normal adult cats are likely based on values from cats consuming diets with a low to moderate level of protein and may not accurately reflect values in cats consuming a diet high in protein. If cats consuming high protein diets have higher serum renal values, they may be inappropriately switched to a renal diet early in life based on suspicion for renal disease. The objective of this study was to determine whether healthy cats eating diets high in protein have higher serum renal values without a corresponding change in renal function.",

However a longer feeding period may be needed to demonstrate clinical significance. This study evaluated the effects of age on cell killing ability of neutrophils and on the expression levels of specific mRNA neutrophil migration or killing function genes. Three groups of Beagle dogs were evaluated in a cross sectional study design: puppies less than 1 year of age (n 5 15), adults 1 to 7 years of age (n 5 37), and senior adults over 8 years of age (n 5 25). The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Hill's Pet Nutrition, Inc., Topeka, KS, USA. Neutrophil phagocytosis and killing of Lactococcus lactis was assessed, and the relative abundance of mRNAs for myeloperoxidase (MPO), Lselectin, interleukin-8 receptor (IL-8R), and interleukin-1b-converting enzyme (ICE) was determined. Results showed a significant effect of age on percent bacterial killing by neutrophils with phagocytic ability at 4 and 10 years of age reduced by 25% and 39% (compared to 1 year of age), respectively. In addition, younger dogs had significantly higher levels of mRNA for IL-8R, L-selectin, and ICE. These results suggest that older dogs have depressed innate immune responses compared with younger dogs, which may contribute to increased morbidity and mortality with aging. Additional studies are needed to determine how dietary modifications can enhance neutrophil functions in adult and senior Beagle dogs. Two studies were used to evaluate the effect of dietary protein varying from 15% to over 30% dry matter (DM) protein on the senior dog's ability to maintain lean body mass (LBM). All dogs were exercised daily, and were provided with regular opportunities for socialization and environmental enrichment. Dog enrichment included toys in their enclosures, paired housing for a portion of each day, and trips to an indoor and/or outdoor group socialization area. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Hill's Pet Nutrition, Inc., Topeka, KS, USA. In the first study, 70 beagle dogs (average age 13.8 years) were fed one of five different foods with protein concentrations, with or without added amino acids, varying from 15.4 to 30.7% dry matter (DM) protein. In all treatments, over the six month period there was a numeric increase in lean body mass. There was no linear or quadratic effect of protein or amino acid supplementation on LBM. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) increased linearly with dietary protein concentration, and normal albumin, hematocrit and hemoglogin were maintained. In the second study a food designed for nutritional support of animals with renal disease (Prescription Diet s k/d s ) with 14.8% (DM) protein was fed for four months to 34 healthy adult dogs (average age 13.0 years). This resulted in an increase in LBM (P o 0.05), a decrease (P o 0.05) in creatinine and BUN, and no change in albumin. In conclusion these data show that controlling dietary protein concentration to levels (15% DM) of highly digestible protein, used in some foods designed for aid in the management of renal disease is sufficient to meet the protein requirement of the senior dog. The quantity of increased fluid intake needed to produce a significant risk reduction for urolith formation in cats has not been defined.

Profender modified-release tablets (Bayer HealthCare) have been authorized and commercialized in Europe since 2008: this product contains two active substances, emodepside and praziquantel. Emodepside is a member of a new class of cyclic desipeptide compounds, acting at the neuromuscular junction by stimulating presynaptic receptors belonging to the secretin receptor family, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasites. The approved indication is ''For dogs suffering from, or at risk from, mixed parasitic infections caused by roundworms and tapeworms...''. The applicant identified that emodepside is a P-gp substrate drug, and tolerance studies in dogs showed that its margin of safety is lower in Collies than in common breeds.",

P-gp is involved in the active cellular efflux of a large number of drugs and transports many structurally and pharmacologically unrelated hydrophobic compounds. In the central nervous system (CNS), P-gp is found in the capillary endothelial cells that form the blood brain barrier. So, the role of P-gp is particulary important for the protection against accumulation in the CNS of P-gp substrate drugs and their subsequent neurotoxicity. P-gp is also disposed on the biliary canalicular membrane of hepatocytes and on the apical side of enterocytes. A 4-bp deletion mutation of MDR1/ABCB1 gene was described in ivermectin-sensitive Collies and many other dog breeds (e.g Australian Shepherds, White German Shepherds). This mutation generates a premature stop codon, preventing synthesis of the complete and active protein product.",

The main findings of our study support this scenario. The presence of fiber group atrophy, suggesting neurogenic lesion, edema and fibrosis observed exclusively in human and canine pathologic soft palate samples probably appears in response to chronic hyperstimulation and vibration. Those lesions could contribute to UA collapsibility. On the other hand, several authors described an increased proportion of fast-twitch type II fibers in UA dilator muscles of patients with OSAS, due to overuse. Our findings indicate that there is a similar proportion of fiber type II in the soft palate between patients and controls, suggesting that soft palate presents a different muscular activity in comparison with other UA dilator muscles. Our findings manifest that there are important similarities between human patients and bulldogs with an UA obstructive syndrome, confirming this breed as a good animal model for human OSAS. Rhinitis and asthma often co-exist in people, and there is growing experimental evidence to suggest that they are two points along a continuum of airways disease. The potential relationship between rhinitis and asthma in cats has not been investigated. We have developed an experimental model of feline asthma, using the aeroallergen Bermuda Grass Allergen (BGA), which histologically replicates the spontaneous condition.

Insulin resistance has been implicated as a predisposing factor in horses that suffer from recurrent laminitis. A similar metabolic syndrome in donkeys with recurrent laminitis is proposed. Three hundred and ninety four new donkey arrivals at The Donkey Sanctuary, UK were evaluated over a 12 month period (October 2008-November 2009). Age, sex, body condition score (BCS out of 5), whether they were obese (BCS ! 3.5), history of previous laminitis and the occurrence of laminitic bouts within one month of sampling were recorded. Glycaemic status was assessed by means of resting glucose and insulin analysis and the derivation of surrogate (proxy) values. General linear models were performed to determine significant associations. There were 114 (28%) females and 280 (72%) geldings; 75 (19%) had a history of previous laminitis, 43 (11%) had a laminitic episode within one month of sampling and 122 (31%) were classed as obese. There was a statistically significant difference in mean serum insulin(mIU/ml), RISQI (reciprocal of the square root of insulin; [mU/L] \u00c00.5 ) and MIRG (modified insulin-to-glucose; [mU ins ] 2 /10.L.mg gluc [Insulin o 50 mIU/ml]) values between donkeys classified as obese(20.86) and non-obese(7.31; P o 0.001), previously laminitic (23.83) and not (8.52; P o 0.001), and postsampling laminitic (22.84) and not (10.08; P o 0.001). There was also a significant difference in insulin and MIRG values between male (9.15 and 4.28) and female donkeys (17.2 and 5.13; P 0.014) with higher values in females, due to more female donkeys being obese and having a history of laminitis (P o 0.001). This study has determined mean insulin values (4.95) and associated insulin sensitivity proxy measurements (RISQ 0.6; MIRG 3.79) in non-obese donkeys with no history of previous laminitis in the UK, and has also shown that there is an association between insulin resistance/ metabolic disease and laminitis observed in donkeys.",

            "text": "Insulin resistance has been associated with predisposition to laminitis in horses and ponies and frequently accompanies nutritional obesity in this species. In humans and rodents, macrophage infiltration of adipose tissue (AT) correlates with adiposity and degree of tissue and systemic insulin resistance. These cells adopt an inflammatory phenotype, elaborate pro-inflammatory cytokines, and perpetuate adipose tissue IR in obesity. Recent reports have established depot-specific pro-inflammatory cytokine expression profiles in equine adipose tissue, but the relationship of this expression to macrophage infiltration is unknown. This study quantified the macrophage content of several AT depots of insulin-resistant (IR) and insulin-sensitive (IS) horses. Eleven mares (8 Quarter horses, 2 Thoroughbreds, and 1 Standardbred), categorized as IR (insulin sensitivity [SI] 5 0.58 AE 0.31 L \u00c1 min \u00c01 \u00c1 mU \u00c01 ; n 5 5) or IS (SI 5 2.59 AE 1.21 L \u00c1 min \u00c01 \u00c1 mU \u00c01 ; n 5 6) based on results of an insulin-modified frequently-sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test were studied. Omental, retroperitoneal, and mesocolonic AT was collected via ventral midline celiotomy; nuchal ligament and tail head AT biopsies were collected via skin incision. Tissue samples were snap-frozen and fixed in formalin. For each depot, total RNA was extracted and cDNA analyzed via real-time quantitative PCR to quantify expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-2 (MCP-2), and tissue samples were immunohistochemically stained for CD163 (macrophage surface antigen). The number of CD163 (1) cells in n 5 10 40\u00c2 fields per slide was recorded for each depot. Data were analyzed using oneway ANOVA for repeated measures or non-parametric equivalent (p 5 0.05). The expression of MCP-2 was significantly higher in omental AT compared with other depots (p 5 0.0003), and omental AT of IR horses showed greater expression than that of IS horses (p o 0.0001). The total number of CD163 (1) cells was not significantly different between depots (p 5 0.06), and no effect of insulin sensitivity was observed. CD163 (1) cells were further differentiated based on their location within the tissue (interstitial vs. perivascular). There was no difference in the number of interstitial cells between depots (p 5 0.48); however, omental adipose tissue contained a significantly greater number of perivascular cells than other depots (p 5 0.04). These data suggest a role for MCP-2 as a macrophage chemoattractant in equine AT; omental AT may have a more dynamic macrophage population than other depots. Importantly, CD163 (1) macrophages may not be the most numerous or important population in equine AT, as increased depot-specific expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (nuchal ligament) is not accompanied by an increased number of CD163 (1) cells. Polyuria and polydipsia (PU-PD) is one of the clinical signs reported with pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID). The cause(s) of PU-PD are not well understood but may include osmotic diuresis consequent to glucosuria, a decrease in antidiuretic hormone release (acquired central diabetes insipidus), or direct effects of cortisol on glomerular filtration rate. The aims of this study were: 1. to determine prevalence of PU-PD based on a owner reported assessment score (n 5 25); 2. to measure urine concentration and perform reagent strip urinalysis (n 5 20); and 3. to examine for bacteriuria (n 5 22) in a group of 25 aged mares (17-24 years) being screened for PPID by clinical examination and an overnight dexamethasone suppression test (DST).

Two of the 19 PPID-affected mares had bacteruria (50-100,000 CFU/ml group D non-enterococcus Streptococcus spp. in one mare and o 100 CFU/ ml Streptococcus equi subspecies equi and 100-500 CFU/ml Corynebacterium spp. in another mare). One of the six non-PPID mares also had bacteriuria (10-50,000 CFU/ml Enterococcus spp.). Although not assessed in a quantitative manner, it is noteworthy that more than 50% of owners of PPID-affected horses reported mild to severe PU-PD despite most horses having measures of urine concentration that would be considered within reference ranges. We have previously reported a seasonal increase in adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) concentrations in horses located in Tennessee, with higher concentrations detected in September and October. However, it was not known whether these findings were specific to this geographical location. We therefore studied a group of horses located in Texas to test the hypothesis that the same seasonal alterations in ACTH concentrations occur in two different geographical locations. Fifteen horses (9 mares, 4 geldings, and 2 stallions) with a median (range) age of 15 (4-38) years were included in the study. Appaloosa (n 5 1), Arabian (7), Quarter horse (5), and Tennessee Walking Horse (1) breeds were represented and one horse was a crossbred. Horses were sampled under fed (hay or grass) conditions approximately every month across a 12-month period (September 2007 to August 2008 .

Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) occurs frequently in critically ill human patients, and is associated with increased mortality in patients with sepsis and septic shock. CIRCI is caused by dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA).

The elevated hormone concentrations are expected in critically ill foals. However, cortisol concentrations at admission were significantly greater than at other times in all foals. How this temporal change affects the HPA axis is unclear, but this change did not impact survival in this study population. Hydrocortisone replacement therapy improves outcome in septic people with critical illness-related cortisol insufficiency (CIRCI), and may also benefit septic foals with CIRCI. However, calculation of an appropriate hydrocortisone replacement dose requires understanding of both endogenous and exogenous cortisol metabolism, which are poorly understood in foals. This study was designed to compare daily endogenous cortisol production and the pharmacokinetics of an intravenous bolus dose of hydrocortisone between neonatal foals and adult horses. Two milliliters of blood were collected every 15-20 minutes for 24 hours from 4 healthy 2-day-old foals and 4 healthy adult horses for determination of serum cortisol concentrations. Then, 1 mg/kg of hydrocortisone was given intravenously to the same 4 foals and to 4 additional healthy horses 12 hours after suppression of endogenous cortisol production with dexamethasone (0.08 mg/kg IV). Cortisol and hydrocortisone concentrations were determined using a previously validated chemiluminescent immunoassay. Data were compared between groups with Mann Whitney tests, with significance set at P o 0.05. Mean 24-hour cortisol concentration was significantly lower in foals (2.0 AE 0.4 mg/dl) than horses (2.6 AE 0.6 mg/dl), but daily cortisol production rate was significantly greater in foals (0.671 AE 0.032 mg/kg/day) than horses (0.215 AE 0.040 mg/kg/day). Foals had significantly greater hydrocortisone volume of distribution and clearance and significantly lower peak hydrocortisone plasma concentrations (Vd ss 5 1.92 AE 1.11 L/kg; Cl s 5 1.39 AE 0.11 L/kg/hr; peak 5 85.5 AE 11.8 mg/dL) than horses (Vd ss 5 0.58 AE 0.15 L/kg; Cl s 5 0.35 AE 0.07 L/kg/hr; peak 5 846.7 AE 378.0 mg/dL). These considerable differences in cortisol metabolism between horses and foals may contribute to the development of CIRCI in septic neonatal foals, and should be considered during hydrocortisone replacement therapy in foals. Sepsis is the number one cause of foal mortality. We have shown that endocrine disorders are frequent in septic foals and often associated with mortality. Thyroid hormones (TH) are important in growth and development (neural, musculoskeletal), maturation (lung, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular), and metabolism (energy, thermogenesis). Decreased TH concentrations in newborn foals are associated with musculoskeletal abnormalities, incoordination, weakness, respiratory distress, hypothermia, failure of transfer of passive immunity, and likely sepsis.",

However, transmission of reactivated virus to sentinel horses was unsuccessful. Failure to effectively transmit EHV-1 to susceptible sentinel horses may have resulted from the low level and short period of viral shedding in latently infected horses. Echocardiography is a non-invasive diagnostic technique that can provide valuable information in foals such as the identification of congenital cardiac abnormalities and infectious conditions such as endocarditis or pericarditis. It also provides a considerable amount of functional and morphological information in critically ill foals. Sequential examinations can be used to assess pathological alteration of cardiac dimensions and function in response to the presence of cardiac disease. Reference values for many of the conventional echocardiographic variables of adult horses have not been established in healthy Thoroughbred foals. In order to detect changes in the structure and function of the heart produced by disease, it is important to determine accurately the effect of normal growth and development on echocardiographic variables. The aims of this study were (1) to obtain measurements for a series of routinely used echocardiographic variables in foals at increasing age intervals to establish reference values for the breed, and (2) to establish the correlation between age and the measured echocardiographic variables in healthy Thoroughbred foals.",

Reference values were determined for 12 routinely used 2-D and M-mode echocardiographic variables in the 19 healthy Thoroughbred foals at increasing age intervals. Although there was a trend for each of the echocardiographic variables to increase with increasing age (P o 0.001); only the 2-D measurement of aortic diameter (r 2 5 0.89; p o 0.001) and the 2-D measurement of left atrial diameter (r 2 5 0.80; p o 0.001) showed a strong linear relationship with age during the study period. The data from this study provides reference echocardiographic variables that may assist in the interpretation of the results of echocardiographic examinations of Thoroughbred foals of similar ages with suspected congenital or acquired cardiac disease. Disturbances of lipid metabolism that result in the accumulation of triglycerides in blood are suspected to occur in several disease processes of the critically ill neonatal foal (e.g. sepsis, prematurity and perinatal asphyxia syndrome). Hypertriglyceridemia has been reported in foals receiving lipid-containing total parenteral nutrition solutions and was recently associated with non-survival (Meyers et al. 2009 ). The aims of this prospective study were to compare serum TG concentrations in critically ill foals at admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) with age-matched healthy foals and to investigate the association of serum TG concentrations with historical information, clinical and diagnostic findings, severity of illness and survival.",

Oxidative stress, occurring secondary to elaboration of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species by activated leukocytes, has been shown to play an important role in initiation and perpetuation of multiple organ dysfunction and failure in the setting of sepsis in multiple species. In the septic horse, the laminae are the most frequent tissue undergoing injury, and evidence of oxidative stress has been reported in an experimental black walnut extract (BWE) laminitis model. Laminitis induced with soluble carbohydrate (CHO) may be more similar to clinical disease than the BWE model due to the fact that CHO-induced animals more commonly proceed to laminar failure. However, the role of oxidative stress in the CHO model has not been reported. Banked laminar tissue collected at various time points from animals subjected to BWE and CHO protocols were used in this study. State-of-the-art immunohistochemistry (IHC) for 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT; marker of nitrosative stress) was optimized using the Ventana Ultraview Universal TM system with Fast Red as the chromogen on paraffin-embedded laminar sections from CHO horses (control, n 5 8; developmental, n 5 6; Obel grade 1 [OG1], n 5 6) in order to identify and quantify the cell types positive for 3-NT. BWE laminar sections were stained as a positive control (control, developmental, and late time points; n 5 1). Very few 3-NT-positive cells were visualized in any of the samples from the CHO model compared to the large number of cells observed in the BWE model; within the CHO samples, significantly fewer positive cells were noted in OG1 samples than controls (p 5 0.04). Positive cells in the CHO model were predominantly interstitial leukocytes and endothelial cells and were limited to the laminar dermis (in contrast to the BWE model, where prominent laminar epithelial signal is present by OG1 lameness). To quantitatively assess laminar 3-NT concentrations, a commercially-available competitive chemiluminescent plate ELISA (Millipore; Temecula, CA) was used to assess total protein extracts of pulverized BWE and CHO laminar samples. No significant difference in 3-NT concentration was observed between control (n 5 8), developmental (n 5 6), and OG1 (n 5 6) samples from CHO horses. The concentration of 3-NT in BWE samples was significantly higher at the 1.5 h time point (n 5 5) than at the 0 h (control, n 5 5), 3 h (n 5 4), or OG1 (n 5 5) time points (p 5 0.028). In keeping with previous reports, these data do not support the hypothesis that nitrosative oxidative stress plays a prominent pathophysiologic role in CHO-overload laminitis and only support a transient nitrosative stress in the BWE model of laminitis. Thus, nitrosative stress (and, possibly general oxidative stress) does not appear to be the central event leading to laminar injury and failure in the CHO model of laminitis. The purpose of the study is to evaluate an in vitro model of insulin resistance which is a cause of laminitis in horses. Digital palmar vessel segments were collected from clinically healthy horses immediately after euthanasia. Four arterial and four venous rings (3 mm wide) were prepared from each horse. Each ring was mounted in a tissue bath containing Tyrode's solution at 371C by fixing one side of the ring to the floor of the bath and the other end to a force transducer interfaced with a polygraph. One ring of each vessel type was used as a control. Each of the remaining 3 rings of each vessel type was incubated for 30 min with insulin (to induce resistance), Wortmannin (PI3 kinase blocker), and PD 098059 (MAP kinase blocker), respectively. The rings were given 2 g initial tension and allowed to equilibrate for 45 min.The bath solution was gently replaced at every 15 min, drugs were added and the ring tension was readjusted to 2 g except at the final wash. After the incubation period, the rings were contracted with phenylephrine. When the contractile response reached a plateau, a single dose of insulin was added to the bath and the response of each ring was monitored for thirty min. Insulin relaxed the control rings and those treated with PD 098059 but contracted the rings pretreated with insulin and Wortmannin. The present study demonstrated successful induction of insulin resistance in arterial rings. However, the responses of venous rings were inconsistent and unreliable. The study suggests that the induction of insulin resistance in equine digital arterial rings is reliable and gives a good in vitro model for studying insulin resistance in laminitis. The study also suggests that MAP kinase may be involved in the pathology of vessels in insulin resistance.",

Increased expression of Th2 cytokines after cold air exercise (previously demonstrated in this model), may have some functional relationship with the downregulation of phagocytic capacity of neutrophils. Leukocyte function assays more specific to viral pathogen resistance may be needed to determine whether there is increased susceptibility to viral pathogens as a result of cold air exercise. Horses that are critically ill often require urgent fluid therapy to correct hypotension, hypovolemia, and volume depletion. Hypertonic sodium solution (7.2% NaCl; HSS) and 6% hetastarch (HET) are two fluids solutions used to assist in these conditions. HSS increases blood volume and pressure and HET increases plasma oncotic pressure to reduce capillary leakage/fluid loss. Although the principles of fluid resuscitation relate to volume expansion, from a physiological standpoint it is likely that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA), which modulates vasomotor tone, blood pressure and inflammation is involved. Upon HPAA stimulation, the hypothalamus secretes vasopressin (AVP) and corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), the pituitary releases adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), which in turn stimulates the adrenal gland cortex to release cortisol and aldosterone.",

Nonglandular (NG) tissue bioelectric properties were measured in an Ussing Chamber system while exposed to normal Ringers solution (NRS, control), a VFA mixture containing VFA concentrations found 2 hours after feeding a sweet feed diet (0.5 Kg/Kg BW) (VFA Mixture-AF) and a VFA mixture containing high acetic (40 mM) (VFA Mixture-HAc), in NRS, at pH 1.5, 4, or 7. After NRS or VFA exposure, tissues were removed from the Ussings Chamber system and divided into half. Half of the tissue was examined under light microscopy for swell swelling and half the tissue was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for determination of mRNAexpression the b1 subunit of NAKA gene using real-time PCR. NG mucosa exposed to NRS (pH 4.0 and 1.5) showed immediate significant decrease in PD, followed by a decrease in Isc and R. NG mucosa, when exposed to the VFA mixture-AF, showed a decrease in PD and Isc, similar to tissue exposed to NRS at the same pH. However, NG mucosa exposed to VFA mixture-HAc showed an immediate decrease in PD and Isc. Nonglandular cell swelling was noted in tissues exposed to the VFA mixture-AF. When the tissues were all grouped together there was no difference in relative expression of mRNA for NAKA, however, when horses were divided by age group, for horses o 5 years of age (n 5 5) relative expression of mRNA for NAKA was significantly decreased in tissues exposed to the VFA mixtures, whereas, for horses 4 12 years of age (n 5 5) relative expression of mRNA for NAKA was significantly increased compared to controls. Results suggest that VFAs present in gastric juice from excessive grain feeding, at pH 4.0, result in changes in barrier function and that this barrier function may be related to alternations in NAKA and may be age-dependent. This may account for the increased prevalence of nonglandular ulcer disease in younger horses. In the human with endotoxemia/sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) occurs, leading to injury and dysfunction/ failure of several organs including most commonly the liver, lungs, kidney, and intestinal tract. Sepsis in the adult horse, the most common cause being gastrointestinal diseases such as enterocolitis or colon torsions, most commonly leads to injury of the digital laminae in the form of laminitis. Renal dysfunction/failure can occur in some cases (especially with enterocolitis) and mild liver dysfunction may be noted, but it is much less common to have pulmonary dysfunction/ failure. A similar SIRS has been reported in the black walnut extract (BWE) model of laminitis evidence by leucopenia, leukocyte migration into the tissues and increased inflammatory gene expression in the lung and liver. Interestingly, the carbohydrate overload (CHO) laminitis model, a model that more closely reflects the severity of laminar injury observed in clinical sepsis-related laminitis cases, does not have the same SIRS-like events (i.e. no leucopenia) as the BWE model. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine inflam-matory signaling events in hepatic, pulmonary, and renal tissue in the CHO laminitis model. Archived snap frozen samples were used from eighteen horses administered either water (CON group, n 5 6, euthanized 24 h after water administration) or 17.6 g of starch/kg body weight via nasogastric tube. Horses administered starch were euthanized after a two degree increase in rectal temperature (DEV group, n 5 6) or at the onset of Obel grade 1 lameness (OG1 group, n 5 6). Real time-quantitative PCR for IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNFa, COX-1 and COX-2 was performed (see Table 1 ). Interestingly, although the kidney is the most likely to be injured of the three organs in equine sepsis, the liver underwent the greatest inflammatory signaling, most likely reflecting function of this organ in processing toxins from the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, increases in inflammatory gene expression of the organs were less than previously reported for the primary ''target tissue'' in the septic horse, the lamina. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is detected in the blood of horses after experimental alimentary carbohydrate overload and may contribute to the development of laminitis by inducing systemic inflammation. Models for endotoxemia have focused upon single bolus infusions of LPS in the past, but clinical endotoxemia has a greater magnitude and duration. The objective of this preliminary study was therefore to assess two models of prolonged (48 h) endotoxemia.",

Activin A has not previously been measured in the horse, and plasma concentrations of activin A were significantly increased in gastrointestinal disease, where this protein may play a role in inflammation and endotoxemia, as in other species. This protein may be a useful biomarker for evaluating novel therapies for endotoxemia. Previous reports of thromboelastography or thromboelastometry (TE) have employed recalcification to assess coagulation in citrated equine whole blood. The objective of this study was to determine whether equine citrated whole blood undergoes changes prior to initiation of TE via recalcification which impact the results obtained with TE. Whole blood was collected by atraumatic venipuncture from 11 normal horses into siliconized glass tubes containing 3.2% citrate (9:1 blood/citrate) and held at 371C for variable times prior to initiation of TE. TE parameters evaluated were clot time (CT), clot formation time (CFT), alpha angle (a), and maximum clot firmness (MCF).",

Pathological changes in osteoarthritic joints include excess production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE 2 ). This inflammatory mediator upregulates metalloproteinases (MMPs) that degrade cartilage as well as suppresses aggrecan synthesis and total proteoglycan accumulation. It also contributes to the development of pain in OA. The compounds pentosan polysulfate (PPS) and glucosamine in the form of glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine chloride or N-acetyl glucosamine (NG) have been used for the management of equine OA. These compounds have been documented to promote chondrocyte anabolic activity and are considered disease modifying. However, their anti-inflammatory activity is less understood. To address this question, we tested whether these compounds can inhibit the inflammatory response using an equine chondrocyte culture model. We also determined whether the PPS-NG mixture when combined with an avocado soybean unsaponifiables (ASU), glucosamine (GLU), and chondroitin sulfate (CS) mixture would exert a more potent anti-inflammatory effect. ASU, GLU, and CS individually have been shown to provide chondroprotective effects in vivo and in vitro.",

Similarly, the ASU 1 GLU 1 CS mixture elicited a significant decrease in PGE 2 production (p o 0.001). Combining the PPS 1 NG mixture with the ASU 1 GLU 1 CS significantly potentiated the inhibitory effect on cytokine-induced PGE 2 production (p o 0.001). Our finding reinforces earlier reports that these compounds exhibit both anti-inflammatory and anabolic activity. Superior antiinflammatory activity may be achieved with the combination of these compounds while minimizing adverse side effects such as life-threatening gastrointestinal complications. The responsiveness of chondrocytes to this combination supports their potential utility for the management of joint inflammation in horses and other species. ( Hepcidin has been found to be the key regulator of iron metabolism. Hepcidin up-regulation causes hypoferremia during systemic inflammatory disorders in some species. Recent work has shown that equine hepcidin is predominantly expressed in the horse's liver. In this study, hepcidin gene expression was determined in liver and bone marrow of healthy horses following intramuscular administration of Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA).",

The peak velocity of mitral A wave (m/s) (CG: 0.53 AE 0.10; CKDG: 0.41 AE 0.13; p 5 0.0153) was lower in the CDKG, resulting in increased E/A wave ratio (CG: 1.19 AE 0.22; CKDG: 1.60 AE 0.27; p 5 0.0003).

The means and standard deviations of QRSd, LAS o 40mv and RMS 40 were, respectively, 76.09AE5.75; 19.91AE4.67; 343.0AE171.4 (group 1), 77.75AE7.46; 23.9AE4.91; 245.6AE232.3 (group 2) and 91.07AE12.84; 29.79AE10.13; 130.3AE90.42 (group 3). Statistical analysis was performed by Dunnett's multiple comparison test that identified significant differences (P o 0.05) in all parameters between groups 1 and 3, and only in RMS 40 between groups 1 and 2. These results allow concluding that SAECG is a helpful test to detect LP in Boxers with DCM, but not in all dogs with ARVC.

            "text": "Insulin resistance (IR) is associated with obesity and laminitis in equids, so diagnostic tests are required to identify affected animals. An intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) can be used to diagnose IR, but oral tests are easier to perform and may be more applicable to field conditions. Dextrose powder can be used for this purpose, but requires mixing into solution and administration via nasogastric tube. We therefore selected Karo Original Light Corn Syrup (10g sugar/30 mL syrup) for this study because of its availability and palatability. We tested the hypothesis that an oral sugar test (OST) can be used to diagnose IR in horses. Ten horses with IR and 8 healthy horses were included in the study and each animal underwent an IVGTT (50 mg/kg dextrose) and OST (50 mg/kg sugar; 15 mL per 100 kg) under fasting conditions on consecutive days in random order. Dextrose was administered intravenously as a 50% solution and syrup was administered via dose syringe. Blood samples were collected at 15 min intervals for 60 min during the IV-GTT and every 30 min for 120 min during the OST.Mean area under the curve values from the IVGTT and OST were 27% and 28% higher respectively for glucose, and 10-fold and 6-fold higher respectively for insulin when insulin-resistant horses were compared with healthy control animals. Insulin-resistant horses were identified with the OST, so this test may be used by collecting a single blood sample 60 to 90 minutes after syrup is administered by the owner. Obesity, regional adiposity, insulin resistance (IR), and laminitis are components of Equine Metabolic Syndrome (EMS). Previous work has shown that levothyroxine sodium induces weight loss and improves insulin sensitivity in healthy horses kept on a weight reduction diet. The purpose of this study was therefore to assess the efficacy of this treatment in horses with EMS kept on a maintenance diet. It was hypothesized that levothyroxine sodium would significantly alter physical characteristics, glucose dynamics, and markers of metabolic status in horses with EMS. Ten horses with obesity, IR, and a history of laminitis were evaluated over a 9-month period. Seven horses received levothyroxine sodium (Thyro L) orally at a dosage of 48 mg/ day (6 months) and then 72 mg/day (3 months) once daily in 0.25 kg oats, while 3 other horses received oats alone. Body weights, morphometric measurements, and frequently-sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed at 0, 3, 6, and 9 months.Analysis of variance analysis revealed significant time \u00c2 treatment effects for within-horse change in body weight (P 5 0.049) and mean neck circumference (P 5 0.027), but no significant change in BCS (P 5 0.350). Mean body weight decreased by 30.8 AE 14.0 kg over 9 months in treated horses and by 6.5 AE 24.6 kg in the three control animals. Treatment did not affect area under the glucose curve values (time \u00c2 treatment; P 5 0.511). Insulin results are pending. Levothyroxine induces weight loss and reduces neck circumference in horses with EMS, even when animals are kept on a weight maintenance diet. Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone secreted by the small intestine that plays a role in satiety and stimulates insulin release from pancreatic b-cells. The objective of this study was to validate a commercially available (Millipore Corporation) human active GLP-1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for use with equine plasma. Resting blood samples were collected from one insulin-resistant horse and one healthy horse. Plasma was collected with EDTA and treated with dipeptidyl-peptidase IV inhibitor. Dilution, linearity, and lowest limit of detection were assessed using sample buffer included in the kit and plasma from the insulin-resistant horse. For spike and recovery, the high standard was diluted in equine plasma from one healthy horse. Intra-assay variability was calculated from quadruplicate measures of GLP-1 in blood collected at 3 time points during oral sugar tests in 3 healthy horses. Inter-assay variability was assessed from concentrations of quality control solutions provided in the kit on 3 plates.Dilution of equine plasma resulted in a linear plot of GLP-1 concentrations (r 2 5 0.995). The lowest limit of detection for the assay was 1.7 pmol/L because this was the value obtained for the sample buffer. Overall recovery was 98.3% for active GLP-1 in equine plasma. Inter-assay coefficient of variation (CV%) values of 2.3% and 2.6% were obtained for two the quality control solutions. Mean AE SD intra-assay CV% was 9.5 AE 5.1%. Results indicate that GLP-1 can be measured in equine plasma using the ELISA evaluated in this study. Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone secreted by the small intestine in response to feeding. Studies in other species indicate that obesity and insulin resistance are associated with alterations in GLP-1 concentrations after feeding. An enzymelinked immunosorbent assay for human active GLP-1 has recently been validated for use with equine plasma in our laboratory. We therefore tested the hypothesis that healthy and insulin-resistant horses differ in their GLP-1 response to an oral sugar test (OST). Eleven healthy horses and six insulin-resistant horses underwent an OST after overnight fasting. After baseline blood samples were collected, 50 mg sugar per kg body weight was administered as Karo Original Light Corn Syrup (10 g sugar/30 mL syrup) via dose syringe. Blood samples were then collected at 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, and 120 min. Active GLP-1 was measured in EDTA plasma treated with dipeptidyl-peptidase IV inhibitor.Mean GLP-1 concentrations significantly increased (P o 0.001) during the OST, but individual responses varied widely. Median (range) maximum percent increase in GLP-1 concentration after syrup administration was 67% (-15% to 188%) in healthy horses and 148% (35% to 286%) in insulin-resistant horses. Metabolic status did not affect GLP-1 concentrations (P 5 0.623), percent change (P 5 0.167), fold change (P 5 0.161), or area under the curve in response to sugar administration. Healthy and insulin-resistant horses did not differ with respect to GLP-1 responses to Karo syrup in this study, but specific nutrients should be tested in the future. Lipid storage myopathies (LSMs) are common causes of rhabdomyolysis and weakness in humans and are characterized by accumulation of lipid droplets predominantly in high oxidative muscle fibers. The normal range of lipid storage in muscle biopsies from horses is not well characterized and excessive myofiber lipid storage has only been reported in a small number of horses. The firstThe concentration of lactate [LAC] in the blood of sick equine neonates at admission ([LAC] ADMIT ) and other time points is associated with survival in several retrospective studies, with larger [LAC] associated with non-survival. We hypothesized that this association would remain when examined prospectively.Thirteen university and private equine referral hospitals on 3 continents enrolled 643 foals over the 2008 foaling season of both hemispheres. Signalment, historical, clinical and clincopathologic data were entered into a standardized spreadsheet by a single veterinarian at each institution. Spreadsheets were unified into a single data set for analysis. Not all data were available for all foals. Data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis and regression analysis, P 0.05.There were more colts (N 5 354) than fillies (N 5 277) enrolled; there was no difference in [LAC] ADMIT by sex. Neither gestational age nor age at admission were significantly different between survivors and non-survivors. Median [LAC] ADMIT was significantly larger in non-survivors (N 5 120, 5.79 mmol/L, P o 0.001) compared to survivors (N 5 466, 3.55 mmol/L). The difference in [LAC] between groups remained statistically significant through 120 hrs post-admission.[LAC] ADMIT was significantly greater in foals born following premature placental separation (P o 0.001) and those with a history of dystocia or Caesarian section delivery (P o 0.001). Mean arterial pressure had a small (R 2 5 19.1%) but significant (P o 0.001) association with [LAC] ADMIT . [LAC] ADMIT was not significantly different in blood culture positive vs negative foals.This large prospective study supports the findings of several smaller retrospective studies regarding the utility of initial and repeated [LAC] measurement in the management of sick foals. and Na 1 were unchanged.

Other blood gas parameters may be altered with PEI and should be considered when evaluating horses receiving PEI. Clearance of exogenous sodium lactate can be used as a prognostic indicator in sick humans. Sick horses frequently have blood gas (BG) and electrolyte abnormalities. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of sodium lactate infusion (NLI) on BG and electrolyte parameters, should this test prove useful in horses.Venous blood samples from 6 normal horses were collected into heparinized syringes for BG analysis via a catheter in the right jugular vein prior to NLI at 1 mmol/kg over 15 minutes. BG was repeated 0, 30 and 120 min after NLI completion. Statistical comparisons were by Friedman analysis p 0.05. pH, PCO 2 , PO 2 , Cl \u00c0 and glucose were unchanged.

The physiochemical acid-base approach identifies PCO 2 , weak acid buffers (A TOT ) and SID -which includes Na 1 and lactate-as independent determinants of pH. It is possible the infusion of lactate and Na 1 was balanced by smaller changes in other acid-base determinants. Hypokalemia, hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia may potentially be worsened with NLI and should be monitored when considering NLI. There is general consensus that EHV-1 viremia is a pre-requisite for Equine Herpesvirus-associated Myelopathy (EHM) in horses. We hypothesized that the rate of central nervous system (CNS) endothelial cell (EC) infection is key to the development of EHM. Further, CNS-EC infection occurs after cell-cell contact between virus-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and the CNS-EC.. . . To study potential cell-to-cell infections we used monolayers of CNS-EC and EHV-1 (Ohio 03)-infected PBMC from 9 horses. For each horse, experiments were conducted in quadruplicate, and duplicate wells were co-cultured either with or without EHV-1 neutralizing antibodies (VN antibodies). EC-monolayers and in vitro infected PBMC in culture wells were placed on a laboratory rocker in an incubator (5% CO2; 371C) for 4 hours (phase 1), allowing PBMC to roll over the EC monolayer. Then, the monolayer was thoroughly washed to remove all (non-adhered) PBMC; then incubated for another 72 hours with all wells now containing VN antibodies (phase 2). Viral cytopathic effect (CPE) was quantified by plaque count. The amount of added VN antibodies was pre-determined in an experiment where EHV-1 -infected PBMC were placed in the medium of CNS-EC monolayers but without contact, and no CPE was Previous studies have shown that treatment of neonatal foals with inactivated parapox ovis virus (IPOV) enhances phagocytic cell activity against ex vivo infection with Rhodococcus equi. The objectives of the present study were to determine if administration of IPOV can decrease the incidence of pneumonia and increase the frequency of IFN-gamma and IL-4 secreting cells.",

At 24-48 h of age, foals received 2 mL of either IPOV or a placebo by IM injection. Injections were repeated 24 h and 8 days later. The frequency of IFN-gamma and IL-4 secreting cells was measured using a validated ELISPOT assay on blood mononuclear cells collected when the foals were between 2 and 14 days of age. Foals were monitored daily for clinical signs of pneumonia and biweekly for lung lesions by ultrasonography.The proportion of foals that developed clinical or ultrasonographic evidence of pneumonia was not significantly different between IPOV (16 of 28) and placebo (14 of 31). IFN-gamma and IL-4 secreting cells were detected in only 21 and 15 foals, respectively. There was no significant effect of treatment with IPOV on the frequency of IFN-gamma and IL-4 secreting cells. There was no significant association between IFN-gamma or IL-4 secretion early in life and subsequent development of pneumonia. The odds of detecting IFN-gamma (5.1; 95% CI: 1.5-15) and IL-4 (3.5; 95% CI: 1.1-12) were significantly higher in foals 4 7 days than in younger foals. In horses, Equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) typically causes mild respiratory disease, but is also associated with late term abortion, neonatal foal death, and neurologic disease or Equine Herpes Myeloencephalopathy (EHM). Recently, EHM has been described as a ''potentially emerging disease'' by the USDA. The absence of information regarding shedding in horses with naturally occurring disease, and the knowledge that latent carriage complicates management of this disease, makes development of objective quarantine recommendations for those managing outbreaks of this disease very difficult. In fact, there is little consensus for quarantine recommendations or for the release of an imposed quarantine. The American Association of Equine Practitioners currently recommends a 28-day quarantine since the last suspected infection. The objectives of this report were to describe an outbreak of EHM in western Canada during the spring of 2008 and to evaluate the duration of nasal shedding of EHV-1 in horses affected with EHM during this outbreak.",

            "text": "This outbreak involved horses from three different facilities (a boarding facility, a private farm, and a large animal referral hospital) linked by a common exposure, a riding clinic. In total, 111 horses were naturally exposed to EHV-1 with 21 developing clinical signs of EHM. Nasal swabs were collected daily from 16 of the 21 horses demonstrating clinical signs of EHM. Samples were evaluated via a previously reported quantitative polymerase chain reaction technique specific for the gene sequence of glycoprotein B of EHV-1. Of the horses tested, the last day EHV-1 nasal shedding was detected in any horse was Disease Day 9 with 6 of 13 shedding until Disease Day 6. EHV-1 was detected in nasal secretions of 43.8% of horses tested on Disease Days 0 to 3. There was high variability with significant nasal shedding and severity of neurologic signs.Based on the findings of this study, in the absence of laboratory testing of animals, we recommend biosecurity measures be utilized when managing EHM cases a minimum of 9 days beyond the onset of clinical signs. EHV-1 nasal shedding does not appear to be highly correlated with the severity of clinical signs. In addition, this report illustrates the potential for EHV-1 to spread between farms and within a large animal referral hospital reinforcing the need for biosecurity measures to be a normal part of daily operations at equine boarding and medical facilities. Small interfering (si) RNAs targeted against essential genes of EHV-1 glycoprotein B (sigB3) and origin binding protein (siOri2) reduce EHV-1 replication in vitro and in mice. An EHV-1 challenge infection showed a decrease in severity of neurological symptoms in horses treated with sigB3/ori2 12-h before and 12-h after EHV-1 infection but no difference in the nasal viral load or viremia. We tested whether metaphylactic treatment with EHV-1-specific siRNAs at a higher dose and frequency would reduce viral load and clinical symptoms in EHV-1-infected horses.Horses were infected intranasally (IN) with 1\u00c2 10 7 PFU of EHV-1 virus strain Ab4 (day 0). Seven horses were given 5-nmols each of sigB3 and siOri2 IN 24-h pre-and 12, 24, 36 and 48-h post-EHV-1 infection. The other 6 horses were given 10-nmols of an irrelevant siRNA against firefly luciferase (siLuc). Horses were monitored daily and blood and nasal swabs taken on days -1, 1 to 10, 12, 14 and 21 post-infection (p.i.) for virus isolation and qPCR. Wilcoxon's rank-sum tests were performed.All horses developed serous nasal discharge and a biphasic fever p.i. Three sigB3/Ori2 and 2 siLuc horses had neurologic signs beginning day 6 p.i. There was no significant difference between groups in clinical signs, nasal viral shedding or viremia.The sigB3/siOri2 regimen did not protect horses against EHV-1 experimental infection. Although many studies have been performed to classify epileptic seizures (ES) in humans and small animals, no similar epidemiologic study is available in horses. Therefore, the objectives of this study was to classify ES in horses (all ages except neonates) presented for seizure disorders at The OSU Equine Veterinary Teaching Hospital between 1988 and 2009, following small animal classification and the current guidelines of the International League Against Epilepsy.",

            "text": "ES were classified by type and etiology, based on history, clinical observations, diagnostic investigations (e.g., electroencephalograms, CSF and computed tomography imaging of the head) and postmortem examinations (when available) in 104 horses.Regarding their type, ES were defined as primary generalized in 22% of horses, secondary generalized in 24% of cases, simple and complex partial in 43% of cases, and unclassified in 11% of cases. Regarding their etiology, symptomatic ES, with underlying structural brain lesions (including brain tumor, abscess, traumatic or infectious meningoencephalitis), were identified in 41 horses and suspected in 48 horses. In contrast, reactive ES were only reported in 2 cases. Epilepsy (i.e., recurrence of ! 2 ES) was identified in 72 cases, and further classified as symptomatic (24 cases), cryptogenic (i.e., probably symptomatic, 42 cases), idiopathic (i.e., suspected genetic predisposition, 1 foal) or unknown in 5 cases.The control group showed no evidence of sero-conversion to any antigen, indicating no natural exposure to any antigen studied. Significant differences between vaccination groups and controls were identified for each antigen, except EHV-4, to which no vaccination response was detected. However, responses were frequently significantly different between vaccination groups, and in the case of tetanus, EHV-4, EEE & WEE, one or more vaccination groups were not different from controls.This study demonstrates that on the basis of serological response to vaccination, there are significant differences amongst commercially available products in North America, and some products did not produce serological evidence of an immune response to vaccination. These results indicate that during the process of vaccine selection, differences in product efficacy predicted by serological response should be considered.ABSTRACT #407 HUMORAL IMMUNE RESPONSES TO A KILLED ADJUV-ANTED VACCINE. DO FOALS RESPOND LIKE ADULT HORSES? C. Ryan 1 , S. Gigue`re 2 . 1 University of Florida, Gainesville, FL. 2 University of Georgia, Athens, GA.The purpose of this study was to compare serum IgM and IgG subclass responses of foals to that of adult horses following admin-istration of a killed adjuvanted vaccine. Eleven 3-day-old foals, fifteen 3-month-old foals, and six adult horses were vaccinated intramuscularly twice at 3 week intervals with a killed adjuvanted vaccine containing antigens from type II bovine viral diarrhea virus, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, parainfluenza-3 virus, and bovine respiratory syncytial virus. A cattle vaccine was chosen to avoid any effects of maternal antibody on immune responses. Serum samples were obtained immediately prior to vaccination and 3 weeks after each vaccination. Antigen-specific serum IgGa, IgGb, IgG(T), and IgM concentrations were measured using a capture ELISA.No adverse reactions to the vaccine were observed. Both groups of foals and adult horses responded to the vaccine with a significant increase in IgGa and IgG(T) concentrations. In contrast, only adult horses and 3-month old foals mounted significant IgGb and IgM responses. Concentrations of IgGb were significantly higher in adult horses than in both groups of foals. Concentrations of IgM and IgG(T) were significantly different between all groups with the highest concentrations in adult horses followed by 3-month-old foals and finally 3-day old foals. Concentrations of IgGa were not significantly different between groups. The results of this study indicate that the humoral immune responses to this killed adjuvanted vaccine are modest in newborn foals. Although humoral immune responses improve with age, 3-month-old foals do not respond with the same magnitude as adult horses.",
