The background data from case reports of HAV is often insufficient to prove foodborne transmission, but occasional outbreaks have been documented.

Recent studies suggest the presence of noroviruses in pigs and cattle, but there is no evidence for direct zoonotic transmission. It should be emphasized that traditional viral zoonosis such as Rhabdovirus, Hanta virus and Influenza A viruses are not considered to be foodborne. Recent outbreaks of avian influenza (AI) have occurred in birds in Europe, in the US in Asia and in Africa. Almost all the reported cases of AI virus infection in humans have been caused by HPAI viruses belonging to the H5 or H7 subtypes and are transmitted directly from infected birds to humans. Other routes of infection, such as consumption of edible tissues from infected avians or contact with contaminated water, have been suggested as possible sources of infection, but have not yet been proven.",

Shellfish are filter feeders and if shellfish-growing waters are polluted with human sewage, the shellfish extract viruses infectious for humans. The difficulties in detecting virus in shellfish pose further problems, as well as the fact that correlation between levels of bacteria indicator organisms and the extent of viral contamination is poor.",

In that opinion it concluded that the conventional faecal indicators are unreliable for demonstrating the presence or absence of NLVs and that the reliance on faecal bacterial indicator removal for determining shellfish purification times is unsafe practice. It also recommended using E. coli rather than faecal coliforms to indicate faecal contamination in shellfish harvesting areas, when applying bacterial indicators.

            "text": "Currently known viruses that can infect humans are grouped into 22 families. In addition to this, the recent advances in molecular techniques that allow characterisation of all genetic material in a given sample has led to the identification of several new viruses in recent years, most of which remain to be fully characterised (Allander et al., 2005; Briese et al., 2009; Jones et al., 2007) . Foodborne transmission has been documented for viruses belonging to at least 10 of these, and the diseases associated with these infections range from mild diarrhoeal illness to severe encephalitis. Foodborne transmission can occur by contamination of food by infected food handlers, by contamination of food during the production process (e.g. in shellfish production), or more seldom by consumption of products of animal origin harbouring a zoonotic virus. While foodborne transmission is possible for multiple viruses, the burden of foodborne illness is thought to be greatest for human viruses that are transmitted through poor hygienic practices, either by food handlers or during food production (Mead et al., 1999) . This applies to viruses that are transmitted by the faecal-oral route, hence infect their host after ingestion, followed by invasion of cells in the epithelial lining of the gut, and subsequent replication in the same site or elsewhere in the body. An expert meeting convened under the auspices of WHO/FAO and OIE 8 reviewed available evidence and grouped viruses according to their ability to cause high morbidity, severe disease, or a significant ability to cause outbreaks. In the WHO/FAO document, the common pathogens noroviruses (NoV), group A rotaviruses, and hepatitis A viruses (HAV) were ranked as priority hazards. In the category of emerging hazards, hepatitis E virus (HEV), Nipah viruses, H5N1 avian influenza viruses and SARS coronavirus were considered to be of greatest concern. Subsequently, available evidence for a specific food-commodity combination was reviewed, by considering available information on estimates of the incidence of foodborne disease linked to a specific commodity, and the level of evidence for the importance of that commodity in causing viral foodborne illness. This resulted in several virus-commodity combinations for which prevention and control measures should be considered:",

Estimates of the proportion of illness caused by these pathogens that can be attributed to consumption of contaminated food are based on very few studies, and would require addition of systematic strain typing to routine surveillance, or more systematic studies to provide the data for burden estimates (similar to the global Salmonella surveillance activities). Finally, testing for viruses in commodities is difficult, and there is considerable debate over interpretation of findings, as will be discussed elsewhere in this report. As a consequence, data from product monitoring are patchy at best.",

However, the currently used methods for monitoring and the use of E. coli as a microbiological criteria do not correlate consistently with presence or absence of viruses. As a consequence, food industry and food safety authorities at present lack the tools that enable them to monitor virological quality control in contrast with the situation for bacteriological contamination (e.g: Salmonella).

            "text": "Information about foodborne outbreaks caused by viruses in the EU can be found in The Community Summary Report 9 . In 2008, 19 MSs reported a total of 697 outbreaks, and for the second year in a row, the total number of outbreaks caused by viruses increased. For those outbreaks that were verified, NoV was the most frequent cause, followed by HAV. Crustaceans, shellfish, molluscs and products thereof were the most frequently implicated food items. In addition to this, approximately 27% of the verified NoV outbreaks the implicated foodstuff was unknown. The use of epidemiological criteria in the US concluded than an estimated 28% of all reported outbreaks with unknown aetiology were likely caused by NoV (Turcios et al., 2006) . The reporting of outbreaks to EFSA was initiated in 2007, and it is likely that the numbers and proportion of reported viral outbreaks will increase as not all countries are providing data on viral outbreaks, in contrast to Salmonella reporting. What the report does not yet provide is insight into the geographic spread of outbreaks. For Salmonella, occasional international diffuse outbreaks are identified, caused by widely disseminated products. Identifying such outbreak required systematic incorporation of molecular typing into outbreak investigations and reporting, a practice that is common for Salmonella but not for viruses. Indications of this can also be obtained when reviewing notifications from countries about possible food-related incidents in which viruses are involved. This is done through the rapid alert system for food and feed (Data extracted from RASFF, are presented in Appendix 2). The recent increase in RASFF notifications for suspected viral contamination is remarkable, possibly reflecting increasing awareness (Figures 1 and 2) . However, RASFF notifications are not representative and are not based on common notification criteria. Incident notifications may follow illness reporting, or detection of a virus in a food product, or both. Therefore these figures have to be interpreted with care. At least a tendency for higher awareness of viral agents is visible. Few studies have looked at the incidence and health impact of NoV infection at the community level. The most extensive data are from the UK Wheeler et al., 1999) and the Netherlands, where a randomised sample of the community participated in cohort studies of infectious intestinal disease (IID). The incidence of community-acquired IID was calculated as 190 per 1000 person years in the UK and 283 per 1000 person years in The Netherlands (de Wit et al., 2001; Tompkins et al., 1999) . Viruses were the most frequently identified causes of community acquired gastroenteritis, with NoV detected in 11% of cases in The Netherlands and 7% in the UK. This difference may partly result from the different methods used for virus detection: The group in the Netherlands used RT-PCR whereas the study in the UK employed the far less sensitive electron microscopy, this was confirmed by the recent retesting of stored stool samples from the study . Smaller studies in selected patient populations have been conducted elsewhere, and show that NoV are known to occur as a prominent cause of illness in countries throughout Europe, the USA, Australia, Hong Kong and Japan (Fankhauser et al., 2002; Fankhauser et al., 1988; Iritani et al., 2003; Lau et al., 2004a; Lopman et al., 2004; Lopman et al., 2003; Marshall et al., 2003) . Additionally, evidence is mounting that the disease may be common in countries with different degrees of development across the world Gallimore et al., 2004a; Girish et al., 2002; Martinez et al., 2002; Parks et al., 1999; Phan et al., 2004; Reuter et al., 2002) . NoV infection is common in all age groups but the incidence is highest in young children (<5 yrs). In recent years, the incidence of norovirus outbreaks has increased with the emergence of a particular variant (Lopman et al., 2004) .",

Since the development of molecular detection methods NoV have emerged as the most important cause of outbreaks of gastroenteritis in institutional settings (i.e. hospitals, nursing homes). The majority of NoV gastroenteritis cases results from direct person-to-person transmission. However, NoV related outbreaks have been shown to be food-or waterborne, caused by for example, contaminated shellfish (Doyle et al., 2004; Kingsley et al., 2002b; Le Guyader et al., 2003) , raspberries (Ponka et al., 1999) or drinking water (Carrique-Mas et al., 2003; Kukkula et al., 1999; Parshionikar et al., 2003) . Additionally, environmental spread of NoV was found, for instance by contaminated carpets in hotels (Cheesbrough et al., 2000) , toilet seats and door handles in a rehabilitation centre (Kuusi et al., 2002) , and contaminated fomites on hard surfaces, carpets and soft furnishings in a concert hall (Evans et al., 2002) .",

            "text": "A challenging question is how much disease caused by noroviruses can be attributed to foodborne spread. It is clear that the major mode of transmission for noroviruses remains person-to-person (de Wit et al., 2003; Fretz et al., 2005; Karsten et al., 2009; Pajan-Lehpaner and Petrak, 2009 ). Due to the high rate of secondary transmissions, small initial foodborne events may rapidly present like personto-person outbreaks, if the initial introduction event was not recognized. In The Netherlands, approximately 12-15% of community cases of NoV gastroenteritis were attributed to foodborne consumption, based on analysis of questionnaire data, and this has been used in later burden of disease estimates. This makes NoV as common a cause of foodborne gastroenteritis as Campylobacter, and a more common cause than Salmonella (de Wit et al., 2003) . In studies of outbreak reports, the term \"foodborne\" has been used loosely and not standardised. In the EFSA/ECDC Community Summary Report, outbreaks were stratified into possible and verified foodborne outbreaks, where epidemiological evidence for a food source, or detection of the pathogen in food is considered as evidence. When applying this, only 17% of reported outbreaks are confirmed. This differs greatly for different pathogens, e.g. 26% of Salmonella outbreaks are confirmed, but only 4 and 5% of Campylobacter and NoV outbreaks, respectively. This may reflect differences in the ability to detect pathogens in food items. A systematic analysis of reported outbreaks of norovirus in a collaborative research project including 13 countries between 2000 and 2007 found evidence for internationally linked diffuse foodborne outbreaks involving approximately 7% of reported outbreaks (total reported 5499). This constitutes a 17.5 fold increase over the previously recognised number, involving 0,4% of outbreaks. The analysis required the availability of both epidemiological and laboratory data, hence limiting it to only 27% of reported outbreaks in this network . Routine harmonised surveillance of viral outbreaks, and surveillance of virus occurrence in food commodities, in combination with systematic strain typing, would be recommended to aid source attribution studies.",

Two thousand three hundred years later, at the beginning of the 20th century, the term \"infectious hepatitis\" was defined and associated to a kind of infectious jaundice occurring in epidemics. In the early 40's two separate entities were identified \"infectious\" and \"serum\" hepatitis, and from 1965 to nowadays the major etiological agents (hepatitis A, B, C, D and E viruses) of viral hepatitis have been identified. While all viral hepatitis are infectious the previously \"infectious\" and \"serum\" terms refer to the mode of transmission. The \"infectious\" type corresponds to those hepatitis transmitted through the faecal-oral route, or enteric hepatitis, and the \"serum\" hepatitis to those parenterally transmitted. The enteric hepatitis includes two types: hepatitis A and E which can be foodborne and waterborne.",

            "text": "The etiological agent of hepatitis A is the hepatitis A virus (HAV) which belongs to genus Hepatovirus within family Picornaviridae, and as such it consists of a non-enveloped icosaedral capsid of around 30 nm in diameter containing a positive ssRNA genomic molecule of 7.5 Kb (Fauquet et al., 2005) . The genome contains a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polyprotein of around 2,225 amino acids preceded by a 5' non-coding-region (5'NCR) that makes around 10% of the total genome, and followed by a much shorter 3'NCR that contains a poly(A) tract (Baroudy et al., 1985; Cohen et al., 1987) . This genome is uncapped but covalently linked to a small viral protein (VPg) (Weitz et al., 1986) . The singly translated polyprotein is subsequently cleaved into 11 proteins through a cascade of proteolytic events brought about mainly by the viral 3C protease (Schultheiss et al., 1995; Schultheiss et al., 1994) . HAV is a unique picornavirus with many differences in its molecular biology including both its incapacity to induce the inhibition of the cellular protein synthesis and a highly biased and deoptimized codon usage with respect to the cell (Aragones et al., 2008; Borman et al., 1997; Jackson, 2002; Sanchez et al., 2003b) . The final goal of this intriguing strategy seems to be the need for a fine-tuning control of the translation kinetics, particularly at the capsid coding region, and the underlying mechanism is the use of a right combination of common and rare codons to allow a regulated ribosome traffic rate thus ensuring the proper protein folding (Aragones et al., 2008; Aragones et al., 2010; Sanchez et al., 2003b) . Capsid folding is critical to warrant a high environmental stability for a virus transmitted through the faecaloral route with long extracorporeal periods.",

In spite of the low antigenic variability of HAV, a certain degree of nucleotide variability, similar to that of other picornavirus, exists and as many RNA viruses HAV occurs as a swarm of mutants termed quasispecies (Domingo et al., 2006; Sanchez et al., 2003a) . HAV genomic diversity allows its differentiation into several genotypes and subgenotypes. Different genomic regions, mainly from the capsid coding region (P1) or the junction between the capsid region (P1) and the contiguous non-structural region (P2), have been used to differentiate the genotypes. Particularly, the carboxi-terminus of the VP3 structural protein, the amino-terminus of the VP1 structural protein, the VP1X2A junction, the region spanning the carboxi-end of VP1 till the amino-terminus of 2B (VP1/P2B), and finally the entire VP1 region (see the review of (Nainan et al., 2006) ). However, partial genomic sequences will never guarantee the reliability of the complete P1/2A region. As a matter of fact the identification of some HAV antigenic variants affecting residues not included in the genotyping regions (Costa-Mattioli et al., 2002; Gabrieli et al., 2004; Sanchez et al., 2002) could have been elusive in such circumstances.",

In this region, seven genotypes were initially defined, whose genetic distance was >15% nucleotide variation. After refining this classification through the addition of more sequences, only six genotypes exist at the present time (Costa-Mattioli et al., 2002; Lu et al., 2004) . Three out of these six genotypes (I, II and III) are of human origin while the others (IV, V and VI) are of simian origin.

Foods of primary importance are those susceptible to be contaminated at the pre-harvest stage such as bivalve molluscs, particularly oysters, clams and mussels, salad crops, as lettuce, green onions and other greens, and soft fruits, such as raspberries and strawberries. All these types of food have been implicated in foodborne HAV outbreaks (CDC, 1997; Halliday et al., 1991; Pinto et al., 2009; Shieh et al., 2007; Wheeler et al., 2005) and should be considered the principal targets for virological analysis.

The endemicity is low in developed regions and high in underdeveloped countries. The epidemiological pattern has important implications on the average age of exposure and hence, as above stated, on the severity of the clinical disease. Since hepatitis A infection induces a life-long immunity (Hollinger and Emerson, 2007) , severe infections among adults are rare in highly endemic regions where most children are infected early in life. In contrast, in low endemic areas the disease occurs mostly in adulthood, mainly as a consequence of travelling to endemic regions, having sexual risky practices or consuming contaminated water or food; and hence the likelihood of developing severe symptomatic or fatal illness is high. An epidemiological shift, from intermediate to low prevalence, has been noticed in recent decades in many countries, particularly in Southern Europe, including Spain, Italy and Greece (Dominguez et al., 2008; Germinario et al., 2000; Van Damme and Van Herck, 2005) .

The genome consists of one single-stranded RNA molecule of positive polarity and about 7 kb in length. The major ORFs are ORF-1, which encodes a non-structural polyprotein, ORF-2 encoding the capsid protein and ORF-3 encoding a phosphoprotein. The HEV strains can be grouped into 4 genotypes, with different geographical distribution and host range. Genotype 1 is endemic in Asia and Africa and genotype 2 is endemic in Mexico and western Africa. Whereas these genotypes have been found exclusively in humans; genotypes 3 and 4 have also been detected in pigs and other animal species. Genotype 3 is distributed worldwide and genotype 4 is restricted to Southeast Asia. Thus the endemic strains found in Europe are usually of genotype 3. In addition to the HEV genotypes 1 to 4, distinct HEV-like viruses with lower sequence identity to the human strains have been detected in chicken and rats.",

Several studies suggest the following food items as risk factors for acquisition of HEV infection: pork pies, liver pate, wild boar, under-cooked or raw pork, home-made sausages, meat (in general), unpasteurized milk, shellfish and ethnic foods [references in (Lewis et al., 2010) ]. However, only very few systematic studies have been performed so far; therefore, nearly none of these risk factors is sufficiently substantiated. One systematic case-control study has been performed in Germany, in which eating of any offal or wild boar meat was identified as risk factor for autochthonous hepatitis E (Wichmann et al., 2008) . In addition, another recent small-scaled casecontrol study identified eating of raw pig liver sausage as a risk factor for hepatitis E in France (Colson et al., 2010) . Previous publications from Japan indicate direct HEV transmission by eating raw or undercooked meat from wild boar or deer by detailed analysis of small outbreaks (Li et al., 2005; Tei et al., 2003) .",

The examples of SARS and avian influenza, and the relatively uncontrolled foodborne transmission of less dangerous viruses (e.g. noroviruses), illustrate that, should a novel pathogen with efficient foodborne transmission arise, we are likely to be ill prepared to handle such an event. SARS coronavirus was spread into the human population through the preparation and consumption of food of animal origin, which appears to have contracted the infection from another reservoir, probably bats (Lau et al., 2004b) . Infectious H5N1 avian influenza virus has been cultured from duck meat, and the consumption of duck blood has resulted in the infection of humans (Tumpey et al., 2003) . Recent Opinions from the BIOHAZ Panel in EFSA 11 , 12 reviewed the food safety aspects of avian influenza and of novel influenza virus H1N1, concluding that foodborne infection with avian influenza is unlikely but can not be ruled out entirely, and that food contaminated with nH1N1 influenza viruses does not appear to be a vehicle for infection in humans. SARS coronavirus and related viruses have been found in bat populations, also in Europe, but this does not at present constitute a significant risk for foodborne transmission (Drexler et al., 2010) . Similarly, H5N1 infections of humans are rare, and most frequently associated with direct contact with ill poultry. A third pathogen considered to be of concern in the WHO expert meeting are Nipah viruses, following observations of infection of humans following consumption of fruits contaminated with Nipah virus through saliva of fruit bats (Luby et al., 2006) . Again, here the biggest concern is the possible adaptation of these viruses to humans, as they are related to known viruses that are among the most transmissible human viruses that emerged from the animal world (e.g. measles).",

Viruses belonging to the Flavirus genus are mainly arthropod borne viruses but examples of zoonotic foodborne transmission have been reported. The tick borne encephalitis viruses (TBEV) are transmitted from their natural hosts, mostly rodents, by ticks (Ixodes sp) to humans, or for example to cows, sheep and goats. In these animals the viruses can be shed via milk and consumption of contaminated raw milk can lead to infection and a disease described as \"biphasic milk fever\" in humans. Moreover, infectious TBEV is found in yoghurt, butter and cheese and the viruses are able to survive in gastric juice for 2 hours. The high resistance to acid is not concomitant with a generalized high resistance to inactivation. Due to the lipid envelope, TBEV is readily inactivated by heat treatment, detergents and organic solvents. Even though a viremic phase is common during a TBEV infection in several animal species, foodborne infection via contaminated meat or organs is unlikely due to the fast virus inactivation at elevated temperatures. TBEV can produce a variety of clinical symptoms after an incubation period of 7 to 14 days. Common early symptoms are fatigue, headaches, and pain in neck, back and shoulders. These may progress into a sudden onset of the classical symptoms such as fever, nausea and vomiting, severe muscle pain in neck, back, shoulders and limbs, and encephalitis. The case fatality rate in Europe is in general low (0.5-1.5%) but may differ per virus strain and/or geographic region.",

Furthermore, volunteer studies have shown that protective immunity after infection may be absent or short-lived (Parrino et al., 1977) . The combination of antigenic diversity and the apparent lack of long term protective immunity are the likely cause of the occurrence of norovirus infections in children, adults and the elderly. In effect one individual may suffer repeated infections, even with viruses belonging to the same genotype and therefore people of all ages are affected by norovirus illness, unlike with e.g., rotavirus, where re-infection only occurs when a different serotype is encountered.",

The HBGA system is contolled by multiple gene families. Polymorphisms in the genes encoding these antigens or proteins that have a role in their biosynthesis have been demonstrated, resulting in differences in susceptibility of subgroups in the population for noroviruses.

Virion stability of HAV in the presence of biliary salts is guaranteed by the absence of a lipid envelope, which is not the case for serum hepatitis viruses. Symptomatic individuals as well as asymptomatic carriers shed virus that may contaminate water and food. HAV concentration in the patient stools is highest (up to 10 11 genome copies/g of feces) after two weeks of the onset of symptoms and lasts at least four more weeks. An additional concern is that viral excretion even in symptomatic patients starts before the onset of symptoms. Hepatitis A infection is mainly propagated via the faecal-oral route being the person-toperson contact the most common mode of transmission. In fact HAV persistence in contaminated fomites, such as sanitary paper, sanitary tile and latex gloves, is very long (Abad et al., 1994a) . In consequence, given the high excretion level of HAV, transmission of the infection is facilitated when poor sanitary conditions occur. In addition, active homosexual men are a risk group for HAV transmission and outbreaks are frequently reported (Stene-Johansen et al., 2002; Stene-Johansen et al., 2007; Tortajada et al., 2009) .

The incubation period in human volunteers after oral infection is 4 to 5 weeks; more variable incubation periods of 2 to 10 weeks have been reported during hepatitis E outbreaks (Aggarwal and Naik, 2009) . Clinical symptoms of hepatitis E in humans cannot be distinguished from the symptoms of other forms of viral hepatitis. Serologic or molecular evidence is required for the confirmation of a HEV infection as possible cause of the clinical symptoms. The general symptoms of hepatitis are anorexia, jaundice and liver enlargement (Purcell and Emerson, 2001) . Furthermore, about half the patients with hepatitis E display abdominal pain and tenderness, nausea and fever. Hepatitis E is mostly self-limiting and in general does not progress to chronicity (Jameel, 1999; Purcell and Emerson, 2001) , although several chronic cases have been reported recently (Gerolami et al., 2008; Haagsma et al., 2008; Kamar et al., 2008) . Fulminant hepatitis has been described in some cases. Case fatality rates among patients are generally low between 1 and 5 % (Pavio et al., 2010) , but may reach up to 25% in pregnant women for at least genotype 1 (Kumar et al., 2004) . Faecal shedding of HEV occurs in most hepatitis E cases for approximately 2 weeks . However, a small group of patients shows prolonged faecal excretion for up to 52 days as assayed by RT-PCR. For one patient, infectious HEV could be isolated from faeces in cell culture at 30 days after the onset of disease and HEV-RNA could be detected by RT-PCR for up to 121 days .",

Most of the infected pigs show a viraemia at 3 months of age and faecal shedding of HEV between 10 to 16 weeks of age. The immune response as reflected by seroconversion between 14 to 17 weeks of age usually limits the infection; however, a low number of pigs show prolonged shedding after 22 weeks of age. HEV mainly replicates in the liver of infected pigs; 0.8 to 11% pig livers sold in grocery stores in different countries have been shown to contain HEV RNA. The strong age dependence of the course of infection has not been found in wild boars as no significant differences in the HEV RNA detection rates in livers from different age classes were observed in these animals (Schielke et al., 2009 ).",

A volunteer orally infected with a 10% stool suspension derived from an HEV-infected patient developed clinical signs of hepatitis thus confirming the oral transmission route of HEV in humans (Chauhan et al., 1993) . By infection experiments with cynomolgus monkeys HEV infection as determined by seroconversion could be detected after intravenous inoculation of an HEV suspension containing one PCR-detectable genome unit (Tsarev et al., 1994) . Although the distinct sensitivity of the nested PCR protocol used for the definition of the PCR-detectable unit is not known, it can be concluded from the experiment, that the intravenous infectivity of HEV for cynomolgus monkeys is very high. In contrast, in the same study it was shown that oral inoculation of cynomolgus monkeys did not result in infection even after application of 10 5 PCR-detectable genome units. In addition, clinical signs of hepatitis as assayed by significant elevation of ALT activity in the blood were only evident after intravenous inoculation of more than 10 4 PCR-detectable genome units. Taken together, the results of the study suggest that the intravenous route of infection is more efficient than the oral route and that a relative high dose of virus is needed to induce hepatitis by any of the 2 routes. These results are largely confirmed by infection experiments with pigs, although clinical disease can mostly not be induced in these animals (Kasorndorkbua et al., 2004) .",

Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, which have an absolute requirement for a host organism in order to replicate themselves. Unlike bacteria, they possess no intrinsic metabolism, and can not replicate outside a host. If they contaminate the environment or a foodstuff, their numbers will not increase, and will only remain stable or decline from the original contaminating load. Conversely, they do not require nutrients to survive, unlike bacteria. The term \"survival\" used here means natural persistence of infectious viruses, i.e. when no process (such as heat, chemical disinfection etc.) has been deliberately applied to eliminate them. The longer a virus can persist outside a host, the greater are its chances for transmission between one host and another. Virus survival is affected by various conditions and factors such as temperature, moisture, and pH. Enteric viruses possess a degree of robustness which allows them to remain infectious during various ranges of these conditions that they may encounter in foodstuffs or the environment. This robustness is not shared to the same degree amongst all enteric virus types, with some being able to persist for longer than others in e.g. wetter or dryer environments, and others being more resistant to temperatures increases; but generally, all enteric viruses have a potential for persistence which contributes towards their potential as hazards in the environment or in foods.

By using a method combining enzymatic digestion of viral RNA with a molecular detection assay, and assuming that noninfectious particles possess damaged capsids which leave the genetic material exposed, the authors inferred that NoV could survive in an infectious state for up to 8 weeks on PVC and stainless steel surfaces at 4 o C, and up to 4 weeks at 20 o C, dependent on the humidity (high humidity being more conducive to survival).",

Nevertheless, information gained from the use of FCV as a surrogate may be instructive since the inference could be that NoV could display even more robust survival under the same conditions. Thus, when infectious FCV has been observed (Mattison et al., 2007) to persist on lettuce stored at 4 o C and 22.5 o C for 3 and 7 days respectively, and on strawberries stored at 4 o C and 22.5 o C for 3 and 7 days respectively, then it could be expected that NoV could persist in an infectious state for a longer period under such conditions. Baert et al., (2008c) found no reduction of MNV on spinach or onions held at -20 o C for 6 months; this is in keeping with observations that from outbreaks that indicate that NoV can survive in frozen produce and remain infectious from the time of processing to the time of consumption (Maunula et al., 2009 ).",

This pattern of survival is mirrored in the information from studies of other virus types (Rzezutka and Cook, 2004) , and the Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures Relating to Public Health 14 considered it useful to take this information into regard as a determination of the likely survival of NoV in similar conditions. Thus, NoV can be expected to persist up to several weeks on vegetable crops which have been in contact with contaminated sewage or irrigation water, and, on fresh produce under conditions commonly used for storage in households, at least as long as the time generally taken between purchase and consumption. The overall message is that NoV, once it has contaminated a foodstuff at source, could remain infectious long enough for consumption of that foodstuff to constitute a risk to the consumer.",

            "text": "HAV has been shown experimentally to be able to survive in several environments, such as water, foods and surfaces (Rzezutka and Cook, 2004) . HAV can persist for up to 5 hours at pH 1 (Scholz et al., 1989) and can remain viable in faeces after drying for at least 30 days under conditions simulating a typical environmental exposure (McCaustland et al., 1982) . In other experimental studies, HAV could survive for at least 4 hours on faecally contaminated surfaces, such as stainless steel, and could be transferred from there to fingertips, and back again (Mbithi et al., 1991) . Transfer was positively influenced by moisture. Abad et al., (1994a) found that HAV could survive on various materials for at least 60 d. HAV was more generally more resistant to desiccation than other enteric viruses such as adenovirus and poliovirus. The persistence of HAV on environmental surfaces and its ability to transfer to animate environments may be important factors in the spread of this virus, especially in food preparation settings. For instance, cafeteria trays contaminated by an infected food handler, with which food came in direct contact, were the vehicle in at least one foodborne hepatitis A outbreak (Cliver, 1985) . Terpstra et al., (2007) studied survival of HAV on stainless steel surfaces. Storage of the contaminated stainless steel at room temperature resulted in less than 1 log10 reduction after 7 days, and virus could still be found on the material after 28 days.",

This potential promotes their chances of being collected by filter-feeding shellfish. Outbreak investigations have indicated that viruses can persist in shellfish over several weeks following contamination (Conaty et al., 2000; Lees, 2000) . In fresh waters, it is possible that HAV could survive for several days with little loss of infectivity. In river waters, little or no decline in infectivity of HAV was observed after 48 d (Springthorpe et al., 1993) . In groundwater, HAV could survive longer than 12 weeks, losing only approximately 1 % infectivity during that period (Sobsey et al., 1989) . In tap water, HAV survived at various temperatures for up to 60 days (Enriquez et al., 1995) . This information indicates that HAV could survive long enough in water, between a contamination event and the use of the water for crop irrigation or during food processing, to constitute a risk to health. Irrigation of crops with contaminated water or organic waste is a potential means of contaminating foodstuffs with enteric viruses, and studies with other enteric virus types, e.g. poliovirus have demonstrated that viruses can be transferred to the surfaces of vegetables and persist there for several days, following the application of sewage sludge or effluent (Rzezutka and Cook, 2004) . Stine et al., (2005b) studied the survival of HAV inoculated onto the surface of fruits of cantaloupe, lettuce and bell peppers. In this particular study, survival was significantly longer on cantaloupe than on lettuce or bell peppers, and virus survived better in conditions of low relative humidity.",

The carrots and fennel were cut into small pieces, inoculated with HAV by draining, afterwards strained, lay to dry and divided into aliquots of 20 g. On these vegetables, a more pronounced decline in HAV infectivity was observed, with complete inactivation of HAV by day 4 for carrot and by day 7 for fennel. It was considered that this may have been due to the presence of antimicrobial substances in these vegetables.

In contrast to most microbiological agents, viruses cannot grow on food and thus the contamination level cannot increase during processing or storage but survival should be considered due to a high infectivity (Carter, 2005; Koopmans and Duizer, 2004) . The effect of food processing treatments on NoV and HAV is therefore discussed in the sections below. In the first place, the effect of acidification on microbial growth inhibition is described. Secondly, the use of preservation methods for microbial inactivation (such as heat treatment, high hydrostatic pressure processing and irradiation) to eliminate viruses is discussed and presented (see also table 3.) Finally, the efficacy of decontamination methods on fresh produce (see also table 4), and purification procedures applied on live bivalve shellfish to reduce the viral load is included. EFSA Journal 2011;9(7):2190 The incubation of Feline Calicivirus and Canine Calicivirus at a pH of 2 or lower for 30 min at 37\u00b0C induced more than 5 log inactivation . Less than 1 log reduction of MNV-1 was observed when exposed to a pH of 2 at 37\u00b0C for 30 min while FCV was reduced by 4.4 log after exposure to the same conditions (Cannon et al., 2006) . Infective virus particles were still found when a NoV stool filtrate was subjected to a pH of 2.7 for 3 h (Dolin et al., 1972 , 2006) . Dispersed reductions of FCV for the same time-temperature combination were achieved by (Doultree et al., 1999) and (Buckow et al., 2008) . The experimental setup was likely to be responsible for the differences in heat inactivation rates. MNV-1 showed a reduction of 2.81 log after exposure to 75\u00b0C for 0.25 min in 10 g of preheated raspberry puree (Baert et al., 2008b) . Slomka and Appleton, (1998) Removal of viruses by washing depends on produce type. In general, a maximum of 1-2 log removal of micro-organisms could be achieved by washing produce with water (Beuchat, 1998) which is in accordance with the reported decline of viruses.",

Heat treatment to an internal temperature of 85\u00b0C -90\u00b0C, maintained for 90 seconds, may destroy viruses in molluscs but careful control is necessary to achieve this without toughening of the shellfish flesh. Hewitt and Greening, (2006) showed differences in HAV inactivation in New Zealand greenshell mussels (Perna canaliculus) depending on the method of cooking, where boiling for 3 min was more effective than steaming for 3 min to inactivate HAV. Abad et al., (1997) also showed incomplete inactivation of HAV and rotavirus after steaming mussels for 3 min after the shells opened. Cooked clams have been implicated in hepatitis outbreaks linked to Peruvian imported bivalves Sanchez et al., 2002) . Millard et al., (1987) reported that when the internal temperature of cockle meat was raised to 85-90\u00b0C and hold it for 1 min, HAV was inactivated. Bidawid et al., (2000c) studied heat inactivation of HAV in sterile skimmed milk (0% fat), homogenized milk (3.5% fat) and table cream (18% fat). At 71\u00b0C, exposure of 0.16, 0.18 and 0.52 min were needed in respectively skimmed milk, homogenized milk and cream to reduce HAV by 1 log whereas 4 log reduction required 6.55 (skim), 8.31 (homogenized) and 12.67 (cream) min. A longer heat treatment was needed in cream to achieve similar inactivation of HAV compared to milk. The high fat content presumably protected HAV towards heat. However, a recent study found that milk offered no protective effect for HAV . Thermo-resistance of HAV inoculated in synthetic media mimicking chemical characteristics of strawberry mashes was investigated (Deboosere et al., 2004) . These experiments showed that high sucrose concentration (indicated as Brix value) increased HAV heat resistance, and that low pH decreased HAV heat resistance. In 1 g strawberry mash (sucrose concentration of 28\u00b0 Brix, pH 3.8), HAV was lowered by 1 log after a heat treatment consisting of 2 min to reach 85\u00b0C followed by 0.96 min at 85\u00b0C (Deboosere et al., 2004) . studied the persistence of HAV in mashed raspberries and sliced green onions. HAV exposed to pressures of 375 MPa at 21\u00b0C for 5 min was reduced by respectively 4.3 and 4.7 log in strawberry puree and on sliced green onions. Structural and organoleptic changes were observed for treated whole green onions and strawberries, although sliced green onions or strawberry puree might be accepted by consumers and can be used as flavor enhancers or as ingredient for cream, jams, juices or smoothies. HPP was used to treat oysters with a pressure of 400 MPa for 1 min (9.0\u00b0C) and induced 3 log reduction of HAV (Calci et al., 2005) .",

Time-course analyses showed that about 95% of the genotype 1 strain was inactivated within the first 15 minutes at 56\u00b0C although some remaining infectious virus was still detectable after one hour at this temperature. Another study using PLC/PRF/5 cells showed that heating of a genotype 3-containing stool sample at 25\u00b0C or at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes did not influence the infectivity whereas heating at 70\u00b0C or at 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes or at 95\u00b0C for 1 minute prevented the growth of the virus . By monitoring of seroconversion of pigs experimentally inoculated with an HEV genotype 3-containing liver suspension it was shown that incubation at 56\u00b0C for one hour did not affect infectivity, whereas the suspension was no longer infective after heating at 71\u00b0C or at 100\u00b0C for five minutes (Feagins et al., 2008) . The investigations show that HEV is relative stable against heat treatment and that remarkable differences exist between the different strains; however, heating at 70\u00b0C for 10 minutes or at 95\u00b0C for 1 minute seems to be sufficient for inactivation of HEV in each case.",

Thus a comprehensive suite of controls was also developed to cover: positive and negative process controls; negative RNA extraction control; positive RT-PCR and RT-PCR inhibition controls; negative and positive PCR controls. The positive process control measures the recovery of virus during the whole extraction and test procedure using a heterologous non-enveloped positive-sense ssRNA virus spiked into the test sample and assayed in parallel with the target viruses. During the development of the method inter-laboratory studies by the working group successfully utilised the MC0 strain of Mengo virus (Costafreda et al., 2006) as a process control. The negative process control is a known negative sample that is taken through the entire extraction procedure and analysed. The RT-PCR inhibition control checks for potential matrix suppression by comparison of amplification of an external RNA template added to test material and a control well. Taken together the controls generate data on all aspects of the assay and are utilised to determine the acceptability of test performance against established quality control criteria.",

The target genomic regions have not been stadardised, with the exception of the work done by the CEN group (Marshall and Bruggink, 2006) . RT-PCR is relatively sensitive, offering the possibility of detecting a low quantity of virus, using degenerate primers targeting conserved genomic regions. However, due to the high degree of variation among NoV, some NoV strains may not be detected. In clinical practice this usually is not problematic given the dominance of a limited number of genotypes. In other situations and in reference laboratories care should be taken to monitor testperformance against less common genotypes. Real-time PCR is increasingly used, which is more sensitive and faster than RT-PCR. Using real-time PCR with virus-specific-primer and probe combinations in multiplex assays, the detection of multiple different viruses in one test has become feasible. Additionally, real-time assays are semi-quantitative, i.e., a decrease in Ct values for the same virus indicates that the amount of viral RNA present in samples has increased, which may be indicative for clinical significance of the test results. This enables the use of viral loads as parameter in interpretation of test results. Although this is not yet common practice, the approach holds some promise for the future (Phillips et al., 2009) . NoV may also be shed by asymptomatic individuals, and on average lower viral loads have been found in such patients. Also, viral loads may differ between genotypes, and this may have consequences for the probability of subsequent onward transmission (Chan et al., 2006) .",

Advantages of EIA testing over PCR based assays include simplicity (no specialized equipment or skilled personnel required) and speed (rapid bed-side tests have been developed based on an EIA that promise results within 15 minutes). The EIAs use either monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies specific for a limited number of antigenically-distinct NoV genotypes, which can be problematic in the detection of antigenic variants or emerging genotypes (Gray et al., 2007) . Knowledge of the local circulating NoV genotypes is helpful in evaluating the efficiency of the EIA in a particular setting (de Bruin et al., 2006) . Moreover, if outbreak samples are negative by the EIA test, they should be further screened by RT-PCR. The low sensitivity of EIA tests (between 44 and 59%) makes them less suitable for diagnosing sporadic cases, unless negative results are, again, followed by RT-PCR analysis. Currently serology has no role in the diagnosis of NoV infections.",

Given the low prevalence of HEV, the rate of false positive serological assays is relatively high, and confirmation of reactivity by immunoblot and RNA detection by RT-PCR are recommended (Herremans et al., 2007) . There is some evidence that diagnosis of the genotype 3 HEV infections by commercial assays developed for diagnosis of HEV in travellers (hence mostly infections with genotypes 1 and 2) is less sensitive. In addition, in immunocompromised patients, prolonged viremia has been detected, sometimes in the absence of a measurable antibody titre (Haagsma et al., 2008) .

In outbreak surveillance, GGII4 viruses are by far the most commonly identified viruses, often associated with outbreaks in healthcare settings and with person-to-person transmission. The non GII4 viruses are more often found in other settings, including those where food has been implicated as the source of an outbreak (Kroneman et al., 2008) . This information can be used to triage the outbreaks reported to public health officials: in some regions, particularly during the winter season, outbreaks are so common that it is impossible to follow-up on each of them ). Further support for unravelling the source of outbreaks may come from careful comparison the diversity of viruses identified in routinely sampled foods (e.g. shellfish) with that of viruses found in humans, an approach similar to what has been used for many years for assessing the role of different animal species in human Salmonellosis. A first application was recently published, indicating this might indeed be used. However, it requires systematic routine data collection and integration into a common database, a practice that is not routine in Europe . (Siebenga et al., 2009; Vinje et al., 2004) Hepatitis A genotyping has not been used very extensively, although the first studies defining lineages of HAV date from over 20 years ago. Robertson et al., (1991) used sequence diversity in the VP1-2a junction. In this region, seven genotypes were initially defined, whose genetic distance was >15% nucleotide variation. After refining this classification through the addition of more sequences, only six genotypes exist at the present time (Costa-Mattioli et al., 2002; Lu et al., 2004) . Three out of these six genotypes (I, II and III) are of human origin while the others (IV, V and VI) are of simian origin. Genotypes I and II contain subgenotypes (Ia, Ib, IIa and IIb) defined by a nucleotide divergence of 7-7.5%. The use of long genomic regions (Costa-Mattioli et al., 2002) has recently been recommended for a broad molecular typing of HAV, but this is far from common practice due to lack of resources.",

The VP1-2A target has been used quite extensively for genotyping, but provides relatively poor resolution. Most promising seems to be the VP1 region, and specifically the N-terminal part, although in 1 study 1100 nucleotides in this area were sequenced and 100% homology was found comparing the outbreak strain to some 'background' sequences (Dentinger et al., 2001) . Also the 2C area appears to be relatively variable, although only few strains have yet been sequenced in this area (Joshi et al., 2008) . More in general, a larger area sequenced gives better results. Genetic sequencing may be used to confirm a foodborne HAV outbreak, but the methodology to be used depends on the nature of the source and the level of endemicity of HAV in the region. In addition, the robustness and level of resolution of the genotyping result in part depends on the choice of the targets that were used. This should be taken into consideration when using sequence data as evidence. There is currently no example of the systematic use of sequence data from notified HAV cases to link cases with unknown risk factors to food-sources. Examples from outbreak investigations suggest that this may be possible.",

Because of the distinct geographical distribution of genotypes 1, 2 and 4 (see Section 2.2.2), genotyping may give a first indication on the global region, in which the infection took place. Further classification into subtypes is possible (Lu et al., 2006) , which may enable a further narrowing of the possible origin of infection and which is especially useful for the extremely diverse genotypes 3 and 4.

Nevertheless, they are present in sufficient quantities to pose a health risk. This low level of contamination has made it necessary to develop highly sensitive viral extraction methods to ensure virus recovery from shellfish tissues. The observation that viruses are concentrated in digestive diverticulum tissues led to the development of a method that represented a major step in the improvement of extraction methodologies (Atmar et al., 1995; Metcalf et al., 1980) . Focusing the analysis of shellfish on the digestive tissues, which represent about one tenth of the total animal weight for oysters and mussels, enhances assay performance by eliminating tissues (i.e. adductor muscle) that are rich in inhibitors (Atmar et al., 1995) . With the exception of small species, such as clams or cockles, in which dissection may be technically difficult, most of recent methods are based on dissected tissues.",

However, some of the information which can be gleaned from outbreak investigations hints at the scale of contamination of fresh produce when it occurs. In several outbreaks, hundreds of people have become ill, and often this has occurred in different locations, e.g. the outbreak of gastroenteritis in Denmark in 2005 (Falkenhorst et al., 2005) , which took place in two Danish cities, and the outbreak of hepatitis in the USA in 1997, in which several states were involved. This strongly indicates widespread contamination of a large amount of the original foodstuff batch, especially since viruses cannot replicate in foods. Another indication of the potential scale of contamination is given in the information acquired during the outbreak of hepatitis which occurred in Scotland in 1983 (Reid and Robinson, 1987) . Here, a 3 lb (~1.5 kg) batch of raspberries was implicated as the vehicle of transmission. One of the people who became ill was a caterer who prepared a dessert from the fruit, and reported that they had merely tasted it, probably by dipping the edge of a spoon into the pureed fruit and touching it to their tongue. If the tiny quantity of contaminated food that was consumed in that action contained a dose of HAV (>10 particles), the quantity of HAV in the contaminated raspberry batch may have been massive.",

A survey with respect to risk factors to contract NoV gastroenteritis, showed that having a household member with gastroenteritis, contact with a person with gastroenteritis outside the household, and poor food-handling hygiene were associated with illness (de Wit et al., 2003) . Foodborne NoV outbreaks are often linked to food handlers who infect foods that are eaten raw or not further processed (ready to eat (RTE) foods) prior to consumption (Baert et al., 2008a) . In many of these outbreaks, a sick food-handler or food-handler with a recent history of gastroenteritis was noticed (Anderson et al., 2001; Boxman et al., 2007; de Wit et al., 2007; Godoy et al., 2005; Lederer et al., 2005; Payne et al., 2006; Sakon et al., 2005; Schmid et al., 2007) . Workers have often been in contact with ill family members including children before the worker handled food. An example is a foodborne NoV outbreak which occurred after a pre-Christmas celebration among a group of local foresters in Austria in December 2007 where 21 out of 63 persons became ill (Kuo et al., 2009) . Ham roll remained significantly associated with disease risk and was most likely contaminated with NoV during preparation by a disease-free kitchen assistant, whose infant became sick with laboratoryconfirmed NoV gastroenteritis 2 days before the party. Outbreaks of infection with hepatitis A virus associated with a foodhandler have also been reported (Chironna et al., 2004) .",

It was concluded that the risk of infection was found to be variable depending on type of crop, irrigation method, and days between last irrigation event and harvest. Moreover, predicted infection rates were significantly underestimated if the presence of a persistent sub-population of viruses was not considered in the decay kinetics of the risk model. modelled the clinging of viruses to lettuce crops through sprayed irrigation water best fit by a negative binomial distribution. However, the volume of retained water was obtained from a study in which lettuce heads were completely immersed in water (Shuval et al., 1997) . This procedure may not represent the volume of water retained after irrigation, which therefore should be examined. Furthermore, actual consumption data were not included in the model, but instead the risk was verified for a fixed consumption of 100 g. Stine et al., (2005a) estimated the maximum concentration of HAV on crops resulting in a 1:10,000 annual infection risk. Hamilton et al., (2006) estimated the risk of infection for enterovirus due to consumption of arable crops, including lettuces, that were contaminated by irrigation water. The authors conducted field experiments to estimate the amount of irrigation water retained on broccoli and cabbage, and used the previously described estimates from Shuval et al., (1997) for lettuce. The remainder of the study is similar to that of , with the difference that consumption is represented as function of bodyweight by Hamilton et al., (2006) . Up to date mostly worst case scenarios are modelled, however, practices such as subsurface, furrow, or drip irrigation and postharvest washing/disinfection and food preparation could substantially lower risks and need to be considered in future models (Hamilton et al., 2006) . The risk from use of virus contaminated treated wastewater for irrigation of crops was assessed by Munoz et al., (2010) . The assessment of risks from viruses showed a very low probability of infection. With respect to the models used, Regli et al., (1991) and Haas et al., (1993) provide a theoretical background to assess an infection risk due to consumption of drinking water, which was used for FBV. Regli et al., (1991) describe the assumptions that are required to be made in virological risk assessment and evaluates different dose-response models (i.e., exponential vs. beta Poisson). Haas et al., (1993) provides an approach for including uncertainty and variability into risk assessments. The theories about distributions, homogenization, dose-response models and uncertainty and variability described in these two papers are valuable for QMRA's for FBV in future. ",

Legislative standards controlling permitted levels of faecal pollution world-wide utilise faecal indicator bacteria, for bivalve shellfish most countries employ either faecal coliforms or E. coli. These may be measured in the water column (USA system) or directly in the flesh of the bivalves (EU system). It is also possible to stipulate, on a precautionary principle, sea areas that should not be permitted for production based on the presence of known polluting sources such as sewage pipe discharges.

Competent Authorities in EU Member States are required to define the location and boundaries of production (and relaying) areas and to classify the areas according to one of the three categories set out in Table 10 . They are further required to establish a sampling (monitoring) programme, which should be representative, to ensure that bivalve molluscs harvested from the area comply with the established classification. If bivalves do not comply with the criteria the Competent Authority must close or reclassify the area. An essential first step prior to setting up a sampling programme is to survey the faecal pollution inputs, and their potential circulation within the production area, so that sampling points can be determined as representative according to scientific principles. This 'sanitary survey' is a requirement of both US and EU regulations. However, in the EU this only applies to areas classified after 2006 and hence monitoring programmes for the majority of production areas in the EU (which were established prior to 2006) are not based on sanitary surveys. EU legislation does not contain detailed rules for implementation of monitoring programmes -for example key aspects, such as the required monitoring frequency, is not specified. An EU working group 21 has drawn up detailed best practice guidance; however compliance with these rules is not mandatory. For the highest quality (class A) areas EU legislation does not require any further food processing to reduce the risk from faecal contamination. However, even such high quality areas are still occasionally associated with virus outbreaks (Dore et al., 2010; Maalouf et al., 2010a) . For other more contaminated areas the food processing measures required by legislation are either depuration (selfpurification) in tanks of clean seawater, relaying (self-purification in the natural environment) or commercial heat treatment (cooking) by an approved method. Bivalve molluscs that do not conform with any of the classification categories (i.e. that exceed class C levels) cannot be classified and hence cannot be placed on the market for human consumption. Some EU Member States have introduced a 'prohibited' classification to describe such areas. The operation of depuration, relaying and approved heat treatment processes by food business operators is subject to further detailed legislative rules (Reg. 853/2004) . In all cases following such treatments the end-product prior to marketing must comply with a standard of <230 E. coli per 100g of shellfish flesh and intravalvular liquid (Reg. 2073/2005). The E. coli methods that may be used for both monitoring of production areas, and determining compliance with the end-product standard, are controlled by EU legislation (Regs. 854/2004 (Regs. 854/ , 2073 (Regs. 854/ /2005 . Essentially a reference method is stipulated and either this must be used or an alternative method demonstrated to give equivalent results through a validation programme conducted according to international rules.",

            "text": "The risk management measures prescribed by EU legislation vary in their effectiveness for reducing virus risk. Heat processing can be very effective if performed correctly (Reg. 853/2004) and in the UK following the introduction of revised criteria (raising core mollusc temperatures to 90\u00baC for 90 seconds) hepatitis outbreaks from cockles harvested in the Thames estuary were brought under control (Lees, 2000) . However, for products marketed live, depuration and relaying whilst effective at controlling bacterial infections (such as salmonellosis and typhoid), have been less effective for viruses. Depuration is a widely used commercial processing option in the EU. However, both epidemiological and laboratory studies show that depuration times and conditions currently used are inadequate to remove viruses (Lees, 2000; Richards et al., 2010) . A key issue is that the legislative measure of acceptable quality of products placed on the market following depuration is compliance with an E. coli standard of <230 E. coli per 100g of shellfish flesh. Thus EU legislation does not specify key process criteria, such as duration of depuration or tank temperature, which may be critical for effective virus removal. Although, in line with general food law, depuration is required to be operated according to HACCP principles, the historic inability to measure virus contamination has left operators and authorities with little information on which to base virus removal criteria. In practise compliance with the E. coli requirement has been, and continues to be, the main determining factor and this is reinforced by the legislative text (Reg. 853/2004). Unfortunately there are many examples where bivalve shellfish causing outbreaks have been found to be fully compliant with the prescribed E. coli standard (Croci et al., 2000; Le Guyader et al., 2006a; Le Guyader et al., 2010; Lees, 2000; Sanchez et al., 2002) . Alternate indicators such as coliphages, or adenovirus have been suggested (Dore et al., 2000; Formiga-Cruz et al., 2003) , but none have yet been accepted. The main factors were insufficient scientific data underpinning the necessary correlation between presence of bacteriophages and viruses, together with the consequences for the industry.",

However, the Regulations do not contain detail on how this should be performed. For example the Regulations do not stipulate a monitoring frequency, or how to select a monitoring point or how to interpret a data set in order to establish a classification. Consequently actual practices vary widely among EU Member States and will also vary in countries importing bivalves into the EU. In some cases this is likely to lead to differential health outcomes. An EU working group has elaborated agreed guidance on best practice for monitoring and classification. The general health status of EU bivalves could be improved by ensuring that such best practice was adopted more widely in the EU and third countries -particularly for high risk products. Sanitary surveys are an assessment of pollution sources impacting a production area. They are an essential first step in a systematic approach for the design of monitoring programmes since they enable monitoring points to be located according to the identified pollution sources. However, this requirement was introduced into EU regulations in 2006 and areas classified before this time (the majority of production areas in the EU) do not require sanitary surveys unless they are re-classified. This can mean that the monitoring programmes for a large number of production areas are not established on a scientific basis. The health status of many production areas, particular where high risk species are produced, could be improved by making sanitary surveys compulsory for all areas. Currently there is no requirement in EU legislation to report on the hygiene status of production areas. Public domain publication (e.g. an annual reporting requirement) of classifications, sanitary survey assessments, and associated monitoring data, would lead to improved transparency in sanitary assessments and would thus probably improve the health quality of intercommunity trade and also of imports into the EU, which have been responsible for a number of outbreaks. The E. coli standards stipulated in EU legislation regarding classification criteria are essentially arbitrary risk management levels. The sanitary quality of bivalves could be improved by lowering the pollution (E. coli) levels permitted. This is probably most relevant for depurated high risk products (e.g. oysters) originating from class B production areas since depuration is known to be problematical in removing enteric viruses. The upper level of class B is relatively high, and exceeding this level by 10% is also permitted. Another way of improving the situation would be to specify in class A and B (low level of contamination) the critical points [i.e. old sewage infrastructures, ageing municipal treatment plant or other (important watershed slop, presence of agriculture spreading)] leading to possible intermittent introduction for a short time of faecal discharges.",

            "text": "Under EU legislation the only permitted treatments for class B or C bivalves molluscs placed live on the market are relaying and/or depuration. Both essentially rely on continuation of the normal mollusc filter-feeding processes using clean seawater to flush or purge out faecal contaminants. Relaying is conducted in the natural environment, depuration (also termed purification) in tanks. Molluscs need to be in good condition and with the correct physiological conditions to purify successfully. Hence, it is important to ensure that critical parameters such as temperature, salinity, oxygen levels, etc are well controlled. This creates a significant problem for regulation since it is not possible to stipulate in legislation the great variety of critical physiological parameters for the range of European species and habitats. Instead, EU legislation relies heavily on the use of compliance with the E. coli end-product standard (<230 E. coli per 100g) for determining acceptable practices. The key problem here is that viruses are removed much more slowly than bacteria during depuration and relaying and hence molluscs compliant with the E. coli standard may still contain enteric viruses and cause outbreaks. This was noted in a previous opinion by the SCVPH which issued an opinion on Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs, noroviruses) on 30-31 January 2002. In that opinion it concluded that the conventional faecal indicators are unreliable for demonstrating the presence or absence of NLVs and that the reliance on faecal bacterial indicator removal for determining shellfish purification times is unsafe practice. Unfortunately this is still the case. Depuration remains a widely utilized food process within the EU for treatment of class B bivalve molluscs prior to placing on the market. Many outbreaks of virus illness, including recent ones, can be traced to depurated shellfish (see 6.1.2) hence this process as currently performed under EU legislation is demonstrably not providing adequate levels of public health protection. However, there are indications that relaying, since it can be performed for much longer periods, is capable of reducing virus levels and can be an effective process when used in combination with depuration and when the process in monitored using PCR (Dore et al., 2010) . Since methods for detecting NoV and HAV are now available a much more effective approach would be to require food business operators to determine the depuration and relaying operating procedures incorporated into their HACCP plans according to removal of human enteric viruses rather than E. coli.",

Environmental legislation is necessary to control pollution sources as diverse as municipal sewage discharges, combined storm overflows, discharges from boats and individual dwellings, etc. Currently bivalve mollusc production areas received protection through the Shellfish Waters Directive 23 (2006/113/EC) which sets a guideline microbial standard. However, this Directive is due to be repealed in 2012 and its measures subsumed into the Waters Framework Directive 24 (2000/60/EC). Unfortunately this directive does not contain any specific microbiological standards for shellfish waters and therefore it is difficult to see how the current safeguards can be maintained. A mandatory E. coli and/or virus standard in the Water Framework Directive for designated bivalve shellfish areas (particularly for high risk species), coupled with a specified time period for improvement of areas failing the standard, would considerably improve the overall health status of EU bivalve molluscs.",

Currently, for example, there are no legislative controls preventing harvesting in the immediate vicinity of sewage discharges. Such practices present obvious high risks and are clearly unsatisfactory. For example extended legislation could require a mandatory harvesting prohibition zone round all human discharge sources (a minimum distance or dilution criteria could be established). Such measures are already incorporated into bivalve mollusc sanitation legislation in countries outside of the EU. However, this could only be applied if a sanitary survey had been performed in the production area and thus the pollution sources were documented. This measure would thus also require sanitary surveys to be performed for all production areas (see above) as a first step. Sanitary surveys also provide the fundamental pollution impact data needed to consider proactive management of bivalve production areas. In some countries, for example the USA, production areas are actively managed to avoid harvesting during pollution episodes such as during periods of heavy rainfall. Thus contaminated products can avoid being placed on the market. European research projects (Seafoodplus, Food-CT-2004-506359) and Virus Safe Seafood, QLK1-1999-00634) have demonstrated the validity of this approach in a European context which has significant potential benefits for both producers and public health.",

Improved kitchen hygiene may prevent transfer of HEV from raw meat to products thereafter eaten raw; however, the relative importance of this transmission route is not clear so far (see below).

Long-term heating of meat and liver derived from wild boars and pigs might be suggested for these risk groups. Scientific evidence of severe clinical hepatitis E courses in pregnant women is currently only available for the endemic regions in the developing countries; however, the number of well documented clinical hepatitis E courses in pregnant women in Europe is very low thus the possibility of underestimation is present.

            "text": "Inactivated HAV vaccines are available since the early 90s and provide long-lasting immunity against hepatitis A infection. The immunity is largely related to the induction of high titters of specific antibodies. Thanks to the existence of a single serotype of HAV, these vaccines are of high efficacy. These vaccines consist of viruses grown to high titters in cell culture, purified, inactivated with formalin and adsorbed to an aluminium hydroxide adjuvant, making their economic cost quite high. This is the reason why many discrepancies already exist on their universal use in massive vaccination campaigns. Countries with previous intermediate endemicity of HAV such as Israel or some Autonomous Communities of Spain such as Catalonia, or some States of United States have performed studies on the beneficial impact of child vaccination on the overall incidence of hepatitis A concluding that the immunization is medically (Dominguez et al., 2008; Wasley et al., 2005) and economically (Dagan et al., 2005) justified. In contrast other countries in a similar situation such as Italy do not recommend at present the implementation of such a measure in terms of cost-benefits (Franco and Vitiello, 2003) . In this context is quite evident that high endemic countries that usually have low economic incomes do not regard the vaccination against hepatitis A as a primary policy (Teppakdee et al., 2002) . Although several attenuated vaccine candidates have also been attempted, due to the successful use of inactivated vaccines, its development is hardly plausible.",

NoV and Sapovirus are the two out of five genera of the family Caliciviridae that contain viruses that cause infections in humans. NoV have also been detected in pigs, cattle, mice, cats, dogs, and sheep, and sapoviruses in pigs. The other genera of the family Caliciviridae are Lagovirus, Vesivirus, and Nebovirus encompassing viruses infecting rabbits, and brown hares (lagoviruses), sea lions, swine, cats, dogs, fish, seals, other marine animals, cattle and primates (vesiviruses), and cattle (Nebovirus). In humans, NoV and sapoviruses cause gastroenteritis, while the animal viruses can cause a range of different clinical syndromes, including oral lesions, systemic disease with hemorrhagic syndromes, upper respiratory tract infections and other. Furthermore, one other potential genus comprising viruses detected in rhesus macaques has been described. So far, the NoV and sapoviruses are the only caliciviruses known to cause disease in humans, with the exception of anecdotal zoonotic infection with vesiviruses. NoV can be divided into distinct genogroups, based on phylogenetic analyses of the capsid protein. To date, five NoV genogroups (G) have been recognized (GI-GV). Viruses of GI, GII and GIV are known to infect humans. GII viruses have additionally been detected in pigs, and GIV viruses have been detected in a lion cub and a dog. GIII viruses infect cattle and sheep and GV viruses infect mice. Recombination between viruses from different genogroups is rare suggesting that this constitutes a species level in taxonomy.",
