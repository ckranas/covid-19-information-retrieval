The dangers were recognized and the 'beast' was tamed and domesticated. In respect to radiation protection, the most significant achievements took place in the first half of that development. Throughout the recent decades, some further considerable steps in dose reduction took place mainly by the improvement of film-screen systems and the recent introduction of computed (CR) and digitized radiography (DR). Even if the early computerized X-ray imaging brought a slight increase in patient doses (which was overcompensated later on by direct digital radiography) a whole new world of further advantages launched the digital era in which we live today. As we all know new dangers arose with these techniques as the uncontrolled distribution of images and thereby confidential patient data over hospital departments and across borders throughout. Also, the risk of an evitable overexposure in digital radiography is a significant issue. Throughout the process of taming the radiation and controlling it, today's doses are attained within the lowest range of the danger scale. This range still is perceived as a black box within which we do not exactly know which concept reflects the potential harm best. The linear no-threshold model [LNT] is acknowledged as the concept which most reliably supports the idea of radiation protection. Other concepts partly oppose the linear idea and question the relevance of that dose range because there lie so much greater health benefits in the appropriate use of diagnostic X-rays. Several scientists even propagate the idea that very low levels are producing health benefits instead of physical harm [hormesis model].",

As trained medical professionals we are fully aware of the fact that there is only little potential harm to the patient by using X-rays in the current state of the art.

This was the case for example with single slice CT before the invention of spiral CT by Willi Kalender, Germany and Peter Vock, Switzerland in 1988. Often the plain X-ray image was meant to be needless or redundant as newer technologies like CT or MRI approached. But it still is of value because of different reasons as the low dose, high availability, well known and easy interpretation to name a few. There are some new and sophisticated techniques on the way like the \"Smart X-ray Source\" which uses coherent beams of X-rays from an array of micronsized point sources, developed by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The developers promise less radiation, less weight of the equipment and a far better soft tissue resolution. Another promising approach is phase contrast X-ray imaging which has the potential to reduce the dose up to 1/100 of the actual value. It also has its strengths in additional soft tissue information as recent experimental publications show (Paul Scherrer Institute Switzerland) e. g. in functional evaluation of lung fluid (Munich, Germany). Functional imaging of the lungs can also be achieved without any radiation as the development of the known concept of electrical impedance tomography highlights. This functional imaging method usually is not within the modality spectrum of radiologists.",

Justification is a shared responsibility between radiologists and clinicians. There are many tools available for justification like the appropriateness criteria, guidelines or rules (like wrist or ankle rules) of several national societies and different study groups. The process of optimization is mainly in the hands of the technicians. As many studies show, the proper collimation still has the greatest effect on dose reduction. Other important factors are the positioning of the patient and the shielding of radiosensitive organs which are not relevant for image interpretation so that they may be covered by lead shields. The proper use of the grid in bigger children can now partially be replaced by software solutions. In digital radiography, a profound knowledge of postprocessing possibilities is mandatory as well as the active control of the exposure indices. Dose limitation procedures should be regularly checked in a team-based approach to avoid overexposure by less experienced staff or \"exposure creep\". Existing standards should be actively used to guarantee a constant satisfactory image quality. In 2011, the image gently campaign released a safety checklist for performing digital radiography examinations on pediatric patients which is easily applicable to every radiology service. Organizational improvements: At regional and national level, efforts should be made to check for best practice use in the departments and to compare and discuss imaging strategies. The establishment of national and international dose reference levels helps to keep the overall doses low and to protect the population from unnecessary overexposure. The PiDRL Project prepared the \"European diagnostic reference levels for pediatric imaging\" as part of the EuroSafe project. Momentarily the results of PiDRL-workgroup are harmonized with international organizations. The European Guidelines on DRLs for Paediatric Imaging can be accessed as a preliminary final for workshop drafts on the internet. On a worldwide basis, the World Health Organization has published a fundamental information brochure concerning radiation risks and the communication of health professionals and patients. Health care professionals have a shared responsibility for communicating risks and benefits of imaging procedures to patients, especially in the case of pediatric patients. The document \"Communicating radiation risks in paediatric imaging-Information to support health care discussions about benefit and risk\" is intended to serve as a tool for health care providers, to communicate known or potential radiation risks associated with pediatric imaging procedures and to support risk-benefit dialogue in health care settings.",

Among other issues, there was a question if it shouldn't be a logical consequence to transfer kids from areas with higher background radiation to safer areas. The author's answers were clear: that Swiss health authorities better concentrate their efforts more effectively and with greater benefit for more people by supporting prevention \"toward modifiable environmental factors leading to larger numbers of deaths from several causes, such as exposure to radon, air pollution, and second-hand tobacco smoke\". This leads to the conclusion that we as medical radiological professionals do have the obligation to make every effort to prevent our patients and personnel from harm of the usage or non-usage of radiation. As health specialists, we also should support the fields of prevention with broad mass effects as far as we have the opportunity. And as human beings, we are summoned to do so in respect to other beings, to our environment and to the resources we all share. Radiation protection and quality improvement is just a small part of it all, but it is our field -and 'yes we can'.",

According to the surveys of the EC Tender Project \"PiDRL -European Diagnostic Reference Levels for Paediatric Imaging\" the most frequent Computed Tomography (CT) examinations in children are, in descending order, head/neck, chest and abdomen thus counting for about 75% of all pediatric CT's. Therefore it makes sense to optimize these examinations first. Surveys of the \"International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)\" in 40 countries have shown, there is considerable lack of organizationeg in about 50% of facilities protocols for children were missing, indication based protocols available only in 57%, CTDI values for head and chest two to five times of those for adults. All of these simple facts indicate we are not doing enough for radiation protection in pediatric CT. Actions to lower dose in CT can be categorized in organisational, optimization and alternatives. The interdisciplinary implementation of international guidelines for CT in minor head trauma with trauma surgeons could serve as an example of organisational actions.",

Dose influence on image quality must be known, By exploiting the fact, that, if all CT parameters are kept constant but hte slice thickness is just halve there must be an increase in noisein particular about two times more. Therefore if a standard examination is reconstructed at half slice thickness and image quality is still appropriate the amount of waste radiation is in the range of 100%. Therefore if the next examination will be reduced with eg 20% mAs setting less will be for sure in appropriate quality and the process can be started again. After a couple of examinations the optimal dose will be reached. Thus the \"half slice thickness\" approach is easy to do, does not need special equipment or human resources and will help to find the appropriate dose. The third point is alternatives -Ultrasound and MRI being the candidates in the first row. New, radiation free, techniques like electrical impedance tomography and others are already developed and can be expected to be release soon.",

In the last years, important technological advances and especially, the development of fast heavily T2-weighted sequences has led to an increasing use of prenatal MRI as additional diagnostic imaging method. MRI is increasingly used for evaluation of thoracic pathology, including tumours and vascular malformations as well as anomalies of the diaphragm, the lungs and more recently, even of the foetal heart: -Thoracic tumours and vascular malformations: The diagnosis of a congenital tumor during pregnancy involves a tremendous emotional impact for a family. The most frequently observed thoracic tumours are teratoma, myocardial rhabdomyoma and exceptionally, pleuropulmonary blastomas. MRI may provide relevant additional information concerning the origin of the lesion and its real anatomical extent. -Diaphragmatic pathology: Congenital hernia is by far the most commonly reported foetal diaphragmatic anomaly. The large field of view and the multiplanar possibilities of MRI may help to clarify the position of the herniated organs and to evaluate the severity of lung hypoplasia, considered the most important parameter for predicting outcome. Other rare pathologies include eventration, paralysis and diaphragmatic lung sequestrations. -Lung anomalies: Congenital lung abnormalities are a heterogeneous group of pathologies consisting of isolated bronchopulmonary or vascular anomalies or a combination of both of them. Congenital pulmonary airway malformation, bronchopulmonary sequestration and bronchial atresia are the most often observed pathologies but they present significant overlap imaging findings. MRI allows accurate information concerning the location and extension of the lesion and the volume of the normal and abnormal lung. -Heart pathology: The evaluation of the foetal heart remains extremely difficult because of its small size and high rate of battements. The unpredictable foetal motions during data acquisition and the absence of a foetal ECG signal to synchronize data acquisition are additional problems. In the last years, different approaches have been made to overcome these challenges.",

Fat saturation in one of this plane is recommended and maximal slice thickness of 5 mm is required. Nowadays, non-enhanced then enhanced 3D T1-Fat saturation weighted sequences are mandatory. Slice thickness does not exceed 3 mm. Enhance sequence need to be acquired at the portal phase of injection. However, in recent studies the need for gadolinium has been questioned when DWI is added to the morphologic sequences. DWI sequences have been considered optional (5,6) but we consider their place essential in pediatric practice. They must be done with high b values, from 600 up to 800 in the coronal and axial planes with 5 to 8 mm contiguous cut in free breathing. Axial plane is less prone to artefact than the coronal plane. Interestingly enough Shenoy et al (11) report in 27 pediatric patients that DWI does not perform as well as standard MRE for detection of active Crohn disease but the combination of DWI and MRE increases imaging accuracy for determining disease activity compared with either technique alone. Seo et al (12) in 44 young adults said that DWI MRE was noninferior to contrast-enhanced MRE for the evaluation of inflammation in CD. Based on the exploration of 130 CD adult and pediatric population, DWI proved to be efficient and would avoid gadolinium injection (14) . Sirin et al. (14) report in 37 children that DWI revealed lesions that were not detectable with MRE done with gadolinium injection. Finally, respectively Dubron et al. (15) in 48 children and Neubauer et al (16) in 33 children and young adults demonstrate better performance of DWI than gadolinium enhanced imaging. Like the existing MR protocols for suspected appendicitis (17) it will not be surprising to see fast MR IBD explorations becoming an alternative to emergency US as already proposed (16) . This fast MR limited to a morphologic T2 sequence in two planes associated with DWI sequences will allow a positive diagnosis and the IBD work up. Apart from bowel obstruction and its spontaneous bowel distension one of the limiting factors will be the need for an oral water agent uptake in a potential surgical patient. However, it has been published in the adult literature than an oral or rectal preparation was not necessary to rule out UC (18) nor a CD (19) . The other limiting factor is the length of exploration. MRE can be shorten especially if the patient's positioning is easy to do (dorsal decubitus) (20) and if there is no need for injection, either for spasmolotytic agent and for gadolinium chelates. The suppression of the IV line, the absence of potential side effects (nausea, vomiting) of paralytic agents and the decreased of repeated long apneas with no loss of significant information will be strong progresses toward the Holy Grail.",

            "text": "-Positive diagnosis, disease activity, prognosis and follow-up: MRE has a better accuracy to detect inflammation for the small bowel than for the colon (21) . One of its goal is to try to accurately identify features of active inflammation vs fibrotic disease. This is of paramount importance since the former may respond to medical treatment and the latter may need surgical resection. However, inflammation and fibrosis are associated within the same bowel segment and progress in a parallel way making the goal difficult to reach (22) (23) (24) . In their study based on the analyze of 20 children operated for CD strictures, Barkmeier et al. (24) report than strictures demonstrating >3 cm upstream dilatation with associated feces sign were highly associated with transmural fibrosis. The most severely fibrotic strictures were associated to the greatest amount of inflammation and there was no significant correlation between stricture length, mural thickness, degree of post-contrast enhancement (arterial and delayed venous phases), diffusion-weighted imaging apparent diffusion coefficient, pattern of post-contrast enhancement, or normalized T2-weighted signal intensity and histological fibrosis or inflammation scores. However, correlation with histological specimens of CD done on a other series S312 (2017) 47 (Suppl 2):S297-S Pediatr Radiol demonstrated that the enhancement ratio of the wall is positively correlated with disease chronicity due to a possible increasing microvessels permeability and inversely correlated to acute disease (25). On the other hand, several authors have tried to correlate the ADC values to CD activity. Fibrotic tissue does not restrict diffusion and presents a decrease of signal at high b values and high ADC values whether acute inflammation shows decrease ADC values. Variable thresholds from 1.6 x10 -3 mm 2 /s to 2.4 x10 -3 mm 2 /s have been proposed to separate active vs non active disease (21) . However, others authors have reported low ADC value of fibrosis compare to histology (26). Even if promising results have been published with high correlation with the Crohn Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (13) , ADC measurements are associated with sever limitation factors including sample size overlap between the bowel wall and its atmosphere, lack of reproducibility between MRI-Units and MRI-vendors, non-standardized sequence b-values parameters (21) . Two MRE scores are available to quantify the activity of CD. One is using gadolinium injection (27) and the other DWI (13) . Due to the complexity of the formula, both are difficult to use in daily practice and have not been evaluated in paediatric practice. Interestingly enough if a simplify MRE paediatric protocol appears to become a reality, US stays a good imaging challenger and (28). In a recent meta-analysis, based on adult and pediatric series, Calabrese et al (29) reported that bowel US showed 79.7% sensitivity and 96.7% specificity for the diagnosis of suspected CD, and 89% sensitivity and 94.3% specificity for initial assessment in established patients with CD. Bowel US identified ileal CD with 92.7% sensitivity, 88.2% specificity, and colon CD with 81.8% sensitivity, 95.3% specificity, with lower accuracy for detecting proximal lesions. The absence of abnormal thickness wall would have a negative predictive value, high enough to exclude the need for further exploration, especially when CD is concerned (30,31). Concordance between US and MRE have been variably reported from excellent (32) to just correct (33). Rosembaum and al (22) report that the US findings present in children operated for CD include: bowel wall thickness above 4.3 mm (mean, 6.1 mm) and an increased frequency of loss of mural stratification and fibrofatty proliferation. Others US technologies are used in children to better approach the disease activity. It includes, hydrosonograpy using specific oral agents (Mannitol, Sorbitol, PolyEthylene Glycol, etc\u2026), contrast-enhanced ultrasound and dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (nowadays, contrast agent is offlabel in children) (34) and elastography (35). Their enthusiastic results and their efficiency to assess disease activity need to be confirmed (36).",

            "text": "A single type of situs is present in a patient. When the situs is neither solitus nor inversus, it is referred to as situs ambiguus or heterotaxy. Heterotaxy may manifest with various abnormal visceroatrial configurations that are associated with cardiac (in 90-100% of cases) and extracardiac anomalies such as splenic abnormalities, biliary atresia and intestinal malrotation. Two subsets of situs ambiguus are well-recognized: right isomerism (asplenia) and left isomerism (polysplenia). In heterotaxy, the venoatrial connections are frequently abnormal. Left isomerism is usually indicated by bilateral bilobed lungs, interruption of the IVC and multiple spleens. The more likely found cardiac anomalies are: pulmonary or aortic stenosis, isolated atrial and ventricular septal defects, cardiac arrhythmia due to sinus node dysfunction as well as pulmonary veins that drain into both the right and the left atria. In the presence of right isomerism, bilateral trilobed lungs, a large symmetric liver, and absence of the spleen are frequently observed. At the cardiac level, patients are more likely to have a common atrioventricular defect, a double outlet right ventricle and pulmonary stenosis. Total anomaly of the pulmonary venous return and absence of coronary sinus will always be present in right isomerism. Heterotaxy can be diagnosed with high accuracy by prenatal echography. A diagnosis should be suggested in the presence of congenital heart disease, visceroatrial heterotaxy and interruption of inferior vena cava with azygos continuation for left isomerism or abnormally closed juxtaposition of inferior vena cava and descending aorta in right isomerism. The mortality in fetuses is high in the presence of heart block and hydrops whereas the cardiac anomalies influence the long-term outcome. As discussed in the literature, the clinical outcomes and long-term prognosis in these patients are relatively poor when compared with non-heterotaxy patients. The risk factors are cardiac (underlying anatomy and arrhythmia risk) and non-cardiac. Based on the cardiac anatomy, one of the main determinants is left versus right isomerism. With right isomerism, the cardiac malformation is more severe and an univentricular correction is more frequent. Another predictor of mortality is pulmonary vein stenosis/obstruction. Whatever the severity of cardiac lesions, the postoperative or discharge mortality is higher in patients with heterotaxy. Prenatal diagnosis seems not improve the survival. Extracardiac anomalies also contribute to the increased morbidity and mortality. Three of the more challenging entities are respiratory, immunologic and gastrointestinal. Recurrent respiratory infections, failed extubation or chronic respiratory failure are frequently observed in patients with heterotaxy. Recent studies revealed an association between heterotaxy and primary ciliary dyskinesia which can explain the increased postoperative respiratory complications. The spleen is important for the bacterial clearance. Patients with asplenia or polysplenia are thought to have \"functional asplenia\". So, they are at risk for sepsis and severe bacterial infection. The incidence of intestinal malrotation is high, approximately 40% to 90%. Observation versus prophylactic Ladd procedure and screening for asymptomatic intestinal malrotation are a growing area of debate. The trend seems to go along conservative management and surveillance of malrotation. Bronchopulmonary malformations, such as congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM), bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS), and congenital lobar emphysema (currently known as congenital lobar overinflation [CLO] ), are common congenital lung diseases. These conditions are detected prenatally, usually in the second trimester, in countries where obstetric sonography is routinely performed. The malformations are seen as hyperechoic images with respect to normal fetal lung parenchyma, with a mass effect and homogenous appearance or with coexisting cysts. The lesions usually decrease in size along gestation. A residual mass is seen on postnatal chest radiography, the first imaging technique performed, in only 40% of cases. CPAM and BPS are predominantly located in the posterior lower chest and can be identified postnatally on ultrasound using a small vector probe and a subcostal and subxiphoid approach. Potential feeding arteries can be visualized using color or power Doppler. Based on clinical and sonographic findings, the differential diagnosis between congenital lung malformations and tumors such as neuroblastoma, type I pleuropulmonary blastoma, and myofibroblastic tumor will be discussed. Postnatal management and imaging of newborns with congenital lung malformations is controversial, particularly in asymptomatic patients (approximately 80% of cases). Chest radiography is mandatory at birth and chest ultrasound is also recommended to confirm the prenatal diagnosis. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using angiographic techniques should be performed some months (8 months) after birth in asymptomatic patients. These techniques are also recommended in symptomatic newborns and before surgery to characterize the arterial supply and venous drainage in CPAM and BPS, as ultrasound is limited in this regard. In premature infants, sonography complements radiography in the study of prematurity-related lung diseases such as respiratory distress syndrome and its pulmonary complications (eg, pneumothorax), in predicting bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and in diagnosing transient tachypnea of the newborn when clinical and radiographic features are inconclusive. The main ultrasound finding in these conditions is visualization of numerous \"B-lines\", vertical narrow-based hyperechoic bands extending from the pleural surface to the end of the field of view, representing what is currently known as \"sonographic interstitial syndrome\". B-lines are artifacts originating from variations in the air-fluid relationship of the lung and are better seen using high-frequency linear probes . Use of sonography for follow-up of these patients will reduce the number of the chest plain films performed, and therefore, the amount of radiation exposure in this vulnerable population. For proper interpretation of the sonographic findings in these conditions, the radiologist should be familiar with current related terms, such as lines A, lines B, comet tail artifact, interstitial-alveolar syndrome, septal syndrome, and white lung.

            "text": "Trauma is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in children after the first year of life. Motor vehicle accidents are the leading cause of death from unintentional injury in children up to the age of 15. Of these cases, the abdomen is the fourth most commonly injured area. In pediatric patients non-operative management of these injuries predominate, hence the importance of early radiologic assessment for appropriate clinical follow-up. Anatomically, compared to adults, childrens' abdomens are more square, less muscular and with less intraperitoneal and subcutaneous fat to absorb impact. The diaphragm is more horizontal causing downward displacement of the liver and the spleen outside the protective casement of the ribs. The pelvis is smaller and hence the bladder is displaced upward, also resulting in more vulnerability to this organ. The organ surface area is larger in children and they have a smaller body mass-hence more force applied per-unit of body surface area. The ribs are flexible, and although we see fewer rib fractures, this results in more internal damage. Physiologically, children maintain hemodynamic stability longer, often presenting with only mild tachycardia, even when in severe hemodynamic shock. Decrease in blood pressure may not be evident before the loss of 30% blood volume. Nevertheless, bleeding is less severe and operative intervention is rarely performed. Mechanics of blunt abdominal trauma include organ compression from seat belt injury with the presence of erythema, ecchymossis or abrasion on the abdominal wall increasing the likelihood of internal organ injury (55% likelihood of injury). Other common mechanisms include pedestrian-car collisions( 4% with intra-abdominal injuries), falls (4% with intra-abdominal injuries), or handle bar injuries (54% with intraabdominal injuries). After the child arrives in the hospital, a trauma algorithm is initiated. Generally, for the unstable patient, algorithms are similar and require a rapid ATLS protocol, followed by a FAST ultrasound to confirm free fluid prior to operation. In stable patients, institutional algorithms vary greatly between countries and in different centers. Some rely solely on mechanism to determine the need for FAST vs CT (not complete ultrasound), others will rely on clinical exam (in a conscious patient with reliable exam) and blood work to determine the need for imaging (CT or US) and others may chose to perform an initial US and complete the exam with a constrastenhanced US during work hours. In the literature many management prediction rules exist based on the history, physical examination, mechanism of injury and are supplemented by blood work and/or intial imaging. Most are based on retrospective reviews, with only a few controlled clinical trials. However, the validity of these studies is limited because of different populations, institutional policies and variable radiological practices in terms of when imaging is performed, which modalities are most beneficial and which are less valuable, all the while, considering the utilization of the least irradiating techniques. A representative sample of such algorithms will be discussed. Routine and extensive initial trauma panels are not required according to a number of studies. Abdominal ultrasound and urinalysis together have been found to confirm 98% of all intra-abdominal injures, in some studies. Serial haemoglobins/hematocrit is valuable for determining ongoing S315 (2017) 47 (Suppl 2):S297-S Pediatr Radiol blood loss and assists clinical surveillance. Electrolyte abnormalities are uncommon in children unless severe shock is present (metabolic acidosis). Liver function tests are elevated in most cases of blunt abdominal trauma, hence, are often performed for its high sensitivity, to avoid CT if the liver panel is negative. Imaging, however, is needed for grading of the potential liver injury if the liver panel is positive. Abdominal xray is not useful in blunt abdominal trauma, and is usually normal. Ultrasound has an important role in the pediatric community, as a sensitive and non-irradiating modality. However, this sensitivity is dependent on the type of ultrasound performed (FAST vs. complete abdominal ultrasound vs. contrast-enhanced ultrasound) but also on the qualifications and experience of the performing physician. A meta-analysis of FAST in pediatrics demonstrates that it has a sensitivity of 66% (grade I-II evidence) for identifying hemoperitoneum. A negative FAST is not sufficient to rule out intra-abdominal trauma. One prospective observational trial demonstrasted that 34 % of patients without free fluid on FAST (performed by formally trained pediatric truama surgeons demonstrated at least grade III liver or splenic injuries on CT). We know that pediatric ultrasound is operator-dependent, and generally an ultrasound performed by the skillful hand of a pediatric radiologist is more sensitive than that performed by surgeons or by adult radiologists. Furthermore, we know that the benefits of contrast-enhanced ultrasound in pediatric trauma exist-highly accurate in visualising lesions, hence avoiding non-contributive CT imaging, however, the feasibility of providing 24-hr contrast-enhanced ultrasound by a qualified radiologist is resource intesive: both structurally and with respect to personnel. Published indications for abdominal CT in stable pediatric patients included suspected mechanism of blunt abdominal trauma, significant fluid resusitation without apparant blood loss, hemoglobin <100mg/L without obvious blood loss, multisystem trauma and unreliable abdominal exam. One series with 1500 children undergoing CT for blunt abdominal trauma demonstrate postive findings in 388 (26%), of which all solid organ injuries and 96% of hollow viscus injuries were identified on CT. However, CT has its limitations: it was found to identify gastrointestinal perforation in only 47% of patients with known perforation, but with findings of free fluid, wall thickening and/or bowel dilatation. It is also less accurate in identifying pancreatic trauma, with normal scans in 33-53% of children with pancreatic trauma. Again, findings of pancreatic trauma can be non-specific: free fluid or, less commonly, thickening of the gerota's fascia, presence of mesenteric fluid or of fluid between the pancreas and the superior mesenteric vein. When and where to perform CT depends on the imaging algorithms established by individual centers. Generally, unstable patients with very high grade visceral injuries are taken to surgery. The stable patients are treated with non-operative management. The literature on angiographic embolization in pediatric blunt trauma is limited to case series that demonstrate a limited utility in hemodynamically stable patients with ongoing blood loss or for the definitive treatment of traumatic pseudoanevryms. A dialogue with the interventional radiologist is imperative in such cases. Common imaging findings and pitfalls will be illustrated with case examples. In conclusion, a child's anatomy and physiology must be taken into account when determing the level of urgency and appropriate imaging work-up in blunt abdominal trauma. Imaging of these patients cannot follow a standard algorithm as institutions vary with respect to types of personel, training, frequency of trauma, emergency department trauma protocols and availability of an in-house pediatric radiologist. Ultrasound and CT have their advantages and disadvantages with associated pitfalls that the pediatric radiologist must recognize to provide an optimal diagnostic workup with minium irradiation.",

            "text": "The growing skeleton has unique vulnerabilities to acute and chronic injuries due to sports. The practice of intensive sports during puberty and adolescence has led to a great increase in the incidence of sportsrelated injuries. During the growth spurt of early adolescence, the physis becomes weak, and is the site of fractures and avulsions (particularly in the apophyses) and of physeal widening due to repeated stresses, such as the wrist in gymnasts or the proximal humerus of baseball pitchers. Both lesions can result in growth arrest. The chondro-osseous junctions of the ossifying epiphyses and apophyses are also vulnerable to avulsions, and the avulsed fragment may be entirely cartilaginous and not visible radiographically (such as in the patellar sleeve fracture). Repeated trauma to epiphyses or round bones can lead to osteonecrosis (Panner's disease) but more often to osteochondritis dissecans (OCD). In adolescents, OCD occurs most frequently in the medial femoral condyle, the capitellum of the elbow and the talar dome. Juvenile OCD has a better prognosis than the adult form. When the skeleton begins to mature, there are fractures unique to partially closing physes such as the triplane and Tillaux fracture. Some sturctures have propensity to unique injuries during adolescence. A stress on the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) can lead to a tibial eminence avulsion in puberty ( Figure) , an incomplete ACL tear in early adolescence or a complete ACL tear later. Meniscal tears are almost always vertical and often involve large meniscal fragments that can flip. Patellar dislocations often result in osteochondral injuries. This review will cover the main types of sports-related injuries and the imaging modalities used to diagnose them.",

            "text": "In the absence of a history of significant trauma, fractures highly specific for abuse in pre-ambulatory children include rib, metaphyseal and diaphyseal fractures. Simple linear skull fractures have a relatively low specificity for abuse. The combination of subdural haemorrhage, retinal haemorrhage and diffuse cerebral oedema/encephalopathy (the so-called, \"triad\") suggests shaking. Whereas the presence of a skull fracture implies impact. Visceral injury often results from direct blunt trauma and may therefore be accompanied by anterior and/or costochondral rib fractures. The posterior rib arcs are protected by soft tissue and posterior rib fractures result from compressive/squeezing forces rather than direct trauma. The dating of fractures has a subjective element and it is more important to recognise that fractures are in different stages of healing, rather than to assign a definite age/age range to the injuries. The major differential diagnoses are accidental trauma and osteogenesis imperfecta. If rickets is the cause of the fractures, then radiology and/or biochemistry will show evidence of rickets. A low vitamin D level, in the absence of rachitic features, is not the cause of fractures. Close liaison between radiologists and paediatricians is vital and any siblings/children in the same household who are below 2 years of age should also receive a skeletal survey. Remember that the presence of injury does not always mean abuse and that the absence of injury does not always exclude abuse. Scoliosis may be primitive, structural, particularly during adolescence; during this period, careful follow-up is mandatory, because worsening is frequent. Clinical examination with evaluation of a hump (gibbosity) with a scoliometer is mandatory, with also neurological assessment. Beside radiography, additional tools have been developed to avoid Xray exposure: \"spinal mouse\", back surface topography systems, ultrasound and other computer-assisted systems. But scoliosis can also be secondary, and imaging is important to find a cause and adapt management. Among the etiologies, radiologist must recognize spine malformations, dysplastic and neuromuscular scoliosis. In addition, scoliosis may also be in relation with a primitive lesion, tumor-related or not, whether the initial disease could be within the spinal canal, spinal or paravertebral. Imaging studies lies first on PA and lateral full spine x-rays, if possible with a low dose device (flat panel, slot-scanning system), keeping in mind that follow-up with repetitive exposures may be necessary. Reproducible measures of different curvatures help to assess the overall static spine and the importance of scoliosis with Cobb angle. The assessment of axial rotation can be obtained through 3D simulations, with frontal and axial views (see figure) . Morphologic evaluation of the S317 (2017) 47 (Suppl 2):S297-S Pediatr Radiol spine is mandatory: if a secondary scoliosis is suspected, the research to etiology needs to perform CT or MRI, depending on the clinical signs and the results of plain X rays evaluation.

Rossi; Genoa/IT Summary: Embryology and classification: Spinal cord development occurs through three consecutive periods: (i) gastrulation (2 nd gestational week): the embryonic disk is converted from a bilaminar into a trilaminar arrangement, with formation of the intervening mesoderm; the notochord is laid down along the midline, identifying the craniocaudal embryonic axis; (ii) primary neurulation (18 th -27 th day): under the induction of the notochord, the midline ectoderm specializes into neural ectoderm. The initially flat neural plate progressively bends and folds until it fuses in the midline to form the neural tube. The primary neural tube produces the uppermost 9/10 of spinal cord; (iii) secondary neurulation (28 th -48 th day): a secondary neural tube is laid down caudad to the termination of the primary neural tube. Retrogressive differentiation of the secondary neural tube results in the tip of the conus medullaris and filum terminale. Defects in one of these three embryological steps produce spinal dysraphisms, characterized by anomalous differentiation and fusion of dorsal midline structures. Spinal dysraphisms may be categorized clinically in two subsets: open and closed spinal dysraphisms.",

Lipomas with dural defect are more common; they are differentiated from one another based on the position of the cord-lipoma interface, that lies within the spinal canal in lipomyelocele, and outside the spinal canal (ie, into a meningocele) in lipomyelomeningocele. CSD without tumefaction comprise complex dysraphic states (ranging from complete dorsal enteric fistula to neurenteric cysts, diastematomyelia, dermal sinuses, caudal agenesis, and spinal segmental dysgenesis), bony spina bifida, tight filum terminale, filar and intradural lipomas, and persisting terminal ventricle. The most complicated forms (complex dysraphic states), including diastematomyelia, caudal regression, and segmental spinal dysgenesis) are related to faulty gastrulation.

For radiation safety reasons in the case of children, functional neuroimaging is mostly based on MR techniques especially designed to focus on the assessment of functional tissue characteristics, such as neuronal activity (fMRI),, metabolism (MRS) and perfusion (DSC perfusion, ASL). Pediatric coils with multiple elements, multiple slice excitation, 3D spectroscopy, 3D ASL, reduced FOV (zoom) and improved motion compensation techniques are important tools available to meet the permanent challenges of pediatric MR functional imaging: fast motionless acquisitions and increased resolution. Functional MRI (fMRI) reveals brain activation during performance of behavioral tasks, based on the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) MRI signal, which is modulated by neural activity via a process of neurovascular coupling. For children, especially of younger age unable to follow a task, resting-state fMRI (rfMRI) can be performed and correlates brain areas with similar spontaneous fluctuations in the BOLD signalthereby enabling estimates of 'functional connectivity.' Main clinical applications of fMRI are the delineation of eloquent cortex near a space-occupying lesion and the determination of the \"dominant hemisphere\" for language. Intense research is conducted in the areas of language organization and development, brain plasticity, and neurobehavioral disorders (e.g. ADHD). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a noninvasive MR technique, that detects intracellular metabolites, and may provide neuroimaging biomarkers of normal biological and pathological processes or response to a therapeutic intervention.

Regarding morphological evaluation, multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) serves as the most sensitive and reproducible modality. For functional evaluation perfusion/ventilation scintigraphy remains the reference standard. Although the individual radiation burden by a single chest CT has decreased significantly in the past, radiation doses can cumulate considerably when repeated examinations are performed in a longterm follow-up. Pulmonary MRI exists as an alternative method, especially for paediatric patients. However, standard H+MR sequences do not demonstrate small airway disease due to inherent limitations of low signal and rapid T2* signal decay of lung tissue. For comprehensive diagnosis, functional MRI offers the unique possibility to measure regional ventilation and perfusion, and mapping relaxation times and diffusion. Focussing on research applications, a variety of methods are available for these purposes. In this context, ventilation imaging using inert fluorinated gas indicates to overcome the limitations of the expensive setting necessary for imaging with hyperpolarized noble gasses. Regarding lung perfusion, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) is the most established method in clinical practice. However, especially in children, techniques that are completely non-invasive and do not require i.v.-contrast agents administration or gas inhalation could be promising to achieve broad acceptance.

There are manifestations in the joints of the extremities, and findings in the pelvis, especially in the sacro-iliac joints, and spine. Involvement of the extremities occurs in about 10% of patients with IBD related arthropathies, are more common with Crohn's disease, and can have either manifestations related olygoarticular JIA, or can have symmetrical involvement of smaller joints. The axial manifestations include ankylosing spondylitis and sacro-iliitis. Sacroilliitis is typically bilateral (Figure) and often has radiographic as well as MRI abnormalities. Enthesitis, tenosynovitis and dactylitis can occur with IBD just as they occur with other arthritides. It is important to differentiate IBD related arthritis from septic arthritis due to extension of an enteric fistula. Deceased bone mineral density is a common finding in inflammatory disease. It occurs as a combination of malabsorption of Vitamin D due to intestinal involvement and the effects of therapy, particularly corticosteroids. Insufficiency fractures of the spine, sacrum and extremities can mimic the symptoms of arthritis.

There is also a strong association with human leukocyte antigen B27. JSpA accounts for approximately 10-15% of juveniles arthritis cases in Europe and is the most common form of juvenile arthritis in Asia. The condition is associated with significant long-term morbidity, high health-care costs and poorer outcomes compared with other forms of juvenile arthritis as well as its adult counterpart. Up to 40% of patients continue to be at risk of developing ankylosing spondylitis (AS) during the disease course. Recognizing spondyloarthritis (SpA) in children is challenging, particularly early in the course of disease, as the signs and symptoms at disease onset differ from those seen in adults. JSpA typically presents with hip and lower limb arthritis in conjunction with enthesitis. Inflammatory back pain as a presenting symptom is less common.

In adults, inflammatory back pain typically heralds the onset of sacroiliitis, whereas children seldom present with symptoms of axial disease. However, according to several studies, sacroilitis can be asymptomatic in JSpA and only detectable by imaging. Other axial manifestations in JSpA are inflammation of the lumbar apophyseal joints and interspinous ligaments, corner lesions of the spine and other sites of axial enthesitis-osteitis including the various ligamentous and muscular attachments of the pelvis.

The major goal of imaging in JSpA is to identify children with early signs of axial disease, as this group is at the greatest risk for progression to AS. The presence of axial disease in SpA has also major implications for treatment decisions, since traditional firstline therapies appear to have minimal effectiveness in the management of axial inflammation. In addition, recent studies in adults suggest that earlier initiation of biologic agents (anti-TNFs) may slow radiographic progression. X-rays are not sensitive to acute inflammatory changes and will only show advanced disease in the sacroiliac joints. For these reasons plain radiographs are not useful in children or adolescents. Ultrasound is a non-invasive, non-ionizing and relatively inexpensive technique that can be performed in a clinical setting. It is emerging as a valid diagnostic tool in SpA and can be used to visualize peripheral synovitis, tendonitis and enthesitis, but the method is heavily operator-dependent and there does not yet exist a clear definition for the diagnosis and grading of enthesitis in children. Secondary changes (calcifications, enthesophytes) have been observed much less in children compared with adults. There is a need for better consensus on abnormal ultrasonographic findings that define enthesitis lesions and standardization of methods. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a radiation free and sensitive imaging modality for detection of synovitis as well as cartilage and bone destruction. MRI of the sacroiliac joints is increasingly obtained for early detection of inflammatory changes, as it shows active inflammatory (bone marrow edema, osteitis, enthesitis and capsulitis) and structural (erosions, subchondral sclerosis, subchondral fatty change and bony ankylosis) lesions of sacroiliitis long before radiographic changes become evident. In adults, MRI has become the gold standard imaging modality for detecting arthritis and enthesitis.

The use of contrast enhanced imaging for the detection of active sacroiliitis on MRI in JSpA is a major controversy. Synovial enhancement can be detected without accompanying bone marrow edema in children, and it can be argued that contrast should be administered in order not to miss the diagnosis. Some authors argue that contrast administration does not change or add substantially to the MRI findings made on non-enhanced scans. Certainly, given the risks associated with gadolinium administration, contrast should be used with caution. Perhaps the use of contrast agents should be limited to selected cases when high STIR signal in the joint is the only finding in order to confirm the presence of synovitis, and when the differential diagnosis includes etiologies such as infection or tumor. The development of new MRI techniques has made it possible to perform whole body MRI scans (WBMRI) that allow assessment of the full range of affected entheses and joints. There is limited data on the utility of WBMRI in the pediatric population. It is worth noting that edema-like changes seen in the marrow of healthy children is an important potential pitfall to consider during interpretation and further studies are required in order to establish specific reference standards for MRI of the pediatric skeleton. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) offers a new approach to detect inflammation. Inflammation produces an increase in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of water molecules in affected tissues. Several studies in adults and a few recent studies in children have demonstrated that ADC is elevated in sacroilitis versus controls and that diffusion scores correlates well with STIR images.

            "text": "Juvenile idiopathic arthritis O. Olsen; London/UK Summary: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is common (about 1:1,000 children). Diagnosis and classification are based on clinical criteria. These criteria are in flux depending on 1) contemporaneous knowledge about aetiology and 2) available treatment options. Radiology has currently no role in establishing the diagnosis. The clinical classification rests on whether the child has few joints affected (oligo JIA), many joints (poly JIA), has a condition similar to adult spondyloarthritis (entesitis-related arthritis) or other clinical presentations (systemic-onset JIA, psoriatic JIA, etc). Radiology can potentially assess expressions of JIA, such as synovitis, tenosynovitis, systemic manifestations and permanent damage caused by inflammation. It is therefore thought to play a part in gauging the disease activity. The clinical care aims at optimising the child's everyday function, reducing acute symptoms (pain, swelling, joint restriction), allowing normal growth, minimising long-term sequelae (joint deformity) and minimising adverse effects of medical treatment. Medical treatment in JIA is systemic (immuno-modulation) and local (steroid injection to joints and tendon sheaths). Both modes of therapy may to some degree be guided by imaging. However, there currently is no evidence that any form of whole-body imaging is efficacious for guiding treatment. This means that, in principle, indication for imaging should be 1) specific clinical questions, e.g. uncertainty regarding active inflammation at specific sites, or 2) a high pre-test likelihood of inflammation at a site which is difficult to assess clinically and where imaging offers reasonable accuracy. One example of the latter are the temporo-mandibular joints where destruction is frequently seen at an early stage, often without prior symptomatic warning. There is one fundamental challenge for imaging research in JIA: what is the reference standard? For lack of anything better, a standardised clinical examination is often used as 'ground truth'. The dilemma is obvious. If clinical examination is reliable and accurate, then why bother with imaging? But we think imaging offers an improvement, then we cannot use an inferior method to set the standard. This problem is not unique to JIA. As is often the case, radiology in JIA is all about: knowing your clinicians (i.e. the pretest likelihood for disease) being technically eloquent (e.g. using high-resolution US probes, not delaying post-contrast MRI acquisitions) knowing what is normal (e.g. normal undulations in the articular surface, focal bone marrow signal variation) not being dogmatic about individual observations or measurements interpreting your findings in a clinical context The lecture will demonstrate similarities and differences among joints and modalities in children with variable-severity JIA. The following points will be made: Focal areas in the bone marrow with high signal (T2) and corresponding enhancement are often seen in healthy children. In isolation, these do not signify active inflammation. Active synovitis in children often is not associated with (much) effusion The combination of synovial thickening with hyperaemia (US)/abnormal contrast enhancement (MRI) and surrounding softtissue swelling suggests active inflammation, however there is (yet) no established system for quantifying hyperaemia/enhancement Focal pits in the carpal bones do not represent erosions unless there is an associated cartilage defect Radiographs are useful for detection of destructive abnormality In MRI, scan fairly soon after injecting contrast. Gadolinium physiologically leaks into the synovial fluid making it difficult to delineate the synovium A few differential diagnoses to keep in mind when there is mass-like swelling within or adjacent to a joint: vascular and neoplastic lesion, pigmented villonodular synovitis, synovial chondromatosis, lipoma arborescens. Synovial inflammation is not always primary. Even when there is an established diagnosis of JIA, do consider that it may be secondary to biomechanical abnormality (erosion, osteochondral lesion, deformity).",

            "text": "There are several (benign and malignant) disease processes in children that frequently involve more than one organ system or body region. Diagnostic imaging of children with such multifocal or multisystem diseases has been quite challenging, often requiring a combination of different imaging techniques for a whole body coverage. The recent technical developments in Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Nuclear Medicine (NM) have changed the role of imaging in these children revolutionary. In the past, imaging techniques have been mainly used as a tool to detect the cause of illness and to assess the extent of disease spread before, during and after therapy (i.e. structural imaging). But nowadays, it has also become possible to use imaging techniques to gain information on the biological behavior of diseases before and during therapy (i.e. functional imaging). Plain radiography, Ultrasonography (US) and Computed Tomography (CT) have been the structural imaging techniques of choice for many decades, more recently supplemented by functional imaging techniques like single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET). A major disadvantage of most of these techniques is the use of ionizing radiation, which may be associated with induction of second cancers later during life. This small but not negligible health risk is of particular concern in children as their tissues are more radiosensitive than adults and they have more years ahead in which cancerous changes might occur. That is why there is an increasing interest in the use of alternative imaging techniques that do not use ionizing radiation. With MRI it is nowadays possible to acquire images with a high spatial resolution and excellent soft tissue contrast throughout the body, which makes it an ideal radiation-free tool for the detection of pathology, especially in soft tissue, parenchymal and bone marrow locations. Moreover, recent technological advances have resulted in fast diagnostic sequences for whole-body MR imaging (WB-MRI), including functional techniques such as Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI). As a result, WB-MRI has become a clinically feasible imaging modality for diagnosis and follow-up of multifocal and multisystem diseases in children. In this scope, the recent development of integrated PET/MRI systems is very interesting, combining the superior structural imaging of MRI with the functional (molecular) information of both imaging techniques while decreasing the radiation dose. Traditionally, whole body imaging techniques have been mainly used for oncological indications, such as staging of malignancies, and monitoring of the effectiveness of therapy. However, whole-body imaging techniques are increasingly used for the diagnostic imaging of other benign multisystem diseases and indications, including chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO), rheumatological diseases, neuromuscular diseases, neurofibromatosis type 1, generalized vascular malformations, multifocal osteonecrosis after intensive chemotherapy, fever of unknown origin, and post-mortem imaging. Finally, these imaging techniques may be used for the screening of children with a cancer predisposition syndrome. During this lecture, imaging protocols and indications of the different whole body imaging techniques will be discussed with a focus on their clinical application in children with benign and malignant multifocal or multisystem diseases. (2017) 47 (Suppl 2):S297-S Pediatr Radiol appearances is important for any radiologist involved in child imaging, because we have an important role in characterizing the lesions and guiding purposeful and minimally invasive but successful diagnostic procedures. Most head and neck masses in children are benign and have an inflammatory, infective, vascular or congenital cause (cf. special presentation on vascular malformations). Malignant lesions are less common, however, early diagnosis is paramount as many of these cancers are readily treatable and often curable. Differential diagnosis is guided by patient age, clinical presentation, tumour localisation, and imaging characteristics. While some masses such as (epi-)dermoids, fibromatosis colli and swollen lymph nodes including atypical mycobacterial infections (MOTT) may be readily diagnosed by clinical inspection und ultrasound, others present special diagnostic challenges. Fibromatosis, for example, is a benign lesion with an often complex and potentially destructive local spread. Some malignant lesions tend to be localised such as the embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, while others may be part of a systemic disease such as lymphoma and Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCHC). In case of a suspected malignancy, patients should be referred to a specialized centre which will be able to provide the full spectrum of multidisciplinary evaluation and treatment according to the guidelines of an international oncology study group. This is also important for image guided or surgical biopsies as long term outcome and survival of many of the young patients are directly associated with these initial diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. With its excellent spatial resolution in the near field, ultrasound is the method of choice for all superficial masses. An experienced paediatric radiologist will be able to identify most of the benign lesions and in other cases will be able to guide further diagnostic decisions. Tumours in the midline require thorough workup to exclude an encephalocele or a dermal sinus with connection to the intracranial space. High resolution MRI is required if such an extension cannot be ruled out by ultrasound or if a tumour is larger than the transducer's scan area. Soft tissue tumours in the deeper parts of face and neck as well as tumours of osseous origin are also best delineated by MRI. In lesions adjacent to the skull base contrast enhanced and fat saturated MR images with high spatial resolution are of utmost importance to completely depict the tumour's extension through the foramina and along the meninges (Fig. 1) . CT can provide additional information on the involvement of osseous structures.",

            "text": "Skull base and face lesions are less frequent in children than in adults. Symptoms may be subtle or unspecific. Depending on their localization, clinical findings may be common (nasal obstruction, otitis\u2026) or more disturbing (cranial nerves palsies, exophthalmos, vision loss \u2026). Clinical history and physical examination findings are important to reduce the spectrum of differential diagnosis, but imaging data are the key features to determine the nature of these lesions. CT and MRI play an important role in diagnosis, treatment survey and surgery planning of skull base and face lesions. Skull base and face bone lesions are either intrinsic lesions of the bone or secondary to soft-tissue tumors or pseudo tumors invasion. This lecture will focus on bone intrinsic lesions, and include soft-tissue and pseudo tumors only as differential diagnoses. Computed tomography plays the role for skull base and face of plain radiograph for long bones. Therefore, the same semiology may be used to determine if the lesion is slowly or rapidly growing, aggressive or looks benign. Helical CT allows reconstructions with both soft-tissue and bone algorithms as well as multiplanar reformations. It gives a good visualization of the anatomy of the skull base and allows a good depiction of the bone architecture. CT is first used for the initial work up of the disease but also for surgery and therapeutic planning (endoscopic sinus surgery with navigation). However, CT analysis may be challenging in children due to growth changes: normal process of pneumatization according to age, sutures not yet fused has to be recognized. Some variations in pneumatization must not be mistaken for pathology: asymmetrical pneumatization of the petrous apex and arrested pneumatization of the sphenoid mimicking intraosseous lesion are the most common. Both CT and MR imaging are complementary: most preferably, contrast-enhanced MR is associated with non-contrast high resolution CT. MRI allows a good delineation of bone involvement of skull base lesion due to bone marrow changes, whether CT can fail to detect subtle extension within the bone. In addition to T1 and T2 weighted sequences, the use of specific sequences and/or techniques such as fat-saturation, diffusion, dynamic-contrast-enhanced sequences, and MR angiography helps to characterize the lesions. T1 spin echo sequence is mandatory to appreciate bone marrow infiltration in adults and older children. But when red bone marrow has not yet be replaced by fatty bone marrow, in young children, this can be challenging. It is useful to know the bone marrow fatty conversion of the skull base chronology. Cranial MR can also be associated to whole body MR to look for multifocal or metastatic disease. Epidemiologic data concerning bone tumors of the skull base are scarce due the rarity of these lesions. They can be classified according to their location within anterior, middle or posterior cranial fossa or classified according to their origin: osteogenic (osteoblastoma, osteoma, osteosarcoma...), chondrogenic (chondroma, chondrosarcoma), fibrous ( fibrous dysplasia, fibro-S323 (2017) 47 (Suppl 2):S297-S Pediatr Radiol osseous lesions..), notochord (chordoma), hematopoietic (leukemia, histiocytosis ), vascular (hemangioma), neuro ectodermic ( Ewing sarcoma) or unknown origin (aneurysmal cyst, giant cell tumor). The aim of this presentation is to draw attention to skull base growth changes that can mimic pathology and to describe the imaging specificities of the most common bone tumors of the skull base and face in children. Because conflicted nomenclature can cause confusion, accurate diagnosis and classification of these anomalies is important for proper clinical evaluation and management. Many of these patients require multidisciplinary care, consequently the usage of a correct nomenclature across all disciplines is a sine qua non. The International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) classification, updated in 2014, offers a comprehensive classification accepted by many subspecialities. This approach/ classification has facilitated correct communication for all medical subspecialties involved in the care of these complex vascular anomalies. Pediatric radiologists play a critical role in evaluating these patients since the majority present during childhood. In this presentation, we present a state of the art MRI imaging protocol with exemplary cases of the most common types of vascular anomalies in the pediatric trunk and extremities, using the current ISSVA classification. In addition, we discuss the common syndromes associated with vascular anomalies such as Klippel-Trenaunay and LUMBAR syndrome. ",

A large sub-group of GSD's may have additional involvement of other structures/organs beside the skeleton, such as the central nervous system (CNS). CNS abnormalities have an important role in long-term prognosis of children with GSD's and should consequently not be missed. Sensitive and specific identification of CNS lesions while evaluating a child with a GSD requires a detailed knowledge of the possible associated CNS abnormalities. Here, we will present and discuss a pattern-recognition approach for identifying relevant neuroimaging findings in GSD's guided by the obvious skeletal manifestations of GSD. In particular, we will discuss which CNS findings should be ruled out for the various GSD. To facilitate this diagnostic approach the multiple GSD are classified based on the pattern of skeletal involvement (1. abnormal metaphysis or epiphysis, 2) abnormal size/number of bones, 3) abnormal shape of bones and joints, and 4) abnormal dynamic or structural changes). Skeletal involvement is defined in accordance with Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man. The spectrum of co-existing CNS involvement is extracted from an extensive literature search. Selected examples will be shown based on prevalence of the diseases and significance of the CNS involvement. CNS involvement is common in GSD's. A wide spectrum of morphological abnormalities is associated with GSD's. Early diagnosis of CNS involvement is important in the management of children with GSD's. This pattern-recognition approach aims to assist and guide physicians in the diagnostic work-up of CNS involvement in children with GSD's and their management. ",

            "text": "Not infrequently the correct radiological differentiation of skeletal and/or central nervous system findings secondary to non-accidental injury versus inherited genetic and/or metabolic disorders may be challenging. Imaging findings may be non-specific, can result in incorrect diagnosis and subsequently inadequate patient management or initiation of faulty treatment. The diagnostic work-up of children suspected of non-accidental injury or genetic/metabolic disorders requires a multi-disciplinary approach involving many key players including physicans of various disciplines, nurses, psychologists, social workers and many more. A proper and detailed medical history and physical examination of the patient, collection of the relevant family history, a metabolic and genetic work up, a detailed interview of care givers, friends and family are essential for the correct and comprehensive evaluation of imaging findings. In the current session, various exemplary and possibly confusing cases will be interactively discussed with the audience by a panel of experts (Susan Blaser, Thierry A.G.M. Huisman and Andrea Superti-Furga). Goal is to offer a case based approach to challenging patients with discussion of the best diagnostic approach including differential considerations. The ZIKV is transmitted mainly by the bite of female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Other forms of transmission, including through sexual intercourse, blood transfusion, and neonatal, are currently under evaluation, although more elements are still needed to assess the real importance of these transmission routes 4 . The course of the ZIKV infection is self-limited. So far, no specific symptoms have been attributed to the disease, and a wide variety of manifestations ranging from absent to mild symptoms (in 25% of cases) have been described. When symptoms are present, they may lead to a misdiagnosis of other bacterial and viral infections, especially other arboviroses in endemic areas. The most frequently reported symptoms are mild fever, cutaneous rash, fatigue, arthralgia/myalgia, and conjunctivitis. Dizziness, malaise, edema of the extremities, anorexia, retro orbital pain, photophobia, gastrointestinal disorders, sore throat, cough, sweating, and lymphadenopathy have also been reported. Infection by the ZIKV in adults may be associated with autoimmune complications such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome 9 . The laboratory diagnosis of ZIKV infection is based on the demonstration of the virus in the urine and blood using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The main limitation of this diagnostic method is a false-negative result after the viremia is resolved. The serological diagnosis of the disease is limited due to cross-reactivity of the ZIKV with other viruses of the Flavivirus genus, especially those causing dengue and chikungunya. Physicians should be aware of this fact when the diagnosis of ZIKV infection relies solely on serological results. The diagnosis is also possible by IgM measurement in serum, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 9 . The prevention against ZIKV infection is similar to that of other arboviroses, including vector control and mosquito bite prevention. The first major ZIKV epidemics were reported in the French Polynesia in 2013 and 2015. At that time, some neurological changes were observed in neonates of infected pregnant women but were not associated with a maternal-fetal transmission of the virus. The growing increase in the number of cases and the severity of the infection specific to this subpopulation then led to the evidence of a congenital disease 9 . In Brazil, the situation became alarming with the report of a high number of infected individuals in the second half of 2015 2, 5 . The Brazilian Ministry of Health attributed to congenital ZIKV infection the 20-fold increase in cases of neonatal microcephaly in the northeastern part of the country, particularly in the state of Pernambuco. This led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the ZIKV infection a \"public health emergency of international concern\" in February 2016 6 . The main challenge for radiologists practicing in regions of endemic ZIKV infection is to become familiarized with findings of congenital ZIKV infection in perinatal imaging studies; this is particularly important for the prenatal screening of pregnant women 3, 6 . The diagnosis of ZIKV infection in the fetus by neuroimaging is based on prenatal ultrasound (US), especially in the third trimester, and complemented with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Postnatal imaging was obtained by transfontanellar US, CT or MRI. The main imaging findings on CT are microcephaly, an exuberant external occipital protuberance, rectification of the frontonasal angle, and a redundant scalp skin. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of al skull permits a better evaluation of these findings and enhances the parents' understanding of the disease. Moreover, CT scan data may yield a 3D virtual physical model that can maybe obtained from CT scan data and printed onto using thermoplastic acrylonitrile butadiene styrene 7 .",

            "text": "Early insights into Zika's Microcephaly physiopathology, from the epicenter of the outbreak: a case for teratogenic apoptosis of central nervous system. In mid-October 2015, intense interaction among surgical pathology and fetal medicine specialists from University of Pernambuco was only focused on the dramatic and non explained Ultrasonographic (US) findings and hopelessness due to lack of explanations on the odd US discoveries on the first gestational cases of Zika's microcephaly. This is the field of our history of a physiopathological hypothesis on Zika virus (ZIKV) related microcephaly when it first struck Pernambuco state (PE), Northeast Brazil, the place that has been at the front line of the global response to the microcephaly and responsible for a large amount of data from affected children. The outbreak onset came with a sudden increase in microcephalic newborns being reported in PE state from August 2015 (Panel, Fig. 1) . ZIKV was previously thought to cause a relatively mild disease, but was recently accepted to lead to severe and diverse neurologic conditions in S329 (2017) 47 (Suppl 2):S297-S Pediatr Radiol some children born from infected mothers and in adults 1 . The scientific community is actively trying to uncover the extent of these disorders but little has been reported on the early days of the outbreak when doctors were approaching the unknown. While evidence that ZIKV is related to microcephaly in newborns is accumulating, the mechanisms of how the virus affects the fetus is still uncertain. In the outbreak onset we had to face daunting challenges to search the cause of microcephaly and the emotional toll on the families. We took a very early approach from 9 microcephalic fetuses on gestation and 46 microcephalic babies on clinical follow-up from different PE areas, evaluated between 15 October and 17 December 2015 in Oswaldo Cruz Hospital, to propose the early physiopathologic hypothesis that, a viral-related brain developmental disruption could be the basic neuropathogenesis in ZIKV babies instead of a direct injurious process due to viral insult followed by active inflammation. The eight pregnant women were all in the 3 rd gestational trimester and had had normal US follow-ups till week 20 th . Crucially, we were facing a temporal-geographic association of cases presenting an unanticipated pattern of US alterations. Because of their late alarming findings they were re-examined and the US scans revealed sudden encephalic alterations after 28 th gestational week. Such devastating US clustering images were not seen here before, but are now considered as part of the \"congenital ZIKA syndrome\". We observed late appearing severe dysmorphic encephalic changes in 9 out of 9 fetuses, including small skull, small brain, sub arachnoidal space enlargement, ventricular dilation, brain calcifications of varied shape and distribution, inclined frontal bone, progressive decline of head growth potential, early fontanels closure and redundant scalp (Panel, Figs. 2A, 2B). We had no clues on the causes and mechanisms responsible for this phenotype of severe alterations. Thus, we had no explanation to offer to patients, in particular, or to the medical community. Both as physicians and human beings, we were committed straightaway to continue the study of these victims of an unknown medical tragedy, engaging our expertise in fetal imaging and immunopathology. From beginning October, the first microcephalic babies were referred to the UPE Pediatric Infectology Service for initial investigation. Strikingly, the newborns exhibited \"healthy\" appearance, excluded the microcephaly itself and motor sequels. We then looked for CSF analysis of the microcephalic babies. For that, we obtained from Dr. Patricia Travassos, a CSF specialist at UPE, a cohort of 120 CSF samples that have been studied for signs of meningitis or encephalitis. About 87% (42 cases) of the CSF analyzed looked normal for any signs of central nervous system ongoing inflammatory responses (Panel, Fig. 3 ). The babies had been examined by outpatient clinic Dr Angela Rocha, from the UPE Hospital Infectology Reference Center that have stated that although small, the babies were near to full term gestation (36-39 weeks gestation), had good Apgar scores and variable degrees of microcephaly and neurologic impairments, i.e. contractures, spasms, irritability and in some retinal macular atrophy. During the follow-up, the babies were cared at home, breastfeeding, gaining weight and having routine vaccines. None of them expressed signs of ongoing inflammatory reaction in the CNS (Panel, Fig. 4 ) or alterations on peripheral blood count and other routine laboratory tests up to 3 months of age. Despite the striking neurological phenotype, 80% of the babies were negative for TORCH agents, no deaths were recorded. Furthermore only in January 2016, the first evidence associating ZIKV to microcephaly from RT-PCR test on amniotic fluid was reported 2 . Astonishingly, a particular kind of physiopathological process linked to fetal brain development was arising without clinical manifestation of inflammatory reactions or necrotic processes in these babies. Unfortunately, no necroscopic samples of affected brain tissues were available to us to monitor the presence of putative neural dysgenesis and the very nature of brain calcifications background offering histological support for our hypothesis. Nevertheless, with this restricted dataset we hypothesized that whatever the etiologic agent involved in these cases, its physiopathologic mechanism must trigger the cellular death programthe apoptotic process -at a particular development window on the CNS, assuming clinically that the agent was not encephaalitogenic but silently tertogenic. If not, the clinical outcome of affected babies would not be so mild as far as signs of inflammation on CNS was concerned. Consequently, the inflammation-free clinical status of patients suggested us that a massive enhanced apoptotic cell death during the window of telencephalic expansion was the most probable physiopathologic process operating this microcephaly phenotype, with no direct direct lytic brain lesion or significant necrosis due to usual injury. Furthermore, Knowles and Penn 3 stated that this window is very active to select the \"fittest\" neural cells by a constitutive apoptotic pathway. We so hypothetized that during this developmental time window, the \"fit or not fit\" status of the rapid, transient amplifying neural progenitors cells facing ZIKV, would heavily shift the selective process toward the self-elimination of virusbearing cells through apoptotic pathways. Thus, ZIKV-enhanced constitutive apoptotic mechanisms would lead a massive loss of developing telencephalic neuronal precursors and, consequently, provoking losses of dividing cells and the arrest of further brain development. This could be particularly inferred by the absence of the characteristic morphology of late stages structures of neocortex, according with our US images of ZIKV microcephalics in gestation. Similar processo could also be inferred to neurocrest derivatives as deformities in the viscercrany always accompany the cephalic malformation. Our initial understandings based on clinical examination on the field, when no specific laboratory test, necroscopic data or experimental evidence on the disease causality were available, conducted our physiopathological approach to the \"Apoptosis Hypothesis\" for Zika microcephaly that is now gaining strong support. In February, Mlarkar et al 4 showed clear connection between ZIKV and microcephaly, presenting CNS histopathologic analyses, revealing remnants of neural germinative matrix, intense gliosis, alterations in cortical ribbon, calcifications in gray and white matters without associated necrosis, encephalitis or meningitis and the presence of the virus, further supporting neurodevelopmental arrest. Similar results were showed by Driggers et al 5 . The CT scans from microcephalic babies from Hazin at al 6 , have added details of brain development arrest with no radiological signs of brain destruction or active inflammation. Finally, experimental models have provided a body of evidence f or neuroprogenitors permissiveness to ZIKV and viralinduced apoptotic process. Tang et al 7 demonstrated by ICQ that the ZIKV infection of cortical neural progenitors attenuates their growth and increases Caspase-3 activation, calling for an apoptotic process. This finding was corroborated by the up regulations of Caspase-3 genes by RNA sequencing. Nowakowsky et al 8 demonstrated that ZIKV may hijack AXL protein as an entryway to infection. Interestingly, AXL is highly abundant on the surface of neural stem cells but not on differentiated neurons in the developing brain. Recently, Cugola et al 9 demonstrated that ZIKV was able to cause CNS congenital brain dysgenesis upon vertical transmission in mice. In parallel, human brain organoids infected by ZIKV show a reduction of proliferative zones and disrupted cortical layers, so targeting cortical progenitors and inducing apoptotic cell death with impaired development. For babies born with ZIKV-related microcephaly, the many expected consequences besides the evolving congenital neurosequels, are the unanticipated pattern of persistence of ZIKV in CNS host cells, unsafe maintenance of neuron genome stability on remaining arrested populations, implying risks for brain tumors, risks for impaired adult type neuron wiring and neuron survival in an affected neuronal circuitry. In brief, evolve life with a wide vulnerable brain. The outbreak of ZIKV in the Americas will eventually decline as herd immunity increases, but the world remains at risk of further waves of infection in affected countries and spread into new territories 1 . While experimental studies will be carried out to fully understand the pathophysiology of ZIKV infection in the developing fetus, our findings provide a coherent and testable physiopathological hypothesis for CNS teratogenic phenotype linked to ZIKV congenital infection, which may be critical for the clinical care of pregnant mothers and their babies before and after birth. Take home points: Fetal dysmorphisms detected by ultrassonographic and MRI images in Congenital Zika Syndrome are late findings, usually after the 20 th gestational week and requires acurate analyses. Clinically, Zika's Virus Microcephaly is an infectiuos congenital condition that is not encephalitogenic but primarily teratogenic on the Nervous System. The most important process leading to Zika's Virus Microcephaly is pathologically induced apoptosis in telencephalic neuroprecursosrs cells and neurocrest precurssors cells. Viral induced autophagy and low antiviral responses during the fetal period are linked to Zika virus persistence in the central nervous system of affected new borns and babies",

This may be functional or anatomical as a result of a dysfunctional valve or absent or ineffective pumping chamber. The repair of single ventricle physiology most often involves a staged reconstruction due to changing physiology ultimately resulting in a total cavopulomonary connection or Fontan procedure. To appropriately image the single ventricle throughout its stages of palliation, familiarity with the physiology of the various steps in surgical palliation of the single ventricle is essential Although echocardiography is a mainstay of cardiac imaging, cross sectional imaging has a vital role in the evaluation of the single ventricle. The role of CT angiography is mostly for anatomic evaluation. Although it is fast and has high spatial resolution for evaluation of vasculature, CT has lower temporal resolution than MRI and is unable to quantify flow. Ventricular performance along with quantification of flow can be performed with MRI. Systemic to pulmonary collateral flow, which has been shown to result in adverse outcomes after Fontan, can be quantified. Valvular insufficiency and myocardial scarring can also be assessed. Additionally, high anatomic vascular detail can be obtained with MRI, particularly with the recent investigational use of the blood pool agent ferumoxytol. MRI also has the ability to assess the lymphatics either through non-contrast T2 weighted imaging and/or dynamic contrast MR lymphangiography as lymphatic pathology may play a role in postsurgical hemodynamics in single ventricle patients. This lecture will focus on the use of CT and MRI in the evaluation of the single ventricle particularly concentrating on the developing use of MRI for anatomic and physiologic assessment.

Alexiou; Ioannina/GR Summary: Objective: Head trauma in children is one of the most common reasons for visiting emergency department. However, only a small portion of patients will have a traumatic brain injury. Patients with moderate or severe head trauma should undergo CT scan, however, a debate exists for the indication and yield of neuroimaging for minor head trauma. We performed a systematic literature review on the accuracy of symptoms and signs in children with minor head trauma in order to identify those with severe intracranial injuries. Materials: A systematic literature search of MEDLINE (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) (2016) was performed to identify studies assessing the diagnosis of intracranial injuries in children. The authors independently performed critical appraisal and data extraction. Results: We identified studies that evaluated the performance of findings for detecting intracranial injury using the reference standard of neuroimaging or follow-up examination. Mechanism of injury, multiple vomiting episodes and decline in GCS score were more commonly associated with severe intracranial injury on CT. ",

Rosendahl; Bergen/NO Summary: Age assessment is an important, yet complex and challenging issue that authorities may need to perform to determine whether an individual is an adult or a child in circumstances where their age is unknown. There is currently no method which can identify the exact age of an individual and there are concerns about the invasiveness and accuracy of the methods in use, namely analysis of documentary evidence, interviews, physical or other form of medical examination such as imaging. The main imaging methods include carpal, collar bone and dental examinations. Whilst many countries make use of these methods they do not apply them in the same way and often use different combinations and/or order. One of the main reasons for this is the fact that age assessment procedures remain to a large extent determined by national legislation, with procedures evolving through national jurisprudence (Ref.: European Asylum Support Office (EASO Age Assessment Practice in Europe)). The ethical and legal aspects of using bone age to determine age will be addressed in a statement from the MSK task force.",

Granata 2 ; 1 Graz/AT, 2 Genova/IT Summary: Several countries have released \"Diagnostic Reference Levels (DRL)\" for imaging procedures using ionizing radiation. Unfortunately those DRL differ in types of procedures and granularity as well as information about the proportion of pediatric patients within the different examinations are sparse. Therefore an more evidence based approach seems to be feasable -meaning releasing DRL first for frequent and radiation burdened examinations. Therefore a survey within Europe was conducted and a questionnaire was sent to key persons of the European Society of Pediatric Radiology (www.espr.org) as well to members of a large academic, interdisciplinary, international Network within the CEEPUS programme (Central European Exchange Programm for University Studieswww.ceepus.info). Alltogether 33 centers were contacted and an response was received from 18 (54.5.%). From one center only frequencies for Interventional Radiology was sent. Plain films: most frequent procedures are extremities (48.5%), followed by chest films (31.4%) -both account together for more than \u00be. Flouroscopy: voding cysto urethrography (VCU) 37.2%, followed by upper gastro intestinal (GI) series with 32.1% -again representing 2/3 of those examinations. Computed Tomography: head & neck 46.8%, chest 27.8%, abdomen 13.7% -together almost 90%. Interventional Radiology and cardiac interventions: only limited data available and procedures quite hardly standardize and comparable. It seems adviseable, that only a few procedures are suitable for DRL like peripheral insertion of vascular lines, occlusion of Ductus Arteriosus botalli or stent implantation for coarctation. In order to estimate the contribution to the relative collective dose all values were normalized to a chest xrays (1.0) and the following numbers could be calculated: abdominal plain film 0.1, skull 0.01, CT Head 2.6, CT chest 10.2, CT Abdomen 4.5.",

From many points of view, children represent an ideal population for CEUS, because of the absence of radiation exposure and of need of sedation. Moreover, due to the small body size many anatomical targets in children can be adequately explored with high-frequency ultrasound, obtaining images with higher spatial resolution than in adults. However, to date comparatively few data on pediatric CEUS are available. Although very rare and usually mild, possible adverse effects of contrast agents probably limit their use in many centers. In addition, the intravenous administration of ultrasound contrast agents in children is still off-label in Europe, which makes informed consent necessary in every case. Finally, for unclear reasons information on this topic does not flow easily. & From the comparison between the data available, similar or better results are likely to be obtained with CEUS in children than in adults, and some specific pediatric indications might be proposed.",

The Delphi process is constructed as follow: step 1 questionnaire construction to includes all contents relevant to the guideline and set up of working groups; step 2 questionnaire completed by all committee member, step 3 literature search; step 4 draft consensus produced by each WG based on the literature review and questionnaire responses; step 5 committee members indicate agreement or otherwise for each individual draft consensus; step 6 acceptance of agreed statements (more than 80% of members), face to face meeting to modify statements without agreement. Committee members indicate agreement or otherwise for each modified consensus statement and final consensus statements. The questionnaire was split into four broad topics, each of them treated by a subgroup including in each of them a pediatric radiologist: (1) patient preparation for MRE/MR enteroclysis/CTE/CT enteroclysis, (2) MRE/ MR enteroclysis technique and sequence selection, (3) CTE/CT enteroclysis technique, and (4) enteric US patient preparation and technique. After an extensive literature research each member were instructed to always base their statements on the retrieved literature wherever possible, and to this end graded the strength of retrieved relevant publications from I (high) to V (low) using the criteria of the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine (2) during their review process.

A methodical and systematic analysis is crucial to facilitate a thorough evaluation of the bowel segments as complete as possible: follow bowel in a cross section, complete by longitudinal and oblique views. For some bowel sections filling is essentialsuch as stomach for gastroesophageal reflux and pyloric function, and distensibility and size of the colon by enema (e.g. for query microcolon). Modern US methods are valuable, but not a pre-requisite.

They evolved more than seven million years ago in Africa and managed to spread over the entire globe. In this talk, I will trace the history of our species with an emphasis on key developmental innovations that underlie major evolutionary innovations. Why are we born with brains that have the size of adult great ape brains? And why do we grow up so slowly and get so old? I will highlight how advanced biomedical imaging methods help addressing these questions, and show how combined fossil, clinical and great ape data yield surprising insights into the evolution of our development. To present our experience with innovative imaging in pediatric interventional radiology. Imaging technologies presented will include: 1. Use of bubble contrast (Lumeson) for indicatons including; complex pleural effusion and abdominal collection assessment pre and post therapy, primary G tube placement, renal perfusion pre and post rena artery angioplasty, vascular patency during central venous line placement, vascular malformation therapy and biliary tube assessment. 2. Intravascular US (IVUS) in arterial intervention pre and post angioplasty and venous thrombolysis intervention. 3. Optical Coherence Tomography pilot study assesssment for renal artery intervention -validation in normal subjects. Currently this imagng which uses laser light technology to assess vascular mural detail at the micron level, is only validated in coronary artery intervention in adults. 4. MR Overlay -a technology that fuses MR imaging with low dose fluoroscopy and can faciltate biopsy of MR positive/CT negative lesions in the IR suite. Focus will be on bone lesion biopsy and vascular malformation therapy. Critical structures to be avoided can be outlined on the MR and transposed onto the fluoroscopic image during biopsy. In our experience this technology has promise in the pediatric setting with significant dose reduction when compared to CT. 5. MR fusion and I guide fusion technology enables an MR positive/CT negative lesion that would require CT guided imaging to be biopsed, using low dose C -arm CT, with fusion of the CT and MRI images performed using landmarks, facilitating fluoroscopically guided biopsy in the IR suite. Critical landmarks/structures to be avoided can be outlined on the CT or MR and transposed onto the fluoroscopic image during biopsy path planning and orchestration. Focus will be on bone lesion biopsy. 6. Color parametric flow related imaging in vascular interventionthis software enables time to peak opacification of arterial or venous contrast to be color coded in time and can provide adjunctive information for assessent of perfusion change during vascular intervention such as renal artery angioplasty, dialysis access intervention and cerebral embolization. 7. MR guided intervention -this focus will be on the initial development of an MR interventional program and our initial experience with MR arthrography. Discussion will also involve the use of this modality for vascular malformation sclerotherapy and other MSK interventions such as biopsy and nerve injections. 8. High frequency US imaging-focus will be on the use of a 40mHz US probe in the IR suite for various indications including visualization of smaller targets such as neonatal central venous access, superficial vascular malformation therapy and thyroid fine needle biopsy. 1.

This, and related timing anomalies, have been proposed as biomarkers for ASD -with candidate use for diagnosis, prognosis, stratification and therapy monitoring. Progress along each of these axes will be discussed. However, to justify the term \"biomarker\", we demonstrate converging evidence from spectrally-edited (MEGAPRESS) MRS and diffusion-MRI. MRS offers insights into neurotransmitter levels, especially GABA and glutamate, imbalance of which may be associated with anomalous electrophysiologic oscillations in the gamma band. Diffusion offers insights into the white matter of the brain (auditory pathway will be illustrated) and an interpretation of diffusion parameters as an index of central conduction velocity will be offered. Combining these mechanistic measures with the spectrospatio-temporal capabilities of magnetoencephalography (MEG), this talk will present a state of the art review of multimodal biomarker development in ASD.",

Heran; Vancouver/CA Summary: The pediatric patient presents unique challenges in diagnosis and management of oncologic disorders. Interventional Radiology (IR) has a prominent role in the care of these children, with improvements in imaging and equipment offering better and safer options to traditional diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. As cancer can involve any organ system, consultations to the IR service can involve any part of the body, and can be non-vascular and vascular, simple and complex. The most common IR procedures in the pediatric oncology patient are enteric tube placement/change, vascular access, and percutaneous image-guided tissue/organ biopsy. However, with the explosion of Interventional Oncology in the adult setting, the variety and complexity of IR in pediatric oncology has begun to increase as well. IR techniques, such as thermal ablation, transarterial pharmacotherapy, and preoperative embolization, are now increasingly discussed in multi-disciplinary conferences as complementary or primary modes of treatment of oncologic disorders or related diseases/complications. However, although the principles of these diagnostic and therapeutic IR procedures remain essentially the same in their translation from adults to children, well recognized differences in pediatric physiology and metabolism, as well as the range in weight, size, and age of children, result in a practical question of \"how do we do this?\" The aim of this presentation is to provide an overview of the role of IR in the pediatric oncology patient, and to highlight areas of research and innovation.

In children, a diagnosis can often be made with the history, examination and ultrasound. The classification of vascular anomalies will be briefly reviewed with examples of commonly encountered pathologies. A multidisciplinary team approach to the management of these conditions is vital. Paediatric radiologists can play a key role not only in diagnosis but also in management, principally by injection sclerotherapy of low flow lesions and embolization of the much rarer arteriovenous malformation. Many sclerotherapy agents are available with sodium tetradecyl sulphate the most commonly used for venous malformations and doxycycline for lymphatic malformations. Different sclerotherapy agents have different characteristics and uses which will be covered. Symptomatic relief is often achieved with treatment but multiple treatment episodes may be needed to achieve the desired outcome.

CT can rule out haemorrhage or calcifications, but can also be used to evaluate tumour cellularity. A hyperdense tumour on CT reflects hypercellularity and is very often high grade. Medulloblastoma are, for example, typically hyperdense on CT scans and paediatric low-grade astrocytomas are almost always hypodense. MRI plays a major role in the evaluation of brain tumours. In conventional MRI, the \"general aspect\" is the single most important parameter in predicting high-grade tumours in children. The same does not hold true for low-grade tumours, of which only 67% can be predicted using the general aspect. In our previous study, hyperintensity on T2-w and the lack of diffusion changes were the most important single parameters with 83% positive prediction. Embryonic tumours, such as medulloblastoma or PNET have high tumour cellularity with consequent very low ADC and hypo/isointense T2 compared to the cortex. ADC values derived from DWI have been shown to be decrease in highly cellular tumours. ADC values cannot reliably be used in individual cases due to the substantial overlap between tumour types previously described in the literature. Nevertheless, ADC has a higher predictive value in children and increases the accuracy of preoperative differentiation between low grade and high grade paediatric tumours. The cut-off values for differentiating between low and high grade paediatric brain tumours are 0.7 x 10 3 mm 2 /s and 1.0 x 10 3 mm 2 /s for minimum ADC and average ADC values, respectively. Perfusion with relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) is considered a marker of angiogenesis and is helpful in distinguishing high and low grade tumours. However, perfusion can be difficult to perform in small children; small catheters with manual injection are therefore used in such cases (or, as an alternative, arterial labelling). It should however be taken into account that choroid plexus tumours can have high rCBVs resulting from highly leaky capillaries.",

MRS is helpful not only as guidance for stereotactic biopsy (Cho Hot Spot) but also for determining whether the tumour is high or low grade. As a rule of thumb, a 200% increase of Cho when compared to the contralateral brain tissue is highly suggestive of a high-grade tumour. However, in children, increased Cho levels can also be found in pilocytic astrocytoma; in this case the typical aspect with cystic component and location can suggest the diagnosis, despite the MRS result. Therefore, in children, high Cho levels do not necessarily imply the presence of a malignant tumour. Task based functional MRI (fMRI) can be used for pre-operative localization of the eloquent cortex together with the identification of the language and somatomotor function.

MRI of the abdomen is often performed to further delineate the tumor and its surroundings. The addition of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to the standard MRI protocol may enable subtype characterisation and allows assessing treatment response beyond necrosis and volume change. Overall, the survival rate in patients with nephroblastoma is relatively good and the current focus is on finding biomarkers to further improve outcomes while reducing therapy-related side effects in these children. Therefore, identifying low-or high-risk type nephroblastoma might be relevant for treatment planning. Diffuse anaplastic nephroblastoma and extensive blastema in residual tumour after preoperative chemotherapy may require more intensive treatment. The limited available literature suggest a linear relation between ADC values and subtypes nephroblastoma at histopathology. Furthermore, the addition of DWI to the standard MRI protocol may detect lesions (e.g. nephrogenic rests of nephroblastomatosis) that remain undetected at post contrast T1-weighted images. Unfortunately, there is a considerable heterogeneity in acquisition techniques and methods of ADC measurements. Nephroblastoma often contains areas of necrosis and/or hemorrhage that can demonstrate very low ADC values and consequently mimic highly cellular portions of tumours. Therefore these areas should be excluded from further analysis.

On the other hand, many circumstances are challenging the extensive use of PET/MRI in children. In general, the availability of PET/MRI systems is low, particularly for children. Thus, only a few sites in Europe have experience with this technique in children, and therefore the generated scientific evidence is limited. Moreover, whole-body-MRI is still not a broadly adopted method for the combined assessment of local disease extent and whole-body staging, potentially replacing other whole-body modalities like the bone scan. In this context, especially the detection of pulmonary metastases is biased also against PET/MRI.

AHT is clinically characterized by a triad consisting of subdural hematoma, retinal hemorrhage and encephalopathy caused by brain swelling (1). The most common mechanism responsible for brain damage is thought to be caused by whiplash shaking injury explaining that abusive head trauma is also referred as shaken baby syndrome. Impaction, compression and penetrating injury are also possible mechanisms as well as strangulation. However because of the variability of types and severity of injury, clinical symptoms vary from subtle to severe such as alteration of consciousness or coma (2) . The most common symptoms include vomiting, seizure, lethargy, poor feeding and apnea of which vomiting and respiratory pauses are non-specific (3). Poor feeding, irritability or lethargy is also nonspecific signs. However apnea and/or retinal hemorrhages seen in children with brain injury are strongly associated with inflicted trauma (4) . In contrast to acute injury some children may manifest with increased head circumference related to chronic subdural hematomas. Neuroimaging is therefore playing a crucial role to assess infants and children with a suspicion of abusive head trauma. Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the primary imaging techniques. CT is performed for the initial evaluation in cases with acute symptoms to look for hemorrhagic intracranial injury as subdural hematoma. MRI is more often performed in the following days to further evaluate brain injury and to look for spine and spinal cord damage (5, 6) or in the presence of normal or equivocal CT findings (7) . However brain MRI may be the first option in children presenting with increased head circumference. Recently the study from Flom et al showed the high sensitivity of MRI for intracranial hemorrhage in well appearing infants at risk for abusive head trauma suggesting MRI as a screening tool with 3 pulse sequences (axial T2, axial gradient recalled echo and coronal T1 weighted inversion recovery) (8) .",

            "text": "CT is generally performed without intravenous contrast injection with 3D volume rendering (VR) reconstructions for identification of fractures. In some cases postcontrast images are also obtained specially to rule out deep venous thrombosis especially when children present with nonspecific clinical symptoms. MRI protocol should include axial T2, T2* or susceptibility weighted images, coronal T1 images, diffusion or diffusion tensor images, and postcontrast 3DT1 images including MIP reconstructions to evaluate the venous structures. MR venography can also be performed. Susceptibility-weighted images are usually preferred because they allow the depiction of smaller hemorrhagic DAI lesions and greater number of lesions compared to GRE T2 (9) . It was also reported by Colbert et al (10) that the presence of micro-hemorrhages alone was useful for outcome prediction in abusive head trauma with significant poor long-term outcome. The sensitivity and specificity of microhemorrhages was also higher than the other clinical (such as retinal hemorrhages and glasgow coma scale score) and other imaging findings for prediction of outcome. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) measurements were reported in abusive head trauma by Imagawa et al: decreased axial diffusivity related to axonal injury with consequent reduced mean diffusivity did correlate with poor outcomes (11) . Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is usually not part of the standard protocol. However Aaen et al (12) showed that N-acetylaspartate/creatine and/or Nacetylaspartate/choline ratios were decreased significantly in the corpus callosum, frontal white matter, parieto-occipital white matter, and parietooccipital gray matter in children with poor outcomes. This study mentioned above also reported that the prediction of outcome was accurate in 100% of patients by using a logistic regression model that include age, initial glasgow coma scale score, presence of retinal hemorrhage, lactate on MRS, and mean total N-acetylaspartate/creatine.

            "text": "Intracranial injuries include extracerebral hemorrhages and parenchymal damage as brain swelling and ischemia, venous infarction, diffuse axonal injury, contusions and intraparenchymal hematomas (7, 16) . Extracerebral hemorrhages Subdural hematoma is a characteristic finding of inflicted traumatic brain injury, is generally multifocal and most commonly seen along the posterior interhemispheric scissure, over de convexities at the vertex level and/ or in the posterior fossa (17) (18) (19) . Subdural hematomas are most likely bilateral but may be unilateral. All locations are related to disruption of bridging veins. The identification of bridging vein rupture allows the diagnosis of traumatism in relation to acceleration/deceleration, rotational and shearing forces due to violent shaking (20) . A mixed density appearance of subdural hematomas is frequent but is also seen in accidental traumatic brain injury (21) (22) (23) . Indeed this feature is often present in the very early hours following trauma and is thought to be secondary to early sedimentation of blood clots and supernatant serum. Tubular high density is often seen on non-contrast CT over the convexities in abusive head trauma. This CT feature is related to a clot secondary to venous disruption (24, 25) that can end up in thrombophlebitis. This tubular high density was reported more recently as tadpole sign (26) and lollipop sign (27) respectively seen in 40 and 44% of abusive head trauma. This appearance is strongly associated to inflicted trauma and much less frequent in accidental trauma (3 out of 83 cases (3,6%) of accidental trauma in our experience). Associated venous infarction is reported in 12% of cases of abusive head trauma (24) and often located in the parieto-occipital region, unilaterally at the site of venous disruption of bridging veins. Subdural hemorrhages, when multiple, in the convexity and interhemispheric, or in the posterior fossa were found significantly associated with abusive head trauma in the meta-analysis reported by Kemp et al (28). In addition subdural hematoma, cerebral ischemia, skull fracture, retinal hemorrhage and intracranial injury were significantly associated with abusive head trauma in the review from Piteau et al (29). Subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAH) and epidural hematomas are also found in inflicted trauma and are not considered discriminant-imaging features. However epidural hemorrhages, isolated skull fracture and scalp swelling were reported as significantly associated with accidental traumatic brain injury (29). SAH in shaking injury is usually caused by tears of the vessels within the pia and arachnoid predominantly in the interhemispheric fissure and high convexity (7). Parenchymal injury Parenchymal injury include brain swelling and ischemia, venous infarction (discussed above), diffuse axonal injury related to rotationallyinduced shear-strain injury with different inertia for grey and white matter due to their different specific gravities, contusions seen in deceleration trauma with friction between the skull and brain, and in blunt trauma and intraparenchymal hematomas related to lacerated vessels. Brain swelling/ischemia may be related to increased blood volume (congestive swelling), increased presence of water in the nervous tissue, and the combination of both. Increased water in the nervous tissue may manifest as vasogenic edema located in the white matter due to extravasation of plasma like fluid related to incompetent blood-brain-barrier and as cytotoxic edema located in the grey matter, related to ionic imbalance. Cerebral edema can be recognize on CT within the 12 hours following injury as loss of gray-white matter differentiation and decreased attenuation of grey and white matter. Cytotoxic and vasogenic edema are better characterized on MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging. Brain swelling and edema occur early after trauma with consequent underestimation of subdural hematoma. Therefore imaging should be repeated (CT or MRI) especially when neurologic symptoms change rapidly. Brain swelling/ edema may also involve the posterior fossa and is better identified on brain MRI. Two frequent patterns have been reported in abusive head trauma (24). Diffuse supratentorial brain swelling (infarction) involving the cortex and white matter was reported in 39% of cases and is considered as severe hypoxic-ischemic injury with poor outcome (30). Watershed infarction was reported in 36% of cases and considered a less severe form of hypoxia-ischemia. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values are strongly associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes in the acute phase (within 4 days) especially basal ganglia, thalamus, brainstem, cerebral cortex, cerebellar vermis, cerebellar cortex and mean total brain (31). During the early phase up to 1 month ADC values in fewer regions (basal ganglia, thalamus, brainstem and corpus callosum) were associated with poor outcome. When patients with and without parenchymal lesions are compared, the detection of diffuse lesions during the first 3 months as well as beyond 3 months is significantly associated with severe developmental outcome (32). Late MRI (beyond 3 months after injury) also showed that recovery depends on the extent of brain damage. Patients with diffuse lesions show more severe motor and intellectual impairments and are more likely to have blindness and epilepsy than patients with focal or hemispheric lesions (32). Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is related to shear-strain injury of small medullary veins and was reported in 6% of cases of abusive head trauma (24). It is encountered in trauma with sudden acceleration-deceleration associated with rotational angular forces and in shaking-impact trauma. The lesions may be hemorrhagic or non hemorrhagic (related to axonal swelling). DAI is most often located in the subcortical white matter at the gray-white matter junction, corpus callosum, basal ganglia, brainstem and internal capsule. If the lesions are large enough and hemorrhagic DAI may be seen on CT. However DAI is usually better identified on MRI with susceptibility and diffusion weighted images. The detection of changes in the basal ganglia or brainstem during the first 3 days as well as during the first month after injury is significantly associated with poor long-term outcome in survivors (30). The presence of intraparenchymal brain micro-haemorrhages detected on SWI in children with abusive head trauma correlates with significantly poor long-term neurologic outcome (10) Contusion is also reported in abusive head trauma and is seen in blunt trauma with impact with or without contrecoup contusion. Contusions are located at the surface of the brain (crest of gyri) and may be pial and haemorrhagic (disruption of cortical arteries). They are also found in the frontal and temporal regions related to impact of the brain on the roof of the orbit, middle cranial fossa and sphenoid wing. White matter tears are also seen in the frontal and temporal area related to the vulnerability of unmyelinated and soft white matter in infants.",

Imaging correlates of post mortem interval are also being investigated. Maceration (autolysis within intrauterine fluid) and perimortem hypoxic brain changes caused difficulties in image interpretation, which more advanced and quantitative techniques may be able to address. Jawad Take home points: Below 500g, 1.5-T PMMR shows a significant reduction in diagnostic yield, compared with conventional autopsy, and therefore its clinical usefulness in this setting will depend on individual circumstances. 3T PMMR performs better than 1.5 T particularly <20 weeks gestation, and particularly for the chest, heart and abdomen. Diffusion characteristics in different fetal brain areas are multifactorial, with maceration the strongest predictor in most areas.",

We have observed patients with successful reductions with rather long periods between initial symptoms of ICI and performance of the air enema. We hypothesize that successful pneumatic reduction rates are independent of length of symptoms and in stable patients, repeated reduction attempts can be performed with the expectation of successful reduction.",

No contrast-related complication was encountered. Except 2 cases with failed catheterization, 108 were investigations of urinary tract infection (UTI), antenatal hydronephrosis and congenital anomalies etc., and remaining 10 were follow up studies of known reflux. Of all cases of UTI, 36 refluxing units were picked up by VUS, ranging from Grade I to V. Of the 36 refluxing units diagnosed by ceVUS, 17 were missed on MCU, among which 12 were high grade refluxes (grade III to V) requiring treatment; whereas ceVUS only missed one Grade I refluxing unit detected by MCU. Besides, one grade IV refluxing unit identified on VUS was under graded by MCU to Grade I. Regarding patient outcomes, one patient with MCU-missed refluxing unit presented with breakthrough UTI on follow up. Two refluxing units that were missed on MCU but detected on ceVUS demonstrated scarring on DMSA. Conclusion: ceVUS is shown to be more sensitive in detecting vesicoureteric reflux than MCU. The fact that MCU-missed refluxes detected by ceVUS were associated with breakthrough urinary tract infection and scarring on DMSA indicated that the extra sensitivity brought by ceVUS did translate to clinical significance. Difficulty in visualizing low-grade reflux is a potential limitation of this technique. With favourable diagnostic performance and safety profile, ceVUS can be further applied in this community in the era of radiation reduction.",

Amaral; Toronto/CA Objective: Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is a concerning finding in neonates and young infants, biliary atresia (BA) being one of the main diagnostic considerations. BA is a rare disease characterized by fibrosis of the biliary tree. The obliteration of the biliary system leads to cholestasis and ultimately liver parenchymal injury, cirrhosis and death. An early diagnosis of BA along with a Kasai portoenterostomy operation significantly improves the long-term prognosis. Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholecysto-Cholangiography (PTCC) is one of the options described in the diagnostic algorithm of BA. The aims of this study are to: (a) Describe PTCC findings in patients with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia; (b) Identify the abnormal patterns encountered that justify further investigations; (c) Analyze technical aspects of the procedure.",

Radiology residents and radiologists carried out 82 and 109 examinations respectively. Duration of fluoroscopy procedures performed by residents (av. 32.5s) was statistically significantly shorter in comparison with duration of fluoroscopy examinations performed by radiologists (av. 53s). DAP and skin dose did not show statistically significant difference between these two groups, as well as the number of positive and negative fluoroscopic findings in groups of examinations performed by radiologists and radiology residents. Mean DAP value ranged from 0.82\u03bcGym 2 (R2) to 7.5\u03bcGym 2 (R7) when performing VCUGs, and from 1.35\u03bcGym 2 (R2) to 4.79\u03bcGym 2 (R1) for upper GI series. Mean skin dose ranged from 14.33mGy (R2) to 151.48mGy (R3) for VCUGs, and from 28.66mGy (R2) to 120.54mGy (R4) for upper GI series. Mean fluoroscopy time ranged from 11.76s (R2) to 48.5s (R3) for VCUG, and from 26.22s (R2) to 125.75s (R3) for upper GI series. Statistically significant difference was shown only between radiologists R2 and R3 for DAP and skin dose values in performing VCUG, and for fluoroscopy time in performing an upper GI series. For all examinations DAP and skin dose were statistically significantly higher in the group of positive fluoroscopic findings.",

Case presentation: An otherwise healthy 37 day old male presented to dermatology with a pedunculated, friable red glabellar mass (centered between the eyes). First noticed as a flat, bluish lesion at 10 days, its subsequent rapid growth led to an emergency department visit where dermatology diagnosed a hemangioma and initiated propranolol treatment. Despite this, the mass continued to grow rapidly, encroaching upon the patient's right eye. The patient was admitted for further workup. An elevated beta hCG, anemia (7.4 mg/dL), and thrombocytopenia (92,000) suggested an alternate diagnosis. An MRI and ultrasound led to a percutaneous biopsy; pathology was consistent with choriocarcinoma. PET CT found FDG-avid glabellar, liver and lung lesions. Maternal and placental testing was negative for choriocarcinoma. Ultrasound demonstrates a hypoechoic hypervascular mass. MRI brain demonstrates cutaneous confinement of the solid avidly enhancing glabellar mass. CT shows a peripherally enhancing liver mass with a masslike area of consolidation in the right lung. Initial PET/CT demonstrated FDG avid liver and lung metastases with a small focus of residual activity at the glabella consistent with incomplete resection. Follow-up PET/CT showed astoundingly rapid re-growth of the glabellar mass and enlargement of the hepatic and pulmonary masses just 12 days later demonstrating the extremely aggressive nature of this cancer. 3month follow-up PET/CT showed significantly decreased size and activity of the metastases consistent with a treatment response.

MCAD deficiency is the most common genetic disorder of fatty acid oxidation. The clinical manifestation of the disorder is typically precipitated by stress due to fasting, vomiting, fever or muscular exertion and occurs in the majority of cases before the age of 2 with the onset of acute hypoketotic hypoglycemia. Clinical features of this decompensated state include seizures and lethargy proceeding to coma and death in the absence of prompt treatment with intravenous dextrose infusion. MCAD deficiency usually appears in an acute form and has high morbidity and mortality rates; early diagnosis is therefore extremely important in order to promptly begin treatment and obtain a complete recovery from symptoms. MR can play a significant role in the early diagnosis of the decompensated state of the disease; in our case DWI revealed the presence of lesions with a bilateral symmetric topographic distribution that strongly suggested a metabolic disease leading to acute encephalopathy.

Background: Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is an autoinflammatory paediatric non-infectious bone disease. Presenting symptoms are non-specific, prolonging diagnosis, and leading to deformity, morbidity and unnecessary procedures. Imaging is critical to diagnosis, with whole-body MRI (WBMRI) commonly used in all stages of care. In our institution, a baseline whole-body coronal STIR sequence is routinely obtained.

The high-dose irradiation induced DNA damage has been well established, however the dosages that are clinically used in everyday CT procedures are so low, that it remains unclear how this severely affects the DNA and can induce cancer in the long run. The aim of this study is to assess the effects of lowdose ionizing radiation from CT in children by establishing a standardization curve ranging from the high to the low, medically significant CTDI values. This is done by measuring the phosphorylation of the H2AX histone (\u03b3H2AX), which is considered a biomarker for quantification of radiation induced DNA Double-Strand Breaks (DDSBs).",

Afterwards the samples were processed with both methods. For the Immunofluorescence, twostep immunostaining was used with two different antibodies and the cell and foci counting were done on an OLYMPUS XC10 Microscope, while the FACS staining was done with a one-step antibody and the samples were measured on a Navios Flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter).",

Sclerotherapy treatments were performed with standard sclerosing agents, i.e. sotradecol 3% foam, absolute ethanol, and bleomycin. In the subset of patients with ranulas, sclerotherapy was commonly performed in accordance with salivary (submandibular and/or sublingual) gland botox injection or ethanol ablation. 22-gauge or 5F sheathed needles were used for US-guided access to the lesions, with ranula sclerotherapy being performed after placement of side-hole drainage catheters (5-10F) due to their increased viscosity. The preferred sclerosing agent was injected with dwell times ranging from 15 mins to 3 hours. Salivary gland injection/ablation was performed under USguidance using a 22-gauge needle with volume injection targeted centrally within the gland or in the portion of the gland abutting the ranula.

Incidence of tumor extension to inferior vena cava (IVC) is reported to be of 2-5% and intra-atrial extension of 0,2-1,2%. It occurs most commonly in tumors located in the right kidney (probably due to the shorter path of the right renal vein compared to the left one). This complication does not directly influence the prognosis of malignancy, but the degree of intravascular extension determines technical surgical strategy and increases difficulty of the surgical procedure, especially when there is intracardiac involvement, which increases morbidity. Several classifications have been proposed in the adult age group, but due to the similarity of the degree of intraoperative difficulty, the same classifications are used in children. Pritchett et al. (1986) described the relation between thrombus and hepatic vessels: Level I -intrahepatic intravascular extension; Level IIintrahepatic extension; and Level III -suprahepatic or atrial extension. Staehler et al. (1987) proposed a different classification that was posteriorly modified and detailed by Daum (1994) : Stage I -small extension (thrombus size within IVC <5 cm); Stage IIlarge thrombus (> 5 cm within the IVC), but still below the hepatic vessels; Stage III -thrombus extending to the level and above the hepatic vessels; Stage IV -intra-atrial thrombus.

Physical examination demonstrated a welldefined mass in the dorsal aspect of the forearm with no pulsatile bruit. Intial differentials included a vascular anomaly or a sarcomatous lesion. The patient proceeded to have an ultrasound examination which revealed a very well-defined heterogenous subcutaneous mass, mostly solid in substance. The lesion measured 3.5 cm x 1.6 cm x 3.5 cm (transverse x length x depth). There was no evidence of muscle invasion. Prominent internal arterial vascularisation was demonstrated and the mass was classed as inderminate in nature. Subsequent MR findings demonstrated a mass with T1 signal isointense to muscle, hyperintense T2 signal and marked homogenous enhancement. Small foci of intralesional T1 hyperintensity and larger areas of T2* gradient hypointensity were noted, in keeping with small areas of intralesional blood. Vessels were seen to extend from the subcutaneous fat into the lesion. The mass slightly distorted the underlying extensor muscles and tendons of the forearm but there was no deep extension across the fascia. Findings deemed the lesion to be more malignant in nature.

The tumor that has histologic resemblance to the developing salivary gland, is believed to be a hamartoma originating from minor salivary gland rather than a true neoplasm. Congenital SGAT displays male predilection and is a rare cause of neonatal airway obstruction. The mass is usual in the midline and attached to the posterior nasal septum or posterior nasopharygeal wall by a delicate pedicle. Favorable results with simple excision are obtained. Once massrelated airway obstruction is established, further examination with computed tomography (CT) or MRI is helpful in anatomic evaluation, size measurement, characteristics definition and intracranial involvement. If mass induced airway obstruction is suspected in a neonate and SGAT is considered based on imaging studies, invasive procedure should be careful due to the potential of tumor dislodgement from its fine pedicle resulting in complete airway obstruction. The association of intussusception with malrotation is referred to as Waugh syndrome. [1] Malrotation occurs in approximately 1 in 500 live births. [2] The incidence of malrotation amongchildren with intussusception is 40%. We hereby present a case report of Waugh's syndrome associated with midgut volvulus.",

Ultrasound (US) examination was performed and it revealed dilated fluid-filled small bowel loops with moderate amount of free fluid, Right iliac fossa showed bowel within bowel appearance suggestive of target/pseudo kidney sign of bowel intussusception. No pathologic lead point was identified. Transverse ultrasound image through the upper abdomen showed superior mesenteric vein noted to the left of the superior mesenteric artery hence malrotation should be considered. In view of surgical emergency non contrast enhanced CT was done and axial image showed target/sausage shaped soft tissue density mass it had alternating areas of low and high attenuation due to bowel wall and mesentry. On emergency laparotomy patient was found to have intestinal malrotation with duodenojejunal junction on the right of the midline and 180 mid gut volvulus in clockwise direction. Intussusception with terminal ileum (gangrenous), caecum, appendix, whole of ascending colon, transverse colon were telescoping into descending and sigmoid colon. The volvulus was derotated and the in tussusceptum was reduced. The gangrenous terminal ileum and appendix was resected and Ladd's procedure was done, a diverting ileostomy was created. The patient recovered uneventfully after which an ileo-colonic anastomosis was created Transverse Ultrasound shows a mass with a swirled appearance of alternating hypoechoic and hyperechoic \"bowel-within-bowel\" appearance (Target sign) Unique teaching points: On ultrasonography multiple, concentric, target like appearance of wall layers of invaginated segments (Target sign) on axial scan, as well as pseudokidney sign (sandwich sign) on longitudinal scans were accepted as diagnostic criteria for intussusception. [8] It can assess the relative positions of the SMV and SMA which are mostly abnormal in malrotation. Upper gastrointestinal contrast study is the imaging reference standard for diagnosis of malrotation with or without volvulus. Abnormal position of the duodeno-jejunal junction.

He had multiple hairy naevi over his face, limbs including the palms, since birth, associated with blackish discolouration of his entire trunk. Unique teaching points: Epidermal nevi are overgrowths of structures and tissue of the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin. The different types of epidermal nevi can vary in size, number, location, distribution and appearance. Neurological abnormalities that can be associated with ENSs can include seizures, cognitive impairment, developmental delays and paralysis of one side of the body (hemiparesis). Skeletal abnormalities can include abnormal curvature of the spine, The term \"epidermal nevus syndrome\" has generated significant controversy and confusion in the medical literature. Originally, the term was used to denote a disorder that was actually several different disorders erroneously grouped together. In the recent past, the term was used to denote a specific disorder now known as Schimmelpenning syndrome. However, the term epidermal nevus syndrome could be correctly applied to several different disorders. Therefore, the umbrella term \"epidermal nevus syndromes\" now represents a group of distinct disorders that have in common the presence of one of the various types of epidermal nevi. However, there is so far no general agreement how to classify the types of this diverse group of disorders, adding to the confusion within the medical literature. These disorders are quite different from one another and are not \"variants\" of each other as is sometimes mistakenly stated in the medical literature. In the future, as the genetic molecular basis of these disorders is better understood, the classification may change or expand.",

Haliloglu; Ankara/TR Objective: Most birth traumas are self-limiting and have a favorable outcome. Injuries to the infant that result from mechanical forces during the birth process are not uncommon. They occur most commonly on head and neck after vaginal breech delivery. However, soft tissue hematomas can be rarely seen after caesarian section (C/S). Herein, we describe imaging findings of a newborn with bilateral axillary lump diagnosed as hematoma. Case presentation: A 31-year-old woman was admitted to an outside hospital at 38 weeks' gestation for C/S due to prior caesarean operation. It was her fourth pregnancy (G4 P2). The pregnancy was unremarkable and she had normal ultrasounds at gestation. There was no history of trauma or fall during antenatal period. According to the C/S reports, the process of operation was uneventful any undue prolongation and without having used any other instrumentation. The weight of the female baby was 3.1kg at birth. On the 3 rd postnatal day, her mother noticed a left axillary swelling, then admitted to a tertiary children's hospital. Her physical examination revealed, bilateral axillary asymmetry with a fluctuant, nontender swellings. There was no redness or discoloration of the skin. There was no clinical feature suggestive of trauma or bleeding diathesis. A superficial ultrasonography showed solid heterogeneous, hyperechogenic masses 38x35 mm in the left axillary region and 15x13 mm in the right side. Doppler study did not reveal any flow in the masses. Contrast enhanced MR imaging demonstrated, bilateral axillary mass lesions with fluid levels and smooth contours (Figure 1 and 2) . T1W images demonstrated hyperintense component suggesting hemorrhage. After the administration of the gadolinium-based contrast material, lesions showed peripheral enhancement (Figure 3) . A diagnosis of hematoma was entertained. The child was managed non-operatively. She was monitored clinically and radiologically. Follow-up ultrasounds scan revealed significant regression of the swellings. Unique teaching points: Soft tissue hematomas can be rarely seen in newborns. The formation of axillary hematoma on the background of C/S is a rare complication, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously reported. Ultrasonography and MR imaging readily depicts hematoma and aids in the differential diagnosis. ",

Case presentation: Lemierre syndrome is a rare disease characterized by an initial infection of the head and neck leading to the development of a septic thrombophlebitis which has a propensity to spread and involve the jugular and facial veins. This progressive infection then leads to the development of metastatic septic emboli to the respiratory tract. We present the case of a 7 year old boy who attended with a 1 week history of fever and a cough. Initial imaging on admission demonstrated a large left sided hydropneumothorax with multiple cavitating lesions throughout the lung parenchyma in addition to thrombosis of some of the segmental pulmonary veins. The hydropneumothorax was surgically drained and the patient was transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit after further deterioration with the development of a broncho-pleural fistula. Following a short course of antibiotics there was no clinical or radiological improvement and sputum cultures grew coliform organisms which raised suspicion for a more distant source. When pus was noted to be discharging from the left ear, a contrast enhanced CT of the head and neck revealed a left mastoiditis with multiple cerebral abscesses and occlusive thrombi in the left jugular vein, transverse venous sinus, sagittal and straight sinuses. Following this diagnosis antibiotic therapy was modified and targeted at anaerobes, which was vital in assisting the patients recovery and successful discharge home. Unique teaching points: Clasically the majority of Lemierres syndrome begins in the oropharynxinvolving the palantine tonsils and peritonsillar tissue often presenting with fever, sore throat and neck pain. Our case demonstrates an atypical presentation with sepsis and respiratory symptoms as a result of the septic emboli which delayed diagnosis. We have learnt from this case the importance of considering Lemierres syndrome in patients presenting with signs of a respiratory infectionin particular cavitating pulmonary lesions-that have not improved with conventional therapy and to have a low threshold to investigate the head and neck as a potential source of infection.",

Subsequently MRI of the head and spine was performed, and showed signs of diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement with basal predominance. Multiple DWI restricted parenchymal lesions with basal predominance were also found. Repeated CSF and blood tests did not reveal any causative organism, although the gradually increasing CRP suggested infection. Two weeks after the onset of symptoms a follow up MRI study showed extensive cerebral and spinal swelling with no focal lesion. The child passed away three days later due to cardiac failure.

Positive serology for streptococcus or other infectious agents has been previously reported as in our case and may be a triggering factor. Striking MRI findings with a negative radiograph may occur at initial stages. Symmetrical distribution of non-specific bone marrow edema around epiphyses and apophyses is highly suggestive of the diagnosis in the appropriate clinical setting and following exclusion of suppurative bone infections as well as bone or hematologic malignancies. The radial pattern of edema in our patient is unusual and considered to comply with the direction of main trabecular systems in femoral heads. In 26/31 chest CTs, 103 nodules (median size 2.0 mm) were detected. Display mode A with 5 mm MIP yielded the best interreader variability (\u03ba=0.294) and the highest sensitivity (73.9%) compared to mode B and C (\u03ba=0.218, sensitivity 61.2% and \u03ba=0.238, sensitivity 59.3%, respectively).

Objective: Diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in children relies on chest radiography, however there is wide inter-observer agreement in detecting lymphadenopathy, the hallmark of PTB. Paediatric airways are pliable, thus detection of airway compression may be a more objective criterion for the presence of lymphadenopathy.

However, CXR interpretation is limited by moderate sensitivity and specificity and poor inter-and intra-rater reliability and expose children to potentially harmful ionizing radiation. Point-of-care lung ultrasound (LUS) has been proposed as alternative to CXR for diagnosis of pneumonia in children and some published data suggest accuracy and reliability as good as or better than CXR. Most of these studies however, were performed in in-hospital settings creating a bias for selceting more severe disease and consequently more overt radiological findings. The mean age of children in most of these studies were also well above one year, while the highest incidence and risk of complicated pneumonia occurs during the first year of life. The purpose of our study was to assess the diagnostic performance of LUS for the diagnosis of pneumonia in both hospitalised and non-hospitalised children in an age group representative of the most at risk segment of the population.",

Where radiographs were available concordance between LUS and CXR findings of pneumonia were also assessed. Results: Seventy-four hospitalised and 73 non-hospitalised clinically defined pneumonia cases were included with a median age of 10.3 years. Our general practitioner reported LUS findings consistent with pneumonia in 77/147 (52%) compared with 66/147 (45%) by the paediatric radiologist. Substantial overall agreement between the reporters was found with an overall agreement proportion of 0.79 and kappa=0.62. Agreement for the presence of lung consolidation or for a normal scan was also substantial with kappa of 0.67 and 0.68 respectively. Agreement on the finding of interstitial syndrome was moderate with kappa=0.45. Agreement was higher in hospitalised than in non-hospitalised cases with kappa of 0.62 and 0.56 for the respective categories. Results showing concordance between LUS and CXR findings are pending.

Case presentation: A 2 year old boy presented with a 6 day history of pyrexia, vomiting and respiratory distress. He was haemodynamically stable, and had no audible air entry over his upper left thorax with occasional wheeze over the left base. He had bronchiolitis previously but did not require ventilatory support. He was otherwise well with unremarkable antenatal scans. Initial chest X-ray showed a large air collection with fluid or soft tissue density within the left hemi-thorax and mediastinal shift to the right. Repeat X-ray (Figure 1 ) demonstrated the nasogastric tube below the diaphragm. Complicated pneumonia was suspected but as the findings were atypical a non-contrast CT was performed. This was interpreted as showing a large hydropneumothorax. (Figure 2) . A chest drain was inserted which drained only a small volume of fluid, and a repeat chest film showed no change. CT chest and abdomen with oral and intravenous contrast revealed a Bochdalek diaphragmatic hernia (Figure 3) . Fortunately the chest drain had not entered the herniated stomach. The hernia was surgically corrected and the child recovered well.",

            "text": "Bochdalek is the most common congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). It is often diagnosed on prenatal ultrasound, with MRI used for confirmation. CDH which is not diagnosed in the perinatal period may be asymptomatic and imaging findings can be confusing. Postnatal X-ray typically shows an opacified hemi-thorax with or without gas bubbles. There can be mass effect with mediastinal shift. The position of an NG tube can be helpful in localising the stomach, but in this case the infradiaphragmatic position of the tube gave false reassurance. In neonates, the position of an umbilical venous catheter may demonstrate abnormal location of the liver. Computed tomography generally demonstrates a posterolateral defect (foramen of Bochdalek), which is located on the left in 80% of cases. CT is useful for excluding lung masses or bronchopulmonary foregut malformations, which may appear similar to CDH on X-ray. CT can also identify anatomical abnormalities associated with CDH. Late presenting CDH is often misdiagnosed as pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There are other case reports published where chest drains were inserted before CDH was diagnosed. It is important to keep CDH in mind as a potential cause of unilateral hemithorax opacification, even in previously asymptomatic older children. CT with oral contrast can be useful in diagnosis.",

Kondaurova; Minsk Region/BY Objective: Early diagnosis of fungal infections of the tissues is essential for a successful and complete recovery. We describe a clinical case of fungal infection of the soft tissue in a child with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Ultrasound were made for the characteristics of the structural changes in the area of interest to perform biopsies followed by bacteriological culture studies. Case presentation: Patient K., 13 years old, diagnosed with AML, from which after a course of induction chemotherapy with neutropenia about 3 weeks on the skin of the foreskin appeared removable hard white coating. Cultures of plaque it possible to establish the presence of fungi of the genus Trichosporon spp. After 4 days, there were hyperemia, compaction and ulceration of the glans penis, which led to extensive tissue defects. With help ultrasound were determined the structural deformation of the glans penis with the pronounced around changed tissues vascularization. After 7 days in the rear surface projection of the left thigh and the lateral surface of the left calf were defined erythematous papules which progressed to ulceration with central black scab. By standard ultrasound were visualized: subcutaneous nodal education oval 1,0\u04450,4 sm on hip and echogenic skin thickened portion having an average degree of severity of dorsal acoustic shadow on the lower leg (weakening of the signal behind scab). In cultures of biopsies of subcutaneous foci were revealed fungi of the genus Trichosporon spp too. The patient received the combination treatment (intravenous liposomal amphotericin B and surgical rehabilitation of lesions of glans and corpus cavernosum of penis). After the stabilization of patient state the treatment of the underlying disease was continued. Unique teaching points: For some patients, lesions of superficial tissues may be the only sign of systemic fungal infections, and rapid recognition of these lesions may contribute to early diagnosis and treatment. Ultrasound examination in such a situation naturally becomes an main imaging tool and by choice method. The scanning High-resolution of foci of the thigh of the patient K. in grayscale made possibility to determine the configuration consisting of the central echogenic focus surrounded by a hypoechoic rim (Fig. 1) with peripheral changes in the type of \"infiltrative\" according by the active fungal infection at the exit of cytopenia. Duplex and triplex ultrasound scanning were indicating to the perifocal vascularization with low level vascular resistance around of the affected area (see Fig.2-3) . ",

Case presentation: An 3-month-old female was presented to our hospital with abdominal distention that increased in the past 3 months associated with low-grade fever, loss of weight and mild respiratory distress. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed an enlarged liver with multifocal hypoechoic lesions scattered all over the liver (fig 1) . A CT scan with IV contrast (MRI was not available at that time in our district) revealed severe hepatomegaly with the presence of multiple, variable in size, hepatic hypodense lesions which had peripheral (ring) enhancement after contrast injection in the arterial phase (Fig 2) . Progressive centripetal filling in portal phase is seen and in the delayed images many of the lesions were completely filled (Fig 3) . Reduction in the aortic caliber (mid-aortic syndrome) below the level of celiac branch was noted. A diagnosis of hemangioendothelioma was made although liver biopsy was not done due to fear of hemorrhage. Alternative diagnosis to infantile hemangioendothelioma in this age group is hepatoblastoma, mesenchymal hamartoma and metastatic neuroblastoma. The patient was transferred to another city to a hospital with pediatric oncology department for follow up and treatment. Unfortunately the lack of experience and knowledge of such rare cases led to mismanagement and delayed treatment and after less than 2 months the patient was brought back to our hospital to the pediatric ICU due to deterioration of her status due to congestive heart failure. Unfortunately the patient died shortly afterwards. Hemangioendothelioma is twice as common in girls and can have complications due to high output CHF secondary to arteriovenous shunting Hemangioendotheliomas tend to involute spontaneously without therapy over a course of months to years. They are followed with sequential ultrasounds. Medical therapy is reserved for severely symptomatic lesions (e.g. anemia, consumptive coagulopathy, high-output CHF) and includes high-dose steroids or alpha-interferon. In cases of failed medical management, surgical resection should be performed. If partial hepatectomy is not technically achievable, transarterial embolization should be used either as definitive therapy or as a temporizing measure until liver transplantation is possible. The sad outcome of this case was mainly due to mismanagment due to lack of medical experience and knowledge of such rare cases so we suggest that such rare cases should be catalogued in a national data bank for future consultation and teaching purposes.",

The right pleural fluid was transudative in nature and the microbiological cultures for bacteria and mycobacterial species were negative. The radiographic examination [ Figure 1 ] showed moderate right pleural effusion a n d f e a t u r e s o f o x a l o s i s i n c l u d i n g b i l a t e r a l c o r t i c a l nephrocalcinosis and generalized increased in bone sclerosis. Delayed planar images of the peritoneal scinitigraphy [ Figure 2 ] obtained 3 and 5 hours after injection of Technetium-99 m suphlur colloid found diffuse tracer activity at the right hemithorax, suggestive of pleuro-peritoneal fistula. The patient subsequently required thoracoscopy and surgical decortication at the right hemithorax and renal transplantation. Primary hyperoxaluria is due to defective glyoxylate metabolism and results in increased synthesis of oxalic acid. Cortical nephrocalcinosis and diffusely increased bone sclerosis are characteristic radiographic features. Pleuroperitoneal fistula is unusual in patients without peritoneal dialysis. Possible cause in this patient is increased intra-abdominal pressure related to portal hypertension and cirrhosis. Osteosarcoma with Pulmonary Intra-arterial Tumor Embolism Metastasis A. Alzaher, F. Alzaher; Dammam/SA Objective: Osteosarcoma rarely invade the veins and small number of cases has been reported with venous invasion at the presentation. However, to our knowledge, no case has been reported with venous invasion and isolated distal metastasis as intra-arterial pulmonary embolisms. We are presenting a case of pediatric pelvic osteosarcoma with venous invasion and pulmonary arterial tumor embolisms as isolated distant metastasis at the presentation. The purpose of this case report is to describe the rare presentation of distant metastasis as isolated pulmonary arterial embolism that might be overlooked radiological. Additionally, such tumor embolism might cause respiratory symptoms and differentiating tumor emblism from pulmonary thromboembolism is crucial to avoid the unnecessary anticoagulation. Case presentation: Fourteen year old boy who presented with 3 months history of right hip and lower limb pain after trauma. This was associated with lower limb swelling. The plain radiography showed right pelvic iliac bone aggressive mass, along with lobulated, soft-tissue components, extensive areas of osseous matrix, and malignant periosteal reaction. The patient could not tolerate the MRI and CT scan was performed and it showed that the mass was invading the right external and internal iliac vein with imaging appearance was most consistent with osteosarcoma. Patient staging was then carried on with MRI under anesthesia and chest, abdomen and pelvic CT scan. The unenhanced and IV contrast enhanced chest CT scan showed multiple beaded expansion of sub segmental pulmonary arteries with soft tissue destinies and calcification suggestive of intra-arterial pulmonary tumor embolisms. There was no isolated pulmonary nodule or any other site of distant metastasis. Unique teaching points: We present this case to increase the awareness of isolated intra-arterial pulmonary tumor embolisms as osteosarcoma metastasis especially with the present of venous invasion. Additionally, such condition might be with respiratory symptoms and differentiating the tumor embolism from pulmonary thromboembolism is crucial to avoid the unnecessary anticoagulation. Case presentation: A 14-year old boy with acute myelodysplastic syndrome presented with recurrent, acute severe anemia (hemoglobin 68 g/dL) and melena. His past history was significant for bone marrow transplant twice followed by graft-versus-host-disease of intestines, bilateral lung transplants for bronchiolitis obliterans, renal failure, scleroderma and acute pancreatitis. CT angiography performed previously did not identify active extravasation. Several days before, upper GI endoscopy had demonstrated ulceration of the greater curvature of the gastric wall that was initially treated with epinephrine injection and surgical clip placement. At the time of referral, endoscopic interventions were unsuccessful leading to progressive clinical deterioration. A decision was taken to proceed to angiography to isolate the arterial source of hemorrhage, with an intention to embolize, if feasible.",

            "text": "Catheter angiography via transfemoral 4Fr access revealed a left gastric artery pseudoaneurysm with active extravasation into the gastric lumen through the ulcer. After selecting the feeding pedicle of the left gastric artery with a microcatheter, the pseudoaneurysm was embolized using 40% NBCA in lipiodol, resulting in complete angiographic obliteration of the bleeding source. On repeat CBC 6 hours post-procedure, the hemoglobin had increased from 80 to 115 g/dL. The patient remained hemodynamically stable in the intensive care unit. There is no evidence of bleeding recurrence 25 days later. Unique teaching points: Catheter angiography can define the bleeding source with greater accuracy than CTA in children. There should be a low threshold to perform catheter angiography, with an intention to proceed to treatment. NBCA embolization is a feasible and effective option for treatment of acute GI bleeding in children. Case presentation: An infant born by cesarean section at 38 weeks of gestation, after nonreassuring cardiotocoghraphy, with meconium aspiration at birth, severe hepatocellular failure with hyperbilirubinemia, signs of hemorrhage, edema, ascites, hypoglycemia, increased ferritin values, and lactic acidosis was referred for ultrasound and magnetic resonance. Both examinations showed signs of liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension; in addition, on T2-weighted images and gradient-echo images, the signal intensity of the liver and the pancreas was lower than that of the spleen and skeletal muscle, a finding consistent with abnormal iron deposition in those organs. A biopsy of the lower lip confirmed the diagnosis of neonatal hemochromatosis. Unique teaching points: Although the diagnosis may be suspected clinically, it must be confirmed by demonstrating the generalized iron overload affecting, among other organs, the salivary glands, liver and pancreas, with sparing of the reticuloendothelial system. The underlying cause may be associated with an an alloimmune mechanism; thus, intravenous immunoglobulin during gestation is administered in selected cases to prevent the severity of neonatal hemochromatosis. Diagnosis is then crucial not only for management of the affected infant, but also for prevention in the future offspring.",

In the acute exogenous form secondary to aspiration of oil, it is important to make the diagnosis and remove the causative agent to prevent or arrest the progression of pulmonary fibrosis.

Rudas; Budapest/HU Objective: Nowadays, the diffusion-weighted MRI has a great importance not only in the differential diagnosis and follow-ups of childhood renal tumors, but in the early detection of recurrence of the disease as well. The DWIBS with appropriate b-values and the ADC calculation can be helpful in distinguishing between benign and malignant processes. However, the ADC calculation is a time consuming method and in addition, there are cases when we cannot use this technique, but we can still apply the visual evaluation of diffusion. Case presentation: Between 2013-2016, we had 5 cases in which the visual assessment of DWIBS was the best method which helped to make the appropriate therapeutic decisions. Left kidney of an infant with nephroblastomatosis was removed because of an arising Wilms tumor. 2,5 years later, in the contralateral kidney, a small area of diffusion restriction appeared on the DWIBS in one of the cystic residual lesions, but the anatomic sequences haven't showed any changes comparing with the previous examinations. In another patient with Beckwidt-Wiedemann syndrome, the follow-up ultrasound examination showed a little bulging of the surface of the left kidney. Accordingly, the MRI showed a barely distinguishable nodule, but the DWIBS referred to a Wilms tumor. In a 17-month-old child, more nodules were visible in both kidney on the DWIBS than on other sequences. With the help of visual evaluation of DWIBS, we were able to detect the malignant lesion easily and quickly, among a lot of cystic and solid nodules of the kidneys in a seven years old patient with sclerosis tuberosa. An 8-month-old infant was followed with a benign cystic renal disease and a new small solid nodule was found on the last ultrasound examination. Instead, the visual assessment of DWIBS indicated a multilocular cystic Wilms' tumor. Unique teaching points: The diffusion-weighted MRI is suitable for differentiate benign and malignant renal lesions in children. The DWIBS (with appropriate b-values) and the ADC calculation are very sensitive methods in pediatric oncoradiology. The ADC calculation is a long process andas our cases demonstrated -we cannot apply in every cases. The visual evaluation of DWIBS is a time saving method which is spared from limitations of ADC histogram-based assessment, so it may become very useful in the everyday practice. We can use it in the differential diagnosis and follow-ups of childhood renal tumors and we can detect the recurrence of the malgnancy very early and easily.",

Salerno; Palermo/IT Objective: Congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) occurs in up to 3.2% of infants, and clinically they can range from asymptomatic patients, in which anomaly is detected incidentally even in adulthood, to ante-natal or post-natal mortality due to bilateral kidney agenesis or acute renal failure. DMSA Renal scintigraphy is considered gold standard, for evaluation of those cases electable for surgery, in order to assess renal function, depict and locate ectopic kidney and guide surgical management, but has the important limit of radiation exposure and may undetect poorly functional renal moieties. The advent of modern Magnetic Resonance technics proven to be able to assess anatomical malformations and renal function, overcoming the limits of DMSA Scintigraphy, may be used as a valid alternative, especially in vulnerable pediatric population. We herein describe a case of a young girl with small left renal bud and ectopic ureter, draining in vagina, discovered by MR and undetected by previous DSMA Scintigraphy. Case presentation: A 9 years old girl was referred for continuous urinary dribbling, after starting toilet training, with normal bladder voiding pattern, unrelated to any physical and psychological events, and no history of urinary tract infections. Physical examination revealed vaginal septa and micturition training was practiced, with no symptoms improvement. Abdominal US study was performed, reporting empty left renal fossa and hypertrophic right kidney; no ectopic kidney nor sign of urine stasis or other urogenital anomalies were detected, and DMSA Renal scintigraphy was planned. It depicted only normal right kidney radionuclide uptake but no evidence of left renal or ectopic renal tissues activity. Patient then underwent MR evaluation for suspected genito urinary malformation, that revealed a small cystic formation, with a slight cortex, at the level of the IV lumbar vertebra -that represented the left immature renal bud -supplied by a short fluid-filled tubular structure, located postero-medially to the bladder -that configured the left ectopic ureter, draining in left vaginal wall. Bladder was normal, and regularly connected with the right orthotopic ureter (FIG 1) . Pre-surgical cystoscopy and vaginoscopy, followed by left ascending urethrogram were performed, confirmed previous MR findings, and patient underwent successfull laparoscopic left nephron-ureterectomy. Unique teaching points: MR Urography has proven to be a rapid, safe, radiation free, systematic diagnostic tool especially in the evaluation of poorly functioning renal systems, and of collecting system, bladder and ureteral abnormalities, overcoming the limits of conventional imaging technics Agenesis of the dorsal pancreas: Case report C. Lanza, G. Pieroni, L. Amici, A. Giovagnoni; Ancona/IT Objective: Agenesis of the dorsal pancreas (ADP) is a rare malformation. Since 1911 and until 2008, 53 cases have been reported.

Nutmeg lung was seen in all patients on fetal MRI and 4 patients on fetal US. 5/6 patients had pleural effusions, 2/6 had ascites and 1/6 had body wall edema prenatally. Postnatal MRI with 3D T2 SPACE revealed soft tissue edema in the upper chest and neck (5/6 patients), mediastinal edema (5/6 patients), interstitial lung edema (6/6 patients), retroperitoneal edema (5/6 patients), and ascites (6/6 patients). DCMRL demonstrated lymphatic flow to the pleural space (5/6 patients) and to the abdominal cavity (1/6 patients) and dermal backflow (2/6 patients). CL was performed in 4 patients, all of which had collateral lymphatic flow to the lung. Lymphatic intervention was performed in 3 patients, lipiodol injection for 2 patients with NC and thoracic duct embolization (TDE) for 1 patient with CLD. Mean hospital duration in the first 4 months of life was 51 days (range 5-113) for NC and 105 days (range 75-120) for CLD. All 3 patients with CLD died after 4 months of age due to respiratory distress including the patient that had TDE and both with findings of dermal backflow. The pleural effusions in the 2 patients with NC resolved post lipiodol injection and in the other patient with NC it resolved with conservative therapy. Conclusion: NLFD is a disorder that can be recognized on prenatal and postnatal imaging. In this small series, nutmeg lung was present in all patients with NLFD and may be easier to recognize with fetal MR than US. Dermal backflow on DCMRL suggests a poor prognosis. Both prenatal and postnatal imaging may guide treatment and interventions in NLFD. ",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and ability of RVS to assess the main cerebral pathologies in fetuses with suspected US anomalies. Materials: This is a prospective study. Fusion imaging (Hitachi HI Vision Ascendus) was offered to 35 patients undergone Fetal MRI for a US suspicion of cerebral pathology. The MRI image dataset acquired was loaded into the fusion system using a CD support and displayed together with the US image. Both sets of images were then manually synchronized and images were registered. The possibility to record the images in a video format allowed, however, the possibility to re-evaluated the examination. Results: RVS was technically possible in all cases. Data registration, matching and fusion imaging were performed in 25 minutes at the beginning and in less than 15-20 minutes after practice. The ability of RVS imaging to assess the main anatomical sites and fetal anomalies was evaluated and compared with standard US and MRI images. The principal application of RVS was the study of midline, cerebral gyration and vascular malformations because it also allowed adding a real time Doppler signal on MRI images.

Arthurs 1 ; 1 London/UK, 2 Southampton/UK Objective: Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) uses water molecule diffusion to generate MR contrast images, and can reveal microstructural or functional changes in tissues, quantified by measuring the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). The application of DWI to the post mortem setting is appealing as it does not require the administration of an exogenous contrast agent. A recent pilot study of 15 paediatric cases suggested that lung ADC values at PM MRI may be a useful marker of post mortem interval (time since death; PMI) which has forensic relevance, but other body organs have not been comprehensively evaluated. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the relationship between PMI and body organ ADC values in a larger cohort of subjects across a wider gestational range in the setting of perinatal death.",

The values were measured by two independent readers, correlated against gestational age and post mortem interval (PMI) using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. Bland-Altman plots were created, and the limits of agreement used to assess the inter-observer agreement of mean ADC values. Results: Eighty fetal deaths and stillbirths were imaged with mean gestational age 31.5 weeks (range: 20 -41 weeks). The mean PMI was 8.9 days (range 2-20 days). There was a weakly positive correlation between PMI and mean lung ADC (R 2 =0.03) and spleen ADC (R 2 =0.08). No correlation was found with between ADC and PMI for the other body organs.

Total renal volume is described by the sum of parenchymal volume and intra-renal collecting system volume.

This presentation demonstrates that the imaging features can be varied, and knowledge about factors distorting the position of the DJ flexure is vital in the accurate management of neonates presenting with bilious vomits. Retrospective study of prospectively collected data performed at a single tertiary paediatric institution over a 16.5 year period. A total of 1000 consecutive patients, aged <18 years, were reviewed who underwent native renal biopsy. All biopsies were performed within the Interventional Radiology Department. All patients had renal disease requiring a renal biopsy for diagnosis. Outcome measures include technical success, early and late complications and the adequacy of histological samples. In addition, age, body weight, glomeruli number, histological data, number of cores, size of the biopsy needle, use of co-axial needle and the rate of tract embolisation/plugging were recorded. Results: From September 1999 to April 2016, 1000 patients (mean age: 10.07 years +/-4.65; range 0.14 -18.0 years) underwent native renal biopsy. One hundred ninety-one patients were <5 years of age. Nine hundred forty-six patients (94.6%) had a biopsy of the right kidney, 53 patients (5.3%) had a biopsy of the left kidney and 1 patient (0.1%) had a biopsy of a horseshoe kidney. Five hundred fifteen patients were female (51.5%). Seven hundred sixtynine patients (76.9%) had the procedure performed under general anaes-thetic and 227 of patients (22.7%) had the procedure performed under local anaesthetic (+/-sedation/Entonox). Mean number of passes of the core biopsy needle through the renal capsule was 2.7. A 16 gauge core biopsy needle was used in 100% of the patients. 81.9% of the patients had three or less passes of the biopsy needle though the renal capsule. The overall complication rate was 2.6% (n= 26). 1.2% (n= 12) of patients had a non-diagnostic biopsy. Fifty-five patients underwent a post biopsy ultrasound due to clinical concerns. Twenty patients developed perinephric haematoma (19 were treated conservatively; one underwent embolisation and subsequent nephrectomy). Four patients developed arteriovenous fistulas. Two patients developed post procedure infections (one at the skin site and one a perinephric collection). Histology results were reviewed in all patients. The mean number of glomeruli obtained was 26.97 (range 2-87). Glomerulonephritis was the most common histological diagnosis (n=464; 46.4%) Conclusion: Renal biopsy is an extremely useful diagnostic tool for renal disease. There is no published data of this size assessing the outcome of native renal biopsies in the paediatric population. ",

The main reasons for this is are a) that the number of examinations carried out in children is lower compared to adults and b) data need to be categorised into age or weight subgroups. The 'European DRLs for Paediatric Imaging' project (abbreviation: PiDRL) is a European Commission project that aimed to a) develop a methodology for establishing and using DRLs for paediatric medical imaging and b) update and extend the European DRLs. The professional organisations involved include the ESR as coordinator, as well as EFOMP, EFRS, and ESPR, covering the key European stakeholders and professional groups with relevance to radiation protection of paediatric patients. b) The PiDRL project has very recently drafted European Guidelines on how to establish and how to use paediatric DRLs. The main recommendations of 'PiDRL European Guidelines' are in summary: & All examinations resulting in high collective doses should have DRLs. This can include both the most common low dose examinations and the less common high dose examinations.",

From each hospital or radiology department a representative sample of at least 10 patients per procedure type and per patient group is recommended for non-complex examinations such as radiography and CT, and at least 20 patients per procedure type and per patient group for complex procedures such as fluoroscopy and fluoroscopically guided procedures.& In collecting the patient dose data for the DRLs, likewise in daily imaging practices, there should always be a system in place to judge whether image quality is adequate for the diagnosis according to the indication of the examination. This could be based, on image quality assessment of typical test cases by several radiologists, for example. The image quality requirement should be based on clinical grounds only. & Due to the generally large amount of data needed and the large number of potential errors when these data are to be collected during routine practice, automatic data collection is recommended wherever possible. & Besides the actual patient dose data according to the recommended patient grouping, other data from the examination characteristics (e.g. x-ray equipment type, exposure parameters, use of AEC) should be collected for evaluation and decision making when DRLs are to be established. & Patient dose surveys for the basis of setting the NDRLs, should be conducted by the authoritative body which sets the DRLs or by another competent institution, with the collaboration of national professional/scientific societies or at least having recognised clinical experts as consultants in the process. & The complete history of the patient dose surveys for the setting of DRLs, including all essential dosimetric and statistical information (e.g. quantities and their collected values, coverage of institutions and practices, sample sizes) should be documented and preferably reported.",

Abstract: Pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction (PUJO), classified into intrinsic and estrinsic is one of the most frequent urological diseases affecting the pediatric population. Extrinsic causes include the presence of crossing vessels, kinks or adhesions. In cases with extrinsic obstruction of PUJ, Colour Doppler Ultrasound (CD-US) can detect the presence of crossing vessels. In presence of crossing vessels pyeloplasty or vascular hitch can be performed. The aim of the study is to analyze the sensitivity of CD-US and Magnetic Resonance Urography (MRU) in visualizing crossing vessels in extrinsic pediatric hydronephrosis in order to decide the correct diagnostic pathway and evaluate in the pre-operative phase which surgical technique and approach (open, laparoscopic or robotic) is the ideal to be performed.",

The median age was higher in the group with crossing vessels compared to the group without crossing vessels (p< 0,0001). The sensitivity of CD-US was higher compared to MRU (93,3% vs 71,7%). Before the surgical time knowing which technique and approach have to be managed in hydronephrotic patients with crossing vessels could be very important. According to our preliminary datacollection CD-US has got a higher sensitivity and could be the gold standard technique. Study limitations include the absence of specificity, positive and negative predictive values. In the future it could be useful to perform a double blind trial in which children with moderate-severe hydronephrosis will be subjected to both imaging techniques to evaluate not only the sensitivity, but also the specificity, the positive predictive value and the negative predictive value Conclusion: Conclusions In the pre-operative phase, CD-US could be sufficient for the surgeon to discern between PUJO with the presence or the absence of crossing vessels, as it has a higher sensitivity and lower costs compared to MRU.Urosonography -Nonradiant alternative for voiding cystourethrography O.M.

For the patients investigated with both methods, the results were concordant in 4 patients. In two patients VUR has not been identified by VCUG, but was detected during VUS. The upright position (in addition to decubitus) revealed VUR in 3 renal units in which the reflux was not detected in decubitus.

UGI was performed in 61 neonates who had US. The correct diagnosis was provided only by US in 24 of these 61 newborns (39%), only by UGI in 5 (8%), by both in 26 (43%) and by neither in 6 (10%). UGI was performed in 21 children with malrotation and volvulus, eight were diagnosed only by US, four only by UGI and nine by both. The gastric and/or duodenal wall was significantly thicker and more hyperechoic in neonates with congenital duodenal anomalies than those with malrotation (p<0.0001) [Fig 1, Table 1 ]. Conversely an abnormal relationship between the superior mesenteric artery and vein, abnormal position of the third part of the duodenum and the whirlpool sign were found more commonly in neonates with malrotation than those with congenital anomalies (p<0.0001).",
