Therefore, we conducted a retrospective analysis to investigate our hypothesis. Methods: The ethics committee of our hospital approved this retrospective study. We included consecutive patients aged < 6 years who underwent tracheal intubation under general anesthesia in our hospital from August 2013 to October 2015. We collected the following data from the anesthesia records: age in months, height, weight, type of a tracheal tube, and ID and OD of tracheal tube. Patients who were intubated using a cuffed tracheal tube or had incomplete data were excluded. We developed a regression formula for calculating ID and OD based on age in months and calculated the coefficient of determination R 2 by using a regression analyses. A difference of 0.4 mm in the actual and predicted tube size was considered clinically permissible. Then, we compared the rate of a clinical permissible estimation of the Cole's formula and our new formulas used by multiple comparison analysis and a p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 207 pediatric patients received general anesthesia during the study period. Of these, 67 patients were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. Finally, we included 140 patients for this analysis. The regression formula for predicting ID by based on age in months was ID = 0.019 \u00d7 age in months + 3.48, and the coefficient of determination R 2 was 0.54. The regression formula for predicting OD based on age in months was OD = 0.024 \u00d7 age in months + 5.21, and coefficient of determination R 2 was 0.558. The rate of a clinical permissible estimation of our ID and OD formulas were significantly higher than that of the Cole's formula (61 %, 69 % and 43 %, respectively; p < 0.01). Conclusions: Our results showed that the prediction of ID based on age in months is more useful than that using Cole's formula. In addition, estimation of OD based on age in months might be more rational because OD varies according to the type of the tracheal tube used.

Many medical societies and organizations recommend teaching BLS at schools as part of the educative program [2] ; being this a reality in North European countries, but not yet an education standard issue in others including Spain. Moreover, less is written about the perception of CA and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) among the general population, and even less in school age. Objectives: Describe the perception and knowledge about CA and CPR among a teenager school population in Barcelona, Spain. Methods: Prospective, descriptive study carried out between 2007-2009 and 2012-2015 among teenagers school population, based on surveys before and after BLS -CPR classes. During this period , 17th classes were held, in 3 different schools in Barcelona. Before attending the class , each pupil was asked to answer a survey with questions related to previous knowledge of sudden death, CA, and CPR, and their attitude towards them. The class consisted on a threehour theorical and practical instruction based on the European Resuscitation Council guidelines, adapted for laypersons. Practices were held with an instructor (ratio instructor:pupil 1: [6] [7] [8] , with the Little Anne mannequins (Laerdal\u00ae). After the class, a new survey (post intervention) was distributed, with questions related to the new concepts and skills learnt, the attitude toward CA and CPR. Results: We have instructed 561 pupils (14.02 (\u00b10.79) years, 48.2 % female). The 87.8 % had heard about sudden death and CA before the class. Regarding starting CPR: 40 % said they were not capable of doing it, and 51.2 % suggested they would be able to do CPR but in a wrong manner. In a CA scene 58.9 % would contact the emergency service and start CPR, 27.4 % would call and wait, and 11.4 % would only do CPR. After attending the classes 98.6 % declared had understood the theorical concepts and practical skilles taught; 95.4 % would changed positively their attitude towards CPR; and 97.4 % would be prone to start maneuvers. Conclusions: CPR and CA remain a well known issue among teenager population in Barcelona, as long as being an interesting topic. Nevertheless they do not feel capable of starting maneuvers. The concepts taught during the class were easy to learn , and after the intervention the majority were prone to start CPR. This population is adequate to teach CPR.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 154, "end": 157, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 268, "end": 271, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1313, "end": 1316, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1317, "end": 1320, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1321, "end": 1324, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF290"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Introduction: To meet the need of patients family members and staff we started to guide visiting children at our adult ICU in the St Elisabeth hospital (EZ) in Tilburg 3 years ago. To do so we developed a guidance leaflet for parents with practical instructions and information. Additionally, practical advice is given, such as what to say to the child and what to expect when visiting. The leaflet is subdivided in developmental stages. Furthermore we developed a book \"mees op bezoek\", in which a child visits his father at the ICU. Pictures show what children can expect, which helps prepare the child for visiting at home. An instruction box is present at the ICU with ICU materials such as an iv catheter, a pulse oximetry or a tracheal tube. These materials give children a tactile experience of the ICU. The box is divided in two parts; the second part contains guidance materials for when a patient may die. Pedagogical staff are available to support parents, children and staff. If there are more profound problems a referral to our children's psychologist is possible. We made some improvements to our waiting area to make it more appealing to children. We instructed and educated our nurses and doctors on how to use these materials and how to guide children. We recently merged with the Twee steden Hospital in Tilburg (TSZ), in this hospital there was no program to guide children. With the merger we also wanted to introduce our \"Child as a visitor program\" at the ICU on location TSZ.

Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) occurs in 10 % of all PICU admissions and the risk of acute and chronic malnutrition is high in these patients with AKI, and the presence of malnutrition in the context of AKI has been associated with more severe clinical deterioration and organ dysfunction. Critically ill children with AKI are at high risk of underfeeding. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of protein feeding on the resolution of AKI. Methods: This is a retrospective study of critically ill children admitted from 10/2012-12/2013 to the PICU. Patients with a diagnosis of end stage renal disease requiring renal replacement therapy or had received a kidney transplant were excluded. Nutritional status assessed by weight and height WHO z-scores after admission and caloric and protein intakes calculated from I.V. fluids and parenteral and enteral nutrition for the first 8 days of admission. Energy and protein needs estimated by Schofield and A.S.P.E.N., respectively. AKI was defined by pRIFLE (creatinine only) and persistent AKI was defined as patients who did not resolve their AKI during the first eight days of PICU stay. Introduction: Sedation and analgesia are important components of postoperative management of neonates who underwent cardiac surgery. Excessive or inadequate sedation may have a significant adverse effect on patient outcome. Objectives. We aimed to determine which drug regimen would be most effective with less side-effect and better outcome. Methods: From March 2012 till March 2014 we conducted a randomized controlled prospective study in 60 neonates with congenital heart disease who underwent Arterial Switch Operation in our clinic. Inclusion criteria: 1) gestational age more than 36 weeks, 2) birth weight over 2500 g, 3) age -up to 28 days, 4) absence of concomitant diseases and surgical complications. Patients were randomized into 2 cohorts: 30 patients (50 %) were given infusion of dexmedetomidine with morphine boluses (study group) and 30 patients (50 %) were randomized to the standard regimen -infusion of morphine with diazepam boluses (control group). Results: In both groups there were no differences in pre-and intraoperative indexes, duration of mechanical ventilation, sympathomimetic support, and time of infusion of dexmedetomidine/ morphine. In study group time of ICU stay -93.5 h -was significantly shorter than in control group -120 h (p-0.02). Onset of peristalsis and start of feeding in study group was earlier than in control group -1st vs 2-d day (p-0.007) and 2-d vs 2.5-day (p-0.035), respectively. In the control group there were more patients who had complicated feeding (start after 3-d day, bloating or vomiting) -11(37 %) vs 3(10 %) in the study group. We did not observe any decrease of mean blood pressure and heart rate in the study group as it could be expected. Conclusion: Use of dexmedetomidine with morphine hydrochloride boluses for postoperative sedation and analgesia is effective and facilitates feeding process in neonates, leads to earlier onset of peristalsis and start of feeding, decreasing ICU stay.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1907, "end": 1909, "text": "3)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Impact of positive end expiratory pressure on cerebral hemodynamic in paediatric patients with post-traumatic brain swelling treated by surgical decompression S.M.

Several adult randomized controlled trials have shown that administration of high concentration oxygen leads to rise in carbon dioxide and increases admission rates. However, there are no studies in the pediatric population comparing the effects of high concentration oxygen versus titrated oxygen therapy in asthma exacerbation. Objectives: We evaluated the effects of transcutaneous carbon dioxide (tPaCO 2 ) in high concentration oxygen therapy versus titrated oxygen therapy to maintain saturation between 92 to 95 % in pediatric patients with acute asthma exacerbation in the ED. Methods: Children 2 to 18 years with previously diagnosed asthma with moderate to severe asthma exacerbation (asthma score > 5) were randomized to high concentration oxygen therapy (100 % oxygen via face mask at >4 L/min.) or titrated oxygen therapy (titrated up from 21 % via a blender continuously) to maintain saturations between 92 to 95 % while receiving their nebulized treatments. Exclusion criteria included disorders with hypercapnic respiratory failure, unconscious patient, history of congenital heart disease, pregnancy, history of smoking or using sedatives and depressants. Asthma therapy was provided per the ED physician. Asthma score, tPaCO 2 , PEFR (age >7 years) were measured at the start of the study and every 20 minutes for the first hour then every 30 minutes until disposition decision. The primary outcome was increase in tPaCO 2 with high concentration oxygen therapy. Secondary outcome included rate of admission to the hospital. Results: 73 patients were enrolled with mean age of 8.6 years. 60 % were males and 72 % had poorly controlled asthma with mean asthma score of 7.6. There were 36 patients enrolled in the high concentration oxygen group (HCOT) and 37 patients in the titrated oxygen group (TOT). The 0 minute tPaCO 2 were not statistically different(35.6 \u00b1 3.8 HCOT v. 37.4 \u00b1 4.4 TOT,p = 0.07); whereas, the 20 minutes tPaCO 2 was statistically different(40 \u00b1 3.8 HCOT v. 37.5 \u00b1 5.1 TOT, p = 0.02). The 60 minutes tPaCO 2 was 39.2 \u00b1 4.6 HCOT v. 35.5 \u00b1 4.3 TOT, p = 0.0009. At 20 minutes, 89 % of the patients had a rise in tPaCO 2 in HCOT v. 30 % in the TOT(p = < 0.0001), and at 60 minutes 78 % had a rise in tPaCO2 in HCOT v. 16 % in the TOT(p = < 0.0001). The asthma score was similar in the two groups at 0 minute (7.8 \u00b1 1.4 HCOT v. 7.4 \u00b1 1.3 TOT, p = 0.23); whereas, the 60 minutes asthma score was lower in the TOT(4.7 \u00b1 1.5 HCOT v. 3.7 \u00b1 1.3 TOT, p = 0.002). The rate of admission to the hospital was 36.1 % in HCOT v. 24.3 % in the TOT. Conclusions: High concentration oxygen therapy in pediatric asthma exacerbation leads to significantly higher carbon dioxide levels. It also causes rise in carbon dioxide from the baseline which increases the asthma scores and rate of admission.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 255, "end": 262, "text": "Conti 1", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A801"}, {"text": "Introduction: In critically ill patients, temperature measurement is a routine important care task and can lead to important decisions. Rectal temperature and bladder temperature are now used as a continuous body temperature measuring method in the pediatric intensive care, but these practices have several disadvantages including the patient\u00b4s discomfort, the risk of organ injury and the inaccurate measuring caused by the sensor position. A new temperature monitoring system 3M TM Spot-On TM (SpotOn) is a non-invasive zero-heat-flux thermometer designed to estimate core body temperature from the skin surface. Although the usefulness and accuracy of SpotOn system in adult patients have been demonstrated, there are no reports on pediatric intensive care patients. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a new temperature measurement system attached to the forehead, and compare it to rectal temperature sensors in terms of correlation and accuracy. Methods: Pediatric patients weighing less than 10Kg, who were managed in our ICU during the period from February 2015 to March 2016, were enrolled in this study. Core temperature was measured and recorded at every minute from the both thermistor of a rectal thermal probe and with SpotOn in these patients. The data when the forehead sensor or rectal probe was taken out for nursing care was excluded from statistical analysis. Results: 53495 sets of data of 26 children (Mean BW 5630 g) were examined retrospectively. In all patients, SpotOn showed higher than the rectal temperatures. The SpotOn temperature was analyzed to be 0.82 degrees (95 % limits of agreement of \u00b1 0.51) higher temperature than the rectal one with a moderate correlation(r = 0.73). Discussion and conclusion: Rectal temperature measurement is the gold standard method for pediatric patients in ICU despite several complications of rectal injury. Our children\u00b4s study demonstrated the slightly higher temperature in the SpotOn than rectal temperature with a substantial correlation. One possible explanation could be that the abundance of brain blood flow of children affected the results. Our study concluded that SpotOn system could be used as a highly reliable noninvasive core body temperature measurement for small pediatric patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A801"}, {"text": "Introduction: Viral bronchiolitis (VB) remains one of the leading causes of hospitalization in early childhood. Despite the heavy burden of VB on the healthcare system, little is known about the incidence of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in this cohort of patients.

Objectives: To study the incidence and prevalence of PARDS in VB and to study the association between PARDS and specific PICU outcomes such as incidence of mechanical ventilation, noninvasive ventilator settings length of PICU stay in this group of patients. Methods: This is a retrospective single center observational cohort study that examined children 0-2 years of age admitted to the PICU with VB and respiratory failure (RF) from 2011-2014. PALICC criteria were applied to define PARDS. Clinical and demographic data was collected. Patients with a diagnosis of congenital heart disease or pre-existing chronic lung disease were excluded. Data was expressed as median with IQR ranges. Test of bivariate association were performed using Mann Whitney U test and chi square test. A two tailed p value of \u2264 0.05 was used to denote statistical significance. Results: Out of 1700 patients with RF, 330 with VB met study criteria. Eighty of these 330 (24 %) patients admitted for VB met the criteria for PARDS or at risk for PARDS. Out of these 80 patients, 25 (31 %) met criteria for PARDS and 55 (69 %) met criteria for \"at risk of PARDS\". Median age was 5 (2,11) months and the median weight was 6.9 (5.3, 9.5) kgs. Most common etiology for VB was respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 68 % followed by Rhinovirus (20 %). There was no statistically significant difference in age, weight, and etiology of VB in patients with PARDS and those \"at risk of PARDS.\" Patients with PARDS had longer hospital and PICU length of stay (LOS) and more likely to receive diuretics compared to those \"at risk for PARDS\" (16 (10, 21) Vs 8 (6, 10.5) , p = 0.0001; 10 (7, 13) Vs 3 (2, 4.5), p < 0.0001; and 66 % vs 33 %, p = 0.02 respectively). Nineteen (19/25, 76 %) patients with PARDS received invasive mechanical ventilation with a median duration of ventilation of 6 (1, 10) days. Conclusions: Almost a quarter of children with VB developed PARDS or were at risk of PARDS. The presence of PARDS in children with VB was significantly associated with longer PICU and Hospital LOS compared to those \"at risk of PARDS\".

Patients raised similar themes to relatives, although with diverse opinions. Themes of wanting to have a diary kept and considering they would find a diary helpful were consistent across a majority of participants, although with a minority expressing a desire to 'move on' and would not have liked a diary kept. Differences between patients and relatives arose in the areas of the purpose, content, ownership and timing of delivery of a diary. Patients viewed the diary as a therapeutic tool while relatives considered it as an information sharing mechanism, including as a mechanism to demonstrate to the patient 'how sick he really was' and 'what he put us through'. Possibly as a result of these differences, patients considered that ownership of the diary rested with them while some relatives envisaged shared ownership. Patients were more likely to note that the diary should not be provided to them until some weeks after ICU while relatives considered an early time point soon after ICU discharge to be appropriate. Patients were more likely to raise concerns about the potential negative impact of information sharing strategies including diaries and return visits to the ICU. Conclusions: Patients and relatives expressed common themes related to information sharing strategies after ICU, but with some important differences. Differences in purpose, content, ownership and timing of delivery of a diary suggest there is a need to consider whether the same intervention meets the needs of both groups of stakeholders.

Rocking chair studies have shown concrete results to improve patient satisfaction, balance and well-being in patients who suffered from dementia (1) . However, no studies have evaluated the value and the effect of RCMT for critically ill patients in the ICU.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2478, "end": 2481, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A801"}, {"text": "Objectives: The purpose of the study was to evaluate whether RCMT could be used in the rehabilitation of critically ill patients in the intensive care.

Introduction: Critical illness and immobility in the Intensive care unit (ICU) lead to a loss of muscle mass and reduced exercise capacity for many years following hospital discharge. [1] Nutritional management of the critically ill is challenging and most nutritional studies are focused in this period. Nutritional recommendations are for a high protein diet to minimise muscle breakdown and support protein synthesis during rehabilitation. Nevertheless, during the rehabilitation period little is known of patients' protein intake and physical functioning. Objective: To investigate physical functioning, frailty and dietary protein intake after 6 months of ICU discharge. Method: Our ICU is recognised as a therapy rehabilitation centre and the only ICU member of the UK Rehabilitation Outcomes (UK-ROC). Patients cognitive and physical functioning is assessed as part of their rehabilitation therapy with the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) score [2] . The FIM contains 18 items on motor (13) and cognitive (5) functions that are scored on a 7-point ordinal scale based on the amount of assistance a person requires to perform specific activities. The FIM scores on ICU discharge and also on return to the rehabilitation clinic after 6 months were assessed. In addition, frailty was assessed based on a scale ranging from very fit to very severely frail, terminally ill [3] and patients were asked to complete a protein food frequency questionnaire. Results: Twenty patients were assessed. Data are reported as mean and (standard deviation). Patients were male 66 % and 53.4 years (33.5). Paired t tests of the changes in FIM scores from discharge showed significant increments; 9.7 \u00b1 11.4 (P = 0.05) and 24.7 \u00b1 23.4 (P < 0.04) for motor and cognitive scales respectively. Nevertheless, patients reported that they were \"vulnerable to moderately frail\" in the frailty scale. Dietary intake was also inadequate with a protein intake of 0.83 g/kg (1.15 ). Objectives: Physiotherapy rehabilitation is a recognised component of ICU care. The Intensive Care Society -Core Standards 2 recommends that rehabilitation is 'at a level that enables the patient to meet their rehabilitation goals for as long as they\u2026are able to tolerate it'. In order to investigate and measure the terms 'tolerate' and 'level', physiological measurements and their relationship with self-perceived exertion and tolerance were analysed. Methods: The project was registered with Guy's & St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, Clinical Audit Group, (Project No. 4701). A convenience sample, of ICU patients undergoing active physiotherapy led rehabilitation, were observed between July and September 2014. A Modified Exertion Scale was used to measure patients' perceived effort. Patients also rated tolerance of the session using a Tolerability Scale, created based on the exertion scale. Sessions were timed, heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation were monitored and the cardiovascular impact of the session measured using Heart Rate Reserve (HRR).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 432, "end": 435, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1206, "end": 1209, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1266, "end": 1269, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1629, "end": 1632, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2204, "end": 2209, "text": "(1.15", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A801"}, {"text": "Results: Nine rehabilitation sessions were observed; mean length of 17 minutes (range 9-28).

Introduction: The incidence of candidemia has increased in ICU patients (1) . In addition, there are differences in epidemiology among different countries.

Introduction: The antifungal (AF) therapy strategy (pre-emptive vs culture based treatment) in intensive care unit is a matter of debate [1] . The necessity to not delay the initiation of the AF in invasive candidiasis (IC) must be balanced with the cost and risk of selecting resistant pathogens when AF are prescribed too widely. Burn patients are at risk of IC because of the frequent use of antibiotics and immunodeficiency. Objectives: To evaluate our antifungal (AF) therapy strategy in suspected or proven IC in terms of prognosis and risk factors of IC. Methods: Observational, descriptive, retrospective study conducted from June 2012 to September 2015 in the Saint Louis Hospital Burn Unit. Inclusion criteria: patients treated with pre-emptive (severe sepsis or septic shock with Candida Sp colonization) or curative (proven, PIC) AF. The outcome was the PIC (candidemia and/or positive peritoneal sample). Clinical characteristics, organ supports, AF treatments and outcome were collected and compared between PIC and suspected IC (SIC). The results are presented in median (IQR) or n (%). Results: 715 patients were admitted during the study period including 184 with a total body surface area (TBSA) >20 %. 44 treated with AF including 14 PIC (32 %). In those 44 patients: age 55 (43-67), TBSA (43-67), SAPSII 41 (29-53), ABSI 10 (8-12) and SOFA 10 (5-15). Renal replacement therapy 22 (50 %), mechanical ventilation 36 (82 %), parenteral nutrition 7 (16 %). Inhospital mortality = 60 % (68 % SIC vs 32 % PIC, p = 0.33). 3 patients with PIC (21 %) were treated before the IC diagnosis (2 because of filamentous infection before the PIC). The delay between admission and AF treatment initiation was 16 days. Patients characteristics, organs supports were not significantly different between PIC and SIC at the treatment initiation except for the SAPSII (PIC 43 (29-57) VS SIC 37 (26-49), p = 0.03). 30 patients (68 %) received an echinocandin as a first-line treatment. 6 (5.5-6.5) sites were monitored for Candida colonization the week before treatment initiation. Patients with PIC had higher colonization index than those with SIC (55 % vs 33 %, p = 0.01) and a candida score significantly higher (4 vs 3 (0.5-3.5) respectively, p = 0.03). A semiquantitative estimation of the fungal inoculum had no predictive value. Conclusions: In this study, the majority of PIC were treated after diagnosis confirmation. Only 1/30 (3 %) patient treated preemptively did declare a PIC. The outcome was not different when the treatment was initiated after confirmation. The results of this study highlight the difficulty to identify patients at highest risk of IC, and question the strategy of preemptive treatment in this population.

In the univariable analysis worse outcome with mRS was related with the volume of the hematoma (p 0,03) but not with GOS (p 0,29). Variables associated with mortality: GCS (p 0.000), APACHE II (p 0.000), GRAEB (p 0.001), SOFA (p 0.000), LOS-ICU (p 0.004) and ICH volume (p 0.000). After the multivariable analysis we determined hematoma volume was an independent risk factor for mortality (OR 1,032; 95 % CI 1,019-1,046; p 0.000). According the location we obtained a significantly association with mortality in the supratentorial group (p 0,000). We performed a ROC curve of this group and obtained an AUC 0,718 (95 % CI 0,603-0,834; p 0.000) with cutoff point of 20,2 cc 3 . Conclusions: Hematoma volume and LOS-ICU are greater in supratentorial ICH. The hematoma volume is associated with a worse outcome at ICU discharge and a supratentorial ICH volume above 20.2 cc 3 is related to higher risk of mortality. Introduction: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is an acute cerebrovascular event, which leads to devastating consequences, high mortality and is an important cause of neurologic disability among survivors. Incidence is reported between 2 to 16/100000 and mortality rates vary widely, ranging from 8 to 67 % among different authors. Many complications associated with SAH, such as delayed cerebral ischemia or hydrocephalus, also play a role in the poor functional outcome in survivors.

Background: Conflicting results have been obtained by studies attempting to assess the risks of ischemic stroke in patients with venous thromboembolism, while the long-term risk of stroke in survivors of venous thromboembolism remains unexplored. Objective: We evaluated whether the risk of ischemic stroke in patients hospitalized with venous thromboembolism is higher when compared to the general population. Methods: One million patients from National Health Insurance beneficiaries in Taiwan were sampled. There were 2,145 patients who had been hospitalized with diagnosis of venous thromboembolism and 727,607 unexposed subjects. All adult patients were followed from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2013 to evaluate if ischemic stroke was diagnosed. Cox regression models were applied to compare the hazards adjusted for potential confounders. Results: After controlling for age, gender, urbanization level, socioeconomic status, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, history of alcohol intoxication, malignancies, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, smoking, peripheral artery disease and Charlson Comorbidity Index, the adjusted hazard ratio of ischemic stroke was significantly increased in patients with venous thromboembolism (2.47; 95 % CI, 2.16-2.83). A subgroup analysis based on patients who survived longer than 12 months in the cohort also revealed higher hazard ratio in the patients with venous thromboembolism. (1.32; 95 % CI, 1.05-1.66). Conclusion: The possible risk of ischemic stroke is significantly higher in patients hospitalized with venous thromboembolism than in the general population. Introduction: Status epilepticus (SE) is a common neurological emergency with considerable associated health-care costs, morbidity and mortality. 1,2 SE is defined as a prolonged seizure or multiple seizures with incomplete return to baseline. 1, 2 The overall mortality of SE is around 20 % with convulsive status epilepticus representing about 45-74 % of all cases. 1 Status Epilepticus Severity Score (STESS) is a prognostic score that relies on four outcome measures (age, history of seizures, seizure type and extent of consciousness impairment) determined before treatment institution that ranges between 0 and 6. 3 Objective: Evaluation of STESS as a prognostic measure of functional impairment, neurologic motor deficits and 28-day mortality. Methods: Retrospective observational study of patients with SE admitted at a general intensive care unit (ICU) from 2009 to 2015. Age, gender, SAPS II/III, type of SE, length of stay, number of anti-epileptic drugs, duration of SE, functional impairment, neurologic motor deficits and 28-day mortality were collected through the ICU informatics database -PICIS\u00ae. Data is presented as mean \u00b1 SD and we used logistic regression to correlate STESS with study variables. Statistical analysis was performed using XStat 2016\u00ae. Results: Sample included 29 patients, 72,6 % male, age 46,6 \u00b1 12,5 years, SAPS II 42,3 \u00b1 13,1, SAPS III 55,7 \u00b1 16,6, ICU length of stay 4,4 \u00b1 2,6 days and hospital length of stay 16,2 \u00b1 13,3 days. Convulsive SE represented 79,3 % of cases. STESS score`s mean was 2,6 \u00b1 0,8. SE lasted more than 1 day in 48,3 %. Electroencephalogram was performed in 51,6 % of the patients. 48,1 % of the patients needed two or more anti-epileptic drug for SE. At hospital discharge 20,7 % had functional impairment and 13,8 % had neurologic motor deficits. Mortality was 6,8 % at 28 days. There was a correlation between STESS and mortality (OR = 10,4; ROC = 0,963), functional impairment (OR = 1,93; ROC = 0,667) and neurologic motor deficits (OR = 4,32; ROC = 0,820). The number of antiepileptic drugs and SE duration had no correlation significance. Conclusions: We found an excellent correlation between STESS and mortality in our study. Besides this, we also found this score to be a good prognostic tool for functional impairment and neurologic motor deficits. We consider our main limitations the sample size and lower mortality. Despite we recommend using STESS as an outcome predictor. Introduction: In order to determine optimal airway protection measures in early postoperative period after fossa posterior surgery (PFS), it is important to carry out a prognosis of neurological dynamics based on the preoperative neurological exam. We have designed Neurological Evaluation Scale (NES). Objectives: Our study was aimed at determining the potential of NES to predict brain stem deterioration in early postoperative period after PFS based on the assessment of the preoperative neurological status. Methods: The prospective study was carried out during the period from December 2013 to June 2014 and included 182 patients operated for fossa posterior tumors (FPT). To be included in the study, patients had to be over 18 years old and operated for fossa posterior non infiltrative paraxial tumors. We examined all patients before and after the operation, immediately after the extubation in ICU. NES provided complex neurological assessment with an emphasis on the brain stem function. Postoperative NES points were subtracted from the preoperative points -AB-criterion (ABc). Positive ABc corresponds to intensification of neurological deterioration. Negative or zero ABc corresponds to neurological improvement. All neurological symptoms were grouped in 7 NES blocks according to their relation to CNS. Results: We divided all patients in two groups depending on their ABc, which revealed that the patients with positive ABc had reliability less NES points before operation compared to the patients with negative or zero ABc. We found out the frequency of occurrence of each NES block for inclusion in the full neurologic status. We discovered that caudal stem affection occurred more frequently in the patients with more NES points. We evaluated the probability of neurological impairment or regression of neurological symptoms depending on ABc with sensitivity 90,7 % and specificity 95 %. We created a prognostic model, which could predict the discharge from clinic outcome on the basis of the NES blocks points assigned during the early postoperative period. Conclusions: We revealed neurological features of postoperative period in patient after FPS. Our data could predict neurological outcomes, and be useful in optimization tactic of airway protection. and those who died (5.9 \u00b1 3; 6.5 \u00b1 2 and \u00b1 5.6 25 \u00b1 2 vs 42; 29.4 \u00b1 52 and 23.1 \u00b1 43 respectively) but difference was not significant.

Anonymous patient data from 36 intubated patients who were cared for in the ED, OR and ICU within their first 24 hours were collected. This included physiological observations and supportive care standards around A, B and C. Results: The most striking differences in staff opinion involved the preferential use of artificial colloid-based fluid resuscitation in sepsis (17 % ED staff; 50 % OR staff; 8 % critical care staff); the value and significance of recording End Tidal CO2 (4 % ED staff; 97 % OR staff; 69 % critical care staff); and the potential preferential use of flowdirected fluid boluses rather than pressure-directed fluid boluses in critically ill patients (22 % ED staff; 90 % anaesthetic staff; 75 % critical care staff). When observing supportive care standards the largest differences were in the use of stress ulcer prophylaxis (only prescribed in critical care); patient positioning (head-up: 94 % patients in CC; 6 % in ED); the recording of sedation level (0 % ED; 6 % anaesthetic; 78 % critical care) and the recording of ventilator parameterstidal volume, peak pressure and ET-CO2-(3 % ED; 69 % anaesthetic; 100 % critical care) . Finally, in respect to patient pathophysiology, all groups were under ventilated and over oxygenated. Mean arterial pressure was most divergent from baseline in the ED. However, changes in pathophysiology were related to interventions (fluid boluses, analgesia, surgical interventions, inotropes, pressors) rather than location. Despite the divergent views regarding the relative value of flow monitoring, observed fluid boluses were predominantly triggered by pressure changes in all three locations. Conclusions: Differences in staff attitudes; application of standards and patient pathophysiology were identified between care locations.

Introduction: Treatment withdrawal in intensive care is common (1) . Whilst significant research attention has focused on how treatment is withdrawn and what information is communicated to families (2) Introduction: Micro-aspiration of subglottic secretions is considered a major pathogenic mechanism of endotracheal tube-associated pneumonia (ETAP), either postoperative pneumonia or ventilatorassociated pneumonia. Endotracheal tubes (ETs) with taper-shaped cuffs have been proposed to provide a better seal of the extraluminal airway, thereby preventing micro-aspiration and possibly ETAP. Objectives: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of ETs with taper-shaped cuffs in the prevention of ETAP. Methods: A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL/ CCTR was conducted in March 2016. Eligible trials were randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) comparing taper-shaped cuffs with standard, cylindrical-shaped cuffs in intubated patients. All studies reporting the incidence of ETAP were included. Inclusion of trials was irrespective of publication status, date of publication or language. Random-effects meta-analysis calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) for the incidence of ETAP between both groups using the Mantel-Haenszel method. Results: Three RCTs, given a total of 855 patients, met the inclusion criteria. One trial was published as a conference abstract only (1), while the others were published in full (2, 3) . None of the trials was blinded for the intervention. 440 patients were allocated to the intervention arm and 415 to the control arm. 87 ETAP episodes occurred in the intervention group and 83 in the control group. The pooled RR for the incidence of ETAP was 1.01 (95 % CI, 0.78-1.31; z = 0.11 p = 0.91). Conclusions: The use of endotracheal tubes with taper-shaped cuffs did not show to reduce the incidence of ETAP. However, the number of available studies is small, and there is an inherent risk of bias due to the unblinded designs. Background: Understaffing of ICU's can have serious adverse consequences both for patients and for nurses, and therefore it is important to have an adequate number of nurses on the ward. Nurses however are in short demand and resources are scarce. Being able to predict the nursing workload for a certain group of patients may help to allocate nursing capacity as efficiently as possible and thus to reduce costs, without endangering the patients safety and nurses' health. NAS is a validated tool for the measurement of nursing workload in an intensive care unit. Goal: This study was conducted to investigate whether it is possible to predict the nursing workload for a homogeneous group of patients, admitted after an in or out of hospital cardiac arrest and to assess the effects of baseline characteristics, vital parameters and admittance time on this workload. Method: We performed a retrospective analysis of NAS scores of all IHCA and OHCA patients admitted to our ICU from October 2012 until September 2015 during the first 48 hours of stay. The NAS was recorded per patient per nursing shift. We furthermore recorded patient characteristics and vital parameters. Results: During this period 386 patients, 273 males and 113 females, were admitted to the ICU after cardiac arrest. The mean age at admission was 63.4 years (SD = 14.8). The mean NAS at admission was 71.4 (SD = 22.4). Patients admitted in the evening shift had a significantly higher NAS compared to patients admitted in the night shift (74.3; SD = 21.2 vs 67.4; SD = 22.3 (p = 0.037)), but no significant difference was found with the day shift (mean NAS day shift: 71.7; SD = 23.3). After admission the workload decreased in all patients by a mean of 18.3 points (SD = 23.9; p < 0.001). A higher SOFA score, a higher PEEP and a lower pH at admittance resulted in a higher NAS score on average over time (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The nursing workload at admission of patients after cardiac arrest is fairly predictable, with no clinically significant difference between shifts , necessitating a nurse-to-patient ratio of at least 1:1. After the first shift it is almost always possible to decrease the nurseto-patient ratio to 1:2. The NAS was influenced by severity of illness. These results can be used to assess the needed nursing staff for the treatment of these patients for the first days after admittance. Introduction: Major trauma and severe sepsis are both leading causes of admission to the resuscitation rooms in emergency departments across the world. Despite obvious differences in precipitating mechanism, there are surprising similarities between subsequent pathophysiology: both disorders lead to disorders of the macrocirculation, microcirculation and host inflammatory response (1, 2) . Objectives: Here we compare the baseline epidemiology, pathophysiology, operational and clinical management of intubated resuscitation room patients with these two critical illness syndromes (Major Trauma/Septic shock). The results will be used to facilitate the design and planning of a study to test the feasibility/effectiveness of advanced monitoring systems (thromboelastography, oesophageal doppler flow monitoring, echocardiography, and microcirculatory monitoring) in the resuscitation room management of critically ill patients with these conditions. Methods: Institutional approval was gained to collect anonymised patient data over a 6-month period from a mixture of written and electronic records. Where appropriate, significance was tested by Mann Whitney U (Sigmaplot 11.0). Results: 162 patients, intubated pre-hospital or in ED resus, were identified with trauma or sepsis diagnoses. Trauma patients were commoner (n = 128; 79 %) and more likely to be intubated prehospital (107/128; 83.6 % vs 27/34; 79 %). Lactate profiles were similar in the two groups at start and end of resus episode ( Figure 18 ). Patients with major trauma were more hypertensive but equally tachycardic when compared with patients with severe sepsis/septic shock. Patients with septic shock/severe sepsis (median 202 minutes vs 128 minutes) spent longer in resuscitation room, but received less documented consultant-level review (90.6 % vs 20.6 %). Imaging of major trauma patients was with CT (128/128; 100 %) and ultrasound (44/128; 34.3 %) in contrast to septic patients (11/34 CT; 32.4 %; 2/34, 1 % US). ICU and hospital mortality was higher in patients with sepsis (38.2 % vs 14.8 %), but death in resus only occurred in the trauma population. Only two patients, both with facial trauma, would have had a relative contraindication to the proposed advanced monitoring. Conclusions: This novel preliminary work has highlighted some important differences between the epidemiology, outcomes, pathophysiology and clinical/operational management of intubated patients with severe sepsis versus major trauma. These will influence the conduct and outcome measures of any trial of advanced monitoring in this setting. However, contraindications to any of the advanced monitoring technologies being considered were rare and no obvious barriers to the planned study of advanced monitoring were identified. Introduction: In our 15-bedded GICU, demand for beds has increased while recruitment of ICU trained nurses has decreased. There is enduring evidence of links between workload and stress [1, 2] , with high levels of burnout reported in ICU nurses [3] . There has been a shift towards measuring what makes people positive and engaged [4] , rather than why people reach the extreme state of burn out. It is important to understand factors that affect work engagement to develop strategies that enhance nurse retention and improve the quality of ICU patient care. Objectives: To examine the impact of an education initiative for novice ICU nurses on work engagement for the ICU nursing staff and organisational resource use. Methods: A pre -post design was used to collect data from all ICU nurses at the start of the education programme and at 6 months following he intervention. Work engagement was measured using the self-report 17 item Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) [4] with an open question to capture staff experiences. Organisational impact was measured using levels of sick leave, % staff turnover, use of agency nurses and staff recruitment. Results: Fifty three ICU nurses completed the pre-intervention survey (61 % response) and 42 completed the post-intervention survey (46 % response). Respondents had reasonable years of ICU experience (Mean7.57, SD 8.1) and time in current post (Mean6.21, SD 8.2). Internal consistency for the UWES was high (alpha .91). Levels of work engagement (Mean [SD]) increased (3.94, [0.64] vs 4.03 [0.69]) but did not reach significance and remained in the 'average' band as judged by the scale authors [4] . When examined by senior and junior nurses, the increase was similar. Organisational measures showed decrease in sick leave, turnover, agency use and increase in recruitment of experienced ICU nurses. Qualitative feedback was positive, with perceptions of improvement in unit morale due to time being invested in the individual and reduced stress and workload for shift leaders. Conclusions: Providing education for the newest ICU recruits can have benefits for the whole ICU team. However, it is important to examine how work engagement might be further improved.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1401, "end": 1404, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1536, "end": 1539, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2831, "end": 2834, "text": "(2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2835, "end": 2837, "text": "3)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6148, "end": 6151, "text": "(1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6152, "end": 6154, "text": "2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 8736, "end": 8739, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 8740, "end": 8742, "text": "2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 8796, "end": 8799, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 8882, "end": 8885, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 9523, "end": 9526, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 10199, "end": 10202, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 159, "end": 164, "text": "Taggu", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7265, "end": 7274, "text": "Figure 18", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "A864"}, {"text": "The incidence of silent aspiration on intensive care N. Maistry Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, Rehabilitation and Therapies, London, United Kingdom Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):A872 Introduction: The incidence of Dysphagia on intensive care is an area of growing research. Dysphagia is associated with aspiration pneumonia and increased ICU bed days. In general, Speech and Language Therapy (SLT), makes recommendations based on the results of a clinical bedside swallowing evaluation, despite the unreliability of this method 1. This is largely due to the difficulty accessing gold standard assessment methods such as Videofluoroscopy (VF) and Fibreoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES)3. Referral for these assessment methods are based on a local defined criteria. This study evaluates the incidence of silent aspiration identified by VF and FEES in a 20 bedded tertiary Cardio-Respiratory Intensive Care Unit. Objectives: To determine the incidence of silent aspiration, defined as \"aspiration before, during, or after swallowing in the absence of cough or visible signs of choking and distress 2,\" in ICU patients assessed by VF or FEES between July 2014 and June 2015. Method: Data was retrospectively reviewed for 12 month period from all ICU referrals made to SLT for swallowing evaluation. All patients received a clinical bedside swallowing evaluation. The results are presented as percentages and counts for patients receiving VF and FEES that silently aspirated. Results: A total of 97 patients were referred for swallowing assessment and 35 % (34/97) had a VF or FEES. There were 27 males and ages were 44.1 \u00b1 15.7 years. In this group, 22 patients had Videofluoroscopic assessments and 12 patients had FEES. In the VF group 77 % silently aspirated whilst in the FEES group the values were 83 %. 27 patients (79 %) silently aspirated during objective assessment, impacting on how and when oral feeding was commenced. Conclusion: This study suggests that silent aspiration is highly prevalent in this population group. Consequently, VF and FEES should be part of standard routine assessment in the management of critically ill patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A872"}, {"text": "Delerium related incidents at the ICU and nursing aspects A. van Introduction: At the ICU of VU University Medical Center (VUmc) nurses are frequently confronted with delirium 1,2 . Delirium is known to be present in 60-80 % of mechanical ventilated patients and 20-50 % in non-ventilated patients. Immediate consequences are falling incidents or for patients to remove tubes and IV lines that are necessary for treatment. In literature, this is stated as a result of treatment, but often data is missing. Consequences of removal are increased risk of complications 3 , prolonged mechanical ventilation, LOS and increased morbidity/mortality 4 . Objectives: To measure the frequency of removing tubes, lines and falling incidents related to delirium. Methods: A multidisciplinary focus group was formed (2014) in order to properly diagnose, prevent and/or treat delirium due to the high prevalence. The first steps were increasing awareness and implementing the CAM-ICU score. To clarify delirium-related incidents a one year period was set in which the dedicated senior nurse informed and trained the nursing staff regarding delirium and potential risks. To register delirium-related incidents a modified report button was built in the EPR (Metavision, IMD Soft) and used beside the regular incident reporting system 5 . Results: After one year, 52 individual patient incidents were reported concerning falling or tube or IV line removal. This included 14 gastric tubes, 15 airway tubes, 14 IV/CVC/arterial lines, 5 other lines and 4 fall incidents. In 83 % of the cases the patient was diagnosed with delirium. 4 out of 5 patients received medication or were fixated before the incident despite a 40 % CAM-ICU registration rate. Because the focus group doubted about underreporting 10 nurses were interviewed if the results corresponded with their experience. They were unanimous that there was hardly any underreporting. Discussion: Despite therapy or fixation delirium-related incidents occur on a weekly basis at our ICU, causes harm and increases nursing workload. Although the incidence rate is presumed to be low, there is no feeling of satisfaction. Further improvement is necessary due to the high risks for the patient. Therefore, we need to be able to diagnose incidents faster so we can start treatment sooner. Although the CAM-ICU score was implemented, compliance is insufficient. Increasing compliance is the first step to further improvement. The follow-up question is whether delirium-related injury can be reduced when CAM-ICU compliance improves.

We defined extreme hyperbilirubinemia as a state of total bilirubin above 20 mg/dl and selected all patients whose serum total bilirubin increased above 20 mg/dl at least once during their stay in the intensive care unit. We investigated the overall clinical course of the patients and compared the differences between one group with normalization of total bilirubin (recovery group) and the other group without normalization (non-recovery group). Furthermore, we evaluated the association between prognosis and various clinical factors, including the peak total bilirubin levels, increasing rate of total bilirubin (Vi), results of laboratory analyses related to hepatic function, and clinical features at the time of extreme hyperbilirubinemia. These data were analyzed using Chi-square test and Cox and logistic regression analyses. Introduction: Propofol is widely used in critical care sedation due to its pharmacological properties which allow serial neurological examination (1) .Hypo tension is a common side effect of propofol infusion, which affect patient outcome. Introduction: Propofol is a common intravenous drug used during anesthetic induction and sedation because of its rapid onset and short duration. Its downfall, however, is that patients experience injection pain so severe that they recall induction as the most painful part of the sedation process. Among numerous reports in efforts to decrease propofol injection pain, the most effective combination of drug and non-drug intervention evaluated through a quantitative systematic review revealed to be pretreatment with 0.5 mg/kg lidocaine in combination with a tourniquet for venous occlusion. The majority of these reports conclude that a single method is insufficient in eliminating propofol injection pain. Objectives: We evaluated the effect of heated carrier fluids (40\u00b0C) in decreasing propofol injection pain. Methods: A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in 90 patients (ASA 1 or 2), ages 18 to 65. Patients were allocated into 3 groups (n = 30) each. Group W received 200 ml of heated carrier fluids for 20 minutes prior to 2 mg/kg propofol injection; group L received 200 ml of heated carrier fluids for 20 minutes prior to lidocaine pretreatment and 2 mg/kg propofol injection: and group C (control group) received 200 ml of room temperature fluids prior to 2 mg/kg propofol injection. Propofol injection pain was evaluated using the verbal pain score (VPS). Results: Group W and L showed significant reduction in the incidence and severity of injection pain compared to group C (P < 0.05). VPS was significantly lower in group W (p = 0.018) and L (p = 0.036) compared to group C. There was no statistical difference between group W and group L (p = 0.3). There was statistically significant difference in mean blood pressures measured after 2 mg/kg propofol injection among groups.

Introduction: Whereas the importance of low tidal volume to avoid ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) in patients with ARDS is well known, several uncertainties still exist regarding how to set positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Many approaches have been considered, but no one showed a clear effectiveness in terms of outcome. Recently a ventilator strategy using esophageal pressure to estimate the transpulmonary pressure has been proposed by Talmor and colleagues 1. Although they found an improvement in arterial oxygenation, it was not explored whether the increase in oxygenation was due to lung recruitment. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess whether the PEEP set to maintain a positive end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure (P L ) is associated with an increase in lung recruitment estimated by lung ultrasound score (LUS) 2 . Methods: 12 patients with moderate and severe ARDS were enrolled. For the first 2 hours, PEEP was set according to the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network standard-of-care recommendations (phase A). It was then adjusted according to measurements of esophageal pressure for the following 2 hours (phase B) to maintain a positive P L at the end of expiration. The primary end point was the improvement in lung recruitment assessed with lung ultrasound. [2] No data are available on the relationship between opening pressures and disease severity. Objectives: To describe lung recruitment as a function of the transpulmonary pressure in mild, moderate and severe ARDS. Methods: ARDS patients underwent a low-dose end-expiratory CT scan at PEEP 5 cmH 2 O and three end-inspiratory CT scans at the plateau pressures reached starting from PEEP 5 cmH 2 O, 30 cmH 2 O and 45 cmH 2 O. In each of the CT slices, lung profiles were manually delineated, excluding hilar structures. Thereafter, quantitative analysis of CT scan images was performed and the gas and tissue fractions were computed. We defined the recruitability as the difference of not inflated tissue between 45 and 5 cmH 2 O, that we arbitrarily assumed to be the \"full recruitment\". [3] The grams of recruited tissue were computed across the pressure intervals at which the CT scan were performed, as the differences of not aerated tissue. Airway and esophageal pressures were continuously measured and transpulmonary pressure was computed as: Driving airway pressure (cmH 2 O) -(esophageal plateau pressure (cmH 2 O) -esophageal end-expiratory pressure at PEEP (cmH 2 O) [1] . Results: Thirty-three patients were studied, 5 with mild, 10 with moderate and 18 with severe ARDS, according to the Berlin definition. [2] As reported in the Table 20 and Fig. 23 , the amount of tissue which can be opened between 30 and 45 cmH 2 O was 8 %, 17 % and 37 % respectively in mild, moderate and severe ARDS). Mild ARDS patients nearly completed recruitment at approximately 15 cmH 2 O transpulmonary pressure while in moderate and severe ARDS recruitment continues up to 26 cmH 2 O transpulmonary pressure. Conclusions: At the clinically recommended plateau pressure of 30 cmH 2 O, in severe ARDS, up to 1/3 of the lung tissue recruitable at 45 cmH 2 O, stays always closed. Beyond contributing to the gas exchange impairment (depending on the perfusion), these \"always\" collapsed regions may also act as stress risers at their interface with aerated regions, though they are theoretically protected from the mechanical ventilation. Introduction: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a rescue therapy for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by providing additional oxygenation, and removing carbon dioxide thus permitting less injurious mechanical ventilation settings that have been shown to protect the lungs from additional injury. Objectives: To evaluate associations between distinct ventilator settings during ECMO, and outcome of ARDS patients. Methods: Individual patient data analysis of observational studies in adult ARDS patients receiving ECMO for refractory hypoxemia. Multilevel multivariable logistic regression models and Cox-proportional hazards models were used to determine which settings and parameters had an independent association with the primary endpoint all-cause mortality. Results: Nine studies with 545 patients were selected ( Figure 24 ). Initiation of ECMO was accompanied by significant decreases in tidal volume, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), plateau pressure (Pplat), and driving pressure (\u0394P = Pplat -PEEP), respiratory rate and minute volume (Figure 25 ), and resulted in higher PaO 2 to FiO 2 ratios, higher arterial pH and lower PaCO 2 ( Figure  26 ). Higher age, lower body mass index, and higher lactate were associated with all-cause mortality after multivariable adjustment. \u0394P, both before and during the first three days of ECMO, demonstrated an independent association with all-cause mortality ( Conclusions: In this series of ARDS patients receiving ECMO for refractory hypoxia, \u0394P and FiO 2 were the only ventilatory variables that had an independent association with outcome. These findings indicate the potential for improvement in the management of patients with ARDS undergoing ECMO. Lungs were analysed for wet-to-dry ratio, BAL protein, static compliance, SpO 2 and histology. To detect the timing of injury, rats received Evans Blue dye (EBD-30 mg/kg IV) at the initiation and were euthanized immediately before lung deflation or at 2, 5, 10 or 20 min afterwards (4/group). Terminal BAL analysed for EBD absorbance. Ultrastructural impact was studied by electron microscopy on lungs sampled from rats euthanized before deflation, and at 1 and 5 min after deflation.

Targeted intervention with \u03b2-blockade to 'de-stress' such patients may be beneficial. We developed a 72-h rodent model of fluid-resuscitated faecal peritonitis in which mortality (occurring between 18 and 42 h) can be predicted at 6 h by a low stroke volume (AUROC 0.87), and where survivors are clinically improving by study end. [1] Objectives: To investigate the impact of \u03b2-blockade on outcomes in predicted survivors and nonsurvivors of faecal peritonitis. Methods: Instrumented, fluid resuscitated, male Wistar rats (300-400 g) had sepsis induced by intraperitoneal injection of faecal slurry (8.5 ml/kg). At 6 h, under brief isoflurane sedation, echocardiography was performed to differentiate predicted survivors from nonsurvivors based on a stroke volume cut-off of 0.20 ml. Rats in each prognostic group were then randomised to receive either esmolol (500 \u03bcg/kg over 1 min followed by 75 \u03bcg/kg/min infusion) or matching placebo (0.9 % NaCl) until 24 h. Animals were observed for up to 72 h, and time of death was recorded. The study was powered to detect a mortality reduction in predicted nonsurvivors from 90 % to 45 % with esmolol, with a power of 0.80 and type-1 error of 0.05. Results: 64 rats were randomised after prognostication to receive either esmolol or placebo. At 6 h, predicted survivors and nonsurvivors were clinically indistinguishable (both groups appeared only mildly unwell), though predicted nonsurvivors (stroke volume < 0.20 ml) had lower cardiac output (86 \u00b1 9 vs. 130 \u00b1 25 ml/min), higher heart rate (487 \u00b1 36 vs. 459 \u00b1 24 bpm) and blood pressure (131 \u00b1 12 vs. 125 \u00b1 10 mmHg) and more haemoconcentration (haemoglobin 16.9 \u00b1 1.6 vs. 15.0 \u00b1 1.3 g/dl) (all p < 0.05).

Mechanisms by which esmolol impact upon mortality are under investigation. Introduction: Endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides, LPS) have become interesting targets in extracorporeal therapies. LPS is a major constituent of the outer cell wall of gram-negative bacteria and strongly triggers inflammatory responses in humans at concentrations as low as 1 ng/kg body weight. Although the elimination of LPS is promising for the supportive therapy of sepsis and liver failure, endotoxin neutralization using endotoxin adsorbents is controversial.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A896"}, {"text": "Objectives: We could recently show that endotoxin inactivation by low-dose Polymyxin B (PMB; 200 ng/ml) could be applied for endotoxin inactivation in blood [1] . Aim of this study was to establish an adsorbent-based system which combines constant PMB release for endotoxin inactivation and effective cytokine adsorption during extracorporeal treatment. Methods: We established an adsorbent-based PMB release system which ensures a constant PMB level in plasma during extracorporeal therapies. A polystyrene-divinylbenzene based cytokine adsorbent (CG161c) with nanostructured pores was coated with a defined amount of PMB by hydrophobic interactions. The endotoxin inactivation and cytokine adsorption was tested in an in vitro model using fresh donated blood which was stimulated with 1 ng/ml lipopolysaccaride from E. coli. Results: In plasma or blood an equilibration between the free and bound form of PMB will lead to a constant PMB level in plasma. The PMB release experiments in plasma clearly show that the adsorption and desorption is a function of the ratio PMB concentration: adsorbent surface. Furthermore the PMB release depends on the protein concentration of the plasma. It makes a big difference whether the PMB coated adsorbent is used in plasma or in fractionated plasma where the hydrophobicity is much lower. The experiments suggest that the PMB coating of the CG161c adsorbent doesn\u00b4t influence the cytokine removal which can take place in parallel. The ability of LPS inactivation by the PMB coated CG161c adsorbents was similar to PMB which was infused directly into the plasma. Conclusions: Our in vitro model shows that the combination of cytokine removal and controlled PMB release by the same adsorbent results in a strong suppression of inflammatory effects in blood. Objective: Management of hemodynamically stable pulmonary embolism (PE) with right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is still controversial. The objective of our study is to evaluate the effectiveness of local intraarterial thrombolysis (LIT) in this group of patients and analyze its complications. Patients and methods: Prospective study (January 2008-December 2105). Patients included had been diagnosed of PE by computed tomography (CT), were hemodynamically stable [systolic arterial pressure (SAP) > 90 mmHg] and had a clinical suspicion of RV dysfunction (biventricular quotient in CT > 1 or elevated levels of troponin I), that was confirmed afterwards by the presence of at least one of the following findings in the echocardiogram: subjective alteration of RV contractility, RV basal diameter (four chamber view) > 40 mm, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) < 15 mm or estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) > 30 mmHg. LIT was done with a urokinase infusion (bolus dose of 200.000 UI followed by a perfusion of 100.000 UI/h) administered thru a pulmonary artery catheter, placed with radiological guidance, using an antecubital puncture. Patients received simultaneous systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin. After 48-72 h of treatment, and before ending the urokinase infusion, a radiological control was done using angiography or CT. Within the seven days after LIT, patients underwent a follow-up echocardiogram. Statistical analysis was performed with Student\u00b4s T test for parametric paired data, Wilcoxon\u00b4s Test for non parametric and Stuart-Maxwell for qualitative values. Results: Eighty-seven patients were included and their general data are detailed in Fig. 32 . Mean treatment time was 56,3 \u00b1 15,5 h. Ninety percent of patients experienced a radiological improvement (50.5 % a complete/almost complete resolution and, 37.8 % a significant improvement). Only 5,7 % didn\u00b4t improve radiologically. The evolutions of the different RV parameters studied are shown in Fig. 33 . Minimum fibrinogen and platelet values where 251,9 \u00b1 91,8 mg/dl and 134 x 10 3 \u00b1 44.6 x 10 3 cells/mm 3 . Eighteen patients (20,7 %) suffered form hemorrhagic complications that, in 13 cases, where puncture site hematomas and, in six occasions (6,9 %) required an early interruption of the treatment. Three patients (3,4 %) received a blood cell transfusion of \u2264 2 blood units. Mean ICU and hospital stays where 4 \u00b1 1,5 and 14 \u00b1 9,2 days. All patients survived. Conclusion: In our group of patients, LIT rapidly improved the function and decreased the hemodynamic strain of the RV, while being associated with a low incidence of major complications.

Introduction: Patients in critical care settings are often at risk of developing hypotension, which can lead to poor outcomes such as increased morbidity and mortality. Current hemodynamic parameters for monitoring such hypotension often exhibit pronounced changes only when the hypotensive event is already occurring or when it is too late. We have developed a hypotension probability indicator (HPI\u2122) to predict hypotensive episodes based on machine learning techniques. The HPI\u2122 model was trained on~3000 ICU and OR patients. The objective of this study is two-fold: 1) To test the accuracy of HPI\u2122 to predict events on a completely independent test data set of ICU patients, not used in the development of the algorithm; and 2) To compare timing of interventions in response to an event to the timing of detection of an event by HPI\u2122.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "References"}, {"text": "Methods: Data used in this study came from the MIMIC II MIT Research Database. Arterial pressure waveforms of 326 patients were analyzed for HPI\u2122 and then tested for event detection and prediction accuracy. All features of the HPI\u2122 as well as other hemodynamic parameters for comparison were calculated using FloTrac (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA). A hypotensive event was defined as any time period where MAP < 65 mmHg for at least 1 minute. An ROC analysis was performed to assess AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of the HPI\u2122 to identify an event during the event, and 5, 10, and 15 minutes prior to the start of event. Next, clinical records of the 326 patients were reviewed for any drug or fluid interventions during start of event to 5 minutes after an event and the elapsed time from start of event to intervention time was calculated. A drug or fluid intervention was defined as any bolus or IV infusion start. In addition, the time at which HPI\u2122 probability of event > 0.85 prior to the start of an event was also calculated for comparison. Data are presented in median [25-75 th percentiles]. Conclusion: In conclusion, HPI\u2122 can accurately detect an event up to 15 minutes prior. HPI\u2122 may serve as a useful addition in the care of critically ill patients by potentially facilitating earlier intervention either in response to an event or serve as a decision support and direct a physician's attention to potential oncoming events when HPI\u2122 is high. This statement is valid for both in-hospital as well as out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Regardless of the location of the cardiac arrest, there are at least four factors that appear to be of major importance for survival. The first is the time from collapse to delivery of treatment; the second is the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR); the third is the patient's co-morbidity and the fourth is the aetiology of the CA and the presenting rhythm. The present study will focus on the first three parts of the chain of survival, time from collapse to call/CPR/defibrillation. Objectives: To describe the number of survivors following inhospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) in Sweden during one year and, based on estimations and assumptions, calculate the potential number of additional lives saved following improvements in the chain of survival. There was a strong inverse relation between delay to call for the rescue team and delay to treatment and survival. If delay from collapse to a/call and, b/start of CPR were reduced to < 1 minute in patients with a longer delay than that and if c/time from collapse to defibrillation was reduced to < 3 minutes among those with a longer delay than that: a/57; b/32; and c/35 further lives could potentially be saved.

Methods: A prospective observational study between 2009-2011 in a Finnish university hospital. We included all adult IHCA patients on general wards who were attended by ICU\u00b4s medical emergency team. Definite aetiology was determined from the autopsy records and medical records. No autopsies were conducted solely for study purposes. The local Ethics Committee approved the study protocol (Approval no: R08116). Results: The cohort consisted of 279 patients, of which 185 (66 %) were male. Median age of the patients was 72 (64, 80) years. Altogether 178 (64 %) IHCAs were monitored/witnessed, first rhythm was shockable in 42 (15 %) cases and 53 (19 %) patients survived six months. Autopsy was conducted in 153 (55 %) cases. Aetiology was determined as cardiac in 141 events, 73 of which were due to acute myocardial infarction and 26 due to acute myocardial ischaemia without infarction. Congestive heart failure was the third most prevalent reason in cardiac sub cohort (16). Altogether 138 IHCAs were considered non-cardiac; most common causes were pneumonia (39), exsanguination (16), pulmonary embolism (12) and peritonitis (11). Cardiac IHCAs were more commonly preceded by subjective symptoms (e.g. chest pain, respiratory distress) than non-cardiac IHCAs (47 % vs. 32 %, p = 0.022), while objective vital dysfunctions preceded IHCAs as often in both sub cohorts (40 % vs. 44 %, p = 0.448).

Introduction: Although prolonged unconsciousness after cardiac arrest (CA) is a sign of poor neurological outcome, limited evidence shows that a late recovery may occur in a minority of patients. Objectives: We investigated the prevalence and the predictive factors of delayed awakening in comatose CA survivors treated with targeted temperature management (TTM). Methods: Retrospective analysis of the Parisian Region Out-of-Hospital CA Registry (2008-2013). In adult comatose CA survivors treated with TTM, sedated with midazolam and fentanyl, time to awakening was measured starting from discontinuation of sedation at the end of rewarming. Awakening was defined as delayed when it occurred after more than 48 h. Results: A total of 326 patients (71 % male, mean age 59 \u00b1 16 years) were included, among whom 194 awoke. Delayed awakening occurred in 56/194 (29 %) patients, at a median time of 93 h (IQR 70-117) from discontinuation of sedation. In 5/56 (9 %) late awakeners, pupillary reflex and motor response were both absent 48 h after sedation discontinuation. In multivariate analysis, age over 59 years (OR 2.1, 95 % CI 1.0-4.3), postresuscitation shock (OR 2.6 [1.3-5.2]), and renal insufficiency at admission (OR 3.1 [1.4-6.8]) were associated with significantly higher rates of delayed awakening. Conclusions: Delayed awakening is common among patients recovering from coma after CA. Renal insufficiency, older age, and postresuscitation shock were independent predictors of delayed awakening. Presence of unfavorable neurological signs at 48 h after rewarming from TTM and discontinuation of sedation did not rule out recovery of consciousness in late awakeners.

Introduction: Viral infections play a key role in preventable deaths of children globally, and can be antecedents to bacterial pneumonia and sepsis. Diagnosis of viral infection is often problematic due to non-specific clinical presentation. We developed a host immune response gene expression signature to distinguish systemic inflammation due to viral infection vs. bacterial or noninfectious causes. Objectives: To define and validate the host immune response gene expression signature against multiple independent datasets. Methods: Four public GEO datasets describing transcriptomic responses to viral infection were used to identify biomarkers, ranked by AUC, which could separate affected from unaffected subjects. Biomarkers that also responded (AUC > 0.80) to non-viral causes of systemic inflammation were removed. Remaining biomarkers were then ranked for performance in 10 other GEO transcriptomic datasets for viral infection; those with mean AUC >0.75 were retained. Next, a greedy search was applied to the merged (4 + 10) viral GEO datasets to identify the best combinations of biomarkers for discrimination of viral infection. The signature was then validated using independent datasets. Results: A 4-gene signature (comprised of ISG15, IL16, OASL, ADGRE5) had AUC 0.94 across the merged (4 + 10) viral GEO datasets. This signature was validated in 11 additional GEO datasets covering a wide variety of viral pathogens including a time-course study of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children (Fig 36) , and in two independent datasets of our own: adults from the emergency department (Fig 37 Introduction: Using a tourniquet to temporary cut off blood supply to the arm (Remote Ischemic Preconditioning -RIPC) has been shown to result in myocardial protection and reduced incidence of AKI in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. However, a recently performed large multi-center trial in CABG patients showed no beneficial effects on clinically relevant endpoints [1] . Animal studies have shown an`early window of protection' in the 1-2 hours after RIPC as well as a`late window of protection`12-24 hours after RIPC. Several mechanisms have been suggested to mediate the protective effects of RIPC, of which attenuation of the immune response is an important candidate, although this has hitherto also only been shown in animal studies [2] . Objectives: To determine the effect of single and repeated RIPC, thereby investigating both the early and late windows of protection, on the inflammatory response during endotoxemia, a standardized, controlled model of systemic inflammation in humans in vivo. Methods: We performed a randomized controlled study in 30 healthy non-smoking male volunteers. Subjects were assigned to either the single-dose RIPC group, multiple-dose RIPC group, or the control group (n = 10 per group). The single-dose RIPC group received 1 dose of RIPC, consisting of 4 cycles of 5-minute ischemia of the arm followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion just before administration of 2 ng/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The multiple-dose RIPC group received one dose of RIPC per day on the 6 days before the endotoxemia experiment day, and 1 dose just before LPS administration. Results: LPS administration resulted in a typical increase in body temperature, flu-like symptoms, and hemodynamic changes, with no differences between groups. Administration of LPS resulted in a sharp increase in plasma levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-8 as well as the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10. No differences in plasma levels of these cytokines were observed between the different groups ( Figure 39 ). Conclusions: In the present study, we demonstrate that RIPC does not affect the in vivo inflammatory response induced by administration of endotoxin in humans. These results implicate that RIPC does not exert direct anti-inflammatory effects and that the previously observed protective effects are mediated through other mechanisms. Furthermore, the absence of immunomodulatory effects of RIPC in the present study tempers expectations of using RIPC as an immunomodulatory treatment strategy in patients. Introduction: Sepsis-induced immune alterations are associated with secondary infections and increased risk of death (1).

Introduction: Inhibition of mitochondrial Complex I is described in human and animal sepsis. 1,2 This may be responsible, at least in part, for the decrease in mitochondrial functionality seen in sepsis. We have recently demonstrated that the mitochondrial uncoupling agent, dinitrophenol (DNP) failed to increase body temperature and oxygen consumption (VO 2 ) in septic rats, as was seen in healthy controls. This suggests that uncoupling is active in sepsis and can contribute to fever. We further postulated that the blunted effects of DNP in sepsis may be related in part to upstream mitochondrial inhibition.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Host Response In Sepsis"}, {"text": "Objectives: To determine if complex I inhibition by metformin in healthy rats can prevent the increment in temperature and oxygen consumption (VO 2 ) by DNP, and thus mimic the pattern seen in sepsis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Host Response In Sepsis"}, {"text": "Methods: VO 2 was measured in awake, cannulated male Wistar rats (approx 300 g body weight) in metabolic cages (Oxymax, Columbus Instruments).

Introduction: According the consensus conference on weaning from mechanical ventilation, intubated patients should pass a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) to assess their readiness to be extubated. Objectives: To characterize patients who are extubated without any SBT and to compare them to patients who had at least 1 SBT during their weaning period. Methods: The prospective multicentre observational WIND (Weaning accordIng New Definition) study was performed from April to August 2013. Ventilation and weaning modalities were daily assessed until discharge in all intubated patients admitted to the participating ICUs. We defined 1) weaning attempt (WA) as a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) or an extubation (with or without SBT), 2) successful weaning as an extubation without death or invasive mechanical ventilation within 7 days. Variables are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation, median [interquartile range] or number (percentage). Comparisons were made using Chi2 test, exact Fisher tests, Student t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test as appropriate. All statistical tests were two-sided and P value \u2264 0.05 were considered significant. Results: Among the 2729 patients included, 2051 patients had at least 1 WA comprising 1669 patients whose first WA was a SBT and 382 who had another type of first WA. These 382 patients with no SBT had a total of 454 WA: 252 (55.6 %) planned extubation without SBT, 124 self-extubations (27.3 %), 30 WA while tracheostomized (6.6 %) and 48 SBT after their first WA (10.6 %). The majority of patients with self-extubation had a successful weaning not requiring reintubation (75.8 %). Almost a quarter (n = 95) of the patients who were extubated without any SBT had a decision of withholding or withdrawing invasive mechanical ventilation, representing 89.7 % (N = 78) of the 87 deceased patients. We then excluded patients with a decision of limitation and patients with a self extubation to compare patients who had a planned extubation with or without SBT as first WA (Table 22) . Patients with no SBT were younger, less severe and were more often admitted for unplanned surgery: they had an easier weaning with a lower (but non significative) rate of reintubation, a shorter duration of invasive mechanical ventilation and a shorter length of stay in the ICU. Conclusion: Patients who are extubated without SBT seem to belong to three different groups: self-extubation, terminal extubation and patients in whom physicians anticipate an uneventful weaning and extubation. Among the patients with a planned extubation and without any limitation decision, clinical judgment regarding weanability appears to be effective as this group of patients had a good outcome with a low reintubation rate.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2283, "end": 2293, "text": "(Table 22)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Host Response In Sepsis"}, {"text": "This study benefited of a grant of the non-profit Association D\u00e9partementale des Insuffisants Respiratoires (ADIR) of the Haute Normandie, France Introduction: Decrease in diaphragmatic maximal relaxation rate (MRR) occurs early in the process of diaphragmatic fatigue and well before the diaphragm fails as a force generator; its measurement would, therefore, be especially valuable in ICU patients during a weaning trial.

Introduction: Continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) allows real-time monitoring critically-ill patients neurophysiology and to detect non-clinical seizures in comatose patients, delayed cerebral ischemia after subarachnoid haemorrhage, and guide therapies for status epilepticus. The application of cEEG is still limited because it requires awkward analysis by experienced neurophysiologists of huge amount of EEG tracings. Quantitative EEG (qEEG) techniques, i.e.amplitude integrated EEG (aEEG) and Density Spectra Array (DSA), have been developed to simplify the complexity of EEG interpretation, to allow rapid evaluation of cerebral background electrical activity and the power spectrum of the EEG frequencies derived from raw data EEG. These developments offer the potentiality to transform an instrument interpreted by neurophysiologist afterwards in a monitoring tool useful to ICU staff. Objectives: To test the hypothesis that EEG-nonexpert neurointensivists can obtain real-time reliable information from qEEG after training under the supervision of an in-house neurophysiologist. To describe the implementation of qEEG monitoring in 2 neurointensive care units. Methods: The implementation occurred in sequential phases. cEEG was recorded using 8 surface electrodes according to the international 10-20 system, on a bipolar longitudinal montage in patients with brain injury. qEEG-na\u00efve neurointensivists, after a short training from a neurophysiologist followed by daily supervision for the study period, were subjected to a baseline test evaluating aEEG and DSA traces. Each panel consisted of raw EEG data and 3 qEEG tools: the color density spectral array (DSA), amplitude integrated EEG (aEEG) and the burst suppression rate (BSR). After this evaluation, daily qEEG evaluation was performed by the neurointensivists and reviewed by the neurophysiologist.

Andersen 1,2 , T. Introduction: Tracheal intubation is common during pediatric inhospital cardiac arrest, although the relationship between intubation during cardiac arrest and outcomes is unknown. Objective: To determine if intubation during pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest is associated with improved outcomes. Methods: This was an observational study of prospectively collected data from United States hospitals participating in the Get With the Guidelines -Resuscitation registry. We included pediatric patients (age < 18 years) with index in-hospital cardiac arrest. We excluded patients who were receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and/or had an invasive airway in place at the time chest compressions were initiated. The exposure was tracheal intubation during the cardiac arrest. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included return of spontaneous circulation and neurological outcome. A favorable neurological outcome was defined as a score of 1-2 on the pediatric cerebral performance category score. Patients being intubated at any given minute (from 0 to 15 minutes) were matched with patients at risk of being intubated within the same minute (i.e. still receiving resuscitation) based on a timedependent propensity score calculated from multiple patient, event, and hospital characteristics. Modified Poisson regression with adjustment for matching and clustering were then performed to obtain risk ratios. Results: 2294 patients were included. Of these, 1555 (68 %) were intubated during the cardiac arrest. In the time-dependent propensity score-matched cohort (n = 2270), survival was lower in those intubated compared to those not intubated during cardiac .02], p = 0.08) between those intubated and not intubated during cardiac arrest. The association between intubation and decreased survival remained in the majority of our sensitivity and subgroup analyses Conclusions: Tracheal intubation during in-hospital pediatric cardiac arrest was associated with decreased survival to hospital discharge. These findings challenge the present resuscitation paradigm for pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest. Introduction: Substantial proportion of patients who suffered cardiac arrest do not respond to conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Recently, extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) has been introduced as a potentially life-saving procedure in refractory cardiac arrest. Objectives. The aim of our study was to evaluate the relation between ECPR survival, lactate levels and blood pH. Methods: Eligible patients for this analysis had to undergo ECPR after at least ten minutes of unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation with a minimum of three defibrillation attempts. For extracorporeal life support (ECLS) we used Cardiohelp system (Maquet, Germany) or Levitronix CentriMag blood pump (Levitronix, USA). LUCAS II system (PhysioControl, Sweden) was used for chest compressions during ECLS insertion and cannulas were placed with percutaneous puncture under fluoroscopy or ultrasound control. Blood lactate and pH levels measured before ECLS insertion and after 24 hours were used for this study. Results: We analyzed data from 29 patients treated with ECPR for refractory cardiac arrest. The mean age of our patients was 57 years (31-81). Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest occurred in 16 patients, 13 patients suffered from in-hospital arrest. Thirty-day mortality in our group was 57 % and 32 % of patients recovered with good neurological outcome. Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in 18 (67 %) patients. Baseline value of lactate was 11.52 \u00b1 5.42 mmol/l, initial pH 6.97 \u00b1 0.21. In comparison with survivors, patients who died had significantly higher initial lactate levels (15.05 \u00b1 1.56 vs. 10.01 \u00b1 1.03; P < 0.05) and lower baseline pH (6.87 \u00b1 0.06 vs 7.04 \u00b1 0.04; P < 0.05). Moreover, survivors had significantly lower lactate levels after 24 hours. Conclusions: ECPR represents virtually the last chance to survive refractory cardiac arrest. The levels of blood lactate and pH are significantly associated with clinical outcomes of ECPR. Introduction: Post-cardiac arrest survivors treated with therapeutic hypothermia (TH) remain comatose after rewarming. In contrast to survivors without TH, neurological prognostication is imprecise due to a persistent sedative effect [1] . Objectives: We aimed to evaluate clinical signs and findings that could predict neurological recovery and determined the optimal time for prognosis. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed database of 51 post-arrest patients treated with TH in our hospital from 2006 to 2014. Cerebral performance category (CPC), neurological signs and findings in EEG and brain CT were evaluated. Neurological recovery was scored as favorable neurological outcome, namely normal cerebral function(CPC1) and moderate disability(CPC2) or unfavorable neurological outcome, namely severe disability(CPC3), vegetative state(CPC4) and death(CPC5). Neurological signs and findings in EEG and brain CT, which possibly predicted neurological recovery, and the optimal time to evaluate neurological status were analyzed. Results: TH was performed in 51 post-arrest patients. Approximately 53 % (27/51) of TH-patients survived and 33 % of the survivors had favorable neurological outcome. Findings predicting unfavorable outcome at discharge were lack of pupillary response and/or Gag reflex after rewarming, and the absence of at least one of the brainstem reflexes, no eye opening or motor response worse than pain withdrawal (M \u2264 3) on the seventh day. (Table  43 ) Myoclonus and seizure could not be used to indicate poor prognosis. One of 17 survivors with myoclonus had full recovery and 50 % of the survivors with seizures regained consciousness upon discharge. Findings of EEG and brain CT showed that the patients with burst-suppression EEG pattern or brain swelling became vegetative or died, but the prognostic values of these findings were inconclusive. Conclusions: Our study showed that the simple neurological signs helped predict short-term neurological prognosis of comatose survivors undergoing TH. The most reliable signs which determined unfavorable outcome were the lack of the pupillary light response and Gag reflex. The optimal time to assess prognosis was either at 48 to 72 hours or 7 days after return of spontaneous circulation. Physicians can use these neurological signs to evaluate the prognosis of postcardic arrest survivors treated with TH. Objectives: Procalcitonin (PCT) and presepsin are biomarkers associated with severe infections. We asked, if they could be used to reflect the severity of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome and to predict poor outcome. A significantly greater increase in procalcitonin from admission to 24 h was observed in patients with eventual poor outcome compared to those with a favorable one (p < 0.001).

Note: This abstract has been previously published and is available at [2] . It is included here as a complete record of the abstracts from the conference. We analyzed all patients admitted on hospital ward that were assisted by the IHCA team. Patients admitted less than 24 hours on Ward and patients not eligible for resuscitation were excluded. Demographic data (age and gender) were collected. We analyzed the type of patient (medical or surgical), the schedule in which the IHCA happens (weekdays from 8 hours am to 8 hours pm and the rest, every day from 8 hours pm to 8 hours am, weekend and holidays), IHCA witnessed, the IHCA team time reaction, IHCA established or not at IHCA team\u00b4s arrival, return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and Hospital mortality. Statistics:Qualitative variables are expressed as percentages and compared using the X2-test; quantitative ones are expressed as means and standard deviations (\u00b1 S.D), and analyzed using Student\u00b4s t-test. Multivariate logistic regression was performed, with hospital mortality as the dependent variable. The level of significance was placed at p < 0.05.

Introduction: The use of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (va-ECMO) for prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and severe cardiogenic shock after CPR has widely increased (1). Bleeding complications, due to necessary therapeutic anticoagulation and CPR/SIRS induced coagulopathy are common (2) .

We hypothesized that this would be associated with increased motivation to participate in interactive gaming by our patients. Methods: The Wii device was used with 4 different games. Participating patients were offered to play 2 games of their own choice as part of the mobilisation program to improve their strength and coordination. No extensive explanation about the potential usefulness of these interactive games was given to the patients. After finishing the games, a specific survey was administered addressing motivation and affects on mental health. Scores were obtained using a Likert scale (range 1-7). Results are shown as median and interquartile range {P 25 -P 75 ] Results: At the time of abstract submission, 13 participating patients had finished a cycle of 2 games. Some of the patients liked to use the Wii device, particularly because a choice in games made it more interesting to use. Other patients, however, felt they were required to participate. Tennis, bowling and boxing were most frequently used. The use of the Wii was programmed in the daily mobilization schedule together with a physiotherapist, or just with the attending ICU nurse. In general, patients were not that enthusiastic about the Wii-games (median score 2 [1-2]), were not convinced that playing these games improved their well-being (median score 2 [1] [2] [3] [4] ), and most felt that they did not have a choice but to participate (median score 6 [5] [6] [7] ). Conclusion: Interactive gaming with the Wii-device is feasible in ICU patients. However, thorough explanation of the potential usefulness of these games is required to engage and motivate patients to participate. Methods: Descriptive and retrospective study. We include all patients admitted in ICU during 2012 (previous to RRT establishment) and 2015 (year of RRT establishment), and who were discharged to the ward. We analysed the ICU and hospital mortality in both groups. Results: In 2012 we admitted 1296 patients (17,3 % from the ward and 82,7 % from the other places like Emergency, other ICU or other hospitals), with a ICU mortality of 10,4 % and hospital mortality of 15,55 %, with a hospital mortality after ICU discharge of 5,69 %. In 2015 we admitted 1307 patients (14,6 % from the ward and 85,4 % from the other places), with a ICU mortality of 12,6 % and hospital mortality of 15,68 %, and a hospital mortality after ICU discharge of 3,5 % (p = 0.03). Conclusions: After the first year of RRT establishment in our hospital, we appreciate that the continuation of patients after ICU discharge, decrease the hospital mortality ( 5,69 % versus 3,5 %, p = 0.03). The number of patients admitted in ICU from the ward decrease in 2015 (14,6 % versus 17,3 %), maybe because we did a previous assessment of this patients, with a stabilization in the ward and avoiding the ICU admission. Objectives: To identify outcomes and prognostic factors in HM patients admitted over 5-years to a general intensive care unit in a specialist haematology centre. (Figure 76 ). Patients with 3-4 organ failures had significantly worse outcomes than those with 1-2 organ failures (p < 0.0001) OR 13.4 [6.7 -25.0, CI 95 %]. Median APA-CHE II, SOFA and SAPS II scores were 24, 10 and 48, respectively. Median APACHE II (p < 0.05), SOFA (p < 0.04) and SAPS II (p < 0.001) scores were greater in those ventilated for 1-4 days vs. \u22655 days. Conclusions: APACHE II scores and mortality were greater than described in similar HM populations. Given the severity of critical illness in our cohort, we suggest that admission to ICU earlier in the acute illness may improve outcomes. Poorer outcomes were observed in those with >2 organ failures and in ventilated patients. The survival of 1/3 rd of patients on ICU for \u22655 days to hospital discharge suggests that 5-day trials of ICU in HM patients are unlikely to reliably distinguish between survivors and non-survivors. Background: Dedicated intensive care unit (ICU) physician staffing was associated with a reduction of ICU mortality in the general medical and surgical ICU. However, limited data were available on the role of a cardiac intensivist in the cardiac intensive care unit (CCU). We compared the clinical outcomes in adult patients admitted to CCU before and after implementing the cardiac intensivist-directed care. Methods: We enrolled 2,923 consecutive patients admitted to a CCU at Samsung Medical Center, from January 2012 to December 2015. In January 2013, CCU was changed from a low-intensity staffing model to highintensity staffing model which managed by a dedicated cardiac intensivist. We divided eligible patients into low-intensity group (n = 616) and highintensity group (n = 1,815). The primary outcome was CCU mortality. Results: High-intensity group had significantly lower CCU (8.9 % vs 4.1 %; p < 0.001) and hospital (10.9 % vs 6.1 %; p < 0.001) mortality compared to the low-intensity group. The decrease in CCU (54.5 % vs 22.5 %; p = 0.001) and hospital (57.6 % vs 29.4 %; p = 0.003) mortality in high-intensity group were consistent in 135 (low-intensity group 33, high-intensity group 102) patient with profound cardiogenic shock treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed significant higher cumulative survival rates in highintensity group at 1 year follow-up (Log rank test, p < 0.001). CCU (7.6 % vs 5.8 %; p = 0.101) and hospital re-admission rate (7.5 % vs 6.0 %; p = 0.179) were decreased as well after conversion to highintensity although these results were not statistically significant.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 546, "end": 549, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 823, "end": 826, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2284, "end": 2287, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2288, "end": 2291, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2292, "end": 2295, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2296, "end": 2299, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2384, "end": 2387, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2388, "end": 2391, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2392, "end": 2395, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3956, "end": 3966, "text": "(Figure 76", "ref_id": "FIGREF11"}], "section": "A986"}, {"text": "Conclusions: Dedicated cardiac intensivist was associated with reductions of CCU mortality in patient with cardiovascular disease requiring critical care. Introduction: Opioids are commonly given to alleviate pain and distress in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) patients or undergoing major surgery. Previous studies have shown that patients who are already taking opioids prior to surgery or ICU admission are more likely to experience an extended duration of opioid use postoperatively or post-discharge (1). However, it is unknown whether patterns of opioid usage differ between patients who are admitted to the ICU and those undergoing a surgical procedure.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A986"}, {"text": "Objectives: The objective of this study was to describe opioid use in critically ill patients before and after ICU admission and to compare it with preoperative and postoperative opioid use in a surgical population. Methods: Retrospective review and comparison of adult patients admitted to the ICU or undergoing surgery at a tertiary care center between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2008. We divided the populations based on their degree of opioid use into \"non-user\", \"intermittent\", and \"chronic\" opioid users as previously described (1). We assessed opioid use at 3 months prior to ICU admission or surgery, at discharge, and monthly for 6 months thereafter. Patients admitted to ICU who had surgery were categorized under the ICU population. To assess for risk of monthly chronic opioid use, a Cox-Proportional Hazards model was postulated that allowed for recurrent events to account for patients irregularly requiring opioids over the course of the study period. The model showed that the risk of chronic opioid use was 52.2 times greater for those with prior chronic opioid use compared to patients who were non-users. There was no difference in risk of chronic opioid use between the ICU and surgery group. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that ICU and surgical patients have similar risk of prolonged chronic opioid use post-discharge. Chronic opioid use prior to ICU admission or surgery is the strongest predictor of chronic opioid usage at and after discharge.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A986"}, {"text": "A single-centre cohort study of national early warning score (NEWS) and blood gas derived biomarkers in patients with acute medical illness Introduction: Empirical combination antibiotic therapy for treatment of severe sepsis is a matter of debate. The proposed rationale for using a combination of two or more different antimicrobials is several fold. First, it allows for a broader empirical coverage with a higher likelihood of targeting the causative organism. Second, it may decrease the development of resistance to the antibiotics used. Third, a combination of active drugs potentially cause a synergistic effect increasing the efficacy of bacterial eradication. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends combination therapy in some patient populations and certain type of infections but the quality of the evidence supporting empirical combination antibiotic therapy is weak and does not include high quality randomised clinical trials (RCTs). Objectives: To assess benefits and harms of empirical mono-vs. combination antibiotic therapy in adult patients with severe sepsis in the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: We performed a systematic review according to the Cochrane Collaboration methodology, including meta-analysis, risk of bias assessment and trial sequential analysis (TSA). We included RCTs assessing empirical mono-antibiotic therapy versus a combination of two or more antibiotics in adult ICU patients with severe sepsis.

Introduction: De-escalation antibiotic in sepsis is associated with reduced costs and bacterial resistance. However, often it is not done. Objectives: We designed this study with the primary objective to evaluate the prevalence of de-escalation in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock in an academic public hospital in south Brazil. Secondarily we evaluated antibiotic adequacy and cultures positivity. Methods: We analyzed prevalence of de-escalation, antibiotic adequacy and culture positivity in severe sepsis and septic shock patients in an Intensive Care Unit. Results: Of the 224 patients included, de-escalation could have been performed in 29 % of cases (66 patients), but was implemented in only 19 % of cases (44 patients). Among patients who received deescalation, half was for antimicrobial spectrum narrowing. The mortality was not different between patients with or without de-escalation (56.8 % versus 56.1 %, p = 0.999). Empirical antimicrobial therapy was adequate in 89 % of cases. Pathogens were isolate in 30 % of all cultures and 26.3 % of blood cultures. Conclusion: The rate of empiric antibiotic adequacy was high, reflecting active institutional policy of monitoring the epidemiological profile and institutional protocols of antimicrobial use. However, the antimicrobial de-escalation could have been higher than reported. De-escalation did not impact mortality. There are few data in the literature regarding the care of severe sepsis patients in developing countries. This data can contribute to adequate treatment in this scenario. Introduction: Despite recent advances, appropriate initial amikacin dose in critically ill patients is still challenging. Relationship between pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk/pD) parameter peak concentration (Cmax)/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in critically ill patients is not clear. Objectives: We assessed the impact of amikacin pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters on clinical and microbiological outcome in these patients. Methods: Observational prospective study. Adult patients (>18 years) admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with a gram negative documented infection and treatment with amikacin were included (Study period: September 2014 -April 2015). Amikacin blood samples were taken 24 to 72 hours after treatment started. Amikacin concentration were determined using Indiko\u00ae (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and drug adjustment were based on the recommendations given by the Pharmacokinetics Unit (Pharmacy Service). Clinical response, defined as sign and symptoms presented at the moment of infection diagnosis (fever, chest radiography alteration, infection biomarkers elevation and hemodynamic instability), was evaluated. Ji-square and U-Mann Whitney test were used to compare results between treatment responders and notresponders. . Mean initial dose was 1150 mg (SD: 45,9)/day, equivalent to 15.8 (0.6) mg/kg/day. With that dose, 40 patients (83,7 %) reached a Cmax/MIC value higher than 8. Final treatment response was higher for those patients with amikacin Cmax/MIC value >8 (61,0 % vs 12,5 %; p = 0.028). No significant differences were reached in early treatment response (Initial 72 h) (57,5 % vs 37,5 %;p = 0,403) or 30 days mortality (19,5 % vs 37,5 %;p = 0,265). Cmax/MIC values was not associated with toxicity-related treatment discontinuation (17,4 vs 12,5; p = 0,581). Conclusions: Initial Cmax/MIC value is associated with clinical response in those patients treated with amikacin. High initial amikacin dose may be necessary to optimize pk/pD parameters. Method: In a 30 bed mixed ICU from October 1, 2011 to September 30, 2015 nosocomial infections (pneumonia, urinary tract infections, catheter-related bacteremia (CRB) and secondary nosocomial bacteremia) were prospectively collected. ENVIN-HELICS diagnostic criteria were applied. Etiology, inflammatory response to infection, antibiotic treatment (ATB T) and treatment modifications according to culture results, were analyzed. SDD was applied to all admitted patients requiring endotracheal intubation over 48 hours. For each groups categorical variables were summarized as frequencies and percentages and number in means and standard deviations (SD) or median with interquartile ranges (IQR).Percentages were compared, as appropriate, with the Fisher\u00b4s exact test or X 2 test and medians with the Wilcoxon test for independent samples. For those variables that were associated with DE in the univariate analysis were entered into a logistic multidimensional analysis. The model obtained was expressed by p-values and odd-ratios, which were estimated by confidence intervals at 95 %. A hypothesis test was considered statistically significant when p-value was less than .05. Results: Ninety patients (34,8 %) had ATB DE and 168 did not. There were no significant differences in demographics or type of admission in both groups (Fig. 79) . Mortality was lower in patients receiving DE antibiotic (ATB) (23,3 %, p: 0.013). In the multivariate analysis, ICU mortality and urinary tract infection were the only variables found significant (Fig. 80 ) DE was performed in 53 out of 105 (50,4 %) with CRB and in 45 out of 103 (43,6 %) who had nosocomial pneumonia. The ATB T was inadequate in 58 out of 364 infections (15,9 %). Targeted therapy was performed in 136 out of 258 patients (52,7 %) and in 162 out of 364 infections, at least once occasion (44,5 %). Finally, 199 ATB were targeted prescribed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 5265, "end": 5274, "text": "(Fig. 79)", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}, {"start": 5473, "end": 5481, "text": "(Fig. 80", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}], "section": "A991"}, {"text": "In all studied patients with DE, this was performed in 72 patients once, in 13 patients twice and in 3 patients three times. The number of antibiotics used was 668 and ATB DE was performed in 104 occasions. Frequency of ATB used and of theirs DE is shown in Fig. 81 Of note, meropenem was DE in 14,4 %. Conclusions: Patients who received ATB DE compared to those that did not had a significant lower ICU mortality. The factors independently associated to DE were ICU mortality and urinary tract infection. Inadequate ATB T in our ICU occurred in 15.9 % of nosocomial infections. ATB DE was performed in 90 patients. Targeted therapy was applied to 44,5 % of infections. The most commonly used antibiotics were meropenem (12,3 %), levofloxacin (12.2 %) and piperacillin-tazobactam (12,05 %). Meropenem, was DE in 14,4 %. Introduction: Antimicrobial prescription represents a major challenge for clinicians in the daily practice especially in certain difficult clinical scenarios. Thus, in critically ill septic patients, prompt and adequate antimicrobial therapy reduces morbidity and mortality Objectives: We set out to assess the impact on in-hospital of antibiotic de-escalation in patients admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis or septic shock. Methods: Collaborative study enrolling patients admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis or septic shock from two different cohorts. The first one, a Spanish prospective and observational cohort and the second one, a multicenter non-blinded, randomized and non inferiority trial conducted in France. Severity was estimated by the use of the predicted mortality rate at ICU admissionfor every included patientby implementing the likelihood of death logit formule defined according to the APACHE II and SAPS II scores criteria and taking this cuantititative variable into account as a confounder factor in the regression model. De-escalation was defined as discontinuation of an antimicrobial agent or change of antibiotic to one with a narrower spectrum once culture results were available. To control for confounding variables we performed a multivariatebinomial logistic regression analysis adjusted by Wald test. Results: Nine hundred and one patients with severe sepsis or septic shock at ICU admission were treated empirically with broadspectrum antibiotics. Eight hundred and seventeen patients were evaluated (84 died before cultures were available). De-escalation was applied in 274 patients (33.5 %). We found no differences in hospital long of stay between de-escalation group comparedto those who did not received it. We also found a significant lower hospital mortality in de-escalation group in front of the others (25.9 vs. 43.1 %; p < 0.001). By multivariate analysis (adjusted by severity scores-APACHE and SAPS), factors independently associated with in-hospital mortality were age (Odds-Ratio [OR] 1.02; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.03), and SOFA score at ICU admission (OR 1.17; 95 % CI 1.11-1.23), whereas de-escalation therapy was a protective factor (OR 0.50; 95 % CI 0.35 -0.71) as well as urinary focus (OR 0.23; 95 % CI 0.12-0.43). Analysis of the 646 patients with etiological diagnosis revealed that the factors associated with mortality were age and SOFA and conversely de-escalation therapy was a protective factor (OR 0.45; 95 % CI 0.30-0.66) Conclusions: De-escalation therapy for septic critically ill patients is a safe strategy associated with a lower mortality. Efforts to increase the frequency of this strategy are indeed justified. Introduction: At the population level, both vancomycin and aminoglycosides are known to be nephrotoxic. The risk of nephrotoxicity might even be higher when combining the 2 agents together (1). Nonetheless, in septic patients, the benefit in terms of sepsis control may outweight the risk of nephrotoxicity. Thus, being able to appraise the risk/benefit ratio at the patient level would be of great interest to better tailor individual treatment. Objectives: Capitalizing on recent statistical innovations in personnalized medicine, our goal was to develop a patient-centered estimation of the impact of the association vancomycin/aminoglycosides on the kidney function. Methods: Our data come from a cohort study performed between 2000 and 2010 in the departments of anesthesia, critical care and cardiovascular surgery at a French teaching hospital. This study included all consecutive patients operated for an acute endocarditis (2). The primary endpoint was postoperative evolution of the kidney function as evaluated by the AKIN score (Stade 1: elevation in serum creatinine (SrCr) \u2a7e 26.2 \u03bcmol/L or \u2a7e 1,5xbaseline; Stade 2: elevation in SrCr \u2a7e 2xbaseline; Stade 3: elevation in SrCr \u2a7e 3xbaseline or creatinine \u2a7e 354 \u03bcmol/L with increase >44 \u03bcmol/L or need for RRT). The impact of vancomycin/aminoglycosides on kidney function was estimated using targeted maximum likelihood estimation on a risk difference (RD) scale. The association between patient characteristics and the individual effect of the drugs on the kidney function was estimated using conditional recursive partitioning (cTREE). Results: 202 patients were included in the study. Their baseline characteristics are described in Table 53 . At a population level, we confirmed the strong association between vancomycin + aminoglycosides and the risk of kidney dysfunction (RD = 0.54, 95%CI: 0.47-0.61, p < 0.001). However, at the patient level, this effect was very variable and could be predicted based on patients characteristics (r 2 = 0.74) (Figure 82 ). Conclusions: The individual impact of vancomycin + aminoglycosides on kidney function may be very different than the overall effect at the population level. Innovant statistical approaches may be used to identify patients in whom this drug combination is safe, and others in whom it may seriously threaten kidney function. Introduction: Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) is one of the most frequent nosocomial infections in critically ill patients, resulting in a significant increase of morbidity and mortality. That is why it is essential to detect CRBSI precociously so that optimal treatment can be initiated as soon as possible.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 258, "end": 265, "text": "Fig. 81", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 5219, "end": 5227, "text": "Table 53", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 5534, "end": 5544, "text": "(Figure 82", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "A991"}, {"text": "Objective: Our objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of rapid non-invasive tests that may allow clinicians to detect colonisation of the central venous catheter (CVC) as a source of bloodstream infection in critically ill patients, permitting catheter withdrawal and the initiation of early goal-directed antibiotic therapy.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A991"}, {"text": "Methods: Over the course of eight months, we selected for evaluation those critically ill patients admitted to our ICU who developed fever (>38\u00b0C) without source, to whom the clinician in charge decided to withdraw the CVC. Before extraction, we obtained a skin smear at the insertion site, in addition to a catheter-hubs smear. We sent both smears, along with the catheter tip and blood cultures, to the microbiology laboratory. These results indicate that our test has a negative predictive value of 100 %. To evaluate the degree of association between our test and the gold standard, we calculated the contingency coefficient, which resulted in 0,65 out of a maximum 0,7(p < 0,001). This shows the strong validity of the combination of skin and catheter-hub cultures as a diagnostic method for CVC colonisation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A991"}, {"text": "Conclusions: The combination of skin and catheter-hub cultures is a rapid and very effective method for detecting the colonisation of CVC as a possible source of bloodstream infection in critically ill patients. While a negative result, which can be obtained within 24 h, would prevent the need for CVC withdrawal, a positive result would not only enable the removal of the likely source of infection, but it would also allow for, if the intensivist deemed it necessary, the initiation of early goal-directed antibiotic therapy. This would mean, in more than 60 % of cases, starting optimal treatment at least 48 hours prior to the diagnosis of CRBSI from blood cultures. Results: Introduction: Piperacillin/tazobactam (PTZ) is a \u03b2-lactam-\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor combination with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. \u03b2lactams are time-dependent antibiotics and their effectiveness is in association with the duration of free drug concentrations over the minimum inhibitory concentration (t > MIC) of organisms. Prolonged infusion has a pharmacokinetic (PK) advantage compared to intermittent bolus dosing, a continuous infusion lower dose of 8 g PTZ may be as effective as a higher dose of intermittent bolus PTZ. Objectives: In this study we intend to evaluate the continuous infusion of 8/1 grams of PTZ along with a loading dose of 4/0,5 grams in patients admitted in a tertiary ICU. Methods: Between October 2015 and December 2015 eight patients had piperacillin plasma concentration monitored during treatment with continuous PTZ infusion in a monocentric prospective observational study. Patients received a loading dose of 4/0,5 grams of PTZ followed by infusion of 8/1 grams, reconstituted in 90 ml Sodium Chloride 0,9 % and transferred to Braun Space Infusion System\u00ae. The pump had a flow rate of \u00b1 4 ml/h. Blood was always extracted from the contralateral arm to the infusion, over 60 hours at predetermined times. Serum piperacillin/tazobactam concentrations were determined using an HPLC method (2). After extraction, samples (99 \u03bcL) were injected into a XBRIDGE C18 column (Waters, Spain) and were scanned by an UV detector at 220 nm with gradient elution. Mobile phase was composed by acetonitrile and a solution of tetrabutylammonium bisulfate (10 g/ L). Penicillin G was used as internal standard (Sigma Aldrich, Spain). Results: 8 patients have been examined (4 men and 4 women). The average age was 53 \u00b1 22, the weight was 81 \u00b1 22 kg, the creatinine clearance 122 \u00b1 57 mL/min and the Apache II score 21,7 \u00b1 7,3. The mean concentrations of PTZ in serum are represented in the next figures. Conclusions: In this ICU patient group, our results suggest that continuous infusion of PTZ at 8/1 g per day is sufficient to obtain therapeutic plasma-concentrations in critical care patients with infections caused by PTZ sensitive bacteria with a MIC lower than 8 mg/dl. However, in our group there were three patients with levels of 9 mg/dl, which are not sufficient for bacteria with MIC lower than 16 mg/dl; these three patients are neurocritical. In conclusion, further studies in this are needed, especially studies regarding the association between piperacillin therapeutic drug monitoring and clinical outcome. Introduction: Ultrasound guided internal jugular vein cannulation is recommended technique in current anaesthesia and intensive care practice. However, classic short axis view has inherent problem of needle visualization during venous access. In contrast, medial oblique view may enhance needle visibility during venipuncture and decrease overlap between IJV and carotid artery and thereby increase the safety of US guided IJV cannulation (1) (2) . Objectives: To compare the safety and efficacy of medial oblique view and in-plane technique as compared to short axis view and out-of-plane technique during US guided IJV cannulation. Methods: Two hundred patients aged between 18-50 yrs of either sex and American Society of Anesthesiologists' physical status I-II who were undergoing any surgery under general anaesthesia requiring an internal jugular vein cannulation, enrolled for this prospective randomized controlled trial. Three patients were excluded due to US machine malfunction. In patients of group M, IJV cannulation was performed with medial oblique probe position and in plane approach. In patients belonging to group S, IJV cannulation was done in out of plane approach with the US probe in short axis position. Primary outcome was needle and guide-wire visibility during procedure. Results: Needle visibility (entire needle tract and needle tip) was significantly higher during IJV puncture in medial oblique probe position (68 of 98 patients in group M versus 40 of 99 patients in group S; p = 0.00002). Guide wire visibility during insertion was also higher when medial oblique probe position was used (59 of 98 in group M versus 34 out of 99; p = 0.00013).

Introduction: There is a clear rationale for monitoring microcirculatory behaviour during shock since it is the anatomical location of oxygen and substrate exchange, and may not correspond to global haemodynamics. And yet despite over a decade of research and technological advances such monitoring has not reached clinical bedside utility. Analysis of the data is performed offline and too time consuming for clinical use. There is an urgent need for a system to assess the microcirculation at the bedside. We present a novel 5-point grading system (the Point-Of-carE Microcirculation (POEM) scoring system) that can be used at the bedside (using sublingual microcirculatory monitoring).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 537, "end": 539, "text": "3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 540, "end": 541, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A991"}, {"text": "Objectives: To assess the inter-user variability of the novel POEM scoring system amongst doctors and nurses who may use such technology for clinical practice, and to benchmark POEM scores against traditional offline computer analysis.

Thirtytwo na\u00efve study participants from two UK teaching hospitals (Birmingham and London) participated in a standardised 1-hour interactive training session in how to assign POEM scores based on microcirculatory video clips from sublingual incident dark field (IDF) videomicroscopy imaging.

Introduction: Vocal cord palsy is a known postoperative complication following cardiothoracic surgery. 1, 2. Although the incidence is relatively low its existence cannot be ignored and thus its identification necessary in order to avoid any further complications and maintain patient wellbeing. This study aims to look at the incidence of vocal cord palsy following cardiothoracic surgery in a tertiary referral centre and highlight the importance of the speech and language therapist's role in working with this cohort. Objectives: To measure the incidence of vocal cord palsy post cardiac and thoracic surgery and to identify the consequent effects. Methodology. A retrospective analysis, within a tertiary cardiothoracic centre. Data for all patients who underwent either a cardiac or thoracic surgical procedure between December 2015 and April 2016 and were referred to speech and language therapy (SLT) was collected. Vocal cord palsy was identified by Fibreoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) or Bronchoscopy. Results: A total of 25 patients were seen by the SLT. Patients with vocal cord palsy were identified by FEES and Bronchoscopy; 83 % and 17 % respectively. Six patients assessed presented with vocal cord palsy; patients were post cardiac surgery (4/6) and post thoracic surgery (2/6). The consequence of vocal cord palsy was dysphonia in all the patients and dysphagia in two thirds of patients. The median duration that patients experienced dysphagia was 12 days (range 4-38 days) and dysphonia was 21 days (range 11-38). Conclusion: This review highlights the high prevalence of vocal cord palsy post cardiothoracic surgery. Vocal cord palsy led to high levels of dysphagia and dysphonia. Early identification of these is imperative to ensure patient safety and optimise recovery and quality of life. 7) . 20.4 % were over 75 years old at the moment of the surgery.

Introduction: Sepsis has recently been redefined as\u00b4life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infec-tion\u00b4. It is one of the leading causes of mortality internationally. Earlier identification of sepsis means more timely management, reduced length of hospital admission, and prevention of septic shock; ultimately reducing sepsis associated mortality. (1) There is currently no standard diagnostic test for sepsis. Distinguishing sepsis from alternative, uncomplicated infections is pertinent to ensuring an appropriate clinical approach. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria have been used since 1992 to define sepsis (Sepsis 1.0). However they have been found to lack sensitivity or specificity. The quick sequential organ failure assessment score (qSOFA) is an emerging initial assessment method that uses three simple bedside criteria to measure organ dysfunction; altered mental status, respiratory rate \u226522 and systolic blood pressure \u2264100 mmHg. The aim is to facilitate earlier recognition of sepsis outside of ITU by prompting the clinician to think, and adequately screen for sepsis. In 14 cases, the diagnosis of pneumococcal meningitis by culture or pneumococcal CRP in CSF was confirmed. In all cases, pneumococcus antigen was positive. Therefore, there were no false negatives. In 59 cases pneumococcal meningitis was not diagnosed, being the final diagnosis a non-pneumococcal bacterial meningitis or another pathology. In all cases, pneumococcus antigen was negative. Therefore, there were no false positives. In conclusion, in our sample of 72 patients, the sensitivity and specificity of the test for S. pneumoniae antigen in CSF was 100 %.

Introduction: Critical illness-acquired myopathy in rats is characterized by homogeneous muscle atrophy (1). Conversely, histological abnormalities are heterogeneous: oxidative muscles show patchy alterations (myofascitis, necrosis), while glycolytic types demonstrate normal patterns. Akt and mTOR are key proteins of the anabolic pathway, leading to myocyte growth when activated. Conversely, AMPK and FoxO3 are key proteins of the catabolic pathway, leading to myocyte atrophy when activated. Whether anabolic or catabolic pathway activation is dependent on skeletal muscle type (i.e. oxidative and glycolytic) during critical illness is unknown. Objectives: To characterize activation of the anabolic and catabolic signalling pathways in a long-term rat peritonitis model by skeletal muscle type. Methods: Male Wistar rats were followed for up to 2 weeks after intraperitoneal injection of the yeast cell wall constituent, zymosan or n-saline. Soleus (oxidative, slow twitch muscle), and gastrocnemius (mixed glycolytic-oxidative, fast twitch muscle) were harvested from both zymosan and control groups at 2, 7 and 14 days after the insult. Expression of phospho-(p-) and total proteins were assessed by Western blots. Expression of Akt, p-Akt (p-threonine 308, active form), mTOR, p-mTOR (p-serine 2448, active form), AMPK, p-AMPK (pthreonine 172, active form), FoxO3, and p-FoxO3 (p-threonine 32, inactive form) were assessed at all time points.

Introduction: Esophageal pressure (P es ) guided setting of PEEP has been described in ARDS patients 1 either to avoid expiratory alveolar collapse 2 or to promote maximum inspiratory recruitment 3 . The proportion of ARDS patients that may benefit from maximum recruitment strategy and its effects regarding dead space (V D /V T ), shunt, driving pressure (DP), transpulmonary driving pressure (TPDP) and expiratory transpulmonary pressure (TPP exp ) remain unclear. Methods: We included moderate and severe ARDS patients under mechanical ventilation and paralyzed, in the first 12 hours after reaching ARDS criteria. Patients were monitored with esophageal balloon catheter and ventilated with EXPRESS study settings for 1 hour after recruitment maneuver. Then PEEP was modified to obtain an inspiratory transpulmonary pressure (TPP insp-P ) based on P es between 20 and 25 cmH 2 Higher PEEP in Group B led to higher plateau pressure and TPP insp-P , positivation of TPP exp without increase in V D /V T (p = 0.97), shunt (p = 0.84), DP (p = 0.16), TPDP (p = 0.09) or oxygen stretch index (p = 1). However agreement between TPP insp-P and TPP insp calculated from respiratory motion equation and chest wall elastance (TPP insp-E ) was weak with Band-Altman bias (TPP insp-E -TPP insp-P ) = 4.5 \u00b1 8.9 [95%CI \u221213;22]. Conclusions: P es measurement in moderate to severe ARDS patients distinguishes 2 groups of patients in whom PEEP appears to be taylorized without side-effects. However physiologic studies should assess reliability of transpulmonary measurement based on either P es or chest wall elastance. Introduction: To optimize mechanical ventilation different targets are used including tidal volume (TV), peak and mean airway pressure and PEEP. However, prevention of alveolar collapse not only depends on intra-pulmonary, but also on the extra-pulmonary pressure (EPP). EPP can be estimated by measuring esophageal pressure (EP). Ventilator strategies aiming at optimized trans-pulmonary pressure TPP (difference between intra-and extrapulmonary pressure: TPP = TIP-TEP) have been shown to improve outcome.

Introduction: Driving pressure of respiratory system (\u0394P) is defined as the difference between plateau pressure (Pplat) and total positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPtot) measured after endinspiratory and end-expiratory occlusion, respectively, on airway pressure signal. \u0394P has recently been shown as a strong predictor of mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (1) . Most of the studies involved in this demonstration measured Pplat 0.5 sec after onset of endinspiratory pause according to the ARMA trial (2) and used PEEP set on the ventilator (PEEPvent) instead of the PEEPtot. This does not take into account slow decay of airway pressure after endinspiratory occlusion and instrinsic PEEP, respectively. Objectives: The aim of the study was to compare \u0394P when Pplat was measured at different times after end-inspiratory pause and whether PEEPtot or PEEPvent were used. Our hypothesis was that \u0394P was *P < 0.05 versus supine **P < 0.01 versus supine higher with Pplat measured at 0.5 and PEEPvent than with any other combinations of Pplat and PEEPtot. Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients with ARDS in whom respiratory mechanics was measured. Most of the patients had recordings at two levels of PEEPvent. Data were analyzed with Acqknowledge software. Pplat was measured at 0.5, 1 and 2 seconds after end-inspiratory pause. PEEPtot was measured after a 3-sec end-expiratory pause. The low-PEEP and high-PEEP measures pertained to PEEPvent \u226410cmH20 and PEEPvent > 10 cmH20, respectively.

Introduction: End Expiratory Lung Volume (EELV) is reduced in ventilated patients especially in patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). Recruitment maneuvers and different levels of PEEP are used to restore EELV and to improve oxygenation. However; no matter how useful is the value of EELV in clinical practice his bedside measurement at baseline, at different levels of PEEP and after recruitment maneuvers is cumbersome. We measured the EELV with two techniques and we noted the technical problems and pitfalls. Methods: We measure the EELV in patients with ARF at two levels of PEEP (8 and 16 cm H2O) with two techniques. With a dilutional Nitrogen wash in and wash out method using the Carescape R860 ventilator (GE) and by measuring the expired lung volume after a sudden release of PEEP to zero PEEP (ZEEP). Specifically after 10 min of stabilization at each level of PEEP we performed an expiratory hold and we decrease the ventilator frequency to zero to obtain sufficient time for a complete expiration. Therefore, by releasing the expiratory hold we permit the return of the lung to his passive lung volume at ZEEP(passive FRC).The expired volume was calculated by the integration of the expiratory flow. We call this volume \u0394EELV. Correlation and Agreement Fig. 96 (abstract A1040) . Variation of Driving presure at low PEEP between the two methods with the Bland and Altmann analysis were performed. Results: 22 mechanically ventilated patients were studied. At ZEEP EELV was low (1276 ml) 43 % of the predicted. Good correlation was found between the two methods (1637 \u00b1 556 and 1816 \u00b1 521 ml respectively) when EELV was measured at 8 cmH2O of PEEP(R = O.92, p < 0.0001). On the contrary at 16 cmH2O of PEEP a wider variability and less agreement was noticed between the EELV values(2040 \u00b1 703 vs. 2411 \u00b1 597, R = 0.86, p < 0.001). Technical problems with Carescape were spontaneous breathing attempts or asynchrony in the patient-ventilator interactions leading to instable VO2-VCO2 measurements. On the contrary with the release of PEEP method high expired volumes from PEEP to ZEEP induced high expired flow exceeding the 1lit/sec, thus affecting the linear sensitivity of the ventilator's pneumotachograph.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 535, "end": 538, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3447, "end": 3471, "text": "Fig. 96 (abstract A1040)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "References"}, {"text": "Conclusions: The measurement of the EELV remains a precious parameter for the ventilatory management of the ICU patients but his measurement is still far away to be accurate by both techniques at bedside.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "References"}, {"text": "Low end-expiratory trans-pulmonary pressure is associated with lung collapse P. Somhorst, D. Introduction: The open lung concept aims to reduce lung injury due to cyclic opening and closing of alveoli. 1 Finding the 'optimal' PEEP to maintain an open lung proofs difficult and patient-specific. 2 We hypothesize that targeting positive trans-pulmonary pressure (Ptp) at end of expiration (PtpEE) may prevent collapse. We used Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) clinically to optimize PEEP, visualizing over-distention and collapse. 3 Objectives: To show the association between collapse and low PtpEE, as visualized by EIT. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data of ten patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who underwent measurement of the Ptp and EIT due to clinical considerations. A PEEP trial was performed to identify optimal ventilator settings. Esophageal pressure (Pes) was measured using endo-esophageal pressure balloons (Cooper Surgical, Germany, or Sidam, Italy). The Ptp was calculated as the continuous difference between the airway pressure and Pes. EIT was measured at the 5th/6th intercostal space (Dr\u00e4ger, Germany) and analyzed using specialized software (Dr\u00e4ger, Germany). Collapse is defined as a local decrease in ventilation after a reduction in PEEP; over-distention is a local decrease in ventilation after an increase in PEEP. 4 Results: Collapse was associated with a lower PtpEE at lower PEEP levels. For most patients (8/10), collapse occurred when PtpEE was \u2264 2 cmH2O. Collapse was also present at a PEEP level of 15 cmH2O. Inversely, we showed that collapse and over-distention can occur simultaneously (Fig. 101) . The PtpEE was strongly correlated to the PEEP level (r2 = 0.93, p < 0.001; corrected for each individual patient). The overall regression is shown as a dashed line. Conclusions: For most ARDS patients, collapse did not occur when PtpEE was above +2 cmH2O. In addition, PEEP increase in order to prevent collapse may induce over-distention due to heterogeneity in the ventilation distribution in each patient. Introduction: Medical experts recommend keeping plateau pressure below 30 cm H 2 O to avoid ventilator-induced lung injury in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Transpulmonary pressure (Ptp), the difference between alveolar and pleural pressure, has been measured as a surrogate for plateau pressure for lung protective strategies. However, placement of an esophageal balloon catheter is required to measure esophageal pressure. Objectives: We investigated the relationship between Ptp and ventilator waveform parameters according to the strength of spontaneous breathing effort. Methods: Eight patients (four patients with ARDS and four with non-ARDS) mechanically ventilated with AVEA\u00ae were included in this study. An esophageal balloon catheter (AVEA\u00ae SmartCath\u00ae esophageal balloon) was placed to measure esophageal pressure. We evaluated the relationship between \u0394Ptp (difference between inspiratory and end expiratory Ptp) and peak inspiratory flow, or Ti ratio (percentage of time until peak negative esophageal pressure to total inspiratory time). Spontaneous breathing effort was categorized as strong or weak and was analyzed with inspiratory waveform using VOXR data management software. Results: Although there was no significant relationship between \u0394Ptp and peak inspiratory flow (R = 0.450, P = 0.080), a significant correlation was found between \u0394Ptp and Ti ratio (R = 0.720, P = 0.002). Median \u0394Ptp and Ti ratio were significantly higher in patients with strong spontaneous breathing effort compared with those with weak breathing effort (24.3 vs. 13.4 cmH2O, P = 0.012, and 0.50 vs. 0.21, P = 0.008, respectively).

Conclusions: When optimal filling of the esophageal balloon is adopted in mechanically ventilated patients, absolute values of Pes are affected by significant esophageal artifact.

Introduction: Mechanical ventilation unloads the inspiratory muscles in case of high work of breathing to prevent development of muscle injury and patient discomfort. On the other hand, over-assist is associated with disuse atrophy and patient-ventilator asynchrony. Two indices for assessing respiratory muscle effort have recently been published. Patient-ventilator breath contribution (PVBC) index provides an estimation for the percentage of the total work of breathing performed by the patient related to the total work of breathing (patient + ventilator). Neuromuscular efficiency (NME) or pressureelectrical activity index (PEi) expresses how much pressure the inspiratory muscles generate (Pmus) for each microvolt of diaphragm electrical activity (EAdi).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 189, "end": 192, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1244, "end": 1256, "text": "(Figure 102)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "A1044"}, {"text": "Objectives:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A1044"}, {"text": "The aim of the current study was to assess the repeatability of both PVBC and NME and investigate how these indices changes in time in ventilated ICU patients.

Driving pressure Background:. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation (LT). Although the creatinine value is highly specific to estimate renal dysfunction, an inadequate sensitivity of creatinine level is demonstrated, particularly in early stage AKI. Cystatin C is founded to be a stronger predictor of the risk of cardiovascular events and death than creatinine. We aimed to determine whether pretransplant serum levels of cystatin C predict 30-day major cardiovascular events (MACE) and all-cause mortality in LT recipients with normal serum creatinine values. Methods: Between May 2010 and October 2015, 1187 consecutive LT recipients (mean age: 53 years; 75 % male; 97 % living-donor LT) who have pretransplant creatinine level < 1.4 mg/dL were retrospectively evaluated.

The risk for a 30-day MACE event increased significantly with increasing quartiles of cystatin C; hazard ratios ranged from 1.13 to 2.73 for the highest versus the lowest quartile (P < 0.001 for trend). The Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the highest quartile (cystatin C > 1.0 mg/dL) had a significantly worse survival rate than the lowest quartile (cystatin C < 0.7 mg/dL) (logrank P = 0.023). However, pretransplant creatinine level showed neither increasing MACE event rate nor worse survival rate with increasing quartiles of creatinine values (P = 0.094 for trends, log-rank P = 0.082, respectively).

Introduction: The therapy of malignant liver diseases has changed over the last 100 years. During this period the frequency of liver resection has increased with great improvement in morbidity, mortality and long-term survival. [1] Thereby, the duration of liver transection and the amount of perioperative blood loss are of great importance for postoperative recovery time and therefore they are measures for choosing the optimal resection method. [2] Furthermore, the release of cytokines, chemokines, and stress hormones correlates with postoperative infection and organ dysfunction [3] . To minimize cell damage and limit apoptotic cell death the so called heat shock response is initialized by various body cells as countermeasure to increased stress levels [4] . Moreover, Pittet et al. showed a positive correlation between the small heat shock protein 27 (HSP72) serum levels and survival after severe trauma. [5] Objectives: Measurement of HSP27 could give an insight about pathological mechanism and their counter regulations of the liver. Furthermore the HSP27 serum level should be correlated with the transection speed of the two resection methods CUSA and Stabler. . Immediately after collection, samples were aliquoted, snap frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further analyzation. To quantify HSP27 in serum commercially available ELISA kits from R&D (DuoSet IC) have been used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Furthermore the duration of transection and the resection surface expressed as cm 2 /s were recorded. Results: During surgery a significant increase in HSP27 levels was detected in patients undergoing Stabler hepatectomy or CUSA resection (n = 40, p < 0.05). During postoperative ICU stay, HSP27 concentrations decline to levels comparable before surgery. The transection speed was significant faster in patients undergoing stapler resection compared to the CUSA method (p < 0.0001). The mean length of ICU stay after liver resection was in both groups 2 days. Conclusions: Our data show increased levels in serum of HSP27, which might reflect the body's countermeasure to increased systemic stress levels during hepatectomy. Moreover the HSP27 levels are in both groups equal high during surgery even though the resection conducted with the Stabler is significant faster than CUSA. Introduction: Performing laparoscopic surgery using carboxipneumoperitoneum usually accompanied with a moderate increase of the concentration of carbon dioxide at the end of expiration, as well as higher peak airway pressure that easily manages to compensate by the correction of ventilation parameters. In the postoperative period marked a fairly long recovery of baseline respiratory function associated not only with the post-operative pain, but with the restriction of the lung as a result of intraabdominal hypertension.

Depending on the surgical access patients were divided into two study groups: 1st -basic -(n = 33) group -laparoscopic procedures, 2nd -control -(n = 61) group of traditional laparotomy. All patients were under equal anesthesia during surgery: combined general anesthesia (sevoflurane + fentanil) and epidural infusion of 0.2 % ropivacaine solution, as well as myoplegia; postoperative multimodal analgesia: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antispasmodics, epidural analgesia. A study of respiratory function was carried out in four stages: 1 -before surgery, 2 -2nd, 3 -6th, 4-11th day after surgery. Results: In patients of both groups to the second stage of study determined a significant reduction of volume parameters of respiratory function (VC, FVC, FEV, FEV1, MEF, MVV etc.). For example VC decreased in patients of group 1 by 41 % against the initial values, and 52 % of patients in group 2 (dynamics presented in the diagram). Similarly changes in VC there is a decrease of all volume parameters: FEV1 for the second phase decreased by 39.1 % in group 1 and 48 % in group 2; MEF decreased by 61.5 % and 74.3 % in the first and second groups, respectively. However, in addition to a statistically smaller decrease in the absolute values of volumetric parameters of respiratory function in the 1st group, we found them more intense recovery. Conclusions: Reducing the volume indicators of respiratory function after extensive laparoscopic surgery is less than after similar in volume laparotomy. Recovery of acquired restrictive respiratory disorders is more intense and after laparoscopic surgery. At the same time in either group studies we have not observed a complete rehabilitation the initial levels of respiratory parameters, even after 11 days after surgery. Introduction: Critically ill patients sometimes need laparoscopic surgery. It has been reported that steeped head-down position could increase intracranial pressure during robotic surgery. But we don\u00b4t know whether mild Trendelenburg position and carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum cause intracranial hypertension. We conducted a prospective observational study. Objectives: The aim of our study was to investigate the change of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) in head-down position during carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum. Methods: We included patients scheduled to undergo laparoscopic gynecological surgery. Exclusion criteria were ocular disease and central nervous system diseases. ONSD were measured 3 mm sagittal behind the globe We assessed ONSD after tracheal intubation (T baseline), after pneumoperitoneum and Trendelenburg position (T 0 ) and every 30 minutes (T 30 , T 60 , T 90 , T 120 ). Anesthetic management were standardized. Results: Twenty seven patients were enrolled in this study. Four patients were excluded from analysis because it was difficult for us to measure ONSD. The degree of head-down angle was 13.8 \u00b1 2.61. ONSD is significantly higher than baseline after pneumoperitoneum and Trendelenburg position ( Figure 109 ). Conclusions: Carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum and Trendelenburg position increased intracranial pressure even if the head-down angle was mild. Introduction: Monitoring the anticoagulant effect of unfractionated heparin (UFH) is mandatory. This monitoring can be done by the mean of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) or by anti-Xa levels measurements. Compared with anti-Xa levels testing, aPTT is more frequently impacted by preanalytic variables and biologic factors (increased levels of acute phase reactants, consumption coagulopathy) often encountered among critically ill patients. We studied the agreement of both tests results in unselected critically ill patients. Objectives: To study the agreement of both tests results in unselected critically ill patients. Methods: aPTT and anti-Xa levels were simultaneously monitored in patients treated by continuous intravenous infusion of UFH. Blood samples were drawn into sodium citrate tubes (Greiner Bio-One SAS, France). aPTT was measured with TriniCLOT Automated aPTT reagent (Tcoag, Ireland) and anti-Xa levels with BIO-PHEN HEPARIN (LRT) (HYPHEN Biomed, France) . An aPTT of 2-3 times the control and anti-Xa levels between 0.3-0.7 IU/ml were defined as therapeutic. Results: Forty-four patients (mean age 71.13 \u00b1 15.7 years; mean SAP-SII 39.1 \u00b1 14.4) were included. Reasons for admission were medical in 31, surgical in 13. The indications for UFH therapy were atrial fibrillation (26), venous thromboembolism/pulmonary embolism (13), thrombophilia (2), acute coronary syndrome (1), arterial thrombosis (2). Paired measurements of aPTT and anti-Xa were performed on Page 540 of 607 353 samples. Linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between aPTT and anti-Xa. The correlation between aPTT and anti-Xa levels was low (r = 0.495 ) Concordant aPTT and anti-Xa values were observed in 213 (60.3 %) data pairs. aPTT was discordantly high in 96 (29.9 %) data pairs and discordantly low in 44 (12.5 %) ones. Considering anti-Xa as gold standard, monitoring anticoagulation treatment by aPTT leads to a high risk of misdosing. aPTT is frequently impacted by biologic factors. Although less commonly, anti-Xa levels can also be influenced by biological cofounders. Poor correlation between aPTT and anti-Xa could result from lterations in FII and FVIII activity.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3378, "end": 3388, "text": "Figure 109", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 4503, "end": 4526, "text": "(HYPHEN Biomed, France)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Methods:"}, {"text": "Conclusions: Use of aPTT and anti-Xa levels to guide heparin therapy may lead to different estimates of UFH concentration in the same patient.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods:"}, {"text": "Both aPTT and anti-Xa have limitations when used for UFH monitoring and may not accurately assess anticoagulant status.

Introduction: The severe capillary leak-induced respiratory and renal failure limit large-volume resuscitation with crystalloids and blood components. The combined use of low volumes of crystalloids and \"damage control resuscitation\" (DCR), a blood product resuscitation goal of a 1:1:1 ratio of packed red blood cells (PRBC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP) has recently been applied to obstetric patients in hemorrhagic shock. Another important consideration is the association of FFP with the risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), a major cause of death after transfusion. This risk is not present with the use of prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) as the antibodies responsible for TRALI are removed during the manufacturing processes. Methods: Our research involved 51 patients with massive bleeding after Cesarean section. Patients were divided into 2 groups: 1 st group contained 10 patients as a treatment of massive bleeding with coagulopathy was scheduled PCC in a dose of 1 ml/kg (25 IU/kg), packed red blood cells (PRBC). 2 nd group (41 patients) received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in a dose of 20 ml/kg and PRBC. Basic infusiontransfusion therapy was administered according to the protocols of hemorrhagic shock treatment in obstetrics.

Cohort studies of patients aged >65 years demonstrate that anaemia is associated with increased mortality (2) . Anaemia is also associated with a variety of morbidities in older people, being linked with an increase in hospitalisation, poorer physiological, physical and cognitive function, development of Alzheimer\u00b4s and Parkinson\u00b4s diseases, depression, falls and hip fracture rates. We aimed to investigate whether anaemia was associated with adverse outcomes, increased lengths of stay and increased overall mortality in our ICU cohort. We also thought it would be interesting to know if there was a difference in haemoglobin level depending on the specialty in which the patients were admitted -hereby defining the physiology of their anaemic process.

Patient factors included nature of acute illness, underlying comorbidities, clinical presentation, and patient's values. Clinician factors included background, training, experience and practice style. System factors included of standardized policies and protocols, hierarchy and team dynamics. Although most clinicians agreed that intubation is needed in case of persistent respiratory distress, altered mental status, or shock, they disagreed on when to initiate it.

(1) . Objectives: To determine the efficacy of rhTM in septic patients with severe respiratory failure. Methods: We performed sub-analysis of a retrospective observational study (Japan Septic Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation study, J-SEPTIC DIC study), which was conducted in 42 intensive care units in Japan. Among 3195 septic patients enrolled in this original trial, we selected septic patients with severe respiratory failure and compared patients based on rhTM treatment (rhTM group and control group). Propensity score analysis was performed between two groups. Outcome was the number of ventilator free days. Results: 1180 patients (rhTM, n = 356, control, n = 824) were analyzed in this trial. After adjusting for baseline imbalances by propensity score analysis, VFDs increased significantly in rhTM group (rhTM group: 11.9 \u00b1 10.3 days vs. control group: 10.3 \u00b1 10.4 days, P = 0.03). Conclusions: In this analysis, rhTM improved outcomes in septic patients with severe respiratory failure. We need further evaluation. Results: During the study period, totally 64 ARDS patients with pathologic diagnosis of DAD were eligible for analysis. These 64 patients were divided as mild (n = 14, 21.9 %), moderate (n = 36, 56.2 %) and severe ARDS (n = 14, 21.9 %) by Berlin definition and the hospital mortality rate were not significantly different between these three groups (64.3 %, 69.4 % and 85.7 %, p = 0.4). According to the etiology, these 64 DAD patients were divided into known etiology group (n = 47, 73.4 %) and unknown etiology group (n = 17, 26.6 %), and the hospital mortality rate had no significant difference (72.3 % vs 70.6 %, p = 0.890). The known etiology group had higher percentage of male and lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio than unknown etiology group (72.3 % vs 41.2 %, p = 0.022; 202.3 \u00b1 84.4 vs 146.3 \u00b1 60.0, p = 0.005). The multivariable logistic regression revealed sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score at the time of open lung biopsy was the only predictor of hospital mortality (odds ratio 1.413, 95 % confidence interval 1.127-1.772; p = 0.03). In terms of glucocorticoid treatment, there was no significant difference in glucocorticoid use, timing from ARDS to glucocorticoid use, dose and duration between survival and nonsurvival patients. Conclusions: For the ARDS patients with DAD, SOFA score was the predictor of hospital mortality but glucocorticoid treatment did not improve the survival rate. Introduction: Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is a known complication of mechanical ventilation. Aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions results in infection that leads to significant morbidity, mortality and cost 1 . Use of sub-glottic secretion drainage (SSD) devices have been shown to decrease both the incidence of VAP and intensive care unit (ICU) days 2,3 . There have been safety concerns associated with use of SSD devices and herniation of tracheal tissue into the suction port 4 . A study in sheep showed significant tracheal injury associated with continuous suction 5 . Human studies have shown conflicting results regarding the risk of tracheal injury 6, 7 . Objectives: To determine the risk of tracheal injury using an SSD device versus a standard endotracheal tube. Methods: 57 patients undergoing tracheostomy in the ICU were enrolled in the study. Patients were intubated in the ICU, operating or emergency room, pre-hospital, or referring hospitals. Intubation conditions and duration of intubation were documented. At the time of tracheostomy, a bronchoscopy was performed and the presence and degree of tracheal injury were noted. Patients were followed to hospital discharge and decannulation, otolaryngology consults, and discharge or death were recorded. Results: 41 patients were intubated with a Malinckrodt EVAC SSD device and 16 were intubated with a standard endotracheal tube. 33 patients were found to have a tracheal injury ranging from mild erythema to severe ulceration; 23/41 (56 %) in the EVAC group and 10/ 16 (63 %) in the standard group (RR -0.89; 95 % CI 0.56 to 1.43). 5/ 41 (12 %) patients were reported to have injury at the site of the suction port; 2 were reported to have mild edema and erythema and 3 had mild to moderate ulceration. Of the patients with tracheal ulceration at the suction catheter port, 4 were decannulated successfully without further complication and 1 patient died prior to termination of mechanical ventilation. Conclusions: There was no significant difference in the risk of tracheal injury with SSD devices compared to standard endotracheal tubes. The degree of injury was similar in both groups.

Objectives.Objective of the study was to examine the effect of Healthcare Improvement ventilation bundle Institute in addition to focusing on three strategies : Oral decontamination with chlorhexidine (ODC), the head elevation and awakening daily in the incidence of VAP in a unit intensive care. Methods: The study was conducted in a 20-bed, medical-surgical ICU. Criteria for nosocomial pneumonia are those from the CDC. Strategy was to implement the IHI's ventilator bundle , focused and optimized in the first three The goals were the ICU team adhesion of 80 % achieved in six month after bundle implementation and 98 % after one year of follow up. These measures included five strategies to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia: 1-45\u00b0elevation of the head of the bed, 2-adequate sedation level (RASS \u22121 a \u22122 ), 3-oral decontamination with chlorhexidine 0.12 %, 4-DVT/PE prevention and 5-peptic ulcer prophylaxis . From January 2012 on, the ICU nursing staff and ICT performed a daily checklist in order to observe the five issues accomplishment. If any item was found to be inadequate it was promptly corrected. Results: In January and December 2012 , adhesion to the whole bundle was 68 % and 100 % respectively. VAP density was proportionally lower to bundle adhesion in the same period, 20 per 1000 ventilation/day and respectively.

Introduction: Development of critical care medicine has been decreasing mortality of critical illness. However, 60-80 % of survivors suffer functional impairment or ICU-acquired weakness (ICU-AW). In order to address interventions in ICU-AW, it is essential to know when ICU-AW developed in addition to its incidence and risk factors. Objectives: To assess the onset of ICU-AW and its incidence and risk factors in the ICU of Tokushima University Hospital. Methods: Prospective observational study. Critically ill adults were enrolled when they were mechanically ventilated at least 4 days. Patients younger than 20 years old, with neuromuscular diseases, central nervous system disorders, and pregnancy were excluded. After we determined feasibility of communication, medical research council (MRC) sum score was measured as soon as possible. When MRC score was less than 48, we diagnosed patient as ICU-AW.

Introduction: Severe traumatic brain injury (STBI) remains as the most significant medical and social problem due to high prevalence and mortality, primarily among young and employable population. The leading problem of intensive care of STBI is the prevention and elimination of intracranial hypertension (ICH). One of the methods of ICH elimination is mechanical ventilation as a component of complex therapy. Among the various methods and modes of mechanical ventilation high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) is particularly distinguished, which is enduring \"the second birth\". In HFV transpulmonary pressure and the pressure in airways is much lower than one during traditional methods, the negative pressure in pleural cavity is maintained during inspiration phase and spontaneous breathing.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "NONVENTILATORY MANAGEMENT"}, {"text": "Objectives: Comparative assessment of efficacy of different modes of mechanical ventilation in patients with STBI.

All patients had traditional intensive care with different modes of respiratory support: controlled mechanical ventilation -CMV (n = 10); synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation -SIMV (n = 20); HFJV (n = 40). The efficacy of all modes were assessed by arterial blood gases analysis (SaO2 -96-99 %, pCO2 -34.7-35.2 mmHg). Intracranial pressure were measured invasively and was 20 \u00b1 5 mmHg. All patients regularly had clinical and neurological examination, control of laboratory tests (common blood count, arterial blood gases, arteriovenous gradient of O2 (AVDO2) and oxygen saturation in jugular vein (SjO2).

Most patients found mobilisation to be a positive experience and the beginning of their recovery. However, mobilization was described as a difficult component of the care, mainly due to pain, tiredness and dizziness. Almost all patients commented on the benefits of participation in physiotherapy, which was verified by physical improvements and progression in their abilities. Although most improvements discussed were physical, two patients also described the psychological benefits that occurred in the sessions. They reported that the physiotherapists 'built them up' and encouraged them. One patient described a mind shift that occurred once she had mobilised out of the bed. She described it as being able to see what she was capable of. It was described as a precious and muchneeded service, without which some patients felt they may not have survived or recovered as quickly. Methods: This retrospective study was performed in a 12-bed medical ICU in Spain from 2011 to 2015. All patients admitted to the ICU during this period were included in the study. CCI patients were defined as those with more than 60 days of ICU stay. Data were collected in 3 ways: review of a prospectively elaborated database, review of electronic records, and telephone survey evaluating the functional status of survivors, one year after their discharge from the ICU. Results: During the study period, 46 patients (9 females \u221220 %) were considered CCI. The characteristics of these patients are shown in Table 82 . All the studied patients needed prolonged mechanical ventilation (median 66 days), defined as >6 hours/day of ventilator support for > 21 consecutive days. The follow-up period is drawn in Figure 115 . The in-ICU mortality was 28 %. In the first year, 17 patients (37 %) were alive. Most patients improved their quality of life over a year, with approximately 40 % of them displaying some help for dressing or to performing the transfer of themselves. Symptoms of anxiety and depression improved during the first year, being present in up to 20 % (of the patients), but in 6 % if we refer to the presence of nightmares or hallucinations. 41 % these patients were transferred (discharge) to a rehabilitation center and 47 % needed hospital readmission within the follow-up period. Conclusions: For CCI patients in-hospital mortality rate is still high after discharge from the ICU. However, more than one third of them are alive one year after their Hospital stay and in an almost independent condition. Efforts focused on early specific therapeutic strategies after ICU admission to prevent the progress of the acute disease towards chronic critical illness and to improve the outcome must be explored.

Patients worsened in all parameters of the five dimensions of the EQ-5D after 30-days: The extreme problems level increased in the mobility dimension from 12.1 % at ICU to 42.1 %, self-care from 25.8 % to 52.6 %; usual activities from 19.7 % to 68.4 %; pain/discomfort from 7.6 to 13.2 and anxiety/depression from 4.5 % to 7.9 %. The dependence observed in the KATZ index worsened in 30 days when 28.8 % of patients were dependents before ICU admission increasing to 44.7 % after 30 days. About family members, 42.4 % were spouses and 39.4 offspring, their mean of age was 55.89 \u00b1 13.69 years and 84.8 % had previous experience of ICU. We observed that they presented more symptoms of anxiety (50 %) and depression (27.3 %) at ICU when compared 30 days after (21.1 %) and (13.2 %), symptoms of anxiety and depression respectively. Conclusions: The most common eligibility conditions of CCI were sepsis followed by mechanical ventilation. We observed a great mortality on 30 days and among survivors a worsen quality of life with more dependence in their Activities of Daily Living. We also observed that family members suffered more while in ICU stay. Introduction: Tracheostomy is a favored alternative option for providing prolonged mechanical ventilation and safety airway used for more than 50 years. Despite its numerous advantages, tracheostomy may have severe complications as being an invasive method for presenting respiratory tract patency. Besides, the tracheostomized patients usually have prolonged ICU stay, high mortality and morbidity arise from concomitant comorbidities.

After 12 min of untreated VF, CPR, including mechanical chest compression, ventilation and adrenaline administration, was performed for 5 min prior to defibrillation. Following successful resuscitation, animals were subjected to 4 hr ventilation with (a) 70 % argon -30 % O 2 (n = 10) or (b) 70 % N 2 -30 % O 2 (n = 10). Hemodynamics were continuously monitored and systolic myocardial function (i.e. ejection fraction (EF), shortening fraction (SF)) was assessed by echocardiography. Serial blood samples were obtained for blood gas, serum neuron specific enolase (NSE) and plasma high sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) assays. Animals were observed up to 96 hr for assessment of survival and neurological recovery (Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) scale). Results: Twenty animals were successfully resuscitated and enrolled in the study (Table 87) . Ventilation with argon did not have any detrimental effects on respiratory gas exchange during the 4 hr ventilation (Table 87) . Animals receiving argon showed a significantly lower heart rate and higher mean arterial pressure and stroke volume compared to controls during the 4 hr of observation (Table 87) . Animals treated with argon presented also a significantly better recovery of systolic myocardial function, as represented by the higher SF at 96 hr compared to controls (Table 87) . Nine of the 10 resuscitated animals in the argon group survived for 96 h in comparison to 6 out of 10 in the control group. Animals treated with argon presented a significantly better neurological recovery (CPC 1.7 \u00b1 1.3) in contrast to animals in the control group (3.4 \u00b1 1.6, Figure 121 ). Lower circulating levels of hs-cTnT (median: 1332 ng/mL vs. 8015 ng/mL, p < 0.05) and NSE (median 8.5 ng/mL vs. 21.2, p not significant) were observed in the animals ventilated with argon compared to controls.

Excessive perioperative bleeding continues to complicate cardiac surgery with cardio-pulmonary bypass (CPB) in spite of improvements in extracorporeal oxygenation and surgical techniques. Even bleeding after cardiac surgery has variable causes, we thought the applying ISTH scoring system may be able to predict the postoperative excessive blood loss in patients after cardiac surgery with CPB. Objectives: The aim of present study was to examine the effectiveness of International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) scoring system in patients with cardiac surgery. Methods: The medical records of patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery using CPB between Mar. 2010 and Feb. 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. These demographic and clinical characteristics, perioperative laboratory findings, and postoperative complications were assessed using computerized databases from our institution. ISTH score was calculated in ICU and Patients were divided with overt DIC group and non-overt DIC group. Results: Among 384 patients with cardiac surgery, 70 patients with Overt DIC Group (n = 20) or Non-overt DIC Group (n = 50) were enrolled. Mean DIC scores at ICU admission was 5.35 \u00b1 0.59 (Overt DIC Group) and 2.66 \u00b1 1.29 (Non-overt DIC Group) and overt DIC was induced in 29 % (20/70).

Introduction: Many studies have shown clinical benefits from SDD for critically ill patients. However, there is still doubt concerning the emergence of antimicrobial resistance in the long term. Previously no evidence to support this view was found but long-term effects of SDD on antimicrobial resistance on the unit level is understudied. 1, 2 Objectives: To determine the incidence of antimicrobial resistance in aerobic gram-negative potentially pathogenic micro-organisms (AGNBs) to the components of SDD and frequently used i.v. antibiotics on ICU-level over a 20 year period with unchanged antibiotic policy.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 218, "end": 221, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 268, "end": 271, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 842, "end": 845, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1775, "end": 1777, "text": "1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1778, "end": 1779, "text": "2", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A1136"}, {"text": "Methods: This is a single-center observational cohort study in a Dutch 20-bed adult intensive care unit in a teaching hospital. All consecutive patients admitted to the ICU between January 1994 and December 2013 were included when at least one culture was taken during ICU-admission. Data on all cultures taken during ICU stay were collected from the hospital database. Susceptibility testing was performed following the guidelines of the 'clinical and laboratory standards institute' (CSLI) until 2011 and 'the European committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing' (EUCAST) from 2011 until 2013. Incidence rates of antimicrobial resistance to tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, polymyxin B or cefotaxime were calculated per year. Only ICUacquired resistant pathogens were selected by excluding resistant pathogens in cultures taken on day 1-day 3. Patients at risk were defined as all admissions with a length of stay longer than 2 days. Differences between the incidence in the first and last year of the study were tested using Chi-square test. Results: Data of 127.830 cultures was analyzed containing 15.557 AGNBs. The number of admissions with a length of stay more than 2 days was 6781. In 237 admissions newly acquired resistance to cefotaxime was found, in 117 to polymxin B, 183 to tobramycin and 180 to ciprofloxacin. Figure 136 presents incidence rates per year. In 1994-1996 date of discharge to the ward was unknown and therefore incidence rates could not be calculated for these years but absolute numbers were comparably low. There was no significant difference in incidence of ICU acquired resistance in cefotaxime (\u03c7 2 = 0.14, p = 0.71), polymyxin B (\u03c7 2 = 0.71, p = 0.40), tobramycin (\u03c7 2 = 1.89, p = 0.17) and ciprofloxacin (\u03c7 2 = 0.28, p = 0.59) between 1997 and 2013. Conclusions: The incidence of newly acquired AGNB resistant to cefotaxime, polymyxin B, tobramycin and ciprofloxacin continues to be low during a 20 year unchanged antimicrobial policy of SDD. The increase in resistance in the society may impact these numbers and should be studied. Results: Overall, ICU and H mortality rates were 94 and 87 %. 17.7 % of the pts (55/310) became infected in the early postoperative period. (ICU and H mortality rate 21 and 29 % respectively). CRPK infections were present in 8 pts (2.5 % of the entire series, 14.5 % of the infected pts). Sarcopenia (50 % vs 10 %, p = 0.0045) and MELD (29 + 9 vs 19 + 8, p = 0.0022) were significant preoperative risk factors. ICU and H mortality rates were 37 % and 75 % in CRPK pts, 19 % and 25 % in non -CRKP infected pts respectively : while ICU mortality was not different (p = 0.65), H mortality was significantly higher in CRKP pts (p = 0.0056 ICU vs H, CI 7.3 -74.6). If compared to non -CRKP pts , CRKP pts were more often in septic shock (75 % vs 34 %, p = 0.031) and more frequently underwent CRRT (75 % vs 36 % p = 0.0404). Intraabdominal infections were largely represented (80 %) among CRKP pts. Blood loss and transfusion needs, Early gratt dysfunction and reOLT were more represented in infected vs non infected pts. However, no differences were found when CRKP and non-CRKP transplanted pts were compared. Conclusions: CRKP infections are on the rise also in Italy. Post OLT mortality is high and strategies able to control CRKP are urgently needed to be implemented. Introduction: The prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in ICU conditions makes it difficult to treat these infections, and treatment becomes impossible in some cases. Acinetobacter baumannii is important infectious agent ICU patients, which effective antibiotic therapy is currently limited. Objectives: We aimed to determine the range of A.baumannii associated infections among ICU patients, to summarize the level of resistance to antimicrobial drugs, and provide an overview of strategies to prevent the spread of resistance. Methods: A prospective microbiological study of the prevalence and antibiotic resistance of A.baumannii strains isolated from adult ICU patients hospitalized to the tertiary hospital after cardiac surgery from 2010 to 2014. Results: A total of 781isolates from ICU patients were included to the study. 52.3 % of the isolated strains (409) were Gram-negative, among which 20.9 % (164) of A.baumannii isolates. Strains of A. baumannii showed a high level of resistance to the III generation cephalosporins (96.9 % to ceftazidime, 97.6 % to cefotaxime, 93.5 % to ceftriaxone). Resistance to carbapenems was at 88 %. Investigation of antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin showed the resistance in 96.8 % of strains, to levofloxacin -88.9 %. The lowest level of resistance recorded to doxycycline -24.5 % and polymyxin -4.8 %. Conclusions: Rapid microbiological diagnostics (including the results of antibiotic resistance), strict adherence to infection control, the appointment of an effective regime of antibiotic therapy, optimization schemes appointment of antibiotics, all of which are the most important priorities for the effective fight against A. baumannii associated infections in ICU patients. In order to reduce the emergence and spread of drug-resistant strains in the ICU, it is strongly recommended to carry out microbiological monitoring and optimization of the use of antibiotics in each hospital.

Objectives: We aimed to present and discuss the results of our patients who were infected with either panresistant (5 patients) or only tigecycline susceptible (5 patients) acinetobacter spp. and were treated with rifampicin combination regimens. Methods: Patients reported to be infected with colistin resistant acinetobacter spp. and treated with rifampicin combination regimens upon decision of the responsible teams were traced from the intensive care unit (ICU) records between the years 2014 and 2016 retrospectively.

Polymyxins are considered as the last resort for the treatment of infections with carbapenem resistant gram negative bacilli (GNB). Inadequateor extensive use of colistin leads to emergence of colistin resistance, increasing mortality and morbidity and necessitating prudent use of alternative antibiotics. Fosfomycin, a phosponic acid derivative which acts by disrupting bacterial cell wall synthesis, is a broad spectrum antibiotic. It is available as sodium/disodium formulation for intravenous use and is showing promising result against multi drug resistant(MDR)/Pan Drug Resistant (PDR) pathogens. Methods: A total of eight colistin resistant (MIC \u2265 4) GNB were isolated from ICU patients with nosocomial MDR infections during a period of one year. All eight isolates were Klebsiella pneumonia. Among these isolates five were from blood and three from endotracheal aspirate. All the isolates were sensitive to fosfomycin in vitro. All of these patients had multiple co-morbidities with recent history of colistin exposure. Intravenous fosfomycin was given as a combination therapy. Results: Among the five bacterimic patients, three recovered completely from sepsis. One patient took discharge against medical advice and the only one bacterimic patient who died during the course of therapy was later on diagnosed to have azole resistant fungemia as super infection. The patient with ventilator associated pneumonia also responded well after initiation of fosfomycin therapy. Average duration of antibiotic therapy in all these cases was ten days. Conclusions: Based on the evidence of clinical experience and available studies, intravenous fosfomycin therapy may be considered as the last option for the treatment of MDR GNB infection where there is documented colistin resistance and where there is literally no other choice of antibiotic therapy. The success of the therapy is encouraging in selected group of patients. Further research on intravenous fosfomycin use specially against MDR pathogens and on the effectiveness and safety of the drug in the treatment of patients with such infections may be warranted. Introduction: Patients at the Intensive care units have an increased risk of infection due to their underlying diseases or conditions, impaired immunity, and exposure to multiple invasive procedures (surgery, mechanical ventilation, central venous catheters, artherial catheters, urinary tract catheters). Multidrug-resistant organisms infection has become a public health problem and has been associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and costs. Objectives: To analyze the principal features of postsurgical patients with colonization or infection by multidrug-resistant organisms, acquired before the admission at the Intensive Care Unit. Methods: Retrospective observational study, descriptive, case series, collected from 04/01/2014 to 29/11/2015 in a 400-bed hospital, with a 10-bed polyvalent Intensive Care Unit in Fuenlabrada, Madrid, Spain. The Hospital is attached to Resistance Zero Project, with screening at admission and every week in all patients (pharyngeal, rectal, nasal, wounds and bronchial suction). 18 postsurgical patients have been identified with multidrugresistant organisms isolation in screening in the first 24 hours of admission to the Intensive Care Unit. Studied Variables: age, sex, adjusted Charlson comorbidity index, Barthel index, APACHE II, SAPS 3, days of hospitalization prior to ICU, days of antibiotic treatment administered before ICU, previous days of parenteral nutrition, prealbumin, surgical wound infection, multigrug-resistant organisms identified sample. Statistical analysis: SPSS20. Categorical in frequencies and percentages, mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range. Analysis Kolmogorov Smirnov, Shapiro Wlik and QQPlot to normality. Confidence intervals (CI) 95 % by T Student for normal variables, Boot stramp to not normal. Results: In 20 months we identified 18 postsurgical patients with multidrug-resistant organisms in screening at the admission or before the admission to the Intensive Care Unit. Multidrug-resistant organisms identified: Pseudomonas aeruginosa 6 (33.3 %), ESBL enterobacteriaceae 6 (33.3 %), MRSA 3 (16.7 %), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia 1 (5.6 %). Isolated on: surgical wound 7 (38.6 %), bronchial suction 2 (11.1 %), peritoneal fluid 2 (11.1 %), exudates monitoring 2 (11.1 %), blood 1 (5.6 %). Antibiotic therapy: Carbapenem 8 (44.4 %), Piperacilina-tazobactam 6 (33.3 %). Conclusions: In our study the risk of prior acquisition of multidrugresistant organisms at the admission to the Intensive Care Unit in postsurgical patients was characterized by long hospital stay, high comorbidity and dependence, malnutrition, prolonged use of broadspectrum antibiotic, parenteral nutrition and surgical wound infection. Introduction: The emergence and dissemination of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) is of great concern. Outbreaks have been reported in different types of Intensive Care Units (ICU). In Brazil, there have been reports of KPC since 2006. We recently experienced a large outbreak at our hospital. Risk factors for KPC colonization and outcome of ICU patients are still to be determined. Objectives: To study the differences between patients who acquired from those who did not acquired KPC during their stay in the ICU, focusing on risk factors and outcomes. Introduction: Patients with a prolonged weaning represent a small part of the total ICU population but this prolonged state has many implications on their later recovery and can highly impact health expenditures. Objectives: To better characterize patients with prolonged weaning and assess factors associated with their survival. Methods: The prospective multicentre observational WIND (Weaning accordIng New Definition) study was performed from April to August 2013. Ventilation and weaning modalities were daily assessed until discharge in all intubated patients admitted to the participating ICUs. We defined 1) weaning attempt (WA) as a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) or an extubation (with or without SBT), 2) successful weaning as an extubation without death or invasive mechanical ventilation within 7 days. We considered patients as having a prolonged weaning if weaning was not terminated at 7 days following their first WA. Conclusions: In this multicentre international prospective cohort, 11.5 % of the patients entering the weaning process had a prolonged weaning with a high mortality rate of 29.8 %. The only baseline factor associated with death were previous immunodeficiency and chronic cardiac failure. These patients highly impact the ICU workload as they receive mechanical ventilation for a median duration of 19 days and their median length of stay in the ICU is 25 days. Patients with a prolonged weaning spend a long ICU time after the end of weaning without mechanical ventilation raising the issue of the need for specialized units. Introduction: Ineffective efforts (IE), defined as the inability of patient's inspiratory effort to trigger a ventilator-delivered breath, is a commonly encountered asynchrony, and has been reported to adversely affect patient outcome1,2,3. The incidence of IE depends on several factors, including patient population, ventilator settings, and the observation period, which in most studies so far was limited2,3.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A1136"}, {"text": "Objectives: Aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of ineffective efforts, using continuous recordings, in critically ill patients mechanically ventilated only on assisted mode and their potential effects on patient outcome. Methods: 110 adult critically ill patients hospitalized in the ICU of the University Hospital of Heraklion on mechanical ventilation for >12 h were enrolled. Patients were studied when they were on assisted ventilation for >1 hour and expected to remain on assisted ventilation for the next 24 hours. Patients were studied again on the 3rd and 6th day if they remained on assisted ventilation. Continuous 24 h measurements were obtained using a monitor validated to identify ineffective efforts (PVI monitor)4. The output of PVI monitor data was processed before analysis to optimize data quality and re-sampled to a time-series with the number of IEs calculated in uniform intervals of 30secs while preserving the total number and duration of IEs5. The IE index was calculated as previously described. Because IE occurred in clusters, the concept of IE event was introduced, to describe variable periods of time containing IE > 10 % of breaths. IE events were characterized by their duration and power (number of IE)5. Introduction: The neural timing during mechanical ventilation can be obtained from conventional airway flow tracing, or invasive esophageal and gastric signal; however, it is difficult clinical practice and could be imprecise.

The latter can be determined by the using the Tension Time index of the inspiratory muscles (TTi es ) derived from measurement of esophageal pressure. TTi es values higher than 0.18 indicate fatiguing patient effort.

Data were analysed in terms of TTi es and esophageal pressure developed in the first 100 ms of an occluded inspiration (P 0.1 ) Results: The baseline TTi es values of 0.10 \u00b1 0.05 were consistent with absence of fatiguing effort in all patients but one. As expected, reducing/increasing the level of PS resulted in TTi es and P 0.1 increase or decrease, respectively. In 3 patients the reduction of PS was associated with impending muscle fatigue. The levels of PS proposed by the Beacon system resulted in TTi es of 0.13 \u00b1 0.01, slightly higher than obtained by the treating physician, but always below the values indicating muscle fatigue, a part from the patient in which the TTi es indicated fatigue at baseline. Of note, this new value of TTies was not associated with a significant variation P 0.1 , which implies that the proposed level of PS was not associated with an increased respiratory drive or higher transpulmonary pressure Conclusion: These initial results indicate that Beacon Caresystem responds appropriately to over-and under-support avoiding muscle fatigue and excessive P0.1.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A1136"}, {"text": "The use of vo2 level changes as a predictor for weaning success in the mechanically ventilated patients Introduction: Experimentally, hyperchloraemia may induce vasoconstriction of the renal afferent arterioles and tubular dysfunction, potentially resulting in acute kidney injury (AKI).

According to acute kidney injury criteria (AKIN), the most current diagnostic criteria for AKI is an abrupt (within 48 hrs.) reduction in kidney function currently defined as an absolute increase in serum creatinine of more than or equal to 0.3 mg/dl, or1.5 fold from baseline or a reduction in urine output (documented oliguria of < 0.5 ml/kg per hr. for >6 hr.).

Methods: A cohort study was performed in patients over 18 years old with AKI who required CRRT in the intensive care unit of a university hospital in Bogota Colombia between 2009 and 2014. The CRRT was provided with Aquarius\u00ae Edwards\u00ae technology, polyethersulfone membrane of 1.2 and 1.4 m2 (Aquamax\u00ae) and replacement fluids with lactate (Premixed\u00ae). Modality selection were guided by the hospital guideline. Sample size calculation was estimated selecting 10 cases (death) for each variable associated with mortality. A description of demographic and clinical variables was performed, bivariate analysis with mortality and early death defined as death within 24 hours of onset of CRRT, and finally we proceed to perform a multivariate prediction analysis. We considered statistically significant p value < 0.05. Results: A total of 214 patients required CRRT during the period, 20 (9.34 %) patients were excluded, (age under 18 years old, incomplete data and 10 chronic kidney disease on dialysis). The mean age was 61.5 years (\u00b115.47), 57.73 % men. The most frequent cause of AKI was sepsis in 30.9 % of cases.

Escherichia coli was the most frequently observed bacteria. The results of the univariate analysis for ESBL acquisition are presented in Table 93. In multivariate analysis, IGS-II and ICU length of stay were strongly associated with ESBL acquisition (Table 94). Discussion and conclusion: The observed rate of ESBL carriage on admission was comparable to other rates in French ICUs (15 %). Despite the unfavourable twin-bed architecture of our ICU, the incidence of ESBL acquisition was 4.3 % which was actually lower than transmission rates previously published in other ICUs.

Demographics, causes and rhythms of presentation and neurological outcome -measured with Cerebral Performance Category scale -were collected. In between the two steps the the 2 nd edition of the Italian National Campaign, (Settimana Viva!) was organised to teach BLS-D to the population. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 20. Results: A total of 1208 (step 1) and 1371 (step 2) patients experiencing OHCA were recruited.

A Cox\u00b4s proportional Hazard Model allowed us to assess that the presence of a Bystander-CPR (i) reduces of about one third the risk of extra-hospital death (HR: 0.37, 95 % CI: 0.28-0.51, p < 0.001) and above all (ii) is associate with a significantly better neurological outcome at discharge from hospital (p = 0.027 HR 0.51 0.27-0.93).

Objectives: To assess splenic Doppler resistive index variations in response to fluid challenge, in a population of cardiac surgery patients receiving mechanical ventilation and requiring a fluid challenge. Methods: Splenic Doppler was used to measure resistive index before and after fluid challenge. Results: Of the 27 patients included, 14 (52 %) met our definition for fluid challenge responsiveness, that is at least a 15 changes after fluid challenge were +35 % (\u00b119 %) in fluid challenge responders and +6 % (\u00b15 %) in fluid challenge non-responders. Splenic Doppler resistive index was reduced after fluid challenge in responders (0.66 [\u00b10.12] before and 0.56 [\u00b10.12] after fluid challenge; p < 0.001) while was unchanged in non-responders (0.65 [\u00b10.07] before and 0.65 [\u00b10.08] after fluid challenge; p = 0.601). Splenic Doppler Resistive Index changes after fluid challenge were +16 % (\u00b19 %) in fluid challenge responders and +4 % (\u00b13 %) in fluid challenge non-responders.Cardiac index variations (DCI) showed a strong correlation with splenic Doppler resistive index changes (DSDRI) after fluid challenge in the overall population (r = 0.85, p < 0.001).

In the current study, we thus hypothesized that pretransplant low mean arterial pressure (MAP) may be predictive of the development of postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) in liver transplant (LT) recipients.. Objectives: To explore the relationship between pretransplant mean atterial pressure and the development of postopertative acute kidney injury in liver transplant recipients Methods: Of the 1531 patients who have normal pretransplant creatinine level (<1.5 mg/dL) between May 2010 and October 2015, complete electronic medical records of 1200 consecutive LT recipients (mean age: 53 years; 76 % male; 95 % living-donor LT) were retrospectively evaluated. MAP was collected from the average of preoperative daily blood pressure measurements. Postoperative AKI was defined as 2012 KDIGO (Kidney Diseases: Improving Global Outcomes) criteria. Results: The overall prevalence of AKI was 42.5 % in this study cohort. A quartile (Q) analysis of MBP showed range of MAP: 59-75 mmHg (Q1), 76-81 mmHg (Q2), 82-88 mmHg (Q3), 88-122 mmHg (Q4), respectively.

Methods: Prospective study from 2003 to 2015 in a 20-bed ICU in an university hospital. All MRB (MRSA, P aeruginosa, A baumannii, ESBL Klebsiella pn, ESBL-E coli, C difficile) producing colonization or infection were documented. They were counted 1 time by MRB. Surveillance was introduced in 2006 (at admission and 1 times weekly) and in 2013 a national control program was implemented Zero Resistance). The incidence density (ID) was calculated for 1000 days in ICU. Negative Binomial regression models were fitted to the incident number of infections with an offset with the annual number of ICU stays. Results: A total of 815 MRB were acquired during the 79896 ICU days of stay (ID 10,2 x 1000 ICU days). In 306 cases were infections (ID 3,82) and 509 colonization (ID 6,38).

Objectives: The objective of this study was to establish the relationship between continuous EEG abnormalities, organ failure and mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Methods: This is a prospective, multi center, observational study. Continuous EEG for 12 hours was performed in all consecutive patients acutely admitted in ICU for severe sepsis and sepstic shock from community-acquired infection, within 72 hours from admission. In this pilot prospective study of 19 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, continuous EEG with a Synek score \u22653 was more common in patients that developed delirium and among non survivors. To assess the incidence and risk factors for EVD-related infections in critically ill patients with acute cerebral pathology. Methods: Retrospective study of patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (2014-2015) requiring placement of an EVD due to acute cerebral pathology. Epidemiological and clinical data were collected, as well as data related to the EVD: insertion site, samples of CSF and microbiological isolates. EVD-related infection was defined as the presence of systemic signs of infection associated with an inflammatory CSF. Descriptive analysis was expressed as a mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range) for quantitative variables and percentages for qualitative. The association of factors related to EVD infections was performed using simple logistic regression, with the corresponding Odds Ratio. Results: 27 patients were analyzed, 14 patients with moderate and 13 with severe ARDS,12 females and 15 males; mortality was of 52 %,13 survivors (sv) and 14 non survivors (nsv). The mean APACHE II score was 26 points (23 pts in sv vs 29 pts in nsv),mean SOFA score of 12 points (11 pts in sv vs13 pts in nsv). The median age was 46.07 years, with a median of 49.07 yrs in sv vs 43.28 yrs in nsv. The median body-mass index was 33.3,29.4 in sv vs 37 in nsv.In this study the main differences in the group of non survivors patients in comparisson with survivors were a higher bodymass index, higher scores in mortality prediction scales, a minor age, a lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio at entry in ICU, the need of higher levels of PEEP, and a higher need of CRRT as reflect of progression to MODS. The emergence of H1 N1 pneumonia leading on to ARDS with its catastrophic course changed the very outlook of how to approach viral pneumonia in adults. The window of time period is very limited in which to act and rapidly deteriorating oxygen saturation despite high PEEP and Fio2 requirement necessitates expedient measures to halt the fast deteriorating process. In this scenario we attempted to use corticosteroids and got excellent results. Score was measured to be 3.35 \u00b1 0.42 at the time of admission and was decreased to 1.8 \u00b1 0.9 on day 7 of hospitalisation. In hospital mortality was found to be only 13 % ( 20 out of 23 patients survived) Conclusions: In Patients of H1 N1 with confirmed ARDS, administration of early & prolonged low dose corticosteroids showed significant improvement in lung function with prevention of fibrosis and permanent pulmonary damage. It was also associated with significant low in hospital mortality.Introduction: National priority heart transplantation for severe acute heart failure has increased.

Endotracheal suctioning (ETS) is the main strategy to prevent mucus retention, but its effects are limited to the first bronchial bifurcation. Mechanical in-exsufflation (MI-E) is a non-invasive chest physiotherapy (CPT) technique aimed to generate high expiratory flows to simulate cough, and improve mucus clearance in the proximal airways. To date, no studies have assessed the effects of MI-E in intubated and sedated critically ill patients. Objectives: To investigate the factors related to SP from three different perspectives: direct observation, questionnaire and asking the nurse when not complying with the recommendation. Methods: Descriptive, longitudinal and multicenter study in 6 Spanish intensive care units (ICU). Patients were included if they were under mechanical ventilation >48 h, \u226518 years old and had no contraindication for SP, were not mechanically ventilated during the previous 7 days or were not intubated in pre-hospital setting.

In multivariate analysis the most relevant factors related to a decreased SP compliance according to measurements were the ICU(p < 0.001), agitation [OR 0.39 (CI95% 0.28-0.54)], renal replacement therapy [OR 0.56 (CI95% 0.47-0.66)], abdominal vacuum therapy [OR 0.59 (CI95% 0.37-0.95)] and open abdomen [OR 0.65 (CI95% 0.50-0.85)]. From staff nurses, 2146 reasons for non-compliance were obtained. The most frequent causes were incorrect visual perception (n = 568) and that the HOBE measuring device from the bed indicated 30\u00b0(n = 460). Patient's clinical conditions represented 33.2 % (n = 742) of the causes for non-compliance whilst factors related to patient care represented 66.3 %(n = 1484). Finally, 223 questionnaires were obtained (77.8 % response rate). According to the results, the most relevant factors with a negative effect to SP compliance were clinical contraindications for SP (98.7 %), patient discomfort (89.2 %), abdominal surgery with open abdomen (85.7 %), unavailability of beds with HOBE measuring device (80.7 %), lack of awareness of the importance of the measure (79.8 %) and lack of experience in critical care (77.6 %).", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF17": {"text": "abstract A861).

Methods: A qualitative descriptive approach was used. Semi-structured focus group interviews were conducted with adult critical care nurses from four Intensive Care Units, two in Australia and two in New Zealand. Results: Twenty-one critical care nurses participated in the study. The focus groups ranged from 39-58 minutes. Participants had a mean of 13 years experience in critical care and all had experience of treatment withdrawal and providing end-of-life care. Inductive content analysis was used to identify five key themes. READING THE ROOM describes the need to look for non-verbal and other cues to help guide initiating communication. ESTABLISHING THE WHO was seen as important in building rapport and aided in establishing trust. NAVIGATING HOW to communicate was considered just as important as the content. Similarly, JUDGING WHEN to communicate was equally essential to aid family understanding and coping. ASSESSING WHAT to say was individually tailored to each family. In terms of WHERE, participants reported that the art of nurse-family communication was learnt on the job.Conclusions:Initiating and managing communication with family during treatment withdrawal is a complex and multi-faceted nursing activity that can have significant impact on families. There is need for support and education that develops both the art, as well as the science, in this frequently encountered aspect of end-of-life care.Truog, R.D., et al., Recommendations for end-of-life care in the intensive care unit: a consensus statement by the American College of Critical This study was partially funded by an Experience Researcher Grant from the Australian College of Critical Care Nurses, Australia A868 Taper-shaped endotracheal cuffs in the prevention of endotracheal tube-associated pneumonia (ETAP): a systematic review and metaanalysis of randomized controlled clinical trials B.

Bucknall -St George's, University of London, London, United Kingdom Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):A922 Introduction: Measuring renal function in acute kidney injury (AKI) is difficult. The criteria on which a clinical diagnosis of AKI is made are broad and open to interpretation. More objective measures remain elusive.A truly robust biomarker has not been discovered and exogenous markers are difficult to use in critically ill patients. We have previously used measures of renal clearance of Iohexol (rICl) to evaluate AKI (data submitted) and have shown that 1-hour renal creatinine clearances (1-CrCl) correlate well with rICl (correlation r = 0.99; Bland Altman bias \u22125.6, SD 24.1 %) performing better than 4 hourly CrCl measurements (bias 11.4 % SD 56.7 %). Objective: To use sequential 1-CrCl measurements to measure renal function in critically ill patients with or at risk of AKI over 72 hours and to compare this with traditional methods of assessing AKI. This was part of a BSc project. Methods: Consent was obtained from the next of kin according to ethical review (NREC: 15/LO/1720). 1-hour urine samples were collected at 7 am and 7 pm. Serum creatinine (SCr) samples were taken 30 min after the urine collections were started. SCr and urine creatinine (UCr) concentrations were measured using the enzymatic method by the dedicated researcher. 1-CrCl was calculated by the equation: CrCl \u00bc \u00f0UCr \u00c2 vol\u00de1:73=\u00f0\u00f0SCr /min)xBSA). 1-CrCls were compared with the\u00b4kidney disease improving global outcomes( KDIGO) criteria for AKI and estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault (CG), modification of diet in renal disease 7 (MDRD7) and chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (CKI-EPI) methods. Kruskal Wallis, Spearman correlation and the Bland-Altman method were used (IBM\u00ae SPSS\u00ae version 22) in analysis. CrCl vs MDRD7 = 0.845). However the eGFR did not predict actual values. The Bland Altman comparisons for CKD-epi and MDRD7 are inTable 28.Fig 51 compares 1-CrCl with the KDIGO criteria Conclusions: Despite good correlations, the eGFR calculated values were not good measures of actual renal function. 1-CrCl was often although not always markedly lower than the eGFR. The KDIGO criteria did reflect the measured 1-CrCl but there was marked overlap in all categories.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF59": {"text": "of Intensive Care Medicine and Surrey Peri-Operative Anaesthesia and Critical Care Collaborative Research Group (SPACER), Guildford, United Kingdom; 2 Department of Anaesthesia, Royal Surrey County Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Guildford, United Kingdom; Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, Exeter, United Kingdom; 4 South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Torquay, United Kingdom; Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Royal United Hospital Bath NHS Trust, Bath, United Kingdom; 6 Department of Surgery, Royal United Hospital Bath NHS Trust, Bath, United Kingdom Correspondence: J.

Intensive Care Unit (ICU), St George Hospital, Sydney. Methods: We enrolled medical and nursing staff with varying levels of ICU experience after obtaining informed consent. We used a standardised clinical scenario and the same human patient simulator for all simulation sessions. The actions of the participants determined the outcome of the scenario. We assessed the emotional state of each participant before and after the completion of the scenario using an eight-item scale containing bipolar oppositional descriptors of emotion. 1. We asked the participants to rate their emotion on a 5-point Likert scale with anchors at \u22122 and +2 representing the bipolar opposites. We assessed the cognitive load of each participant after the completion of the scenario using a validated subjective rating tool2. We asked the participants to rate their cognitive load on a scale of 1 to 9, with higher scores indicating higher mental effort. Results: A total of 103 medical and nursing staff were studied. following simulation. There was no difference in the mean scores for the remaining 5 items. The mean cognitive load for all participants was high (6.67 \u00b1 1.41) and was not different in medical and nursing staff. There was no association between pre or post-simulation emotional state and cognitive load. Conclusion: Simulation had a positive effect on the emotional state despite high cognitive load. Further studies are needed to determine their relationship with learning ability.A926 Quality of life of children 12 months after emergency admission to intensive care R.A. Pulham 1 , J. Wray 1 , K.

Objectives: To describe health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after ICU discharge and to identify its predictors. Methods: The Argentinian Society of Critical Care launched a multicenter cohort study which enrolled patients receiving mechanical ventilation (MV) >72 hr.(3/5-8/31/2014). Epidemiological data and events were collected. Pre-ICU, and at 2, 6 and 12 months after discharge, HRQOL was recorded with the EQ-5D questionnaire (EQ-Index and EQ-EVA) together with relevant physical, neuropsychological and other variables. Values at different time points were compared versus pre ICU time with Wilcoxon signed rank test. We performed longitudinal data analysis to evaluate the effect of time on EQ-Index adjusting for important covariates, building a marginal model with generalized estimating equations. Results: 320 patients from 26 ICUs were included:age 50[29-66], 41 % had Charlson score \u2265 2, 48 % married; 51 % occupied; 65 % from public hospitals; APACHE II 18 \u00b1 7, SOFA24hs 7 \u00b1 4; 51 % medical admissions; 23 % trauma; 51 % shock, 45 % ARDS. 1-year mortality was 22 %.

Pifferi -Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Neuroscience Intensive Care Unit, Milan, Italy Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):A933Introduction: Cerebral vasospasm (VSP) is the narrowing of cerebral vessels. It occurs in up to 67 % of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH) and contributes to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and neurological deterioration (symptomatic VSP = sVSP) in 30 % of patients. Transcranial color coded sonography (TCCS) is a non-invasive bedside technique that allows the measure of mean blood flow velocity (mFV) of cerebral arteries. The range of normality is 55-85 cm/sec, whereas mFV >120 cm/s is currently used as a threshold to define TCCS vasospasm (1). Objectives: To analyse TCCS mFV variation over time in patients with aSAH and evaluate the prognostic utility of a daily TCCS monitoring. Methods: All consecutive patients admitted to our ICU after aSAH were enrolled in the study. Mean blood flow velocity (mFV) of middle cerebral arteries on either side was obtained every 1-2 day for 14 days after the bleeding. We defined sVSP as a new neurological deterioration associated to radiological VSP evaluated with MRI angiography. Results: 80 patients (age 26-80 years old) were included; 714 TCCS exams were performed. Only 13 patients (16 %) had normal TCCS mFV throughout the study period. 67 patients (84 %) presented mFV increase over time, with the highest values between 8 and 12 days after the bleeding (median 9, IQR 6-11). Among these, 49 patients (61 %) had mFV \u2265120 cm/s and 21 (26 %) had mFV \u2265200 cm/s. Symptomatic VSP occurred in 20 patients (25 %), the median time of neurological deterioration was 7 days (IQR 5-10) after the bleeding. Patients who developed sVSP (sVSP yes) displayed significantly higher mFV starting from day 5 up to day 14 compared to patients without sVSP (sVSP no); the median time of TCCS vasospasm (mFV >120 cm/s) was 4 days (IQR 3-6). Accuracy of TCCS in diagnosing sVSP is displayed in theTable 34. Conclusions: MeanFV time variation is significantly different in patients with or without sVSP. Daily TCCS monitoring with a threshold of 120 cm/s permits to identify 95 % of patients who will have symptomatic VSP but specificity is low. Patients at greater risk of sVSP are those with early mFV increase (>120 cm/s within 9 days), rapid mFV increase (>50 cm/s in 48 hours) or higher mFV absolute values (>200 cm/sec).DIFFERENT ASPECTS ON OUTCOME IN THE ICUA934 Development and validation of a model to evaluate the application of human resources practices of high commitment, guided to the quality of service from the perspective of ICU healthcare staff C.

TCCS accuracy in predicting symptomatic vasospasm formed by 4 dimensions (training, participation, recognition, and communication). The QUALITY model is a model of second order formed by six dimensions (personal attention, ability of response, waiting room, tangibility, sensory experience, and meals). The CAP-ACITY model is a construct of second order formed by six dimensions referred to the satisfaction of different aspects (information, communication, facilities, additional services, decision maker's staff and nondecision maker's staff). The results of the PATH model indicate that it is an excellent model (CFI > 0,95 and RMFEA < 0,08). From the causal relationships of this model we can tell that(1)the HR influences positively and significantly on the QUALITY; (2) the HR and the QUALITY influence positively and significantly on the CAPACITY; (3) the RH and QUALITY influence on the SATISFACTION and (4) the CAPACITY and SATISFACTION influence positively and significantly on the COMMITMENT. Conclusions: The results of this model indicates that the implementation of a HR strategy supported by a quality management significantly influences on the performance of the ICUs in terms of staff satisfaction, just as with the personal satisfaction and the commitment of healthcare workers.

There is mounting evidence that conventional screening tests are insufficient to capture the degree of cognitive dysfunction experienced by ICU survivors. The KINARM robot provides robust, objective, and quantitative metrics of the sensorimotor and neurocognitive impairments in humans. It has been used to describe impairments post stroke and importantly, deficits identified with the KINARM correlate well with reductions in quality of life.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF69": {"text": "Results: From February 2014-February 2016, we have performed 41 KINARM assessments (12 pre-cardiac surgery, 12 post-cardiac surgery, 10 post critical illness, 7 post cardiac arrest). Compared to all groups, survivors of critical illness performed worse on several tasks that assess the visuomotor control of the upper limb, interlimb coordination, proprioception, and visuospatial processing. Impairments in executive tasks were noted across all participants. While the KINARM tasks tended to cluster together (i.e. visuospatial, executive), the patient cohorts did not. Conclusions: Robotic technology can provide precise and quantitative metrics of the sensorimotor and cognitive deficits after critical illness. These strategies may be able to define a specific neurocognitive phenotype of the ICU survivor.Grant Acknowledgement This work is supported by Physician Services Incorporated and the Southeastern Ontario Medical Associations' New Clinician-Scientist Program.

Their medium team outcomes are not clear when compared with patients between 60-79 years old. Objectives: To evaluate the clinical outcome (2-year mortality) of very elderly critically ill patients (> = 80 years old) and compared with those between 60 and 79 years old. Methods: Retrospective analysis of administrative data of patients admitted between 1/1/2009 and 31/12/2013 to an ICU of a regional hospital in Hong Kong. Results: Over 5 years, 4226 patients aged \u226560 years old were admitted (55.5 % total ICU admission) and 32.8 % with age \u226580 years old. Proportion of patients > =80 years old increased over 5 years (16.2 % in 2009, 18.9 % in 2010, 16.0 % in 2011, 20.3 % in 2012, and 19.4 % in 2013; P = 0.006).. Those > =80 years old carried more significant co-morbidities and with higher disease severity. They required more ventilatory support, less likely to receive renal replacement therapy and with higher ICU/hospital/180day and 2-year mortality when compared with those aged 60-79. 71.8 % could be discharged home while 47.6 % can survive 2 years from ICU admission. Cox regression analysis revealed that age, APACHEIV-minus-Age score, gender, medical or neurosurgical cases, presence of significant co-morbidities (chronic renal failure, metastatic carcinoma, lymphoma, leukemia or myeloma), regular use of immunosuppressant and requirement of mechanical ventilation or renal replacement therapy during ICU stay independently predicted 2-year mortality.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF71": {"text": "Conclusions: The proportion of critically ill patients with age > =80 years old increased over 5 years.

Castro Arias -Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):A940Introduction: It is quite frequent for elderly patients to die in the hospital after prolonged stay in the ICU with life-sustaining interventions (LSI). In many cases we prolong survival, reducing their quality at the end of life. Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate outcomes in patients \u2265 80 years old admitted to the surgical ICU, and also the need for LSI. Methods: This is an observational retrospective study. All the patients older than 80 years admitted to our surgical ICU between June 2012 and June 2015 have been included. We have studied the mortality of these patients both in the ICU and in the hospital, the length of stay and the need for LSI. We also have analysed the risk factors associated to both ICU and hospital mortality. Results: 299 patients were included (of a total ICU population of 2492 patients in that period). Average age of our patients was 84.43 \u00b1 3.55 years. Mean SAPS II was 45.48 \u00b1 14.59. Mean length of stay in ICU and in hospital were 5.47 \u00b1 7.61 and 18.15 \u00b1 15.27 days, respectively. Mortality in ICU has resulted in 18.1 %, whilst in the hospital, in global terms, it has resulted in 26.8 %. Regarding the need for LSI, 10.0 % underwent renal replacement therapy, 50.2 % required vasopressors and 34.8 % required mechanical ventilation during more than 24 hours. Patients who received vasopressors had a hospital mortality of 46.0 %, those receiving mechanical ventilation during more than 24 h had a mortality of 58.7 %, and patients receiving renal replacement therapy had a mortality of 80.0 %. Of the patients who died in the hospital, 86.2 % were treated with vasopressors, 76.2 % received mechanical ventilation during more than 24 hours and 30.0 % underwent renal replacement therapy. 50 % of patients dying in the ICU died at least 17 days after admission. 25 % of the patients died at least 42 days after ICU admission. The decision on the limitation of LSI is not always easy and it is critical to maintain a good doctor-patient communication. By stopping extraordinary treatments when appropriately indicated, life quality at the final stages of elderly patients would improve. We consider that is important to raise ethical issues for healthrelated professionals on the utilization of aggressive life-sustaining interventions at the final stages of elderly patients' life at surgical ICUs.A941 Frailty in intensive care: a retrospective review L.K.

FrailtyA942 One year survival data for patients aged over 80 admitted to two British general intensive care units N. Singh Royal Berkshire Hospital, Critical Care Unit, Reading, United Kingdom Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):A942 Introduction: Over the last decade increasing numbers of elderly patients are being admitted to intensive care units (ITU). This reflects an aging population and increasing expectations of care delivered to the elderly. However it remains unclear if admission to ITU changes the eventual outcome in this patient group. Several studies have shown poor outcomes in elderly patients. de Rooij et al. reported one year survival of 57 % in those over 80 admitted after planned surgery, compared with only 11 % survival in those admitted after unplanned surgery or from medical causes 1 . Biston et al. reported one year mortality of 97 % in patients aged over 85 treated for circulatory failure 2 .Objectives: This service evaluation assesses 1 year survival of patients over the age of 80 admitted to a tertiary centre and a large district general hospital ITU in Britain in 2013 to allow comparison to published data. Methods: Admission patient data was obtained from the ITU clinical information system for 2013. The hospital electronic patient record was used to determine the last point of patient contact with the hospital. If this was less than a year after initial admission and the patient was documented as alive they were assumed to have lived to a year for the purpose of data analysis. Results: 1884 patients were admitted to the ITUs, of which 208 were aged 80 or above. Data was not available for one patient. Of the 207 patients for whom data was available, the mean age was 84.3 years. Data for 23 of these patients was not available to a year. Of the 133 surgical patients, 49(36.8 %) were admitted after elective and 84(63.2 %) after emergency surgery. At one year, 39 of the elective patients were alive and 31 of the emergency patients. Of the 74 medical patients only 24(32.4 %) patients survived to 1 year. Within both surgical and medical groups 61(29.5 %) patients were admitted with sepsis and 42(68.9 %) were dead after 1 year. Of the 207 patients, 94(45.4 %) survived to one year or more and 113(55.6 %) did not. If the patients who were admitted after elective surgery were excluded that left 158 unplanned admissions in total, with only 55(34.8 %) patients surviving for more than one year.Conclusions: Although this data shows better survival for unplanned admissions than previous studies, outcomes are still poor for elderly patients who are admitted to ITU. This should inform discussions with patients and their relatives relating to admission to ITU and escalation of care.A943 The implantation of an antimicrobial stewardship programme in intensive care units is also possible. Analysis of the results of the first year in a secondary Andalusian hospital S. Vitaller, H. Nagib, J. Prieto, A. Del Arco, B. Zayas, C. Gomez Hospital Costa del Sol Marbella, Malaga, Spain Correspondence: S. Vitaller -Hospital Costa del Sol Marbella, Malaga, Spain Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):A943Background: Despite the fact that there is evidence of results of the stewardship programme in conventional hospitalization, results in intensive care units are more limited. The aim of this review is to analyse the results of the first year of stewardship programme implantation in the intensive care unit of an andalusian second level hospital. Material/methods: HCS is a secondary hospital, which provides 350 beds. It has a general ICU with 12 beds. Since 2014, there is a program to optimize antibiotic therapy in ICU, where the services of microbiology, pharmacy, infectious diseases and ICU are involved. The pharmacy department sends a daily report with the broad spectrum antibiotics prescribed in the ICU and they are contrasted with the available microbiological data of all patients admitted to the unit. The main objective is the reduction of antibacterial spectrum when feasible and the duration of treatment. In this paper, data from 2014 is contrasted with data from 2013. Antimicrobial consumption, impact on infections of special microorganisms, and savings in annual drug spending are evaluated.Throughout 2014, the ICU team evaluated 108 cases of patients admitted to the unit with broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. DDD/1000 admissions of imipenem was 149 against 155, and DDD/1000 hospital stay was 56 versus 68; to meropenem DDD/1000 admissions was 189 against 343 and DDD/1000 hospital stay was 71 versus 110. The number of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in first sample was 15 cases in 2013 compared to 11 in 2014. The strains with resistance or intermediate sensitivity to IMP were 5/15 in 2013 (33 %), while it was only 1/11 (9 %) in 2014. First samples of MRSA, in 2013, were 3, whereas there was only one in 2014. Two cases of Klebsiella pneumoniae ESBL were identified in 2013 and 3 cases in 2014. There was one case of Clostridium difficile in 2013 and none in 2014. Expenses in antimicrobials, antifungals included, decreased by 19 % (11,000 euros). Conclusions: 1. Implementation of an ICU antimicrobial stewardship programme produced an optimization of antimicrobial therapy in 42.5 % of cases, mainly by reducing the antibacterial spectrum. 2. Use of carbapenems (IMP/MER) was significantly reduced (DDD difference of \u221217 % and \u221234 % respectively), confirming a tendency in growth in the susceptibility profile of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 3.

Patients whose blood glucose measured every 4 hours/ day during their ICU stay were included. Patients whose stay is less than 48 hours and those who underwent surgical intervention were excluded. Measures of glycemic variability (Mean Blood Glucose (MBG) and Glycemic lability Index (GLI)) were calculated. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed on variables found to be significantly associated with mortality. For the similar APACHE 2 score, elderly patients have greater glycemic variability , which could have contributed to the increased mortality. Amongst the glycemic variability indices tested, GLI was found to be better predictor than MBG.References 1.

Chen -Chia Nan University of Pharmacy and Science, Recreation and Health-Care Management, Tainan, Taiwan, Province of China Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):A1086 Introduction: This study is to assess the effect of liver cirrhosis (LC) on the poorly understood long-term mortality risk after a first-ever mechanical ventilation (1-MV) for acute respiratory failure. Objectives: All patients given a 1-MV between 1997 and 2013 from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 (LHID2000) which randomly selected 1,000,000 beneficiaries in 2000 were identified. Methods: Patients with LC were individually matched to patients without LC (ratio: 1:2) using a propensity-score method. The primary outcome was death after a 1-MV. Results: A total of 16,695 patients were enrolled, including the 5,565 LC patients and 11,130 controls without LC. Patients with LC had more organ failures and more likely to admit to medical department than controls without LC. Patients with LC had a lower survival rate than patients without LC (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.41; 95 % CI: 1.36-1.47). Moreover, the risk of mortality was highest among patients with LC (HR: 1.60, 95 % CI: 1.53-1.67,) followed by patients with cryptogenic LC (HR: 1.08, 95 % CI: 1.01-1.15) and patients without LC. Conclusions: Compared to controls without LC, patients with LC and cryptogenic LC, can increase the mortality risk after a 1-MV. Introduction: Critically ill patients under mechanical ventilation (MV) were often complicated by pleural effusion. Improvement in USguided procedure brings both early diagnosis and safe management. However, there was limited evidence in the benefit of effusion drainage and the impact on ultimate results. Objectives: We designed this study to investigate effect of effusion drainage in patients under MV and to reveal the prognosis and risk factors for weaning failure. Methods: Following a retrospective review from January to December 2014, 80 patients who underwent drainage of pleural effusion via small bore tube during MV care were enrolled. We compared respiratory rate and parameters of arterial blood gas analysis performed before and after drainage of pleural effusion. Also, risk factors for weaning failure and prognostic parameters were investigated. Results: The median age of the patients was 72 years and 50 % was male. Of total 80 Patients, 30 patients (37.5 %) could discharge from hospital without need for MV. Thirty six patients (45 %) died in our hospital. Respiratory rate decreased after drainage of effusion (22 [IQR 18-29] vs 21 per min [17-26], p = 0.011). Partial oxygen pressure (PaO 2 ) increased after drainage (98 [82-125] vs 112 mmHg [81-132], p = 0.021). However, other parameters of arterial blood gas did not show difference between before and after drainage. Among fourteen (17.5 %) and 39 (51.3 %) patients, MV support level could be decreased within one hour and one day respectively. However, there was no difference in the frequency of lowering the support level between weaning success and weaning failure group (one hour, p = 0.65; one day, p = 0.78). Improvement of PaO 2 after drainage was also not associated the result of weaning success (60 vs 66 % in weaning success vs failure group, p = 0.59). In this study, we revealed improvement of respiratory rate and PaO 2 after effusion drainage via small bore chest tube in the patients under MV treatment. However, increase of PaO 2 was not associated with weaning success. Instead, we suggest disease severity or heart failure, rather than immediate improvement of PaO 2 after drainage, may have an association with the risk for weaning failure.

Results: During study period, 460 adults were admitted to the ICU, while 302 were mechanically ventilated. We excluded 279 patients because of impaired consciousness or mechanical ventilation (MV) duration less than 4 days. Among remaining 23 patients, six (26 %) were diagnosed as ICU-AW. Basic profiles and APACHE II score were not different between the patients with and without ICU-AW. NMBA and corticosteroids were administered in 1 and 2 ICU-AW patients, respectively. Blood glucose, electrolytes, creatinine kinase, and albumin levels were not different between the patients with and without ICU-AW. Duration of MV and length of hospital stay were longer in patients with ICU-AW than in patients without ICU-AW (median[IQR], 11.5 [7.3 -40.8] vs. 4 [4.0 -7.5] days and 75 [58.8 -103.3] vs. 37 [25.0 -72.5] days, respectively). Three patients with ICU-AW were tracheostomized. ICU-AW was diagnosed as early as on 5th MV day. Hospital mortality was 17 % (1/6) in ICU-AW patients and 24 % (4/17) in non-ICU-AW patients. Discussion. The incidence of ICU-AW was 26 % at our ICU, while it reportedly varied 25-100 %. In line with previous reports, duration of MV and length of hospital stay were significantly longer in the patients with ICU-AW. We included the patients who were mechanically ventilated at least 4 days, and one of our patients was diagnosed as ICU-AW as early as on 5th MV day. ICU-AW usually develops in the patients who are mechanically ventilated prolonged periods. The number of enrolled patients in the present study was small, and we could not find any factors related to early onset of ICU-AW. Conclusions: Prolonged MV is a risk factor of ICU-AW. However, we should be aware that ICU-AW can develop in a shorter period than we expect.A1089Assessment of respiratory support methods in patients with intracranial hypertension in severe traumatic brain injuryA.

Antonucci -Guglielmo da Saliceto Hospital, Intermediate Care Unit, Piacenza, Italy Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):A1090 Introduction: Intermediate Care Unit (IMCU) may provide more intensive monitoring and patient management than the general ward but less than are offered in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) 1 . Patients undergoing tracheostomy usually need invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and prolonged ICU stay with increased hospital costs and mortality rate. Objectives: We hypothesized that IMCU may represent a valid option to manage critically ill patients undergoing tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation and reduce ICU stay. Methods: We reviewed all patients discharged from Piacenza ICU and directly admitted in our IMCU (from June 2014 to December 2015, 19 months). The inclusion criteria were age \u2265 18 y.o., need of IMV, tracheostomy performing during ICU stay. We collected demographic characteristics, comorbidities, reasons for ICU admission; complications during IMCU stay and timing of tracheostomy (early: \u2264 10 days after tracheal intubation; late: > 10 days after tracheal intubation). We analyzed rate of decannulation, IMCU mortality and mortality at 28 days after IMCU discharge. Results: 57 from a total of 145 analyzed patients (39,3 %) respected inclusion criteria. Patients' characteristics, comorbidities and causes of admission are shown in the tables. Median timing of tracheostomy was 12 days (3-28) with 22/57 patients (38,6 %) undergoing early tracheostomy and 35/57 patients (61,4 %) undergoing late tracheostomy. We decannulated 16/57 patients (28,1 %) in a median time of 15 days (1-42). Figure 113 summarizes causes of decannulation failure, while Figure 114 shows the most common complications occurred during IMCU stay. Death occurred in 13/57 patients (22,8 %) during IMCU stay and in 7/44 patients (15,9 %) at 28 days after IMCU discharge. All decannulated patients survived at 28 days after IMCU discharge. Both decannulated and not decannulated patients had no significant differences in terms of age and BMI. SAPS2 score was significant higher in not decannulated patients (p = 0.01). Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) acquired during IMCU stay seemed correlate with decannulation failure although not in a statistical significant mode (p = 0.078). Timing of tracheostomy was not related with mortality rate at 28 days after IMCU discharge (early 36,4 % vs late 34,3 %) and with decannulation rate (p = 0.48) . Conclusions: Patients undergoing tracheostomy need prolonged hospital stay and usually develop medical complications. IMCU may represent an alternative approach to manage these patients accelerating ICU discharge. Decannulated patients show better survival rate than not decannulated.

Early mobilisation programmes are prioritised and included. Understanding and investigating patient perception and satisfaction with regard to healthcare is vital in both the assessment and improvement of quality of care. Objectives: To describe patient perceptions and satisfaction regarding the physiotherapy care received during their surgical ICU stay. Methods: An interpretive and descriptive qualitative design was used. Patients were included via purposive sampling. Audiotaped, semistructured interviews of 25/60 minutes each were completed within 3 days of discharge from ICU. Data was transcribed and analysed via inductive and interpretive content analysis. Trustworthiness of results was ensured through reflexivity, checking of transcriptions, peer review and member checking. Results: Eighteen patients, ten males, were purposefully selected for the primary study. The median patient age was 44 years and the median ICU length of stay was six days. Twelve themes arose from the data analysis. The importance of clear communication was highlighted. Communication and understanding acted as bridging factors to link the patient\u00b4s expectations and the comprehension of physiotherapy. Communication reassured the patients and aided them in knowing what to expect during physiotherapy activities and sessions. This reassurance and communication also assisted in making the patients feel comfortable, thus building a trustworthy relationship with the physiotherapists. Factors that would have decreased satisfaction with the physiotherapy care received were predominantly linked to pain and ultimately poor communication.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF150": {"text": "abstract A1090).

Andrade -Hospital Municipal Moyses Deutsch, ICU, Sao Paulo, Brazil Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):A1092Introduction: Authors report that more than one million patients per year require invasive mechanical ventilation considering the evidence of morbidity, mortality and high costs generated in the hospitalization of these patients. In many hospitals in developed countries, physiotherapy and seen as part of the treatment of patients in the ICU, 30 years early mobilization has been shown to reduce the time to weaning from ventilation and is the basis for functional recovery. Objectives: To compare the two groups evaluated the time spent on mechanical ventilation after 48 of hospitalization and number of calls received physical therapy in patients with early mobilization (CMP) with the group without early mobilization (SMP) Methods: This was a retrospective longitudinal study by collecting data from the records of patients treated in the ICU of the Hospital Municipal adult. Participants were patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for 48 hours, were admitted to the ICU between June 29 to August 31, 2012 and January 1 to February 28, 2013 in all clinical situations that characterize stable evolution. With exclusion were patients admitted to the ICU outside the study period, we did not stay for at least 48 h in VMI and clinical instability. Results: The study showed effectiveness in the use of the protocol reducing time VM. The SMP group had an average of 26.7 days while in IMV CMP group had an average of 10.16 days in VMI. We also observed a decrease in the quantity of care SMP group had an average of 73.07 calls while the group CMP 16.48 physiotherapy service. Conclusions: Given the above I am clear that the CMP group had significant values for the proposal that was employed, where we can see the decrease in time to VMI, decrease in number of visits. nursing staff and ICT performed a daily checklist in order to observe the issues accomplishment. If any item was found to be inadequate it was promptly corrected. Results: In June and December 2012 , adhesion to the whole bundle was 46 % and 100 % respectively, infection of the bloodstream related to CVC hemodialysis density was proportionally lower to bundle adhesion in the same period, in 2015 we not had any cases of bloodstream infection related to hemodialysis catheter. Conclusions: Continuing education and staff training are essential to achieve good results and zero number bloodstream infection related to hemodialysis catheter. Initial rates were extremely high even for Brazilian benchmarks, ICU team and ICT efforts were crucial for satisfactory results, as well the administrative board support, which turned this issue an institutional priority. Our goals are to reduce even more, implementing getting to zero\u00b4\u00b4program, maintaining a continuum effort to sustain these results.A1095 Comparison between patient acuity rating and modified early warnings score H.J.

Objectives: Our aim is to propose a more intuitive method predicting the risk among ward patients. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study from January 2015 to March 2016, patients were screened with automated alarm of abnormalities in vital sign and laboratory results. Four well trained, ICU-specialized RRT Nurses visited each patient randomly, and the patients were scored 1 to 7 according to patient acuity rating (PAR). Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) was calculated simultaneously. ICU admission, mortality, and the composite outcome within 7 days of evaluation were analyzed. PAR and MEWS were compared using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: Total of 1,134 cases was screened in this study. Within the 7 days of RRT Nurses visit, overall ICU admission, mortality, and the composite outcomes were 231 (20.4 %), 106 (9.3 %), and 310 (27.3 %) respectively. PAR more accurately predicted all outcomes compared to MEWS (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.754 vs 0.670 for ICU admission; 0.761 vs 0.635 for mortality; and 0.788 vs 0.668 for composite outcomes; P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Conclusions: PAR is simpler and more accurate than MEWS. Implementation of this tool may decrease unexpected in-hospital ICU admission and mortality. Further studies comparing PAR with other objective prediction models will be complementary.Introduction: The evolution of the techniques used in the intensive care over the past decades has led to better survival rates in patients with acute conditions and severely impaired vital functions. However, it has resulted in a growing number of patients who survive an acute event but who then become dependent on one or more life support techniques. Such patients are called chronically critically ill (CCI) patients. No categorical definition of the disease is currently available, although most patients are characterized by the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation. Objectives: The purpose of our study is to analyze the characteristics of patients requiring prolonged support with slow recovery, as defined by terms of intensive care unit (ICU) stay and", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF152": {"text": "1097Assessment of chronically critically ill patients admitted to the ICU and the impact on their family members R.R.L.

There are few studies about their characteristics. 1 The uncertain trajectory of CCI exposes the patient\u00b4s family to heightened levels of psychological distress. 2 Objectives: To assess the CCI Patients and their family members admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and identify their conditions during stay at ICU and at 30 post-ICU. Methods: A prospective study was conducted in a 22-bed adult general ICU. Patients were defined as CCI if they were at least 8 days in ICU plus one of six eligible clinical conditions: Mechanical ventilation for at least 96 hrs; tracheotomy; sepsis; severe wounds; stroke; traumatic brain injury. 1 Family members completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at ICU and 30-days after interview and respond the EQ-5D and KATZ index of patients. Results: Between May 2015 and March 2016, 66 patients fulfilled the criteria. Of the total, 62.1 % of patients had more than one criterion for CCI. Sepsis was the most common eligible condition (74.2 %) followed by mechanical ventilation (65.2 %). The mean of length of stay at ICU was 17.75 \u00b1 11.25 days and 48.86 \u00b1 36.73 days in hospital. The ICU mortality was 13.1 % and 30-days cumulative mortality was 30.3 %.

Characteristics of patients with ICU. Median (IQR)Demographic variables of the patients, ICU admission and tracheostomy indications, intubation history, method for tracheostomy procedure, ICU stay or tracheostomy duration, decannulation and/or recannulation status, early and late complications were recorded. Results: There were 442 patients who underwent tracheostomy during their ICU stay in 5 year. Mean age and mortality of the patients were 56 and 55.2 % respectively. Tracheostomy procedures were performed surgically in 29 patients. Mean tracheostomy performance day after ICU admission was 9.9 days. Tracheostomy incidence performed at 7. day or before, between 8 and 20 days and at 21. day or later after ICU admission were 181 (41 %), 250 (54,3 %) and 21 (4.8 %), respectively. Overall complication incidence was 7 % and the major complication was bleeding. Conclusions: The results of our study were in accordance with previous studies investigating tracheostomy timing and complication rates[1][2][3][4] . However, the mortality was higher in our study group. The main reason for high mortality may result from the fact that end of life decision is not supported by law in our country. For the reason we performed percutaneous tracheostomy to all patients who were highly predicted to die.Ribeir\u00e3o PretoMedical School, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Division of Intensive Care, Department of Surgery and Anatomy, Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Brazil; 2 Intensive Care Unit of S\u00e3o Francisco Hospital, Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Brazil; 3 Ribeir\u00e3o Preto Medical School, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Social Medicine Department, Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Brazil Correspondence: S.L. da Silva -Intensive Care Unit of S\u00e3o Francisco Hospital, Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Brazil Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):A1099Introduction: The dysnatremias (hypo and hypernatremia) are associated with increased mortality of critically ill patients. Literature suggests that serum sodium level imbalances on admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) may lead to a poor survival rates. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of serum sodium levels on admission and prognostic indexes to predict mortality of surgical critically ill patients. Methods: One thousand five hundred and ninety-nine surgical patients (57 % males and 43 % females; mean age of 60.6 \u00b1 14.4 years admitted to the ICU in the post-operative phase were retrospectively studied. The patients were classified according to the blood serum sodium levels (mmol/L) at admission as normonatremia (135-145), hyponatremia (<135) and hypernatremia (>145). Therefore, APACHE II, SAPS III and SOFA were recorded. The capability of each index to predict relative risk of ICU and Hospital mortality of surgical patients was analyzed by multiple logistic regression analysis. Relative Risk (RR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Results: The mean of APACHE II, SAPS III and SOFA were 13.9 \u00b1 7.9, 39.6 \u00b1 10.9, 4.8 \u00b1 2.5, respectively.

Demographics were collected from the electronic health record (EHR). Continuous bedside monitoring data stream includes heart rate, respiratory rate, and SpO 2 collected at 1/20 Hz, and intermittently recorded systolic and diastolic blood pressure. We discovered distinct relative risk (RR) escalation patterns among 918 CRI positive patients during the 4 hours immediately before CRI onset, following methods in[1]. We then tested for association of RR escalation patterns with the mean risk levels during the first 4 post-SDU admission hours, and independently with demographics (age, Charlson Comorbidity Index [CCI]), and SDU and hospital LOS) using ANOVA at 0.05 significance level.

Results: A total of 48 patients with prolonged ICU admission were included. Survival to ICU admission is 62.5 % (30/48) and intra-hospital of 43.75 % (21/48). In the follow-up, survival at 12 months of hospital discharge is 31.25 % (15/48). Regarding to functional status, it is observed that prolonged ICU admission conditioned an important and significant deterioration to functional level with a drastic drop in Barthel Index at hospital discharge compared with baseline Barthel index (p = 0.03). This deterioration is recovered significantly in the next months after hospital discharge, being more noticeable this recovery in the first 6 months (p = 0.04), with rates Barthel at 6 months close to baseline (p = 0.176) being less important subsequent recovery (p = 0.357). Conclusions: One-year survival of patients who had prolonged ICU admission is low (31.25 %). It also represents a significant deterioration in functional status, which is recovered significantly in the next 6 months after hospital discharge.Background: Strain imaging by either tissue-Doppler imaging (TDI) velocity converted to strain and strain rate, or by digital 2dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) analysis have been reported to assess abnormal left ventricular (LV) mechanical activation patterns in sepsis. Objective: Comparison between both approaches of LV strain and strain rate in relation to the survival outcome in sepsis. Methods: Thirty two patients (pts) (43.7 \u00b1 13.7ys, 21 males); 13 pts with sepsis (group-1), 19 pts with severe sepsis/septic shock (group-2) and a subset of 10 controls (36.5 \u00b1 8.7ys, 8 males) were included. APACHE II score was assessed on admission. In the first 24 hours, echocardiography-derived LV dimensions and ejection fraction (%EF) were recorded in sinus rhythm. Color-TDI was performed for 16 segments in the three LV apical views to acquire myocardial peak velocities during systole. Doppler flow profiles were reanalyzed using STE to retrieve LV peak global longitudinal systolic strain (GLSS) and strain rate (GLSSR) which were averaged for the whole segments. Results: Compared to controls, %EF of both groups were comparable, but GLSS showed increased values (\u221217.5 \u00b1 2.9 vs. -20.2 \u00b1 1.6, p < 0.05 by STE, and \u221214.9 \u00b1 2.6 vs. -19.7 \u00b1 1.8, p < 0.001 by TDI) and for GLSSR values (\u22121.3 \u00b1 0.2 vs. -1.6 \u00b1 0.1, p < 0.001 by STE, and \u22121.1 \u00b1 0.4 vs. -1.6 \u00b1 0.1, p < 0.001 by TDI). Compared to group-1, %EF of group-2 showed significantly reduced values (63.1 \u00b1 6.2 % vs. 69 \u00b1 3.9 %, p < 0.05), but APACHE II score values were comparable. Compared to group-1, GLSS of group-2 showed increased values (\u221215.4 \u00b1 1.5 vs.-20.2 \u00b1 2.4, p < 0.05 by STE, and \u221212.7 \u00b1 6.8 vs. -18.1 \u00b1 2.4, p < 0.05 by TDI) but for GLSSR, the values were comparable. The total mortality was 31.3 % at 30 days for all pts (n = 10). Compared to the survivors, the non survivors showed lower APACHE II score values (13.1 \u00b1 4.2 vs. 23.5 \u00b1 5.4, p < 0.001), but %EF values were comparable. Good correlation could detected between APACHE II score and both STE GLSS and GLSSR values (r = 0.79, p < 0.001, and r = 0.66, p < 0.001), moderate correlation was found between %EF and STE GLSS and GLSSR values (r = 0.43, p < 0.05 and r = 0.54, p < 0.05), but with TDI the correlation was poor with either APACHE II score or %EF. The area under the curve (AUC) of STE GLSS to predict mortality was 0.9 (95 % CI; 0.32-0.48), with best cutoff value at \u221216.8 (sensitivity 100 %, specificity 86 %), AUC for STE GLSSR was 0.96 (95 % CI; 0.1-0.45), with best cutoff value at \u22121.2 (sensitivity 90 %, specificity 80 %), AUC for TDI GLSS was 0.76 (95 % CI; 0.1-0.44), with best cutoff value at \u221214.9 (sensitivity 100 %, specificity 82 %), and AUC for TDI GLSSR was 0.92 (95 % CI; 0.35-0.49), with best cutoff value at \u22121.2 (sensitivity 100 %, specificity 73 %). Conclusion: LV global longitudinal systolic strain and strain rate by STE showed better correlation with both APACHE II and %EF than TDI. Both approaches showed sensitive prediction of mortality in sepsis, but STE approach was more specific.ADVANCES IN TRAUMA CARE AND CARDIAC ARREST MANAGEMENTA1104 Cardiac arrest in surgical theaters and coronary catheters suites.

SurvivalIntroduction: Peroperative cardiac arrests(PAC) are rarely studied(1- 4).Incidence and outcome are influenced by numerous factors with overall survival ranging from 32 to 55 %.There is a lack of data for PAC occurring in angiographic and cardiac catheterism patients(PA-CANGIO) while they may obviously be at risk.Moreover, anesthetic care is not codified in these settings. Objectives: We performed a retrospective, monocentric study comparing incidence and outcome of PAC occuring in surgical theatres(adult only; cardiac, abdominal and neurosurgery) and PACANGIO. Methods: All IHCA(defined by presence of chest compression and/or EES) were recorded on an internal database through a dedicated follow-up form including demographic data, medical history, location, event time sequence of CPR initial cardiac rhythm(VF, VT, PEA, Asystole), first treatment attempt and immediate survival rate(ISR).-Survivors of CPR were followed-up until hospital discharge and SAPS II score, duration of ICU stay, treatments applied and hospital survival rate(HSR) were recorded.2 groups were defined :PACSURG and PACANGIO and compared by CHI2 and student t tests. % vs 55,2 % p = 0,7) were similar in both groups(Table 86).Presence of pre anesthesia shock was the main cause in the PACSURG group(37.5 %). Anesthesia was directly the cause of 34 % of PACSURG events.62 % of the PACANGIO were due to myocardial ischemia. Conclusions: Incidence and outcome of PACSURG are consistent with previous report.This is the first european study assessing incidence and outcome of PACANGIO.The coronary angiography suite has an incidence of PAC 4 times higher that of the surgical theatre.We believe that full BLS/ACLS education should be ensured in these settings.The PACANGIO group cumulates multiple known favorable outcome factors with no clear benefit on the observed HSR.This suggests the possible presence of specific risk factors in this group. The high incidence of PAC related to the anesthesia procedure could be decreased by implementation of a quality improvement program focused on detection of patients at risk and preventive care.The overall observed HSR suggest that OR and diagnostic intervention areas are no place for DNR orders in case of PAC.A1105 ECLS in refractory cardiac arrest : a retrospective study of factors predicting survival and neurological outcome E.

Moreover, other studies suggested a higher survival rate among in-hospital than out-of-hospital victims of RCA(2). Objectives: We studied factors linked to survival of patients who underwent ECLS during RCA or shortly after recuperation. Methods: This is a monocentric study from January 2006 to December 2014, conducted in universitary hospital in Grenoble, France. 196 patients admitted for ECLS after RCA or shortly after RCA recuperation were retrospectively included. All factors which could impact survival were studied e.g. cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidity, delay before medical intervention, ECLS complications, cause of death, in-versus out-of-hospital RCA, initial pulse, treatment following the AFAR criteria.Our primary outcome was 30 days survival. Secondary outcomes were neurological status at 3 months (using CPC score) and ECLS-induced complications. of-hospital RCA cases filled AFAR criteria with a trend for better survival (14.5 % vs 8.1 %, p = 0.063). 23 patients had a neurological status evaluation after recovery, 5 were lost to follow-up. Among them, 20 (74,2 %) had none or minor sequelae (CPC score 1 or 2), and the remaining 3 suffering heavy neurological damage (CPC score 3). Conclusions: Mortality of patients undergoing ECLS after refractory cardiac arrest remains high, but survivors have good neurological recovery, suggesting criteria to start the procedure must be more selective.Guidelines  for indications for the use of extracorporeal life support in refractory cardiac arrest.

Nevertheless, the use of VA-ECMO for refractory cardiac arrest (ECPR) has shown promising results for inhospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) while its use for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains controversial. Moreover, the intensity of therapy and morbidity associated with such interventions are poorly described. Methods: We reviewed our institutional VA-ECMO database (n = 159) from November 2008 to December 2014 and identified those patients who were treated with ECPR for IHCA or OHCA. We recorded demographics data as well as organ dysfunction and concomitant therapies, complications and neurological outcome at 3 months after arrest. Results: A total of 70 patients (age 53 [41-63] years) were treated over the study period; 46 patients experienced OHCA and in 57 (81 %) patients the cause of arrest was cardiac. 58 patients received a bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation and median time to basic life support (BLS) was 2 [1-7] minutes. Ten (14 %) of these patients could not be percutaneously cannulated and immediately died. Total time from arrest to ECMO onset was 59 [45-70] minutes (n = 60). Median ECMO blood flow on admission was 4.0 [3.5-4.2] L/min, FiO 2 of 1.0 [1.0-1.0] and gas flow of 6 [5-7] L/min. Initial lactate levels were 14.3 [8.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF161": {"text": "abstract A1110).

Howevere, there have been few data to show if pulmonary artery temperature well estimates brain parenchymal temperature.Objectives: We performed this study to investigate whether pulmonary artery temperature well estimates brain parenchymal temperature during TTM in swine cardiac arrest model. Methods: This study was conducted on 4 male domestic pigs (30 \u00b1 5 kg). After 8 minutes of no-flow time that was induced by ventricular fibrillation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation was provided, and the return of spontaneous circulation was achieved. TTM (core temperature, 32 -34\u00b0C) was maintained for 8 hours post-return of spontaneous circulation, and the animals were rewarmed for 12 hours. During TTM, brain parenchymal and pulmonary artery temperatures were measured by Bowman perfusion monitor\u00ae(HemedexTM, Cambridge, MA) and Swan-Ganz catheter(Edwards Lifesci. Corp., Irvine, CA), respectively. Rectal temperature was also measured. Data were compared using repeated measures ANOVA test with Dunnett posthoc test. Results: During TTM, brain parenchymal temperature was higher than pulmonary artery temperature (p = 0.026). The mean difference between the brain parenchymal and pulmonary artery temperature was 0.44 \u00b1 0.10\u00b0C. Rectal temperature was not different from brain parenchymal and pulmonary artery temperatures (p = 0.064 and 0.914, respectively) Conclusions: Pulmonary artery temperature did not well estimate brain parenchymal temperature during TTM.A1114 A case series of veno-arterial-venous (VAV) ECMO A.

Xini -Erasme Hospital, Brussels, Belgium Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):A1114Introduction: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is increasingly used to treat cardio-pulmonary failure in critically ill patients. Peripheral cannulation may be complicated by a persistent low cardiac output in case of veno-venous cannulation (VV-ECMO) or by differential hypoxia (e.g. lower PaO2 in the upper than in the lower body) in case of veno-arterial cannulation (VA-ECMO) and severe impairment of pulmonary function associated with cardiac recovery. The treatment of such complications remains challenging. We reported our experience with the use of veno-arterial-venous (VAV) ECMO in this setting. Methods and results: We reviewed our institutional ECMO database (n = 285) from November 2008 to December 2015 andidentified those patients that needed a conversion from the initial VV-or VA-ECMO to a VAV technique. We collected demographic data as well as comorbidities and ECMO characteristics, hemodynamics and arterial blood gas values before and after the VAV implementation. We treated 9 patients (age 53 [ranges:Fig. 124 (abstract A1113).Introduction: Inclusion of Advanced Life Support (ALS) algorithms during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is considered a benchmark of a country\u00b4s health system. In Europe, proactive decisions are increasingly made as to whether resuscitation should be attempted in the event of a cardiac arrest. A national cardiac arrest audit undertaken in Sri Lanka in 2015 reported a high ratio of resuscitation attempts to deaths and poor outcomes following those attempts[1]. Objectives: To explore the characteristics of in hospital CPR practices, the use of Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) orders and the perspectives of junior doctors involved in those attempts. Methods: A cross-sectional telephone survey aimed at all consultant led medical and surgical wards in secondary and tertiary hospitals in Sri Lanka. Junior doctor interviews explored the practices and outcomes following CPR attempts, their perceptions regarding occurrence of cardiac arrest and probability of successful return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) along with the use of DNAR orders. Results: 82 (338 wards) of the 90 hospitals included were successfully contacted. The remaining 8 hospitals were not reachable despite multiple attempts. 42 CPR attempts were reported. 16 (4.7 %) wards had at least one patient with an informal DNAR order. 3 CPR attempts were excluded as the doctor interviewed did not participate in the attempt. 42 deaths were reported. 8 deaths occurred without a known resuscitation attempt. Of these 6 deaths occurred on wards with an informal DNAR order in place.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF162": {"text": "Delayed onset of CPR does not lead to severe HF visible in ROTEM.

Cook -Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Critical Care, Toronto, Canada Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):A1118 Introduction: Compared to individual-patient randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the design, conduct, and analysis of cluster (c)RCTs involve unique methodological and ethical considerations. The CON-SORT cRCT recommendations, published in 2004 (updated 2012), provide a benchmark to assess this.(1) Objectives: We sought to evaluate the rationale, methodological quality, and reporting of cRCTs in critical care medicine (CCM). Methods: We systematically identified all cRCTs, of any intervention, in intensive care units using Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2005-present). Two reviewers independently screened citations, reviewed full texts, protocols, and supplements of potentially eligible studies for inclusion, abstracted data, and assessed methodology. Results: From 1072 unique citations, 28 (3 %) cRCTs met selection criteria (Fig 130). Most focused on quality improvement (37 %), antimicrobial (22 %), or infection control (26 %) interventions. Designs included parallel arm (48 %), crossover (44 %), and stepped-wedge (7 %). The median number of clusters was 14 (IQR 7.5-28.5); median total sample size 2449 (IQR 1098-6805); median patients per cluster 356 (IQR 90-706). Most (70 %) cRCTs obtained waivers of consent. 96 % of studies reported sample size calculations. These were adequately described in 22 (79 %). Of 24/28 studies using individual patients as the unit of analysis, 13 (54 %) reported an estimate of intracluster coefficient [ICC; median 0.025 (IQR 0.01-0.071)].In 4/28 (14 %) studies the number of clusters and patients required to achieve a pre-specified effect size was identified; 4/4 (100 %) achieved these numbers. In 14/28 (50 %) a fixed number of clusters were identified at trial commencement and the number of patients required to achieve a pre-specified effect size was then identified; 8/14 (57 %) achieved these numbers. In 3/28 (11 %) a fixed number of clusters and an anticipated number of patients were identified at trial commencement and a range or point estimate of detectable effect sizes were identified; 2/3 (66 %) achieved these numbers. When analyzing data, few (2/28, 7 %) studies failed to consider the effects of clustering; 4/28 (14 %) used the cluster as the unit of analysis. Blinding was reported in 14/28 (50 %) studies. Physicians and data analysts were blinded in 8 %, no studies reported blinding of patients. 14/28 (50 %) cRCTs reported adequate concealment of randomization. Only 2/28 (7 %) of studies reported loss of a whole cluster after randomization, but 9/28 (32 %) reported a loss of participants. 39 % reported potential Hawthorne effects. Conclusion: Cluster RCTs in CCM typically involve a small and fixed number of relatively large clusters, and are frequently underpowered relative to initial sample size estimates. The reporting of key methodological aspects of these trials is often inadequate.A1120 A nationwide census of icu beds and admissions in Mongolia N. Mendsaikhan 1 , T. Begzjav 1 , G. Lundeg 2 , M.W.

Mendsaikhan -Intermed Hospital, Intensive Care Department, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):A1120 Introduction: Despite of a high burden of critical illness in middleand low-income countries, management of critically ill patients faces serious challenges in these regions of the world (1). Little is known about national intensive care capacities and the burden of critical illness in low-and middle-income countries. Objectives: To determine the intensive care unit (ICU) capacity and number of ICU admissions for adults and children in 2014. Methods: A census of all hospitals with an ICU in the Mongolian capital city and 21 provinces was performed. Data on adult and pediatric ICU capacity and the number of ICU admissions in 2014 were collected.Results: In total, 70 ICUs with 349 ICU beds were counted (11.7 ICU beds/100,000 inhabitants; 1.7 ICU beds/100 hospital beds). Of these, 241 (69 %) were adult (8.1 adult ICU beds/100,000 inhabitants) and 108 (31 %) pediatric ICU beds (3.6 pediatric ICU beds/100,000 inhabitants). Mechanical ventilators were available for approximately half of the ICU beds (5.1 mechanical ventilators/100,000 inhabitants; 3.6 adult mechanical ventilators/100,000 inhabitants; 1.5 pediatric mechanical ventilators/100,000 inhabitants). While all provincial hospitals ran a pediatric/neonatal ICU, only dedicated pediatric hospitals in the capital city did so. In 2004, we recorded 17,749 ICU admissions (10,676 adult ICU admission; 357 adult ICU admissions/100,000Fig. 130 (abstract A1118). Consort Diagram Fig. 131 (abstract A1118). cRCTs in CCM Per Year inhabitants; 1.43 % of all adult hospital admissions; 7,073 pediatric ICU admissions; 237 pediatric ICU admissions/100,000 inhabitants; 0.95 % of all pediatric hospital admissions). The number of adult and pediatric/neonatal ICU admissions varied between provinces. The number of adult ICU beds and adult ICU admissions per 100,000 inhabitants were correlated (Spearman correlation coefficient, 0.5; p = 0.02), while the number of pediatric/neonatal ICU beds and pediatric/neonatal ICU admissions per 100,000 inhabitants were not (Spearman correlation coefficient, 0.25; p = 0.26).Conclusions: With 11.7 ICU beds per 100,000 inhabitants the ICU bed capacity in Mongolia compares favorably with other low-and middle-income countries. Substantial heterogeneities in the standardized ICU bed capacity and ICU admissions exist between Mongolian provinces. Availability of mechanical ventilators for only half of the ICU beds indicates important resource restrictions in Mongolian ICUs. Pediatric/neonatal ICU beds make up one third of the national ICU capacity and appear to meet or even exceed the demand of pediatric/neonatal critical care in Mongolia.A1121 Perception and knowledge of intensive care unit (ICU) staff about self -protection and evacuation plans D.

This new formula combine 2 parameters, DTF*RSBI, as a good parameter for extubation.Methods: We used the administrative claims data of all Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) hospitals in Japan from April 1, 2011 to March 31, 2012, and retrospectively reviewed the number and outcome at discharge of patients who were on ECMO support. Results: We identified 3,336 patients who received ECMO support during the 1-year study period. The average age was 58.7, and only 6.7 % of the patients were under 20 years old. The most common diagnosis was acute coronary syndrome, followed by cardiac arrest and pulmonary embolism. The overall survival rate at discharge was 39.6 % [95%CI 38.0-42.3]. Among the 1,449 acute care DPC hospitals, ECMO support was provided in 394 hospitals (27.2 %), and therefore the annual ECMO patient volume per hospital was 8.5, which is much lower than international standards for ECMO centers. Adjusted odds ratio for discharge alive stratified by annual ECMO volume per hospital were 1.10 [95%CI 0.78-1.54] and 1.23 [95%CI 0.90-1.28] for medium (131 hospitals treating 4 to 9 patients) and high volume centers (122 hospitals treating 10 or more patients), respectively, compared with low volume centers (141 hospitals treating 3 or less patients). Conclusions: ECMO support was administered to many adult cardiac patients, and provided in a substantial proportion of acute care hospitals in Japan.

Basal fracture risk before CI was calculated using the FRAX tool (https://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX). In January 2016, referent family doctors were contacted by phone to check out new BF occurred during the 2 years after ICU discharge. Data are expressed as median (min-max) or percentages. Unpaired data were compared using Mann-Whitney test (p < 0.05 = significant). Results: From the 1446 patients admitted in 2013, 884 had an ICU LOS \u2264 7d, 3 were < 18y, 278 died in ICU or died after an ICU LOS \u2264 7d and 31 were lost to follow-up. We analyzed 178 patients who were alive in January 2016 and 72 patients who died outside ICU during the FUP after an ICU LOS >7d. Regarding alive patients (64 % males), admission was mainly related to cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological failure, or trauma. Age was 64 (18-91)y, simplified acute physiologic score (SAPS II) was 44.5 (6-85), ICU LOS was 15 (8-106)d. According to the FRAX tool, the 10-y probability of major osteoporotic BF (major FRAX risk) was 5.4 (1-32)%. Nine patients (4 men) developed BF in 7.5 (1-28) months after CI, equivalent to a 5 % risk of new BF 2y after CI. A context of fall at home was noted in every case. Age, ICU LOS and SAPS II of these patients were not statistically different from non-fractured patients. Their major FRAX risk was 16 (3-29)%, significantly higher than non-fractured patients (p = 0.0029). Finally, among the 72 dead patients, only one 62y man experienced hip fracture at the 17 th month after CI. Conclusions: Present incidence of new BF in the 2y following severe CI with a prolonged ICU stay is similar to previously published data [3]. Patients who experienced new BF after CI had a higher FRAX risk than the non-fractured patients. Influence of CI or ICU stay on BF risk is thus questioned. However, to be relevant, our results need to be compared to a control population: this work is ongoing. Conclusions: We detected a rise in Pro-Adrenomedullin levels after cardiac surgery. The results suggest that AM could be useful for LCOS prediction. More data are necessary to confirm the role in the prediction of relevant outcomes. Conclusions: The ICU stay and early complications evaluated not differ between the two groups , except for acute renal failure and higher mortality, despite the use of shorter times in cardiac surgical in octogenarians. There is a progressive decrease in coronary artery bypass surgery in recent years in this group probably in favor of percutaneous techniques.High-risk patients who require intensive perioperative management,should be identified to reduce the incidence of postoperative complications.Conclusions: Previous renal replacement treatment and the colonized patients' long stay at ICU increase the transformation of the VRE colonization into VRE infection.

Due to this high rate, it was necessary to review all related process through institutionalized and supervised practice, minimizing the risks of hemodialysis procedure and maintenance of the catheter, in order to directly reduce the length of hospital stay, morbidity and hospital costs. Objectives: Objective of this study was to evaluate the application of strategies according to IHI to reduce infection of the bloodstream related to CVC hemodialysis. Methods: The study was conducted in a 20-bed, medical-surgical ICU. Criteria for infection catheter related bloodtream infection are those from the CDC. Strategy was to implement the Permanent education of employees, highlighting the importance of prevention of infections;Training of new employees as the hemodialysis routine and safe and aseptic techniques; Optimize other measures that can reduce the risks, such as early removal of invasive devices.Raise awareness of nursing staff about the importance of their role in the prevention of infection, such as maintenance of the catheter with use of aseptic techniques; Disseminate monthly for teams infection rates; Make benchmarking with other services; The goals were the ICU team adhesion of 46 % achieved in six month after bundle implementation and 100 % after one year of follow up.

C Objective: To investigate the change in mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in the brain tissue after therapeutic hypothermia in swine cardiac arrest model. Design. Prospective animal study Setting. University animal laboratory Subjects. Male domestic pigs (n = 24) Interventions: After the return of spontaneous circulation by cardiopulmonary resuscitation following 6 min of no flow time induced by ventricular fibrillation, pigs were randomly assigned to one of four groups (sham, normothermia, 24 hr of therapeutic hypothermia, 48 hr of therapeutic hypothermia). Therapeutic hypothermia (core temperature 32-34\u00b0C) was maintained and the pigs were then rewarmed for 8 hr. At 60 hr after the return of spontaneous circulation, the pigs were sacrificed and brain tissues were harvested. Measurement and main results: We measured the tissue levels of p38, JNK, and ERK pathway expressions in swine brain hippocampus of the four groups. The phosphorylated p38 to p38 ratio and phosphorylated JNK to JNK ratios were significantly increased in all of the intervention groups, relative to the sham group. but the phosphorylated ERK to ERK ratio was increased only in the therapeutic hypothermia groups (p-value = 0.026 in the 24 hr of therapeutic hypothermia group and p-value = 0.002 in the 48 hr of therapeutic hypothermia group, both compared to the sham group). Conclusions: Normothermia activated the p38 and JNK pathway. And did not activate the ERK pathway in ischemia-reperfusion injury after cardiac arrest. Therapeutic hypothermia, however, did not attenuate the activation of the p38 and JNK pathways, but activated the ERK pathway, which seemed to be dose dependent with the duration of therapeutic hypothermia.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3554, "end": 3555, "text": "C", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A1087"}, {"text": "Effect of permissive hypercapnia on outcome of cardiac arrest in a porcine model of cardiopulmonary resuscitation G.

Objectives:(1) Determination of the frequency of oligoanalgesia in trauma patients at our prehospital emergency service location in Objectives: Assessment of characteristics and outcomes of patients who suffer cardiopulmonary arrest resuscitated in a tertiary hospital, inside and outside Intensive Care Unit, according to Utstein style.Methods: A prospective cohort study was performed according to Utstein style. Every arrest occurred in the hospital \"Virgen de las Nieves\" (Granada, Spain) for a period of 3 years (July/09-June/12) were included. All arrest occurred in all areas of the hospital were included, except those in operating rooms and anesthesia recovery room (not attended by the resuscitation team) and those commenced in the prehospital setting. We also excluded patients in whom no resuscitation attempt was made or those suspended either by existence of a living will, by orders DNR or considered futile. The variables were grouped according to the location (inside or outside the ICU). Chi 2 test was performed when the dependent variable was qualitative and a t-Student test when it was quantitative.Results: During this period a total of 297 patients suffered at least one episode of arrest and they were resuscitated. Most frequent sex was male (61.3 %) with a median age 69 years (65.2 \u00b1 14.2 years; interquartile 57-76 years). The cardiac origin was the most common aetiology (40.4 %). The ICU was the area most frequent location (43.8 %). When comparing the characteristics of ICU arrests with the rest of the hospital, significant differences were observed. It was most likely to have a shockable initial rhythm (\u03c72: 10.6; p = 0.004), younger age (62,1 \u00b1 14,9 vs 67,5 \u00b1 13,2 years; t = 3,3; p = 0,001), shorter interval to defibrillation (2,1 \u00b1 2,3 vs 4,7 \u00b1 2,4 min; t = 3,6; p = 0,001), shorter period until start of resuscitation (1,3 \u00b1 2,3 vs 4,9 \u00b1 4,3 min; t = 8,9; p < 0,001) and shorter total duration (15 \u00b1 15,2 vs 24,7 \u00b1 19,5 min; t = 4,4; p < 0,001). However, no differences were found in coronary aetiology, sex, recovery of spontaneous circulation and hospital survival (22.1 % vs 23.8 % in ICU).Conclusions: Despite higher frequency in initial shockable rhythms and lower intervals until defibrillation and resuscitation in the ICU, no differences were found in initial recovery or hospital survival.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 131, "end": 139, "text": "Ristagno", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 664, "end": 676, "text": "(Figure 122)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1080, "end": 1081, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 140, "end": 150, "text": "Figure 122", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 324, "end": 333, "text": "(Table 88", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 736, "end": 746, "text": "Figure 122", "ref_id": null}], "section": "A1109"}, {"text": "Delayed onset of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) does not induce hyperfibrinolysis in a piglet model of ventricular fibrillation -a pilot study in G\u00f6ttingen Minipigs N.

Excessive proliferation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) is regarded as the major cause of the remodeling of pulmonary artery, whereas the underlying mechanism is largely unclear. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is the main component of propolis, which is known as a versatile compound of antimitogenic, anticarcinogenic and anti-inflammatory potentials.

Methods: Animal model of PAH symptom was induced in 200-250 grams Sprague-Dawley rats by subcutaneous injection of monocrotaline (MCT, 60 mg/kg). 2 weeks later, the MCT-induced PAH rats received intraperitoneal administration of CAPE with various dosages of 5 or 10 mg/kg once per day, for further 2 weeks. Hemodynamic functions, including RV systolic pressure (RVSP) and Fulton index, were measured before sacrifice. The lung tissues were harvested for examining the vascular remodeling of pulmonary artery. To investigate the molecular mechanisms, in vitro cultured human PASMCs challenged with either 3 % oxygen level or recombinant human PDGF (40 ng/mL), followed by the treatment of CAPE in 5 or 10 mM. The change of expression level and phosphorylation of the cellular signaling molecules, including ERK, AKT, NF-kB, or Hif-1a, were analyzed by semi-quantitative PCR and western blotting, respectively. Results: In MCT-induced PAH rats, CAPE significantly improved the hemodynamic values of RVSP, Fulton index, and attenuated the severity of pulmonary vascular remodeling. Furthermore, the administration of CAPE critically reduced the expression levels of Hif-1a, NF-kB and PDGF molecules in the lung of MCT-induced PAH rats. In vitro assay showed that an increased expression level of hif-1\u03b1 and pdgf genes in hPASMCs was observed under hypoxia or PDGF stimulation, which was significantly suppressed following CAPE treatment. For chemical inhibition, we indicated that cellular signaling molecules ERK, AKT and NF-kB were involved in the up-regulation of hif-1a and pdgf genes, which were responsible for the proliferation of hPASMCs exposed to hypoxia or PDGF stimulation. In addition, CAPE also significantly promoted the number of apoptotic cells and the number of cell arrested in G0 phase of hPASMCs by TUNEL assay and SA-b-galactosidase staining, respectively. Conclusions: We showed evidence that the natural compound CAPE could provide therapeutic benefits on the reversal of experimental PAH rats. Importantly, the results further indicated that the hif-1a-mediated pdgf expression is a positive feedback mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of PAH, which was regulated by the AKT/ERK/NF-kB signaling.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A1117"}, {"text": "Right ventricular arterial coupling after cardiac surgery: a preliminary report P. Introduction: Right ventriculo-arterial coupling (rVAC), defined as the ratio of end-systolic elastance (rEes) to pulmonary arterial elastance (rEA) is considered a sensitive method to assess right heart performance [1] . Objectives: In this study we aim to identify the feasibility of measuring rVAC in hemodynamic deranged patients undergoing complex/ emergency cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) as an experimental model of further hemodynamic impairment. Objectives: This study aims to determine the frequency of the VRE colonization and the transformation into infection and the risk factors, which lead to infection. Methods: The patients who were hospitalized for at least 24 hours in tertiary mixed type ICU between 2012 and 2015 and had VRE colonization and VRE infection during or following their hospitalization were included in the study and their medical records were examined retrospectively. VRE rectal swab sample was taken from each patient at his arrival and once a week afterwards. When negativity was detected in the rectal swab sample, which had been taken total 3 times successively from those with positive VRE; that patient was considered VRE negative. Their demographic data, APA-CHE II scores, invasive procedures, treatments (corticosteroid, antibiotics, etc.), nutrition types, laboratory results and ICU outcome were recorded. Results: VRE colonization was detected in 110 of 1730 patients (6.4 %) admitted to ICU. VRE infection developed in 12 of 110 VRE-colonized patients (10.9 %). Among these infected patients; it was (n = 5) 41.7 % primary bloodstream infection, (n = 6) %50 urinary tract infection, (n = 1) % 8.3 pneumonia. In VRE colonized patients (64.3 %) and infected patients (91 %), the most frequent factor was E. faecium. In 67 % of the VRE-colonized patients, VRE became negative in their stay at ICU. Previous renal replacement treatment was significantly higher in statistical terms in the VREinfected group (66.7 %) when compared to VRE-colonized group (26.1 %) (p < 0.05). In the VRE-infected group, colonization with VRE lasted longer than 1 week in 10 patients (83.3 %) were determined. Demographic data, APACHE II scores, treatments, nutrition types, previous antibiotic usage and types, invasive procedures, laboratory results and ICU outcome were similar between the VRE-colonized and infected patients.Objective: To assess the value of enteral paramomycin to decontaminate patients with rectal colistin and/or carbepemenase resistant microorganisms colonization to prevent the development of ICU nosocomial infections Methods: All consecutive patients admitted to the ICU from October 2011 to September 2015, expected to require tracheal intubation for longer than 48 hours, were given SDD with a 4-day course of intravenous cefotaxime, plus enteral colistin, tobramycin, nystatin in an oropharyngeal paste and in a digestive solution. Oropharyngeal and rectal swabs were obtained on admission and once weekly. Rectal swabs colonized by colistin and/or carbepemenase resistant microorganisms were treated with enteral paramomycin 1 gram every 6 hours a day, in order to eradicate them and prevent nosocomial infections. Categorical variables were summarized as frequencies and percentages and the continuous ones as medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) or means and standard desviations. Statistical significance was set at p \u2264 0.05. Results: We applied paromomycin treatment to 58 colonized patients with rectal colistin resistant microorganisms. All of them had colonization by Extended Spectrum Beta-lactamases (ESBLs). Also, all of them but two were Klebsiella pneumonia. Out of these two, one patient was colonized by Enterobacter spp and other one by Escherichia coli. Demographic data and type of admission are shown in Fig. 142 . Forty out of 58 (68,9 %) of the studied patients the rectal swab became negative. Five out of the 58 patients were colonized by carbapenemases producing microorganisms and one of these died with persistent multirresistant rectal colonization. Only 16 out of the 40 patients that negativized the colonization received concurrent susceptible IV antibiotics. Only 1 of the paromonycin treated patients developed a mediastinitis infection due to one of the treated microorganisms. Finally, 21 patients died in the ICU. Conclusion: Our data show that enteral paramomycin is effective in treating rectal colistin and/or carbepemenase resistant microorganisms colonization allowing clinicians preventing the development of ICU nosocomial infections. Introduction: Diaphragmatic thickness increases as lung volume increases towards TLC. It has been shown that in healthy subjects, diaphragmatic thickness, increases as lung volume increases, above 0.5 of the vital capacity (VC). In mechanically ventilated patients, different levels of PEEP are used to improve oxygenation. There is no information about the diaphragmatic thickness when in ICU patients, lung volume increases with PEEP towards TLC. Methods: In patients with Acute Respiratory failure (ARF) and lower lobe atelectasis detected by Lung ECHO, two levels of PEEP (8 and 15 \u00b1 cmH2O) are used to increase lung volume and to improve oxygenation. End Expiratory Lung volume (EELV), and diaphragmatic thickness was measured at baseline (ZEEP) and at the two levels of PEEP. EELV was measured with a Nitrogen indirect dilution method and diaphragmatic thickness at the zone of apposition with echography using a 12 MHz linear probe. Statistical analysis was performed by one way ANOVA and normal distribution by Colmogorof-Smyrnof test. Results: 22 patients (17 M and 7 F) with a mean age of 58 \u00b1 18 were studied. Diaphragmatic thickness at baseline was 0,21 cm and EELV at 1276 ml (43 %) of the predicted (2942 ml). At the intermediate and high level of PEEP diaphragmatic thickness did not change significantly (0.22 and 0.23 cm, respectively, p = 0.38) and EELV increased at 55 % (1621 ml) and 68 % (1995 ml) of the predicted. The increase in lung volume induced by PEEP was at 32 % and 40 % of the predicted VC (5049 ml). Mean PaO2/FiO2 ratio did not change significantly Conclusions: Mechanically ventilated patients for ARF have a severe reduction in their EELV or FRC. The use of PEEP reestablishes partially the EELV, but not to his normal levels(predicted FRC). Despite high levels of PEEP, diaphragmatic thickness remained constant because the increase in EELV never attained the 50 % the vital capacity.Introduction: The majority of patients entering the weaning process from mechanical ventilation (MV) in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) will have a short and simple weaning (SW) successfully terminated within 24 hours, while other may take up to one week (difficult weaning) or longer. Studies have shown that using a sedation or a weaning protocol could reduce the length of mechanical ventilation and the weaning duration. Objectives: To describe factors associated with SW and particularly assess if sedation and weaning protocol are associated with the proportion of patients having a SW. Methods: We used the data from the WIND (Weaning accordIng New Definition) study, a prospective multicenter observational study performed in France (29 ICUs), Spain (6 ICUS) and Switzerland (1 ICU) from April to August 2013. Ventilation and weaning modalities were daily assessed until discharge in all intubated patients admitted to the participating ICUs. We defined 1) weaning attempt (WA) as a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) or an extubation attempt (with or without SBT), 2) successful weaning as an extubation without death or invasive mechanical ventilation within 7 days. We considered patients as having a SW if weaning was successfully terminated within 24 h following their first WA. Having a protocol for sedation or for weaning (or both) was asked to each center. Quantitative and qualitative variables are presented as mean (standard deviation), median [interquartile range] or number (percentage) as appropriate. Comparisons of proportions were made using Chi2 or exact Fisher tests and continuous variables were compared using Student t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test as appropriate. We performed a multivariable analysis of factors associated with SW by means of a logistic regression, forcing both sedation and weaning protocols in the final model. All statistical tests were two-sided and P values of 0.05 or less were considered significant. Results: Among the 2729 patients included, 2051 patients entered the weaning process and we only kept in the present analysis the 1812 patients who did not have any decision of withholding or withdrawing mechanical ventilation. Among these 1812 patients, 1413 (78 %) had a SW and 399 (22 %) had a weaning duration longer than 24 hours. Main clinical characteristics are shown in Table 95 . Conclusions: In this study of 1812 patients with a daily assessment of the weaning process, hospitalization in an ICU using a sedation protocol or a weaning protocol (as declared by the center) was not associated with a higher proportion of patients having a simple and short weaning. Admission for planned surgery, younger age, lower SOFA score at admission and shorter duration of ventilation before any weaning attempt were associated with a higher proportion of simple and short weaning.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 299, "end": 302, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3883, "end": 3891, "text": "Fig. 142", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 8893, "end": 8901, "text": "Table 95", "ref_id": null}], "section": "A1144"}, {"text": "This study benefited of a grant of the non-profit Association D\u00e9partementale des Insuffisants Respiratoires (ADIR) of the Haute Normandie, France. Introduction: During weaning from prolonged ventilation overload of diaphragm as main breathing muscle should be avoided. Clinical criteria are used for determining the end of the spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) in the context of a discontinuously concept for weaning. In addition the patients subjective feeling of breathing exhaustion plays an important role. In incommunicable patients lacks this possibility for feedback.Continuous monitoring of diaphragm electrical activity could give information of respiratory muscle effort during SBT. Objectives: In tracheotomized patients undergoing prolonged weaning the relationship between the protocol-based definition of the end of a SBT and the course of the electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) should be examined. Methods: Prospective observation study conducted in a 30 beds intensive care unit in an early rehabilitation clinic. 29 patients that were not communicable because of stroke (17), cerebral hypoxaemia (5), traumatic brain injury (7) have been included. Using an EAdi-catheter usually applied in NAVA (neurally adjusted ventilatory assist)-Ventilation, peak of diaphragm electrical activity (Eadi peak) was continuously recorded 30 minutes before disconnection from ventilator up to 30 minutes after reconnection. The weaning protocol contained two possibilities for terminating of the SBT: reaching clinical signs of ventilation exhausting or reaching a previously fixed time limit. Results: Median duration of mechanical ventilation at study start was 22 days and 37 days at successful weaning (28/29 patients, 1 died). 152 SBT have been recorded, 91 terminated because of exhaustion, 61 by time limit. Median duration over all was 244 minutes (exhaustion: 232/ time limit: 315). With multiple regression analysis, the relationship between the duration of the SBT and the EAdi peak was examined. Looking at all SBT, which were terminated due to exhaustion, shows that the duration of the SBT has a highly significant impact on EAdi ( p < 0.0001). The mean increase of Eadi peak was 10.899 \u03bcV (absolute) and 1.446 (relatively). In SBT terminated because the time limit has been reached, there was no significant correlation between the time and course of Eadi peak. Conclusions: Continuous recording of the electrical diaphragmatic activity during weaning of prolonged ventilation in incommunicable patients can be used as supplementary parameter in monitoring the respiratory function. Introduction: Patient-ventilator asynchronies are associated with poor outcome. It was suggested that bedside analysis of ventilator waveforms may help detecting different types of asynchrony and setting properly the ventilator [1] . Objectives: To test accuracy of a \"waveform\" method, based on specific signs on airway pressure (Paw) and flow curves, in detecting spontaneous respiratory activity and asynchronies in patients under Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV).Methods: 16 recordings (12 min each) of esophageal pressure (Pes), Paw and flow were obtained in obstructive (75 %) and restrictive (25 %) patients under PSV with clinical evidence of poor patient-ventilator interaction. Tracings of 4426 breaths were visually analyzed for detection of spontaneous respiratory activity both with Pes (reference method) and without Pes (waveform method) by different operators. Breaths were defined as assisted, unassisted or autotriggered, and assisted breaths as delayed triggered, early cycled or delayed cycled. The waveforms method was applied in a selection of tracings (20 min, 544 breaths) by 4 different operators for assessment of inter-rater agreement. Results: The reference method detected 6 autotriggered (0.1 %), 976 unassisted (22.1 %) and 3444 assisted (77.8 %) breaths; among assisted breaths, 897 delayed triggered (26.0 %), 1231 delayed cycled (35.7 %) and 439 early cycled (12.7 %). Table 102 shows sensitivities and specificities (95 % CI) of the waveform method in evaluating patient-ventilator interaction. The waveform method detected the start of patient's inspiration and expiration with a bias of \u221223 and \u221232 ms and a precision (\u00b11.98 SD) of 184 and 202 ms respectively. Absolute agreement among operators was almost perfect for unassisted breaths, strong for delayed triggered, delayed cycled and early cycled breaths, and weak for autotriggered breaths. Conclusions: The waveforms method is a reliable, accurate and reproducible method to assess patient-ventilator interaction and could help optimal setting of the ventilator. Automation of this method may allow continuous monitoring of ventilated patients and/or improved breath triggering and cycling.Methods: We studied a group de mechanically patients during the weaning time, at Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV) with different levels of assistance (High 15-23 cmH2O, medium 10-14 cmH2O, low 5-9 cmH2O). Esophageal, gastric, airway pressure, and airway flow were registered, samplig 278Hz. We determined the phase difference (\u03a6) relationships between the neuronal times obtained from derivative flow versus esophageal or gastric signal respect to machine cycle, by calculating the phase delay, dividing by the cycle time of ventilator*360\u00b0. Times (T) definitions: T0 = onset inspiratory effort, T1/2 = effort maximum. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistical methods and are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD, medians, interquartile range (IRQ, 25-75 % quartile), and coefficient of variation (CV). The comparisons were performed by Mann-Whitney Test. The relationships between measurement methods was examined using single linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis. Results: 10 patients were studied. For all data angle phase \u03a6 median (IRQ): T0: 1,29 (\u22125,06 to ,05), T1/2: \u22121,61 (\u22127,07 to 4,98). The mean comparison of T0 and T1/2 between Pes and DF did not showed statistical differences for any level of support, and correlation R 2 > 0,99. The CV for all data at the T0 of Pes and DF: 11 % and 1 %, respectively; and for the T1/2 of Pes and DF: 50 % and 14 %, respectively; without differences between levels of assistance. Table 103 below show results from Bland-Altman analysis. Figure 144 show representative tracing of DF with well-defined inflection points (arrows) at T0 and T1/2, as the onset inspiratory flow and transition from inspiratory to expiratory flow. Conclusions: The derivative of flow signal is useful to measure with accuracy neuronal and cycling times, it\u00b4s more homogeneous and precise than obtained for esophaeal or gastric pressure for all levels of assistance. The derivative of flow signal is a non-invasive signal which can be calculated easily and useful by conventional ventilator. Introduction: Sepsis has been defined as organ dysfunction as a result of the inappropriate host response to infection. [1] Renal function is often injured at the early stage of sepsis. [2] Autoregulation, which plays an important role in maintaining an adequate renal blood flow against changes in blood pressure, could be impaired during sepsis, [3] thus resulting in AKI if blood pressure fluctuates greatly. Objectives: To investigate if there is any relationship between blood pressure variability (BPV) and AKI in septic patients. Methods: Clinical data of patients admitted to our 50 bed medical ICU between 05/2014 and 03/2015 were reviewed. Continuous records of blood pressure were analysed. Blood pressure variability was calculated as the coefficient of variation (CV) of mean arterial pressure in the first 24 h of admission. AKI was defined by the KDIGO definition according to creatinine change and urine output criteria. [4] Results: 275 adult patients with sepsis (age: 59.9 \u00b1 17.3 years old; APACHE II score: 23.6 \u00b1 7.1; male: 63.3 %) who stayed at ICU for more than three days were identified. AKI was presented in 70 (25.5 %) of them (stage 1: n = 33; stage 2: n = 15; stage 3: n = 22). The BPV was 12.0 \u00b1 3.7 % for the patients with AKI versus 9.8 \u00b1 3.2 % for the others (P < 0.001). ICU mortality was 41.4 % for the AKI group compared to difference was not statistically significant regarding creatinine level on admission (p = 0.317). Moreover, there was a positive correlation between uAnCR ratio on admission with AKIN staging and creatinine level of the all studied patient in the follow up days. The cutoff value of uAnCR on admission to predict later occurrence of AKI during ICU stay was 52.24 ng/mg: at this level, (88.57 % sensitivity and 53.30 % specificity). Conclusions: Urinary angiotensinogen is a new promising biomarker in early prediction of AKI in patients with severe sepsis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2836, "end": 2839, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6928, "end": 6931, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6994, "end": 6997, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7156, "end": 7159, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7745, "end": 7748, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 4013, "end": 4022, "text": "Table 102", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6220, "end": 6229, "text": "Table 103", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6277, "end": 6287, "text": "Figure 144", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Grant acknolwedgment"}, {"text": "Acute kidney injury in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock: a comparison between the \"risk, injury, failure, loss of kidney function, end-stage kidney disease\" (RIFLE), acute kidney injury network (AKIN) and kidney disease improving global outcomes AN69ST and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) membranes have strong adsorption capacity. Cytokines play important roles as the main mediators affecting critically ill patients. However, differences in the cytokine elimination by specific membranes during CHF have not yet been fully investigated. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the elimination of cytokines by AN69ST and PMMA membrane filters during CHF in a pig sepsis model. Methods: Piglets (n = 7) weighing 20-30 kg were anesthetized and administered 30 \u03bcg/kg endotoxin. The Baxter sepXiris (AN69ST membrane) and the Toray Hemofeel 1.8 W (PMMA membrane) were used as hemofilters. Samples were taken at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after endotoxin administration, and the inlet plasma, outlet plasma, and filtrate concentrations of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8 were measured. Clearance values were calculated for each cytokine. Results: Endotoxin administration induced increases in the inlet plasma concentrations of all cytokines measured. The AN69ST membrane filter showed higher adsorption and clearance of IL-8 than the PMMA membrane filter at 6 hours after endotoxin administration (AN69ST: 23.66 \u00b1 17.01 mL/min; PMMA: \u22126.62 \u00b1 48.89 mL/min; P < 0.05). However, the PMMA membrane filter showed higher adsorption and clearance of IL-1\u03b2 than the AN69ST membrane filter. IL-6 did not appear in the filtrate of the PMMA membrane filter, while IL-8 was not eliminated in the filtrate of the AN69ST membrane filter. In addition, the filtrate concentration of TNF-\u03b1 increased after its plasma concentration decreased with the PMMA membrane filter. Conclusions: Shiga et al. 1 previously reported the efficacy of cytokine absorption by AN69ST membrane filters during continuous hemodiafiltration, and Matsuda et al. 2 reported the efficacy of cytokine absorption by PMMA membranes. However, the cytokine absorption efficacy by these two membrane filters had not been directly compared. The results shown here confirm that there are differences in cytokine adsorption by the AN69ST and PMMA membrane filters. Introduction: Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in intensive care is a cornerstone in the supportive treatment arsenal. Its influence on thermodilution cardiac output measurements, and the possible influence of central venous dialysis catheter(CVDC) position, has been studied but the results are of uncertain clinical impact (1) (2) (3) . There have been case reports describing the possibility of direct aspiration into a CVDC of drugs given in adherent central venous catheter(CVC) (4, 5) . Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate if different positions of central lines influence infused noradrenaline during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in an experimental animal model. Methods: Ten anesthetized piglets received a CVC in the right jugular vein and two CVDCs (one via the same jugular vein as the CVDC and the other through a femoral vein). After randomization the CRRT was started in either one of the CVDCs and a nitroprusside infusion was started in an auricular vein. The dose was titrated until the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was 50 mmHg and then kept constant during the rest of the experiment. After reaching the intended blood pressure an infusion of noradrenaline was started and titrated with the goal of increasing the blood pressure to a MAP of 75 mmHg during 30 minutes. After a washout period the CRRT circuit was changed to the other CVDC and the experiment was repeated. Results: The median dose of noradrenaline with the CRRT in the jugular vein was 0.34 (IQR 0.25) and in the femoral vein 0.14 (IQR 0.13) \u03bcg/kg/min (p = 0.021). Conclusions: During CRRT, the noradrenaline dose needed to reach a target blood pressure in hypotensive piglets was twice as high with the CVC and CVDC close together, compared with CVC and CVDC on opposite sides of the diaphragm. This suggests that there is a possible clearance of noradrenaline and that the clearance is affected by catheter positioning", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1895, "end": 1896, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2036, "end": 2037, "text": "2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2664, "end": 2667, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2668, "end": 2671, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2672, "end": 2675, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2823, "end": 2826, "text": "(4,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2827, "end": 2829, "text": "5)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A1178"}, {"text": "A first evaluation of omni, a new device for renal replacement therapy P.

Schneider 1 1 Introduction: Due to the lack of conventional dialysis facilities in our centre, intermittent renal replacement therapies (IRRT) are led and performed by the ITU team. This team comprises a group of specialist outreach nurses with the support of intensivists. IRRT are performed nocturnally by ITU nurses in level 2 areas according to our Hospital policy. Objectives: To describe the use and results of IRRT in level 2 areas in patients that have left ITU with established AKI. These therapies are directed and performed by specialist intensive care nurses with the support of the ITU medical team. Methods: Retrospective observational study that included those patients admitted to level 3 areas at Harefield Hospital during 2015 that were transferred to level 2 areas still requiring IRRT. Demographic variables were collected, along with the indication and duration of IRRT and results. Results: 1829 patients were admitted to Harefield Hospital level 3 areas during 2015, of which 229 patients required continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT). This population included patients admitted after cardiac and thoracic surgery, heart or lung transplantation, mechanical circulatory devices, out of hospital cardiac arrests (OOHCA) and medical admissions from the cardiology or cardio-thoracic surgical wards. Demographic variables were collected, along with the indication and duration of CRRT. 31 of those patients still required intermittent renal replacement therapies at their discharge to a level 2 area. 19 of them (61.3 %) were male and the group was a median age of 49.34 years. 4 of them (12 %) were hypertensive and 6 (19 %) were diabetic. As shown in Figure 149 , the most frequent reason for admission to intensive care was cardiac surgery (25.8 %, 8 patients), followed by lung transplantation, heart transplantation and medical admissions from the transplantation ward. The reasons for admission to intensive care in the general CRRT group are also shown in Figure 149 . The most frequent indication for initiation of CRRT was metabolic acidosis (54.8 %, 17 patients), followed by a combination of uraemia and fluid overload (16.1 %, 5 patients), uraemia (12.9 %, 4 patients) and fluid overload (3.2 %, 1 patients) as shown in Figure 150 . The median time of RRT was 93 days days whilst the median time of filtration in the general RRT group was 13 days. The in-hospital mortality (after discharge from ITU) was 32.3 % and was 45.4 % in the general CRRT group. No complications were associated with the use of intermittent renal replacement therapies in level 2 areas. Conclusions: The group of patients that required intermittent renal replacement therapies beyond their discharge from ITU had longer ITU and hospital lengths of stay. These therapies were performed safely in level 2 areas by the ITU team, allowing these patients to leave level 3 areas to continue their care.
