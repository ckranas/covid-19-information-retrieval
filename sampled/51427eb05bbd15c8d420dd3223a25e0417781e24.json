Randomized Using the TT method, the rescuers performed CPR with higher CC quality, but more incomplete recoil than they did using the TF method. The mean compression forces delivered in the first and second minutes were 3.53 \u00b11.27 kg and 3.22 \u00b11.11 kg(P= 0.012) for TFand 4.11 \u00b11.80 kg and 4.04 \u00b11.83 kg(P= 0.568) for TT, respectively. Pairwise comparison indicates that the compression force delivered through the TF method during the first and second minute of ECC were inferior tothat delivered through the TT method.TheTF method involved greater perceived exertionthantheTT method (5.27 \u00b14.69 vs. 4.02 \u00b12.31; P= 0.007) . The median perceived exertions for the TF and TT methods were 5 and 4, respectively. For infant CPR, the TT method involved greater loading force, lower fatigue, and higher overall ECC quality than the TF method. The optimal compression force is about 3.8-4.3 ",

Randomized In the 84 infants enrolled, the width of the sternum at Sap, and the vertical heart length from Sap were 0.85\u00b10. 31 and 1.71\u00b10.47cm, respectively . The length and width ofthe superimposed-thumb technique were 1.65\u00b10. 13 and 2.73\u00b10.22cm, respectively. The length and width of the alongside-thumb technique were 3.00\u00b10. 48 and 3.77\u00b10.24cm,respectively.

A manikin study looked at fatigue levels with the 2-thumb technique, comparing side-by-side or superimposed thumb position207 demonstrated that the superimposedthumbtechnique generated higher simulated blood pressure and pulse pressure but had a higher fatigue-rating score. Physiologic indices of fatigue showed no difference between groups. CT scansofthechest tocomparethumb(side-by-side)/fingers measurementsplacedonmanikinswereconducted to determine which method avoided compressing otherstructures when using the lower third of the sternum.208 Both methods compress other structures, but the 2-thumb method (side-by-side) performs better than the two finger method. The accuracy of using the nipple line to the xiphisternum landmarks for 2-finger chest compression was examined by Clements.209 They concluded that this method could result in abdomen and xiphisternum compression in all infants and suggested an alternate method of determining position.",

This evidence update excluded studies of children from Africa and excluded studies conducted in children with Dengue shock. The reason for excluding these studies is because the population of children studied in Africa are much different than children with sepsis seen in higher resource settings. Specifically, the large FEAST trial{Maitland 2011 2483} and subsequent studies conducted in this population represent a different pathophysiologic process compared with sepsis observed in children from high-resource regions as detailed below. For example, in the FEAST trial, 57% of children had malaria, 32% had a hemoglobin <5 g/dL at presentation, 37% had seizures, 39% had severe lactic acidosis (>5 mmol/L) and 83% were characterized as having respiratory distress. In addition, sickle cell disease was likely more prevalent than reported originally since a subsequent study in this same population using a molecular test identified twice the number of sickle cell disease cases (28%) than identified by family history.{Maitland 2019 420}",

A cardiogenic TCE was observed about twice as often (41%) as a respiratory (21%) or neurologic syndrome (21%). Mortality was especially increased in those children with a presenting hemoglobin concentration <5 g/dL (10.5% vs. 5.7% in no bolus group). Notably, only 1.7% of the fluid bolus children with an initial hemoglobin \u2265 5 g/dL died compared with 10.5% of the severely anemic children who received a NS or albumin bolus. Furthermore, 67.2% of the TCEs in the severe anemic group were classified as cardiogenic shock compared with 19.4% in children with a higher hemoglobin concentration. Furthermore, supplemental data from the original FEAST trial{Maitland 2011 2483} reported that of the 103 severely anemic children who were not transfused within 8 hours of presentation, 52% died. Of note, 20% of the no-bolus children received blood in the first hour versus only 2% and 4% respectively in the albumin and saline groups, so early blood transfusion rather than a fluid bolus may partly explain the improved outcome in the no-bolus group.",

For example, a recent adult study documented microcirculatory obstruction by malaria parasites; nonsurvivors had greater capillary obstruction than survivors.{Hanson 2015 122} In this study, admission plasma lactate in malaria patients was the strongest predictor of death, consistent with microcirculatory obstruction leading to local tissue hypoxia even if global cardiac output appears adequate. Since malaria sequestration physically obstructs the microcirculation, which limits the size of the vascular compartment, it is likely that excessive fluids increases the capillary hydrostatic pressure leading to tissue edema and increased oxygen diffusion distance in patients who already have compromised tissue oxygen delivery secondary to anemia. In support of this conclusion is the observation from a recent trial in a similar population of African children comparing 20 mL/kg of whole blood (or 10 mL/kg of pRBC) vs. 30 [1.35 -6.58 ]. Interestingly, for reasons that are not clear, the mortality risk was reversed in afebrile children who had better survival with the larger blood transfusion. These data further suggest that a large volume adversely affects outcome in this population of children where 64.1% had malaria and 28% had sickle cell disease, which also can obstruct the microcirculation. C-reactive protein (CRP) was not measured in the original FEAST trial, but was measured in the more recent blood transfusion trial. Dengue is excluded because unlike most other forms of infection-related shock, dengue is characterized by a transient increase in capillary permeability leading to loss of intravascular volume, including small proteins such as albumin. These children are characterized by signs consistent with severe hypovolemia: narrow pulse pressure and cold extremities with hemoconcentration. Indeed, the severity of pulse pressure narrowing and rise in hematocrit are used to characterize disease severity.{Ranjit 2011 90} Furthermore, Dengue occurs 7 to 10 days after fever defervescence suggesting an immune mediated process rather than a direct effect from viral infection. Early resuscitation with fluids to restore perfusion is important, but in the context of altered capillary permeability, the importance of avoiding excessive fluid resuscitation is well recognized since excessively raising capillary hydrostatic pressure leads to ascites, pleural effusions and gut edema. Thus, it is well recognized that once the child is out of shock, fluid intake must be reduced and the patient carefully monitored to avoid adverse effects from excessive fluid administration. Association between timing of antibiotic (AB) administration and PICU LOS. In the septic shock subgroup, they evaluated both the timing of AB and amount of early fluid (first two hours) with PICU LOS. Other predefined outcomes were ventilator days, PICU LOS, delta-PELOD (the decrease in the score from day 1 to 3 of PICU admission), and mortality at one year after index sepsis admission.

In the septic shock cohort, administration of >20 mL/kg of fluid in the first 2 hours was associated with older age and higher PRISM scores with no difference in outcome. For the dichotomous outcomes of ventilator days >7, PICU LOS >7 days and delta-PELOD>median, there was more fluid given in the first 2 hours to children ventilated for at least 7 days: mean(SD) 36.7(34.9) vs. 20.2 (17.6) mL/kg, p=0.05, but the first 2 hours of fluid was clinically improved without the need for more aggressive therapy. In addition, even though their analysis adjusted for severity of illness (PRISM-III) and organ failure (PELOD), more severely ill children are more likely to receive more fluid. There was an association between fluid volume and longer LOS and ventilation, but this does not prove causation. 46% were transferred from an outside ED, so the volume and speed of resuscitation in that setting was not captured. This is a small cohort, especially those with septic shock (N=44), making generalizations difficult. There is no explanation of why the septic shock children were older. It is not surprising that early AB administration and larger fluid boluses in the first 2 hours was associated with longer LOS-children receiving early and more aggressive therapy were more likely to be perceived as more ill. not associated with PICU LOS>7 days or delta-PELOD. The PELOD score was much higher in those ventilated >7 days: 14.4(8) vs. 20.7(11) , p=0.007, as was the PRISM score: 10.4(6.1) vs. 14.5(8.6) The post-protocol group had a higher PIM2 score, but it is possible that the postprotocol children were more ill, as suggested by the PIM2 score, and that the protocol improved their outcome. It is also plausible that implementing the protocol increased clinician awareness and categorization of children as septic in the written notes. However, it is also plausible that the use of more rapid fluid administration adversely affected outcome (or failed to improve outcome) since many of the affected children had SAM. The trial comparing rapid vs. slower bolus administration (Sankar, et al) is consistent with this study: more rapid fluid administration may have an adverse effect in this population of malnourished children. The use of blood was also associated with increased mortality, rate of respiratory insufficiency was not different between groups. Median LOS (hours, IQR) was 96 (46-168) pre-vs. 120 (72-240) post-protocol, p=0.02.",

This approach was recommended by Maitland in letter to the editor regarding this study. Data in adults suggests that NS may have adverse effects on outcome, including increased mortality and increased risk of AKI. In addition, NS use is associated with the development of a non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Two large observational studies in children produced conflicting results (13) (14) with one showing harm and the other no harm. Two pragmatic trials in adults (critically ill and not critically ill) showed small, but meaningful reductions in major adverse kidney events and hospital mortality (11, 12) . A large, prospective, multi-centered trial in children would help determine if there is a clinical benefit from balanced vs. unbalanced crystalloid. The purpose of this trial was a single center feasibility study to determine 1) if ED clinicians could screen, randomize and administer study fluids to children with suspected septic shock during the course of routine care; 2) ensure acceptability to patients and providers of enrollment using the exception to informed consent process; and, 3) determine whether clinicians would adhere to an RCT of fluid type with minimal study team oversight.",

Other outcomes, such as respiratory morbidity, AKI, MOSD injury, etc. may be more relevant endpoints.

The role of viral infections in septic shock in children also needs further analysis-in many studies from high-resource countries it appears that children who meet severe sepsis/septic shock criteria often have a viral infection rather than a bacterial infection.

Overall CI is measured by ultrasound and we don't know what changes, if any, in regional blood flow occurred, but it appears that the patient's endogenous SNS response was lower. In addition, what happened to the patient's temperature following the one-hour infusion? If it went down, there would be a smaller HR adjustment, however, temperature may have continued to go up. It would also be interesting to know what this type of study would show in a child with rotavirus-induced dehydration for example. Would CI increase and stay higher? It likely depends on how dehydrated the patient was.

Thus, defining shock as having a blood pressure less than this threshold or the PALS threshold is not evidence based. Moreover, blood pressure is not often available in limited resource settings and the current widespread use of oscillometric blood pressure devices adds another layer of complexity to the analysis since these devices are not accurate at lower blood pressures.{Alpert 2014 930; Holt 2011 e391}",

Thus, a more cautious approach is appropriate, perhaps especially if the child is significantly malnourished. It is important to recognize that the bulk of sepsis mortality in limited resource settings results from complications associated with or caused by malaria, HIV, tuberculosis, malnutrition, limited access to care and late presentation.

Recommendations at that time appear to be based on above data and expert consensus. From 2010, \"some experts (Pollard, Nadel et al. 2007) , in an article discussing their personal management of meningococcal disease, proposed to change the time at which elective tracheal intubation is recommended, suggesting that intubation be performed if shock persists after 40-60 ml/kg of volume resuscitation instead of the 40 ml/kg previously recommended. Gray (Gray, Gour et al. 2007) argued that although early intubation in fluid refractory septic shock is desirable, the trigger for tracheal intubation should not be based solely on the volume of resuscitation fluid administered; the trigger should be based on clinical need. Russell (Ross Russell, Morley et al. 2008 ) pointed out that is important that the cardiovascular benefits of intubation are considered as well as the respiratory benefits, and anecdotally commented that waiting until the patient is moribund is too late.\" STEP 0: identification of high-quality reviews (as evaluated by AMSTAR 2), guidelines (as evaluated by AGREE 2) or existing ILCOR COSTR (2010 or later) that concern directly the population and intervention described above.

I do not think this meets criteria for a formal review but based on the literature, there is clearly an opportunity to address this PICO in future research. This review focuses only on the data from 2015 through present. In summary, Chau's article has an excellent risk stratification proposal and Avila-Alvarez's review article outlines some evidence for the use of iNO in the peri-operative care of CHD patients at high-risk for PH-related issues. From what I could find, though, there were no articles in this search that specifically addresses whether attention/treatment towards hypoxia or acidosis results in improved outcomes for post-op CHD patients who are at high risk for PH/PH crisis. It may be worth revisiting the PICU question itself---I do not think it is reasonable for the 'C' in this PICO to be 'no post-operative' care---that just does not happen. A more appropriate question might be: Among infants and children with pulmonary hypertension at high risk for pulmonary hypertensive crises (P), what additional post-operative care/medications/monitoring or interventions (I), compared with routine post-operative care (C), reduce the incidence of post-op PH crisis, cardiopulmonary arrest and/or mortality (O)?",

Several articles looked at a variety of drugs for the treatment of adenosine-resistant SVT. These include procainamide, amiodarone and sotalol. Procainamide and amiodarone are both moderately effective at terminating resistant SVT. In refractory cases, there is currently insufficient data to support the use of IV Sotalol for terminating SVT when other antiarrhythmic drugs fail, when cardioversion fails or for unstable tachyarrhythmias, although there are emerging studies demonstrating its safety and effectiveness. Prior consultation with a pediatric cardiologist for sotalol use and close monitoring of QTc and heart rate is required following administration of IV sotalol.",

Overall survival to discharge among patients with subsequent VF/VT (developed at some points of the resuscitation) was also worse than survival in patients who never developed subsequent VF/pVT. An event duration of more than 15 minutes was also associated with worse course.

All infants, children, and young adults with sudden, unexpected death should, if possible, have an unrestricted, complete autopsy, preferably performed by pathologists with training and expertise in cardiovascular pathology. Consideration should be given to preservation and genetic analysis of tissue to determine the presence of a channelopathy. It is recommended that families of patients whose cause of death is not found on autopsy be referred to a healthcare provider or center with expertise in cardiac rhythm disturbances. Selected articles for review included those with sudden death and genetic screening for channelopathy (56 articles) Evidence table contain studies reporting genetic evaluation in the context of channelopathy with a focus of utility of family screening (7 articles) There were no randomized trials evaluating the benefit of family screening for channelopathy in failed resuscitation. Thus the evidence is constructed using the utility of genetic screening in identifying \"actionable information\" or \"genetic information\" that may useful in the diagnosis and prevention of SD in relatives. We also included the yield of genetic screening in families and relatives regardless of whether a benefit was demonstrated. Types of genetic testing, yield of screening, specific genes screened, interpretation of genetic mutations, and assigning pathogenicity to mutations and variants varied widely among centers and in the published article. It is important to consider these issues in the interpretation of genetic screening and issuing recommendations for routine screening. Furthermore, genetic screening recommendations and interpretation requires the oversight of a cardiac genetics or inherited heart disease expert.",

Position the cardiac monitor leads or self-adhesive pads soon as possible to enable differentiation between a shockable and a non-shockable cardiac rhythm. Defibrillation paddles can be used to determine a rhythm if monitor leads or self-adhesive pads are not immediately available. Theme 2: size of pads and paddles. Select the largest possible available paddles to provide good contact with the chest wall. The ideal size is unknown but there should be good separation between the pads. Recommended sizes are: \u2022 4.5 cm diameter for infants and children weighing <10 kg \u2022 8-12 cm diameter for children weighing >10 kg (older than one year) To decrease skin and thoracic impedance, an electrically conducting interface is required between the skin and the paddles. Preformed gel pads or self-adhesive defibrillation electrodes are effective and are recommended for maximal delivery of the energy. Self-adhesive pads facilitate continuous good quality CPR. Do not use saline-soaked gauze/pads, alcohol-soaked gauze/pads or ultrasound gel. Theme 3: placement and location. Apply the paddles firmly to the bare chest in the antero-lateral position, one paddle placed below the right clavicle and the other in the left axilla. If the paddles are too large and there is a danger of charge arcing across the paddles, one should be placed on the upper back, below the left scapula and the other on the front, to the left of the sternum. This is known as the antero-posterior position and is also acceptable. Observational, prospective; n=48 children with VF or pulseless VT who received external shock (IHCA) Results primary endpoints (P value; OR or RR; & 95% CI) ROSC occurred in 37 (48%) of 48 'shockable' resuscitative episodes (61 events).

Most complications will result in VF with immediate needfor defibrillation. For this reason, patients must be continuously monitored and adefibrillator must be available in the angiography room. Self-adhesive radiolucent defibrillation pads may already be placed at the beginning of the procedure in high-risk patients. In this special setting with immediate response to monitored VF, defibrillation without preceding chest compressions is recommended. As the patient is early in the electrical phase of acardiac arrest, in contrast to the guidelines for unmonitored and OHCAs, the result of defibrillation (VF termination and ROSC) can be determined before chest compressions arestarted. If needed for failed defibrillation or immediately recurring VF, immediate defibrillation may be repeated up to two times.

(Hawkes, Langhan, Hunt, Hawkes) 3) There was one randomized controlled trial demonstrating that capnography was faster than confirmation than clinical assessment in premature infants intubated in the delivery room. (Hosono) 4) There are no randomized controlled trials linking use of ETCO2 detection with clinical outcomes, nor are there likely to be any such trials since the practice has been endorsed widely and recognized as a best practice. 5) Examining rare events through large data bases with focus on quality improvement provides a new lens for considering best practice rather than relying on clinical studies. By expanding the literature search to adverse event reporting, the value of large data base research revealed several new streams of data that confirm the strength of the recommendation for ETCO2 verification and continued usage in all environments where patient is reliant on invasive airway for respiratory support. (Cook, Hawkes). However, one database failed to show difference in outcome (delayed recognition of esophageal intubation) in the setting of academic pediatric ED when ETCO2 detection was employed.

Length-based estimates without adjustment for habitus or anthropomorphic measures show systematic bias (underestimate weight of obese, overestimate malnourished, less reliable or impractical in older children). Age-based formulae, medical provider estimates, and best guess estimates are highly inaccurate. The current 2010 recommendation states \"To calculate the dose of resuscitation medications, use the child's weight if it is known. If the child's weight is unknown, it is reasonable to use a body length tape with pre-calculated doses (Class IIa, LOE C).\" If the child's weight is unknown, it may be reasonable to use parental estimate or to use a body length tape incorporating an adjustment for body habitus and anthropomorphic measures such as Mid Arm Circumference (MAC), coupled with a cognitive aid to determine pre-calculated doses), however, we acknowledge significant implications of such a statement. It has taken significant knowledge translation efforts to have practitioners incorporate the Broselow Tape into their practice, and to change systems at this point may undermine this work. It should also be noted that the evidence review also highlighted consistently observed errors related to use of some systems (especially the Broselow tape) for practitioners without specific training on how to use the cognitive aid; moreover, simply estimating a weight does not eliminate errors in medication dosing or delivery without additional support for the calculation of resuscitation drug doses and volumes (e.g. supplementary reference books/apps).",

Use of the actual body weight in calculation of drug doses in obese patients may result in potentially toxic doses. Length-based tapes estimate the 50th percentile weight for length (ie, ideal body weight), which may, theoretically, result in inadequate doses of some medications in obese patients. Despite these theoretical considerations, there are no data regarding the safety or efficacy of adjusting the doses of resuscitation medications in obese patients. Therefore, regardless of the patient's habitus, use the actual body weight for calculating initial resuscitation drug doses or use a body length tape with precalculated doses (Class IIb, LOE C).\" It should be noted that without adjusting for body habitus or the addition of anthropomorphic measures, current weight estimation strategies such as the Broselow system underestimate actual body weight but may approximate ideal body weight. Furthermore, limited pharmacokinetic studies and reviews suggest that consideration of pharmacokinetic properties of individual medications as well as developmental and compositional characteristics of children (e.g., obesity) are important considerations in determining the ideal dose for a given individual. Lipophilic medications may best be dosed on actual body weight while hydrophilic medications on ideal body weight, but there is significant individual variation and very limited data from clinical pharmacokinetic studies on obese children and none at all for underweight / malnourished children. Despite a wide range of allometric scaling approaches as well as Developmental Pharmacokinetic approaches to medication dosing, no single formula or strategy accurately reflects observed pharmacokinetics in the limited pediatric data.

From this evidence review, the only known modification to standard practice for this population that improves outcomes in the arrest state is the rapid institution of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary support instituted in the setting of a cardiac arrest (ECPR) that is recalcitrant to standard CPR. Alfousi (2014) reports 37% of the SV group having ECPR, with decannulation and survival rates of 55% and 32%.

There are no data in the setting of HLHS receiving heparin administration during CPR for an arrest of unknown etiology (particularly if shunt blockage is suspected), however following general guidelines for significant vascular occlusion, it may be worth considering administering an intravenous bolus of unfractionated heparin (dose 100 U/kg if not concurrently receiving heparin, otherwise bolus dose 50 U/kg) (based on cardiac catheter guideline recommendations for antithrombotic therapy for suspected acute shunt thrombosis). For the SV patient in the pre-arrest state, there is evidence to support the use of vasodilators such as milrinone following S1P in order to effectively decrease SVR, improved serum lactate, and decrease postoperative cardiac arrest. There is also newer data to support the analysis of standard physiologic data, including ST segment analysis, to in order to identify those SV patients at increased risk of arrest.

The authors advocate for refinement of this metric to include a fraction of fat mass (FFM) to calculate Normal Fat Mass (NFM) which is calculated as NFM = FFM + Ffat x (TBM-FFM)",

With regard to the position of the pads, we could not identify any strong evidence to advise in favour of either the anterioposterior or the antero-lateral position.

'Cardiac origin' arrest was categorised following signal detection into six subgroups defined by public automated external defibrillator use, defibrillation by emergency medical service, age, initial ECG rhythm and eyewitness to arrest; the ranges of CPC 1 or 2 in the six subgroups were between 87.5% and 0.7%. 'Non-cardiac' origin arrest was categorised into four subgroups. Bystander rescue breathing was the most significant factor contributing to outcome; additionally, two other factors [eyewitness to arrest and age] were also significant. CPC 1 or 2 rates ranged between 38.5% and 4% across the four subgroups. Rates of CPC 1 or 2 in the validation study did not differ among any subgroup. The proportions by some subgroups seem different between samples (ie, 87.5% for sample 1 and 35.3% for sample 2 for subgroup 1 in patients with cardiac origin). Small sample size due to grouping after split-half could contribute to inconsistency, which might affect the generalisability of the findings. Summary/Conclu sion -Comments As for other epidemiological studies, data validity, integrity and bias should be taken into account. For example, the diagnosis of presumed cardiac arrest was decided exclusively, and non-cardiac cause was given when there was no obvious evidence of acardiac arrest. Forcardiac OHCA, thestudy identified five factors-public AEDuse, initial ECGrhythm, defibrillation, age and witnessed cardiac arrest-contributing to CPC 1 or 2. Fornon-cardiac OHCA, it identifiedthreefactors-bystanderrescuebreathing, witnessed cardiac arrest and age-contributing to CPC 1 or 2. Before 2010.

Furthermore, children with exclusive use of BF decreased from10.9% in 2004 to 3.4% in 2012  (p<0.001). Overall, 24% received any amount of BF during the first 24 h; 2398 received exclusive BF at 24 hours and 1641 at 72 hours. The BF group was younger at admission(3.2,. The unbalanced fluid (UB) group (n=30,166) had a 6.3% renal comorbidity vs. 3.8% in BF group, which may bias the results (p<0.001). Malignancy was also more common in the UB group (19.1%) vs. BF (14.9%) (p<0.001), whereas CV comorbidity was more common in the BF group(32.9% vs. 25.7% (p<0.001)). The general type of infection did not differ at24-or 72hours. Hospital mortality was lower in exclusive BF group vs. UB (14.3% vs 15.8%; p=0.048) as was AKI presence (17.2% vs. 23.2%; p<0.001) and CRRT (6.2% vs. 8.9%; p<0.001). However, patients receiving BF in first 24 h had longer PICU LOS (10 vs. 8 days; p<0.001)) and total LOS (23 vs 19 d; p<0.001).Patients who received exclusive BF were propensity matched in a 1:6 ratio with those who received only UFs at both 24 and 72 hours. In this analysis, 8,844 UB patients were matched with 1474 BFs. In the 24-hour analysis, total LOS and PICU LOS were again longer in the BF patients. There were no significant differences in vasoactive infusion days, presence of AKI or CRRT use. Although mortality was lower in BF group, it was not significant(13.4% vs. 15.5%;  p=0.051;). In the 72-hour analysis, 7000 UB patients were matched with 1,000 BF patients. Mortality was significantly lower in BF group(12.5% vs. 15.9%; p=0.007; OR 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62-0.93). Total LOS was longer in the BFs group but PICU LOS was not significantly different. The use of CRRT was lower in the BF group, but not significantly(5.4% vs. 7.2%; p=0.054). Vasoactive infusion days also shorter with BF Discussion: Since the use of BF decreased over time, it makes it difficult to ascribe mortality changes to BF use alone. The diagnosis of PSS also increased over time as the overall mortality decreased. Although adult studies showed similar results using propensity matching, a randomized multicentered trial comparing buffered crystalloid to NS found no difference in outcome(Young P, et  al.

It was considered of medium quality due to Dobutamine should be used at a dose of 5-20 \u00b5g/kg/min in cases of cardiogenic shock with maintained blood pressure so as to restore cardiac output (strong agreement). It is probably advisable to use milrinone (continuous perfusion of 0.5-0.75 \u00b5g/kg/min) as an alternative to dobutamine in children with cardiogenic shock, especially in post-cardiac surgery patients and in cases with impaired right ventricle function and/or associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (strong agreement). Levosimendan (continuous perfusion of 0.1-0.2 \u00b5g/kg/min) may be used as second-line treatment in patients with cardiogenic shock who do not respond to the usual therapy (dobutamine or milrinone with or without diuretics), especially for postoperative management after cardiac surgery (strong agreement). * If vasopressors are combinedwith inotropes to achieve adequate perfusion pressure, it is probably advisable to use noradrenaline as first-line treatment, especially in patients with low cardiac output, reduced vascular resistance, and persistent hypotension (strong agreement). Noradrenaline should be replaced by adrenaline in patients with inotrope-resistant cardiogenic shock (strong agreement). It is probably not advisable to use dopamine to treat cardiogenic shock in children (strong agreement). It is probably advisable touse terlipressin/arginine vasopressin as last-resort treatment in children with vasopressor-resistant cardiogenic shock (common vasopressors such as noradrenaline and adrenaline) (strong agreement). * It is probably not advisable to use nitrated derivatives to treat cardiogenic shock in children (strong agreement)",

One of these studies71 included infants and children in cardiac arrest. In the cardiac arrest population the sensitivity of exhaled CO2 detection was only 85% (ie, false-negatives occurred), whereas the specificity remained at 100%. One neonatal LOE 5 study161 of delivery room intubation demonstrated that detection of exhaled CO2 by capnography was 100% sensitive and specific for detecting esophageal intubation and took less time than clinical assessment to identify esophageal intubation. Two additional neonatal LOE 5 studies162, 163 showed that confirmation of tracheal tube position is faster with capnography than with clinical assessment. Two pediatric LOE 4 studies164, 165 showed that in the presence of a perfusing rhythm, exhaled CO2 detection or measurement can confirm tracheal tube position accurately during transport, while 2 LOE 5 animal studies166,167 showed that tracheal tube displacement can be detected more rapidly by CO2 detection than by pulse oximetry. One LOE 2 operating room study168 showed that the esophageal detector device (EDD) is highly sensitive and specific for correct tracheal tube placement in children 20 kg with a perfusing cardiac rhythm; there have been no studies of EDD use in children during cardiac arrest. An LOE 4 operating room (ie, non-arrest) study169 showed that the EDD performed well but was less accurate in children 20 kg. Treatment Recommendations Confirmation of tracheal tube position using exhaled CO2 detection (colorimetric detector or capnography) should be used for intubated infants and children with a perfusing cardiac rhythm in all settings (eg, out-of-hospital, emergency department, ICU, inpatient, operating room). In infants and children with a perfusing rhythm, it may be beneficial to monitor continuous capnography or frequent intermittent detection of exhaled CO2 during out-of-hospital and intra-/interhospital transport. The EDD may be considered for confirmation of tracheal tube placement in children weighing 20 kg when a perfusing rhythm is present. ",

These recommendations are based on the following scientific evidence from animal models: (1) Ventilation vs. no ventilation appears to improve outcome from cardiac arrest, including asphyxial cardiac arrest (Idris 1994 [827-834] , Berg 1999 Berg [1893 LOE 5) and fibrillatory arrest (Yannopoulos 2010 [254] LOE 5); (2) Hyperventilation is deleterious to hemodynamics during CPR, by raising intrathoracic pressure and reducing coronary perfusion pressure (Aufderheide 2004, LOE 5 [S345-351] ); (3) During low-flow states, mixed venous oxygen saturation and oxygen delivery are primarily related to cardiac output, and are minimally affected by changes in minute ventilation [Idris (1994 ) , LOE 5] , and that during cardiac arrest decreasing minute ventilation by up to 50% produces acceptable blood gas parameters (Winkler 1998, LOE 5 [201-6] . A randomized trial using adult humans with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest showed no differences in ROSC, hospital admission, or survival to discharge between patients who received mechanical ventilation compared with constant oxygen insufflation (Bertrand 2006 LOE 1) . Collectively, these data suggest that decreasing minute ventilation from baseline in proportion to the decrease in cardiac output during CPR may provide sufficient gas exchange without the negative effects of hyperventilation. Furthermore, the possibility that adequate oxygenation may be provided without use of positive pressure ventilations is an intriguing concept that requires further investigation.",

Prevalence of Sepsis-associated IHCA in multicenterand registry-based pediatricstudiesrangesfrom 14-34%. 2. Outcome: in studies from 1980s-90s survival tohospital dischargewas 1 of 199 adults with septic CA. More recent registry data suggest improvement over the last two decades but patients with sepsis-associated IHCA haveworse outcome than thosewithout sepsis. Limiteddata suggest thatthose who survive sepsis-associated IHCA are pronetohigherpostresuscitation mortality. Paediatric data from GWTG-Rdatabase: OR of survival to discharge of 0.65 (0.46-0.94) for children with sepsis-associated IHCA. Iberoamerican Pediatric Cardiac Arrest Study Network founda RR of mortality of 8.25 (2.93-23.19) for children in ICUs with sepsis-associated IHCA compared to those withoutsepsis at the time of CA. Theuse ofmore standardizeddefinitionofsepsis in studiesofIHCA wouldhelpensurethatdataaboutprevalence and outcomes arecollected and reported in a more uniform and comparable manner. Future CA studies could specifically report on thepresence of septic shock in hours preceding CA. Thecardinalmanifestations of septic shock, including vasodilation, hypovolemia, and myocardial dysfunction, along with concurrent hypoxemia, acidosis and metabolic derangements likely formthe basis of the complex pathophysiological pathwaysthat both contribute to CA and impedesuccessful ROSCinthese patients.",

Several rescue therapies for these situations are described including the use of specific medicationsto target pulmonary hypertension (if present), the use of milrinone, enoximone, vasopressin, methylene blue (e.g. Rutledge C 2015 . Also novel vasoactive drugs are being tested in phase II trials in adults (e.g. selepressin described in Russell JA 2017 213) . The early consideration of ECMO in severe septic shock refractory to fluids and vasoactive medication is recommended in many articles including the above mentioned guidelines. Concomitant MODS in the cohort of patients with severe refractory septic shock is common. Kawai Y 2015 366 describedin aretrospective single center cohort study that the use of therapeutic plasma exchange in children on ECLS with sepsis-induced MODS is associated with organ failure recovery and improved hemodynamic status. Initiating therapeutic plasma exchange early was associated with greater improvement in organ dysfunction and decreased requirement for vasoactive and/or inotropic agents. Morin L 2019 (the ESPNIC perspective) performed asurvey that identified significant variability in the current clinician-reported practice of paediatric septic shock management. As most recommendations are not supported by solid evidence, thesefindings outline some limitation of existing pediatric guidelines with regard to context and patient's specificity. E.g. norepinephrine was stated to be used in 94% of the PICU physicians surveyed, although dopamine or epinephrine are still recommended as first-line vasoactive drugs in pediatric septic shock. Similarly, Parker MJ 2013 2188 performed a national survey in Canada to evaluate the preferences and self-reported practices of pediatric acute care physicians with respect to sodium bicarbonate administration to infants and children in shock or cardiac arrest and found a significant differences of opinion among pediatric acute care physicians with respect to the timing and appropriateness ofsodium bicarbonate administration during resuscitation and severe septic shock. Most indicated they would support moving forward with a clinical trial.",

Intheabsenceofonscene SOL, survival following EDTis extremelyunlikely.Survivalissignificantlyhigherinthenon-USApublications;reasonsforthisarehighlycomplex. Another systematic review (Seamon MJ 2015 159 ) that included 72 studies on 10238 adults strongly recommended that patients who present pulseless with signs of life after penetrating thoracic injury undergo EDT. The biggest benefit of EDT wasseenforpenetratingthoracicinjuriespresentingwithsignsoflife.ThereviewconditionallyrecommendedEDTfor patients who present pulseless and have absent signs of life after penetrating thoracic injury, present or absent signs of life after penetrating extrathoracic injury, or present signs of life after blunt injury. Lastly, the authors conditionally recommend against EDT for pulseless patients without signs of life after blunt injury. (LEVEL III evidence). Slessoretal(SlessorD2015297)looked atthesurvivalandneurologicallyintactsurvivorofadultpatientswithblunt trauma(27articles).Of1,369patientswhounderwentanEDthoracotomy,21(1.5%)survivedwithagoodneurologic outcome. All 21 patients had vital signs present on scene or in the ED and a maximum duration of CPR of 11 to 15 minutes. GoodoutcomeshavebeenachievedforpatientswhohadvitalsignsonadmissionandforpatientswhoreceivedanED thoracotomy within 15 minutes of cardiac arrest. (LEVEL IV evidence) Emergency thoracotomy is performed relatively often in the military setting for mass casualty indicets. Children can form up to 45.5% of the civilian casualties of war injuries (Campbell K 2019) . Special training and resources were used in this setting andthemostcommonmechanismsofinjurieswereblastandgunshotinjuries.Itisdifficultto extrapolatedatafromthis settingtothe Europeanpaediatricpopulationofpatients with severe injuries andtraumatic cardiac arrest. Moore EE (WTA study group; Moore 2011 334) studied in amulticenter prospective study the injury patterns and physiologic profiles at ED arrival that werecompatible withsurvival ofpatients (15-64y) after resuscitative EDT. Survival was predominant in those with thoracic injuries (77%), followed by abdomen (9%), extremity (7%), neck (4%), and head (4%). Themostcommoninjury was aventricularstabwound (30%), followedby agunshotwoundtothe lung(16%);9%of survivorssustainedblunttrauma, 34% underwentprehospitalcardiopulmonary resuscitation(CPR). Relevanttofutilecare, there were survivorsofblunttorsoinjuries with aneed for CPR upto 9 minutes andpenetratingtorsowoundsupto 15 minutes. Asystolewas documented at ED arrival in sevenpatients (12%); all thesepatients had pericardial tamponade and three (43%) had good functional neurologic recovery at hospital discharge. Finally, Capoteet al (Capote 2013982 ) assessed inaretrospectivestudytheappropriatenessofperforming EDTbased on the guidelines recommendations in patients admitted to Level II trauma center and compared surgeons and emergency physicians. Themortalityin EDT patients was 81% inpenetratingvs. 93% in blunttrauma. 55 EDTs performed with 18.2% survivors and 32 notindicated with 9.4% survivors. Surgeons adhered to guidelines morecompared with EDphysicians. Patients of ED physicians were more likely to die.Emergency thoracostomy: Dickson RL 2018 366 showed thatperforming bilateral thoracostomyis relatively simpleprocedurethat can be easily safely and effectively performed by ground-based EMS personnel in traumatic cardiac arrest. A tension pneumothorax and/or haemothoraxwaspresentinathirdofthepatientsinthis cohortconfirmingpreviouslyfoundhighpercentagesofthese reversiblecauses ofcardiac arrest. ROSC was achievedin 25% ofthepatients. Survival withoutneurologicaldisabilitywas 7%. All the survivors were patients with blunt trauma presenting with initial PEA rhythm.Similar results were also found in another retrospective cohort study (High K 2016 227) where finger thoracostomy or tube thoracostomywas performed by HEMSpersonnel. 98.4% ofpatientshadtraumatic injuries. CPR was requiredin 65.2% of patients undergoing FT/TT. 30% of patients exhibited clinical improvement such as increasing systolic blood pressure, oxygensaturation,improvedlung compliance,orareleaseofbloodorairundertension.Complicationssuchastube dislodgementor empyemahappenedin3.4%ofthecohort.TheauthorssuggestthatflightcrewscanuseFT/TTintheir practice on patients with actual or potential pneumothoraces with limited complications.

Therewere five groups: chestcompressionsonly, IVwholeblood, IVsaline, IV wholeblood+ chestcompressionsand IV saline + chest compressions. Mortality was defined as MAP below 10 mmHg. The group with chestcompressions only had significantly higher mortality than groups 2 and 3. Resuscitation with whole blood was better than saline. The addition of chest compressions to fluid resuscitation resulted in a significantly worse outcome with saline resuscitation but not with blood. Theauthorsconcludethatchestcompressionswereassociatedwithincreasedmortalityand compromised haemodynamics compared to fluid resuscitation. Whole blood resuscitation was better than saline.Trauma Care Systems: Hakakian D 2019 95 investigated differences between the modes of transport and outcome in retrospective analysis in level Itraumacenter.TheHEMSpatientshadsignificantlyhigherISS,however themortalityandLoSwerenotstatistically differentcomparedtoGEMSsuggestingtheproperuseof HEMS.OlderageandhigherISShadthelargestimpacton mortality.
