All mammals, including monotremes and marsupials, possess a neocortex, but in reptiles, i.e. the ancestors of mammals, only a three-layered neocortical primordium is present [509, 511] . The term neocortex refers to its late phylogenetic appearance, in comparison to the \"palaeocortical\" olfactory cortex and the \"archicortical\" hippocampal cortex, both of which are present in all amniotes [509] . The size of the neocortex varies greatly among the various mammalian groups. In some insectivores, such as the hedgehog, its ) and of a number of subcortical centres (marked in A and B by the same hatchings/symbols) are indicated. In the opossum, the neocortex covers the remaining parts of the telencephalic hemispheres like a cap. In humans, the enormously expanded neocortex almost completely surrounds all subcortical centres. amc, amygdaloid complex; aon, anterior olfactory nucleus; olb, olfactory bulb; ot, olfactory tubercle; sep, precommissural septum; str, corpus striatum size does not exceed that of the \"older\" parts of the cortex, but in primates and cetaceans it attains remarkable proportions, becoming by far the largest centre in the brain (Figs. 15.1, 15.2) . Stephan and Andy [709] determined the average index of progression for the neocortex (and for many other brain structures) in a number of insectivores, prosimians and simians, including humans. These indices express how many times larger the neocortex is in a particular group of species than in that of a typical basal insectivore of the same size. It was found that in prosimians the neocortex is on average 14.5 times, and in the simians 45.5 times larger than in basal insectivores. In humans, the neocortex appeared to be 156 times larger than that of basal insectivores.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 334, "end": 339, "text": "[509,", "ref_id": "BIBREF424"}, {"start": 340, "end": 344, "text": "511]", "ref_id": "BIBREF426"}, {"start": 551, "end": 556, "text": "[509]", "ref_id": "BIBREF424"}, {"start": 1324, "end": 1335, "text": "15.1, 15.2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1355, "end": 1360, "text": "[709]", "ref_id": "BIBREF624"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 684, "end": 685, "text": ")", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "As regards the functional differentiation of the neocortex, in many \"primitive\" mammals (marsupials, insectivores and rodents) much of the neocortex is occupied by projection areas which either receive, via the thalamus, impulses directly related to the various special senses, or are concerned with the steering of motor activity.

In the hedgehog almost the entire neocortex is occupied by sensory (ss, vis, ac) and motor (m) areas. In the prosimian Galago the sensory cortical areas are separated by an area occupied by association cortex (pa). A second area of association cortex (aa) is found in front of the premotor cortex (pm). In the human the association areas are strongly developed. aa, anterior association area; ac, auditory cortex; i, insular cortex; m, motor cortex; pa, posterior association area; pm, premotor cortex; ss, somatosensory cortex; vis, visual cortex Apart from the neuronal perikarya, several other structural elements in the cortex show a more or less distinct laminar arrangement. Myelin-stained and reduced silver preparations reveal the presence of tangentially oriented fibre concentrations at several levels, and Golgi material shows that these fibres and their terminal ramifications may contribute to plexiform zones, which are likewise tangentially arranged. Thus, lamina I contains a dense plexus of horizontally running extrinsic and intrinsic fibres that contact the apical dendritic bouquets of pyramidal neurons situated in the deeper layers. Tangential plexuses of fibres in layer IV and deep in layer V are known as the outer and inner striae of Baillarger. These striae are probably formed primarily by intrinsic cortical axons, i.e. axons of local circuit neurons and collateral branches of pyramidal cell axons [340] .

Brodmann's map, which is by far the most widely used, is shown in Fig. 15 .8. Brodmann distinguished 44 sharply delineated areas, each of which he designated with a different figure. He emphasized that the boundaries between these areas generally do not coincide with the sulci on the cerebral surface. Von Economo and Koskinas [796] and Sarkissov et al.

Several authors have attempted to allocate the various cytoarchitectonic areas to a smaller number of variant types. It is worthy of note in this context that as early as 1874, Betz [51] pointed out that the human cerebral cortex is divided by the central sulcus of Rolando into an anterior part in which pyramidal cells predominate and a posterior part where granular cells prevail. In the anterior part he described the giant pyramidal cells that bear his name.

The cortical types labelled 2, 3 and 4 contain the six typical neocortical layers described above, although not all of these are developed to the same degree in the different types.

It will be seen that Kleist subdivided the cortex according to Brodmann (see Fig. 15 .8), and that he provided almost all of the cytoarchitectonic areas distinguished by the latter with a functional label. The overall functions of the primary sensory and motor areas, which were well known by the end of World War I, were correctly indicated. However, Kleist went far beyond that by attributing all sorts of higher cognitive and mental functions and faculties to many other areas. Thus, he associated temporal area 21 with acoustic awareness (\"akustische Aufmerksamkeit\"), prefrontal area 10 with motor skill (\"motorische Handlungsfolgen\") and orbitofrontal area 11 with personal and social ego (\"Selbst-und Gemeinschafts-Ich\").

He subjected animals, mostly rats, to complex maze-learning tests and analysed their performance before and after damaging various parts of the cerebral cortex [392, 393] . He found that their performance in the maze after operation was entirely independent of the location of the cortical lesion and only depended on its size. On the basis of his experimental results, Lashley formulated two general principles of brain organization, equipotentiality and mass action. With the term equipotentiality he designated the apparent capacity of any intact part of a functional area to carry out the functions lost by destruction of the whole. He considered it likely that this capacity holds only for associative parts of the cortex and for functions more complex than simple sensory or motor co-ordination. Lashley pointed out that the equipotentiality is not absolute but subject to the principle of mass action, whereby the efficiency of performance of a complex function may be reduced in proportion to the extent of brain injury within an equipotential area. Overall, Lashleys ideas about functional localization had much in common with those of Flourens and Goltz, but contrary to these authors, he accepted the general concepts of specialized sensory and motor areas in the cortex [187] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 23, "end": 28, "text": "[373,", "ref_id": "BIBREF288"}, {"start": 29, "end": 33, "text": "374]", "ref_id": "BIBREF289"}, {"start": 1176, "end": 1181, "text": "[119]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1190, "end": 1195, "text": "[744]", "ref_id": "BIBREF659"}, {"start": 1371, "end": 1384, "text": "Lashley (1890", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1385, "end": 1400, "text": "Lashley ( -1954", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1563, "end": 1568, "text": "[392,", "ref_id": "BIBREF307"}, {"start": 1569, "end": 1573, "text": "393]", "ref_id": "BIBREF308"}, {"start": 2685, "end": 2690, "text": "[187]", "ref_id": "BIBREF170"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 281, "end": 288, "text": "Fig. 15", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 371, "end": 378, "text": "Fig. 15", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}], "section": "Functional Subdivision"}, {"text": "Lashley not only challenged the functional but also the structural subdivision of the cerebral cortex.

It has already been mentioned that the total number of areas distinguished by Bailey and von Bonin [30] is much lower than that of other cytoarchitectonists (Table 15. 2). Braak [64] criticized the results of these authors. He stated that they missed or neglected obvious cytoarchitectonic boundaries and suspected that they were content with superficial observations. Several authors have attempted to localize functional areas in the cortex by electrical stimulation. Vogt and Vogt [784, 785, 787, 788] stimulated the cortex in monkeys (Cercopithecus) under general anaesthesia, and Foerster [197] did the same in patients who underwent brain operations under local anaesthesia. They found that, although the classical motor cortex on stimulation at low strength typically reacted with isolated contractions of small muscle groups, quite characteristic, more complex motor effects could be evoked from many other cortical areas. Thus, eye and head movements to the contralateral side could be elicited from areas 8 and 19, and stimulation of the parietal cortex produced synergic flexion of the contralateral arm and leg ( Fig. 15.18 C) . Their procedure of identifying functionally equivalent areas involved three steps: (1) They plotted the results of the stimulation experiments in the Cercopithecus monkeys on a cytoarchitectonic A The various effects of electrical stimulation of the cerebral cortex of the monkey Cercopithecus, plotted with particular symbols on a cytoarchitectonic map of the same species.

It appeared that almost all of the areas characterized by particular reactions exactly matched with a particular cytoarchitectonic area. (2) Next, they compared the cytoarchitecture of Cercopithecus monkeys with that of humans and were able to identify and to delineate in the latter equivalents of all the structurally and functionally characterized areas in the monkey brain.

The structure of the neocortex is not homogeneous throughout. 2. Many authors have attempted to subdivide the neocortex or parts thereof into structural entities, using cytoarchitectonic and/or myeloarchitectonic criteria. Most of these authors considered the resultant architectonic areas or fields not merely as structural entities, but also as functional units. We have seen that, on the basis of clinical evidence, Kleist provided nearly all of the areas delineated by Brodmann ( Fig. 15 .8) with a detailed functional label ( Fig. 15 . 17) , and that the Vogts sought to identify structuralfunctional units in the neocortex of monkey and humans, by combining the results of cytoarchitectonic analyses with those of electrical stimulation experiments ( Fig. 15.18 ). 3. The primary sensory and motor areas are structurally and functionally distinct. They can be easily identified as heterotypical agranular and granular areas (types 1 and 5 of von Economo: Fig. 15 .10), and as early maturing myelogenetic projection areas ( Fig.  15 .14). Hodologically, the primary sensory areas are defined by receiving the thalamocortical endsegments of the great sensory projections, whereas the primary motor cortex is characterized by its massive corticobulbar and corticospinal projections. 4. The remainder of the neocortex is formed by Flechsig's late-maturing association cortex. In the vast region occupied by this cortex, the structural differences between the different areas are rather subtle, which explains why the results of the various cytoarchitectonists are less concordant here than in the primary areas. All of the areas forming part of the association cortex occupy, as homotypical areas, an intermediate position in von Economo's classification system ( Fig.  15 .10). 5. Experimental studies on the cortico-cortical connections are and have been of paramount importance for both the morphological and functional interpretation of the association cortex. However, because such studies cannot be performed on humans, they have to be carried out on laboratory animals, preferably monkeys. Hence, in practice, the acquisition of data on the fibre connections of a given area in the human cortex involves the following four steps: (1) identifying and locating an area in the human cortex; (2) identifying and locating the homologue of that human area in the cortex of the monkey; (3) establishing the fibre connections of that area in the monkey cortex by using experimental tract-tracing techniques, and (4) extrapolating the results of these experiments to the human brain. A serious limitation of this indirect method is that many areas in the human neocortex have no obvious homologue in the monkey (Figs. 15.8, 15.12) [120] . Experimental studies in the monkey have shown that (a) the primary somatosensory, visual and auditory cortical areas project via short connections to adjacent unimodal association areas; (b) these unimodal sensory association areas project in turn to two strips of heteromodal sensory association cortex, situated in the lateral and medial parts of the parietal and temporal lobes; (c) the unimodal and heteromodal sensory association areas project massively to the prefrontal cortex which, on this account, should be considered as a higher association cortex, and (e) sequences of short connections successively link the various prefrontal areas, the premotor area and the primary motor area ( Fig. 15.15 ). It is important to note that the boundaries between the various association areas thus defined do not show a close correspondence to those of the cytoarchitectonic fields, as delineated by Brodmann and others. 6. A combination of connectional data with the results of microphysiological studies has shown that the wiring of the neocortex may be characterized as a distributed hierarchical network that contains numerous intertwined processing streams. 7. Unit activity recordings, the effect of lesions and particularly the results of neuroimaging studies have firmly established functional segregation as a principle of neocortical organization, not only in the primary cortices, but also in the association regions ( Fig.  15 .21). This having been said, it should immediately be added that the precise morphological identification of the functionally segregated domains is a difficult problem and much current research is devoted to this (see below). 8.

Such functional cartography with the aid of neuroimaging techniques has been characterized by some [508, 601, 744, 745] as \"neophrenology\". Anti-localizationism or holism holds that higher cognitive and mental functions are distributed homogeneously throughout the cortex and require the integrated activity of the entire cortex. The degree of cognitive or behavioural impairment following a cortical lesion is simply proportional to the amount of tissue destroyed, with localization being entirely irrelevant.

The physiological changes elicited in the cortex by particular cognitive processes or behaviours should be explained in terms of distributed patterns of changing neural activity in networks of interconnected, functionally specialized areas.

Although there is much respect and appreciation for the work of the classical architectonists, it is generally felt that their analyses show two serious methodological shortcomings and, hence, do not provide a reliable baseline for further studies on the organization of the cortex. These shortcomings are: (1) the classical parcellations are based on the study of microscopic sections stained according to a single technique, either the Nissl technique for neuronal perikarya or the Weigert technique for myelinated fibres, and (2) the areal boundaries were established using purely visual inspection of histological sections and were, hence, influenced by varying observer-dependent conditions, such as individual abilities in pattern recognition [660] . In current architectonic studies these methodological shortcomings are avoided by using several complementary histological techniques [747] and/or applying observer-independent procedures [659, 660] . Thus, Carmichael and Price [86] presented an architectonic division of the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex (OMPFC) of the macaque monkey based on nine different cytoarchitectonic, myeloarchitectonic and immunohistochemical stains. These stains included Nissl, myelin and acetylcholinesterase, and immunohistochemical stains for parvalbumin (PV), calbindin (CB) and a membranebound glycoprotein. A cortical area was defined as distinct if it was differentiated in at least three different stains. This analysis subdivided many of the areas originally described by Brodmann [70] and Walker [802] and resulted in the identification of 22 different areas in the OMPFC of the macaque monkey. A similar architectonic analysis of the human OMPFC, carried out by \u00d6ng\u00fcr et al. [518] , revealed that all of the areas recognized in the macaque monkey have counterparts in humans. On the basis of these results and of studies on the fibre connections of the various areas in the monkey [88, 89] , \u00d6ng\u00fcr et al. concluded that each of the cortical areas distinguished is a module with specific input-output relations and a unique role in information processing.

His Golgi material displayed two different laminar distributions of terminal arborizations: the \"specific\" distribution, which is densely aggregated in lamina IV, with or without extension to lamina III (a, b in figure  15 .25 A), and the \"unspecific\" distribution, which is sparsely distributed throughout all cortical layers, but appears predominantly in lamina VI (c in Fig. 15 .25 A). The \"specific\" afferents were considered to originate from \"specific\" thalamic sensory relay nuclei, such as the medial and lateral geniculate bodies and the ventral posterior nucleus, and to terminate in specific sensory cortical fields. The \"unspecific\" afferents, which were observed to extend over multiple cortical fields, were believed to originate from other, as yet undetermined thalamic sources. Frost and Caviness [213] studied the intracortical distributions of the projections of a number of different thalamic loci to the neocortex in the mouse using an axon degeneration technique. They found that in this animal virtually the entire tangential extent of the neocortex receives a projection from the thalamus. The areas of termination of thalamofugal axons appeared to be segregated into three tiers: an outer tier in layer I, a middle tier in layer IV and/or III and an inner tier in layer VI. In most fields, terminating axons belonging to the middle or the inner tier or both were found to extend over some distance into layer V. Herkenham [291] [292] [293] examined the cortical projections of individual thalamic nuclei in the rat using tritiated amino acids as anterograde tracers. He found that the thalamic nuclei can be grouped into three classes according to the laminar patterns of their cortical projections. The first class includes the thalamic relay nuclei for vision, audition and somatic sensibility. Their cortical projections terminate mainly in lamina IV, lamina III or both. The fibres of this class clearly correspond to the \"specific\" afferents of Lorente de N\u00f3 [416] . The second class includes the intralaminar thalamic nuclei, which issue sparse but wide-spread projections to deep cortical layers (laminae V, VI or both). The third class encompasses a number of nuclei that share a pattern of dense, widespread projections to lamina I, though terminations in other laminae may or may not be present. Because these nuclei projecting to lamina I generally occupy a position adjacent to the intralaminar nuclei, they were collectively designated by Herkenham [293] as the paralaminar nuclei. The finding that different (groups of) thalamic nuclei project in a particular laminar fashion to smaller or larger parts of the neocortex has been confirmed by a large number of studies on different animals, although with regard to the projections of certain nuclei different results have been obtained by different authors. Thus, Berendse and Groenewegen [49], who studied the cortical projections of the midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei in the rat using PHA-L as an anterograde tracer, reported that the fibres originating from the intralaminar nuclei do not terminate exclusively in the deep cortical layers (as reported by Herkenham) , but also project to lamina I.

A detailed discussion of these various projections is beyond the scope of the present work. As far as the cholinergic, GABAergic and monoaminergic projections are concerned, it may be stated that, although all of these projections innervate the entire cortex, they are not to be considered as \"diffuse and non-specific\" [538] .

These elements occur in laminae II-V, but are most prominent in lamina III. Their dendrites may be grouped in an upper and a lower tuft or spread in all directions. The axon ramifies many times and produces a dense plexus in the vicinity of the parent soma. From this axonal plexus, numerous (up to 300) vertically oriented arrays of terminals arise that contact the initial axonal segments of pyramidal cells.

However, in the neocortex, the pyramidal somata are situated at different levels and, given the laminar organization of many extrinsic and intrinsic cortical fibre systems, it is to be expected that the basal dendritic systems of different pyramidal neurons are involved in different synaptic relationships, depending on the laminae or sublaminae within which these dendritic systems occur. Thus, it has been established that the basal dendrites of pyramidal cells situated in laminae II and III receive callosal afferents [100] and that lamina III border pyramids extend their basal dendrites into lamina IV, where they are contacted by terminals of thalamocortical fibres [303, 643] . Intrinsic cortical axons, i.e. axons of local circuit neurons and collateral branches of pyramidal cells, are concentrated in lamina IV and deep in lamina V, where they form the external and internal striae of Baillarger [340, 756] . The basal dendrites of certain groups of pyramidal neurons exhibit a specific affinity to the terminal ramifications of the axons within these striae. In the primate primary visual cortex, the external stria of Baillarger (also known there as the line of Gennari) is strongly developed and occupies a discrete sublayer IVB, in which no thalamic afferents are present ( Fig.  15 .26). According to Valverde [755] , its axonal components include horizontal collaterals of descending axons of pyramidal and stellate cells of sublayer IVA, horizontal branches of axons of neurons located within sublayer IVB and ascending ramifications of spiny stellate cells residing in sublayer IVC. Lund [422] reported that the basal dendrites of pyramidal neurons situated in sublayer IVA turn sharply downward from the soma to enter sublayer IVB, where they fan out horizontally, markedly avoiding any ramifications within lamina IVA ( Fig. 15 .32E). To the author's knowledge, the question of which neurons contribute axons or axonal branches to the internal stria of Baillarger has never been specifically addressed; however, the Golgi studies by Cajal [84] and Valverde [755, 756] suggest that the axons of both superficial and deep pyramids issue numerous horizontally oriented collaterals into this stria and that certain local circuit neurons with ascending axons, situated in lamina VI, also contribute collaterals to it. In the primate motor and visual cortices, basal dendrites of pyramidal cells form a conspicuous plexus within the domain of the internal stria. In both of these cortices, large pyramidal neurons occur, known in the motor cortex as Betz cells and in the visual cortex as Meynert cells ( Fig. 15 .28 (4, 6) . Beyond their extraordinary size, these neurons have several other features in common. Both cells are characterized by the presence of long horizontally oriented basal dendrites that extend into the internal stria, and both further contribute to this stria with additional horizontal dendrites emanating from the lateral surface of the soma and even from the proximal stem of the apical dendrite [63, 64, 84, 654, 657] .

These vertical axonal elements, which play a prominent role in the so-called radial coupling of neuronal elements and hence in the columnar functional organization of the cortex, may be categorized as follows: The recurrent ascending axons or axonal branches of pyramidal neurons, as well as the ascending and descending axons of spiny stellate cells, have been observed to assemble in highly characteristic, radially oriented bundles [177, 423, 755, 756] . Turning now to the apical dendritic shafts of the typical pyramidal cells, it is important to note that these conspicuous processes are well placed to receive input from a variety of axonal pathways known to terminate within specific cortical layers. There is considerable variation in apical shaft length, ranging from essentially no shaft at all (pyramidal cells in the superficial zone of lamina II) to apical dendrites of 2 mm or more (pyramidal cells in lamina VI). Moreover, particularly in primates, the apical dendrites of many deep pyramidal cells do not extend into the subpial cortical zone, but rather terminate in a variably developed terminal tuft deeper within the cortex. Given these variations in length and in position of their apical dendrites, it is evident that different pyramidal cells may receive different samples of lamina-specific extracortical and intracortical afferents, and these differences are still further accentuated by the fact that the apical dendrites of different pyramidal neurons may exhibit different specific affinities to particular afferent systems. The evidence for such specific affinities includes (1) the presence of distinct, lamina-specific differences in the density of spines along the apical dendrites, (2) the presence of lamina-specific side branches on the apical dendrites and (3) direct proof that apical dendritic segments of different pyramidal cells passing through a particular layer The apical dendrites of the elements A-C issue their side branches and terminal tufts in particular (sub)layers; the density of spines along these processes show distinct lamina-specific differences. The elements D-F, which are situated at different levels, contribute axon collaterals to particular levels. G shows two pyramidal neurons, whose apical dendrites receive multiple asymmetrical synapses (open circles) from the axons of a bipolar cell. G also shows that smooth or sparsely spiny, non-pyramidal cells (ss) form symmetrical synapses (filled circles) with pyramidal (py) and bipolar cells (b) and that thalamic afferents (th) contact pyramidal, bipolar and smooth or sparsely spiny, non-pyramidal cells forming asymmetrical synapses (A-C are redrawn from Lund [423] ; D-F are redrawn from Lund and Boothe [426] ; G is based on Peters [554] ) may receive highly different numbers of synapses from the afferents concentrated in that layer.

The presence of distinct, lamina-specific differences in the density of spines along the apical dendrites. Spines are present in abundance on the dendrites of pyramidal neurons, where they function as the primary postsynaptic structures of the cell [178] . Quantitative analyses have shown that these spines are not evenly distributed along the dendrites. Characteristically, the most proximal portions of the dendrites emanating from the pyramidal somata are devoid of spines. From these initial segments onward, the concentration of spines increases gradually, attains a maximum some 80 lm away from the soma and then declines again distally [240, 561, 753] . Superimposed over this general pattern of spine distribution, the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons may display distinct, lamina-specific changes in spine density. For example, Lund [422] found that in the primary visual cortex of the monkey, the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells lying in laminae V and VI show markedly fewer spines in lamina IVCb than in the densely spiny portion of the same shafts in laminae V and VI. The number of spines on these apical dendrites in general increases again in laminae above IVCa, but not to the level shown on the proximal portion of the shaft ( Fig. 15 .32A,B). According to Lund [422] , this reduction in spines on the apical dendritic shaft as it passes through laminae IVCb is true of the great majority of the pyramidal cells of laminae V and VI, including the giant pyramidal cells of Meynert. It is known that lamina IVCb receives afferents specifically from the parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus.

However, systematic studies of large numbers of apical dendrites have shown that in several cortical areas these processes are given off at selective levels, i.e. as they pass through particular layers. Thus, Lorente de N\u00f3 [415] observed that, in the entorhinal cortex, the ascending shafts of the pyramids of the deeper laminae always issue some side branches in lamina III, but give off none at all during their passage through lamina II. Lund and Boothe [426] observed that the apical dendrites of a particular population of lamina VI pyramidal neurons in the primate visual cortex issue side branches selectively in lamina IVCa, whereas the apical dendrites of another lamina VI pyramidal population in this cortex give off side branches at the border of lamina V and IVCb and split up into their terminal dendritic tufts in lamina IVA ( Fig. 15. 32 B, C).

This raises the question of the extent to which projections to particular targets of cortical efferent neurons are made up by collaterals of axons projecting to other centres. In this context, it may be recalled that Cajal [84] noted in his Golgi studies of the brains of rodents that numerous subcortical centres are supplied by collaterals of corticofugal fibres. Thus, he observed that, during their descent through the internal capsule, such corticofugal fibres issued numerous collaterals to the striatum or thalamus and that pyramidal tract neurons in the brain stem gave off collateral branches to several centres, including the red nucleus, the pontine nuclei, and the dorsal column nuclei. Double-labelling experiments, i.e. experiments in which two different and distinctive retrogradely transported labels are injected into two different known terminal fields, have revealed that double-projecting neurons do occur in the neocortex. Catsman-Berrevoets and Kuypers [93] reported the presence of double-labelled cells in the motor cortex of the monkey after injecting markers into the magnocellular part of the red nucleus and spinal cord, and Rustioni and Hayes [644] found double-labelled cells in the sensory cortex of the cat after injecting markers into the dorsal column nuclei and spinal cord. However, in these and other comparable experiments, the number of double-labelled cells appeared to be very small, implying that the degree of subcortical collateralization of corticofugal fibres is limited, too [337] .

Based on White [815] The axons of all typical pyramidal neurons release a number of collaterals before entering the subgriseal white matter ( Fig. 15.30 A) . These collaterals may ramify within close proximity in the parent cell body or may descend, ascend or travel for shorter or longer horizontal distances within the cortex. Early studies of the intracortical distribution of pyramidal cell axon collaterals were based exclusively on the study of Golgi material, but the real extent of these processes has only recently been revealed by experimental studies in which single pyramidal cells were intracellularly injected with HRP, or in which small extracellular injections of tracer substances, such as biocytin or biotinylated dextran amine (BDA), are placed in the trajectory of fibres or collaterals. Given the numerical preponderance of pyramidal neurons, there can be no doubt that the intracortical collateral branches of these neurons together constitute the largest single category of axons in the neocortex. The endings of these collateral branches, like those of the main axons, all make synapses of the asymmetrical/round vesicle variety and use the excitatory amino acids glutamate and aspartate as neurotransmitters.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 487, "end": 491, "text": "[84]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 1239, "end": 1243, "text": "[93]", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 1436, "end": 1441, "text": "[644]", "ref_id": "BIBREF559"}, {"start": 1786, "end": 1791, "text": "[337]", "ref_id": "BIBREF252"}, {"start": 1846, "end": 1850, "text": "[84]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 2306, "end": 2311, "text": "[815]", "ref_id": "BIBREF730"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2433, "end": 2446, "text": "Fig. 15.30 A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}], "section": "Ascending axons from multipolar or bitufted neurons situated in deeper cortical layers."}, {"text": "The local axon collaterals of pyramidal neurons may show quite characteristic distribution patterns.

Because of the overall vertical orientation of the individual secondary branches, these clusters often have a column-like appearance. Secondary branches arising from different major collaterals of the same parent axon in different layers often converge upon the same cluster [138, 370, 515] ; the same holds true for the focussed terminal branches of major collaterals of different pyramidal cells [138] . Rockland and Knutson [622] observed that the axons of Meynert cells, i.e. large pyramidal elements in the infragranular layers of the primary visual cortex, issue a number of coarse, remarkably long (up to 8.0 mm) collateral branches, which pass horizontally through the VIth layer of that cortical area.

[409] recently investigated how Meynert cell collaterals are mapped in relation to the functional architecture of the primary visual area in macaque monkeys. They found that such collaterals may cross over several pairs of ocular dominance columns and contact both left-and right-eye ocular dominance columns. According to Li et al. [409] , these findings suggest hat the system of Meynert intrinsic collaterals is involved with binocular interactions over wide sectors of the visual field.

Rockel et al. [620] counted the number of neuronal cell bodies in a narrow strip (30 lm) through the depth of the neocortex in several functional areas (motor, somatosensory, primary visual, frontal, parietal and temporal) and in many species (mouse, rat, cat, monkey and human). With the exception of the primary visual cortex in primates the same absolute number (about 110) of neurons was found in all areas and in all species. In the primate primary visual cortex there appeared to be approximately 2.5 times more neurons. According to Rockel et al.

Because excitatory (grossly: pyramidal) neurons are by far more numerous than inhibitory (grossly: non-pyramidal) neurons and because the intracortical axon terminal-and collateral systems of most of the former are vastly more extensive than those of the latter, the excitatory synapses may be expected to outnumber the inhibitory synapses.

These authors found that in neocortical areas as different as the hindlimb area of the rat somatosensory cortex and the human anterolateral temporal cortex, symmetrical synapses formed 10.7% and 11.5% of the total synapse population, respectively. However, in our diagram there are 76 excitatory and 82 inhibitory synapses. More specifically, about 10% of the excitatory synapses (7 out of 76) is formed by terminals of cortico-cortical fibres.

By providing a low-resistance reciprocal pathway for ions and small organic molecules, such electrical connections permit the direct transmission of electrical signals between neurons [107, 223, 693] . Gap junctions have been observed between smooth neurons in electronmicroscopic studies of the primate neocortex [688, 689] . Electrophysiological studies on slices of rat neocortex established the existence of a network of electrically coupled inhibitory interneurons [222] . These interneurons, which were functionally characterized as fast-spiking cells, could be identified as PV-expressing basket cells [729] . Fukuda et al. [214] found that large PV-containing cells in layer II/ III of the cat visual cortex form about 60 gap junctions with other cells. Most, though not all of these junctions were between proximal dendrite sites. Further studies revealed that other types of neocortical inhibitory interneurons, designated as low-threshold-spiking [235], multipolar bursting [54] and late-spiking cells [99] also form type-specific, electrically coupled networks. The same holds true for neurogliaform cells [683] . However, the network formed by the latter cells appeared to be not strictly type-specific.

The thalamocortical fibres form excitatory synapses (e) with pyramidal and basket cells. The axons of the basket cells make inhibitory contacts with the somata of the pyramidal cells. When the basket cells are triggered by their thalamocortical afferents, they will exert a strong feed-forward inhibition on the pyramidal cells. The axons of the pyramidal neurons leave the cortex. These processes are provided with collateral branches, which establish excitatory synaptic contacts with other, related pyramidal neurons (not shown) and with the inhibitory interneurons (i.e. the basket cells) from which they receive input. The pyramidal axon collaterals and the basket cells form pathways for feed-back inhibition. The neuromodulatory system selectively addresses the set of inhibitory interneurons (Ba) with which they make some synaptic (s) and numerous non-synaptic (ns) contacts. This system may exert an excitatory or an inhibitory influence, depending on the neurotransmitter used by its afferent fibres and/or by the receptors expressed by their target neurons. The interneurons are interconnected by excitatory, reciprocal electrical synapses (el) as well as by inhibitory chemical synapses (ch). Moreover, the axons of the interneurons (Ba) emit collateral branches that form numerous autaptic contacts (au) with their own soma and proximal dendrites and bitufted cells.

Each of these columns appeared to be separated from its neighbours by a gap of approximately 500 lm. Each column was considered to represent the terminals of a bundle of cortico-cortical axons emanating from cells at the centre of each of the loci in which the tracer was injected. Using a retrograde tracer, Jones et al.

Goldman and Nauta [242] injected an anterograde tracer into three cytoarchitectonically distinct regions (areas 4, 9 and 12) of the frontal lobe of rhesus monkeys. Neurons in these various regions are known to project both contralaterally and ipsilaterally to cytoarchitectonically diverse areas within the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes.

Goldman-Rakic and Schwartz [246] also investigated the spatial organization of the populations of cells in the prefrontal cortex projecting to the parietal associational cortex and to the contralateral prefrontal cortex using HRP or fluorescent dyes as retrograde tracers. They demonstrated that these two populations are inversely related in their relative densities over portions of the prefrontal cortex examined. Moreover, in the HRP material, the high-density patches of retrogradely labelled neurons appeared to coincide with the afferent fibre columns revealed by anterograde transport. In a later study (Selemon and Goldman-Rakic [669] ), terminal labelling originating from prefrontal and parietal injections in the same hemisphere was investigated in a large number of areas of convergence in both the ipsilateral and the contralateral hemisphere. In most of the target areas, prefrontal and parietal terminal fields formed an array of interdigitating columns, but in some other areas prefrontal and parietal projections converged on the same column or cluster of adjacent columns but terminated within different laminae.

The postmitotic cells produced by these proliferative units find their way to the primordial cortex by following the shafts of elongated, radially oriented glial cells, which stretch across the embryonic pallial wall. Eventually, all postmitotic cells generated in a single proliferative unit form a morphologically identifiable stack of neurons in the cortex. These entities, which may be designated as \"ontogenetic\" or \"embryonic\" columns, form, according to Rakic, the fundamental building blocks in the developing neocortex [608] . Each proliferative unit is supposed to produce multiple neuronal phenotypes. Rakic [608] advanced the idea that the proliferative units in the matrix zone of the embryonic pallium constitute a proto-map of prospective cytoarchitectonic areas. Each of these areas is composed of a large number of ontogenetic columns, which become the basic processing units in the cerebral cortex. According to Rakic [608] , the relatively constant size of these units in different mammalian species suggests that, during evolution, the cortex has expanded by the addition of such radial units rather than by their enlargement.

According to the original concept of Lorente de N\u00f3 [416] , the neocortex is built up of cylindrically shaped units, composed of vertical arrays of interconnected neurons that in-clude all cortical layers. He designated these units as \"elementary units of cortical operation\", because he believed that within them \"the whole process of the transmission of impulses from the afferent fibre to the efferent axon may be accomplished\". Lorente de N\u00f3 did not specify the pattern of connectivity within these units, but during the last decades, several attempts have been made to characterize the basic neocortical microcircuit (see Fig.  15 .44) [136, 157, 679] . However, in none of these attempts has the question been specifically addressed as to whether the elements involved in these microcircuits are confined to small, cylindrically shaped spaces. The pyramidal cell modules described by Peters and Sethares ( Fig. 15 .42) [565] [566] [567] 4) . In addition, there is feed-forward excitation (AFF3) through spiny stellate cells. The axons of the P cells have collaterals (ac) that recurrently and laterally excite the P cells (ac1,2) as well as inhibitory cells (ac3) that provide for feed-back and lateral inhibition. B Canonical neocortical circuit, based on the studies of Douglas et al. [157] , as represented by Shepherd [679] . P1 and P2 represent the superficial and deep populations of (excitatory) pyramidal cells. Element I represents the population of inhibitory, GABAergic neurons. Neurons within each population form connections with other members of that population. All three populations receive direct activation from the thalamus, but because the thalamic input provides only about 10% of the excitatory input, 90% of the excitation stems from intracortical connections between P cells. The excitation of nearby P cells is provided by axon collaterals of these elements. These axon collaterals also excite the interneuron-pool to provide feed-back and lateral inhibition. Modified from Shepherd [679] . C Skeleton of the basic neocortical microcircuit, according to DeFelipe [136] . The diagram shows the synaptic inputs and main patterns of local connections of the pyramidal cell. Excitatory inputs to this element arrive exclusively to its dendritic arbor and originate from extrinsic afferent systems and spiny cells (which include other pyramidal neurons and spiny stellate cells). Inhibitory inputs, which originate from GABAergic interneurons, terminate on the proximal dendrites, soma and axon initial segment. These interneurons are interconnected between one another, with the exception of the axo-axonic chandelier cells. Reproduced from DeFelipe [136] double bouquet cells conform to the modules (Fig. 15.42 B) but that their axons most probably do not exclusively contact the dendrites belonging to the pyramidal cells situated within \"their own\" module. As regards (d), the cortical afferents are not of an appropriate size to match an individual pyramidal cell module. The various column-like cortical entities have been distinguished on the basis of highly different morphological and/or physiological properties, e.g. similarity in physiological response properties, similarity in motor responses following stimulation, spatial segregation of sets of thalamocortical afferents, high concentrations of the enzyme cytochrome oxidase, concentrations of spiny stellate cells in lamina IV and the mode of termination of bundles of cortico-cortical fibres. It is unlikely that all of these entities are derivatives of one and the same basic cortical module, especially as they may differ considerably in size. It cannot be excluded that, as Szent\u00e1gothai [722] surmised, the units defined by cortico-cortical afferents represent the \"true cortical columns\".

In all cortices, the pyramidal neurons are excitatory in nature and potentially constitute a continuous network extending throughout the cortex. Nearby connections in this network are provided by axon collaterals of pyramidal neurons, whereas longer intracortical connections consist of the main axons or axonal branches of more remote pyramidal neurons. In the neocortex, each pyramidal neuron receives by far its largest input from other pyramidal neurons. 3. Pyramidal neurons constitute the output system of all of these cortices. 4. In all cortices, the most superficial layer contains numerous tangentially running afferent fibres, making excitatory synaptic contacts with the apical dendritic extensions of pyramidal neurons. The sources of these fibres include the olfactory bulb, the thalamus and other cortical regions. The fibre composition of the superficial layer varies from region to region. Thus, in the prepiriform cortex, secondary olfactory fibres occupy a superficial position, whereas corticocortical fibres form a deeper zone. In the sensory part of the neocortex of primitive mammals, numerous thalamocortical fibres reach lamina I, but in the hippocampus and in neocortical association area, cortico-cortical fibres prevail in this layer. In lamina I of all cortices, fibres from different sources tend to be arranged in different sublaminae. 5. In neocortical sensory regions, thalamic afferents terminate massively in lamina IV. In the primary visual cortex of prosimians and primates, different laminae of the lateral geniculate nucleus project to different sublayers of lamina IV. 6. Inhibitory interneurons, using GABA as their neurotransmitter, occur in all cortices. All inhibitory interneurons in all cortices impinge directly with some or all of their terminals on pyramidal neurons. In all cortices, separate sets of inhibitory interneurons terminate mainly or exclusively on one of the three receptive domains of the pyramidal cells, i.e. the dendritic compartment, the soma and the axon initial segment.

However, it should be noted that Brodmann in his book repeatedly emphasizes that identical numbers do not indicate absolute homologies on the brain maps. In discussing the map of Cercopithecus, he indicates that area 7 of this species should be considered as an undifferentiated primordium of all human parietal areas, except for area 5, which is clearly distinguishable in both species. In line with this, Petrides and Pandya [579] interpreted the anterior and posterior parts of the inferior parietal lobule of the rhesus monkey (their areas PF and PG) as homologous to the human supramarginal and angular gyri, respectively.

As discussed in the previous section, the cytoarchitectonic areas just enumerated constitute, together with the caudal orbitofrontal cortex (areas 12, 13, 14 and caudal part of area 11), the anterior insula and the temporopolar cortex (area 38), the paralimbic belt ( Fig. 15.55) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 37, "end": 41, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 224, "end": 229, "text": "[796]", "ref_id": "BIBREF711"}, {"start": 273, "end": 276, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 277, "end": 279, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 562, "end": 576, "text": "26, 29 and 30)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 781, "end": 786, "text": "[796]", "ref_id": "BIBREF711"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 209, "end": 221, "text": "(Fig. 1.4 B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF25"}, {"start": 1242, "end": 1253, "text": "Fig. 15.55)", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}], "section": "Limbic Lobe and Paralimbic Belt"}, {"text": "The intrinsic [55, 96, 152, 324, 377, 397, 439, 479, 482, 717, 772, 782, 843] and extrinsic connections of the various (para)limbic cortical structures [96, 152, 323, 324, 346, 377, 380, 397, 441, 480, 527, 579, 639, 716, 772, 782, 843] have been extensively studied in the rhesus monkey.

The efferent pyramidal neurons in the primary motor cortex were collectively designated as the \"upper motoneuron\" or \"final common pathway\" for the central control of movements, impinging either directly or indirectly (i.e. via interneurons) on the \"lower motoneurons\" in the brain stem and spinal cord. Projections from other motor-related areas, converging upon the primary motor cortex, were thought to represent a hierarchical level superimposed on that of the \"upper motoneuronal system\". Recent experimental neuroanatomical studies, mainly in rhesus monkeys, have shown that the organization of the central motor system is much more complex than indicated by the hierarchical model just sketched. It has been shown that the motor part of the pyramidal tract, i.e. the \"upper motoneuronal system\", does not originate exclusively from the primary motor cortex. Rather, this fibre system has appeared to originate from many of the non-primary motor areas discussed above, including the PMVc and PMDc [162, 282] , the SMA [163, 283] and the CMAr and CMAc [162, 163, 283] . Consequently, all of these areas have the potential to influence the generation and control of movements independently of the primary motor cortex. All of the areas giving rise to pyramidal tract fibres also project to the primary motor cortex [131, 431, 475, 480, 682, 711] . Thus, they influence motor activity through at least two pathways, corticospinal projections and corticocortical projections to the primary motor cortex.

They are typified by their projections to the spinal cord, to F1 and to each other. The rostral areas F6 and F7 form the second class. These areas do not project to the spinal cord, but their descending output terminates in various part of the brain stem. Furthermore, these areas are not directly connected with F1. According to Matelli et al. [445] , the two classes also differ with respect to the sources of their principal \"extrinsic\" cortical inputs. The areas forming the caudal group receive a primary cortical input from the parietal lobe; therefore, they may be characterized as parieto-dependent motor areas. The rostral areas, on the other hand, receive their primary cortical input from the prefrontal cortex and may, hence, be characterized as prefronto-dependent motor areas. The areas forming the caudal group collectively correspond to Mesulam's [463] motor association area (Fig. 15.15 ). As regards the relationship with the parietal lobe, we have seen that this lobe contains a number of centres in which sensory information from various sources is processed, and that each of these centres is specifically and reciprocally connected with a particular frontal motor area. The various parietal centres and their frontal targets form functional circuits, each of which is dedicated to a particular aspect of sensory-motor transformation [445, 828, 847] .

There is evidence that the cortical domains dedicated to language are compartmentalized into separate systems for processing different aspects of language. Ojemann [514] cites lesion studies indicating the presence of separate areas for handling different languages, for handling different grammatical classes of words or for the naming of specific semantic categories, such as \"animals\" or \"tools\". Functional neuroimaging research, summarized by Bookheimer [58] , has shown that within the left inferior frontal lobe separate subsystems are responsible for different aspects of language. It appeared that a rostroventral area, corresponding to Brodmann's areas (BAs) 47 and 45, contributes to semantic processing; an intermediate area, corresponding to BAs 45 and 44, has a role in syntactic processing; whereas a dorsocaudal area including parts of BAs 44 and 6 are involved in phonological processing. Similar subsystems, subserving partic-ular specialized language-related functions have also been reported for Wernicke's region [827] and for both Broca's and Wernicke's regions [300] . 5 . The data reviewed indicate that the neural network involved in the comprehension and production of language is much more extensive than was originally envisioned. However, the precise wiring of this network remains to be established. The marked functional specialization detected within language-processing areas suggests that several parallel, though interrelated subnetworks are present. The language-related (sub)networks do not function in isolation. Neuroimaging studies, cited by Bookheimer [58] and Hagoort [276] , have reported increased activity in Broca's region during various nonlinguistic tasks. Mesulam [464] indicates that many cortical nodes participate in the function of more than one cognitive network. Finally, it should be mentioned that the circuitry related to language functions is presumably not confined to the neocortex.

Thus, the caudobasal part of the prefrontal cortex is dysgranular rather than granular, and studies with modern tracing techniques in the rhesus monkey have shown that most prefrontal areas that receive MD input are also connected to other thalamic nuclei, and that, conversely, the MD projections do not pass exclusively to the prefrontal cortex [592, 749] .

This mechanism allows us to selectively process the information relevant to current goals. A combination of the results of neuroimaging studies in humans with data derived from tract-tracing studies in monkeys suggests that, apart from the LPFC, the visual attentional control system involves several way stations in the dorsal and ventral visual processing streams (Fig. 15.67) [552, 553] .

Classic experiments on monkeys and chimpanzees in the 1930s [327, 328] have shown that, following bilateral lesions of the LPFC, the animals were still fully able to perform auditory or visual discrimination tasks or recall spatial orientation of objects, providing tests were made in immediate memory. However, the animals appeared to be unable to perform such tasks if a delay of more than a few seconds was introduced between the stimulus and the response. The relation between this temporal integrative function and the LPFC has been substantiated electrophysiologically [215, 217] . Cells in the LPFC of the monkey were found to fire persistently at high rates while the animals retained an item of visual information in short-term memory.

Electrical or chemical stimulation of its lateral column evokes co-ordinated response strategies, such as threat display, fight or flight, accompanied by hypertension, tachycardia and a shift in blood from the viscera to the limb muscles. In contrast, stimulation of the ventrolateral PAG column elicits quiescence (\"freezing\") and decreasing of blood pressure and heart rate. Retrograde and anterograde tracing experiments in rhesus monkeys [9] have shown that the medial prefrontal areas 24, 25 and 32 and the orbital areas 13 a, 27/12 l and Iai project to the PAG and that projections from distinct cortical areas terminate primarily in individual PAG columns. The projections from areas 25 and 32 terminate primarily in the dorsolateral columns, bilaterally. Fibres from area 24 predominantly end in the lateral column, whereas fibres from orbital areas 13 a, 47/12 l and Iai terminate mainly in the ventrolateral columns. It seems likely that the OMPFC, by way of these projections, influences the integrated behavioural and autonomic responses mediated by the lateral and ventrolateral PAG columns. The functional significance of the cortical input to the dorsolateral column is not known.
