The adenoviral genome is well characterized and comparatively easy to manipulate. Adenoviruses exhibit broad tropism, infecting a variety of dividing and non-dividing cells. The immunogenicity profile of adenoviral vectors is illustrated by data obtained following the immunization of adults with Ad26-vectored human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccines (Ad26.ENVA.01, Ad26.Mos.HIV and Ad26.Mos4.HIV), an Ad26-vectored Ebola virus vaccine (Ad26.ZEBOV), Ad26-vectored respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines (Ad26.RSV.FA2 and Ad26.RSV.preF), an Ad26-vectored Zika virus vaccine (Ad26.ZIKV.001) and an Ad26-vectored malaria vaccine (Ad26.CS.01). Antigen-specific antibody responses are observed in almost all participants after one dose, in both na\u00efve and pre-immune individuals (RSV). These antibodies may persist for a year or more (RSV) after a single dose in pre-immune participants. They have functional properties of neutralization (RSV, Zika), Fc-mediated antibody-dependent cellmediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP) (HIV, Malaria). Furthermore, these data support an immunogenicity profile with emphasis on T-helper (Th)1 responses and demonstrate predominantly interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) production in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. 4, 25, 35 ",

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the outbreak constituted a public health emergency of international concern CONFIDENTIAL -FOIA Exemptions Apply in U.S. 42 Status: Approved for Dossier Use, Date: 20 April 2020 on January 30, 2020, and declared the outbreak to be a pandemic on March 11, 2020. 43,44 As of April 19, 2020, approximately 2,347,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported. 26 Symptoms of infection may appear from 2 to 14 days following exposure, with the clinical manifestations ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness or death. 8 Severe clinical presentations have been reported in as many as 20-25% of laboratory-confirmed cases. 18 In a study of 99 patients in a single center in Wuhan with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the most commonly reported clinical manifestations were fever (83%), cough (82%), shortness of breath (31%), and muscle aches (11%). 11 In chest x-rays and computed tomographic (CT) scans, 75% of patients showed bilateral pneumonia and 14% of patients showed diffuse mottling and ground-glass opacities. In a further study of 138 patients with novel coronavirus-induced pneumonia in a single center in Wuhan, common symptoms included fever (98.6%), fatigue (69.6%), and dry c ough (59.4%). 40 Lymphopenia occurred in 70.3% of patients, and chest CT scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground-glass opacities in the lungs of all patients. Thirty-six patients (26%) were transferred to the intensive care unit because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, arrhythmia, and shock. At present, it appears that individuals aged 65 years or older, especially those with comorbid diseases, are subject to the highest incidence of morbidity and mortality. 9 In contrast, a study of 2,143 children aged <18 years in China with laboratory-confirmed (34.1%) or suspected (65.9%) COVID-19 indicated that the clinical manifestations of the disease may be less severe in children than adults, with approximately 94% of cases being asymptomatic, mild, or moderate. 17 However, young children, particularly infants, were susceptible to severe disease, with the highest proportion of severe and critical cases by age group reported for children aged <1 year (10.6% of cases in this age group).",

If an investigator wishes to publish information from the study, a copy of the manuscript must be provided to the sponsor for review at least 60 days before submission for publication or presentation. Expedited reviews will be arranged for abstracts, poster presentations, or other materials. If requested by the sponsor in writing, the investigator will withhold such publication for up to an additional 60 days to allow for filing of a patent application. In the event that issues arise regarding scientific integrity or regulatory compliance, the sponsor will review these issues with the investigator. The sponsor will not mandate modifications to scientific content and does not have the right to suppress information. For multicenter study designs and sub-study approaches, secondary results generally should not be published before the primary endpoints of a study have been published. Similarly, investigators will recognize the integrity of a multicenter study by not submitting for publication data derived from the individual study site until the combined results from the completed study have been submitted for publication, within 18 months after the study end date, or the sponsor confirms there will be no multicenter study publication. Authorship of publications resulting from this study will be based on the guidelines on authorship, such as those described in the ICMJE Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals, which state that the named authors must have made a significant contribution to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of the data for the work; and drafted the CONFIDENTIAL -FOIA Exemptions Apply in U.S. 101 Status: Approved for Dossier Use, Date: 20 April 2020 work or revised it critically for important intellectual content; and given final approval of the version to be published; and agreed to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.",

            "text": "Recombinant, replication-incompetent adenoviral vectors are attractive candidates for expression of foreign genes for a number of reasons. The adenoviral genome is well characterized and comparatively easy to manipulate. Adenoviruses exhibit broad tropism, infecting a variety of dividing and non-dividing cells. The adenoviral vaccine (AdVac \u00ae ) vector platform, developed by Crucell Holland B.V. (now Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V.) allows for high-yield production of replication-incompetent adenovirus vectors, eg, Ad26, with desired inserts. The adenovirus E1 region is deleted to render the vector replication-incompetent and create space for transgenes, with viral replication taking place in cells that complement for the E1 deletion in the virus genome. Ad26 has been selected as a potential vaccine vector because there is substantial nonclinical and clinical experience with Ad26-based vaccines that demonstrate their capacity to elicit strong humoral and cellular immune responses and their acceptable safety profile, irrespective of the antigen transgene (see also Section 2.3.1, Risks Related to Study Participation). The immunogenicity profile of adenoviral vectors is illustrated by data obtained following the immunization of adults with Ad26-vectored human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccines (Ad26.ENVA.01, Ad26.Mos.HIV, and Ad26.Mos4.HIV), an Ad26-vectored Ebola virus vaccine (Ad26.ZEBOV), Ad26-vectored respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines (Ad26.RSV.FA2 and Ad26.RSV.preF), an Ad26-vectored Zika virus vaccine (Ad26.ZIKV.001), and an Ad26-vectored malaria vaccine (Ad26.CS.01). Antigen-specific antibody responses are observed in almost all participants after one dose, in both na\u00efve and pre-immune individuals (RSV). These antibodies may persist for a year or more (RSV) after a single dose in pre-immune participants. They have functional properties of neutralization (RSV, Zika), Fc-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) (HIV, Malaria). Furthermore, these data support an immunogenicity profile with emphasis on T-helper (Th)1 responses and demonstrate predominantly interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) production in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. 4, 28, 38 ",

The initial effort will be to rapidly demonstrate safety and immunogenicity in adults aged \u226455 years, in order to initiate an efficacy trial in this age group as soon as possible, and to evaluate safety and immunogenicity in older adults aged \u226565 years. The candidate vaccine to be assessed in this study is Ad26.COV2.S, which is a recombinant, replication-incompetent Ad26 encoding a stabilized variant of the SARS-Cov-2 S protein. The parental S protein sequence was derived from a SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate (Wuhan, 2019, whole genome sequence NC_045512). The selection of antigen was based on previous work on the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV candidate vaccines. 14, 21, 39 The protein is the major surface protein on coronaviruses and is responsible for binding to the host cell receptor and mediating the fusion of host and viral membranes, thereby facilitating virus entry into the cell. 52",

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the outbreak constituted a public health emergency of international concern CONFIDENTIAL -FOIA Exemptions Apply in U.S. 48 Status: Approved, Date: 19 September 2020 on January 30, 2020, and declared the outbreak to be a pandemic on March 11, 2020. 46,47 As of April 29, 2020, approximately 3,170,000 cases of COVID-19 had been reported. 29 Symptoms of infection may appear from 2 to 14 days following exposure, with the clinical manifestations ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness or death. 9 Severe clinical presentations have been reported in as many as 20-25% of laboratory-confirmed cases. 20 In a study of 99 patients in a single center in Wuhan with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the most commonly reported clinical manifestations were fever (83%), cough (82%), shortness of breath (31%), and muscle aches (11%). 13 In chest x-rays and computed tomographic (CT) scans, 75% of patients showed bilateral pneumonia and 14% of patients showed diffuse mottling and ground-glass opacities. In a further study of 138 patients with novel coronavirus-induced pneumonia in a single center in Wuhan, common symptoms included fever (98.6%), fatigue (69.6%), and dry c ough (59.4%). 43 Lymphopenia occurred in 70.3% of patients, and chest CT scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground-glass opacities in the lungs of all patients.

Consistent with these findings was a study of 149,082 COVID-19 cases reported in the US. 11 Although persons aged <18 years account for 22% of the US population, only 1.7% of these cases occurred in this age group. Furthermore, relatively few pediatric COVID-19 cases were hospitalized indicating that COVID-19 might have a mild course among younger patients. Hospitalization was most common among pediatric patients aged <1 year and those with underlying conditions. The identification of SARS-CoV-2 follows the emergence of 2 other novel betacoronaviruses capable of causing severe human disease over the past 18 years: SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which have nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2 of approximately 79% and 50%, respectively. 36 The first known cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in Southern China in November 2002. 48 The etiological agent, SARS-CoV, is believed to be an animal virus that crossed the species barrier to humans followed by human-to-human transmission, leading to SARS cases in >25 countries. The MERS-CoV was isolated from a patient in Saudi Arabia who died of severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure in June 2012. 52 MERS-CoV is considered to be a zoonotic virus capable of non-sustained human-to-human transmission. Since 2012, sporadic cases and community and health-care-associated clusters of infected individuals have been reported in the Middle East. Patients with SARS or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) present with various clinical features, ranging from asymptomatic or mild respiratory illness to fulminant severe acute respiratory disease with extrapulmonary manifestations. 12, 52 Both diseases have predominantly respiratory manifestations, but extrapulmonary features may occur in severe cases. By July 2003, the international spread of SARS-CoV resulted in 8,098 SARS cases and 774 deaths (case-fatality rate: 10%) with substantial social, economic and health service disruption in some affected countries. 12, 48 The case-fatality rate of MERS-CoV infections is estimated to be 35%. 12 Therefore, while the understanding of the epidemiology and clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is still evolving during the ongoing pandemic, the current knowledge of the disease burden highlights the urgent medical need for a prophylactic vaccine.",

At the time of protocol Amendment 6 writing, the initial immunogenicity and safety data (28 days post-Dose 1 data from Cohort 1a and available data from Cohort 3) from study VAC31518COV1001 have demonstrated that a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S at 5\u00d710 10 vp and 1\u00d710 11 vp induces an immune response that meets prespecified minimum criteria and is safe.

These data show predominantly IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 production in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. 3, 4, 5 In the RSV vaccine clinical development program, Ad26.RSV.preF is being evaluated in healthy RSVseropositive toddlers aged 12 to 24 months (Phase 1/2a study VAC18194RSV2001). Safety data from the primary analysis at 28 days after the second study vaccination revealed no safety concerns following Ad26.RSV.preF dosing at 5\u00d710 10 vp or a placebo. The immunogenicity of a single immunization with Ad26.RSV.preF in RSV-seropositive toddlers aged 12 to 24 months, including favorable Th1 bias, was confirmed. In a further study of Ad26.RSV.preF in RSV-seronegative toddlers aged 12 to 24 months (Phase 1/2a study VAC18194RSV2002), initial safety data have not revealed concerns after Ad26.RSV.preF dosing.",
