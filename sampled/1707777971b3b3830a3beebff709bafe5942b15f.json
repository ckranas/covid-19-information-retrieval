Left atrial (LA) chamber dilation and congestive heart failure (CHF) are common consequences of cardiac conditions in cats. In some cases CHF is manifest as right-sided CHF (R-CHF) or pleural effusion, in other cases CHF manifests as left-sided CHF (L-CHF) or pulmonary edema. It is not always readily apparent as to which cats will develop what form of CHF. A general impression has been that LA enlargement is associated with the average burden of elevated filling pressures, but little attention has been paid to the function of the LA chamber itself. Since CHF is classically preceded by abnormal atrial chamber dilation and alterations in atrial chamber function, we want to understand how these changes may help us manage or predict CHF in the cat.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Observation of Patient and Surgeon Preoperative Preparation in Companion Animal"}, {"text": "We hypothesized that cats manifesting R-CHF have LA failure with the LA acting primarily as a conduit, resulting in greater pulmonary hypertension, whereas L-CHF cats maintain some booster pump and reservoir function. We measured LA maximum and minimum areas from right parasternal long axis four-chamber views on 2D echo, and LA M-mode dimensions at maximum, minimum, and beginning of atrial contraction. LA area change, fractional shortening, active emptying fraction, and expansion index were calculated from these measurements. Right ventricular internal diastolic diameter was also measured on M-mode views. Preliminary data revealed that maximum left atrial size is not significantly different between R-CHF and L-CHF cats on 2D or M-mode measurements due to high variability. However, total left atrial fractional shortening is significantly reduced in R-CHF cats (11.32% AE 4.9) compared to L-CHF cats (19.7% AE 5.1)(p 5 0.001), and R-CHF cats have reduced left atrial active emptying fraction (6.12% AE 3.5) as compared to L-CHF cats (13.7% AE 3)(p o 0.001). Left atrial expansion ability is poorer in R-CHF cats (13.11% AE 6.7) than in L-CHF cats (25.0% AE 8)(p 5 0.002). These findings may suggest that atrial stiffness and poorer atrial function is associated with a greater degree of pulmonary venous and thus secondary pulmonary arterial hypertension resulting in pleural effusion (R-CHF). Right ventricular diameter on M-mode was increased in R-CHF cats (4.8 mm AE 2.1) when compared to L-CHF cats (2.89 mm AE 0.8)(p 5 0.002) and normal cats (2.74 mm AE 0.8)(p 5 0.002), which may also be evidence for a greater degree of pulmonary arterial hypertension in these cats.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited myocardial disease with high prevalence in the boxer dog population, and is associated with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, sudden cardiac death, and replacement of myocardium with fatty or fibro-fatty tissue. Though several genes have been linked to the disease both in humans and in boxers, the etiology of ARVC is still unclear. Several mechanisms for the development of ARVC have been suggested, including dysfunction of the canonical Wnt pathway, which results in an ARVC phenotype in the mouse. The canonical Wnt pathway has been linked to many cellular functions, including growth and differentiation of adipocytes. With the recent discovery that the gene encoding striatin, a protein involved in Wnt signaling, may be involved in the development of boxer ARVC, we hypothesized that changes in the Wnt pathway may also play a role in the etiology.

Left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction is a common problem in dogs and can be due to a variety of etiologies. One potential etiology for systolic dysfunction is persistent or paroxysmal tachyarrhythmias, leading to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy (TICM).

Type 1 Polysaccharide Storage Myopathy (PSSM) in horses is associated with a dominant missense mutation (R309H) in the skeletal muscle glycogen synthase gene (GYS1).

Relative expression of the metabolic genes, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor g (PPARg), PPARg coactivator-1a (PGC-1a), fatty acid translocase (FAT) and estrogen related receptor a (ERRa) was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Mitochondrial content was assessed by determining mitochondrial DNA/nuclear DNA ratio by qPCR, using NADH-dehydrogenase subunit 2 and cytochrome oxidase subunit 2 as mitochondrial genes and beta actin as the nuclear reference gene.

Since pain assessment is vital for management of colic, a valid, reliable and feasible tool for assessing the severity of acute abdominal pain in horses is urgently needed. Our aim was to construct and validate a behavior-based pain scale by methodology utilized in construction of pain scales in non-verbal humans. The project consisted of four stages. Firstly, behaviors to include in a scale were empirically identified. Thirty equine clinicians noted behaviors in each of 23 random film clips of horses with colic using a checklist. Nine behaviors (e.g. rolling, pawing, and flank watching) demonstrated good inter-observer agreement without bias (multi-rater kappas: 0.5-0.95). Secondly, the clinical judgment of experts was utilized to identify and to weight behaviors. Six expert clinicians independently expressed opinions as to which of 46 behaviors to include and the severity of pain they indicate. Two contending scales (Equine Acute Abdominal Pain Scales (EAAPS) 1 & 2) were constructed based on both the empirical and the judgmental approaches. Each included 12 identical behaviors with a 1-5 point score range; EAAPS-2 with gradations to some of the behaviors and EAAPS-1 without. In the third stage, blood cortisol and lactate levels and heart rate were shown to only approximate pain since they correlate poorly with degree of pain as assessed by visual analog scale (VAS) in 32 horses with colic and 8 controls (Spearman rho; lactate 0.359; cortisol 0.214; heart rate 0.261). Finally, reliability and validity of the pain scales were evaluated including constructs of pain; face validity, convergent and discriminate validity and extreme groups. Thirty of 40 films of horses with colic were randomly presented to 44 expert equine clinicians internationally who were randomly allocated into three groups to score pain; one group by both VAS and numerical rating scale (NRS)), and two groups, each by one of the two EAAPS scales. Inter-observer reliability of both EAAPS scales was excellent (Intraclass Correlation 0.8). Intra-observer reliability based on scores given for identical films demonstrated; 87% and 56% agreement, kappa 0.9 and 0.35, and Spearman's rho 5 0.97 and 0.58 for EAAPS-1 and 2, respectively. Both scales varied by 1 score between observations. Face validity; each group reported their scale to be valid (67% & 81%). Convergent validity; the scales compared favorably with VAS/NRS scores (Spearman's rho: 0.84-0.89). Discriminate validity; correlation to heart rate, lactate and cortisol levels was predictably low (rho 5 0.2-0.5). Extreme group validity; colic horses scored significantly higher than control horses; scores of 0.6-0.7 in controls versus 2.6-2.7 in cases. In conclusion, methodology established in human medicine but novel in veterinary medicine was used to construct and validate two clinically feasible equine abdominal pain severity scales that showed excellent reliability and validity. Further refinement of the EAAPS scale is advised prior to introduction into clinical practice. Aortic valve prolapse (AVP) is a common echocardiographic finding in horses, but when compared with mitral valve prolapse in dogs, little is known about the natural progression of this condition. Previously published data has shown that echocardiographic identification of AVP in horses is reliable, diagnostic criteria have been established and that development occurs with training. The aims of this study were to evaluate the different RNA and protein expressions of smooth muscle actin (SMA), transforming growth factor-b 1 (TGF), nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and the concentrations of elastin and collagen in normal, prolapsing and diseased cusps to evaluate what structural changes may predispose them to prolapse. Valve cusps were harvested and processed from a group of 176 horses at a commercial abattoir following disease classification using echocardiography. Horses were aged 13.7 AE 6.7years, weighing 518 AE 51 Kg and with a median body condition score of 4/9. Cusps were collected in RNAlater s and stored at \u00c0801C prior to processing. cDNA was produced from half a valve using a standard protocoland qRT-PCR performed to assess relative RNA expression of SMA, TGFb 1 , endothelial (eNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS) and compared with the housekeeping gene 18S. A quarter of cusp was processed using an adapted commercial protocol to evaluate protein expression of SMA, TGF b 1 , eNOS and compared to vimentin. Specific antibody binding was assessed with western blotting and protein expression evaluated using dot blots. The remaining quarter cusp was used to measure soluble collagen and elastin concentrations using commercial assays 3 . Statistical analyses included one way ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferoni, paired Student's T-test, linear and logistic regression. There was no effect of gender or age on any of the measurements. Valves from animals with AVP had lower expression of SMA and Elastin compared to normal and diseased valves, increased expression of TGFb 1 and eNOS, whereas iNOS expression was greater than normal valves (Table 1) . Collagen content of valves from horses with AVP was increased compared to normal but lower than horses with valve disease. Prolapsing cusps appear to be a different phenotype from diseased cusps. Further studies will help to elucidate the significance of these findings in vivo. A clear association between heart rate (HR) and body mass has been observed across a wide range of mammalian species. Furthermore, it is well known that electrocardiographic (ECG) time intervals vary with heart rate and body mass. Within the equine species, small breeds are generally thought to have higher heart rates than large breeds. However, despite the large differences in size among different equine breeds, there is little information about normal heart rates and normal ECG time intervals in horses and ponies of different body size. Similarly, the relationship between HR and body mass in dogs of various breeds and sizes is still under debate.

Foals were divided into 3 treatment groups. Group 1 and 2 foals received firocoxib while a 3rd group was administered an oral placebo. Gastric endoscopy was performed on group 1 and 3 foals prior to treatment and on days 7 and 14 to monitor for the presence of gastric ulcers. Group 2 and 3 foals had blood and urine samples taken sequentially for pharmacokinetic analysis, CBC, serum chemistry evaluation, and urinalysis. Physical examinations were performed prior to treatment and daily for 17 days. Data were analyzed using anova and paired t-tests (P o 0.05). None of the foals presented adverse clinical effects.

Equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) is highly prevalent in most horse populations. Horses are routinely vaccinated against EHV-1, and neutralizing antibodies have helped to prevent disease. However, the USDA has recently classified EHV-1 myeloencephalopathy (EHM) as an emerging disease, in response to the apparent increase in incidence, morbidity, and mortality of EHM that suggests a change in virulence of the virus. It has been reported that cellular immune mechanisms, in particular cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs), are important in controlling EHV-1 viremia. Interferon-alpha (IFN-a) has a key function in innate immune regulation by inducing the differentiation and maturation of CTLs. Here, we investigated the influence of abortogenic (RacL11, NY03) and neuropathogenic (Ab4) EHV-1 virus strains on IFN-a, IL-4 and IL-10 secretion in equine PBMC. Equine PBMC were infected with RacL11, NY03 or Ab4 EHV-1 strains or kept in medium for 24 hours. IFN-a, IL-10 and IL-4 secretion was detected in the supernatants by a fluorescent bead-based cytokine assay. The production of IFN-a increased with increasing viral doses and similarly for all three EHV-1 strains. The production of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 was significantly decreased after Ab4 infection compared to RacL11 and NY03 strains at viral infection doses of MOI 0.3-1. At high doses (MOI 3), IL-10 production was suppressed by all three EHV-1 strains. The results suggested that abortogenic and neuropathogenic EHV-1 strains equally induce antiviral IFN-a production in equine PBMC. They also illustrated the differences in the ability of EHV-1 strains to modulate anti-inflammatory IL-10. Neuropathogenic Ab4 strain had an increased potential to down-regulate IL-10 production suggesting specific viral mechanisms that interfere with the control of inflammation in the host.

There was no significant effect of blindfolding on neither lateral nor diagonal coupling intervals. The random effect of horse had no influence on the coupling intervals. The decrease of the lateral coupling intervals indicates a tendency towards a pacing gait during head elevation.

Current results suggest that pacing and increased variation in foot-placement during head elevation should be interpreted with caution however further work is required to determine whether the change differs between horses with neurological disease and non-neurologic disease. Hereditary Equine Regional Dermal Asthenia (HERDA) is an autosomal recessive connective tissue disorder associated with a mutation in cyclophillin B that leads to impaired collagen folding, aberrant wound repair, and corneal abnormalities. It affects young Quarter Horses, Appaloosa, and Paints. HERDA shows similarities to the human hereditary connective tissue syndrome Ehlers Danlos (EDS). Many EDS patients suffer from joint pain and osteoarthritis (OA) as adults. The similarity between EDS and HERDA raises the question whether horses suffering from HERDA develop OA. In OA, excess production of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE 2 ) activate enzymes that degrade cartilage as well as impede wound healing. The present study examined articular cartilage from yearling horses afflicted with HERDA. We hypothesized that chondrocytes from these horses are continually activated to produce inflammatory mediators. To test this hypothesis, articular cartilage from carpal and tarsal joints of HERDA horses were evaluated using histology.

Pneumonia is observed in horses after long distance transportation in association with confinement of horses' head position leading to a reduction in tracheal mucociliary clearance time (TMCT). We hypothesize that clenbuterol, a beta-2 agonist shown to increase TMCT in the horse, will ameliorate the affect of a fixed head position on large airway contamination and inflammation in a long-distance shipping model. Six adult horses were enrolled in a cross-over design prospective study. Horses were housed with their heads in a fixed position for 48 hours to simulate long distance transport, and treated with clenbuterol (0.8 ug/kg PO q12 h) or a placebo starting 12 hours before simulated shipping. TMCT was measured using a charcoal clearance technique. Data were collected at baseline and 48 hours, and included TMCT, tracheal wash cytology and quantitative culture, rectal temperature, CBC, fibrinogen, and serum TNFa, IL-10 and IL-2 levels. There was a 3-week washout between study arms, and each horse served as its own control. The data was analyzed using regression analysis and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. No statistically significant difference was seen between treatment and placebo groups for any of the variables investigated. TMCT did not differ after treatment (1.71 AE 0.64 cm/min) versus placebo (1.55 AE 0.82 cm/ min; P 4 0.10), and intratracheal bacterial counts were similar for treatment (105 \u00c2 10 3 AE 42 \u00c2 103 cfu; P 4 0.10) and placebo (98 \u00c2 10 3 AE 41 \u00c2 103 cfu) groups.

The interaction of insulin and the microvascular endothelial insulin receptor (IRc) plays an important role in the normal and insulin resistant (IR) individual. While endothelial IRc signaling is normally vasodilatory, this effect is well-documented to reverse in the IR individual, resulting in vasoconstriction. Although vascular dysfunction has been reported in sepsis-associated equine laminitis, the role of the laminar microvasculature in endocrinopathic laminitis remains poorly characterized. The purpose of this study was to characterize the pattern of IRc expression in digital laminae in ponies subjected to a dietary carbohydrate challenge that mimicked abrupt exposure to pasture rich in nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC). Mixed-breed ponies (body weight 270.9 1/-74.4 kg) received a diet of hay chop (NSC $6% on a DM basis) for 4 weeks prior to initiation of the experimental feeding protocol. Following conditioning, ponies either remained on the control diet (n 5 11) or received the same diet supplemented with sweet feed and oligofructose (total diet $42% NSC; n 5 11) for a period of 7 days. Serum insulin concentrations were measured prior to and after completion of the feeding protocol. At the end of the feeding protocol, sections of numerous tissues, including dorsal digital laminae, were collected immediately following euthanasia. The samples were formalin-fixed for 48 hours, transferred to 70% ethanol, and paraffin-embedded. Laminar sections were stained immunohistochemically for IRc using a commercially-available antibody (Abcam); the number of IRc (1) cells was quantified in 40x light microscopy fields (n 5 10) for each section. The total number of IRc (1) cells was greater in the laminae of challenged ponies than control ponies (p 5 0.0096), and there was a significant correlation between the change in serum basal insulin concentration and number of laminar IRc (1) endothelial cells (r 5 0.74; p o 0.05). While the number of IRc (1) endothelial cells was significantly greater in the dermal laminae of challenged ponies (p 5 0.0095), there was no difference in the number of interstitial IRc (1) cells (p 5 0.82). No epithelial IRc (1) cells were observed in any laminar section, and IRc (1) cells were conspicuously absent from the deep dermal tissue (including vessels). Up-regulation of IRc expression in the laminar vasculature occurs acutely in response to dietary carbohydrate challenge and accompanies hyperinsulinemia in ponies. The dramatic increase in endothelial IRc expression in the laminar microvasculature in nutritionally challenged ponies, with no apparent epithelial IRc present, suggests that hyperinsulinemia associated with exposure to increased dietary NSC may induce laminar injury by causing a similar vasoconstriction in IR equids as described in the microvasculature of IR humans. Glucose transport from the blood stream into cells, the limiting step in whole-body glucose utilization, is regulated by a family of glucose transporter (GLUT) proteins in insulin-sensitive (i.e., muscle and adipose) tissues. We previously demonstrated that GLUT4, the major isoform, is a key factor in the pathogenesis of equine insulin resistance (IR). While it has been recently demonstrated that GLUT12 (a newly discovered isoform) increases insulin-stimulated glucose transport in human muscle, its role in other tissues, particularly in the setting of IR, is not well characterized in any species. In addition, AS160 has recently emerged as a key downstream signaling molecule regulating translocation of GLUT to the cell surface, the rate-limiting step in glucose uptake. We hypothesized that GLUT12 content would be differentially expressed across tissues and that IR would induce alteration in glucose transport by affecting active cell surface GLUT12.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ABSTRACT"}, {"text": "Biopsies of skeletal muscle, and subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue were collected from light-breed horses, characterized as either insulin sensitive or compensated IR, based on the results of an insulin-modified frequently-sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (n 5 5/group).

It is concluded that, in contrast with GLUT4, GLUT12 does not appear to contribute to glucose transport alterations during naturally-occurring equine IR. Insulin resistance (IR), characterized by exaggerated glycemic or insulinemic responses to glucose challenge, is a key metabolic disturbance in horses that develop obesity-associated laminitis. In addition to obesity, diet and age have been demonstrated to affect tissue sensitivity to insulin in other species but these factors have received limited investigation in horses. We hypothesized that there would be greater glycemic and insulinemic responses to a sweet feed meal in aged horses, as compared to adult horses, as well as in horses adapted to a forage-only diet. Three diets, grass hay only, grass hay plus sweet feed (starch and sugar-rich, SS), and grass hay plus a fat and fiber (FF) feed, were fed to 17 mares, 8 adult (5-12 yr) and 9 aged (4 19 yr), for a 6-week adaptation period in a randomized design. Glycemic and insulinemic responses to a standardized meal of sweet feed (4 g/kg BW offered for 1 hour) were determined for 6 hours from the onset of feeding. Peak glucose and insulin concentrations and areas under the glucose or insulin vs. time curves (AUC-G, mg/ dl/360 min, and AUC-I, mU/ml/360 min) were determined and data were analyzed by one-and two-factor repeated measures ANOVA. There were no differences between age groups in glycemic responses to any of the diets.

In obese humans and rodent models of nutritional obesity, systemic insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are followed temporally in a majority of individuals by decreased glucose tolerance, pancreatic bcell failure, and type II diabetes mellitus. In stark contrast to humans, obese horses and ponies chronically remain in what is termed a ''prediabetic'' state in human IR, characterized by hyperinsulinemic euglycemia. Few data exist describing the biology of the equine endocrine pancreas in the chronically IR animal that may both: 1) explain this unique equine endocrine physiology and 2) characterize the animal at-risk for hyperinsulinemia-associated laminitis. The purpose of the study reported here was to characterize the morphology and physiology of the equine endocrine pancreas in response to a dietary carbohydrate challenge. Twenty-two mixedbreed ponies (body weight 266.6 AE 170.5 kg) were conditioned to a diet of chopped hay (NSC $6% on DM basis) for 4 weeks; following conditioning, ponies either remained on the control diet (n 5 11), or received the same hay supplemented with sweet feed and oligofructose (total diet $42% NSC; n 5 11) for 7 days. Serum insulin concentrations were measured prior to and after completion of the feeding protocol. At the end of the feeding protocol, sections of numerous tissues, including pancreas, were collected immediately following euthanasia. The samples were formalin-fixed for 48 hours, transferred to 70% ethanol, and paraffin-embedded. Immunohistochemistry was performed on pancreas sections using a commerciallyavailable anti-insulin antibody (Abcam), and measurements of islet surface area and b-cell surface area were performed (n 5 10 islets per tissue section) using a commercially-available computer software program (Image J). There was a trend for greater total islet surface area in pancreatic tissue from ponies fed the high NSC diet when compared to the ponies on the hay diet (p 5 0.068); however, no difference was noted in b-cell surface area between diet treatments (p 5 0.12). The change in serum insulin concentration was significantly greater in the high NSC-fed ponies than in controls (403.8 1/-317.1 mIU/L vs. 1.00 1/\u00c0 4.03 mIU/L; p 5 0.002); however, this variable was not correlated with total islet surface area (r 5 0.32; p 5 0.17) or b-cell surface area (r 5 0.25; p 5 0.3). Due to the relatively modest changes in pancreatic islet surface area that accompany marked increases in serum insulin concentrations in ponies fed a high NSC diet, it is important to assess both b-cell function and insulin clearance mechanisms in future studies to delineate the mechanism(s) of hyperinsulinemia in this model.

Elevated serum concentration of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is a biomarker for myocardial damage in horses. Preferred times to test blood for cTnI levels following athletic performance or other events that may cause myocardial injury are not yet established and would be affected by time of release from the myocytes, location of release within the myocytes, duration of release and half-life of cTnI in the horse. This information would be necessary to more accurately and reliably test horses for myocardial injury. The aim of this study was to determine the elimination half-life (T1/2) of equine cTnI. To establish the T1/2 of equine cTnI in horses, cTnI was recombinantly expressed in E.coli. Two healthy ponies received intravenous injections of recombinant equine cTnI and plasma cTnI concentrations were measured with a point-of-care cTnI analyzer at multiple time points after injection. Standard pharmacokinetic analysis was performed to establish the elimination half-life of cTnI. For comparative purposes, data were subjected to pharmacokinetic models describing a single versus biphasic elimination profile. Elimination of recombinant equine cTnI following intravenous administration exhibits a short half-life. Establishing the T1/2 of troponin provides critical information in understanding the clinical application of this cardiac biomarker in clinical practice. This study describes a true biological cTnI T1/2, which has not been documented in any species thus far. Stall-side assessment of this cardiac biomarker in horses should enhance the ability of clinicians to detect myocardial damage and aid in the management and treatment of horses with cardiac disease.

The availability of rapid and accurate quantitative fibrinogen measurements may be useful for evaluation of hospitalized equine patients. The Abaxis VSPro analyzer was evaluated for precision using two levels of human fibrinogen controls (300 mg/dL and 150 mg/dL), four different VSPro machines, and two different lots of cartridges, assessed over 5 subsequent days. The coefficients of variation of the assay ranged from 4% (300 mg/dL) to 8% (150 mg/ dL). We subsequently evaluated the Abaxis VSPro fibrinogen assay compared to fibrinogen concentration measured using the Beckman Coulter ACL-1000 in 50 equine samples of varying fibrinogen concentrations obtained from horses with gastrointestinal disease. All samples were measured in citrated plasma. Fibrinogen samples measured on the ACL-1000 ranged from 226 to 959 mg/dL (median 501 mg/dL). VSPro samples were run in duplicate, and the mean compared to the ACL values. Pearson correlation coefficient analysis generated an r value of 0.949 (P o 0.001). Duplicate measurements on the VSPro were strongly correlated to each other with an r value of 0.9690 (P o 0.001).

The immune response of foals to R. equi is incompletely understood and believed to be responsible for clinical disease caused by this pulmonary pathogen. In a recent study foals receiving a large inoculum exhibited Th2 skewing with pneumonia and a small inoculum exhibited Th1 skewing without clinical disease. We hypothesized that cytokine/chemokine production by pulmonary alveolar macrophages, in vitro, would increase with the infective dose and that the magnitude of the response would differ between foals and adults. Alveolar macrophages were obtained by bronchoalevolar lavage from 7 healthy mares and their 5-week-old foals. Macrophage cultures were infected with R. equi (337011 or 33701-) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 or 100.

Lawsonia intracellularis is an emerging pathogen in horses and the causative agent in Equine Proliferative Enteropathy (EPE). The goal of this study was to evaluate the exposure of pre-weanling foals and broodmares to Lawsonia intracelluaris on several farms in Louisiana with a history of EPE and compare the results to several farms with no known clinical cases of EPE in foals. An additional goal of the study was to identify whether a relationship exists between Lawsonia intracelluaris and other gastrointestinal pathogens in foals. Whole blood and fecal samples were collected from 66 mares and 68 foals from four breeding farms in Louisiana. Farms A and B had no known clinical cases of EPE, while Farms C and D had previous know cases of EPE in 2009. Serum samples were examined for the presence of antibodies against Lawsonia intracellularis using an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA). DNA was extracted from fecal samples using a commercial DNA kit and molecular detection of Lawsonia intracelluaris was assayed using real-time PCR. Fecal ova were determined using quantitative sucrose floatation. The presence of fecal Clostridium difficile toxin was measured using a commercial enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Three foals (4.4%) tested positive for L. intracellularis organism by fecal PCR, and all of these foals were located on farm C. Of these, one of the foals was seronegative, while the other two were seropositive. Farm C also had the highest percentage of mares (28.6%) serologically positive for L. intracellularis, while Farm A had the highest percentage of foals (14.3%) with antibody titers against L intracellaris. Farm C also had the only pairs (n 5 3) of serologically positive mares with seropositive foals.

Pathologic events reported to occur in the digital laminae in early stages of sepsis-related equine laminitis include leukocyte extravasa-tion into the laminar interstitium, pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and epithelial stress. While these events have been documented early in the disease process at both a developmental stage and at the onset of Obel Grade 1 (OG1) lameness in the carbohydrate overload (CHO) model of laminitis, the later events occurring at the onset of Obel Grade 3 lameness(OG3, time point at which structural failure of the laminae usually occurs) have not been determined. We hypothesized that the inflammatory events described above are sustained through OG 3 lameness, likely playing an injurious role culminating in laminar failure. Our objectives were to determine pro-inflammatory gene expression, leukocyte extravasation, and epithelial stress at OG 3 induced using the CHO model. Archived laminar tissue samples (snap frozen and paraffin embedded sections) were used from a previous CHO study at Louisiana State University (Control group [n 5 6, water], CHO group [n 5 7, corn starch]. Calprotectin (CP) immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to assess both laminar myeloid leukocyte numbers and epithelial stress; RT-qPCR was used to assess inflammatory gene expression. Minimal inflammatory changes were present at OG3 compared to published values at OG1 stage in the CHO lameness model including decreased mRNA concentrations of cytokines (i.e. 20-fold increase in IL-6 at OG3 vs. 4 2000-fold increase at OG1, no increase in IL-1b at OG3 vs. 11-fold increase at OG1), chemokines (no change in MCP-1at OG3 vs. 4 30 fold increase at OG1, 8-fold increase in IL-8 at OG3 vs. 95fold increase at OG1) and adhesion molecules (no change in E-selectin at OG3 vs. 10-fold increase at OG1). Laminar leukocyte emigration was also decreased at the onset of OG 3 lameness compared to previously reported leukocyte infiltration at OG 1. Interestingly COX-2, underwent a greater increase at OG3 (approx. 50-fold) compared to that reported at OG1 lameness (35-fold). Finally, epithelial stress at OG3 evidenced by CP IHC did not follow the uniform widespread distribution reported at OG1 lameness, but instead was present in focal areas in which secondary epidermal laminae on either side of a common primary dermal vascular supply demonstrated increased CP signal. Overall, laminar inflammation appears to be subsiding at OG3 lameness, with epithelial stress possibly more dependent on vascular dysregulation instead of inflammatory events. The sustained increase in COX-2, central to the induced production of vasoactive prostanoids in disease processes, may play a role in vascular dysregulation.

Hereditary equine regional dermal asthenia (HERDA) is an autosomal recessive connective tissue disorder affecting Quarter Horse lineages. 1 Although a mutation in the gene encoding cyclophilin B has been genetically linked to HERDA, its causal association with the disease is not yet documented. 2 Previously, we demonstrated reductions in ultimate tensile strength (UTS), modulus of elasticity, and energy to failure (toughness) of skin from many corporal regions of HERDA animals. 3 Given the presumed relationship between HER-DA and abnormal collagen structure, and the predominance of Type I collagen in skin, we hypothesized that altered biomechanical properties would be detected in tendons which are rich in Type I collagen. To evaluate this hypothesis we compared the UTS, modulus of elasticity, and energy to failure of forelimb deep digital flexor tendons (DFT) from six HERDA horses to six age-matched controls. Isolated DFT was secured and pulled to failure on an Instron s 1011 Universal Testing Instrument using purpose-built cryogenic clamps. Analysis of Variance was executed using SAS 9.2 PROC GLIMMIX program (SAS Institute, 2009). P-values 0.05 were identified as significant. UTS and modulus of elasticity were significantly lower in HERDA DFT when compared with controls (P o 0.0001); energy to failure did not differ between groups. These findings document abnormal biomechanics in HERDA tendon, leading us to postulate that lower UTS and modulus of elasticity associated with the HERDA defect could convey a competitive advantage in the athletic disciplines in which this defect has segregated.

These properties make BIOS potentially useful as a topical wound medication, prompting us to compare BIOS to silver sulfadiazine (SSD) in a distal extremity wound healing model in horses. 1 Using general anesthesia, two 6.25 cm 2 wounds were aseptically created on the dorsomedial aspect of all limbs. For the duration of the study, two contralateral limbs were randomly chosen to be bandaged; the other two limbs were un-bandaged -with one limb of each group being treated with 10% BIOS and the other with SSD. For each limb the most proximal wound served as an untreated control. Every 48 hours wounds were evaluated, digitally photographed, and perimeter and area determined using morphometric software (ImageJ, NIH). Analysis of variance did not identify significant differences between SSD or BIOS treatment for wound perimeter (p 5 0.76) or area (p 5 0.95). At individual time points the effect of bandaging was significant when area was evaluated (p 5 0.019) and trended toward significance for perimeter (p 5 0.084) comparisons, substantiating published reports that bandaging modifies wound healing. Difference in perimeter and area between control and treatment were highly significant (p o 0.0001), substantiating the importance of topical treatment. Over the study duration, effects of bandaging (p o 0.0001) and topical treatment (perimeter p o 0.0001; area p 5 0.0016) continued to be highly significant. BIOS performance in the equine distal extremity wound model was equivalent to SSD. Both bandaging and topical treatment significantly impacted wound healing.

Digital hypothermia is used clinically to decrease the incidence of sepsis-related equine laminitis, a disease causing structural failure of digital laminae resulting in crippling lameness. Due to the fact that hypothermia was recently reported to effectively decrease laminar expression of inflammatory molecules including pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and COX-2 in equine laminitis, our laboratory is investigating the effect of hypothermia on central upstream signaling cascades which may induce expression of these diverse inflammatory molecules. The p38 MAPK pathway has recently been reported to be a central component of inflammatory signaling in multiple diseases including human sepsis, and is currently being assessed as a therapeutic target. We thus hypothesized that 1) p38 MAPK is upregulated and activated in affected laminae in equine laminitis and 2) digital hypothermia inhibits inflammatory mediator expression by blocking p38 MAPK phosphorylation (indicator of p38 MAPK activation). Western hybridizations using both a total p38 MAPK and a phospho-p38 MAPK antibody were performed on archived pooled laminar samples from black walnut extract (BWE) model (10 control, 2 developmental (DEV) groups [1.5H & 3H post BWE administration] and the onset of Obel Grade 1 lameness (OG1) [n 5 5 each]) and carbohydrate overload (CHO) models (CON [n 5 8], DEV [n 5 6], OG1[n 5 6]) of laminitis, and individual laminar samples from two groups of horses from a digital hypothermia (DH) study. In the DH study, one forelimb of each horse was kept at approximately 41C in ice water and the other at ambient temperature following administration of 10 g/kg oligofructose (OF). Dorsal laminae were harvested for snap freezing at either 24 hours after OF administration (DEV, n 5 7) or at the onset of lameness (OG1, n 5 6) using protein extracted from treated and untreated digital laminae of each horse. Increased laminar concentrations of phospho-p38 MAPK were present in the developmental periods (1.5H and 3H) in the BWE model, and in both the DEV and OG1 periods in the CHO laminitis models. However, digital hypothermia had no effect on laminar phospho-p38 MAPK concentrations. Thus, p38 MAPK is activated in affected laminae in multiple models of laminitis, but does not appear to be the central signaling cascade through which hypothermia works to block the expression of inflammatory molecules. Therefore, p38 MAPK is not likely to be a viable therapeutic target as a sole source for blocking the multiple inflammatory signaling mechanisms inhibited by local hypothermia.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ABSTRACT E-57"}, {"text": "ABSTRACT E-60 DOES CEFQUINOME PENETRATE THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER IN THE NORMAL HORSE?

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of treatment in hyperthyroid cats with known stage 1 and 2 CKD in order to determine the effects of restoring euthyroidism or inducing hypothyroidism has on the IRIS stage in these cats. We evaluated 36 hyperthyroid cats (median age, 14 years) in this study. One day prior to treatment, serum T 4 concentration, serum chemistry analysis, complete urinalysis, and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPC) were measured. All cats were again evaluated with the same parameters again 3 months after treatment with 131 I. Prior to treatment, 26 (72%) of the 36 cats had no evidence of azotemia (serum creatinine o 1.6 mg/dl), whereas 10 cats (28%) had stage 2 CKD (serum creatinine, 1.6-2.8 mg/dl). In the 36 cats, IRIS staging revealed proteinuria in 33 cats (92%), 21 with borderline proteinuria (UPC, 0.2-0.4) and 12 with overt proteinuria (UPC 4 0.4). Hyperthyroidism was cured in all 36 cats (median post-T4, 1.3 mg/dl). All cats had a good response to treatment; there were no signs of CKD except for polyuria and polydipsia in some cats. A significant (P o 0.001) increase in median values for both serum urea nitrogen (26 mg/dl to 31 mg/dl)) and creatinine (1.1 to 1.7 mg/dl) occurred after treatment. Nine of the 26 cats (34.6%) classified as nonazotemic or IRIS stage 1 prior to 131 I progressed to stage 2 CKD after 131 I. All 10 cats with stage 2 CKD before treatment remained azotemic after 131 I, with 5 cats remaining in stage 2 CKD, and 4 cats progressing to stage 3 CKD (serum creatinine, 3.1-3.7 mg/dl). There was a significant inverse relationship (P 5 0.002) between pretreatment urine specific gravity (USG) and post-treatment serum creatinine in the 36 cats. Of the 19 cats with post-treatment serum creatinine values 4 1.5 mg/dl (stage 2 to 3 CKD), 15 (79%) had pretreatment USG of o 1.040. In contrast, in the 17 cats with post-treatment serum creatinine values o 1.5 mg/dl, only 3 (18%) had pretreatment USG of o 1.040. A significant (P o 0.001) decrease in median UPC from 0.3 to 0.1 occurred after treatment, but there was no relationship between degree of proteinuria and IRIS stage in these cats. Two cats developed iatrogenic hypothyroidism after 131 I, diagnosed by finding low serum T 4 and high cTSH concentrations. Both hypothyroid cats had progressed from stage 1 before treatment to stage 2 and 3 CKD, respectively, after 131 I; after thyroxine replacement, serum creatinine decreased to near pretreatment concentrations in both cats. Conclusions: 1) IRIS stage 2 CKD is common in untreated hyperthyroid cats. 2) Progression to next higher IRIS stage is common after treatment, but most cats with remain relatively asymptomatic for CKD. 3) USG may be helpful in predicting which cat's IRIS stage will progress after 131 I. 4) Iatrogenic hypothyroidism worsens azotemia, an effect that appears reversible with replacement therapy. Home blood glucose monitoring (HBGM) of diabetic pets is likely to result in superior glycaemic control, minimizing episodes and impact of dangerous hypoglycaemia and reducing costs. Nevertheless, it has proven difficult to objectively establish a clear benefit of HBGM using biological parameters (clinical signs, blood glucose, fructosamine).

Insulin resistance is associated with impaired activation of the insulin signaling pathway in peripheral tissues such as skeletal muscle, visceral and subcutaneous (SC) adipose tissue. High plasma glucose, fatty acid and endotoxin levels are three major causes of insulin resistance in feline and human obesity and in type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the mechanisms by which these factors influence insulin action are still unclear. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the tissue-specific expression of crucial mediators of insulin action such as the insulin-receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), the serine/threonine protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) and of the principal insulin-dependent glucose transporter protein (GLUT4) in feline models of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and subacute endotoxemia.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ABSTRACT EN-4 IMPACT OF HOME BLOOD GLUCOSE MONITORING ON QUALITY OF LIFE OF DIABETIC CATS AND THEIR OWN-ERS RECORDED USING THE PSYCHOMETRIC TOOL"}, {"text": "Healthy cats were infused through the jugular vein with glucose (n 5 5), lipids (n 5 6) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS; n 5 5) for 10 days to clamp their blood concentrations at the approximate level found in untreated feline diabetes (glucose: 25-30 mmol/l; triglycerides: 3-7 mmol/l) or to induce a systemic low-grade inflammation (LPS; rectal temperature: 39.2-40.51C), respectively.

Hyperadrenocorticism (HAC) is one of the most common endocrine disorders of dogs. The two most effective medical treatments are trilostane (Vetoryl s ) and mitotane (Lysodren s ). Previous studies evaluating the effect of treatment on aldosterone secretion measured the hormone at 60 min post-ACTH administration.

Literature regarding diseases causing lameness in beef cattle is limited. This retrospective study was undertaken to examine beef cattle presented for lameness. Medical records of beef cattle having a lameness examination done during the period 2007 to 2010 were reviewed and descriptive statistics generated. Lameness was classified based on clinical diagnosis. The medical records of 270 beef cattle were reviewed of which 63.2% were male and 36.8% were female. Beef cattle presented for lameness most often during the summer months (34%) and least during autumn (18%). Causes of lameness were categorized as infectious (44.6%) or non-infectious (55.4%) and infectious lameness subcategorized as either a primary disorder or a secondary infection. All cases of a primary infectious disorder were interdigital phlegmon. Secondary infections diseases included sole abscess (25.9%), septic arthritis (11.1%), tenosynovitis (2.8%), and pedal osteitis (1.3%). Non-infectious lameness included proximal limb lameness (19.6%), foot trauma (14.6%), hoof horn cracks (9.5%), hoof defects (2.5%), interdigital fibromas (1.9%), overgrown hooves (1.9%), sole bruise (1.3%), subclinical laminitis (1.3%), white line disease (0.9%), osteoarthritis (0.9%), heel erosion (0.3%), sole ulcers (0.3%), and sole hemorrhage (0.3%). The most frequently affected claw was the lateral digit of the hind limb (36.4%), followed by the medial digit of the front limb (27.1%), lateral digit of the front limb (23.6%), and the medial digit of the hind limb (12.9%). The findings of this study suggest significant differences in the frequency of disease causing lameness in beef cattle compared to published reports for dairy cattle. In people, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has become the technique of choice for assessing pancreatic disease and EUS-guided fineneedle aspiration (EUS FNA) has proven a useful and safe modality for characterizing pancreatic lesions. Reported complications include infections, bleeding and acute pancreatitis. In dogs, laparoscopic-assisted pancreatic biopsy has been suggested to be a safe procedure, however EUS and EUS FNA have not been evaluated in dogs so far. Thus the aim of the present study was to assess the practicability and safety of EUS examination of the abdominal cavity as well as pancreatic EUS FNA in healthy dogs. This study was approved by the Cantonal Committee for the Authorization of Animal Experimentation, Zurich, Switzerland. The study population consisted of 14 healthy beagle dogs with a median bodyweight of 13.4 kg (10.9-15.7). EUS was performed with an Olympus GF-UC140P-echoendoscope and FNA were performed using 19 G needles (Cook EchoTipUltra). After completion of the EUS-examination of the abdominal cavity from the stomach (liver, gallbladder, bile ducts, kidneys, adrenals, pancreas), the scope was advanced into the duodenum and EUS FNA of the pancreas was performed. FNA tissue acquisition was made applying negative pressure and 6 to 8 needle passes were made. All dogs received 30 mg/kg metimazole IM after EUS FNA and were re-checked ultrasonographically 20 minutes post EUS FNA. Postoperative activity was assessed using a standardized scoring system. A CBC, serum biochemistry, urinalysis and spec cPL s were measured before, as well as 24 and 48 h after EUS FNA.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ABSTRACT EN-6 IMAGE FUSION OF SINGLE-PHOTON EMISSION COM-PUTED TOMOGRAPHY AND COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY"}, {"text": "The EUS examination was complete in 13/14 dogs, the pancreas could not be visualized in 1 dog.

The pancreas was aspirated in 12 dogs using a transgastric approach (3) or transduodenal approach (9). Duodenal transmural puncture was not accomplished in 1 dog where a re-sterilized needle was used. A minimal amount of peripancreatic fluid was observed in 1/12 dogs after EUS FNA. All dogs recovered uneventfully and required no further analgesia. All laboratory results including the spec cPL s measurements were within reference ranges on all three time points. Cytologically, conglomerates of exocrine pancreatic cells were seen in 8/12 cases, duodenal villous epithelial cells were seen in 11/12 cases. In 1 dog the aspirated pancreatic material was sufficient for a histological assessment. The 8 aspirates with exocrine pancreatic cells on cytology were obtained by transgastric (4) and transduodenal (4) aspirations. In conclusion, (1) EUS examination of the abdomen is feasible in medium-sized dogs, (2) the healthy canine pancreas can be difficult to visualize completely, and (3) EUS-guided pancreatic FNA using a 19 G needle is a safe procedure in healthy dogs.

Further studies are needed to investigate serum cobalamin concentrations in patients with Shar Pei fever or cutaneous mucinosis. Cobalamin deficiency (CD) has been associated with gastrointestinal and pancreatic disease in dogs. Hereditary CD has been demonstrated in Giant Schnauzers and single case reports have suggested congenital CD in the Border Collie (BC) breed. Clinicopathologic findings of CD vary and can be unspecific as cobalamin acts as a Co-Factor for a multitude of enzymatic reactions. The two most important reactions concern the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA and the re-methylation of homocysteine (Hcy). These two metabolites increase when cobalamin is lacking and act as markers for cobalamin availability on a cellular level. Preliminary data from dogs suggested that measurement of methylmalonic acid (MMA) may be a better diagnostic test for CD than serum cobalamin concentration. Therefore the goals of the study were (1) to establish reference values for serum cobalamin, urine MMA and plasma Hcy in healthy pet dogs, (2) to screen a larger BC population from Switzerland for CD, and (3) to perform genomic analyses on BC with CD.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ABSTRACT GI"}, {"text": "For determination of reference values 35 healthy pet dogs were used.

The screened BC population comprised 113 purebred dogs and 4 BC (median 11.5 months; range 8-41) suffering from congenital CD could be identified. Clinical signs differed and consisted of tiredness (4), stunted growth (4), anemia (3), dysphagia (2) and persistent fever (1). Median (ranges) results for healthy BC and BC with CD were: for cobalamin 592 (142-1855) and 72.00 (30-139) ng/L; for urine MMA 2 (2-360) and 4148 (1800-6665) mmol/mol creatinine; for Hcy 8.5 (2.8-22.4) and 41.00 (40-86.6) mmol/L. Strikingly, healthy BC with cobalamin concentrations well within the reference range had significantly higher urine MMA concentrations compared to control dogs. Under the assumption that the four affected BC are inbred to a single founder animal, first results of genotyping on the 170 k illumina canine_HD SNP chip suggest that mutations in the CUBN and AMN gene can be excluded to cause the observed CD in these dogs. We conclude that CD is a rare familial disease in BC with variable clinical signs. To define the genomic region responsible for CD further genetic analysis is in progress. It remains to be determined why some BC have high urine MMA concentrations despite a serum cobalamin concentration within the reference range. Calprotectin is a protein complex that plays an important role in the innate immune response. Preliminary data suggest that canine calprotectin (cCP) is a useful marker for the detection of inflammation in dogs. Recently, a radioimmunoassay for the measurement of cCP has been developed and analytically validated, but this test requires the use of a radioactive tracer.

The syndrome of hemorrhagic gastroenteritis (HGE) is characterized by a peracute onset of hemorrhagic diarrhea, vomiting, depression, and anorexia, and can be associated with a high mortality if untreated. The etiology of HGE is unknown, but it is speculated that an abnormal response to bacterial endotoxins, bacteria, or dietary components may play a role.

Cobalamin (vitamin B 12 ) is involved in a variety of metabolic processes.

This study was conducted to identify breeds with a higher proportion of a decreased serum cobalamin concentration that were submitted to the Gastrointestinal Laboratory. The study was also aimed at investigating serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI) concentrations that were diagnostic for EPI in the dogs with a decreased serum cobalamin concentration.

Also, a possible association between an undetectable serum cobalamin and a decreased serum TLI in AI needs to be further investigated. Calprotectin (CP) is a widely used marker for the diagnosis and monitoring of gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation in humans.

The aim of this study was to compare the number of attempts needed to successfully obtain a sample, the time needed for the procedure, and the sample quality between aspirates obtained from the CC junction and more traditional sites (humerus or femur) in healthy dogs when performed by novice and seasoned practitioners.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ABSTRACT GI"}, {"text": "Samples were obtained from healthy anesthetized laboratory reared adult dogs after undergoing terminal endoscopic surgery.

Both subjectively and objectively, there were no significant differences in quality or cell populations between the two sampling sites in healthy dogs. Based on this data, bone marrow aspiration from the CC junction appears to be equivalent to more traditional sampling sites in healthy dogs. Larger studies in clinically ill dogs should be performed before routinely using the site in the clinical setting. Recent research on iron homeostasis has elucidated the tightly controlled intestinal uptake of iron. Hepcidin, the major hormone limiting iron absorption and release from macrophages, is downregulated by matriptase-2, a transmembrane serine protease (Tmprss6) produced by the liver. While iron deficiency is commonly caused by chronic blood loss anemia and rarely dietary deficiency or intestinal disorders in dogs and other species, we report here the clinical to molecular investigations of a dog with iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA) caused by a matriptase-2 deficiency homologous to a recently described autosomal recessive disorder in humans.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ABSTRACT"}, {"text": "The proband, a spayed female Cocker Spaniel without any clinical signs except for recent occasional idiopathic seizures, exhibited a lifelong history of microcytosis and hypochromasia but not anemia.

This is the first report of an IRIDA in the dog with features very similar to those observed in humans. Dogs with naturally-occurring IRIDA may be helpful in developing and assessing novel therapies. Accidental ingestion of copper-coated zinc pennies minted after 1982 is the most common causes of zinc toxicity anemia in the dog. Zinc toxicity anemia may also be seen with ingestion of zinc from other sources as ingestion of metallic foreign material other than pennies, medicines containing zinc, and zinc supplements. The purpose of this study was to determine if there is a weight below which dogs are more susceptible to zinc toxicity anemia secondary to metallic foreign body ingestion. Records of dogs presented to the Internal Medicine service at the Veterinary Medical Center of Long Island for metallic foreign body ingestion were reviewed for signalment, weight, presenting PCV, and type of metallic foreign body ingested. Eighteen dogs met the inclusion criteria and were compared. Of the 18 dogs, there were 15 cases of coin ingestion (83%), with 11 (73%) involving ingestion of 1 or more pennies. The other 3 cases involved ingestion of a metallic object (1), decorative garland (1), and BB pellets (1).Of the 14 dogs exposed to zinc, 13 (93%) were less than 27 pounds (12.3 kgs). Of those 13 cases 11 (85%) had ingested one or more pennies. Eleven out of the 14 (79%) zinc exposure dogs were anemic at presentation. The average weight of the 11 dogs was 17.5 pounds (8 kg). This study showed that dogs less than 27 pounds appear to be more susceptible to developing anemia secondary to zinc toxicosis, with the majority of cases due to ingestion of pennies minted after 1982. Zinc toxicity anemia secondary to penny ingestion is more commonly seen in small dogs. We suspect larger dogs are able to pass pennies through the pyloric sphincter and thus not develop clinical signs. Although thrombocytopenia is common in hospitalized dogs, canine cryopreserved platelet concentrate (PC) is used infrequently.

Erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is the first and most common erythroenzymopathy described in dogs, cats, and humans. The PK enzyme plays a crucial role in the erythrocyte energy metabolism and its absence causes severe hemolytic anemia, often misdiagnosed as autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and affected dogs also develop osteosclerosis. In dogs, the enzymatic diagnosis is complicated by the anomalous expression of malfunctioning M 2 -PK expression, but breed-specific R-PK mutation tests have been reported for Basenjis, West Highland White Terriers (WHWT), and Beagles.

The diagnosis is based on clinical history, presenting signs and hematological evidence of IMHA such as regenerative anemia, leucocytosis and presence of spherocytes. The definitive diagnostic procedure is the Coomb's test (direct antiglobulin test, DAT) which is known to be highly specific but lacks diagnostic sensitivity.

Bone marrow aspirates from cats are typically obtained from the ilium, humerus or femur, but may be difficult to obtain and/or of poor quality. In this study the feasibility, safety, and nature of sternal aspiration in cats was investigated. Under general anesthesia, bone marrow aspirates were obtained in a randomized order by a single investigator from the sternum and ilium of 10 healthy cats weighing 3.4-8.4 kg, with body condition scores of 5-9 (on a scale of 1-9). For sternal aspirates, cats were positioned in sternal recumbency and a 1-inch, 22-23 ga hypodermic needle attached to a 12cc syringe was inserted into the cranial manubrium and directed caudally along the long axis of the sternum. Aspirates were also obtained from the right iliac crest using an 18 ga Illinois needle attached to a 12cc syringe. Difficulty of site localization, needle insertion and advancement, and specimen aspiration, were scored from 1 (easiest) to 5 (hardest). Bone marrow smears were prepared by one investigator and reviewed by a pathologist blinded to aspiration site and cat.

Antimicrobial resistance in Escherichia coli is an increasing concern in both human and veterinary hospitals' patients. The choice drug for treatment in dogs is enrofloxacin, a second generation fluoroquinolone (FQ) whose activity reflects, in part, ciprofloxacin. Among the difficulties in effective E. coli treatment is rapid detection of FQ resistance. The purpose of this study was to determine the specificity and sensitivity of a FRET based assay for the rapid detection of urinary tract infections caused by FQ associated multi-drug resistant E.coli. 306 clinical E. coli isolated from canine urine and 120 clinical veterinary urine samples being examined for E. coli were subjected to susceptibility testing for 14 drugs representing 6 drug classes. Pure isolates were designated NDR (no drug resistance), SDR (single drug resistance) and MDR (multi-drug resistant) (n 5 101 MDR, 116 SDR and 89 NDR). Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for enrofloxacin ranged from 0.03 mg/ml to 512 mg/ml, with high MIC generally associated with MDR. Extracted DNA from culture and from urine were subjected to FRET-PCR targeting single nucleotide polymorphisms in gyrA. The resulting product was sequenced to detect other polymorphisms. Further, to determine the level of detection, microbial free canine urine was inoculated with 10 6 to 10 1 CFU/ml of 7 isolates characterized by variable susceptibility to enrofloxacin (MIC Enro 5 0.03, 0.06, 0.15, 1, 64, 128, 256 mg/ml). Of 306 pure isolates, 50 were confirmed positive for enrofloxacin resistance (MIC Enro 4 4 mg/ml), 43 of which were positively identified by the FRET-PCR assay giving a sensitivity of 86.00%. Only 1 isolate that was resistant was not detected (specificity of 96.66%). However, of the isolates expressing high level resistance (MIC 4 8 X breakpoint [64 mcg/ml]), and MDR (n 5 34), sensitivity 5 97.06%. Of the 120 urine samples 27 contained E. coli 7 of which determined to be FQ-resistant by the assay. Colony dilutions of E. coli confirmed the assay able to detect enrofloxacin resistance at as low as 101 CFU/ml. The relationship between CFUs and the peak of the -(d/dt) fluorescence of the melting curve was R2 5 0.988. These results conclude that the assay is capable of detecting not only the presence of Escherichia coli in clinical samples, but also detecting severity of fluroquinolone resistance and infection. The fluoroquinolones (FQs) are a key class of synthetic antimicrobial agents with an established history in both humans and companion animals of efficacy for treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by E. coli, and fluoroquinolones are common therapy. Among the commonly used FQs in dogs and cats are the 2nd generation drugs, enrofloxacin, marbofloxacin, orbifloxacin (all veterinary approved) and the human drug ciprofloxacin; no 3rd and 4th generation FQ is routinely used. The purpose of this study was to assess the in vitro activity of different generation FQs toward E.coli uropathogens whose phenotype ranges from no resistance to multidrug resistance. A total number of 51 canine uropathogenic canine or feline E.coli isolates had been subjected to susceptibility testing to 6 drugs classes (15 drugs) and phenotyped as to resistance: none (NDR, n 5 12), single (SDR, n 5 15), or multiple, MDR (resistance to 2-6 drug classes; n 5 24). MDR included isolates susceptible (ENR S -MDR, n 5 12) or resistant (ENR R -MDR) to enrofloxacin. The minimum inhibition concentrations (MICs) for 11 quinolones (1-1st generation, 3-2nd generation, 4-3rd generation and 3-4th generation) were determined for these isolates using broth microdilution methods according to CLSI guidelines (E. coli ATCC s 25922 served as a negative control). MIC statistics were generated for each drug among phenotypes. The results showed that companion animal E. coli expressing NDR or SDR are largely susceptible to 2nd to 4th generation FQs. However, isolates expressing resistance to 1st or 2nd generation quinolone also express high level resistance based on the MIC 90 to 3rd and 4th generation FQs. The overall potency (MIC) for the 11 drugs for isolates not expressing ENR resistance (that is, NDR, SDR and ENR S -MDR) is GAT Canine leproid granuloma (CLG) was first reported in Brazil in 1990.

Canine granulocytic anaplasmosis and granulocytic ehrlichiosis are tick-transmitted infections caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Aph) and Ehrlichia ewingii (Eew), respectively. Both organisms induce an acute clinical disease, frequently accompanied by fever, polyarthropathy and thrombocytopenia. However, Aph and Eew have different tick vectors, i.e. Ixodes scapularis and Ambylomma americanum, respectively, with different, but overlapping geographic distributions. In addition, infection outcome may be affected by other regional ticktransmitted pathogens, such as Borrelia burgdorferi (MN) or Ehrlichia chaffeensis (AR). Therefore, we compared serology and PCR results derived from dogs examined at two private practices located in highly endemic areas for either Aph or Eew. Serum collected between April-December, 2005 from Minnesota dogs (n 5 420) was tested by SNAP s 4Dx s and whole blood was tested by Aph PCR.

Active Eew infection, as determined by PCR, was four times more frequent in AR pet dog seroreactors as compared to active Aph infections among Aph seroreactors.

The purpose of the present study was investigate the occurrence of leishmaniasis in 200 cats in the municipality of Arac\u00b8atuba, Sa\u02dco Paulo, Brazil, an endemic area for canine visceral leishmaniasis. Animals were evaluated by direct parasitological examination of lymphoid organs and serology for visceral leishmaniosis by immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect immunofluorescence (IFAT). Thirteen (6.5%) out of 200 cats studied were diagnosed with visceral leishmaniasis; eight (4%) by parasitological diagnosis through cytological examination of lymphoid organs, six (3%) were considered positive by ELISA and one (0.5%) by IFAT.

The prevalence of ABUTI in O dogs was 6% (n 5 1) and 31% (n 5 8) in MO dogs. The dog in the O group with ABUTI was close to being MO with a BF equaling 44.3%.

Cystinuria is a hereditary renal tubular reabsorption defect of cystine, ornithine, lysine and arginine (collectively, COLA). The low solubility of cystine in acidic urine predisposes to the formation of uroliths. Type I cystinuria in Newfoundland and Labrador Retriever dogs is an autosomal recessive trait caused by mutations in the SLC3A1 gene, whereas in other breeds, the cause of cystinuria has not yet been determined.

Cats and dogs that are diagnosed with acute kidney injury (AKI) and resultant uremia that is not responsive to standard medical therapy are likely to benefit from renal replacement therapies, such as intermittent hemodialysis (IHD). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcome of patients with AKI treated with IHD, and to establish whether renal function, as determined by serum or plasma creatinine concentrations, is associated with longterm survival. Medical records of 20 cats and 35 dogs that were diagnosed with AKI, treated with IHD, and survived longer than 30 days following the last IHD treatment were retrospectively analyzed. Standard methods of survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier product limit curves and the log-rank test were performed. For all-cause mortality, the median survival time was 1823 days (95% confidence interval: 841, 4667) for cats and 1049 days (95% confidence interval: 893, 1931) for dogs. When only renal-related causes of death were taken into account, the median survival time was not reached for cats or dogs. Survival time for all-cause mortality was inversely associated with the lowest creatinine concentration within the 30 to 90 day period following the last IHD treatment (p o 0.0011 for cats, p o 0.0104 for dogs). This study demonstrates that veterinary patients that are diagnosed with AKI, treated with IHD, and survive greater than 30 days after the last IHD treatment have a good longterm prognosis and frequently die from causes that are unrelated to renal impairment. Renal fine-needle aspiration (R-FNA) is oftentimes attempted during evaluation of dogs and cats with renomegaly, mass lesions, or suspected infiltrative processes. Diagnostic utility of FNA is dependent upon the organ being sampled; additionally, in some organs, certain diagnostic imaging findings are associated with improved concordance of FNA with final diagnosis. Objectives of this study were to evaluate the diagnostic utility of R-FNA and determine whether concordance with final diagnosis is associated with specific clinicopathologic or diagnostic imaging findings. We hypothesized that R-FNA is most useful in patients with diagnostic imaging results suggestive of renal neoplasia (i.e. masses or suspected infiltrative processes). Dogs and cats that had undergone R-FNA from Jan 1, 1998 to Dec 31, 2008 were identified by database search. Patient signalment, serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen concentration, urine specific gravity, dipstick protein, R-FNA result, and final diagnosis were recorded. Patients were excluded if abdominal radiographs or sonographic images were not available for review, or if diagnostic test results were insufficient for determination of final diagnosis. A single coauthor blinded to final diagnoses interpreted all abdominal images using a pre-set list of descriptors and grading criteria. Radiographic kidney shape, margin distortion, and ventrodorsal kidney-to-L2 ratio were evaluated. Sonographic kidney margin distortion, cortical echogenicity, and corticomedullary junction distinction were described, and presence of nodules or masses, peri-renal effusion, or a peripheral sonolucent rim was noted. Concordance of R-FNA and final diagnosis was determined, and the chi-squared or Fisher's exact test were used to determine association of concordance with the above variables; P o 0.05 was considered significant. 37 dogs and 41 cats (78 animals) met all inclusion criteria. R-FNA results were concordant with the final diagnosis in 43 (55.1%) patients, discordant in 12 (15.4%) patients, and inadequate for cytologic interpretation in 23 (29.5%) patients. Neoplasia or FIP were the final diagnoses in 19 of 43 (44.2%) and 3 of 43 (7.0%) patients with concordant results, respectively. Renal lymphoma (P 5 0.196), renal carcinoma (P 5 0.364), and renal neoplasia in general (P 5 0.451) were not associated with a higher likelihood of R-FNA and final diagnosis concordance.

Feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD) is a disease with increasing prevalence in private practices and veterinary teaching hospitals.

Although purine uroliths (ammonium urate, sodium urate, xanthine, uric acid, etc.) represent the third most common stone type in cats, purine uroliths have the highest rate of recurrence (13% in 22 months).

No significant differences were found between kidney size and renal function, kidney size and the presence of uroliths, renal mineralization and function or the presence of uroliths and function. The presence of uroliths was significantly associated with hydronephrosis. Of the 30 cats with at least one large kidney, 9 (30%) had hydronephrosis.

Fat is an important dietary component, serving both as a source of energy and as a supplier of essential fatty acids (FA). Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) contain intermediate length FA that do not rely on L-carnitine for transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane, bypassing this rate-limiting step in FA oxidation. Longchain (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) from fish oil (FO), and in particular eicosanoids derived from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), may protect against excessive inflammatory reactions, which may be exacerbated by eicosanoids derived from (n-6) arachidonic acid (AA).

Studying food base excess (BE) modification, methionine intoxication was described. In a basal kibble dog diet (BE 5 305 mEq/kg; 1.98 g/kg of S) two dosages of ammonium sulphate and Methionine was added, resulting in diets with BE of 135 mEq/kg (4.26 g/kg of S) and \u00c051 mEq/kg (6.65 g/kg of S), or BE of 142 mEq/kg (4.68 g/kg of S) and 4 mEq/kg (7.49 g/kg of S), respectively. A 2 \u00c2 2 factorial plus a control diet design, resulting in five treatments, and 32 adult health beagle dogs were used, in a completed randomized design with six dogs per diet. A 5-d adaptation phase followed 3-d of total urine collection (in bottles with 100 mg of thymol). Urine were pooled by dog and analyzed for density, volume and pH. Food macroelements were determined by standards methods (AOAC, 1995) and used for BE calculation. Dog's acid-basic status was studied by blood gas analysis of venous blood, at 8:00h (pre feeding) and 6 hours after meal. A dose-dependent reduction of urinary pH was verified for both compounds (P o 0.01). Blood bicarbonate (r 5 0.98; P o 0.01), and blood base excess (r 5 0.75; P o 0.01) were highly correlated with food BE. Acidemia and reduced blood BE were verified in diets with BE close to zero (higher dose of both compounds, or 4 6.6 g/kg of S), resulting in daily or each other day vomiting episodes in the dogs. Ataxia, seizures, and vomiting were previously describe in dogs fed 47 g/kg of methionine, but our results suggest that a much lower value (27.7 g/kg) was toxic and that the safe upper limit should be between this value and 15.7 g/kg (the lower evaluated dose). In people with chronic kidney disease and heart failure, obesity is associated with longer survival times. This association, called the \"obesity paradox,\" also has been recognized in dogs and cats with heart failure.

In humans, several disease conditions exist that involve abnormal patterns of polyunsaturated fatty acids and similar abnormalities may be present in companion animals. Indeed there have been reports of decreased plasma arachidonic acid and reduced delta-6 desaturase activities in dogs with atopy and other skin disorders. The present study investigated serum fatty acid profiles in dogs and cats presented to the Texas A&M University Veterinary Teaching Hospital, Clinical Pathology Laboratory over the past one year period. Results were compared with normative data generated among dogs and cats from earlier feeding studies. Sera used were residual samples submitted to the laboratory for other diagnostic procedures and stored frozen for no more than 2 months after collection. The samples were grouped according to presenting disorders involving liver, kidney, digestive, and cardiac diseases. Total lipids were extracted using chloroform:methanol (2:1 v/v) and fatty acid methyl esters were prepared for capillary gas chromatography. Relative percentage distribution of individual serum fatty acids for each animal were then compared with average normative serum phospholipid fatty acid values (dogs, n 5 44; cats, n 5 29) by calculating the ratio of the value in the diseased individual to the normal mean value and used as an index of normalcy. Normalcy ratios were then plotted on a logarithmic scale with normal at 1.0. The ratio was then compared to changes greater than 3, 2 and 1 standard deviations of the normal mean values. In this way a graphical presentation of resultant values was obtained. Although the animals had been fed various commercial diets and some home-prepared foods, a number of noteworthy patterns emerged from this analysis. Dogs showed increased linoleic acid, decreased arachidonic acid, increased total monounsaturated and decreased saturated fatty acids at P o 0.001; oleic acid was increased at p o 0.01. Remarkably, these findings were similar for all canine disease categories evaluated (n 5 30, heart; n 5 17, kidney; n 5 28, liver, and n 5 28 digestive disorders). In cats, a slight decrease in arachidonic acid and large decrease in 22:0 was observed but only in heart disorders. By contrast, modest elevations of arachidonate were observed in kidney, liver, and digestive disease groups but at p o 0.01. Sample sizes of the feline sera were considerably smaller (range of 4-13 per group). A limitation of this analysis is that variability of normal data may exist depending on diet fed making comparisons less reliable However, these preliminary data suggest that metabolic diseases of dogs may depress plasma arachidonic acid independent of diet fed suggesting either reduced conversion from linoleic acid or increased utilization of arachidonate for eicosanoid production during times of metabolic stress. Conversely, in cats, increases in arachidonic acid may be associated with diet arachidonate or other mechanisms. Additional studies to verify these findings are warranted.

Class II major histocompatibility expression is a significant and independent predictor of prognosis in human B cell lymphoma. Low class II MHC is consistently associated with poorer outcome. The mechanism underlying this relationship is not clear, but one hypothesis is that high class II MHC allows for better antigen presentation and tumor-specific immune responses. In the this study, we investigated whether that class II MHC expression in canine B cell lymphoma was associated with remission and survival times. A total of 160 patients were categorized by level of class II MHC,expression of CD34 and cell size for on neoplastic B cells. Multivariable Cox-proportional hazard analysis was used investigate this research question using a randomly selected subset of the data, and the predictive ability of this model was validated on the remaining 1/3 of patient data. Results suggested that low class II MHC expression was associated with decreased times to relapse and death as is seen in human B cell lymphoma, and that large neoplastic cells were associated with decreased survival time. CD34 expression was not associated with patient outcomes. These findings have implications for the use of dogs to model human lymphomas, for the study of tumor vaccines, and for prediction of mortality in dogs with B cell lymphoma with a high level of specificity. One of the reasons for the failure of canine lymphoma treatment is related to the resistance of tumor cells against chemotherapy drugs. The major form of this resistance is provide by multidrug resistance ABC transporters. ABC transporters proteins comprise a large superfamily of transmembrane proteins, ATP-dependent, that extrude a large variety of drugs from the cells. Multidrug resistance phenotype in cancer cells is associated with overexpression of these transmembrane proteins. ABCG2, also known as BCRP, is a 655 residue half-transporter protein that protect hematopoetic stem cells against toxic compounds. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of BCRP (ABCG2) in canine multicentric lymphoma. Samples were collected by fine needle aspiration of an enlarged lymph nodes, from 25 dogs with multicentric lymphoma (stage III to V) at diagnosis, and 8 normal lymph nodes (control). Dogs that were previously treated with prednisone or chemotherapy were excluded from the study. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to measure the mRNA expression level of BCRP and FLNB expression as a endogenous reference canine gene. A widely range expression value for ABCG2 expression was found for canine multicentric lymphoma. High gene expression was observed in 52% (13/25) canine lymphoma, but 48% of dogs had a lower expression when compared with normal lymph node. Gene expression was not associated with clinical staging, complete or partial remission, relapse and survival time.

Osteosarcoma (OSA), the most frequent primary malignant bone tumor of dogs, is both locally aggressive and highly metastatic. Prognostic factors for canine OSA include tumor location, distant metastatic disease, and serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) concentration. An increased serum ALP concentration is associated with poor prognosis; however the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are currently unclear. During normal bone development ALP may be used as a marker for osteoblasts. Additionally, ALP is a downstream target of activated canonical Wnt/b-catenin signaling. Therefore, we hypothesized that increased serum ALP would be associated with increased expression of b-catenin in canine OSA.

Infection control practices in veterinary clinics and hospitals are becoming increasingly important, with rising client expectations, growing concern about the spread of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, and the potential for zoonotic transmission of disease.

Taking all reasonable precautions to reduce the risk of surgical site infections, beginning with preoperative preparation of the surgeon and patient, is therefore an important part of any infection control program.

The way in which medical and behavioral elements are linked (if at all) remain unknown but deserve further investigation. Considered as a semi-social species, domestic cats appear to be highly sensitive to the effects of social stress, especially when living in high density populations. Cats are capable of adapting to live ingroup; nonetheless, they do not appreciate living in close proximity with others as result of an environment lacking of great opportunities of escaping and hiding.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ABSTRACT"}, {"text": "This study aimed at testing the following hypotheses: (A) owners' perceived quality of life affects cats' global levels of stress; (B) cats' global levels of stress are influenced by cats' personality; (C) cats' living style (single housing versus large group housing) does affect stress levels in cats.

In dogs, RAAS activation is a major feature of congestive heart failure (CHF). Benazepril (Fortekor s ) is a potent ACE inhibitor with well-documented effectiveness in canine CHF. Although ACE activity (ACE A ) has been used in preclinical studies as a surrogate marker of efficacy, some authors have reported a poor correlation between plasma ACE A and changes in angiotensin II (AII) or aldosterone (AL). The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of benazepril on canine plasma renin activity/concentration (PRA/PRC), angiotensin I (AI), AII, AL, and fractional excretion of potassium (UfeK), sodium (UfeNa) and aldosterone (UfeAL). Sixteen beagle dogs were fed a low-sodium diet and dosed with placebo or benazepril tablets (10 mg PO, q24h) for 5 days. Blood and urine samples were collected on day 1 (D1) and day 5 (D5) over 24-hour periods. Data were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA of baseline corrected values, and ANOVA of AUC 24hours . Compared with placebo, benazepril induced a significant increase in PRA and AI at D1 (p-value [PRA] :0.001, p-value [AI] :0.002) and D5 (p-value [PRA] :0.001, p-value [AI] o 0.001). No differences in PRC were noticed. Based on AUC 24hours, AII levels were 34% lower in the benazepril group at D5 (p-value [AII] :0.01). UfeAL and AL decreased by up to 27% and 24% at D1 and D5, respectively, though differences did not reach statistical significance. Benazepril markedly influences RAAS dynamics in dogs. Decreased exposure to AII and AL are likely to be the key events required to counteract pathological remodeling of the heart in CHF.

Doxycycline hyclate is used frequently in small animals, horses and exotic animals for treatment of a wide variety of infections. Because doxycycline hyclate tablets may not be suitable for oral administration in some animals, particularly horses and cats, it has been compounded into liquid suspensions. The commercially available doxycycline calcium 10 mg/ml oral suspension, Vibramycin s (Pfizer) is not suitable for use in animals due to its low concentration and flavoring that animals find unpalatable. Because of the known inherent instability of doxycline in aqueous vehicles under storage, this study was conducted to determine the potency of two formulations stored in dark and light conditions. A high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay with UV absorption at 350 nm was developed for analyzing doxycycline in formulations, in comparison to a reference standard from the United States Pharmacopeia (USP). Doxycycline hyclate 100 mg tablets were first tested for potency. The tablets were then crushed and mixed with a pharmaceutical vehicle to make two concentrations: 33.3 mg/mL and 166.7 mg/mL. The vehicle used was a 50:50 mixture of a Vehicle for Oral Solution (Ora-Sweet, USP-NF) and Vehicle for Oral Suspension (Ora-Plus, USP-NF). The suspensions were prepared in replicates of 3. Each replicate was divided, with one aliquot stored at room temperature in lighted conditions, and the other aliquot stored at room temperature in the dark. Doxycycline was extracted from the formulations and measured by HPLC at Day 0, 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 . Each replicate was tested and the potency reported as the percent doxycycline relative to the USP reference standard. On Day 0, 1, 4, and 7, the potency of each formulation was within 90-110% of the reference standard (range 93.4-109%). This value is within the accepted range cited in USP o 795 4 on Pharmaceutical Compounding-Non-Sterile Preparations. However, starting at Day 14, the potency declined dramatically and remained low for the tests performed on Day 21 and 28. The potency on Day 14, 21, and 28 was below 20% of the reference standard (range 14-18%). There was also a noticeable change in the quality of the formulation starting on Day 14, and a change in the color of the formulation to a dark brown. These results indicate that when doxycycline hyclate tablets are compounded as a suspension in an aqueous vehicle as described in this study, at 33.3 and 166.7 mg/mL under the storage conditions used in this study, potency of the formulation cannot be assured beyond 7 days. We recommend a beyond-use-day (BUD) of 7 days for formulations prepared and stored at room temperature in light or dark conditions. Therapeutic options for multidrug resistance (MDR) Escherichia coli urinary tract infections (UTI) are limited. Fosfomycin (FOS) tromethamine is an oral, broad-spectrum, cell-wall active, bactericidal drug approved for treatment of uncomplicated UTI in humans. The purpose of this study was to determine time dependency of FOS and the disposition of FOS tromethamine in dogs. Using a randomized, double crossover design, 12 client-owned dogs received FOS sodium IV (40 mg/kg) and FOS tromethamine (PO, 80 mg/kg) either with (n 5 6) or without food (n 5 6). Serum and urine were collected for 24 hr; FOS was quantitated with a bioassay (ATCC E. coli 25922, serum or ATCC Proteus vulgaris 13315, urine). In-vitro killing curves (cell counts through 24 hours) were performed at 0 (control),0.5,1,2,8,16 and 32 x MIC for MDR E. coli canine FOS susceptible (E-test s ) uropathogens. Killing curves indicated FOS to be time dependent. After IV administration, clearance (ml\u00c3kg/hr), volume of distribution (L/kg), elimination half-life (HL; hr) and mean residence time (MRT, hr) were (mean AE sd): 210 AE 104, 0.23 AE 0.15, 0.36 AE 0.19, 1.14 AE 0.35 and 1.7 AE 0.4, respectively.

A non-specific hepatic isozyme inducer such as rifampin could increase the formation of the active metabolite of clopidogrel thereby increasing the pharmacodynamic response which may allow a reduced drug dose to achieve a clinical effect. We have previously presented data supporting the increased pharmacodynamic response of clopdiogrel after rifampin therapy.

Equine pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) is a common endocrinopathy of aged horses that results from neurodegeneration of the dopaminergic periventricular neurons that innervate the intermediate lobe of the pituitary. Factors that initiate spontaneous dopaminergic neurodegenerative disease remain elusive, however accumulation of misfolded a-synuclein protein and dysfunctional protein clearance have been implicated. Misfolded protein accumulation occurs due to increased protein production or decreased clearance of damaged macromolecules through the process of autophagy.

Eighteen aged ( 4 20 years) mares were randomized to treatment: no therapy (control), oral valacyclovir therapy, or intravenous ganciclovir therapy. Drug administration was initiated at the onset of the second febrile phase, between days 4-6 after EHV-1 inoculation (PI), and continued for one week.

Ciprofloxacin oral tablets, available in a generic formulation for people, are widely used for treatment in dogs. Oral absorption data for ciprofloxacin in dogs has been variable, and too limited to guide accurate dosing. Subsequently, published doses for dogs in veterinary formularies have varied from 5 to 25 mg/kg. This study was undertaken to explore the factors that may affect oral absorption of generic ciprofloxacin in dogs, and to derive a pharmacokinetic-based dose for treating susceptible bacteria. Six healthy adult beagle dogs were used for the study (11.2 kg mean weight). After placing jugular vein catheters for collecting blood samples, these dogs were administered either a single oral dose of ciprofloxacin (250 mg tablet; mean dose 23 mg/kg), or an intravenous (IV) dose (10 mg/kg; 2 mg/mL solution). A randomized crossover design was used with a washout time between treatments. Blood was collected for plasma drug analysis for 24 hours. Ciprofloxacin concentration in plasma was analyzed using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and pharmacokinetics analyzed using a computer program. Oral absorption was also evaluated via deconvolution analysis. The oral dose was well-tolerated, but the IV dose produced transient vomiting and depression in some dogs. After the oral dose, the peak plasma concentration (C MAX ) was 4.4 mg/ mL (CV 55.9%), terminal half-life (t1/2) 2.6 hr (CV 10.8%), AUC 22.5 mg \u00c1 hr/mL (CV 62.3%), and systemic absorption (F) 63.7% (CV 41.6%). After the IV dose, the t1/2 was 3.7 hr (CV 52.3%), systemic clearance 0.587 L/kg/hr (CV 33.9%), and volume of distribution 2.39 L/kg (CV 23.7%). After examining the pharmacokinetic results from the oral dose, it was apparent that oral ciprofloxacin was absorbed well in some dogs (approximately 80%), but poorly in others (approximately 30%). To explore the factors that may have affected oral absorption, two high absorbers and two low absorbers were administered an additional oral dose as a 10 mg/mL solution (250 mg total dose) via gastric tube. After administration of the oral solution, the plasma concentrations were more uniform and consistent among dogs. Absorption of the oral solution of ciprofloxacin was 71.0% (CV 7%) with a t1/2 of 3.1 (CV 18.6%) hr and C MAX of 4.67 mg/mL (CV 17.6%). Therefore, it appears that inconsistent oral absorption of ciprofloxacin in some dogs may be formulation-dependent, and affected by tablet dissolution in the canine small intestine. Doses were calculated using the data for oral tablets in these dogs. The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) target was an AUC/ MIC ratio of 100. Because of the wide range in oral absorption of tablets, a dose to reach the PK-PD target ranged from Canine distemper (CD) is a highly contagious, acute or subacute systemic viral disease of dogs and other carnivores which can be controlled efficiently by the use of modified live-virus (MLV) vaccines.

Feline ureteral obstructions are a common urinary dilemma and traditional therapy is associated with substantial morbidity/mortality. Feline nephrostomy tubes are reported as being effective when pelvic drainage is required.

Diabetes Mellitus in cats is very similar to Type II Diabetes in Humans, preceded by a period of insulin resistance.

The use of monoclonal antibodies and antibody fragments to directly target tumor antigens and neutralize their growth factors has shown promising results in human clinical trials. However, these targeted approaches have not been possible in dogs since specific tumor antigens have not been identified, monoclonal antibodies of canine origin are not available and the efficacy of xenogeneic antibodies in the dog is limited by neutralizing antibody responses. To overcome these obstacles, we have generated canine antibody phage display libraries from canine splenocytes. These libraries consist of single chain variable fragments (scFv) comprised of canine variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) immunoglobulin chains displayed on the surface of bacteriophage (Fig. 1) .

We used simple panning techniques to screen canine scFv libraries generated from the spleens of dogs with HSA against canine VEGF and successfully isolated 3 scFv clones that bind and neutralize canine VEGF in vitro. These scFvs are now being taken into a murine model of canine HSA to determine whether they can inhibit tumor growth and metastases. In addition, we have panned the same antigen-experienced scFv phage display libraries against allogeneic primary canine HSA cells of low passage number to isolate canine-derived antibody fragments that can target malignant endothelial cell surface molecules. Early results demonstrate enrichment of scFv phage libraries for malignant endothelial cell binders.

Cyclosporine is a potent immunosuppressive agent used to treat many canine inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases. Cyclosporine has gained popularity as an immunosuppressive agent because of a favorable toxicity profile compared to many other immunosuppressive agents. Optimal dosing regimens for cyclosporine in the dog remain unclear, primarily because standard methods that monitor effectiveness of immunosuppression have not been established. Pharmacokinetic testing is currently used during treatment with oral cyclosporine to adjust doses based on measurement of blood drug levels. Individual patients, however, often demonstrate marked variations in blood drug levels while on similar oral doses of cyclosporine, and can also demonstrate different clinical responses even at comparable drug levels, making correlation of blood cyclosporine levels and degree of disease control extremely difficult. Pharmacodynamic testing offers an alternative method for regulating cyclosporine dosing by objectively measuring the effects of cyclosporine on T-cells, the drug's main cellular target in the body.

Gastro-intestinal (GI) disease frequently results in increased wall thickness in many species. Identification of changes in GI wall thickness using ultrasound has proved to be a useful diagnostic tool and is widely used in human patients, small animals and horses. Although GI motility has been evaluated in cattle, normal reference ranges for wall thickness has not been reported in ruminants. The aims of this study were to report normal values for wall thickness of various GI structures and to assess the repeatability of this technique in adult dairy cows, sheep and goats. Eight healthy adult Holstein Friesian (HF) cattle (656 AE 11 Kg), eight Jersey (J) cattle (458 AE 56 kg), thirteen adult sheep (79 AE 11 Kg) and eleven adult goats (43.5 AE 8 Kg) were recruited and examined on three consecutive days. Ultrasonographic images were optimised for the structure of interest. Structures were identified based upon appearance and anatomical position. A minimum of three cineloops were obtained of the abdominal organs per intercostal space (ICS) and three along the ventral midline in each ICS; images were analysed offline. Data were analysed using ANOVA and post-hoc Bonferoni, Student's Ttest and intra-class correlation coefficients. Each structure was measured per ICS per species; if no differences were noted for structures in different ICS, then measurements were pooled. No differences were noted between HF and J cattle so data were pooled. Data are displayed in table 1.

Passive transfer of maternally derived antibodies via ingestion of good-quality colostrum within the first 24 hours of life is crucial for the health and future productivity of dairy calves.

The heme-associated iron-binding apoprotein lactoferrin (LF) is known for its, anti-inflammatory, anti-parasitic, antimicrobial and bactericidal effects.

We evaluated cardiac reverse remodeling after mitral valve repair under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for mitral regurgitation in small breed dogs. Fifty dogs (body weight 1.8-9.3 kg, age 5-14 years) with mitral regurgitation were treated between August 2006 and November 2009. The cardiac murmur was grade 4/6-6/6. The preoperative chest X-rays showed cardiac enlargement (vertebral heart scale (VHS) 11.0-13.1). Echocardiography showed severe mitral regurgitation and left atrium enlargement (LA/Ao 2.0-4.2). After inducing anesthesia, a thoracotomy was performed in the fifth intercostal space. CPB was started by using a CPB circuit connected to carotid artery and jugular vein catheters. After inducing cardiac arrest, the left atrium was sectioned and chordae tendineae rupture confirmed. The chordae tendineae were replaced with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene. A mitral annulus plasty was also done, and the left atrium was closed. After de-clamping for restarting the heart, the chest was closed. Heart rate decreased from 118-164 bpm to 75-138 bpm. The grade of cardiac murmur was reduced to 0/6-3/6 three months postoperatively, and the heart shadow was reduced (VHS 9.8-11.5) in the chest x-rays. Echocardiography confirmed the marked reduction in mitral regurgitation and the left atrial dimensions (LA/Ao 1.2-2.2). Mitral valve repair reduced enlarged cardiac size by reduction of regurgitant rate. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a well recognized condition in dogs leading to considerable morbidity and mortality. The majority of therapeutics has focused on endothelial dysfunction causing reduced production of vasodilators, such as nitric oxide and prostacyclin, coupled with overproduction of vasoconstrictors, such as endothelin-1. More recently, it has been shown that the mitochondria play an important role in the development of PAH as oxygen sensors and regulators of cellular proliferation. In PAH, pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells undergo a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria to glycolysis in the cytoplasm as the major energy source and this leads to suppression of apoptosis and increased proliferation. Dichloroacetate (DCA) inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase to activate pyruvate dehydrogenase which catalyzes the rate limiting step for entry of pyruvate into the Krebs cycle, thus increasing mitochondrial respiration. In three different rat models of PAH, DCA has been shown prevent and reverse PAH by normalizing molecular pathology, stimulating apoptosis of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, and reducing pulmonary artery hypertrophy. DCA has known toxic effects, including reversible hepatotoxicity and peripheral neuropathy, and has not been studied in any species with naturally occurring PAH. The objective of this open label pilot study is to evaluate the therapeutic and toxic effects of DCA in naturally occurring canine PAH.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ACVIM FORUM SESSION 110B"}, {"text": "Three dogs with PAH diagnosed by Doppler echocardiography and no correctable underlying cause are enrolled in the study.

All 19 NCL-affected Tibetan Terriers were homozygous for the same haplotype which extended for 22 consecutive SNPs spanning 0.95 Mb. None of the 20 annotated genes within this target region had previously been associated with human or rodent NCL. We used DNA from NCL-affected Tibetan Terriers to resequence the coding regions and intron-exon borders of several genes harbored within the target region and found a single base pair deletion, c.1623delG, in exon 16 of positional candidate ATP13A2. This deletion produces a frame shift and a predicted premature termination codon. We genotyped all 454 Tibetan Terrier DNA samples in our collection and found all 45 NCL-affected Tibetan Terriers to be homozygous for the c.1623delG allele. Eleven additional c.1623delG homozygotes were either less than 5 years old, or lost to follow up. There were no known cases of NCL in the remaining 398 Tibetan Terriers which were either heterozygous (n 5 149) or homozygous for the ancestral allele (n 5 249). ATP13A2 is a member of group of ion transport genes and has been associated with lysosomes. Mutations in human ATP13A2 cause Kufor-Rakeb syndrome (KRS), a rare neurodegenerative disorder with clinical features that include parkinsonism plus spasticity, supranuclear upgaze paresis, and dementia. Post-mortem findings in KRS have not been reported. We conclude that NCL in Tibetan terriers is caused by a mutation in ATP13A2. Our results suggest that KRS may be a form of adult onset NCL in humans. Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by dementia and ataxia, hepatic and pulmonary disease, and death typically within the first or second decade. Despite the identification of causative mutations, the pathogenesis is not clear and therapies to successfully treat NPC disease have been ineffective to date. The recent use of intravenously administered 2-hydroxypropylbeta-cyclodextrin (HPBCD), an FDA-designated orphan drug (May 2010), in a small number of children with NPC disease is based on favorable treatment outcome data in subcutaneously treated mouse and cat models. To rigorously evaluate the mechanistic, pharmacologic, and toxicity issues associated with HPBCD therapy in NPC disease, we have utilized the spontaneous feline NPC model harboring a missense mutation in NPC1 (pC955S), orthologous to the most common mutation in juvenile-onset patients. The feline NPC model has clinical, neuropathological and biochemical abnormalities similar to those present in juvenile-onset patients making this model homologous to the most common disease form seen in human patients. We identified that intrathecal administration of HPBCD ameliorated all clinical aspects of neurological disease at least up to 24 weeks of age (an age when untreated cats die) but had no effect on hepatic disease. We identified that while subcutaneous therapy with HPBCD at all doses ameliorated liver disease, only 8000 mg/kg substantially affected neurological disease but also resulted in early death due to pulmonary toxicity. Finally, we identified a dose-related toxic effect of HPBCD on hearing function that had not been described in any other species. Leukodystrophies are disorders of myelin synthesis and maintenance that affect CNS myelin. They are subdivided as leukodystrophies, hypomyelinating disorders and spongy degenerations. Although infrequently seen, several forms have been described in various dog breeds. We present a novel form of complex leukodystrophy consisting of hypomyelination and spongy degeneration that presents primarily with hind end tremors in Border terrier puppies. Three Border terriers from two different litters (and lineages) are described here that presented with a history of shaking movements. The youngest dog was a 3-week old male. It was the only dog affected in the litter. The other two dogs were 6-week old female littermates. There were two unaffected males in the same litter. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities. On neurological examination, the affected dogs displayed severe hind end tremors, with a characteristic swinging side-to-side movement (best described as ''rumpshaker''). The tremors also involved the head and thoracic limbs but to a lesser degree, and disappeared when the dogs were asleep or at rest. Severe cerebellar ataxia was observed when the dogs ambulated. Proprioceptive positioning was delayed in the pelvic limbs of all 3 dogs. Spinal reflexes and nociception appeared normal. Necropsy was performed in all 3 puppies. No macroscopic changes were observed. Histologic evaluation of the CNS revealed spongy degeneration and hypomyelination in all funiculi of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord. White matter of the frontal, temporal and parietal cortices had mild multifocal spongy degeneration and hypomyelination, whereas white matter of the cerebellum, medulla and pons showed severe diffuse spongy degeneration and hypomyelination with gliosis. The combination of reduced myelin formation combined with spongiform white matter changes in the absence of microglial responses suggest a complex pathogenesis affecting both oligodendrocytes' capacity to synthesize myelin and the stability of the myelin that was formed. The number of oligodendrocytes and axons appeared subjectively normal indicating a primarily hypomyelinating process.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ACVIM FORUM SESSION 110B"}, {"text": "The clinical and pathological features of this disease have not been described in any other canine leukodystrophy.

The positive association of the peripheral blood concentrations of ACTH and cortisol depended on disease status of the foals. Specifically, cortisol and ACTH were positively correlated for the septic foals (P 5 0.027) but not significantly correlated in the non-septic foals. Peripheral concentrations of ACTH and IGF-I were not significantly correlated whether data were pooled overall or stratified by sepsis status. However, peripheral concentrations of cortisol and IGF-I were negatively associated (P 5 0.019); disease status did not influence this association, although it appeared to be a stronger association for the septic than the non-septic foals. The negative correlation between serum concentrations of the adrenal axis steroid cortisol and the somatogenic axis peptide IGF-I may reflect interactions of these homeorhetic hormones.

Serum cobalamin concentrations were compared by calculating the odds ratio (OR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) to find breeds with higher proportions of samples with a cobalamin concentration o 251 ng/L (below the reference interval) or o 149 ng/L (below the assay sensitivity) from dog breeds with a minimum of 30 submissions. Breeds with a significantly higher proportion of samples with a serum cobalamin o 150 ng/L were subsequently investigated for proportions of dogs with a serum TLI diagnostic for EPI (o 2.5 mg/ L). Cobalamin submissions were compared to the AKC ranking list of 2009 to find breeds with higher proportions of submissions for serum cobalamin analysis. 28,675 submissions were reviewed.

RM dos Santos, FF Lima Ju\u00b4nior, PH Itikawa, GT Goldfeder, GG Pereira, DAA Costa, CS Oliveira, MHMA Larsson. School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.Systolic blood pressure (SBP) is an important clinical parameter to assess in certain diseases such as hyperthyroidism, chronic renal disease, hyperadrenocorticism and diabetes mellitus. SBP can be measured directly by intra-arterial catheterization or indirectly by Doppler or oscillometric methods. Currently, standardization of SBP in Maine Coon cats (MCC) are not available. This study aimed to provide reference values of SBP in MCC and compare results with those previously described in non Maine Coon cats (NMCC).SBP were obtained in 39 healthy adult MCC. Animals were screened by physical examination, thoracic radiography, electrocardiography, echocardiography and laboratory tests (CBC, biochemical blood urea, creatinine and total T 4 ). In face of normal results, SBP was obtained by ultrasonic Doppler method. Cats were gently restrained in right lateral recumbence, and an adequate neonatal cuff was placed around antebrachium. Five consecutive readings were obtained from each cat, with intervals of 20 seconds between measurements. Unpaired t-test was employed in order to compare data with those obtained in a previous report of SBP values in a population of NMCC.Mean SBP obtained in MCC was 113.74 AE 14.0 mmHg. Higher mean SBP was described in a cat population of NMCC (133.6 AE 16.0 mmHg; p o 0.001).It is suggested that SBP values in normal MCC are lower than reference values for NMCC. Hospital environment and restraining apparently did not represent stress factors. Lower values of SBP in MCC may be related to their good nature and giant body size and should be considered when screening for systemic hypertension.ABSTRACT C-32 ADVANCED ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY CAN PREDICT MI-TRAL REGURGITATION IN CAVALIER KING CHARLES SPANIELS WITH MYXOMATOUS MITRAL VALVE DIS-EASE.

GG Pereira, GT Goldfeder, MHMA Larsson. School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of Sa\u02dco Paulo, SP, Brazil.Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is recognized by reduced contractility. Although often diagnosed in large breed dogs, English Cocker Spaniels (ECS) are quite predisposed. We hypothesized that a pattern of myocardial dysfunction could be characterized in this breed using tissue Doppler techniques.Thirty two ECS were studied, being 16 with DCM and 16 healthy for control purpose. Longitudinal tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) of myocardial systolic, early (E) and late (A) diastolic velocities, time from onset of Q wave to peak systolic velocity (QS interval), Doppler derived strain (St) and strain rate (SR) were obtained in mitral annular left ventricular free wall (LVFW) and interventricular septum (IVS). Radial TDI, QS interval, St and SR were obtained in LVFW at papillary muscle level. Systolic myocardial velocity gradients (MVG) were recorded in longitudinal and radial displacements of LVFW. Systolic TDI and St were obtained from right ventricular wall (RVW). Unpaired Student's t-test was employed to investigate differences between groups.LVFW findings in DCM group, compared to control, included lower longitudinal(5.81 AE 1.82 vs. 7.07 AE 1.41 cm/s; p o 0.05) and radial (4.69 AE 1.10 vs. 5.92 AE 1.45 cm/s; p o 0.05) systolic myocardial velocities, increased longitudinal (114.26 AE 14.26 vs. 93.95 AE 6.42 ms; p o 0.001) and radial (115.17 AE 13.78 vs. 92.91 AE 14.53 ms; p o 0.001) QS interval, reduced systolic longitudinal (11.21 AE 8.50 vs. 23.8 AE 3.38%; p o 0.001) and radial (27.17 AE 8.99 vs. 44.70 AE 6.46%; p o 0.001) St and reduced longitudinal (1.71 AE 0.24 vs. 2.87 AE 0.58 s -1 ; p o 0.001) and radial (2.07 AE 0.66 vs. 2.59 AE 0.70 s -1 ; p o 0.05) SR. MVG was lower in LVFW longitudinal (0.90 AE 0.41 vs. 1.44 AE 0.21; p o 0.001) and radial (1.11 AE 0.46 vs. 1.66 AE 0.29; p o 0.01) displacements in DCM group. Post-systolic contractions were found in IVS of 5/16 dogs with DCM. Reduced systolic St were found in RVW (18.81 AE 5.05 vs. 26.72 AE 5.33%; p o 0.001). E/A ratio lower than 1 was the most common diastolic abnormality found in both ventricles.

Systematic studies comparing abdominal MRI and abdominal ultrasound techniques in dogs with AGAAS are absent. The aim of this retrospective study was to directly compare the efficacy of abdominal ultrasound and abdominal MRI techniques in detecting abdominal lymphadenopathy in dogs with AGAAS. Sixteen dogs with histologically confirmed AGAAS had abdominal ultrasound and abdominal MRI. Abdominal ultrasound detected lymphadenopathy in 8 out of 16 dogs. Abdominal MRI detected lymphadenopathy in 14 out of 16 dogs. 50% of abdominal MRI detected lymphadenopathy was identified on abdominal ultrasound. This data indicates that MRI is significantly more sensitive than ultrasound for detecting lymphadenopathy in dogs with AGAAS. As such, MRI should be considered in any patient with AGAAS to more reliably stage the disease, particularly when accurate characterization of the extent and distribution affects therapeutic planning.

The most common cause is urethral sphincter mechanism incompetency (USMI). Pharmacological agents are effective, however, not all dogs respond, and dogs may become refractory to treatment over time. Urethral bulking, where a compound is injected submucosally in the urethra, has been used in women and in female dogs with urinary incontinence. New synthetic compounds have been used in human medicine; the most promising is Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which has been shown to be more effective than glutaraldehyde cross-linked collagen. The purpose of this descriptive clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of PDMS urethral bulking agent (PDMS UBA) in client-owned, spayed female dogs with naturally-occurring UI due to USMI.Twenty-two, spayed female dogs were included. Dogs had a median age of 6 years (2 to 11 years). Eighteen dog breeds were represented, and dogs weighed a median of 29.9 kg (7.3 to 62.7 kg). Average length of time of UI was 2.5 AE 2.3 years; 18/22 dogs had been treated medically, of which 2/18 were continent, 14/18 were improved, and 2/18 had no improvement. Dogs were deemed healthy based on results of physical examination, complete blood cell counts, plasma biochemical analysis, and urinalysis; urine cultures were negative.Dogs were anesthetized, positioned in dorsal recumbency, and cystoscopy performed using a 2.7 mm, 0-or 30-degree, 18 cm rigid cystoscope. Urethral bulking was performed with PDMS UBA. On average, 2.5 AE 0.9 ml were injected in 3 to 5 locations approximately 1 to 1.5 cm distal to the trigone submucosally in the proximal urethra. Good coaptation was achieved in all dogs. The procedure took on average 15.9 AE 4.3 minutes. One dog experienced urethral obstruction after the procedure; a Foley catheter was inserted for approximately 12 hours and removed at which time she urinated normally and was continent. Three dogs experienced an acute allergic reaction characterized by blepharedema and urticaria treated successfully with diphenhydramine. Dogs were discharged on day of procedure except for the one dog that experienced urethral obstruction. All dogs were treated with Meloxicam (0.1 mg/kg PO q24h for 3 days).Owners were contacted on day after discharge and 21/22 dogs were continent; 1/22 dogs was improved. Dogs were re-evaluated 1 week after discharge and 21/22 dogs were continent and 1/22 dogs Polyneuropathy in large breed dogs is a relatively common clinical problem for which the genetic basis is generally unknown. The first cases of polyneuropathy in the Leonberger breed (Leonberger polyneuropathy or LPN) were identified in 1999 by one of the authors (GDS) and a report published in 2003 (MuscleNerve 27:471-477) . In this report a spontaneous, distal and symmetrical polyneuropathy with onset between 1 to 9 years of age was described and characterized clinically, electrophysiologically, histologically and morphometrically. There were striking similarities between LPN and the Charcot-Marie-Tooth group of human inherited sensory and motor polyneuropathies, which have many known genetic mutations.A genome-wide case-control association study for LPN was performed with 53 cases and 42 controls on high-density 170K canine SNP arrays and revealed a significantly associated region on CFA 16 (P raw 5 2.36 \u00c2 10 \u00c010 P genome 5 9.99 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 ). A clear association of an approximately 1 Mb CFA16 haplotype with cases (P 5 1.71 \u00c2 10 \u00c08 ) was observed, particularly with those cases that were affected more severely and at a younger age (P 5 2.55 \u00c2 10 \u00c011 ). A positional candidate gene, ARHGEF10, which has previously been associated with peripheral nerve abnormalities in humans, was sequenced, revealing a deletion that results in a frame shift and premature stop codon. Of all Leonbergers with young onset LPN (before 4 years), 48.5% (32 of 66) have two copies of this deletion, and, of all young onset Leonbergers that are nerve biopsy positive for LPN, 59.4% (19 of 32) have two copies of this deletion. Importantly, nearly all dogs carrying two copies of the deletion (32 of 34 or 94.1%) are affected with LPN by the age of 4 years.The Leonberger breed was generated from crossing several breeds, including the St. Bernard, and a polyneuropathy clinically and histologically similar to LPN occurs in this breed. To determine if the ARHGEF10 mutation was associated with polyneuropathy in the St. Bernard, DNA was extracted from archived frozen muscle biopsy specimens from clinical cases (n 5 3). The identical ARHGEF10 Startle disease or hyperekplexia is caused by defects in mammalian glycinergic neurotransmission resulting in an exaggerated startle reflex and extensor hypertonia triggered by noise or touch. In humans and animals, startle disease is typically caused by mutations in one of three genes (GLRA1, GLRB, and SLC6A5) encoding postsynaptic glycine receptor subunits (a1 and b) or a presynaptic glycine transporter (GlyT2). A litter of seven Irish Wolfhounds was recently identified in which two puppies developed muscle stiffness and tremor beginning at 5-7 days of age post-partum. Signs were dramatic when the puppies were handled and resolved when the puppies were relaxed or sleeping. Both puppies were euthanized due to ongoing stiffness, tremor and breathing difficulties. Necropsies were performed, but no microscopic pathological abnormalities were identified in the peripheral or central nervous system.Based on the clinical signs, exons from the three candidate genes were amplified from genomic DNA isolated using PCR and directly sequenced. No deleterious polymorphisms were identified in either GLRA1 or GLRB. However, difficulties were experienced in amplifying SLC6A5 exons 2 and 3 from affected animals, although control samples were positive, suggesting that the PCR primer designs and conditions were not at fault. Further PCRs revealed that the reason for this anomaly was the presence of a homozygous 4.2 kb deletion encompassing exons 2 and 3 of the GlyT2 gene in both affected animals. This deletion is predicted to result in the loss of part of the large cytoplasmic N-terminus that is vital for trafficking of GlyT2 to synaptic sites, and a loss of all subsequent transmembrane domains via a frameshift. This genetic lesion was confirmed by defining the deletion breakpoint, Southern blotting and Multiplex Ligationdependent Probe Amplification (MLPA). This analysis enabled the development of a rapid genotyping test that revealed heterozygosity for the deletion in the dam and sire and three other siblings, suggesting recessive inheritance of this disorder. Wider testing of related animals has identified a total of 18 carriers of the SLC6A5 deletion and enabled the identification of non-carrier animals to guide future breeding strategies. Insulin resistance (IR), obesity, and type 2 diabetes affect glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) concentrations in humans and rodents, but this incretin hormone has not been examined in horses. We therefore hypothesized that GLP-1 concentrations would change in horses as obesity and IR were induced or exacerbated by overfeeding. Six horses previously diagnosed with Equine Metabolic Syndrome were provided with twice the amount of digestible energy required for maintenance as sweet feed and hay for 8 weeks. Intravenous and oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) were performed at 0 and 8 weeks. Effects of time and period (0 and 8 weeks) were assessed by repeated measures ANOVA.Mean body weight increased from 438 AE 61 kg (range, 381 to 533 kg) to 464 AE 61 kg (range, 394 to 550 kg) over 8 weeks, with individual horse weight gain varying from 2 to 10%. Mean body condition score increased (P 5 0.006) from 6 AE 2 (range, 4 to 8.5) to 8 AE 1 (range, 7 to 9). Three horses developed mild laminitis. Glucagon-like peptide 1 concentrations increased over time during OGTTs (P 5 0.023), but the period \u00c2 time effect was not significant (P 5 0.141). Area under the GLP-1 curve remained unaffected by weight gain, whereas area under the insulin curve increased (P 5 0.003) over time, indicating a reduction in insulin sensitivity. Obesity and IR were induced or exacerbated when horses previously diagnosed with EMS were overfed, but GLP-1 concentrations did not change as a result. Hypertonic saline solution (7.2%) (HSS) is an intravenous fluid used for the emergency treatment of intravascular volume deficits. The use of this fluid in horses with severe dehydration is controversial. The purpose of this study was to compare the use of HSS and isotonic saline solution (0.9%) (ISS) for the emergency treatment of endurance horses.Endurance horses eliminated from competition and requiring intravenous fluid therapy were eligible for enrollment in the study. Twenty-two horses were randomly assigned to receive 4 ml/kg of either HSS or ISS along with 5 L lactate Ringer's solution (LRS). Following this bolus, all horses were treated with an additional 10L of LRS. Blood and urine samples were collected before, during and after treatment. Data was compared using two-way ANOVA with repeated measures.As compared to ISS, HSS horses showed a greater decrease in PCV (p 5 0.04), total protein (p 5 0.01), albumin (p 5 0.01), and globulin (p 5 0.02). HSS horses showed a greater increase in sodium and chloride (p o 0.001) as compared to ISS horses. Horses receiving HSS had a shorter time to urination (p 5 0.03) and lower specific gravity (p o 0.001) than those receiving ISS.Results of this study indicate that HSS may provide faster restoration of intravascular volume deficits than ISS in endurance horses receiving emergency medical treatment. More profound electrolyte changes should be expected with HSS however. b 2 -adrenergic receptor agonists have been shown to increase erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase activity, which may stimulate the Jacobs-Stewart cycle and increase pulmonary circulation transvascular fluid fluxes during exercise. Increase in pulmonary transvascular fluid fluxes (J V-A ) and consequent increase in the pulmonary interstitial fluid would be detrimental for alveolar O 2 exchange during the fast erythrocyte transition time across the pulmonary capillaries. Therefore, we hypothesised that treatment with inhaled b 2 -adrenergic receptor agonist will increase J V-A and the alveolar-arterial PO 2 difference (AaDO 2 ) during exercise.Six STB horses were exercised on a high-speed treadmill at 80% VO 2 peak until fatigue. Horses were randomly assigned to treatment with salbutamol (Sal: 500mcg) or placebo (Control: Con) inhalation via Aeromask \u00c3 60 min prior to exercise, with cross over treatment used at the repeated exercise test (8 days later). Arterial and mixedvenous blood, as well as CO 2 elimination and O 2 uptake, were sampled simultaneously at rest, during exercise at 60 sec intervals until fatigue, and into recovery. Blood gases were analyzed. AaDO 2 was calculated using the inspired PO 2 (149 mmHg), and blood partial pressure of O 2 and CO 2 . Blood volume (%) changes across the lung were calculated from changes in hemoglobin and hematocrit values in venous and arterial blood. Cardiac output (Q) was calculated using the Fick equation. J V-A was calculated using Q and blood volume changes across the lung. Variables were analyzed using two-way repeated-measures ANOVA (P o 0.05).The duration of exercise to fatigue was 4.3 AE 0.3 min and 4.4 AE 0.4 min in both Con and Sal, respectively. At rest Sal had no effect on J V-A , oxygen consumption (VO 2 ), blood oxygen saturation (SO 2 ) or AaDO 2 (P40.05). At the onset of exercise J V-A increased in Con and Sal (P o 0.0001) and at fatigue reached 10.0 AE 2.4 L/min and 10.0 AE 1.6 L/min, respectively. Treatment with Sal had no effect on J V-A during exercise (P 5 0.9). At the onset of exercise SO 2 and VO 2 increased in Con and Sal (P o 0.0001). Treatment with Sal had no effect on SO 2 or VO 2 during exercise (P40.05). AaDO 2 increased during exercise in Con and Sal (P o 0.0001) and at fatigue reached 19.4 AE 2.3 mmHg and 18.1 AE 2.4 mmHg, respectively. Treatment with Sal had no effect on AaDO 2 during exercise (P 5 0.3).Inhaled b 2 -adrenergic receptor agonist salbutamol at the dose of 500mcg given 60 min before exercise did not affect the duration of exercise to fatigue, J V-A , VO 2 , SO 2 or AaDO 2 . Therefore, it had no detrimental effect on alveolar-capillary diffusion distance and the ventilation/perfusion mismatch in exercising horses. Inflammatory Airway Disease (IAD) and recurrent airway obstruction (RAO) represent two classes of equine lung inflammatory diseases that may share some similar immunologic mechanisms. There is evidence that Th2 cytokines and IL-17 play some role in RAO. IAD is a common condition in horses, but its pathophysiology is still not understood. The aim of the present study was therefore to determine the mRNA expression of Th1, Th2 and Th17 inflammatory cytokines, to understand the immunological mechanisms of IAD.The mRNA expression of ten inflammatory cytokines and chemokines was measured in the bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) of seventeen horses with IAD and compared with ten control horses. The horses were selected based on 1-their clinical signs, 2-the inflammatory cells count in the BALF, 3-their physical examination and 4-their medical history. The mRNA expression of IL-5, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 was significantly up-regulated in BALF from horses with IAD.Furthermore, the BALF samples were subdivided in two groups based on the differential cells count 1-BALF with increased mast cells (IAD-Mast) and 2-BALF with increased neutrophils (IAD-Neutro). IL-4 was significantly down-regulated in the IAD-Neutro group compared to the IAD-Mast group. IL-17, IL-5 and IL-8 were significantly up-regulated in the IAD-Neutro group compared to the IAD-Mast group.The present study shows that IAD in horses is characterized by a Th2 and a Th17 mRNA inflammatory expression profile and that different immunological mechanisms are involved in mast cells or neutrophils accumulation in the BALF of horses with IAD. b 2 -adrenoreceptor (b 2 -AR) agonists are a class of medications that promote smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation in horses and humans with airway disease. Activated human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) also respond to b 2 -AR agonist stimulation by attenuating the production of cytokines associated with the pathogenesis of asthma and Recurrent Airway Obstruction (RAO). The aim of this study was to develop an in vitro technique for measuring the response of equine PBLs to stimulation with Salbutamol, a b 2 -AR agonist. This method was then used to compare the response of PBLs from RAO-affected and non-affected horses to b 2 -AR agonist stimulation. PBLs from 4 RAO and 4 nonaffected horses were cultured (4x10 6 /ml) in RPMI complete media with Concanavalin A (ConA, 2ug/10 6 cells) for 0, 1, or 2 days then stimulated with Salbutamol (30 minutes). Using flow cytometric techniques, response was measured by detecting protein kinase A phosphorylation of vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). Results were verified by western blot analysis. Activated PBLs were then incubated with ConA for one day were pre-incubated with b 2 or b-adrenoreceptor antagonist (ICI 118,551, Sigma s ; Atenolol, Sigma s ) for 15 minutes, followed by 30 minutes Salbutamol (500 nM) stimulation. Results were analyzed by ANOVA or ANCOVA and differences were considered significant when p o 0.05.Response to b-antagonist was only observed in activated PBLs (pre-cultured with Con A) and was greater in cells from RAO horses as compared to cells from non-affected horses. The addition of b-antagonist attenuated the response of PBLs to Salbutamol while the addition of a b 1 -antagonist had no effect. These findings indicate that activated PBLs from RAO-affected horses have a greater response to Salbutamol as compared to PBLs from non-affected horses, and this response is mediated mainly through the b 2 -AR.Human b 2 -AR are known be polymorphic and this polymorphism results in a variable response to b 2 -agonist binding that affects long term outcome in human asthmatics. Further studies are required to determine if the difference in response of PBLs from RAO affected as compared to non-affected horses is due to genetic polymorphism in the equine b 2 -AR, and whether this difference is associated with a propensity for horses to develop equine RAO.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2755, "end": 2784, "text": "2003 (MuscleNerve 27:471-477)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "annex"}]}
