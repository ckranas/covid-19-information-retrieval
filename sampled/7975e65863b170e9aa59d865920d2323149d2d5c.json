Medication adherence is affected by both practical barriers and patient's beliefs about medication. However, physicians also have their beliefs about medication. Several studies have shown that these beliefs also impact the decision of patients to agree with a particular treatment or not. As current published interventions on medication adherence (which focus predominantly on patients) are not or just partly effective, physicians' beliefs might be a promising target for interventions to improve adherence. However, there is currently no information available on physician's beliefs about statins and whether these beliefs affect patient's beliefs and adherence. Therefore, the objective of this study is to examine whether physicians' beliefs about statins influence the beliefs and adherence of patients using a statin. Setting and method: This cross-sectional study was conducted in GP practices and community pharmacies, between September 3, 2014 and March 20, 2015. Physicians' and patients' beliefs about statins were assessed with the Beliefs about Medicine Questionnaire (BMQ) specific. Patients' adherence on statins was assessed with both the MARS-5 and the Morisky-8 questionnaires.",

The Community pharmacist (CP) is often the first healthcare professional patients visit after discharge. CPs lack sufficient information about the patient and so they may be unable to identify problems in medications, which may lead to dispensing the wrong drugs or dosage, and/or giving wrong information. We aim to assess the impact of a complex intervention comprising of medication reconciliation performed at discharge by a hospital pharmacist (HP) with communication between the HP and CP on DRPs during the 7 days following discharge. Setting and method: Cluster randomized crossover trial involving medical and surgery care units (each unit corresponding to a cluster) in French hospitals during two consecutive 14-day periods, randomly assigned as 'experimental'(E) or 'control' C (usual care) periods. During the experimental period, the HP performed a medication reconciliation that was communicated to the patient's CP. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was a composite outcome of any kind of DRP (prescription/dispensation, gap or patient) during the 7 days following discharge assessed at day seven post-discharge by phone from patient and CP. The secondary outcomes were 1/unplanned hospitalizations assessed by phone contact at day 35 after discharge and 2/the iatrogenic potential exposure scale from 0 to 3 for each patient established by a clinical team. Analysis was conducted in intention to treat. Results: 22 hospitals corresponding to 48 clusters enrolled 1092 patients (536 E group v/s 548 C Group). No difference was observed on age, sex, autonomy, and number of drugs in home medication at admission and discharge. At day 7; 236 (45.6%) patients in E group had at least one DRP v/s 280 (52.6%) in C group (OR 0.77; IC 95% [0.61; 0.98] p = 0.034). Intervention was especially efficient for patient discharged from surgery unit (OR 0.64 IC 95% [0.43; 0.94]) and aged less than 75 years (OR 0.71 IC 95% [0.53; 0.94] . Although intervention decreased patient exposure to DRP with high iatrogenic potential (from 8.7 to 5.2% p \\ 0.0006), un-planned hospitalizations at day 35 weren't different between groups (5.8 vs. 4.5% p = 0.50).",

Additionally, only half (12 of 23) of the municipalities have a local pharmacy. Traditionally, Namsos and Levanger Hospital Pharmacies have performed quality audits of the implementation of drug administration procedures in primary care units. Since 2013, a service where clinical pharmacists participate in multidisciplinary medication reviews in 19 municipalities throughout the county has been established. The objective of this poster is to describe the practical approach and design of the service. Design: A descriptive report of an implemented clinical pharmacy service in primary care where clinical pharmacists, as part of multidisciplinary teams, perform medication reviews. Results: Medication reviews are performed on patients admitted to nursing homes and patients in home care, receiving help with handling of their drugs. Primary care nurses prioritise patients (by selecting frail elderly with multiple co-morbidities and polypharmacy), usually five patients in each meeting. Prior to the review, nurses collect medical information using a checklist including; diagnosis, drug-related symptoms, standard laboratory tests and an updated medication list. The clinical pharmacist receives de-identified medical information by postal mail or e-mail before the meeting. Based on this information the pharmacist identifies possible drugrelated problems (DRPs) and provides recommendations on how to solve them. This is performed in a structured approach according to the Integrated Medicine Management (IMM) model. Subsequently, the pharmacist visits the municipality and discusses the medication reviews in a multidisciplinary team meeting with nurses and physicians. In addition, the pharmacist gives lectures in a medication related topic (e.g. treatment of insomnia and anxiety, oral anticoagulants and cognitive side effects). Following the meeting, the pharmacist reports the DRPs and suggested interventions to the multidisciplinary team, for further follow-up. During 2015, totally 220 medication reviews were performed in 19 municipalities. In the same period, 25 lectures were given by the clinical pharmacists. Conclusion: This clinical pharmacy service enables multidisciplinary medication reviews even in municipalities with limited health professionals and resources. As a part of multidisciplinary teams, the clinical pharmacists contribute with medical competence.",

Setting and method: A monocentric prospective study was conducted between July 2015 and November 2015 in a 1500-bed University Hospital. Each daptomycin prescription recorded by pharmacy department was analysed by an infectious diseases specialist in the presence of the prescriber and considering local guidelines and the patient's clinical conditions. Main outcome measures: The indicators chosen to determine prescription pertinence were: treatment indication, prescribed dose and other antibiotics associated with the daptomycin prescription. Results: 20 daptomycin prescriptions were analysed. Observed indications were: sepsis (35%), infective endocarditis (25%), bone and joint infections (25%) and vascular prosthetic infections (10%). Identified pathogens were: MRSA (35%), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (25%), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (10%), enterococci (10%) and methicillinsensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci (5%). Daptomycin was prescribed as first-line treatment in 50% of cases. The mean dose was 7 mg/kg/day [3-10 mg/kg/day] for a mean duration of 17 days [2; 55 days] . Local guidelines were followed in 20% of cases. Daptomycin use was relevant for 70% of prescriptions. The irrelevant prescriptions triggered the modification or stoppage of antibiotic therapy in 50% of cases, respectively, generating an 18% decrease in consumption and an economy of over \u20ac6700 for our institution. Conclusion: This study shows the efficiency of Antimicrobial Stewardship in adequately using antibiotics, limitating ecological impacts, improving patient care and decreasing healthcare costs. It also shows that guidelines alone are insufficient to ensure a proper use of antibiotics. Without a close prescription follow-up, constant reminders and sustainable evaluations, guidelines only affect a few prescribers. Within the context of an ''antimicrobial crisis'', further development of guidelines and Antimicrobial Stewardship is essential to fight increasing bacterial resistances and requires a close collaboration between all healthcare professionals including pharmacists.",

Results: Three major themes were identified: Benefits, unrealised potential and criteria and barriers for success. (1) Benefits described by physicians included increased patient safety, increased awareness on drugs, and an ease of workload. Drug interaction management was emphasized as one of the clinical pharmacists' most important work tasks, as well as being a resource for collaborating healthcare professions and to the patient himself. (2) The clinical pharmacists expressed that they had an unrealised potential and could contribute to a greater extent in the multidisciplinary team than they did already. They mentioned education towards physicians and nurses, contribution in treatment decision-making and patient counselling as examples for possible extended work tasks. (3) As criteria to succeed as a clinical pharmacist, physicians highlighted the importance of oral communication and physical presence on the wards. As barriers for integration in the team, the clinical pharmacists identified the physicians' lack of knowledge about the clinical pharmacists' skills as well as unclear expectations regarding their responsibilities. Conclusion: Physicians agreed that the clinical pharmacist represent a valuable contribution to the multidisciplinary team, where patient safety and drug interaction management are highlighted as main benefits. Clinical pharmacists should to a greater extent educate healthcare professions in drug related topics and provide patient counselling. Continuous effort on making the clinical pharmacist a natural part of the multidisciplinary team is crucial for the development of clinical pharmacy. By gathering perceptions from the collaborating professions as well as educating them on what clinical pharmacists can provide, we can develop a multidisciplinary team that enhances patient safety.",

With the availability of more potent antiplatelet agents, balancing ischemic and bleeding risks to prevent adverse outcomes is an on-going challenge, in particular, recognising that patients with high bleeding risk were excluded from clinical trials. GRACE and CRUSADE scores stratify risk of mortality and in-hospital major bleeding post ACS respectively. These tools should be used to support antiplatelet choice in light of newer more potent agents that equally pose a greater risk of bleeding. Design: GRACE and CRUSADE scores were calculated for patients presenting with ACS. Clopidogrel was recommended for patients with a high or very high CRUSADE score (greater bleeding risk). Ticagrelor was recommended for patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or those with NSTEACS with a GRACE score of intermediate or above (greater ischemic risk) and a CRUSADE score of moderate or less (low bleeding risk). In either case, treatment was at the discretion of the clinician and patients received concomitant aspirin. A registry was collated of risk scores, diagnosis and choice of antiplatelet therapy. Results: 1030 patients were included in the registry, of which 587 (57%) presented with STEMI and 443 (43%) presented with NSTEACS. 558 of 752 (74%) patients with a greater ischemic risk received ticagrelor as part of their DAPT regime. Advanced age, concomitant anticoagulation and those awaiting surgery were the most common reasons for patients with a greater ischemic risk to receive clopidogrel. 145 (14%) had a high or very high CRUSADE score. Of these, 130 (90%) received clopidogrel as part of their DAPT regime. Conclusion: Risk stratification was streamlined using the data collection tool and useful to support choice of DAPT. European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidance recommends use of established risk scores for prognosis and bleeding; however evidence to correlate to choice of DAPT is lacking. Outcome data is currently being reviewed and will provide further evidence to correlate choice of DAPT to GRACE and CRUSADE scores. Please specify your abstract type: Descriptive abstract (for projects) Background and objective: In Europe, approximately 25% of the patients with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are co-infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Treatment recommendations in HIV/HCV co-infected patients are identical to those in patients with HCV mono-infection.

We also assessed the effectiveness of HCV treatment 12 weeks after HCV treatment completion. Design: We retrospectively registered clinical data about HCV and HIV management: HCV genotype, fibrosis METAVIR score, initial HCV viral load, HCV treatment and previous ART regimen. We recorded the changes in ART prior to starting HCV treatment and the reason of this switch (DDI, simplification or duplication of the therapy). Results: Between February 2015 and January 2016, 50 HIV/HCV coinfected patients started HCV treatment with a DAAs regimen. Of them, 39 had advanced liver disease (fibrosis score: F3/F4) and 27 were infected with HCV genotype 1. Prior to starting HCV treatment, 29 patients needed a switch in ART regimen due to potential DDIs with DAAs. Simeprevir and the co-formulation ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir were the DAAs most frequently implicated in DDI with protease inhibitors or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: 19/29 and 5/29, respectively. Also, we observed some changes of ART due to other causes. Five switches occurred to adequate the regimen (discontinuation of ritonavir in candidates to take the co-formulation ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ ritonavir or ART improvement to decrease pill burden). As for HCV treatment effectiveness, 42/50 (84%) patients achieved sustained viral response 12 weeks after therapy completion. Conclusion: A large proportion of patients with HIV/HCV co-infection who initiate treatment with DAAs for HCV need to switch ART due to potential interactions that may impact on effectiveness and safety of both treatments. Additionally, some changes in ART treatment are made to facilitate therapeutic adherence.",

Clinical pharmacists can limit these risks by identify high risk. The aim of this study are to identify in six medical units high risk patients by using three predictive scores of rehospitalisation (8 Ps) 1 , early mortality (Charlson) 2 and Drug Related Problems (DRP) 3 . Design: 49 clinical and therapeutic variables in 216 patients were collected through medical records and prescriptions by clinical pharmacists. Scores were calculated during 2 months in six units (internal medicine, n = 30; nephrology, n = 35; geriatrics, n = 35; rheumatology, n = 45; cardiology, n = 54 and endocrinology, n = 29). The data were analysed by Mann and Whitney test for the continuous variables and Chi square test for the qualitative variables. The coefficient of correlation between the three scores were calculated by a Pearson test for normal distribution and by a Spearman test for non normal distribution. Patients were considered at a high risk for re-hospitalization (8Ps [ 2) , early mortality (Charlson [ 5) and iatrogenic events (DRP C 8) .",

Most participants described traditional roles such as inventory, drug distribution and dispensing. Most respondents were unaware of the pharmacists' knowledge, skills and competences. For some it was unclear how having a clinical pharmacist in the ward was going to impact on their workload this was particularly important for the nurses. Some doctors (mainly experienced) were concerned that having a pharmacist may mean losing or not gaining competence on drugs. For others it was unclear how the pharmacists' will work with patients or what clinical skills they have. However most participants were positive about the implementation of the new service. Conclusion: This study provided a rare opportunity to explore the doctors' and nurses expectations of the role of clinical pharmacists before a clinical pharmacy service was implemented. The results showed that the participants' expectations of the clinical pharmacist role were unclear. To successfully implement clinical pharmacy services in a clinical pharmacy ''na\u00efve'' setting; roles, clinical competence and responsibilities should be clearly described.

Pharmacists (n = 31) were more willing to prescribe antihypertensive and antidiabetic medication (87.1%) when compared to oral anticoagulants (64.5%). These values are higher than those obtained by Vella in 2014. The majority of pharmacists (87.1%) recommended that pharmacists should take up further studies to a Master or Doctorate level degree in a clinical aspect in order to be authorised to prescribe. Conclusion: The developed framework for pharmacist prescribing and the guidelines developed for pharmacist prescribing of oral anticoagulants and pharmacotherapy of hypertension and diabetes mellitus were shown to be reliable and were accepted by pharmacists and physicians. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Valproic acid (VPA) and its derivates and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and mycophenolic acid used during pregnancy increase risk of congenital malformation and cognitive impairment. Thus, the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety (ANSM) decided to establish new conditions of prescription and dispensation of drugs containing VPA (may 2015) and MMF (April 2016). A signed care agreement and a co-prescription of contraceptives are now mandatory in the drug dispensation for reproductive-age adolescent girls and adult women. This study will describe the impact of these new guidelines on our practice. Our objective is to compare the VPA and MMF media coverage and the impact on the prescriptions. Setting and method: We compared the mass communication between VPA and MMF on social media, webpages and journal article (public and professional journal) on Google and Googletrends in the first months around these new rules. We combined different keywords such as ''accord de soins'' and the drug name. In the same time, we collected and analysed VPA and MMF prescribing and dispensing data and compared it to the 2015 data for the first 6 months. Main outcome measures: Results: Just before the VPA rule, the VPA was presented in the general press as the new health scandal after benfluorex Mediator\u00b0w ith 100 google searches in March 2016 compared to 10 searches usually per month. Simple research combining keywords reveal always more than twice more webpages concerning VPA than MMF. At the same time, a patients association (Renaloo for renal failure) wrote to the ANSM to contest the new rule with the double contraception and without any consultation of patients association. In our daily practice we also faced some physician reluctant to sign this prescription agreement with patient (too many agreements already asked, decision of ANSM without any consultation of learned societies). The care agreements are kept in the patient records, a statement ''care agreement signed'' is reported in the electronic prescription of VPA and MMF. The overall consumption of MMF and VPA increase for respectively the first 2 and 3 months after rule implementation (from +122 to +326%) except for the Micropakin 500 mg. The 6 months MMF data will be presented for the final communication. Conclusion: The media pressure and the new regulation have an impact on prescription trends. These new prescription and dispensing rules concerned two different contexts: pathology, media coverage, possible drug alternatives. We were faced to some difficulty in implementing the new guidelines, which reveals a certain reluctance of the prescribers or the patients represented by associations.",

Results: Sixteen nurses and four pharmacists were interviewed. The nurses' perception of the pharmacist changed from being a controller of drug management routines towards being a source of pharmacotherapy knowledge and a discussant partner of appropriate drug therapy in the elderly. The pharmacists became more aware of the nurses' crucial role of providing clinical information about the patient to enable individual advice. Increasingly the nurses learned to link the patient's symptoms of effect and side effect to the drugs prescribed. With time both professions jointly spoke of an increased awareness of the benefit of working as a team and the perception of contributing to better and more individual care. Conclusion: IMRs in primary health care meet some challenges especially concerning how to ensure participation of all three professions and how to get thorough information about the patient. Possible solutions might be to use shared communication tools like Internet based communication programs and to introduce the patient as a participant at the IMRs. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: International good pharmacy practice guidelines describe how pharmacists should counsel the patients about their medicines, offer additional services where needed, and intervene at drug related problems. Daily practice often differs from theory. This study aimed at illustrating the whole process of prescribed medicines dispensing in daily community pharmacy practice. Part B of the project focuses on pharmacists' opinions. Setting and method: Community pharmacies in Basel, Switzerland, were invited in random order for study participation. One master student in pharmacy performed non-participant observations during 1 day at each included community pharmacy. At dispensing of prescribed medicines, patient data, content of counselling, communication style, and provision of further services (e.g. follow-up offer) were documented on a checklist with predefined themes. Interventions were documented systematically. A semi-structured interview on the pharmacists' opinions about the counselling, triggers, facilitators and barriers, and the documentation of interventions was conducted at each community pharmacy. Main outcome measures: Counselling content at prescription dispensing by numbers and by pharmacists' opinions; barriers, facilitators, and triggers for counselling at prescription dispensing. Results: In March and April 2016, 18 of 49 invited community pharmacies participated in the study. Out of 561 documented observation periods, 556 encounters were analysed (first prescription: 269/refill prescription: 287). Counselling was provided to 367 (66.0%) clients with an average of 2.9 (\u00b13.1) themes per encounter. A total of 148 clients refused counselling. Themes most counselled at first and refill prescription dispensing were: drug intake (476/80), dosage (191/50) , and administration (163/38). For the pharmacists (n = 18), most important themes to be discussed at first prescription dispensing were indication (11), administration (9), and anamnesis (8); for refill prescription dispensing they were adherence (9), therapy benefits (9), and adverse effects (7). The majority of pharmacists (13) felt that it was their obligation to ask questions about patients' health during the dispensing of prescription medicines and named trigger (e.g. patient knowledge gap, patient motivation, interactions), but one-third reported difficulties with it. Barriers were refusal by patients (13), communication problems (language, 7), lack of medical data (3) , and lack of time (3) . Conclusion: A discrepancy in counselling content by observation compared to pharmacists' opinions was revealed. This might indicate that pharmacists are aware but hindered by barriers to practice according to good pharmacy practice guidelines. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: The 2020 Workforce Vision in Scotland envisages 'making more and better use of technology \u2026to increase access to services and improve efficiency' across the healthcare interface. Services offered by community pharmacy remain limited by lack of shared access to patients' clinical information. In Scotland, every patient has a unique identifier, their CHI (community health index), which facilitates identification of/searching for patient records. The aim of this research was to explore the experiences of community pharmacists granted clinical portal access to patients' records. Setting and method: From April 2015, community pharmacists across NHS Tayside (n = 21) who had completed technical and information governance training were invited to maintain a portal log of their experiences of using the clinical portal to access patient records. Each was asked to record when/why they considered accessing a patient's record and whether their information needs were met. Portal logs were subject to independent summative content analysis by two researchers. This study gained ethical approval from Robert Gordon University. Main outcome measures: Not applicable. Results: Clinical portal logs were received from most participating pharmacists (n = 18/21). Two were unavailable (moved to hospital setting; maternity leave). A third had not had occasion to access the clinical portal which he speculated was due to not working at weekends but also raised concerns about gaining patient consent. Frequency of seven identified themes provided a partial indication of balance of reasons for usage. Firstly (#1), to confirm a patient's prescription (n = 48), secondly (#2), for additional information (n = 46). Less frequently (#3), portal access was to check repeat medications (n = 23). Other reasons for access were (#4) to check hospital discharge (n = 21) followed by (#5) check on multi-compartment appliance aid status (n = 14) or (#6) check the Emergency Care Summary (n = 11). There were also instances (#7) when portal access was not found to be helpful (n = 16) so traditional offline routes were followed. Conclusion: Preliminary findings indicate mainly positive experiences with no technical issues raised and community pharmacists' information needs largely met. Although limited to a small number of pharmacists in only one Health Board, findings support Scottish policy aims, including 'Prescription for Excellence.' Further work is underway around patients' perspectives of community pharmacist access. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Multicompartment Compliance Aids (MCAs) such as the multidrug punch cards Pharmis \u00d2 are used to support patients in the daily management of their medication. Solid oral medicines are unpacked from their original packaging and repacked in MCAs although controversy exists about the stability of repackaged medicines. Different countries published contradictory lists of medicines not recommended for repackaging. We aimed to define and apply criteria able to assess visual alteration of medicines repackaged in MCAs. Setting and method: Eight criteria describing physical alteration of tablets/capsules were retrieved from the WHO International Pharmacopoeia 2015: chipping, swelling, capping, rough surface, cracking, crushing under pressure, mottling, and discoloration. Absence of one criteria gives 1 point. A maximum score of 8 points can be obtained. Twenty-two critical medicines and three half tablets were repackaged in the multidrug punch cards Pharmis \u00d2 and stored at accelerated conditions (40\u00b0C/75% RH) for 4 weeks. Original blisters of medicines were stored at room temperature as control. Each tablet/capsule was visually inspected after 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. Main outcome measures: Score according to eight criteria. Results: After 4 weeks, 17 tablets/capsules including 2 of the half tablets showed no visual alteration and were identical to controls. A reduced score (3-7 points) was given to seven repackaged medicines and one half tablet within 4 weeks: Madopar \u00d2 (3), Pravastatin Sandoz \u00d2 (4), Carvedilol Mepha \u00d2 (6), Plavix \u00d2 (6), Pantoprazol Nycomed \u00d2 (7), Adalat \u00d2 CR (7). Swelling and rough surface were the most frequent. Chipping and capping were not observed. Conclusion: Our eight visual criteria are able to detect physical alteration of repackaged solid oral medicines under stress conditions. In absence of reliable data we suggest to apply this simple quality control for repackaged medicines in pharmacy practice. Because chemical stability testing is not feasible in practice, pragmatic solutions are sought. Further studies are needed for storage at room temperature.",

Pharmacists performed a MR based solely on the patients' medication data, including dosage regimens of the nursing home and self-medication data. The detected and solved DRP were counted. Additionally, a simple questionnaire (SYMPEL) was distributed to the patients periodically in order to assess their symptom burden. Main outcome measures: Frequency and type of the patients' DRP as well as their symptom burden before and after the MR. Results: After testing the feasibility of this intervention in a pilot study, 54 patients were included in the main study so far. In average, the pharmacists identified two DRP per patient and reported to the responsible general practitioner (GP) . As in the pilot study, most frequent DRP documented by pharmacists were drugdrug-interactions (34%). 29% of the pharmacists' recommendations were accepted by the GP. 46% of the patients took at least one drug considered as potentially inadequate in the elderly. Out of six different symptoms, patients reported dizziness and bruises most frequently. Conclusion: Pharmacists can detect many DRP in nursing home residents by means of a simple MR. However, the full potential of this service to solve DRP can only be exploited if the cooperation with the GPs is improved. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Medicines for rare diseases (RD) are costly and have limited efficacy evidence but they represent around 20% of all innovative medicines. Therefore, countries are facing challenges in providing patient access to them. The purpose of the study was to assess the patient access for Slovenia and compare it with 23 other European countries in the last decade. Setting and method: The medicines for RD that obtained marketing approval between 2005 and 2014 via centralised procedure were included in the study based on the Orphanet list from January 2016. Using the quarterly IMS Health database, sales data were analysed for Slovenia and 21 other European Union countries, Norway and Switzerland. Patient access was assessed for each country and comparisons between the countries were made using the three main outcome measures. Main outcome measures: The number of medicines for RD available; Time to first continuous use after marketing approval; Total pharmaceutical expenditure for medicines for RD in euros. Results: Altogether, 125 medicines for RD were approved between 2005 and 2014. Complete sales data were available for 120 medicines which were included in the comparison. For Germany and the United Kingdom the continuous use of 102 (85%) and 94 (78%) was observed, respectively. The following Italy, France, Denmark and Sweden use 60-70% of all the medicines. In Slovenia, 66 (55%) medicines for RD were introduced. Germany and the United Kingdom times to first continuous use were the shortest (median time 1-3 months after marketing approval). Median times below 12 months were observed for Norway, Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands, France and Switzerland. Other countries were slower in enabling first continuous use (median time from 12 to 34 months). Germany, France, Switzerland had the largest pharmaceutical expenditure per inhabitant in 2014 (29.2, 25.0 and 24.0 euros/inhabitant) while Slovenia amounted to 18.5 euros/inhabitant.",

This would meet the needs of health technology assessment agencies (HTAs) such as NICE, who preferentially use the general health measure EQ-5D. The DLQI is a specialty-specific measure unlike the EQ-5D, a generic measure from which utility values can be derived. Often several measures are implemented in studies with increased cost and patient burden. Ordinal logistic regression (OLR) was used to develop a model to convert DLQI scores to EQ-5D based utility values for use in economic appraisal of medicines. Setting and method: Data from 4010 patients were randomly divided into estimation and validation sets to fit and test the model. A series of ordinal logistic regressions were fitted in SPSS v22 for the five EQ-5D dimensions based on age, sex and all 10 individual items of the DLQI as predictors. The model produced three estimated probabilities per subject per EQ-5D domain. Using these estimated probabilities, a series of 10 Monte Carlo (MC) simulations were run for each subject resulting in predicted domain responses. From these, utility values were calculated and compared to actual patient values. Main outcome measures: Conversion of DLQI scores to EQ-5D domain data Results: There are conceptual overlaps between items of the DLQI and EQ-5D. The validation data set (which was not included in the creation of the model), demonstrated that the models were highly predictive compared to actual responses, except for minor differences for the pain/discomfort domain. For example, for the EQ-5D ' Mobility' domain, 1389 patients answered 'No' (predicted 1392 and 440 patients answered 'Some or Extreme' (predicted 437) . We examined the model's latent variables, which also demonstrated high predictability at individual level. For example for the 'Usual Activities' domain the mean latent variable scores were -2.49, -1.62 and -0.86 for those responding 'No', 'Some' and 'Extreme' respectively, showing a clear increase in the scores with response. After excluding subjects with missing variable data there were 1769 patients in the estimation set and 1773 in the validation set. The model was shown to be highly predictive and repeated simulations demonstrated a stable model. The average predicted utility value for the entire validation set ranged from 0.742 to 0.753 across the 10 MC simulations compared to the actual average utility value of 0.754. Conclusion: Using OLR, we have developed a method of mapping the disease-specific DLQI onto the EQ-5D: utility values may then be derived for population data sets, and possibly for individuals. The OLR technique could be used to convert data from other disease-specific quality-of-life measures to generic utility data for incorporation into cost-effective analyses, greatly enhancing the potential value of such information.",

SIMPATHY (Stimulating Innovation Management of Polypharmacy and Adherence in The Elderly) is a consortium of 10 organizations representing eight European countries, aiming at stimulating innovation around management of appropriate polypharmacy and adherence, ultimately providing tools for EU policy makers to develop and/or improve, implement and evaluate programs addressing these issues. Design: A mixed-methods case study was carried out in Greece, to identify policies on the management of polypharmacy and adherence issues in the elderly. A desk review of the polypharmacy and adherence policies at the government, regional and institutional level has been completed. Key informant interviews were conducted with policymakers and health professionals responsible for developing and implementing strategies. Focus groups consisting of policymakers, clinicians and patients validated the research findings. Results: Although e-prescription implementation is widespread (&98% coverage nationwide) and disease-specific guidelines have been developed, polypharmacy management is only associated with direct economic indicators. No formal policies or programmes are identified. Significant contributions are coming from different health professional organizations that have chosen to provide expanded services to their patients, aiming at optimising drug therapy and thus polypharmacy management and medication adherence in the elderly. Community pharmacists offer pharmaceutical care to patients, which includes management of prescribed medication, OTC remedies, vitamins and supplements and food-drug interactions. Hospital pharmacists in some state (public) hospitals review medication for inpatients and out-patients, communicate with prescribers and confirm the ''benefit-no harm'' principle in the prescribed medication (e.g. incompatibilities, side effects, 7-rights of medication). Medical doctors, mostly general practitioners and some specialized ones, usually in primary healthcare settings, keep health records of their patients and have an overview of all administered medication. However, key barriers still remain the lack of coordination of institutions and authorities and overlap of their responsibilities, healthcare workforce and infrastructure shortages and several cultural issues. Conclusion: All initiatives to medication management and medicines optimisation are provided without directive from national policies or guidelines. Therefore, these activities rely on the goodwill of the health professionals to address pharmacotherapy and therefore polypharmacy management but they are not necessarily representative of what is happening nationwide. A national policy to implement the management of polypharmacy nationwide could mobilise the willingness of health professionals and ensure consistency of care. Development and implementation of this policy should build on the grassroots efforts currently underway in this area.",

Main outcome measures: Clinical form of the disease, HIV testing, new cases, cure and treatment discontinuation. Results: Sociodemographic data were available for sites A and B only. Most patients were male (70%, n = 291), with age raging from 20 to 49 years old (60.5%, n = 252); most had a low education level (46%, n = 192) and low socioeconomic status (92%, n = 382). The most common clinical presentation was pulmonary TB. Most cases were new (78.4%, n = 345); recurrence and enrolment after discontinuation were respectively 5.9 and 10.9% (n = 26 and n = 48). With respect to HIV, 37.27% of patients were seronegative (n = 164); about a third (35%; n = 155) had not performed HIV test. Rates for cure were respectively 59.1% (n = 260), 28.95% (n = 128) and 16.6% (n = 73) in the sites A, B and C. Correspondent rates for treatment discontinuation were 21.2%(n = 93), 24.9% (n = 110), 4.3% (n = 19), respectively. TB-related mortality ranged from 0 in site C to 5.4% in site B. Conclusion: Missed HIV tests may represent undetected tuberculosis/ HIV coinfection. Site B presented the highest rates of intrapulmonary plus mixed TB forms, discontinuation of treatment and TB-related mortality; additionally, it had the lowest rate of enrolment after treatment discontinuation. Patients co-infected with TB and HIV are firstly referred to this site, which may explain this finding. Our findings may help managers allocating resources and assist clinical pharmacists in planning their interventions. Findings also suggest the need of more intensive interventions in TB patients, such as pharmaceutical care programmes. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Pharmacists working in primary health clinics have various roles. Pharmaceutical care is one of them. How to provide this service varies across countries and settings. The most optimal way to provide pharmaceutical care is important to define when developing clinical pharmacy services in a new setting such as primary care practices. General practitioners are key stakeholders in this endeavour. The aim of this study was to find the most optimal approach to providing pharmacist-led pharmaceutical care in primary health care clinics in Iceland in collaboration with general practitioners. Setting and method: Action research provided the framework for this research. Data was collected from pharmaceutical care interventions with patients, field observations, field notes, and interviews with general practitioners over the period of the study. The study ran from September 2012 to June 2015. Three separate semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with five general practitioners from one primary health care clinic in Iceland at different time points throughout the study. Pharmacist-led pharmaceutical care was provided to patients (n = 125) before and between general practitioners' interviews. The study settings was a primary health care clinic in Reykjavik area and the patients' homes. Main outcome measures: How to provide pharmaceutical care in collaboration with general practitioners in the Icelandic health care environment. Results: Direct contact between pharmacists and general practitioners over short distances are essential to providing optimal pharmaceutical care services. Pharmacist's access to medical records is necessary even though face-to-face communication between pharmacist and patients are most effective in providing pharmaceutical care. Pharmacist-led clinical service was deemed most needed in dose dispensing polypharmacy patients. Patients require more information about drugs prescribed to them coupled with an accurate drug list with greater detail. Conclusion: The most efficient collaboration when pharmacist and general practitioner is obtained when they work side by side at the primary health care clinic. When new services are developed it is vital to identify different requirements of the primary health care clinics to optimize the running of a clinical pharmacist service.",

These medicines confer autonomy to patients. Although, they may cause adverse effects that can lead to treatment adherence issue, unjustified hospitalizations, or premature treatment interruption. Proper accompaniment of patient can prevent these issues. In order to define how to organize this accompaniment, we conducted a survey on patients' experience. The objective is to describe patients care pathway and identify their needs. Design: A descriptive, qualitative, prospective, survey was conducted using self-administered questionnaires, in hospitals of Ile-de-France region. Inclusion criteria were: having being treated with oral neoplastic agents during minimum 2 months, age [18, solid tumor, no concomitant IV chemotherapy. Collected data were: patients' sociodemographic and clinical profile, their insight about different steps of care pathway (information, treatment delivery, follow up), their behaviours and interactions with healthcare professionals, and their overall opinion. Results: 44 patients were recruited in six hospitals. Their sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were variable. 72% were treated with targeted therapy, 12% with cytotoxic agent, and 16% with endocrine therapy. Patients showed high satisfaction for given information at the beginning of the treatment. Principal source of information identified was the oncologist (100%). While the delivery of treatment, 40% of patients beneficiated of advices from the pharmacist. Accompaniment of patients during treatment seemed unequal, with: a frequency of visits with the oncologist ranging from less than 1-3 months; 36% of patients not knowing any telephone number they can call in case of worries or questions about their condition or treatment; 39% not remembering any particular accompaniment treatment (visits or calls from nurses or doctors for example). For adverse effects management, three principals actors were identified: oncologist (95%), general practitioner (52%) and pharmacist (31%). Regarding the use of oral chemotherapy, patient are satisfied with: it's comfort (93%); being more actively involved in their cancer care (90%); and state not having any anxiety taking chemotherapy home (95%) . Asked openly about their concerned and needs three major concepts were identified: high concern about adverse effects, positive feedback about maintaining contact with health professionals between cures and difficulties of communication between health professionals. Conclusion: There is a high satisfaction regarding oral chemotherapy and health professionals. The oncologist has a primordial place in patient pathway, whereas implication of pharmacist and general practitioner stays variable. Adverse effects are a major concern that needs proactive accompaniment. The variability of our results suggests that accompaniment must be flexible and adapted to the needs of each patients. The key to flexibility could be good coordination and communication between healthcare professionals.",

The objective of a recent RCT was to investigate the effects of e-learning about medicines among elderly adults. A positive impact on the primary outcome measure, knowledge about medicines, is reported elsewhere. A secondary outcome measure, general beliefs about medicines, is reported below. Setting and method: The study was a randomized controlled trial in elderly people (aged C65 years). Participants were recruited from patient associations and pensioner\u015b associations. Participants were randomized to either an intervention group that participated in the e-learning, i.e. internet modules with video and audio, or a control group that did not take part in the e-learning. Post-intervention data was collected using paper-based questionnaires, completed within two weeks after agreeing to participate in the study. The General Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQgeneral), comprising the subscales necessity, harm and overuse, was used to elicit beliefs. Higher scores indicate stronger endorsement of scale constructs (range [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Main outcome measures: BMQ-general subscale scores. Results: A total of 195 elderly people were included in the study, 96 in the intervention and 99 in the control group. The mean age in the total population was 74.5 years and 53% were women. Eleven percent did not use any prescribed drugs while 27% used more than five prescribed drugs. The patients' scores were very similar in the two groups for all three BMQ subscales. The median ''Overuse'' score was 12 in the intervention group versus 13 in the control group, the median ''Harm'' score was 10 (IQR 8-12) in both groups and the median ''Necessity'' score was 18 in both groups. In the total population the most commonly expressed negative beliefs referred to overuse of drugs. 62.4% of respondents agreed with the statement ''If doctors had more time they would prescribe fewer medicines'', 43.4% stated ''Doctors prescribe too many medicines'', and 37.9% stated ''Doctors place too much trust in medicines''. A majority of the respondents agreed with the four items on the ''Necessity'' scale. For example ''Medicines help people to live a better life (96.9% agreed)''. Conclusion: The studied e-learning intervention was not shown to have any impact on general beliefs about medicines. Beliefs about medicines have been associated with a number of background variables which might explain why increased knowledge about medicines alone cannot change such beliefs. In general, respondents in the study had highly positive beliefs about the necessity of medicines. Nevertheless, the results indicate that overuse of medicines is regarded as a problem.",

            "text": "Please specify your abstract type: Descriptive abstract (for projects) Background and objective: The Medication Assistance Fund Plus (MAF-Plus) is a government scheme introduced in Singapore in 2011 to provide financial assistance to needy patients who meet pre-set criteria based on means testing. Unlike previous schemes, MAF-Plus provides broader discretion to institutions when providing financial assistance. In our institution, pharmacists reviewed patients' case and medication histories, and filed recommendations to a multidisciplinary committee tasked with approving deserving MAF-Plus applications. The pharmacists' contributions to the committee, and the outcomes of the applications, are presented in this study. Design: All MAF-Plus applications received between 1st October 2011 and 31st December 2015 were reviewed. Pharmacists' comments for each application, where provided, were noted, as well as the range of medicines applied for, review approval rates, and cumulative percentage of available funds utilised. The effect of a recent widening of the scheme's scope to include notable high-cost items was also evaluated. Results: Between 2011 and 2015, 2001 MAF-Plus applications were reviewed, of which 1737 (86.8%) were approved. Of the 264 rejected applications, 145 (54.9%) were channelled to alternative financial assistance schemes on the recommendation of the pharmacists. The medicines most commonly applied for were intended for the treatment of cardiac (24.3%), respiratory (14.7%), and psychiatric (13.5%) conditions. Pharmacists' recommendations also led to a gradual expansion of our institution's list of pre-approved medicines-from 5 in 2011-2012 to 47 by end-2015. From 2014 onwards, pharmacists previewed increasing numbers of applications for high-cost medicines, particularly those for treatment of retroviral disease, hepatitis C, and rare diseases. Cumulative utilisation of MAF-Plus funds (inclusive of annual replenishment) rose from 3.3% in 2011-2012 to 38.8% by end-2015, representing an average year-on-year growth of 151.1%. Conclusion: Using a process of judicious previewing of MAF-Plus applications, and recommendations to the MAF-Plus committee, pharmacists contributed to a high percentage of patients receiving financial assistance for medications. Despite a steep growth in the number of applications received between 2011 and 2015, this approach helped to prevent over-extension in fund utilisation. Pharmacists will likely be increasingly relied upon due to an anticipated rise in the number of applications for high-cost medicines. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Adolescents often treat themselves and take medications without parental supervision. Lack of experience and knowledge of medicines in this age group frequently leads to inappropriate use of medicines and adverse drug reactions. Data about the use of medicines among Slovak adolescents and their knowledge of medicines have not been studied yet. Setting and method: For our study we used the questionnaire method. The questionnaire contained 23 multidimensional items with closed-ended and open-ended questions, which focused on the characteristics of the adolescent\u015b health status, use of medicines, also in relation to parents and adolescent\u015b knowledge and perception of medicine\u015b risk. We distributed 930 validated questionnaires for adolescents aged from 12 to 18 at secondary schools in all regions of Slovakia. Response rate was 70.6%. 657 questionnaires were finally analysed. The differences in the distribution of categorical variables between groups were evaluated using the Chi square test. SAS 9.4. was used as statistical software. Main outcome measures: To determine adolescent\u015b knowledge of medicines in terms of efficacy, self-medication, safety of therapy and analyse which medicines are the most frequently used by adolescents. To compare adolescents with chronic disease and healthy ones from the perception of pharmacotherapy point of view. Results: In the analysed group 40.8% (n = 268) of adolescents are treated for chronic disease. Mostly they suffer from allergy (25.0%, n = 67) and skin diseases (6.8%, n = 18). Adolescents with chronic disease use regularly prescription medicines (36.9%, n = 99, p \\ 0.001) and over the counter medicines (11.6%, n = 31, p \\ 0.001). This group of adolescents better accept the pharmacotherapy with parental supervision (33.2%, n = 89, p = 0.0047 vs. healthy adolescents) and they believe in effectiveness of prescription medicines (71.3%, n = 191, p = 0.0226 vs. healthy adolescents). Most frequently prescribed medicines were azithromycin, levocetirizine, ofloxacin and over the counter medicines were ibuprofen, paracetamol, ascorbic acid. We found out in all group of adolescents that 81.3% (n = 534) prefer self-medication without check-ups, 73.5% (n = 483) used drugs in the last 6 months without a prescription, 51.8% (n = 340) take over the counter medications independently without the supervision of parents, 14.9% (n = 154) buy medicines themselves in the pharmacy, 44.6% (n = 293) do not take medications as recommended, 56.6% (n = 372) believe that they have enough knowledge of medicines which they take, 51.4% (n = 338) resp. 49.6%, (n = 326) believe that prescription medicines resp. over the counter medicines are safe. Conclusion: Questionnaire analysis pointed out that Slovak adolescents have not enough knowledge of medicines. The study provides new information in the field of risk perception and adolescent\u015b knowledge of medicines in the Slovak Republic and highlights the areas that need to be studied in the future in terms of adolescent\u015b education.",

This study aimed to outline the cure and discontinuation rates of patients enrolled in the Pernambuco Tuberculosis Control Program (PECT), based on dispensing data. Setting and method: The study was carried out in three sites in Recife public health system, Brazil, designated A (one polyclinic plus eight general practice units), B (one hospital for medium-complexity patients) and C (one hospital for high-complexity patients). Data were collected between 07-11/2014, through reports from the stock management software for public pharmacies (Horus) for PECT outpatients.

Rates for cure were respectively 35.9% (83), 23.6% (82) and 31% (114) in the sites A, B and C, while rates for treatment discontinuation were 3.4% (8), 27.8% (97) and 9% (33), respectively. Discontinuation rates were significantly different among the sites A, B and C (p \\ 0.05). Bootstrap analysis showed that overall the proportion of patients with an ''undetermined'' status in each site did not significantly change these differences. Conclusion: Only site A had an acceptable discontinuation rate, in light of the World Health Organization recommendations. This deserves attention as default treatment leaves patients infectious for longer, increases the risk of poor outcomes and fosters resistance to antibiotics. Pharmacists could use dispensing data to signal TB patients at-risk of discontinuation, and subsequently tailor interventions addressing its causes. Site B had the greater number of patients which discontinued treatment. Patients co-infected with TB and HIV are firstly referred to this site, which may explain this finding. Our findings suggest the need of more intensive interventions in patients co-infected with TB and HIV, such as pharmaceutical care programmes. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Many efforts are done to organise good quality and safe pharmaceutical care. In general, the involvement of a hospital pharmacist or hospital pharmacy personnel in the process of medication reconciliation results in a reduction of the number of medication discrepancies. However, in case of emergency admissions this topic is still insufficiently studied. The introduction of good medication reconciliation on the emergency department (ER) requires firm logistical and organisational efforts. We investigated the effects of a drug reconciliation intervention by pharmacy personnel during emergency admissions in order to identify discrepancies between medication lists taken by ER physicians and by pharmacy personnel. Setting and method: This observational, comparative, non-randomised intervention study was performed in 2011. We calculated that a population size of 65 patients was sufficient to perform reliable measurements. Inclusion criteria: all patients presented at the ER and admitted to a hospital ward \\24 after presentation with usage of one or more prescription drugs. Exclusion criteria: age \\18 years, residency outside the region Delftland, inability to undergo an oral interview, absence of a medication list of the public pharmacy (OZISlist), decease of the patient during ER-stay and patients undergoing surgical procedures. Discrepancies between both medication lists taken by an ER physician or pharmacy technician were classified in four categories of increasing severity (1 = no discrepancy to 4 = clinical relevant discrepancy) using the index of the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (www.nccmerp.org). Discrepancies were categorised by a panel consisting of a pharmacy technician, a (senior) hospital pharmacist and a 6th year pharmacy student. Statistical analysis was carried out with a statistical software package (SPSS 18) using the Mann-Whitney U test and Chi Squares test. Main outcome measures: During the intervention measurement we analysed the reconciliated medication by comparing the ER's physician's list with the list of the pharmacy technician after a medication verification interview. The number of discrepancies were measured and judged by the panel. Discrepancies were given a category 1, 2, 3 or 4 as defined.",

The average number of discrepancies per patient after intervention decreased by 68.0%, from average 2.5 to 0.8 discrepancies per patient. Conclusion: Medication verification by pharmacy personnel in the ER reduces the number of medication discrepancies by half.

Setting and method: In a descriptive qualitative sub-study in the ongoing Norwegian Early Intervention in Psychosis, TIPS 2 study, where twenty-first episode patients (7 male, 13 female) participated in semi-structured interviews 2 years after inclusion. They were still using or had used antipsychotics during the last 2 years. Data were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Main outcome measures: Adherence to antipsychotics. Results: The data suggested four main themes, reflecting the patients' subjective experiences and their impact on the desire to adhere to antipsychotics: (1) Admission experience as a psychotic's patient; (2) Information from healthcare staff; (3) Limited involvement in decision-making; (4) Attitude to antipsychotics. Conclusion: A number of factors had a positive influence on adherence to antipsychotics. Pleasant admission/stay experiences, feeling that antipsychotics had therapeutic effects, mild or no side effects, and believing that antipsychotics are necessary and useful, were typical statements. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: The hospital-to-home transition is a vulnerable stage in a patient's care. Patients can experience problems with medication supply, which possibly lead to therapy interruptions. The objectives of this study were to investigate medication supply after discharge, and patients' and physicians' opinions about the current discharge process and possible optimisations. Setting and method: A telephone interview was conducted with 100 discharged patients from the surgical and internal medical wards from the cantonal hospital in Baden (Switzerland). Inclusion criteria were: patients C50 years old, discharged home with a discharge prescription. Patients were called between the 2nd and 6th day after discharge and a piloted, structured interview was performed, consisting of questions on experiences and optimisations. Afterwards, semi-structured interviews were conducted with five physicians from the study hospital. Results from patient interviews and the general discharge process were discussed. Main outcome measures: Proportion of filled prescription, frequency and type of supply problems including therapy interruptions. Opinions of physicians and patients on current discharge process and possible optimisations. Results: Discharged patients were 65.6 \u00b1 17.4 years old, 39% female, 53% from internal medicine, and 97% regularly visit the same pharmacy. Of the 100 interviewed patients, 23 have not filled their prescriptions yet and 77 had their prescription filled when they were called. Of these, 78% of them visited the pharmacy on the day of discharge, but it took up to the 6th day until all of them received their medication. Supply problems were encountered by 14 patients (18%), mainly because of the medication not being in stock in the community pharmacy. Only four patients experienced therapy interruptions, which took up to the 3rd day post-discharge. Patients discharged from internal medical wards had more supply problems compared to surgical wards (relative risk = 5.56, p = 0.007). Patients experiencing supply problems had statistically significant more medicines on a daily basis (8.0 \u00b1 4.32 vs. 4.9 \u00b1 3.04, p = 0.010). Physicians were surprised about the late prescription filling and worried about the disease outcomes. However, interruptions were interpreted as unfrequent.",

Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Adherence to secondary prevention evidence-based medical (EBM) therapies for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is essential to reduce long-term rates of major adverse cardiovascular events. Current guidelines recommend the long-term use of low-dose aspirin, highintensity statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)/ angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and beta-blockers (BB), in addition to P2Y 12 inhibitors for 1 year. We aimed to assess the adherence to secondary prevention EBM therapies from discharge to one-year follow-up among patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in contemporary practice. Setting and method: Observational single-centre study including consecutive patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI in a tertiary hospital in Switzerland over a one-year period. Secondary prevention EBM therapies were assessed at discharge and at one-year follow-up. Main outcome measures: Prescription of key secondary prevention EBM therapies (aspirin, P2Y 12 inhibitors, statins, ACEI/ARB and BB) from discharge to one-year follow-up after STEMI. BB was recommended only for patients with heart failure or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \\40%. Results: A total of 179 patients were included. EBM drug prescription at discharge was 99.4% for Aspirin (n = 178), 97.8% for P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor (n = 175), 97.2% for statin (n = 174), 93.9% for ACEI/ARB (n = 168) and 87.5% for BB (n = 28, among 32 patients with LVEF \\ 40%). Ticagrelor (84.6%) was the major P2Y 12 inhibitor prescribed. Overall, 25 EBM drugs were missing at discharge, with 13 of these missing drugs having no justification for no-prescription (contraindications, allergy or intolerance). At one-year follow-up (median 13.4 months, n = 156), aspirin, statins and ACEI/ ARB prescription rates were 92.9% (n = 145), 92.3% (n = 144) and 82.1% (n = 128) respectively. 19 out of 23 patients (82.6%) with LVEF \\ 40% received a BB. Among patients treated with ticagrelor at discharge, 31 (23.5%) were receiving ticagrelor at follow-up, whereas 21 (15.9%) were switched to another P2Y 12 inhibitor.",

Reasons for ticagrelor early discontinuation or switch were not specified. Conclusion: In a real-world cohort of patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI, prescription of recommended secondary prevention medications at discharge is excellent. Adherence to EBM therapies at 1 year remains high with more than 80% of patients receiving all EBM drugs. Early discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy was observed in 15% of patients, whereas ticagrelor was switched for another P2Y 12 inhibitor in 15.9% of patients. These observations highlight key opportunities to improve longitudinal use of secondary prevention therapies after STEMI in routine clinical practice. Although side effects are less common than traditional chemotherapies, certain ones such as pain, fatigue, nausea and vomiting can still be bothersome. In oncology outpatient clinics, side effects are monitored by oncology nurses; however due to high patient turnover and limited numbers of nurses, the assessment of side effects might not be performed adequately. Therefore, aim of this study was to determine side effects of immunotherapy and targeted therapy and to compare the severity assessment of side effects by clinical pharmacist and nurses. Setting and method: The study was conducted in the Hacettepe University Oncology Hospital outpatient clinic. The patients who have been taking ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, bevacizumab, panitimumab or cetuximab during October 2015-March 2016 were included. The assessment of side effects were undertaken by a clinical pharmacist and nurses separately on each visit using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version-2 toxicity assessment scale. An independent clinical pharmacist compared the side effects' assessments by pharmacist and nurses for analysis. Ethical approval was obtained from Hacettepe University Ethics Committee. Main outcome measures: To compare the severity of side effects of targeted drug therapies which were assessed by a clinical pharmacist and nurses. Results: During the study period 204 visits of 43 patients were evaluated. A total of 5508 side effects assessments were recorded. Among those assessments 909(16.5%) was assessed in different ranking by nurses and pharmacist. The differences in the number of assessments were mainly seen in criteria related to pain (n = 34; 51), sensory loss (n = 24; 59), fatigue (n = 114; 26), stress (n = 16; 28), insomnia (n = 18; 28) which was performed by nurses and pharmacist respectively. Other side effects detected only by clinical pharmacist were oedema, cough, gastrointestinal complaints (heartburn, cramp) and sensitivity of odour which require close monitoring and in-depth counselling by clinical pharmacist. Conclusion: This study explores the differences in assessment of side effects by pharmacist and nurses in targeted therapies. Routine assessment of side effects between chemotherapy cycles might yield to misinterpretation or inadequate assessment due to workload of outpatient clinic. Therefore, inter-professional interactions in outpatient clinics might close the communicational gaps and improve patient care.",

Clinical pharmacy has been deployed in care units since 2014. Many clinical pharmacy services were developed: medication reconciliation, patient's therapeutic education and counselling, and prescription analysis unit based. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of the clinical pharmacist as a direct patient-care team member on prescription analysis. Setting and method: We collected pharmaceutical interventions (PIs) of the first 6 months of 2013 and at the same period of the year 2015 in the neurology unit when the pharmacist was unit based. We studied and compared type of PIs (medication, drug related problem-DRP), rate of PIs acceptance and clinical impact. Focus was made on high alert risk medications and potentially inappropriate medications. 4.5% in 2015 versus none in 2013. When prescription analysis was based in the pharmacy unit, 31% of DRP detected by the pharmacist had a potential clinical impact versus 59% when the pharmacist performed prescription analysis in the care unit (p \\ 0.05). Three DRP detected in 2015 had serious potential harm. Results: Ward-based prescription analysis allowed detecting five more times DRP with a significant more important clinical impact than pharmacy unit based prescription analysis. The clinical pharmacist as a direct patient-care team member is more efficient in detecting serious potential harm. Indeed, the pharmacist has a greater knowledge of the patient's clinical condition. Nevertheless the global rate of acceptance of PIs was greater when the prescription analysis was based in the pharmacy unit even if the difference is not significant. But prescription analysis is more complex when performed in the care unit, taking account adherence of the patient, and potentially inappropriate medications resulting in much higher risk-taking by the ward-based pharmacist. Conclusion: This study showed that unit based prescription analysis is the best way to detect drug related problem. It must be competed by medication reconciliation and medication review to improve medication safety process.",

The clinical relevance of this side effect of psychotropic medication remains unclear, especially in patients hospitalized in an acute hospital. To interpret the clinical importance of psychotropic drug induced QT-prolongation, we investigated the prevalence of these electrocardiographic changes. Setting and method: A prospective study was conducted on four psychiatric wards in a general hospital: two acute, short-term psychiatric units (ASP1 and ASP2), one addiction service unit (ASU) and one geriatric-psychiatric ward (GPW). All adult patients admitted between October 1st 2015 and March 15th 2016 on a psychiatric ward were eligible for inclusion. At admission, an ECG (ECG0) was performed and creatinine and potassium levels were measured. A second ECG (ECG1) was performed at least 7 days after the start of a psychotropic drug associated with a risk of QT-prolongation. QTcprolongation was defined as 470 ms for males and 480 ms for females. Clinically relevant QTc-prolongation was defined as C500 ms. Statistical analysis (R software) was done as appropriate. Main outcome measures: Prevalence of psychotropic drug induced QTc-changes and correlating factors. Results: 268 patients (mean age 55 years, 59%female) were enrolled in the analysis. In 85 patients, an ECG1 was performed. QTc 0+1 were prolonged in 2.3%(5/220) of females and 3.7%(5/136) of males. No clinical relevant prolongation (C500 ms) was registered. Higher QTc intervals were measured in the geriatric population. 28.5%(36/126) of all measured QTc were situated between [450 C QTc 0+1 B500 ms] in GPW versus 9.4%(22/233) in the other units. Significant difference in QTc-changes was associated with sex (p = 0.02246). There was no correlation assessed between QTc-prolongation and age, number of psychotropic drugs or a specific single psychotropic drug (p [ 0.05). Conclusion: In this study QTc-prolongation due to psychotropic drugs is less common than previously described. ECG monitoring may be unnecessary in the follow up of patients without risk factors and could reduce hospital and community costs. However, considering the potential harm associated with TdP, QT-prolongation should be avoided. We recommend recording an ECG before the start of a QT-prolonging psychotropic drug in risk patients: patients with a chronic alcohol or drug addiction, a cardiac history, on concomitant therapy with at least two QT-prolonging psychotropic drugs, or geriatric patients ([65 years).",

Complete information on drug use is a prerequisite for all hospital treatment, whereas incomplete information represents a potential patient safety risk. Medication reconciliation is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as ''\u2026the formal process in which health care professionals partner with patients to ensure accurate and complete medication information transfer at interfaces of care.'' The objective of this study was to investigate the quality of the medication history obtained for admitted patients. Furthermore, measures to improve the quality of medication histories, i.e. implementation of medication reconciliation, were initiated. Design: The study included patients admitted to the internal medicine ward. A comprehensive medication history was determined by performing a standardized patient interview and/or by using relevant sources of information. The primary endpoint was discrepancies between the medication history obtained on admission and the one determined prospectively by a clinical pharmacist. The clinical relevance of the discrepancies was not determined, but sorted according to six major categories, such as: medication not in chart, but patient reports using (omission) and medication in chart, but patient reports not using (commission). Further on, in order to minimize the risk of discrepancies, it was focused on implementation of medication reconciliation. A campaign was initiated, where a clinical pharmacist held information meetings regarding the medication reconciliation procedure. For the next 9 weeks, the degree of medication reconciliation was recorded. To spur the degree of medication reconciliation, each ward's weekly numbers were published and the ward with the highest degree of medication reconciliation won a prize. Results: Among the 74 patients included, a total of 120 discrepancies were revealed. In summary, 50 patients had at least one discrepancy in their medication history, resulting in discrepancies in the medication lists of 68% of the included patients. At the start of the study, the level of medication reconciliation varied among the wards (23-54%), while at the end of the study the levels were increased (75-92%). Conclusion: All the included wards improved their level of medication reconciliation during the study period. However, these new combinations have potential drug-drug and herb-drug interactions which can affect the safety and effectiveness of the treatment. In our clinical practice, the clinical pharmacist provides patient education about direct acting antiviral drugs (DAA) based-regimens, promotes medication adherence and manages potential interactions with HCV treatment.",

Design: We included all adult patients on DAA treatment for HCV who were dispensed drugs from 01/09/2014 to 31/12/2015. We retrospectively recorded demographic data (age and gender), clinical data related to HCV infection (HCV genotype, fibrosis stage, DAA regimen and treatment outcomes) and type of herbal products consumed. We then assessed the presence of herb-drug interactions and the potential hepatotoxicity of herbal products. Results: We obtained data from 359 patients on DAA-based treatment for HCV. The prevalence of consumption of herbal products prior to starting the treatment was 20.61% (74/359). The most consumed herbal products were (prevalence [ 10% among herbal products users): milk thistle, green tea, chamomile, valerian, pennyroyal, boldo and artichoke. We detected four herbal products with potential hepatotoxic effects according to the literature: milk thistle, green tea, pennyroyal and aloe vera. The prevalence of consumption of these hepatotoxic plants among herbal products consumers were, respectively: 21.62, 17.57, 13.51 and 5.41%. We detected herb-drug interactions or potential for hepatotoxicity in 47 out of 74 patients who consumed herbal products. The management of these potential interactions consisted of stopping the herbal product before starting the HCV treatment. Conclusion: The consumption of herbal products in our HCV patients was frequent. The management of potential interactions was conservative, recommending to stop herbal products. Clinical pharmacists have an important role in the counselling, detection and management of potential herb-drug interactions and herbal products-related hepatotoxicity.",

            "text": "Poster discussion forum III: Hospital pharmacy and pharmaceutical care 2 Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Anaemia is a common comorbidity of chronic kidney disease. Intravenous (IV) iron is used when oral iron formulation became insufficient or to reduce the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in haemodialysis (HD) patients. The lack of generic group for IV iron sucrose (IS) preparations leads to a controversial issue about their clinical effectiveness. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of original IS compared to IS similar (ISS) in HD patients. Setting and method: A retrospective monocentric observational cohort study was conducted from 01/09/2014 to 31/08/2015, in a stable HD population to compare IS and ISS. The follow-up periods lasted 24 weeks and were separated by a one-month wash-out period. Original IS and ISS were administered respectively during the first (P1) and the second (P2) periods. The comparisons were performed using the paired Student's t test or the paired Wilcoxon test for continuous data and the Fisher's exact test for categorical data. Main outcome measures: The main endpoint was the difference in haemoglobin (Hb) levels between P1 and P2 per patient. Anaemia parameters (serum iron, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation ratio), the number of transfused patients, the doses of IV IS and the doses of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were compared before and after the switch from IS to ISS, as secondary endpoints. Results: A total of 105 patients were included. There was no significant difference in mean Hb value between P1 and P2 (6.78 \u00b1 0.63 mmol/L versus 6.79 \u00b1 0.59 mmol/L p = 0.97). Anaemia parameters were significantly different between P1 and P2 (mean serum ferritin, serum transferrin and transferrin saturation ratio) with p \\ 0.0001, except to the mean serum iron. The mean monthly dose of IV iron per patient and the mean dose of ESAs were respectively in P1 and in P2: 248.31 \u00b1 159.18 mg versus 259.74 \u00b1 158.92 mg (p = 0.39) and 0.46 \u00b1 0.50UI/kg/week versus 0.59 \u00b1 0.60UI/kg/ week (p = 0.005). Transfusions occurred less frequently in P1 than in P2 (p = 0.02). Conclusion: This study showed that ISS was as effective as original IS regarding Hb levels. However anaemia parameters appeared to be in favour of IS; the mean dose of ESAs seemed to be higher after switching from IS to ISS. These outcomes should be further explored using prospective comparative clinical studies. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: The pharmacy residents are sometimes up to deliver chemotherapy when they are on night or week-end duty at the hospital. A dispensation's error (delivery of Metoject \u00d2 (methotrexate) for intrathecal (IT) injection whereas it doesn't have the indication for this use), led us to test the pharmacy residents' knowledges about the IT access in order to underscore the points to be improved. The final aim of this work is to secure the pharmaceutical care of the patient 24 h a day, 7 days a week. Setting and method: An online and anonymous survey of 14 questions was sent to the 35 residents of our area. It was composed of three parts: specific general information, questions about the chemotherapy specifically (indication, maximum dose and volumes, molecules used), illustrated questions about real situation for the dispensation on duty. The answers were collected over a two weeks period. Main outcome measures: We studied the rate of good answers in global and by respondent. Results: Twenty-five residents answered the survey, among them 60% never achieved any internship in a centralized Unit of Reconstitution of Chemotherapy (URC). All the levels of internship are represented: 1st year (n = 4), 2nd year (n = 10), 3rd year (n = 7) and 4th year (n = 4). Only 32% know where a medicine is injected intrathecally on the spinal column, 64% know on which level of the meninges. Three residents think that a nurse can inject intrathecally. They also had to select the molecules which can be injected by this access: 20% answered vincristine, 8% vinblastine, 4% bortezomib; despite these three molecules are mortals if they are injected intrathecally. The majority know the indication of the IT chemotherapy: prevention and treatment of cancers' meningeal localizations. Sixty percent do not know that several molecules can be injected for the same patient in the same time. The maximum dose of methotrexate is known for half of the respondents, but only 28% for the cytarabine'one. Only 3 residents out of 25 know that 10 ml is the maximum volume allowed to be injected for an adult. Six residents would have delivered Metoject \u00d2 15 mg in pre syringe filled if a doctor had asked for an IT during a night. Lastly, there are only two people who know that Aracytine \u00d2 (cytarabine) 100 mg must be reconstituted with sodium chloride for IT use and not with the provided solvent containing benzylic alcohol. The score of the residents having already done an internship in an URC is 8.4/14 compared with 6.3/14 for those who never did. The respective scores per year of internship are 6.2 (1st year), 6.4 (2nd year), 7.4 (3rd year) and 7.9 (4th year). Conclusion: Results and answers have been presented in a meeting and sent to the residents. We initially note many gaps in knowledge. The residents who already worked in an URC and the elders got better results. All the residents could be on duty at the hospital and all must be formed. A second session will be organized in a month to evaluate the formation's impact. It also has been presented to the assistants during an interactive lesson. This formation is essential to guarantee the dispensation of the adequate product and a secured medical care of the patient. Please specify your abstract type: Descriptive abstract (for projects) Background and objective: Patient adherence to prescribed medications is crucial for reaching metabolic control goal. To better understand the impact of polypharmacy on medication adherence, we undertook a detailed survey of medication use among patients with endocrinologic diseases. The aim of this study was to determine medication adherence in a cohort of patients with endocrinologic diseases and to test the hypothesis that adherence decreases with increased number of medicines prescribed. Design: We conducted structured interviews to determine self-reported adherence of patient on a scale of 0 (high) to 4 (low observance) (SRAP-4) and a measurement using Morisky medication adherence scales . Demographic and medication information were collected from medical record. For statistical analysis, Mann-Whiney U-test for continuous variables, with Chi square for categorical variables and Kendall test for correlation were used. Results: Our cohort included 149 patients, 52% were women and 76% were diabetic (65% suffering from type 2 diabetes). The mean age was 56 \u00b1 14 years, the average number of medication was 7.3 \u00b1 4.1. 53 (36%) patients were not able to estimate their adherence. Patients reported SRAP-4 scale with an average of 1.1 \u00b1 0.9, this estimation was significantly higher than MMAS-4 with an average of 0.9 \u00b1 0.9 (p \\ 0.05). The proportion of adherence level were identical between SRAP-4 and MMAS-4 with respectively 51 and 60% of high, 45 and 35% of medium and 4 and 5% of low adherence. A significand correlation between SRAP-4 and MMAS-4 scales (r 2 = 0.58, p \\ 0.0001) was found. However no correlation between adherence scale and number of treatment (r 2 = 0.0001 for MMAS-4 and 0.01 for SRAP-4 scale) nor number of daily doses (r 2 = 0.0011 for MMAS-4 and 0.016 for SRAP-4 scale). On the 1080 medications, 11% presented difficulties with observance. Cardiovascular (34.5%), diabetes (25.9%) and psychiatric (13.8%) treatment are the three most involved drug classes in nonadherence. Conclusion: In this cohort, patients reported high medication adherence. We highlighted a correlation between SRAP-4 and MMAS-4 scales. Surprisingly, we didn't find correlation between adherence scales and number of treatment or dose by day. The next step of this work will be the identification of risk factor of nonadherence using logistic regression analysis.",

Setting and method: This study includes all dispensations of year 2015. In order to get medications in our hospital, a social worker and the patient come at the hospital's pharmacy. One people of retrocession team (four assistants, two externs, two residents and two pharmacists) dispenses necessary drugs to the patient according to hospital drug formulary and operating protocol. A switch or a special order can be purposed if the drug is not available. Then, we give the patient a Medication Management Plan (MMP) to explain him how to take his treatment at home. Retrocession team filled a quiz about this activity and ways to improve it. Main outcome measures: The main topics included in the quiz and evaluated were: dispensation organization, English talking, feeling during the interview and evaluation of the MMP. Results: Three hundreds and ten patients were admitted in OAH 2015. These patients come mainly from the Eastern Europe and do not speak French in most of cases. Social workers, who can help for communication, are not always present because these patients can come during on-call duty. Quiz results showed that weak points occurred during the interview: explanation of the MMP, languages barriers, mention '' if needed '' not understood by the patient. Explanation of the order for a particular drug was difficult to operate too. MMP were only drafted in French which was not convenient for foreign people. However, modalities of dispensation were well understood by the retrocession team.",

Design: Retrospective observational study that included 143 patients admitted in the ASNH. The ''Consensus Document on Terminology and Classification in Medication Reconciliation'' was considered for discrepancy classification. Data collected: Discrepancies between MP and PRT. In 84 patients from the original group of 143, we reviewed potentially severe drug interactions, potentially inappropriate MP and drug classes to avoid in older adults and medications to be used with caution in older adults (according to STOPP-START2014 and BEERS 2015) . All data were registered, measured and analysed in Excel \u00d2 . Results: 143 patients and a total of 1487 MP were reviewed. 367 discrepancies (24.7%) were found between the medical order and the PRT, those discrepancies included errors of omission in PRT (11.2%), absence of discontinuation of medication (8.3%), incorrect dosage (5.2%). Potentially moderate to severe interactions: the most frequent drug groups were proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (12.9%), benzodiazepines (BZDs) (9.7%), oral hypoglycemiants (9.7%), other groups with frequency over 5%, oral antihistaminic, statines, low molecular weight heparine (LMWH), laxatives, calcium salts and iron salts. 176 STOPP criteria were identified that affected to 440 MP and the distribution was as follows: laxative combinations (40.5%), long term PPIs (15.5%), CNS depressants combinations (11.4%), long half life BZDs combinations (10.9%), aspirin incorrect drug strength (9.1%) and other groups with lower frequencies, NSAIDS and prokinetics. START criteria: 12 being all of them by omission of the drug at the time of admission. BEERs 2015 criteria: 90 prescriptions in the ''avoid prescription in adults'' group of which corresponded largely to concomitantly CNS depressants and long term use of PPIs in no risk patients. Conclusion: The difficult working conditions, the excessive workload and the high staff turnover, where doctors have a patient ratio over 100/1, make difficult to update treatments according to patient daily needs. A clear communication problem between the hospital pharmacy and the ASNH prescribers exists due to lack of infrastructures, and it has been demonstrated with the high percentage of discrepancy, that implies an important logistic problem (not a safety problem) since the nurse team works directly with the original medical orders. The analysis of prescriptions showed the need for updating the medical knowledge. The high volume of STOP and BEERs criteria and lack of doctors time made impossible the individual acting upon each patient, so short summaries of continuous training related to most frequent problems have been designed. Please specify your abstract type: Descriptive abstract (for projects) Background and objective: Our French University Hospital is one of the most active centre for liver transplant (100 transplants annually). Various professionals are involved in the graft patient care and education. Much information and education sessions are exempted before and after the transplant. The objective of this work was to realize a short movie for patients (1) To get them ready for transplant (2) To give the key messages to support their transplant (3) To make family understanding the process and to promote the life behaviour changes. Design: Three members of the pharmaceutical team with nurses-led care coordination and a surgeon wrote the scenario. We requested two directors for 3 days of shooting. We defined the key points for the patient and places to film, and fixed the duration (7-12 min). The scenario was validated by the chief of the liver transplant unit and nurses-led care coordination. After the 3 days of film shooting, we selected sequences. Results: The movie was a succession of six parts. (1) The movie has been burned onto cds, put on flash-drives and will be uploaded on the internet. Because of the international origin of our patients, the video will be subtitled at least in English. The video will be broadcast to hospitals which do not transplant patients and refer them to our hospital. Since the medical team was involved in a collaborative project, the making of the video has permitted to strengthen the cohesion. Indeed, this work would not succeed if everybody did not express himself. Patients understood the interest to testify about their lived experience with the liver transplant, because they wished to have such information when they were waiting for the graft. Conclusion: This movie is very useful for patients and families who are looking for information before and after liver transplant. It is a tool to get them into condition patients. This video presents the advantage of being personalized (local and caregivers that the patient will encounter are filmed). Furthermore, it maintains a dynamic involvement of the pharmacy (already well established with clinical pharmacy, patient education and medication reconciliation) in the liver transplant unit. The making of the film has been an opportunity to bind the members of the team together, by valuing the work of everyone. The film could be screened if this abstract is selected for an oral communication.

Error reports and observations show great variation in the use of these procedures, primarily due to difficulties in their implementation and maintenance. Our aim was to assess the effect of a novel teaching strategy, the IMPALA project, on doctors and nurses compliance with the medication management procedures. Design: The project was carried out at 12 general medicine wards at Oslo University Hospital for a period of 6 weeks at each ward. Assessment of medication-related error reports yielded the following areas of focus: (I) correct medication prescription, (II) specification of doses for medications given on an ''as required''-basis, (III) double control of medication dosing, (IV) correct and documented generic substitution. Weekly presentations by pharmacist(s), lasting for a maximum of 15 min, were given to doctors and nurses as part of daily ward routines. This was repeated over 4 weeks. Data on medicationmanagement procedure compliance were recorded before the start of the intervention, during and after each intervention period. The results were presented and made available to both leaders and employees throughout the project period both as an incentive to improvement and as a motivation factor for continued effort. Results: There was a marked increase in medication-management procedure compliance among the nurses, especially after the second week of intervention. The most marked increase was shown for double control. Increase in medication-management procedure compliance was also present among the doctors, but was less prominent.",

Please specify your abstract type: Descriptive abstract (for projects) Background and objective: Genetic polymorphism or major physiological changes have to be considered in patient therapeutic management. Clinical pharmacists have a role to evaluate and optimize the appropriateness and effectiveness of patient's medications. We report here the impact of the clinical pharmacist and his collaboration with the clinical pharmacologist in the therapeutic management of a patient suffered from anorexia nervosa, a psychiatric disorder leading to body composition change that may influence drug pharmacokinetics and efficacy. Design: Case report. Results: The patient was a 35-year old woman hospitalized for chronic pulmonary aspergillosis previously treated by voriconazole, posaconazole and itraconazole. Her medical history included anorexia nervosa since 1997 with a body mass index of 9.8 kg m -2 , pulmonary tuberculosis in 2011 with relapse in 2013, and chronic pulmonary aspergillosis since 2014. At admission, a treatment by oral voriconazole at 100 mg/12 h was introduced. The trough concentration of voriconazole at steady state was \\0.1 mg/L (therapeutic range 1-4 mg/L) despite taking drug on empty stomach. Although the voriconazole dosage increased in 200 mg/12 h, the trough concentration did not increase significantly (0.2 mg/L). We hypothesized anorexia led to a significant mucosal atrophy and accordingly, a significant decrease in intestinal absorption surface which is a major determinant of the level of drug absorbed. Thus, a switch from oral to intravenous route was performed (voriconazole 200 mg/12 h). According to subtherapeutic voriconazole concentrations (trough concentration: 0.2 mg/L) despite the use of intravenous route, we decided to perform genotyping to look for mutations of cytochromes P450 3A4*22, 2C19*2 and 2C19*17, particularly implicated in voriconazole metabolism. The presence of an ultrarapid metabolizer genotype (17* allelic variant of the 2C19 isoenzyme) in our patient should lead to increase drug dosage from 50 to 75%. Finally, the patient was treated by intravenous voriconazole at 7 mg/kg/12 h (i.e., increase by 75%). The maximum concentration performed 24 h after IV route initiation was at 2.8 mg/L, suggesting a better efficacy. Conclusion: This case report highlights the potential complexity of therapeutic management in some patients given anatomical and functional changes or genetic polymorphism, which can affect drug efficacy. Clinical pharmacists in collaboration with clinical pharmacologists have to be able to help physicians in this type of situations. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Posaconazole (PCZ) is widely used for invasive fungal infections as prophylactic, pre-emptive or curative therapy in lung transplantation. Recently, a new formulation of PCZ has been available in enteric-coated tablets. This new formulation improves PCZ bioavailability, as compared to the oral suspension, which leads to increase PCZ plasma trough concentrations (C min ) in haematological patients. No data related to PCZ exposure and its effects on tacrolimus (TAC), an immunosuppressant with narrow therapeutic index widely used, exists in lung transplantation. We aimed to assess the consequences of the treatment by PCZ entericcoated tablets on PCZ and TAC exposure in lung transplant patients. Setting and method: A single-centre retrospective study was conducted among lung transplant patients receiving TAC and either enteric-coated PCZ or both galenic forms. Main outcome measures: PCZ and TAC exposure were estimated by the measurement of C min . To overcome the influence of dose (D), C min were adjusted on dose (C min /D) for both PCZ and TAC. A spearman test (nonparametric distribution) was performed to assess the correlation between PCZ C min /D and TAC C min /D. Results: Eighteen lung transplant patients (median age [Q1; Q3] = 48. 5 [34.7; 57.4] years; 50% female) were included between June 2015 and March 2016. Eight patients received only PCZ entericcoated tablets. PCZ enteric-coated tablets were associated to an increase in PCZ C min /D as compared to oral suspension (0.008 \u00b1 0.006 L -1 vs. 0.001 \u00b1 0.001 L -1 , p \\ 0.0001). Overall, PCZ therapy initiation led to an increase in TAC C min /D (0.002 \u00b1 0.001 L -1 before initiation vs. 0.008 \u00b1 0.007 L -1 after initiation, p = 0.02). TAC C min /D was significantly higher with PCZ enteric-coated tablets, as compared to PCZ oral suspension (0.004 \u00b1 0.004 L -1 vs. 0.009 \u00b1 0.006 L -1 , p \\ 0.0001). A weak correlation was observed between PCZ C min /D and TAC C min /D, independently to PCZ galenic form (r = 0.37, p = 0.0001 with PCZ enteric-coated tablets and r = 0.33, p = 0.02 with PCZ oral suspension). Conclusion: This pilot study in lung transplantation confirms the better bioavailability of PCZ enteric-coated tablets as compared to oral suspension. Our results show a more important increase in TAC exposure with PCZ enteric-coated tablets compared to PCZ oral suspension, suggesting a concentration-dependent CYP450 3A4 inhibitor effect of PCZ. These findings are of interest in clinical practice to monitor transplant patients treated by the new formulation of PCZ. Further analyses, including the consideration of confounders, will be conducted.

Based on temporal and clinical plausibility as well as published literature, the objective was to determine the causal relationship between agranulocytosis and apixaban. Design: Description of two agranulocytosis cases reported in our hospital. Results: First case is an 89 years old male, admitted to the neurology unit (D0) for ischemic stroke. At admission, blood count showed no abnormalities. Four days after admission, treatment administered consisted in: dextrose 5% infusion IV, sodic heparin IV, acetaminophen, atorvastatin, metoprolol. Neutrophils count was normal (5.6 G/l). Heparin was stopped at D9 and replaced with apixaban according to following dose regimen 2.5 mg twice a day. At D15, patient presented with hyperleukocytosis (neutrophils count 15 G/l) and high CRP (109 mg/l). Thus, a cytobacteriological urine test was performed. At D17, patient presented with hypothermia followed by hyperthermia related to acute sepsis. Blood count showed agranulocytosis (neutrophils count 0.45 G/l). Broad spectrum antibiotherapy was started (ceftriaxone and gentamycin). Despite treatment, death of patient occurred at D17. The suspected cause of death was septic shock added to severe febrile neutropenia. Following haemocultures confirmed sepsis (E. coli) possibly originating from urinary tract infection.",

A treatment with heparin was immediately started in association with patient usual treatment (bisoprolol, valsartan, rosuvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide and manidipine). In addition, broad spectrum IV antibiotherapy was started with ceftriaxone and spiramycine followed at D7 by an oral treatment with cefixime and spiramycine until D12. Heparin was replaced by apixaban at D1 (2.5 mg twice daily). Antihypertensive treatment was adapted throughout patient's stay. Patient presented neutropenia at D15 (neutrophils count 0.8 G/L), followed by agranulocytosis at D19 (neutrophils count 0.42 G/l) when it was decided to replace treatment with apixaban by fluindione. The following day, neutrophils count was about 0.28 G/l and patient received filgrastim. A myelogram showed a possible peripheral neutropenia. In the absence of other confounding factors (HIV, HBV, HCV, CMV), an iatrogenic agranulocytosis related to apixaban was suspected. Conclusion: Causal association with heparin is unlikely as neutropenia is not an adverse drug reaction known included in the SmPC of this drug having a well-established safety profile. Since the two patients were taking their usual treatment for a significant period of time, a causal relationship is deemed unlikely. Temporal and clinical plausibility seem to indicate a possible relationship between agranulocytosis and apixaban. As this medicine has been recently approved, this might explain why no case has been reported in the literature and the absence of agranulocytosis as an adverse drug reaction of apixaban. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Taste is tightly connected to children's acceptability of medicines. Two ways to overcome lack of acceptability are to administer solid formulations which are easier to taste mask and change to better tasting medicines. Dicloxacillin is an antibiotic known for its unpalatability, and taste studies suggest that this might jeopardize its adherence. The aim of this study was to explore if prescription data can be used to estimate acceptability of antibiotics among children on a population level using dicloxacillin as an example drug. The research questions were: When comparing dicloxacillin with other antibiotics commonly used in children, (1) is there a difference in the age of conversion from liquid to solid formulation and (2) is there a difference in re-prescription rates on day 1 and 2 after the initial prescription? Setting and method: We included all initial prescriptions of oral dicloxacillin, phenoxymethylpenicillin, amoxicillin and erythromycin for children 0-12 years registered in the Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD) 2005-2007 due to dicloxacillin mixture being discontinued from the Norwegian market in 2007. The age of conversion was defined as the age where half of the children were prescribed liquids and the other half prescribed solid formulations. Re-prescription rates were defined as re-prescriptions of a different antibiotic or formulation on day 1 and 2 after the initial prescription, divided by the total number of prescriptions. Main outcome measures: Age of conversion and re-prescription rates of dicloxacillin compared with other common antibiotics. Results: The age of conversion for dicloxacillin was 4.5 years, compared to 7 years for other common antibiotics. The average represcription rate for dicloxacillin was 8.2% for children 0-6 years and 1.8% % for children 7-12 years. The highest re-prescription rate of 13.3% was found in 2-year olds. Corresponding numbers were 2.1, 1.8 and 2.3% for common antibiotics. Conclusion: The lower age of conversion from liquid to solid formulation and higher re-prescription rate of dicloxacillin mixture compared to common antibiotics indicates that prescription data can be used to identify antibiotics with low acceptability for children 0-12 years. Further studies are needed to investigate if this also holds true for other antibiotics.

Please specify your abstract type: Descriptive abstract (for projects) Background and objective: Self-induced drug intoxications (SIDI) are one of the most frequent reasons of hospitalization in emergency service (1%) with around 4-5/1000 inhabitants and represent around 6% of admissions in intensive care unit (ICU). It is the most frequently used method of suicide attempts (SA) and the leading cause of hospitalization for young people under 30. The main objective of our study was to analyse, stratify and pharmaceutically map the different SIDI identified in our ICU. Design: This is a prospective study over 20 months, including all ICU patients following SIDI from June 2014 to January 2016. We have collected psychiatric history and previous SA by SIDI, usual treatment, state of consciousness, incriminating drugs, drug classes stratified according to the clinical severity score IGSII, evolution, transfer in a specialized centre and average cost of stay. Results: Ninety-two cases were reported, representing 6% of ICU admissions. The average hospital stay was 3 days for an average cost of 3396.5\u20ac. This amount is low compared with the average cost of all stays gone through the ICU for the period (14,957\u20ac). Ninety percent of patients had a psychiatric history and 48% a previous SA. The usual treatment was involved in 77% of SIDI. Half of the patients arrived conscious with an average of severity score IGSII of 35/163, 88 being the highest found for a patient who had swallowed simultaneously pregabalin and nitrazepam. Clinical severity of these patients is less than that found on average for all patients in the ICU in this period (59/163). Eighty-seven percent had a favorable evolution. Only one death was observed after ingestion of propranolol. Fifty-six and a half percent of patients were then hospitalized in a specialized centre. The great family of psychotropic is the most frequent with benzodiazepines 70%, neuroleptics 36%, antidepressants 31.5% and antiepileptic 17.5%. The main drugs involved are oxazepam 16%, alprazolam 15%, cyamemazine 14%, bromazepam 13% and quetiapine 8%. Antihypertensives then arrive and represent 14% of SIDI. The stratification of severity scores does not appear to show significant differences between drug classes, nor between mono or polydrug ingestions. Conclusion: SA by drug ingestion are very common and are often linked to risky behaviours. For these epidemiological and economic findings, it is necessary to continue and develop prevention strategies avoiding the appearance of intoxication (primary), limiting the consequences (secondary), and reducing the risk of recurrence (tertiary).",

Interventions often result in statistically significant quality of life (QoL) improvement, but may not reach the threshold of clinical importance. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) is the minimal score change of relevance clinically. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the impact on quality of life of topical, systemic and biologic treatments for psoriasis in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Setting and method: PRISMA guidelines were followed. All available articles describing RCTs of therapies for psoriasis that included QoL measurements published up to November 2014 were identified. Six databases were examined with 388 search terms. Abstracts of articles were reviewed independently by two assessors: a third adjudicator resolved any opinion differences. Risk of bias was assessed using the JADAD scale. Main outcome measures: Reporting of the use of QoL endpoints and impact of interventions in psoriasis. Results: Of 3597 screened article abstracts, 329 articles were selected for detailed review: 100 trials met the eligibility criteria, describing research on a total of 33,215 patients. Reports of psoriasis interventions that fulfilled inclusion criteria have gradually increased over time : 1998-2004 = 12, 2005-2009 = 33, and 2010-2014 = 55 (1) to evaluate the relationship between the use of different therapeutic agents and the severity of OSA, and (2) to determine the effects of commonly used medications on Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). Setting and method: Patient medical records (N = 2688) of 183 patients, that underwent sleep studies between the years 2009 and 2013 were collected over an eight-month period from the Sleep Laboratory Department at Mater Dei Hospital using a random sampling technique. Data collected included body mass index, gender, age, Epworth sleepiness score (ESS), drug history, apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI) and CPAP therapy prescription. Likelihood ratio Chi square test, Paired samples t-test and Multinomial logistic regression were the statistical tests used for data analysis. Main outcome measures: Assessment of the drug history in response to OSA control using the ESS and AHI scores. Results: One hundred and seventy (92.9%) patients of the 183 patients (131 males, 52 females) were diagnosed with OSA. Forty-five (24.6%), 43 (23.5%) and 82 (44.8%) patients suffered from mild, moderate and severe OSA respectively. Patients had a mean age of 54 years. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs) (p-value = 0.022), sulphonylureas (p-value = 0.050), insulin therapy (p-value = 0.040) and non-benzodiazepine sedating agents (p-value = 0.037) were found to be associated with the presence of OSA. A decline in the use of the ARBs (p-value = 0.000), Angiotensin converting Enzyme Inhibitors (p-value = 0.000) and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (pvalue = 0.001) was observed over the study year period. Reduction in the CPAP therapy benefit was detected with the use of Histamine (H 1 ) antagonists (p-value = 0.015), b-adrenergic blocking agents (pvalue = 0.001) and antiplatelets (p-value = 0.003). Conclusion: It is confirmed that hypertension and diabetes mellitus type II are the main co-morbidities associated with the presence of OSA. Reduction in the use of certain therapeutic agents is observed secondary to CPAP therapy use. Patients using specific drugs have been identified as being at risk of a reduced CPAP therapy benefit. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: People are using increasingly more common of social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube for different purposes. Many people are using these networks with the aim of getting information and knowledge sharing. There are many groups that pharmacist is a member in social networks at Turkey. The largest of these groups has 14,000 members. Pharmacists are shared common problems, information and experiences in these groups. But the accuracy of the information shared on social networks are not always conclusive. The study aim to evaluate the impact of social network information sharing in the knowledge and attitude of pharmacists. Setting and method: Clinical pharmacy group has been created to share information on Facebook. 2400 pharmacist joined this clinical pharmacy group. The group was fed by information which include new drugs, FDA alerts, adverse event and case report and also drug related problems during the 6 months. Pharmacists were assigned in two major groups, group A active pharmacist who becomes a member of our clinical pharmacy group, share and discuss information through the network and group B who is not a member. A knowledge measurement survey (AMS) was given to both of them. Main outcome measures: Acknowledge measurement survey (AMS) was developed and the difference in the score was used to evaluate the difference between the two study groups. Results: 142 pharmacists participated in the study, 34.50% of the participants were a member of our Facebook group and 65.49% of participants were not. 4.9% of the participants have doctoral degree or student, 15.4% have master degree or student, 32% have bachelor degree from 4 year-pharmacy faculty, 47.1% have bachelor degree from 5 year-pharmacy faculty. The education level distribution between the two groups was not statistically significant. While 63.64% of the AMS questions were answered correctly in the member group only 44.09% were answered correctly in the non-member group. Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of social network in providing the accurate and fastest information for the daily use of the pharmacists, there is a significant difference in knowledge between the pharmacist who join, share and discuss information on the social network and the one who do not join.",

The study aims: (1) to understand possible differences in professionalism between pharmacy students and potential community pharmacist preceptors, and (2) to evaluate student changes in professionalism upon completing the community pharmacy practice experiences (CPPE) at the end of the third (P3) year. Setting and method: A modified Chisholm's Pharmacy Professionalism Instrument (18-item, 10-point Likert scale) was administered to P3 students, pre-CPPE and hopefully post-CPPE in September, and community pharmacist practitioners who participated in a two-day preceptor training workshop. Participants also provided their significance ratings toward ten traits, namely altruism, accountability, excellence, duty, honor and integrity, respect for others, communication, ethics, humanism, and teamwork. Main outcome measures: Differences or changes in Chisholm professionalism scores. Results: Thirty-two students and fifty pharmacists participated in the survey. Honor and integrity (8.9 \u00b1 1.5) and communication (9.2 \u00b1 1.1) were recognized by students (31.3%) and pharmacists (23.5%), respectively, as the most significant trait. Humanism was rated the lowest in both groups (students, 8.2 \u00b1 1.9; pharmacists, 8.1 \u00b1 1.9). The 18-item professionalism scores ranged from 6.6 \u00b1 1.6 (''I do not expect anything in return when I help someone.'') to 9.3 \u00b1 0.9 (''I am respectful to individuals who have different backgrounds than mine.'') in the student group; whereas 8.1 \u00b1 1.9 (''I do not expect anything in return when I help someone.'') to 9.5 \u00b1 1.1 (''It is wrong to cheat to achieve higher rewards (i.e., grades, money).'') in the pharmacist group. In general, pharmacists' professionalism scores were higher and, in certain items, statistically significant differences were achieved. Conclusion: Professionalism might grow with professional competency and practice experiences as demonstrated by potential pharmacist preceptors. Upon completion of CPPE, students could probably exhibit gains in professionalism. More investigations are still underway.

The aim of this work is to standardize our pharmacists' intervention and to propose guidelines for doctors and pharmacists, depending on the situation and drugs, to limit these combinations and to reduce this risk at our hospital centre (1105 beds). Design: A prospective survey was realized over a period of 5 months to identify the drug combinations prescribed in medical prescription software, from the National drug agency thesaurus, that might be inducing torsade de pointes. A multidisciplinary staff was then constituted composed of a cardiologist, a geriatrician, a paediatrician, an anaesthesiologist, a psychiatrist and pharmacists to identify the different situations and to establish guidelines. Results: From the survey 18 drug combinations were found to be contraindicated due to increased risk of inducing torsade de pointes on a list 415 interventions realized by pharmacists. The work group identified three drugs with a therapeutic alternative: Hydroxyzine, Domperidone, Escitalopram, the other drugs can't be switched because they are vital or have no alternative. The work group decided to maintain Hydroxyzine but only on premedication and child anxiety, to eject Domperidone from our therapeutic index and substitute it with Metoclopramide or Metopimazine, to not initialize Escitalopram but to keep it if the patient has no have others risk factors associated or no contraindication. If the patient has a contraindication with a risk factor the doctor could prescribe other SSRI. In addition, pharmacists alert doctors about the risk of torsade de pointes on medical prescription software if some contraindications are identified. Conclusion: The contraindications identified must not be underestimated. This work allows identification of torsadogenic drugs commonly prescribed and provides guidance for doctors and pharmacists regarding drug combinations. The collective decision will be disseminated to sensitize all the doctors in the establishment. Some treatments could not be substituted despite the contraindication; these must be retained but with clinical monitoring. Conclusion: A substantial proportion of medication waste in the community pharmacy could have been prevented. Unused medicines in the community pharmacy are generally of low economic value, making it unlikely that the costs that pharmacies will make with the redispensing of unused medicines will be covered. Therefore, other actions to decrease medication waste in the community pharmacy, such as preventing that too much medicines are dispensed, should be considered.

Half of the pharmacies discussed the difference between use for preventive treatment of asthma and inhaler that is being used for treatment of attacks. Sixty-five pharmacies gave no information about the importance of regular use of the preventive treatment.

Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: In Portugal, tobacco addiction was responsible for over 12,000 deaths in 2013 (11% of the total deaths). The community pharmacist's contribution to control this public health problem is insufficiently documented. The aim of this study is to assess the contribution of the community pharmacist for smoking cessation. Setting and method: A retrospective and longitudinal study of a convenience sample of patients integrating quit tobacco consultations, as part of a pharmaceutical care programme implemented by an outsourced pharmacist was performed at several community pharmacies. The smokers, aged 18 or over, were invited to join the programme. Patients signed an informed consent and were submitted to a comprehensive approach by face-to-face consultations and telephone contacts. Richmond and Fagerstr\u00f6m tests were used to evaluate motivation and nicotine dependence, respectively. The therapeutic plan (pharmacotherapy and behavioural counselling) was personalised to each smoker. The quit rates were evaluated by patient selfreport and confirmed by carbon monoxide measurements. The continuous variables are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean. Main outcome measures: Quit rates at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. Results: Between January 2009 and June 2016, 87 smokers joined the programme, 22 dropouts (25.3%). The remaining 65 smokers, 40 (61.5%) were male, with mean age of 48.4 \u00b1 1.91 years. On average, each smoker consumed 21.0 \u00b1 1.53 cigarettes per day. The mean age of initial tobacco use was 15.8 \u00b1 0.51 years with 31.4 \u00b1 1.98 years of consumption. About 70% reported moderate or high motivation and 60% medium or high dependence. A total of 315 consultations were held and, on average, each patient received 7.3 \u00b1 0.82 interventions. All smokers received non-pharmacological interventions (e.g. motivational approach) and 61 (93.8%) also accepted pharmacological interventions, usually nicotine replacement products. The quit day was achieved by 50 patients (57.5%). A month after quit date, 41 patients were abstinent (41.7%). The number reduced to 32 after 3 months (36.8%), to 27 after 6 months (31.0%) and to 19 after 1 year (21.8%). These data upgrade and are consistent with our previously published results (2014).",

Consequently the number of patients, which have to manage the complex treatment with OADs at home is increasing. The pharmacists present an important member of healthcare team, since they are dispensing OADs to the patients, which need a high quality information at that crucial moment. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate pharmacists perceived confidence and needs for specific continuing education in connection to OADs dispensing in European countries. Setting and method: We used an electronic mailing approach and a standardized online survey to ask practicing pharmacists in European countries about their experience with dispensing of OADs. Main outcome measures: frequency of patient counselling and fields of counselling, assessment of knowledge and skills. Results: The frequency of patient counselling varied widely in participating countries between ''never'' and ''more than 80%'' at initial fill of an OAD. At following refills the frequency of counselling was generally even lower. Counselling mostly encompassed directions of use, the proper use of antiemetics and side effects. However many pharmacists stated, that they do not feel comfortable counselling patients of OADs (25%) and even more acknowledged that they were uncomfortable with managing patients' side effects (20%). On the other hand only 45% of pharmacists believed, that they have received adequate knowledge of OADs through undergraduate program, continuing education (CE) events and professional practice. Many of pharmacists (70%) have not attended any of CE events related to oncology in last 2 years. Pharmacists' responses differed little between the countries. Conclusion: The proportion of pharmacists who regularly counsel their patients on OADs is insufficient in view of importance of the patients' needs to manage their therapy at home. However the pharmacists seems to be aware of their knowledge deficits and educational needs. The field of OADs needs better coverage in under-and postgraduate education. The number of CEs has to be increased in order to improve the knowledge and skills in the areas of OADs counselling.

Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Medication adherence is one of the key aspects in assuring optimal health outcomes in majority of chronic diseases. The aim of the study was to evaluate COPD patients' medication adherence in Slovenia and its association with health outcomes. Setting and method: Patients were recruited by community pharmacists at the time of dispensing medication for COPD. Medication adherence was evaluated by using Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8). Patients who scored B6 points, 6.25-7.75 points and 8 points were regarded to have poor, moderate and good adherence, respectively. Quality of life was evaluated by Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the impact of disease by COPD Assessment Test (CAT). The study was conducted in September 2014 and February 2015. The association between potential predictors and COPD impact or quality of life was estimated using multiple linear regression in IBM SPSS Statistics version 23. Main outcome measures: Medication adherence rate (MMAS-8), quality of life (SGRQ Total score) and impact of disease (CAT score). Results: Of 65 patients, majority were men (68%) with mean age 70 years. In average, patients were prescribed 2.5 medicines for COPD and 3.8 medicines for other diseases. Good, moderate and low adherence to COPD medication regimens was found in 53.4, 32.8 and 13.8% of patients, respectively. Mean CAT scores and SGRQ scores were 17.3 (range 3-34) and 41.3 (range 2-79), respectively. Thirtyeight percent of patients experienced an exacerbation in the past year. Linear regression showed no statistically significant association between medication adherence and quality of life or COPD impact on patient. Factors that statistically significantly predicted patients' quality of life were exacerbation in the past year, education level and number of concomitant medicines for other diseases. The latter was found to be the only factor associated with COPD impact. Conclusion: The study showed half of the COPD patients to be optimally adherent to their treatment and only a small proportion of patients not taking their medicines regularly. Due to the nature of the disease medication adherence does not seem to play the most important role in assuring optimal health outcomes in COPD patients. Please specify your abstract type: Descriptive abstract (for projects) Background and objective: Intermediate care units (IMCU) are designed to serve patients in need of more advanced medical care than the ordinary nursing home units can provide. The aim of this study was to see; (1) how medication information follows patients in and out of ICMU and nursing home short-termcare units (STCU) (2) the type and amount of drug related problems (DRP), focusing inappropriate drugs, and (3) if there are differences between the ICMU and STCU in drug use and DRPs. Design: Patients C65 years old admitted and submitted at the IMCU or STCU in the study period (10 weeks) were included. Transfer of medication information were evaluated and given a score. The clinical pharmacist provided medication reconciliation upon admission, medication review and monitoring, and presented identified DRPs and a suggestion for solving the problem, to the multidisciplinary team. Inappropriate drugs, identified by screening tools (STOPP/NorGep), and systematic medication reviews, were recorded. Results: 14 patients from IMCU and five from STCU were included. A hospital discharge summary including medical history followed mostly all patients. The score of the medication history was 7.5 points out of 16. By submission from either IMCU or STCU, the score was 8.6. Systematic drug review identified 3.9 DRP in the IMCU and 2.0 in the STCU. IMCU patients used 9.5 drugs, STCU patients 10. In the ICU, 14% of the identified DRPs was inappropriate drugs, none in the STCU. The clinical pharmacist in the multidisciplinary team presented 92% of the identified DRPs. The doctors agreed in 80% of the suggestions for solution, and started immediate changes in 43%. Conclusion: A hospital discharge summary followed the patients, but the medical history part needs improvement. Although few patients, the results suggest that IMCU patients had more complicated medication and more inappropriate drugs than STCU patients did. Clinical pharmacist in a multidisciplinary team provides useful contribution to identify, solve and prevent clinical relevant DRPs, including inappropriate drugs.

By now 179 (81%) of these patients have received a patient interview. 143 goal attainment scales were formulated yet. The number of GAS ranged from 0 to 3 per patient. The four most frequent GAS were: polypharmacy-reducing the number of medicines (28), reducing pain (23), increasing mobility (16), reducing fatigue (15). Conclusion: GAS seem to be a feasible approach during medication review that increased focus on patient's needs and health-related complaints.",

OTFC are usually use off-label prescription, especially in noncancer patients or patients without opioid maintenance treatment. This practice can expose to iatrogenic risks, lack of efficacy, abuse and addiction. The Observatory of Drugs, Medical Devices and Therapeutic Innovation of Upper Normandy, conducted a study to assess the knowledge of pharmacists on these medications and assess dispensing practices (pharmaceutical analysis and advice to patients). Design: Between June and September 2015, two quizzes were sent to the 1344 pharmacists and 512 pharmacies in Upper Normandy: one included questions of knowledge and general practice, the other assess dispensing practices of OTFC prescriptions received at the counter, regarding indication, dosage and associated opioid medication. Results: Of the 93 pharmacists who participate in the survey, 21% know the all of the 7 OFTC specialties, 46% of them confuse transdermal and transmucosal fentanyl specialties. Indication, dosage, titration methods and the main interest of OFTC are known by 52, 43, 18 and 71% of them. Only 30% have dispensed OFTC more than 10 times over the past 12 months, 28% never have. They already have dispensed OFTC in noncancer patients (45%) or without opioid maintenance treatment (36%). They consider not know enough about these drugs to be able to provide the necessary advice to patient (57%) and would like specific training on OFTC (89%). Of the 21 analyzed prescriptions, only 24% are consistent with the marketing authorization: OTFC medicines are prescribing in noncancer patient (52%) and/or dosage is higher than four units per day (24%) and/or there is no prescribed opioid maintenance treatment (24%). Only two prescriptions have been discussed with the prescriber, and all were approved and dispensed. Conclusion: OTFC specialties are occasionally dispensed and often misunderstanding by pharmacists. A good knowledge of OTFC is necessary to achieve the pharmaceutical analysis and provided appropriate advice to patients, in order to guarantee the good use of these medicines. Support tools for dispensation, recalling indication, . The most frequent interventions were drug substitution (n = 132), dose adjustment (n = 57), and clarification of information (n = 48). Common services were reconstitution of suspension (n = 7), provision in advance for continuing supply (n = 26), and follow up offers (n = 3). Conclusion: The observation of the dispensing process in community pharmacies revealed a broad range of tasks performed by the pharmacy and identified several variables likely to influence the counselling. In addition, pharmacy activities could be pictured by the documentation of pharmaceutical interventions. Please specify your abstract type: Descriptive abstract (for projects) Background and objective: Medication reconciliation (MR) is a multidisciplinary process to correct medication errors resulting from miscommunicated information at transitions of care. Development of this activity is essential but it is hindered by the time required for its implementation. We must carefully choose which services can develop this activity. As it was recently introduced in cardiac surgery unit, this study aims to evaluate impact of this process to hospital admission (severity of potential harm of medication error intercepted) and to determine the relevance of this activity in this unit. Design: Prospective study conducted from January 2016 to April 2016. The data is recorded in an EXCEL table, filled after each MR. There are five items: patient's age, best possible medication histories (BPMH), implementation period of the MR, inadvertent discrepancies (IDs) and clinical impact. To assess the severity of IDs, a scoring method was used (Doerper et al. 2015) with the cooperation of surgeon and pharmacist. Results: Eighty-two patients (mean age 68 \u00b1 8 years old) were included in the study, which represents 52% of the patients hospitalized in this service. The mean number of drugs per patient was 6 \u00b1 3. The BPMH were obtained within 24 h to 72 h of admission to hospital. A total of 34 IDs were detected, with a mean of 0.41 IDs per patient. The most frequent type of IDs was omission (52%, n = 16), error of dose (39%, n = 12). The three most common classes involved in IDs were hypolipaemic drug (n = 9), antidiabetic drugs (n = 6) and the drugs for acid related disorders (n = 4). The mean of IDs per patient (0.41) as well as the percentage of patients affected by a IDs (32%) are less important in cardiac surgery than those observed in other services of the institution and in the literature.",

Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Special packaging like multidose drug dispensing (MDD) may optimize medication use in patients with a decreased ability to manage their own medication. However, it remains unclear how a 'decreased ability to manage medication' is defined. The objective of this study is to assess potential medication problems that contribute to a decreased ability to manage medication in patients starting with MDD compared to patients who use manually-dispensed drugs. Setting and method: Patients starting with MDD (cases) and patients using manually-dispensed drugs (controls) were interviewed in 45 community pharmacies. Questions to assess potential medication problems covered three domains; medication adherence (12), practical management issues (12) and medication knowledge (2) . Every potential medication problem was scored with one point. Cognition was assessed with the Mini-Cog and frailty with the Groningen Frailty Index (GFI). Main outcome measures: Mean scores of potential medication problems on the domains medication adherence, practical management issues and medication knowledge. Results: 188 patients starting with MDD and 230 patients using manually-dispensed drugs were interviewed. Patients starting with MDD scored more potential medication problems on all domains: adherence 5.5 versus 1.7, practical management issues 3.7 versus 2.1, medication knowledge 1.1 versus 0.3. On the three domains together, patients starting with MDD scored 10.2 [9.6-10.9] potential medication problems compared to 4.1 [3.7-4.6 ] for patients with manuallydispensed drugs. Forty-two percent of the patients starting with MDD might be cognitive impaired and 63% was classified as frail compared to 20 and 27% respectively of the patients using manually-dispensed drugs. Conclusion: Patients starting with MDD reported significantly more potential problems on three domains that may contribute to a decreased ability to manage their medication.",

Validated tools that assess patient knowledge exist for vitamin K antagonists, but not for NOACs. We aimed to identify which questions are relevant for patient knowledge on NOACs. Setting and method: Based on a systematic literature search, 45 questions were compiled for the assessment of NOACs knowledge. Key questions were selected through three rounds of ranking by an expert panel (four physicians, four pharmacists, four nurses). Round 1 (online survey; importance): The 45 questions grouped into the nine educational topics of Wofford,adapted for NOAC (Disease, Mode of action, Risk-benefit, Adherence, Accessing healthcare professionals, Diet/life-style, Lab-monitoring, Medication interactions, Self-care) were to be rated as important/not important and educational topics were to be ranked according to decreasing importance. Round 2 (online survey; relevance): The questions were to be ranked according to decreasing relevance. Round 3 (focus group): number of questions was reduced by voting. Main outcome measures: Ranking of educational topics and questions (1 = most important/relevant) in March/April 2016. Results: Experts ranked Adherence (2.2 \u00b1 0.9) as the most important topic, followed by Risk-benefit (3.0 \u00b1 1.6), Disease (3.7 \u00b1 2.7), Accessing healthcare professionals (4.1 \u00b1 2.0), Self-care (5.3 \u00b1 2.6), Lab-monitoring (5.6 \u00b1 1.6), Medication interactions (6.5 \u00b1 1.8), Diet/life-style (7.3 \u00b1 0.9) and Mode of action (7.8 \u00b1 1.5). One question was judged as unimportant by all experts. Out of the remaining 44 questions, 10 (22.7%) were selected as relevant for basic knowledge, 7 (15.9%) were combined into four questions and one new question was generated. A total of 15 key questions remained after the focus group discussion. Conclusion: A multiprofessional expert panel was able to select key questions retrieved from literature and ensured content validity. The selected questions will be compiled into a tool to assess patient knowledge on NOACs. Background and objective: Medicines use review (MUR) was defined by the Slovene Chamber of Pharmacies in December 2014 and an education program was set to assure pharmacists competencies. In June 2015 the first pharmacists were certified and implemented the service in the community pharmacies. Additionally, an online database was established to collect MUR reports and provide feedback on pharmacists' performance. The aim of the study was to evaluate identified drug related problems (DRP) as well as pharmacists' interventions from MUR documentation. Setting and method: A preliminary retrospective analysis of documentation for MUR services provided in the first year after implementation was performed. DRPs were classified using a Slovenian DRP classification system, which is based on the PCNE classification V 6.2 [1] . Data were analysed with descriptive statistics measures.",

However, thirty-two (45.7%) pharmacists recommended various medication regimens, including antibiotics. Of them, 67.1% referred the simulated patient to a physician. Conclusion: In conclusion, it was observed that dispensing antibiotics without prescription was still high, pharmacists did not take comprehensive medical or medication history from patients, and pharmacists provided insufficient medication information to the patient regarding suggested medications at community pharmacy setting. To avoid irrational antibiotic dispensing, it is essential to educate both health care providers and the general population.

Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: The medication adherence is an important part of active (as well as passive) attitude of a patient to the disease treatment. It represents the level of keeping the treating procedure as well as the recommendations of doctors, pharmacists and other healthcare professionals. This study deals with the adherence in patients with hypertension. The hypertensive patients are a substantial part of patients, daily visiting the community pharmacy to pick their prescriptions. These patients represent group of patients with typical asymptomatic disease. This means that they do not take the medicines or use them according to their own will. The result of their non-adherence could lead to later complications. The aim of the study was to evaluate the level of adherence and its relation to the clinical outcome-the blood pressure in hypertensive patients. Setting and method: The methodology was based on a single anonymous questionnaire survey combined with the blood pressure measuring in a community pharmacy in Slovakia. The modified Morisky 4-item medication adherence tool was used in this study. Main outcome measures: The results of medication adherence were evaluated as follows: 3-4 points = full adherence, 2 points = partial adherence and 0-1 = non-adherence. Each participant should use at least one antihypertensive agent and fulfil the anonymous questionnaire in the community pharmacy. The pharmacist measured the blood pressure in each participant twice, within the interval of 10 min and used the average value in data sheet. Results: The research included 150 hypertensive patients (55.33% females and 44.67% males). The results showed that almost 46% of the respondents were non-adherent to the prescribed pharmacotherapy (57.98% of those were males and 42.02% were females). The group of partially adherent patients consisted of 35.33% of the respondents (66.04% of those were female).

Setting and method: The anonymous, face-to-face questionnaire survey was set in the community pharmacy in Slovakia. Questionnaire obtained questions on socio-behavioural factors and adherence tool-modified 8-item Morisky score (mMMAS-8). Main outcome measures: Respondents were 150 patients (39 males, 111 females) using at least one antidepressant. The results were evaluated as follows: 8 points = full adherence, 6-7 points = partial adherence and 0-5 = non-adherence. Results were evaluated in relation to socio-behavioural factors. Results: Average level of the medication adherence in our group was 5113, which means the line between partial and full adherence. The results showed non-significant higher medication adherence level in males (5179) compared to females (5090). The highest level of medication adherence (5367) has been shown in patients 45-64 years old, the lowest average adherence level (non-adherence) was observed in patients up to 24 years old (4656). Patient living in the city were more adherent to their medication (5127) compared to patients living in countryside (5083). The highest level of the partial medication adherence has been shown in secondary educated patients (5344). Partial adherence level was higher in patients with monthly income over 1000 \u20ac (5750) compared to non-adherent patients with monthly income up to 300\u20ac (4878). In patients using no other medications, only antidepressant, we have observed the highest partial adherence (5219). Conclusion: Our survey showed the partial antidepressant medication adherence levels in our study group. Poor adherence results in low stabilization of clinical state in patient, in using more types of therapy and in increasing costs. There might be very important role of the community pharmacists and other health care professionals to improve the medication adherence and persistence through counselling and education patients on importance and need of antidepressant medication.

To achieve this there is a need for reliable information about patients' diagnosis, and what is recorded as the drug's indication in different electronical and handwritten health records. The aim of this study was to examine the registered diagnoses, and indications for drug use in nursing home patients. We also wanted to study the extent to which diagnoses are untreated with drugs, as well as the extent to which drugs have a registered indication for use and a suitable recorded diagnosis. Setting and method: Data was collected for 70 long-term patients, on average 83 years old, and 66% females from four nursing homes in Troms\u00f8 municipality, Norway. We retrieved information about patients' diagnoses and indication for drug use from the electronic health record and written drug charts. Two pharmacists conducted the linkage between the reported diagnoses and drug use. Main outcome measures: Percentage of untreated diagnoses and the percentage of drugs with a registered indication for use. Results: As considered by the pharmacists, 70% of the registered diagnoses was untreated with drugs. Dementia, gout and osteoporosis were the most commonly untreated diagnoses with, 97, 60 and 57%, respectively. In comparison, the indication for use listed on the patients' drug charts was reported for 82% of the drugs. The drugs with the highest percentage of recorded indications were acetylcysteine (n = 15), oxycodone (n = 14) and zopiclone (n = 11), where 100, 93 and 90% had a listed indication, respectively. Conclusion: A high percentage of nursing home patients' diagnoses seem to be untreated. However, most drugs that patients received were listed with indication for use in the drug charts. To increase quality of drug prescribing, one should put emphasis on improving the recorded information in electronical health records.",

In multiple researches patient adherence is determined to be as low as 50%. Therefore it is important to identify the reasons of patients not following their drug regimen. Objective. To analyse the patient comprehension of their drug regimen depending on the duration of hypertension and received treatment. Setting and method: During the period from December 2015 to March 2016 a quantitative survey was conducted to include respondents who have been diagnosed with arterial hypertension and whose regimen includes at least one fixed dose combination drug. Main outcome measures: In an anonymous survey data was collected about their demographic information, co-morbidity, other prescribed medication, intake regime, the average blood pressure during treatment, and patient's assessment of the prescribed therapy. Collected data was analysed with SPSS. Results: The study included 103 participants, most of whom (64.1%) were women. Participants average age was 62.5 \u00b1 12.5 years and the median arterial hypertension duration was 8 (5; 16) years. The study participants, who sometimes consciously adjusted dosing regimen, observed arterial hypertension for a longer period of time compared to the group, which follows the prescribed regimen according to their doctor's recommendation, respectively, 10 (6; 28) vs. 8 (4; 15); p = 0.110. Group of respondents (n = 16) receiving C3 prescription drugs, more often deliberately adjusted treatment regimen compared to respondents (n = 8) treated with B2 prescription drugs, respectively 26.7 versus 18.6%; p = 0.310. Respondents who deliberately adjusted drug were more often not satisfied with the number of longterm daily use of tablets (n = 13) compared to the group (n = 11), which had to intake fewer tablets every day, respectively, 54.2 versus 45.8%; p = 0.005. Conclusion: Arterial hypertension duration was associated with more frequent conscious adjustment of therapy without consulting a doctor. More individual prescriptions (C3) and an increase in the number of tablets per day at the same time also increases the risk of patients deliberately changing their dosing regimen. Long-term drug users should receive additional attention during pharmaceutical care process to their respective treatment schedule in order to promote proper use of medication.

Better adherence to the treatment could potentially reduce complications, decrease morbidity and mortality, and have a beneficial economic impact due to fewer consultations and hospitalizations. Setting and method: A one-year program was started in 370 Belgian pharmacies to accompany diabetes patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors and encourage them to be compliant with their treatment. This study concerns 270 of these pharmacies, all part of the same cooperative group. All pharmacists received prior training in motivational techniques and reviewed the bases of diabetes therapy with an e-learning program. Materials developed for the patients included brochures on diabetes and its treatment, nutritional advice, physical exercise, foot care and tips and tricks for diabetics. Main outcome measures: The impact on pharmacological adherence was measured using mMPR and PDC. Two control groups were included: a historical control group and a group of patients that were not included in the project. Non-pharmacological adherence was assessed using questionnaires. Results: In the subgroup of 270 pharmacies, 495 patients were included in the program. By the end of April 2016, only 44 of them had completed the program; 78 patients came only once to the pharmacy. They either stopped their treatment after one prescription, or were occasional clients. Adherence rates were found to be high in all groups (5.7-9.1% of patients with mMPR B 80%). Only for the PDC, a statistically significant difference was measured between the intervention and control group (135.37 vs. 129.22%; P = 0.015). No other statistically significant impact was measured (neither pharmacological, nor non-pharmacological). Conclusion: Adherence was very high in all groups. The underlying reasons still need to be investigated (choice of adherence measure, healthy user effect, etc.). However, both patients and pharmacists were very pleased with this type of program. This new role of the pharmacist will definitely be more developed in the future.

However OACs have also side effects such as bleeding, especially when used inappropriately. Pharmaceutical care interventions aim to optimize medicines use and improve patient health outcomes. The literature lacks a review on the impact of Pharmaceutical Care interventions in patients using OAC. Therefore, we systematically assessed the impact of Pharmaceutical Care interventions on the effective and safe use of OAC compared to usual care. Setting and method: A systematic review was performed in PubMed and Embase with synonyms/detailed specifications of the terms oral Int J Clin Pharm (2017) . It was motivate for the need to sort the instruments for URM, including professional participation, and on the basis of the clinical management unit, and reduce variability in decisions.

Setting and method: Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were performed in 28 patients with a (history of) liver cirrhosis. The patients were approached through an item in the newsletter of de Dutch Association of Liver Patients. Topics in the interview guide were preferences about information about medication, side effects, safety, drug dosage, and how patients preferred to receive this information. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Interviews were analysed using thematic content analysis. Main outcome measures: The experiences and needs of patients with liver cirrhosis concerning information about medication. Results: Patients indicated they had received sufficient information about the indication, possible drug-drug interactions and the duration of treatment. They preferred (more) information about how medications work, what adverse drug reactions could be expected and practical aspects concerning intake of medication. Informational needs were related to questions 'how to act': patients with more informational needs took a more active role in responsibility for their own medication management. Patients needed information to know what to do, e.g. in case of adverse drug reactions or when a dosage was forgotten. The doctor and internet were the preferred sources of information: doctors because of the personal contact and internet because of the accessibility. Facilitating factors were 'taking time' in healthcare provider-patient contact and 'everyday language' for texts on the internet and in package leaflets. A combination of verbal information by the healthcare professional and written information was preferred. Conclusion: Patients with liver cirrhosis need information about medication to take an active role in their drug management.

It induces cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 and moderately inhibits CYP3A4. Drug-drug interaction could occur with intravenous anticancer or antiemetic drugs metabolised by these isoenzymes. It may lead to adverse effects or loss in efficacy. Regarding recent international antiemetic guidelines, emergence of new intravenous chemotherapy and lack of bibliographic data, a report on aprepitant interactions is performed in oncology. The aim of this study is to review pharmacokinetic interactions with aprepitant in order to prevent potential toxic effects of intravenous anticancer or antiemetic agents and provide the best patient care. Design: Anticancer and antiemetic agents metabolised by CYP3A4 and 2C9 were identified. Pharmacokinetic literature review was performed using Medline \u00d2 database and laboratory data. Clinical assessment and non-aprepitant pharmacokinetic studies were excluded. A table was established to summarize data. Results: Ten intravenous anticancer agents used in oncology are identified as CYP3A4 substrates. Pharmacokinetic assessments are achieved for docetaxel, cyclophosphamide, vinorelbine, irinotecan and trabectedin. Studies dealing with the five other drugs are strictly clinical assessments. Among the different pharmacokinetic studies, only trabectedin showed relevant interaction with aprepitant. In this association, aprepitant dose needs to be adjusted. CYP2C9 catalyses the cyclophosphamide activation pathway with minor contribution. However, it would have few repercussions on cyclophosphamide pharmacokinetic. Corticosteroids and 5 hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5HT-3) receptor antagonists are also metabolised by CYP3A4. Aprepitant significantly increases corticosteroid plasma concentrations. In this case, corticosteroid dose adjustment should be applied. Furthermore, no interaction has been found with 5HT-3 receptor antagonist. Conclusion: Regardless of the emetogenic level of anticancer agents, all drugs have been studied because of theirs potential combinations. Two relevant pharmacokinetic interactions have been demonstrated leading to dose adjustment recommendation. Corticosteroids doses, in association with aprepitant, should be reduced one-fourth for intravenous form and one half for oral form. Aprepitant first dose should be decreased to 80 mg when it is co-administrated with trabectedin. These two results lead us to re-evaluate our prescription practices. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: NSAIDs are associated with serious adverse reactions which in turn are responsible for significant risks of morbidity and mortality. The aims of this project is to identify risks involved in NSAID administration including over-usage and significant drug interactions, and to analyse occurrence of side-effects. The trends of NSAID prescribing by physicians and pharmacists are also determined. Setting and method: A pharmacy from each electoral district was chosen by stratified sampling. A sample population (N = 100) was obtained from 13 pharmacies in Malta. Data was collected through the completion of questionnaires carried out by the patients. The trends of NSAID prescribing were determined by another questionnaire directed to 49 pharmacists and physicians that was available online. Main outcome measures: Use of NSAIDs by patients and prescribing trends. Results: Back pain (n = 19), muscular pain (n = 13), headache (n = 12) and arthritic pain (n = 10) accounted for the most frequent use of NSAIDs. Diclofenac accounted for the most commonly administered NSAID, taken by 58 of the patients, of which 48 use the 50 mg dose. Chronic disorders of symptoms experienced by the patients included hypertension (n = 24), heartburn (n = 22), dyspepsia (n = 21), asthma (n = 4) and a history of Helicobacter pylori infection (n = 2). Other disorders suffered by single individuals include epilepsy, Crohn's disease and renal dysfunction.",

Please specify your abstract type: Descriptive abstract (for projects) Background and objective: Clinical pharmacy and clinical pharmacology have many similar aspects. Both areas present professionals who have groundings in drug therapy principles and who aim to optimize the efficacy and safety of therapies for patient's benefits. However, there are clear distinctions. Clinical pharmacologists are in general doctors with an additional education in clinical pharmacology. Many of these are prescribers of drugs in practice but are in usual connected to academic parts responsible for education and research. They belong to a well-recognized but small sub-specialty of medicine. In contrast, clinical pharmacists are part of a much greater group of professionals working in most hospitals in developed countries. While the former one is restricted and subordinate to distributing the drugs requested by the medical prescribers, the role of the pharmacist has increasingly developed to encircle monitoring outcomes of medicine treatment and report management, patient safety and budgetary responsibilities. Pharmacists are currently capable to take on prescribing responsibilities in developed countries and have been actively involved in collaboration in practice of prescribing with doctors. They also take on a great part in education related to rational prescribing that was once thought the area of the clinical pharmacologist. Given the difference in size of the two areas there is understandably increasing confusion in the minds of managers in health services as to the continuing role and identity of clinical pharmacology. This may illuminate, in part, the diminishing in numbers and visibility of clinical pharmacologists in certain countries. In fact, some might see the continuous development of clinical pharmacy as a direct danger to the viability and future existence of the specialty of clinical pharmacology. However, clinical pharmacy and clinical pharmacology working synergistically would serve for the well-being of the public. Design: . Results: . Conclusion: .",

It was distributed to patients through either a pharmacist during patients stay at the hospital, or the French Association des Malades Souffrant d'Angioed\u00e8mes (AMSAO). Answers were collected by electronic or conventional mail. Results: 39 patients completed the questionnaire. The average patients age is 25.8 \u00b1 27.2 years. All of those interviewed could name their disease. For 23% of patients, the crisis happened unpredictably but in most cases a triggering factor was described, such as stress (21%), fatigue (18%) or an emotional shock (17%). Oedema were located mainly in extremities (31%), abdomen (19%), ENT sphere (12%) or face (11%). 17 patients (43%) reported having more than 12 crisis each year (eligible to prophylaxis), among them, 5 patients (13%) said they had no preventive treatment. All patients knew the difference between prophylactic and curative treatment of crisis. Among the 38 patients receiving treatment for crisis, 16 were able to define which treatment to be used depending on the intensity and location of the crisis. The majority of patients used Icatibant during a crisis, but the most frequently cited prophylaxis treatments were Tranexamic acid (38%) and Danazol (35%). For injectable drugs to treat acute episodes, Icatibant (subcutaneous) and C1 esterase inhibitor (intravenous) were self-administrated respectively in 79 and 8% of patients. Conclusion: This study showed that patients generally knew their disease and its treatment. However, they are insufficiently informed on drugs to be used according to the clinical situation and especially intravenous self-administration. Therefore, it seems necessary to increase pharmacist involvement in patient's information about therapeutic strategy and drugs routes of administration.

One hundred and forty-three answers were collected: 38 officinal pharmacists and 105 nurses. Ninety-seven percent of AHP have judged relevant the following stated security goals: the name of the drug, its use, its risks and to be able to inform all AHP. ''Associated pathologies and treatments,'' ''the last coagulation test'' and ''potential factors for non-adherence'' seem necessary for the binding document. More than 90% of participants found that this action will facilitate the establishment of pharmaceutical anticoagulant educations in cities, the dialogue around the OA with the doctor, patient's compliance and will secure the treatment. Conclusion: HPE certainly help patients. Its implementation for patients with OA in our hospital has generated a real interest. The addition of an ambulatory link allows continuing at best their support. The questionnaire has also allowed us to know the opinions of AHP involved and some improvements to the binding document may have been done. Participants were asked to associate the task to the profession by determining whether each profession had the main responsibility for undertaking the task, a supportive responsibility, or whether they should not be involved at all. Data was analysed using SPSS \u00d2, version 22. The Chi squared test was used to assess any significant association between categorical variables. Main outcome measures: Perception of the oncology pharmacist's role by healthcare professionals. Results: From a total of 84 completed questionnaires, it was found that for tasks listed as ''Patient Education and Counselling'', 18% were considered as the pharmacists' main responsibility, whereas 42% were believed to be supportive roles. Main tasks included educating the patient regarding which medication to avoid during their treatment. For tasks listed as ''Drug Related Problems'', 20 and 45% of tasks were found to include pharmacists as having main and supportive roles respectively. Supportive tasks included dose calculation of anti-tumour therapy required per patient. In the ''Authorisation of Medication'' category pharmacists' main roles carried a total of 13% and supportive that of 50% of the total number of tasks. This included ordering anti-tumour medication. Further analysis of data revealed that years of experience did not have a significant association with results obtained (p-value = 0.074); however physicians, pharmacists and allied healthcare professionals were found to involve the pharmacist most extensively (pvalue = 0.000). Conclusion: Tasks associated with the pharmacist were representative of the current role they possess within the oncology setting; however this association was limited to professionals having a close working relationship with pharmacists. This may be due to the lack of an established multidisciplinary team approach within this scenario thus limiting the perception of the oncology pharmacist's contribution. An implemented multidisciplinary team may improve communication between the professionals involved and optimises patient care. The aim of the study is to analyse from a qualitative and quantitative point of view the pharmacy resident's activity in pneumology service. Setting and method: The study included all the daily prescriptions of three units of pneumology from January to April 2016. PI and data were extracted from the software Pharma \u00d2 and collected in a summary Excel \u00d2 table: nature of potential errors, nature of the proposals offered by residents, way of transmitting PI, and rate of PIs' acceptance.

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the principal types of IBD and involve severe diarrhoea, pain, fatigue and weight loss. IBD affects young adult with an increasing annual incidence (2.5 million concerned people in Europe). Patients with IBD are affected by somatic or psychosocial problems and patient education may contribute to their well-being. Since September 2010, individual educational sessions have been set up and since September 2015, collective educational sessions. These sessions have been developed to improve patient's understanding of treatment options and medical adherence. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that a therapeutic education program (TEP) could have a significant effect on IBD patient's skills with regards to their disease. Design: After individual education sessions with a nurse, a group education session was introduced for outpatients with IBD. The collective session include approximately six to ten patients and is organized in a half day workshops (about disease and treatment) conducted by a multidisciplinary team. The workshops were performed by an education nurse, two hospital gastroenterologists, two hospital pharmacists and a community pharmacist. These sessions were wrapped up by a short satisfaction and knowledge questionnaires. Results: In total, 141 IBD outpatients participated to the educational program, 112 patients with Crohn's disease and 29 patients with ulcerative colitis (52.5% male; median age: 39). For the individual educational sessions, two competence questionnaires were performed about anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) therapy: one about general knowledge, another one about self-administration subcutaneous injection. 43 patients completed these questionnaires. For the collective educational session, the competence questionnaire developed consisting of six questions covering few items: disease, symptoms, treatment and complications. 14 patients completed this questionnaire. After the questionnaire, each participant received a summary document about drugs, side effects, therapeutic and medical advice. Conclusion: The patient education program contributes to the improvement of self-management skills when it comes to IBD. Pharmacists joining medical specialists and nurses provided pharmaceutical care with a positive impact on compliance, which is a determining factor for the success of the treatment and the quality of life in patients living with an IBD. This program will be continued and a new program for teenagers is to be established as well.",

Unintentional discrepancies were reviewed and corrected by doctors. At the discharge, medication changes were sent to general practitioner and community pharmacies. A satisfaction survey about this process was sent to 39 healthcare professionals (GP, pharmacist and nurses). A medication reconciliation's workshop was organized for a hundred healthcare professionals in the area. Main outcome measures: At the point of admission, the conciliation record included the list of patient's home medication, admission medical orders, and the types of discrepancies.

Please specify your abstract type: Descriptive abstract (for projects) Background and objective: The sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic, chronic disease, paroxystic in its unpredictable and polymorphic acute events. This most frequent genetic illness in the world is a major public health concern in French overseas territories. Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9 (HAS) recommendations for the care of SCD advocate the development of therapeutic patient education (TPE). In Martinique (French West Indies), we consider the population of patients with SCD in 1500 among which 1000 are followed in the Adults Sickle Cell Centre (ASCC). One of the actions carried out by the ASCC of our hospital is the TPE. The objective is to set up an original (because specific in the SCD) TPE method, which enables the patient to live better with his disease on a daily basis, by teaching him and his family to recognize prematurely certain complications. Design: We analysed needs from the outcomes of a national French survey has which one participated Martinique and retained the following themes: the red blood cell, the genetic transmission, the main symptoms, the role of the water, the medicinal treatments and the questions of everyday life. We chose the innovative educational tools called the ''Malles des Savoirs \u00d2 **'', a set of unusual experiments, accessories and models, which, by using a method of active pedagogy ''OMCA*: Observer, Manipuler, Comprendre, Agir ***'', value the learner by offering to him to manipulate and to experiment by himself. Results: In 2016, 24 healthcare professionals (doctors, pharmacists, nurses) and a president of patients with SCD Association followed one week of formation in the OMCA* method for the animation of six workshops for 10-15 teenagers and adults. Every ''Malle des Savoirs \u00d2 **'' contains the necessary material for the animation and a Guide of the organizer, including, for every tackled issue, a generic introduction, a presentation of the themes, the index cards of educational animations proposing the activities and one time of synthesis grouping the approaches concepts. The interactive manipulation allows the appropriation of the discoveries become then long-lasting experiences. A final evaluation allows to spot the problems met by learners to understand, to analyse the difficulties and to proceed to the useful adaptations during the next activity. Conclusion: This tool, playful and perfectly adapted to the SCD, engages, accompanies and helps patients in the construction of their own knowledges to return them actors of their disease. In 2017, we shall estimate the impact of the development of this specific TPE programme of the patient with SCD. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: To investigate the frequencies and clinical relevance of unintentional medication discrepancies, between preadmission medication lists and discharge medication lists, at discharge from hospital. A discrepancy is considered unintentional if there is no documentation explaining the intent of the medication change or if it is unintentional according to the prescribing physician. Setting and method: Systematic literature review. Main outcome measures: Frequency of unintentional medication discrepancies per patient and per medication; frequency of clinically relevant medication discrepancies. Results: Of the patients included 14-88% experienced at least one unintentional medication discrepancy. Of the medications used by the patients, 3-50% were involved in unintentional medication discrepancies. Of unintentional medication discrepancies found in five studies, 15-58% were clinically relevant. Conclusion: The review documented a high frequency of medication discrepancies, of which many were clinically relevant. Ensuring sufficient communication of correct and complete medication information in transitions of care is a process which should be better implemented, to enhance patient safety. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: To investigate the frequency of medication changes not documented in the discharge letter, at discharge from hospital, for both regular, as needed and over-the-counter medications, supplements and herbal remedies (OTC). Secondary, differences between variables and patients with undocumented medication changes were investigated. Setting and method: The patients included were all part of the intervention groups from an intervention study, conducted by one of the authors (TG), from April 2013 to December 2014. The best possible discharge medication list was compared against the medication list in the discharge letter and any discrepancy between the two lists was noted, taking into account the text in the discharge summary. Main outcome measures: The proportion of patients affected by at least one undocumented medication change at discharge and proportion of medications with undocumented changes. The proportion of patients was compared using a test according to gender, age, number of preadmission/discharge medications and length of hospital stay. Results: Two hundred patients were included in the study. The proportion of patients experiencing at least one undocumented medication change for the three subgroups: regular medications; as needed; OTC, were 78, 65 and 55% respectively. The proportion of medications involved in undocumented changes for the three subgroups were 34, 71 and 77% respectively. The proportion of patients experiencing undocumented medication changes was significantly higher in patients with more than five regular medications at admission, (p \\ 0.001) and at discharge (p \\ 0.001). In both regular and as needed medications, the proportion of patients experiencing undocumented medication changes was higher in patients hospitalized longer than 2 days (p \\ 0.001 and p: \\ 0.05 respectively). For OTC, the rate of patients experiencing undocumented medication changes, was higher in females (p: \\ 0.05). Conclusion: A high proportion of patients are affected by at least one undocumented medication change and many medications are involved in undocumented changes. Correct and complete medication information at admission and discharge may resolve many of these errors, ensuring patent safety at transitions of care.",

Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: The Narrative-Based Medicine was intended primarily for health care professionals, and the use of narratives can be applied in any settings to better understand the meaning of own profession, to rediscover/strengthen the motivation to work as a team. The Italian Society of Hospital Pharmacist (SIFO) promotes a qualitative study aimed at getting the real picture of pharmacist's role within the National Health System (NHS), the interaction with other health professionals and patients through the narratives of under specialization pharmacists (UI) and pharmacists already working in the NHS (HP). These data can be further investigated to increase the perceived value/role of the pharmacist. Setting and method: SIFO HPs and UIs joining the National Pharmacy School Specialization Network were invited to participate. All pharmacists participating to the study were given a semi-structure interview. The methodology was developed within the conceptual framework of the Grounded Theory (GT) a research methodology that arises in the context of qualitative research. GT is a systematic methodology involving the construction of theory grounded in data systematically gathered and analysed. Main outcome measures: Analysis of Narratives. Narratives were analysed according to the classifications of Kleinman, Frank and Launer and Robinson together with Transitional Analysis (TA). Results: A total number of 31 narratives were collected (16 UPs and 15 HPs). Narratives from both group of participants show the need of strengthening the professional identity already in the early years of the pharmacy curriculum and more effectively during the years of specialization as well as the need of being educated to deliver patientcentred care as members of an interdisciplinary team. Conclusion: This is the first step of a study that also includes patient's contribution to the definition of pharmacist's professional identity.",

Objective: to quantify patients' information need and satisfaction on cancer drug therapy and how this can be improved by clinical pharmacist's counselling. Additionally, the pharmacist's impact on therapy quality and costs is assessed. Setting and method: Setting: prospective, randomised study in the ambulatory (26 beds) and in-hospital onco-/haematology unit (34 beds) in a tertiary hospital. Inclusion criteria: adult patients on intravenous or oral cancer therapy, with informed consent. Methods: All patients were asked to complete standardised surveys (Extent of Information Desired, EID; Patient Satisfaction with Cancer Treatment Education, PS-CaTE and Cancer Satisfaction of Treatment Questionnaire, CTSQ) on three occasions (at the start of a new therapy, during the second cycle and after 3 months). Patients in the intervention group received additional counselling by a clinical pharmacist including medication reconciliation and review. Control patients received standard of care (information on drug therapy was provided by the onco-/haematologist, followed by limited administration instructions by nursing staff). Main outcome measures: patient information desire and satisfaction on cancer treatment Results: 83 patients were included over a period of 6 months (control (n = 43); intervention (n = 40)). No significant differences were found between contact moments or patient groups for EID, PS-CaTE and CTSQ-scores. However, scores for PS-CaTE on medication side effects were positively correlated with contact moment (r s = 0.198; P = 0.022). Multiple linear regression analysis showed a similar trend (B = 0.207; P = 0.101). Patients receiving first-line therapy (B = 0.270; P \\ 0.001) and ambulatory patients (B = 0.027; P = 0.018) were more satisfied on treatment education. The clinical pharmacist documented more drugs than were recorded in the patient file (8 vs. 4.9 drugs/patient; P \\ 0.001). On average, each patient required two pharmacist's interventions per occasion. Intervention acceptance rate on drug related problems was high (72%). During the study, interventions shifted from therapy adjustments towards advice on supportive measures (1st contact: 12%; 3rd contact: 41%). Improved medication stock control on the ward led to a savings of \u20ac36,890. Conclusion: The clinical pharmacist can play an important role on the onco-/haematological ward, leading to improved drug reconciliation, patient counselling and cost savings. Hospitalised patients and patients receiving salvage therapy appear to have higher educational needs, making them possibly overlooked target groups. Finally, pharmaceutical counselling should be repeated and primarily focused on side-effect management to have a meaningful impact on patient satisfaction. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Europe is ahead of the USA and Canada on approval, regulatory and marketing aspects of biosimilars. However, there is still uncertainty about interchangeability and substitution of biosimilars. The aim of the study is to assess pharmacists' perceptions about biosimilar interchangeability. Setting and method: A cross-sectional study was carried out in June-July 2016. Hospital pharmacists from Quebec and France were invited to respond to an online survey of nine questions (Surveymonkey \u00d2 , Palo Alto, CA, USA). The survey focuses on pharmacist's exposition to biosimilars (general knowledge, dispensing) and their perceptions about biosimilar interchangeability. A 5-item Likert scale was used to answer to 15 statements based on key issues about biosimilar interchangeability. Main outcome measures: Levels of agreement on biosimilar interchangeability key issues. Results: A total of 229 pharmacists responded (62% in Quebec vs. 38% in France). The global response rate is: 27% (23% Quebec vs. 34% France) (N = 229/880). 64% attended at least to one conference on biosimilars (57 vs. 74%). 36% had already dispensed biosimilars (7 vs. 81%). More than 95% of the pharmacists knew that: biosimilars can cause immunogenicity, clinical studies are requested for their approval, automatic substitution is not permitted. 43% considered that post-marketing surveillance for biosimilars should be reinforced. Pharmacists considered that biosimilars are cheaper than the reference product (89 vs. 75%). There was no difference between the level of agreement of French and Quebec pharmacists for the 15 statements. Pharmacists agree that a list of biosimilar and interchangeable biologic products is necessary (85 vs. 77%), using the international nonproprietary name to prescribe a biological product can create confusion between the reference product and its biosimilar (60 vs. 55%), pharmacists should check if patients already experienced an immunogenic reaction before dispensing a biological product (82 vs. 70%). Pharmacists disagree that a biosimilar can be used for all the indications of the reference product (53 vs. 46%). Conclusion: Perceptions of Quebec and French hospital pharmacists about biosimilar interchangeability issues are very similar. This study highlights the need to deal with the lack of clarity of national guidances. Clinical studies on biosimilar interchangeability must be conducted in the future to help pharmacists and physicians to take clear-headed decisions. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Analgesics are essential drugs in hospitals and especially in emergency units. Medical and nurse staffs are used to the narcotic status of opioids. For some drugs, a regulatory change to narcotic status can discourage their use. For others, it could limit their access particularly in developing countries; that's why WHO did not recommend ketamine to be placed under international control (http://www.who.int/medicines/access/controlled-substances/ recommends_against_ick/en/). Yet, the French Drug Agency has recently considered to register drugs containing ketamine as narcotics. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of this possible regulatory change on the pharmaceutical and medical practices in some paediatric French hospitals. Setting and method: The survey was conducted in January-February 2016 in four Parisian paediatric hospitals: four pharmacies, Paediatric Neurology and Anaesthesia departments, Intensive Care Units and Pain Management Services. Main outcome measures: Pharmacists, clinicians, health managers and nurses were interviewed, using a standardized questionnaire with closed and opened questions, on the drug circuit including ordering, storage, distribution, prescription, administration and destruction. Results: All the 20 health professionals (five pharmacists, ten clinicians, five nurses) indicate that the change to narcotic status would not preclude the use of an analgesic drug. They consider that the pharmaceutical aspects (dispensation, storage and transport, etc.) are not limiting, provided that clinical usefulness is demonstrated: short action onset allowing rapid efficacy, short duration of action allowing the replacement by another drugs if needed, and moderate clinical monitoring. Change to narcotic status was rather seen as advantageous since allowing better traceability, use and prescription.",

Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Polytherapy, frequently used in the elderly, is associated to an increased risk of potential drug-drug interactions (pDDIs) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Literature demonstrated that medication reconciliation and medication review performed by hospital pharmacists are correlated to drug related problems (DRPs). Aim: to define a structured and feasible model where hospital pharmacists support clinicians identifying DRPs and promote the safe use of medicines. Setting and method: Prospective, feasibility study conducted in four internal medicine wards of a hospital in Northern Italy. Inpatients (C65 years old, treated with C5 drugs) were consecutively included; the recognition/reconciliation process was performed by pharmacists in order to identify changes between prescription profile at home and during the admission (active principles, dose, administration route). These changes were classified as intentional documented discrepancies (ID), not documented (IND), not intentional (NI). Prescriptions during the first 24-hours of hospitalisation were analysed to retrieve DRPs (DDIs, inappropriate medications for elderly, off-label, over/ under dosage, duplications, ADRs) then discussed with clinicians. Based on literature, referring almost 1 DRP in 70% of patients, a sample size of 50 patients should allow an estimate of DRP rate over 50% (need of intervention) with a 80% power and a confidence interval of 95% (software STATA version 12.0). Main outcome measures: Rate and type of: discrepancies, DRPs at admission and discharge, pharmacists consultations accepted by clinicians. Results: Ad interim results are presented. Between October/2015-February/2016, 30 inpatients (16 male, 85.4 mean age) were included. Overall, patients were admitted with 257 drugs used at home and 240 prescribed during the first 24-hours; pharmacists retrieved 99 discrepancies (45%ID, 52%IND, 3%NI) and 118 DRPs, of which 57% DDIs, 1% off-label, 3% overdoses, 3% duplications, 30% inappropriate drugs, 6% not notified ADRs. The 70% of DRPs was known to clinicians and 52% considered clinically relevant for the patients.

Setting and method: A cross sectional survey consisting of selfreported questionnaires including Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ), Perceived Sensitivity to Medication (PSM) and Quality of Life was undertaken in an unselected patients attending a Hypertension Centre of Excellence out-patient clinic based in London. Main outcome measures: To determine factors associated with MI-HTN and the impact of health beliefs and self-reported perceived sensitivity to medications on MI-HTN and BP control. Chi squared tests for comparisons between cases/controls and multiple logistic regression analysis were used for statistical analysis. Results: 102 participants were included, of which 46 (45%) participants had MI-HTN. Two-thirds were female (p = 0.002) with a mean age of 70 \u00b1 10 years (p 0.001), of whom 67.4% had uncontrolled hypertension (p = 0.063). Calcium channel blockers were the most commonly reported intolerance by drug class followed by diuretics. Being female and age [60 were statistically associated with a greater likelihood of reporting medicines intolerance (p \\ 0.05). Patients who believed that medicines are harmful were [5-times more likely to report MI-HTN (p = 0.009) and 4-times more likely to have uncontrolled BP ([140/90 mmHg) (p = 0.024). Patients with high self-perceived sensitivity to medication was 4-times more prone to MI-HTN (p = 0.007). Conclusion: Our findings suggests the need for greater focus on behavioural change interventions to both improve patients' perception of the necessity to persist with lifelong antihypertensive medication and allay concerns regarding harmful effects of drugs may help with long term control of hypertension. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Today, the number of medical problems in heart transplant recipients has increased due to aging and complications common to immunosuppressive drugs. The co-existence or emergence of other disease states such as renal dysfunction, infection, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, malignancies, and osteoporosis necessitates the use of other medications. The use of these medications in combination with immunosuppressive agents increases the risk of drug-drug interactions. The aim of this study is to identify the frequency and significance of drug-drug interactions for the patients who received cardiac transplantation. Setting and method: This retrospective study was conducted at a cardiovascular specialty hospital. All patients who received cardiac transplantation from the same surgery team between 2009 and 2014 (6 years) were included in the study. All data were collected from the medical records of the patients. Only the most recent prescription before discharge was analysed for the presence and significance of drug-drug interactions. Drug-drug interactions were checked using Micromedex(R) Interaction Checker. Main outcome measures: Main outcome measures were the frequency and significance of drug-drug interactions. Results: A total of 58 patients met the inclusion criteria and 58 prescriptions were analysed. Each prescription contained an average of 11 drugs. A total of 529 drug-drug interactions were identified: 51.8% was classified as moderate; 43.4% as major and 3.7% as contraindicated. Almost half of all interactions (n = 271) included immunosuppressive agents (59.4% was classified as moderate; 35.4% as major and 4.8% as contraindicated). Conclusion: Cardiac transplant recipients were found to have a high number of drug-drug interactions. In order to advise on these interactions which increase with poly-pharmacy, drugs with narrow therapeutic index or drugs that require intensive monitoring, it is recommended to include a transplantation pharmacist in the transplantation team.

Some demographic, haematological and pharmacological variables may affect Hb variability. But there are some controversies about the influences of different erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA).The objective of this study is to determine the influence of different ESA on haemoglobin variability in pre-dialysis patients. Setting and method: We conducted a prospective observational study with chronic kidney disease patients recruited from outpatients of Nephrology Department of a Tertiary University Hospital (from January 2011 to June 2012). Exclusion criteria were: stage I and II, not treated with ESA, haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, renal transplantation, thalassemia, and deficit of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase . Main outcome measures: Patients included were treated with ESA in maintenance phase (stable 6 months prior).Hb variability was calculated by standard deviation (SD) and residual standard deviation (residual SD) of Hb levels. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 15.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago). Observation period was 18 months and data were recorded from the clinical records.

Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Fragile patients are considered those vulnerable patients with a certain degree of complexity in their care (polypharmacy, multi-pathological, palliative and/or residents in social and healthcare institutions). To ensure their continuity of care and safety in the use of drugs we applied a medication reconciliation process at admission, transition of care and/or hospital discharge. Objective: To analyse the results of the medication reconciliation process of a fragile patient. Setting and method: We developed a list of current medication with the following sources of information: medical history, clinical databases and information provided by the patient (interview). Clinical case: 95-year-old woman admitted through emergency department due to severe dyspnoea. No known drug allergy. Background: heart failure, chronic hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hyperthyroidism, hyperuricemia, gouty arthritis, chronic kidney disease and cognitive impairment by Alzheimer disease. Exploration and complementary tests: echocardiogram and analytical control. Clinical judgment: Acute decompensated heart failure. Acute myocardial infarction. Prerenal acute kidney injury. Main outcome measures: Medication reconciliation made at admission with the detection of discrepancies and deprescribing criteria at hospital discharge. Results: Fragile patient (high-risk) with 13 medicines as home treatment. Patient was hemodynamically stable during the hospital stay. 9 discrepancies were detected between the prescribed medication and the home treatment. Discrepancies justified (7): five by omission of medication (two new clinical situation, two therapeutic exchanges to adapt to the pharmacotherapy guide and one wrong drug) and two beginning of medication. Discrepancies unjustified (2): by omission of medication. To Discharge: One antiplatelet therapy was. After the comprehensive review, we made the following recommendations of deprescription: suspend one non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-NSAID (by risk of bleeding in association with concomitant antiplatelet and antidepressant therapy) and one benzodiazepine (Central Nervous System-CNS side effects); Modify treatment: reduce doses of diuretics (blood pressure lowering effect). Pharmacotherapeutic recommendations were accepted. Conclusion: Detection of discrepancies in the medication reconciliation and deprescription process are effective and safe strategies that allow optimization of pharmacotherapy in fragile patients. The use of drugs such as NSAIDs (gastrolesive effect), the combination of drugs with CNS side effects and hypotensive action (associated with falls) in elderly patients constitute situations of risk that should be reviewed in fragile patients, as an essential part of the clinical evaluation. Please specify your abstract type: Descriptive abstract (for projects) Background and objective: There are no positions for clinical pharmacists at the hospital, so we are dependent on projects to be able to show how pharmacists can contribute in the clinical team. Our aim in this project was to introduce pharmaceutical knowledge by implementing medication reconciliation and medication review in different hospital wards. We wanted to show that many patients have discrepancies in their medication lists during hospital stay and that some of the drugs or doses given can cause drug related problems for the patient. Our final goal was to get the physicians to be more aware of these issues when treating their patients. Design: The method used was based on the two first parts of the Integrated Medicines Management. The pharmacist conducted a standardized drug interview with patients who prior to admission were responsible for their own drugs. For patients who could not be interviewed or were not responsible for administering their own drugs, a current medication list from relevant care level was obtained. The medication lists obtained were compared to the documentation in the patient's drug chart and discrepancies communicated to the physician. During the hospital stay, a medication review and monitoring was also conducted by the pharmacist. Results were presented to the patients physician and discussed. Results: A total of 129 patients were included and of these 63% had C1 discrepancy identified by the process. The most frequent type of discrepancy was the use of a drug that was not registered on admission (omission discrepancies). Other discrepancies were wrong dose, dosage or formulation and registration of a drug the patient didn't use. Drug-related problems were discovered in 61% of the patients and the most frequent were use of anticholinergic drugs in elderly, interactions, lack of treatment and monitoring and too high doses regarding kidney function. Many of the detected drug related problems results in change in medication, other times the physician addresses the problem to the GP. The physicians were surprised of the high numbers of discrepancies in medication lists and drug related problems discovered. Almost all the physicians considered that the pharmacist could be an important part of the treatment team and they wanted the participation of the pharmacist to be permanent. Conclusion: The project led to increased awareness of the importance of medication reconciliation and medication review and showed the importance of pharmaceutical knowledge in the treatment team. Unfortunately this was not sufficient to create positions for pharmacists in our hospital. New projects will focus on pharmacists teaching interns to improve the reconciliation at admission. Please specify your abstract type: Descriptive abstract (for projects) Background and objective: We aimed to assess the quality of fluoroquinolones (FQ) prescriptions at the Toulouse University Hospital emergency department as part of significant increase in consumption. Design: Retrospective mono-centric study of FQ prescriptions written to adult patients managed at the emergency department (February 29th, 2016 -March 6th, 2016 . A pair consisting of a biologist pharmacist and a clinical pharmacist has analysed them using tools provided by the Centre de Coordination de Lutte Contre les Infections Nosocomiales (CCLIN). Various criteria (pertinence of prescription, choice of antibiotic, dosage, duration of treatment, method of administration\u2026) were faced with the guidelines issued by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Pathologie Infectieuse de Langue Fran\u00e7aise (SPILF). Results: About 1229 files were examined, 17 contained FQ prescriptions for systemic use. The most frequently prescribed antibiotic was Ofloxacin (59%) and the most frequent indications were urinary tract infections (47%). Among the 17 prescriptions of FQ, the establishment of FQ was justified in 71% of cases and the antibiotic chosen was always the most suitable. Nonconformities of dosage and/ or treatment time were found in a quarter of cases. Overall, 47% did comply with guidelines. The prescriptions, due to the particularity of emergency were still permormed probabilistic. However, a reassessment of them was scheduled for two-third of outpatients. Conclusion: This study highlights the conformity of less than half of the prescriptions. This demonstrates that there are still actions to ensure the accuracy of FQ prescriptions.

However, aging and comorbidities are becoming a major problem in this group of patients. Most HIV-infected patients are treated with five or more medications, and harms by polypharmacy increase proportionally with number of medications. Possible risks include: poor medication adherence and consequently inefficient care, increased risk of drug interactions and adverse events, with prolonged hospitalization. The problem is worsened when patients are of nonnative language and so their comprehension and adherence to drug therapy can be very poor, compromising efficacy. The HIVIG Study is designed to evaluate the impact of the interventions promoted by the clinical pharmacist in the optimization and comprehension to personal drug therapy, favouring compliance, in a cohort of patients, HIV infected with comorbidities like cancer; the cohort includes a high number of non-native Italian language individuals. Design: HIVIG is a randomised, parallel groups clinical trial. In April 2016 the study protocol was approved by the local Ethical Committee, Aviano. The project is scheduled to start in autumn 2016. Main objective: evaluation of the impact of a series of tools-''drug therapy setting interventions'' (DTSIs) applied by the clinical pharmacist on a cohort pf HIV-infected patients with comorbidities, afferent for care at CRO Aviano. The treatment arm will be submitted to DTSIs. DTSIs interventions (treatment group) consist in: motivational interview, sharing and delivery of printed, explanatory material in the patient's native language, reconciliation of patients medications at hospital admission and at discharge; identification of potential risks due to drug-drug interactions; monitoring of compliance to drug therapy, and finally detection of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occurring in the course of care. The control group will undergo only to scheduled standard medical visits at CRO. Results: We expect to recruit a total 350 patients for a 24-months period of follow-up. Statistical analysis will be performed by intention-to-treat and by protocol. At CRO Aviano, the Italian Cooperative Group on AIDS and Tumors (GICAT) has studied malignancies in HIV-positive patients since 1986 and has a leading role for studies conducted in Italy (Vaccher, 2014) Conclusion: Previous collected data from the previous trial performed at CRO Aviano (Target-Vig), showed a positive impact in the optimization of individual drug therapy and in the reporting of ADRs.",

Please specify your abstract type: Descriptive abstract (for projects) Background and objective: In 2015, our teaching hospital has participated to a worldwide survey (Global Point Prevalence survey (Global-PPS)) aimed to explore antimicrobial consumption and resistance in hospitals. Because broad spectrum antibiotics have to be followed with the attention of resistance prevention, we focused our analysis on these antibiotics in our hospital (carbapenems, piperacillin/tazobactam and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid). Design: The survey was performed by pharmaceutical team (senior and resident) with help of microbiologists and referring physicians. All wards of the hospital were included. Hospitalized patients treated with antimicrobial agent (J01, J02, J04A, P01AB, A07, J05AH, P01B from the ATC classification) prescribed at 8 a.m. on the day of the survey, were involved. From those who were treated by carbapenems, PIP/TAZ or AMX AC, following data were collected: age, gender, weight, doses, indications (probabilistic? documented? and if documented microbiological data), and mention of stop/review date of prescription. Results: The survey was carried out from April to June 2015 in 51 wards. Among the 1435 patients included, 369 patients (25.7%) were treated with antimicrobial agents.114 patients (30.9%) were treated with broad spectrum antibiotics: 53 (14.1%) with AMX-AC, 47 with PIP-TZ, 6 with Imipenem and 8 with meropenem. The mean age of patients was 60.5 \u00b1 17.7 and the weight was 67.9 \u00b1 13.9 kg. Their prescriptions were concentrated in three types of wards: 24 (21.1%) in ICU, 47 (41.2%) in medicine, 43 (37.7%) in surgery. Moreover, we observe that BSA were used to treat 33 (28.9%) community acquired infections, 54 (47.4%) nosocomial infections, 6 (5.2%) used as medical prophylaxis, or surgical prophylaxis (N = 19, 16.7%). In relation to the type of treatment: 66 were empirical treatment (including 25 prophylaxes) and 48 were targeted treatments (3 bacteraemia, 5 joint and bones infections, 1 cardiovascular system infection, 12 urinary tract infections, 10 lower respiratory tract infections, 10 skin and soft tissues infections and 7 others infections). Finally, 23 extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae and 1 third generation cephalosporin resistant Enterobacteriaceae non-ESBL producing were targeted by BSA regimen. Conclusion: In this survey, use of BSA is globally compliant to French guidelines and we identified no improper prescription: multidrug resistant bacteria infections, several diseases and empirical treatments with limited duration of regimen. This shows that control of the proper use of antibiotics especially those with a broad spectrum is efficient in our hospital and has to be continued. This has been made possible due to a multidisciplinary approach including physicians, bacteriologists and pharmacists.

Long-term efficacy is often questioned, and treatment has to be regularly re-examined, especially in EP. In our Geriatric day-hospital for assessment of frailty, a multidisciplinary team evaluates the patients and gives them preventative measures against the loss of autonomy. Medication evaluation is part of these measures. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of a standardized intervention on the optimization of BZD treatment. Setting and method: After a short interview and the delivery of an information booklet about BZD, patients were proposed an optimization of their BZD treatment (dosage reduction, occasional medication, switch to a short half-life BZD, or total discontinuation). Patients were followed up monthly by a phone-interview over a 6-months period.",

Among them, 50% have been taking a BZD for more than 10 years, and 29% were prescribed a long half-life BZD, which can be qualified as inappropriate in EP. 50% of the subjects were frail and 44% pre-frail according to the Fried criteria. At the end of the study, 33% of the patients had their BZD treatments optimized, including 17% of total discontinuation. Conclusion: In frail or pre-frail elderly population, a standardized intervention can be useful to improve BZD treatment. An extension to this intervention would be the creation of an organisation tasked with routinely monitoring the patients withdrawal over a 6 month period.

Any diabetic ketoacidosis case was reported. Conclusion: SGLT-2 Inhibitors added to other oral antidiabetic drugs or insulin in patients with uncontrolled T2DM significantly improved glycaemic control, reduced weight, blood pressure and triglycerides, and was generally well tolerated. In conclusion, SGLT-2 inhibitors, appears to be an important addition to the therapeutic options for the management of type 2 diabetes, particularly when used as add-on therapy. (1). Treatment safety takes part of the decision to undergo bariatric surgery. During multidisciplinary team meetings, the clinical pharmacist must rely on guidelines to limit drug-induced iatrogenesis. This review aims at assessing influence of bariatric surgery on the clinical impact and PK of cardiotropic drugs so as to document pharmacists' notifications. Setting and method: Literature review on Medline-1946 to may 2016-with terms: cardiovascular drugs AND bariatric surgery OR malabsorption syndrome. Related articles were reviewed. Main outcome measures: Pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic data and clinical impact of cardiotropic drugs. Results: A total of 924 titles, and abstracts when necessary, were screened for eligibility. After reviewing process, 15 studies were included: nine concerning digoxin, five beta-blockers (BB) and one amiodarone. Published studies varied in methodology: five case report, seven case control and three cohort studies. Studies reported variations of digoxin plasmatic concentrations among 22 patients versus 66, suggesting liquid oral form are preferred. No clinical event was notified. More the BB is liposoluble (propranolol), the higher the toxicity is, such as heart rate and blood pressure decreasing, with potential fatal outcomes. A case of amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism is described after bariatric procedure showing an increase plasma concentration adjusted to weight. Conclusion: While the impact on narrow therapeutic range drugs is documented, others cardiotropic drugs may cause serious patient injury justifying their monitoring. Therefore, risk must be identified for all patients undergoing bariatric surgery to setting up closely therapeutic monitoring. Further studies are still expected to lead to recommendations about posology and treatment withdrawal to improve patient safety.

            "text": "Setting and method: The study was conducted at Mount Carmel Hospital, a psychiatric hospital in Malta. Twenty outpatients were recruited by convenience sampling. The study was divided into two phases. During Phase 1, patient compliance was assessed using the Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS) survey and patients were administered Part A of a questionnaire entitled 'Assessment of the 7-Day Multi Dose pill box'. This questionnaire evaluated the patients' opinion regarding the 7-Day Multi Dose pill box before and after its use. In Phase 2, the chosen patients were given a demonstration on how to use the 7-Day Multi Dose pill box and the device was given to them to use at home for one week. After one week, Part B of the questionnaire was completed and compliance was re-assessed using MARS . Main outcome measures: Evaluation of adherence before and after use of the compliance aid device. Results: Of the 20 patients recruited, 9 were male and 11 were female. The mean age was 46 years (range 33-70) and the mean number of daily medications 6 (range 3-16). Upon initial scoring using MARS, 15 patients were adherent and 5 patients were nonadherent. A higher adherence was observed in patients taking 5 or more medications daily. Ten patients accepted to move on to Phase 2 of the study and took the device home to use for one week. Out of these 10 patients, 4 felt that the way they take their medication improved following use of the device and 7 out of 10 patients would consider buying the device since they found it practical and easy to use. Statistical analysis of MARS score before and after use of the device showed no significant improvement in compliance (p [ 0.05). There was no significant association between level of adherence and type of psychiatric condition (p [ 0.05). Furthermore, results did not indicate increased adherence in patients who have a carer in-charge of their medication administration or in patients using a compliance aid device (p [ 0.05). Conclusion: The use of a compliance aid device in psychiatric patients is challenging due to difficulty in establishing patient communication and motivation. The pharmacist is in a position to identify patients who would benefit from the compliance aid device.",

The deployment of this questionnaire is continuing via the University Hospital intranet in order to train all health professionals in good patient care. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Temocillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic exclusively active against Gram-negative pathogens. Its use can avoid that of broad spectrum antibiotics, such as carbapenems, for the treatment of infections due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae. However, the absence of recommendations by learned societies on temocillin use could lead to misuse and the emergence of resistance. The aim of this study is to identify the role of temocillin in a French University Hospital arsenal in order to limit ecological risks. Setting and method: A retrospective study was conducted in a 1500-bed University Hospital. All adult patients having received at least 2 days of treatment between June 2015 and April 2016 were included. Data collected for the study were: age, sex, treatment indication (type of infection, identified pathogen, dosage and treatment duration), previous antibiotics and therapeutic outcomes. Main outcome measures: The indicators chosen were: treatment indication, prescribed dose and treatment duration. Results: Two patients were included. In July 2015, temocillin was used in a 47 year old female as first-line treatment of intraperitoneal haematoma infection due to multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Prescribed at a dose of 2 g twice daily by an infectious diseases specialist, treatment was continued at the same dose for up 3 weeks with therapeutic success.",

Previously treated by imipenem/cilastatin, temocillin was prescribed as second-line treatment at a dose of 2 g twice daily by an infectious diseases specialist. Treatment was continued at the same dose for up 6 weeks with therapeutic success. Conclusion: The dissemination of antibiotic resistance among Gramnegative enterobacteriaceae continues to be an increasing threat for healthcare worldwide. Within this context, temocillin could be an interesting alternative. Determining the role of temocillin in a therapeutic arsenal is essential. Our hospital considers temocillin as a ''critical antibiotic'' although its use is not exclusively limited to the New Drug Application. Therefore, temocillin prescriptions are monitored permanently by infectious diseases specialists, microbiologists and pharmacists in order to improve the good use of this antibiotic and to optimise patient safety. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Drinkable solutions are more susceptible to deterioration and can lead to a potential risk for patient care. Having the right information at time of care is essential. The aim of this study is to assess nursing staff knowledge in a French University Hospital on the management of drinkable solutions to elaborate tools to help health professionals and to enhance equality of information in order to optimise patient care. Setting and method: An assessment of practice using a questionnaire was conducted in May 2016 among a share of the nursing staff in a Int J Clin Pharm (2017) Results: 133 completed questionnaires were collected. 20% of nursing staff replied that the period-after-opening is the same for all of drinkable solutions. This period is estimated at 1 month in 21% of cases, 2 weeks in 10% of cases and 7 days in 8% of cases. 58% of nursing staff do not know how to store drinkable solutions after opening. The date of opening or the date of expiry after opening are specified on the medicine bottle in respectively 77 and 3% of cases. Only 11% of nursing staff have tools pertaining to the management of drinkable solutions. These observations led the pharmacy to create and distribute appropriate tools. Storage methods for the drinkable solutions available in our hospital were collected directly from pharmaceutical laboratories. This information has been made available to nursing staff via drug control software (Pharma \u00d2 , Computer Engineering, Paris). Conclusion: This study highlights the lack of knowledge on the management of drinkable solutions and the lack of information available to nursing staff. In our hospital, the dissemination of appropriate data reduced inequalities in available information between care units. Data will soon be integrated within the drug prescription software (Mc KESSON USV2 \u00d2 , Crossway, San Francisco) in order to homogeneously train all health professionals in good patient care. Please specify your abstract type: Descriptive abstract (for projects) Background and objective: Medication reconciliation (MR) is a process which allows prevention of iatrogenic injuries during patient's hospitalisation and transfers. Since 2013, a clinical pharmacist has been integrated into the orthopaedic surgery care. He has performed MR at patients' admission. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of medication reconciliation performed by a clinical pharmacist. Design: A prospective monocentric study was conducted on patients admitted in an orthopaedic surgery care (elective or unplanned surgery), during 3 months. The clinical pharmacist established the Best Possible Medication History (BPMH) from at least three sources of information (including patient interview when possible). Then, it was compared to the Admission Medication Order (AMO) (from anaesthetists when elective or orthopaedists when unplanned). Unintended Medication Discrepancies (UMD) detected were discussed with prescribers in order to be corrected. Epidemiological data, number and type of UMD, therapeutic classes involved and the percentage of corrected UMD were collected and their potential clinical impact was assessed. Results: In this study, 325 patients were included during 3 months. Elective surgeries were concerned in 72% of the cases. At least one UMD was identified in 158 patients (49%) (median age: 77.1 years old; male/female ratio: 0.65). Of these, 133 (84%) were older than 65 years old. Finally, 406 UMD were detected, being 2.6 by patient. Main therapeutic classes concerned cardiovascular system (31%), nervous system (20%) and digestive system (18%). Of the 406 UMD detected by MR, there were 55% of omissions, 27% of inappropriate dosing and 13% of renewal prescriptions stopped by the patient. Finally, 87% of UMD were corrected. Of these 406 UMD, 2% were major errors (i.e. causing potential harm), 39% were significant errors (i.e. monitoring or intervention potentially required to preclude harm) and 59% were minor errors (i.e. without potential harm to the patient). Conclusion: Medication reconciliation process performed by a clinical pharmacist allows detection and correction of UMD on half of patients in surgery care particularly on elderly patients. The high proportion of UMD can be explained by the multiplicity of actors involved in medication management. Health Information Technology could help to focus MR on patients at high-risk of adverse drug events. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Darunavir plus Ritonavir (DRV/r) have shown optimized results in simplification strategies (monotherapy (MT) or dual therapy (DT)) for selected HIV + in randomized clinical trials and real life experience. Recent introduction of one pill DRV plus cobicistat co-formulation (DRV/c) may be particularly suited for both MT/DT allowing once daily administration optimizing dosage and adherence. The objective of our study is to evaluate efficacy and security of DRV/c in MT and DT. Setting and method: All HIV + adults with antiretroviral change to DRV/c in MT/DT at a reference hospital in the Northwest of Spain were included in this retrospective study. A statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS v.19.software. Main outcome measures: Epidemiological, clinical, antiretroviral regimen, serum creatinine, lipids and inmunovirological data (RNA-HIV and lymphocytes CD4) were compared previous and after change to DRV/c. Results: 71 HIV treatment-experienced patients have received DRV/c in DT (27) or MT (44). 76.1% were men with a mean age of 48 years. Main risk factors were: 45.1% heterosexual, 28.2% MSM, 18.3% injection drug users, 2.8% mother-to-child transmission, 1.4% transfusion in haemophiliac patient and 4.2% unknown. CDC category distribution was 64.8% A, 4.2% B, 28.2% C and 2.8% unknown. Overall mean nadir CD4 counts were 196.7 \u00b1 115.1cells/mcL. Mean time since DRV/c prescription to discontinuation or until analysis was 182.5 days [range 61-296]. 86.4% DRV/c MT were prescribed to patients with prior DRV/r MT in order to simplify treatment and the mean time of the duration of these prior therapies were 3.1 years. In case of DT, 66.7% were prescribed on patients with prior DRV/ r + 3TC with a mean duration of 1.3 years. Serum creatinine increases (1.03 vs. 1.08; p \\ 0.001) and CD4 decrease (714.1 vs. 663.3; p = 0.031) when patients move to DRV/c. No significant change in the other analytical parameters and all patients maintained undetectable. 2 patients discontinue DRV/c due to intolerance and inability to swallow in each case.",

One part of DRP may be avoided with using Medication Reconciliation (MR). The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of setting up a Medication History (MH) of patients in ED in an acceptable lap of time before they were transferred in another unit or discharged. Design: A 6 months prospective study was conducted in ED in a university hospital in France. Two junior pharmacists coached by a senior pharmacist, after a 2 months training for MR, were in charge of the data and MH collection. For all patients, we collected age, MH according to number of sources, discrepancies identified, adherence to treatment (according to the social security questionnaire), type of sources. MH were established according to community pharmacies, patients, previous electronic patient files, prescription sheets, patient's family, packs of pills and to the general practitioner (GP). For patients from Long Term Care Facilities (LTCF), the MH was established only by communication with the LTCF. Then, the current prescription was compared with the home medication regimen. MH and discrepancies (omitting medication, incorrect dose, ambiguous name) were recorded in the electronic patient files to be available during hospitalization. Because ED does not have a pharmaceutical review of prescriptions, only major discrepancies were transmitted to physicians. Results: We collected 1426 MH (187 from LTCF), with a sex ratio of 1.0 and a medium age of 74.5 years old. It represented an average of 9.5 MH per day or 19 min per MH. Among patients who did not come from LTCF, sources used by pharmacy students were patient's community pharmacy (967, 78% of cases), patient (890, 72%), previous electronic patient file (769, 62%), prescription sheets (634, 51%), call to GP (80, 6.5%), GP mail (78, 6.3%), patient's family (47, 3.8%), packs of pills (29, 2.3%), community nurse (26, 2.1%). Finally, 683 patients (48%) had been hospitalized, others were discharged. We analysed MH for 1099 patients: at least one DRP occurred for 599 patients (55%). Among 386 patients, 150 (39%) had an immediate pharmaceutical intervention because of the risk due to discrepancy. Among 203 patients who did not come from LTCF and who could communicate, 162 were good adherent to treatment (80%). Conclusion: This study highlights the great interest of the MH by pharmacists at ED, which avoids many DRP. The presence of pharmacists in ED contributes to maintain a safe environment for medication and to assist prescribers in the continuity of treatment between home and hospital. Spending 20 min by MH, we identify one DRP every 11 min. Nevertheless, it could be benefit to develop this activity because of the satisfaction of the emergency physicians. Currently, MR is the first step to develop clinical pharmacy in the ED.

When performing medication reconciliation (MR) in this environment, these challenge has to be taken into account and prioritizing patients for MR could be necessary. The objective of this study was to identify risk factors correlated to clinical relevant medication discrepancies (crMDs) among patients admitted to ED, and based on these revealed risk factors, develop a model for prioritizing patients for MR in the fast-paced work-flow at the ED. Setting and method: 276 patients continuously included at the ED, Diakonhjemmet Hospital (DH), Oslo, Norway. Trained pharmacists and emergency nurse conducted MR. Patient specific factors and revealed crMDs, between hospital admission records and information about prehospital medication use, were recorded. Binary linear regression was used to identify risk factors correlated to crMDs. The prioritizing model was built using statics and clinical experiences. Main outcome measures: What risk factors is correlated to crMDs and how precisely do the prioritizing model classify the patients as high-and low-risk patients. Results: 62% of the patients had C1 crMD. The following were identified as risk factors correlated to crMD and were suitable for inclusion in the prioritizing model; gender (woman), age (C60), C1 admission to hospital last 12 months, admission causes; surgical, malfunction, cancer. The model correctly classified 76.1% of the patients with crMDs as high risk. Further, 23.9% of the patients with crMDs were classified by the model as low-risk patients (false negatives). The model classified 27.1% of the patients who did not have a crMD as high-risk patients (false positives). Conclusion: The prioritizing model developed can be helpful in identifying what patients are at increased risk of having crMDs in the fast-paced work-flow at the ED. Identifying these patients will result in using the resources available in the ED in the most efficient manner and utilizing the full potential of the MR method. As a consequence of this, patient safety would be increased.",

Design: Multiple-choice questions were developed for prescribing recommendations established by our hospital with the collaboration of the doctor who is Chairman of the Central Committee of vigilance and risk associated with care (CVRIS). A link to the online survey was sent by email to 85 physicians practicing in 14 departments (eight paediatric services and six adult services). The results were extracted and interpreted in Excel \u00d2 . Results: 57% of physicians responded to the survey (17 medicine residents, 32 hospital doctors). In paediatric services, 93% of doctors know that only the KCl 7.46% should be used. 87% know the unit of prescription to be used (mmol/kg or mEq/kg), and 90% know that the maximum recommended infusion rate is 0.5 mmol/kg/hour (or 1 mmol/kg/h in recovery unit). In adult services, the recommended maximum rate of infusion (1 g/h) is known to all prescribers, but only 56% know that the concentration of KCl must be less than 4 g/L. 74% of paediatric doctors say that their KCl prescriptions are checked by a second doctor, but the answers in the same service area are sometimes contradictory. In adult services, only 6% of physicians say that the prescriptions are double-checked. The information brochure available on the intranet of the hospital is known by 16% of prescribers.",

Its use is contraindicated in the epileptic patient as it results in lowering the epileptogen threshold and is likely to trigger epileptic seizures. The clinical pharmacist should systematically warn the prescriber against this contraindication when analysing prescriptions. Following the onset in our establishment of an epileptic condition in a patient treated with nefopam, who had not been subject to any pharmaceutical intervention (PI), we set about analysing the validation practices regarding this contraindication and possibly implementing actions designed to improve those practices. Setting and method: Retrospective collection over a period of 17 months of prescriptions for patients hospitalized in 210 hospital beds with clinical pharmacy service (associating med-reconciliation, checking prescription according to medical file and participation to medical rounds): orthopaedic surgery, hepatic-gastro-enterology, general surgery, liver transplant and chest surgery. Records of patients with nefopam prescription associated to medication belonging to the therapeutic class of antiepileptics were consulted with a view to finding cases of epilepsy. The pharmaceutical alerts were extracted from the pharmaceutical software.

Five generalized tonic-clonic seizures, without recovery of normal consciousness between seizures, have occurred suddenly 15-30 min after the second administration. The patient was admitted to intensive care unit in order to control the epileptic seizures. A status epilepticus was diagnosed requiring intravenous drugs with clonazepam, phenobarbital and propofol. The patient was controlled and transferred in neurologic unit in order to complete paraclinical investigations. Its main antecedent was a severe head injury at the age of 7 years following a public road accident. The brain scan revealed an old frontal hypodensity. Rest of etiological assessment was negative (lumbar puncture, no infectious disease), numbers were normal. The definitive diagnosis was a status epilepticus on post-traumatic sequelae, sensitized by taking a proconvulsant drug. A treatment with levitiracetam was initiated at 750 mg twice a day. Outcome was favourable with no recurrence 10 months later, a recommendation was requested to pharmacovigilance. Results: The muscle relaxant activity of thiocolchicoside results of an agonist action on glycinergic receptors located primarily in the brain stem and spinal cord. However, thiocolchicoside also acts as an antagonist of the GABA-A receptor (mainly located in the cerebral cortex), this pharmacological action can cause a proconvulsant effect. Epilepsy is a very rare adverse effect, only few cases have been reported in literature. The epileptogenic activity of thiocolchicoside occur mainly in patients with a history of epilepsy, acute brain injury or possible blood-brain barrier disruption. The chronology is consistent with the responsibility of the drug as a promoting factor. Pharmacovigilance retains after analysing drug causality. Conclusion: The case history indicates that thiocolchicoside has a powerful epileptogenic activity. Thiocolchicoside can precipitate seizures in predisposed patients, and that its use should be avoided in patients with brain diseases (and therefore lower seizure thresholds) or blood-brain barrier disruption. Pharmacists could warn physicians and should verify the absence of notable history before dispensing thiocolchicoside.",

Patients are usually first treated by corticosteroids (CS) or immunomodulating drugs. Rituximab (RTX) has become another option for refractory AS, supported by few uncontrolled studies 1 . Because of its off-label use, our hospital pharmacy has implemented a controlled drug delivery. This work assesses a 2-years follow-up of patients treated by RTX and the resulted drug costs. Design: Patients registered in our database since December 2014 who received C1 injections of RTX to treat AS, were analysed to describe their eligibility criteria, conditions of management and the clinical and biological effects of the treatment (creatine kinase (CPK) used as biomarker). Patient files were consulted to collect all individual data and pharmaceutical software was used to review deliveries. Drug costs were also reckoned based on prices from French health insurance. Results: For 18 months, 14 patients (median age (min-max): 52 (20-76), 64% women) have been treated with RTX for refractory AS, the majority with anti-Jo1 antibodies (8). All patients suffer from muscular and lung affections, particularly interstitial pneumonia. Many are also living with arthropathies (10) or cutaneous disorders (9). Cardiac involvement is seldom (4 symptomatic patients). The mean age of diagnostic is 7.3 years and the mean treatment period is 2.6 years. The common treatment is 1 g at Day1 (D1) and D15, then 1 g all 6 months. Before RTX treatment, seven patients received C5 other drugs such as CS (93%), azathioprine (71%), methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil (57%). Prednisone and azathioprine are also prescribed with RTX respectively for 79 and 23%. Treatment is associated with cures of intravenous immunoglobulins for four patients. To date, median number of administrations per patient is 4 (1-8), D1 and D15 included. All patients have presented positive effects on both clinical and biological markers, mainly during the first 6 months after treatment induction. Wilcoxon tests show a significant difference in CPK level between D1 and M6, also between D1 and the last known result. Today, three complete remissions are specified in patient file; only one hepatitis B virus reactivation is reported. Since 2014, budget impact due to drug cost amounts to 119 000\u20ac. Conclusion: Whereas the use of RTX is controverted for treatment of all types of myopathy, AS could have one of the best response 1 . Our cohort shows real clinical results and positive effect on usual biomarker. Our experience demonstrates the safe and successful use of repeated administrations in refractory AS. However, there is a need for further controlled studies to assess the efficacy/safety of RTX and to define its place in the strategy in view of its cost-effectiveness ratio. The pharmaceutical controlled drug delivery has to be continued to supervise, support and document its proper off-label use.

The procedure defines that MR is the doctor's responsibility and describes how it should be performed. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the implementation of the procedure reduces medication discrepancies (MDs) in the charts at Bod\u00f8 hospital. and 53.9% (7/13) of the patients died before discharge. Parenteral nutrition was administered an average of 21.5 days (95% CI 2.5-40.5), of which 7.7 (95% CI 3.0-12.4) were with IPN. Previous SPN had been administered in 84.6% (11/13) of the patients. Before beginning IPN, the average triglycerides level was 608.1 mg/ dL (95% CI 388.1-828.0) but at the end of the IPN it was 324.9 mg/ dL (95% CI 245.4-404.5), which lead to a mean reduction of 283.2 mg/dL (95% CI 45.3-520.0; p = 0.02). Regarding to the total amount of lipids provided with parenteral nutrition, with IPN there was a mean reduction of 30.4 g (95% CI 12.4-48.5; p = 0.002) comparing to those administered with SPN. Conclusion: Usage of IPN in critically ill patients with HTG permits to adjust parenteral nutrition formulations to meet specific nutrition needs, enables to reduce the total amount of lipids administered and, therefore, it allows to significantly decrease triglycerides levels.",

            "text": "Please specify your abstract type: Descriptive abstract (for projects) Background and objective: The incidents involving patient misidentification (PM), or wrong patient medical errors (WPME), are medication errors (ME), near-miss or close-call situations which can pose a considerable threat to patient health. PM may be under-reported due to the unawareness of the error or the difficulty of identifying them. The aim of this study is to describe the incidence and categories of WPME in a university hospital. Design: Observational, retrospective analysis of the voluntary reported WPME in the pharmacy database since March 2010 until June 2016. These were classified in prescription, transcription, dispensing, administration and drug system errors. In addition, the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (NCCMERP) taxonomy was used for classifying ME according to the severity of the outcome. Results: Of 1767 ME registered, 50 of them were WPME (2.8%). 40.0% of them were due to prescription errors, which consist on wrong labelled medical orders, intermingled patient prescriptions or patient misidentification in computerized physician order entry (CPOE). The administration errors supposed a 30.0% of the total amount of WPME and dispensing errors were 18.0%. 6% of WPME were transcription errors, which occurred previously to the implementation of CPOE, and the remaining 6.0% were system errors after CPOE. The WPME reported took place in the hospitalization wards (44.0%), pharmacy (20.0%), outpatient services (16.0%), intensive care unit (16.0%) and day-care hospital unit (4.0%). 88.0% occurred at working days and 12.0% at the weekends. WPME were notified by pharmacists (62.0%), nurses (34.0%) and physicians (4.0%). Referring to the classification according to NCCMERP, 48.0% of WPME didn't reach the patient (category B) whereas 40.0% reached the patient but didn't cause harm (category C) and 8.0% required patient monitoring (category D). The remaining WPME (4.0%) caused harm to patients and required medical intervention (category E). Finally, in Int J Clin Pharm (2017) 39:208-341 283 more than half of WPME (62.0%), reporters suggested measures to prevent these errors. Conclusion: WPME represents near 3% of total ME reported in our hospital. Given that more than 50% reached the patient, safety measures must be implemented to reduce the risk of hazardous events. Additionally, further encouragement in notification is necessary in order to improve patient safety. Results: Two men diagnosed with RRMS aggressive evolution were included in the study. Age: 23 and 31. Both of them without any treatment by the time they started being treated with alemtuzumab (previously one of the patients had been treated with fingolimod, suspended by inefficiency). The protocol design for the elaboration and control of alemtuzumab in the Pharmacy Service ensures greater safety and represents a saving strategy. In addition, the development of the protocol in the electronic prescription system (SILICON \u00d2 ) facilitates the prescription, proper administration and standardization of treatment among patients. The protocol includes daily alemtuzumab infusion for 5 days and other necessary medications including premedication (metylprednisolone, omeprazole, paracetamol and metoclopramide) and anti-infective prophylaxis (aciclovir). Developed adverse effects during infusion were skin erythema, pruritus and fever. It was not necessary to stop the alemtuzumab infusion in any patient. During treatment, one patient developed a severe lymphopenia and upper respiratory tract infection (influenza A). Conclusion: The role of the pharmacist is critical at various stages, from the preparation and the administration guidelines, to detection, monitoring and reporting of adverse effects. Alemtuzumab is presented as an alternative for those patients who do not respond to standard therapies or who have rapidly evolving severe RRMS. Because of its mechanism of action it is important to closely monitor patients, with particular emphasis on prophylaxis of possible infections.",

Given this superiority, one would think that children were prompted to use solid formulations when available in an eligible dose. There are indications, however, that the conversion from liquid to solid formulation in children is influenced by characteristics of the liquid medication, rather than the child's ability to swallow solid medications. The aim of this study was therefore to explore if the proportion of oral liquid formulations differed between antibiotics commonly used for upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) in hospitalized children. Setting and method: We collected the sales data for 2015 for the children's department of the five university hospitals in Norway. The three most common oral antibiotics used for URTI in children were included: Penicillin V, amoxicillin and erythromycin. The proportion of oral liquids was calculated by dividing the number of defined daily doses (DDD) of liquids by the total oral DDDs for each substance.",

Amoxicillin had the highest proportion of liquid with 97%, followed closely by erythromycin at 94%. In contrast, only 70% of the DDDs sold of oral Penicillin V were liquids. Conclusion: Higher proportions of liquid amoxicillin and erythromycin compared to penicillin V were sold to children's departments in hospitals. There are several limitations regarding the quality of sales data, as we lack information of the administered doses as well as the child's age, gender, infection and specific needs. Infections in hospitals often require initial intravenous treatment, and oral switch will often be based on the initial treatment. Despite these limitations, the results fit well with earlier findings which indicate that children prefer liquid amoxicillin and erythromycin to penicillin V.",

In surgery departments, for planned hospitalizations, MR is performed 24-48 h after the PA (Pourrat X and al, 2013). During this period, some chronic treatments are unintentionally not prescribed to patients. The aim of proactive MR (PMR) is to anticipate the PA by collecting their medication history before their hospitalization. The objective of this study was to identify the barriers preventing PMR implementation in our hospital. Design: One week prospective study in digestive and orthopaedic surgery units in a 600 beds' university hospital. The main outcome is to identify which barriers prevent the collection of MR before PA including the evaluation of time required to collect the relevant information, reconcile any discrepancies after the PA and identify the right sources from which to perform the MR. Results: Eighteen patients with a median age of 59 years old (14-84) were contacted by phone one week before their scheduled surgery. These calls were conducted by pharmacy residents mainly between 6 and 8 p.m. (a more practical time for patients and at the end of pharmacist's routine tasks). An average of 1.7 (1-3) calls per patient were conducted. One patient was unreachable by phone. The average duration of the calls was 7 min (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . Twelve community pharmacy (CP) were contacted. In all cases, CP have accepted to share information about the patient's prescriptions by phone and sending it by fax during the day. Five pharmacists were not contacted because patients had no chronic treatment and consequently no regular CP. On 53 lines of prescriptions, 12 discrepancies between the patient's information and prescriptions were identified and 7 between prescriptions and the anaesthesia records. Drug history was reported in the patient's records by pharmacy students on the day of PA in order to be used immediately by prescribers. Surgery was cancelled for one patient.",

Additionally, a key hurdle is to obtain any necessary modification of the prescriptions by surgeons. PMR can be expected to produce time saving efficiencies given that at PA, prescribers will have their full medication history. This study also allowed us to highlight the good cooperation between patients, CP and the hospital. It is worth noting that efforts were made to accommodate the schedules of a majority of working patients. However, as we would expect pharmacy student to perform the PMR, they will most likely attempt to contact patients during standard working hours which may impact the number of patients they are able to reach.",

The aim of this study is to describe the use of trastuzumab emtansin (TDM-1) in clinical practice in a tertiary hospital and to evaluate its safety profile. Design: We performed a retrospective study of patients who started TDM-1 between January 2013 and December 2015. We recorded demographic data, clinical and treatment variables, number of doses received, reasons for discontinuation, progression-free survival (PFS) and adverse effects (AEs). Data were obtained from the chemotherapy prescription program and medical records. AEs were classified according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 of the National Cancer Institute. Results: Eleven female patients with a median age of 55.6 years [40.7-80.1] and an ECOG 1 (9/11) were included. TDM-1 was prescribed as a third or further line treatment in 8/11 patients and as firstline in one patient who develop disease recurrence within 6 months of completing adjuvant therapy. Median number of TDM-1 cycles was 8.5 . All treatments discontinuations were due to disease progression (6/11). PFS was 6.0 [1.9-20.7 months] (patients that received less than three cycles were excluded (n = 2)). Most frequent AEs were plaquetopenia, neutropenia and transaminitis but only grade 3 in three patients (two transaminitis and one neutropenia). Conclusion: The lower PFS obtained comparing to the pivotal study (6.0 vs. 9.6 months) could be explained by the later use of TDM-1 in clinical practice (8/11 patients received TDM-1 as third or further line while 61% in the pivotal study were first or second line).

Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: In invasive candidemia, three echinocandins are indicated: caspofungin, mycafungin and anidulafungin. The aim of this work is to establish which echinocandin to prescribe in a French University Hospital, given the scarcity of available clinical data in the literature regarding obese patients. Setting and method: In a French UHC with 1500 beds, a multidisciplinary working group composed of a microbiologist, an infectious disease specialist and a pharmacist has been set up to analyse the various therapeutic options. Main outcome measures: Analysis of the literature, pharmacoeconomic study. Results: Four medications have been identified as possible therapeutic options. Their adverse effects are similar and their administration rhythm is the same. According to recommendations by the ESMID (2012) and the IDSA (2016), the level of evidence for these three echinocandins in initial treatment of candidemia is equivalent. Concerning obese patients, no weight limit is mentioned, Int J Clin Pharm (2017) 39:208-341 287 despite recommended dosage adjustment. Caspofungin must be prescribed at a dose of 70 mg/day for patients weighing over 80 kg. Micafungin must be administered at a dose of 100 mg/day regardless of patient weight. In the case of persistence of cultures or if clinical condition does not improve, the dose may be increased to 200 mg/day. Anidulafungin, which is not referenced in our establishment, must be prescribed at the same dose regardless of patient weight.",

The majority of ED staff (100% of physicians and 63% of nurses) found pharmacist as a good academic resource in the Emergency department. Conclusion: The physicians reported an improvement regarding the quality in the medication reconciliation made by pharmacists in the Emergency department and both physicians and nurses expressed a need that pharmacists work in the Emergency department on a more permanent basis. More information in general and especially better communication with nurses regarding the care of the patients are important actions need to optimise collaboration with pharmacist in the Emergency department. Results: A total of 105 patients were included in the study, median age was 53 years and 63% were males. They used in average four drugs regularly (range 1-15). Almost three-quarters (70%) of the patients reported high or moderate adherence to all their regularly used drugs (MMAS-8 C 6 (max 8)). Of the 39 patients using oral spasmolytics, 74% reported high or moderate adherence to these drugs. The majority (97% of the patients) had high perceptions of necessity to their treatment (BMQ [ 2.5 (max 5)), and 54% had a high level of concern (BMQ [ 2.5 (max 5)). Logistic regression analysis showed that there was no association between adherence and pain, nor between adherence and spasticity. Younger age was found to be associated with higher risk of nonadherence. Conclusion: Even though overall adherence was high, the patients were more concerned to take their medicines compared to other patients with other chronic conditions.

For instance, several medicines were prescribed in primary care service prior to admission, but not at admission to the hospital. In addition, at admission, some medicines were listed as prescribed medications although not found in the medication lists in primary care service. We also observed that newly started and discontinued medicines were documented in the hospital discharge letter, but not implemented in primary care service. According to health care personnel in primary care service, insufficient communication about the patients' medications at discharge from hospital, led to corrections in the medication lists based on their previous knowledge about the patients. In addition, justified medication changes at discharge from hospital were not always implemented in primary care service due to professional disagreement. Some stated that lack of trust was one reason for not always taking changes into account, often based on earlier experience. Conclusion: These observations indicated that MDs occurred both with and without intent when patients from primary care service were admitted to hospital and returned back due to poor communication. Medication errors during hospitalisation and unproven intentional changes may be the consequences. Due to this, it is important to improve the communication and confidence between professionals in the hospital and primary care service in order to reduce the number of MDs and to enhance patient safety.

In the newly-admitted, 11 DD (85%) was related to the ICU and 2 DD (15%) to other wards. Of the 16 DDs, 11 (69%) were accepted by the physician. An example of a severe DD identified was an omission of prednisolone to a patient admitted to the ICU. Conclusion: Most DD were identified in patients admitted to or transferred from ICU, which uses the incompatible system CIS. Pharmacist systematic medication reconciliation helps identify these DD and prevent DRP. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Antibiotic related drug interactions are more likely in intensive care unit patients due to common polypharmacy and antibiotic usage. The aim of this study is to determine the antibiotic related drug interactions with three different online databases (Micromedex-paid, Medscape-free and Drugs.com-free) and to evaluate these interaction information by clinical pharmacist. Setting and method: A retrospective, descriptive study was set up in Hacettepe University Hospital's Intensive Care Units, between November 10 and December 31, 2015. 62 patients who use at least one antibiotic were involved in this study. All drugs were assessed by each three databases and only antibiotic drug interactions were evaluated. Clinical significance of identified drug interactions were evaluated by clinical pharmacist. Main outcome measures: Clinical pharmacist's assessment in significance of drug interactions indicated by three online databases. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: An implementation of clinical pharmacy practice by postgraduate students in intensive care units is a new way of learning in postgraduate education which creates opportunities in multidisciplinary collaboration in clinical pharmacy research, and also has influence on clinicians' routine patient care process. This system in educational program was ongoing in the Department of Clinical Pharmacy since 2014. As a part of this educational program, drug related problems in intensive care units were described and analysed, an influence of clinical pharmacy postgraduate students on patient treatment process was sought. Setting and method: A prospective, cross-sectional study was performed between the March-June 2016 in Hacettepe University Hospitals, Department of Internal Diseases Intensive Care Units which consists of 17 beds. Three postgraduate pharmacy students from the Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy conducted medication reconciliation in order to identify any problems in patients' medical orders. Drug Related Problems (DRPs) were identified by the students and recommendations for management were approved by a supervisor of Clinical Pharmacy Department before they were directed to physicians for approval. The students were not authorized to undertake any action in patient care process, therefore all required interventions for DRP were undertaken by physicians and the acceptance ratio of the interventions were recorded. The Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe Foundation classification system (v.6.2) was used to asses DRPs. Main outcome measures: Determination of DRPs by pharmacists and evaluation of their interventions' acceptance by physicians in intensive care units. Results: During the study period, 106 patients were admitted to the intensive care units. Each patient's medication orders were evaluated and 80 interventions were recommended by postgraduate students. The number of interventions per patient was 0.75. The acceptability rate of interventions by physicians was 96.3%. In addition, physicians were provided drug information on seven different occasions. Recommendations regarding drug therapy were mainly related with treatment effectiveness and adverse reactions. The common causes of DRPs were requiring dose adjustment due to pharmacokinetic problems (42.5%), no therapeutic drug monitoring (18.8%), inappropriate timing of administration and/or dosing intervals (11.3%), requiring dose adjustment due to deterioration/improvement of diseases (6.3%), inappropriate drug selection (5%) and new indication for drug treatment presented (5%). The most common drugs responsible for DRPs were ranitidin, levothyroxine, allopurinol, pantoprazol, piperacillintazobactam and vancomycin.",

This is important because throughout the world antibiotics continue to be one of the most important classes of therapeutic agents due to their vital role in saving patient lives. Key goals of antimicrobial stewardship are to improve clinical outcomes, prevent antibiotic resistance, promote patient safety, and reduce health care cost. Pharmacist are in the frontlines because they perform antibiotic stewardship activities, such as selecting the most optimal antibiotic agent, adjusting drug-dosage, and stopping use of unnecessary antibiotics. As a result of the continuous rise in antibiotic resistance and decline in development of new antibiotics, antibiotic stewardship programs are proving to be indispensable in a health care settings. Setting and method: 100 adult and paediatric inpatients receiving antibiotic therapy in the hospital Medipol University has been evaluated. Patients were selected randomly in the hospital system. Patients were evaluated for antibiotic susceptibility results and compliance with antibiotic management guidelines. Main outcome measures: To evaluate the antibiotic therapy in patients with culture results and to determine according the treatment guidelines. Results: It was observed 10 different pathogens in blood culture results of 51 inpatients out of 100 patients who were treated with antibiotics in hospital. Antibiotic susceptibility results for Acinetobacter spp, Staphylococcus spp, Enterococcus spp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp, E. coli spp, Streptococcus spp, Corynebacterium spp, Streptococcus pneumonia and Enterobacter spp are evaluated in the study. Klebsiella spp was the most isolated pathogen at total of 85 culture results. Most frequently resistance were Int J Clin Pharm (2017) Results: A total of 289 (28%) questionnaires were completed. Of these, approximately 80% were answered by hospital nurses, the remaining mainly by physicians (18%) and 2% ''other''. On the question ''What is your general perception of the benefit of the clinical pharmacy service; for collaborating health professionals? for the patient?'' the total benefit was ranked 5.45 and 5.54 respectively (Scale from 0 (''no benefit'') to 6 (''beneficial to a very large extent''). The open questions: ''What disadvantages/advantages have you experienced by the introduction of clinical pharmacist into multidisciplinary teams?'' received 153/185 comments respectively. Physical obstacles regarding office space, interference with the decision making process, more time consuming processes and the issue of relying too much upon the advices given was reported as possible disadvantages. 120 respondents answered ''None'' to this question. The comments regarding advantages dealt mainly with general increased patient safety and quality assurance. In addition, advantages as work-load relieve, time saved, collegial support, practical help, and learning interchange between professions, were highlighted.",

The data were raised on a given day in each services and recovered thanks to the prescriptions software but also through interviews with the patients and their doctors. It was examined whether there was a BZD prescription (hypnotic or anxiolytic), whether the duration was superior or not to the duration of the AMM and whether the prescription was done in our hospital centre. If the prescription was already part of the patient treatment, we looked if it was possible for the patient to stop using it, according to the HAS criteria. On their discharge, the letters and BZD prescriptions were also analysed and some patients' general practitioner were contacted after their discharge. Results: 185 patients (median age 83 years old) were included from November 2015 to March 2016. 59.5% (110/185) of the patients had at least one BZD prescription the day we collected the data. We found only one BZD in 81 prescriptions (73.6%) and among them 77.7% (63/81) were anxiolytic BZD. Among those prescriptions, 62.7% (69/ 110) already existed before the hospitalization and 37.3% (41/110) were given during the hospitalization (24 were prescribed automatically). 59.4% (60/110) of the prescriptions did not respect the legal duration of the AMM (9 pieces of data were not found). 12.2% (5/41) already exceeded this duration limit. Among the patients who already had a BZD treatment before going to hospital, 24.6% (17 out of 69) could consider stopping their use of BZD. By the end of this study, 143 patients were discharged from hospital, among them 48.3% (69/ 143) with a prescription of BZD. 55.2% (16/29) of the prescriptions established during the hospitalization had been renewed when the patient came out of the hospital, we managed to contact ten general practitioners (approximately 53.4 days after their discharge), nine patients carried on their BZD treatment, among them one patient had reduced his consumption. Conclusion: This study is an example of the high proportion of BZD prescriptions in France which the majority doesn't respect the legal length of the AMM. The prescriptions of BZD in the hospital are generally systematically renewed by the general practitioners. The patients must be informed about the risks of using those molecules. In order to ameliorate this practice in the hospital, a proper use leaflet, reminding the prescriptions of BZD, has been created and distributed in each services to make people aware.

The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of drug-related problems (DRPs) and medication discrepancies in internal medical patients with complex treatment at hospital admission. Further, to investigate to which extent DRPs were identified as a result of medication reconciliation, and to which extent DRPs could be associated to the hospitalization. Setting and method: Patients with at least four regular medicines from two different therapeutic groups were consecutively included at admission to an internal medicine ward at a University hospital in Norway in the period 01.09.14-15.02.15. Pharmacists used the Integrated Medicines Management (IMM) model for medication reconciliation and medication reviews at admission. A medication discrepancy was defined as any discrepancy between the recorded medication list at admission and the patient's actual use of medications, as revealed by medication reconciliation. The patients' actual use of medications, medical journal and laboratory results, were used to perform a medication review at admission time and identify DRPs. The proportion of DRPs revealed due to medication reconciliation was calculated. Moreover, the project group retrospectively assessed possible DRP-induced hospitalizations based on clinical history, cause(s) of admission and identified DRPs. Main outcome measures: The main outcome was the median number of DRPs per patient at admission. The proportion of DRPs revealed due to medication reconciliation, the proportion of patients with DRPs possibly associated to the hospitalization, and the median number of medication discrepancies, were included as secondary outcomes. Results: 120 patients were included, 50.0% women. Median patient age was 79 (range 27-96) and most of the patients were home-living before admittance (89.2%). In total 1359 DRPs were identified at admission, with a median number of 11 (range 2-27) per patient. 99 DRPs (7.3%) were identified due to medication reconciliation. For 25 patients (20.8%) a causal relationship between the hospitalization and the DRPs was assessed as ''possible''. Medication discrepancies were revealed in 113 of the 120 included patients (94.2%), with a median number of 4 (range 0-14) per patient. Conclusion: Internal medical patients with complex drug regime are frequently exposed to DRPs and medication discrepancies at hospitalization. Medication reconciliation could be essential to identify DRPs, which is likely a common cause of hospitalization in the studied patient population.",

The average age was 78 years (70% of patients over 75 years old) and 59% of the patients were women. 32% of patients had renal impairment. 73% of patients were treated with VKA, and 27% with NOACs. It was the first prescription of OA for 27% of patients (56% with VKA; 44% with NOACs). The most common indication was the non-valvular atrial fibrillation (60%). In this indication, 99% of patients had CHA2DS2-VASc score C2, and nearly 30% had a high risk of bleeding (HAS-BLED score C3). 8 drug interactions were observed, and 35 ADRs occurred related to OA. 42% of patients with an ADRs had a HAS-BLED score C3. 12.5% of prescriptions were considered inappropriate, including 45% NOACs (no monitoring renal function in 13% of patients over 75 years initiating treatment, inappropriate posology in 14%, and 3% of contraindications). The rate of pharmaceutical interventions was 4%. Nearly 60% of the prescriptions were already adapted when the pharmacist was starting analysis. Conclusion: Prescribers are sensitized of the risks on the OA prescriptions, which explained the delay upon PA and low rate of pharmaceutical interventions. However, the high number of inappropriate prescriptions shows the necessity to improve the PA process on these drugs, particularly by actions on therapy initiation and patient monitoring, especially for NOACs.

In France, the national drug safety agency has defined a list of ''critical antibiotics''. This list includes antibiotics particularly generator of bacterial resistance (amoxicillinclavulanate, cephalosporine, fluroquinolone) and antibiotics called ''last resort'' (antibiotics against Gram-positive cocci, car-bapenem\u2026). At our regional level, an evaluation of prescription of these critical antibiotics was proposed to all medical centers. The aim was to evaluate the quality of prescription of these critical antibiotics. Design: The regional working group (pharmacists, infectious diseases physicians and biologists) had developed a collection grid including data on patients, antibiotics and four criteria: adequate molecule, compliance with medical prescriptions, duration of antibiotic therapy and reassessment at 72 h. This is a prospective study proposed to all health institutions (public and private), which had to be completed on a given day in all care units and had to be conducted by a team of multi-professional evaluators. The study included a quantitative part (number of patients hospitalized in the audited units, number of patients receiving antibiotics and number of critical antibiotic prescriptions) and a qualitative part (adequate to the four criteria). Results: Response rate was of 84%. The study investigated on 7026 patients hospitalized in the audited units, including 1391 patients (20%) receiving antibiotics. Among the 1391 patients, 89% were hospitalized in medical, surgery or obstetrics units We recorded 865 prescriptions of ''critical antibiotics particularly generator of bacterial resistance'' (53% amoxicillin-clavulanate, 30% ceftriaxone, 14% fluoroquinolone and 3% other third-generation cephalosporine) and 42 prescriptions of antibiotics called ''last resort'' (74% carbapenem).

The expertise of infections diseases physician was requested in only 13% of the cases. The antibiotics were prescribed in majority to treat bronchopulmonary infections (38%), urinary tract infections (16%) and intraabdominal infections (16%). Ninety-two percent of the prescriptions had a proper indication. 66% of the prescriptions complied to the guidelines. The duration of antibiotic therapy was adequate in 82% of the cases. Only 45% of the prescriptions were correct according to these three criteria. Forty-four percent of the prescriptions were reassessed and adapted by the physician.",

Design: An online survey conducted in May 2016 was addressed to head pharmacists of the 134 health facilities in the region, giving a total of 100 head pharmacists concerned. It included questions on the software used by the health facility, the development of medication reconciliation and its traceability, formulation of operational requirements to the editors of software and availability of a module integrating medication reconciliation provided by the software. Results: Seventy-eight pharmacists (78%) participated in the study, with all types of health facilities represented: public hospitals, clinics, home health agencies, haemodialysis structures and after care and rehabilitation facilities. Thirty different software were identified in the region. 27 (35%) pharmacists planned to develop medication reconciliation in their health facility and 20 (26%) were already carrying out this activity. Within these 26%, medication reconciliation was conducted on paper only for 9 (45%) of them, while 11 (55%) were using a computerized system (patient file, pharmaceutical software, other) for traceability. The most widely used software in the region contains a module enable for computerized medication reconciliation, and three other editors are currently developing one. No development is scheduled for another three editors nonetheless commonly used in the region. 15 (19%) pharmacists had contact with the editor of the software, and 10 had given thought to the preparation of requirement specifications to the editor to develop an integrated module of medication reconciliation. Conclusion: Despite the interest attributed to medication reconciliation and despite the need of a fully integrated module of medication reconciliation to HIS, only a few health facilities of the region possess an appropriate computerized system to develop this activity. This study underlines the approaches already made by pharmacists to editors in order to integrate medication reconciliation to the HIS. Subsequently, retrieving these approaches and writing specifications common to all health facilities is scheduled, in order to assist them in providing a strong incentive for the editors to integrate medication reconciliation to existing HIS.

There is lack of knowledge of clinical pharmacists' experiences in interprofessional collaboration. Our objective was to explore the challenges and barriers experienced by clinical pharmacists in interdisciplinary teams in Norway and incorporation of expanded pharmacist roles in hospital settings. Setting and method: This qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured interviews. A total of 13 clinical pharmacists from four (government) hospitals were included in the study. The interviews were audio recorded using a digital recorder. The recordings were transcribed verbatim. Main outcome measures: Challenges and barriers clinical pharmacists experience in interdisciplinary teams in hospital setting. Results: The main findings are that the pharmacists' role is little known to other health care professionals, particularly at hospitals with short tradition for clinical pharmacy services. Clinical pharmacists have great motivation from being able to influence drug treatment for patients. From the perspective of the participating pharmacists they succeed in interdisciplinary cooperation when their professional knowledge solves the patients' drug-related problems. Communicating recommendations to physicians with professional credibility has great importance for the intervention to be implemented. Using the theoretical framework of communicating tensions, we argue that the pharmacists in our study use indirect communication to prevent physicians defensiveness to recommendations. Lack of education in interprofessional cooperation and communication is apparent in this study. The participants also stated that there should be some form of quality assurance or education requirements before one can work as a clinical pharmacist. Conclusion: Training in communication for graduates and interprofessional collaboration during the undergraduate pharmacy education, can possibly help pharmacists with integration in interdisciplinary teams. Increased attention to teamwork from the hospital leadership is essential for the implementation of interprofessional collaboration in a larger context. Please specify your abstract type: Descriptive abstract (for projects) Background and objective: Antifungal therapy in the ICU, particularly therapy targeting resistant aspergillosis, mucormycosis and systemic candida, is often of lifesaving importance. Posaconazole and voriconazole are the antifungal agents of choice. Our aim was to compile a tool that can be used at the ICU to address aspergillosis, mucormycosis and systemic candida in an optimal manner. Design: Female patient, age 50 + , liver transplant, CRP [ 300 mg/ L, creatinine [ 150 lmol/L. Abdominal X-ray imaging revealed four large abscesses and laboratory analyses confirmed mucormycosis. Posaconazole intravenous (300 mg one times daily) and liposomal amphotericin B (1 mg/kg/day) were initiated. The inflammatory markers remained unchanged 5 days following initiation of therapy with no change in size or number of abscesses and the patient developed sepsis. Amphotericin B dose was increased to 3 mg/ kg/day. After 1 week the inflammatory parameters and size of abscesses began to fall. The dosage form of posaconazole was switched from intravenous to mixture. The dose remained the same and within 24 h the CRP rose to 600 mg/L. Results: Pharmacist intervention revealed a missing loading dose of intravenous posaconazole as well as incorrect dosage of the per oral form due to bioavailability variation. Posaconazole mixture dose was increased to 400 mg two times daily. Through serum concentration analysis of posaconazole was suggested prior to the dose increase. The serum concentration was 0.6 mg/L (range [1.0-1.25) . Through serum concentration 4 days later was 1.2 mg/L. Both CRP and abscess size were on the decline. A dosage and TDM pocket card for posaconazole therapy of mucormycosis, aspergillosis and candida was compiled. Conclusion: Optimal systemic fungal infection therapy is essential, especially in the critically ill. Of special importance is TDM and correct dose adjustment when dosage-form changes occur. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Potentially inappropriate prescriptions and omission of prescription, respectively IP and OP, are common issues in the pharmacotherapy, especially in vulnerable population, such as elderly and children. There are many available tools detecting IP and OP for geriatrics, however, similar tools are less common in paediatrics. Therefore, a first target tool for paediatric population: POPI \u00abPaediatrics: Omission of Prescriptions and Inappropriate Prescriptions\u00bb was created and was validated by Delphi Method in 2014. We aim to evaluate inter-rater reliability between health care professionals, who apply POPI. Our study also assessed their satisfaction and the accessibility of this tool. Setting and method: Twenty cases with or without IP or OP were selected. These cases were identified in a previous retrospective IP-OP prevalence study on 15.973 patients. These patients were admitted to the emergency department of a university mother and child hospital, between October 2014 and March 2015. One doctor and one pharmacist, who participated in the creation of POPI tool, identified IP and OP in 20 cases and composed ''standard answers''. These cases were then reviewed independently by eleven clinicians (including generalists, paediatricians, pharmacists, residents, general practitioners), who did not experience this tool before. Inter-evaluator agreement was calculated by using the agreement Kappa test. The satisfaction of users was also evaluated. Main outcome measures: Inter-evaluator agreement, the median time of use and the satisfaction of users. Results: A high level of agreement of IP and OP detection was recorded (IP: k median = 0.80; OP: k median = 0.71). The easy use of POPI was approved by 91% evaluators. The median time of use was 2 min 45 s per case (quartiles : 2.4-3.4) .",

Please specify your abstract type: Descriptive abstract (for projects) Background and objective: Drug dosing during CVVH is challenging due to changes in pharmacokinetic parameters brought about by the patients' deterioration in health and factors associated with the physical process of filtration. This is of particular significance in the ICU. In addition, there is the issue of the patients' diuresis or lack of such. This will affect the total clearance (Cl total ) of the drug. The dose of antibiotics must therefore be calculated individually taking into account all of the above as well as changes of filtration parameters. Our aim was to illustrate how such dosage calculations can be undertaken. Design: A 50-year-old male patient, weight 75 kg, diagnosed with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection. The trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole dose was 7.5 mg trimethoprim/kg/day every 8 h as specified for anuric patients on CVVH. Patient was initially anuric for 3 days after which diuresis was started. The dose was recalculated. Results: Creatinine clearance (CrCl) related to CVVH during the anuric period was calculated accounting for ultrafiltration rate, sieving coefficient, blood-flow, haematocrit concentration and pre-dilution. The value was 22 ml/min. Following diuresis on day 4, remaining kidney function was assessed by measuring urine and serum creatinine. The value for CrCl renal (18 ml/min) was added to the extracorporeal clearance, and gave a total clearance of40 ml/min. This warranted dose adjustment of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole since this drug requires normal dosage at CrCl [ 30 ml/min. Conclusion: During CVVH, the presence or absence of diuresis must be taken into consideration when dosing antibiotics. In anuric patients, the CVVH-machine set up constitutes CrCl total , but in patients with diuresis, the remaining CrCl renal should be added.

The count was performed every 2-3 weeks, and the forms in each count was pooled together as one point of measure. The quality of medicine lists in discharge lists was evaluated based on the Norwegian Patient Safety Program criteria. Medicine lists in discharge lists from week 39 to 51 (n = 102) were pooled together and compared to medicine lists in weeks 36-39 (n = 46). Results: The results of reconciliation was divided into the subsections of Surgical ward B, and represent the number of completed tasks as signed for in the reconciliation form. The Surgical subsection showed a significant increase in patients with pre-checked medicine lists and reconciled medicine lists over the measured time period. Similar results were not found in the Orthopaedic subsection. As for the quality of medicine lists in the discharge lists, significant improvement was seen in all set criteria, with the exception of ''source'' in the Surgical subsection. In the Orthopaedic subsection however, no significant improvement was seen in any of the criteria other than ''indication for use''. Conclusion: The implementation of reconciling medicine lists at discharge was successful. However, both subsections need to work further to ensure continuation and improvement of the process.

In December 2015 the pharmacist also started to follow up on the pharmacist notes not considered by a physician the previous day to ensure that the physician considered the discrepancies. Results: There were identified 599 discrepancies between the patients' actual medication at admission and EMS at the hospital in 306 patient records (1.96 discrepancies per patient).

The main objective of the study was to describe and quantify pharmaceutical validation on injectable anti-infective drugs prescriptions restored in a pharmaceutical reconstitution unit. Setting and method: An observational descriptive study was carried out on each prescription with at least one injectable anti-infective drug that has to be reconstituted before administration. The process was as follows: 1-prescription by the physician on an electronic prescription software, 2-pharmaceutical validation and if necessary pharmaceutical intervention (PI) made by phone call, 3-reconstitution at the pharmacy, 4-administration to the patient. The pharmaceutical validation methodology followed the French Society of Clinical Pharmacy (SFPC) guidelines ''prescriptions screening and analyses level'' published in the Good Practices of Clinical Pharmacy and one resident and one pharmacist were devoted to the activity every day. Main outcome measures: The pharmaceutical validation was quantified by the number of PI by patient, which were categorized according to the SFPC guidelines. Results: During 4 months, a total of 222 PI were collected. They concerned 93 patients with an average of 2.4 PI per patient. Among them, 11.8% (11) concerned paediatric population. Antibiotics were involved in 53.2% (118) then followed by 36.9% (82) cases (59.5% (69) biological assessment issues, 37.1% (43) absence of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and 3.4% (4) the drug hasn't been adapted to the weight), dosage adjustments in 25.2% (56), information missing concerning the treatment indication in 15.8% (35) and miscellaneous PI in 6.8% (15) such as wrong clinical service on the prescription, etc. Approval rate of physicians was 79.3% (176). Conclusion: This study has shown that even if prescriptions were secured by electronic prescription software, the pharmaceutical validation remains essential. In that case, the centralization of the reconstitution of injectable anti-infective drugs enabled to generalize this activity on all prescriptions of the hospital. However, the pharmaceutical validation was focused only on anti-infective drugs, that was not fully efficient and must be extended to the whole prescription. It is a priority to develop a comprehensive and exhaustive validation on every medical prescription; however, this activity is highly time consuming and needs larger and more trained staff.",

Setting and method: Patients admitted to the Acute Admissions Unit were selected based on their age and the number of prescriptions in a period of 4 months. Patients 65 years or more which received six or more drugs were included in the study. Only patients who later were transferred to another medicine ward were included in the study. The pharmaceutical medicine review was performed by a clinical pharmacist using minimum two different sources; the electronic medical record and medication-lists. The guideline of Pharmaceutical medicine review in the Hospital Pharmacy Central Denmark Region was used as the standard-guideline. In addition, theSTART/STOPP criteria version 2 was used.",

Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: The objective of this work is to assess prescribing practices of somatostatin analogues in a surgery department, and to analyse the conformity of switching from immediateacting octreotide to the long-acting release (LAR) form, in accordance to laboratories' guidelines. Setting and method: Retrospective observational study. A focus was realized on patients admitted in a digestive surgery unit between January 1 and December 31, 2015. The patients' medical records were reviewed for clinical features, diagnosis workup and treatment strategies. Main outcome measures: Medical records for patients with diagnosis of gastro-entero-pancreatic or endocrine tumors who had received injections of LAR octreotide during hospitalization were reviewed and the economic impact of prescriptions errors has been evaluated. Results: Of the evaluated 234 patients, 73 (31%) were hospitalized in surgery digestive unit; mean age at first administration of octreotide was 66 years and 58% were male. The male and female ratio was 1.35:1. Reasons for hospitalization were: digestive system neoplasms (75%), fistula (7%), intestinal obstructions (4%) and other pathologies (14%). Of the 73 patients treated with octreotide, 41 (56%) received a LAR form. Only four patients received doses in accordance with guidelines: one at 20 mg/month LAR form and three at 30 mg/month LAR form, after having respectively been treated by intravenous octreotide at 300 and 600 mcg/day during 7-10 days. Medical prescriptions of the 37 remaining patients did not comply: all patients received 30 mg/month after an intravenous treatment of 300 mcg/day, instead of 20 mg/month. From a financial perspective, these misuses have led to an additional cost of 6659.7 euros for the hospital, excluding tax (30 mg: 1389.29\u20ac/unit and 20 mg: 1212\u20ac/unit). Conclusion: Despite the publication of octreotide release form proper use recommendation in our hospital, 90% of patients of digestive unit are not right treated. A new guideline will be written added by doses of long-acting release and economic data. This work will be transmitted to specialists by clinical pharmacists.",

However, the median time to administration is less than 1 h for both formulary and non-stored/non-formulary drugs; and more than 95% of formulary drugs and around 90% of non-stored/non-formulary drugs were administered within 24 h following their prescription. There was no significant difference in the mean number of omitted doses or in the delays between the site where the centralized pharmacy is located and the other sites, except for one of them. A delay representing 1.5 or more omitted doses was found for 332 (1.96%) prescriptions. Among them, only 17 were considered potentially clinically relevant. None of them caused severe harm to the patients involved. Conclusion: In our setting, non-stored/non-formulary drugs take more time to be delivered than formulary drugs, but more than 95% of formulary drugs and around 90% of non-stored/non-formulary drugs are administered within 24 h following their prescription. None of the 17 patients who experienced delays underwent severe harm. Our study showed that delays also occur for formulary drugs but no systematic cause of omission was identified; further studies should focus on all dose omissions during hospitalization.",

Medication errors behind these ADE occur mainly during the transition steps of care pathway. In this context, medication reconciliation process has been implemented in our vascular surgery department. The objective of this study is to Identify unintentional discrepancies (UID) and assess their potential clinical impact Design: A pharmacy resident or a pharmacy student reconciliated patients: aged older than 65 or with at least five chronic treatments at admission or suffering from chronic diseases. Patients were considered reconcilable if at least two reliable sources on usual patient's treatment were available. These many sources of data (patient interview, prescription or interview of general practitioner, reference dispensary, drug box \u2026) were compared to the admission prescription during the first 48 h of hospitalization to detect and correct UID. Based on gravity scale promoted by the French High Authority of Health, two pharmacists (a resident and a senior) and a vascular surgeon reviewed every UID in order to define their potential clinical impact. The UIDs were considered minor if it leads to no consequence for the patient, clinically significant if it leads to essential monitoring, major if it could cause temporary clinical consequences, and critical if it could result in permanent clinical consequences or the involvement of the prognosis. Results: Between February 15th and May 31st 2016, a total of 102 patients have been reconciled. 10 patients were excluded due to a lack of reliable sources. Mean age was 73.9 years old (\u00b111.4) and sex ratio M/F was 0.7. 85% of the reconciliated patients' admissions were scheduled. The mean number of medication was 10.8 (\u00b12.9). 38 patients (41%) had at least one UID and the mean UIDs per patient was 2.0 (\u00b11.6). The most common types of UIDs were omission (73%), incorrect dose (15%) and incorrect administration frequency (11%). More than 60% of these UID presented a potential clinical impact: An adverse effect (high blood pressure, hyperglycaemia) was observed for nine patients and lead to therapeutic optimization and monitoring; 37 UID were considered to have potential clinically significant impact (49%), 11 a potential major impact (15%) and 1 a potential critical impact. Conclusion: These results appear consistent with those reported in literature. Vascular surgeons have appreciated the approach and would like systematic medication reconciliation before surgery. As a major part of admissions were scheduled, we would like to establish the reconciliation before the patient's hospitalization every time it's possible. This new organization should facilitate the care pathway before surgery and decrease preventable postoperative adverse events.",

The objective of this study was to describe the prevalence of DIs at the medical department of \u00c5 lesund Hospital, and to investigate how DIs were managed by clinical pharmacists and physicians. Design: At the medical department, \u00c5 lesund Hospital, clinical pharmacists serve seven out of ten wards, from which patients were included during a five weeks period. The clinical pharmacists selected patients for screening for potential DIs (www.interaksjoner.no) as Int J Clin Pharm (2017) 39:208-341 303 usual (= pharmacist group). Detected DIs were classified according to a predetermined classification system, and it was registered whether the physician implemented suggested changes in prescription. For patients not selected by clinical pharmacists (= non-pharmacist group), a pharmacy student performed the search for DIs. Results: In total 373 patients were admitted. On average, each patient had 1.6 DIs, and 56.6% of the admitted patients had at least one DI. The prevalence of DIs was significantly higher among the 194 patients in the pharmacist group compared to the 179 patients in the non-pharmacist group (median@@@ 1 vs. 0, respectively, p \\ 0.001). The groups differed significantly regarding number of drugs used, age, duration of hospital stay and number of warfarin users. 10.5% of the DIs detected in the pharmacist group were discussed with the physician. The remaining 89.5% were considered not necessary to discuss for various reasons e.g. because they were considered not clinically relevant (30%) or already adjusted for in clinical practice (20%). For 24 DIs the clinical pharmacist suggested a change in prescription, and 20 of these suggestions (83%) were implemented by the physician. Conclusion: Just over half of the patients were selected by the clinical pharmacist for screening of DIs, and the pharmacist seemingly made a reasonable priority of patients with many drugs, old age, a long hospital stay and users of warfarin. Only 1 of 10 DIs was discussed with physicians. This indicated that pharmacists do a considerable work in assessing the relevance of DIs before discussing with the physicians. It also seemed that changes in prescription suggested by the clinical pharmacist were reasonable.",

Nevertheless, the potential severity of such errors led us to implement a failure analysis of the paediatric oncology care pathway in order to identify and prevent potential risks, and secure the paediatric use of oral chemotherapy. Design: We conducted a Failure Modes, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) which is a proactive risk assessment approach. First, process maps were detailed for each step of the oncology care pathway. It was performed by a multi-disciplinary group composed of 2 physicians, 1 coordinating nurse, 2 hospital pharmacists and 1 pharmacy resident. Then, for each step of the medication-use process, the team identified the failure modes, their main causes and effects. Finally, participants rated the expected severity, frequency and detectability for each failure mode, assigning a score on a five-point scale. A Risk Priority Number (RPN) was then calculated by multiplying those three indexes. The risks getting a high RPN were categorized as critical risks and have been the object of safety improvements.",

Most failures were due to prescriptions heterogeneity, lack of clinical information reported on prescriptions, and lack of training of pharmacy assistants in reading oral chemotherapy prescriptions and in mistake detection. Two improvement strategies were implemented. First, physicians' awareness led to the harmonisation of practices and to the standardisation of discharge prescriptions. Then, to enhance pharmacy assistants' abilities, an educational program on oral chemotherapy dispensation was planned.

Traditional hospitalization allows to reconciliation medication but there is not possible for dayhospitalization (patient's hospitalization short time and no outpatient medication prescribe by oncologists). However, lack of communication between health professionals may expose patients to drug-drug interactions (DDI). While DDI between oral antineoplastic and other drugs are well known, there is a lack of knowledge about DDI between parenteral antineoplastic (AK) and other drugs. In this pilot study, we aim to investigate prevalence and characteristics of DDI between AK and other drugs in real life and to propose a pharmaceutical report model to enhance patient's drugs safety. Setting and method: During 6 months, all new oncologic patients (thoracic and digestive) receiving chemotherapy in day-hospital have been recruited by clinical pharmacist. First it was conducted a patient-clinical pharmacist interview and carried out the best possible medication history (BPMH) by contacting at least three different sources of drug information. Then, the BPMH has been confronted with oncologic treatment (including concomitant medications such as like antiemetic) with support at least with two different database of DDI analysis. Finally pharmaceutical recommendations in order to manage potential relevant DDI were reviewed with oncologists then reported and inserted in personal health record (PHR). Main outcome measures: Prevalence and description of potential clinically relevant DDI in an ambulatory oncology population. Results: From November, 2015 to April, 2016 n = 90 oncologic patients were included with following characteristics: mean age of 63.2, sex ratio 2:1, majority of oncologic thoracic localization (56%). Number of oncologic concomitant medications per patient was 3.97 \u00b1 0.94 (mean \u00b1 standard deviation). Patients present an average of 2.2 \u00b1 1.93 comorbidities (excluding cancer) and 5.97 \u00b1 3.76 linked medications per patient. Pharmaceutical analysis revealed 33 potential clinically relevant DDI (0.37 \u00b1 0.97 per patient): 72% of them concern antiemetics (ondansetron and aprepitant): pharmaceutical interventions were formulated (including recommendations to adapt chronic treatment) and 39% of them involved biological monitoring (for renal function, INR, potassemie or magnesemie). Conclusion: Our pilot study confirms high prevalence of DDI between oncologic and non-oncologic drugs. Clinical pharmacy services with BPMH performing and pharmaceutical recommendation appears to be useful to enhance patient' drug safety in oncology dayhospital. We currently are deploying our study in order to convey a pharmaceutical letter to general practitioner and community pharmacist.",

Moreover a loading dose before the administration is required for the antibiotics to prevent from the infratherapeutic period at the start of infusion and limiting the risk of resistance emergence. Long half-life antibiotics and antifungals also require a loading dose to be effective. The aim of this study is to analyse the prescriptions of anti-infective requiring a loading dose in order to develop a tool to help pharmaceutical analysis. Design: A prospective observational study was carried out during 15 days in 16 units. Initially, pharmacists, residents and students were trained (role of the loading dose, drugs concerned). Then, all patients with anti-infective requiring loading dose were included. Some data were collected: weight patient, creatinine clearance, loading dose or not, dose, administration mode, monitoring of steady state concentrations (vancomycin and ceftazidime) and dose adjustment. The results were analysed and compared to bibliographic research before discussion during a multi-disciplinary meeting (pharmacists, infection control specialist and pharmacokinetic specialist). Finally, a list of relevant pharmacist interventions was selected. Results: Out of the 393 patients, 44 were enrolled for prescription of anti-infective requiring loading dose. Twenty-six prescriptions including Vancomycin, 8 Ceftazidime, the others Fluconazole, Caspofungine, Voriconazole and Posaconazole. Concerning Vancomycin, the loading dose was prescribed in 85% of case, monitoring of steady state concentrations was performed in 90% of case and dose adjustment after first dosage was required in 56% of case.

The objective of this study was to investigate if the RASP list (Rationalization of home medication by an Adjusted STOPP list in older Patients), an explicit screening method adapted to the Belgian context, can be used to reduce the number of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) in orthogeriatric patients. Setting and method: Single-centre, interventional study conducted at the orthogeriatric department of the UZ Brussel, a 721-bed university hospital. The RASP list was first applied by a last year pharmacy student to the admission medication of orthogeriatric patients hospitalised in October 2015. After potential adaptations to the medication by a liaising geriatrician, the RASP list was additionally applied by the same pharmacy student to the discharge medication of these patients. Main outcome measures: Detection and reduction of the number of PIMs. Results: In total, 59 orthogeriatric patients, from whom an informed consent was obtained, participated in this study. On admission, a total of 136 PIMs were detected in this population. At discharge, the number of PIMs decreased to 101. The median number of PIMs per patient decreased from 2 (on admission) to 1 (at discharge). This difference was statistically significant (p \\ 0.001; Wilcoxon Signed Rank test). Drugs of ATC class N (nervous system) were responsible for the highest number of PIMs. Conclusion: PIMs can be detected and reduced in the hospital using the RASP list. A structured and collaborative medication review between (student) pharmacists and physicians appears a good approach to reduce the number of potentially inadequate drugs. Nevertheless, more research is necessary to substantiate this further as well as to assess the clinical impact of the findings.",

Feedback from service users (patients and healthcare professionals) was for a more patient facing pharmacy service. This led to a phased installation of remote dispensaries on wards within the hospital to supply medicines. This new and innovative service enabled the supply function to be fully co-ordinated on the ward. This model was initially implemented on 8 wards, which coupled with one-stop dispensing meant 91% of discharges require nothing to be supplied at the point of validation, 100% of discharge prescriptions meeting key performance indicator of being dispensed and ready within 1 h with average turnaround time of 18 min for a discharge prescription and a reduction in missed doses-3.1% in September 2015 to 2.1% in March 2016. This success prompted further installation of remote dispensaries in all clinical areas on site. Design: Implementation included; purchasing hardware, pharmacy labellers, locating appropriate computer terminals and stock cupboards. The main pharmacy labelling and stock control system was fully integrated at ward level, enabling the automatic reordering of replacement stock. Identification of items and quantities to stock for remote dispensaries was also needed prior to role out. There was a need to scope staffing requirements including the redeploying of roles from a main inpatient pharmacy to patient facing areas. Results: Over 6000 items are supplied at ward level each month via satellite pharmacies for all wards, equating to more than 80% of the total dispensing workload for the site allowing for pharmacy staff to be redistributed from dispensary to the ward. This offered the benefit of being more patient facing and supporting other initiatives such as patient counselling and medicines reconciliation. The project has impacted the pharmacists as it has enabled them to focus on clinical aspects of service delivery, including attendance of ward rounds as well as supporting a ward team approach with the pharmacy technician. Results of missed dose audit from June 2016 shows across the site 41% (7) wards scored below the national 1.4% target and (29%) 5 wards had no unintentional missed doses. Conclusion: Ward based dispensing has led to pharmacists and pharmacy technicians being 100% ward based. As a constant presence on the ward, the team offer consistency within the pharmacy service for patients, nursing and medical staff. Impact of pre-discharge planning has been beneficial to nurses, patients and work flow of the pharmacy teams. Ward based dispensing has improved supply at discharge as well as promoting a more patient facing pharmacy service that has seen the pharmacy team instilled as integral to service delivery at ward level.",

Setting and method: During a total of 9 months study period (Period I: February-July 2015, and Period II: November-February 2016), clinical pharmacy postgraduate students followed patients for 2-3 times in a week in different services in hospitals (internal medicine, internal medicine intensive care, infectious diseases, neurology intensive care, paediatric bone marrow transplant/haematology unit, paediatric intensive care, geriatrics and nutrition units) and drug related problems were identified and pharmacists' recommendations were listed. Main outcome measures: Determination and evaluation of drug related problems by pharmacist in hospital. Results: A total of 114 recommendations was provided for 93 patients. Those recommendations were classified as alteration or discontinuation of drug treatment (33.3%), dose adjustment (31.6%), change in drug administration time (14.9%), inadequate treatment (7.9%), healthcare staff training/consulting (6.1%), patient education (5.3%) and error/deficit in therapeutic drug monitoring (1.7%). A majority of recommendations (n = 38) were related with alteration or discontinuation of drug treatment provided mainly in departments of internal medicine (n = 9, geriatrics (n = 7), neurology intensive care (n = 5) and infectious diseases service (n = 5). The following main reason for pharmacist's recommendation was related with dose adjustment (n = 36) which were provided in departments of internal intensive care (n = 16), infectious diseases service (n = 6), neurology (n = 5) and internal medicine (n = 5). Conclusion: Clinical pharmacy practices are being carried out effectively in many services, particularly in internal medicine services, internal medicine intensive care unit and infectious diseases services.

Design: We first planned an investigation of patients with hepatic failure's management, with multidisciplinary experts groups. The study was conducted during one week in post-surgical, gastro-enterology, endocrinology, cardiology, pulmonology, geriatric departments and reanimation care units. A flowchart based on hepatic's biomarkers helped us including patients. Criteria used to assess hepatic impairment could be: a stage C Child-Pugh score, Prothrombin score inferior to 70%, Bilirubin superior to 50 micrograms per millilitres of blood without haemolysis, Aspartate and Alanin Aminotransferases superior to three times the high normal value, and presence of a Vitamin K antagonist interfering with those results. After a review of each included patient's prescription, we checked the major pharmacokinetic elimination pathway of each prescribed molecule (biliary or renal) and if hepatic biotransformation was expected. We also checked if the molecule could cause hepatic side effects. Results: Out of 474 patients, 15 patients were included for liver failure (3.2%) and 4 for a cholestasis (0.8%) mainly in reanimation care units (17.5%) and gastro-enterology (10%). Among the 232 lines of prescribed medicines, the main pharmacological classes encountered were cardiology, (5%) pain (5%), psychiatry (4%), haemostasis (2%) and antibiotics (1%). At the end of the investigation, the expert group decided on the relevant pharmacist interventions. These were based on dose adjustment of anti-infectious, psychotropic drugs, painkillers, oral anti-diabetics, anti-coagulants and corticosteroids. Alternatives are proposed for each class. Conclusion: To conduct a better pharmaceutical analysis, 3 steps are necessary. First, any liver failure or cirrhosis must be detected thanks to the patient's biological results and medical record. Then the patient's prescription can be analysed in order to highlight drugs that need a dose adjustment in a context of hepatic impairment. Finally, the physicist and the pharmacist discuss about dose adjustments or alternatives if presence of contraindication with the drugs prescribed. Soon the designed tool will be available to all pharmacists to harmonize clinical pharmacy practices. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Data regarding adherence rates to oral chemotherapy in lymphoma patients is limited. The aim was to assess pharmacist intervention on adherence to oral chemotherapy in patients suffering from Hodgkin's (HL) and non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). Setting and method: Following ethics approval, 5 HL and 41 NHL patients attending chemotherapy sessions at the Medical Investigations and Treatment (MITU) at Mater Dei Hospital accepted to participate. A questionnaire was compiled to evaluate adherence to oral chemotherapy and to assess pharmacist intervention. The questionnaire was divided into 3 sections (A-C). The same questionnaire was used for both the first interview (t = 0) and after 6 weeks (t = 1). An additional section (D) was incorporated at t = 1 to evaluate pharmacist intervention. Section A consisted of questions regarding patient management of lymphoma. Section B incorporated the Morisky 8-item Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) 1 to evaluate adherence to oral chemotherapy. A total MMAS-8 score of zero indicates high adherence, a score between 1 and 2 indicates medium adherence and a score between 3 and 8 indicates low adherence. Section C consisted of additional questions regarding medication adherence. Between t = 0 and t = 1, pharmacist intervention involved providing each patient with an information leaflet which was developed in this study, an individualised treatment chart and verbal advice. IBM \u00d2 SPSS version 22 and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to assess changes in medication adherence between t = 0 and t = 1. Main outcome measures: Evaluation of pharmacist intervention on adherence to oral chemotherapy in patients suffering from HL and NHL. Results: Out of the 5 patients with HL at t = 0, 3 'never' missed a dose, 1 missed a dose 'once in a while' and 1 'sometimes' missed a dose. For the 41 patients with NHL at t = 0, 38 'never' missed a dose, 2 missed a dose 'once in a while' and 1 'sometimes' missed a dose. The reason for missing a dose was forgetfulness. All 41 NHL and 5 HL patients indicated the haematologist as their source of information about the management of lymphoma.",

Please specify your abstract type: Descriptive abstract (for projects) Background and objective: In May 2015, an activity of medication reconciliation was implemented in the gastroenterology service to carry on the optimization of the medication care of patients due to the recent computerization of their prescriptions. Design: This project, worked in collaboration with the gastroenterology service has been introduced in two medical committees. This activity gathers pharmacy students, the pharmacist, senior and junior doctors. Reconciled patients are selected according to several criteria (advanced age, poly pathological, poly-medicated and those for whom a drug background is difficult to retrieve for the medical team). A minimum of 3 information sources is used for the collection of the drug background. All information are synthetized on a paper, validated by the pharmacist and discussed again with the prescriber. Results: On a 10-month period, 61 patients were reconciled with on average age of 72. The reconciliation is executed on average 2.4 days after the entry in the service. 96.7% of reconciliations are retroactive. The main sources of information used for the collection of the drug background are: in 85.2% of the cases an oral interview with the patient and/or the family; in 82% of the cases the prescriptions, the hometown pharmacist (78.7%) and a medical letter (67.2%). 6.7 drugs are on average on the hospital prescription, and 47.5% (29/61) of the patients are concerned with at least one Non Intentional Divergence (NID). On average there are 1.2 NID/patient and 3.9 Intentional Divergences (ID)/patient. The main types of NID are omissions (44.7%), drug dose errors (19.7%) and errors in administration frequency (11.8%). After the detection of NID, the proposed modifications to the prescribers are accepted in more than 50% of the cases (31/61). The average time of a reconciliation is 49 min. Exchanges on the ID and NID are made with the junior doctors in 85.2% of the cases. Conclusion: Some NID are occurring for 47.5% of the reconciled patients. It is therefore necessary to extend this new activity to reconciliation in other services in order to increase the interception of eventual medication mistakes and allow their correction.

The same adherence scale was administered prior to pharmacist intervention (t = 0) and one-month after pharmacist intervention (t = 1). Pharmacist intervention in the community setting involved dissemination of an informative leaflet regarding CHF and diuretic therapy developed for the purpose of this study. Main outcome measures: Impact of pharmacist intervention on adherence to diuretic therapy in CHF patients. Results: A total of 37 patients were recruited from the hospital setting, of whom 19 were female and 18 were male with a mean age of 80 years (range 67-97 years). On admission (t = 0), 16 patients scored high adherence, 11 scored medium adherence and 10 scored low adherence to bumetanide therapy. Following 2 weeks at the hospital (t = 1), the number of patients scoring high adherence increased from 16 to 31 and the number of patients scoring low adherence decreased from 10 to 1. One-month post-discharge (t = 2), patients scoring high adherence decreased from 31 to 19 and patients scoring low adherence increased from 1 to 3 (p \\ 0.05). A total of 38 patients were recruited from the community pharmacy, of whom 21 were female and 17 were male, with a mean age of 79 years (range 68-97 years). After pharmacist intervention (t = 1), the number of patients scoring high adherence increased from 21 to 23, while the patients scoring low adherence decreased from 9 to 5 (p [ 0.05). Conclusion: Pharmacist intervention in the hospital setting improved adherence to bumetanide therapy. In the community pharmacy setting, there was a slight improvement in the compliance. Pharmacist monitoring and patient support is important post-discharge to ensure patient compliance to therapy. Conclusion: Surveillance of AEDs may be followed by combination of data from adverse drug reaction databases and drug utilisation data from prescription databases. Focus on reporting adverse reactions is important for pharmacists and clinicians, especially for newly approved drugs. Awareness of increased exposure of AEDs to new groups of patients followed by data regarding safety aspects is important and contributes to improved pharmacovigilance. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: The medication review of polymedicated patients is a priority shared among all healthcare professionals. A multidisciplinary approach of these patients is necessary to achieve the best results for their treatment (1) . The objective was to analyse the rate of acceptance of the recommendations made by the Primary Care Pharmacist (PCP) to the General Practitioner (GP) regarding the treatment of polymedicated patients. Setting and method: Setting: A Primary Health Care Centre (27,521 population). Method: A review of the medical records of polymedicated patients (C5 chronic drugs for C6 months). The patients' data were collected from January to June 2015 from their clinical records. Statistical descriptive analysis of data was performed. Main outcome measures: Drug related problems (DRP) for each patient: interactions, contraindications, inadequate dosages, nonindicated drugs, omission of a necessary drug, duplications, medication with low therapeutic effect, and inappropriate medication for patients C75 years old. Treatment alternatives proposed to GP's by PCP were also measured. Results: 34 patients were included in the study (average age: 68.6 \u00b1 11.7, 74% women). Out of the 34 patients, 88 interventions were laid out to reduce the risks of DRP's and to improve the efficiency of treatments. 97% of patients presented some DRP or some intervention to improve the efficiency of their treatment, this mean an average 2.5 interventions for patient. The prevalence of intervention proposals were: non-indicated drugs (28%), interventions for improve the efficiency of treatments (20%), interactions (16%), inappropriate medication for patients C75 years old (10%), contraindicated drugs (9%), duplications (6%), medication with low therapeutic effect (5%), inadequate dosages (5%) and omission of a necessary drug (1%). 97% of these intervention proposals were accepted by the GP: 38% of the accepted proposals were carried out and from the remaining 62, 43.6% led to a prescription from a specialist physician. In 51% of the cases, the patient did not accept the changes. 5.4% were not carried out due to other issues. The main drug related problem was the prescription of non-indicated drugs and the most involved drug was omeprazole. Conclusion: Acceptance by GP's to changes proposed by Primary Care Pharmacists was high. A significant number of changes was not accomplished due to the negative response by some patients and led prescriptions from a specialist physician. The GP greatly values the multidisciplinary aid in approaching the complexity of polymedicated patients.",

It was the aim of this study to analyse the association between influenza infections and the risk of developing incident depression. Setting and method: We conducted a case-control analysis using the large UK-based primary care database Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). This database contains anonymous longitudinal data from primary care. At present, it contains over 100 million person-years of data from some 10million active patients. The study encompassed 103,307 patients below the age of 80 years with an incident major depression diagnosis between 2000 and 2013, and we matched each case to one control patient on age, sex, general practice, number of medical encounters, and years of history in the CPRD prior to the index date. Main outcome measures: Major depression diagnosis was identified by READ-codes based on ICD-10 codes (F32), with a minimum of three prescriptions for antidepressant drugs recorded after the diagnosis. We calculated relative risk estimates of developing depression in association with previous influenza infections, stratified by the number, timing and severity of such events, and we adjusted for a variety of comorbidities, smoking status, alcohol intake, body mass index, use of oral corticosteroids, and benzodiazepines. Results: Patients with a previous influenza infection had an increased risk of developing depression (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.25-1.34) compared to patients with no history of influenza infections. A recent influenza infection recorded within 30-180 days prior to the index date yielded an adjusted OR of 1.57 (95% CI 1.36-1.81), and an increasing number of previous influenza infections was associated with increasing odds ratios (C3 recorded influenza infections, adjusted OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.22-1.81). We did not see any differences in the relative depression risk associated with influenza with regard to a previous influenza vaccination. Conclusion: This study suggests that influenza infections are associated with a moderately increased risk of developing depression. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Warfarin is known for its interactions with many drugs. Elderly patients are particularly sensitive to warfarin interactions. To evaluate the incidence of potential drug interactions when prescribing new drugs to elderly patients on warfarin, a prospective observational study was conducted. Setting and method: Patients on warfarin older than 65 years were included and monitored for 6 months in 4 community pharmacies in Croatia. Data regarding new prescribed drugs was obtained from pharmacy records at the moment of dispensing or by patient selfreporting. The potential interacting drugs were identified using the Lexicomp \u00d2 Lexi-Interact Online software. Only the clinically significant (levels C, D, X of clinical significance as classified by Lexicomp \u00d2 Lexi-Interact Online) interactions were included in this analysis. Main outcome measures: Number of new proscribed drugs, level of interaction with warfarin, mechanism of interactions. Results: We included 157 elderly patients with an average age of 73 years. In the follow-up period, new drugs were prescribed to 54 patients (34.4%). There were 79 prescriptions of new drugs and 57 (72.2%) of those were drugs with a clinically significant interaction with warfarin. There were 39 prescriptions of drugs with level C of interaction (68.4%), and 18 (31.6%) with level D. There were no drug interactions of level X.",

There is a lack of studies describing prevalence of PIM use in Central and Eastern Europe. The aim of the EU COST Action 1402 initiative WG1B (2015 WG1B ( -2018 is to evaluate the registration rates and use of PIMs in Central and Eastern Europe compared to other EU countries participating in this initiative. This abstract describes preliminary findings on different registration rates of PIMs in different EU countries. Setting and method: Researchers/members of the EU COST Action 1402 initiative from the Czech Republic, Serbia, Hungary, Spain, Turkey and Portugal were asked to fill in evaluation tables for the list of 484 PIMs in the period 01-06/2016. Items available in these evaluation tables related to: registration of individual PIMs on the pharmaceutical market, registered doses, drug forms, availability of PIMs on prescription or as OTC drugs, prescription limits and the most frequently used brand names. Data were evaluated using comparative descriptive statistics. Main outcome measures: Overall prevalence of registered PIMs in different countries, cross-country differences in availability of individual PIMs. Results: Of 484 PIMs 81.8% were registered in at least 1 participating country. For the Czech Republic (45.2%), Turkey (48.6%), Spain (52.1%) and Hungary (54.1%) overall prevalence rates of registered PIMs were found to be similar. However, these prevalence rates substantially differed in Serbia (low prevalence-33.9%) and Portugal (high prevalence-68.5%). Substantial differences were found also in the lists of individual PIMs registered in different countries. These lists were similar in Spain and Portugal compared to the Czech Republic, Hungary, Serbia and to Turkey. Conclusion: Although overall prevalence rates of registered PIMs were similar in the majority of evaluated countries (except Serbia and Portugal), availability of individual PIMs was substantially different. Our pilot results confirmed that there are substantial geographical/ regional differences in Europe in the lists of PIMs available (in Spain and Portugal compared to Central and Eastern Europe and compared to Turkey). Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Inappropriate prescribing is a common circumstance found in polymedicated patients. Screening tools for identifying potentially inappropriate prescription (PIP) and pharmacist interventions for evaluating them have been developed to decrease this (1) . The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a pharmacist provided intervention to reduce PIPs in polymedicated patients. Setting and method: The design was a quasi-experimental study focusing on a single group before and after intervention. The study took place from July to December of 2015 at three primary care centres (52,992 population). Polymedicated patients were those using C10 chronic drugs for C6 months. Main outcome measures: Reduction in the rate of PIP per polymedicated patient (number of PIPs found divided by the total number of polymedicated patients) before and after intervention, and the influence of the following variables: type of PIP (inappropriate medication for patients C75 years old, medication with low therapeutic effect, duplication of benzodiazepines (BZD) or angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, combination of anticoagulant and antiplatelet, combination of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with a diuretic and ACE inhibitor, NSAID in cardiovascular disease, chronic antipsychotic in dementia, chronic BZD, or chronic NSAID), gender and age of patients with at least one PIP, and the main prescribed drugs involved in the PIPs based on ATC classification system of World Health Organization. Results: There were 1093 and 959 polymedicated patients before and after intervention, respectively. 71.36% (n = 780, before) and 68.30% (n = 655, after) of the total patients had at least one PIP. The number of PIPs was reduced from 1373 to 1108, while the rate of PIP per polymedicated patient decreased from 1.26 to 1.15, achieving the limit established by the regional health authority. 50.90% (before) and 48.70% (after) of patients had more than one PIP at the same time, up to 5 PIPs per patient. Before and after intervention, more than half of patients with at least one PIP were C75 years old, and approximately 9 out of 10 were C65 years old. Also before and after intervention, 8 out of 10 patients with chronic NSAID and with BZD duplication were women. 6 out of 10 patients with combination of anticoagulant and antiplatelet were men. The main PIPs before and after intervention were, respectively: chronic prescription of BZD (39.77 vs. 37.99% of the total PIP), medications with low therapeutic effect (19.81 vs. 21.30%) and inappropriate medication for patients C75 years old (16.82 vs. 17.42%). The main ATC group involved in the total of PIPs was drugs for the nervous system, and the five most prescribed drugs were all BZD (lorazepam being the first). Conclusion: Pharmacist provided intervention was able to reduce PIP in polymedicated patients. Gender, age and ATC classification of drugs involved were factors in the PIPs. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Up to 10% of women are exposed to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during pregnancy. Information on their effect on birthweight and gestational age remains conflicting. The aim of this sibling-controlled prospective cohort study is to address shared genetic and family-level confounding to investigate the effects of prenatal SSRI exposure and maternal depression on birthweight and gestational age. Setting and method: We used the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) and the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN). Our study population consisted of 27 756 siblings; 194 were prenatally exposed to SSRIs and 27 500 were unexposed to any antidepressant medication. Random and fixed effects analysis with propensity score adjustment was used to evaluate the effects on birthweight and gestational age. Main outcome measures: Birth weight. Gestational age. Results: SSRI exposure during two or more trimesters was associated with a decrease in birthweight of 205 g [95% confidence interval (CI) 372 to38] and a decrease in gestational length of 4.9 days (95% CI9.1 to1.4). Neither maternal SSRI use in one trimester, lifetime history of major depression nor depressive symptoms during pregnancy were associated with these pregnancy outcomes. Conclusion: Prenatal exposure to SSRIs during two or more trimesters may decrease birthweight and gestational length. Our results indicate that neither maternal depression nor shared genetics and family environment fully explain this association. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: The Drugs Burden Index (DBI) is a tool to evaluate the burden of medications with anticholinergic and sedative effects and this exposure has been associated with poorer physical and cognitive function in older people. Objectives were; to determine the cumulative burden of anticholinergic and sedative medicines in older adults with intellectual disability (ID) using the DBI, to examine the relationship between DBI score with demographics and comorbidity. Setting and method: Data from Wave 2 of the Intellectual Disability Supplement to the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (IDS-TILDA), a nationally representative study of ageing people with ID in Ireland. DBI scores were calculated for all participants with available medication data (n = 677). Bivariate associations between DBI and demographic and clinical characteristics were examined with a significance level of 0.05 Main outcome measures: DBI scores of participants categorised into low (0), medium (0-1) and high (C1). DBI score categories were related to demographics, cognitive effects and to a modified Functional Comorbidity Index (FCI), which is associated with physical function in older adults. Results: Of 677 participants, 95.1% (644) had DBI exposure; 51.3% were exposed to any anticholinergic medication, 32.1% to any sedative medication; mean number of DBI medications 2.91 (\u00b11.68), mean DBI score: 1.30 (\u00b11.24). 145 (21.4%) participants had DBI score 0, 165 (24.4%) 0-1, and 367 (54.2%) C1. Antiepileptics accounted for the greatest contribution to cumulative score (27.6%), antipsychotics (25%) and antidepressants (14%). There was no significant association between higher DBI score and sleep difficulties (p = 0.135). There was a significant age gradient associated with higher DBI score (p = 0.016) and significant association between higher scores and increased comorbidity scores; mean FCI of 3.28 in those with DBI C 1, 2.73 in DBI 0-1 and 2.35 in those with DBI 0. Conclusion: Cumulative exposure to sedative and anticholinergic medicines was high in older adults with ID. Higher DBI scores were associated with higher comorbidity and associated poorer physical function.",

Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: To assess the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions used for urinary tract infections (UTI) in the elderly. Setting and method: We included patients aged 70 years and older, hospitalized in the geriatric department and for whom a urine culture was performed between March and May 2016. A prescription was qualified as inappropriate: when the antibiotic prescribed was not the narrowest compared to the culture result, or when there was a contra-indication, or when the treatment duration was shorter or longer than recommended. Prescriptions were consistent with the guidelines when they were identical to those adopted by the French Society for Infectious Diseases in December 2015. Main outcome measures: Appropriateness of antibiotic prescription (type and duration) Results: 47 elderly patients were included (women: 74.5% (n = 35), mean age: 85.9 years). 68% of antibiotic choices were appropriate and 64% of treatment durations were consistent to the guidelines. Urinary clinical signs were mentioned in the medical files for 29.8% of the cases (n = 14). 28 patients received an empirical antibiotherapy (59.6%). 70.2% (n = 33) of urine cultures were positive with bacteria, Escherichia coli being the most prevalent (n = 18). The urine culture results led to a change in antibiotics for 66.7% of the cases. For cystitis, 53.8% of the antibiotics chosen were appropriate (n = 7). The main reasons of non-conformity were the lack of deescalation (to amoxicillin or pivmecillinam), and the prescription of ciprofloxacin when the bacteria was in vitro resistant to other fluoroquinolones. The average duration of effective antibiotherapy for cystitis was 9.3 days (appropriateness: 53.8% (n = 7)). For pyelonephritis, 88.9% of the antibiotics chosen were appropriate (n = 8). The average duration of effective antibiotic treatment was 10.1 days (appropriateness: 77.8% (n = 7)). 40.4% of the patients had a transurethral catheterization (n = 19). Another infection was diagnosed for 48.9% of the patients (n = 23). Conclusion: According to these results, it appears important to reemphasize to the prescribers the guidelines around the UTI diagnosis and treatment in order to improve the prescriptions appropriateness in elderly patients. It is particularly necessary to promote the de-escalation of antibiotherapy (with pivmecillinam for example which has recently become available in our hospital) and to insist about the recommended durations of treatment. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: To measure the use of potentially inappropriate medications (PIM) in the general elderly population several criteria lists exist, e.g., Beers criteria. Last year, a set of explicit criteria for assessing pharmacologically inappropriate medication use in nursing homes was developed; the Norwegian General Practice-Nursing Home criteria (NORGEP-NH). The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of PIMs in nursing home patients using this new assessment tool. Furthermore, we studied possible associations between the use of PIMs and factors like gender, age, geographical area and the number of drugs used. Setting and method: Cross-sectional study comprising 103 nursing home patients from two geographical different regions in Norway; Troms\u00f8 city (n = 70) and Lofoten Islands (n = 33). Data was collected from November 2015 to January 2016. PIMs were identified by NORGEP-NH. We used logistic and poisson regression to examine possible associations between the use of PIMs and factors like gender, age, geographical area and the number of drugs used. Main outcome measures: Number of PIMs per patient, and odds ratios (OR) and marginal effects for associations. Results: Nursing home patient used a mean (SD) of 10.9 (4.3) drugs; 7.2 (3.6) regularly and 3.7 (1.9) as needed. At least 69% of patients used one PIM. Concomitant use of three or more psychotropic drugs was the criterion most commonly identified (33%), followed by the use of antidepressant (26%) and hypnotics (23%). An increasing number of regularly used drugs increased the odds of having PIMs (OR: 1.74), as well as it lead to 0.18 more PIMs per extra drug used. On average, patients C80 years had 0.46 fewer PIMs than patients \\80 years.",

Our results confirm that nursing home patients often use potentially inappropriate medications. This is an area where further work is necessary, not to measure the prevalence of PIM, but to develop interventions in order to prevent PIMs from being used. PE020: Use of pharmacy dispensing data to measure adherence and identify nonadherence with oral hypoglycaemic agents Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: A framework for calculation of adherence for oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHAs) based on data from health-insurance claims is available. Pharmacy dispensing data aid identification of nonadherent patients in pharmacy practices. However, use of these data for calculation of OHA adherence requires additional methodological categories. We examined the impact of different methodological choices on estimation of OHA adherence using pharmacy dispensing data. Setting and method: A framework for adherence calculation for pharmacy dispensing data was developed from health-insurance claims. A basic scenario was developed from 16 methodological categories. Consequences of choices for different parameters within these categories on the scores of the three adherence measures were calculated from dispensing data. Main outcome measures: For OHA use between July 2013 and July 2014, three adherence measures were calculated: (1) average medication availability (AMA); (2) mean rate of adherent patients with an AMA C80% (MRAP80); (3) Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease usually affecting young adults and impacting on patient's quality of life. Although many biological agents (BAs) have been approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe UC in patients who have responded inadequately to conventional therapy, the selection of BAs is controversial due to the lack of head-to-head trials. Indirect economic comparisons of these costly drugs are available from National Healthcare perspectives that are not the Italian ones. Therefore, the objective is to evaluate cost-utility of BAs for the treatment of refractory moderate-to-severe UC both in Italy and in the Lombardy Region. Setting and method: A Markov model (considering 3 transition states: remission, clinical response, relapse) was constructed using the software R 3.3.1 markovchain-package to evaluate incremental cost-utility ratios (ICUR) of adalimumab, infliximab, infliximab biosimilar, golimumab and vedolizumab treatments of patients over a ten-year time horizon from the perspective of the Italian (N) and Lombardy Region (R) healthcare system. Clinical parameters were derived from clinical trials. Costs (which have been actualised-1.5%) were obtained from the National database and Regional public tender. Utility was expressed as QALY (Quality Adjusted Life Years). Main outcome measures: ICUR. Results: Costs per treatment were different from a N and R perspective (adalimumab -55%; infliximab -16.7%; infliximab biosimilar -29.6%; golimumab -9.6%; vedolizumab -10%). Direct healthcare costs (treatment cost, visits, lab tests, hospital admissions) were calculated over 10 years of treatment per patient: adalimumab (N: \u20ac114,226.70, R: \u20ac68,314.12, -40.2%), infliximab (N: \u20ac130,594.90, R: \u20ac103,081.00, -21%), infliximab biosimilar (N: \u20ac110,437.80, R: \u20ac78,852.03, -28.6%), golimumab (N: \u20ac118,602.10, R: \u20ac96,922.20, -18.3%), vedolizumab (N: \u20ac113,851.80, R: \u20ac102,932.20, -9 .6%) with associated QALY respectively of 6.68, 6.66, 6.66, 6.70, 7.02. From a N perspective, infliximab biosimilar was dominating compared to all other treatments. The ICUR of vedolizumab/infliximab biosimilar was \u20ac9483.33 for 10 years (willingness to pay (WTP) \u20ac948.33/QALY). From a R perspective, adalimumab was dominating compared to all other treatments. The ICUR of vedolizumab/adalimumab was \u20ac101,817.88 for 10 years (WTP \u20ac10,181.78/QALY). Conclusion: National and Regional CUA produced different results. As Regional price discounts can occur, local analyses are needed to estimate the economic impact of therapies to ensure optimal choice. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Automated dispensing systems (ADS) have been implemented to reduce overall medication errors related to picking, preparation and administration of drugs. Costs of drug storage between ADS and classic dispensing system (CDS) had not been yet performed in France. Our objective was to assess economic impact of ADS compared to CDS. Setting and method: Retrospective quasi experimental study was conducted in 2 university hospitals in 2015, one with ADS (800 beds, 43 ADS) and one with CDS (600 beds, 31 CDS (17) for ADS and 53 (15) for CDS (p \\ 0.001). Mean number of costly drug per system was 3 for ADS and 1 for CDS. The global stock value in the wards was 205,915\u20ac in ADS and 54,908\u20ac in CDS representing respectively 14.5 and 6.1% of total pharmacy stock value. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that despite the same storage capacity, ADS allow the storage of more expensive drugs such as innovative drugs fully reimbursed up to national reimbursement prices, due to the lower risk of pilferage. This preliminary study was focused mainly on stock value. Subsequently, another study is conducted to evaluate cost of these two drug storage systems, satisfaction of pharmaceutical technicians and nurses and time allowed for systems reloading. Please specify your abstract type: Descriptive abstract (for projects) Background and objective: In France, pharmacists are not entitled to substitute an original biological drug with its biosimilar, due to specific issues of efficiency, safety, and patient monitoring. Our hospital referenced a biosimilar of infliximab on 6 January 2015. According to the French Medication Safety National Agency's recommendations, it has been decided that na\u00efve patients would be treated with biosimilars, and changes between specialties would be proscribed. The objective is to compare prescribing practices between infliximab and its biosimilar, 1 year after its introduction.",

Regional and national infliximab consumption between January 2015 and February 2016 were used to compare the practices of our hospital with other hospitals. The past and future savings were estimated from repayments data of the regional health agency. Results: Infliximab was administered to 633 patients, of which 201 (32%) were naive. 111 patients were treated with biosimilar (i.e. 17.5% of all patients), of which 97 were naive. In the end, nearly 48% of naive patients actually received the biosimilar and 2.5% of patients treated with infliximab switched specialties during treatment. In 80% of cases, biosimilar prescriptions were consistent with the recommendations (vs. 94% for infliximab). In 79% of cases the off-label prescriptions of the biosimilar were explained in the patient record (vs. 75% for infliximab). In February 2016, the share of biosimilars was 14% in France, 12% at regional level and 15% locally. In 1 year, infliximab and its biosimilar's consumption in our hospital have increased by 12% in quantity and only 2% in expenditure (+\u20ac 6 M expenditure). Negotiating a lower purchase price and costs has enabled the hospital to save \u20ac 137,629 (vs. \u20ac 182,961 during the previous year). Because of the decline of refund rates, the gains would have been zero without using the biosimilar but \u20ac 377,172 if it had been prescribed to every naive patient. Conclusion: Current data from the literature on security and effectiveness of infliximab biosimilars are very reassuring and the French Medication Safety National Agency doesn't exclude the possibility of changing specialties during treatment. In our hospital, there is room to improve the efficiency of treatment with infliximab. Feedback on prescribing practices will be given to prescribers and a campaign to widespread prescriptions of biosimilars will be made. The arrival of biosimilars on the market is a real economic opportunity for hospitals, which are increasingly financially constrained in particular by the arrival of therapeutic innovations which are more and more expensive. Setting and method: The study used Health claims data on prescription PPIs from 1st January 2011 to 31st July 2014 obtained from the Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia. To assess medicine use and costs before and after TRP implementation data were aggregated into four periods: Jan-Dec 2011, pre-baseline period; Jan-Dec 2012, baseline period; Jan-Sept 2013, transition period between announcement and introduction of TRP; Oct 2013 to Jul 2014, period after TRP enforcement. Main outcome measures: Medicine costs; defined daily doses (DDDs) dispensed per 1000 inhabitants per day; market share; Herfindahl-Hirschaman index (HHI); number of active substance switches; number of exceptions when medicine is fully reimbursed since physicians may choose option ''not to switch medicine'' when adverse consequences are predicted. Results: Average monthly cost of PPIs declined from \u20ac 1,350,289 in pre-baseline period to \u20ac 800,125 in period after TRP introduction although the consumption increased from 52.4 to 55.2 DDDs/1000 inhabitants/day. Cost of PPIs decreased the most in baseline period (26%), however TRP induced 9.5% cost reduction compared to the transition period. The reference pantoprazole was market leader already in the transition period, but its use increased significantly after TRP introduction and represented 51% of total PPIs consumption. Manufacturers' market shares were constant before TRP, whereas TRP caused decrease of the largest market share for 5%. Still, this resulted in the minor market concentration change; HHI was on average 0.351 before and 0.307 after TRP introduction. Further, at least one active substance switch was detected in approx. 15 and 21% of patients before and after TRP introduction, respectively. Similarly, the proportion of exceptions when medicine was fully reimbursed increased from 6.7% in transition period to 23.7% in period after TRP introduction. Conclusion: Enforcement of TRP for PPI contributed to approx. \u20ac 1 M annual cost savings. From the payer's perspective the new policy was proven to be effective in reducing pharmaceutical expenditure; however TRP also affected physician prescribing pattern and use of PPIs.",

To ensure better availability, offsite-stocks at critical points are required (emergency unit, intensive care unit, etc.). However, this management system increases the risk of economic loss and alteration of the quality due to expired products. In this context, we carried out an optimization of the supply and management system of the AHF. To identify critical points of the supply and management system and to implement improvement solutions. Design: A multidisciplinary working group belonging to a Regional Management Centre of Haemophilia was set up. Two lines of improvement were discussed: i) optimization of stocks ii) optimization of the supply system. Results: The optimization of stocks has led to the modification of the threshold of the lowest stock (LS) for 19 AHF out of 38. In 70% of cases, this stock modification has exceeded 15%. The overall cost of LS has been reduced by 15.0% (83,000 \u20ac) for the general stock at the central hospital pharmacy (HP) and by 8.5% for offsite-stocks (20,000 \u20ac). The AHF mainly involved in this reduction was FVII 5 mg (27,000 \u20ac), then followed by the strengths of 2 mg and 1 mg (13,000 \u20ac for each). In order to improve the AHF management, several propositions have been implemented: (1) developing an online, easily accessible and monthly updated spreadsheet that displayed several accurate data such as the shortest expiry date and the storage location. This operative tool is shared between all pharmacists involved in AHF management in order to facilitate a stock rotation and decrease economic losses, (2) regular reminders to physicians and health care staff concerning the guidelines for inventory management and the importance of checking the drug expiry date, (3) presentation of the financial results and raising awareness on AHF costs to the medical consultant[PPIP1] and (4) optimizing stock distribution based on consumption on the different hospital sites for better patient care management (PCM). Conclusion: This optimization of stocks and improvement of the supply chain have led to a direct cost saving of 83,000 \u20ac. However, a more accurate assessment has to be performed to quantify the direct and indirect impact on PCM and cost saving. This work has been done in a context of a sharing operative network at a regional level. The aim of such project is to share, to optimize and to improve practices, knowledge, human and medical health resources at a widespread level to enhance the security and quality of health services and to promote cost and time saving.

Please specify your abstract type: Descriptive abstract (for projects) Background and objective: Good practice about medicines imposes to Health Institutions a close monitoring of prescriptions, especially off-label prescriptions. Patient care should take into account clinical profile, respect of guidelines and health expense control. We report here a case highlighting the significant role of the clinical pharmacist in care units to ensure medication good use in a Castleman syndrome, a rare disease due to Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) and associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Design: Case report. Results: Our patient, a 49 years old man (creatinine clearance rate (CrCl): 95 mL/min), was diagnosed with HIV infection in February 2016 (CD4 at 160UI/L), leading to introduce a therapy by Emtricitabine-Tenofovir, Darunavir, and Ritonavir. The evolution was hampered by repeated episodes of acute renal failure (ARF; CrCl: 21 mL/min) and pancytopenia (hemoglobinemia at 8.6 g/dL, leucopoenia at 3.3G/L, and thrombopenia at 55G/L). Because of HHV8 blood PCR at 30 000copies/mL, transient crises with pancytopenia, ARF, and HIV infection, a diagnostic of Kaposi Sarcoma Herpesvirus (KICS), an atypical Castleman syndrome, was retained. Given the lake of data in literature for this rare disease, a multidisciplinary team (medical specialists and clinical pharmacists) was gathered to choose an appropriate therapeutic strategy. Treatment regimen consisted of: Day 1, intravenous etoposide at 250 mg; Day 4, rituximab at 375 mg/ m 2 ; following one week later by rituximab 1 day and oral etoposide at 250 mg the day after.",

Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: The Maltese Government launched the HPV vaccination scheme in 2013 and the National Healthcare System (NHS) has since provided the Cervarix \u00d2 vaccine free of charge to girls aged 12. The aim of this study was to assess the cost of the administration of HPV vaccines in the healthcare system of Malta. This study was based on the scheme provided by the NHS. The number of girls born per year was used to estimate the annual cost for vaccinating 12 year old girls, based on the wholesale price and tender price respectively. The estimated yearly cost using the wholesale price was approximately \u20ac547,000 while the average estimated cost based on the tender price was approximately \u20ac157,000. This signifies that cost savings based on the tender price compared to wholesale costs were of approximately \u20ac390,000. The cost for the cohort who completed the three dose schedule using the tender price on average was of \u20ac171,000 per year. This result proved to be more than the anticipated cost. A reason for this could be that the number of girls aged 12 increased possibly due to an influx of immigrants. Including boys in the vaccination scheme would increase costs by an average of \u20ac165,000 per year. Conclusion: This study shows that procuring branded vaccines using the tendering process reduces expenditure for the Government and the tax payer. Wholesale prices were found to be more expensive than tender prices. This proves that the tendering system in Malta is a potent system with many advantages for the tax paying public. The impact of the tendering process must therefore, be safeguarded. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: With the old age, presence of comorbidities, and overcrowding in mass gatherings such as the annual Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, there is a high risk of spreading infectious diseases among pilgrims and then within their country of origin. Knowledge and application of hygiene principles in such an environment is therefore important to reduce the transmission of infectious diseases. Up to date, there have been no studies to evaluate pilgrims' knowledge, attitude and practices toward MERS-CoV during the annual Hajj pilgrimage in order to see whether there is a need for these aspects to be improved. Setting and method: A cross-sectional survey study was conducted with a convenience sample of 257 participants. Participants were pilgrims, aged over 18, and able to speak Arabic or English. A selfadministered structured questionnaire was distributed during Hajj season in Mecca. Descriptive and multiple linear regression analysis were used in data analysis. Main outcome measures: Assessing pilgrims' knowledge, attitude and practices regarding MERS-CoV. Results: Two hundred and fifty-seven participants completed the study, 80% of whom were female, and the median (IQR) age was 35 (24.5-43.5) years. Pilgrims had moderately correct knowledge and accurate attitudes towards MERS-CoV with median scores of 5 (IQR 4-7) and 6 (IQR: 5-7) respectively. They were less educated about management (80%), hallmark symptoms (77%), high-risk individuals (45%) and source of coronavirus (38%). Almost 40% of participants showed a negative attitude towards the use of protective measures such as avoiding food prepared under unsanitary conditions and contact with live animals. Some participants (30%) were unable to comply with hygiene practices, particularly washing hands with soap and water or disinfectant after sneezing/coughing and wearing a face mask in crowded areas. Educational level and employment status were significantly associated with knowledge whereas gender and age were significantly associated with attitude and practices respectively (P \\ 0.05). The correlation between knowledge, attitude and practices was significant (correlation coefficient: 0.207; P \\ 0.05). Better knowledge was found to be a predictor for positive practice. Conclusion: These findings aided in the assessment of the adequacy of current pilgrims' educational measures. They will also provide insight when designing future interventions to promote specific messages to improve knowledge, change attitude and improve practice regarding MERS-CoV. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes significantly increased in the paediatric population, which is affected by obesity worldwide. Today, type 2 diabetes accounts for 45% of all cases of new-onset diabetes in adolescents. Preventive health care particularly taking place at community pharmacies may involve risk assessment for the children and the adolescents, early referral for seeking relevant medical care and patient education on healthy lifestyle choices. The aim of the study is to conduct a type 2 diabetes risk assessment program for the kids B18 years of age of whose parents visited the community pharmacies involved in the study and also to identify the behavioural parameters that might be associated with this risk.",

All patients with kids aged B18 years who visited the study pharmacies during one-week period were informed about the study and invited to participate in the study. Patients who gave their informed consent were included in the study. All data were provided by the parents. Demographic data, height and weight of the kid, as well as data regarding the behavioural features (eating habits, exercising, time spent in front of a screen, etc.) of both the children and the parents were collected using standardized forms. Type 2 diabetes risk test consisted of 8 questions and identified subjects at risk. The parent of the kid who was identified to have risk for type 2 diabetes was referred to a physician for further examination. Also, information regarding type 2 diabetes and the importance of preventive measures such as converting to a healthy life-style was provided. Main outcome measures: Main outcome measures were the percentage of kids identified to be at risk of developing type 2 diabetes and the behavioural parameters associated with type 2 diabetes risk. Results: The study involved 212 subjects. Of the subjects 26% were identified to be at risk of type 2 diabetes. More girls than the boys had the risk (36 vs. 9.3%). Those with type 2 diabetes risk were older, taller, heavier and had higher body mass index. They were spending more time in front of a screen (TV, PC, tablet, smart phone); 22.6% were spending more than 6 h a day. Although the kids' eating habits were similar for those with and without risk, the parents' of the kids with risk ate out more frequently, consumed rice, pasta and pastry more frequently. Both the kids with risk and their parents exercised more regularly and frequently. Conclusion: This study shows that pharmacist have a vital role in identifying children and adolescents at risk for type 2 diabetes; thus at early management of this condition. Identifying and addressing the behavioural parameters associated with the risk will be helpful in lifestyle modification interventions.

Design: A software is available on the intranet website of the institution, to enable health professionals to report ADE. The drug and medical devices commission (COMEDIMS) of the hospital, centralizes these statements and always makes a multidisciplinary and overall analysis of the event, using a collection sheet which is based on the PDCA model (Plan, Do, Check, Act). It proposes the nursing and medical teams axes of improvement. Results: In 2015, only 48 ADE were reported and analysed by the COMEDIMS, including 20 from the paediatric centre (44%), particularly sensitized to this issue. Health professionals are divided as follows: healthcare executives (60%), nurses (23%), pharmacists (11%), residential students (2%), doctors (2%) and others (2%). The main impacted steps of the drug circuit are: administration (62%), prescription (27%) and the use or implementation of a sterile medical device (4%). Identified causes include related following factors: operational tasks and procedures (37%), health professionals (31%), work environment (13%), organization and management (7%), drugs or associated medical devices (5%).",

In January 2016, the COMEDIMS decided to broadcast a communication campaign to promote ADE reporting, on the hospital website via the intranet. Three months after the release, this document was viewed 1059 times, and the number of reports increased by 229% compared to the same period in 2015. Conclusion: In front of the low number of returns of adverse drug events, and relying on the charter of non-punishment, the COME-DIMS wants to increase health professionals' awareness. In our hospital, where e-learning about drug-related iatrogenesis is already available, the communication campaign with poster and analysis of adverse events seems to be a useful complementary tool to enhance awareness of medication safety concerns. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: The migration of modern social networks to the internet has facilitated the transition of traditional pharmacy networks online. The ubiquitous nature of social media (SoMe) combined with merging of personal and professional personas have led to organisations publishing guidance on online behaviour and responsible use of social media. The research to date on the use of social media as a support for professional practice in general is limited. As the pharmacy profession evolves to embrace the technologies which underpin core services and mainstream online daily social activities, it is important that research tracks and evaluates its use and impact within the profession. The objective of this research was to explore and describe how and why pharmacists interact with hosted networks on social media. Setting and method: Two one-hour online hosted micro-blogging Twitter chats were held in December 2015 via the #WePh network. Topic guides were developed around 'Exploring the use of Twitter and WePharmacists' in line with the WeNetwork guidelines (#WeCommunities), informed by existing literature, discussion with the #WePh moderator after review by an expert panel. All research was carried out in accordance with university governance processes and Association of Internet Researchers guidelines. Themes were inducted from analysing the textual content of the chats using the topic guide as a framework. The research was approved by the School of Pharmacy and Life Sciences Ethics Committee. Main outcome measures: Tweets per chat Results: Each of the chats had over 2 million impressions with participants representing international pharmacy practice. Themes of e-professionalism and online privacy emerged as concerns; however, the benefits included using social media for education, networking, support mechanisms and career development. Tweets highlighted personal experiences of 'trolling' (angry, offensive behaviour) and the effect on user interaction with social media. Twitter was also recognised as a career development tool and, in particular, collaborative outcomes around mentorship networking early career pharmacists with more experienced colleagues. Conclusion: Results support the responsible use of social media as a force for inclusion, breaking down geographical barriers in support of pharmacy practice. Further research is underway including a systematic review of guidance on the use of social media by registered healthcare professionals. ",

With early treatment, life expectancy can be increased and the incidence of longterm complications and health costs reduced. Community pharmacies may be able to help uncover undiagnosed diabetes, but being diagnosed with diabetes can lead to strong emotional reactions, and how the diagnosis is given may influence the experience. The aim of this study was to explore how Norwegian people living with type 2 diabetes (T2D) experienced being diagnosed, and what led up to the diagnosis. In addition, their attitudes towards a planned community pharmacy service to identify undiagnosed T2D was investigated. Setting and method: Three focus group interviews with people with T2D were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide. Eleven participants were recruited through a course about type 2 diabetes. The interviews were audio-taped and transcribed in modified verbatim form and analysed in accordance with Malteruds principles of systematic text condensation. The study was approved by The Norwegian Data Protection Authority, and did not require approval from the Regional committee for medical and health research ethics. Main outcome measures: How people with T2D describe their experiences of being diagnosed with T2D, how the disease was revealed and reactions towards using community pharmacies to perform risk assessment for T2D. Results: None of the participants were diagnosed due to their own suspicion of having diabetes. Some saw their doctor because of unspecific symptoms such as fatigue and thirst, and were thereafter diagnosed with T2D. Others were diagnosed through a routine checkup. Negative reactions like shock, discontent and denial were commonly used to describe the experience of being diagnosed with T2D, but some participants also expressed a more relaxed attitude, especially if they were familiar with the disease through family members. Participants expressed a strong wish for more and better information following the diagnosis. ''It's a jungle out there'' was used to describe how difficult they felt it was to find trustworthy and understandable information. They described change of lifestyle, side effects from drug use, and stigma as challenges following the diagnosis. While in general the participants were positive to using community pharmacies to uncover undiagnosed diabetes as this could help reduce the number of people who were undiagnosed, some were sceptical. They questioned whether the pharmacy staff had the necessary competence of the for this type of service, and saw it as the doctor's responsibility.",

Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a disruptive and unpleasant side effect in chemotherapy patients and is associated with decline in patients' quality of life and decrement in the adherence to effective chemotherapy regimens. Setting and method: 100 chemotherapy naive patients were included in this study. consistency with guidelines were assessed according to MASCC/ESMO 2014. FLIE questionnaire was administered to patients before chemotherapy, and 5 days after receiving chemotherapy to assess the difference in the quality of life due to chemotherapy administration. Main outcome measures: Patients were categorized into two groups as consistent with guidelines group (acute (GCGA) and delayed (GCGD)) and inconsistent with guidelines group (acute (GIGA) and delayed (GIGD)). FLIE score differences between the two groups were assessed. Results: The median FLIE score for patients prior to chemotherapy was 126 and a dramatic decline was noticed post chemotherapy (FLIE score 108; p \\ 0.001). The post-chemotherapy score were for nausea and for vomiting (49.5, 63 respectively). Although the FLIE score differed significantly between GCGD and GIGD (p \\ 0.01), these differences were not significant in GCGA and GIGA. Conclusion: The significant drop in FLIE scores in the study (126 pre-to 108 post-chemotherapy) reflected substantial declination in patients' quality of life. The lower postchemotherapy FLIE score of nausea emphasized the negative impact of nausea, and to a lesser extent vomiting on the patients ability to complete normal daily activities such as enjoying meals and maintaining social activities.",

Setting and method: The study was set in community pharmacies. A cross-sectional study, through the use of a questionnaire, was performed to quantitatively analyse whether pharmacists in Malta would be willing to dispense methadone. The questionnaire consisted of 19 questions divided into 3 sections, with each section assessing a particular aspect of community pharmacists' attitudes towards methadone dispensing. Community pharmacies were then chosen via a systematic sampling procedure. A hard copy of the questionnaire, addressed to the managing pharmacist, along with a cover letter, instructions on how the questionnaire was to be returned, and a prepaid self-addressed envelope was distributed via postage to 103 community pharmacies. An online format of the questionnaire was also circulated to 311 community pharmacists through the pharmacy council. Data was analysed using SPSS version 21. Main outcome measures: Community pharmacist's attitudes towards methadone dispensing. Results: A total of 109 responses were obtained and a response rate of 35.04% was achieved. Eighteen percent of the pharmacists (n = 109) who responded to the questionnaire worked in a community pharmacy located in the north of Malta, 24% in the centre, 17% in the south, 8% in the southeast and 4% in Gozo. Thirty-two percent of community pharmacists were willing to dispense methadone to drug misusers. The number of community pharmacists who are willing to dispense methadone increased to 41% if they were provided with appropriate education and support. Twenty-nine percent of community pharmacists were prepared to handle the duty of supervising the consumption of methadone while 86% had never learnt about methadone and its clinical application within opioid substitution treatment. Conclusion: Community pharmacists should be provided with education and training regarding methadone substitution treatment before embarking on a new regionalised methadone dispensing service within community pharmacies. This would allow more community pharmacists to become involved in a new dispensing methadone service.",

Regorafenib is only approved in adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who are previously been treated with available therapies or are not considered suitable candidates to these treatments. Regorafenib is an oral anti-tumor drug that blocks the kinases involved in the tumor angiogenesis (VEGFR1, -2, -3, TIE2), the oncogenesis (KIT, RET, RAF-1, BRAF, BRAFV600E) and the tumor microenvironment (PDGFR, FGFR).In this study, we are reviewed the reports of the patients with colorectal cancer who are been treated with Regorafenib in our hospital and analysed the information in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Regorafenib. Setting and method: Descriptive and observational study about the use of Regorafenib from April 2015 to the present day. The variables studied, obtained from the software applications Archinet and Diraya, were: sex, age, pathology, location of metastasis, posology and adverse effects of Regorafenib, tumor markers (CEA y CA 19.9) before and after the treatment with this drug and the mutational state of KRAS. Main outcome measures: The tumor markers CEA and CA 19.9 only decreased in the 22.22% of the patients after the Regorafenib treatment. Results: Regorafenib was taken by 9 patients (78%men).The average age of these patients was 64.78 \u00b1 8.48 years old. The patients took Regorafenib to treat: metastatic and non-intervened gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) E-IV that progressed with the previous treatment of Imatinib and Sunitinib (11.11% patients), intervened colon adenocarcinoma E-IV (33.33% patients), sigma adenocarcinoma E-IV (33.33% patients) and unresectable and non-intervened rectal adenocarcinoma E-IV (22.22% patients).All patients presented metastasis in different locations on the body: liver (55.55% patients), diaphragm (11.11% patients), intestine (11.11% patients) and lung (44.44% patients).The 77% of the patients started the treatment with 160 mg of Regorafenib, administrated once a day for 3 weeks followed by one week without this drug; while the 22.22% of the patients started the treatment with 120 mg. However, the 33.33% had to decrease the initial dose and the 55.56% of the total patients had to get off the treatment because of the development of side effects. The most frequent adverse effects were: hypertension associated with headache, hyperbilirubinemia, elevation of AST and ALT, intense asthenia. The 66.67% of the patients presents native KRAS. The native KRAS was presented in the 100% of the patients treated with Regorafenib who had an appropriate development of the illness (decrease of CEA and CA 19.9) Conclusion: The decrease of CEA in the 22.22% of the patients and the high development of side effects reveal that Regorafenib has low effectiveness and security in the control of the progression of colorectal cancer.

One of the innovative drugs approved to improve survival in NSCLC is Nintedanib: an inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases, which can be found in some receptors on the surface of cells involves in the growth and spread of cancer cells (''PDGFR'', ''FGFR'' and ''VEGFR''). Nintedanib is not yet marketed in Spain. Hospital pharmacists are responsible for applying this treatment as ''expanded drug'', only after the elaboration of an exhaustive report. In this study, we have reviewed all the reports and classified the information in order to present our clinical practice. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Nintedanib in patients with NSCLC treated in a tertiary hospital. Setting and method: Descriptive observational study of the use of Nintedanib from November 2014 to September 2015. Sex, age, body mass index (BMI), pathology, smoking habits, line of treatment, posology and adverse reactions of the treatment with Nintedanib and tumor markers (CEA an CA 19.9) before and later the treatment with Nintedanib were collected from medical history through Archinet informatic application. Main outcome measures: The tumor marker CEA decreased in 57% of the patients and CA 19.9 no decreased in any patient after Nintedanib treatment. Results: Nintedanib was used in 7 patients (57% men and 43% smoker).The average age of these patients was 58 years old. The average BMI was 28 kg/m 2 (18-50).All patients received Nintedanib together with Docetaxel for metastatic NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology and with non-mutated EGFR and ALK in third line treatments. Posology: all patients started the treatment with Nintedanib 200 mg/12 h from day 2 to day 21 every 3 weeks; but 2 patients had to reduce the initial dose to 300 mg/24 h (1 patient) and 150 mg/12 h (1 patient) because of some adverse reactions. The side effects were: asthenia, diarrhoea, alteration of transaminases, muscle pain and cramps, weight loss and mucositis. Conclusion: The decrease of CEA in 57% of the patients reveals that Nintedanib is effective in controlling NSCLC progression which involves an increase of the survival and the quality of life of these patients.

Flurbiprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, which has been developed as a spray and lozenge to provide targeted relief for the main underlying process responsible for the symptoms of sore throats, inflammation. To study the relief provided by flurbiprofen 8.75 mg delivered as a spray or lozenge, we conducted a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, activecontrolled, single-dose, non-inferiority study. Setting and method: Adult patients with acute sore throat were randomly assigned to take one dose of either flurbiprofen 8.75 mg spray plus a placebo lozenge, or flurbiprofen 8.75 mg lozenge plus placebo spray at 16 sites across Russia. Main outcome measures: Patients rated sore throat relief using the Sore Throat Relief Rating Scale (STRRS; a 7-point scale, 0 = no relief, 1 = slight relief, 2 = mild relief, 3 = moderate relief, 4 = considerable relief, 5 = almost complete relief, 6 = complete relief) at timed intervals throughout 2 h starting from 1 min post completion of first dosing (1 min after administration of the spray, and 1 min after the lozenge had fully dissolved). Adverse events (AEs) were recorded over 2 h post-dose. Results: 417 patients were assessed (n = 205 for spray, n = 212 for lozenge). [90% of patients in either treatment group experienced some relief (a score of [1 on the STRRS) at 1 min post-dose, which increased to 98% of patients by 2 h. 55-60% of patients reported 'at least moderate relief', which is a well-recognised measure of a clinically meaningful effect at 1 min post-dose, which increased to 74-78% of patients by 2 h. Over the 2 h post-dose, a total of 17 drugrelated AEs were reported by 13 patients across both treatments and no severe adverse events were reported. Conclusion: Flurbiprofen 8.75 mg delivered as a lozenge or spray provides fast, clinically meaningful relief from sore throat.",

            "text": "Setting and method: We enrolled 240 patients hospitalized in Clinic of Internal Medicine. Data about patients' medications was collected during patient interview taken by the pharmacists on hospital admission. Pharmacotherapy was analysed using the original protocol developed by Mimica Matanovic and Vlahovic-Palcevski in order to detect PIMs. Main outcome measures: number and type of potentially inappropriate medications, potential clinically significant interactions. Results: The average age of patients was 74 years (range 65-92), and the average number of drugs per respondent was 6.7 (range 1-15). A total of 109 patients (45.4%) were taking at least one PIM. The most common PIM were long-acting benzodiazepines, central antihypertensive moxonidine and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients with hypertension. In the study population, 110 patients (45.8%) have taken at least one combination of drugs that could result in a clinically significant interaction. The most common combinations included application of NSAIDs and antihypertensive drugs or diuretics, concomitant use of multiple medications with effects on the central nervous system and drug combinations that can cause hyperkalaemia. Conclusion: This study revealed the high prevalence of inappropriate prescribing. Clinical application of this protocol could be an effective method for improving and optimizing drug prescription with the aim to reduce the number of side effects and the morbidity and mortality associated with the drug use in the elderly. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: To reduce adverse effects of conventional amphotericin B formulation (deoxycholate or d-AmB) it can be infused in Intralipid \u00d2 (a fat parenteral nutrition), or lipid-based formulations can be used (i.e. amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC), amphotericin B colloidal dispersion (ADCD) and liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB)). Studies evaluating safety profiles present conflicting results. The aim of our study was to gather evidence on nephrotoxicity rates of d-AmB versus lipid-based formulations in immunosuppressed patients susceptible to invasive fungal infection. Setting and method: A systematic review, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the use of d-AmB and amphotericin B lipid-based was performed. A search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Scielo. Results were synthetized and meta-analysis was performed using software Review Manager 5.3. Main outcome measures: Nephrotoxicity rates. Results: Eighteen RCTs were identified (n = 2525 participants). The result from the meta-analysis favours the treatment with the lipidbased amphotericin B formulations (OR: 0.32 (0.25, 0.41) and presents a low heterogeneity (I 2 = 18%). About 22% of patients from lipid-based treatment group presented an increase in serum creatinine of one to two times, which corresponds to stage one or two of acute renal failure (ARF). And 2% presented an increase of tree times in serum creatinine achieving a stage three in ARF (severe) which will require dialysis. While in group treated with conventional formulation Int J Clin Pharm (2017) All of these 23 patients, except one whose treatment adherence was inadequate, were cirrhotic (15/23), liver transplanted (5/23) and/ or presented hepatocellular carcinoma (3/23). 6/23 patients were coinfected with HIV. 8/23 patients (35%) were genotype 3. The total genotype 3 patients treated with DAAs (SVR12/relapsed) were 79, which means that 10.1% (8/79) of all genotype 3 patients has had a relapse.",

The Pharmacist examines drug charts on a daily basis in the Department of Medicine and supports clinicians to improve the appropriate use of antibiotics. Data from 2 time-points were extracted from medical records and collected in an Excel database: T0 (November 2015-January 2016) and T1 (February 2016-April 2016). Main outcome measures: Type of infection, antibiotic consumption data, type of isolated pathogens, patient allergies, Clostridium difficile infection assessment and adverse drug reactions (ADR). Results: 465 records were analysed (T0-T1), 277 of which contained at least one antibiotic prescription. The most frequent infections were urinary tract (27%), respiratory (20%) and gastro-intestinal (14%). Antibiotic therapy was started in 15.9% of cases due to aspecific increase of C-reactive protein (CRP). DDDs were calculated for each treatment and were grouped by type of infection and setting (empiric vs targeted): ceftriaxone, meropenem and metronidazole were the most widely used antibiotics for empiric therapy. At T1, an increase in the use of Piperacillin-Tazobactam instead of Meropenem was observed. The DDD of ceftriaxone for targeted therapies decreased significantly, while an increase was observed for carbapenems, levofloxacin, glycopeptides and, in case of MDR bacteria, tigecycline. Three allergies to antibiotics were reported in medical history. There were 20 Clostridium difficile infections (5 relapses), confirmed by antibiogram. A total of 22 ADRs were identified: 3 of these were related to antibiotics. Conclusion: Antimicrobial Stewardship is a fundamental step to optimise antibiotic management, ensure patient safety and improve quality of care. The results obtained so far demonstrate the added value of a multidisciplinary team in controlling bacteria resistance and in the improving the use of antibiotics.

Setting and method: The forms for medication reviews were developed by the national patient safety campaign in Norway. The nurse/social educator recruited eligible patients, observed them, and ordered test if needed. The clinical pharmacist (JWA) reviewed the medications to identify DRPs. The interdisciplinary case conference took place at the different general practitioners' offices being responsible for the individual patients. The general practitioner, the nurse/social educator and the pharmacist were present, and in some cases, also patients took part. Main outcome measures: An independent researcher (AQM) collected and analysed the data based on the DRP-forms containing information on the prescribed medicines, strength, dose, indication, a description of DRP and suggested interventions to resolve them. Results: Overall, 40 patients with mental disabilities, aged 34-77 years, consented to have a medication review. They used on Int J Clin Pharm (2017) 39:208-341 327 average 12 medicines (range 5-23). The team identified 191 DRP in 39 of the 40 patients (average 4.9, range 0-13). Overall, 79% of all DRP were resolved. For one-third of the medicines, an action was taken to improve the prescribing. The most commonly medicines were analgesics (62%), antiepileptics (58%) and anxiolytics (52%). The most frequent DRPs were unnecessary drug choice (24%), side effects (11%) and too low dose (11%). DRPs were most common in antipsychotics (10%), antidepressants (9%) and anxiolytics (7%). Conclusion: Patients with intellectual disabilities take more medicines and have many DRPs compared to other patient groups. They are also more prone to taking combinations of CNS-active medicines and therefore more at risk of side effects and drug interactions.",

The following variables were collected: age, gender, HCV genotype, degree of fibrosis, patient type (na\u00efve or pre-treated), baseline CD4 count, CD4 levels end of treatment, sustained viral response (SVR) and HCV treatment. Results: 20 patients, of whom 16 were men, mean age 52 years were included. 9 patients received Daclatasvir and Sofosbuvir for HCV, 3 patients had genotype 1a and 1b respectively, 2 patients genotype 3 and 1 patient genotype 4. 8 patients had fibrosis F3 F4, 1. Of the 9 patients 3 they had not received previous treatment (na\u00efve) and 6 had failed to treatment. HIV treatment was modified in 8 patients, 6 patients achieved SVR. The CV was undetectable to HIV treatment change for all patients. CD4 levels increased in all patients at the end of treatment for HCV with a median of 304 cells/ul and 398 at the beginning and end respectively. 2 patients received Ombitasvir/Paritaprevir/Ritonavir and Dasabuvir, who had a genotype 1a. These two patients had received previous treatment and had a F2 and F4 fibrosis. None of them was modified HIV treatment and only one got SVR. CV remained undetectable and CD4 slightly increased after the treatment. 9 patients received Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir, 6 patients had genotype 1a, 2 patients genotype 1b and 1 patient genotype 4. 4 patients had F4 fibrosis and 5 had F3. 9 patients had received previous treatment (na\u00efve). The HIV treatment was modified only in one of the patients, 8 patients achieved SVR. CV increase in 2 patients after the treatment while CD4 followed the trend of increasing. Conclusion: The AAD that caused fewer changes in the HIV treatment were Ombitasvir/Paritaprevir/Ritonavir and Dasabuvir followed by Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir. Sofosbuvir and Daclatasvir present a greater number of interactions with HIV drugs so they behaved to a major change.

Setting and method: Medication for compassionate use was requested for two patients of 78 and 49 years with histopathologic diagnosis of cutaneous metastases of malignant melanoma in the left thigh and left heel in which the lack of response to first-line treatments made to be valued to start with adesleukina intralesional therapy. The first week was infiltrated 3 MU (1 ml) in 5 lesions less than 1 cm, 9MU (3 ml) in the larger lesions and repeating each week until complete remission of the lesions. In the 2nd patient we proceed in the same way but the second week was infiltrated 5MU (8 ml). The following week, infiltrated 9 mml, in 15 metastases and we turn to 2 weekly infiltrations. The response was assessed by clinical disappearance of the lesions treated. Complete response (CR) is defined as a clinical disappearance of lesions and partial response (PR) greater than 50% reduction of the lesion diameter. Main outcome measures: We performed a literature search (Pubmed, Trissel, SPC) for all studies published to determine the standard procedure for preparing and monitoring the MF (processing, preservation, stability, dose and indication). Results: The standard procedure of preparation and quality control was carried out following the rules established in RD 175/2001. It was made in a vertical laminar flow cabinet. The Aldesleukin vial was reconstituted with 1.2 ml API (18 MU/ml) and then diluted with 4.8 ml of a solution of 0.1% albumin, 5% glucose as stabilizer, to avoid aggregate formation, preparing 1 ml syringes (3 MU/ml). It was obtained a homogeneous and clear solution without precipitate or opalescence appearance. Stable 6 days in a refrigerator (2-8\u00b0C), protected from light. Initially patients had approximately a total of 60 injuries. After 2 months of treatment it was obtained a CR of most lesions in the first patient and RP of the second patient injuries. Treatment was well tolerated. The side effects presented were only a flu-like syndrome in the second patient.

Further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of this treatment. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: The safety and efficacy of medications can vary significantly between patients as a result of genetic variability. As genomic screening technologies become more widely available, pharmacists are ideally suited to utilize this tool to optimize medication management. The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of implementing personalized medication services into community pharmacy practice and to assess the number of drug therapy problems identified as a result of pharmacogenomic screening. Setting and method: The study was designed as open-label, nonrandomized, and observational. Two community pharmacies in Toronto, Ontario offered pharmacogenomic screening as part of their professional services program. Prior to initiation, participating pharmacists received structured, comprehensive training in pharmacogenetics. Pharmacists then facilitated voluntary subject enrolment among patients who they believed would benefit from screening and met inclusion criteria. Eligible patients received a simple buccal swab followed by DNA analysis using PillCheck \u00d2 . PillCheck \u00d2 is a genotyping assay that translates genomic data and generates a personalized, evidence-based, report that provides insight into patients' inherited drug metabolic profile. Upon receiving the report, pharmacists invited patients back to the clinic for interpretation of the results. Clinically significant drug therapy problems were identified and recommendations for medication optimization were forwarded to the primary care physician. Main outcome measures: Number of clinically significant drug therapy problems identified by pharmacists as a result of pharmacogenomic testing. Results: 100 patients were enrolled in the study. Average age was 57.4 years and patients were taking a mean of 5.6 chronic medications. Pharmacists cited the most common reasons for testing as ineffective therapy (44.6%), to address an adverse reaction (35.5%), and to guide initiation of therapy (11.8%). An average of 1.3 drug therapy problems were identified per patient. Pharmacist recommendations included change in therapy (57.1%), dose adjustment (14.3%), discontinuation of a drug (7.1%), and increased monitoring (19.6%). Generally, physician feedback was positive but did reveal an opportunity for a broader understanding of the technology. Conclusion: These results highlight the readiness of community pharmacists to adopt pharmacogenetic screening into practice and their ability to leverage this novel technology to positively impact medication management. Community pharmacists are ideally suited to both offer personalized medication services and interpret genomic results.

Please specify your abstract type: Descriptive abstract (for projects) Background and objective: To report the therapeutic management of haemorrhagic rectocolitis onset in a lung-transplanted patient with mycophenolate-induced diarrhoea. Design: Case report. Results: A 54-year-old-man lung transplant patient for alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency in 2003 receiving mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus and corticosteroid developed chronic diarrhoea worsened by sigmoid and cecal necrosis in 2011, and treated successfully by sigmoidectomy. Severe diarrhoea attributed to mycophenolate mofetil reappeared in April 2015, which motivated a switch to mycophenolate sodium. The absence of clinical improvement in June 2015 led to stop mycophenolate sodium and introduce azathioprine at 100 mg/day (absence of mutation for the ThioPurine Methyl Transferase gene). One month later, the patient presented melena, diarrhoea, bloating, nausea, and knee pain, attributed to azathioprine. This latter was stopped and mycophenolate mofetil was rechallenged associated with symptomatic treatment (i.e., diosmectite and loperamide). In January 2016, a colonoscopy, performed in a context of profuse chronic diarrhoea with mucus during 3 months, highlighted haemorrhagic rectocolitis. Therefore, the patient initiated sulfazalasine therapy with no clinical improvement, and then high doses of oral corticosteroids. Because high-dose of oral corticosteroids was not recommended as a long-term treatment, mercaptopurine was proposed as a new therapeutic option.",

However, as the active metabolite of azathioprin, an immunosuppressive drug widely used in transplantation, mercaptopurine has immunosuppressive functions towards T-lymphocytes. After multiprofessional collaboration between gastroenterology, pneumology and pharmacy specialists, it was decided to stop mycophenolate mofetil and introduce mecaptopurine at 1.5 mg/kg/day, as immunosuppressant for haemorrhagic rectocolitis as well as lung transplantation. This unusual lung transplant immunosuppressive therapy, associated with tacrolimus, improved digestive disorders and patient's quality of life. Currently, mercaptopurine is biologically and clinically well tolerated. The dosage of blood residual concentrations of purinethol metabolites (6-thioguanine and 6-methylmercaptopurine) is going to be performed. Conclusion: Immunosuppressive therapy in solid organ transplantation is a real challenge for patients who have comorbidity onset. Despite a lack of data in the literature, a multidisciplinary collaboration based on comprehensive pharmacology skills is essential to choose the best therapeutic option in this type of patients. Please specify your abstract type: Descriptive abstract (for projects) Background and objective: The use of Complementary Medicines (CM) in oncology is the subject of broad but still controversial interest. A large part of patients with cancer uses CM, including complementary drugs, during their treatment period. Indeed, according to different studies, this proportion ranges from 18 to 83%. Importantly, the risk of interaction between CM and anti-cancer drugs is not negligible; hence we need to identify these CM to ensure the security of our patients and the success of their treatment. Design: To achieve this purpose, a monocentric retrospective analysis was conducted with collection of data by pharmacy students during medication reconciliation of hospitalized patients from January to June 2016. Collected data are patients' characteristics, prevalence of CM use and potential CM-anticancer drug interactions. Results: 161 patients were included in the study (91 men-70 women); median age was 65 [34-88 years]. A total of 24.2% (n = 39) were using a least one CM, most frequently homeopathy (62%, n = 24) or phytotherapy (36%, n = 14); some patients were using a combination of two CM (41%, n = 16). CM are mainly used by women in comparison to men (32.9% versus 17.6% and p = 0.025, Chi square test). For phytotherapy, at least 36 different herbs were described by patients and among them the most frequently used were mistletoe (Viscum album), propolis and fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium). Data analysis showed that 23% (n = 9) of patients were at risk of potential CM-anticancer drug interaction. Moreover this risk was increased to 50% if we considered only patients taking phytotherapy. Interactions included pharmacokinetic (15%, n = 3), such as altered hepatic metabolism, and pharmacodynamics ones (85%, n = 17). Conclusion: In conclusion, our work clearly demonstrates that the use of CM by patients is associated with high risk of relevant drug interaction with their anti-cancer treatment. Even if further investigations are necessary to clarify the clinical impact of these interactions, the use of CM must be considered during prescribing process.

The objective of this study was to identify the proportion of real life patients with AF eligible for DOAC therapy, based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria used in the clinical studies and based on the officially approved indications as mentioned in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). Setting and method: Data for this retrospective cross-sectional study was extracted from the UZ Brussel Stroke Registry, containing anonymized data of 2205 patients with a suspected stroke. Characteristics of patients with documented AF were compared with the patient characteristics in clinical trials and the approved indications in the SmPC. Main outcome measures: Proportion of real life patients with AF eligible for DOAC therapy. Results: Data of 468 patients with AF was analysed. Based on the selection criteria of the clinical trials, significantly less patients were eligible for treatment with rivaroxaban compared to dabigatran etexilate (39.3% versus 47.6%; p = 0.010), but not compared to apixaban (45.5%; p = 0.055). Based on the indications and contraindications in the SmPC, significantly fewer patients were eligible for apixaban compared to dabigatran etexilate and rivaroxaban (62.0% for apixaban, 72.9% for dabigatran etexilate and 75.6% for rivaroxaban; p \\ 0.001 and p \\ 0.001, respectively). Significantly more patients were eligible for DOAC therapy based on the indications and contraindications in the SmPC compared to the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the clinical trials (72.9% versus 47.6%; p \\ 0.001 for dabigatran; 75.6% versus 39.3%; p \\ 0.001 for rivaroxaban and 62.0% versus 45.5%; p \\ 0.001 for apixaban). Conclusion: When taking into account the selection criteria from the pivotal clinical trials with DOACs for stroke prevention in AF, less than half of real life patients are eligible for therapy with one of the DOACs.

Setting and method: We run a retrospective observational study in which we included a total amount of 59 patients infected with HCV genotype 1b treated with the new therapies against HCV from February 2015 to December 2015 in a tertiary hospital. The data were obtained through the outpatient dispensing program Farmatools and the review of the medical records from the hospital database, Archinet and Prescription Hepatitis C Portal of the Andalusian Health Service. Main outcome measures: From each patient the following information was collected: sex, age, viral genotype (gen.), Naive/nonnaive, HIV coinfection, presence of cirrhosis, degree of hepatic fibrosis measured by Fibroscan, treatment prescribed and duration, adverse effects, sustained viral response (SVR) and the service that made the prescription. Results: A totality of 59 patients with HCV gen. 1b were reviewed which 64.4% of them were men with a mean age of 58.76 years (range 38-78 years). 21 of the patients were naive and only 2 of them were HIV co-infected, there were a 57.63% of cirrhotic patients. Regarding the degree of hepatic fibrosis, 36 patients had grade F4, F3 grade 13 patients, 8 patients grade F2 and F1 grade 2 patients. The most commonly therapy prescribed was Lepidasvir + Sofosbuvir in 28 patients (14 without Ribavirin and with Ribavirin 14) using a treatment schedule of 12 weeks in 23 of them. The treatment was discontinued in one case because of the adverse effects, achieving SVR in the remaining patients. The combo treatment with Paritaprevir/Ombitasvir/r + Dasabuvir was prescribed in 16 times (10 without Ribavirin and 6 with Ribavirin) choosing only in one of them for a treatment period of 24 weeks. There were no treatment discontinuations and SVR was achieved in all patients treated in this way. 8 patients received Simeprevir + Sofosbuvir for 12 weeks (3 without Ribavirin and 5 with Ribavirin), one patient of the left the treatment due to adverse effects. SVR was found in the remaining patients who completed treatment. Sofosbuvir + Daclatasvir was prescribed to 5 patients, associating Ribavirin in only one case. A treatment duration of 12 weeks was used in 3 patients and 24 weeks in the remaining two. One patient failed RVS without any incidences of adverse effects in any case. Interferon + Ribavirin sofosbuvir + was prescribed to 2 patients in 12-week regimen which was well tolerated achieving SVR. Digestivo service treated the 83% of the total amount of patients. Conclusion: New therapies for HCV have been used in all the treated patients and the older drugs have been relegated. About the effectiveness, SVR was achieved in 98.30% of patients. Regarding the safety, only 2 patients have discontinued the treatment due to adverse effects representing less than 5% dropout rate of the therapy.",

Design: we reviewed all the pharmacogenetic test requests in our Hospital from April 2012 to April 2016, noting which health specialty and for which drug was asked the test. Polymorphisms were genotyped using TaqMan \u00d2 genotyping assays technology by 2 independent laboratories to confirm the results. Results: From April 2012 we were asked for 2208 pharmacogenetic tests from 7 different healthcare specialty areas: Rheumatology (9.78%), Infectious diseases (1.49%), Oncology (3.53%), Cardiology (71.51%), Vascular surgery (5.11%), Neurology (4.53%), Ophthalmology (4.03%); this information was asked about 5 different drugs: Clopidogrel (81.16%), Trastuzumab (3.53%), Ranibizumab (4.03%), Azathioprine (2.99%) and Tocilizumab (8.29%). From all the genotypes, 713 (32.29%) were done after using the drug (study phase) and 1495 (67.71%) were done previous to the use of the drug in daily clinical practice to make a ''clinical recommendation''; from these recommendations 1429 affected to the prescription of Clopidogrel. Conclusion: During the last 4 years we could implement the use of pharmacogenetics in the daily clinical practice in our hospital in 5 different healthcare areas affecting 2 drugs and we started research studies previous to its use on the clinical practice for other three different drugs. Please specify your abstract type: Descriptive abstract (for projects) Background and objective: The Drug Burden Index (DBI) is a tool used to quantify the anticholinergic and sedative burden of medication on an individual. It has been independently associated with poor physical and cognitive performance in community-dwelling older people. Objectives were: to create an inventory of medications used in Ireland with clinically significant anticholinergic and/or sedative activity and to decide upon the Minimum Daily Dose (MDD) for each medication. Design: Medications with potential anticholinergic and/or sedative burden were identified by literature review and examination of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for all medications registered in Ireland. Each medicine was classified as anticholinergic or sedative. Drugs with both anticholinergic and sedative properties were classified as primarily anticholinergic. The MDD, a key component of the DBI score calculation, was selected by reference to the Irish SmPC. Other options which were also considered for this value include the defined daily dose (DDD) of a medication, as available from the World Health Organisation (WHO), and the MDD as outlined in the British National Formulary (BNF). MDDs were decided upon regardless of indication as the lowest effective therapeutic dose as specified in the SmPC for the medication. The final list of medicines and MDDs to be included in the inventory was then defined by consensus of three pharmacists. Results: In total, 383 medicines with potential anticholinergic and/or sedative activity were considered for inclusion. A final list of 258 medications was identified by consensus (117 anticholinergic, 141 sedative). Of these, 128 (50%) were agents which act primarily on the nervous system. The three main therapeutic groups contributing to the inventory of DBI medications were antipsychotics (25 medications), antidepressants (21 medications) and antiepileptics (20 medications). Conclusion: Creation of an inventory of medications with anticholinergic and/or sedative properties, in combination with the individual MDDs, was achieved. This is a useful resource for use in analysis of drug burden in an older population. It could help in both identifying patients who would benefit from medication review as well as analysing population medication data. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Vancomycin is an antibiotic widely used to treat infections such as bacteraemia, infective endocarditis, osteomyelitis, meningitis and pneumonia. Nowadays, optimal trough concentration is stablished between 10 and 15 mg/L to avoid development of resistance or 15-20 mg/L to improve penetration in complicated infections. Some articles 1 have been published explaining the methodology to calculate an expected trough level in steady state. Our aim was to compare the trough serum value estimated by the mathematical method with a two-compartimental Bayesian forecasting model. Setting and method: Observational retrospective study carried out in a tertiary hospital from January to December 2015. Non obese adult patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) \\ 120 ml/min and who have achieved steady state level were included. Vancomycin serum values were measured using a chemiluminescence's immunoassay (CMIA) and Bayesian analysis was performed with Abbottbase PKSystem \u00d2 (Pks \u00d2 ). The statistical analysis was made with MedCalc Software \u00d2 . Bland-Altman plot and Passing-Bablok regression were used to compare both methods. Main outcome measures: sex, age, weight, dose, creatinine, and size were collected from clinical history. Serum trough values (CminR) were collected from CMIA. Trough values were estimated using two methods: mathematical method (CminF) and Bayesian calculations (CminB). Results: 50 patients were included, with a mean age of 61 (\u00b116.17) years. 52% were male and 48% female. They received a median dose per 24 h of 2000 (1000-3000) mg. The mean of CminR was 17.21 mg/L (95% CI 13.86-20.58), CminB 17.28 mg/L (95% CI 13.87-20.69), CminF 18.21 (95% CI 14. 2399-22.1856) . Correlation coefficients (r) comparing both methods were significantly different: r between Cminf and Cminr was 0.75 (95% CI 0.5866-0.8467), while r between Cminb and Cminr was higher: 0.99 (95% 0.9900-0.9968). Bland-Alman plot analysis showed both methods cannot be used interchangeably. The regression equations estimated by Passing-Bablok regression were y = -3.873368 + 1.309775x and y = -0.110207 + 1.003266x. Conclusion: Bayesian method has demonstrated better correlation with real measures than mathematical method. Most part of our patients could be underestimated or overestimated using mathematical methods which could cause toxicity or lack of efficacy, so this method is unsuitable for clinical use. Bayesian estimation remains the best option for optimal dosing of vancomycin.

It is important monitoring digoxinaemia to achieve optimal concentrations and a good clinical response. Further studies are needed to determine the relevance of this interaction in clinical practice. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a humanized monoclonal antibody inhibitor of IL-6 receptor, indicated in combination with Methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients with inadequate response or intolerance to prior therapy. Interleukin 6 is involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis via its broad effects on immune and inflammatory responses. Previous studies have shown that C-allele at the -174G[C (rs1800795) polymorphism is related with a bad response to Tocilizumab (according to EULAR criteria). The aim of our study was to explore the potential role of IL-6 genetic polymorphisms as a predictor of Tocilizumab efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and check this association depending on the genotype. Setting and method: The IL-6 (G[C) (rs1800795) genetic variant was genotyped using predesigned TaqMan \u00d2 genotyping assays technology and analysed on a ViiA7 \u00d2 Real-time PCR system. Main outcome measures: Clinical response was evaluated at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months according to the EULAR criteria. Patients were classified as ''responders'' (Good and moderate response according to EULAR criteria) and ''non-responders''. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v.20. Results: We recruited 163 patients with RA treated with Tocilizumab, these were aged 54.02 \u00b1 11.11 (mean \u00b1 SD), 132 (81%) were women. The mean DAS28 at baseline was 5.66 \u00b1 1.14. Of these 163 patients, the IL-6 G[C genetic polymorphism was significantly associated with ''responders'' at 3 months after the baseline (CC vs non-CC p = 0.039, OR 0.270, 95% CI 0.072-1.005) but not at 6 (p = 0.666), 9 (p = 0.233) and 12 (p = 0.244) months. Conclusion: The IL-6 G[C may be useful as a genetic marker of Tocilizumab efficacy at 3 months. Other polymorphisms, clinical parameters and other pharmacological treatment during the follow-up may be checked about their influence on the response to Tocilizumab.

This prospective study aimed to assess the PK/PD profile of daptomycin in the treatment of neutropenic patients with beta-lactamresistant Gram-positive cocci infections. Setting and method: This substudy was performed in the context of a prospective pilot study on daptomycin versus vancomycin in adult hemato-oncological patients with febrile neutropenia and proven or suspected infection with methicillin-resistant staphylococci or betalactam-resistant enterococci. Patients received daptomycin 6 mg/ kg/day (8 mg/kg/day for enterococci) for C7 days as a 2-min infusion. Main outcome measures: PK analysis using a published non-linear mixed effect model with Nonmem \u00d2 , followed by comparison of parameters with values published for healthy subjects. PD analysis based on AUC/MIC (area under the concentration-time curve/minimal inhibitory concentration). According to EUCAST, an AUC/MIC ratio [438 is required for bacteriostatic effect against staphylococci and [800 for a two-log reduction in bacterial count. For E. faecium, an AUC/MIC ratio of 0.94 has been suggested for bacteriostasis and 4.14 for a 1-log bacterial count reduction. Results: Model-derived mean AUC observed in 13 patients was 539.3 \u00b1 340.1 mg h/l, maximum concentration (Cmax) 88 \u00b1 28 mg/ l, minimal concentration (Cmin) 7.2 \u00b1 6.7 mg/l. Clearance was 0.98 \u00b1 0.36 l/h and volume of distribution at steady sate 11.3 \u00b1 3.3 l, both values found higher than those reported in healthy subjects. All patients (7/7) with a staphylococcal infection achieved AUC/MIC values predictive of bacteriostatic effect on Staphylococci, and 6 out of 7 values associated with two-log bacterial killing. Of note, infection relapse occurred in the only patient with suboptimal daptomycin exposure (AUC/MIC of 580). The PD targets were also reached in the two patients with E. faecium infection. An asymptomatic elevation of creatine phosphokinase was reported in two patients (568 U/L and 218 U/L) with Cmin of 25.7 and 13.7 mg/l, respectively. Conclusion: Daptomycin PK profile in 13 neutropenic cancer patients indicated higher total clearance and volume of distribution, along with lower total exposure, compared to healthy subjects. Despite this, standard dosages allowed attainment of PD targets in 6/7 patients with a staphylococcal infection (two-log drop) and 2/2 with E. faecium infection (1-log drop) . Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Individual clinical response to infliximab can be influenced by their pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity, so therapeutic monitoring of drug levels (TDM) can guide these biologic treatments. The objective was to analyse the suitability of serum infliximab trough levels (SITLs) in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) receiving dose schemes based only on clinical response. Setting and method: Prospective and descriptive study of patients with IBD treated with infliximab and under TDM. Medical records were reviewed. Dose schemes were established according to clinical guidelines (5 mg/Kg every 8 weeks) and optimized based on an index of clinical response (MAYO, PCR\u2026). SITLs (Therapeutic range 3-9 mcg/mL) and anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were measured in all of patients by Elisa (Promonitor \u00d2 ). ADA presence was considered as a therapeutic failure indicator. Informed voluntary consent was obtained from all patients. Main outcome measures: SITLs and ADA. Results: A total of 61 patients, with a median age of 48 years (range ), were included in the analysis. Infliximab standard dose according to clinical guidelines were administered to 39 patients: 46.1% showed SITLs under the therapeutic range (11.1% with ADA). In eight patients with maintained good clinical response, dose decrease or interval elongation had been implemented: 25% of these patients showed SITLs below the therapeutic range (100% with ADA). It had been necessary to increase the dose or shorten the interval in 14 patients due to inadequate clinical response: 28.6% of these patients with SITLs below the therapeutic range (50% with ADA). Conclusion: Optimization based on clinical response of infliximab treatments in patients with IBD is not always an effective strategy, since it leads to a high percentage of patients with SITLs below the therapeutic range and ADAs. TDM together with clinical response should guide the optimization of infliximab treatments. Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: In addition to its anticonvulsive properties, valproate is also used as a mood stabiliser in bipolar disorder and as augmentation treatment of other psychiatric disorders. The unpredictable relationship between dose-plasma valproate concentrations and correlation between concentrations-efficacy suggest therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of plasma valproate concentrations might be useful. The aim of our study was to evaluate the rationale of a new protocol for measuring valproate concentrations and the incorporation of a clinical pharmacist in the process of valproate TDM service, compared to pre-existing standard measuring. Setting and method: In the retrospective study we analysed the process of measuring plasma valproate concentrations at the Department of Psychiatry and at the Unit for Forensic Psychiatry of a large teaching hospital in Slovenia before the enrolment of a clinical pharmacist. For the prospective study we created a protocol for TDM of valproate in adults based on literature research. The protocol included reference range, sampling time, indications for sampling and schedule of other laboratory tests that have to be monitored during valproate therapy. Main outcome measures: Percentage of plasma valproate concentrations in reference range (C trough = 50-125 mg/l) before/after the enrolment of a clinical pharmacist, percentage of measured valproate C trough . Results: In the retrospective study 30 randomly chosen patients with measured plasma valproate concentrations were included (56% male, age 49 \u00b1 15 years, length of hospital stay 56 \u00b1 40 days). Plasma valproate concentrations were measured 5.8 \u00b1 4.4 times per patient, 22% were in the reference range (other 78% subtherapeutic), 3% were drawn at C though , 15.5% were drawn for assessing compliance (nontrough). In the prospective study 19 patients were included (37% male, age 46 \u00b1 16 years, length of hospital stay 36 \u00b1 22 days).",

Conclusion: The inclusion of a clinical pharmacist in valproate TDM service increased the number of valproate plasma concentrations in the reference range by almost 100% and increased the number of concentrations drawn at C trough , when indicated. Including a clinical pharmacist in valproate TDM is beneficial and the new protocol is useful for optimising valproate therapy.",

NOAC use was detected be serum analysis in 11 patients (6.6%; 100% coherent with MR), while 15 patients (9.0%) used warfarin. 7 of the 11 NOAC users (63.6%) had s-concentrations of NOACs above the reference range at admission, and five patients (45.5%) had s-concentrations within the reference range before surgery. Patients using NOAC had significantly longer median waitingtime for surgery than warfarin-users (50 vs 36 h, p = 0.004). Blood transfusions were given to 36.4% of NOAC-users vs 21.4% of warfarin-users (p = 0.651). Mean estimated T of NOACs were 33, 16.5 and 14.5 h for dabigatran (n = 2), apixaban (n = 4) and rivaroxaban (n = 2), respectively. Conclusion: MR is effective in detecting NOAC use in older hip fracture patients, but importantly s-concentrations are higher than expected in this population. This might reflect the significantly longer waiting-time for surgery",

The mobile phase was composed of 0.5% Na 2 PO 4 H 2 O (pH 2.5), acetonitrile, and methanol (55:25:20, v/v/v), which was degassed in an ultrasonic bath prior to use. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min at ambient temperature and sample detection was carried out at 250 nm. Plasma samples were obtained from 11 patients with CML receiving nilotinib treatment. Sampling was performed at the steady state. Blood samples were collected by venipuncture 24 h after oral administration of nilotinib. Plasma was separated by centrifugation at 1900 9 g for 15 min and stored at -40\u00b0C until analysis. Plasma samples (100 lL) were then extracted as described above. The same samples were also sent to a commercial laboratory (BML, Inc.) for assaying nilotinib concentration by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In addition, we applied this method to TDM of CML patients receiving nilotinib at our hospital. Main outcome measures: The calibration curve exhibited linearity over the nilotinib concentration range of 50-2500 ng/ml at 250 nm, with relative standard deviations (n = 5) of 7.1, 2.5, and 2.9% for 250, 1500, and 2500 ng/ml, respectively. The detection limit for nilotinib was 5 ng/ml due to three blank determinations (q = 3). In addition, we compared the results with those measured by LC-MS/ MS at BML, Inc. (a commercial laboratory). As a result, a strong correlation was observed between the nilotinib concentrations measured by our HPLC method and those obtained by LC/MS-MS (r 2 = 0.988, p \\ 0.01). In addition, TDM of nilotinib was performed to six CML patients. There was the case which participated in dosage adjustment of nilotinib in hepatic dysfunction and poor glycaemic control. Results: We have developed a simple ultraviolet detection method for the determination of nilotinib, which has high sensitivity and large dynamic range",

This has not yet been evaluated in Chile. We are assessing the economic impact of this clinical pharmacy unit by reviewing and analyzing both pharmaceutical interventions (PI) and its relationship with direct cost savings. Setting and method: Review and analysis of computer records PI; selection of interventions associated with high cost drugs and evaluated in terms of direct cost savings. Retrospective study of 8 months in a pediatric hospital in the Chilean Public Health System. Main outcome measures: Categorization and analysis of PI. Estimation of net cost savings of the clinical pharmacy unit. Results: Of 1516 PI in 330 patients (4.6 PI per patient), 47% (n = 709) were classified as therapeutic, 41% (n = 629) for safety, and 12% (n = 178) education. 27% (n = 411) were for adjustment or the maintenance of a dose, 24% (n = 367) adjustments for plasmatic levels, 14% (n = 216) education in the use of the drug and 12% (n = 177) an adjustment of drug administration. Antimicrobial drugs 52% (n = 757), antineoplastic 23% (n = 353), and immunomodulatory 8% (n = 119) were the largest number of interventions. Oncology units 30% (n = 487), bone marrow transplantation 23% (n = 328) and intensive care unit 19% (n = 285) were the services with the largest number of records. 90 PI (5.9%) were associated with direct cost savings (DCS) of US$ 185.522, generating a net cost savings (NCS) of US$ 136.892, calculated from the difference between the DCS and spending clinical pharmacy unit US$ 48.630 (132 weekly hours, time value US$ 12). Conclusion: Pharmaceutical interventions, mainly adjustments or modified treatments, are associated with direct cost savings in the overall treatment of patients. This has had a positive economic impact on the hospital, as it reduced medical expenses and contributed to the safety and effectiveness of medications.HP-PC058: Proper use of broad spectrum antibiotics in the hospital: results of a one day survey in a teaching hospital Charles-Emmanuel Barth\u00e9lemy * , Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Fievet, Helga Junot Pharmacy, H\u00f4pital Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re, Paris, France",

The 51 others were prescribed as empirical treatment of which, 46 patients received TMP/SMX as antibiotic prophylaxis against pneumocystis jirovecii including post-transplant (n = 20), cancer treatment (n = 15), HIV with CD4 \\ 200 mm 3 (n = 5), autoimmune disease (n = 4) and unknown (n = 2).The mean posology in MP was 370.7 \u00b1 161.4 mg and dosing regimens were 1 pill per day or three times a week. In the case of post-transplant treatment, the mean duration of treatment with TMP/SMX was 104.3 \u00b1 172.0 days. Conclusion: We notice the proper use of TMP/SMX in all indications and the great proportion of use in MP due to the hospital activity which corresponds to a great activity of organ transplants, haematology-oncology, infectious diseases and internal medicine. However, the disparity of regimen and durations leads to the needing of specific guidelines in our hospital.HP-PC060: Benzodiazepines and frail elderly people: optimization proposals in a geriatric daymedicine, CHU de Toulouse, Toulouse, France",

The relevant information was obtained from the National Statistics Office, the Primary Health Care Department and the Central Supplies and Procurement Unit. The local scheme for vaccinating 12 year old girls was assessed for the years 2013-2015. Costs for 2016 were analysed separately. Primarily, estimated costs were generated in terms of the wholesale cost of the vaccine, the number of girls born per year and the number of doses administered per year. In order to generate more accurate results, this method was repeated in terms of the tender price (as of 2015), the number of girls who attended the full three dose scheme and the number of doses administered per year. Cost estimation of including boys in the vaccination scheme per year was also performed. Main outcome measures: Cost of vaccinating girls per year. Results: In Malta, the wholesale cost per Cervarix \u00d2 vaccine on the private market as of December 2015 was \u20ac90.79c. While the cost per Cervarix \u00d2 vaccine offered by the NHS acquired by tender in 2015 was \u20ac26.52c. In 2013, girls born in both 2000 and 2001 were vaccinated.

SMR is used to give an overview of the patients medication, to dispense and to administrate medicine. However it is well-known that SMR is not properly updated by physicians. This can create a number of discrepancies between SMR and the patients current medication history (MH), which may result in medication errors during hospital admission and after discharge. To perform proper medication reconciliation (MR) a valid MH must be obtained, which should be based on at least two sources; one dispensing and one prescribing. Obtaining a precise MH is a demanding and time consuming task that is sometimes given low priority by physicians. This study showed that pharmacists can contribute in recording MH prior to admission and conducting MR at admission. By having pharmacist obtaining a valid MH it was possible to conduct a MR, leading to discrepancies being detected and removed from SMR. Discrepancies that may otherwise, because of low priority given to MH and MR by physicians, have followed the patient through the entire hospitalisation and after discharge.",

Biologic interventions commonly attained DLQI MCID: 91.2% (83 of 91 study arms).The MCID was attained by 77.8% (14 of 18) of topical, and 52.4% (11 of 21) of systemic treatment arms. Where changes in SF-36 Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores were extractable, 52.2% (24 of 46) 'study arms' met the 3-point MCID, including 58.3% (21 of 36) of biologic interventions.

Only 25% (1 of 4) of systemic and no topical treatments met the MCID for both MCS and PCS domains of SF-36.Conclusion: The findings of this study indicate that there is an increasing recognition of the value of QoL assessment in monitoring the efficacy of interventions in psoriasis. MCID values enhance the clinical meaningfulness of QoL scores, particularly if data is correlated with clinical efficacy. It appears that there is a need for guidelines to standardise the use of health-related QoL instruments in RCTs of treatments for psoriasis as well as reporting of their results.

Two objectives are determined: secure and optimize prescriptions and provide therapeutic education to patients who need it. Design: This work is an observational, prospective and monocentric study realised in cardiology units (79 beds) between November 2015 and June 2016. 1 senior pharmacist, 1 junior pharmacist, 7 student pharmacists and 1 pharmacy technician are involved in the deployment. Activities executed in the unit were: medication reconciliation, pharmaceutic interventions, exit interview with drug management plans conducted by pharmacist and therapeutic education in official education program (individual session and group session). Results: 1640 patients received medication reconciliation a the admission. 180 medication errors have been detected by this way. Omissions were the most errors found (65%). In the same time, while the hospitalisation 344 pharmaceutical interventions were formulated and 96.6% were accepted by physicians. Concerning, therapeutic education 311 patients received an interview with drug management plans and 104 patients were integrated in the official education program (34 patients in individual sessions and 70 in group session). Conclusion: The deployment is a complete success. The pharmacy team was quickly integrated in cardiology units and patients were totally satisfied of this action. The next objective will be to demonstrate that therapeutic education dispense by pharmacist can decrease re-hospitalisation of patients with cardiovascular diseases.Pharmacy, University of Malta, Msida, MaltaPlease specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Cancer is a multi-faceted condition requiring a multidisciplinary approach when treating patients, thus professionals must understand their contribution as well as that of others.

University of Bonn; 2011 HP-CE009: Monitoring adherence tool for patients treated with DAAs for HCV: is it effective?Please specify your abstract type: Descriptive abstract (for projects) Background and objective: Direct acting antivirals (DAAs) have become elective treatment in Italy for patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) with advanced fibrosis. As compliance to HCV treatment is challenging, a combined approach between Pharmacists and Hepatologists has been endorsed to manage these treatments. When DAAs are dispensed at the Hospital Pharmacy counter, patients are informed by a Pharmacist about all issues related to treatment and a ''Patient Information Leaflet'' is given out consisting of medication information and a compliance diary. The diary, filled in daily by the patient with medication administration and ADRs, is returned to the Pharmacy monthly. The objective is to determine the efficacy of the monitoring tool. Design: Fifty-nine patients received the monitoring tool (February 2015-June 2016). Data collected: demographic characteristics, treatment regimen, drug dispensing, adherence and ADRs. Results: Thirty-seven patients (63%) returned the monitoring tool to the Pharmacy. Patients' characteristics: 19 females (51%); mean age 65 \u00b1 10.21 years (63 \u00b1 10.15 years total population). The data show that women were more willing to fill in the compliance diary compared to men (86% females; 49% males) and the mean age was higher showing that younger patients were less compliant. Treatments \u00b1 ribavirin: sofosbuvir (12 patients with diary/14 total), ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir (10/12), sofosbuvir/ ledipasvir (11/20), sofosbuvir + simeprevir (1/5), ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir (1/4), sofosbuvir + daclatasvir (1/3) and simeprevir + IFN (1/1). Patients treated with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir (83%) were the most adherent while those treated with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (55%) the least. Since the latter treatment has the least complex regimen compared to the other medications, the low compliance to the monitoring tool is less important. Therapeutic adherence is high (99%) however two administration errors were identified (4-day treatment interruption and double dosing). ADRs were reported by 16 patients (48%). The most frequent side effects were: headache, fatigue and nausea. Unknown ADRs such as epistaxis and hyperglycaemia were observed. Conclusion: Despite not all patients returned the diary, the tool has been shown to be a crucial element in raising awareness about compliance and ADRs. Through a multidisciplinary approach, Pharmacists' expertise has contributed to improve the management of patients' treatment achieving better therapeutic adherence.Emilio Campos-Davila *,1 , Francisco Araujo 2 , Inmaculada Marin-Ariza 2 , Juan Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Baez 1 , Eloisa Marquez-Fernandez 3 , Jose Luis Puerto-Alonso 4 Pharmacy, Hospital SAS La L\u00ednea, La L\u00ednea de La Concepci\u00f3n, Pharmacy, Serrania de Ronda Healthcare Area, Ronda, 3 Pharmacy, Campo de Gibraltar HealthCare Area, Algeciras, 4 Internal Medicine, Hospital SAS La L\u00ednea, La L\u00ednea de La Concepci\u00f3n, SpainPlease specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: In type 2 diabetes, second anti-hyperglycaemic agent after metformin should be chosen considering efficacy, side effects, weight, hypoglycaemia risk, patient preferences but also cost, as it should be insulin therapy in types 1 and 2. The Andalusian Public HealthCare has developed two evidence-based indicators in diabetes to measure compliance between different Areas and doctors, and to promote a more cost-efficient prescription. In this study we describe the strategies to improve compliance with these indicators in an Internal Medicine (IM) Unit. Setting and method: Retrospective observational study that measures the prescription percentage of two quality indicators before and after an educational program consisting of clinical sessions, meetings with the head of the IM team and/or meetings with medical and management direction. Doctors also should be informed on their results every 2 months. The prescription rates were measured in January 2015, when program was starting, and 1 year after. Prescribing data were obtained from the computerized pharmacy records of reimbursed drugs Program (Microstrategy \u00d2 ) of all members who belonged to the IM team at least 1 month during the time studied. Main outcome measures: Percentage of oral antidiabetics (OA) considered as first-line drugs (gliclazide, glipizide and glimepiride) prescribed versus total of OA prescribed, and percentage of premixed and biphasic insulins versus total insulins (excluding rapid-acting) prescribed. Number of clinical sessions, meetings and submitted reports. Results: Three clinical sessions were given by clinicians and a pharmacist to the MI Team (8 doctors), plus two meetings were held between the pharmacist, Chief Doctor and Medical Director. Reports were sent to doctors in 100% of possible periods. First selection OA (gliclazide, glipizide and glimepiride) prescription rate was 7.59% at the beginning and increased to 28.74% 1 year later and the percentage of premixed and biphasic insulin rose from 13.27 to 39.54% at the end of the study. Conclusion: Due to an of educational prescribing program based on clinical evidence guidelines, prescription of oral antidiabetics and insulin therapy was improved in terms of efficiency in an Internal Medicine Unit. This has resulted in a significant reduction of cost per treatment, what is important for the sustainability of the public HealthCare.Pharmacy, Hospital SAS La L\u00ednea, La L\u00ednea de La Concepci\u00f3n, Pharmacy, Ronda HealthCare Area, Ronda, 3 Pharmacy, Campo de Gibraltar HealthCare Area, Algeciras, Spain Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: When an NSAID needs to be prescribed, the selection should be based on the assessment of the individual risk factors, including gastrointestinal, renal and cardiovascular risks. Regarding fracture prevention, cost-effectiveness is the key to firstline drugs choice. The Andalusian Public HealthCare has developed two evidence-based indicators related to Bone and Joint pathologies, to measure compliance between different Areas and doctors to these indicators and therefore its unequal application of clinical guidelines. In this study we describe the strategies to improve compliance with these indicators in an Orthopaedics and Traumatology (O&T) Unit. Setting and method: Retrospective observational study that measures the prescription percentage of two quality indicators before and after an educational program consisting of clinical sessions, meetings with the head of the O&T team and/or meetings with Medical and Management direction. Doctors also should be informed on their results every 2 months. The prescription rates were measured in January 2015, when program was starting, and 1 year after. Prescribing data were obtained from the computerized pharmacy records of reimbursed drugs Program (Microstrategy \u00d2 ) of all members who belonged to the O&T team at least 1 month during the time studied. Main outcome measures: Percentage of NSAIDs considered as firstline drugs (naproxen and ibuprofen) prescribed versus total of NSAIDs prescribed, and percentage of alendronate versus total of drugs approved for fracture prevention. Number of clinical sessions, meetings and submitted reports. Results: Two clinical sessions were given by a pharmacist to the O&T Team (9 doctors), plus two meetings were held between the pharmacist, Chief Doctor and Medical Director. Reports were sent to doctors in 100% of possible periods. Naproxen and Ibuprofen prescription rate was 17.16% at the beginning and increased to 47.98% 1 year later and the percentage of alendronate prescribed rose from 7.87 to 32.05% at the end of this period.Conclusion: Due to an of educational program, the prescription of NSAIDs and drugs for fracture prevention is now more in line with the Clinical Guidelines in the Orthopaedics and Traumatology Unit, what means an improvement in safety and cost-efficiency in our HealthCare Area.

The objective of the study was to describe and compare the perception of patients and physicians about the access to OD commercialized in our country. Setting and method: Cross-sectional study, approved by the bioethical committee of our university, performed through a questionnaire, designed for each group, including open and closed ended questions (patients: 49 questions and physicians: 52 questions) distributed by e-mail. Contact was established with physicians (n = 169) related to RD patients and with patients (n = 52) through their associations. Four RD were studied: hereditary angioedema, Fabry disease, paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria and mucopolysaccharidosis. Main outcome measures: Sociodemographic characteristics of the volunteers (patients and physicians) and perceptions concerning RD and OD related aspects: accessibility, allocated resources, formation/ information, assistance quality and satisfaction with the healthcare system. Results: 39 (75.0%) patients and 65 (38.5%) physicians completed the questionnaire. The majority of the patients (97.4%) had a confirmed diagnosis that was obtained in less than a year in 33.3% of the cases. The physicians declared that these percentages were 83.1 and 38.5% for their patients, respectively. In both groups, 30.8% of the cases obtained diagnoses in more than 3 years and this delay can lead to relevant consequences: aggravation of the diseases or failure to receive any treatment. In general, 64.1% of the patients and 66.2% of the physicians were satisfied with the access to the available OD. 83.1% of the physicians considered that their patients received the most adequate treatment. However, 24.6% declared that their patients have had problems accessing treatment, supported by 28.2% of the patients, which were due primarily to the refusal by the healthcare system. 71.8 and 66.2% of patients and physicians respectively, considered that the resources allocated to RD/OD in our country were not sufficient. 66.2% of the physicians declared that there was no registry of RD in their hospital, and 53.8% of the patients did not know if it existed. 71.8% of the patients and 76.9% of the physicians were not satisfied with the coordination between the different healthcare professionals. 66.7% of the patients were satisfied with the access to specialized professionals, and 61.5% of the physicians were satisfied with the dedication they can offer to the patients. Conclusion: No significant differences were observed between the opinions of the two groups. The participants did not reveal large barriers in obtaining the OD, although the ones who revealed them, highlighted the refusal by the healthcare system as the largest one. Moreover, lack of resources for RD and OD, registry and coordination at an assistance level were indicated.Reference1. EMA [web side]. London c1995-2016 [20/06/2016].

The objective of this study is to explore patterns and factors associated with sick-leave in pregnancy, focusing on medication use. Setting and method: Multinational, web-based study in 12 European countries in the period of October 2011-February 2012. Via utilization of an electronic questionnaire, we collected data about timing and reason for being on sick-leave, maternal sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, pregnancy-related illnesses, medication use and maternal mental health via the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS, range 0-30). Descriptive analysis and logistic regression models were conducted. Main outcome measures: Sick-leave during pregnancy. Results: Of 6686 women included, 3385 (51%) reported to have been on sick-leave during pregnancy. The crude rates of sick-leave varied across countries, ranging from 32 to 35% in Sweden and the United Kingdom, to 62-71% in Norway, Serbia, Croatia and Poland. The most common reasons for being on sick-leave were pregnancy complications (18%), pain in the neck, back or pelvic girdle (11%), and nausea and vomiting (NVP) (11%). Women using medications for NVP or pain had significant higher rates of being on sick-leave compared to women with untreated NVP or pain, 60 vs 51%, and 55 vs 50% (p \\ 0.001), respectively. Women on sick-leave had also significantly higher rates of depressive symptoms based on the EPDS compared to women not being on sick-leave (mean (SD)95% CI 1.4-2.2), infertility treatment (aOR: 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.7), and smoking before pregnancy (aOR: 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.3). Conclusion: There are differences across European countries in the extent of sick-leave during pregnancy. Maternal health and medications use were important factors associated with sick-leave in pregnancy.PT003: Impact of antiemetic guideline consistency on the patient's quality of life Nibal Abunahlah *,1 , Tayf Alqozbakr 1 , Mesut Sancar 2 Clinical Pharmacy, Istanbul Kemerburgaz University, 2 Clinical Pharmacy, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey",

Design: This was a single-institution, retrospective observational study including all patients diagnosed with prostate carcinoma that started treatment with AA between December 2013 and June 2016. Demographic and clinical data were extracted from the medical record (Diraya \u00d2 ) and dispensing module Outpatient Database Athos \u00d2 APD. Data collected: ECOG performance status, age, date of diagnosis, previous treatment regimens, values of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and testosterone baseline and after 3 months of treatment.

Randomized clinical studies have reported data on switching from EPO to DA, however, there is a lack of published literature on switching in patients from DA to EPO. The objective of our study was investigate doses differences and ratio upon switching in ambulatory patients with renal anaemia undergoing haemodialysis. Setting and method: Retrospective cohort study, observational. Inclusion: Eligible patients had received haemodialysis and DA for C5 months. Patients with transfusion the 90 days prior to the laboratory analysis were excluded. Dose conversion ratio (DCR) was calculated for patients with Hb and ESA data available in both evaluation periods (EP) (Months 1 and 2 were defined as the preswitch EP, and Months 6 and 7 as the post-switch EP). All statistical analysis were performed using the Excel software. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample in different time periods. In the beginning we decided to use a DCR of 200 IU/mcg, DA was administrated weekly, and EPO 3 days per week. Main outcome measures: Haemoglobin level (Hb), dose of DA/EPO and red blood cell transfusions pre-and post-switch were quantified. Results: Of 18 patients (55% men) enrolled, 4 had data available for DCR analysis. Two dropped out because they died, and 12 as decided by the nephrologist because did not feel confident with the switching after the first/second month with EPO. In the pre-switch period Hb = 11.1 \u00b1 1.2 g/dl, received an average dose of DA 20 \u00b1 11 mcg, and in the post-switch (medium of 4 and 6 month after the switching) period 11.5 \u00b1 0.5 g/dl, received 6000 IU per week. Which represent a DCR of 150 \u00b1 104 IU/mcg. Conclusion: In our population of haemodialysis patients switched from DA to EPO the DCR was 150 IU/mcg. The number of patients is low. We need to study the reason why the doctor has more confidence with the treatment of DA.PT006: Antibiotic audit with feedback performed by pharmacist in a Norwegian hospital setting: registration of cefotaxime use on a pulmonary ward Christina Brekke * , Irene \u00d8deg\u00e5rdSjukehusapoteka Vest HF, Sjukehusapoteket i Bergen, Bergen, NorwayPlease specify your abstract type: Descriptive abstract (for projects) Background and objective: Increasing antibiotic resistance is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest threats to public health. Overuse and inappropriate use of antibiotics, in particular broad-spectrum antibiotics, is the key driver for development of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Over decades, there has been an increase in the use of broadspectrum antibiotics in Norway, despite low resistance rates that do not justify this practice. Norwegian hospitals are required to have antimicrobial stewardship programs to ensure more appropriate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in hospitals. In collaboration with the Infection Prevention and Control Unit, the Pulmonary ward at Haukeland University Hospital decided to carry out an audit with feedback, focusing on the use of cefotaxime, a third generation cephalosporin. The aim was to observe if the use of this antibiotic was according to the Norwegian guidelines for antibiotic use in hospitals. Design: This audit included in-patients treated with cefotaxime from October 2015 to January 2016. Patient data were collected once a week and obtained from electronic medical charts, medical records and through discussion with the contact physician. The main focus was on indication and dosage of cefotaxime. Results: In total, 43 patients were included. 14 (33%) received treatment for community acquired pneumonia (CAP), even though empirical treatment for CAP is penicillin according to the national guidelines. For seven (16%) patients the indication was either unclear or missing. Five (12%) patients received cefotaxime treatment in combination with metronidazole for empyema, which is adherent with the national guidelines. Three (7%) patients received cefotaxime as monotherapy for atypical pneumonia, but according to the national guidelines empirical treatment is macrolides. Conclusion: A significant proportion of the patients received antibiotic therapy that deviate from the national guidelines, without any plausible reasons. Such prescribing practices may contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance. Key measures should be in relation to enhance competence, awareness regarding use of the national guidelines and promote more prudent antibiotic prescribing.PT007: Study of the implementation of good practice for use parenteral nutrition three-chamber bags Olga Carrascosa Piquer * , Iv\u00e1n De la Vega, Natalia Garc\u00eda del Busto, Silvia Cornejo, Celia Aparicio, Agust\u00edn S\u00e1nchez Pharmacy, Hospital Universitario de La Ribera, Alzira, Spain Please specify your abstract type: Research abstract Background and objective: Evaluate use of parenteral nutrition Three-chamber bags (PNTB) and the degree of compliance with good practices for safe use (GP), published by the Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy (SEFH).

Among its main adverse effects, haematological toxicity stands out. Several risk factors that may increase linezolid safety issues have been suggested. We aimed to identify risk factors associated to the appearance of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia. Setting and method: Cross-sectional retrospective study in a Portuguese Teaching Hospital. Adult patients treated with linezolid (600 mg BID) for more than 6 days between Jan-2014 and Dec-2015, with complete laboratory tests available were included. Patients admitted into the Haematology ward, or with haematological conditions, or that had blood or derivatives transfusions were excluded. Main outcome measures: Linezolid-induced platelet counting reduction. Results: Of the 1.033 patients treated with linezolid, 315 patients were analysed. They were 69.5 years old, 68.3% males, and treated for an average of 14.8 days (SD = 10.1) with Linezolid 600 mg BID. Baseline creatinine clearance was 51 (SD = 41) with no difference between genders (t test p = 0.076) but in correlation with age (r = -0.376; p \\ 0.001). Patients presented 260,873 platelet (SD = 140,658) with no difference between genders (t-test p = 0.177) or correlation with age (p = 0.745). After linezolid, platelet counting reduced in 18.6% in average (SD = 41%). Multivariate analysis found initial platelet counting (OR 1.004; 95% CI 1.002-1.006) and treatment duration (OR 1.047; 95% CI 1.017-1.077) as the only predictors for mild platelet reduction (25-50%). Another multivariate model found creatinine clearance (OR 0.988; 95% CI 0.980-0.996), initial platelet counting (OR 1.003; 95% CI 1.001-1.005), and treatment duration (OR 1.033; 95% CI 1.008-1.059) as the predictors for severe platelet reduction ([50%). Conclusion: Linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia is associated to impaired renal function, initial platelet status, but mainly to linezolid course duration.PT016: Hepatitis c virus relapses in patients treated with second generation direct-acting antivirals Delia Fern\u00e1ndez-Redondo * , Oscar Pinar L\u00f3pez, Andrea L\u00e1zaro Cebas, Sara Ortiz P\u00e9rez, Marta Gonz\u00e1lez Sevilla, Mercedes Campo Angora, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Ferrari Piquero Hospital Universitario 12 De Octubre, Madrid, SpainPlease specify your abstract type: Descriptive abstract (for projects) Background and objective: Second generation Direct-Acting Antivirals (DAAs) are associated with high sustained virological response rates after 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12); however, there are about 5% of relapses.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommended that vancomycin antibiotic exposure (AUC24/MIC) should be over 400. However, because of the difficulty of gathering the available information in the clinical setting to calculate AUC/MIC, some authors 1 have published articles explaining the method to calculate AUC in steady state with mathematical equations. Our aim was to compare the AUC estimated by mathematical method with a two-compartimental Bayesian forecasting model. Setting and method: Observational retrospective study carried out in a tertiary hospital from January to December 2015. Non obese adult patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) \\ 120 ml/min and who have achieved steady state level were included. Vancomycin serum values were measured using a chemiluminescence's immunoassay (CMIA) and Bayesian analysis was performed with Abbottbase PKSystem \u00d2 (Pks \u00d2 ). The statistical analysis was made with MedCalc Sofware \u00d2 . Bland-Altmann plots and Passing-Bablok regression were used to compare both methods. Main outcome measures: age, weight, dose, creatinine, and size were collected from clinical history. Area under the curve (24 h) was estimated using the mathematical method (AUCF) and Bayesian calculations (AUCB). Results: 50 patients were included, with a mean age of 61 (\u00b116.17) years. 52% were male and 48% female. They received a median dose per 24 h of 2000 (1000-3000) mg. The mean of AUCB was 632.56 mg/L*h (95% CI 543.90-721.22) and AUCF 648.3154 mg/ L*h (95% CI 554.88-741.75). Correlation coefficient (r) between AUCF and AUCB was 0.79 (95% CI 0.6574-0.8764). Bland-Altmann plots analysis: mean difference = 15.8, limits of agreement 422.9 and -391.4. The regression equation estimated by Passing-Bablok was y = 44.413383 + 0.929528x. Conclusion: both methods estimate practically the same mean value of AUC with an acceptable correlation coefficient. However, Bland-Altmann plots and Passing-Babloq regression showed the two methods may not be used interchangeably because the differences observed could have important clinical implications in the efficacy and toxicity of antibiotic treatments. Moreover, this observed differences in AUC can be accentuated if MIC [ 1. So, Bayesian estimation remains the best option for optimal dosing of vancomycin. Reference 1. C. Andrew DeRyke et al.
