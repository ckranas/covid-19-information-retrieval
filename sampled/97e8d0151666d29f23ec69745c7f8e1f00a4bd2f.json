In this mixed-methods PRISMA-compliant scoping review, we set out to determine if ARDS, sepsis and DIC could account for the coagulopathy and if there were any other features of the coagulopathy we could determine so as to inform future research. Methods: We used a search strategy to identify papers with clinically relevant thromboembolic events in COVID-19. We then developed a technique referred to as an Abridged Thematic Analysis (ATA) to quickly identify themes in the papers so as to increase the yield of clinically relevant information. We further developed Validated Abridged Thematic Analysis (VATA) to validate the resulting taxonomy of themes. Finally we developed a number of methods that can be used by other researchers to take forwards this work. Results: We identified 56 studies with 10,523 patients, 456 patients with COVID-19 and thromboembolic events (TBE's) and 586 thrombembolic events. There were an average of 1.3 TBE's per patient. There were five main arterial territories with corresponding clinical sequelae: Acute limb ischaemia, myocardial infarcts, strokes, mesenteric ischaemia and pulmonary embolism.",

From the ATA, we identified 16 characteristics of the clotting pathology in COVID- 19 . From the VATA, we identified 34 mechanisms leading to coagulopathy and grouped them according to Virchow's triad of vascular damage, stasis and hypercoagulability. Coagulopathy occurred with and without each of ARDS, Sep- sis and DIC. We conclude that COVID-19 leads to the syndrome of a viral clotting fever in a subgroup of patients and that the presentation of coagulopathy and fever should raise the possibility of COVID-19 as a differential. We make recommendations for future research studies.",

Factor IXa then activates Factor VIII to Factor VIIIa. The intrinsic and extrinsic pathways both act on the common pathway (see Figure 4 ) via activation of Factor X to Factor Xa.

(Mitchell, 2020) reviews the relationship of thromboinflammation to acute lung injury in There is noted to be damage to the endothelium and thrombosis in the perialveolar capillaries. (Mitchell, 2020) notes the antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms of the vascular endothelium and that in COVID-19 there is loss of the contact with the basement membrane, exposing procoagulant factors. (Mitchell, 2020) also notes the influx of neutrophils and macrophages seen in COVID-19 in response to acute lung injury and their role in promoting thrombosis and inhibiting fibrinolysis. The Berlin definition does not include the construct of acute lung injury (ALI) due to inconsistencies in the use of the terminology (Fanelli et al, 2013) although this is referenced in the older literature and refers to a milder form of lung injury. (Wheeler and Rice, 2009 ) outline a number of relationships that are relevant to the question of COVID-19-related coagulopathy. They note that up to 50% of cases of acute lung injury result from sepsis but also patients with acute lung injury may be more likely to develop sepsis.

In the Dyhor-19 Study (Villard et al, 2020 ) demonstrate a correlation between CRP and Aldosterone levels and COVID-19 severity. (Dudoignon et al, 2020) found that half of patients with COVID-19 and ARDS had acute kidney injury and this was significantly associated with activation of the RAAS with patients having high levels or renin and aldosterone on admission. In summary, SARS-COV2 gains entry to cells via the ACE-2 receptor which in turn can lead to the downregulation of ACE-2 receptors and to an increase in Angiotensin II. There is evidence of elevated Angiotensin II levels in COVID-19. Angiotensin II in turn can lead to an increased risk of thrombosis. This can be considered as a component of the blood which leads to hypercoagulability.

If we consider a thromboembolic event then organ dysfunction is a function of the location of the event. The key question we should consider is whether there is a dysregulated immune response and in asking this question it becomes clear that SIRS cannot lead to a clotting event as this cannot be considered a healthy response. The utility of SIRS is lost due to semantics but we can still consider the associated mechanisms and the role of IL-6. However from a clinical perspective, the new sepsis consensus definition has removed the construct of SIRS, although there is an argument for the utility of SIRS (Sprung et al, 2016 ).

However we would argue that confounding factors are responsible for the thrombosis with thrombocytopenia. Indeed the low platelet count is likely to reflect a period of increased activation of platelets and consumption which in turn is more likely to be related to thromboembolic events. The low platelet count is similar therefore to the D-Dimers and fibrinogen in reflecting the end result of pathway activation rather than the cause. The platelet count is included in the SIC score but here we are looking specifically at biologically plausible mechanisms for thromboembolic events. HIT is appropriate to consider and this can be included with iatrogenic mechanisms. More appropriate to a COVID-19 coagulopathy is the platelet activation that is central to the modern interpretation of thromboinflammation and it is in this context that we include platelet activation in the model of COVID-19-related coagulopathy. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

Arterial thromboembolic events are usually a result of many decades of pathology, predominantly through the development of atherosclerotic plaques. Deep vein thromboses however can occur relatively acutely and more frequently and this reflects the importance of stasis. The veins are valved and contrast anatomically with the elastic, pulsatile arteries and the blood is more prone to coagulation in the venous system with reduced mobility. With COVID-19, we see this pattern is reversed and arterial thromboembolic events occur relatively frequently and acutely even in the absence of plaques.",

The involvement of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems are particularly important in this regards. The second point relates to the effect on Angiotensin-II which is thought to be upregulated. Angiotensin-II has many effects including vasoconstriction and is thrombogenic. Thus by gaining entry to the cells via the ACE-2 receptor, SARS-COV2 sets in process a chain of events leading to an increase in the levels of circulating Angiotensin thereby potentially contributing to hypercoagulability of the blood.",

Thematic analysis is a flexible method for analysis that has been used with a variety of different approaches including philosophical underpinnings. (James, 1907) . We argue that in a pandemic, there is a strong ethical imperative to utilise and make available a methodology for rapidly analysing clinical literature to gain invaluable insights and generate understanding and testable models. Ironically it is pragmatism that led to the school of behaviourism which in turn led to response items in psychological testing which in turn can be viewed as eliciting a reactionary approach in terms of the reflexive approach that can be used in thematic analysis.

The occurrence in these territories would have implications for diagnostics, community and hospital surveillance and public health campaigns and it is therefore important to test this hypothesis further. Systematic reviews or meta-analyses could investigate the question of incidence, the involvement of other territories as well as the likelihood of diagnosis in different settings.

There has been criticism of case reports and case series as lacking the rigour of randomised controlled trials (RCT's) (Jung et al, 2020) . However as we have demonstrated, such publications can bring valuable insights that not even RCT's may offer. Indeed the problems posed by the COVID-19 pandemic have disrupted research (Kimmel et al, 2020) and caused a reappraisal of the role of different types of evidence (Greenhalgh, 2020) .

To give an example, there is evidence that Angiotensin II leads to thromboinflammation in non-COVID-19-related research although we did not find this evidence in the literature we examined for COVID-19 although it is entirely plausible and can be extrapolated through induction. However if this were to form the basis for a therapeutic trial we may consider it too early to jump to such conclusions and this is the purpose of the diagram mapping. Instead the next step would be to formulate the hypothesis that Angiotensin II leads to thromboinflammation in COVID-19 and investigate this in the usual way through case studies, case series, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, narrative reviews and various types of trials or cohort studies.

In clinical medicine we are dealing with the whole, also referred to as holistic or integrated. In effect we are dealing with systems biology and this is done routinely in clinical practice. When dealing with this in clinical practice, the clinician will readily understand what we mean by clinical intuition and that clinical medicine is an art as well as a science and a technology (application of clinical knowledge). The clinician must quickly deal with clinical matters by means of the clinical assessment which involves the history, examination and an analysis of the results of the various investigations. The clinician thereby builds up an intuitive understanding of the whole picture, with an often understated but necessary reference to the systems biology of the patient. Consider a case in which there is an acute deterioration in renal function. How will this impact on the clearance of medication? How will this impact on the history and in what way will that impact on the interpretation of other aspects of the history?

With the expansion of knowledge resulting from other branches of science, precision medicine can be interpreted more broadly as the application of an ever increasing body of scientific knowledge to medicine. This knowledge occupies the space between the clinical data and the diagnosis, this intermediate zone that the clinician may also deal with intuitively. With the abundant scientific data available, it is possible to answer questions about the data computationally and there is no shortage of questions that can be asked. However it is this intermediate zone between clinical data and diagnosis and the intersection with the vast amount of scientific data that provides the most clinically relevant area. A clinical symbolic notation allows this area to be mapped out continuously. If this were mapped out on a venn diagram with the intermediate zone and the total body of biological science data, then the intersection would be an area of particular interest. This intersection would be an area where symbolic computation solutions would be expected to develop more rapidly given the potential for clinical application. Additionally areas of basic science which were able to demonstrate links to this intersection would potentially be more able to secure research funding.

By assessing clinical intuition using symbolic structures, algorithms could be developed which are able to ever more effectively train the doctors of the future to improve their clinical intuition in ways which could potentially be incomprehensible to humans or even tailored so that they are understandable.

Our findings are based on a population that was hospitalised and where there was evidence of more advanced age. Fever occurred in most but not all of the patients with this presentation and therefore the clotting fever syndrome is an indication that if both fever and clotting events occur that COVID-19 should be considered as a differential. The absence of fever or thromboembolic events should not discount COVID-19 as a differential and the respiratory as well as other manifestations contribute to a variable presentation.

The primary pathology would appear to be the viral invasion of the endothelium which is mediated via the ACE-2 receptors which together with heparin sulfate affords the virus a route for entry into the cells. Once inside the cells, the virus appropriates the cellular machinery and escapes RNA intracellular sensing mechanisms by means of the construction of replication organelles including double membrane vesicles.",

In the lungs, the blood vessels have a physiological function of ventilation-perfusion matching whilst in the kidneys this forms part of the filtration mechanism.

One clear finding is the presence of NETs and when taken together with the evidence of apoptosis and related mechanisms, a key feature of COVID-19 is exposure of intracellular material to the extracellular environment. Thus while the virus has carefully avoided detection in the intracellular space through the replication organelles, the intracellular material of the host cells is exposed. There is thus the potential for the host immune system to generate an autoimmune response. Furthermore if the tissue destruction is overwhelming and the clearance insufficient then there may be a large amount of circulating antibody complexes leading to a type-III hypersensitivity response in a minority of cases. This in turn can lead to deposition of immune complexes in the skin, kidneys and vasculature with the latter resulting in a vasculitis which can predispose to further thromboembolic events.",

The degree of glycosylation of the S-protein is thought to interfere with the adaptive immune response by reducing the likelihood of antibody formation (V'kovski et al, 2020). The open reading frames coding for the structural proteins are contained within one third of the genome and the genome also codes for accessory proteins (V'kovski et al, 2020). The virus then appropriates the cell machinery to generate replication organelles including doublemembrane vesicles. Viral RNA is transferred into the organelles which offer protection against the host cell's cytosol-based RNA-sensing immune mechanisms (V'kovski et al, 2020). SARS-COV2 has 79-86% sequence homology with SARS-COV or SARS-COV-like viruses (Lu et al, 2020) A further consideration is the effect of the virus on the host and this is inferred from a range of studies including post-mortem studies.

The model of the four humors eventually fell out of favour leaving the way open for new models. Dr Richard Wiseman, royal physician to King Charles II, identified stasis and the characteristics of the blood as causes of thrombosis in a paper published in 1676 (Bagot and Arya, 2008) thus identifying two of the components of Virchow's triad.

Laminar flow describes a streamlined flow which contrasts with turbulent flow in which some parts of a liquid will travel at a different velocity resulting in different characteristics of the overall flow. Atherosclerotic plaques create stenosis and can produce turbulent flow with high shear rates contrasting with low shear rates downstream of a plaque (Wolberg et al, 2012).

In a meta-analysis of coagulation dysfunction in COVID-19 (Jin et al, 2020) analysed 22 studies (n=4889) and found higher D-Dimer levels and prolonged prothrombin time in patients with more severe COVID-19. Non-survivors were more likely to have higher D-Dimer levels, decreased platelet count and increased prothrombin time compared to survivors. (Di Minno et al, 2020) completed a meta-analysis looking at sixty subjects with 5487 patients with severe COVID-19 and 9670 patients with mild COVID-19. As with (Jin et al, 2020) they found evidence of higher D-Dimer levels in non-survivors compared to survivors while non-survivors had lower platelet levels. In another meta-analysis of patients with COVID19, 34 studies were included (n=6492) (Zhu et al, 2020). Their findings were similar to the previous meta-analyses. They found that patients with severe COVID-19 had lower platelet count, higher D-Dimer levels, higher fibrinogen, longer prothrombin time and shorter activated partial thromboplastin time. Again non-survivors were more likely to have higher D-Dimer levels. (Iba\u00f1ez et al, 2020) found evidence of elevated D-Dimers and hypofibrinolysis in a prospective cohort study with COVID-19 in an ICU setting and suggest that the lungs are the source of the elevated D-Dimers. Increased levels of tissue factor in the blood in response to endothelial damage would fit with both explanations and is just one example of mediators of hypercoagulability in response to endothelial damage. In summary, there is strong evidence of elevated fibrinogen and D-Dimers in severe COVID-19 compared to milder expressions of the illness. There is also evidence of decreased platelet count in COVID-19.

In their model, the thrombotic cascade begins when the platelet Gp1 receptor binds to von Willebrand factor released from granules in the endothelium after vessel wall injury. This binding is transient and slows down the platelets sufficiently so that Gp6 can bind with collagen at the site of the vessel wall injury. Following this there is upregulation of integrin receptors which facilitate platetet aggregation. The Gp6 also activates Factor XII leading both to the coagulation cascade and also the activation of the kallikrein-kinin system leading to inflammation and to the end-product bradykinin. There is evidence that the Gp1-VWF-Gp6 pathway is not involved in acute ischaemic stroke injury however and instead it has been suggested that this is mediated by interactions with a damaged vessel wall(Denorme et al, 2019).(Mitchell, 2020) discusses the role of thrombin in thromboinflammation, driving the coagulation cascade and the immune system and activating leucocytes and other cells to release cytokines. (Bray et al, 2020) discuss a potential role for thromboinflammation in microvascular thromboses. They note that the definition of microvessels can vary but in their paper they refer to the arterioles, capillaries and venules in this category. They also note a vast increase in shear stress in the arterioles compared to the venules sufficient to impact on the dynamics of blood flow as well as endothelial cell morphology.Platelets interact with a number of immune cells including neutrophils, leucocytes, monocytes and macrophages in a diverse range of immune-related functions(Rayes et al, 2020).Platelets contain \u03b1-granules with a variety of over 300 proteins, lysosomes containing proteolytic enzymes and dense granules containing molecules including serotonin, calcium and magnesium which mediate platelet activation(Stegner et al, 2019).(Guo and Rondina, 2019) distinguish between immunohemostasis (trapping pathogens with a combination of coagulation and inflammation and involving blood vessel injury without pathology) and",

Thromboinflammation has been suggested as a mechanism which mediates the effects of snake venoms (Teixeira et al, 2019). The relationship between platelets and complement are outlined in (Eriksson et al, 2019). The role of platelets in mediating thromboinflammation in myeloproliferative disorders is examined in (Marin and Heller, 2019).

There is evidence that endothelial cell-derived von Willebrand factor plays a role in post-ischaemic stroke related thrombinflammation(Dhanesha, 2016).

Respiratory failure and hypoxia leading to myocardial injury (Siddameddy et al, 2020) report a case of STEMI with COVID-19 and suggest that respiratory failure with hypoxia can lead to myocardial injury. The myocardium is metabolically flexible (Pascuale and Coleman, 2016) although the association between hypoxia and cardiac arrest is well characterised (Parish et al, 2018). (Raad et al, 2020) investigated the pattern of cardiac injury in patients with COVID-19 and in their discussion suggest a number of factors that may lead to myocardial infarct type II in COVID-19 including hypoxia. Myocardial infarct can lead to complications including Atrial Fibrillation (Gorenek and Kudaiberdieva, 2012) which in turn predisposes to thromboembolism. Hypoxaemia which can lead to hypoxia is a characterising feature of ARDS and many of the 56 main papers identified in our review provide examples of patients with COVID-9 and ARDS. (Raad et al, 2020) therefore provide indirect evidence of COVID-19 leading to hypoxia which in turn leads to myocardial damage as they identify evidence of an association between ARDS and myocardial injury expressed as high-sensitivity Troponin T levels.In summary, there is strong evidence of hypoxaemia in COVID-19 and there is evidence of ARDS-associated myocardial injury in COVID-19 as well as established evidence on the relationship of hypoxia to myocardial injury. While strictly speaking the initial ischaemic injury does not result from a coagulopathy (e.g. NMDA-mediated excitotoxic cell death), coagulation disturbances occur secondary to hypoxia and tissue injury.",

(Helms et al, 2020) suggest hypoxia as a mediator of increased stroke risk and provide evidence of the increased thrombosis seen in ARDS. ARDS is one of the most relevant examples of a COVID-19-related hypoxaemic state although the multitude of pathologies in the critically ill patient can complicate the interpretation. (Helms et al, 2020) suggest a number of mechanisms by which hypoxia can lead to thrombosis. Hypoxia can lead to vasoconstriction which predisposes to occlusion and they cite (Grimmer and Kuebler, 2017) who outlined the details of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). HPV is an efficient homeostatic mechanism which ensures oxygenated areas of the lung are well perfused. HPV is influenced by a number of pharmacological agents which are relevant in anaesthetics (Tarry and Powell, 2017). However as a homeostatic mechanism, this would divert blood away from hypoxic areas and would therefore not be relevant to the coagulopathy unless the mechanism is dysregulated. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF's) are transcription factors which alter gene expression including Tissue Factor and Plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). (Evans, 2019) suggests HIF's as a mediator between sepsis and thrombosis.

There are two main forms of primary thrombotic microangiopathy: Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). In TTP there is reduced activity of ADAMTS13, an enzyme which cleaves the procoagulant von Willebrand Factor (VWF) while in HUS there is excessive release of VWF into the circulation. Secondary thrombotic microangiopathies also exist and result from a number of causes including autoimmune disorders. (Martinelli et al, 2020) reported on a retrospective study of 50 patients with COVID-19 and find evidence of a mild deficiency in ADAMTS13 suggesting that this is evidence of a secondary microangiopathy. They also found evidence of an inverse relationship with D-Dimer levels.

Endotheliitis A number of the authors in the main papers refer to either the possibility of endotheliitis or provide evidence of the same.

(Varga et al, 2020) in their case series report evidence of direct viral invasion of the endothelium and widespread endothelial inflammation.

(Sardu et al, 2020) examine the evidence for endothelial involvement in COVID-19 although focusing on endothelial dysfunction. (Reitsma et al, 2007) provide an overview of the endothelial glycocalyx noting that it is membrane-bound layer consisting of proteoglycans (predominantly), glycosaminoglycans and glycoproteins in dynamic equilibrium with soluble glycosaminoglycans and proteins in the plasma.

In summary, bed rest and immobility are associated with deep vein thrombosis independent of COVID-19 and this relationship is well-established. This association may result from the anatomy of the veins, the dynamics of blood flow in the returning venous circulation and the effects of gravity in pooling blood. Whilst arterial thrombi are described in the literature in association with immobility this occurs much less commonly. In COVID-19 particularly in the ICU setting, immobilisation and bed rest, combined with a thrombophilic state may predispose to DVT's even with thromboprophylaxis and the smooth muscles cells in the walls of the veins express ACE-2 receptors.7.

Numerous metabolic and electrolyte disturbances have been described in critically ill patients and may have a relationship with thromboembolic events. In more general terms (Gawalko et al, 2020) suggest a number of mediators of atrial fibrillation including hypoxaemia, electrolyte imbalance, endothelial dysfunction, ACE-2-related pathways and the cytokine storm. Renal function is an important consideration for electrolyte disturbances and there are a number of findings on urea nitrogen levels (BUN) where BUN is approximately twice the value of serum urea levels. (Shao et al, 2020) undertook a meta-analysis (n=24527) of acute kidney injury in patients with COVID-19 and found that acute kidney injury was significantly associated with mortality and BUN and creatinine were significantly associated with mortality. (Post et al, 2020) report two cases of kidney infarcts associated with elevated LDH. (Liu et al, 2020) found that urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, D-Dimers and lymphocyte ratio (expressed as a percentage of white cell count) were prognostic in COVID-19. (Oussaleh et al, 2020) analysed the biochemical parameters in a prospective cohort study of 162 patients with severe COVID-19 and found that only urea Nitrogen > 0.42 g/L was prognostic for death. Thus there may be an indirect relationship with coagulopathy via critical illness and the associated risks.In terms of sodium(Corwin and McIlwaine, 2019) note that in critically ill patients, hypernatraemia may be associated with reduced cerebral volume which can lead to mechanical stress on the cerebral blood vessels. However(Berni et al, 2020) found evidence of hyponatraemia in COVID-19 and that it was inversely correlated with IL-6 levels which they suggest is mediated by an IL-6-induced vasopressin release. cite evidence that low sodium levels may cause upregulation of the renal membrane bound ACE-2 receptors.

            "text": "at the relationship between platelets and thrombosis in the non-COVID-19 literature one of the conditions associated with both thrombocytopenia and thrombosis is heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The relationship of heparin to thrombocytopenia is well-established and the experimental evidence dates back to 1942 (Arepally, 2017). The negatively charged heparin binds to the positively charged PF4 (which is released from platelet alpha-granules) forming a complex which due to the nature of the electrostatic interactions is dependent on the concentrations of heparin and PF4 (Arepally, 2017). The heparin-P4 complex is the target of antibodies (HIT). PF4 is expressed on the endothelium and is prothrombogenic. HIT is associated with thrombosis and more people develop antibodies when treated with heparin than develop thrombocytopenia or thrombosis (Arepally, 2017) suggesting a subclinical presentation also exists. The heparin/PF4/antibody complex binds to platelets and causes platelet activation via a spleen tyrosine kinase-mediated mechanism and procoagulant microparticles are released (Arepally, 2017). (Gollomp et al, 2018) provide experimental evidence to support several neutrophil-mediated prothrombotic mechanisms in HIT including formation of PF4/NET/HIT antibody complexes and neutrophil-binding to inflamed endothelium. (Perdomo et al, 2019) provide evidence that neutrophil activation and NET's are predominantly responsible for the thrombosis in HIT. (Hsieh et al, 2013) report a case of pneumopathy associated with antiphospholipid antibodies, HIT and cerebral venous thrombosis. The absence of platelet alpha-granules is found in the grey platelet syndrome and is associated with a bleeding tendency (Gunay-Aygun et al, 2010). Multivessel coronary artery thrombosis has been described in a case of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (Yagmur et al, 2012). Antiphospholipid antibodies have been detected in primary immune thrombocytopenia even in the absence of antiphospholipid syndrome and thrombocytopenia is seen in primary antiphospholipid syndrome (Yang et al, 2011).

Furthermore the blood gas barrier (BGB) is formed by the fusion of the basement of the type I pneumocytes and alveolar endothelial cells and plays a role both in oxygen exchange and after endothelial activation also plays a role in the immune response to SARS-COV2. The BGB endothelium is activated by cytokine storms, binding of SARS-COV2 to the ACE-2 receptors on the pulmonary endothelium and via a SARS-COV2 induced redox storm mediated via reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). A key finding is the loss of the pulmonary epithelial glycocalyx in both diabetes type 2 and the metabolic syndrome and it is suggested that this could account for the vulnerability of people with type 2 diabetes to more severe COVID-19.Of note in(Williamson et al, 2020) splenectomy was associated with increased risk of mortality in COVID-19 although this did not reach statistical significance. Nevertheless postsplenectomy there is noted to be an increased risk of arterial thrombosis(Long et al, 2020). in their review cite evidence of destruction of secondary lymphoid tissue in autopsy findings including splenic atrophy and focal haemmorhagic necrosis.

They note the description of 'creeping fat' in Crohn's disease by Crohn in 1932 and note that it may not only be an extra-intestinal repository for mucosa-associated gut bacteria but also that ileal inflammation may increase intestinal permeability. This in turn would facilitate the translocation of intestinal bacteria to extraintestinal locations and may explain why 'creeping fat' is associated with underlying strictures and inflammation. (Coffey et al, 2018) created a metric for mesenteric pathology which included 'fat wrapping' which is equivalent to creeping fat. They found a significant correlation between this metric (mesenteric disease activity index) and the Crohn's disease activity index and argued for inclusion of mesentery in ileocolic resection for Crohn's disease. There is evidence for the involvement of adipose tissue in inflammation and immunomodulation (Mao et al, 2019)(Eder et al, 2019).This raises the question of whether Crohn's disease with GI involvement is a special case of COVID-19 with a potential immunological role for the fat wrapping, whether this is consistently associated with mesenteric ischaemia and if there is passage of the virus from the intestine into the peritoneal cavity and a disruption of the barrier function of the intestinal vascular endothelium.",

There are significant difficulties in applying this body of knowledge to the treatment if the virus and subsequent illness behave differently than in related conditions. However from the perspective of a scoping review, the purpose is to inform research going forwards and induction provides a large number of hypotheses to test in SARS-COV2 that otherwise may not be apparent.Therefore construction of a mixed deductive-inductive model for empirical observations in COVID-19 has the potential to realise a number of advantages over a deductive-only model. In our paper, this inductive model began in the process of validation of the abridged thematic analysis and translated into an intuitive visual format in the process of diagram mapping. In the inductive model we are generalising from non-COVID-19-related pathological mechanisms to COVID-19. This poses the risk of harm if this theory is applied to practice. However we are careful to limit the application of the inductive model in the sense that we are creating a highly theoretical model which is not directly informing practice including policy (particularly as this is a scoping review).",

Firstly the clinician would increase their exposure to clinical data-sets as in each clinical encounter there is an opportunity to produce a symbolic structure (collection of symbols) that correlates with the clinical assessment. Although there are many steps in-between which would require further development, this enables in principle the possibility of service level evaluation according to abstract representations of clinical presentations. With the construction of databases, the clinical assessment could also be searched against other similar presentations which have been annotated and linked for instance to the relevant clinical literature.. Recording a history would involve documenting with symbols, whilst retaining the ability to record text and where special training would be required to enhance the symbolic recording. The history taking (including documentation) would become more efficient and look different to current practice, enriching the level of detail possible and opening up new visas to contribution to this symbolic language by the international scientific community.

The ventilation-perfusion mismatch is likely to account for the phenomenon of silent hypoxia which is of significant consequence in clinical management and hypoxaemia contributes to the risk of a coagulopathy. A disruption in glomerulofiltration results in impaired plasma filtration with significant consequences for various homeostatic mechanisms including those of the electrolytes. The consequences of the invasion of the endothelium by the virus can also be considered in terms of thromboinflammation. The construct of thromboinflammation is well supported in the literature and it is clear that platelet activation plays a significant role in COVID-19. The key question here is the role of the endothelial glycocalyx. There is evidence of disruption of the glycocalyx in COVID-19 and this would result in a local prothrombotic environment and would lead to platelet activation. One of the components of the glycocalyx is heparin sulfate which is required for viral entry into the cells and so the disruption of the glycocalyx would be more likely secondary to viral invasion of the endothelium. A special role may be played by hyaluronan with evidence that in COVID-19 it leads to the creation of a gel in the lungs which may contribute to hypoxaemia. With the seeding of the virus in the lungs and then in the endothelium of other blood vessels, thromboinflammation would result in the generation of a thrombus. The properties of the thrombus would predispose to embolisation including a possible contribution from components of the locally disrupted glycocalyx. The arterial wall would be an ongoing source of thrombogenesis. The role of susceptibility factors is also of",
