The difference between groups was great significant, and P value was less than 0.001. The cell growth inhibition of Aspirin and Nimesulide was correlated with the downgrade of COX-2 gene and PGE 2 production inhibition. 48 hours after Aspirin and Nimesulide effected on EC9706 cells, cell apoptosis was not obvious except 10.2% apoptosis rate attributing by 8 mmol/l Aspirin while apoptosis rate did not add with the extension of drug action period. 48 hours after Aspirin and Nimesulide effected on EC109 cells, cell apoptosis demonstrated obvious increase (the apoptosis rate attributing by 8 mmol/l Aspirin and 100 mmol/l Nimesulide were 20.35% and 45.27% respectively). The apoptosis gained further increase with the extension of drug action period. Within certain concentration limit, cell apoptosis presented dose-dependent manner and accumulated in G 1 phrase, which accounted for more than 90% of total apoptosis. Compared with total apoptosis, P value was less than 0.01, and enjoyed great statistical significance. Apoptosis were further confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of DNA fragmentation, fluorescence staining and Giemsa staining. The apoptosis induction effect of Aspirin and Nimesulide was related with downgrade expression of Bcl-2 gene, and didn't relate with Bax gene expression. Conclusion COX-2 expression or expression upgrade may be one of etiologic factors of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The cell growth of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells (EC9706 and EC109) could be inhibited by Aspirin and Nimesulide in a dose and time dependent manner, and is closely related with expression downgrade of COX-2 gene and PGE 2 production inhibition. The cell growth inhibition of EC9706 and EC109 by Aspirin and Nimesulide is through influencing the transition of cell cycle from G 1 to S phase. There is a dose-dependent manner of EC109 cell lines in certain concentration limit of Aspirin and Nimesulide. The apoptosis accumulates in G 0 /G 1 phrase with cell cycle specific manner. The apoptosis induction effect is relatively weakly related with expression of COX-2 gene and PGE 2 production, doesn't relate with Bax gene, but correlates well with the downgrade expression of Bcl-2 gene. COX-2 specific inhibitors may be one of the effective preventive and treating methods for human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.",

Materials and Methods 248 (137 males, 111 females; meanage 32.6 years) out-patients with chronic dyspepsia (mean symptom duration 8 weeks) were studied from Jun 2001 to April 2003. Organic upper GI disorder were ruled out by endoscopy and gastric antral biopsies were obtained for H&E and rapid urease test for Helicobacter pylori, Gimesa staining for Giardia lamblia, duodenal aspiration as well as three consecutive stool samples were carried on every patients for Giardia antigen immunoassay. The paired Giardiasis patients were treated by cross-over design. One of the pair was randomly treated by a single dose of Tinidazole 2 g po and followed by a single dose of placebo a week later; The other one was treated by a single dose of placebo first and followed by a single dose of Tinidazole 2 g po a week later. Follow up investigation were performed 2 weeks after the treatment. Dyspepsia symptom scores were evaluated before and 2 weeks after the treatment. Results There were about 9.7% patients with chronic dyspepsia were infected by Giardia lamblia. A single dose of Tinidazole can cure about 87.5% Giardiasis with well tolerance. The dyspepsia mean scores were significantly reduced with Tnidazole treatment (before = 5.35 after = 1.8; 0.01). Conclusions One has to be aware of gastric giardiasis as a possible cause of upper GI symptoms. The investigation and treatment of Giardiasis are very important to control the dyspeptic complains in some chronic dyspepsia. It is necessary to know the coincidence of Hp and Giardia lamblia in dyspepsia patients. Clinical improvement after Hp eradication in dyspepsia patients maybe because of eradication of giardiasis, but not from Hp eradication. A single dose of Tinidazole is an effective way to cure over 85 percent of individuals who had giardiasis.",

Materials and Methods RGES with a number of effective parameters were performed via a pair of mucosa/admucosa electrodes implanted along the great curvature 5 cm above pylorus of stomach in twelve healthy human subjects. Symptoms associated with dyspepsia and other discomfort were observed and graded during RGES at different settings, including long pulse and pulse train. The gastric myoelectrical activity at baseline and during different settings of stimulation was recorded with a multi-channel electrogastrography. Result The gastric slow wave was entrained in all the subjects at the pacing parameter of 9 cycles per minute in frequency, 500 msec in pulse width, and 5 mA in amplitude. Mild symptoms as initial sensation appeared at the amplitude of 10 mA with both long pulse and pulsed train in partial subjects. Intolerable symptoms occurred in 11/12 subjects at 15 mA of pulsed train (2s-on, 3s-off, 20 Hz, and 20 msec). Bloating, satiety, discomfort, sting, and nausea were frequently appeared as the stimuli became stronger, and upper abdominal pain was the dominant symptom at the maximum tolerable pacing parameter. Conclusion Acute RGES with stronger parameter results in remarkable symptoms associated with dyspepsia, which would be accepted to deal with obesity. The pacing parameter of 9 cpm, 500 ms and 5 mA would be applicable for RGES.",

We investigated the effect and the changes of anorectal function in patients with different categories of functional constipation following titanoreine suppositories therapy and studied the possible mechanism. Methods patients with functional constipation were selected on the basis of Rome II criteria. The patients were categorized according to colonic transit time and transit index. Multichannel and singleballoon anorectal function detector of Pc Ploygraf HR was applied in patients with slow transit constipation and outlet obstructive constipation to measure such parameters as rectal resting pressure, anal resting pressure, maximal sphincteric squeezing pressure, anorectal pressure when defecation was stimulated, minimum relaxation volume to elicit the anorectal inhibitory reflex and rectal sensation volume. The patients were separately given titanoreine suppositories treatment and kangfu anti-inflammatory suppositories as control.The symptom scores and anorectal manometry were evaluated before and after therapy. Results patients with outlet obstructive constipation showed significantly higher anal resting pressure, higher anal pressure when defecation was stimulated, larger minimum relaxation volume and higher rectal first sensation volume than patients with slow transit constipation.There was no significant difference in the values of defecating sensation volume and maximal tolerable volume.The symptom scores were significantly decreased and the effective rate was higher in patients with outlet obstructive constipation following titanoreine suppositories treatment than following kangfu anti-inflammatory suppositories treatment. After giving titanoreine suppositories therapy, the anal resting pressure, anal pressure when defecation was stimulated, and rectal sensation volume were descended in patients with outlet obstructive constipation. The values of rectal first sensation volume and defecating sensation volume were also decreased in patients with slow transit constipation, however, there was no significant change in symptom scores. Conclusion Low sensitivity and high tolerance of rectum were the same in response to volume stimulation in two types of patients with functional constipation. Patients with outlet obstructive constipation had discoordination of annorectum during defecation and anal sphincter dysfunction in relaxtion. A Titanoreine suppository was effective to patients with functional constipation, in particular, patients with outlet obstructive constipation by protecting anorectal mucous membrana, improving rectal visceral perception and correcting abnormal anorectal motility. tegaserod groups compared with the controls, there are obvious differences in them after treatment due to N1, P1, N2, P2 latencies noticeable prolonging of SEP (P < 0.05). Pronounced differences also lie in before and after treatment with tegaserod P < 0.05), but the difference in two tegaserod groups can be neglected at the same treatment stage. \u00aa Two tegaserod groups compared with the controls, there are obvious differences in them after treatment due to N1, P1, N2, P2 latencies noticeable prolonging of CEP (P < 0.05). Noticeable differences also lie in before and after treatment with tegaserod (P < 0.05), but the difference in two tegaserod groups can be neglected at the same treatment stage. oe Two tegaserod groups compared with the controls, there are significant differences in them after treatment due to N1/P1, P1/N2, N2/P2 peak-to-peak amplitudes noticeable decreasing of SEP (P < 0.05). Pronounced differences also lie in before and after treatment with tegaserod (P < 0.05), but the difference in two tegaserod groups can be neglected at the same treatment stage. There is decreasing trend of N1/P1, P1/N2, N2/P2 peak-to-peak amplitudes of CEP in two tegaserod groups after treatment, but no statistics significance. There is no distinct difference of peak-to-peak amplitudes before and after treatment in two tegaserod groups. Conclusions Tegasrrod (2-4 mg/kg) can efficiently decrease sensitivity to rectal distention in visceral hypersensitivity rats. SEP and CEP can record the changes objectively, which is manifested by long lantencies and small amplitude of SEP and CEP. was given to 42 patients in omeprazole group and cimetidine 400 mg two times daily for 2 weeks to 40 patients in cimetidine group. The 24 h intragastric pH monitoring was done at first day and eighth day during treatment in ten patients randomly from omeprazole group and ten patients randomly from cimetidine group. Results The score of upper abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, acid reflux, heart burn, belching, abdominal bloating and total dyspepsia symptoms in both groups decreased after two weeks treatment (P < 0.01). The score of upper abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, acid reflux, heart burn and total dyspepsia symptoms in omeprazole group after two weeks treatment were lower than those in cimetidine group respectively (P < 0.05). The total efficacy rate of total dyspepsia symptoms in omeprazole group was significantly higher than those in cimetidine group (73.8% vs 45.0%, P < 0.01). At first day and eighth day during treatment, the intragastric media pH and the total time percentage of pH > 3, pH > 4 in omeprazole group was significantly higher than those in cimetidine group respectively (P < 0.05). The declined value of total dyspepsia symptoms score was relative positive to the intragastric media pH (r = 0.868, P < 0.01) and the total time percentage of pH > 3 (r = 0.928, P < 0.01) at eighth day during treatment respectively.

Flow cytometry (FCM) was employed to examine the apoptosis index of gastric cancerous tissues. Results Survivin protein and mRNA expression were detected in 20 of 32 (62.5%) gastric cancerous tissues. In contrast, no expression of survivin was detected in corresponding noncancerous tissues (P < 0.05). The expression of survivin was irrelated to the size of tumor, differentiation, stage and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05). Survivin expression was found significantly associated with reduced apoptosis index (3%\u00b1 0.5% vs 10%\u00b1 0.9%) of no expression by using FCM (P < 0.05). Conclusions The expression of survivin in gastric cancerous tissues is up-regulated, but is undetected in normal tissues. Survivin could be a new diagnostic/therapeutic target in gastric tissues. Its expression is irrelated with the develop, growth and transfer of gastric cancers which indicated that survivin is only a biological index reflecting the develop of gastric carcinomas. Survivin is associated with reduced apoptosis index, which indicates that the gene act an important role during the onset and progression of gastric cancer.",

Methods 227 cases of patients with peptic ulcer in our hospital from 2003-8~2004-2 (partly), the diagnosis was confirmed by endoscopy. The diameter of the ulcer was between 0.5 cm and 2 cm. The H. pylori was examined at the same time. After the course, 21 cases of patients were withdrawn from the study (9%). There were 121 cases with HBsAg (-) and normal liver function, 72 cases of H. pylori positive, 42 cases of gastric ulcer and 79 cases of duodenal ulcer among them. And there were 85 cases with HBsAg (-), 30 cases of normal lever function, 52 cases of H. pylori positive, 37 cases of gastric ulcer and 48 cases of duodenal ulcer among them. All the patients were received ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC) 350 mg, twice a day (for gastric peptic, 6 weeks, and duodenal peptic, 4 weeks). After the course we repeated the endoscopy. For the H. pylori positive patients we examined it again. Analysis the curative effect by the rate of disappearance of pain, the healing of ulcer and the eradication of H. pylori. Results In the HbsAg (-) group, the disappearance of pain was 95% (107/113), and it was 77% (59/77) in the HbsAg (+) group, there was significant difference between them (P < 0.05). In the HbsAg (-) group, the healing of ulcer was 85% (103/121), and 60% (51/85) in the HbsAg (+) group, there was significant difference between them (P < 0.05) too. In the HbsAg (-) group, the eradication of H. pylori was 26% (19/72), and 23% (12/52) in the HbsAg (+) group, there was no significant difference between them (P > 0.05). Conclusion It was confirmed that the ranitidine bismuth citrate had good effect on the healing of peptic ulcer especially the duodenal ulcer. But something else would change the effect of drugs on the peptic ulcer. The patients with HBV infection had different secretion of gastric, mental state, etc. In our research, with the comparison of curative effect between the two groups, it could be said that the infection of HBV would change the curative effect of ranitidine bismuth citrate on the peptic ulcer.",

All rats were implanted with two pairs of electrodes on gastric serosa. In one session long-pulse electrical stimulation was applied until completed entrainment was achieved, and in the other session, no stimulation was applied. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect fos expression in myenteric plexus of gastric antrum whole layer preparations and posterior horn of T6-T10 spinal cord, and the differences of fos-positive neurons number between the two sessions were identified. Results Completed entrainment was achieved in all of the five rats, the necessary energy was 200 ms to 300 ms, 2 mA. There was no fos-immunoreactive neuron in intermedionedial nucleus and intermediolateral nucleus of two sessions. Some dispersing fos expression in superficial lamina of posterior horn was detected, but no difference between two sessions (P > 0.05). There were 6.40 \u00b1 2.79 (n = 5) fosimmunoreactive neurons in myenteric plexus of stimulated rats and there is not one in that of non-stimulating rats. Conclusions Electrical stimulation with proper parameters can entrain completely gastric slow wave of rats.

The dynamic diversification of COX-2 was tested to discuss the relationship between high salt hot diet and CAG. Materials and Methods 1. CAG rat models were made firstly by feeding 15%55\u00b0C salty water for 12 weeks intragastrically. 2. Ultrostructure change in gastric antrum mucosa in the process of CAG formation wa observed by transmission electron microscope. 3 . The expression of COX-2 in rat gastric mucosa was tested by immunohistochemical. 4 The PEG2 in rat gastric mucosa was tested by competition ELISA. Results 1. All the model group rats formed CAG at the end of 12 weeks with the following Pathological changes of CAG and with the time prolonging, the atrophy of gastric mucosa became more seriously. 2. After feeding 8 wks, gastric mucosa cell mitochondrion swelled, endoplasmic reticulum enlarged, microvillus shorted and lose. With the feeding time prolonging, mitochondrion swelled more seriously and became vacuoles in some part, and some mitochondrion dissolve and necrosis and microvillus lose largely. 3. There was no or little expression of COX-2 in normal control rats' gastric mucosa. On the contrary, in CAG model rats' gastric mucosa, large amount of expression in 12 wk while CAG was formed. With the feeding time prolonging, expression of COX-2 kept on increasing, PEG2 level increased in 12 wk and has significant difference compare with normal group. In 32 wk PEG2 level remain increased. Conclusions 1. The ultrostructure injury of gastric mucosa appeared earlier during the process of CAG formation carused by high salt hot water feeding. And with time prolonging, every organelle injury aggravated. 2. COX-2 appeared over expression in CAG rat gastric mucosa, and company with increased of PEG2. With the aggravation of atrophy, expression of COX-2 increased durative and PEG2 level increased correspondently.The study suggested that CAG caused by high salt hot water has large potential canceration probability. 3 .

Intragastric pH over 24 hours was recorded from morning of the second day. Blood CYP2C19 genotyping of each patient was detected by PCR-restriction enzyme analysis. Results 1. In Rab group, the mean intragastric pH values of the PM, hetEM and homEM were 6.3 \u00b1 0.1, 6.1 \u00b1 0.2, 6.0 \u00b1 0.1, no significant difference was observed among the three different genotype groups. In Ome group, they were 6.3 \u00b1 0.1, 5.9 \u00b1 0.2, 5.6 \u00b1 0.3. The differences were significant (P < 0.05). 2.

The reason was that big difference existed in homEM type between Rab (6.0 \u00b1 0.1) than Ome (5.6 \u00b1 0.3) group. 3. Nocturnal acid break through (NAB) occurred in 3 patients of each group. The sustaining time of NAB in Rab group was shorter than that of Ome group (2.6 \u00b1 0.2 vs. 3.4 \u00b1 0.6 h) (p < 0.05). Conclusions 1.The effect of Rab on control of intragastric pH was less affected by an individual's CYP2C19 status. 2.

Objective To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dimethicone and calcium carbonate on the treatment of intestinal distension in patients with functional dyspepsia. Methods By using a randomized and controlled clinical trial, the functional dyspepsia patients were divided into drug group (n = 27) and placebo group (n = 27). The changes of symptom score, the amount of intestinal gas and gas excretion in two groups were observed before and after the treatment. Outcome measurement was assessed at baseline and 1 week after treatment. Results After 1 week, treatment with dimethicone and calcium carbonate significantly improved symptoms (abdominal distention, early satiety, abdominal pain and belching) compared with that of baseline. Compared with placebo, dimethicone and calcium carbonate could significantly decrease the symptom scores, the amount of intestinal gas and increase the gas excretion (0.65 \u00b1 0.61 vs 1.83 \u00b1 0.49, 45 \u00b1 21 vs 117 \u00b1 40, 13 \u00b1 4 vs 8 \u00b1 3, P < 0.01). Total efficacy rate of dimethicone and calcium carbonate and placebo were 85% and 35%), respectively, with a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.01). Side-effect of dimethicone and calcium carbonate was mainly constipation (5%), but most of the patients could endure. Conclusion Dimethicone and calcium carbonate can reduce the amount of intestinal gas and improve the symptoms caused by overful gas. Objective Clinic operation and experiment have proved that Berberine can increase the density of blood medicine of Ciclosporin a, but the specific mechanism has not been known till now. The experiment observed the change of density of blood medicine and parameters related to electrogastrointestinalgram after the health volunteers took Ciclosporin a, and jointly took Ciclosporin A and Berberine, and discussed the effect of Berberine and Ciclosporin a on the density of blood medicine of Ciclosporin a from the perspective of electrogastrointestinalgram physiology. Method Choose 6 health volunteers, and respectively make a record of electrogastrointestinalgram after they have took Ciclosporin a, and jointly took Ciclosporin a and Berberine before taking medicine. At the same time, test the blood medicine density of Ciclosporin a., and discuss the relativity of blood medicine of Ciclosporin A and relevant parameters of electrogastrointestinalgram by the means of medical statistics. Conclusion The effect on electrogastrogram after taking Ciclosporin A is the apparent decrease of main frequency, with the same after the joint taking Berberine and Ciclosporin a, which indicates that taking Ciclosporin a has apparent effect on electrogastrogram and Berberine can strengthen this effect. In terms of the electrical movement, the main effect after taking Ciclosporin a is the apparent decrease of peak range, and taking additional Berberine strengthens the change, which shows the slowing down of electrical movement ahead and the increase of re-absorption of medicine in intestines. Therefore, Ciclosporin a itself has some effect on electrogastrogram movement, while Berberine can strengthen the effect, which may increase the blood medicine density of Ciclosporina. Materials and Methods 56 patients with histologically confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma (GC case group) and 56 healthy persons (control group), matched by age, sex, smoking, dietary habits and family history of cancer were studied. Genomic DNA samples were assayed for restriction fragment length polymorphisms in the CYP2E1 by PCR amplification followed by digestion with endonuclease PstI, and GSTT1 genes was detected by multiplex PCR. Results The frequency of CYP2E1 C 1 /C 1 genotype was 69.6% in GC group and 46.4% in control group, with a statistically significant difference (c 2 = 6.27; p < 0.05, OR = 1.915, 95% CI = 1.051-3.489). The frequency of GSTT1 null genotype was higher among GC group (60.7%) than among control group (46.4%), but the difference was not statistically significant (c 2 = 2.30; 0.1 < p < 0.25, OR = 1.783, 95% CI = 0.842-3.777). Furthermore, a joint effect of the CYP2E1 genotype and the GSTT1 genotype on the cancer risk was observed, showing GSTT1 non-null genotype/C 1 /C 2 or C 2 /C 2 genotype is lower than the other among GC group (c 2 = 6.23; 0.01 < p < 0.025, OR = 0.302, 95% CI = 0.114-0.796). The GSTT1 null genotype/C 1 /C 1 genotype among GC group was significantly higher than the other (c 2 = 3.98; p < 0.05, OR = 2.250, 95% CI = 1.007-5.026). Conclusions CYP2E1 C 1 /C 1 genotype is associated with gastric cancer and individuals who carried the C 1 allele have higher risk of developing GC than those with the C 1 /C 2 or C 2 /C 2 genotype. GSTT 1 null genotype doesn't increase the risk of GC. Combined analysis of polymorphisms showed that GSTT1 non-null genotype/C 1 /C 2 or C 2 /C 2 genotype was protective factor of GC and GSTT1 null genotype/C 1 /C 1 genotype was risk factor of GC. That is, individuals with both GSTT1 null genotype and CYP2E1 C 1 /C 1 genotype elevate the risk of GC.",

The plasma VEGF level is significantly higher in gastric cancer patients than in contrast. In this study, positive expression of tissue VEGF is found in 56.25% of patients with gastric cancer, which is detected mainly in gastric cancer cytoplasm or membrane instead of in normal vascular endothelial cells. There is a significantly positive correlation between the plasma and tissue VEGF level. The abovementioned three indices have certain correlation with the clinic and pathologic materials of gastric cancer. When the expression of CK20 in peripheral blood act as dependent variable, the expression of VEGF in tissue is the only risk factor to finally enter Logistic regression equation with statistical significance. In the cases with positive expression of peripheral blood CK20, when distance metastasis is used as dependent variable, plasma VEGF level is the only covariate that can enter regression equation with obvious risk tendency, but no statistical significance. Conclusion It is likely that higher tissue and plasma VEGF level can promote early occurrence of gastric cancer peripheral blood micrometastasis and to form the distance metastasis by micrometastasis cells. It is likely to be the important and independent risk factors that can predict gastric cancer patients' prognosis.",

Methods According to susceptibility results by the Epsilometer test (E-test) and agar dilution test and genotypes and subtypes of 109 H. pylori strains isolated from three People diagnosed chronic gastritis and peptic ulcers with endoscopy and histology examination in Yunnan, 12 strains of non-multiple, sensitive H. pylori (5 Han People strains, 3 Bai People strains, 4 Naxi People strains) were selected.The inoculum approximating 10 9 CFU/ml after a 72-h growth of each H. pylori strain was transferred onto agar containing one-half the MIC of metronidazole. Surface growth after 72 h of incubation was transferred onto the medium containing twice the prior concentration of metronidazole. These plates were then incubated for 72 h. This process was repeated serially until no growth occurred or a predefined maximum antibacterial concentration of metronidazole (8 mg/ml) was reached. Isolates were also transferred at least three times on metronidazole-free medium, followed by a redetermination of the MIC with the agar dilution test to asses the stability of the selected resistance. Extracted DNA of metronidazole sensitive and resistant pairs of H. pylori strains before and after induced, amplified rdxA gene by PCR and sequenced rdxA gene. The sequences were analyzed with DS Gene 1.1 Trial (Accelrys Inc. USA, 2002) software. Results 4 of 12 H. pylori strains were induced successfully with metronidazole whose MICs increased by 16 ~64 times, from 1 4 mg/ml to 32 ~128 mg/ml. Strains were transferred three times on metronidazole-free medium and the MICs redetermined were the same as those after induced. In three pairs of metronidazole sensitive and resistant H. pylori strains (1-170S, 1-170R, 3-108S, 3-108R, 4-123S, 4-123R), two fragments overlapped 105 bp were amplified by PCR and sequenced 491 bp and 405 bp respectively that constituted a total of 789 bp that contained the entire rdxA gene of 630 bp. Compared with that of standard H. pylori strain 26695, DNA sequences of rdxA gene of H. pylori strains from Yunnan had 95.2% ~94.8% identity. Identity was 97.6% ~97.3% compared rdxA gene sequences of H. pylori strains from three People. H. pylori strains from three People contained mutations within their rdxA genes. The type and position of mutation in rdxA gene were diverse. Base substitution, deletion, insertion, missense, frameshift, nonsense mutation at different position could be detected in different H. pylori strains and some H. pylori strain contained multiple mutations. Induced with metronidazole of 1 ~8 mg/ml concentration, H. pylori strain 3-108R from Bai People generated transition mutation at one position, while base mutation at 4 positions in H. pylori strain 1-170R from Han People were all transversion mutation. Conclusions Metronidazole resistant H. pylori strains from Yunnan was mainly due to mutational inactivation of rdxA gene. RdxA gene mutation in metronidazole resistant H. pylori strain from Han People in Yunnan was distinct.",

To make clear the association between the differences of the virulence factors of helicobacter pylori and helicobacter pylori related diseases, so as to contribute to the proper clinical therapy for the different conditions. This subject observed the mixed infections of helicobacter pylori strains in Bai, Naxi, and Han Group which contain multiple vacA m-region subtype and/or iceA mixed genotype, to research their roles in pathogenicity. Methods Chose patients who had upper gastrointestinal symptoms and accept the gastroscopy examination in Yunnan Province from August of 2000 to August of 2001. All the patients were diagnosed through gastroscopy, urease test and pathology. Gastric mucosa specimen of 444 cases was collected, including 165 of Han, 117 of Bai, 162 of Naxi.When patients were diagnosed as peptic ulcers or chronic gastritis during the course of gastroscopy examination, 1 gastric biopsy specimen was taken for the rapid urease test (RUT). If the RUT was positive, another 2 specimens were taken from the same position for the use of culture of helicobacter pylori and histopathology diagnosis. Helicobacter pylori were isolated and cultured; the gastric biopsy specimens were used for the evaluation of inflammation degree and inflammation activity grades after HE stain, and for the evaluation of the density degree of helicobacter pylri embedment in the gastric mucosa after Wathing-Starry stain. The inflammation degree of gastric mucosa and the density degree of helicobacter pylori in the gastric mucosa were classified as negative, mild, median and severe according to the standard of chromic gastritis histology put forward on Gastroenterology Conference of Chinese Medical Association, May, 2000. The histopathological diagnosis was made by two senior doctor of pathology department who were not informed the surrounding of the helicobacter pylori strains previously. All the collected data were dealed via SPSS Ver 10.0. P < 0.05 was regarded as having statistical significance. Results Mixed infections were defined as containing multiple vacA m-region subtype and/or iceA mixed genotype. Thirty-four (31.2%) of 109 cases had mixed infections. The occurrence rate of iceA mixed genotye was significantly higher than the rate of multiple vacA mregion subtype (P < 0.05). The mixed infection rate of the Bai Group (67.7%, 21/31) was significantly higher than Naxi Group (20.0%, 9/45) (c 2 = 17.511, P < 0.001) and Han Group (12.1%, 4/33) (c 2 = 20.774, P < 0.001), but there was no significant difference between Naxi Group and Bai Group (c 2 = 0.851, P > 0.05). For the rate of the mixed infection of iceA1 + iceA2, Bai Group (61.3%, 19/31) was significantly higher than Naxi Group (17.8%, 8/45) (c 2 = 15.172, P < 0.001) and Han Group (9.1%, 3/33) (c 2 = 19.073, P < 0.001), but there was no statistic significance between Naxi and Han Group. Among the 34 cases of mixed infection, 16 were with peptic ulcer and 18 were with chronic gastritis. There were 8 cases (23.5%) containing both the multiple vacA m-rigion subtype and the iceA mixed genotype, and the occurrence rate in the cases with peptic ulcer (43.8%, 7/16) was higher than with chronic gastritis (5.6%, 1/18) (c 2 = 6.868, P = 0.014 < 0.05). There were 4 cases (11.8%) only containing the multiple vacA m-region subtype, and there was no significant difference (c 2 = 0.016, P > 0.05) between the occurrence rate of chronic gastritis group (11.1%, 2/18) and peptic ulcer group (12.5%, 2/16). There were 22 cases (64.7%) only containing iceA mixed genotype; the occurrence rate of chronic gastritis group (83.3%, 15/18) was higer than the one of peptic ulcer group (43.8%, 7/16) (c 2 = 5.812, P = 0.016 < 0.05). Conclusions In this study, helicobacter pylori strains were isolated by smearing the homogenized gastric mucosa specimens onto the plate culture median, and when the subculture was performed afer 5 to 7 days, clones of the bacterium were swept and collected from the plate instead of selecting the single clone. Therefore, mixed infections could be regarded existing in one gastric mucosa specimen when multiple vacA m-region subtype and/or iceA mixed genotype were detected by PCR. Mixed infection rate are various in different countries and districts. Mixed infection of multiple vacA m-region subtype and/or iceA mixed genotype detected in helicobacter pylori strains has a polymorphism in Bai, Naxi and Han Group in Yunnan Province. Multiple vacA mregion subtype is sensitive for the determination of the mixed infection in Han Group, while the iceA mixed genotype is sensitive for the determination of mixed infection in Bai and Naxi Group. The pathogenicity of helicobacter pylori is associated with multiple vacA mregion subtype and iceA mixed genotype in Yunnan strains and with multiple vacA m-region subtype in Bai Group strains. In Yunnan helicobacter pylori strains, iceA mixed genotype is sensitive for the determination of mixed infection.",

Fasting diet and water is 12 hour before pouring gaster and 2 hour after pouring gaster. after Fasting diet and water for 24 hour, all mice are to be sacrificed after the last pouring gaster in 4 weeks. After being sacrificed, the gastric mucous morphology is observed, and is applied to helicobacter pylori culture, RUT-test, warthin-starry stain.The helicobacter pylori density is evalued according to the standard formulated by the gastroenterology assiciation of C.M.A in May, 2000. Film readed by advanced professional doctor in pathology who do not know the blackgroud of strain. Results (1) in the patho-model group, gastric mucous of all mice (10) are positive by RUT; in the normal control group, gastric mucous of all mice (10) are negative by RUT. (2) in the patho-model group, the growth of pink helicobacter pylori colony are finded in gastric mucous of all mice (10), which are evalued by form of colony, smear and stain, three-enzyme test (urase, catalase, oxidase); in the normal control group, the growth of helicobacter pylori colony are not finded in gastric mucous of all mice (10) which grow a few of mixed bacter. (3) in the patho-model group, the distribution of helicobacter pylori mainly exist epithelium mucosae cell and the up-half part of gastric pit and glandular cavity. Compared the patho-model group to the normal control group, c 2 = 20.000, P = 0.000. Before animal model established, the mixed bacter, including Flectobacillus, is cleared in gaster by trigeminy therapy. Subsequently, the mixed liquid, consisted of many kinds of high concentration H. pylori mouse-passaged strains (from yunnan), pour continuously mice gaster for infecting BALA/C mice gaster. the establishment of animalmodel use H. pylori mouse-passaged strains who have been cultured before, those strains have gone through a course of hostadaptation, which make infection rate achieve 100% (those strains infect BALA/C mice gaster). Conclusions first time, in internal and abroad, under normal raising condition, the H. pylori mouse-passaged strains (from yunnang)-BALA/C mice model is established. the its forte is: 1, the H. pylori mouse-passaged strains (from yunnang), which are consisted of many kinds of high concentration strains (CagA and VacA genes are positive), easily plant BALA/C mice gaster. 2, under normal raising condition, the establishment of helicobacter pylori-BALA/C mice model is good for study related to helicobacter pylori, and can save research funds and reduce experiment cost and easily general-ize. 3, the culture of H. pylori mouse-passaged strains utilize strains in Yunnan which can evaluate the rate of planting in environment concerned therapy. The helicobacter pylori-BALA/C mice model can better apply to the study of pathogenicity, the therapeutic effect of drug, vaccine and so on. Objectives Yunnan province lies in southwest frontier to YunNan-KweiChow Plateau in our country. and the climates, geograhpy and environments are complex, it's a place owning many minorities (26 minorities), so the living tradition and habits are different. In our past institiute we found that Helicobacter pylori infection rate of natural crowds is 51.1% in Yunnan distinct, which belong to the region of high genesis. It is essential to investigate and study the distribution of Helicobacter pylori genotype in different groups. Our study is aim to discuss the distribution of Helicobacter pylori vacA, cagA, iceA1, iceA2 and babA2 strains of Han, Bai and Naxi Group in Yunnan and the difference between the three groups. Methods Selected patients' related syndrom of upper digestive tract confirmed by gastroendoscopy, urease test and pathohistology between 2000.8-2000.8 in Yunnan. Collected gastric mucosa specimens, which is 444 cases in all included 165 from Han group, 117 from Bai group, 162 from Naxi group. One specimen was obtained for rapid urease test from 2-3 cm to greater curvature of gastric antrum by aseptic biopsy forceps once the patient was confirmed as chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer by gastroendoscopy. Another 2 specimens were processed for culture histopathology and conservation if urease test is positive. Prepare the DNA templatel of HP stains. VacA gene subtypes and CagA, CagE, iceA and babA gene were detected by PCR. Using spss for windows ver 10.0 statistics software package to analyze data. Results were considered significant at p < 0.05. Results (1) The vacA genes were all detected in the 109 Helicobacter pylori strains.

No correlation was found between expression level of PTEN and patients' sex and age (P > 0.05). Expression level of PTEN protein decreased in III, II stage of gastric cancer compared to II, I stage of gastric cancer (P < 0.01). The positive rate of PTEN oncoprotein was lower in poor differentiation tissues than in well differentiation tissues (P < 0.01) and was lower in gastric cancer with lymphnode metastasis than in thoes without lymphnode metastasis (P < 0.05).The deeper extent of invasiveness, the lower PTEN positive rate was. 2. The positive rate of MMP-9 was significantly higher in gastric cancer (73.7%) than in normal tissues (19.3%, P < 0.01), and with the development of tissue invasiveness, lymphnode metastasis and TNM stage, expression level of MMP-9 becomes higher. 3.

We present a case report of a young woman. Case and Methods A 23-years old woman was admitted to hospital with a 10 days history of generalized urticaria, abdominal painful spasms (tenesmus) but without changes of the alvus.These symptoms began after a dinner with fried fish. She was treated with corticosteroids and anti-histaminic therapy with partial benefit. On admission physical findings revealed the presence of generalized pruritic urticarial papules and hepato-splenomegaly. We did the blood exams and researched also the signs of inflammation, autoantibodies and hepatotrophic viruses' antibodies. Physical, chemical, bacteriological and cultural analysis of stool was done. We performed abdominal echography, barium enema X-rays of colon and colonscopy with biopsy. Results Erythrocytes sedimentation rate and reactive C protein were higher, with mild white blood cells elevation and pernicious anemia. Diagnostic for images confirmed mild hepato-splenomegaly without focal lesions. X-rays of the colon showed irregularity in filling up with barium. Colonscopy uncovered hyperaemic regions and presence of haemorrhagic soffusions. Endoscopy biopsy specimens were obtained from patient, during the exam, for histology. Histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. Conclusions Even if bloody and profuse diarrhea is a frequent symptom of ulcerative colitis, at the beginning can be absent and the patient may present mild or atypical symptoms. In particular skin rashes, as a first manifestation, may occur when the immune system triggers inflammation in other parts of body and it could support the hypothesis that the cause of ulcerative colitis may be an overactive immune response.",

Methods There are 58 patients whose ages ranged from 18 to 70 (23 males and 35 females) in the investigation. They have had constipation for more than three months, and they all accord with the qualifications in what follows.1. Less than 3 stools per week.2. Straining and/or lumpy or hard stools and/or sensation of an rectal obstruction. (No. 2 must happen at least 25% of one year.) 3. Excluding the organic disease through examinations. Healthy 32 men that selected according to age, sex, vocation, etc, are regarded as contrast. Psychological evaluation is taken by using of SCL-90, HAMD, HAMA, and the vocation, smoking, insomnia, dietary and negative events in FC group are recorded. Result The total mark and various factors marks in HAMD of 58 patients in FC group are higher than that of the contrast group obviously (P < 0.01), especially for the factors such as anxiety, depression and somatization. The HAMD mark in FC group is 15.1 \u00b1 4.27, and that of the contrast group is 6.67 \u00b1 3.03. The HAMA mark in FC group is 9.82 \u00b1 4.2, whereas that of the contrast group is 2.46 \u00b1 2.96. The difference between the two groups is obvious (p < 0.05). It is shown in the study that there are 24.14% of the patients associated with obvious depression and 18.97% associated with anxiety in FC group, and 8 patients (13.79%) are both suffered from depression and anxiety. Furthermore, the investigation indicates that 48.9% of the cases including females, insomniacs, brainworkers and others who meet with negative events are accompanied with depression and anxiety. It is irrespective of smoking and dietary (P > 0.01). Conclusions FC is a common disorder that causes a lot of trouble to patients and has a pronounced effect on the quality of life. With the development of the society, the competition is more and more fierce and the dietary ingredient is changing.These lead to a high incidence of constipation. The investigations of constipation are focused on colonic transmit time, dysfunction of anorectal sphincter and anal allergy at the present time. People also pay attention to the emotional stress system and the gastrointestinal ataxic movement. This investigation shows that there is a visible psychosocial abnormality in patients of FC, especially for depression, anxiety and somatization. The incidence of FC is increasing obviously in the patients accompanied with negative events such as insomnia, psychological trauma and stimulation and brainworkers. Depression may aggravate constipation, while severe FC could lead to the appearance and aggravation of depression and anxiety. Clinical research and practice prove that people's relation between psychology and physiology is inseparable. The emotional stressors affect brain-gut interaction and gestrointestinal movement through autonomic nervous system and neuroendocrine system. So routine arrangement and psychotherapy should be taken. Normal defecation reflex will be set up with the essential antidepressant and antianxiety therapy, and the quality of life will be improved.",

Doppler sonographic machines (HP-sonos-4500 and HID-5000SonoCT) were used.The diameter and the timed-average velocity of the three vessels, portal vein (PV), splenic vein (SV) and left gastric vein (LGV) were calculated. Minwhile the flow direction was observed. Flow volume and congestive index of portal vein (CI) were calculated. Results 1. Compared with control group, the diameter, flow volume and CI of the portal vein; the diameter, flow volume of the splenic vein, the ratio of SV to PT flow volume and the diameter of the left gastric vein were significantly increased in cirrhotics with portal hypertension group (P < 0.05). 2. The diameter, flow volume and CI of the portal vein haqd no difference between EVB group and NEVB group. The diameter, flow volume of the splenic vein and the ratio of SV to PT flow volume were significantly higher in EVB group than in NEVB group (P < 0.05). 3. In all healthy controls, the blood flow direction in the LGV was hepatopetal; by contrast, in 36 of 39 (92.31%) patients with EVB, the flow direction was hepatofugal, but the prevalence of hepatofugal in EVB group was significantly higher in NEVB group (P < 0.05). In patients with EVB, the flow hepatofugal velocity of LGV was significantly higher than in NEVB group, but there was no difference in flow volume among both groups. 4. The hepatofugal of LGV as a parameter was associated with 92.31% sensitivity, 75.68% specificity, and 84.21% accuracy in distinguishing patients with EVB from all cirrhotics. When hepatofugal flow velocity of LGV was more than 16 cm/s, it was associated with 71.79% sensitivity, 91.89% specificity, and 81.58% accuracy in distinguishing patients with EVB from all cirrhotics. And the two parameters were better than others. Conclusions Color Doppler flow imaging provided useful prognostic information regarding the risk of current hemorrhage in cirrhotics with portal hypertehsion. Hepatofugal blood flow in the left gastric vein and increased hepatofugal flow velocity (>=16 cm/s) may be the most valuable parameters.",

Conclusions We still need to sum up, analysis and evaluate the specific symptoms of IBS; under this condition, it is very important to choose suitable diagnostic criteria according to different require and different object. We also need to select and appraise the screening work-up to eliminate organic disease. Abnormal biliary motility and infection of intestines aren't contradictive with IBS; hemorrhoids (at least serious ones) patients may be diagnosed IBS only if no improvement gained after therapy; Patients who had positive history of operation on abdominal region should be more cautious to be made IBS diagnosis. So it is suggested that Manning criteria and Rome criteria are most common to diagnose IBS at presen.

Conclusions The patients with steroid refractory ulcerative colitis can get a good initial response, with rapid resolution of their symptoms. The patients given cyclosporine intravenously showed rapid improvement within 5 days.This means that short-term efficacy using cyclosporine A for UC patients was striking.

After treated with indomethacin orally every day for 4 weeks (3 mg/kg/d), animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Immunohistochemical staining was employed to determine microvessel density (MVD) and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) expression in tumor tissues. Results Indomethacin, a non-selective COX inhibitor, significantly decreased the viability of HCT116 cells in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05), with 50% inhibition at approximate 318.2 \u00b1 12.7 mM. Growth of HCT116 tumor was significantly suppressed by indomethacin. The tumor volume (mm 3 ) was 458.89 \u00b1 32.07 in the treated group versus 828.21 \u00b1 31.59 in the control group (P < 0.05). The MVD of the treated and control groups was 19.50 \u00b1 5.32 and 37.40 \u00b1 4.93 respectively (P < 0.001). The VEGF expression of the treated and control groups was 1.19 \u00b1 0.17 and 1.90 \u00b1 0.48, respectively (P < 0.01). MVD and VEGF expression in the treated tumor tissue noticeably declined compared to the controls. There was a positive correlation between decrease of VEGF and decrease of MVD (r s = 0.714, P < 0.05). No obvious toxicity was observed in nude mice.

Result Our study results in the following findings. From the perspective of symptoms by the patients' complaints, even though bloody stool is among the symptoms complained from both patients, the complaints from the patients of colorectal cancer is much higher. From the perspective of area of the illness, the highest occurrence appears in the section from rectum to colon for both cases.The pathological study shows there exists a cause and effect relationship. Therefore, the 2 illnesses are closely related. The age distribution study shows that it occurs mostly between 40 to 70 years' old, but colorectal polyps could be detected much earlier than colorectal cancer. It indicates that there is a time difference between the two illnesses. Conclusion Great importance should be attached to the symptoms of bloody stool by patients' complaints. The early endoscopic treatment can effectively reduce the chance and prevent the occurrence of cancerous growth in colorectal. In addition, regular visit and inspection of patients of both illnesses, especially after surgical operation, is highly recommended.",

Antisense oligonucleotide of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was used to block the expression of FAK. Invasiveness and FAK tyrosine phosphorylation of colorectal cancer cells were detected by Boyden chamber and immunoblotting, respectively. Results An increased invasiveness was induced by different concentrations of gastrin in Colo320. Stable transfection of CCK 2 receptor amplified this increase and incubation with 1 mM L-365, 260, a specific CCK 2 receptor antagonist, completely inhibited the effect of gastrin. Meanwhile, an elevated FAK tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr-397) was observed after treated with different concentrations of gastrin. FAK antisense completely blocked the increase of invasiveness in Colo320 cells. Conclusions Gastrin can promote invasiveness of colorectal cancer through activation of FAK pathway.",

Nevertheless, reasonably successful treatment options are available to many elderly UC patients, given that an alert and careful diagnostician identifies the problem.We aim to study and analysis the occurrence and clinical features of UC patients in the elderly (over 60 years old) and the pre-elderly (between 45-59 years old). Methods All patients hospitalized with UC at Huadong Hospital during 1998 and 2003 were evaluated. Among all the 45 patients, 7 are the pre-elderly and 15 the elderly. Patients were retrospectively evaluated by general information such as gender concerning diagnosis, clinical manifestation, colonoscopy reports and medical therapy.",

All the above were comparable among the elderly, the pre-elderly and patients under 45. Results History from 45 patients was reassessed. Among all the patients, abdomen ache, abdominal distension, diarrhea and bloody stools are very familiar. Diarrhea, bloody stools and weight loss are most frequent in the pre-elderly, while the elderly is second. Fever is most common in the elderly. According to the Truelove Criteria, mild degree in the elderly, pre-elderly and under 45 are respectively 18.8%, 26.5% and 57.4%, while moderate to intensive degree are 81.2%, 73.5% and 42.6%. 75.0% in the elderly were occurred in rectum, sigmoid and left colon with only 25.0% in pan-or extensive colon. The prevalence of pan-or extensive UC in the pre-elderly and under 45 are 41.4%, 34.8% each. Discussion UC, as a nonspecific inflammation of intestine, has an increase incidence in Chinese mainland these decades. The process is chronic and recurrent with unknown pathogenesis. Our research shows the difference among the elderly, the pre-elderly and fewer than 45. 1. Gender difference: among the pre-elderly UC patients and under 45, male are more than female with the proportion is 17 : 13, in accordance with other reports. However in the elderly, female patients are much more than male with the proportion is 4 : 11, which is greatly different with west countries. 2. Clinical symptoms: in the elderly and pre-elderly patients, symptoms such as abdomen ache, diarrhea and bloody stools are much more common than the under 45. However the conditions in the elderly are the most serious, because of the long history, relapse of illness and the bad state of the elderly. 3. Colonoscopy characters: in the elderly, most have disease confined to the rectum and sigmoid colon, while in the pre-elderly and under 45, the number of extensive disease increases. 4. Therapies: many patients still use traditional medicine, such as SASP and steroids. Although the states in the elderly and the preelderly are worse, all cases remit with SASP or steroids, while 2 cases in the under 45 have to be treated with immunosuppressor. Such difference maybe due to the pathogenesis in different age group.",

Materials and Methods Cultured HT-29 Colon cancer cells were divided into two groups (DCA, DCA and berberine). The effect of berberine on cell proliferation was studied using the method of MTT. RT-PCR was applied to measure COX-2 mRNA transcription level. Cellular immunochemical stain (CIS) was applied, using a mouse anti-human COX-2 monoclonal antibody to label COX-2 protein expression. Radio immunoassay (RIA) was applied to assess PGE2 level in the culture medium. Results 200 mM DCA induced cell proliferation and COX-2 mRNA transcription. The inhibitory rate of 1 mM berberine in DCA induced cell proliferation was 7.38%. Berberine at concentration higher than 1 mM inhibited DCA induced COX-2 mRNA transcription at 6 hours. Berberine at concentration higher than 1 mM inhibited DCA induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 synthesis at 12-48 hours. 20 mM berberine led to maximal induction of COX-2 protein expression and COX-2 mRNA transcription at 48 and 12 hours, respectively.",

Method Expression of survivin protein was investigated using immunohistochemical staining method in 12 cases normal colon tissues and 79 cases colon adenocarcinoma tissues without the history of radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Results Expression of survivin was detected in 78.5% (62/79) colon adenocarcinoma, higher than in the tissues adjacent to tumor nests, which was 32.9% (26/79). In contrast, normal colon tissues did not express survivin. There was no relationship between survivin protein expression and age, sex, blood group, serum CEA level, lymph-node metastasis, histological grade, infiltration degreed and Dukes stage (P > 0.05). When 25% was used as the cut-off point of high and low expression of survivin, the 3-year overall survival rate of low expression group was much higher than the high expression group (63.56% vs 39.96%, P = 0.0405). Cox proportional hazards model analysis showed that Dukes stage and high expression of survivin were the only two prognosis factors influenced the survival times (Wald values were 25.636 and 5.853 respectively, P values were 0.000 and 0.016 respectively). Conclusions There is a high expression level of survivin in colon adenocarcinoma, survivin may play an important role in the tumoregenesis and development of colon adenocarcinoma. Over expression of this protein was related with poor prognosis and it might become a potential prognostic index.",

Peak prevalence of CD occurred among the age groups 20-50 years, and the overall male : female ratio of CD was 1.67. Abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody and mucus stool, intestinal obstruction and constipation are the commonest symptoms of CD. Cobble stone sign, segmental lesions, fistula and extraintestinal diseases were not common. During hospitalization a colonoscopy was performed in 348 cases (61.75%), Intestinal x-ray examination performed in 221 cases (42.91%). The behaviour of CD was stricturing in 92 cases (17.86%), penetrating in 32 cases (6.21%). The location of CD was only ileal in 146 cases (28.35%), ileocolonic in 162 cases (31.46%), colonic in 187 cases (36.31%), recto-anal in 20 cases (3.88%).

Methods Acute colitis was induced by giving 3% DSS orally. 18 male rats were randomized into DSS control group (n = 10) and normal control group (n = 8). The rats in DSS control group drank 3% DSS solution from day 1 to day 7. The rats in normal control group was drank water normally from day 1 to day 7, Diarrhea and bloody stool as well as colonic histology were observed. The levels of colonic tissue histamine, trumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) were determined by fluorimetry and ELISA, and the expression of IMMC in colonic tissue was detected by histochemical stain method. Results Compared with normal control group, the inflammatory symptoms and histological damages of colonic mucosa in DSS group were significantly showed. The level of histamine in colonic tissue was significantly reduced (p < 0.05), the tissul levels of TNF-a, PGE 2 and the expression of IMMC in colonic tissule were significantly elevated (P < 0.05 -P < 0.01).

Their clinical situations, radiological examinations and pathologic features were compared. Results In 12 patients with CD, mean age was 40 \u00b1 12 yrs (21 6 5 yrs), 11 were male and one female. In six patients with TB, mean age was 49 \u00b1 19 yrs (32 ~83 yrs), One was male and five female.There is a significant difference in sex (P < 0.05). The most common symptom was abdominal pain in both CD (11/12) and TB (6/6). Other common symptoms were change in bowel habits (10/12), fever (9/12), abdominal mass (5/12) in CD and change in bowel habits (2/6), abdominal mass (2/6), and fever (1/6) in TB. There is a significant difference in change bowel habits and fever (P < 0.05).The existence of pulmonary tuberculosis and complications were helpless for the differential diagnosis. The enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes were found in 10/12 cases of CD and in 5/6 cases of TB; which diameter ranged from 0.2 cm to 1.5 cm in CD and 1.5 cm to 2.5 cm in TB. Atypical micro-granulomas were found in only one case, and no typical granulomas were found in mesenteric lymph node of CD cases. Epithelioid granulomas were found in all cases of TB (6/6), which commonly distributed in submucosa and the margin of ulcer. The mesenteric lymph node granulomas were found in 5/5 cases of TB. There were transmural inflammations in Crohn's disease. Conclusions The enlargement of mesenteric lymph nodes is more obviously in TB. CT scan might be valuable in differential diagnosis. It is helpful for TB diagnosis if epithelioid granulomas are found. Deeply multi-biopsy from the margin of the ulcer under endoscopy are benefitial for diagnosis.",

ESAP was defined as presence of organ failure within the initial 72 hours of the disease. Results Fourteen patients had ESAP. Compared with 8 patients without organ failure (SAP group), patients with ESAP were older (mean age 57 vs. 45) and had more disease histories. As for etiology, alcohol was less common in ESAP group, while all 3 patients with hyperlipemia had ESAP. Patients with ESAP more frequently developed progressive organ failures. The incidence of infected pancreatic necrosis was higher in ESAP (43% vs. 25%). More ESAP patients had surgical interventions than SAP patients (36% vs. 13%). All 5 deaths were occurred in ESAP group. Three patients died of MOF, the other 2 patients died of local and/or systemic infections. Conclusions ESAP is more common in elder patients with other organ disease histories. ESAP is characterized by a complicated clinical course and high mortality.

Department of Gastroenterology, Nanfang Hospital, First Military Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China Aim To observe the expression of early growth response 1 (Egr-1) and tissue factor (TF) in the cearulein-induced experimental pancreatitis in rats, and to explore their significance. Methods The rat experimental pancreatitis was induced by highdoes of Cearulein. The changes of Egr-1 mRNA and protein in pancreata were recorded by quantitative PCR and western blotting. The localization of Egr-1 protein in acinar cells was visualized by immunohistochemistry. The TF mRNA levels were also measured by quantitative PCR. High-dose of bombesin stimulated rats were as control. Results The Egr-1 mRNA was rapidly increased in the pancreas when stimulated by high-dose of cearulein, with the peak level at 30 min after stimulation. However, the Egr-1 protein band was visualized by western blotting at the peak level in 2 h after stimulation. The immunohistochemistry showed that almost every acinar cell in pancreas were Egr-1 positive, especially in the nucleus. In line with Egr-1 activation, TF mRNA level was shown in 1 h and went up steadily within 4 h after cearulein stimulation. Tiny Egr-1 mRNA expression was obsvered in bombesion stimulated rats. The Egr-1 protein and TF mRNA were not detected after stimulation of bombesion. Conclusion Egr-1 mRNA and protein were up-regulated in the early stage of pancreatitis. Egr-1, as a pro-inflammatory transcriptional factor, probably plays a very important role in the initiation of acute pancreatitis, to some extent, which may be mediated through up-regulation of TF exprssion.

Materials and Methods 12 mongrel pigs were randomly divided into 3 groups (n = 4 in each group). After the dissection of the animals of group A, the pig's pancreases were ablated directly from the surface of the organ by a HIFU probe. Extracorporeal HIFU ablation on the pancreases was applied through the skin of group B and C. The pigs of group B were killed immediately after sonication. Blood and urine amylases of the pigs of group C were tested before and on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th and 7th day after sonication. The pigs of group C were killed on the 7th day. The pancreases extracted from all animals were sent for examination of histology and electronic microscope. Results Steadily vital signs of all animals during sonication and good recovery after sonication in group C were observed. Precisely defined coagulation necrosis regions were found in all specimens.The necrosis volumes and shakes of 3 groups were not significantly different (p > 0.05). Coagulation nucleus pyknosis, cytochylema vacuolation and nucleus membrane disruption were seen soon after sonication. The levels of blood and urine amylases rose in the first 3 days after sonication, and then fell down to normal levels. Conclusions This study suggested the feasibility of HIFU in the treatment of pancreatic diseases in pigs. Objectives Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is characterized by high mortality. The aim of this study was to analyze a consecutive series of patients with SAP and to identify clinical characteristics and prognostic factors for mortality.",

Collected data included age, gender, etiology, scores of APACHE II at admission, local complications and organ / systemic complications. Results Out of a total of 268 acute pancreatitis, 94 developed SAP. The mean age of the SAP was 52; the commonest etiology was cholelithiasis; the mean score of APACHE II was 7.7; 54% developed necrosis; 25% developed abscess; 58% developed organ / systemic failure. A total of 23.4% (22/94) of the SAP died. Respiratory failure was the most common organ dysfunction (90.9%) in the deceased group, followed by cardiovascular failure (86.4%), renal failure (50.0%). In the deceased SAP, 90.9% (20/22) developed multiple organ / systemic failure, 18.1% (13/72) in the survivor. There were significant differences in age, score of APACHE II and the incidence of respiratory failure, renal failure, cardiovascular failure, hematological failure between deceased SAP group and SAP survivor. By multivariate Logistic regression analysis, independent prognostic factors for mortality were respiratory failure, cardiovascular failure and renal failure. Conclusions SAP is characterized by advanced age, high score of APACHE II, development of organ failure and mainly died due to multiple organ / systemic failure. In patients with SAP, failures of respiratory, cardiovascular and renal predict fatal outcome and thus should be paid more attention on clinical evaluation.",

Methods Rats were bilo-pancreatic ductly instilled 2, 4, 6,-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) in ethanol, and then injected daily i.p. with nedocromil sodium, a mast cell stabilizer, compound 48/80, a mast cell activator, or saline. Rats were sacrificed 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, 21 days, 28 days post-TNBS. Pancreatic inflammation and fibrosis were assessed by gross and histopathological evaluation. Pancreatic mast cells distribution, numbers and their state of activation (toluidine blue) were evaluated. The activation of PSCs was assessed by the expression of a-SMA through immunohistochemistry and Western Blot. The expression of angiotensin II receptors, type I collagen mRNA and TGF-b1 mRNA, which were the factors of fibrosis, were also assessed. Results Nedocromil reduced inflammation and fibrosis possibly by decreasing mast cell numbers and activation and consequent collagen production and PSCs activation and the expression of angiotensin II receptors. Compound 48/80 enhanced the severity of the disease by activating mast cells and increased collagen production and the expression of angiotensin II receptors and accelerates PSCs activation. Conclusions Mast cells are involved in the pancreatic inflammation and fibrosis of the TNBS-induced chronic pancreatitis rats.",

Methods Fifty C56BL/6J mice were randomly divided into AP group (n = 25) and normal group (n = 25). AP model was induced by seven times administration of cerulein (50 mg/kg \u00b7 body weight) intraperitoneal injection and was identified by elevated serum level of amylase and pathological changes of pancreas. Gene expression profiles of AP mice and normal mice were studied with oligonucleotide microarrays of 12479 full length mouse genes respectively for three times. Genes of which ratio average (RA) > 1.5 or RA < -1.5 were identified as changed genes. The relationship between changed genes and AP was analyzed. Results There were 166 changed genes expressed in AP group, of which 135 genes were up-regulated as well as 31 genes were downregulated. The significantly up-regulated genes expessed in AP included 5 transcription factor genes, 14 signal transduction genes, 10 inflammatory response genes, 5 cell cycle-regulated genes, 3 cell adhesion genes, 1 anion channel gene, 1 electron transport gene, 3 proteinase genes, 2 acute response protein genes, 3 transport protein genes, 4 metabolism enzyme genes, 2 superoxide metabolism genes, 1 endocytosis gene and 1 cytolysis gene. The significantly down-regulated genes expessed in AP included 2 transport protein genes, 2 signal transduction genes, 5 metabolism enzyme genes, 1 cell adhesion genes and 1 cytoskeleton gene.

AP model was induced by seven times administration of cerulein (50 mg/kg\u00b7body weight). LPS was given 6 hours after the first celulein injection. Cerulein was replaced by NS in NS + LPS group. 10 mice were randomly separated from every group to investigate mortality rate for 7 days. Another 5 mice were killed 12 hours after the first celulein injection. Liver, lung, kidney, pancreas and Blood serum were reserved to mesure pathological changes of each organ and serum levels of amylase (AMS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Gene expression profiles of leucocyte in NS + LPS (15 mg/kg) group and AP + LPS (15 mg/kg) group were studied with oligonucleotide microarrays of 12479 full length mouse genes respectively for three times to screen the different genes between two groups. Results Mortality rate in both NS + LPS group and AP + LPS group was increased with the elevation of LPS dose. Mortality rate in AP + LPS group was significantly less than that in NS + LPS group with equal LPS dose (P < 0.05). Serum level of LDH in AP + LPS group was significantly lower than that in NS + LPS group with equal LPS dose (P < 0.05), but serum level of AMS was significantly higher than that in NS + LPS group with equal LPS dose (P < 0.05). Histologically, the injury of lug, liver and kidney in AP + LPS group was relieved in comparison with that in NS + LPS group. The screening result of gene chip showed that inflammatory response genes, intracellular signal transduction genes and transcriptional regulation genes were down-regulated in AP + LPS (15 mg/kg) group vs NS + LPS (15 mg/kg) group. Conclusions Cerulein enhanced LPS tolerance in mice with AP. Its possible mechanism was that cerulein depressed the inflammatory signal pathway and thus down-regulated the expression of inflammatory medium.",

Methods 1. To examine the effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids on pancreatic cancer cell line, the proliferation rate of SW1990 cells treated with AA, DHA and EPA was analyzed through a colorimetric assay using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and a staining assay by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). An annexinV/propidium iodide (PI) assay by flow cytometry and in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasemediated dUTP-digoxigenin end labeling (TUNEL) assay were used to identify potential induction of apoptosis by the unsaturated fatty acids. 2. Expression of 5-LOX and 12-LOX in the tissue of human pancreatic carcinoma and the pancreatic cancer cell line was detected by using immunohistochemical (immunocytochemical) staining and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR). The correlation between AA treatment and the expression levels of LOXs was also investigated. 3. The effects of 5-LOX inhibitor (MK-886) and 12-LOX inhibitor (baicalein) on the proliferation of SW1990 cells were examined by MTT assay and BrdU staining. Flow cytometry and TUNEL assay were used to demonstrate induction of apoptosis by MK-886 and baicalein. Results 1. MTT assay and BrdU staining showed that AA had a stimulative effect on the growth of SW1990 cells while EPA and DHA had an inhibitory effect with a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometry and TUNEL assay proved that apoptosis of SW1990 cells cocultured with DHA or EPA lasting for 24 hours was increased markedly. 2. Both 5-LOX and 12-LOX are overexpressed in the tissue of human pancreatic carcinoma and the pancreatic cancer cell line. Furthermore, the level of expression could be up-regulated by AA treatment. 3. It was corroborated through MTT assay and BrdU staining that both MK-886 and baicalein suppressed the growth of SW1990 cells in a dose-dependent way.

After the treatment of ATRA, the apoptotic cells were detected by flow cytometry at the rate of 42.84 \u00b1 7.21% (24 h) and 56.29 \u00b1 2.54% (48 h) respectively, higher than untreated group (24 h: 14.26 \u00b1 1.16%, p < 0.01; 48 h: 18.08 \u00b1 0.75%, p < 0.01). Conclusions These data show that overexpression of AChE gene could increase the ATRA-induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells, but it is unclear how AChE contributes to the apoptotic process. We believe that further study for the role of AChE in apoptotic cells and the relationship between this apoptotic regulator and retinoids will provide important information for understanding the mechanisms of apoptosis.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was used to measure the acetylation status of p21 WAF1 promoter to explore the link between chromatin modification and gene expression. Results ATRA causes an accumulation of acetylated histone H3 in total cellular chromatin combined with the inhition of HDAC activity. ChIP experiments indicate that acetylated histone H3 are increased in both the proximal and distal promoter regions of the p21 WAF1 . Such changes in chromatin structure could play an important role of p21 WAF1 expression by ATRA. Conclusions This study demonstrates that ATRA can inhibit HDAC directly and furthermore increase the acetylation of H3-associated chromatin and alters p21 waf1 gene expression. The phenomena further indicate that ATRA can regulate the transcription level of certain genes through remodeling of chromatin structure.",

For the second round, rats were randomly given the duodenal stimulation of NaCl (0.86 mol/L) (n = 8) and 5-HT (10 -4 mol/L) (n = 8) and were collected bile-pancreatic juice every 15 min. Double-label immunohistochemistry was performed for NK1-R and for FOS in all kinds of groups. Otherwise BCA Protein Assay was applied to measure protein content of the pancreatic juice. Results NaCl (0.86 mol/L) and 5-HT (10 -4 mol/L) groups induced strong FOS like Immunoreactivity in NTS (P < 0.01), compared with the others. And NK1-R expressed the regions where FOS expression was enhanced by the duodenal stimulation in NaCl (0.86 mol/L) and 5-HT (10 -4 mol/L) groups.

In this study we detected if 1q LOH occurred in sporadic insulinomas and if it could be used as a genetic marker to differentiate malignant insulinomas from benign tumors. Materials and Methods DNA from microdissected normal and tumor tissue (8 malignant, 32 benign, from 38 patients) was extracted through digestion with proteinase K, and 1q allelotyping was performed by PCR with 15 microsatallite markers. Statistics was analyzed by using Fisher exact test. P \u00a3 0.05 was considered significant. Results LOH in 1q was found in 34 of 40 tumors (85%).

To identify changes in the gene expression patterns of pancreatic cancer cells during cell cycle arrest, we compared the gene expression profiles with or without ATRA treatment using a cDNA microarray GEArray TM Q. At the same time, the protein level of p21 waf1 , p27 kip1 and the acetylated histone H3 were assessed wth Western blotting at each time point to observe the link between chromatin modification and gene expression. Results ATRA induced a rapid arrest of synchronized cells in the G0/G1 phase, accompanied by a increasing Cyclin D1, Cyclin E1, Cdk2, Cdk4, P21/Waf1, p27Kip1, p16INK4 and p19-INK4D gene expression. The higher expression level of p21 waf1 , p27 kip1 protein induced by ATRA and an accumulation of acetylated histone H3 (lys 18) in total cellular chromatin were detected during the time course. Conclusions The therapeutic and preventive effects of retinoids in cancer are due to their ability to modulate the growth, differentiation, and survival or apoptosis of cancer cells.

Results The mean Hct in patients with SAP was 43.43 \u00b1 6.83, with no SAP was 39.14 \u00b1 4.71 (P = 0.000); the mean Hct in patients with systemic complications was 43.42 \u00b1 6.86, with no systemic complications was 39.39 \u00b1 4.96 (P = 0.002); with local complications was 42.19 \u00b1 7.11, with no local complications was 39.40 \u00b1 4.74 (P = 0.015). In the logistic regression analysis the Hct was a risk factor for SAP (P = 0.0007, OR = 1.1832, CI = 95% 1.07-1.30); systemic complications (P = 0.0029, OR = 1.1770, CI = 95% 1.057-1.310) and local complications (P = 0.0176, OR = 1.1055, CI = 95% 0.018-0.201). As Hct level \u226545%, sensitivity and specificity of Hct to detect SAP were 55.56% and 89.69%; systemic complications were 47.62% and 85.44%; local complications were 43.33% and 87.23% respectively. Conclusions In our study, initial Hct on admission is an early clinical predictor of SAP, systemic and local complications. However, considering its high NPV, a normal Hct value on admission may imply a low risk of developing SAP, systemic and local complications.",

The protein expression pattern of normal gastric tissue, primary gastric tumor tissue and corresponding metastatic tumor tissue was analysed using a proteomics approach. Proteins in the region of molecular masses of 15-75 kDa and isoelectric point of 3-7 were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and identified by peptide fingerprinting with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The overexpression of HSP27 in gastric cancer was further confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis of human gastric cancer samples. Results Twenty-seven spots corresponding to 25 proteins were identified to serve as landmarks for comparison between tissues. The identified proteins included cytoskeletal elements, stress associated proteins, proteins involved in signal transduction, cell proliferation and differentiation and metabolism. Eleven proteins were up-regulated and 2 proteins were down-regulated in tumor tissue when compared with normal tissue. Twelve proteins were up-regulated while 8 proteins were down-regulated in metastasis tumor by further comparison between primary and metastatic gastric tumor tissues. The overexpression of HSP27 was confirmed in a series of human gastric cancers. Conclusions Combining well-defined animal models with proteome analysis will improve our understanding of the fundamental changes that contribute to the process of carcinogenesis and the formation of metastasis in gastric cancer. Conclusions Our findings indicate that cathepsin D, an intracellular aspartyl protease, is expressed in both primary and metastatic colon cancer. Despite the fact that Cathepsin D was expressed at the invasion front, inhibition of Cathepsin D in colon cancer cells does not modulate invasion of cancer cells, supporting the hypothesis that the primary biological function of cathepsin D is the destruction of the extracellular matrix mediated by stromal cells which in turn may allow cancer cells to invade the surrounding structures and give them a growth-advantage. and growth promoting effect of CA9, AGS gastric cancer cells were transfected with CA9 cDNA. Gastric cancer cell lines were also treated with 5\u00a2-azadeoxycytidine to analyse methylation as a potential molecular mechanism underlying the loss of CA9 expression. Results In the non-cancerous tissues CA9 was strongly expressed with membranous localization. In contrast, CA9 expression was frequently lost in diffuse-and intestinal-type gastric cancers as well as cell lines (p < 0.001). However, gastric cancers that retained CA9 expression in the cancer cells, which was typically located at the invasion front of the cancers, exhibited a shorter post-operative survival (p = 0.028). In vitro analysis revealed that the loss or reduced CA9 expression in gastric cancer cell lines was restored after treatment with 5\u00a2-azadeoxycytidine and was associated with increased invasion (p < 0.01). Moreover, AGS cells transfected with CA9 exhibited significantly enhanced invasive growth and increased cell proliferation (p < 0.05). Conclusions While the loss of CA9 expression is frequent in gastric cancers by promoter hypermethylation, a subgroup of gastric cancers retain CA9 expression in the cancer cells at the invasion front which is associated with increased invasion and poor prognosis.",

Materials and Methods 16 SD rats weighing 250 ~300 g were selected and divided into two groups (8 in experimental group and 8 in control group) at random. After anesthetized the rat was equipped with pancreatic duct cannula inserted into the sphincter of Oddi. After a 30-min stabilization period, the combined bile-pancreatic secretions were collected every 15 min for 4 times. Then intraduodenal perfusion of 20% intralipid was performed in the experimental group at a speed of 3 ml/h for 2 h, and the combined bile-pancreatic secretions were collected every 15 min and the pancreatic fluid flow and protein secretion were measured. The pancreas was studied by immunohistochemistry (IHC) of c-fos. The control group had no intestinal infusion. The control group had no intraduodenal infusion. Results After the intraduodenal infusion of 20% intralipid the volume of combined bile-pancreatic secretions was increased by 31.6% over basal, P value < 0.01; and the protein output (mg/15 min) was increased by 115.1% over basal, P value < 0.01. Significant increase of c-fos positive-neurons in positive intensity, postive area and in density of immunostaining was found compared to that of the controls, P value < 0.01. Conclusions This study suggested that the intraduodenal infusion of 20% intralipid has an excitatory effect on the activity of intrapancreatic neurons, which promotes the pancreatic exocrine secretion function. method for the synthesis of apoptin coding DNA sequence from a large number of oligodeoxyribonucleotides (oligos). Methods Based on apoptin gene coding sequence (GeneBank accession number AY171617), a number of oligos were designed to assembely apoptin gene in pfu mix reaction system, each oligos was 40 nucleotides (nt) in length, in which synonymous codon substitution was used to eliminate restriction enzyme sites of Bgl II (position 172, agatct AE agatcc) and Hind III (position 306, aagctt AE aatcct). The assembly mixture was further diluted and amplified with two end oligos. The targeted sequence was gel-purifed, amplified one more time, added T to 3\u00a2 end in the presence of Taq polymerase and dATP, and at last cloned to pGEM T easy vector. The positive colonies were confirmed byrestriction enzyme excision and sequencing. Results The synthetic mixture in the first assembly reaction was in the form of smearing. Besides DNA ladder bands, a clear targeted band was yielded when diluted mixture was amplified with two end oligos. After the PCR targeted gene was cloned to pGEM T easy vector, 75% (3/4) of positive colonies were confirmed in one single experiment. The positive colonies were finally verified by sequencing which were totally in line with the designed coding sequence of apoptin gene. Conclusion Gene assembly is rapid and cost-effective approach of synthesis of genes or vectors. It is well suited for several in vitro mutagenesis strategies. The apoptin gene synthesized in this study is easy to subclone and will be good for therapy investigation in gastrointestinal tumor.",

Results The protein level of D 4 in peptic ulcer patients (gastric and duodenum ulcer) was higher than that in gastritis patients both in gastric antrum and duodenal bulb (table). Further analysis showed that the D 4 protein level was not related to gender and age of the patients, as well as the Helicobacter pylori infection state.

Objective To explore the effect of DNA methyltransferase, demethylase and methyl-CpG binding protein MeCP2 on the expressions and methylation of hMSH2 and proto-oncogene in human gastric cancer. Materials and Methods Paired samples of primary gastric cancer and corresponding para-cancerous, non-cancerous gastric mucosae were obtained from surgically resection specimens of 28 patients. The transcription levels of Dnmt1, mbd2, MeCP2, p16 INK4A , hMSH2 and c-myc were detected by using real-time RT-PCR or RT-PCR. The promoters' methylation of p16 INK4A , c-myc and hMSH2 genes were assayed by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and sequencing (mapping). Their relationships were analyzed by Fisher exact test using the software SPSS. Results Average mRNA levels of Dnmt1 and mbd2 genes from cancerous tissue were higher and lower than that from non-cancerous tissue, respectively. mbd2 was lower in cancerous tissue than noncancerous tissue in 13 (42.9%) of patient but higher in 3 cases (10.7%) of non-cancerous gastric tissue (P < 0.001). c-myc expression was up-regulated in cancer tissues (P < 0.05), and all cases with hypomethylated c-myc have been found the up-regulation of mbd2. The transcriptional levels of p16 INK4A and MeCP2 genes did not display any difference between gastric cancerous and matched noncancerous tissues. The correlation of mbd2 expression with unmethylation of c-myc promoter suggests that these sites may be targets for demethylation by the enzyme. There was down-regulation and hypermethylation of hMSH2 in cancer tissues, and the hypermethylation of hMSH2 in the cases who down-regulated transcription. However, the transcription level of the above gene may be not associated with biological behave. Conclusions The up-regulation of proto-oncogene may be the consequence of epigenetic control of gene expression by the demethylase, and mbd2 is involved in the regulation of hMSH2 expression in human gastric cancer.",

Methods Expression of total Akt(t-Akt) and phospho Akt(p-Akt) in gastric cancers was examined by immunohistochemistry and western blot. Constitutively activated and kinase dead mutant of Akt transfectants were established. Apoptosis of the transfectants was examined by Annexin V/PI staining when administrated with adriamycin. Regulation of Akt on MDR1 expression was studied by RT-PCR and western blot. Effect of Akt on P-gp activity was studied accumulation and retention of adriamycin and verapamil block assay. Luciferase assay was performed to indicate the regulation of Akt on MDR1 promoter transcription. Results p-Akt was overexpressed in human gastric cancers and its expression levels correlated with the carcinogenesis and the degree of tumor differentiation, but t-Akt not. Constitutively activated Akt confered anti-apoptotic ability and drug resistance of gastric cancer cells. While kinase dead Akt induced apoptosis and caused reversal of the drug resistance. Kinase dead Akt decreased the expressions of both MDR1 mRNA and protein. P-gp function analysed revealed that adriamycin accumulation and retention were decreased in constitutively activated Akt transfectants and could be blocked by Verapamil. Reporter gene assay suggested that AGS cells co-transfected with kinase dead Akt and pGL-MDR1 showed weaker fluorescence intensity than the empty vector co-transfected cells, which indicated that kinase dead Akt could suppress the promoter activity of MDR1. Conclusions Akt is constitutively activated in gastric cancers and p-Akt contributes to gastric carcinogenesis. Akt activity decreases cell chemosensitivity in vitro, causing inhibition of pro-apoptotic effect of anti-tumor drugs. Down-regulated Akt activity decreases the expressions of MDR1 mRNA and protein as well as MDR1 promoter activity.",

We further investigated the effect of ZNRD1 expression on cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Results The expression of ZNRD1 was found decreased progressively in the process of carcinogenesis of stomach cancer. ZNRD1 expression was also confirmed to be downregulated in gastric cancer cell lines compared to normal gastric epithelial cell line.

Antibiotics is now regularly given. It is thought that fever is due to the absorbtion of necrotic tumor tissue, the immunity response, drug induced and so on, some are caused by bacteria infection only for which the antibiotics should be used. PCT is the precursor of calcitonin (CT), encoding by the CALC-1 gene. The concentration of plasma PCT usually significantly increase when serious bacteria infection or pyemia exist. In vitro PCT is induced by endotoxin. Our result showed PCT level was normal/mild elevated in 82.35% pyretic patients, so fever has no relationship with bacteria infection. We stopped the antibiotics in these patients and found no severe complications. Conclusion It is of significance that PCT measurement in analyzing the reason of fever post TACE and in advising the usage of antibiotics.",

Adenovirus is a useful vector for gene therapy. A recombinant adenovirus carrying vasostatin gene was constructed and identified for further using. Materials and Methods AdEasy XL adenovirus vector system which is defective for replication due to the deletion of gene E1/E3 was used as vector for gene therapy. A cDNA clone encoding vasostatin was isolated from human muscle cDNA library with PCR cloning technique. The PCR fragment was cloned into a pshuttle vector, which contains a cytomegalovirus promoter. The resultant plasmid (pshuttle-CMV-vasostatin) linearized with Pme I was transformed into E. coli. BJ5183 pre-transformed with the pAdEasy-1 plasmid to undergo homologous recombination by electroporation means. The recombinant plasmid (pAd-CMV-vasostatin) linearized with Pac I was then transfected into 293 cells. The recombinant adenovirus was evidenced by the cytopathic effect of 293 cells, and confirmed by PCR. Results The PCR producet was 564 bp confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The successful cloning of vasostatin into pshuttle-CMV was confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis, and the gene of interest was identified as vasostatin by nucleotides sequencing technique. The recombinants were selected for kanamycin resistance and the recombination was confirmed by the presence of 4.5 kb fragment in the restriction endonuclease analysis. Both the cytopathic effect of 293 cells and the 564 bp PCR producet indicated the presence of the recombinant adenovirus containing vasostatin gene. Conclusions The recombinant adenovirus containing vasostatin gene was constructed successfully, which is helpful to further investigation of its potentiality in the gene therapy of gastroenterological cancer.",

Results Calprotectin was demonstrated in the majority of granulocytes and macrophages in tissues of patients with active UC while negative in unactive UC and healthy controls. A strong calprotectin immunoreactivity was present in ulcerative and erosion lesions in the bowel. Fecal concentrations were significantly (P < 0.0001) higher in patients with active UC [n = 23, median 223 ug/g, (16.5, 975)] than in unactive UC [n = 19, median 3.5 ug/g, (1.6, 8.9)] and healthy controls [n = 20, median 2.9 ug/g, (0.01, 8. 3) ].

By polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) protocol, the influence of EGCG on telomerase activity of sensitive cancer cell line was also investigated. RT-PCR method was used to detect the influence of EGCG on the expressions of hTERT, c-myc, p53 and mad1 genes in sensitive cancer cell line. Results EGCG exhibited dose-dependent killing effects on all eight digestive tract cancer cell lines. There were no apparent changes in cell cycle distribution of sensitive cancer cell line MKN45 after 48 h incubating with three different concentrations of EGCG compared with the controls.

Results In 40 ESCC and their adjacent tissues, the positive expression rates of p53, MDM 2 and p63 were 40% (16/40) and 12.5% (5/40) (P < 0.01), 55% (22/40) and 7.5% (3/40) (P < 0.0001), 95% (38/40) and 100% (40/40) (P > 0.05), respectively. Among the 40 ESCC, there were 16 samples for p53 (-) / MDM 2 (+), 10 samples for P53 (+) / MDM 2 (-), 6 samples for both positive and 8 samples for both negative. There was an inversed correlation between the expression of p53 and MDM 2 protein, but it didn't reach statistic significance (P = 0.068). No association between P63 and p53 or MDM 2 was found. Conclusions The expression of p53 or MDM 2 is a common case in ESCC. There is an incersed correlative trend between the expression of p53 and MDM 2 .The expression of p63 in ESCC doesn't differ from their adjacent tissues, no association between p63 and p53 or between p63 and MDM 2 is found. The effect of p63 in ESCC should be further studied.",

The expression levels of TSG101 in SGC7901 and the transfectants were detected with Western blot and semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was applied to examine the capacity of cells to undergo apoptosis induced by VCR and the intracellular mean fluorescence intensity of adriamycin (ADR). Cell sensitivity towards chemotherapeutic drugs was analysed by MTT assay. The MDR-related molecule was examined with Western blot assay. Results It was found that TSG101 was highly expressed in VCR resistant gastric cancer cells. The ectopic overexpression of TSG101 could enhance the resistance of SGC7901 to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs such as VCR, ADR, cisplatin, mitomycin-C. The accumulation of ADR was reduced in the TSG101 transfectants and restored nearly to the levels of parental cells by coadministration of verapamil (a P-glycoprotein inhibitor). TSG101 significantly upregulated the expressions of the classical MDR-related molecule Pglycoprotein. The TSG101-mediated MDR could be partially reversed by verapamil. TSG101 could also suppress VCR-induced apoptosis and up-regulate the expression of Bcl-2, which might be another pathway contributing to TSG101-related MDR. The expression of Raf-1 protooncogene was also increased in TSG101 transfectants and Raf-1 inhibitor could decrease P-glycoprotein expression. Conclusions These observations implied that TSG101 might play a certain role in MDR of gastric cancer through Raf signal transduction cascade and/or cooperation with antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. ",

Materials and Methods RT-PCR was used to amplify human Angiopoietin-1 gene from human plancental tissues.The recombinant sense or antisense eukaryotic expression vectors were constructed by directional cloning, and transfected by lipofectin into human gastric cancer line SGC7901. Stable transfectants were obtained respectively, namely 7Ang1+ for sense, 7Ang1-for antisense, and 7901P for empty vector transfected cells. Semiquatitive PCR and Western Blot were employed to testify the transfection efficiency. Cell growth curve and cell cycle were observed by MTT assays or flow cytometry. Animal model was set up to study in vivo tumorigenesis of those cells transplanted subcutaneously in the hind legs of nude mice BALBc. Microvessel density (MVD) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry for VIII-Factor staining.

Methods The inbred C57L and AKR mice were fed a lithogenic diet containing 15% fat, 1.25% cholesterol and 0.5% cholic acid for four weeks, Their liver weight, hepatic cholesterol content and gallstone formation condition in gallbladder were examined before and after feeding the lithogenic diet; and mRNA levels of hepatic 3hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (Hmgcoar), cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase (C7h), acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase (Acat) and low density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr) that are involved in the regulation of hepatic cholesterol homeostasis were measured and analysed by RT-PCR. Results Whether before or after feeding the lithogenic diet hepatic cholesterol content in AKR mice displayed markedly higher than that in C57L mice, Challenged with the lithogenic diet for four weeks, cholesterol gallstones were formed in C57L mice and was not occurred in AKR mice. Basal hepatic Hmgcoar mRNA levels were significantly higher in gallstone-resistant AKR mice compared with the C57L gallstone-susceptible strain; basal mRNA levels of Acat, Ldlr and C7h did not differ significantly among the mouse strains studied. In response to the lithogenic diet, expression levels of Hmgcoar and C7h mRNAs significantly decreased in AKR mice, whereas unchanged Hmgcoar and C7h mRNA levels occurred in C57L mice; The Ldlr mRNA increased slightly (14%) in AKR mice, and a significant elevation of 41% was present in C57L mice. Conclusions The lithogenic diet as an environment challenge unmasked phenotypes of mRNA expression of hepatic cholesterol metabolism regulatory enzymes of C57L and AKR mice, there were significant differences between both mouse strains on expression levels of Hmgcoar, C7h and Ldlr. After feeding the lithogenic diet, failure to sufficiently down-regulate Hmgcoar expression and significant increase of Ldlr level in C57L mice may play at least a part role in cholesterol gallstone formation.",

The study was designed to investigate the changed gene expression patterns in the gastric carcinogenesis and screening the gastric cancer related genes would provide a credible key to improve the dignosis and therapy of gastric cancer. Materials and Method the PCR products of 8192 human genes were spotted onto a chemical-material-coated-glass plates in array. DNAs were fixed the glass plate after series of treatments. The total RNAs were isolated from the tissues, and were purified to mRNAs by Oligotex. Both mRNAs from the gastric adenocarcinoma and normal gastric mucosa were reversely transcribed to the cDNAs with the incorporation of fluorescent dUTP to prepare the hybidization probes. The mixed probes were hybridized to the cDNA microarray. After high-stringent washing, the cDNA microarray was scanned for fluorescent signals and showed differences between two tissuses. Results Among the 8192 target genes, the expression level of 327 genes differed between gastric adenocarcinoma and normal mucosa, 179 were down-regulated and 148 up-regulated. Conclusion cDNA microarray technique is effective in screening the differentially expressed genes between gastric adenocarcinoma and normal mucosa. Many genes take part in the carcinogenesis of gastric adenocarcinoma. The present study represents a global view of gene expression of gastric adenocarcinoma and provides important clues for further study of gastric adenocarcinoma related genes. centration was detected by ELISA. Tumoregenesis in nude mice was investigated for the siRNA transfected cells. Human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) migration and tube formation assay were used to observe the effects of COX-2 downregulation on angiogenesis. Results COX-2 expression was inhibited in the transfected cells (SGC7901/siRNA). COX-2 catalytic product PGE 2 in the transfected cells was also significantly inhibited. Cell growth retardation was observed in COX-2 siRNA transfected cells both in vitro and in vivo. Cell cycle analysis suggested in the transfected cells a G 2 /M phase arrest. In HUVEC migration assay, cell numbers migrated was decreased from (140 \u00b1 13) to (65 \u00b1 10) (p < 0.01). Addtion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) partially reconstituded the cell migration (95 \u00b1 13, p < 0.05). Tube formation assay suggested that the mean vessel length formed by HUVEC stimulated with culture medium from COX-2 siRNA transfected cells was significantly (p < 0.01) shorter than that from the control cells (10.11 \u00b1 1.39 mm vs 18.45 \u00b1 1.41 mm). Addition of VEGF partially reconstituded the tube formation (14.46 \u00b1 1.14 mm, p < 0.05). Conclusions COX-2 siRNA can inhibit the proliferation of gastric cancer cell SGC7901 and angiogenesis by HUVEC which might be mediated by VEGF.",

Akt was phosphorylated and then activated by Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinases (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Alteration of Akt activity is associated with several human cancers by mediating survival signals and allowing cells to escape apoptosis. The present study was to investigate the expression of Akt and its phoshorylation level in gastric cancer and it possible implications. Methods Phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) and vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) protein was detected in 55 gastric cancer tissue samples with pared normal tissues by immuhistochemical SP method. Reverse transcriptional PCR (RT-PCR) was used to detect the transcriptase of Akt1, Akt2 and Akt3 and western blotting was conducted to evaluate Akt and pAkt protein levels in 20 fresh cancer tissue samples of stomach with pared normal tissues. Results Akt1, Akt2 and Akt3 mRNA were constitutively expressed in gastric specimens and their levels in cancers were not significantly different with those in matched normal tissues (P > 0.05). Western blotting analysis demonstrated that the expression levels of Akt protein and pAkt protein in cancers were 1.7-fold (P < 0.001) and 2.1-fold (P < 0.01) higher than those in normal tissues respectively. Immunohistochemically, pAkt protein was found expressed in 67.3% (37/55) gastric cancers and 60.0% (33/55) pared normal tissues. Furthermore, statistical analysis revealed that abundance of pAkt was significantly associated with poorly differentiated phenotype (c 2 = 9.75, P < 0.01), late TNM stage (c 2 = 7.68, P < 0.05) and the presence of distant metastasis (c 2 = 6.56, P < 0.05). In addition, pAkt expression was significantly correlated with VEGF-C immunostaining (c 2 = 15.37, P < 0.0001). Conclusion Overexpression of Akt and pAkt protein is tumor specific and may be a result of alterations of the gene translation and (or) protein metabolism. Akt phosphorylation might contribute to malignant transformation and enhanced aggressiveness of gastric cancer through VEGF-C up-regulation.",

Results Both CXCR3 protein and mRNA can be detedcted in all human gastric cancer cell lines with the highest level in KATO III cells. CXCR3 expression in these cells was higher than in normal gastric epithelial cell line GES-1. FACS analysis revealed that CXCR3 was present on SGC7901, 9811, AGS, MKN45 hunam gastric cancer cells with less than 5% cells posistive. However, KATO III human gastric cancer cells showed a significant 9.28% positive rate. In human gastric cancer samples, CXCR3 expression was higher in cancer tissues than in adjcent normal tissues as shown by western blotting. Conclusions Human CXC chemokine receptor CXCR3 is present in human gastric cancer cells, which has not been reported by literature. CXCR3 expression is higher in gastric cancer cells than in their normal counterparts. The presence of CXCR3 on human gastric cancer cells may be related to lymph node metastasis of gastric cancer cells.",

Results Different level of COX-2 mRNA expression was observed in MKN45 and MKN28 gastric cancer cell lines. Treating the two cell lines with nimesulide combined with 5-FU can significantly reduce the expression of COX-2 mRNA. Nimesulide could inhibit the growth of gastric cells in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Combination treatment of Nimesulide with 5-FU resulted in a synergistic cytotoxic effect. The synergistic cytotoxcity was noted irre-spective of treatment sequence but the highest percent cytotoxity was obtained when the cell lines were treated with two drugs simultaneously. The synergistic cytotoxcity achieved with two drugs was shown to be due to apoptosis. Treating with 5-FU enhances expression of the pro-apoptotic gene Bax, while nimesulide reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2, resulting in a significantly higher ratio of Bax-to-Bcl-2.

Methods Use noumenon dissect and B-type ultrasonic apparatus to observe condition of gallbladder calculus formationin normal control and HCD group. At the same time, measure gallbladder motility function. Use radioimmunoassay to measure plasma CCK level in fast and 30 min after fatty meal.When experiment end, dissect animals, take gallbladder examples to check pathologic change. Results HCD group's gallbladder cholesterol calculus formation rate (80%) is remarked higher than normal control (0%) (P < 0.05). There is no obviously difference between HCD group and normal control in fast CCK level (P > 0.05). But HCD group's CCK level of post-fatty meal is obviously lower than normal control (P < 0.05).

Results Indomethacin (Indo) and Aspirin (Asp) inhibited both AGS (wild-type p53) and MKN28 (mutant p53) gastric cancer cell lines growth in a time/dose dependent manner. AGS cell line was more sensitive to NSAIDs, which apoptosis percentage was significantly higher than MKN28 under the same condition. The percentages of apoptosis of MKN28 were somewhat higher among NSAIDs treated groups compared with the normal control group, but these slight differences were not statistically significant. The bax mRNA kept increasing since NSAIDs treatment accompanied by a decreasing of bcl-2 gene. The Bax protein increased after treatment while the Bcl-2 protein was undetectable, which tendency was more obvious during 6-24 hs. Conclusions Both Indo and Asp could induce apoptosis in gastric cancer cell lines, which supply a further theoretical foundation to the anti-cancer use of NSAIDs. NSAIDs could not induce notable apoptosis of MKN28, which indicated mutant p53 gene perhaps blocked NSAIDs induced apoptosis.

Methods From January 2002 to December 2003, based on Rome II criteria, 67 IBS patients including 44 cases of diarrhea predominant symptoms, 23 cases of constipation predominant symptoms and 10 healthy volunteers were enrolled into study. 30 ml, 60 ml, 90 ml, and 120 ml rectal balloon-distention stimuli were performed to all subjects. Rectal sensation and visual analogue scale (VAS) were recorded, activated area and activated intensity of focal encephalic functional area including anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), thalamus (THAL) and insular cortex (IC) were measured by using BOLD-fMRI. Results The thresholds of urgency and dyschizia in diarrhea predominant IBS (D-IBS) patients were significantly lower than those of constipation predominant IBS (C-IBS) patients and controls (P < 0.05 respectively). VAS of D-IBS instead of C-IBS patients was much higher than controls when administrated 90 ml and 120 ml rectal balloon-distention (P < 0.05); Activated encephalic areas of PFC and right THAL in C-IBS patients were significantly increased when rectal balloon-distention up to 120 ml (P < 0.05). Besides, activated area of IC, PFC and right THAL in D-IBS patients increased significantly when rectal balloon-distention up to 120 ml (P < 0.05); The alterative signal intensity of IC, PFC and THAL in all IBS patients was significantly higher than controls (P < 0.05) when rectal balloondistention up to 120 ml while it only had significance in intensity of IC when distention up to 90 ml (P < 0.05). Conclusions BOLD-fMRI has its clinic value in assessment of functional alterations of regional brain activation. The results of this study indicated that hypersusceptibility caused by rectal balloondistention could be demonstrated by BOLD-fMRI in IBS patients and both area and intensity of IC, PFC and THAL increased which may be the major encephalic functional areas involving visceral perception.",

Methods Sprague-Dawley rats, randomly divided into three major groups, were exposed to various periods of stress by immersionrastraint. In Group A, four subgroups rats were killed after 0, 1, 2, or 4 hours of stress respectively. In Group B, rats were randomly divided by 5 subgroups including intact, stress, stress with pretreatment omeprazole (Om), cimetidine (Cm) and saline (NS) respectively. In Group C, rats were randomly divided by 5 subgroups incuding intact and 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours after the end of 4 hours of WRS respectively. Gastric juice pH, ulcer index (UI), the histopathological change of gastric mucosa in light microscope (LM) as well as the ultrastructural change of parietal cells in transmission electron microscope (TEM) were examined to all of the rats after sacrificed. Results The degree of gastric injury was positively correlated with the duration of exposure to WRS (r = 0.9876, p < 0.01). At 4 hours after WRS, gastric mucosa lesions progressed gradually to apparent erosions and haemorrhage. In the histological observations, ulcers involving damage to the musclaris mucosa were observed at 4 hours after WRS. Gastric acid secretion increased with the duration of exposure to WRS concomitant to progression of gastric mucosa damage. The parietal cells underwent a gradually changes from resting to secreting state with the duration of stress and from secreting to resting state after end of stress. Gastric damage of rats with pretreatment of omeprazole or cimetidine were significantly lightened and gastric pH value rised compare with that of without pretreatment them, but the parietal cells of rats with pretreatment of cimetidine presented nonsecreting state, while those of rats with pretreatment of omeprazole presented secreting state. Conclusion Increased gastric acid secretion induced by WRS was in accordance with the ultrastructural changes of parietal cells and was significantly correlated with the degree of gastric mucosa lesion, both omeprazole and cimetidine can mitigate the gastric damage induced by WRS.

Numbers of activated HSCs were quantified after alpha smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) staining. Results With the development of hepatic fibrosis, the positive staining cells of a-SMA increased obviously, which were mainly resided in the portal ducts, fiber septa and perisinuses accompanied by proliferating bile ducts. The positive staining areas of the rat livers in model groups at 1 to 4 week after ligation of common bileduct (12.88% \u00b1 2.63%, 22.65% \u00b1 2.16%, 27.45% \u00b1 1.86%, 35.25% \u00b1 2.34%, respectively) were significantly larger than that in the control group (5.88% \u00b1 1.46%), P < 0.01.

Western blotting analysis results displayed that the expression of FAK protein was up-regulated with model course. FAK mRNA expression was obviously upregulated in the model groups compared to the control group. Conclusions These data suggest that expressions of FAK protein and mRNA are greatly increased in fibrotic rat liver, which may play an important role in HSC proliferation and hepatic fibrogenesis. Objectives To determine the inhibition of M1RNA ribozyme directed against the mutant-type p53 gene (mtp53) at codon 249 in exon 7 (AGGAEAGT) both cell-free system and MHCC97 cell lines. Materials and Methods M1RNA ribozyme directed against the mtp53 at codon 249 was designed by computer and cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pBSKneoU6 (pU6M1RNA). In vitro, M1RNA ribozyme was driven by T7 RNA polymerase promoter. In cell lines, U6 promoter was driven by RNA Pol III. The mtp53 and wild type p53 (wtp53) gene fragments were cloned into the pGEM-T vector under T7 promoter control.The 32 p-labeled mtp53 transcript was the target RNA. Cold M1RNA ribozyme transcripts were incubated with 32 p-labeled target RNA in cell-free system and radioautographed after denaturing polyacrylamide gelelectrophoresis. The pU6M1RNA was introduced into MHCC97 cells by LipofectA-MINE AM 2000 and individual G418-resistant colonies were picked up and grown. The mtp53 expression was analyzed by RT-PCR, Northern Blot and Western Blot. Results M1RNA ribozyme showed a specific cleavage activity against mtp53 with cleavage efficiency of 58%, while the wild type p53 was not cleaved. After transfection into MHCC cell line, the mtp53 mRNA level and protein expression were inhibited by M1RNA ribozyme. Conclusion These findings suggest that the M1RNA ribozyme against the mtp53 is a new promosing gene theraputic agent against hepatocellular carcinoma. The M1RNA ribozyme technology is not limited to a specific case but may have broad general applicability in gene therapy. Our results also demonstrated that the U6 expression system is very efficient and suitable for the expression of small RNA, such as ribozyme and RNA interference.",

The PCR production was a 410 bp fragment. After treated with RsaI and PstI, the genotype of CYPIIE1 was seperated into three types: type A, homozygote c1/c1; type B, heterozygote c1/c2; and type C, homozygote c2/c2. Result The distribution of CYPIIE1 had no relationship with age and sex. In 28 patients with alcoholic steatosis, the prevalence of type A was 28.6%, type B 50% and type C21.4% (c1 allelic frequency was 53.6%, c2 46.4%). All 8 heavy drinkers who did not have liver diseases were type A and c2 gene was not detected. The gene distribution in these two groups had no relation with daily alcohol consumption and duration.The prevalence of type A was 31.1%, type B 53.3% and type C 15.6% in 45 patients with non-alcoholic steatosis (c1 57.75%, c2 42.25%). In 18 patients with non-steatosis control, type A was 88.9% and type B was 11.1% (c1 94.45%, c2 5.55%). In 20 healthy subjects, type A was 85% and type B was 15% (c1 92.5%, c2 7.5%). Compared alcoholic steatosis group with heavy drinker without liver diseases group and healthy control, c1 decreased and c2 increased significantly. Between heavy drinker without liver diseases and healthy control, the gene frequence had no difference. Compared non-alcoholic steatosis group with non-steatosis control and healthy control, c1 decreased and c2 increased significantly. Between nonsteatosis control and healthy control, the gene frequence had no difference. The same condition between the non-alcoholic steatosis and alcohlic steatosis. Conclusion RsaI and PstI RFLPs played a role in the fatty liver susceptibility and c2 gene might be related to the development of diseases.",

Materials and Methods Two patients are described who suffer from a plumbism after taking Chinese herbs to treat chronic hepatitis B infection. One of the two patients, male, aged 27 years, was treated by Chinese herbs bought from Wuhan and the other one, female, aged 24 years, was receiving Chinese herbs bought from Guangzhou. Results After they received the treatment of Chinese herbs, the male patient had a stomach-ache off and on in the past 6 months and the female patient had an upper abdominal pain companied with vomiting for one month. Microelement test showed that lead level of blood and urine in the two patients was significantly increased. The lead level of blood and urine in the male patient was 4.93 mmol/L (normal < 1.45) and 0.52 mmol/L (normal < 0.39) respectively. The level of blood and urine in the female patient was 7.83 mmol/L and 1.21 mmol/L respectively. The lead content of Chinese herbs taken by the male patient was from 7.83 mg/g to 6455.20 mg/g and the lead content of Chinese herbs taken by the female patient was from 12.21 mg/g to 3569.70 mg/g. All of them were diagnosed as plumbism and were treated with Calcium Disodium Edetake. Conclusions The case report shows that abusing Chinese herbs may result in plumbism. Methods Six patients with thrombosis of the PV and SMV were treated by transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) Pathway. All 6 patients presented with abdominal pain, distention, and anorexia etc. No clinical signs of peritonitis were seen. The diagnosis was established by Doppler ultrasound scan and contrast enhanced CT. Control PV-SMV venography was performed after access to the PV branch. Then aspirate and fragment the thrombus in the PV and SMV. Contemporaneous local thrombolysis with urokinase (UK) was delivered through a catheter in the SMV.

The first symptoms of this group was asymptomatic enzymes elevated (70%). 2.The relative medicines:The medicine category is numerous, involve the treatment of each system illness to use the medicine, essentially some traditional Chinese medicines. 3. Clinical type: The type of hepatic cell harm was chief one (60%). 4. Prognosis: The case of hepatic failure was 18 (30%), the death case was 8 (13.33%). Conclusions Because the elderly take more prescription medication than any other age group, they are more likely to have adverse drug reactions. Therefore much effort has been directed toward understanding the changes in drug metabolism that occur with aging. Many factors may influence drug disposition in the elderly, including changes in body composition, a general decrease in serum albumin concentration, decreased renal function and environmental influence including dietary changes. Early diagnosis and prompt withdrawal of the offending drug is the key to successful management of most drug induced liver disease. When fulminant drug-induced liver failure occurs liver transplantation is the therapy of choice with a better prognosis than conventional therapy.",

The interaction of the elements with transcription factors was analyzed by EMSA using -148/+152 and -1245/-820 fragments as probes to determine whether there are quantitative and qualitative differences in the nuclear factors binding to P3 in the above four cells. Results 1The luciferase activities of various P3 constructs in HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells were 15~16 times those in HeLa cells and 2 times those in L-02 cells. The full-length P3 construct demonstrated maximal promoter activity. -1273/-839, -839/-551, -551/-310, and -310/-148 fragments each could contain stimulative elements. 2The six similar retarded complexes in the -148/+152 fragment were detected with the above four cell extracts, but the relative abundance of these complexes differed with weaker intensities in HeLa cells.There were different patterns and intensities of retarded complexes in the -1245/-820 fragment among the four cells with the stronger and more complexes in HepG2, SMMC-7721, and L-02. Conclusion 1Human IGF-II gene P3 promoter indicates complex structure, which may contain several stimulative elements. 2The activities of P3 differ in the above four cells. P3 demonstrates the strongest activities in HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells, which is responsible mainly for IGF-II overexpression in HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells. 3The high activity of P3 may be intimately associated with the expression up-regulation of corresponding transcription factor(s) and/or expression of additional factors in human hepatoma cells.",

Methods HSC was isolated from rat by in situ perfusion of liver and 8.2% Nycondenz gradient centrifugation, and primarily cultured on uncoated plastic for 24 h with DMEM containing 20% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS/DMEM), before the culture medium was substituted with 2% FBS/DMEM for another 24 h. Then, the HSC was cultured in 2% FBS/DMEM with tetrandrine (0.25 mg/L, 0.5 mg/L, 1 mg/L, 2 mg/L, respectively). Cell phenotypes were observed under inverted microscope; a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) expression was checked by immunocytochemistry and image analysis system; laminin (LN) and procollagen type III peptide (P III P) in supernatant were detected with radioimmunoassay system; TGFb1 mRNA, Smad7 mRNA and Smad7 protein were analyzed with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western Blot, respectively. Result Tetrandrine in the concentration of 0.25 mg/L ~2 mg/L prevents morphological transformation of HSC from quiescent phonotype to the activated one while a-SMA, LN and P III P expression are inhibited. RT-PCR shows decreased expression of TGFb1 mRNA in significant negative correlation with increased Smad7 mRNA, and up-regulation of Smad7 protein by tetrandrine (1 mg/L) was confirmed by Western Blot as well. Conclusion Tetrandrine exerts direct inhibiting effect on the activation of rat hepatic stellate cells in culture. Meanwhile, it upregulates the expression of Smad7, which in turn blocks TGFb 1 expression and signalling.",

Method The plasma and ascetic fluid levels of TNF-a, IL-6 were assayed by a double monoclonal sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the levels of endotoxin were assayed by limulus amebocyte lysate test in 94 hepatitis cirrhosis patients with ascites. Result (1) The plasma and ascitic levels of TNF-a, IL-6 and endotoxin were significantly higher in hepatitis cirrhosis patients with Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP) than those without SBP in admitting hospital (P < 0.05). (2) The plasma levels of TNF-a, IL-6 and endotoxin were higher in cirrhosis without SBP than those in healthy control group (P < 0.05). (3) The plasma endotodxin level of endotoxin had significantly correlated with the level of TNF-a (P < 0.001) and IL-6 (P < 0.001). Conclusion (1) Plasma endotoxin, TNF-a and IL-6 levels ane increased in hepatitis cirrhosis patients with ascites. (2) Endotoxin in hepatitis cirrhosis Patients with ascites may stimulate some kinds of immune activated cells to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines,TNFa and IL-6, which may deteriorated the complications. alcohol dependent group is 70%, in ALD group is 90%. The difference of the frequency of the two alleli in these three groups has no statistic significance, and has no statistic significance between health control group and alcohol dependent group, health control group and ALD group (P > 0.05). The frequency of ADH3*1 allele in health control group is 45%, in alcohol dependent group is 45%, in ALD group is 50%; The frequency of ADH3*2 allele in health control group is 55%, in alcohol dependent group is 55%, in ALD group is 50%. The difference of the frequency of the two alleli in these three groups has no statistic significance, and has no statistic significance between health control group and alcohol dependent group, health control group and ALD group (P > 0.05).

Conclusions In this study, we separate WBC out of the venous blood, and then genomic DNA is extracted from WBC as PCR amplification model. After PCR amplification, the PCR products is digested by respectively restriction endonuclease, and then by electrophoresis on 14% polyacrylamide gel, we can unambiguously determine the genotype of ADH2, ADH3 and ALDH2. The gene polymorphism of ADH2, ADH3 and ALDH2 do have relationships to ALD in some degree, but the difference of the frequency of ADH2 and ADH3 alleli in these three groups has no statistic significance, and has no statistic significance between health control group and alcohol dependent group, health control group and ALD group (P > 0.05). The difference of the frequency of ALDH2*1 and ALDH2*2 of the two alleli in these three groups has statistic significance (P < 0.05), and has no statistic significance between health control group and alcohol dependent group (P > 0.05). But has statistic significance between health control group and ALD group (P < 0.05). It suggests that gene polymorphism of the ALDH2 may play a more important role in the pathogenesis of ALD than that of ADH2 and ADH3.",

In groups 1 \u00a5 10 -4 mol/L, 1 \u00a5 10 -5 mol/L and 1 \u00a5 10 -6 mol/L, the expression decreased as 68.58%, 38.12% and 18.86%, respectively. Spironolactone might reduce the TIMP-1content. MMP-2mRNA and MMP-9mRNA expression in HSCs stayed unchanged after incubation with different concentrations of spironolactone for 48 h. Conclusions Spironolactone may inhibit the expression of TIMP-1 and increases MMP-13 mRNA and its protein. Spironolactone may promote the collagen degradation by regulating MMPs and TIMP-1 expression.",

After a follow-up period of 6 months, a complete response was observed in 14 of 29 (48.3%) in the T-a1 group and in 9 of 33 (27.3%) in the IFN-a group (x 2 = 2.93, p > 0.05). And compared with the results observed in group of 30 patients never treated with IFN-a and followed for 12 months, the rate of complete response was significantly higher in IFN-a group at the end of therapy (1 of 30 vs. 15 of 33, respectively; x 2 = 14.72, p < 0.01) and in the T-a1 group at the end of follow-up (1 of 30 vs. 14 of 29, respectively; x 2 = 15.70 p < 0.01). Unlike IFN-a, T-a1 was well tolerated by all patients, and no any side effects appeared in T-a1 group. Conclusions The results suggest that a 6-months course of T-a1 therapy is effective and safe in patients with chronic hepatitis B. And T-a1 is able to reduce HBV replication in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Furthermore, compared with IFN-a,T-a1 is better tolerated and seems to induce a gradual and more sustained ALT normalization and HBV DNA and HBeAg loss. However, a response rate of 48.3% is still less than ideal. A more effective therapeutic approach, such as combination therapy using the immunomodulating effect of T-a1 and antiviral effect of interferon or nucleoside analogues (such as lamivudine, famciclovir, ets.), warrants further study.",

Method Diagnostic criteria: abnormal increasement of both serum ALP and r-GT; serum AMA(+); excluding all types of hepatitis and bile duct disease. 1. Treatment way: 8 cases took UDCA only; 2 cases took UDCA and prednisone. Results Patientes age: 72-82 yrs, mean 76 yrs, 8 males, 2 feamales. Course: 7 days-15 years. 1. Clinical features: 1 case with abdominal distension and fever, 2 cases with skin ichy, jaundice and ascites. 7 cases without any symptoms. ALP and r-GT of the 10 cases were all increased unreasonably, as high as 2-5 times of normal value. All the 10 cases had AMA(+). 2. Outcome of treatment: After taking UDCA for 4 wks, ALP and r-GT in 8 cases decreased obviously. 4 of them regained to the normal values. The case with fever had normal body temperature after taking UDCA for 3 wks. No response in liver enlargement after taking UDCA.Two cases with jaundice and ascites did not improved neither in the symptoms and signs nor ALP and r-GT after taking UDCA together with prednisone, one of them died after taking the drugs one year. Conclusions AMA is very important in the diagnosis of PBC. Patients always show high ALP and r-GT earlier than jaundice, ascites or liver enlargement. According to the marks of AMA, ALP and r-GT, PBC can be diagnosed in early stage. We should pay more attention to unreasonable ascending of ALP and r-GT. UDCA is only useful to the patients with PBC in early stage, but no response to the cases in advanced stage.",

Materials and Methods By cells culturing in vitro, Anti-proliferation effects of Vitamin C and Vitamin K3 were assessed with methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) colorimetric assay. The morphology of cells was observed under light microscope, transmission electron microscope and laser scanning confocal microscope respectively. The flow cytometry was used to detect apoptotic rate and cell cycle distribution. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), the content of alondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 0 2 ) and protein in the cell were determined with biochemical method. And intracellular calcium concentration was observed by confocal microscopy. Results Vitamin c and Vitamin K3 separately did not induce any change of cell proliferation on HepG2, but showed a remarkable Antiproliferation as both combined. Morphological changes charasteristic of apoptosis were observed though light microscope, electron microscope: cellshrinkage, nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation, vacuolation and formation bodies. A typical subdiploid peak before G0/G1 phase was observed by flow cytometry. The effect of CK3 on Hep G2 showed a remarkable cell cycle specificty, blocking at G0/G1 phase. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide in the cell were increased, but depleting the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), significantly. The level of intracellular calcium concentration was step up, too. Conclusions CK3 inhibite significantly proliferation of hepatocarcinoma Cell Hep G2 and induce apoptosis and arresting cell cycle at G0/G1, the mechanism of which was related to Oxidative stress.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether or not insulin resistance exists in patients with fatty liver induced by different cause. Methods Total of 78 with fatty liver was enrolled in this study. Aged from 20 to72 y. 32 patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver, 28 patients with alcoholic fatty liver, 20 patients with hepatitis virus fatty liver. 18 were in control. All cases were measure there fasting blood glucose and serum fasting insulin level. Insulin resistance was determined by the homeostasis model assessment. Insulin resistance (IR) were compared with normal subjects and three group fatty liver. Results Compared with controls (3.5 \u00b1 0.3), The IR values in nonalcoholic fatty liver group (4.83 \u00b1 0.42), alcoholic fatty liver group (4.38 \u00b1 0.41) and hepatitis virus fatty liver group (3.98 \u00b1 0.31) were significantly higher (p < 0.01). Compared with healthy subjects, three groups fatty liver patients all had lower insulin sensitivity. Conclusion Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance occur frequently in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver; our data suggest that may play a role in the pathogenesis of alcoholic fatty liver and hepatitis virus fatty liver. female patients were 14.42% (135/936) and 10.35% (56/541) (P > 0.05). The rate (37.21%) of HCV infection in the patients with liver cirrhosis was significantly higher than that in the patients with hepatitis (12.32%) and in the patients with hepatocelluler carcinoma (6.67%, P < 0.01). The positive rates of HCV infection in various hepatitis were in order of severe hepatitis (33.33%) > chronic hepatitis (17.58%; of which, CPH 13.99% and CAH 29.41%) > acute hepatitis (9.83%) > HBV carrier (6.12%). Sex, age, profession, seasonal distribution and other epidemiological characteristics were discussed for the purpose of scientific preventive measures and preventive strategy development. Conclusions HCV infection might have played a certain role in the occurrence of these liver diseases. As indicated in our data, no sex difference was observed with HCV infection among liver diseases patients, but HCV infection rate increased with age, the highest seroprevalence of HCV was particularly in Group above-50-year-old.

Materials and Methods 45 hepatitis cirrhosis patients with ascites were sorted into two groups: SAI group including 34 cases and SA control group including 11 cases. To evaluate intestinal permeability, the concentration of lactulose and mannitol in urine was measured using high-pressure liquid chromatograph with refractive index detector (HPLC-RID), and the levels of urinary excretion of LAC/MAN ratios were calculated. The plasma and ascitic fluid levels of endotoxin were measured with limulus amebocyte lysate test. Correlation between plasma endotoxin level and intestinal permeability was assessed by the method of Pearson correlation coefficients. Results The levels of urinary excretion of LAC/MAN ratios were significantly higher in cirrhotic patients with SAI than those in SA group in admitting hospital (P < 0.05). And they were higher in cirrhosis with SA than those in healthy control group (P < 0.05); The plasma and ascitic levels of endotoxin were significantly higher in cirrhosis patients with SAI than those in SA group in admitting hospital (P < 0.05). And they were higher in cirrhosis with SA than those in healthy control group (P < 0.05); By Pearson correlation, in SAI patients, the levels of urinary excretion of LAC/MAN ratios had significantly correlated with the level of endotoxin (r = 0.187, P < 0.001); After being treated for one week, the levels of urinary excretion of LAC/MAN ratios, the plasma and ascitic levels of endotoxin of cirrhotic patients with SAI were significantly decreased but only to the levels of those patients without SAI (P < 0.05). Conclusions The intestinal permeability in hepatitis cirrhosis patients is increased;The intestinal permeability participates in pathophysiological mechanisms of cirrhosis with SAI. To detect the change of intestinal permeability may be used as indexes for judging treatment efficacy and predicting prognosis.",

SISTI Delta Research & Development, Research Centre for Medical Bioengineering-\"Tor Vergata\" University, Rome, Italy Introduction Besides transplantation (OLTx), liver cirrhosis has no valid therapeutic options and a relentless progression with overcoming complication is still a dismal prospective while OLTx waiting lists hugely enlarge. Aims & Methods A pilot study was designed with a novel biophysical methodology as a new treatment modality. Such non-invasive technique has as a main principle the \"decrease of entropy\", which can be artificially obtained through an electromagnetic-driven delivery of \"energy clusters\". This has been modulated so as to be used by the body and integrated as \"self\" to support and charge the energy-dependent functional stores thus modifying reparative into regenerative mechanisms of liver parenchyma. We studied 5 HCV+ (Child A-B) cirrhotics with overt symptomatology and portal hypertension who stopped any medication and underwent daily 40 min sessions of Delta-S DVD, an entropy-variation system, for six months and followed up monthly. Results After six months patients showed either a complete (80%) or a partial (20%) regression of fatigue (Fisk score), a complete reversion of depression (Hamilton score), peripheral edema and pruritus. As assessed by independent observers, despite having stopped betablockers, F1 varices disappeared (60%) while F2 ones were reduced to F1. Doppler-US aspect of partial (40%) or total (20%) atrophy were either reduced (60%) or reverted to normal (20%) while overt scarring nodules disappeared in 40%. Portal vein respiratory dynamics improved (80%) or normalized (20%). A significant increase of active Blymphocytes and NK cells (mean increase: +71, 2% p < 0.002) also occurred. Conclusion Although limited, such preliminary data suggest that this novel biophysical technique can positively affect \"biologicallyirreversible\" parameters, thus representing a promising new modality to effectively treat liver cirrhosis.",

Methods Liver cirrhosis was induced by percutaneous administration of carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 ). A single dose of Zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP), a specific HO inhibitor, was s.c. injected into the posterior neck of rats. Mean arterial pressure (MAP, kPa), heart rate (HR, b/min) and portal pressure (PP, cmH 2 O) were measured by indwelling catheters. Plasma carbon monoxide was measured by Chalmer's method. Heme oxygenase (HO) activity in splanchnic organs from cirrhotic rats and controls was also determined. Results Histologically typical features of cirrhosis were observed in the animals treated with CCl 4 . The cirrhotic group presented a significant increase in PP (P < 0.01) and a significant decrease in MAP (P < 0.01). No differences were observed regarding HR. Percutaneous injection of ZnPP significantly increased MAP (P < 0.05) and significantly decreased PP (P < 0.01) in cirrhotic rats.

The expression of Bcl-2 and cycling D1 in HepG2 cells during the cell cycle and apoptosis was measured by immunocellularchemical staining. Results NS-398 could significantly inhibit HepG2 cells proliferation in a dose-and time-dependent manner. NS-398 can inhibit the growth and proliferation of HepG2 cells (P < 0.01). The treatment of NS-398 can obviously induce some morphologic features of HepG2 cell apoptosis. Cellular nucleus shrinking, nucleus fragments, luniform chromatin agglutinating and chromatin fragmentation were visualized under transmission electron microscopy. The reduction of nucleus sizes and dense nucleus were viewed under fluorescent microscopy except for NS-398 treatment group. Flow cytometric analysis showed a typical sub-G1 peak in NS-398 group and the sub-G1 peak higher in NS-398 group than in that of controls along with the increased number of apoptotic cells whereas no sub-G1 peak was shown in the NS-398 group.

Excepting rats in control group, all rats were given subcutaneous injection of 40% CCl 4 , twice a week for 8 weeks. Rats in PI, PII groups were also treated with pioglitazone of 3 mg/kg, daily via gastrogavage at the beginning of or the end of second week of administration of CCl 4 respectively. At the end ofthe experiment, all rats were sacrificed, and blood and liver tissue specimens were obtained. Liver function (ALT, AST), serum fibrotic markers (HA, LN, PCIII) and hepatic hydroxypro1ine (HP) concentration were determined respectively. Histochemical staining of formalin-dixed 1iver sections with HE Masson-Trichrome, and immunohistochemical staining for a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) were performed. Modifled Knodell and Chevallier semi-quantitative scoring system (SSS) was used to evaluate necroinflammatory activity and fbrosis degree. Results Compared with model group, pioglitazone significantly reduced the serum level of ALT, AST and HA, LN, PCIII (P < 0.05 or <0.01. The HP concentrations in PII (210.90 \u00b1 24.07 mg/g), PII (257.36 \u00b1 30.55 mg/g) groups were also lower hean those in model group (317.80 \u00b1 36.44 mg/g) (P < 0.01). Histologic examination show thet PI, PII groups had milder hepatocellular degeneration, nicrosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells, and thinner or less fibrotic septa than did model group. The scores for nicroinflammation in PI (2.80 \u00b1 1.03), PII (3.00 \u00b1 1.05) groups were significantly reduced as compared with model group (4.88 \u00b1 2.30) (P < 0.05 or <0.01; the fibrosis scores in PI (3.40 \u00b1 1.65), PII (4.60 \u00b1 1.35) groups were also markedly lower than those in model group (7.00 \u00b1 3.21) (P < 0.05 or <0.01). Immunohistochemical staining showed that expression of a-SMA in PI, PII groups was smeliorated dramatically compared with model group.

And the adhesion rates were observed by toluidine blue colorimetric assay. The expression of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) both protein and mRNA in HSCs were detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis respectively. Results Compared with control and FN groups, RGDS tetrapeptide at concentrations of 25 mg/ml, 50 mg/ml and 100 mg/ml inhibited the proliferation of HSCs, P < 0.01 and the inhibition rates of 100 mg/ml at 12 h, 24 h and 48 h were 62.73%, 74.23%, 80.22%, respectively. So RGDS tetrapeptide could inhibit the HSC proliferation in dose-dependent and time-dependent manners (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). After adding RGDS tetrapeptide to HSCs for 2 h, the inhibition rates of adhesion were 8.82%, 29.41% and 45.59%, respectively, but that of Arg-Gly-Glu-Ser (RGES) group was only 4.41%, F value is 20.58, P < 0.01.

Plasma ghrelin concentration was determined by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and serum leptin, insulin, glucose levels were determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA). BMI (body mass index), body fat rate, ISI (insulin sensitivity index) were calculated. Child-pugh classification was also carried through. Results Ghrelin levels were significantly elevated in liver cirrhosis patients compared with healthy controls (3.4 \u00b1 3.3 ng/ml vs 2.1 \u00b1 1.4 ng/ml, P < 0.05). Correlation analysis showed that ghrelin negatively correlated with ISI (r = -0.326, P < 0.05) and body fat rate (r = -0.327, P < 0.05).There was no significant correlation between ghrelin and leptin (P > 0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis pinpointed body fat rate as the most important predictor discriminating ghrelin levels in patients with liver cirrhosis. Leptin was significantly elevated in hepatic cirrhosis patients compared with healthy controls (6.3 \u00b1 8.0 ng/ml vs 1.2 \u00b1 1.6 ng/ml, P < 0.001). Leptin levels became higher according to Child-pugh classification, and in Child-pugh B or C, leptin was significantly elevated compared with controls (P < 0.05). Fasting insulin levels in patients was strikingly increased compared with controls (19.6 \u00b1 19.5 uIU/ml vs 11.1 \u00b1 11.6 uIU/ml, P < 0.05); Glucose in patients was much higher than that in controls (7.0 \u00b1 1.4 mmol/L vs 4.3 \u00b1 1.0 mmol, P < 0.01). ISI in patients was significantly decreased compared with controls (-7.3 \u00b1 1.0 vs -6.2 \u00b1 1.2, P < 0.01).

Materials and Methods All patients were diagnosed as mHE coming from 6 hospitals which located in Beijing, Shanghai and Shandong province respectively from April 2003 to March 2004. Based on the structured group the theory and methodology were employed to establish the instrument. The drug (Lactulose or HepaMerz.) was used to treat the patients with mHE. Results The instrument included five domains (30 items) is showed as follows: physical functioning (8 items), psychological wellbeing (7 items), symptoms/side effects (7 items), social functioning (4 items) and general-health (4 items). Forty-two patients diagnosed mHE attended the clinical trial being treated by Lactulose or HepaMerz. The mean scores of the four neuropsychological indexes (NCT-A, NCT-B, DST, LTT) were lower than that after treatment in patients. Especially the mean scores of NCT-A and DST were significantly lower than the before treatment. Both the five domains and the total QOL were more improved than before treatment. In the physical domain the three most bothersome items that were drowsy, reactivity and tired showed more improved after treatment. In the symptom/side effects domain which the three symptoms were fatigue, itch and energy proved better improvement after treatment. Patients with more advanced disease (worse Child-Pugh class) seemed to have more impairment of their well-being. Conclusions We have developed the first disease specific HRQOL instrument for patients with mHE using a comprehensive methodological framework. Lactulose or HepaMerz is showed to contribute to improvements in psychomotor performance and in the quality of life of cirrhotic patients with mHE.

According to Ann Aobor classification, they were divided into Phase I (7 cases), Phase II (4 cases), Phase III (3 cases), and Phase IV (1 case). For gastroscopic manifestations, there were 4 types: protruded, ulcerative, phlegmonous and macrofold. Phlegmonous was the commonest among them. Because this disease extended mainly along lymphoid tissues, the lesion could expand over the pylorus into the duodenum. Discussion Gastric lymphoma occupied 3-5% of gastric malignant tumors, and 2-4% of systemic non-Hodgin's lymphomas. It was also main invasive location of extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Because most lesions lay submucosa, diagnosis rate for routine biopsy was only 60%. Therefore, large samples should be taken for biopsy or the samples should be taken from the edge of medial ulcer.

The 5-year survival rate for ESCC is less than 10%, while the 5-year survival rate for early ESCC may be up to 86%~100%. Therefore, early detection, early diagnosis and early treatment are the cruxes in reducing the mortality of ESCC. Chromoendoscopy has been used in diagnosis of early carcinomas of alimentary tract for a long time. Lulol's stain, which is paid more attention to in Japan, is the most common method to detect early ESCC. However, it has not been used widely in China. Aim To investigate the difference of detection rate of dysplasia and early ESCC before and after using Lugol chromoendoscopy. Meterials and Methods Three hundred and eighty eight patients who received routine gastroscope examination and had high risk of ESCC were examined by the iodine dyeing on their esophageal mucosa with 2.5% Lugol's solution. From every >0.5 cm in diameter unstained or light-stained area, multiple biopsies were taken for pathology. Three hundred and forty six patients who were not stained by Lugol's were received as controls. Results With the lugol's staining method, the detection rate of light, moderate and high grade dysplasia/early ESCC was 7.5% (29/388), 2.6% (10/388) and 3.4% (13/388) respectively.While in the non-stained cases, the detection rate was 3.5% (12/346), 2.3% (8/346) and 0.6 (2/346) respectively.

The present study tried to determine the clinic value of MPS in the assessment of severity and stage of ulcerative colitis (UC). Methods 25 patients with acute UC confirmed by endoscopy and histologic examination underwent a eight-week course of oral Balsalazide sodium (6.75 g/day). Clinical, MPS (Fujinon SP701, 15 MHz) and histologic data were collected at the beginning and the end of the study. As well as five imaging parameters of the MPS features (total wall thickness, mucosal appearance, submucosal thickness, number of enlarged vessels in the submucosa and number of enlarged lymph nodes around the colon) were measured between acute flare-ups and quiescent forms of UC in the same patients. Results 20 patients completed the study. After treatment, all imaging parameters had significantly improved in patients compared with pretreatment findings. Patients after treatment chieved remission assessed as 'complete' (70%) and 'symptomatic' (85%).The MPS features were also significantly improved after treatment. There was no significant difference in the thickness of the total wall around the lesion before and after the treatment (3.84 \u00b1 0.64 mm/3.62 \u00b1 0.61 mm, p = 0.15).

Methods During last decade, nineteen small sessile lipomas with base size smaller than 2 cm in diameter were resected by \"pushing\" technique in our hospital; the only one flat lipoma was drained by \"window-opening\" technique; two giant lipomas with small stalk (<2 m in diameter) were resected by polypectomy; seven giant lipomas with base size greater than 2 cm in diameter were removed using a \"subtotal resection\". EUS was performed in three cases from 2000~2002 to confirm that those lesions were lipomas superficial to the muscularis propria. Results All 29 lesions were successfully removed and histopathologically confirmed to be lipomas. No severe complications such as perforation and hemorrhage were developed after endoscopic removal. No recurrence was observed after 1-8 years follow-up endoscopic examination. Conclusion Various GI lipomas can be removed safely by electrosurgical snare resection under endoscopy following the guidance of the present theraputic strategy.",

In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety for endoscopic resection of submucosal leiomyoma. Our preliminary experiences on endoscopic diagnosis of gastrointestinal SMTs were also reviewed. Methods From January 1993 to May 2002, a total of 69 patients with gastrointestinal SMT (17-78 years old) underwent routine endoscopy. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was also performed in 9 cases of gastrointestinal SMT after February 2001. The sessile submucosal gastrointestinal SMTs with the base smaller than 2 cm in diameter were resected by \"pushing\" technique or \"grasping and pushing\" technique while the pedunculated SMTs were resected by polypectomy. All resected tumors were collected for histological examination. For those gastrointestinal SMTs originated from muscularis propria or with the base size \u22652 cm, ordinary biopsy technique was performed in tumors with ulcer while the \"Digging\" technique was performed in those without ulcer. Results In this study, 54 cases of leiomyoma and 15 cases of leiomyosarcoma were identified. In them, 19 cases of submucosal leiomyoma were resected by \"pushing\" technique and 10 cases were removed by \"grasping and pushing\" technique. Three cases pedunculated submucosal leiomyoma were resected by polypectomy. No complications such as perforation and severe bleeding developed during or after the procedure. No recurrence was observed after 1~2 years follow-up. Comparing to the final pathologic results after surgical removal, the diagnostic accuracy of ordinary and the \"Digging\" biopsy technique was 90.0% and 94.1%, respectively. Conclusion Endoscopic resection is a safe and effective treatment for leiomyomas with the base size \u00a32 cm. The \"digging\" biopsy technique would be a good option for histologic diagnosis of SMTs.",

Materials and Methods 136 cases (76 of male, 60 of female, average 48 years old) of acute pancreatitis admitting in our department were analysed, Among them, 114 cases are light and 22 cases are severe; 64 caused by gall system disorder and 36 by alcohol. Gastroscopies were performed whithin one week after onset; Samples were taken from mucous membrane of gastric sinus in all cases without peptic ulcer history and examed by urea enzyme test and biopsy. 16 cases of them were companied by digestive tract bleeding (14 severe, 2 light). Incomplete closing of pylorus was observed in all cases, More reflux of gall and duodenum fluid was seen in 82 cases. Findings under gastroscopy: The mucosa of gastric body and sinus in light superficial gastritis appears piebald alternated with red and white (the majority is red). The mucosa in active gastritis and duodenitis looks like engorgement, edema, dot or patch bleeding and erosion in gastric base, body, sinus and duodenum. Dilapidation, hollow and adhering fog at bottom surrounding with engorgement and edema were found in the mucosa of gastric and duodenum ulcer. Positive diagnostic standard of HP infection: Both positives by rapid urea enzyme test and urea exhaling test is defined as positive of HP, Both negatives or one of two positive is belong to negative of HP. Results The occurring rate of acute pancreatitis companied by mucosa damages of upper digestive tract (including light superficial gastritis, active gastritis and duodenitis and gastric and duodenum ulcer) is 79.41% (108/136), among them the occurring rate in light pancreatitis is 73.68% (84/114), that in severe one is 100%. The mucosa damages give priority to active gastritis on gastric body and sinus, the more severe state of illness, the more damages in gastric and intestinal mucosa. There is statistic difference among them, P < 0.05. There are 38 cases in light and 8 in severe infected by HP. Conclusions 1,The occurring rate of acute pancreatitis companied by mucosa damages of upper digestive tract is high. 2, The more severe state of illness, the more damages in gastric and intestinal mucosa. 3, The mucosa damages in stomach are severer than that in duodenum. 4, The pathologic changes of mucosa give priority to acute damages. 5, These damages may be independent of HP infec-tion. 6, The abdominal pain can be released after treated by antiacid and gastric mucosa protecting drug.",

Abdominal pain and bleeding in gastrointestinal tract were often the first and predominant symptoms in these patients, so the diagnosis was difficult. Methods we reviewed the clinical dates of 81 patients diagnosed as HSP, and analyzed the endoscopic findings of 19 cases who received gastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy. The histopathology of specimens form 15 cases was evaluated. Result 51 patients had a history of upper respiratory tract infection, taking medicine or variant protein before the onset of the disease. 71 patients experienced abdominal pain, which often occurred in periumbilical and epigastric regions; 34 patients had hematochezia, 18 had melena and 16 had bright blood stool. 43 patients had abdominal tenderness. Abdominal symptoms presented firstly in 21 patients, which can occur 1-40 days before the skin rashes appearing. 16 patients appeared rashes within 7 days.The main endoscopic finding include infusive edema and congestive of mucosa, multiple hemorrhagic spots, erythema, erosion and ulceration. The ulcers in stomach or duodenum were more superficial, but that in ileum seems deeper and larger. Erosion and ulcer were annulus along the folds. The findings in duodenum, especially second portion, and ileum were more severe than that in stomach or colon. The results of the microscopic examination of the specimens were: neutrophilic infiltration in mucosa and submucosa, small vessels necrosis, focal bleeding, erosion and ulceration. There are only various degrees of chronic inflammations in 7 cases. Hp was positive only in 2 cases, although the gastric biopsies were treated with W-S strain in 10 cases. Conclusion the characteristic chlinical feature and endoscopic findings may help in the diagnosis and treatment of Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP), especially in those typical skin rashes not occurring.Objective To study the epidemic characteristic of cancer on upper digestive. Method The3-step examination including OBB (occult blood bead test), gastroscope and pathology have been carried out for people aged than 30. Result The screening rate by OBB is 15.07% and the positive rate is 18.33%; the examination rate by gastroscope and pathology are 20.03% and 22.89% respectively, two hundred and thirteen people have been diagnosed as cancer, including 92 cases of esophagus cancer, 21 case of cardial cancer and 100 cases of gastric cancer. 1093 people were found in precancerous period and 158 people with cancer in early stage. The distribution of cancer show a remarkable difference in sexuality, age and district that the prevalence rate of man is greater than woman, age of 40-50 greater than other age, and people in rural or upland district greater than that of city or level ground.

Conclusions Combining with typical clinical features of biliary tract infection, fungus detection of smear/culture of bile obtained in ERCP was the key-point for diagnosis of invasive fungal infection. Up to now, pharmacokinetics of anti-fungal medicine in biliary tract still is unknown. Local application through nasal-biliary tube and intravenous fluconazole would be an efficacy and safety treatment of fungal infection, and keeping nasal-biliary tube be unobstructed must be well emphasized.",

Gastroenterology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University 400037, China Hamangioma of the esophagus is uncommon in patients with benign esophageal tumors. To our knowledge, there were less than 100 clinical case reports reported in the medical literature,We add a new case of esophageal hemangioma with treatment by access thoracic surgery, and evaluate the appropriate diagnostical access and review the treatment strategies for the disease. A 40-year-old woman with a history of repeated cholecystalgia underwent cholecystectomy 10 years ago. The patient complained to have been disturbed by lightly dysphagia and retrostemal pain for 1 year. The results of physical and laboratory examinations were unremarkable. However, endoscopic examination showed a protruding mass in the middle third of the esophagus, which located on the left esophageal wall 20 cm from incisors, and was covered with smooth mucosa with bluish coloration. Barium swallon examination found 2.0 cm filling defect on the middle third of the esophagus. EUS showed a hypoechoic submucosal mass compatible with a vascular stucture, projecting into the lumen. The routine B-ultrasonography also showed the same result by a specialist. In the case, we could not get a remarkable result by the either examination of CT and MRI. The tumor was completely resected by routine thoracic surgery.",
