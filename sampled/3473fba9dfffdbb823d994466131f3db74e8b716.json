In HAE type I/ II, deficiency in total/functional C1-INH results in aberrant contact system activation leading to bradykinin-mediated angioedema via elevated plasma kallikrein (pKal) activity. Introduction: Bradykinin (BKA) has a pivotal role in mediating Angioedema, through activation of its endothelial receptors. Indeed, several endothelial mediators are under its control, through the Gq protein coupled receptors B1 and B2, using Ca 2+ as second messenger. We previously demonstrated that the G protein coupled receptor kinases 2 (GRK2) accumulates upon BKA stimulation and regulates B1 and B2 receptors signalling by modulating intracellular calcium mobilization. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of GRK2 inhibition on the regulation of endothelial functions such as NO production and permeability upon BKA stimulation. Results: NO dependent vasodilation and permeabilization are typically acute endothelial response to BKA. In bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC), we evaluated NO production by fluorescence (DAF-FM Nitric oxide indicator) and indeed, we observed that BKA (3*10 -9 , 10 min) induces NO production. Pre-treatment for 1 hour with KRX-C7 (10 -6 M) a specific HJ-loop derived peptide inhibitor of GRK2, enhances BKA-dependent in vitro production of NO (BKA+KRX: 20 vs BKA: 10; fold of increase over basal). Moreover, we evaluated endothelial cell permeability in response to BKA, on an in vitro permeability assay (Millipore). BKA increases endothelium permeability and this response is enhanced when the cells are treated with KRXC7 (BKA+KRX: 40% vs BKA: 24%; increase over basal). These evidences support the role of GRK2 in regulation of BKA effects on the endothelium. Therefore we speculated that GRK2 could have a role in human Angioedema.

Although sugammadex has been used in many cases of general anesthesia, there are several reports of anaphylaxis following its use. Skin testing is the gold standard for detecting the causative agent of anaphylaxis. However, the test itself sometimes precipitates serious complications, including recurrence of anaphylaxis. Hence, development of a novel test that can be performed in vitro without causing such complications is desired. Recently, the basophil activation test (BAT) has been established as a tool to detect the causative agent of anaphylaxis with high sensitivity and specificity. Yet, there are few studies examining the utility of the BAT in diagnosing sugammadex-induced anaphylaxis, besides our previous report.

The evaluation of antiretroviral efficacy of HS was performed using HIV-1 BRU and different target cells (MT-4, CEM-SS). The level of virus replication was detected by p24 HIV-1 antigen ELISA. Mechanisms of action were evaluated in a Time of addition assay. Mucosal immunostimulatory activity of HS evaluated in several in vitro cell models (PBMC, macrophages and dendritic cells). Cytotoxicity was determined using the MTT assay. Results: The results showed that the HS fractions exhibited a distinct antiviral activity within the concentration range from 0.78 ug/ mL to 100 ug/mL with respect to HIV-1. All fractions of HS from peloids within the studied range of concentrations did not display pronounced cytotoxicity. Time of addition assay show that HS have antiviral activity at the stage of HIV fusion, and at the stage of reverse transcription of DNA to RNA, and at the stage of integration of viral DNA into the genome of the host cell. HS increased lymphocyte proliferation of phytohaemagglutinin A (PHA) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM) stimulated mononuclear lymphocytes (MNL) in vitro from concentrations of 10 to 100 ug/mL. HS inhibited the release of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-10 by PHA stimulated MNL at 50 ug/mL. Conclusions: The low cytotoxicity and high antiretroviral activity of HS indicate that these substances hold significant promise as safe and efficacious antiviral drugs for the treatment of secondary immunodeficiency, such as HIV infection. The ability of HS to interfere with multiple stages of the HIV replication cycle of is viewed as an added benefit suggesting potential for further development as antiviral drugs.0487 | Functional characterization of T helper cells in a cohort of common variable immunodeficiency patientsMilota T; Kayserova J; Zachova R; Rataj M; Sediva A 2nd Faculty of Medicine Charles University and University Hospital in Motol, Prague, Czech Republic Introduction: Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) is a heterogenous group of disorders characterized by impaired immunoglobulin production and dysregulation of immune system. Dysregulation may manifest as lymphoproliferative, granulomatous or autoimmune diseases. Autoimmunity occurs in 25-30% of CVID patients according to available literature sources. The underlying mechanisms have not been entirely revealed yet. Alterations in innate as well as adaptive immunity have been described, however, only few studies regarded T cell compartment were carried out. Particularly abnormalities in T cell development were previously reported such as reduction of recent thymic emigrants or reduction and to assess expression of activation markers (CD69, CD154 and HLA-DR) in a cohort of CVID patients. Objectives: PBMC (peripheral blood mononucler cells) were izolated from whole peripheral blood using Ficoll-Paque gradient. After isolation PBMC were stimulated with ionomycin and PMA (Phorbol myristate acetate) for 6 hours. We measured expression and production of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD69, CD154, HLA-DR, CXCR3, CRTH2, CCR6, T-Bet, GATA-3, ROR-gamma, IFN-gamma, IL-5, IL-17 using standard flowcytometric protocols for cell surface membrane and intracellular markers and cytokine detection.

After bronchial allergen challenges, elevated FeNO levels have been reported in subjects with asthmatic responses. Objectives: The aim of this study is to report changes in FeNO after bronchial challenge (BC) with lysine-acetylsalicylate (L-ASA) in patients with aspirin-exacerbated asthma, which have not been previously reported. Results: Adult asthmatic patients with a positive history of aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) who underwent BC with L-ASA between 2009 and 2016 were included. FeNO level was measured prechallenge and 24 hours postchallenge with L-ASA. Gender, age, personal and family history of atopy, asthma severity and blood eosinophil levels were documented. Data were analyzed with SAS 9.3 (SAS, Institute, Cary, NC, USA) BC with L-ASA were performed in seventy-four patients (mean age 43 AE 15 years), 55.4% were women. Forty-seven (63.51%) had moderate persistent asthma and twenty-seven (36.49%) severe asthma. Twenty-four had a positive BC (32.4%). No anaphylaxis occurred. In patients with positive L-ASA BC, significant differences were observed in FeNO levels prechallenge (46 ppb AE 27) and 24 hours postchallenge (53 ppb AE 41), with a mean increase of 7.02 ppb (P=.014). Mean eosinophil count in peripheral blood was 364.4 cells/ mm 3 . No significant differences were found in other variables studied between patients with positive and negative BC. Conclusions: Diagnosis of AERD was confirmed by BC with L-ASA in 32.4% patients with a compatible history. These patients showed a significant increase of FeNO levels after BC with L-ASA. Air sampling has traditionally been used to analyse atmospheric bioaerosol composition and data on airborne pollen concentrations has been used to determine the effects of allergen exposure on patient symptoms. However, recent research has shown that aeroallergen concentrations are determined not only by pollen or other parts in the plants, but also by various environmental and meteorological parameters influencing exposure during pollen flight and affecting the allergen release from pollen. Therefore, airborne pollen concentrations are not always an accurate indicator of allergen exposure.

Results: The greatest sales of the antihistamines were seen in May-June or in March-April through all the years of research corresponding with intense pollination of trees (alder and birch) and grasses. The only year with intense sales in summer months was 2009, when the highest antihistamines sales were recorded in July. However, this peak of sales corresponded with grass rather than with weed (mugwort, ragweed) pollination. June was the last month of high antihistamines sales in 2016 with a steep decline of sales seen from July to October, 2016. Conclusions: Tree pollination which occurs in the beginning of the annual pollen season promotes sales of the antihistamines as does grass pollination in June and July.

Recently, extracts from Undaria pinnatifida (brown algae) and Spirulina platensis (blue/green algae), rich in active ingredients fucoidans and phycocyanin, respectively, have been linked with anti-inflammatory and/or anti-allergic properties in various cellular and animal systems. To further characterize the effects of these ingredients in combination with hypertonic seawater, we have performed a series of mechanism-of-action studies in airway epithelial cells. Objectives: To assess the ability of a Hypertonic Seawater Solution (2.3% NaCl; HSS) comprising Undaria pinnatifida and Spirulina platensis algae extracts (HSS-algae solution) to reduce inflammation triggered by a respiratory allergen (ammonium hexachloroplatinate IV; HCPt) or a bacterial antigen (lipopolysaccharide; LPS) in airway epithelial cells. Results: Using 3-dimensional (3D), fully differentiated cultures of airway epithelial cells isolated from allergic human donors treated with HCPt, we have shown that the allergen induced strong IL-8 and IL-6 secretion in the supernatant of allergic cells. Moreover, HCPttreatment led to a reduction of the Cilia Beating Frequencies (CBF) of the nasal epithelium at day 3 post allergen challenge (measured by digital high-speed video imaging). Importantly, HSS-algae solutions blocked HCPt-induced cytokine increase and prevented reduction of CBF. In the same cells, HSS-algae solutions increased Mucociliary Clearance (MCC) in the absence of HCPt further supporting the positive effect of these solutions in nasal cell function. Similarly to the results obtained in allergic 3D cultures, HSS-algae solutions blocked IL-8, IL-6 and IL-1b secretion induced by LPS-challenge and increased CBF in normal epithelial 3D cultures. Conclusions: Hypertonic seawater solutions (2.3% NaCl) comprising Undaria pinnatifida and Spirulina platensis algae extracts exert direct anti-inflammatory effects and improve nasal cell function in physiological 3D cultures of epithelial cells isolated from allergic and normal donors.

We have developed a mass spectrometry (MS) based platform for the measurement of allergens in their native, folded state. Native MS allows stoichiometrical, topological and dynamical characterizations of proteins and their complexes. Objectives: Native MS is extremely powerful when performed with high-resolution techniques such as a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR). FT-ICR allows very precise mass measurements of large proteins and their complexes as well as analyses from complex mixtures. Our FT-ICR instrumentation consists of a Bruker solariX XR FT-ICR mass spectrometer equipped with a 12tesla superconducting magnet. High-field FT-ICR allows mass measurements from very small amounts of protein material. High mass accuracy and resolution provided by FT-ICR allows direct sequence verification through comparison of experimental and theoretical protein masses. All possible covalent modifications can also be detected. Native MS is used to study folding of allergens as well as quaternary structure and complex formation with other proteins or ligands. The method also allows studying weak or transient interactions, whose dissociation constants are up to the low millimolar level. Results: We have characterized a number of different natural and recombinant allergen proteins or their mutants by using our native FT-ICR MS platform. These include food allergens (bovine milk), animal dander allergens (dog, horse), tree allergens (birch) and grass pollen allergens (timothy). The results show a large spectrum of different forms of heterogeneity in the allergen samples and a frequent tendency of many allergens to form transient oligomers in solution.Conclusions: The utilization of native FT-ICR MS is a very versatile tool for exact molecular analysis of allergen proteins. It is very powerful method for monitoring homogeneity of protein materials which can be utilized in the quality control of (hypo)allergens intended for clinical use. Native MS is also a new tool in the analysis of allergen protein folding and in detecting even weak protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions, which may have important implications for their biological function.

The objective of our study was to further characterize the proteomes and allergomes of D. pteronyssinus and D. farinae and identify novel allergens. The identification of such new allergenic components is however notably hindered by the lack of comprehensive house dust mite sequence datasets.

Balb/c mice in the treatment group were intradermally injected with the DNA vaccine after Met e 1 sensitization and challenge. Non-sensitized mice and sensitized mice receiving PBS or mock plasmid as sham treatment were included as negative and positive controls. Blood, spleen and small intestine were collected for antibody, cytokine, flow cytometric, gene expression, histological and immunohistological analyses to evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine. It was found that DNA vaccination pronouncedly reduced the level of specific IgE and Th2 cytokines, as well as local inflammatory responses in the treated mice comparing to the positive controls. In addition to the induction of Th1 responses, DNA vaccination doubled the frequency of Foxp3 + Treg cells in the spleen of treated mice, in parallel with the up-regulation of FOXP3 expression and accumulation of Foxp3 + cells in the small intestine. In some experiments, BALB/c mice from the treatment or PBS control groups were dosed with anti-CD25 antibody to assess the modulatory role of Treg cells. Such depletion of Treg cells in the vaccine-treated mice restored the infiltration of mast cells and eosinophils in the small intestine as in the sham and was significantly more intense than in the non-depleted treated mice.

Objectives: We examined the effect of bone marrow-derived mast cells on the contractility of conjunctival fibroblasts in a threedimensional collagen lattice system. Fibroblast contraction results in shrinkage of the collagen gel, which is quantitated as a decrease in gel diameter. The release of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 into culture supernatants was evaluated by gelatin zymography. Results: Collagen gels containing mast cells alone did not manifest contraction during culture for 5 days, whereas those containing conjunctival fibroblasts alone shrank in size in a time-dependent manner. The addition of mast cells to cultures of conjunctival fibroblasts resulted in a further decrease of gel diameter dependent on added mast cell numbers. Gelatin zymography revealed that addition of mast cells increased the amounts of proMMP-9 as well as of active forms of MMP-2 in the culture supernatants. A synthetic MMP inhibitor attenuated the stimulatory effect of mast cells on collagen gel contraction mediated by conjunctival fibroblasts. Conclusions: Our results suggest that mast cells increase the release and activation of MMPs and therefore, promote collagen gel contraction mediated by conjunctival fibroblasts.

Conclusions: Basophil degranulation in PS-allergic patients and elevated serum tryptase levels during acute reactions support the activation of mast cells and basophils during hypersensitivity reactions to PS membranes. Complement activation may also participate in this activation. A leachable component of the membranes may be responsible of T cells and basophils activation in some patients.

Objectives: BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice were immunised by subcutaneous injections with ovalbumin (OVA) combined with MCT or aluminium hydroxide (alum). OVA-specific antibody responses were tested in blood, while OVA-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses were tested in cultures of spleen cells restimulated in vitro with OVA. For T-cell response, C57BL/6 mice were adoptively transferred with lymphocytes from transgenic T-cell receptor OT-I (CD8) and OT-II (CD4) mice. Antibody responses in serum were measured by ELISA, while cytokine secretion were measured both in culture supernatants by ELISA or by intracellular staining and flow cytometry of spleen cells. Results: The onset and the peak of the antibody IgG1 and IgG2 responses in mice immunised with aluminium were typically faster than with MCT, but no significant difference in the endpoint titres were observed between the two groups of immunised mice.

Methods: Synthetic fragments of Bet v 1, major allergen of birch pollen, with sequences of amino acids 120-132 (KO-1), 104-116 (NC-817), 42-57 (NC-815) and 141-156 (NC-818) were synthesized. To detect the IgE/IgG binding activity of peptides sera samples were collected from BALB/c mice after immunization with recombinant Bet v1 together with Al(OH) 3 or Freund's adjuvant. Allergenicity of peptides was detected by whole blood histamine release assay (HPLC with tandem mass-spectrometry) using blood from patients with sensitivity to birch pollen and by ELISA (IgE binding) with mouse polyclonal antibodies specific to Bet v1. The peptides (Pep) were conjugated with nature polymer chitosan (CS) via maleimidopropionic acid (Mal) linker. This conjugate having positive charge was adsorbed onto nanoparticles, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/PLGA (75/25) having negative charge. The final structure of conjugate PLGA/CS/Mal/Pep was proved by amino acid analysis, infrared spectrometry and dynamic light scattering. Results: Peptides with sequences of KO-1, NC-817, NC-815 and to a lesser extent NC-818 showed noticeable binding activity with anti-Bet v1 IgE, but at a much lower than whole birch extract (T3). At the same time we did not observed marked anti-Bet v1 IgG-binding activity of these peptides, except for fragment NC-817. Al peptides demonstrated low histamine release activity in comparison to histamine release induced by T3. We have prepared PLGA-based nanoparticles that contain four Bet v1-specific fragments with a size of about 100-150 nm bearing a positive charge.

Sublingual immunostimulation of inactivated Candida albicans is being currently prescribed with success in the prophylaxis of Recurrent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (RVVC). Objectives: To assess the systemic response of the sublingual immunostimulation with Candida albicans in mice, evaluating the in vitro proliferative capacity of splenocytes and the production of cytokines to specific and unspecific stimuli. Results: 32 Balb/C mice, divided in 4 groups of 8 animals each (4 females and 4 males per group), were immunized sublingually with 3 different concentrations of a selected strain (V132) of Candida albicans (group 1: 10 10 organisms/mL, group 2: 10 9 organisms/mL and group 3: 10 8 organisms/mL) or with sham. As schedule of immunization, anesthetized mice received weekly 10 lL of each dose or sham for a period of 1 month and afterwards were sacrificed. The splenocytes were isolated and cultured with a positive control (phytohemagglutinin), V132, sham and culture medium. The proliferation of the splenocytes was measured with Carboxy Fluorescein Succinimidyl Ester (CFSE) after 6 days. Cytokine levels (IFN-c, IL-17 and IL-10) in supernatants were quantified after 48 hours using the Cytometric Bead Array. The proliferative response was higher in mice immunized with the concentration of 10 9 organisms/mL. This proliferation was significantly higher than the one induced by the sham group in response to the specific V132 stimulus (P<.05). The production of IFN-c, IL-17 and IL-10 was dose dependent. Levels of IFN-c, IL-17 and IL-10 were significantly higher in the supernatants from group 1 splenocytes in response to V132 (P<.05) than in the control group. Levels of IFN-c, IL-17 and IL-10 were higher in group 2 splenocytes than in the control group but only reached statistical significance for IFN-c (P<.05). The in vitro response of splenocytes to proliferation and secretion of cytokines was specific to the stimulation with V132. Conclusions: In vivo sublingual immunization of mice, using this schedule of immunization with V132, elicits a systemic dose-response with proliferation of splenocytes in response to specific stimuli with a Th1/Th17 lymphocytes polarization and high levels of IL-10. Mast cells play an integral part in the pathology of allergies. Activation of mast cells is dependent on binding of allergen-specific IgE to its high affinity IgE receptor (FceRI). Crosslinking of IgE by allergen results in mast cell activation and release of preformed and newly synthesized mediators. Traditional medicines have shown to inhibit mast cell activation and reduce adverse allergic effects in patients. Traditional medicines are produced from herbs and plants, which contain numerous bioactive components. For example, essential oil components pulegone, eugenol and methyl eugenol have previously been shown to inhibit IgE-mediated degranulation in vitro and/or in vivo. Objectives: This study aimed to compare the efficacy of pulegone, eugenol and methyl eugenol in inhibition of mast cell degranulation and to understand the mechanism of action. Methods: Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells, primary bone marrow-derived murine mast cells (BMMC) and primary stem cellderived human mast cells (SCHMC) were primed overnight with IgE and incubated with different concentrations of the bioactive essential oil compounds ranging from 0.05 to 1000 lmol/L. The cells were activated with DNP-HSA in case of RBL-2H3 and BMMC or with anti-IgE in SCHMC. Degranulation was determined by beta-hexosaminidase release and western blot analysis was performed to study MAPK/ERK signaling and FceRI localization. Results: Eugenol most effectively reduced mast cell degranulation compared to pulegone and methyl eugenol. Degranulation was inhibited by 42.1AE2.1% (P<.0001) in RBL-2H3 cells, 58.6AE3.2% (P<.0001) in BMMC and 51.4AE1.5% in SCHMC (at 500 lmol/L). Preliminary results show eugenol to inhibit the phosphorylation of several signaling molecules downstream of the FceRI. Furthermore, in IgE-DNP-HSA-activated RBL-2H3 cells, eugenol (1000 lmol/L) preserved the ratio of membrane-localized vs internalized FceRI (0.35AE0.05) compared to medium exposed activated controls (0.56AE0.09) (P<.05), bringing it back to the level of non-activated controls (0.26AE0.05). Conclusions: Eugenol was shown a very effective inhibitor of mast cell degranulation. Eugenol reduced internalization of the FceRI. Eugenol may stabilize the phospholipid membrane of mast cells and hereby reduce FceRI cross-linking.

Environmental factors such as transformed food might be incriminated. Infants are more susceptible to these factors because of the immaturity of their immune system. Advanced glycation endproducts (AGE), generated from Maillard reaction which takes place during food processing, are found in the diets of infants. The impact of these contaminants on the development of allergies remains poorly understood. Objectives: In this context, the purpose of this study is to determine if the effect of the Ne-carboxymethyllysine (CML), an AGE present at significant concentration in infant formulas, can alter the CD4+T helper cells (Th) differentiation in vitro. Human naive CD4+CD45RA+ T cells isolated from PBMC were cultured in the presence of activating beads (anti-CD3/CD28) in the absence (negative control Th0) or presence of interleukin-4 (IL-4) (Positive control) and under same conditions in the presence of 10-30-100-300 or 550 lmol/L of CML. Phenotypic analysis of Th2 cells was performed by flow cytometry using specific extracellular (CD4+CD25+) and intracellular markers (IL4+) and by RT-qPCR through the analysis of specific Th cell subsets transcription factors. The expression of RAGE, the receptor of AGE, was also investigated by RT-qPCR. Results: Th cells stimulated or not by IL-4 and cultured in the presence of 300 and 550 lmol/L CML have a two fold greater proliferation than the control condition. The highest dose of CML induces an increase in the production of IL-4 and an overexpression of GATA3 (transcription factor specific for Th2 cells) and RAGE in Th cells activated by IL-4 compared to the controls. Transforming growth factor-b1 (TGF-b1) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) are cytokines defined by their ability to suppress pathological immune responses in the settings of allergy and inflammatory diseases. The regulatory activity of these cytokines is achieved by effects on the cell differentiation state and by the inhibition of cytokines involved in inflammation and allergy, thus playing an important role against the development of immunological disorders. Hence, peptides that mimic the active core of TGF-b1 or IL-10 cytokines could be highly promising candidates for immune modulation.Objectives: In the present study, TGF-b1-and IL-10-like peptides were selected and evaluated for their in vitro and in vivo capabilities of modulating the immune response under inflammatory and allergic conditions.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF60": {"text": "This research was supported by the Brazilian funding agency Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient \u0131fico e Tecnol ogico-CNPq (401131/2014-9), the National Institute of Science and Technology in Theranostics and Nanobiotechnology (CNPq 465669/2014-0), and the University of Salzburg.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF61": {"text": "Introduction: In allergic asthma, a CD4+ T helper 2 (Th2) cell signature dominates the inflammatory response and is amplified in selfenforcing loops.

Despite IG therapy CVID patients frequently develop chronic damage, autoimmunity, granulomatous inflammation, lymphoproliferative disorders, and malignancies, that affect Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL).Generic instrument to asses HRQoL has been used to compare general population or chronic diseases to CVID. Recently, the first CVID-specific tool, the CVID_QoL questionnaire, has been validated with the purpose to catch the detailed impact of the disease onHRQoL. The instrument includes three dimensions: Emotional Functioning (EF), Relational Functioning (RF) and Gastrointestinal and Skin Symptoms (GSS).Objectives: Here we use the CVID_QoL questionnaire to quantify the impact of clinical manifestations, immunological characteristics and therapy schedule on HRQoL in a large cohort of CVID adults.Results: One hundred fifty-four CVID from Referral Center for Primary Immunodeficiency of Rome completed the CVID_QoL.Immunoglobulin route of administration, therapy setting, clinical and immunological data were collected from medical files. CVID_QoL, EF and RF scales correlated with age. The duration of disease did not influence HRQoL. No difference were observed between patients receiving SCIG and IVIG; no correlation was found between IgG trough level or Ig serum level at diagnosis and CVID_QoL scores. Being female, underweight, admitted in hospital, having a previous diagnosis of cancer or chronic comorbidities, taking polymedication and having an unexplained persistent enteropathy proved to be major risk factors associated with a poor health status. In particular, females had severe scores in the emotional dimension, while relational and symptoms dimension scores were similar in men and women. The number of infection correlated with a poorer HRQoL status. The experience of pneumonia, relapsing episodes of diarrhea (>4 for year), sinusitis and bronchitis (>2 for year) was associate to more severe CVID_QoL scores.Conclusions:The study provides the impact of immunological, clinical and therapy-related factors assessed by CVID_QoL on the burden of disease in adults patient with CVID. Primary antibody deficiency (PAD) are characterized by increased susceptibility to infections. Early diagnosis and treatment reduce morbidity and mortality. The replacement therapy with immunoglobulin reduces the risk of acute respiratory infections, but has low efficacy to reduce chronic lung complications that represent the principal morbidity factor. Patients with primary immunodeficiencies who have respiratory infections and develop lung damage may take advantage of a more aggressive therapeutic strategy: antibiotic prophylaxis of infectious episodes and cycles of respiratory rehabilitation. At now, data on antibiotic prophylaxis are uncertain. Objectives: We conducted a multi-center (7 adult and paediatric centers) randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial on 89 patients (age 12-74) with PAD (X-linked agammaglobulinemia or Common variable Immunodeficiency) and COPD with recurrent exacerbations. All patients had COPD confirmed by spirometry. Written informed consent was obtained. The aim of the study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of low-dose of azithromycin (250 mg 3 times for week for 3 consecutive days) for 24 months vs placebo. In patients under azithromycin prophylaxis we expect a decrease of acute COPD exacerbations (reduction of dyspnea, cough, sputum volume and purulence), no use of additional antibiotics, an increase of respiratory volumes (FEV1), an improvement of the Health Related Quality of Life measures. Results: The study started on June 2014 and has been lasted 30 months (24 months of therapy, 6 months of follow-up). Monthly we evaluate: lung function by FEV1 and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, sputum sample for microbiological assessment, routine and immunological blood test, diary card for use of additional antibioticsTo our knowledge our study is the first one on antibiotic prophylaxis in patients affected by primary antibody deficiencies. 0311 | IgM and IgA anti-pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides as prognostic tool for common variable immunodeficiency: A longitudinal study Pulvirenti F; Cavaliere MF; Milito C; Carello R; Pesce AM; Quinti I Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy Introduction: The clinical spectrum of CVID ranges from a poorly symptomatic form to severe phenotypes characterized by high susceptibility to infections, autoimmunity, granulomatous inflammation, lymphoproliferative disorders, and malignancies. Due to high prognosis heterogeneity, prognostic factors are required. Objectives: With the aim to identify additional prognostic factors, we evaluated the anti-polysaccharide IgA and IgM responses by Elisa assay in 75 CVID in a longitudinal study over a 6-year period. Patients were immunized at baseline with the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (Pneumovax \u00ae ). Twenty healthy donors (HD) were also included. Results: As expected, CVID patient had lower IgM/IgA response than HD. For CVID, four immunological phenotypes were identified by post-vaccination IgM and IgA levels: IgM/IgA responders (16%), IgM-only responders (21%) and non-responders (63%).

IVIg are widely used in hypogammaglobulinemia secondary to B-CLL and Multiple Myeloma (MM). SCIg represent an effective, safe and well-tolerated treatment approach in PID, but no extensive data are available on their use in secondary hypogammaglobulinemia (SID). In particular, limited data are available on their use in hypogammaglobulinemia occurring after anti-CD20 treatment in Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas (NHL), as well as in immune-mediated disorders. Objectives: In this retrospective, single center study we evaluated efficacy and safety of SCIg treatment (>6 months) in a cohort of 203 patients with PID and SID. Serum IgG trough levels, SCIg dosage and infusion schedule, adverse events and infection rate were compared between PID and SID. A subgroup analysis on health-related QoL parameters was performed, by using TSQM and SF-36 questionnaires. Different SCIg formulations (16%, 16.5%, 20%, 10% facilitated) were used. Results: PID patients (n=79) presented CVID (69), Agammaglobulinemia (2) and IgG subclass deficiency (8). SID patients included 38 NHL, 55 B-CLL, 19 MM and 12 patients with immune-mediated disorders. Mean age was 48.2AE11.6 for PID and 69AE11.5 for SID. Mean duration of SCIg treatment was 33.5AE19.5 months (range 7-120 months; 44.1AE23.5 in PID, 26.7AE12.3 in SID). In both groups, SCIg appeared to be effective in replacing Ig deficiency and reducing the infection rate; similar IgG trough levels and QoL results were achieved. A low number of adverse events, mainly local, was registered, with no serious adverse events.

The first patient (71 years old) came to our attention for sensory ataxia, paraparesis and dysesthesia of the lower limbs, weakness of the right hand and neurogenic bladder. The second one (57 years old) presented with atasso-spastic gait, tetra-hyperre-flexia and difficulty in emptying the bladder. A laboratory evaluation showed in both cases decreased serum levels of all immunoglobulin isotypes and low specific antibody responses. In their past history both patients reported recurrent infections, thus allowing the diagnosis of CVID. The last patient (43 years old) had a history of post-traumatic panniculitis since 2010 with lymphedema and elephantiasis of forearm. She developed frequent infections of subcutaneous tissue, often followed by systemic complications and need of hospitalization. An acute respiratory failure supported by H. influenzae type B infection was followed by a post-infectious acute myelitis with residual paraparesis and neurogenic bladder. The presence of severe recurrent infections in a subject with no others obvious causes led us to undertake an immunological research which detected an isolated deficit with decreased serum levels of IgG3 (170 mg/ l). Results: All patients received high dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) 2 g/Kg/month. After three months the first and third patient, were switched to 20% subcutaneous immunoglobulin (20% SCIg); the second patient maintains IVIg therapy at dose of 30g/month. At three years follow-up, the response to treatment was good and no relapses occurred. Conclusions: There have been few reports on neurological autoimmune disorders associated with PADs of the adult. The use of immunoglobulin as replacement therapy of the PAD seems also to be effective in protecting the recurrence of such manifestations. , Hospital de Santa Maria (HSM), Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Norte EPE, Immunoallergology Unit, Hospital Dr. N elio Mendon\u00e7a, SESARAM, EPE, Funchal, Lisbon, Portugal; 2 Immunoallergology Department, Hospital de Santa Maria (HSM), Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Norte EPE, Primary Immunodeficiencies Center, Lisbon (HSM/FMUL/IMM), Lisbon, Portugal; 3 Immunoallergology Department, Hospital de Santa Maria (HSM), Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Norte EPE, Lisbon, Portugal; 4 Immunoallergology Department, Hospital de Santa Maria (HSM), Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Norte EPE, University Clinic of Immunoallergology, Faculty of Medicine of University of Lisbon (FMUL), Lisbon, Portugal Case Report: Introduction: X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is a primary immunodeficiency caused by mutations in Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK).

However, there are few studies investigating genetic effects on production of these arachidonic acid metabolites.Objectives: To investigate the genetic effects on production of arachidonic acid metabolites related with asthma pathogenesis.Results: A total of 95 aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) and 94 aspirin tolerant asthma (ATA) patients were enrolled.Serum samples were collected from all of the study subjects whereas urine samples were collected from 45 AERD and 44 ATA patients when the asthma was stable. Serum and urine samples were also collected after the lysine-aspirin bronchoprovocation test (Lys-ASA BPT). The metabolites of LTE 4, 15-HETE and eoxin C 4 were analyzed using the UHPLC/Q-ToF MS system. HLA-DPB1 high-resolution genotyping was obtained from direct sequencing method and polymorphisms of CysLTR1 \u00c0634C>T, LTC4S \u00c0444A>C, ALOX15 \u00c0272C>A and ALOX15 \u00c0427 G>A were genotyped using SNaP shot ddNTP primer extension kit. The levels of urine LTE 4 were significantly higher in patients carrying HLA-DPB1*0301 (P=.041), while no differences were found in serum LTE 4 . The asthmatic patients with the TT genotype at CYSLTR1 \u00c0634C>T had significantly higher levels of urine LTE 4 (P=.015), but no differences were found in serum LTE 4 levels. The levels of urine and serum 15-HETE were not significantly different according to the genotype of ALOX15 polymorphisms. The levels of urine/ serum LTE 4 and eoxin C 4 were not significantly different according to the genotype of LTC4S polymorphisms. The levels of serum eoxin C 4 in AERD patients with the AA genotype at LTC4S \u00c0444A>C were significantly increased after Lys-ASA BPT, while the AERD patients with AC/CC genotype showed no significant changes.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were recently reported as being involved in the immune response. However, whether lncRNAs are associated with iPSC-MSC immunomodulation in allergic inflammation is still unclear. Objectives: We hypothesized that lncRNAs also had important biological functions in airway allergic inflammation and iPSC-MSCmediated immunomodulation. This study aimed to identify aberrantly expressed lncRNA profiles after asthma induction and iPSC-MSC treatment.Results: In vivo study mice were induced into an asthmatic state and received treatment consisting of iPSC-MSCs. In vitro study Memory T cells isolated from sensitized mice were challenged and co-cultured with iPSC-MSCs. iPSC-MSCs significantly prevented asthma inflammation in vivo and decreased the Th2 cytokine levels in vitro. Over 1300 lncRNAs were differentially expressed after the induction of asthma, and 846 or 4176 lncRNAs were differentially expressed with iPSC-MSC treatment in mice or in vitro, respectively. After overlapping the differentially expressed lncRNAs produced in a similar manner in mice and in vitro, 23 lncRNAs and 96 mRNAs were selected, in which 58 protein-coding genes were predicted to be potential targets of the 23 lncRNAs. Furthermore, using a series of bioinformatics technologies, 9 lncRNAs co-expressed with the most differentially expressed mRNAs, which were enriched in terms of the immune response, were screened out via Pearson's correlation coefficient with mRNAs that were involved with inflammatory cytokines and receptors. lncRNAs-MM9LINCRNAEXON12105+ and AK089315 were finally emphasized via qRT-PCR validation.Conclusions: Our results suggested that aberrant lncRNA profiles were present after asthma induction and iPSC-MSC treatment, Allergic rhinitis with asthma is a common allergic reactions and related diseases, with the incidence in the normal population generally higher. In recent years, more and more evidence suggests that the incidence of allergic rhinitis with asthma involves regulations of multiple genes. In this research, through exploring the gene expression profiles of allergic rhinitis with asthma by RNAseq technology, the differences of gene expression profiles was analyzed, providing a research basis on the mechanism of allergic rhinitis with asthma.Objectives: To construct related gene expression profile of allergic rhinitis with asthma and screen the pathogenic genes.Results: Compared AR with asthma group to the control group, there 89 related genes were found and 16 genes were up-regulated, 73 genes were down-regulated. Furthermore, there 17 genes(ADAM33, BCL6, IFNGR2, IL12A, IL12B, IL13RA1, IL17A, IL31, IL4R, IL5, KIT, LTB4R, MS4A2, RORC, STAT5A, STAT6, TBX21) differentially expressed. Compared AR with asthma group to the AR group, there also 89 related genes were found and 1 gene differentially expressed.Conclusions: Using Allergy & Asthma PCR Array, we preliminarily constructed the aberrant gene expression profile of AR with asthma and ADAM33, BCL6, IFNGR2, IL12A, IL12B, IL13RA1, IL17A, IL31, IL4R, IL5, KIT, LTB4R, MS4A2, RORC, STAT5A, STAT6, TBX21 are the possible pathogenic genes of AR with asthma.

The association of the CD14 C-159T SNP and sputum levels of sCD14 in fixed/reversible airflow obstructive asthma patients has not been characterized. Objectives: The C-159T polymorphism of CD14 receptor gene was studied in 151 patients with fixed and 180 reversible asthma. The degree of obstruction was determined by the post-bronchodilator ratio of FEV1 / FVC. The fixed obstruction phenotype had a ratio of FEV1 / FVC<0.7 (70%) whereas reversible was >0.7. The control group included 285 non-atopic volunteers.

Large wheal size in pre-SCIT skin prick tests to relevant allergens and histamine proved predictive of local, but not systemic reactions, while levels of specific IgE did not appear to have significant influence. SEs were more common in monosensitized patients (OR=1.7).

LETI Pharma GmbH took the opportunity to perform a similar analysis of the incidences of serious adverse reactions (SAR).Objectives: Pharmacovigilance (PV) requires the careful collection, detection, assessment, monitoring, and prevention of adverse effects with pharmaceutical products. We used our PV database to analyze the incidence of serious adverse reactions occurring in the course of treatment with a depigmented polymerized allergen preparation of pollen and mites. Spontaneously reported SARs from 01.01.2001 to 31.12.2013 in Germany were analyzed. As for the analysis of the PEI, the number of presumed injections per vial was used as a basis for calculations: From vial 1 of depigmented polymerized allergen extract 2 injections are administered and from vial 2, 5 or 6 injections are administered depending on the conventional or rush dosing schedule.Results: In total 32 spontaneous serious adverse reactions (in 32 patients) were reported. Separated per allergen group 15 SAEs followed injections with depigmented polymerized mite allergen extract, 17 in relation with depigmented polymerized pollen extracts. Taking the different dosing schemes into account the incidences of SAR is 0.00046% (1:216281 injections). This refers to an incidence of 0.00077% in mite treatment and an incidence of 0.00034% in pollen treatment. Conclusions: The calculation based on the number of sold vials and the possible injections of depigmented polymerized pollen & mite allergen extract showed a very low risk of serious ADRs. Even if criteria for serious assessment have changed and increased over the time we observe a lower incidence with depigmented polymerized allergen extracts compared to the incidence published by PEI of 0.01%-0.0005% for polymerized allergen extracts. School of Medicine, Suwon, South Korea Introduction: Surfactant protein D (SP-D) is a member of the collectin family that has an important role against lung infection and asthma. Moreover, SP-D dysfunction is related with several pulmonary diseases as it regulates inflammation. However, the function of SP-D in the pathogenesis of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is still unclear. Objectives: To understand the role of SP-D in airway mechanisms of AERD. Results: Serum SP-D levels were significantly lower in patients with AERD compared to those of ATA (P<.001). Moreover, AERD patients carrying the CC genotype at 2538C>T were significantly higher than ATA patients (P=.027) and serum SP-D levels were significantly different according to this genetic polymorphism. Conclusions: These findings suggest that decreased level of SP-D may contribute to promote airway inflammation in the pathogenic mechanism of AERD. 0379 | What happens to basophils and mediators of tryptase, lxa4, and cyslt during aspirin desensitization?

However, limited data is available on how aspirin desensitization works.Objectives: We aimed to study the mechanisms underlying aspirin desensitization by examining basophil activation (CD203c expression), mediator-released tryptase, CysLT, LXA 4 , and LTB 4 receptor expression for the first 3 months of AD.The study was conducted in patients with NERD who underwent aspirin desensitization (group 1: n=23), patients with NERD who received no desensitization (group 2: n=22), and healthy volunteers(group 3, n=13). All participants provided blood samples for flow cytometry studies (CD203c and LTB 4 receptor), and mediator releases (CysLT, LXA 4, and tryptase) for the relevant time points determined. Results: All baseline parameters of CD203c and LTB 4 receptor expressions, tryptase, CysLT, and LXA 4 releases were similar in each group (P>.05). In group 1, CD203c started to be upregulated at the time reactions during AD, and continued to be high for 3 months. CD203c expressions were similar at the other time points in group 2 and 3. All other study parameters were comparable with baseline and at the other time points in each group (P>.05). Conclusions: Our results showed that although basophils were active during the first 3 months of AD, no releases of CysLT, tryptase or LXA 4 existed. Therefore, our results suggested that despite active basophils, inhibition of mediators can at least partly explain the good clinical outcomes seen in the first three months of AD. 0380 | Desensitization to acetylsalicylic acids in patients with SAPHO syndrome Candon Morillo R; Burgos Montero AM; Proy Vega B; Gonzalez Sanchez L; Moreno Mata E; Garcia Rodriguez C Hospital General Mancha Centro, Alcazar De San Juan (Ciudad Real), Spain Introduction: A 53 year-old woman with a history of suspected allergy to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), migraines, colon polyposis, chronic bronchitis, SAPHO syndrome (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis and osteitis), psoriatic arthritis with serological lupus anticoagulant, vasovagal pre-syncope, epilepsy and restless legs syndrome and supraventricular tachycardia.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF117": {"text": "Current treatment: levetiracetam, tiotropium, flecainide, ticlopidine, methotrexate, lederfolin, Leflunomide.

Many are labeled ''allergic'' without reliable testing. Drug provocation test (DPT) is the most sensitive test in allergological work-up for drug allergy, and its specificity is close to 100%, particularly in nonimmediate reactions (NIR). However, many questions remain, among them whether a full therapeutic course should be given instead of one total cumulative dose in order to improve the sensitivity of the DPT.Objectives: To evaluate the diagnostic failures of a DPT with only one total dose in a group of patients who developed MPE temporarily associated with administration of penicillins. Results: In this retrospective study we analyzed 111 patients that underwent standard DPT with penicillins, 59 for investigation of MPE. Two of those had immediate and another 2 a delayed positive DPT. The remaining 54 (negative DPT) answered a phone questionnaire. These patients had a mean age of 25.4AE22 years (28 were children or adolescents), 55.4% female. The suspected penicillin was: amoxicillin/clavulanate (25), amoxicillin (16), penicillin G Only 4 of the 111 patients had positive DPT, supporting that the vast majority of reactions developing during an antibiotic course are driven by an infectious process in susceptible individuals. It is therefore imperative an adequate diagnostic investigation. An important percentage of patients refused to take penicillins again in spite of the negative DPT. This highlights the need to improve doctor-patient communication, reassuring the high negative predictive value of DPT. Only 1 patient with negative DPT had a posterior possible reaction to amoxicillin, suggesting that a full course DPT doesn't offer a relevant improvement of sensitivity to diagnostic work-up of delayed allergic reactions to penicillins. 0382 | Do skin tests predict next perioperative allergic reaction after perioperative anaphylaxis?

Objectives: We aim to determine the importance of skin tests for diagnosing perioperative anaphylaxis with IgE dependent mechanisms in our clinics between January 2014-May 2016. Results: 35 patients (31 female, 4 male) were searched. Mean age was 48 (20-78). 16 of females and 1 of males, totally 17(48%) of them had anaphylactic reactions in their medical history. Other atopic diseases were; 13 had other types of drug allergies, 4 had allergic rhinitis/asthma, 4 had urticaria/angioedema and 2 had cosmetics and chemical products allergy. 12 of them had no other atopic diseases. Skin tests with latex and general anesthetics were positive in 21 patient (60%). Between those patients with positive skin tests, 1) skin tests were positive. There were no positive skin tests with local anesthetics, etomidate, thiopental, suxamethonium and pancuronium. Totally 20 (57%) patients had operation without any complications. It is remarkable that 10 of them had perioperative anaphylactic reaction histories and positive skin tests. They had operation with different drugs from the culprit ones and had no perioperative reactions.Conclusions: In this study, skin tests showed positivity in 82% of patients with perioperative anaphylaxis history. So, skin tests' predictivity of IgE mediated reactions was found remarkably high for next operation (82%). To do skin tests with suspicious drugs should be essential for perioperative anaphylaxis. Totally, 57% of 35 patients were operated. 58% of patients with perioperative anaphylaxis and positive skin tests were operated without any complications. 40% of 35 patients with negative skin tests were thought to be related with non IgE mediated mechanisms. 18 of 35 patients hadn't any perioperative anaphylaxis history but 7 of them had positive skin test, so those positivities were thought to be related to earlier sensitizations with cosmetics and chemical products similar to neuromuscular blockers.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF119": {"text": "lative dose 350 mg): 3 hours after the first dose, it appeared an itching erythematous lesion with well-defined borders under the left shoulder blade and in the internal arm face.

Although histamine H1 receptor antagonists are recommended as the first choice of agent in the treatment of allergic diseases, the influence of histamine H1 receptor antagonists on periostin production is not well understood. The present study was undertaken to examine the influence of histamine H1 receptor antagonists on periostin production from nasal epithelial cells after IL-4 stimulation in vitro. Objectives: Human nasal epithelial cells (HNEpC) at a concentration of 19105 cells/mL were stimulated with 10.0 ng/mL IL-4 in the presence of various concentrations of either desloratadine (DLT), loratadine(LT), levocetirizine (LCT) or cetirizine (CT). After 48 hours, culture supernatants were collected and assayed for periostin levels by ELISA. The influence of the agents on transcription factor activation, STAT6 and periostin mRNA expression were also examined by ELISA and real-time RT-PCR, respectively through the choice of LCT.Results: Addition of histamine H1 receptor antagonists, DLT, LT, LCT and CT, suppressed the ability of HNEpC to produce periostin in response to IL-4 stimulation in dose-dependent manner. The minimum concentration that caused significant suppression is 0.01 lmol L \u00c01 for DLT, 0.05 lmol L \u00c01 for LT, 0.05 lmol L \u00c01 for LCT and 0.1 lmol L \u00c01 for CT.

The aim of the study was to assess the influence of PMBL on clinical course of asthma in children. Objectives: Randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, parallel-group study was done (EudraCT number: 2013-000737-12 and NCT02541331, EOLIA Study). Total number of 152 children aged 6-16 years with asthma was randomized. 75 children were treated with Polyvalent Mechanical Bacterial Lysate (PMBL; Ismigen \u00ae tablets) once daily per 10 days in each 3 consecutive months as add-on treatment to routine asthma therapy and 77 children with placebo. The protocol included a total of 5 visits: screening/randomization visit (V1), end-of-treatment period visit (12 weeks; V3), follow-up visits (24 weeks; V4 and 36 weeks; V5). Main inclusion criteria were: allergic asthma diagnosis with at least one perennial allergen sensitization, partly controlled or uncontrolled asthma according to the GINA 2012 guidelines prior to V1, already treated with SABA PRN and ICS or ICS+LABA during the previous 3 months and at least 2 exacerbations of asthma within the 12months period before study. Results: The mean number of infections and the % of patients with at least one infection was not significantly different between groups, whatever the study time point. The number of patients with at least one infection leading to exacerbation was significantly lower in the PMBL group at 12 weeks (10 vs 21, P=.002) and over the total study period (22 vs 38, P=.003) in the PMBL and Placebo groups respectively. The percentage of patients without asthma exacerbation was significantly higher at 12 weeks in the PMBL group as compared to the Placebo group (75% vs 57.9%, P=.028). The mean number of asthma exacerbations was significantly lower in the PMBL group as compared to the Placebo group at 12 weeks (0.3AE0.6 vs 0.8AE1.1, P=.009) and over the total study period (1.1AE1.3 vs 1.9AE2.0, P=.011). The time to onset of first asthma exacerbation (event-free time) was not significantly different between groups although. The times to onset of second and third asthma exacerbations were significantly longer for the PMBL group (P=.0024 and P=.0004 respectively). Conclusions: The EOLIA study for the first time clearly demonstrates the efficacy of PMBL in reducing the number of exacerbations in children with allergic asthma. 0403 | Higher parental education reduced the risk of uncontrolled asthma Goks\u00f6r E; Str\u20ac omberg Celind F; Alm B; Vasileiadou S; M\u20ac ollborg P; Pettersson R; Erdes L; \u00c5berg N; Wennergren G Department of pediatrics, Institution of Clinical Sciences, University of Gothenburg, Queen Silvia Children's hospital, Gothenburg, SwedenIntroduction: Treatment with inhaled corticosteroids has resulted in better-controlled asthma disease and substantially reduced need of hospitalisation. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of and risk factors for uncontrolled asthma and hospitalisation due to asthma at the age of 12 years.Objectives: Data were obtained from a longitudinal cohort study of children born in the region of western Sweden in 2003. Parents answered postal questionnaires when the children were six months and one, four, eight and 12 years old. We also obtained data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register. The response rate at the age of 12 was 76% of those to whom the questionnaire was distributed (3637/4777), 64% of the 5654 included at admission in 2003.Asthma control at the age of 12 was examined with ACT TM , Asthma Control Test.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF132": {"text": "Previous observational studies have implied breast milk fatty acid composition may play a role in development of atopic eczema or atopic sensitization in breastfed infants and toddlers.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF133": {"text": ": HDM-sIgE levels were significantly higher in the children who had asthma exacerbation in the fall.

Among the genogroups A, B and C, HRV-A and HRV-C were more prevalent and clinically important than HRV-B. Our published results suggested that HRV-C was associated with childhood asthma exacerbation. However, the clinical manifestations and associations with asthma and different lower respiratory tract infection for different HRV species remain unclear.Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology and disease spectrum of HRV detected in Hong Kong children between 2014 autumn to 2015 spring.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF135": {"text": "and asthma exacerbations, HRV-C was more commonly found than HRV-A (75% vs 25%; OR 2.50, 95% CI 0.66-9.47).

We observed a trend towards changes in HRV from HRV-C in 2014 autumn to HRV-A in 2015 spring (HRV-A: 20.9% vs 34.0%). The predominant HRV serotypes in these two periods changed from HRV-C-8713-MY-10 to HRV-A30/ HRV-C15. Conclusions: HRV is a strong risk factor for asthma exacerbations and wheezing illnesses in Hong Kong children. Although these disease associations were mainly accounted for by HRV-C, the predominant HRV species isolated from our hospitalised children changed from HRV-C in 2014 autumn to HRV-A in 2015 spring.

Conclusions: Early anti-inflammatory therapy and maintenance of long-term total control of asthma not only may prevent progression of disease severity and improve quality of life, but also may allow normal development of pulmonary function and outgrowth of asthma in young children. 0410 | Values of fractional exhaled nitric oxide in diagnosis and treatment of children with chronic cough Jiang W; Zhou J; Hao C Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China Introduction: Cough is a common complaint in pediatrics, and often develops into chronic cough in Chinese children, mainly include cough variant asthma, upper airway cough syndrome, postinfectious cough, and gastroesophageal reflux cough. It was widely recognized that airway inflammation was the foundation of all kinds of causes for chronic cough, and the airway inflammatory markers were of great importance for the detection of chronic cough. Based on this characteristic, noninvasive therapies such as fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) has been developed to detect eosinophilic airway inflammation. Clinical evidences demonstrate that FeNO level could monitor airway inflammation with high specificity and sensitivity, and reflect the level of induced sputum eosinophilia granulocyte, and inflammatory markers in alveolar lavage fluid. In 2005,", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF138": {"text": "Totally, 66 cases were enrolled and divided into 4 groups, including cough variant asthma (CVA, n=13), CVA combined with upper airway cough syndrome (UACS, n=17), UACS (n=26), and another causes group (n=10). Twenty-five healthy subjects were included in the control group. To diagnose CVA from chronic cough, the optimal FeNO cutoff value was 25 ppb, with sensitivity being 84.0%, specificity being 97.1%, positive predictive value being 97.5%, and negative predictive value being 81.4%. FeNO levels were shown to have significant correlations with sputum eosinophils, cough symptom scores (P<.05), and cough scores. Moreover, the decline level of FeNO was significantly related to the degree of the decrease of sputum eosinophils. Conclusions: The study suggests that FeNO measurement might be a better method for diagnosing CVA from chronic cough in children with high sensitivity and specificity. The level of FeNO decreased after anti-inflammatory treatment, which might be a potential marker for sputum eosinophils in children with chronic cough. 0411 | Real-time biofeedback and target minute ventilation in eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation test in children aged 10Pediatrics University Hospital of Kuopio, Kuopio, Finland; 4 Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Turku, Turku, Finland Introduction: Exercise is a common trigger of breathing difficulty in asthma, and dysfunctional breathing disorders may cause exerciseinduced dyspnea (EID) mimicking asthma. Traditional diagnostic methods of asthma have limited diagnostic accuracy in children. For dysfunctional breathing disorders there are currently no efficient non-invasive diagnostic methods available in children. Therefore, new diagnostic methods are required for the differential diagnostics of exercise-induced respiratory symptoms in children. The 6-minute EVH test has mainly been used in the diagnostics of elite athletes' exercise-induced dyspnea but has traditionally been considered to be too hard for children. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of real time biofeedback in achieving the target minute ventilation in the EVH test in children. . Patients were able to follow their levels of ventilation in real time through the research equipment which is new in relation to traditional research equipment. Results: A total of 91.8% of the patients of the control group and 83.5% of the research patients reached the targeted 80% level of minute ventilation; there was no statistically significant difference between the groups (P=.157). A total of 80.3% of the healthy controls and 71.3% of the symptomatic patients reached at least 90% level in minute ventilation (P=.222) Conclusions: The use of real-time biofeedback is feasible and may improve achieving appropriate target minute ventilation in EVH testing in children aged 10-16 years. Using the real-time biofeedback method, the majority of both controls and symptomatic patients came very close to the target minute ventilation. The difference of our study and most previous studies was our possibility of following minute ventilation in real time by the visual graph. Without this possibility the proportion of participants having reached minute ventilation would likely have been significantly smaller 0412 | Evaluation of reversibility with classical spirometry and impulse oscillometry in children with atopic asthma Toprak Kanik E; Yilmaz O; Simsek Y; Yuksel H Celal Bayar University Medical Faculty, Dept. of Pediatric Allergy and Pulmonology, Manisa, TurkeyIntroduction: Evaluation of respiratory mechanisms in pediatric asthma is essential both clinically and to understand the pathophysiological background of the disease.

CBPhG is a method of registration of respiratory sounds, that is recorded by high sensitivity transducer in wide range of frequencies during quiet breathing: low 0.2-1.2, middle >1.2-5.0 and high frequency >5.0 kHz. We evaluated the acoustic component of the work of breathing (AC) in mJ Objectives: Rate the degree of airway obstruction and the effectiveness of children's therapy with AR during an exacerbation. Results: We selected 72 patients (age 3-16 years) with an exacerbation of moderate AR. All the children had rhinorrhea, sneezing and itchy nose. Patients were divided into 2 groups. 1 group (34 children) administrated antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids, decongestants as needed. Group 2 (38 children)-in addition to this therapy leukotriene receptor antagonists (ALR) montelukast in age dosage was added. We evaluated AC before and after 2 weeks of therapy. AC was increased in the low frequency range in all the children, which correlates with the obstruction of the upper respiratory tract. Symptoms of nasal obstruction in children's therapy decreased in both groups, but more significant in group 2. Initially AC in the low frequency range was 254.8AE48.3 mcJ, in the middle frequency range-8.2AE4.2 mcJ, in the high frequency range-0.15AE0.05 mcJ.

Immunological Research, University of Cartagena, Cartagena, Colombia; 2 Group of Clinical and Experimental Allergy, IPS Universitaria, University of Antioquia, Medell \u0131n, Colombia Introduction: There are few birth cohorts analyzing IgE sensitization in the Tropics Objectives: We aimed to describe the frequency of sensitization, risk factors and evolution of specific IgE responses to house dust mite allergens and Ascaris in the FRAAT cohort during the first 6 years of life. Specific IgE to several allergens were measured by ImmunoCap in 230 children at 6 years-old. The relationships of sensitization to Blomia tropicalis, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Ascaris spp. with different socio-demographic factors and maternal data (sensitization and allergic phenotypes) were evaluated by logistic regression. Also, in a sub-sample of children (n=159) with available specific IgE data at 2-3 years, 4 years and 6 years, the evolution of sensitization was analyzed Results: Blomia tropicalis and Ascaris were the most important sensitizers at 6 years (40.9% and 38.9%, respectively) followed by American cockroach (20.4%) and D. pteronyssinus (16.1%). Sensitization to cat, dog, milk and egg were below 5%. Male gender and maternal Ascaris sensitization were significantly associated to a positive IgE response against this nematode at 6 years. Several poverty/ unhygienic indicators were found as risk factors for Ascaris sensitization; but in regard to B. tropicalis this only occurs at 2-3 years-old. Maternal high total IgE and B. tropicalis sensitization were found as novel risk factors for B. tropicalis sensitization at 6 years; especially if only new sensitizations were considered in the analysis. For B. tropicalis and Ascaris, it was found that early sensitization (2-3 years) persisted over time (66.6% and 76.5% at 6 years, respectively). B.tropicalis sensitization tended to increase with age [2-3 years: 30.2%, 4 years: 36.5%, 6 years: 39.6% in the subgroup, P=.08), but this trend was significant for Ascaris [2-3 years: 21.9%, 4 years: 35.4%, 6 years: 36.7%; P=.005]. In contrast, D. pteronyssinus sensitization kept constant over time (2-3 years: 13.1%, 4 years: 11.9% and 6 years: 13.1%, P=1.00) Conclusions: IgE responses to B. tropicalis and D. pteronyssinus are different during infancy, being Blomia tropicalis the most important sensitizer. Risk factors for Ascaris and B. tropicalis sensitization are different at 6 years; poverty/unhygienic conditions increase the risk of nematode sensitization but do not influence sensitization to mite allergens Center-Institute of Immunology, FMBA of Russia, Moscow, Russia; 2 Moscow State Academy for Veterinary Medicine and Biotechnology named after Scriabin K.I., Moscow, Russia Introduction: Epidemiological studies showed that among all viral pathogens respiratory viruses are the most prevalent (more than 90% of all cases of infectious diseases). One of the most common viral pathogen is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) which affects the lower airways. It is well known that RSV lead to increased attacks in asthma patients. Natural anti-viral peptides are capable activate innate immune system and affect virions directly. Synthetic peptides are more cheaper compared to natural ones, so the purpose of this research-the study of the antiviral properties of synthetic peptides against RSV infection.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF142": {"text": "AA of the peptides was studied in a model of RSV infection of MA-104 cells. Solutions of the peptides in nontoxic concentrations were incubated with RSV strain A2 (initial titer in 10 5 TCID 50 /mL) for one hour followed by titration on MA-104 cell monolayer. Five days after the infection RSV cytopathic effect was evaluated by light microscopy. MTT-assay showed that 5 of 16 peptides exhibited cytotoxicity on Hela cells in concentration range from 2.5 to 0.005 mg/mL. Calculated IC 50 for peptides NC-783, NC-810, LO-7, NC785 and AS-543 were 0.04, 0.05, 0.94, 1.6 and 1.85 mg/mL, respectively. Nontoxic concentrations of the peptides were testes in RSV infection model in vitro. Antiviral activity evaluation showed that 8 out of 16 peptides exhibited significant AA against RSV. Linear cationic peptides NC-788, LO-7, KO-1, IA-2, AS-543 and NC-737 demonstrated reduction of RSV titer by 10, 10, 25, 11, 11 and 14 times, respectively. Helical cationic peptide NC-785 reduced RSV titer in 13 times. Dendrimeric peptide LTP with strong positive charge exhibited maximal 99-fold reduction of RSV titer. The possible mechanism of AA of studied peptides is the direct destruction of the bilayer membrane of the RSV virions. Conclusions: Seven synthetized linear and helical peptides are capable from 10 to 25 times inhibit RSV infection in vitro in nontoxic concentrations. Dendrimeric cationic peptide LTP which reduced It has been suggested previously that human neutrophils may acquire features of antigen-presenting cells. For example, they upregulate the expression of MHC class II molecules in the presence of GM-CSF and IFN-c. However, their capacity to process antigens and present peptides via HLA class II has been debated. We studied human neutrophils in comparison to monocytes for their ability to internalize, process and present antigens to CD4+ T cells, employing the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 as model. Objectives: Neutrophils isolated from the peripheral blood of allergic donors were cultured with GM-CSF, IL-3 and IFN-c and analyzed for their expression of HLA-DR, CD80 and CD86 by flow cytometry. pHrodo-labelled Bet v 1 was employed to determine internalization and intracellular degradation by neutrophils and monocytes. Degradation kinetics of Bet v 1 with endolysosomal proteases from either cell type were measured by capture ELISA. Proteolytic fragments were analyzed using mass spectrometry. Finally, Bet v 1-pulsed neutrophils and monocytes were co-cultured with Bet v 1-specific T-cells and proliferative and cytokine responses of T cells were assessed. Results: In the presence of IL-3, GM-CSF and IFN-c, neutrophils significantly upregulated the expression of HLA-DR. The expression of CD80 was only marginally enhanced and CD86 was not detectable. Neutrophils internalized Bet v 1 as effectively as monocytes. In contrast to monocyte-derived endolysosomal proteases, neutrophilic proteases rapidly degraded Bet v 1 and digested it completely within 3-6 hours. However, the proteolytic fragments contained the most relevant T-cell epitopes. Neutrophils pulsed with Bet v 1 induced proliferation of all Bet v 1-specific T-cell clones specific for various epitopes distributed over the entire amino acid sequence of Bet v 1. The clones produced a similar cytokine profile as cells stimulated by monocytes.Conclusions: Our results provide strong evidence that neutrophils may acquire all features of antigen-presenting cells, including antigen processing and MHC class II-mediated presentation to effector T cells.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF143": {"text": "Introduction: Recent studies demonstrated that cytokine IL-33 is upregulated in bronchial asthma (BA) patients.

In addition, SA is being discussed as possible triggering agent of allergic disease, including intrinsic asthma.Objectives: The objective of this study was to investigate the possible role of SA as a developmental agent of asthma. To elucidate the effect of SA infection on asthma development, normal primary epithelial cells (NHBEs) and asthmatic patient's primary epithelial cells (DHBEs) were treated with SA (MOI 100, 0, 1, and 4 hours).We first conducted cell viability test and adhesion & invasion assays.After treatment of SA, supernatants from both cells were collected to measure cytokine and chemokine expression. Total RNA was isolated from the cells, and RT-PCR was performed to analyze the changes of gene expression. For further analysis of gene expression, RNA-sequencing was performed using the illumina Hiseq 2500.Results: To confirm whether SA was infected into the primary lung epithelial cells, we tested expression of virulence factors. Lipoteichoic acid, peptidoglycan, and hyaluronidase activity were time-dependently increased on NHBEs and DHBEs cells by SA infection. The hyaluronidase activity was significantly increased on DHBEs cells compared to normal cells. SA infection increased various kinds of mRNA expression and protein production related with inflammatory cytokine and chemokine on primary lung epithelial cells. We found that MIP-2, TNF-a, and PDGF-BB were evaluated on SA treated primary epithelial cells.Especially, the IL-6 and IL-8 (P<.01) were significantly increased on SA infected asthmatic primary epithelial cells compared to normal cells.According to the results by RNA-seq analysis, over 3000 genes exhibited up-regulated or down-regulated on SA infected epithelial cells.For example, CCL2, CXCL5, IL-23, TGF-b, and MMP13 (fold change>2, P<.05), those related cells proliferation, migration, immuneregulation and inflammatory processes, were elevated. IPA analysis showed that TGF-b, TNF, and HGF (P<10 \u00c06 ) were activated on asthmatic primary epithelial cells, which are related to the inflammatory responses, organismal injury and abnormalities. Conclusions: In this study, we showed that SA infection increased TGF-b, IL-23, PDGF-BB, CXCL5, and TNF expression on asthmatic primary lung epithelial cells. SA infection may accelerate cell proliferation, migration, and inflammation on asthmatic lung primary epithelial, thereby developing asthma. Fungal spores are one of the major types of microorganisms, can be present in all hospital environments, may be transmitted through air, patients and air conditions. It appears that adequate information on the nosocomial fungal allergy in hospital environment of West Bengal are largely lacking though 10% of the patients' infections are suspected to be hospital-acquired.

Both groups followed the same age-dependent pattern with a high RA of Actinobacteria and low RA of Firmicutes at 4 months with the opposite pattern at 8 years of age (P<.01). At 4 months of age LDA revealed that the gut microbiome of children that later developed IgE-associated allergic disease was significantly enriched in Bacteroidetes compared to the non-allergic group; Bacteroidaceae remained significantly higher at 6 months of age. At 8 years of age, the gut microbiome of healthy children was enriched in Lactobacillaceae, Enterococcaceae and Lachnospira whereas the RA of Bifidobacteriaceae was lower compared to that of allergic children.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been known to have an immunomodulatory effect. There is little information about immune mechanism of therapeutic effect of MSC for AD.Objectives: We investigated immunologic mechanism of therapeutic effect of human umbilical cord derived MSC (UC-MSC) for AD using a murine model.Results:We applied Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) extract (40 lg) to the dorsal skin of BALB/c mice 5 times a week repeatedly with an interval of 2 weeks to induce AD-like skin lesions. UC-MSCs (2x10 7 /mL) were injected subcutaneously at the last day of Af application. The clinical score and transepidermal water loss were decreased after subcutaneous injection of UC-MSCs. Moreover, UC-MSCs inhibited eosinophilic infiltration in skin lesions, and decreased the levels of total IgE. The levels of IFN-c and IL-13 were not decreased, but the level of IL-17 was decreased in skin draining lymph node (LN) of UC-MSC group, compared to those in skin draining LN of AD group.In addition, there is no significant difference in the percent of regulatory T cells of skin draining LN between AD and UC-MSC groups.Conclusions: UC-MSCs alleviated AD-skin lesion and decreased T helper 17 (Th17) immune response in a murine model, which suggest therapeutic potential of UC-MSCs through the modulation of Th17 immune response for human atopic dermatitis.

While HRV infection causes less cytopathology compared to other respiratory virus infections, it is frequently associated with potentiation and exacerbation of chronic pulmonary diseases such as asthma. Currently, there are limited in vitro models on HRV infection of upper airway epithelial cells compared to lower airway despite nasal epithelium being the first contact site of the virus, and the connectivity of the airways. Objectives: Hence, using the model of HRV infection of in vitro differentiated human nasal epithelial cells (hNECs), we established a system to systematically study the viral replication kinetics, host responses and their association with HRV pathogenesis and disease progression. Results: By infecting in vitro differentiated hNECs from multiple individuals in air-liquid interface culture, we found that individualderived hNECs were susceptible to HRV infection, and that HRV mainly targeted ciliated cells of hNECs. HRV preferentially induced the TLR7/IRF7/IFN-b and IFN-k1 pathways for antiviral responses in hNECs. qPCR analysis of chemokine genes suggested predominant signaling for recruitment of T helper 1 cells (T H 1) and in the progression of innate to adaptive immunity, with CXCL9, IP-10, CXCL11 and RANTES identified as the likely initiator of immune responses in the lower airway following infection. Comparison of the HRV infection with an influenza infection in the same model highlighted key differences that may be explored for HRV specific pathogenesis, and through this comparison, we further identified 11 genes that may be responsible in conferring one of the different feature in pathogenesis between HRV and influenza. Conclusions: Overall, this in vitro hNEC HRV infection model provides a platform for repeated, controlled studies of HRV infection in the nasal epithelium in multiple individuals, revealing novel insights into viral replication dynamics and HRV-induced disease burden in human nasal epithelium.

In addition, a skewed T-helper (T H ) profile in early life is implicated as a risk factor in allergic disease. This skewness might indeed be genetic but also caused by environmental cues. A reduced or altered microbial exposure during childhood may inaccurately direct the maturing immune system and promote allergy development. Objectives: To investigate allergy prevalence during the first 10 years of life in a Swedish prospective birth cohort and evaluate the possible influence of heredity, lactobacilli-colonization and plasma cytokine-and chemokine-profiles on allergy development. 281 children participating in a prospective birth cohort were clinically examined at 6 months and 1, 2, 5 and 10 years of age. Skin prick test (SPT), specific IgE-levels and allergic symptoms were evaluated. For a subgroup of children, fecal samples were collected during infancy (\u22642 months of age) and the presence of lactobacilli was investigated with RT PCR. The levels of cytokines and chemokines in plasma were quantified by ELISA and Luminex. Results: Among the children that developed allergy, there was a larger proportion of children with double allergic heredity. Increased plasma levels of the T H -related chemokines BCA-1/CXCL13 (T FH ), TARC/CCL17 (T H 2), MDC/CCL22 (T H 2) and MIP-3a/CCL20 (T H 17) in the first year of life associated with becoming allergic later in life. Early-life lactobacilli-colonization was connected to a reduced prevalence of allergy, despite allergic heredity. Notably, lactobacilli-colonized children had lower plasma levels of the chemokines BCA-1/ CXCL13 and MDC/CCL22, and higher levels of IFN-c. Conclusions: Having two allergic parents associated with becoming allergic. Increased levels of T H 2, T H 17 and T FH -related chemokines in the first year of life may predict later development of allergy. Lactobacilli-colonization associated with remaining non-allergic and with an altered cytokine-and chemokine-pattern. Hence, lactobacilli-colonization in infancy could be indicative of a beneficial immunematuration and a reduced risk to develop allergy. The interaction of virus infection and the host elements is one of the determinant factors in influenza A virus (IAV) virulence, which is key in the development of targets for therapeutic intervention that is host dependent and broad-spectrum. CD151 belongs to the super-family of 4-transmembrane glycoproteins called tetraspanins. Tetraspanins have been implicated to contribute to different phases of virus life cycle. However, no studies to date have examined whether CD151 plays a role in IAV infection and none have implicated a functional role for tetraspanins in host immune response against infection. Objectives: To determine the functional role and mechanism(s) of action of CD151 in IAV infection with H1N1 and H3N2 strains in vitro and in vivo. We used clinical donor samples of in vitro-differentiated human nasal epithelial cells (hNECs) cultured at air-liquid interface to determine the functional role of CD151 in IAV infection using biochemical and molecular methods. The role of CD151 in modulating lung pathology and innate immunity was assessed by comparing wild-type and CD151-null mice in an in vivo mouse model of IAV infection. Results: In the in vivo mouse model of IAV infection, compared with wild-type H1N1-infected mice, CD151-null mice showed significant reductions in virus titer accompanied by improved survival,which was associated with delayed but more pronounced host antiviral response. Interestingly, we also observed reduced nuclear export protein abundance and increased nuclear localization of viral proteins. In the in vitro-differentiated hNECs model, we further show that CD151 complexes newly synthesized viral proteins with host nuclear export proteins and stabilizes microtubule complexes;processes necessary for the polarized trafficking of viral progeny to the host plasma membrane for assembly.Conclusions:TargetingCD151 could reduce severity of influenza A virus infection by promoting host antiviral response and lung repair, and interrupting IAV infection at the level of nuclear export, a site not targeted by current therapy, which holds promise for the development of novel alternative/complementary strategies to reduce IAV severity.

There is an obvious demand for a model that can further bridge the gap between experimental data and pre-clinical/clinical trials in elucidating the differential responses at a population level towards specific agents. Objectives: To established an in vitro infection model that can capture the transcriptomic changes using smaller sample size that are comparable to clinical data Results: We have previously generated an in-vitro differentiated, air-liquid interface culture of human nasal epithelial cells (hNECs) derived from nasal epithelial stem cells of healthy donors that retained the fully functional multi-layer of the nasal epithelium, the primary target of respiratory viruses. We showed that these cells, retaining the genome of their donors, were capable of capturing the individuals' differential responses towards respiratory viruses like influenza A virus (IAV), rhinovirus (RV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Building onto this, we performed microarray analysis on hNECs model to ascertain the potential of these cells to elucidate population-based response against human IAV under a controlled and reproducible experimental conditions. Indeed, transcriptomic analysis of these hNECs from 5 donors infected 3 independent times were highly comparable towards clinical array data (13 independent influenza transcriptomic array datasets obtained from GEO database), including datasets with high sample sizes (eg Zhai et al., 2015 showed n=133 for microarray analyzed samples from n=1610 patients recruited in 2 years). The analyses of up-regulated genes captured from our model showed >80% identity showing that the hNECs model is capable of elucidating patient level data at a smaller scale when controlled for variables normally present in clinical data.Additionally, our model also allows for the analyses of down regulated genes in the nasal epithelium, which were not feasible in clinical data of blood samples. interfering ribonucleic acids targeted to interleukin-33 decrease airway hyperresponsiveness and lung inflammation in a mouse model of virus induced asthma exacerbationZaretskaia MA; Shilovskiy IP; Nikonova AA; Gaisina AR; Kamyshnikov OY; Khaitov MR; Smirnov VV National Research Center-Institute of Immunology, Moscow, Russia Introduction: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the main cause of bronchial asthma (BA) exacerbations.

Bulgaricus on the secretion of Th1/Th2/Treg type cytokines by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from children with AD. Objectives: L. Bulgaricus was cultivated on MRS broth. The PBMCs from 20 children with AD were separated by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation and co-cultured with different concentrations of UV killed bacteria in RPMI-1640 plus 10% FCS for 48/72 hours. The levels of IL-10, IL-4, IL-12 and IFN-c were measured in supernatant of PBMCs by ELISA. RNA extraction and real time RT-PCR were used to measure Foxp3 mRNA expression. Results: L. Bulgaricus significantly up-regulated the secretion of IL-10, IL-12 and IFN-c, whereas decreased the secretion of IL-4 by PBMCs compared to control (P<.05). The secretion level of IL-10 by L. Bulgaricus-stimulated PBMCs at incubation time 72 hours was significantly higher than 48 hours. The expression of Foxp3 mRNA was changed accordingly (P<.001 and P<.01, respectively). Conclusions: These data show that L. Bulgaricus may modulate the secretion of Th1-, Th2-and Treg-related cytokines in AD patients. Therefore, the possible potential therapeutic of L.

The growing burden of chronic diseases on existing healthcare systems had led to an increasing interest for the development of eHealth solutions. The University Medical Centre Utrecht (UMCU) in the Netherlands has developed and implemented an online patient portal for AD patients offering the possibility of follow-up through e-consultations, insightin the medical record, online monitoring and education and self-management training. In a previous study was shown that follow-up through e-consultations is likely to reduce costs while being just as effective as regular face-to-face care.Objectives: The aim of the present study was to investigate the use of the online patient portal in daily practice and to characterize portal users and non-users. A prospective cohort study was con-ducted including adult AD patients who visited the outpatient clinic of the dermatology department for the first time. At baseline, all patients were offered access to the online patient portal and were informed about its functionalities. The follow-up period included 12 months to determine whether patients used the portal by sending an e-consultation and/or request an e-repeat prescription. Data were obtained from medical health records and questionnaires to characterize portal users and non-users. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine predictors for the use of the patient portal. Results: Of the 148 included patients, 41 patients (28%) used the patient portal by sending an e-consultation and/or request an erepeat prescription. In multivariate analysis, significant predictors for portal use included higher scores on 'self-monitoring and insight' were found in demographics, disease severity and quality of life; also no differences were found in the number of faceto-face consultations during follow-up between portal users and non-users. Conclusions: Twenty-eight percent of AD patients actively used the online eczema portal with higher use associated with high educational level and higher scores on 'self-monitoring and insight'. Characterization of portal users might help to optimize the use of digital tools in the management of AD.

It is the most common fungal genus of the healthy human skin microbiome but it is also attributed a pathogenic role in skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD). AD is a frequent, recurrent eczematous skin disease that commonly associates with other atopic diseases such as hay fever, asthma and food allergies.To date, 14 immunogenic proteins of Malassezia spp. are characterized, that are predominantly produced by potentially pathogenic species, such as M. sympodialis. These proteins induce an IgE-or T cellmediated immune response in humans that may contribute to skin inflammation in AD. Little is known on the exact pathogenic mechanisms, and if Malassezia species change protein production in the altered environment of human atopic skin. Cultivation of Malassezia spp. is a desirable tool to investigate these disease-contributing mechanisms. However, Malassezia is a fastidious fungus that barely growths on standard agars, what hampers research. Objectives: We aimed to (i) examine the lipid preferences and (ii) to optimize culture conditions of Malassezia species. 28 strains isolated from human skin were used for the analysis. The strains represented five species with a supposed pathogenic role in skin diseases: M. sympodialis, M. restricta, M. globosa, M. slooffiae and M. furfur. Species identity was confirmed by sequencing. Strains were plated on various agar media (Leeming Notman, Sabouraud Dextrose, Tween 60-Esculin, Cremophor EL, mDixon) to determine their media preferences. To assess lipid preferences, commonly used culture media components (eg, tweens, olive oil, oleic acid) and human sebum components (eg squalene, cholesterol) were added in varying concentrations. Results: The mono-unsaturated lipid, oleic acid was the single most effective lipid to improve growth of all investigated Malassezia species. Other additives provided non-essential growth enhancement. Incubation time could be shortened to 2-4 days (vs 2-4 weeks) with only slight differences between species. Conclusions: We optimized cultivation of all relevant Malassezia species with reduced cultivation time on a single agar. This will enable (i) proteomic analyzes of Malassezia species under culture conditions resembling atopic skin, and (ii) the investigation of interaction between Malassezia spp. and human immune cells to elucidate the pathogenic contribution of Malassezia spp. to AD and other atopic diseases. 0437 | Emollient therapy alters barrier function and skin microbes in infants at risk for developing atopic dermatitis , Center for Cancer Research, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, United States; 2 Biometric Research Branch, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnostics, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, United States; 3 Department of Dermatology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, United States Introduction: Atopic dermatitis (AD) begins in early childhood and is characterized by impaired skin barrier and shifts in the skin microbiome.

The pathogenesis is not yet completely clarified, and no curative therapy exists. The elective therapeutic is to achieve and maintain skin improvement and itch control, basically through daily use of emollients and specific detergents for restoring of the barrier functions.Objectives: To restore the anomalous composition of polyunsaturated fatty acids, typical of the AD, we have conducted a preliminary blinded study on children with AD combined with daily use of emol-lient and detergent products (by SanaMedica Group) composed of Sacha Inchi Oil (polyunsaturated fatty acids: 98%, Omega3: 54%, Omega6: 33.4%, Omega9: 7.2%, Vitamin E with high lipophilicity 5.4%). The enlisted 18 children (average age 4-8 years: SCORAD index till 30, with annual relapses >4) were randomized and allocated in a blinded Group A (active molecule) or Group B (placebo). Each child was evaluated at when inserted (T0), after two months of the application of the products (T1) and after one month from the suspension of the treatments. At time T0 it was explained how to apply daily the products in adequate quantity and delivered a clinical diary to the overall clinical Assessment. Primary objective: For both groups the data related to SCORAD, itching/pruritus and insomnia/ sleep problems were evaluated. Analyzes of SCORAD variable demonstrated a significant improvement of the patients in Group A compared to patients in Group B at the times T1 (P=.0004) and T2 (0.002). At time T0 it was observed no significant difference of the SCORAD between the two Groups, evidence of the substantial homogeneity of the allocated patients in the two Groups. The itchiness improves significantly in Group A at time T2 (P=.004). The insomnia has a significant improvement in Group A at time T1(P=.01), with further increase at time T2 (P=.004). The data were analyzed using the one-way Student's T-Tests for unpaired groups with difference variance. Conclusions: The use of Oil Sacha Inchi has shown significant clinical effectiveness both in the short and long term.

Conventional treatment of moderate/ severe eczema may not be sufficient to control the activity of skin lesions, and a small subset of children require more aggressive systemic therapy which is not without side effects. Low-dose medicine (LDM) exerts pharmacomodulatory activity that can restore the homeostatic balance between the various lymphocyte populations, particularly in allergic and inflammatory diseases. The efficacy of low-dose medicine (LDM) in childhood mild/moderate eczema is not known. We conducted a double-blind, two-stage randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, lasting 23 months, to address this issue. Objectives: The purpose of our double-blind, two-stage randomized clinical trial was to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of long-term LDM treatment in children affected by mild/moderate chronic eczema. Eighty children with chronic mild/moderate eczema were randomly allocated to Group A (placebo) or Group B (treatment group; Galium-Heel \u00ae , Guna-Interleukin 12 and Guna-The decrease in disease severity was greater in Group B than in Group A already in stage 1 (a decrease of 64% vs 53.2%).

Therapies that have randomized control evidence are expensive, difficult to access, and have significant side effects. There remains a medication gap between evidence-based first line and second or third line agents. We sought to evaluate the efficacy, and adverse reactions of 5-ASA used as adjunctive therapy for patients with antihistamine refractory CSU.Results:A retrospective chart review was conducted of twenty-five adult patients with 5-ASA treated antihistamine refractory chronic spontaneous urticaria at the Adult Allergy and Clinical Immunology Clinic at the Winnipeg Health Sciences Centre from 2005 to 2016. Three patients were excluded from the final analysis. Consent was obtained via ethics approval granted by the University of Manitoba Research Ethics Board (H2016:076) and the Health Sciences Research Impact Committee (RI2016:026).Seventeen (81%) patients exhibited either a complete or partial response. Eleven (52.4%) attained complete remission; six (28.6%) patients had a partial response. Complete resolution was defined as resolution of urticaria, angioedema and pruritus; partial response was defined as decreased frequency of urticaria, angioedema and pruritus, or the ability to taper glucocorticoids at a dose of 5-ASA equal to or less than 1000 milligrams twice daily. Four (19%) patients failed, as defined by no improvement or discontinuation in favour of alternative therapy following a minimum of 4 weeks of 5-ASA. Five (23.8%) patients were able to entirely taper off of all medications following treatment with 5-ASA. Eleven of twelve (91.7%) of patients utilizing glucocorticoids prior to 5-ASA were able to successfully discontinue their use. Adverse events occurred in six (28.6%) patients, two (9.5%) required discontinuation; one for pancytopenia, the other for arthralgias.Conclusions: 5-ASA appears to be an efficacious, well tolerated, and safe adjunctive therapy for antihistamine refractory CSU. The rate of adverse events in this case series conflicts with data from the literature, where 5-ASA demonstrates a significantly lower incidence of adverse events. The sample size limits conclusions. We showed that extensively hydrolyzed casein formula containing the probiotic L. rhamnosus GG (EHCF+LGG) stimulates tolerance acquisition in children with cow milk allergy (CMA).Objectives: We aimed to investigate tolerogenic immune and nonimmune mechanisms elicited by LGG-derived CpG immunostimulatory DNA sequence (ODN ID35) and by the three most abundant bcasein-derived peptides contained in the formula. Immune mechanisms were investigated in PBMCs from children with challenge-proven IgE-mediated CMA (all Caucasian; mean age 2.4, range 1-5 years) stimulated with beta-lactoglobulin (b-LG; 100 lg/mL) in the presence or absence of ODN ID35 (1 lmol L \u00c01 ) for 24 h. Production and DNA methylation rate of interleukin (IL)-L4, IL-5, IL-10 and IFNc were assessed by ELISA and HRM Real Time PCR, respectively. Non-immune mechanisms were investigated in human enterocytes (Caco-2) stimulated with ODN ID35 (1 lmol L \u00c01 ) and with b-caseinderived peptides (b-CN) 60-69, b-CN 110-113, b-CN 193-209 (500 lg/mL). Cell growth was assessed by colorimetric assay (MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide); mucus production was analyzed by histochemistry after culture. Mucin 2 (MUC2) and tight junction proteins (zonulin and occludin) were analyzed by Real Time PCR using enterocytes RNA. Results: PBMCs stimulation with ODN ID35 resulted in a significant decrease in IL-4 and IL-5 production and in an increase of DNA methylation rate of the two cytokines. Instead, the stimulation with ODN ID35 increased IL-10 and IFN-c production but was unable to modulate DNA methylation rate of these cytokines. ODN ID35 stimulated mucus production and MUC2 expression in human enterocytes. The three b-casein-derived peptides regulated cell growth and MUC2; b-CN 193-209 alone was able to regulate zonulin and occludin expression. Conclusions: Through a direct interaction with human cells, LGG DNA and b-casein-derived peptides regulates immune and nonimmune mechanisms involved in tolerance acquisition. IG, CNG, Evry, France; 2 DBV Technologies, Paris, France; 3 Necker Hospital, Paris, France; 4 DBV Technologies, New York, United States Introduction: Epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT) is a safe treatment for food allergy. In animal models, EPIT protection seems to confer sustained unresponsiveness and prevents further sensitization. We have previously shown DNA methylation changes in key transcription factors to be associated with EPIT and sustained unresponsiveness. Objectives: This study investigates the kinetics of miRNA expression patterns underlying the therapeutic effect of EPIT and its persistence. BALB/c mice were orally sensitized to peanut and then treated with EPIT or not treated (sham). Mice (n=112) were sacrificed during treatment at 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks; and 8 weeks after the end of treatment. MiRNAs were analysed in sorted CD4 + cells from spleen using high-throughput sequencing on a HiSeq4000 to a depth of 200M bases / sample and validated by qPCR. Results: Global miRNA profiles consisting of 800-1000 miRNAs reproducibly detected in the CD4 samples distinguished EPIT-treated mice from controls as early as one week following initiation of treatment. Intra-group variability of miRNA expression profiles was much reduced in the EPIT group at all time points. Between 23 and 190MiRNAs were found to be differentially expressed at p adj <.05 with a large overlap of miRNAs between adjacent time points. Differentially expressed miRNAs include miRNAs controlling T cell stability and plasticity (eg, Tregs, miR-10a) and Th2 cytokine production (eg, miR-92a-3p and miR-423-5p). 34 miRNAs were differentially expressed eight weeks after the end of the treatment, of which 24 (70%)showed similar expression changes at the end of treatment.Conclusions: EPIT leads to homogeneous changes in miRNA expression profiles shortly after the initiation of treatment differentiating EPIT-treated mice from sham-treated control mice and expression changes are maintained following the termination of treatment.Differentially expressed miRNAs include miRNAs in T cell plasticity and postulated targets include genes previously associated with allergy and asthma.

Objectives: To investigate patients' experienced treatment effect in a real-life cohort of omalizumab treated patients. Methods: We interviewed 26 consecutive patients (male: 10, female: 16) treated with omalizumab in our outpatient clinic for either severe allergic asthma (n=8), chronic spontaneous urticaria (n=12), severe allergy (n=3), anaphylaxis (n=2) or nasal polyposis (n=1), focusing on their subjective experience regarding changes in symptoms and quality of life from before starting omalizumab treatment and after a minimum of 4 months of treatment. We used a 5point visual analogue scale from 0 to 4 points (0: very severely impaired; 1: severely impaired, 2: moderately impaired; 3: slightly impaired; 4: not impaired) to ask patients for the impact of symptoms and the impact of their disease on quality of life. Patients reported an improvement of their quality of life by a median of 3 points (IQR 2; 3), again, patients treated for urticaria reported a greater improvement of their quality of life (Median 3, IQR 3; 3.5) than patients treated for other conditions (Median 3, 2; 3, P=.13).

We sought to determine if omalizumab administration in refractory to H1 antihistamines chronic urticaria (CU) patients prevents respiratory illnesses, independently of their atopic status. Objectives: In this longitudinal cohort study, all respiratory illnesses from all CU patients under regular omalizumab administration (300 mg Q4-weeks) from at least November 2015 until October 2016 were prospectively recorded. Patients with history of known respiratory conditions, like asthma, allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinitis/ rhinosinusitis, or any type of immunodeficiency were excluded. All patients were followed up every 4 weeks at each omalizumab administration. The closest in age, healthy household member (spouse, partner, relative, roommate etc), when available, was used as a control individual. Results: Thirty three patients (21 women) 45.1AE16.6 years old and 30 age-matched control subjects (9 women, 46.6AE9.6 years old) were enrolled. The CU-patients reported significantly less respiratory illnesses as compared with the control subjects (median: 0 vs 1, inter-quartile range 0-1 vs 1-1, min-max: 0-3 vs 0-4, respectively, P-value=.0095). The vaccination rate for influenza viruses was similar between patients and controls. Conclusions: Omalizumab administration prevents common respiratory illnesses in CU patients even in the absence of any respiratory disorder or allergic sensitization. This finding suggests indirectly a role of IgE in the clinical expression of a respiratory infection independently of the patient's atopic status and implies the potential prophylactic role anti-IgE may have in this direction.

UCC cultures were researched at early (before 10) and later (over 30) passages. Preparations were analyzed with consideration for international classification of chromosomes (Ch). As a clone, 2-3 cells with identical damages were reviewed, and in case of monosomy (absence of the same Ch), there must be not less than 3 of these cells. Number of analyzed cells depended on the quantity of identified clones and lied within the range from 20 to 100. CTA expression was evaluated by flow cytometry method. Mathematical processing was performed with the use of SPSS 23.0 Results: It was established, that all researched tumor cultures had cytogenetic changes peculiar to BC. Mostly, the following changes were identified: deletion of 9 Ch (66.7%), absence of Y Ch (50%) and monosomy of 13 Ch (33.3%). In rare cases changes in 1, 3, 7 Ch, monosomy of 17 Ch, trisomy of 7 Ch were detected. Comparative studies showed that in case of prolonged passaging in a part of cultures, significant increase of the number of genetic changes in a form of division of previously homogeneous population into subclones differing in ploidy (up to 56 Ch) and quantity of changed Ch is observed. After comparison of the results with data, obtained by flow cytometry method, certain correlation of these changes to decrease of CTA expression (GAGE, BAGE, MAGE \u0438 NY-ESO-1) (P<.05) was established. Particular cultures in the course of multiple transits preserved cytogenetic profile and consistent CTA expression, which makes them promising for preparation of antitumor vaccines in case of BC. Conclusions: In case of creation of PDAV against BC, it is necessary to use autologous tumor cells at early passages of their cultivation, or allogenic cell cultures, marked by cytogenetic consistency and stable expression of tumor-associated antigens. 0474 | M1 and M2 macrophage gene methylation profiles in patients with kawasaki disease Guo MM; Hsieh K; Lo M; Huang Y; Chang L; Kuo H Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF166": {"text": "b2 adrenergic receptor (ADRb2).

Purification of one major allergenic protein of crude extract was undertaken by subjecting it to salt precipitation, anion exchange column chromatography and fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC).Results: In immunoblots, 12 IgE binding proteins were detected, four being major allergens of A fumigatus-90, 83, 34, 20.2 kd. The 20.2 kd component detected with maximum number of positive patients' sera was purified to apparent homogeneity. The precipitate recovered on 80% ammonium sulfate precipitation of crude extract was subjected to anion exchange chromatography (DEAE-Sephacel) which yielded three fractions. The 20.2 kd component was detected in Afu-Fr1 with standard methods. Further, Afu-Fr1 was subjected to FPLC using a pre-packed mono-Q column. The eluates were pooled into five fractions. The 20.2 kd band was observed in Afu-F1a. Rechromatography of Afu-Fr1a again resulted in a single peak. At each step, allergenic activity was evaluated by EAST inhibition and immunoblots. For quantification of the purified allergen in crude extract, EAST inhibition assays with the sera pool of A fumigatus allergic patients were standardized. A dose-related inhibition was obtained in Afu-Fr1a EAST with Afu-Fr1a (purified protein) as well as the crude extract. Dose of purified protein and the crude extract required for 50% inhibition worked out to be 23.7 and 1599 ng, respectively. Thus, the concentration of purified protein (20.2 kd) in crude lyophilized A fumigatus extract worked out to be 14.8 lg/mg.Conclusions: Thus, the 20.2 kd major allergen of A fumigatus has been purified to apparent homogeneity. The inhibition assays to quantify this purified allergen in crude extracts have been standardized. To ensure appropriate biopotency of crude A fumigatus extract, 20.2 kd protein may be used as a reference reagent for quality control.0540 | Comparison of cat and dog allergen concentrations on electrostatic dust collectors in offices and homesSander I 1 ; Sauke-Gensow U 2 ; Czibor C 1 ; Zahradnik E 1 ; Flagge A 1 ; F\u20ac orster M 2 ; Husert D 2 ; Dreyer J 2 ; Fritsch N 2 ; Schmidt W 2 ; Petersen J 2 ; Br\u20ac uning T 1 ; Raulf M 1 Institut f\u20ac ur Pr\u20ac avention und Arbeitsmedizin der DGUV, Institut der Ruhr-Universit\u20ac at Bochum, IPA, Bochum, Germany;Introduction: Pet allergens are not exclusively present in pet owners' homes but are transferred to workplaces and dwellings without pets.Objectives: Aim of the study was to compare pet allergen concentrations in airborne settled dust from offices and office workers' homes.Methods:Electrostatic dust collectors (EDCs) which are developed for passive sampling of airborne particles and are useful in large population studies were placed for 14 days four times a year in five office buildings in Hamburg and Berlin (67 rooms, 436 EDCs), and in parallel in the office workers' homes (145 rooms, 404 EDCs). The samples were extracted and analysed with fluorescence enzymeimmunoassays based on monoclonal antibodies (Indoor Biotechnologies, Charlottesville, US) to Fel d 1 (major cat allergen) and Can f 1 (major dog allergen). Pet allergen thresholds that discriminate samples from homes with cat or dog from the ones without these pets were calculated using receiver-operator characteristics and Youden indices. Samples were grouped according to presence of pets in homes and presence of pet owners in offices and compared by Kruskal-Wallis test.Results: In homes with cats or dogs, 99% or 100% of samples con-tained Fel d 1 (median 1270 ng/m\u00b2) or Can f 1 (median 842 ng/m\u00b2), respectively. In homes without cats 33% of samples had Fel d 1 (max. 175 ng/m\u00b2), and in homes without dogs only 23% were positive for Can f 1 (max. 287 ng/m\u00b2). In offices with cat owners, 71% of samples were positive for Fel d 1 (median 16.5, max. 561 ng/m\u00b2). In offices with dog owners, 43% of samples were positive for Can f 1 (max. 167 ng/m\u00b2). In offices without cat owners, 21% of samples were positive for Fel d 1 (max. 97 ng/m\u00b2), and in offices without dog owners, 12% contained Can f 1 (max. 55 ng/m\u00b2). The threshold level for presence of dogs in homes was 100 ng/m\u00b2 Can f 1 (100% sensitivity, 99.2% specificity) and for presence of cats in homes was 59 ng/m\u00b2 Fel d 1 (96.1% sensitivity, 98.8% specificity). In offices only 3 out of 436 EDCs samples had Can f 1 loads above 100 ng/ m\u00b2, but 33 samples had Fel d 1 loads above 59 ng/m\u00b2.Conclusions:Cat and dog allergens seem to be transferred from pet owners to their offices. Offices with pet owners had significantly higher allergen concentrations than homes without the respective pet or offices without pet owners. However, exposure to dog and cat allergens in offices rarely reached levels of households with pets.0541 | Comparison of quality of life and local inflammatory/atopy markers in smoking vs non smoking patients with allergic rhinitisGomez RM 1 ; Mui\u00f1o JC 2 ; Zernotti ME 3 ; Croce VH 4 Fundaci on Ayre, Salta, Argentina; 2 Faculty of Medicine UNC, C ordoba, Argentina; 3 Faculty of Medicine UCC, C ordoba, Argentina; 4 Instituto Modelo Cardiolog \u0131a, C ordoba, Argentina Introduction: Exposure to tobacco smoke was reported to provoke increased parameters of Atopy and Allergic Rhinitis (AR) symptoms; on the other hand, non significant differences in nasal symptoms and quality of life (QoL) was described as well in AR patients who smoke. Objectives: Given this duality, we aimed to evaluate QoL and local IgE, IL17 and IL33 levels as representative parameters among active smokers (Smk) and nonsmokers (NonSmk) having AR. and Methods: Cross-sectional study in adult volunteers comparing Smk and NonSmk AR patients. Status of smoking was confirmed by salivary cotinine measurements. QoL was compared using Mini-RQLQ questionnaire. IgE, IL33 and IL 17 were measured in nasal lavage by ELISA. Statistical analysis included T test and Mann Whitney U (Anova 2way). Values of P<.05 were considered significant.Results: Twenty two patients per group, mean age 37.3 years (Smk) and 30.4 (NonSmk) were studied, with no significant differ-ence in age, sex or allergen sensitization. Statistically significant differences in salivary cotinine levels (P<.0001) were found. Local IgE obtained in Smk: 3.41 kU/L (AE6.20 SD) and in NonSmk: 4.68 kU/L (AE7.34 SD); IL 17 in Smk: 16.46 pg/ml (AE24.18) and in NonSmk: 24.65 pg/ml (AE71.49); and IL33 in Smk: 57.50 pg/ml (AE99.47) and in NonSmk: 144.55 pg/ml (AE169.62). MiniRQLQ QoL mean scores were in Smk: 3.39 AE1.01 and in NonSmk: 3.70 AE0.74. P values for all comparisons were non-significant. Conclusions: Active smokers AR patients do not show a worsening in both their QoL and local atopic inflammatory parameters, compared to non-smokers. Even not resulting statistically significant, there is a clear trend of reduced IL33 levels on smokers. 0542 | Anti-allergic effect of intranasal vitamin D treatment by inhibiting dendritic cell activation in the allergic rhinitis mouse model Cho S; Zhang Y; Rhee C; Kim D Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF10": {"text": "Th2 mediated inflammation. 0543 | Appropriate treatment can reduce vitamin D deficiency in children with vernal keratoconjunctivitis Bruschi G 1 ; Ghiglioni DG 2 ; Benatti E 1 ; Osnaghi SG 2 ; Marchisio PG 1 Universit a degli Studi di Milano Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy; 2 Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, ItalyIntroduction: Children with Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) show symptoms like other ocular allergopathy, but amplified: photophobia, itching eyes, mucoid secretion, conjuntival hyperemia, frequently with watering eyes, foreign body sensation, palpebral pseudoptosis and pain.

Before the summer period, the average vitamin level was 23.97 AE 13.82 ng/ml (2 ds) in the first group, and 23.56 AE 10.42 ng/ml (2 ds) in the second group. At the end of summer period, instead, the average levels were, respectively, 33.47 AE 17.89 ng/ml and 35.42 AE 20.55 ng/ml. While, in spring, 44.06% of cyclosporine-treated children revealed a mild vitamin D deficiency, and 33.9% severe deficiency (< a 20 ng/ml), at the end of the summer season these percentages decreased to, respectively, 35.6% and 5.08%. In the second group, vitamin D levels evolved as follows: before summer, 54.4% of children revealed mild deficiency and 27.2% severe deficiency. After summer, mild and severe deficiency rates were 27.3% and 0%.Conclusions: Both cyclosporine and tacrolimus treatments appear to allow a solar exposition sufficient to increase vitamin D levels in blood in children with VKC. If the VKC is controlled with the pharmacologic therapy, solar exposure allows to correct the lack of vitamin D.ASTHMA IMMUNOPATHOLOGY/INFLAMMATION/MECHANISM0544 | The significance of selected smad proteins in the mediation of inflammation in asthma in response to a specific and non-specific triggers Introduction: Asthma is a chronic disease of the respiratory tract, in which various cytokines, including TGF-\u00df, are responsible for inflammation and remodeling.

So far, five allergens were identified, among those, Jug r 2 belonging to the vicilin family. Based on the identification of an IgEreactive clone from a cDNA library in 1999 (Teuber et al.), the sequence fragment of Jug r 2 was determined. However, only limited data is known about the natural form of the protein. Therefore, this study aimed to purify and characterize the natural Jug r 2.Objectives: Walnuts were ground and defatted twice (1:5 w/v) by n-hexane. Proteins were extracted from walnut flour by 7 volumes of buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl, 0.5 M NaCl, 5% PVPP, 10 mM DTT, pH=8) for 4 hours at 4\u00b0C. Subsequently, purification was performed starting with ConA affinity followed by anion exchange and size exclusion. The entire mass of purified protein was identified by MALDI-TOF and ESI-QTOF mass spectrometry. Optimized multienzymatic digestion was applied for extensive protein characterization including post-translational modifications analysis and de novo sequencing. IgE binding activity of vicilin was tested in ELISA and Western Blot using sera from 70 walnut allergic patients. Level of cross-reactivity between detected allergen and selected homologues was assessed by inhibition ELISA.Results: The purified vicilin migrates in SDS-PAGE as a single band at around 50 kDa. MALDI-TOF and electrospray mass spectrometry provided 47 kDa, which is in disagreement with the previously identified Jug r 2 with a mass of 48.4 kDa (No.: Q9SEW4). LC-MS/MS data searched against recently published walnut transcriptome resulting in 89% of sequence coverage at 1%FDR peptide of a yet unknown protein. This novel protein contains two cupin domains and displays high sequence identity to other vicilins such as from hazelnut, Cor a 11 (72%), sesame, Ses i 3 (60%) and pistachio, Pis v 3 (54%). In contrast, sequence identity to Jug r 2 was only 44%. The immunological characterization of this novel vicilin confirmed its IgE binding activity and a high level of cross-reactivity with hazelnut, pistachio and sesame.Conclusions: In contrast to the previous Jug r 2 encoding sequence, obtained by cDNA cloning we report the characterization of another vicilin, purified from walnuts. The obtained sequence displays both, higher sequence identity to vicilins from related species and IgE cross reactivity as compared to Jug r 2. Therefore, it may represent an abundant and relevant vicilin-like allergen in walnuts that should be included in the allergen specific diagnosis.0559 | FABER IgE diagnostic test: the most comprehensive view on IgE sensitization to milks and meats Alessandri C 1 ; Tuppo L 2 ; Zennaro D 1 ; Rafaiani C 1 ; Ciancamerla M 1 ; Giangrieco I 2 ; Ferrara R 1 ; Bernardi ML 1 ; Tamburrini M 2 ; Ciardiello MA 2 ; Mari A 1 CAAM -Centri Associati di Allergologia Molecolare, Rome, Italy; Istituto di Bioscienze e Biorisorse-IBBR-CNR, Naples, Italy Introduction: Cow's milk (CM) allergy is the most common food allergy in infancy. The overall allergic reactions to CM as well as the specific sensitization pattern to each CM protein are variable from patient to patient. Specific IgE detection can help to determine whether all foods containing milk should be eliminated from the patient's diet or some milks, sharing proteins homologues but not identical to CM, might be used for feeding. Objectives: To investigate the milk and meat IgE sensitization profiles in a population of 1751 allergic patients by means of FABER, a new nanobead-based IVD test for specific IgE detection using 122 molecular allergens and 122 allergenic extracts, all coupled to chemically activated nano-particles. Results: The tested allergenic preparations, all spotted on the FABER chip, were 7 milk extracts from different species used in humans, 4 CM proteins, 4 meat extracts, 3 meat proteins and 5 serum albumins shared between milk and meat. Out of the 1751 patients 105 (5.99%), the majority of them in the first decade of life, turned out to be sensitized to at least one of the 11 Faber allergenic preparations available for routine testing. The sensitization prevalence was as follows: for milk extracts cow 73%, buffalo 70%, sheep 69%, jenny 69%, goat 67%, mare 47%, camel 43%, whilst for CM proteins Bos d 4 41%, Bos d 5 20%, Bos d 8 35%, Bos d Lactoferrin 52%. 75 patients are sensitized to at least one of the 7 Faber allergenic preparations made by meat extracts and proteins. The sensitization prevalence was: for meat extracts lamb 68%, cow 59%, rabbit 31%, pork 29%, whilst for meat proteins Bos d CA 35%, Bos d Gelatin 9%, Equ c Myoglobin 1%. Serum albumin sensitization prevalence appears very similar between milk and meat sensitized groups, having Bos d 6 the highest IgE binding prevalence and Equ c 3 the least one.Conclusions: The study results confirm differences in sensitization towards the tested milk and meat allergenic sources. Filtering the sensitization results with the patient's history and oral food challenges, when needed, could improve the allergic patient's diet. For the first time FABER allows to simultaneously test the patients to a broad panel of animal milk, meat extracts and CM proteins, providing at the same time data on sensitizations to the largest number of other inhalant, food, latex, animal and insect allergens, thus providing data for alternative feeding.0560 | Eosinophil cationic protein and eosinophil derived neurotoxin levels in children with food allergy Sentsova T; Muhortnyh V; Vorozhko I; Chernyak O Federal Research Centre of Nutrition and Biotechnology, Moscow, Russia Introduction: eosinophilic inflammation is one of the key mechanisms for the development of food allergy in children. Serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and eosinophil derived neurotoxin (EDN) in feces are markers of eosinophil degranulation. Aim: To study the levels of serum ECP and fecal EDN in children with different clinical manifestations of food allergy. months old. Isolated gastrointestinal manifestations of food allergy were found in 24 children, isolated skin manifestations -28 children, mixed manifestations in 30 children. The control group consisted of 32 healthy children of the same age. The contents of serum ECP and fecal EDN were measured by immunochemiluminescence and immunoassay methods respectively.Results: All children with food allergy showed an increase serum ECP compared control group. In the group with isolated gastrointestinal symptoms-61.2 AE 9.2 ng/mL vs 7.5 AE 1.7 ng/mL (P<.05), isolated skin manifestations 101.0 AE 11.1 ng/mL vs 7.5 AE 1.7 ng/mL (P<.05), in the group with mixed manifestations of 83.6 AE 7.4 ng/mL vs 7.5 AE 1.7 ng/mL (P<.05). Statistically significant differences in fecal EDN levels in children with food allergy and control group were not found.Conclusions:The most informative marker of eosinophilic inflammation in children with food allergy is the level of eosinophil cationic protein in serum. The maximum value of this eosinophil degranulation marker were obtained in children with isolated skin manifestations of food allergy.0561 | Is mealworm food allergy indicative for food allergy to other insects?Broekman HC 1 ; Knulst AC 1 ; Gaspari M 2 ; Den Hartog Jager CF 1 ; De Jong G 3 ; Houben GF 3 ; Verhoeckx KC 3 UMCU, Utrecht, The Netherlands; 2 Magna Graecia University of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy; 3 TNO, Zeist, The Netherlands Introduction: The growing world population motivates the exploration of new and more sustainable protein sources to ensure food security. Mealworm and other insects are promising candidates, with active ongoing marketing efforts within America and Europe. In previous studies we found that patients allergic to shrimp are at risk for mealworm allergy, and mealworm can also induce a primary allergy.Objectives: Investigate the allergic potential of other edible insect candidates, suggested for human consumption by WHO/FAO and EFSA, in both the mealworm and shrimp allergic population. The following insects were investigated: Tenebrio molitor; mealworm (larvae), Acheta domesticus; house cricket (bug), Zophobas morio; superworm (larvae), Alphitobius diaperinus; lesser mealworm (larvae), Locusta migratoria; African grasshopper (bug), Galleria mellonella; large waxmoth (larvae) and Hermetia illucens; black soldier fly (larvae).Results: Fifteen shrimp allergic patients and four primary mealworm allergic subjects from our previous studies were included. In 13/15 of the shrimp allergic patients and in 2/4 of the mealworm allergic patients food allergy to mealworm was confirmed by double blind placebo controlled challenge. All shrimp allergic patients were sensitized to multiple insects, on immunoblot. The``activation test (BAT) showed reaction with similar responses within each individual patient to the different species. Primary mealworm allergic patients reacted with serum binding to some insects on immunoblot, in contrary to the shrimp allergic patients. Positive basophil activation to all insects was seen.Conclusions: All shrimp allergic patients showed sensitization, to all tested edible insects, with protein recognition similar to their mealworm sensitization. Food allergy to other insects due to crossreactivity seems very likely, but a challenge should be performed to confirm this clinically.The primary mealworm allergic subjects showed sensitization to known and unknown arthropod allergens, different from the shrimp allergic patients, but only show clinical reaction to mealworm. 0562 | Fx5: Is it really worth asking for?Alves C 1 ; Romeira AM 1 ; Matos V 2 ; Leiria Pinto P 1 Immunoallergology Department, Hospital D.

Four proteins were purified from pomegranate juice, namely chitinase, punein (homologous to Bra r 2), pommaclein (homologous to Pru p 7) and the 9k-LTP Pun g 1. All the 4 isolated proteins displayed positive signals in IgE dot blotting and immunoblotting. Specific IgE towards chitinase, pommaclein and Pun g 1 were recorded in 5 (0.31%), 6 (0.37%) and 44 (2.74%) patients out of 1606, using the FABER nanotech test. In addition, 20 patients (1.25%) were positive to the seed extract.Conclusions: Three new IgE binding proteins were identified in pomegranate juice. It was observed that seed proteins provide a significant contribution to the pomegranate allergenicity, whereas the mesocarp could represent a rich and safe source of nutraceuticals also for allergic subjects.0564 | Eosinophilic esophagitis: diagnostic work-up and follow-up -a single center experienceBenito-Garcia F 1 ; Mota I 1 ; Piedade S 1 ; Gaspar\u00c2 1 ; Morgado S 2 ; Pires S 2 ; Ratilal P 2 ; Gorj\u00e3o R 2 ; Santos F 3 ; Morais-Almeida M 1 Immunoallergy Department, CUF Descobertas Hospital, Lisboa, Portugal; 2 Gastroenterology Unit, CUF Descobertas Hospital, Lisboa, Portugal; 3 Pediatrics Department, CUF Descobertas Hospital, Lisboa, Portugal Introduction: Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) an inflammatory immune-mediated condition with an increasing incidence in both pediatric and adult patients, represents a challenge in clinical practice.

In the current study we assessed the potential of MCT to serve as an adjuvant in the development of an infectious disease vaccine (malaria). As a consequence, the study reinforced the adjuvant properties of MCT that make this an attractive biodegradable adjuvant to enhance the immunogenicity of antigen targets. Objectives: Circumsporozoite protein (CSP) of Plasmodium (P.) vivax was formulated within MCT and the induced immune responses compared to CSP formulated in PBS or Alum. Four mice per group, agematched 6 week-old females inbred C57BL/6 strain were vaccinated intramuscularly with 50 lL dose of each vaccine. The humoral immune response was analysed by ELISA for IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3. Results: MCT and Alum strongly increased immunogenicity of CSP compared to PBS in both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. Challenge studies in mice using a chimeric P. berghei expressing CSP of P. vivax demonstrated clinically improved symptoms of malaria with CSP formulated in both MCT and Alum; protection was, however, more pronounced if CSP was formulated in MCT.Conclusions: MCT is one of the very few depot adjuvants formulated in licensed vaccines for use in humans with a recognised safety profile.

Little is known about food allergy (FA).Objectives: To investigate the prevalence of FA and its disparity between urban and rural areas in south China.Results: Europrevall questionnaires were harvested from 5542 school-age children in urban Guangzhou (response rate 94.3%) and 5319 in rural Shaoguan (RR 91.8%). Case-control study enrolled 189 children with food allergy as cases, and 213 controls in Guangzhou, 124 cases and 225 controls in Shaoguan. They undergo skin prick test (SPT) to 18 food-and 5 environmental allergens and serum IgE measurements against 27 food-and 7 environmental allergens. Allergen extracts from shrimp, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Blattella germanica were prepared and IgE cross-relativities were compared in 23 Guangzhou and 20 Shaoguan shrimp-sensitized subjects. Shrimp allergy is the most dominant in urban (4.5%) and rural (3.7%) subjects in case-control study. The percent of adverse reaction to shrimp in Guangzhou is higher than Shaoguan (3.5% vs 1.4%, P<.001), however, SPT and IgE to shrimp [SPT: 3.7% vs 11.2%, P=.015; IgE: 12.6% vs 36.2%, P<.001] and cockroach [SPT: 5.3% vs 33.5%; IgE: 2.6% vs 27.6%, P<.001] is lower in Guangzhou. There was a significant linear correlation among IgE to shrimp and housedust-mite/cockroach in Shaoguan. The proportions of positive IgE to tropomyosin (Pen a 1, Der p 10) are lower than 7.4% in both areas.For inhibition test, cockroach has a significant higher inhibition rate of binding to IgE to house-dust-mite allergies in Shaoguan sera.Conclusions: Shrimp is the common allergic food in south China.Cockroach sensitization could explain the higher proportion of shrimp sensitization in rural subjects.

Objectives: We aimed to evaluate gut microbiota composition and butyrate production in children with non-IgE-mediated CMA and in HC.We evaluated 20 HC, and 46 non-IgE-mediated CMA children:patients with recent evidence of non-IgE-mediated CMA at diagnosis; patients with diagnosis of non-IgE-mediated CMA treated with extensively hydrolysed casein formula EHCF; patients with diagnosis of non-IgE-mediated CMA treated with EHCF+Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG);patients with a previous diagnosis of non IgE-mediated CMA, but with evidence of oral tolerance acquisition, treated with EHCF+LGG. Microbiota composition was studied by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing(V3-V4 region)on Illumina MiSeq platform. Fecal butyrate concentration was evaluated by gas chromatography interfaced to a mass spectrometer. Results: Non-IgE-mediated CMA subjects exhibited significant changes in gut microbiota composition if compared with HC, while microbial diversity was not affected by the health status. Hierarchical clustering based on fecal microbiota composition highlighted a separation of CMA subjects, while treated (EHCF and EHCF+LGG) clustered together with HC. Only Bacteroidetes was significantly increased in CMA. Genus-level analysis revealed that Streptococcus was decreased, while Bacteroides, Alistipes and Haemophilus were increased in CMA compared to HC (P<.05). Their abundance decreased following both the treatments (P<.05), in fact EHCF+LGG ABSTRACTS | 317 treated children showed a lower level of Bacteroides compared to EHCF(P<.05). On the contrary, higher abundance of Lactobacillus was found in EHCF+LGG (P<.05). Health status (HC vs CMA subjects) was the largest contributor to Bacteroides differential abundance suggesting that CMA was the most important variable explaining the levels of Bacteroides in gut microbiota. The treatment with EHCF+LGG appeared to restore the Bacteroides sub-genus pattern, bringing such diversity much similar to that shown by the HC. Fecal concentration of butyrate was significantly higher in non-IgEmediated CMA infants treated with EHCF+LGG when compared with those treated with EHCF alone. Conclusions: Non-IgE-mediated CMA is associated to gut microbiota dysbiosis. Sub-genus Bacteroides diversity differentiates HC and CMA infants and it is restored in EHCF+LGG treated subjects. This dietary strategy is also able to increase butyrate production. 0451 | Non-digestible oligosaccharides can influence IgE-mediated basophil degranulation in whole blood of peanut allergic patients Hayen SM 1 ; Den Hartog Jager CF 1 ; Knulst AC 1 ; Knol EF 1 ; Garssen J 2 ; Willemsen LE 2 ; Otten HG 1 UMC Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands; 2 Universiteit Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF106": {"text": "0452 | Combined exposure of intestinal epithelial cells to the dietary oligosaccharide mixture ScFOS/LcFOS and CpG DNA enhances the Th1 and regulatory IL-10 response in an allergen-specific co-culture model Hayen SM 1 ; Overbeek SA 2 ; Knulst AC 1 ; Garssen J 3 ; Otten HG 1 ; Willemsen LE 3 UMC Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands; 2 Nutricia Research, Utrecht, The Netherlands; 3 University Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF107": {"text": "Thus scFOS/lcFOS may be an interesting candidate in dietary adjunct therapy for allergen-specific immunotherapy. 0453 | Severe pollen-mediated food reactions correlate with oral mucosa integrity and effector cell sensitivity Rosace D 1 ; Escribese MM 1 ; Belver MT 2 ; Ramos T 2 ; M ugica V 2 ; Dominguez MD 3 ; Vega A 3 ; Marco G 4 ; De Pedro M 4 ; Sanchez L 4 ; Arnas MD 5 ; Santaolalla M 5 ; Fernandez-Rivas MM 4 ; Alvarado MI 3 ; Blanco C 2 ; Barber D 1 Institute of Applied Molecular Medicine (IMMA), San Pablo CEU University, Madrid, Spain; 2 La Princesa University Hospital, Madrid, Spain; 3 Virgen del Puerto Public Hospital, Plasencia, Spain; 4 San Carlos Clinical Hospital, Madrid, Spain; 5 HM Sanchinarro Hospital, Madrid, Spain", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF108": {"text": "Graversen KB 1 ; Hornslet SE 1 ; Smit JJ 2 ; Jensen LH 1 ; Christoffersen HF 3 ; Jacobsen LN 4 ; B\u00f8gh KL 1 National Food Institute, Technical University of Denmark, S\u00f8borg, Denmark; 2 Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands; 3 Arla Food Ingredients, Videbaek, Denmark; Arla Food Ingredients, Viby J, Denmark", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF109": {"text": "esophageal tissue of patients with eosinophilic esophagitis in comparison to patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease and control group Mousavinasab F 1 ; Mesdaghi M 2 ; Babaie D 2 ; Nilipour Y 3 ; Kazemi Aghdam M 3 ; Khoddami M 3 ; Imanzadeh F 4 ; Rohani P 4 ; Dara N 4 ; Khatami K 5 ; Sayyari A 5 Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Science, Tehran, Iran; Department of Allergy and Immunology, Mofid children's hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Science, Tehran, Iran; 3 Pediatric Pathology Research Center, Mofid children's hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Science, Tehran, Iran; 4 Department of Pediatric Gastroentrology and Hepatology, Mofid children's hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Science, Tehran, Iran; 5 Department of Pediatric Gastroentrology and Hepatology, Mofid children's hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Science, Tehran, IranIntroduction: Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE), is a primarily polygenic allergic disorder, involving mechanisms that fall between pure IgE-mediated and delayed Th2 responses.

One patient with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU),and under omalizumab treatment for 10 months developed hyperamylasemia, and autoimmune pancreatitis, and later she was diagnosed to have IgG4 related disease. Based on this patient, we aimed to analyse if serum amylase levels of patients who are under omalizumab treatment were high. Objectives: A total of 78 patients under omalizumab treatment for severe asthma and CSU were evaluated for serum amylase levels, and if high those patients were further evaluated for possible etiology Results: MeanAEstandard deviation age of the patients were 44.0AE1.5 and 54 (69.2%) were female. Of the 78 patients 61 had CSU and 17 had asthma. The meanAEstandard deviation duration of omalizumab treatment was 20.6AE1.7 months. Mean cumulative omalizumab dose was 5542AE580 mg. In 19 patients there was at least one measurement of high amylase level. Of these 19; 13 patients showed a transient hyperamylasemia and their subsequent measurements were within normal levels, remaining 6 patients' serum amylase levels were persistently high. The index case had both high pancreatic and serum amylase levels, and she later was diagnosed as IgG4 related disease. Remaining five patients with persistently high amylase levels were evaluated for gastroenterologic diseases. All six patients had normal abdominal computed tomography scans. To investigate if these five patients had macroamylasemia, amylase/creatine clearance ratios were calculated and in all five patients found to be less than lower limit of normal. Patients with transient hyperamylasemia were compared to patients with normal amylase levels, and it was shown not to be associated with age, cumulative dosage, body mass index, duration of treatment, and duration of disease.Patients with persistent high amylase levels were older, compared to the ones with normal amylase levels (P=.015).Conclusions: Not having pretreatment serum amylase levels, and a control group are limitations of the study. However, high serum amylase level detected in six cases on omalizumab of treatment is remarkable. The drug may conjugate with serum amylase to form macroamylase, this may be the explanation of probable macroamylasemia in remaining five patients. This is the first study that investigates suspicious association between omalizumab treatment and hyperamylasemia. Further prospective studies are needed to elucidate the problem.0462 | Omalizumab, lights and shadows of our experienceLopez Couso V; Gonzalez Lopez P; Rodriguez Cabreros MI; Torres Perez B; Barrios Albajar M; Rodr \u0131guez Mosquera M; Iglesias Cadarso A Hospital Univesitario Puerta de Hierro, Madrid, Spain Introduction: Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that is prescribed in a stepwise addition regimen for severe asthma treatment and others disease in which you find an overexpression of immunoglobulin E, in response to external factors that in a normal situation shouldn't produce an immunological response. Since it release its trigger was severe asthma but practitioners expand it uses to other allergic diseases offering great results. Omalizumab has demonstrated in asthma and chronic urticaria to: Decrease recruitment of eosinophils and basophils; Decrease use of corticosteroids; Decrease exacerbations; Decrease number of hospitalizations; Increase of quality of life. Objectives: Our objective its to show our experience with Omalizumab since 2011. Results: We have 127 patients using Omalizumab 71 of them are actively treated and 56 have already finished.Severe asthma: We have 39 patients that are actively receiving treatment. 38% dosage of 150 mg/4 weeks, 25% 300 mg/4 weeks; 12% 300 mg/2 weeks; having a good quality of life. 25% active patients started in 2011, 41% active patients were included between 2015-16. Patients who have finished the treatment 46% are free of symptoms, 11% didn't answer to the treatment, 23% left the treatment and one died. Chronic Urticaria: We have 27 patients that are actively receiving Omalizumab. 48% of the patients are using a dosage of 300 mg each 4 weeks. 37% dosage of 150 mg each 4 weeks. Only one patient need 225 mg each 2 weeks. Patients who had finished treatment; 63% had improved with no relapse: 19% didn't answer to the treatment and 19% left the treatment. Patients with angioedema still have angioedema despite the treatment but not as often as before Omalizumab. 10 patients were treated with Omalizumab for atopicdermatitis with no answer at all. 50% were treated with 300 mg each 4 weeks, the rest used 600 mg/2 weeks for 6 months, 300 mg/2 weeks and 150 mg/4 weeks for 3 months.

ATI may belong to different isotypes and are usually measured by ELISA bridging assay. This test is not designed to detect IgG4 antibodies.Objectives: The objective of this study was to analyse the production of IgG4 ATI in a cohort of IFX-treated patients and to evaluate their relationship with non-IgG4 ATI and clinical outcomes. For this purpose, non-IgG4 ATI were detected by using a standardized bridging ELISA (Promonitor) in the serum of a cohort of 172 treated patients with different diseases. The same samples were further analyzed for IgG4 ATI using ImmunoCAP Specific IgG4 (Phadia) and a modified research test in which IFX had been conjugated using click chemistry to human serum albumin coupled to ImmunoCAP. A longitudinal evaluation with both assays was also performed in 38 IFXtreated patients to define the temporal evolution of IgG4 ATI.Results: Non IgG4 ATI developed in 56 out of 172 (32.5%) IFXtreated patients. Detectable levels of IgG4 ATI were shown in 38 out of 172 (22%) treated-patients. 36 out of 56 (64.3%) ATI+ patients developed detectable levels of IgG4 antibodies. Two IgG4positive but ATI-negative patients were identified. Serum levels of IgG4 positively correlated with the serum levels of non IgG4 ATI (P<.0001). Both reactive and non responder patients showed higher percentage of IgG4-positivity than tolerant and responder patients. In fact, among ATI+ IgG4+ subset of patients, 47.6% experienced adverse drug reactions, 22.2% were non-responder, 3.4% were tolerant. No significant differences were observed in patients suffering from different immune-mediated diseases. The longitudinal analysis of anti-IFX IgG4 showed that the majority of patients tested positive for IgG4 after few infusions. Conclusions: This study indicates that anti-IFX IgG4 antibodies frequently developed in treated patients and that a large part of ATI producing patients produce IgG4 against infliximab. A stronger IgG4 response toward IFX is detectable in patients with a previous hypersensitivity reaction to the drug or with a loss of response to the treatment.0468 | Omalizumab retreatment of patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria / chronic spontaneous urticaria following return of symptoms: primary results of the optima study Sussman G 1 ; Hebert J 2 ; Gulliver W 3 ; Lynde CW 4 ; Yang WH 5 ; Chambenoit O 6 ; Vieria A 7 ; Detakacsy F 7 ; Rihakova L 7 Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada; Department of Medicine, Centre Hospitalier de l'Universit e Laval, Quebec, Canada; 3 Faculty of Medicine, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John'S, Canada; 4 Lynde Institute for Dermatology, Markham, Canada; 5 Ottawa Allergy Research Corporation, University of Ottawa Medical School, Ottawa, Canada; 6 Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, United States; 7 Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada, Inc., Dorval, CanadaIntroduction: Since approval of Omalizumab for CSU/CIU (chronic spontaneous urticaria/ chronic idiopathic urticaria) a number of data gaps regarding management of patients with anti-IgE treatment surfaced. The OPTIMA study (NCT02161562) was conducted to answer some key questions on how to optimize omalizumab treatment of patients with CIU/CSU. The primary objective and topic of this abstract is the efficacy of omalizumab retreatment.Objectives: OPTIMA is a Phase 3b, international, multicenter, randomized, open-label, non-comparator study. Patients with CIU/CSU who were symptomatic despite H 1 -antagonists were randomized 4:3 to omalizumab 150 or 300 mg for 24 weeks (1st dosing period).Based on UAS7 scores, patients entered one of the following phases: treatment withdrawal (if UAS7\u22646), step-up to 300 mg (if 150 mg initially and UAS7>6 at week \u22658-24), or continued treatment for 12 more weeks (if 300 mg initially and UAS7>6 at week 24). Patients in the withdrawal group who relapsed (UAS7\u226516) were retreated with their initial dose. The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of patients clinically well controlled (UAS7\u22646) upon retreatment in those who were initially well-controlled but relapsed after withdrawal.Results: A total of 314 patients (73% female, 79% white, mean age 46 years, mean baseline UAS7 score 29.8) were randomized to either 150 mg (n=178) or 300 mg(n=136)omalizumab. The overall percentage of well-controlled patients after 24 weeks of treatment with omalizumab 150 mg or 300 mg was 15.2% and 64.7%, respectively. After treatment withdrawal, 44% of patients on 150 mg and 50% on 300 mg relapsed (USA7\u226516) within 8 weeks. Mean time to relapse was 4.8 (150 mg) and 4.7 (300 mg) weeks. Upon retreatment, the majority of patients achieved UAS7\u22646 (150 mg: 83.3% [95% CI, 62.2%\u00c0100%]; 300 mg: 89.2% [95% CI, 79.2%\u00c099.2%]).", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF116": {"text": "therapy options as a result of providing an IgG epitope repertoire important for efficacy.

These factors result in biological processes which influence gene expression and ultimately disease risk. In a previous study we established that a rather unique allergen environment characterises tropical urban areas: the massive and perennial presence of a single dominant allergen, house dust mites.

Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) is an ubiquitous airborne mold that causes allergic broncho-pulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in asthmatic and cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Specific IgG and IgE are both presumed relevant for ABPA diagnosis. Specific IgE, but not IgG4, responses to Af molecular allergens were reported to display distinct profiles between ABPA patients and CF patients carrying \u00ab benign \u00bb fungal sensitization. Objectives: 1. To describe specific IgG responses to Af extract and molecular allergens in CF and ABPA patients. 2. To compare specific IgG, IgE, and IgG4 responses in CF and ABPA patients. 3. To compare three commercial methods for the determination of specific IgG to Af. Results: Specific IgG, IgE and IgG4 to Af extract and molecular allergens Asp f 1, Asp f 2, Asp f 3, Asp f 4 and Asp f 6 were measured with a fluorescent immuno Assay (FEIA) method in 50 patients comprising 40 CF patients (16 children; 24 adults) and 10 ABPA patients (2 children; 3 CF). IgG to Af were measured with an ELISA kit and immunoelectrophoresis (IEP) in 44 of these patients. Mycological culture was performed in 38 patients. Concomitant IgG and IgE production against Af extract and Asp f 1 was most frequent (90%-100% of both groups). Dissociated IgG and IgE responses were found for other allergens; isolated IgE was more frequent than isolated IgG (29 vs 12) production, especially in the ABPA patients. IgG to Asp f 3 and Asp f 4 were more prevalent among ABPA patients (50% vs 21% and 70% vs 33%, P=.03 and 0.02). Except for Asp f 2, IgG levels to Af extract and allergens were significantly higher in ABPA patients (P \u2264 0.05). IgG and IgG4 levels to Af extract and allergens were correlated, except for Asp f 3 et 4 in the ABPA group and Asp f 6 in patients without ABPA. FEIA and ELISA or IEP IgG determinations were concordant in about 50%. Ten out of 14 positive Aspergillus spp cultures were associated with detection of IgG to Af extract with the three methods. Conclusions: Specific IgG and IgE to Af extract and molecular allergens may help distinguish between ABPA and fungal sensitization. Af molecular allergens display distinct IgG and IgE responses, suggesting different immunogenic behavior and biomarker potential. 0512 | Personalized and rapid food allergy test using natural allergenic extracts Frossard M 1 ; Gasilova N 1 ; Arlettaz L 2 ; Dayer E 2 ; Girault HH 1 Laboratoire d' Electrochimie Physique et Analytique, EPFL Valais Wallis, Ecole Polytechnique F ed erale de Lausanne, Sion, Switzerland; 2 Service d'Immuno-Allergologie, Institut Central des H\u00f4pitaux, Sion, Switzerland", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF125": {"text": "0515 | Basophil activation test (BAT) as a measure of passive sensitization following plasma transfusionApelseth TO; Kvalheim V; Berg RS; Lund KB; Mikkelsen KE; Kristoffersen EK Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway Introduction: Passive transfer of IgE may occur in patients receiving blood components from allergic blood donors. In solvent detergent treated (SD) pooled plasma, specific IgE against common airborne allergens, peanuts, wheat, and latex have been detected. During complex surgery, patients may receive high volumes of plasma and other blood components. Basophil activation test (BAT) measures basophil response to allergens crosslinking membrane bound IgE. Basophil sensitivity may be used to monitor effects of immunotherapy and levels of circulating IgE as seen in anti-IgE treatment. Objectives: A pilot study was performed to investigate whether passive transferred IgE are able to crosslink allergens and thereby activate host basophils in patients receiving plasma transfusion during complex cardiothoracic surgeryResults: Following surgery, 15 patients were transfused with a range of 400-14200 mL SD treated pooled plasma. The day after surgery, BAT and basophil sensitivity (maximal reactivity, CDsens and Area Under the Curve (AUC)) were measured after stimulation with house dust mite and timothy in 6 concentrations (100 000-0.1 squ/mL). Basophils were identified by use of CD193, and CD63 served as activation marker. Results were reported as (mean; median; range). Significant increase in specific IgE (ImmunoCap, Thermo Fisher) against mum levels within the first day after surgery. 4 out of 15 (27%) patients had a positive BAT result against house dust mite and timothy the day after transfusion. Significant positive correlations (Spearman test) were observed between maximum levels of IgE within day 1 against house dust mite (1.61; 0.70; 0.16-7.54 kU/L) and basophil maximal reactivity (14.1; 6.7; 2.1-81.1%) and AUC (106; 40; 10-730910 3 ). Similar, positive correlations were observed between maximum IgE against timothy (0.82; 0.61; 0.15-1.88) and the basophil maximal reactivity (10.8; 6.9; 2.0%-41.1%) and AUC (75; 43; 13-320910 3 ). CDsens could be calculated for 3 positive samples only and showed no correlation to IgE level, maximal reactivity or AUC.Conclusions: We conclude that passive sensitization of basophils may follow plasma transfusion in patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery. Results must be interpreted with caution due to low number, and further studies are recommended to determine the clinical implication of these observations. 0516 | Evaluation and validation of a salivary interleukin-3 immunosorbent assay for the evaluation of chronic urticaria exacerbated by a salicylate rich diet Gumunyu E 1 ; Venter C 2 ; Dzobo W 1 ; Eren E 1 University Hospital Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;Division of Allergy and Immunology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, United States", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF126": {"text": "Results: Results showed there was a significantly increased IL-3 in the saliva of chronic urticaria sufferers compared to controls (mean 54.7AE76.2 vs 20.7AE32.0: P<.05). Upon excluding some patients on IL-3 lowering medication such as steroids and ranitidine (n=7), increased IL-3 was especially noted in a group of chronic urticaria patients on a high salicylate diet compared with low salicylate diet (mean 131.4 vs 42.3). Man Whitney U test showed statistical significance (median 126.3 vs 8.6 n 1 =6, n 2 =6; P=.03). IL-3 in serum was below detectable limits.Conclusions: This is the first study demonstrating raised IL-3 in the saliva of patients with chronic urticaria and proposes a novel mechanism where natural salicylates worsen symptoms of urticaria via increasing levels of IL-3. Measuring salivary IL-3 by ELISA is superior in terms of sensitivity and convenience to serum. Salivary IL-3 levels may provide a simple test to predict which patients may benefit from a low salicylate diet. 0517 | Allergorithm: allergy algorithm to increase pre-test probability of allergic disease Kos S; Neele M; Phaff R; Schenk R; Wulkan R Maasstad Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF127": {"text": "Table 1).\nConclusions: In this study, a significant decrease (87.5%) of bone mineralization was observed in patients with HAX-1 deficiency.
