Moreover, human ventricular cardiac fibroblasts (HCF) were cultured, then starvated and treated with 1) TGF-\u03b2; 2) phTN-C (10 \u00b5g/ml) and TLR4 inhibitor in combination with TN-C and subsequently mRNA expression of \u03b1-SMA, TN-C, Col-1, Col-3 and ACE1 were assessed by RT-qPCR. Finally, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated either with phTN-C (10 \u00b5g/ml) or combination with TLR-4 inhibitor (TAK-242, 50 nM) and analysed the expression of NADPH oxidase 1 and 4 (NOX1, NOX4), and interleukin-6 (IL-6).",

TN-C deficiency was accompanied by preserved ejection fraction (p < 0.05) and preserved endothelium-dependent relaxation (at 18 weeks, p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). Histology revealed less cardiac and perivascular fibrosis in TNC-KO diabetic animals than in the AJ diabetic group (p < 0.01). Notably, larger coronary arteries showed multiple branching distally and thicker arterial walls in diabetic animals, while TNC-KO diabetic mice had richer branching systems, suggesting better left ventricular perfusion. In addition, cumulative dosage of rhTN-C (80 ng/ml) resulted in a significant reduction in cardiac output (p < 0.01) and LV systolic pressure (p < 0.05) in isolated rat hearts. These hemodynamic changes were accompanied by the reduction in ATP and Pcr levels in comparison with saline treatment, respectively (p < 0.01). Mechanistically, hiPSC-CMs under diabetic conditions did not upregulate TN-C. In contrast, TGF-\u03b2 treatment markedly upregulated TN-C expression in HCF (p < 0.01). Notably, HCF exposed to rhTN-C promoted both \u03b1-SMA and ACE1 mRNA expression, respectively (p < 0.05).

Moreover, COVID-19 leads to a typical pattern of laboratory results, creating a yet not fully understood syndrome. In theory, hyperinflammation, cytokine storm, and possibly secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) have been discussed as aggravating factors in critically ill patients. HLH shows similar mortality rates in non-COVID-19 patients (around 40 %) as those registered of COVID-19 ICU-patients (up to 65 %), and viral infections have long been known to act as sHLH triggers. As there is urgent need for effective treatment options, immunosuppression has been suggested, and first reports are promising. However, more data on both its clinical use and real-world reports of sHLH triggered by COVID-19 are needed.",

The mechanisms leading to the transition of one monocyte subset into another and their regulation of lifespan are still unknown to most extend [2] . Without external stimulation by anti-apoptotic signals (i. e. colony stimulating factors), monocytes undergo apoptosis.

Macrophages have been described to switch towards a glucose dependent metabolism during proinflammatory polarization. In recent years, better understanding of macrophage metabolism and changes upon polarization have supported the notion of metabolic reprogramming of macrophages that leads also to functional changes. The possibility of shifting metabolism has sparked numerous novel pharmaceutical concepts. Trimetazidine, targeting long-chain 3-ketoacyl coenzyme A thiolase of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is used regularly as an antianginal drug. The rationale behind therapeutically using trimetazidine is, that during and after ischemia, stimulation of glucose oxidation would be expected to decrease proton production, which is supported by the observation that trimetazidine reduces intracellular acidosis during ischemia. With atherosclerosis being the main reason for angina, most of the patients using trimetazidine suffer from this disease. However, no adverse side effects linked to inflammation were reported for patients taking trimetazidine. Given the great interest in the field for modulating macrophage metabolism and possible effects thereof, we analyzed the impact of trimetazidine mediated FAO inhibition in an atherosclerotic mouse model in vivo and the effects of FAO in macrophages and endothelial cells in vitro.",

In an atherosclerotic mouse model inhibiting FAO using the pharmacological compound trimetazidine resulted in reduced plaque formation, reduced plaque inflammation, and increased plaque stability. Furthermore, we suggest that endothelial cells are most likely not affected by a limited FAO. Our results are in line with previously published data that mainly quiescent endothelial cells depend on FAO, whereas activated endothelial cells rely on glucose metabolism to fulfill their energy needs. we propose that the additional pharmacologic inhibition of FAO does not change the initial metabolic signature of the cell and therefore does not influence the already activated pathways. We demonstrated that reduction of FOA in proinflammatory macrophages reduces the activation of the NLRP3 system and protects mitochondria from damage. Our data is in line with a previous report suggesting a cross talk between NOX-4 and FAO in NLRP3 activation. In conclusion, we suggest that inhibiting FAO and hence forcing cells towards a glucose dependent metabolism does not promote inflammation. Moreover, our in vitro and in vivo data demonstrate, that pharmacological inhibition of FAO has beneficial effects in reducing inflammation via attenuated activation of the NLRP3 system. abstracts S188 this prospective study was arrhythmic death (AD) or resuscitated cardiac arrest (RCA).",

Since this technology is currently limited to single-chamber pacing, efforts are being made in the development of dual-chamber leadless pacemaker systems to enable AV-synchronous pacing.

Then we performed an echo-guided AV delay optimization at rest. Echo measurements of all included patients were collected by a single investigator. We assessed parameters of left ventricular diastolic (averaged E/E' ratio, TR velocity, left atrial volume index [LAVI] ) and systolic function (ejection fraction [EF] , global longitudinal peak systolic strain [GLPSS]), as well as parameters of left (left atrial strain in the contraction phase) and right atrial (right atrial contraction excursion) contractility and the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) with a commercially available ultrasound system (Epiq7\u00ae, Philips Health Systems, The Netherlands). Finally, the left ventricular stroke volume-as a proxy of cardiac output-was measured three times and averaged after at least one minute of hemodynamic adaptation, both during DDD and VVI stimulation at the intrinsic heart rate. The sequence of programming the pacemaker mode was thereby randomized (VVI/DDD vs. DDD/VVI).

St\u00f6llberger 1 1 Krankenanstalt Rudolfstiftung, Wien, \u00d6sterreich Einleitung: Aberrante Sehnenf\u00e4den des linken Ventrikels (LVAS) sind fibromuskul\u00e4re Strukturen, die im linken Ventrikel verlaufen und von einer ventrikul\u00e4ren Struktur zur anderen ziehen. LVAS lassen sich in der Echokardiographie bildgebend darstellen, jedoch besteht keine Empfehlung sie im Befund anzuf\u00fchren. Assoziiert werden LVAS mit Herzger\u00e4uschen, ventrikul\u00e4ren Arrhythmien und St\u00f6rungen der Repolarisation im Ruhe-EKG. Early Repolarisation (ER) ist eine h\u00e4ufige EKG-Ver\u00e4nderung, definiert als J-Punkt Elevationen in mindestens zwei zusammengeh\u00f6renden Ableitungen. Es wird vermutet, dass LVAS eine Rolle in der Entstehung von J-Punkt Erh\u00f6hungen und als Ursache von ER spielen. ER wird unter Patienten mit linksventrikul\u00e4rer Hypertrabekulierung/Noncompaction (LVHT) h\u00e4ufiger gefunden als in der Normalbev\u00f6lkerung (48 % vs. 5-13 %).

The following values were measured in each segment: longitudinal peak systolic strain (LPSS, maximum strain during systole), post-systolic shortening (PSS, amount of shortening after systole), early systolic lengthening (ESL, amount of lengthening in systole), early systolic lengthening time (ELT, time to peak lengthening) and time to peak event (TTP, time to overall shortening). Using these measurements, the following index parameters were computed: PSI ([PSS/maximal strain in the cardiac cycle (maxStrain)]*100), early systolic lengthening index ([ESLI/maxStrain]*100), myocardial dysfunction index (MDI [(ESL amplitude + PSS amplitude)/maxStrain]*100). All segment values of each parameter were added up in each patient. These cumulative values were correlated with infarct size, obtained by CMR 4 \u00b1 2 days post STEMI, using Pearson's correlation.

This underlines the importance of thorough patient characterization and individualized therapy regimens, especially in the heterogeneous HFpEF population. Sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are emerging as a promising novel treatment of heart failure. The proposed mechanisms of action leading to improved outcomes in patients with heart failure include 1) treatment of diabetes as a cardiovascular risk factor, 2) osmodiuresis preventing volume overload, 3) enhancement of the cardio protective Angiotensin 1-7 pathway, instead of Angiotensin II which has a multitude of negative effects on the cardiovascular system.

Fluoroscopy is essential for adequate endocardial ablation catheter positioning. Though fluoroscopy duration is low in the majority of ablation procedures, it is well known that radiation can cause severe side effects for the entire cathlab-team on account by cumulating doses over the years. In addition, the weight of radiation protecting coats can give rise to various musculoskeletal disorders. The rapid advancements of 3D mapping technology over the last few years enable highly accurate and thus safe catheter positioning inside the heart without fluoroscopy (zero-fluoro procedure, ZF). However, only few centers worldwide have yet started to perform ablations of arrhythmias using ZF on a routine daily basis. Our department started to perform ZF procedures on a routine basis for electrophysiology (EP) testing and radiofrequency (RF) ablations of arrhythmias. The main aim was to show the feasibility, safety and efficacy of ZF procedures in a consecutive series of patients.

Systemic thrombolysis is the treatment of choice for high-risk PE with hemodynamic instability, but is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Therefore it is not recommended for the treatment of intermediate high-risk PE. Catheter-based therapies for PE are promising alternatives with a better risk-benefit-ratio due to a lower bleeding risk.

In 99 % of TAVI procedures Sentinel has shown to capture and remove stroke-causing embolic debris.

[3] In the first 72 h after a TAVI, 85 % of all strokes are diagnosed. It is assumed that these are mainly induced by detached thrombi. New cerebral lesions were found in almost 100 % of patients after TAVI on MRI, most of them do not cause a clinically significant stroke.

Niessner 1 Introduction: The current 2019 ESC guidelines for the management of chronic coronary syndromes (CCS) recommend at least one month of triple antithrombotic therapy (TAT) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with an indication for oral anticoagulation (OAC) when the risk of stent thrombosis outweighs the bleeding risk. Dose reduction of NOACs, particularly during TAT, is discussed controversially and CCS guidelines recommend a reduction only when formal reduction criteria apply. We therefore aimed to picture the antithrombotic management and application of dose reduction criteria during TAT from a real-life perspective. Introduction: Exercise training and increased physical activity is a cornerstone in the rehabilitation of cardiac diseases. Unfortunately, after completion of rehabilitation programs many patients fall back into previous routines and thus a rather sedentary lifestyle. This increases their risk of new car-abstracts S231 enrolled in our clinical PREDICT-OAC registry.

Elective PCI was more frequently observed (65.1 %) than acute coronary syndrome (34.9 %). 39.9 % (n = 95) patients received apixaban, 12.6 % (n = 30) dabigatran, 20.6 % (n = 49) edoxaban and 26.9 % (n = 64) rivaroxaban during TAT. 86.6 % (n = 206) were discharged with a reduced dose of a respective agent. Out of these, 44.7 % were discharged with a transient [34.8 % (n = 32) during TAT; 65.2 % (n = 60) during dual antithrombotic therapy (DAT)] and 55.3 % (n = 114) with a permanent dose reduction. When applying the recommended respective criteria for dose reduction, 74.3 % of all patients with dose reduction received a reduced therapeutic regimen without any indication for dose reduction with 84.6 % in the apixaban arm, 74.1 % dabigatran, 57.1 % edoxaban and 72.9 % rivaroxaban, respectively. A prolonged dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT) of >1 month was found in 33. Conclusion: Nearly 50 % of all patients received a transient dose reduction during TAT. Two third of patients experienced a dose reduction of NOACs that could not be justified via applying formal criteria. Therefore, awareness in terms of adequate dosage of NOACs and its duration should be promoted, in order to prevent fatal atherothrombotic and thromboembolic events in these patients.",

Niessner 1 Introduction: The current 2019 ESC guidelines for the management of chronic coronary syndromes (CCS) recommend at least one month of triple antithrombotic therapy (TAT) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with an indication for oral anticoagulation (OAC) and when the risk of stent thrombosis outweighs the bleeding risk. Dose reduction of NOACs, particularly during TAT, is discussed controversially and CCS guidelines recommend a reduction only when formal reduction criteria apply. We therefore aimed to picture the antithrombotic management and application of dose reduction criteria during TAT from a real-life perspective.",

Data collection was done between September and November 2017 and included demographic data, sAP disease history and quality of life. Patients were stratified for revascularisation (prior PCI or CABG) or non-revascularisation (no PCI or CABG in patient's history).

The SAQ assesses in 5 domains physical limitations (Part A), angina stability (Part B) and frequency (Part C), treatment satisfaction (Part D) and disease perception (Part E).

The only significant difference in the SAQ scoring was observed for the subdomain Part A in favor of the patients in the revascularisation group versus non-revascularisation but not reaching the clinically meaningful difference of eight points: 68. Conclusion: Assessing Austrian real-world sAP patients stratified by prior revascularisation procedure or not with the CAD specific SAQ revealed statistically significant difference on how patients present with physical limitations, but not with angina stability and frequency, treatment satisfaction and disease perception.

Chronic systemic inflammation is linked with greater development of atherosclerosis, with the possibility of plaque rupture contributing to a common cause for acute MI. Increased levels of high-sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) of above 0.3 mg/dL indicate a high risk for cardiovascular (CV) events in asymptomatic individuals, as well as patients who have recovered from a previous MI.

Other outcomes of interest were length of ICU stay, necessity of temporary RVAD and overall survival. Data were analyzed for a Gaussian distribution and consequently subjected either to parametric tests (t-test or one way ANOVA) or non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U Test or Kruskal-Wallis Test) using SPSS software (IBM Version 22).

These complications may occur as myocarditis, acute coronary syndrome, cardiogenic shock, heart failure and tachyarrhythmia. Sinoatrial arrest has, to our knowledge, so far not been reported in COVID-19 infection. A 47-year old Caucasian male patient was admitted on March 23rd, 2020 because of a syncope at home on the way to the toilet, lasting about two minutes. Thirty minutes after admission in the emergency room, he again lost consciousness. The ECG monitor showed a sinoatrial arrest of 10 s. After two chest compressions, normal sinus rhythm returned. The patient had a history of hypothyroidism since 9 years, arterial hypertension since 6 years and diabetes mellitus type 2 since one year. He had suffered from fever and cough for 7 days and diarrhea and emesis for one day. He was on a medication with metformin 850 mg twice a day, ramipril 10 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg and levothyroxine sodium 75 microgram.",

Introduction: Venous thromboembolism encompasses deep vein thrombosis and its complication pulmonary embolism and is a major health. Deep vein, fibrin-rich thrombi often occur in large veins of the legs and thrombus resolution is important to prevent embolic events. In early stages predominantly neutrophils and later monocytes and macrophages infiltrate the thrombus regulating its persistence via fibrinolytic responses, coagulation factors clearance and neutrophil extracellular trap formation. This immune cell accumulation is mainly mediated by selectins and adhesion molecules such as P-selectin (CD62P). CD62P is expressed on platelets and endothelial cells and interacts predominately with P-selectin glycoprotein ligand of leukocytes, which is crucial for leukocyte extravasation. Thus, we aim to define effect of CD62P-mediated leukocyte extravasation and activation on thrombus resolution.",

Introduction: Radiofrequency ablation of atrial fibrillation aims to create durable pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) in an effective and safe manner. Over the years, the advent of the 3D electroanatomic mapping systems and the implementation of the CLOSE protocol have greatly improved the success rate of PVI. High power short duration ablation is purposed to further advance this procedure's efficacy and efficiency. We report on our observation over a 3-year period, assessing the impact of different power output settings, normal power versus high power, in atrial fibrillation ablation on PVI procedural efficiency.",

Due to recurrence rates of 10-60 %, redo procedures are common. There is, however, no clear consensus on how a repeat AF ablation should be carried out. Cryoballoon ablation is widely used for first time PVIs and is appreciated for short procedure time and reproducible results. This technology is being increasingly used in redo Fig. 1 | PS 18/18-4 Isolation of the superior vena cava (SVC) is illustrated in the electroanatomical map. The intracardiac electrogram shows repetitive bursts of atrial premature beats which were earliest in the SVC went spontaneously into AF. A stepwise trigger mapping was performed and the responsible atrial premature beats (APB) could be localized to the SVC. Hence, the SVC was isolated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and stable sinus rhythm was achieved. The second case involved a 49-year-old woman. After four PVI procedures and a dual-chamber pacemaker implantation, she was scheduled for a fifth electrophysiologic procedure for recurrent symptomatic AF episodes, documented in the pacemaker. Recurrent bursts of APBs were observed intraprocedurally. Similarly to the previous case, they could be mapped to the SVC. Again, isolation of the SVC was performed, which led to succesful suppression of the APBs and all mode-switch episodes in the pacemaker. Conclusion: Arrhythmogenic foci in the SVC can trigger atrial tachycardias and atrial fibrillation. In AF redo ablation procedures, isolation of the SVC should be considered if atrial arrhythmias recur despite successful PVI.",

As she also reported acute dyspnea and chest pain, she was finally transferred to the cardiology department. At the ward, an electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded that revealed sinus rhythm with 78 beats per minute and normal PQ interval. Remarkable were biphasic T waves from lead V2 to V4 and a ST elevation in lead V5 and V6, respectively (Fig. 1) . Serum troponin T and pro-BNP levels were elevated (228 pg/ ml; reference value: 0-14 pg/L and 6429 pg/ml; reference value: 0-376 pg/L, respectively). All other relevant laboratory parameters were normal. Echocardiography revealed a reduced ejection fraction of the left ventricle (45 %) with akinesia of the apex and all adjacent wall segments. However, the mid-ventricular and basal segments contracted normally. Due to the clinical presentation, the ECG findings, the elevated troponin levels and impaired regional contractility in echocardiography, coronary angiography was performed and showed normal coronary arteries. However, ventriculography confirmed the suspected diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Beta-blocker therapy (Carvedilol 12.5 mg twice daily) was initiated and resulted in recovery of left ventricular contractility (ejection fraction of 65 %) and discharge with of the patient after 6 days in hospital.",

This implicates that aldosterone is not only a predom- Fig. 1 AIx75; augmentation pressure-AP), estimated aortic pulse wave velocity (aoPWV), stroke volume, cardiac output and peripheral resistance. Renin-and Aldosterone concentration were tested in peripheral blood sample using commercially available ChemilumineszenzImmunoAssay. Normal distribution was tested, using Shapiro-Wilk test. Parameters without normal distribution were log-transformed for further analysis. Correlations between quantitative variables were made by calculating the coefficient r of Pearson. A P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Mean age was 47.8 years (range 24-75), 71.4 % were men, 10.7 % smokers. Renal function was preserved, mean serum potassium was 4.1 mmol/l (SD 0.4). ARR was not correlated with 24-hour mean values of brachial or central BP. There was a moderate, direct relationship between ARR and 24-hour measures of wave reflections AIx, AIx75 and AP (r = 0.53, 0.42, and 0.47, respectively; p = 0.004, 0.025, and 0.01) and aortic stiffness (aoPWV; r = 0.47, p = 0.01). There was a stronger, positive relationship between ARR and 24-hour peripheral resistance (r = 0.60, p = 0.0007), and an inverse relationship between ARR and 24-hour cardiac output (r = -0.48, p = 0.01). These relationships were observed across the entire spectrum of ARR- Figure. Patients with elevated ARR (> 1.1 nd/dl/\u00b5U/ml) (n = 10) had significantly higher values for AP, AIx, AIx75, and peripheral resistance, whereas brachial and central BPs did not differ significantly- Table. Conclusion: Our results indicate that changes in ARR are associated with profound changes in steady-state as well as pulsatile haemodynamics. Both can be detrimental in the long run. Our haemodynamic results are well in line with previous findings that aldosterone exerts a direct effect on vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells, leading to vascular dysfunction. abstracts Introduction: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is increasingly used for the treatment of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS), also in low-risk patients. Periprocedural embolic stroke is rare, but potentially associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Thus, there is great interest in preventing any cerebral embolic event. At present, only one cerebral embolic protection systems (CPS) is commercially available and little is known about its efficacy in preventing stroke during TAVI. The Sentinel CPS is a FDA-approved system consisting of two inter-connected filters that are placed in the brachiocephalic trunk and the left carotid artery via the right radial artery.",

We therefore hypothesized that progesterone mediates SCAD development via ECM remodelling. Human aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC) and endothelial cells (ECs) were treated with progesterone and analysed for ECM gene expression. To further elucidate the effects of progesterone on a single receptor, we performed lentiviral transfection of SMCs for stable upregulation of progesterone receptor (PR). Subsequently, we analysed ECM proteins. To identify the transcription factor responsible for ECM changes, we performed next-generation sequencing after lentiviral PR transfection and progesterone stimulation. To confirm our hypothesis in vivo, we performed unilateral carotid artery clamping with adenoviral injection of PR.

From a technical point of view, the implantation of a fully implantable device is possible in pediatric patients with restrictive pathologies, however requires additional extended myectomy to avoid later suction events. The quality of life is noticeably better than with paracorporal devices. No ventricular assist device related complications occurred and the subsequent heart transplantations were uneventful in both patients.

However, there is currently no evidence for increased survival in good neurological condition upon discharge, some observations even suggest possible harm due to impairment of microvascular flow. Whether epinephrine treatment might be associated with impaired intestinal flow with possible harmful consequences is currently not well understood. We therefore aimed to analyze the association between epinephrine treatment and intestinal injury evidenced by circulating intestinal fatty acid binding protein (iFABP) levels in patients undergoing CPR.",

Patients with a symptom-onset of less than 12 h often presented with ST-segment elevation (61.6 % vs. 40.0 %, p = 0.12), while patients with a symptom-onset of more than 12 h typically presented with T-wave inversion (46.7 % vs. 23.3 %, p = 0.05). T-wave inversion was also associated with significantly higher values of NT-pro-BNP (p = 0.024), while high-sensitive cardiac troponin I (hs-CTnI) and creatine kinase (CK) were comparable between the groups. There was no difference in ECG changes among the different types of TTS (apical, midventricular, apical-midventricular and basal type). In a second step, patients with ST-segment elevation were divided into three groups based on the pattern of ST-segment elevation: Group A (concave type, n = 35), group B (straight type, n = 8) and group C (convex type, n = 10), respectively. There was no difference in three-year all-cause mortality based on the type of ST-segment changes (\u03c72 (2) re-events and overall modification of cardiovascular risk factors.

Neprilysin (NEP) is a ubiquitous transmembrane endopeptidase markedly expressed on the cell surface of neutrophils, in this context also known as CD10.

We further observed a significantly better calibration towards long-term mortality for GCW compared to GLS in the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis (P = 0.007). Conclusion: This is the first study to comprehensively assess global myocardial work in patients with advanced heart failure. Important treatment decisions rely on the assessment of myocardial contractility and risk stratification, specifically in late stages of the disease where exact guiding of treatment success and timely allocation of more aggressive treatment strategies are warranted. By incorporating loading conditions, myocardial work seems to be able to sensitively detect changes in myocardial contractility that predict a dismal course of the disease. Our data suggests that global constructive work is a more precise parameter to predict long-term outcome than currently routinely used echocardiographic deformation imaging (i. e. GLS).",

The soluble form of the enzyme, which can be detected in plasma, is discussed controversially as a potential biomarker in HFrEF. Plasma NEP activity is significantly reduced after therapy initiation with ARNi, whereas plasma NEP concentrations remain uninfluenced, and neither activity nor concentrations show a clear association with outcome. In contrast to soluble NEP, intact NEP (CD10) is expressed on the surface of leucocytes under physiological conditions. Alterations of NEP expression have been reported in sepsis, whereas CD10 was suggested to be indicative for neutrophil functional capacity. In a previous explorative study including patients on angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or (angiotensin II receptor blockers) ARB we have shown that NEP expression on granulocytes is, interestingly, inversely correlated with HF severity and mortality. The aim of this study was to assess granulocyte membrane NEP expression in HFrEF patients under contemporary HF therapy including patients on angiotensin receptorneprilysin inhibitor (ARNi) and to explore whether the different modalities of RAS-inhibition (RASi), i. e.

We aimed to investigate the effect of either direct cell-based or indirect paracrine stimulation of hypoxic cardiomyocytes (CMC) for proliferation or regeneration under in vitro conditions. Methods: We compared the gene expression change of hypoxic CMC (group Hyp-CMC) with stimulated hypoxic CMC, either by human bone-marrow derived MSC (group Hyp-CMC-MSC) or by secretome of MSC (group Hyp-CMC-SMSC), over different reoxygenation periods (4 h, 8 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h).",

Resultate: Seit der \u00d6ffnung der Ambulanzen im April sind innerhalb von 3 Monaten zus\u00e4tzlich 169 PatientInnen in die telemedizinische Versorgung eingeschlossen worden. Mittlerweile sind insgesamt 971 PatientInnen so \u00fcberwacht, dies bedeutet eine Steigerung von 17 % und es werden laufend weitere PatientInnen eingeschlossen. Ende 2020 sollen so hochgerechnet ungef\u00e4hr 1300 PatientInnen telemedizinisch betreut werden. Dies bedeutet eine Steigerung um 39 % im Vergleich zu 2019! Eine Senkung an ambulanten Kontrollen um mindestens 15 % wird dadurch erwartet. Im Jahr 2019 wurden durchschnittlich 20 PatientInnen t\u00e4glich in der Device-Ambulanz des LK Wiener Neustadt begutachtet. Dies ergibt eine j\u00e4hrliche Anzahl an ungef\u00e4hr 5400 ambulanten Kontrollen. Durch die Aufstockung der Telemedizin werden f\u00fcr 2021 nur noch ungef\u00e4hr 4450 Kontrollen erwartet, also eine Senkung um mindestens 950 PatientInnen (15 %). Telemedizinisch k\u00f6nnen derzeit von einer \u00c4rztin bzw. einem Arzt bis zu 50 Kontrollen an einem Arbeitstag durchgef\u00fchrt werden. Behandlungsbed\u00fcrftige PatientInnen k\u00f6nnen so rasch einbestellt und gezielt versorgt werden. Dadurch kommt es zu einer Entlastung an Rettungstransporten. Auch administrative Prozesse sowohl f\u00fcr Schreibkr\u00e4fte als auch f\u00fcr Pflege und \u00c4rzte k\u00f6nnen so reduziert werden.

In der Praxis wird die Belastung entgegen g\u00fcltiger Leitlinien oft bereits bei Erreichen derartiger Referenzwerte abgebrochen. Liegt der Referenzwert niedriger als die tats\u00e4chliche Pmax, ist die Belastung lediglich submaximal und es besteht somit die Gefahr, Pathologien zu \u00fcbersehen, die klinisch und diagnostisch erst unmittelbar vor oder getriggert durch maximale Belastung auftreten k\u00f6nnten.

Methoden: In einer prospektiven klinischen Studie an unserer Abteilung wurde bei PatientInnen, die sich einer TAVI unterzogen, mittels Platzierung eines His-Katheters \u00fcber eine Femoralvene die Dynamik der AH-und HV-Zeit sowie der QRS-Dauer zu unterschiedlichen Prozedurzeitpunkten ermittelt. Im Rahmen der statistischen Aufarbeitung der erhobenen Daten wurden die intraprozeduralen Ver\u00e4nderungen der kardialen Reizleitung w\u00e4hrend TAVI zwischen den selbstexpandierbaren Klappenprothesen Abbott Portico und Medtronic Core Valve Evolut verglichen.

Gem\u00e4\u00df der Aussage des Notarztes war im Zuge des BLS durch den Hausarzt keine Defibrillation m\u00f6glich, weswegen als Grundpathologie eine PEA auf Basis eines cerebralen Geschehens vermutet wurde; weiters war es -laut Protokollin der Hausarzt-Praxis zu keiner Adrenalin-Gabe gekommen. Nach Eintreffen an unserer Erstversorgung wurde eine Computertomographie (CCT, CT-Angiogr., CT-Thorax) durchgef\u00fchrt, um etwaige Grundpathologien zu diagnostizieren; hierbei lie\u00dfen sich jedoch keine Ausl\u00f6ser f\u00fcr den Herz-Kreislaufstillstand feststellen. In den folgenden Tagen konnte der Patient von der Intensivstation an die Normalstation mit telemetrischer \u00dcberwachung verlegt werden. Da auch in zus\u00e4tzlichen diagnostischen Verfahren (R\u00f6ntgen, Echokardiographie, Holter-EKG) keine konklusiven Ergebnisse ersichtlich waren, wurde eine Coronarangiographie durchgef\u00fchrt. Diese zeigte zwar Wandunregelm\u00e4\u00dfigkeiten, jedoch keine fassbaren signifikanten Stenosen. In weiterer Folge wurde die Implantation eines Loop-Recorders f\u00fcr den Patienten vereinbart.Resultate: Vor der Implantation hielt eine behandelnde Ober\u00e4rztin noch einmal R\u00fccksprache mit dem Hausarzt, welcher die unmittelbare Reanimation durchgef\u00fchrt hatte. Dieser schilderte die Ereignisse um die Reanimation allerdings anders, als es aus dem not\u00e4rztlichen Protokoll zu entnehmen war: Der Patient kollabiert beobachtet im Wartezimmer der Arztpraxis und reagiert nicht auf Ansprache oder taktile Reize. Es wird eine Reanimation durch den Arzt und dessen Gattin begonnen, inkl. Maskenbeatmung und Sauerstoff-Insufflation. Ein hinzugebrachter halbautomatischer Defibrillator (Modell Responder AED) misst einen schockbaren Rhythmus, daher wird unmittelbar ein Schock abgegeben, nach welchem ein kr\u00e4ftiger Carotis-Puls palpabel ist. Beim Eintreffen des Rettungsteams wird im EKG eine Sinustachykardie mit einer Frequenz von 150/min gemessen, wobei das Rettungsteam inkl. Notarzt keinen Puls tasten kann. Die Reanimation wird daher unter der Arbeitshypothese \"PEA\" fortgesetzt, bis erneut ein Puls getastet werden kann. Der nun intubierte und stabilisierte Patient wird in der Praxis echokardiographiert, wobei sich eine gute LVEF ohne regionale Wandbewegungsst\u00f6rungen zeigt. W\u00e4hrend des Abtransports kommt es zu keinen weiteren Vorkommnissen.Schlussfolgerungen: Aufgrund der ge\u00e4nderten Fallsituation, wurde auf die Implantation eines Loop-Recorders verzichtet. Stattdessen wurde dem Patient ein subkutaner ICD (A219 Emblem MRI mit einer Sonde) implantiert, mit unauff\u00e4lligem Kontroll-Befund. In weiterer Folge konnte der Patient zwei Tage nach Implantation in kardio-respiratorisch stabilen Zustand nach Hause entlassen werden. Eine Woche nach Entlassung tricular pacemaker.

Therefore, we are reporting a case study of a TAVI procedure with an anomalous origin of the right coronary artery.Methods: An 84-year-old man diagnosed with a severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and worsening dyspnea during exertion was referred to our heart team. The preprocedural computed tomography revealed an anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the left coronary sinus (ARCA). The proximal part of the RCA showed an intramural course between the aorta and the pulmonary truncus. It was decided that the amount of calcification in the left cusp was moderate and a compression of the intramural right coronary artery through the expansion of the transcatheter valve is unlikely.Results: The heart team performed a transfemoral TAVI under general anesthesia.

The clinical role of Procalcitonin (PCT), a promising marker of bacterial infections, to detect concomitant infections in acute STEMI is unknown, mainly because it is unclear whether myocardial injury per se induces a systemic PCT release. Therefore we aimed to investigate release kinetics of serum PCT in the acute setting of STEMI and possible associations with myocardial injury markers as comprehensively assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging.Methods: In this prospective observational study, we included 141 STEMI patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Concentrations of PCT, highsensitivity CRP (hs-CRP), WBCc and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) were measured serially at day 1 and day 2 after infarction. CMR imaging to assess infarct size (IS), extent of microvascular injury (MVI) and occurrence of intramyocardial haemorrhage (IMH) was performed within the first week following STEMI.Results: Median concentrations of PCT were 0.07 \u00b5g/l at both time points. In 140 patients (99 %), both PCT values were within the normal range (\u22640.5 \u00b5g/l). Whereas hs-CRP, WBCc, and hs-TnT were significantly correlated with CMR markers of myocardial damage, PCT did not show significant correlations (all p > 0.10) with IS (PCT24 h: r = 0.07; PCT48 h: r = 0.13) or MVI (PCT24 h: r = -0.03; PCT48 h: r = 0.09). Furthermore, PCT failed to discriminate between large and small IS or MVI or between presence and absence of IMH (AUC values:0.46-0.55).Conclusion: In the acute phase after PCI for STEMI, circulating PCT remained unaffected by the extent of myocardial and microvascular tissue damage as visualized by CMR imaging.

The aim of this prospective, observational study was to analyze whether monocyte subset distribution is associated with mortality at 6 months in patients after cardiac arrest.Methods: We included 53 patients admitted to our medical ICU after cardiac arrest. Blood was taken on admission and monocyte subset distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry and distinguished into classical monocytes (CD14++CD16-), intermediate monocytes (CD14++CD16+CCR2+) and non-classical monocytes (CD14+CD16++CCR2-).Results: Median age was 64.5 (IQR 49. .3) years and 75.5 % of patients were male. Mortality at 6 months was 50.9 % and survival with good neurological outcome was 37.7 %. Of interest, monocyte subset distribution upon admission to the ICU did not differ according to survival. However, patients that died within 6 months showed a strong increase in the proinflammatory subset of intermediate monocytes (8.3 % (3.8-14 .6)% vs. 4.1 % (1.5-8.2)%; p = 0.025), and a decrease of classical monocytes (87.5 % (79.9-89.0)% vs. 90.8 % (85.9-92.7)%; p = 0.036) 72 h after admission. In addition, intermediate monocytes were predictive of outcome independent of initial rhythm and time to ROSC and correlated with the CPC-score at 6 months (R = 0.32; p = 0.043).Conclusion: Monocyte subset distribution is associated with outcome in patients surviving a cardiac arrest. This suggests that activation of the innate immune system may play a significant role in patient outcome after cardiac arrest. abstracts Introduction: Secondary prevention after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) mirrors a key position in the reduction of morbidity and mortality in this highly vulnerable patient population. Especially cardiac rehabilitation proved to be one of the most beneficial therapeutic approaches for the reduction of Introduction: The beneficial use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and P2Y12 inhibitors has been established for patients after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, the optimal duration of DAPT is under debate. The aim of the present study was to investigate the long-term utilization and clinical outcome of clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor in patients with ACS in Austria.Methods: We analysed data from 13 Austrian health insurance funds for the years 2015 to 2017, on patients with a hospital discharge diagnosis of ACS. The primary end point was recurrence of ACS or death.Results: From 49124 P2Y12 inhibitor naive patients with a hospital discharge diagnosis of ACS, 25.147 subjects filled a prescription of P2Y12 inhibitor within 30 days after the index event. 10.626 (42.9 %) subjects were identified with a prescription for clopidogrel, 4788 (19.3 %) for prasugrel, and 9383 (37.8 %) for ticagrelor, respectively. Occurrence of an endpoint was highest in the elderly patients. After adjustment for age, sex, and preexisting medication as proxy for comorbidity the hazard ratio for ACS of 0.70 (95 % [CI: 0.61; 0.79]) was similar for prasugrel vs. clopidogrel and 0.70 (95 % [CI: 0.64; 0.77]) for ticagrelor vs. clopidogrel.Conclusion: Ticagrelor was the most frequently prescribed P2Y12 inhibitor among patients below 70 years, and clopidogrel in those aged \u226575 years. Ticagrelor and prasugrel were associated with a lower number of deaths compared to clopidogrel. The risk of recurrence of ACS or death after an ACS is highest in patients \u226575 years.",

Stosic 1 1 3. medizinische Abteilung Wilhelminenspital, Wien, Austria Introduction: Aim of this study was to evaluate the enzymatic infarction size differences between ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in patients with acute occlusion of the left circumflex artery (LCX), and the importance of the posterior leads (V7-V9) in electrocardiogram (ECG) in order to detect pretended NSTEMIs as STEMIs. Methoden: Alle zwischen 2008 und 2019 biopsierten und mittels Histologie oder Genexpressions-Analyse auf Riesenzellen [2] diagnostizierten Patienten (3w, 4 m, mittleres Alter 39+/-10 Jahre) wurden erfasst. Die aktuelle Einsch\u00e4tzung der Lebensqualit\u00e4t, des Gesundheitszustandes, der Arbeitsf\u00e4higkeit, sowie sozio-demographische Daten der \u00dcberlebenden wurden mittels eines standardisierten Fragebogens (WHOQOL_100) erfasst. Anschlie\u00dfend wurden diese Patienten (2w, 3 m) noch telefonisch mittels eines nicht-standardisierten Interviewleitfadens (20 Fragen) \u00fcber ihr derzeitiges Befinden und die Einhaltung der Therapieempfehlungen befragt.Resultate: In 2 Patienten (2w) wurde die GCM histologisch, in 5 (1w, 4 m) mittels Genexpression diagnostiziert. Zwei Patienten (1w, 1 m, Alter 28 +/-2 Jahre) mit kardiogenem Schock erhielten eine ECMO, 1 Patient (w) einen BIVAD. Alle Patienten wurden mit einer kombinierten immunsuppressiven Therapie (Cortison, Cyclosporin A) f\u00fcr mindestens 12 Monate behandelt, die erst nach negativer Kontrollbiopsie (keine Riesenzellen bzw. keine Genexpression f\u00fcr Riesenzellen) ausgeschlichen wurde. In keinem Fall kam es zu einem R\u00fcckfall. Bei Diagnosestellung wiesen die Patienten eine LV-EF von 23+/-13 % (10-45) auf, am Ende der immunsuppressiven Therapie 58+/-10 % (45-70). Zwei Patienten sind verstorben (1w, 1 m), 2 Patienten (1w, 1 m) zeigen eine Defektheilung mit noch eingeschr\u00e4nkter LVEF. Der Rest weist eine Restitutio ad integrum auf (1w, 2 m). Von den \u00dcberlebenden waren zum Zeitpunkt der Befragung (12/2019) noch 2 Patienten (1w, 1 m) unter immunsuppressiver Therapie, w\u00e4hrend 3 Patienten (1w, 2 m) als geheilt galten. Mit Ausnahme eines Patienten (1 m) sind alle \u00dcberlebenden wieder in den Arbeitsprozess eingegliedert. Die Patienten zeigen innerhalb von 2 bis 3 Jahren post GCM eine hohe gesundheitsbezogene Lebensqualit\u00e4t mit wenig Einschr\u00e4nkung. Die Therapieempfehlungen zur Weiterbehandlung werden eingehalten. Aufgrund von Komorbidit\u00e4ten geben 2 Patienten (1w, 1 m) noch Beeintr\u00e4chtigungen ihres t\u00e4glichen Lebens an.Schlussfolgerungen: Durch rasche bioptische Diagnostik und Einsatz moderner Methoden wie ECMO und Immunsuppression hat die GCM eine geringere Mortalit\u00e4t als in der Literatur berichtet. Die wenigen F\u00e4lle zeigen gro\u00dfteils eine gute Prognose. In den ersten Jahren nach der Erkrankung zeigt sich schon wieder eine gute Lebensqualit\u00e4t.Upon 12-lead admission ECG, 59 patients had ST-segment elevation (58 %, STEMI), 9 patients had only ST-segment depression (9 %, NSTEMI) and 27 T-wave inversion (27 %, NSTEMI). Patients with a symptom-onset of less than 12 h often presented with ST-segment elevation (61.6 % vs. 40.0 %, p = 0.12), while patients with a symptom-onset of more than 12 h typically presented with T-wave inversion (46.7 % vs. 23.3 %, p = 0.05). T-wave inversion was also associated with significantly higher values of NT-pro-BNP (p = 0.024), while high-sensitive cardiac troponin I (hs-CTnI) and creatine kinase (CK) were comparable between the groups. There was no difference in ECG changes among the different types of TTS (apical, midventricular, apical-midventricular and basal type). In a second step, patients with ST-segment elevation were divided into three groups based on the pattern of ST-segment elevation: Group A (concave type, n = 35), group B (straight type, n = 8) and group C (convex type, n = 10), respectively. There was no difference in three-year all-cause mortality based on the type of ST-segment changes (\u03c72(2) = 0.839, p = 0.657) or the pattern of ST-elevation (\u03c72(2) = 0.501, p = 0.778).Conclusion: The present study describes typical ECG changes in TTS and highlights their impact on cardiac biomarkers and clinical outcomes. There was no prognostic difference among the different repolarization abnormalities as assessed on admission ECG.",

However, no data are available on the single and joint associations of type 2 diabetes (T2 DM) and CHF with albuminuria. This issue therefore was addressed in the present study.Methods: We investigated 181 patients with CHF, of whom 84 had T2 DM (CHF+/T2 DM+) and 97 did not have diabetes (CHF+/T2 DM-) and 413 controls without CHF, of whom 79 had T2 DM (CHF-/T2 DM+) and 334 did not have diabetes (CHF-/ T2 DM-).Results: The albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) was 34 \u00b1 117 in CHF-/T2 DM-patients.

The ACR did not differ significantly between CHF-/T2 DM+ and CHF+/T2 DM-patients (p = 0.345). In multivariate analysis of covariance, T2 DM and CHF proved to be independent predictors of the ACR after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, LDL-C, smoking and hypertension (F = 6.392; p = 0.012 and F = 13.14; p = <0.001, respectively).",

Venous blood samples were obtained immediately before the surgical intervention (i. e. LVAD or HTx) and after hemodynamic stabilization at approximately 6 months. Routine laboratory measurements including NT-proBNP and active renin concentration (ARC) were performed.

Prior studies could show an association of QRS width with mortality and ventricular arrhythmias, however the number of patients and especially the number of events were low in those studies. We sought to evaluate QRS width and its association with long-time cardiovascular mortality in ToF patients at our clinic for adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD).Methods: Consecutive ToF patients presenting to our ACHD clinic were analyzed retrospectively. Only those patients with at least one documented ECG were included, QRS width was measured. Ten-year cardiovascular mortality was retrieved from the national death registry.Results: A total of 151 patients (median age 20 years, IQR 18-32, 60 % male) were included in the final analysis. At total of 147 (96.7 %) patients were in sinus rhythm. Complete RBBB was present in 127 (84.1 %), incomplete RBBB in 12 (9 %) patients. Median QRS width was 150 ms (IQR 126-160). Four (2.6 %) patients died during 10-year follow-up. Neither QRS as a continuous variable, nor a QRS width of \u2265160 ms, or \u2265180 ms as categorical variables were associated with 10-year survival in a multivariate Cox regression model adjusting for age, sex, and NYHA class.Conclusion: Late cardiovascular mortality in adult TOF patients is very low. In our patient cohort, there was no association of QRS width with outcome. Not pure electrical (ECG) but also mechanical (echocardiography) dyssynchrony should be studied in ToF patients. Electro-mechanical (un)coupling might be the real predictor for adverse outcomes and a target for future treatments.",

A retrospective analysis of patients with true lowflow/low-gradient aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI (Fig. 1B) .Conclusion: NEP inhibition by ARNi does not seem to influence the regulation of granulocyte NEP expression in chronic stable HFrEF patients. The inverse correlation between granulocyte NEP expression and NTproBNP levels is lost for patients on ARNi. Whether granulocyte NEP activity is reduced under ARNi compared to ACEi/ARB has to be investigated in future studies. Einleitung: Klassische Risikofaktoren wie Rauchen, Diabetes mellitus, Hyperlipid\u00e4mie und arterielle Hypertonie spielen bei der Entstehung der koronaren Herzkrankheit (KHK) eine ausgepr\u00e4gte Rolle. So ist bekannt, dass \u00fcber 80 % der an KHK erkrankten Menschen mindestens einen dieser Risikofaktoren aufweisen. Ein Auftreten von KHK im fr\u00fchen Alter kann bei M\u00e4nnern in Zusammenhang mit Rauchen gebracht werden. Bei Frauen sind es Rauchen und Diabetes, welche mit einem fr\u00fchen Auftreten von KHK assoziiert sind. Bei Rauchern f\u00fchrt der Nikotinkonsum, im Vergleich zu Nichtrauchern, zu einer fr\u00fcheren Manifestation der KHK um beinahe 10 Jahre.Methoden: Im Rahmen der Akutkoronarangiographien bei akutem MCI (STEMI, NSTEMI) wurden bei 50 Patienten Faktoren (Alter, STEMI/NSTEMI, Gr\u00f6\u00dfe, Gewicht, BMI, Blutzucker, LDL, TG, AHT, HL, DM, HU, Nikotin, KHK, PAVK, CAVK, Sport, Familie) erhoben, die das kardiovaskul\u00e4re Risikoprofil beeinflussen.Resultate: Auff\u00e4llige ist, dass 71,4 % Nikotin konsumieren. Im Vergleich liegt der Raucheranteil in der Gesamtbev\u00f6lkerung nur bei 24,3 % und nimmt mit dem Alter ab. Dem Gegen\u00fcber geben 60,9 % an regelm\u00e4\u00dfig Sport zu betreiben, wobei in der vergleichbaren Gesamtbev\u00f6lkerung 56,1 % mindestens 150 min sportlich aktiv sind.Schlussfolgerungen: Bei Patienten mit einem MCI scheinen Raucher erheblich \u00fcberrepr\u00e4sentiert zu sein.

Patients were characterized using biochemical and metabolic parameters, as well as a detailed questionnaire on dietary and lifestyle habits. Only patients with stable weight within the last 6 months were included. Data on each individual's weight at 10 and 20 years were extracted from health questionnaires. Finally, the diagnosis of hepatic steatosis was established using ultrasound.Results: Patients with a mean age of 58.4 \u00b1 10.0 years were analyzed, including 820 (50.1 %) patients with hypertension and 227 (13.9 %) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2 DM).

This remains a major drawback of the procedure, even if a valvesparing reoperation can be performed in the majority of cases. This retrospective study evaluates early results of prosthetic reinforcement of the pulmonary AG in order to prevent aneurysmal degeneration.Methods: Between 1991 and 2017 a total of 191 patients underwent a Ross procedure at our institution using different operative techniques. Since 2015, in 16 adolescent and adult patients (mean age of 27.1 \u00b1 16.1 years) the AG was externally reinforced with a straight Dacron graft.

Bilateral carotid artery stenosis \u226570 % was present in 18.8 % of patients and peripheral arterial disease in 28.7 % of patients. In 96.3 % of cases eversion carotid endarterectomy was performed. Mean aortic cross-clamp time was 39 \u00b1 14 min, and cardiopulmonary bypass time was 83 \u00b1 30 min. Median stay on the intensive care unit was 2 days. Mortality, stroke and myocardial infarction rates were 5 %, 7.5 % and 5 % at 30 days and 7.5 %, 7.5 % and 5 % at 90 days, respectively. Combined adverse events occurred in 13.1 % (n = 21) at 30 days and in 13.8 % (n = 22) of patients at 90 days. All 12 patients suffering from postoperative stroke had severe cerebrovascular occlusive disease, including contralateral carotid artery stenosis \u226550 % in 8 patients and occlusion in 2 patients.Conclusion: Patients with coronary and cerebrovascular occlusive disease undergoing simultaneous CEA and CABG are at increased risk of perioperative cardiovascular events, including stroke.

Preoperative characteristics, operative parameters, survival, valve-related adverse events, and valve hemodynamics were assessed.Results: The mean age was 74 \u00b1 8 years, 46 % female. Concomitant procedures were performed in 362 (48.3 %) patients. In the case of isolated AVR (388/700), a minimally invasive surgical (MIS) approach was conducted in 297 patients (76.5 %). Cross-clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass times for isolated aortic valve replacement were 107.7 \u00b1 29.1 and 73.9 \u00b1 21.8 min for MIS approaches and 93.0 \u00b1 28.7 and 57.6 \u00b1 20.4 min for full sternotomy (p < 0.001).
