Hodges, Ph.D. Depts. of Pediatrics & Genetics, Case Western Reserve Univ., Cleveland, OH, USA CF is unquestionably a systemic disorder, affecting every organ system of the body to some degree. What is not clear is how loss of CFTR gives rise to the myriad of physiologic effects characteristic of CF. For the past several decades, most of the focus has been on epithelial cells and epithelia, as they are clearly affected by the loss of CFTR and provide an explanation for elevated sweat electrolytes, airway mucous rheology and some gastrointestinal manifestations. However, CFTR mRNA is expressed in most cell types of the body and channel activity has been reported in many as well (lymphocytes, muscle, neurons, for example), but its role in most non-epithelial cells is not clear. Even less clear is the effect of not having CFTR in these non-epithelial cell types.",

More recently, we have inactivated Cftr in myeloid cells and challenged these mice with an inoculum of P. aeruginosa and compared the effects to mice that had received bone marrow transplants. All mice mounted an inflammatory response, but whereas control mice resolved the response within a few days, CF mice, non-CF mice with myeloid Cftr inactivation and non-CF mice receiving CF bone marrow all experienced prolonged inflammatory indices (~2 weeks). These results also point to dysregulated inflammatory responses by the CF immune system.",

Both alleles were used to examine the effects of manipulating Cftr function in gastrointestinal epithelium.

            "text": "David K. Meyerholz, D.V.M., Ph.D. Pathology, Univ. of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CF is characterized by clinical disease in many organs including the intestines (meconium ileus), pancreas, liver/gallbladder, skin, nasosinus, vas deferens and lung. However, the understanding of how CFTR loss causes disease phenotypes in these diverse organs is limited. Because lung disease is the principal cause of mor-tality in CF, it is an important area of investigational study. CF mouse models were developed nearly twenty years ago and from these, much has been learned regarding CFTR and CF disease. Recently, the advent of pig and ferret models has provided new perspectives for understanding CF disease and pathogenesis. In pigs, both CFTR-Null and CFTR-\u2206F508 models were born with meconium ileus, pancreatic destruction, parameters of focal biliary cirrhosis, and segmental atresia of the vas deferens; however, at birth, the lung lacked inflammation or airway obstruction typical of advanced CF lung disease (1) (2) (3) . To determine if CF pigs would develop lung disease, we surgically corrected the meconium ileus of neonatal pigs and observed their postnatal growth for clinical evidence of lung disease. In the weeks and months after surgery, serial CT scans, bronchoalveolar lavages, cultures, and pathologic examinations revealed that CF pigs developed lung disease characterized by a heterogenous, intermittent to progressive process causing mucopurulent airway obstruction with air trapping, atelectasis and infection by a variety of bacterial pathogens (3) (4) . To better understand the mechanisms responsible for disease, we examined electrolyte transport in newborn CF airways; we found a loss of chloride and bicarbonate transport with no increase in sodium absorption (5) . We challenged newborn CF pigs with S. aureus (clinical isolate from a CF pig) and found that within hours of inoculation, CF pigs had impaired eradication of bacteria compared to their wild-type littermates. These data suggest that lack of CFTR caused a host defense defect in eradicating bacteria before the onset of airway inflammation (4) . We also morphometrically examined trachea and large airways to see if loss of CFTR caused microanatomic changes. CF trachea and primary bronchi had reduced caliber and circularity with hypoplastic submucosal glands, accentuated smooth muscle bundles and discontinuous cartilage along the anterior surface. We found no change in MUC5AC positive goblet cells, cellular height or ciliary height of surface epithelium. To see if the tracheal phenotype translated to humans, we retrospectively examined pediatric CT scans and published trachea data. We found that infants with CF had detectably reduced tracheal circularity and caliber as predicted by the CF pig model (6) . We studied smooth muscle as a possible contributor to this phenotype because of its altered morphology at birth and because altered pathophysiology of airway smooth muscle might explain some of the observed anatomic changes including reduced caliber, reduced circulatory and discontinuous cartilage. Ongoing studies suggest a potential role of CFTR in airway smooth muscle function. We are also studying neonatal and fetal CF pig lung using CT imaging, morphometric analysis and gene expression to assess genotypic differences in airway and parenchymal structure and development. In summary, CF pigs spontaneously develop lung disease like that in humans. This model has helped us address questions regarding CF pathophysiology, and it is helping us identify novel features of the CF phenotype in humans, expanding our clinical understanding of the disease.

Engelhardt, Ph.D. Dept. of Anatomy & Cell Biology, Univ. of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA Animal modeling of cystic fibrosis has been challenging, with species-and strain-specific differences in organ biology and CFTR function influencing the emergence of disease pathology. We have developed a CFTR-deficient ferret model (1) that develops many of the pathologies observed in humans with CF, including defective airway chloride transport and submucosal gland fluid secretion, variably penetrant meconium ileus, pancreatic, liver and vas deferens disease, and most importantly lung infections during the neonatal period (2) . Newborn CFTR-knockout ferrets fail to thrive and succumb to lung infection if untreated shortly after birth. This phe-notype can be partially overcome by antibiotic therapy, supplementation with elemental diet, and drug therapy to raise gastrointestinal pH and normalize liver function tests. Using these rearing methods, CF ferrets can be reared to adulthood. In contrast to neonates, adult CF ferrets contract a more slowly progressive lung disease characterized by excessive mucus production, plugging of the airways, and lethal bacterial infections.",

Since thick mucus, or mucoviscidosis, underlies the pathology of all anatomically distressed tissues in CF, the same basis or phe-nomenon that causes abnormal mucus should occur in each affected organ. Yet, four of the major organs that are affected by thickened mucus in CF cannot \"dehydrate\" mucus via hyperactive ENaC because they lack this cation channel for absorbing Na + and fluid. Consequently, another mechanism common to mucus formation and dependent on CFTR should be present in those organs. An inspection of the organs affected in CF suggests that depressed HCO 3 transport is a common defect in these systems.",

At this time, total weight and body mass index were similar between the two genotypes. Controlled injection of antibiotic resistant PAO1 into the trachea of newborn KO and WT animals demonstrated two orders of magnitude difference in bacterial killing over a 6 hr period. Interestingly, newborn (0-3 day old) WT and KO animals demonstrated no significant differences in mucociliary clearance, suggesting that defects in bacterial eradication were not due to impaired clearance during the newborn interval. However, mucociliary clearance rapidly became impaired within CF animals by 1-2 weeks of life. With advances in medical treatments for CF lung disease, the incidence of CF-related diabetes (CFRD) is climbing-now~50% of CF patients develop CFRD by the age of 30 years (3, 4) . Although CFRD is only infrequently seen in infants,~20% of adolescents are affected (5) . CFRD is now the main secondary complication in CF, and responsible for a 6-fold increase in morbidity and mortality (3) . The pleiotropic nature of CFRD, which does not conform to either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, has made dissection of its etiology and impact on CF lung disease difficult to understand. Declining clinical status and lung function often occurs years before CFRD is diagnosed, and it is uncertain if the pre-diabetic state influences the onset of more severe lung disease or if more severe lung disease influences emergence of CFRD.",

Although histopathology is mild in the CF ferret pancreas at birth, pancreatic disease in CFTR-knockout ferrets is rapidly progressive and leads to destruction of both the exocrine and endocrine pancreas during the first month of life. Such pathology is accompanied by hyper-glycaemia, glycosuria, and fibrosis of the pancreas. To evaluate whether defects in the endocrine pancreas occur prior to the emergence of pancreatic fibrosis and destruction of the exocrine pancreas, we evaluated endocrine pancreas structure and function in newborn CFTRknockout ferrets. Newborn CFTR-knockout ferrets demonstrated no significant changes in the percentage of parenchymal insulin and glucagon positivity in the pancreas. Despite these findings, subtle abnormalities in glycemic regulation were observed. For example, newborn CF ferrets demonstrate abnormal glucose tolerance tests despite the minimal histopathology in the pancreas at birth. CF kits also demonstrate impaired acute insulin secretion following L-arginine or glucose challenge and an exaggerated second phase insulin response to glucose. These findings have begun to implicate CFTR functions in the endocrine pancreas that may contribute early in life to the metabolic and lung pathology in cystic fibrosis. tion concurrent with mucus secretion causes several alterations that appear consistent with mucus abnormalities presumed to occur in CF, namely: 1) mucus discharge is impeded; 2) mucus swelling is reduced; 3) mucus diffusivity is decreased (viscosity is increased); 4) mucus adhesiveness appears increased; and 5) stimulated mucocilliary transport is diminished.",

Vitamin D can be produced in the skin or obtained from the diet from a limited number of foods. After entering the circulation, vitamin D is converted to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) by enzymes in the liver and then to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D), the more active form of vitamin D, by enzymes in the kidney (1) . Other tissues in the body have the ability to convert 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D, which may act as an autocrine and/or paracrine hormone to regulate other extra-skeletal processes (2) .",

Vitamin D deficiency is a concern for the general population, but particularly for individuals with cystic fibrosis, the majority of whom experience maldigestion with resultant malabsorption. Knowing how to treat and prevent vitamin D deficiency is of utmost importance for optimal nutritional care. For this reason, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation formed an evidence based guidelines committee, to develop practice guidelines regarding the assessment and management of vitamin D levels in persons with cystic fibrosis (1) .

            "text": "Probably. The complexity of this question should not be over-estimated because vitamin D has been shown to be an important immunoregulatory molecule vis a vis transplant rejection in addition to being involved in calcium, bone biology, and fracture prevention. Furthermore, extra-skeletal sequelae of vitamin D deficiency include insulin resistance, hypertension, and malignancy (1) , all of which are major comorbidities after lung and solid organ transplantation. The following remarks will focus on the role of vitamin D and both host response to pathogen and transplant immunology. While beyond the scope of this short summary, a myriad of papers largely from the bench and pre-clinical studies, suggest that vitamin D, mainly in the form of 1,25 OH 2 D, augments CD4+, CD25 high regulatory T cells, which are able to immunomodulate allogeneic T cells and thus protect the lung graft from rejection (2) . In addition, vitamin D regulates antigen presentation and contributes to the production of tolerogenic dendritic cells (3) . Recently, two clinical studies in renal transplant recipients showed that vitamin D reduced HLA DR and costimulatory molecule expression in peripheral blood leukocytes, and expanded regulatory T cell populations, results which might be anticipated to have a salubrious effect on transplant rejection (4, 5) . Taken together, these results suggest that vitamin D metabolites might protect the lung allograft by reducing overall alloreactivity (rejection). In addition through antimicrobial peptide (cathelicidin) networks and toll like receptors, vitamin D plays a crucial role in pathogen defense against bacterial and mycobacterial infections (6) . In this way, vitamin D \"primes\" the innate immune response through macrophage and epithelial cell activation (7) . Thus, in a post-transplant environment, vitamin D may have broad reaching positive effects on the health of the patient and the graft.",

First, virtually every disease that results in end-stage lung disease and the need for lung transplantation, including CF, is associated with serious vitamin D deficiency (8) . The same is true for other solid organ transplantation. Thus low 25OHD levels are the norm during advanced illness. The reported prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency after lung transplant ranges from 51% to 97% and of severe deficiency from 26% to 33% (8, 9) . The etiology of this problem is due the chronic disease, inadequate vitamin D intake and low sun exposure due to immobility. In addition, because of an increased risk of skin cancer (7.4% incidence by year 3 and up to 80% after 20 yrs, largely linked to azathioprine use) in organ recipients, many patients dramatically limit their sun exposure (10) . Fortunately newer DNA synthesis inhibitors like mycophenolate (cellcept\u00ae) may cause less risk.",

            "text": "Prospective studies in lung, heart, and liver transplant recipients indicate that serum 25OHD levels tend to gradually increase from the low levels seen before transplantation to normal levels (9, 11) . While some of this change is probably related to the use of vitamin D supplements, it is certainly not all related because, as it pertains to CF individuals, they are already supplemented carefully before lung transplant. Even more importantly a number of transplant medications alter the calciumvitamin D-PTH axis. Thus, PTH, a usually reliable measure of the health of the calcium-vitamin D axis, is a poor biomarker of vitamin D deficiency after transplant because calcineurin immunosuppressants (cyclosporine and tacrolimus) reduce renal function and raise PTH levels over time. In addition calcineurin immunosuppressants raise 1,25OH 2 D levels and lower Vitamin D binding protein production, the latter of which would be expected to lower serum 25OHD levels over time (12) . Furthermore, corticosteroids increase 25OHD catabolism, an effect which may explain, in part, why 25OHD levels go up over time after transplant since corticosteroids are slowed weaned down to a nadir near the 6 month anniversary (13) . Lastly macrolides and azoles, used commonly to slow the advent of chronic rejection or treat fungal infections, respectively, inhibit 25OHD catabolism via the CYP3A4 enzyme and thus would contribute to higher serum 25OHD levels. Therefore vitamin D metabolism after transplant is very complicated. One 2-yr RCT of the efficacy of pamidronate in treating postlung transplant osteoporosis in CF patients treated with routine immunosuppressants, but not macrolides, puts things into perspective. This study demonstrated that serum 25OHD, 1,25OH 2 D and PTH levels went up 50% on average despite no changes in vitamin D supplementation in the patients. Since half the patients were receiving placebo, the effects were not due to bisphosphonate treatment itself (14) . Interestingly other fat soluble vitamin (A and E) levels go up in patients after lung transplantation, despite no difference in supplementation, attesting to the likelihood that drug-drug or drug-vitamin interactions may be taking place at the level of CYP3A4, the complexities of which have not been fully unraveled (15) . Sometimes these levels go so high that cessation of supplements is a consideration.",

Of course, vitamin D deficiency after organ transplant must be taken in the context of the fact that both steroids and calcineurin inhibitors are direct causes of osteoporosis and fracture, as is diabetes, a common complication after transplantation.

Vitamin D supplementation in various forms usually has a salubrious effect on bone endpoints, measured most commonly by bone densitometry as fracture endpoint trials are usually underpowered after transplant. Most vitamin D intervention studies have shown a slowing in bone density decline after transplant. Bisphosphonates, in this regard, are more potent drugs and are considerably better at improving bone density than vitamin D supplements alone. There is not a one-size-fits-all supplementation protocol, so supplement doses should be guided by serum 25OHD levels, similar to what is done before transplant. And realizing for all the fat soluble vitamins, some patient may require large, small or no supplements. It should also be noted that as GFR declines in lung transplant recipients over time (as a consequence of immunosuppressants), a transition from ergo-or chole-calciferol to calcitriol (Rocal-trol\u00ae) may be necessary because the kidney will no longer be able to 1-hydroxylate the precursor molecule to the most biologically active metabolite, 1,25OH 2 D.",

EBM focuses on medical knowledge derived from controlled clinical trials, asserting that such knowledge represents the \"best evidence\" that can be used to support a clinical decision. The value of clinical research for clinical medicine is limited, however, by the relative lack of research, the relevance of the research to clinical practice and by the difficulty of applying populationbased knowledge to the treatment of individuals. Other forms of medical knowledge, including those derived from pathophysiologic understanding and clinical experience, might be helpful, but have been devalued by EBM (2) . Though acknowledging the need to integrate various kinds of medical and non-medical knowledge into clinical decision making, proponents of EBM have said very little about how such integration should actually take place. The process by which clinicians are to weigh and balance what may be conflicting information coming from not only published clinical research but also from personal experience, pathophysiologic understanding of disease, the preferences of individual patients or other \"non-evidentiary\" sources has not been fully elucidated.",

Rather, the clinician must weigh all relevant information in attempting to come to the best decision for an individual patient. The process of clinical decision making must begin with the patient at hand, with the clinician then considering all empirical, experiential and pathophysiologic facts and reasons that bear upon the case before reaching a conclusion regarding the most medically appropriate course of action.

The incidence of NTM disease appears to be increasing in CF, and also in other lung diseases. Increased recovery of NTM in CF airway samples is due in part to specialized processing techniques that have reduced overgrowth by bacterial co-infections, as well as increasing physician awareness. The possibility also exists that exposure to NTM is becoming more common in our modern environment. However, acquisition of NTM is clearly an age-related complication of CF (2), and as median survival increases, so will the prevalence of NTM infection.",

However, in some patients, NTM is clearly associated with accelerated progression of lung disease. As the usual signs, symptoms, and radiographic features of NTM disease broadly overlap with CF lung disease, it is frequently difficult to determine when NTM is an active pathogen. Although Olivier et al. suggested an algorithm to diagnosis NTM disease in the setting of CF based on their nested cohort study, there have been no prospective trials to validate this algorithm (3) . Important considerations include the species of NTM, quantity of organism, number of sep-arate positive cultures, clinical and radiographic evidence of disease progression, and exclusion of other causes of accelerated disease progression. Generally speaking, rapid growers such as M. abscessus are more virulent than slower growers such as M. avium (4) . Nevertheless, slow growing NTMs are capable of causing disease in CF patients.",

However, the most important consideration is that clinical decline is unexpectedly rapid in the setting of aggressive treatment of known pathogens and comorbidities. Often NTM are first looked for (and found) in association with a clinical downturn. An essential part of determining the significance of a new NTM infection is to first aggressively treat other infecting pathogens such as P. aeruginosa or S. aureus infections with IV antibiotics. If the patient does not return to baseline with treatment, we consider a second course of antibacterial antibiotics. A thorough review of airway clearance and other basic elements of CF care should be performed, and therapies maximized. Finally, all potential comorbidities must be addressed, in particular new bacterial infections (i.e. B. cepacia), CF-related diabetes, poorly controlled sinusitis, chronic aspiration and ABPA. Through exclusion of these well-recognized causes of accelerated decline, the contribution of NTM can be established. The case for treatment should be presented to the patient and family, and it is important that both the caregiver and patient be convinced of the need for treatment, as therapy is often difficult and a variety of complications and side effects are likely. As part of the initiation of treatment, the patient should be made aware that there is no proven treatment strategy, the rate of success is not known, and even if treatment is successful the patient is at risk for reactivation or re-infection.

            "text": "How to treat. In the absence of CF specific recommendations, an initial approach to treatment is based on guidelines developed for the general population (5) . For M. abscessus, our standard approach is three-drug thera-py with parenteral amikacin and imipenem (or cefoxitin), combined with an oral macrolide for 3 months. Following this acute intensive treatment phase, therapy can often be changed to an oral macrolide and a fluoroquinolone, in combination with inhaled amikacin. For MAC, our standard approach is 3-drug therapy with a macrolide, ethambutol, and rifampin. However, in the presence of cavitary disease, amikacin can be used for the first 3 months of treatment, and continued up to 6 months if sputum cultures remain positive. Clearly, antibiotic selection will need to be individualized based on pre-existing allergies and toxicities. To a lesser extent, the antibiotic susceptibility of the organism may be a consideration as well; in particular the presence of resistance to clarithromycin in patients who received longterm therapy with azithromycin. Initially, the CF team needs to work closely with the patient to find a drug combination that is tolerated, and in some cases this approach is most effectively accomplished in the inpatient setting. Once a stable drug combination is identified, a critical consideration is monitoring of drug pharmacokinetics, as CF-specific alterations in oral absorption and volume of distribution can result in unexpectedly low drug levels (6) . In general, administration of oral agents with food and enzymes appears to enhance absorption, which may directly contradict recommendations for the general population (i.e. take on an empty stomach). Monitoring for drug-related toxicities is mandatory, such toxicities include development of ototoxicity associated with aminoglycosides, and visual changes associated with ethambutol. A CBC (with platelets) and liver function tests are checked at each visit to monitor for bone marrow suppression and hepatitis, which can be induced by a variety of the antimicrobials. Patients are typically seen in clinic every month during treatment, for sputum culture and laboratory analysis in addition to routine spirometry and physical exam. Standard CF care should be continually emphasized, especially aggressive airway clearance. Throughout the course of treatment, the potential for pulmonary exacerbation due to P. aeruginosa, S. aureus or other typical CF infections must be considered, even if the NTM treatment may have partial overlapping antimicrobial activity against these organisms. When to stop treatment. As with other aspects of NTM treatment, the duration of therapy is not known. In non-CF lung disease, success is defined by clearing the sputum of organisms. The ATS recommendation is that treatment continue for 12 months following clearing of the sputum (5). In our experience, this endpoint is often difficult to achieve. As other biofilm-forming infections such as P. aeruginosa are not routinely cleared from the CF airway, it is expected that NTM infections are sometimes impossible to eradicate as well. However, as with P. aeruginosa, we have seen sustained clinical response to treatment following antimicrobial therapy, despite continued presence of NTM in sputum isolates. Our approach is to initially attempt to clear the sputum, with a prolonged (6-12 month) treatment course. If treatment is not well tolerated despite attempts to introduce alternative drug combinations, a shorter course of therapy can be offered, with clinical improvement as an endpoint. In all patients with a history of NTM, we monitor all subsequent cultures for NTM, expecting that additional courses of NTM treatment will be needed episodically.",

This type of ABC transporter has 2 x 6 transmembrane alpha helices forming two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and these each have four long intracellular helical extensions of transmembrane helices which form cytoplasmic loops (ICLs). Four of these loops bind to pockets in the two cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domains (NBDs), with one loop from each transmembrane domain crossing over to contact the NBD on the opposite side of the transporter (1, 2) . The structures of Sav1866, MsbA and ABCB1 show overall folds that are broadly similar, however ABCB1 (and some lowerresolution structures for other MsbA orthologs) show a wide separation of the NBDs and an inward-facing (i.e., cytoplasm-facing) orientation of the two TMDs (3, 4) . In contrast, Sav1866 and some of the MsbA orthologs display closely associated NBDs and a more outward-facing configuration of the TMDs (1-3). These structural studies imply that major conformational changes can occur in the relative orientation of the four domains. Similar, but smaller conformational changes have also been observed in a separate group of bacterial ABC proteins which carry out the import of substances into the cell (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . Large conformational changes were previously proposed to be part of the substrate translocation mechanism for ABC transporters, and the formation of a sandwichdimer of NBDs in the presence of nucleotides will be addressed in more detail in my presentation (12) .",

These crystals were obtained in the presence of the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue AMP-PNP (13) , and with two separate crystal forms present. The data generated by these studies was estimated to have a spatial resoilution of ~20\u00c5, typical for negatively-stained specimens where the detail is limited by the granular nature of the uranyl acetate stain and by dehydration in the high vacuum of the microscope (14, 15) . Despite these drawbacks, the structural data showed that CFTR within the 2D crystals was in a monomeric state, and that it was structurally homologous to ABCB1 (16), as expected. Conditions have now been found that yield better 2D arrays of CFTR and higher resolution data has been extracted from these crystals in the unstained and frozen-hydrated state (Rosenberg, M.F., et. al., submitted). These conditions require the absence of nucleotide, hence the protein should be quiescent. Under these conditions, the protein was packed in two crystalline layers stacked on top of each other. This new unit cell packing and the structures of the two CFTR molecules in the unit cell will be described in the symposium.",

Therefore, an important goal in developing novel CF therapies is to better understand how CFTR acquires and maintains its folded state in the cellular environment. In particular, attention has focused on NBD1 where the \u2206F508 mutation confers a temperature-sensitive phenotype, decreases thermal stability, interferes with interactions between NBD1 and the membrane spanning domains, and changes NBD2 (2) (3) (4) (5) . WT NBD1 exhibits a melting temperature near 37\u00b0C which is reduced by loss of Phe508, resulting in an unstable form of the mutant protein. Moreover, refolding of NBD1 in vitro is very inefficient, suggesting that proper NBD1 structure is dependent upon the specific folding pathway. Because it takes 5-7 minutes to synthesize full length CFTR protein in cells, whereas secondary protein structure forms on a millisecond time scale, many aspects of folding, i.e., membrane insertion (6) and initial domain folding (7) occur cotranslationally as nascent CFTR emerges from the ribosome. This initial domain folding is followed by slow domain assembly (8) and release from a complex set of chaperone machinery (9) , as confirmed by the timing of proteolytic changes in the various CFTR domains and its relatively long residence time (30-120 min) in the ER.",

            "text": "Recent studies using limited proteolysis and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) have begun to tease out early folding steps that give rise to NBD1 struc-ture. A primary defect in \u2206F508 CFTR arises in NBD1 and can be identified by characteristic proteolytic patterns for the recombinant, in vitro translated, and cell expressed NBD1 domain, as well as full-length CFTR. This basic defect can be rescued by a secondary suppressor mutation, I539T, which like Phe508 is located in the \u03b1-subdomain region of NBD1 (residues 495-564). A fascinating feature of this suppressor mutation is that mice already carry a Thr residue at this position, which likely explains increased NBD1 WT and \u2206F508 thermal stability compared to human NBD1, and perhaps their milder lung disease phenotype. Consistent with the above-mentioned results, I539T fully rescues \u03b1-subdomain stability and conformation (10) . Examination of ribosome-bound nascent chains by FRET has further revealed that NBD1 folding begins cotranslationally with rapid collapse of a short N-terminal subdomain (residues 389-~500) that forms a minimal ATP-binding site (11) . This region contains the three-stranded ABC \u03b2-subdomain, the unstructured regulatory insertion (RI), as well as regions previously ascribed to the F1-type ATPase core. The CF-causing mutation L441P interferes with N-terminal subdomain folding and disrupts CFTR trafficking, whereas removal of the regulatory insertion, which improves trafficking of the full-length protein (12) , also improves N-terminus folding efficiency. Thus efficient folding of the N-terminal subdomain appears to be a key event that may provide a template upon which the subsequent \u03b1-subdomain and the \u03b1/\u03b2 core assemble. Impor-tantly, kinetic analysis of N-terminal subdomain folding, as well as analysis of regions C-terminal to this subdomain, indicates that \u2206F508 specifically impacts subsequent folding of the \u03b1-subdomain and/or the \u03b1/\u03b2-sheet core.",

            "text": "References CFTR has two fascinating distinctions. First, it is the only member of the ABC transporter superfamily that is known to function as an ion channel. Other ABC transporters are pumps that use the free energy from ATP hydrolysis to drive substrate transport uphill against concentration gradients (1) . Anion transport through the CFTR channel is a passive process driven solely by prevailing electrochemical gradients. Second, CFTR is the only known ion channel that couples an enzymatic activity to channel gating. Channel opening is conformationally linked to ATP binding and the associated dimerization of the two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). Channel closing is facilitated by ATP hydrolysis and the subsequent release of the hydrolysis products from one of the two ATP binding sites (2) (3) (4) (5) . The rate of channel closing in the absence of ATP hydrolysis is otherwise very low due presumably to the tightness of the NBD dimer (5) . Thus, the ATPase activity of CFTR has been adapted to energize a cycle of channel gating rather than chloride transport against an electrochemical gradient.",

            "text": "This unique enzymatic activity of the CFTR channel begs the question-how does its gating compare to that of conventional ligand-gated channels? The gating of more typical ligand-gated channels (e.g., nicotinic acetylcholine channels) obeys allosteric principles described decades ago (6-9). The first principle of an allosteric mechanism for a typical ligand-gated channel is that ligand binding shifts the equilibrium between closed and open states but is not absolutely required for channel opening. Unliganded openings are possible (albeit with a lower probability) as are constitutive mutations that increase the frequency of unliganded openings. Such mutations often locate to the symmetry axis between the ligand binding site(s) and the channel gates (7) (8) (9) . CFTR differs from conventional ligand-gated channels because it usually consumes its ligand (ATP) during the gating cycle. But, it is becoming clear that CFTR channel gating does share some important features with the gating of conventional ligand-gated channels that reversibly bind their ligands. Several groups have observed that wild type CFTR channels can open (albeit rarely) in the absence of ATP (10, 11) . In addition, a number of constitutive mutations that enhance unliganded CFTR activity have been reported (11, 12) . Our group produced several such mutations within the long cytosolic loops that connect the NBDs to the transmembrane domains (TMDs) (11) . These constitutive mutations locate to the putative symmetry axis of the CFTR channel between the NBDs and the TMDs when mapped onto the available crystal structures of other ABC transporters. The constitutive mutations in the cytosolic loops also enhance ligand (ATP) sensitivity, a cardinal feature of a classic allosteric gating process (reciprocity principle). These findings support a \"hybrid\" gating mechanism for CFTR channels that blends the allosterism of a ligandgated channel with its unique enzymatic activity (13) .",

            "text": "The constitutive mutations that we and others have produced can be used as tools to explore fundamental aspects of CFTR channel regulation. Two specific examples that we discuss here are: (i) defining the mechanisms by which R domain phosphorylation enhances CFTR channel activity; and (ii) promoting unliganded activity as a means to circumvent the defective gating of CF mutant channels. Regarding the first example, the main physiologic cue for CFTR channel activation in vivo is phosphorylation of its R domain by cyclic nucleotide dependent kinases (14) . The underlying mechanisms are poorly understood although there is evidence that NBD dimerization is regulated by R domain phosphorylation (15) . By introducing constitutive mutations into channel constructs that cannot dimerize their NBDs (e.g., an NBD2 deletion construct), we determined that R domain phosphorylation strongly promotes CFTR channel activity in the absence of either ATP binding or NBD dimerization (11) . These and other data support a model in which the R domain interacts with the TMDs and/or the connecting cytosolic loops to modulate channel opening. Regarding the second example, the most prevalent CF-causing mutations (G551D and F508del) strongly disrupt ATP-dependent channel gating. Importantly, the very low activities of these CF mutant channels can be markedly improved by introducing constitutive mutations in the cytosolic loops (11) . Defining how these loop mutations promote unliganded channel opening may inform new strategies for augmenting the activities of CF mutant channels. (4) , and with the support of the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, states throughout the United States began implementing CF newborn screening programs. By December 2009, babies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia were being screened for CF. Prior to implementation of newborn screening, babies would typically present with failure to thrive, steatorrhea, respiratory symptoms, or other complications of untreated CF. While some infants with CF diagnosed by newborn screening still present with symptoms, and 15-20% of infants are still presenting with meconium ileus, US CF clinics are seeing a different type of infant with CF than in previous decades. New guidelines provide treatment and monitoring recommendations for the care of infants, with a focus on infants identified early through newborn screening (5,6); however, the US CF community is still gaining an understanding of the new face of the infant with CF.",

The failure to impact on adult mortality appears at odds with data that indicate a majority of individuals with CF have apparently normal lung function in mid-childhood. However, US data indicate that, consistent with mortality rates, the best modern treatment has failed to significantly alter the trajectory of decline in lung function in adults. One plausible explanation for this conundrum is that commonly used measurements of lung function, such as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), underestimate the presence and progression of lung disease. Evidence supporting this assertion comes the Netherlands. De Jong et al. compared changes in FEV1 with assessments of structurual lung disease obtained using computed tomography (CT) using a validated scoring system (1). This group observed that despite stable lung function, CT scores worsened over time. de Jong and colleagues also observed structural changes in infants and young children with CF using CT. Therefore, currently available data suggest that structural changes detected by CT could be useful for detecting early manifestations of CF lung disease and for describing disease heterogeneity. Based on these observations, the Australian Respiratory Early Surveillance Team for Cystic Fibrosis (AREST CF) collaboration combined CT together with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and measurements of infant and preschool lung function in an early surveillance program for children diagnosed with CF following newborn screening (NBS). This innovative surveil-lance program has provided the first comprehensive snapshot of the earliest pathophysiological changes in the lung associated with CF and the significant factors that contribute to structural lung disease, notably bronchiectasis.",

Specimens with an elevated IRT are sent to Stanford University Molecular Genetics Laboratory for CFTR mutation analysis (Asuragen Signature\u00ae CF 2.0 ASR) with a panel of 40 mutations determined to occur with high frequency in California (2, 3, 4) . A unique feature of the California NBS algorithm is that specimens with only one mutation identified undergo further testing by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) and focused sequencing (Ambry Genetics Aliso Viejo, CA from July 2007 to July 2009; Stanford University Molecular Genetics Laboratory from 2009 and onward). This methodology is not constrained to the detection of known mutations, as in many commercially available panels. Thus, it can detect previously known as well as novel CFTR mutations and variants (4). Only infants whose specimens have at least two mutations or variations identified are considered positive to screening and referred to accredited CF Centers (CFCs) in California for confirmatory testing through sweat chloride determination.

Not surprisingly, only infants with severe mutations had sweat chloride values in the diagnostic range. The remainder had values at presentation below the indeterminate cut off (<30 mmol/L). Of importance, a significant proportion of these infants (25%) have developed clinical problems that have led to a diagnosis of CF based on the presence of mutations plus clinical manifestations, and this despite their low sweat chloride values (9) . Although CFTR genotype and sweat chloride are correlated, neither measure is a perfect predictor of the development of clinically apparent CF disease. Ruling out a diagnosis of CF should not be based solely on sweat chloride values. Our experience so far emphasizes the importance of longitudinal follow up at CF Centers regardless of initial sweat chloride results. The information being generated regarding the clinical and prognostic implications of a genetic diagnosis of CF based on the detection of alleles with variants and novel mutations will be of great importance to further inform the natural history of the disease in this genetically diverse group. The diagnostic criteria for cystic fibrosis (CF) necessitates that evidence of CFTR dysfunction must be present for a diagnosis to be made (1) . That criterion can be satisfied by identification of two known CF-causing mutations. The list of mutations included in the consensus statement on diagnosis was drawn from the 23 mutations identified by the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) as having direct or empirical evidence of sufficient loss of CFTR function to cause disease (when paired with another CF-causing mutation) (2). However many more mutations in the CFTR gene than these 23 with well characterized disease liability have been identified (3) . The Clinical and Functional Translation of CFTR (CFTR2) project was funded by the U.S. CF Foundation to address this gap in knowledge between well characterized (usually the most commonly seen) mutations, and the less commonly seen mutations with unknown disease liability. CFTR2 has compiled patient information on nearly 40,000 CF patients from North America and Europe to identify all mutations that are seen in CF patients, and then to prioritize those mutations for functional analysis.",

Nonsense mutations (n=35), mutations of the canonical nucleotides of the splice donor/acceptor sites (n=15), and insertion/deletion mutations that cause a frameshift (n=30) account for 50% of these 160 mutations. These classes of mutations would be expected to introduce a premature termination codon and lead to nonsense mediated RNA decay and no protein product. The clinical characteristics of patients who carry these types of mutations are all consistent with CF, with sweat chloride concentrations clearly in the diagnostic range and with high rates of pancreatic insufficiency. The remaining 80 mutations cannot be declared deleterious on the basis of their mutation type alone, and therefore require further functional assessment. Missense changes represent a particular diagnostic challenge as they can result in a protein that is produced in inadequate quantities by the cell, one that does not conduct chloride, or a protein that is fully functional despite the amino acid substitution. The CFTR2 project in association with Vertex Pharmaceuticals coordinated the production of cell lines stably expressing the missense mutations (n=65) among the top 160 for analysis of RNA and protein levels, protein maturation, and chloride conductance. Mutations predicted to alter splicing that have not been previously studied are being analyzed as well. As a result of these efforts, the number of mutations that can be rigorously characterized as CF-causing is expanded from 23 to 130 (details on www.cftr2.org).

Therefore, the challenge of CFTR mutations of uncertain clinical significance and of lower penetrance must be considered in CF diagnosis and screening when genetic information is used in testing. The inclusion of a mutation of uncertain clinical consequence or incomplete penetrance in a newborn screening panel creates a situation (not unlike a borderline biochemical test) that leaves the family and primary care provider with unpredictable prognosis, and requires a detailed follow-up plan from the testing organization and possibly CF care center.

The virulence properties of this microorganism facilitate infection of a wide array of tissues and organs, including the human lung. Historically, S. aureus pneumonia has been a scourge of the critical care environment, not often documented as a cause of community acquired disease. However, an alarming trend has been noted for over a decade, as an increase in the incidence of severe S. aureus pneumonia in otherwise healthy adults and children has been reported. Recent studies suggest that approximately 50,000 cases of S. aureus pneumonia occur in the U.S. alone each year, with more than half caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (2) . Increasing antimicrobial resistance among S. aureus strains and the appearance of particularly virulent isolates of this pathogen within the community have rendered conventional antimicrobial therapies obsolete, resulting in increased mortality and cost of care (3). Concomitant with these changes, individuals with cystic fibrosis have experienced an increasing burden of drug-resistant S. aureus disease (4). Novel therapeutic approaches to both prevent and treat invasive pulmonary infection with S. aureus, and especially MRSA, are necessary. As S. aureus is a key colonizing organism and pathogen in both the normal and CF host, understanding the principles that govern the interaction of the host with the pathogen in both patient populations is likely to provide keen insights that will enhance our ability to combat S. aureus lung disease.",

            "text": "Studies of disease pathogenesis. As a first step in understanding the pathogenesis of S. aureus pneumonia, animal models have been used to define the pathogenencoded virulence factors that facilitate lung infection. Initial work in the field led to the observation that staphylococcal Protein A, a cell-wall associated protein, contributes to lung disease by virtue of its ability to interact with the tumor-necrosis factor-alpha receptor, TNFR1, and stimulate proinflammatory responses (5) . Disruption of the interaction of Protein A with TNFR1, either by genetic deletion of Protein A in engineered S. aureus, or in TNFR1 knockout mice, mitigates disease (5). Subsequently, studies in an adult, immunocompetent mouse model of S. aureus pneumonia have revealed a profound defect in virulence when mice were infected with strains engineered to lack expression of \u03b1-hemolysin (Hla), a pore-forming exotoxin that is produced by almost all strains of S. aureus (6) . Further investigation of \u03b1hemolysin in S. aureus pneumonia revealed the central role of this single toxin in the modulation of virulence, correlating \u03b1-hemolysin expression with mortality in animal studies and direct injury to the pulmonary alveolar epithelium (7) . As a toxin that forms injurious pores in the eukaryotic cell membrane, the mechanism of \u03b1hemolysin-induced injury to the lung appears conceptually simple -the toxin can induce irreversible damage to the plasma membrane, culminating in cell death and organ dysfunction. The recent identification of A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) as the cellular receptor for \u03b1-hemolysin is anticipated to yield further insights into the mechanism of toxin action, and may also permit a clearer understanding of host susceptibility to disease (8) . ADAM10 plays an essential role in the maintenance and turnover of the epithelium (9) . The use of this protein as a toxin receptor raises the interesting possibility that the toxin may not only bind to the receptor to gain access to the host cell, but may take advantage of the native function of ADAM10 to specifically injure the epithelium of the lung.",

At present, the field remains limited by a lack of knowledge of the hostpathogen interaction in human disease. While experimental model systems have provided keen insight into the complexities of this interaction, this knowledge will need to be extended to the human population through well-designed clinical studies aimed at identifying factors that contribute to host susceptibility as well as evaluate the contribution of staphylococcal virulence factors to disease.

In CF patients, S. aureus biofilms in the upper airways (e.g., sinuses) and lower airways present challenges for eradication efforts. In non-CF patients, there are data suggesting that mupirocin in combination with chlorhexidine may eliminate short-term colonization and reduce skin infection with MRSA, but these regimens do little to prevent airway colonization. A recent investigation in CF patients using aggressive regimens for MRSA eradication demonstrated that regimens that typically combined 2 oral antibiotics plus nebulized vancomycin plus topical skin and nasal disinfection may be effective at eradicating MRSA colonization, with eradication rates of approximately 80%. Some patients required multiple courses of therapy to achieve eradication. The clinical benefit of eradication is incompletely understood.",

Although many different eradication regimens were used, most of the patients in their cohort were treated with a combination of two oral antibiotics (rifampicin, fusidic acid or trimethoprim) and nebulized vancomycin. They reported eradication of MRSA in 81% of the participants at 6 months. There was no distinction made between those with incident MRSA and those with persistent MRSA infection in the study analysis, although they report that approximately 38% of those included had had multiple positive MRSA cultures. Garske focused on treatment of CF adults with persistent MRSA (4). The study enrolled seven CF adults with persistent MRSA (average FEV1 36% predicted, all with chronic PA, 6/7 with previous IV MRSA therapy); 5 of the 7 patients (71%) were culture-negative six months after completing a six month treatment regimen of oral fusidic acid and rifampin (4) . Most other studies have focused on patients with incident MRSA infection rather than persistent infection. Macfarlane reported on 17 CF patients with incident MRSA treated with oral and IV antibiotics. Utilizing a protocol which started with oral rifampicin and fusidic acid, they achieved a 94% eradication rate at 12 months (5). A study by Solis of 15 CF children treated with five days of oral and nebulized vancomycin was associated with a 55% eradication rate (6) .",

            "text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive \"monogenic\" disorder caused by mutations in CFTR. There is a wide range of lung disease severity in CF, even for patients who are homozygous F508del. Studies of twins and sibs have determined that non-CFTR genetic factors account for >50% of variability in lung disease (1) . Identification of non-CFTR gene modifiers is particularly relevant in CF, as almost all patients are now being diagnosed through neonatal screening programs. To intensively study gene modifiers, a North American CF Gene Modifier Consortium was formed by investigators at UNC/CWRU, Johns Hopkins, and Toronto, Canada. The Consortium developed a quantitative and standardized lung disease phenotype, based on multiple measures of FEV 1 over 3 years, adjusted for survival (2) . A GWAS (Illumina 610 Quad) was performed in 3,467 CF patients, and two loci with genome-wide significance were discovered (3). One locus was identified at chr 20q13.2 by linkage analysis of the Twin and Sibs (Hopkins) cohort (LOD score of 5.03), and SNPs under the linkage peak replicated in UNC/CWRU and Canadian association population patients. A robust association at chr 11p13 was discovered (p=3.3 x 10 -8 ) in F508del homozygotes in UNC/CWRU and Canadian patients, and replicated in the family-based (Hopkins) population (joint analysis of three studies, p=1.5x10 -9 ). The significant SNPs at chr 11p13 are located in an intergenic region, 3' to EHF (an epithelial-specific transcription factor) and APIP (an inhibitor of apoptosis) (4) (5) (6) (7) . EHF is expressed in airway epithelia, and may serve as a regulator of differentiation under conditions of stress, and/or play a role in inflammation (8, 9) . APIP inhibits apoptosis, and cis expression QTL (eQTL) patterns are reported for lymphocytes. The direction of the APIP eQTLs and \"risk\" SNPs in the GWAS suggest increased expression of APIP, and inhibition of apoptosis, is associated with worse CF lung disease. This is consistent with the concepts that delayed neutrophil clearance caused by reduced apoptosis can cause inflammation in the CF airways, and inhibition of apoptosis can contribute to mucus cell metaplasia (10, 11) . The intergenic region at chr 11p13 has predicted regulatory features, including open chromatin domains. Ongoing work will test the hypothesis that genomic variation in this region alters expression of nearby genes, which has biologic relevance to CF airways disease. The study of genes that modify severity of \"monogenetic\" diseases, such as CF, is progressing rapidly, and mechanistic insights are beginning to emerge. The extension of the Consortium to trans-Atlantic (France) sites will provide additional power to identify new loci for studies to link genetic variation to mechanisms of lung disease severity.",

With the resources of the North American CF Gene Modifier Consortium (1), we sought to identify genes that contribute to MI susceptibility. Using the traditional genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach, two highly significant genome regions were identified with five SNPs with p values < 5 x 10 -8 . The regions correspond to the SLC6A14 and SLC26A9 genes, and their SNP associations to MI have been replicated in additional North American and French CF patient sets. However, they explain only 5% of the MI phenotypic variability. To identify additional modifier genes that contribute to MI, we developed the hypothesis-driven GWAS (GWAS-HD) to reprioritize genotyping results considering current molecular understanding of CF. A major aspect of CF pathophysiology is impaired fluid and electrolyte flux at the epithelial interfaces of a number of CF-affected organs including the airway and intestine. The single cell epithelial layer is unique in that it forms a highly selective and tight barrier between body organ and surface or ductal interfaces. Epithelial function is achieved by cell polarization whereby many determinants and reg-ulators of fluid, solute and ion transport, including the CFTR ion channel reside specifically at the apical membrane. With these considerations, we proposed our \"apical hypothesis\" and used data from the Gene Ontology Consortium (2) to derive two lists of genes to test for relationship to MI susceptibility, one with gene products that localize to the apical membrane (155 genes), the second, with gene products that localize to the nuclear envelope (224 genes). The nuclear gene group showed no association to MI as anticipated, however, the \"apical gene\" group showed significant association, p-value = 0.0002. Together, the apical genes account for 17% of phenotypic variability in MI. Efforts to understand the biology of these contributing apical genes, and their relation to MI susceptibility and other CF phenotypes will be discussed.",

Diabetes occurs almost exclusively in CF patients with severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, suggesting that pancreatic autodigestion of islet cells may play a role. In support of this hypothesis, CF patients have demonstrated decreased glucagon and pancreatic polypeptide (made in the alpha and delta cells of the islets)(1). However, other lines of evidence suggest other factors are involved. First, the rate of CFRD varies widely even among CF patients with the same severe CFTR mutations (e.g., homozygous F508del). Second, epidemiologic data suggest that other factors (CF liver disease, transplant medications, ABPA) play a role, at least in a subset of people with CFRD (2) . Third, studies of pancreatic tissue from diabetic and non-diabetic CF patients failed to detect correlation in CFRD status with islet cell mass or number. In general, pancreatic islets are preserved as the exocrine tissue becomes fibrotic. Interestingly, these studies found that a specific marker of CFRD was the presence of islet amyloid, a marker for beta cell dysfunction also specific to type 2 diabetes (T2D)(3). Finally, knock-out mouse studies have suggested there may be an intrinsic defect in CFTR-deficient pancreatic beta cells (4) .",

Initially, beta cell proliferation increases the insulin secretory capacity. Over time, however, beta cell function diminishes, resulting in hyperglycemia, and eventually, treatment with insulin. At diagnosis, patients with T2D may have lost 80% of insulin secretory capacity.",

Further analysis of the chromosome 8 region suggested that the gene involved is MSRA (Henderson, unpublished) , encoding methionine sulfoxide reductase A, an enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of methionine sulfoxide to methionine. We introduced a null allele of MsrA into a CF line (Cftrtm1Unc) and compared the incidence of intestinal obstruction in CF mice with the three different MsrA genotypes. At 40 days, only 17% of CF mice (n=30) with wildtype MsrA survived, while 42% of those herterozygous for the MsrA mutant allele (n=33) and 61% homozygous for the mutant allele (n=46) survived.

Yet, it is unclear how the RMA1 complex distinguishes between on-and off-pathway forms of nascent CFTR. RMA1 interacts with the transmembrane quality control factor Derlin-1 and siRNA knockdown of Derlin-1 enhances cell surface expression of CFTR (4). Derlin-1 can form complexes with MSD1 of CFTR and Derlin-1 overexpression promotes ER retention and proteasomal degradation of CFTR (4). So, it is possible that Derlin-1 is part of a complex that acts as a membrane chaperone to scan the assembly status of CFTR's membrane regions and targets misassembled forms to RMA1 for ubiquitination. This seems logical, except the region in CFTR that is ubiquitinated by RMA1 is cytosolic. Therefore, quality control factors in addition to Derlin-1 may assist RMA1 in the selection of misfolded CFTR for ubiquitination. Clues to the identity of such a factor come from the analysis of the Hsp40/DnaJ family of Hsc70 co-chaperones. Hsp40 proteins utilize a conserved J-domain to regulate Hsc70 ATPase activity and specify client proteins of Hsc70. One mechanism for specification of Hsc70 function is for a specialized Hsp40 to attract Hsc70 to function in a discrete cellular location. Studies in yeast identify a unique Hsp40 sub-type that is integrated into the ER membrane and exposes its J-domain to the cytosol (9). This sub-family is represented in yeast by HLJ1 (high copy lethal DnaJ 1) and deletion analysis suggests that HLJ1 functions with cytosolic Hsc70 in ER quality control (10). RMA1 is not expressed in yeast, so we pondered whether or not an HLJ1-like protein might act with RMA1 in human cells to assist in the selection of CFTR for degradation. Indeed, HLJ1-like Hsp40s are conserved in the human genome and this talk will describe the characterization of human DNAJB12 (JB12). JB12 is a Type II Hsp40 that contains a J-domain and G/F-like region and is similar to HLJ1 in that it is localized to the ER membrane and exposes its J-domain to the cytosol. Yet, JB12 differs from HLJ1 in that it contains N-and C-terminal extensions that were added during the course of evolution. Data presented will demonstrate that JB12 acts with Hsc70 and RMA1 to facilitate proteasomal degradation of CFTR and CFTR\u2206F508. JB12 forms complexes that contain RMA1 and Derlin-1 and increasing JB12 levels dramatically increases association of Hsc70 with ER localized forms of CFTR and RMA1. Depletion of endogenous JB12 results in a significant 3-fold increase in the folding efficiency of CFTR and permits a pool of CFTR\u2206F508 to escape the ER. JB12 appears to direct Hsc70 to function with the E3 RMA1 in degradation of nascent CFTR\u2206F508 and CFTR. Since fluctuations in its activity impact on the fate of nascent CFTR, JB12 is capable of exerting control over the folding efficiency of nascent CFTR and CFTR\u2206F508 and JB12. Inactivation of JB12 increases the potency of small molecule folding correctors and JB12 appears to be a therapeutic target for treatment of CF ",

            "text": "Nadia A. Ameen, MBBS Pediatrics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channels are in the apical domain of both crypt and villus enterocytes where they play a critical role in anion and fluid secretion. Genetic mutations that lead to absence of functional CFTR on the apical plasma membrane of enterocytes result in intestinal obstruction and cystic fibrosis. On the other hand, enterotoxins elaborated by Vibrio cholerae and Escherichia coli utilize CFTR as their apical exit pathway to elicit massive fluid secretion and secretory diarrhea following cAMP and cGMP signaling (1, 2) . In native epithelium and cultured polarized intestinal cells, both the number of CFTR channels and anion transport on the cell surface are regulated by protein kinase A, protein kinase Gphosphorylation and endocytic recycling and exocytosis of CFTR-containing vesicles by membrane trafficking (3,4) (Fig. 1) . But the mechanisms that control the intracellular trafficking itinerary of CFTR in intestinal cells are poorly understood. Polarized intestinal epithelial cells possess an apical brush border (BB) with tightly packed microvilli or membrane protrusions on their apical surface. Microvilli increase the apical surface area of enterocytes and are supported by bundled arrays of core actin filaments (~20) and cross-linking proteins that provide the structural support for each microvillus. The microvillus core rootlets descend into the apical cytoplasm of the enterocyte at the terminal web (TW), a region rich in cross-linking filaments composed of myosin and spectrin (5) (Fig.2) . Members of the unconventional myosin family of actin binding proteins are abundant in intestinal epithelial cells where they play major roles as cargo transporters and as mediators of membrane-cytoskeleton adhesion. The subcellular localization, known functions and diseases associated with intestinal myosins are listed in Table 1 . The distribution of CFTR along the microvillar membranes, in clathrincoated pits and vesicles, apical recycling and exocytic vesicles in the native enterocytes, suggest a role for myosins in regulating intracellular traffic (6) . Myosin 6 is the only myosin family member that has been shown to associate with CFTR in the intestine. This minus end directed motor is unique among actin-based motors because it moves away from the plasma membrane. In cultured cells, myosin 6 associates with clathrin coated pits and coated vesicles and interacts with clathrin, the endocytic adaptors AP-2 and the C terminus of disabled 2 (Dab2) to regulate clathrin-mediated endocytosis (7) . In the intestine, myosin 6 is present in both crypt and villus enterocytes and localizes to the lower third of microvilli, the terminal web and intermicrovillar domain, the sites of clathrin-coated pit formation and initiation of apical endocytosis. Absence of myosin 6 leads to decreased negative membrane tension in the enterocyte BB microvillus and intermicrovillar membrane in myosin 6 mutant mice (Myo6 sv/sv) (Fig. 2, 3) , markedly delayed apical endocytosis of CFTR, redistribution of the endocytic adaptor Dab2 in the terminal web region, and exaggerated fluid secretion following treatment with E. coli enterotoxin due to accumulation of CFTR on the surface of crypt and villus enterocytes in the small intestine (8, 9) . Myosin 6 was suggested as the candidate motor that would move CFTR down the microvillar membrane and sequester channels into clathrin coated pits for endocytosis, but its distribution in the enterocyte brush border does not support such a role. How CFTR migrates down the microvillus to the intermicrovillar membrane of enterocytes in preparation for endocytosis remains unknown. Myosin 6 distribution in the enterocyte BB contrasts to rat kidney proximal tubules, where it localizes along the entire length of microvilli, and plays a role in redistribution of NHE3 Na + /H + exchanger along the microvilli during acute hypertension (10) .",

In contrast to myosin 6 that is present in both crypt and villus enterocytes, Myo1a is essentially confined to the BB of mature villus enterocytes in small intestine where it bridges the actin core to the microvillar membrane (Fig.3) . Myosin 1a is in lipid rafts, binds to and plays a critical role in tethering and retention of the BB hydrolase sucrase isomaltase (SI) in the microvillar membrane (11) . Lack of this plus end motor in Myo1a KO mice leads to bnormalities in microvillar membrane tension, blebbing and abnormal membrane protrusion in BB of villus enterocytes in the small intestine (Fig.3) . Preliminary studies of CFTR localization and anion transport in Myo1a KO mice indicate that CFTR accumulates in the terminal web region, is absent from the BB and redistributes to the basolateral domains of villus enterocytes in the small intestine. Analysis of CFTR anion transport (Ussing chambers) in intestinal tissues from Myo1a KO mice reveal a marked (>50%) reduction in CFTR current (Isc) compared to WT controls but only in intestinal segments that possess villi. Ongoing studies will seek to determine the specific role that Myo1a plays in regulating CFTR localization and function in the enterocyte BB.",

The two most common types of internalization signals consist of a tyrosine-based signal (NPXY or YXX\u03a6) and a di-leucine-based signal (D/EXXXLL/I) where X is any amino acid and \u03a6 is a large hydrophobic residue. For the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), two such signals have been identified in the C-terminal tail, YDSI and DSIQKLL (2, 3) . There is evidence that the YDSI and DSIQKLL signals are recognized by the adaptor protein-2 (AP-2) complex at the cell surface (3) (4) (5) . Interestingly, both tyrosine-based and di-leucine-based signals have been shown to act as lysosomal targeting signals (6) . Furthermore, earlier studies indicate that ubiquitination can serve as an internalization signal as well as a signal for lysosomal targeting (6, 7), making it difficult to differentiate between internalization and lysosomal targeting signals.",

AP-2 provides two functions: (1) it recognizes and binds to the internalization signal; and (2) it binds to and promotes clathrin assembly. The beta-2 subunit binds to clathrin, the mu-2 binds to the internalization signal of the cell surface protein, and the alpha-2 subunit recruits accessory proteins that are important for coated-pit formation and scission (reviewed in (6)). For CFTR, there is evidence that the tyrosine-based signal interacts with AP-2. Weixel and Bradbury demonstrated that a photoactivatable peptide containing the YDSI sequence could be UV cross-linked to the 50 kDa mu-2 subunit of the AP-2 complex. Furthermore, they demonstrated that overexpression of a dominant negative mu-2 subunit inhibited CFTR internalization in HeLa cells (4) . More recent studies in HEK cells by Collaco and Ameen demonstrated that the alpha-2 subunit was important for CFTR internalization and importantly, GST pull-down assays indicated that the alpha-2 subunit is a binding partner for CFTR (5) . Although it is unclear if both subunits of the AP-2 complex interact directly with the cytoplasmic tail of CFTR, both studies support the idea that the AP-2 directly interacts with CFTR and this interaction is important for the clearance of CFTR from the cell surface.",

In that regard, we examined two different types of mutations in CFTR, one in which we ablated the tyrosinebased signal in CFTR, and another which included 2 nat-urally occurring CFTR mutations, R31L and R31C. In the first, we mutated the YDSI sequence to ADSA and found that CFTR internalization was reduced by more than 75%, yet this change had no effect on CFTR protein half-life (8) . In the second, we noticed that both R31 mutants appeared to create potential internalization signals, e.g., YRQR31 -> YRQC31 or YRQL31. Analysis of these CFTR mutants in endocytosis assays revealed that both mutants were internalized at double the rate of the wild type protein. More importantly, the mutations had no effect on the protein half-life (9) . And finally, studies by Bradbury demonstrated that another naturally occurring mutation, N287Y, generated a tyrosine-based signal in CFTR's cytoplasmic loop 2. The appearance of this second internalization signal almost doubled the rate of CFTR internalization and again, this mutation had no effect on CFTR half-life (10) . These studies indicated that CFTR mutations that introduced a tyrosine-based signal dramatically affected internalization, but had no effect on CFTR half-life, indicating that the two processes are not necessarily coupled.",

Swiatecka-Urban, Stanton and colleagues demonstrated that when CFTR was immunoprecipitated from polarized Calu-3 cells, a number of proteins were brought down in a complex that includes myosin VI, Dab2, and clathrin (11) . They also showed that myosin VI, a minus-end directed actin motor, was important for CFTR internalization by demonstrating that a dominant-negative form of myosin VI interfered with CFTR internalization in HEK293 cells. Further support for a myosin VI role in endocytosis came from studies by Ameen and Apodaca in intestinal cells from myosin VI-deficient mice (12) . Coimmunoprecipitation studies performed in polarized intestinal CaCo-2 cells illustrated that endogenous CFTR brought down a complex that included Dab2, alpha-AP-2, myosin VI, and clathrin (5). Furthermore, Collaco and Ameen demonstrated that in the intestine, CFTR interacts indirectly with Dab2 through the AP-2 complex (alpha-2 subunit) (5).",

There is a good evidence base to help with treatment decisions for chronic treatment, mostly aimed at improving FEV 1 and reducing pulmonary exacerbations (2) . However, the evidence base for many aspects of the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations is less extensive. The important issues of 1) when to treat; 2) which antibiotics and other therapies to use; 3) how long to treat; and 4) what to do at the end of a pulmonary exacerbation, are largely based on custom and practice.

Most CF guidelines recommend combining an antipseudomonal extended-action penicillin, cephalosporin, monobactam or carbapenem and aminoglycoside for the treatment of a pulmonary exacerbation (6) . The rationale for this combination is largely to prevent the development of resistance. Again, doses are usually higher than those normally used (6) . There is no good evidence that single agent therapy is better or worse than dual agent therapy but the resistance concerns remain with single agent therapy. The role of anti-microbial sensitivity testing to direct antibiotic choice is an area of some controversy. The accuracy of sensitivity testing has been questioned and in one study there was no impact on effectiveness of treatment whether antibiotics were used to which the P. aeruginosa was sensitive compared to resistant (8) . Synergy testing has been explored in multi-resistant P. aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia complex organisms but again appears to offer no advantage over an empirical decision (9) . However, recent work from our CF centre has suggested that failure to recover from a pulmonary exacerbation is more likely if the treatment is with antibiotics to which the patient's P. aeruginosa is not sensitive. Pragmatically, antibiotic sensitivity testing may be considered a guide to antibiotic choice but other considerations such as allergy to antibiotics, previous good response and patient preference should also be considered.",

Most of the improvement in FEV 1 and other metabolic and inflammatory markers improves after 7 days of IV antibiotics (10). This was confirmed in a large study of FEV 1 recovery which demonstrated almost all of the recovery was achieved within 14 days (11) . This is difficult to study as convention has been to treat for 14 days. However, this study suggests that it is reasonable in practice for IV antibiotic courses to be for 10-14 days depending on response. If there is full resolution of symptoms, inflammatory markers (white cell count and CRP) and full recovery of FEV 1 , then a 10-day course is a reasonable choice. For exacerbations which are not resolving there is very little data to help from studies for decision making. At some centres the IV course is continued for 3 or 4 weeks while an alternative approach is to change the IV combination for a further 2 weeks and monitor progress. Management of exacerbations should be complemented by increased airway clearance, consideration of nutritional loss, active management of blood glucose, and correction of hypoxia and hypercapnia, if required.

Treatment of pulmonary exacerbations remains a major part of cystic fibrosis care, yet is an area in which we do not have sufficient studies to allow us to optimise care. It is clear that exacerbations are associated with poorer outcomes and studies focused on how to maximise the treatment of exacerbations will be important. Beta-lactam antibiotics exhibit time-dependent bactericidal activity (1). More importantly, beta-lactam antibiotics exert maximum bactericidal activity when their concentrations are 3-4 times the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (1). In addition, beta-lactam concentrations must remain above the MIC for >70% of the dosing interval in order to achieve maximal bactericidal activity (2) . Vogelman et al. reported that the efficacy of ticarcillin against P. aeruginosa reached its maximal benefit as the time above MIC approached 100% (3). This is of particular concern because patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) exhibit increased renal clearance of beta-lactam antibiotics, such as ticarcillin, by as much as 30% compared to healthy volunteers (4). Our preliminary data demonstrated beta-lactam clearance in CF patients increases by as much as 23 to 56% during a 14-day hospital stay (5) . Intermittent administration of ticarcillin/clavulanate in patients with CF resulted in T>MIC against P. aeruginosa at a susceptible MIC of 64 \u00b5g/ml of merely 17% (in press). As a result, patients with CF require higher doses or more frequent administration of beta-lactam antibiotics (4).",

In patients with CF, Rappaz et al. reported that the ceftazidime concentrations delivered via CI exceeded an MIC of 4 \u00b5g/ml against P. aeruginosa 100% of the time (6). Hann et al. concluded that CI of cefepime in patients with CF effectively achieves and maintains concentrations above MIC and reduces the total daily dose by 20% (7). Kuti et al., demonstrated that meropenem delivered via CI was able to maintain serum concentrations >4 \u00b5g/ml for 100% of the dosing interval (8) . While there is sufficient evidence to conclude that CI is more effective at increasing T>MIC for any infecting organism, there is limited data regarding the efficacy of continuous versus intermittent delivery of beta-lactam antibiotics. In the largest published trial to date, Hubert et al. compared ceftazidime delivered via CI versus thrice daily infusion (9) . The authors concluded that the regimens were equivalent. However, the mean change in FEV1% predicted was significantly better in patients with resistant bacteria when ceftazidime was delivered via CI vs. intermittent infusion (p<0.05) (9) . Also, the mean difference in time to next intravenous antibiotic course was 0.4 months longer with continuous versus short infusion ceftazidime (p=0.04). Beta-lactam antibiotics delivered via CI are well tolerated. No difference in laboratory values (i.e. serum creatinine or liver function tests) was seen between ceftazidime delivered via CI versus intermittent infusion (6, 9, 10) .

As a result, the bacterial killing effect is correlated with peak serum concentrations. Maximal bactericidal activity has been demonstrated when the aminoglycoside peak serum concentration/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio is greater than 10 (13). Once-daily dosing can achieve higher peak serum concentrations and peak/MIC ratios and minimize the development of adaptive resistance (1, 14) . Once daily dosing of aminoglycosides may also reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity (15, 16) . This has led the CFF to recommend once-daily dosing of aminoglycosides to be the preferred method of administration in all CF patients with acute pulmonary disease (17) . However, limitations exist with the use of once-daily dosing of aminoglycosides in CF. The optimal peak serum concentration and peak/MIC ratios have not been established for acute exacerbations of CF (17) . The potential for nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and vestibular toxicity necessitate appropriate therapeutic drug level monitoring (15, 18) . Finally, data regarding efficacy of once versus twice/three times-daily dosing of aminoglycosides is limited. The largest study published to date regarding the optimal aminoglycoside dosing strategy in CF patients (pediatric and adult) was the TOPIC trial (16) .

Traditionally, admission to the hospital has been the preferred approach for the administration of IV antibiotics. However, advances in the percutaneuos placement of central venous catheters allow for the delivery of IV antibiotics in an outpatient setting. Systematic review suggests that the use of a longer central line may provide benefit over shorter IV catheters for antibiotic therapy (8) . Peripheral insertion of central catheters has gained widespread use throughout the world for the delivery of antibiotics to patients with CF. However, there are reports of venous thrombosis associated with the use of these catheters (9) (10) (11) (12) . Although totally implantable vascular access devices are frequently used in patients with CF there are no randomized studies about the value of these catheters (13) . However, their widespread use suggests that they are safe and effective (14, 15) . Factors that influence the decision to place an implantable catheter include: frequency of exacerbations, difficulty of placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter and patient preferences. Ultimately, the decision about the type of venous access used should be made on an individual patient basis.",

However, there is concern among many care providers that therapy delivered at home will not result in comparable outcomes to treatment in the hospital. It is important to remember that the delivery of antibiotics is only one component of the overall therapy of pulmonary exacerbations. Only one study has compared home and hospital treatment of pulmonary exacerbations in a prospective fashion (6, 16) . Wolter et al (17) found similar outcomes between those patients that completed most of their therapy at home compared to those that remained in the hospital for their entire treatment course. However, several retrospective studies have found that patients treated in a hospitalized setting do in fact have better outcomes (18, 19) . More recently, Collaco et al (3) examined the outcomes of 1,278 exacerbations experienced by 479 subjects in the US twin and sibling study. These authors found that the outcome of patients treated entirely in the hospital or entirely at home or in some combination of both locales had similar outcomes with respect to lung function and time to the next exacerbation. Studies have suggested that there can be benefits to different aspects of quality of life measures with either hospitalization or home therapy (17, 20) . Therefore, consideration of the differing burdens of hospitalization or home IV administration must be taken into account when making treatment decisions. The disruption of home and family life must be weighed against the certainty of increased airway clearance, appropriate rest and adherence to medication delivery schedules. For home IV therapy to be successful, the patient must have the time, resources and family support to administer the antibiotics and provide intensive airway clearance and inhalational therapy.",

            "text": "There are some drugs that should be avoided in pregnancy including aminoglycosides, tetracyclines and chloramphenicol. Aminoglycosides cross the placenta and there are case reports of fetal ototoxicity including deafness. Clinical stability is an important goal during pregnancy and inhaled tobramycin reduces the number of pulmonary exacerbations. Median levels of tobramycin one hour after receiving 300 mg of tobramycin solution for inhalation are 0.94 \u00b5g/ml (range of 0.18 -03.62) (9) . Serum levels after lower doses of inhaled tobramycin can be measured. Tetracyclines may be used to treat B cepacia complex. Tetracyclines cross the placenta and cause yellow or grey staining of deciduous teeth in children born to mothers who received tetracycline in the 2 nd and 3 rd trimester. No increased incidence of malformations was seen in 2 cohort studies of 274 infants whose mothers used tetracycline in the 1 st trimester (10, 11) . Tetracyclines deposit in the skeleton where they inhibit bone elongation and calcium uptake. This appears to be a temporary inhibition of bone growth. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may be used to treat Stenotrophomonas and B cepacia complex. Sulfonamides should not be used after 32 weeks of pregnancy as they displace bilirubin from binding to albumin and can cause kernicterus in the newborn. Trimethoprim should not be used in the first trimester as it is a folate antagonist and may result in increased risk of neural tube defects. Cartilage toxicity has been demonstrated in animal studies of quinolones. However, a controlled study prospectively enrolling and following 200 women exposed to fluoroquinolones during pregnancy did not show increased risk of major congenital malformations in the group exposured in the first trimester and no clinically significant musculoskeletal dysfunctions in the children (12) . A series of observational cohort studies suggest that azithromycin does not cause an increased risk of congenital abnormalities when used in pregnancy (10, 11, 13) . There is no data available on the use of aztreonam or meropenem in pregnancy. Cephalosporins and penicillins are generally considered safe in pregnancy. Another common challenge is in the CF patient with unusual or multiple bacteria present in sputum cultures. CF clinicians are just becoming familiar with treating Stenotrophomonas and Achromobacter, and now we have to decide if we should treat other gram negative bacteria such as Ralstonia, Pandoraea and Inquilinus (14) (15) (16) . These bacteria are closely related to Burkholderia species but it is not clear if they are pathogens although there are case reports of significant illness in CF patients infected with these bacteria (17) . In a similar way, we see nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) in combination with the usual CF pathogens and have to decide if they are bystanders or causing disease. One general approach is to treat the other bacterial pathogens and see if there is a clinical response. If no clinical response occurs, then determining persistence of the NTM with serial cultures and \"burden\" of infection with smears and using a combination of clinical symptoms and radiographic information (HRCT scan) may help with this decision. A trial of therapy, with frequent reevaluation, may be the best way of dealing with this uncertainty.",

Pulling together a case presentation with a literature review to present to your colleagues followed by a thoughtful discussion and involvement of other experts such as pharmacy is extremely helpful.

            "text": "It is generally accepted that cystic fibrosis (CF) does not impact cognitive function; however, this is substantiated primarily through clinical observations and there are few empirical studies to support this claim. It is important that the cognitive skills of individuals with CF are better understood on a population level, as even subtle deficits may impact disease management. Based on the similarities between CF and other disease groups, there is reason to believe that individuals with CF may be at-risk for attentional deficits or executive dysfunction (i.e., impairments in planning, organization, shifting, initiating, and emotional control). For example, individuals with sleep apnea, a disorder characterized by pauses in breathing or shallow breaths, are found to demonstrate executive dysfunction and behaviors consistent with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)(1). Of note, when sleep apnea is treated, these neurobehavioral deficits remit. Similarly, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) performed worse on tests of attention, executive function (EF) and processing speed compared to controls. The degree of impairment was predicted by low levels of forced expiratory volume (FEV) and forced vital capacity (FVC)(2,3). Using the negative cognitive effects of chronic or intermittent hypoxia demonstrated by patients with sleep apnea and COPD as a model, it is plausible that, due to compromised pulmonary functioning, individuals with CF may demonstrate a similar pattern of deficits. This may be especially true for pediatric patients, as oxygen deprivation could have more adverse consequences on the developing brain.",

Pulmonary exacerbations were found to negatively impact neurocognitive performance, as well as a driving simulation task.

            "text": "The value of understanding the cognitive skills, particularly in the domains of attention and EF, of individuals with CF is highlighted through intervention research. For example, in the context of an adherence intervention, it is possible that responders and nonresponders differ based on EF skills. An intervention that utilizes text messages to remind patients to take their medication may be successful for adolescents with executive dysfunction, as the text message directly targets their weakness (i.e., poor organization and planning). In contrast, this intervention may have no effect on adolescents with good EF, as the text message does not address the underlying reason for poor adherence (e.g., depressive symptoms). Thus, the success of an intervention may be influenced by the cognitive profile of the participants. It is important for researchers to be mindful of cognitive function as a potentially confounding factor when designing and implementing interventions. Clinically, it is essential for multidisciplinary CF team members to be aware of individual cognitive impairments. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR, ref 7), 3%-7% of school-age children are diagnosed with ADHD; therefore, it would be expected that a subset of children with CF also meet criteria for this diagnosis. In fact, a retrospective study by Georgiopoulos and Hua (8) determined that 9.6% of children and adolescents with CF, who were seen by the Massachusetts General Hospital CF Program, were referred to a psychiatrist and subsequently received a diagnosis of ADHD. The behavioral profile of ADHD, which includes symptoms of impulsivity, inattention, hyperactivity and executive dysfunction, has the potential to significantly complicate disease management if not properly treated. For example, an impulsive child may eat without taking enzymes or an adult with poor working memory skills may forget the order in which to complete his/her treatments. These instances of poor disease management are consistent with the Georgiopoulos and Hua study (8) , as many of the patients ultimately diagnosed with ADHD presented with poor treatment adherence.",

While ADHD is strongly familial (5), medical stressors such as intrauterine growth retardation (6) , perinatal hypoxia (7), and malnutrition (8) could encourage phenotypic expression in genetically predisposed patients. The risk of ADHD is higher in males with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (18.2%) and familial male precocious puberty (44.4%) (9) .

In a cohort of 188 pediatric CF outpatients, ADHD was diagnosed by a child psychiatrist in 9.6%; 59% had a family history of ADHD (14) . These data may underestimate the prevalence of ADHD in CF, as they exclude those declining evaluation or diagnosed elsewhere.

In our pediatric cohort (14) , ADHD medication treatment was attempted in 13 cases, achieving an improvement rating of much or very much improved in 8 cases. In 3 cases, the Best Regimen consisted of stimulant monotherapy (mixed amphetamine salts; methylphenidate); 2 consisted of non-stimulant monotherapy (atomoxetine; nortriptyline); 2 used a combination of 2 non-stimulants (atomoxetine or nortriptyline + guanfacine); and 1 used a stimulant plus a non-stimulant (buproprion XL+ Orosmethylphenidate). The decision about whether and how to treat ADHD in CF requires careful consideration of psychiatric and medical status. In our study, stimulants were more effective but more often associated with weight loss than non-stimulants. The 2 patients treated with nortriptyline demonstrated increases in BMI percentile (from 22% to 63% and from 34% to 60%) along with improvement in ADHD. Tricyclic antidepressants are considered third-line ADHD agents, after stimulants and FDA-approved nonstimulants. However, the risk/benefit ratio may differ in CF, where low weight and comorbid anxiety and depression are common. If stimulants are used, boosting caloric intake, adding cyproheptadine or other appetite stimulators and treating constipation may help maintain weight. Conclusion. ADHD is common and treatable in patients with CF. Oppositional behaviors, distractibility, forgetfulness or extreme motor activity interfering with CF care should trigger consideration of ADHD. Stimulants, nonstimulants and combination therapies are viable treatment options. Further research on the prevalence and treatment of ADHD in CF and its impact on medical adherence and outcomes is warranted.",

            "text": "Nonadherence with medical treatment regimens is prevalent in an estimated one out of two children with chronic medical illness. The model of adherence risks described by Ickovics and Meisler (1) provides a useful framework for the development of interventions to improve adherence to medical therapy in children with chronic illness. In this model five factors are considered, which include: 1) child's developmental stage; 2) disease symptoms; 3) complexity of treatment regimen; 4) child-parent relationship; and 5) clinical setting. Behaviorally-based interventions that address one or more of these factors are generally effective for increasing treatment regimen adherence for childhood illnesses (2) . The CF patient with ADHD may present a special challenge to health care providers in terms of nonadherence due to behavioral noncompliance, which is so often a feature of the disorder. CBT approaches focused on skills-based interventions to treat ADHD symptoms in adults have recently gained empirical support (3) . The aim of this talk will be to describe CBT interventions to promote medical adherence in children and adult CF patients with ADHD that can be delivered by a member of the multi-disciplinary health care team.",

Immunology, Univ. of Colorado Denver, Denver, CO, USA Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP regulated Clchannel (1, 2) . While CF is a multi-organ disease, the clinical course of affected individuals is dominated by recurrent respiratory tract infections leading eventually to respiratory failure (3, 4) . Although the life expectancy of affected individuals has increased remarkably in recent years, the vast majority of CF patients will die from pulmonary disease consequent to progressive inflammatory damage (4-6). One of the characteristic features of CF is persistent and neutrophil-predominant inflammation involving the lower respiratory tract, initially centered in the airways. In fact, pulmonary inflammation is observed very early in life, even in the absence of detectable infection, suggesting the possibility of a primary abnormality of regulation of inflammation (7) . Paradoxically, despite the presence of increased numbers of neutrophils, bacteria survive and often thrive in CF lungs, suggesting a defect in antimicrobial functions of phagocytes in the CF airway (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . Whether this reflects an intrinsic neutrophil defect or is a consequence of the abnormal milieu of the CF lung remains unre-solved (15) . We will review selected aspects of abnormal neutrophil function that have been reported and consider genetic versus inflammatory neutrophil reprogramming in CF.",

Indeed, there are reports of defects in CF neutrophils, including increased oxidant production (16) , decreased shedding of L-selectin (17), differential expression of TLRs (18) , and alterations in Clflux and intracellular pH regulation (19) that may hamper antimicrobial functions and predispose to inflammatory tissue injury. However, because expression of CFTR mRNA and protein is normally very low in professional phagocytes such as neutrophils and macrophages (20) , it is possible that these reported defects are secondary to extrinsic factors, such as abnormalities in the airway surface liquid (ASL) or to the systemic effects of pulmonary inflammation consequent to infection. However, some of these abnormalities in neutrophil function have been detected in asymptomatic CF carriers who have no apparent indication of systemic or pulmonary inflammation, compatible with the notion of an intrinsic phagocyte defect.",

Loss of CFTR function has a profound impact on host defense in the respiratory tract, resulting in chronic infection and inflammation. The sequence of events leading from loss of CFTR anion channel function to lung disease pathology is complex, likely multifactorial, and a subject of intense investigation. Thus, no single hypothesis or pathologic scheme may suffice to explain the progressive lung disease associated with CF. Here are briefly summarized some facets of the antimicrobial defenses of the airways and how they may be altered in CF and contribute to lung disease.",

In addition to these polypeptides, secreted lipids including cholesteryl esters contribute directly to broad spectrum antimicrobial activity (2, 3) . A lactoperoxidase based oxidative system also contributes to host defense through the production of the potent antimicrobial hypothiocyanite (4) (5) (6) . The combined effects of these molecules are to inactivate inhaled or aspirated microbes without stimulating inflammation. Their mechanisms of action are diverse and include nutrient sequestration, opsonization, cell signaling, surfactant/dispersant (7), bacteriocidal, and bacteriostatic activities. Synergy and additivity contribute to the success of this redundant system. In concert, this polyfunctional system is remarkably effective, yet in CF this arm of innate mucosal immunity breaks down.",

            "text": "Loss of CFTR function impairs airway antimicrobial defenses by several mechanisms. CFTR is an anion channel. In addition to playing an important role in regulating the airway surface liquid (ASL) volume and composition through Cltransport, CFTR also conducts other anions including HCO 3 -, SCN -, and glutathione. Therefore impaired CFTR channel activity can have several effects on the ASL environment. Impaired bicarbonate secretion may alter ASL pH (8) and characteristics of secreted mucins (9, 10) . The combined effect of subtle changes in ASL composition and volume create an unfavorable environment for antimicrobials. Furthermore, changes in mucin composition and viscosity (11) may further hamper their effects by altering mucin charge properties and by reducing mucociliary clearance. Secretion of antimicrobials by surface and submucosal gland epithelia is both constitutive and responsive to neurohumoral stimuli. CFTR-dependent secretion is defective in CF and therefore the net abundance of antimicrobials may be reduced (12, 13) . Early evidence in a porcine model indicates that tracheal submucosal gland tissue mass is reduced in CF, a finding that if confirmed in humans, may provide an additional anatomical contribution to the host defense defect early in life. Loss of CFTR may alter the transcriptional program of cells, resulting in changes in the abundant gene products that contribute to host defense. For example, Erzurum and coworkers noted a reduction in the functional expression of interferon inducible gene products in primary CF airway epithelia, perhaps contributing to a reduction in antiviral defenses (14, 15) . Such a change in antiviral immunity could also contribute to inflammation and secondary bacterial colonization (16) .",

In addition to the many direct links between loss of CFTR function and antimicrobial defenses, as the disease progresses and inflammation and infection persist additional secondary effects of disease further compromise airway innate immunity. A number of proteases including neutrophil elastase, cathepsins S and G, and bacterial products, can directly cleave host defense molecules and further reduce or destroy their activities. Chronic infection and inflammation also trigger extensive remodeling of the epithelium, changing the proportions of cell types present, causing goblet cell metaplasia, and further changing the secretory profile of the cells.",

Recently, new models of CF were developed using gene targeting in pigs (17) and ferrets (18, 19) . These new models reproduce several features of CF disease (18, 20, 21) . At birth, the airways of CFTR targeted pigs are free of inflammation but manifest a host defense defect without the secondary consequences of infection (17, 21) . Within the first months of life CF pigs spontaneously develop lung disease manifested by infection with bacteria, airway remodeling and mucus hypersecretion. Moreover, after intrapulmonary bacterial challenge with S. aureus, CF pigs fail to eradicate bacteria as effectively as wild-type pigs (17) . These results suggest that impaired bacterial elimination is the pathogenic event initiating a cascade of inflammation and pathology. CF pigs also exhibit altered tracheal cartilage and luminal narrowing at birth suggesting that the prenatal development of the lung may be perturbed (22) . Such anatomic abnormalities could further predispose to airway infection by influencing airflow and particle deposition patterns. Adult CF ferrets also develop a lung disease phenotype with similarities to human CF, including bacterial colonization (personal communication, John Engelhardt). Chronic lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic bronchitis (CB) and asthma are characterized by a hypersecretion of mucus, which often exacerbates morbidity and hastens mortality. A characteristic of these diseases is that they are often accompanied by mucus stasis and enhanced susceptibility to infection and inflamma-tion. The molecular basis for the optimum mucus properties that ensure effective flow remain unexplained.",

Our observations revealed that mucus is comprised of an array of biomolecules ranging in molecular weight from around 6kD to 100MD. These may be split into two distinct groups, the first and major group being globular type proteins of MW between 6kD to 200kD with a diverse array of proposed functions. The second group is the mucins, which are large space-filling glycoconjugates typically of MW 200kD to 100 MD, most of this mass being carbohydrate in origin. Our studies have yielded evidence that at least 30 of these proteins are involved in distinct, very high molecular weight, multiprotein complexes centered around the gel forming mucins MUC5B and MUC5AC. These complexes constitute a discrete secretory entity we call the \"mucin interactome.\" Based on these studies, we hypothesize that the key rheological functions of mucus do not emanate from the biophysical properties of the mucins themselves but from the dynamic interactions between mucins and globular proteins to form the functioning mucus gel.",

Proteomics analysis of these steps revealed that the gel forming mucins MUC5B and MUC5AC and membrane tethered mucins MUC1, 4 and 16 are predominant but associated with at least 30 other proteins. The number of the mucin interacting proteins identified was three times lower after using chaotropic agents and/or detergents, indicating that these complexes are affected by such agents. Our rheological experiments indicated an extreme effect of Triton and different dilutions of GuHCl on the reduction of viscosity and abolishing the network viscoelasticity. Our data revealed a number of protein candidates that resist dissociation from the mucin-interactome of HTBE secretions after such treatments such as LPLUNC1, glutathione S-trans, DMBT1, defensin alpha, surfactant-associated protein B, trefoil factor, complement C3, PLUNC, polymeric-IG receptor, gelsolin, WAP four-disulfide protein2. While the range of specific protein functionalities can be viewed as surprisingly large, e.g. antimicrobial, anti-protease, anti-oxidant and wound healing, we argue that they truly fall into just one general category, i.e., innate host defense. In other words, the mucus gel is part and parcel of innate immunity.",

On the other hand, just because protein components are attached to the mucins does not necessarily mean that they will modify the rheology in a significant way. In many instances, we might intuit that the mucins carry protective proteins that do not interfere directly in the mechanical properties of the mucus. Therefore, we surmise that the mucin interactome in the airways can be functionally separated into two main roles: 1. Mucin/mucus structure and organization: Interacting proteins may play a role in the mucin structure and organization for effective mucociliary clearance and increased stability of the barrier function. 2. Increased fracture rates in adults with CF are wellrecognized(1). Vertebral and rib fractures are particularly concerning in CF as these fractures can compromise pulmonary and nutritional status and impact quality of life. While reported fracture rates in children are not consistently increased(2-3), increased fracture risk in adults may find its roots in childhood. Thus, preserving bone health and identifying individuals with increased fracture risk are important elements in the care of children and adults with CF.",

Moreover, in CF, the relationship between DXA measures and fracture risk are not established although suspected. In considering DXA, a review of the International Society for Clinical Densitometry Position Statement is worthwhile (5) . In children, osteoporosis requires the presence of both low BMD-Z<-2 (low bone mineral content/density for chronologic age) and clinically significant fracture (vertebral, lower extremity long bone, or 2 upper extremity long bone fractures), as in premenopausal women and men<age 50y. For the child/adolescent with diseases that threaten skeletal and nutritional health, spine and whole body DXA is recommended and measures of lean body and fat mass should be considered. Assessing bone mineral content (BMC) relative to muscle mass (partly influenced by height) may improve our understanding of bone health (6) . Because bone size highly influences DXA, BMC/BMD should be adjusted for height or height age in children with short stature or delayed puberty.

Currently, conclusive evidence directly linking long-term bisphosphonate use to these fractures is lacking and insufficient to warrant discontinuing these drugs in osteoporotic patients (20) . However, individuals appear to derive diminished benefit from bisphosphonate use for more than 5 years (21) , and ongoing dialogue discussing risks and benefits of continued therapy is important.",

Fracture incidence and rates of kyphosis are higher than in the non-CF population and tend to occur at a younger age. The pathophysiology of bone disease in CF is multifactorial, and nutritional status alone may not correctly predict fracture risk. Low bone mineral density is correlated with severity of lung disease, yet it is not uncommon in adult CF patients with normal lung function. Peak bone mass is often not achieved in patients with CF, and this can be attributed to multiple factors, including nutrition. Moreover, studies show higher rates of bone loss in adults with CF as compared with age-matched controls. These observations combine to place individuals with CF at high risk for low bone mineral density.",

The CFTR basic defect in native human CF tissues manifests itself as absent or reduced function of the CFTR chloride channel. Modulation of ion transport is an attractive strategy for treatment of CF. The rationale is that modifying the ion transport properties of CF epithelial cells towards normal would be of clinical benefit. Having good pre-clinical bio-assays to prioritize ion channelmodulating CF drugs is important in streamlining the CF drug pipeline in selecting the very best drug candidates to move forward in clinical trials. At present the primary endpoint in pre-clinical evaluation of candidate drugs is electrophysiological responses in well-differentiated primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells from CF subjects. There are caveats in the use of this model, however, as e.g. it requires cell growth in culture for at least 3 weeks, where phenotype changes can occur and the model might not be representative of the in vivo condition. Moreover, prediction of clinical drug effect by in vitro data has been shown to be difficult for some CFTR modulating compounds in clinical trials.

ICM has been used for genotype-phenotype studies (1-3) and for difficult CF diagnosis (4-7). In recent years, it was further developed for preclinical drug development in CF. Similar studies can be performed with ex vivo native bronchial tissue from human lung explants (8) . There are at present no data from clinical trials on changes in ICM induced by disease modifying drugs, however substantial experience has been gained in preclinical human ex vivo corrector studies (9) . ICM may be useful in phase IIa and b clinical trials in adult CF patients, CF children and infants. Preliminary data on intra-individual variability confirm the promising role of ICM as outcome parameter in CF therapeutic studies (Derichs N, unpublished) , although more information on repeatability is needed. Another limitation of the ICM is the very low number of centers with expertise. In addition, the short viability of the rectal biopsies impairs transport to a central laboratory for analysis. ICM has at present most application in preclinical drug testing of potentiators and correctors, since the translation of these CFTR modulators from in vitro efficacy to in vivo clini-cal trials can be optimized by ex vivo incubation studies on native human tissues. Under appropriate incubation conditions intestinal biopsies will remain viable and functional for at least 24h, making the testing of slowacting CFTR correctors feasible (8) . In preclinical ICM corrector studies on F508del homozygous CF patients, defective CFTR-mediated chloride secretion could be corrected to levels of 25% of healthy control after 24 hour ex vivo incubation with corrector-29 (10).

Absent or defective CFTR results in abnormal ion transport in the airways, sinuses, sweat duct, gastrointestinal tract, hepatobiliary tract, and vas deferens. In the lung, mucus stasis ensues, resulting in chronic infection and end organ dysfunction, and is a common cause of morbidity and early mortality. Although there are over 1500 disease-causing mutations in CFTR, they can be categorized into several major classes based on the molecular pathogenesis induced by each mutation (1) . CFTR mutations can also be generally grouped by severity of the anion transport abnormality conferred by the mutation. While numerous factors alter the genotype-phenotype correlation in CF, including environmental factors and genetic modifiers to CFTR activity, the severity of the ion transport defect is also correlated with long-term outcome (2) . As such, measurement of CFTR activity in CF subjects can confer diagnostic and prognostic information, suggesting the importance of accurately measuring CFTR activity. As restoring CFTR function through small molecule pharmaceuticals is one therapeutic approach that has shown considerable promise for the treatment of CF (3), accurate and reproducible measurements of CFTR activity is also essential to evaluating the efficacy of these CFTR modulators in development.",

The technique is performed in vivo, and can also be used to evaluate proof-of-concept studies involving local (e.g., nasal) administration of biologic agents, including pharmaceuticals and gene therapy vectors. NPD has been sensitive to the detection of improved chloride transport induced by various CFTR modulators, including premature termination codon suppressors, CFTR potentiators, and gene therapy agents, and also has been sensitive to agents that inhibit ENaC activity (4) . Although the measurement requires specialized equipment and training to conduct appropriately, recent advances in methodology have improved the quality of tracings, provided a means for central interpretation and analysis, and greatly facilitated ease of use, providing a means to use NPD in clinical trials involving a large number of operators and participants (5) . The technique can also be adapted to measure CFTR activity in the lung, however potential difference measurements do require a greater number of subjects to demonstrate a detectable difference in CFTR activity compared to sweat chloride analysis, particularly when evaluating an agent with marginal activity. Similar to NPD, intestinal current measurements (ICM) provide a means to isolate sodium and chloride transport. An added utility of the measure is that it provides a means to test the activity of ion transport modulators ex vivo on full-thickness human tissues. Recent standardization of ICM measurement technique may provide a means to use the method in multicenter trials.",

Many inflammatory cells, mediators, and enzymes are involved in the complex pathophysiology of CF lung disease, so that there are many possible biomarkers to study and there is a high degree of redundancy (1, 2) .

The most common direct method is by performing bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or bronchial washing. Much of what has been learned about infection and inflammation in the CF lung has been through the use of BAL and much of the experience evaluating the \"biologic efficacy\" of therapeutics in CF has been through the use of BAL (reviewed in reference (2)). BAL offers the advantages of being able to be performed in any age group, and for its ability to sample the same area of the lung for studies that require repeat sampling (as is commonly done with intervention studies). Disadvantages include the need for an experienced team to perform the procedure, the need for sedation to perform the procedure, the inability to conveniently perform repeat sampling more than once or twice throughout an intervention study, and the high costs associated with performing the procedure. As a result of these drawbacks, investigators have relied on spontaneously expectorated sputum for many years, but this requires patients to have enough lung involvement and resultant respiratory secretions that allow regular sputum production. Thus, it is not very useful for examining inflammation in early lung disease, and in young children regardless of disease severity, since young children have difficulty expectorating sputum. To overcome the obstacle of obtaining sputum from subjects with milder lung disease, inducing a sputum specimen with hypertonic saline has been used to obtain lower airway secretions, and much effort has been expended in recent years in an attempt to validate the methodology of obtaining, processing, and assaying induced sputum (reviewed in detail in reference (2)). However, sputum induction is difficult to perform in patients age 8 years and younger, and multicenter studies have largely limited inclusion to those 10 years of age or greater. Additionally, biomarkers of inflammation in both induced and expectorated sputum show considerable variability, especially in comparison to BAL.",

LCI is more sensitive than FEV1 (4). LCI has been shown to be responsive to interventions such as treatment with intravenous antibiotics (5), hypertonic saline (6) and rhD-NAse (7) .

Several issues remain to be resolved: which MBW apparatus is best, which inert gas is most appropriate, are results obtained by different techniques comparable, what is the test repeatability, what constitutes a significant change. Preliminary data are promising: given the increased sensitivity of LCI and depending on the research question, power calculations come up with numbers around 50 children in each study arm (6) .

Therefore we should dare to think out of the box. Providing proof of efficacy in a Phase 3 trial in a small population is impossible.

Instead, less than 3 weeks after publication of the TIGER-1 paper, Inspire announced that the 466 patient, 48 week placebo-controlled TIGER-2 trial did not even come close to meeting any of its endpoints (2). Inspire stock tanked; the company lost $400m in one day (3) . It promptly shelved the program, restructured and laid off employees; by mid-May its remaining ophthamologic franchise was acquired by Merck (4). Inspire expired. What happened?",

Because it is hydrolyzed by endogenous nucleotidases at the epithelial surface and rapidly metabolized after IV infusion there is virtually no systemic exposure and thus little chance for systemic toxicity, as verified in preclinical animal toxicity studies and later in the clinical trials.

The results of TIGER-2 suggest that the preclinical assessment of denufosol's effect on CF respiratory epithelium, clear in so many excellent in vitro experiments, may be flawed. The key finding by researchers at UNC, after the clinical program was well under way, that rate of change-dependent shear stress releases endogenous luminal ATP, thereby activating the CACC to secrete chloride, opens the possibility that this channel may be more physiologically active in CF than previously anticipated, and thus less clinically augmented by pharmacologic stimulation (7) . Might exercise, airway clearance regimes or even activities of daily living already be doing the CFTR-bypass work it was supposed denufosol might be needed to accomplish? Now that the molecular identity of at least one CACC has been discovered as TMEM16A it may be possible to evaluate this with more precision (8) . The clinical effect of inhaled osmotic agents such as hypertonic saline and mannitol points to the viability of strategies to improve airway surface hydration. But the fate of other investigational drugs activating CACC and/or inhibiting ENaC may be affected by further research in this area.",

The first trials of denufosol showed single-dose tolerability at up to 200 mg in non-CF adult nonsmokers. In adult and pediatric CF patients Phase 1 highest tested dose was 60 mg as a single dose or in b.i.d. dosing for 5 days, and since this was well-tolerated this dose was carried forward (9) . Although there was somewhat more wheezing at 60 mg vs lower doses, could higher doses have been more effective with acceptable levels of intolerability? If acute increases in airway hydration were feared as potential cause of adverse events, strategies to deal with this via dose titration could have been tried. The only pharmacodynamic measure was change in expectorated sputum weight, but this is a fickle outcome that did not show clear dose-response, was only seen after single and not repeat doses, and seems an inappropriate biomarker given the decision to treat only patients with FEV1\u226575% predicted in Phase 3, as many patients with mild disease do not expectorate.",

            "text": "3. Phase 2. The Phase 2 program for denufosol incorporated several crucial junctures in regime and target population. In the first protocol 89 patients \u22658 years old with FEV1\u226575% were enrolled in a 28 day controlled trial in randomized parallel groups receiving 20, 40, 60 mg or placebo t.i.d. (10) . Patients taking inhaled antibiotics, hypertonic saline, or macrolides were excluded. Tolerability was good. With respect to efficacy, there was no dose-response in FEV1 change from baseline in actively treated patients. While the denufosol-treated pooled group change was significantly better than placebo, the effect in protocol completers was less than intentto-treat, and most importantly, the placebo group (n=21) experienced an unusually sharp decline in FEV1 (adjusted mean decline of 140 mL or ~2.5% over 28 days) and other lung function measures, changes ascribed to regression to the mean. In addition there were no differences in CFQ-R, HRCT scores, sputum weight, or exacerbations. Was the calculation that nominal doses \u226520 mg achieve initial airway surface concentrations exceeding maximally effective doses as calculated from nasal potential difference measurements, and thus predictive of no doseresponse over the trial dose range, correct (moreover, even if true, is initial concentration enough to count on)? Taken together, the results now seem suspect in indicating any efficacy, given the aberrant placebo decline in lung function, the questionable approach to pharmacodynamic dose-response, and the lack of concurrent changes in multiple clinically relevant outcome measures. Notably, the second Phase 2 trial enrolling 72 patients with FEV1 modified to 60-90% showed no efficacy and a smaller treatment effect in those with \u226575% FEV1 due to a more typical flat placebo response (11). 4. Phase 3. Based on Phase 2, TIGER-1 extended the approach of selecting patients with FEV1 \u226575% predicted, necessarily reducing magnitude of potential lung function treatment effect. TIGER-1 barely met its primary endpoint of a statistically significant treatment effect on FEV1 (L) at 24 weeks (45 mL, p=0.047). But ominous signs were many: the magnitude was small; the effect of growth on lung volume was not incorporated (nonsignificant trends were seen for FEV1 % predicted); no secondary endpoints (other spirometric measures, exacerbations, CFQ-R) were attained. The kinetics of response were puzzling for an active drug: both active and placebo FEV1 were down at 28 days and then rose slowly over time. On the other hand, post-hoc analyses of patients on minimal background therapy (0-2 drugs), of adolescents, and of FEV1 loss in patients with exacerbation appeared to suggest efficacy by showing trends to greater denufosol treatment effect than seen in the overall study population (1, 12, 13) . Based on TIGER-1 top line data, TIGER-2 was redesigned after launch to optimize chances for success by extending the placebo-controlled treatment period to 48 weeks, increasing sample size to boost power, and capping entry FEV1 at 110%. Despite all this, TIGER-2 results showed superimposable results for denufosol and placebo in all outcomes.",

Further results from the current, ambitious programmes of development of therapies which are aimed at treatment of the functional defect in CF are eagerly awaited. Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmemebrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene are the cause of cystic fibrosis (CF). The deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (F508del) is the most common CF mutation, and at least one copy is found in approximately 90% of CF patients. As such, rescue of the F508del CFTR mutation using small molecule approaches remains an important goal stimulating drug discovery and development. Success in this endeavor could have a considerable impact on CF outcomes. The F508del mutation primarily induces misfolding of CFTR, resulting in premature degradation of the protein prior to reaching the cell surface. The mutation also confers abnormalities in channel gating, thereby severely reducing ion transport activity even when the mutant protein resides at the cell surface. Knowledge of the molecular biology of the F508del defect suggests approaches to \"correct\" CFTR misprocessing may need to be combined with agents that \"potentiate\" CFTR gating to confer a meaningful clinical improvement (1) .",

VX-770 also demonstrated in vitro activity in a subset of HBE cells derived from F508del CFTR homozygous individuals, suggesting that VX-770 can potentiate a small pool of F508del at the cell surface resulting in approximately 15% of non-CF HBE CFTR activity, prior to correction of F508del processing. VX-770 has completed Phase 2 testing and progressed through Phase 3 testing for the treatment of CF in individuals with the G551D gating mutation (4). Prolonged (48 week) treatment of CF subjects with at least one copy of G551D CFTR exhibited marked improvement in pulmonary function, a reduced chance of experiencing a CF pulmonary exacerbation, and a ~45 mEq improvement in sweat chloride, in addition to demonstrating an acceptable safety profile. In contrast, treatment of F508del homozygous CF patients with VX-770 was safe, but resulted in a small change in sweat chloride (~3 mEq) and did not alter clinical outcome; VX-770 treatment improved sweat chloride by > 10 mEq in only a small subset (~15%) of F508del homozygous individuals. These results suggest that while demonstrating detectable bioactivity in some individuals, treatment with VX-770 alone is not sufficient as a single therapy in F508del homozygous subjects, and indicate the importance of correcting F508del processing in combination with a CFTR potentiator as also suggested by in vitro studies.",

The lead corrector candidate in the Vertex program is the investigational agent VX-809, and in F508del homozygous HBE cells, VX-809 restored CFTR activity to~16% of non-CF HBE in vitro and was accompanied by improved band B to C formation, indicating the increased presence of CFTR residing at the cell-surface. In CF patients homozygous for F508del, sweat chloride improved 8 mEq over placebo (7 mEq overall) at the highest dose tested (200 mg daily) and demonstrated a reasonable safety profile. Unfortunately, 4 weeks of VX-809 monotherapy was not associated with a detectable clinical improvement in spirometry, suggesting bioactivity of VX-809 is not sufficient to improve clinical outcomes when used alone. When VX-770 is added to VX-809 in vitro, anion transport activity doubles in F508del HBE cells, suggesting an additive effect when a potentiator is combined with a CFTR corrector. Interim results of the first CF clinical trial assessing the benefit of a corrector and potentiator in combination were recently reported. In this trial, two weeks of 200 mg VX-809 treatment was followed by the addition 150 mg or 250 mg of VX-770 twice daily for 7 days. Results demonstrated VX-770 further decreased sweat chloride compared to VX-809 alone (by 9 mEq above VX-809 treatment alone at the VX-770 250 mg dose group and 13 mEq (total change) following the combination of VX-809 and VX-770). These findings demonstrate the proof of concept that significant improvements in sweat chloride are possible upon combined treatment of F508del homozygous individuals with a CFTR potentiator and a CFTR corrector. Based on genotype-phenotype correlations in the disease, 13 mEq may be sufficient to confer improved clinical outcomes (8) . Further testing of combination strategies involving CFTR correctors and potentiators are warranted in CF, and may confer clinical improvement upon long-term testing in the most common mutation found in CF patients.",

            "text": "In the late 1970s, intravenous (IV) aminoglycosides, and particularly tobramycin, became an important part of the regimen for the management of CF pulmonary exacerbations. Aminoglycosides had much broader therapeutic indices than the polymyxins, while retaining excellent antipseudomonal activities. While studying the pharmacokinetics of IV tobramycin, we observed that tobramycin clearance in persons with CF was increased compared to healthy volunteers (1). Although aminoglycosides were known to be cleared from the systemic circulation in the urine, the glomerular filtration rate in persons with CF dramatically underpredicted their rate of aminoglycoside elimination (1). We speculated that the increased non-renal systemic clearance could be due to expectoration of the antibiotic in sputum. In order to improve aminoglycoside quantitation over the existing bioassay in complex matrices, such as sputum, we had developed radio-enzymatic assays (2) and were surprised to learn that levels of tobramycin in CF sputum during IV treatment were almost 10 times higher when assessed by RAE than by bioassay (3). Our observations suggested that clearance of (bound and inhibited) tobramycin by sputum expectoration could account for the accelerated tobramycin clearance in persons with CF (4). In addition, we were able to determine that sputum inhibition of tobramycin activity was saturable (suggestive of adsorptive bind-ing) and could be overwhelmed by addition of significantly higher levels of tobramycin. Our observation that CF sputum had a saturable inhibitory effect on tobramycin suggested that topical administration of high quantities of tobramycin by aerosol could overcome sputum inhibition, produce an active unbound fraction and result in improved tobramycin efficacy. Initially, our intention was to explore this treatment modality as a therapy to treat patients experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation.",

In order to better characterize any potential safety associated with prolonged administration, we completed an open-label, single arm 3-month study of inhaled tobramycin in 22 subjects (8) . This was primarily a safety study to assess the effects of prolonged aerosol antibiotic administration on renal and 8th cranial nerve function; we meticulously tracked high-frequency audiometry, vestibular function, glomerular filtration rates and proximal renal tubular function in these subjects (8) . There were no significant safety concerns with the treatment, and we observed that mean pulmonary function (assessed as the forced expiratory volume in 1 second; FEV1) increased during the first 4 weeks of treatment but then appeared to level off and even decrease during the following 2 months of treatment. In addition, nearly three quarters of patients had at least one P. aeruginosa isolate with an MIC above the tobramycin parenteral breakpoint at the end of 3 months of treatment (8) . When respiratory secretions were assessed a month after cessation of treatment, the prevalence of tobramycin-resistant isolates had decreased dramatically (as had FEV1). This \"reversion\" of resistance phenotype in CF P. aeruginosa clinical isolates after removal of antibiotic pressure had been previously observed in studies of aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams (9) (10) (11) , and was interpreted to mean that antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa could be \"transient,\" and reversible.",

This study confirmed a statistically significant improvement in FEV1 associated with tobramycin inhalation that (again) was not observed to increase beyond 4 weeks of treatment, and again showed no evidence of renal damage or neurotoxicity. In addition, although the protocol called for administration of inhaled tobramycin tid, review of adherence records and patient reporting indicated that less than 50% of midday doses had been administered during the study, suggesting that a) the observed benefits of inhaled tobramycin were likely to be retained with a bid dosing schedule and b) a tid dosing schedule was probably unrealistic given the delivery system being employed. By today's standards, it is understandable why the delivery system in use was problematic with respect to adherence: in order to receive a dose, a patient/parent had to dissolve 1.2 g of tobramycin sulfate in 30 mL saline, transfer 15 mL to an Ultraneb 100/99 ultrasonic nebulizer, add another 15 mL of saline, turn on the aerosol generator and let it run for 2 minutes to assure linear output, and then take 200 breaths (12) .

Patients renege on significant parts of treatment regimens, in particular chest physiotherapy and aerosolised antibiotic protocols because these are time consuming and without immediate gratification. We have shown a median adherence of 36%, measured by nebuliser download (6) . Rather than argue that an on/off regimen will increase adherence, (hypothetical, not evidence-based), we should argue that with such a protocol and known adherence patterns patients are likely to be in receipt of their prescribed aerosolised antibiotic for less than 2 out of every 8 weeks. Positive results seen during clinical trials probably reflect the stimulus effect of taking part in the study and bias possibly introduced by the patients agreeing to enrol being those most motivated to take their treatment. Even so every study of on/off treatment shows a fall towards baseline values in the \"off\" month. How much more pronounced will this be in the reality non-clinical trial situation of poor adherence? In practice patients probably achieve the equivalent of an on/off regimen when prescribed continuous treatment! What is the likelihood of drug toxicity? There are no data for long term continuous use of inhaled TSI or aztreonam (AZLI) but safety data available are reassuring.

However, this \"benefit\" of inhaled antibiotic rotation (extending the effective life of each chronic inhaled antibiotic) would presumably play out over the course of years or even decades of a patient's life, and is unlikely to be captured by the endpoints we are considering in relatively short (6-12 month) controlled studies.",

Although FDA approval will have required demonstration of efficacy of an inhaled antibiotic compared to a placebo, and there will be some head-to-head data available as well, what clinicians will really need is some indication as to whether management of our patients will benefit from using these drugs in some sort of combination, as opposed to as single agents. One can propose a number of approaches for combining different inhaled antibiotics into a single management plan (Table) . Presumably, some approaches are more justifiable from a mechanistic standpoint than others. Similarly, some are likely to be more feasible from a treatment burden, adherence, and/or cost perspective. How will we go about identifying those approaches that are the most likely to provide improved outcomes for the population?",

As a result of recent data suggesting efficacy for treatments attacking basic defects in mutant CFTR function, optimism for finding a cure for cystic fibrosis is at its highest level since the identification of the CFTR gene (and its accompanying promise of gene therapy). However, patients and families still live with the reality of a disease that continues to impose the need for choice from among a wide range of palliative and aggressive treatments as the illness progresses and premature death approaches. Careful integration of end of life discussions, with goals appropriate to the current condition and disease trajectory of individual patients, can help patients and families navigate these choices deliberately, with confidence, and with hope toward the best possible outcomes.",

Traditionally, care teams have adopted strategies that have been successful in helping patients and families to accept aggressive and intensive monitoring and intervention as necessary parts of their lives. Enthusiastic and encouraging emphasis on the benefits to be achieved, and reinforcement of behavior on the part of families that reflects the same enthusiastic optimism is an important part of this approach. Though this approach has been important in translating the introduction of new therapies into better FEV1s, higher BMIs and longer lives, it can also send the unwanted message that fears regarding premature death and progressive illness themselves endanger the best outcomes, and are not appropriate topics to bring up with the team. Conversely, inviting such discussions can be seen by the care team and family as \"taking away hope,\" depriving patients and those caring for them of powerful tools that can address directly such fears and, in many cases, allay them.",

Of equal importance are concerns of children and their families regarding how the threat of shortened life span may affect quality of life, adherence to treatment and normal development in patients who are far from respiratory failure or decisions regarding transplant. The multidisciplinary team has become the cornerstone in the delivery of cystic fibrosis (CF) care and is well understood by team members, patients, and caregivers. Multidisciplinary team members contribute to the high quality of care that has come to be expected in Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Accredited Care Centers and are essential in the care of the CF patient at end of life. Unfortunately, not all members of the multidisciplinary team fully understand their roles and responsibilities in end of life or palliative care of CF patients. To better assess team members' understanding of roles and educational exposure in caring for CF patients at end of life a survey was developed and distributed via the established list serv's within the CF community. The survey was distributed to 244 nurses, 421 dietitians, 423 social workers and 192 respiratory therapists. Responses were received from 45 (18%) nurses, 102 (24%) dietitians, 57 (13%) social workers, and 51 (27%) respiratory therapists. The results of the survey indicate that although the majority of respondents have 15 or more years of experience within their discipline, most have been working with CF patients for 5 years or less. The majority of respondents or 44% reported they \"somewhat understand\" their role in caring for CF patients at the end of life, with social workers feeling most confident in their role and dietitians feeling least confident. All disciplines expressed the need for additional education related to advanced care planning and care of the CF patient at end of life. This information is presented in an initial effort to assist multidisciplinary team members to recognize and understand their respective roles in end of life care of patients with CF and will examine the roles of the nurse, social worker, respiratory therapist, and dietitian.",

Regardless of the setting the CF nurse works, similar principles should be used in providing end of life care. Four guidelines that can be used by the CF nurse in the care of the patient at the end of life and in advanced care planning are 1) providing the patient and family with support at the end of life or in advanced care planning; 2) supporting informed discussions about care goals and treatment options; 3) assisting the patient by facilitating the implementation of the patient's wishes regarding end of life care; and 4) knowing and understanding current legal issues surrounding end of life care and advanced care planning (1). The CF nurse may also need to assure that the patient and family are comfortable with decisions that have been made, and if not, may need to refer them to appropriate sources such as the palliative care team, social work, or psychology as appropriate. As is true in virtually all aspects of nursing, often the nurse spends the most time with the patient and family. This places the nurse in a position to identify needs of the patient and family and to address these needs or communicate them to the appropriate team members. It is through these roles, along with effective communication skills that the CF nurse is able to provide effective care at end of life.",

However, the unique, often long-term relationship of the CF social worker with the CF patient may provide a strong foundation of support to the patient and family in dealing with sensitive end of life issues. According to the National Association of Social Workers Standards for social work practice in palliative care and end of life, there are several standards that social workers can use to help them work more effectively in end of life settings. Some of those standards include 1) Ethics and Values; 2) Knowledge; 3) Assessment; 4) Intervention/Treatment Planning; 5) Attitude/Self-Awareness; 6) Empowerment and Advocacy; 7) Interdisciplinary Teamwork; and 8) Cultural Competence (2) .

Respiratory therapists may be asked to deliver hands-on chest physiotherapy toward end of life due to increased effectiveness or additional contact provided by the respiratory therapist (3). The respiratory therapist often spends a significant amount of time at the bedside for delivery of nebulized medications and airway clearance therapy and often develops close relationships with patients and families.

Improved survival attributed to this model of care led to its widespread adoption in cities across North America. Accreditation of care centers by the US CFF promoted the model as the standard of care for cystic fibrosis. As the CF population aged, the model was adopted by centers caring for adults, with some important modifications. Monitoring of local outcome data was made routine with the widespread adoption of the CFF Clinical Registry, and was later expanded by the CFF using well-known quality improvement methods. Details of the CF care model are now routinely cited as examples of efficient and effective care that could be applied to other clinical conditions.",

Drawing on a shift in American popular concern about the \"medicalization\" of dying, and utilizing clinical models developed in the UK and elsewhere, a system of care for those with terminal illness slowly gained strength in the U.S. and Canada. Initially based outside hospitals and using the principles of hospice, this shift in clinical care for the dying gained strength in the 1990s as both clinicians and patients began to recognize the need for better symptom control in life-limiting illness. The increasing use of supportive technologies, including those formerly limited to intensive care units, and the development of new therapies with both high risk and great potential for benefit meant that a greater proportion of deaths in the US occurred after an aggressive but ultimately futile intervention. The palliative care model, distinct in both location and principles from the hospice model, began to emerge in clinical centers across the continent. This model developed unevenly in pediatrics, but grew rapidly in adult medicine. The palliative care model emphasized control of symptoms (even if the cause of the symptoms could not be eliminated), management of both treatment and disease side effects, shared decision-making with patients and families, recognition of the social and spiritual aspects of life-limiting illness (which many perceived to be lost in an increasingly bureaucratized and depersonalized death), and above all, effective communication with patients and families about prognosis and treatment options.",

We may minimize side effects, ignore (or more often, fail to ask about) symptoms we have no easy answer for, and we may be reluctant to discuss declining quality of life or eventual death. We are not unique among clinicians in this regard, but the dramatic advances made in CF, as well as the increasingly available possibility of rescue by lung transplant, may make us particularly reluctant to utilize effective palliative care approaches which could increase quality of life. This difficulty can be amplified by our long-standing and close relationship with many patients and families, as we may avoid discussion of any distressing aspects of life with CF with those to whom we have become so close. 4 . Shift in age at death.

NIPPV is indicated for patients with chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, and is particularly valuable as a bridge to transplantation in those cystic fibrosis patients already listed. Its use may provide valuable respiratory muscle rest, allowing patients to maintain ambulation and fitness critically important to successful transplant outcomes. Endotracheal intubation and positive pressure ventilation may keep the already listed patient alive until transplant, but the presence of an artificial airway that needs to be secured substantially limits activity and compromises overall conditioning. The presence of an endotracheal tube severely limits the patient's ability to communicate with family members and staff, critically important in assessing patient comfort needs at the end of life. The use of either of these modes of mechanical ventilatory support in the end-stage cystic fibrosis patient not listed for lung transplantation is of questionable value. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease, caused by mutations such as [\u2206F508] in the CFTR gene, which prevent trafficking of the CFTR protein to the apical surface of lung epithelial cells. One important consequence is inability to activate the cAMP-activated chloride channel activity, which is intrinsic to CFTR. However, another consequence is the genesis of a profoundly hyper-proinflammatory phenotype in the airway, principally manifested by high levels of IL-8 and certain other potent cytokines and chemokines. A frequent cause for debate is whether the pathophysiology of the CF airway is due to persistent infection, or due to intrinsic inflammation, or due to a mixture of both? Furthermore, because of operational defects in the innate immune system in the lung, it is possible that inflammation in the CF airway is potentiated by CFTR-dependent defects in immune cells, including neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes.",

With respect to potential intrinsic connections between mutations in CFTR and production of IL-8 protein, the IL-8 mRNA in CF lung epithelial cells has been recently shown to be greatly stabilized relative to IL-8 mRNA in control cells (4) . In this case, the mechanism involves low levels of the ARE-binding protein tristetraprolin (TTP), which regulates mRNA stability by interacting directly with ARE domains in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the IL-8 mRNA. In addition, MAPKinases have direct control over IL-8 mRNA as well (5) . We have also investigated the relationship between the presence of mutant CFTR and disease-specific microRNAs (6, 7) . The microRNA miR155 was most elevated in CF cells, where it serves to activate signaling from PI3K to AKT.

Airway infection and inflammation are virtually universal in CF patients (regardless of the order in which they develop) and reducing inflammation is likely to improve CF lung disease. We must now identify the molecular pathways that can be targeted to safely and effectively reduce lungdamaging inflammation in CF. Background. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen and a leading cause of nosocomial infections, especially in a setting of epithelial cell injury and in immunocompromised patients, including cystic fibrosis (CF) patients (1) . Mutations in CFTR reduce or eliminate chloride secretion in the lung and thereby reduce the volume of airway surface liquid, which in turn suppresses mucociliary clearance of P. aeruginosa and other pathogens trapped in the mucus (2, 3) . Accordingly, individuals with CF are susceptible to chronic infections, primarily by the opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa. Over time the CF lung evolves into a highly inflamed and purulent environment that is the proximate cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. By late adolescence, 80% of CF patients are chronically infected with P. aeruginosa, the dominant pathogen in CF airways (4) (5) (6) . As is the case with CF, patients with COPD and bronchiectasis are particularly susceptible to bacterial infection, including colonization by P. aeruginosa, which is particularly difficult to eradicate due to the high basal levels of antibiotic resistance and the ability of P. aeruginosa to form antimicrobial resistant biofilms (3, (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) .",

Patients with chronic P. aeruginosa colonization often acquire respiratory virus infections, which may trigger acute exacerbations. Synergism between bacteria and viruses in inducing infection in the airway is welldocumented (12, 13) . CF patients show reduced ability to clear P. aeruginosa acquired during respiratory viral infections compared to healthy controls, often requiring anti-pseudomonal treatment (14) . Furthermore, 85% of new pseudomonal colonization of CF patients followed a viral upper respiratory tract infection within 3 weeks (15) . Most studies to date characterize an infection where the virus predisposes patients for a secondary bacterial infection, but scientists and clinicians now recognize that the synergism is not unidirectional (16, 17) . In fact, intrapulmonary influenza titers are also elevated in mice with chronic P. aeruginosa infection compared to P. aeruginosa free mice (18) . And although the prevalence of viral disease is similar in CF and healthy controls, CF patients with viral lung infections have prolonged and exacerbated symptoms and longer hospitalizations (12, 19) . The abundance of literature documenting respiratory viral and bacterial, often P. aeruginosa in CF, dual infections have not established a mechanism of how these polymicrobial infections arise or how they are maintained during the course of the ensuing respiratory disease. Our long-term goal is to define a mechanism for the prolonged and exacerbated viral infections observed in the clinic in CF patients chronically colonized by P. aeruginosa.",

            "text": "Results. We previously reported that a secreted toxin from P. aeruginosa, Cif (PA2934), reduces CFTR-mediated chloride secretion by human airway epithelial cells by enhancing the amount of ubiquitinated CFTR and its degradation via the lysosomal pathway (20) (21) (22) . The aim of the current study was to determine if Cif regulates other ABC transporters, specifically the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) to alter viral antigen presentation. Patients with TAP deficiency, like CF patients, have recurrent bacterial infections, nasal polyps, and chronic purulent rhinitis in the first 6 years of life, and chronic bacterial infections, bacterial pneumonia, and bronchiectasis later in life. Thus, we hypothesized that Cif facilitates the degradation of the TAP complex, resulting in reduced viral antigen presentation via the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and therefore, diminishes the immune response to viral pathogens. P. aeruginosa toxin Cif reduced TAP1, but not TAP2, protein abundance in polarized human airway epithelial cells (CFBE41o-cells) in a time-dependent manner. The Cif-mediated reduction in TAP1 was more dramatic in CF airway cells (CFBE41o-), as compared to WT-CFTR complemented CFBE41o-cells. Cif inhibited ubiquitin specific protease 10 (USP10), a deubiquitinating enzyme, resulting in increased poly-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of TAP1. The inhibition of USP10 activity by Cif was more profound in CF cells (CFBE41o-), as compared to WT-CFTR complemented CFBE41o-cells. USP10 deubiquitinating activity is regulated by protein-protein interactions with G3BP1 (Ras-GAP SH3 domain binding protein), where interaction of the N-terminus of USP10 with G3BP1 inactivates USP10 DUB activity (23) . Cif does not alter the protein abundance of USP10, but does enhance the interaction between G3BP1 and USP10 to inhibit USP10 DUB activity. In CF airway cells, G3BP1 protein abundance is increased, leading to a reduced basal level of USP10 activity and thus, greater susceptibility to the Cif toxin. Functionally, the Cif-mediated decrease in TAP1 expression reduced peptide uptake into the endoplasmic reticulum and decreased MHC class I molecule abundance at the plasma membrane, effects that were enhanced in CF cells compared to WT-CFTR complemented CF cells. Furthermore, Cif decreased MHC class I presentation of viral antigen and eliminated CD8 T cell recognition of influenza Ainfected cells.",

We propose that P. aeruginosa, by secreting the Cif toxin, inhibits the ability of CD8 T cells to recognize and eliminate viral infections, severely compromising the immune defenses in the lungs of CF patients. This is the first bacterial toxin that inhibits the viral immune response of the host, potentially illuminating a mechanism for the clinical observation that viral-bacterial co-infections dramatically increase the morbidity and mortality of CF patients chronically colonized by P. aeruginosa. This study also identifies a new therapeutic target for preventing co-infections in the CF airway. Defective cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function is responsible for cystic fibro-sis (CF) lung disease, the most life-threatening complication of CF. Lung function declines and fails as a con-sequence of airway inflammation, chronic bacterial infections and progressive tissue destruction. Given the critical role of lung inflammation in the pathogenesis of CF lung disease, a better understanding of the relationship between infections and inflammation is critical for the development of novel therapies targeting inflammation. An important question within this relationship has been whether inflammation or infection comes first.",

This is accomplished via an intricate network of signaling pathways, both within and between cells. Activation of this network occurs via pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), so-called because they recognize molecular patterns from bacteria, viruses and certain selfderived molecules. The two best-characterized families of PRRs are the Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) and the NODlike Receptors (NLRs). A convergence point of host defense mechanisms against bacterial pathogens activated by many PRRs is the p38\u03b1 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) (4). Interestingly, nematodes deficient for pmk-1, a p38 MAPK ortholog, are susceptible to bacterial killing by P. aeruginosa (5) .

Five genome-wide significant SNPs (p<5x10 -8 ) were identified in two genomic regions that include the genes SLC26A9 (min p =9.88x10 -9 ) on chromosome 1 and SLC6A14 (min p=1.28x10 -12 ) on chromosome X; neither of which had been previously identified in other MI modifier studies.

In all these organs, the single cell epithelial layer is unique in that it forms a highly selective and tight barrier between body organ and ductal interfaces. Epithelial \"function\" is achieved by cell polarization whereby many determinants and regulators of fluid, solute and ion transport, including the CFTR ion channel reside specifically at the apical membrane, with contributing features from basal and lateral surfaces.

Much of our current understanding of CF pathogenesis in the intestine is a result of studies using genetically modified mouse models of CF. Use of transgenic mice has contributed greatly to our understanding of normal electrolyte transport mechanisms in the intestine including the roles of CFTR (1). The major phenotype of CF mice is the lethal obstruction of the distal small intestine. There are over a dozen strains of CF mice, including total knockout of the Cftr gene as well as those with specific mutations in CFTR known to cause disease in humans (2) . Comparison of these different CF strains reveals 10-15% of normal CFTR function is sufficient to avoid intestinal obstruction which has important implications for therapies in development such as CFTR small molecule correctors. The most severely affected mouse strain is a conventional knockout which totally lacks Cftr mRNA and protein expression (3) . Half of such CF mice die before weaning and most of the survivors die shortly after weaning as they begin to consume solid food. Post-weaning intestinal obstruction can be prevented by feeding the mice a liquid diet (4) or giving them an osmotic laxative solution to drink (5) .",

One goal is to discover how to improve intestinal function in CF which is expected to further contribute to greater longevity and quality of life. Also, as the pathogenesis of CF intestinal disease has many similarities with CF airway disease, novel therapeutic approaches that benefit the intestine may lead to analogous airway therapies. Because of the central role the normal gut microbiota has for systemic immune system development and function, there is also a real potential that therapies that improve intestinal function in CF may have broader benefits such as reducing the hyperresponsive airway immune responses characteristic of this disease. increased mucus release in the presence of HCO 3 may be due simply to a HCO 3 dependent fluid lavage effect. To determine whether decreased mucus release in the absence of HCO 3 is due to decreased HCO 3 --dependent fluid secretion, we compared fluid secretion rates from closed intestinal sacs with and without HCO 3 in the bath solutions. Increases and decreases in weight were interpreted as fluid secretion and absorption, respectively. 5-HT or PGE2 markedly increased fluid secretion, which was completely blocked by bumetanide (a Na + -K + -2Clcontransporter inhibitor). Removing HCO 3 from the bath had no detectable effect on basal or stimulated fluid secretion. Likewise, DIDS did not reduce fluid secretion. These findings indicate that the HCO 3 -dependent increase in stimulated mucus release is unlikely due to HCO 3 dependent fluid secretion and lavage effect (7).",

Equal moles of NaCl and NaHCO 3 were added to each aliquot, respectively. HCO 3 decreased both the pH and [Ca 2+ ] dramatically. Subsequently, each mucus solution was filtered through an Immobilon-P membrane. The weight of mucus retained on the filter membrane from the mucus solution treated with NaCl was significantly higher than that treated with NaHCO 3 , indicating that HCO 3 reduced the size of mucus aggregates in solution. Furthermore, to better define the role of pH and [Ca 2+ ] in HCO 3 --induced mucus disaggregation, we replaced the Ca 2+ with NaOH equimolar for OHin the initial mucus solution, and then treated aliquots of the resulting NaOH mucus solution with equimolar NaCl or NaHCO 3 . The pH of the mucus solution treated with NaHCO 3 decreased significantly, but the amount of mucus retained on the filter membrane was the same for mucus solutions with NaCl or with NaHCO 3 . In this experiment, the initial pH of the aliquots of NaOH mucus solutions were similar to the mucus solutions with Ca(OH) 2 , but differed in the concentration of [Ca 2+ ].

            "text": "Meconium ileus (MI) is an acute condition of newborn infants due to dehydrated thickened meconium that causes mechanical obstruction in the distal ileum along with failure to pass meconium within the first 24-48 hours after birth. Approximately 20% of infants with CF present with meconium ileus at birth. MI is very suggestive of CF, yet up to half of infants presenting with MI do not carry a diagnosis of CF (6) . Non-CF diseases associated with abnormal gut motility, such as Hirschsprung disease and chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, have been associated with MI-like disease, suggesting that decreased peristalsis may allow for increased resorption of water, thus favoring the development of MI. Mouse models of CF have shown that severe neonatal bowel obstruction can occur despite normal pancreatic function. These models also highlight that defective HCO 3 excretion leads to an acidic and dehydrated luminal environment. Lack of HCO 3 likely leads to compacted, dehydrated mucus that contributes to MI. Abnormal intestinal motility may also contribute to the development of MI. Furthermore, there is growing evidence for multiple loci modifier gene involvement in the pathogenesis of MI. Medical management with enema irrigation is successful in up to fifty percent of infants. Some infants with MI require urgent surgical interventions either secondary to failed medical management or complications of enema therapy (7) . Overall outcomes of medical and surgical intervention of infants with MI are encouraging. Understanding of the relationship between MI and genetic predisposition as well as environmental impact on infants with CF clearly deserves further investigations.",

Accumulation of viscid fecal material with strong adhesion to villi and crypts of the mucosa is a hallmark of this syndrome. Clinically it is differentiated from constipation by an acute onset of symptoms suggestive of partial or complete intestinal obstruction. DIOS can also present as intermittent symptoms of abdominal pain and distention likely attributed to a partial breakdown and re-accumulation of mucofeculent material over a strongly adherent mucoid mass. Radiographic images suggestive of right lower quadrant fecal loading along with clinical symptoms and physical findings of a palpable mass is sufficient to establish a diagnosis pending exclusion of other surgical and medical causes of right lower quadrant abdominal pain with clinical signs of obstruction (8) . DIOS is seen more frequently with pancreatic insufficient patients as well as those with a prior history of MI or prior episodes of DIOS (8) . In European studies, prevalence of DIOS was found to be up to seven times greater in adult patients compared to pediatric patients with CF (9) . Other mechanisms such as intestinal dysmotility, mucosal inflammation, tissue hypertrophy, fat malabsorption and defective chloride and water secretion into gut lumen are likely to contribute to obstructive process and collectively contribute to DIOS (8) . Pharmacologic management is centered on luminal rehydration with osmotic stool softeners to mobilize the mucus mass and relieve obstruction. Enemas and nasogastric decompression can be used in cases of severe obstruction. Surgical intervention remains the last resort once medical management fails or there are signs of bowel ischemia (8) . Emphasis is also placed on prevention of recurrent episodes of DIOS by adherence with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, hydration and routine stool softeners.",

Despite these observations, there is no correlation between the dose of pancreatic enzymes and self-reported constipation in patients with pancreatic insufficiency (11) . In contrast to the general population where the likely cause of constipation in a pediatric age group is deficiency in dietary fiber and inadequate fluid intake, these factors were not associated with constipation in children with CF (10).

Bacterial overgrowth within the segments of the small intestine produce toxic byproducts and metabolites often leading to enterocyte damage, malabsorption and malnutrition. Our current understanding of the pathophysiology of SBBO in CF has been facilitated by studies using the CF mouse model (12) . SBBO can present with symptoms of abdominal pain, distention and diarrhea. There are significant limitations in studying SBBO in patients. Diagnostic modalities such as imaging, culture of duodenal aspirates and breath hydrogen testing all have limitations. Empiric therapy with enteric antibiotics and probiotics is frequently initiated to suppress and potentially eradicate bacterial overgrowth in the small bowel. species, suggesting that the lungs of CF pigs have a host defense defect against a wide spectrum of bacteria. Second, the number of bacteria in the CF pig lung is variable over time, similar to humans with CF, suggesting that not all host defenses are impaired. Third, the CF pig has provided additional insight regarding the temporal and causal relations between inflammation and infection in the CF lung. Newborn CF pig lungs show no inflammation but are less often sterile than controls. Fourth, after introduction of bacteria into CF pig lungs, pigs with CF fail to eradicate bacteria as effectively as wild-type pigs. Finally, ion transport studies in CFTR-/-newborn nasal and tracheal/bronchial epithelia show markedly reduced Cland HCO 3 transport (7). Yet, lack of CFTR does not increase transepithelial Na + or liquid absorption or reduce periciliary liquid depth. These results suggest that impaired bacterial eradication is the pathogenic event that initiates a cascade of inflammation and pathology in CF lungs. Furthermore, these studies suggest that reduced anion permeability, and not increased Na + transport, initiates CF airway disease.",

Persons with cystic fibrosis maintain an increased risk for experiencing severe viral respiratory illness throughout life because of their progressive pulmonary inflammation and disease. Infants and young children with CF, like their healthy counterparts, have comparable high rates of infection with respiratory viruses. They differ, however, in their severity and duration of illness. They are significantly more likely compared to healthy infants and young children to develop 1) a lower respiratory tract illness; 2) have a slower illness resolution; 3) an increased risk of hospitalization; 4) a persistent deterioration in lung function; and 5) an increased risk for bacterial colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae (1-3). Increasing age normally reduces the risk for severe respiratory disease related to viral infections. Unfortunately, older children with CF experience frequent bouts of respiratory exacerbations. These events are often related to an acute respiratory viral infection. Respiratory viruses, in particular, rhinovirus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza virus are frequently detected during acute exacerbations in older children resulting in clinical deterioration, intravenous antibiotic treatment, and lung inflammation (4) (5) (6) (7) . Improvement in viral diagnostics with use of new molecular diagnostic platforms such as the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt PCR) can improve our understanding of the role of respiratory viral infections on progressive lung disease experienced in children with CF.",

Influenza vaccination coverage in the CF population is very high in the U.S. and Europe. The CF Foundation, utilizing their patient registry from 2006-2007, reported influenza vaccination coverage of approximately 90% in children and adults with CF. Underutilization occurred among Hispanics and persons requiring oxygen therapy. A second strategy is maternal immunization. Vaccination of the pregnant women has both a direct benefit to the pregnant women and an indirect benefit to the newborn infant. Infants born to mothers who are vaccinated during pregnancy have a significantly lower risk of influenza infection during their first six months of life. Recall that the influenza vaccine is not approved for use in infants less than 6 months of age. Maternal vaccination against influenza, unfortunately, has been a neglected practice accounting for the lowest vaccination coverage of all target populations. Another strategy is vaccination of select groups who spread the virus efficiently to others such as school-age children, persons who care for or live with persons at high risk, and healthcare workers. This strategy has a direct benefit to the vaccinated person and an indirect benefit to their contacts. Vaccination of school age children has been associated with indirect protection against influenza related complications in unvaccinated household members and the community while vaccination of healthcare workers has been associated with decreased morbidity and mortality in their patients. Surprisingly healthcare workers have suboptimal coverage. Mandatory influenza vaccination programs, although controversial, appears to be the most effective way to significantly improve influenza vaccination coverage among healthcare workers.",

Progesterone receptors have been noted at the base of the airway cilia (11) . Progesterone has an inhibitory effect on cilia beat frequency that is blocked by estrogen (12) . The relative change in balance between progesterone and estrogen that occurs after menopause or perhaps with an asthenic morphotype might alter airway clearance to allow retention of aerosolized environmental organisms like the NTM. Indeed, patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia also appear to have a marked susceptibility to NTM infections with a similar prevalence that appears to increase with age as in CF (13) .

Prior epidemiologic studies that have examined the potential for humanto-human transmission of NTM have not found evidence to support this (2). However, a recent outbreak of lethal disease associated with a clonal strain of M. massiliense among CF patients in an adult lung transplant center raises significant concerns for the potential of human-to human transmission among a particularly vulnerable population (17) .",

It is likely this susceptibility relates to altered airway clearance favoring retention of inhaled organisms from contaminated environmental aerosols on the airway surface. The reasons for the age and gender associations are not entirely clear. While these organisms affect a minority of CF patients, disease associated with the M. abscessus group can be particularly devastating. The recently described outbreak of M. massiliense among CF patients awaiting transplant might warrant similar infection control considerations for some species as are recommended for other virulent organisms such as Burkholderia cepacia. Identification of specific inducible virulence factors that might allow a more refined approach to infection control and better targeting of aggressive treatment regimens is of key importance.",

The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD, USA; 2. Case Medical Center, Cleveland, OH, USA Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a particularly important emerging pathogen in CF. The prevalence of infection with MRSA in the CF community has increased from 4% in 1999 to 23.7% in 2009 (1). Recently, two very large CF observational studies utilizing the CF Foundation's National Patient Registry database have suggested that infection with MRSA is associated with worse clinical outcomes. The first, published in 2008, demonstrated that persistent respiratory infection with MRSA is associated with a more rapid decline in lung function as measured by FEV 1 (2). The second, published in JAMA in 2010, demonstrated an association between persistent MRSA infection and increased mortality, even after adjustment for severity of lung disease (3). Given the striking increase in both prevalence of MRSA infection in CF and evidence of a detrimental effect of MRSA on CF clinical outcomes, there has been growing interest in treatment protocols designed to treat and/or eradicate MRSA CF respiratory infection. Highlighting care-givers' concerns about MRSA, a recent survey of U.S. pediatric and adult CF Center Directors identified studies to determine appropriate treatment of MRSA as their top clinical priority. Previous Studies of Treatment of MRSA in CF. There have been several small clinical studies in CF assessing MRSA treatment regimens and their effectiveness in eradicating MRSA from the respiratory tract.",

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multi-system and multi-organ disease. Because CF lung disease claims the majority of morbidity and mortality clinically, current research efforts chiefly focus on the lung and airway epithelia. However, if CF lung disease is solely an epithelial problem, then, lung transplantation by giving the patients new lungs would solve all the issues. Our retrospective clinical data analyses indicate that CF lung-transplant patients contract Pseudomonas lung infection much earlier and more frequently than the non-CF lung transplants (1).

Blohmke Dept. of Pediatrics, Univ. of British Columbia, Child & Family Research Institute, Vancouver, BC, Canada Lung disease, the major cause of death in cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by chronic infection and inflammation. Current therapies for CF address airway infection with antibiotics, and airway obstruction using clearance techniques combined with mucolytics. Safe and clinically-acceptable therapies to target airway inflammation are likely to augment current treatments and improve the clinical outcome in CF (1) . Clinical trials with oral corticosteroids, high-dose ibuprofen and azithromycin have demonstrated that anti-inflammatory therapy is beneficial for patients with CF, improving important clinical outcomes such as lung function and body weight. Clinical experience with these relatively non-specific antiinflammatory medications provides \"proof of concept\" evidence that targeting inflammation can be beneficial in CF. Our challenge is now to identify new, specific antiinflammatory targets.Modulating the function of the innate immune system is a particularly attractive treatment approach, since activation of the innate immune system is central to the inflammatory response occurring in the CF lung (2). Innate immunity relies upon a series of germline-encoded receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), to sense infectious organisms and to trigger an acute inflammatory response. Work by our group and others suggests that modulation of TLR function, and particularly TLR5 inhibition, has therapeutic potential to improve the inflammatory manifestations of CF (3, 4) . Emerging evidence indicates that the TLR5-flagellin interaction plays a central role in driving the inflammatory response triggered by P. aeruginosa and inhibition of TLR5 normalizes the inflammatory response generated by CF airway epithelial cells following exposure to P. aeruginosa (4) .A powerful translational research approach for identifying and validating new therapeutic targets is through the identification of genetic variants that modify CF clinical phenotypes. The TLR5 gene harbours a polymorphism-TLR5 c.1174C>T (rs5744168)-that encodes a premature stop codon. Since allele T has been shown by our group and others (5) to be associated with significantly impaired flagellin responsiveness, we predicted that CF patients carrying the T allele would have improved clinical outcomes due to the endogenous antiinflammatory effects of this TLR5 variant. In a large representative CF cohort, adults with CF carrying the TLR5 premature stop codon (CT or TT genotype) had improved nutritional status, as measured by zBMI, compared with CF patients homozygous for the common fully-functional allele (CC genotype) (6) . Nevertheless, our results must be interpreted with some caution given that the association between the TLR5 c.1174C>T SNP and zBMI in adult CF patients was modest (P=0.044) and the modifying impact of TLR5 will only be firmly established through replication studies in other CF cohorts.A major challenge confronting our CF research community and our efforts to successfully control pulmonary inflammation is to understand the molecular mechanism(s) mediating inflammatory immune responses in the CF airway. Despite an increasing appreciation of how CF pathogens interact with the airway epithelium, it remains unclear whether inflammation in CF is inherently triggered by loss-of-function CFTR mutations alone or due to the failure of the innate immune system to control infection of the airways. Many studies support the concept that excess inflammation is a fundamental component of CF. For example, even in the absence of culturable infections increased pro-inflammatory molecules are found in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of CF patients (7) and immortalized fetal CF cells showed enhanced activation of pro-inflammatory pathways (8) . While the lack of CFTR channel function (9) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced inflammatory responses (10) have been suggested as potential causes, the mechanisms underlying the exaggerated inflammatory phenotype in CF are not clear. In some studies p38 MAPK and ERK signalling is dysregulated in CF with potentially detrimental consequences including increased activation of pro-inflammatory transcription factors (NF-\u03baB, AP-1) (11, 12) . Other reports suggest that Ca 2+ signalling or an imbalance in the oxidative stress response in CF potentially mediates the enhanced activation of pro-inflammatory signalling (10, 13) .Nevertheless, the evidence supporting a hyperinflammatory phenotype in CF is far from unanimous with CF and early microbe-host interactions. The most devastating anomaly of CF occurs in the lung characterized by chronic bacterial infection, abnormal airway inflammation, extensive neutrophil infiltration and small airway obstruction (2) (3) . CF lung infection has a unique pathogen profile which is distinct from other lung infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Burkholderia cepacia are the most prevalent, among which P. aeruginosa predominates (4) (5) (6) . Strikingly, all the CF organisms except S. aureus are opportunistic pathogens, which do not cause infections in normal hosts but in neutropenic patients (6) . It is not fully understood why CF patients are particularly susceptible to these organisms and how the organisms manage to escape the host defense at the early infection stages when there is little antibiotic selection and no biofilm formation. It is the early microbehost interactions and the early subversion of the host defense that leads to pathogen colonization and subsequently persistent infection in CF lungs.Polymorphonuclear neutrophils and anti-bacterial defense. Neutrophils constitute 50-60% of the circulating leukocyte pool in humans and are the major cell type to combat extracellular bacterial infections (7) . Neutrophils ingest bacteria by a process known as phagocytosis (8) . After the bacteria are contained in the membrane-bounded phagosomes, neutrophils produce toxic oxidants including hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) to achieve an efficient killing (9-10). HOCl, the active component in common laundry bleach, is synthesized by myeloperoxidase (MPO) predominantly presented in neutrophils. This MPO-catalyzed chemical reaction, H 2 O 2 + Cl -+ H + \u00c7 HOCl + H 2 O, requires Clas a substrate. Thus, the availability of this anion to neutrophil phagosomes is a rate-limiting factor, which affects the production of HOCl. Such a defect in phagocytic innate immunity may preferentially allow certain bacterial strains to evade the compromised host defense.Neutrophils express CFTR and mobilize this chloride channel to their phagosomes. Human peripheral blood neutrophils express CFTR as noted by immunofluorescent staining. When neutrophils phagocytose bacteria, CFTR is recruited to the phagosomes (11) . PLB-985 cells are premyelocytic cell line. We have established a permanent cell line expressing EGFP-wt-CFTR. After induction with 1.25% DMSO, the cells differentiate into mature neutrophils which internalize opsonized 3-micron Latex beads. CFTR is rapidly mobilized to the nascent phagosomal membrane and persists through phagosomal maturation. Therefore, CFTR recruitment to phagosomal membrane is an early event, which reflects the importance of the CFTR channel in neutrophil functions.",

            "text": "To directly measure chloride levels in neutrophil phagosomes, we conjugated chloride probe to zymosan particles. After phagocytosis by normal or CF neutrophils, fluorescence of the probe was quantitatively measured and the dynamics of the chloride level in phagosomes in response to extracellular chloride level changes were recorded. The data demonstrated that CF neutrophils are deficient in transporting chloride to the organelle (12) . Furthermore, CF neutrophil microbicidal function is impaired, especially in a low chloride environment (13) .Summary. Mounting evidence indicates that CFTR plays an important role in phagocytic host defense, which may contribute to CF lung pathogenesis.The mucus layer coating the gastrointestinal tract is one of the first lines of innate host defense. However, in cystic fibrosis (CF), a hallmark of the disease is the accumulation of abnormally thick and sticky mucus in the lung, intestine, and various other exocrine organs. Although the accumulation of thick mucus is thought likely to play a central role in the development of CF, how mutations in the CFTR gene lead to mucus accumulation has not been determined.Why HCO 3 -? Several hypotheses are proposed to explain the pathogenesis of abnormally thick mucus in CF. Probably the most prevalent is excessive Na + and fluid absorption that dehydrates mucus due to unregulated epithelial Na + channel (ENaC) activity (1). However, it is very difficult to extend this rationale from the airways to other CF affected organs, where ENaC is not expressed, for example, the small intestine. Impaired HCO 3 secretion in major CF-affected organs such as pancreas and small intestine has been documented for many years (2-4), but the possible involvement of HCO 3 with mucus formation has received little attention. The major constituents of normal mucus are mucin glycoproteins, which are large, heavily glycosylated proteins with a defining feature of tandem repeating sequences of amino acids. Intracellularly, the Ca 2+ and H + cations shield the high density of fixed anionic sites on the oligosaccharides that surround the protein cores of the mucin monomers (5, 6) . We hypothesized that HCO 3 as an important biological buffer may play a crucial role in unpackaging and expanding mucins from condensed granules to the final mucus substance by neutralizing H + and /or sequestering Ca 2+ .Can HCO 3 help mucus release in the small intestine? To validate our hypothesis, we designed experiments to determine the impact of HCO 3 on mucus release. We made a simple temperature-controlled mucus perfusion system. Mouse intestinal segments were perfused luminally with glucose-free Ringers solution. The perfusate was collected and assayed by WGA-lectin binding or by PAS staining of the filtrand retained on Immobilon-P film (7) . After testing several agonists, we found that serotonin (5-HT) and prostaglandin E2 (PEG2) are two potent mucus secreting stimulants. Then, stimulated mucus release was tested in the presence and absence of HCO 3 or different inhibitors. After removing HCO 3 from the bath solution, released mucus in perfusate was significantly decreased compared to the HCO 3 -Ringers solution. Further, the Na + -HCO 3 contransporter (NBC) inhibitor, DIDS, also markedly reduce 5-HT and PGE2-induced mucus release. These results suggest that HCO 3 is crucial for normal mucus release. We observed that PGE2 and 5-HT did not induce significant mucus release either in CFTR knock-out mice or in the presence of CFTR inhibitor, glyH-101, indicating that normal mouse intestinal mucus release requires CFTR-dependent HCO 3 secretion (7). Is the HCO 3 --dependent mucus release due to HCO 3 --dependent fluid secretion? In addition to HCO 3 -, fluid secretion also appears to be crucial for mucus transport (7-9), which raises a possibility that",

Stoltz, M.D., Ph.D. Internal Medicine, Univ. of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics, Iowa City, IA, USA Despite significant advances in our understanding of CF disease pathogenesis and therapeutic interventions, CF remains a potentially lethal disease. Lung disease causes most of the morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) (1) . Understanding the pathogenesis of the lung disease has been hindered, however, by the lack of an animal model with characteristic features of CF. We chose pigs for the development of a new CF model, because they are more similar to humans than are mice in terms of anatomy, physiology, immune system, biochemistry, life span, size, and genetics (2, 3) . We now know that, within months of birth, CF pigs (both CFTR-/-and CFTR\u2206F508/\u2206F508) spontaneously develop features typical of human CF lung disease, including airway inflammation, infection, remodeling, mucus accumulation, and airway obstruction (4) (5) (6) . Findings from the CF pig lung have provided insight into CF disease pathogenesis. First, CF pig lungs contain multiple bacterial Recent work suggests that the airways of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients harbor a vast array of bacteria not previously implicated in CF infections. These findings have fundamentally altered concepts of CF lung disease. For example, culture-independent analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples indicated that 25% of children harbored organisms not typically associated with CF. Studies using newer methods are even more striking. Infecting populations consisting of between 206-1329 bacterial taxa per patient were found in upper airway samples analyzed using DNA microarrays. If correct, these findings would require that we fundamentally change established ideas about CF infections.",

            "text": "An important outstanding question, however, is how to interpret these results given the potential that sputum, throat and BAL samples can be contaminated with bacteria from the upper airway. Contamination is a concern for a number of reasons. First, upper airways contain abundant flora, and throat, sputum, and bronchoscopy samples can be mixed with upper airway secretions. Second, culture-independent methods employ 20-35 cycles of PCR amplification, thus even trace amounts of contaminating DNA can produce a robust signal. Third, like the lung, the nasal and pharyngeal epithelium produce mucus that could encase resident bacteria. This complicates efforts to wash contaminating bacteria away, or differentiate them from lung organisms by microscopy. Finally, clinical labs typically disregard organisms known to be oropharyngeal flora to avoid confounding results. Research applications of culture-independent methods bypass these criteria. These factors raise the possibility that non-culture based detection methods could overestimate lung microbial diversity due to upper airway contamination.The goals of this study were to answer three key questions. First, what bacterial species are present in the lower airways of CF patients with established chronic infections? Identifying the resident bacteria is critical to understanding the mechanisms producing disease. Second, how does oropharyngeal contamination affect culture-independent measurements performed on upper airway specimens? Addressing this question is vital to interpreting culture-independent measurements of infecting population composition at early disease stages. Third, are there consistent differences in the makeup of bacterial populations in distinct anatomic regions of the lung? Finding such differences might explain the regional variation in disease severity often seen in CF lungs. To answer these questions we devised a sterile dissection technique to isolate secretions from the lobar segments of CF lungs removed at the time of lung transplantation. We measured the composition of infecting populations in these samples using 16S rDNA amplicon pyrosequencing and compared results to paired throat and sputum samples collected hours earlier.",

Prior to 1990, nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) had been described in only a handful of CF patients (1). A large cross sectional study that sampled approximately 10% of the U.S. CF population in the mid 1990s with 3 sputum specimens prospectively collected over a year found an overall prevalence of NTM in 13% (2) . This prevalence appeared to exponentially increase with age ranging from 10% in children around age 10 to almost 50% in CF patients over the age of 40. A single site survey of CF patients over the age of 40 found very notable differences in those patients diagnosed early in life (median age of diagnosis around age 2) and later in life (median diagnosis approximately age 27) with the latter group being mostly female and 75% having NTM in their lower airway (3) . Similarly in the general population, CDC surveys of state mycobacteriology lab isolates reported in the 1980s and mid '90s suggested prevalence of 2-8 per 100,000 (4, 5) . However, more recent studies have noted an increasing prevalence over time with prevalence and relative female predominance increasing markedly by decade over age 50 (6) (7) (8) .Single site studies of patients presenting with apparent",
