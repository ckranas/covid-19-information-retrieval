This is accomplished by removing harmful agents as much as possible in the nasal passages and conducting airways. Alveolar mechanisms form a second level of defense. The upper respiratory tract functions to warm and humidify inspired air and to remove larger particles and water-soluble gases by means of the mucous lining. Warming and humidifying principally occurs during passage of air through the nose. It is facilitated by the extensive surface area and the rich, readily engorged vascular plexus in the submucosa, particularly of the turbinates, and nasal septum. Many particles in inspired air are first deposited on the mucous lining of nasal passages and conducting airways and are then cleared by movement of the mucociliary blanket. The larger the particles, the more efficient their removal in the upper airways. Deposition on surfaces is mainly by inertial impaction, gravitational sedimentation, diffusion, or a combination of these. Inertial impaction is chiefly in the nasal passages and pharynx and at points of branching of airways, where the airstream changes its direction and where turbulence occurs. The efficiency of nasopharyngeal trapping depends on the anatomic complexity of the nasal passages, especially with regard to the turbinates, and on the pattern of respiration. The gravitational settlement of particles is directly proportional to their size and density and is favored in the relatively still air of deeper parts of the respiratory system. Diffusion of particles is due to molecular collision and affects only the very smallest of them, that is, particles of less than -0.3 |xm in size. Since displacement velocity by diffusion is low, deposition by this method is effective only in the alveoli, where movement of gases is also by diffusion rather than linear flow.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Deposition of particles greater than -10 |mm aerodynamic diameter is virtually complete above the larynx. With decreasing particle size, an increasing proportion of inhaled particles pass into the deep lung, although many are subsequently exhaled. The critical feature, from the point of view of pulmonary homeostasis, is that droplet nuclei and other irritant or infectious particles around 1-2 |xm in diameter mostly deposit at the bronchiolar-alveolar junction. This is because the total cross-sectional area of airspaces increases suddenly, linear velocity of the airstream falls to zero, and there is time for the particles to deposit by gravitational settling. As will be discussed later, this is one of the reasons for the vulnerability of the bronchiolaralveolar junction to damage by inhaled irritants. Statements on relationship between particle size and deposition are relative rather than absolute. Sizes quoted for mathematical modeling of particle deposition are in terms of equivalent cross-sectional diameters of unit-density spheres (aerodynamic diameter). The most obvious exception to the generalization that particles greater than 10 u,m in diameter do not penetrate beyond the larynx is that fine fibers up to 100 |xm or longer, notably of asbestos, do reach alveolar parenchyma. Additionally, there might be opportunity for redistribution of particles deposited in the proximal respiratory tract by reflux of excess secretions or aspiration of fluid.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Once particles are deposited on the mucus of airways, clearance by normally functioning mucociliary transport is highly efficient. Most particles are removed from central airways within a few hours, and even from distal airways within 24 hr. The mucociliary blanket consists of cilia bathed in a watery sol on top of which lies mucus with physical properties of a viscoelastic gel. Whether the mucus usually forms a patchy or continuous surface layer is still debated, but it will probably prove to be continuous in healthy individuals. In any event, the cilia beat mostly in the watery hypophase, except during the active forward stroke when their tips contact the overlying mucus. The net effect of a ciliary frequency of around 1000 beats a minute is to propel the mucus toward the pharynx at a linear velocity of the order of 10 mm/min. The greater density of ciliated cells in proximal airways, the more rapid ciliary beat, and possibly, absorption of a portion of the aqueous periciliary fluid are believed to prevent swamping of these airways, especially the trachea, by fluid collected from the large number of distal airways.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Most of the mucous secretions of the respiratory tract, and the particulate matter they carry, reach the pharynx and are swallowed. The concentration of material into the nasopharynx coincides with well-developed diffuse and focal lymphoid tissue of the tonsillar region and dorsal nasopharynx.

In addition to the physical aspects of the sol and gel phases of the secretion, however, a variety of other components with defensive capabilities are recognized. The major immunoglobulin is locally synthesized IgA, although IgE, IgG, and other classes are present. Immunoglobulin A is produced by plasma cells resident in the lamina propria of the respiratory mucosa and secreted through epithelial serous cells. A major function of organized lymphoid tissue in the walls of the nasal passages, nasopharynx, and airways is believed to be to populate, through the circulation, the respiratory mucosa with precursors of IgA-secreting plasma cells. This includes bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue. The principal functions of IgA are thought to be viral neutralization, aggregation of macromolecular antigens to impede their mucosal absorption, and inhibition of bacterial colonization. Important nonspecific humoral components of the secretions are interferon, which helps limit viral infection in nonimmune hosts, and lysozyme (muramidase) and lactoferrin, which have selective antibacterial activity. The normal bacterial flora of the nose and nasopharynx are important in that by specific adherence of their specialized surface structures (pili) to receptors on cilia and surfaces of epithelial cells, they prevent adherence and colonization by more pathogenic flora. Most current investigations of bacterial interference are on flora of the alimentary tract and skin of humans. By analogy, however, the phenomenon is undoubtedly important in the upper respiratory tract of animals.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The physical and humoral defenses of the mucociliary blanket, which are constantly in operation, are boosted by cellular and humoral mechanisms recruited from blood at the onset of inflammation, and by sneezing, coughing, and bronchoconstriction provoked by irritation of airway receptors.

Interference with any one or more of these predisposes to infection, and is considered under Bronchopneumonia.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Alveolar defense against small-sized particles depends heavily on phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages. Phagocytosis of readily ingested particles, for instance, opsonized bacteria, is largely complete by 4 hr after alveolar deposition. Actual physical removal of particulates from alveoli is inefficient, in contrast to their removal when deposited on the mucociliary blanket. Fifty per cent clearance of particles deposited in alveoli takes from several days to months or longer, depending on their physical nature and irritant capability. Most particles are therefore phagocytosed by macrophages and either inactivated or sequestered. The alveolar macrophages move toward the bronchioles and hence eventually onto the mucociliary blanket. Reasons for their centripetal movement are not known, but the surface-lining liquid in alveoli is also believed to move centripetally, possibly because of its continual secretion and a ''milking\" action of respiratory movements. Alternative fates of particles in alveoli are clearance in the lining liquid without phagocytosis, or penetration into the pulmonary interstitium. The latter becomes of increasing importance as the particulate load increases. Although not completely proven, it appears that most particles reach the interstitium by endocytosis across the alveolar type I epithelial cells. Once in the interstitial space, particles move with the flow of lymph and are phagocytosed by interstitial macrophages. Particle-laden macrophages associated with lymphatics occur in peribronchiolar and perivascular clusters, and some eventually find their way to the local lymph nodes. Overloading the alveolar macrophage system favors accumulation of particles in the interstitium, as occurs in the pneumoconioses.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Sterility of alveoli is thus maintained largely by the ability of macrophages to kill ingested bacteria and to secrete interferon. These activities are enhanced by immunoglobulin, particularly through the opsonizing effect of IgG, which is the predominant immunoglobulin in the alveolar lining liquid. Alveolar macrophages are also capable of initiating a variety of amplification mechanisms, particularly by their recruitment of neutrophils and sensitized T lymphocytes. The latter in turn can cause macrophage activation.

The densely anastomosing network of capillaries in alveolar septa provides the equivalent of \"sheet\" flow when they are all patent. This arrangement both provides for easy trapping of emboli in the pulmonary vascular bed and for minimizing the deleterious effects of blockage. Effects of blockage are minimized further by the dual pulmonary and bronchial arterial blood supplies to the lung. Nevertheless, emboli carry a risk and are associated with a variety of lesions, according to the nature of the emboli. The types of emboli vary greatly. Unusual ones are epidermal fragments and hair inadvertently introduced into the blood at the time of injection, or fragments of nucleus pulposus from intervertebral disks. More commonly they are bacteria, fungi, protozoa, endogenous fat, normal cells (which may be represented by megakaryocytes), or abnormal cells (which are principally neoplastic). They can also be fragments of bland or septic thrombi, helminth parasites for which the respiratory system is a natural or accidental habitat, or even parasitic ova, as required by Pnewnostrongylus tenuis of deer for the continuation of its life cycle. In general, the benefit of the lung acting as a blood filter is the prevention of emboli reaching the systemic circulation and the protection of organs such as the brain, heart, and kidneys against infarction. The detriments are spread of infection, metastasis of tumors, and pulmonary thromboembolism causing shock.

These will be considered further under Interstitial Pneumonia. The reasons for the special vulnerability of the lung are only now emerging. Pulmonary capillary endothelium as a whole forms a highly metabolic organ, particularly with respect to vasoactive substances and the blood-clotting, fibrinolytic, and arachidonic acid cascades. For reasons still unclear, in conditions such as shock and septicemia there is a tendency in pulmonary capillaries for activation of Hageman factor, release of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, and aggregation of platelets and neutrophils.

The best example of this for present purposes is the necrosis of nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial (Clara) cells of the horse caused experimentally by 3-methylindole.

Another example is the acute pulmonary congestion and edema almost invariably found in sheep dying as a result of any acute disease process. More precise mechanistic reasons for differences in species response are coming to light as more is learned about the interspecies variations in specific cell types and their metabolic capabilities. One example already alluded to is that the selectivity of damage caused by some pneumotoxins depends on the distribution of enzymes capable of metabolizing them.

On clinical and experimental grounds, the disease is generally regarded as being principally of infectious origin, but the proportional involvement of the various agents that have been incriminated and the role of enhancing factors have to be clarified. A variety of inflammatory stimuli can cause atrophy of turbinates, often of a temporary nature. The morphologic features of atrophic rhinitis are therefore not particularly specific. There is growing evidence that the naturally occurring disease is mainly the result of adherence and persistent colonization of nasal mucosa by virulent strains of Bordetella bronchiseptica, Pasteurella multocida, or perhaps more importantly, both organisms. Other bacteria found on the nasal mucosa, such as Haemophilus parasuis, probably play a lesser role. Factors known to be capable of enhancing the severity of the clinical disease, for instance, cytomegalovirus infection (inclusion-body rhinitis) or adverse environmental and nutritional circumstances, probably act by facilitating the colonization and persistence of the pathogenic bacteria. Nutritional defects, particularly those involving calcium and phosphorus, can also interfere with metabolism of bone at the time when rapid growth and remodeling of turbinates in young pigs make them most susceptible to the effects of the infectious agents. Nutritional deficiencies alone, however, do not cause atrophic rhinitis.

Laryngitis can, however, occur without wider involvement of the respiratory tract ( Fig. 6 .7B). Laryngitis can occur as a part of oral necrobacillosis (calf diphtheria) caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum in calves and swine, or it might occur without lesions elsewhere. Ulcers or scarred sites of previous ulceration are found in a small proportion of larynges in slaughtered feedlot cattle. They occur mainly at points of apposition of vocal processes and medial angles of arytenoid cartilages. It is speculated that mucosal damage by the repeated trauma of laryngeal closure is the main predisposing cause of ulceration. It has also been suggested that Haemophilus somnus infection may sometimes be a factor.

In the lung there are two major forms. Alveolar (vesicular) emphysema is excessive amounts of air within airspaces of the lung. Interstitial emphysema is the presence of air within interlobular, subpleural, and other major interstitial zones of the lung. Emphysema, unless otherwise qualified, should only be used for alveolar emphysema. The most widely accepted definition of human emphysema is abnormal enlargement of airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles, with evidence of loss or destruction of their walls. Some broaden the definition to include abnormal enlargement of airspaces, with or without evidence of destruction. The advantages of requiring evidence of destruction of walls of the airspaces is that it enables more precise recognition of an irreversible, functionally significant lesion. Simple enlargement, or hyperinflation, can be a temporary and relatively insignificant lesion. An example of this is the so-called compensatory emphysema, which occurs along the margin of a consolidated lung ( Fig. 6 .9C). What appear to be emphysematous lesions in lungs removed postmortem are often not significant antemortem changes but mostly result from failure of the lung to deflate normally ( Fig. 6 .9A,D). This is caused by air trapping, usually by blockage or spasm of airways.

With regard to pathogenetic factors in emphysema, there has been considerable speculation over the years concerning the relative importance of genetic factors, inflammatory alveolar destruction, atrophy of alveolar septa due to ischemic or unknown cause, and mechanical factors leading to widening and rupture of airspaces. Two important findings led to convergence of these ideas. One was the discovery that persons deficient in a l -antitrypsin (now referred to as a!-protease inhibitor) have increased incidence and earlier onset of emphysema. The other was that intratracheal injection of papain in hamsters produced an emphysematous lesion. Further developments led to the current basic hypothesis that emphysema is caused by excessive proteolysis in the lung because of protease-antiprotease imbalance. The critical structural component undergoing lysis is elastin, because experimentally the development of emphysema is only correlated well with elastolytic activity and evidence of elastin breakdown. In homozygous aj-protease-inhibitor deficiency, the emphysema is pan-acinar in distribution, and the protease-antiprotease imbalance is presumed to be due mainly to the reduction in the antiprotease.

A point to be emphasized most strongly is that there is no connection whatsoever between the pathogenesis of alveolar emphysema, as described previously, and interstitial emphysema in the cow. Although there is as yet no proof, it is presumed that air is forced into the complete but delicate interlobular septa because bronchioles are collapsed during forced expiration.

Two factors are important in ensuring that alveoli do not become flooded under normal circumstances. One is that alveolar epithelium and its intercellular junctions are much less permeable than endothelial structures and therefore effectively seal off the alveolar lumen. The other is that the interstitial space is at lower pressure than intraalveolar pressure. The interstitial pressure in the loose fascia surrounding vessels and airways where lymphatics are situated becomes increasingly subatmospheric (\"negative\") toward the pulmonary hilus. The net effect is that liquid is drained from alveolar interstitium to lymphatics and thence to the hilus of the lung. The bronchovascular interstitium and lymphatics therefore constitute a highly compliant sump. Providing the alveolar epithelium remains undamaged, alveolar edema does not occur until the capacity of the sump is overwhelmed. In slowly developing cardiogenic edema, the volume of interstitial liquid can be increased severalfold before alveolar flooding occurs. This explains why the first morphologic evidence of edema due to cardiac insufficiency is excess liquid in interstitium and lymphatics, particularly in the more compliant hilar regions.

The frequency of the exercise-induced hemorrhage increases with age and severity of exertion. The exact locations and cause, or more likely, contributory causes, of the hemorrhage are not known. The main debate is whether pulmonary hypertension and mechanical stressing of normal pulmonary tissue during severe exertion is sufficient to cause hemorrhage, or whether preexisting pulmonary lesions are necessary. Since few, if any, lungs of horses are structurally perfect, this is a difficult matter to address. The argument that hypertension alone is unlikely to be the cause because there is no accompanying edema is, however, a forceful one. It appears likely that localized, partial obstruction of small airways or pulmonary scars will be found to play an important part. This is in accord with the hypothesis that distending pressures applied to poorly ventilated regions of lung during inflation of adjacent normal parenchyma are sufficient either to tear lung tissue or produce capillary transmural pressures high enough to cause rupture of the capillary walls. The critical feature is that the transmural pressure of the capillary is the difference between the blood pressure in the capillary and the intraalveolar pressure.

The opposite is true for the type II cell. The usual pattern of alveolar response is for necrosis and sloughing of type I cells, accompanied by the acute exudative phase of inflammation. Providing the severity of the process is not sufficient to cause necrosis of type II cells and other components of the alveolar septa, the type II cells begin to proliferate within 24 hr and eventually completely line the previously denuded alveolar wall. Histologically, small clusters of alveolar cells can be detected 2 or 3 days after loss of type I cells, and by 6 days there can be complete lining of alveoli by cuboidal type II cells. This is the appearance commonly referred to as epithelialization. During the active proliferation of type II cells, it is common to see small syncytial clusters and individual atypical cells with increased nuclear and cytoplasmic volumes, abnormal shape, and increased basophilia. Atypical cells are particularly likely to be seen in canine lungs. This active proliferation is sometimes erroneously interpreted as a neoplastic process. The complete lining of alveoli by type II cells, which is a common response to injury, has also misleadingly been referred to as \"adenomatosis.\" Proliferation of type II cells marks the shift from the exudative to the proliferative stage of pneumonia and is usually accompanied by an alveolar exudate increasingly composed of macrophages and other mononuclear cells. Resolution of the epithelial lesion, once inflammation has subsided and provided there has not been scarring of the alveolar wall, is accomplished by transformation of type II cells into type I epithelium.

The amount of fibrin is an important determinant of fibrosis. When alveolar epithelium is denuded, fibrinous membranes or plugs are infiltrated by fibroblast precursors from the alveolar wall, and collagencontaining fibrous tissue can be detected as early as 7 days after initial fibrinous exudation. There is usually an associated defect in fibrinolytic systems in such instances. The prominence of fibrin in acute alveolar injury in cattle is related to the high fibrinogen content of bovine blood, a low level of plasminogen (precursor of plasmin, a major fibrinolytic enzyme), and a high concentration of a plasmin inhibitor in pulmonary tissue.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "T H E R E S P I R A T O R Y S Y S T E M"}, {"text": "Alveolar macrophages are derived mainly from the interstitial compartment in normal lungs, but in inflammatory conditions they come mostly from blood monocytes. Local proliferation can also play a role as evidenced by the occasional finding of mitotic figures in macrophages within alveolar lumina. Once inflammation supervenes, they take their place in an intricate interplay of amplifying and inhibitory processes. Among the more important are chemotactic attraction and stimulation of neutrophils and lymphocytes, increased phagocytic and bactericidal activity in the activated state, release of lysosomal hydrolases, and enhancement of fibrinolysis by activation of plasminogen. They are also involved in pulmonary fibrosis by the secretion, under certain conditions, of fibroblast-stimulating factors. Acute damage to alveolar septa is also accompanied by the usual vascular components of acute inflammation, with accumulation of inflammatory fluid and leukocytes in the interstitium as well as in the alveoli. The inflammatory fluid in the interstitium, as in edema, is mostly accommodated in the compliant fascia and lymphatics surrounding airways and vessels, and in interlobular septa and subpleural tissue. It is most pronounced in those species having more complete interlobular septa, particularly ruminants and pigs. Cellular accumulation in alveolar walls can become pronounced in acute processes involving cell-mediated immune mechanisms, such as influenza virus infection, but they are more often associated with chronic conditions. Chronic inflammation of the alveolar septa is the major feature of chronic interstitial pneumonias and will be discussed more fully under Interstitial Pneumonia. Chronic bronchopneumonia, on the other hand, is much more likely to lead to destruction of alveolar walls and abscessation because of persistent suppuration caused by pyogenic bacteria. An aspect of the response of alveolar type II cells to chronic injury deserving of mention is their potential for undergoing metaplasia to squamous, ciliated or fetal-type, glycogen-containing cells. One of the most important general features to emerge concerning the response of pulmonary epithelial cells to both acute and chronic injury is the extent to which transdifferentiation (metaplasia of one cell type to another) can occur in airways and alveoli. Persistent irritation or disruption of the normal epithelial interaction with basement membrane and alveolar stroma, as in scarring, leads to persistence of atypical alveolar type II cells and the possibility that they might occasionally give rise to bronchioloalveolar tumors.

Morphologically, there are two approaches. One approach is to classify according to the type of inflammation. Here there are two main subcategories: exudative pneumonias, in which the emphasis is on filling of alveoli by exudate with predominant catarrhal, fibrinous, suppurative, hemorrhagic, or necrotizing characteristics; and proliferative pneumonias, in which the emphasis is on proliferation of alveolar type II cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, and possibly additional elements. The second, and more useful, morphologic approach is to classify pneumonias according to initial site of involvement and the pattern of spread of the lesion.

There are three main reasons for the vulnerability of these regions. First, they are the major site of deposition of small particles (0.5-3.0 u,m in diameter) capable of reaching deep lung. Second, the epithelium of bronchioles is probably susceptible to damage because it is not protected by the mucous blanket of larger airways nor an effective alveolar macrophage system.

Increased exposure to pathogenic microorganisms is particularly lively to occur in crowding of animals collected from a variety of sources. This is often associated with lack of specific immunity to the organisms involved. Lack of nonspecific defense mechanisms occurs in congenital or acquired immunodeficiency states or is caused by a variety of factors impairing one or both of the mucociliary blanket and alveolar macrophage defensive systems. Dehydration, extreme chilling, viral infection, inhalation of toxic gases and particles, certain anesthetics, and ciliary abnormalities inhibit mucociliary clearance and can predispose to bacterial colonization.

It is reasonable to hypothesize that there is increased deposition of infectious particles in these regions, that defenses are more easily compromised, or both. There is slightly increased deposition of particles in cranial regions. This is believed to be due to the shorter and more abruptly branching airways.

Palpable firmness (consolidation) of the tissue is the single most important gross criterion of pneumonia. The extent to which there is a lobular or sublobular mosaic of consolidated, atelectatic, congested, and more normal lung tissue depends partly on the severity and rate of spread of the pneumonia and partly on the degree of septation. It is most common in relatively slow-spreading bronchopneumonias of ruminants and swine, which have well-developed septation. (Fig. 6 .13C). The more uniform and rapidly spreading the pneumonia, the more homogeneous and extensive the consolidation. Even where complete lobes become involved, however, the bronchopneumonic pattern can often be detected on careful gross examination by the presence of multiple, small, evenly spaced, gray-white, bulging foci separated by narrow, deep red zones.

One is that certain blood-borne chemicals exert their toxic effect only after they are metabolized to reactive intermediates by microsomal enzyme systems, particularly monooxygenases (mixed-function oxidases). Depending on the chemical and the species of animal affected, damage can be limited to nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial (Clara) cells, sparing the pulmonary alveolar parenchyma, even though the parent chemical is in the blood.

Whether the endothelium or epithelium is damaged first depends on the nature, portal of entry, intensity of the insult, and to some extent, the species affected. Usually, however, the alveolar type I cells eventually suffer most damage because of their poor reparative capacity and inability to regenerate. During this acute phase, the most dramatic features of the lesion are flooding of alveoli with serofibrinous exudate, and congestion and edema of alveolar walls. Fibrin, other serum proteins, and cell debris frequently condense to form hyaline membranes lining airspaces, or aggregates plugging their lumina ( Fig. 6.18B ). There is usually some admixture of leukocytes and erythrocytes in the alveolar exudate, and an initial accumulation of mixed leukocytes within the alveolar interstitium that tends to become mostly mononuclear cells if the inflammation persists.

A summary of current understanding of the endotoxin-induced pulmonary injury is that there is an early transient severe pulmonary hypertension followed several hours later by an increased vascular and alveolar-wall permeability phase lasting up to 36 hr. The initial hypertension appears to be due mainly to release of thromboxane and prostaglandin F 2 a , which are derived from the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism. Their effect is to some extent counteracted by prostacyclin, another endoperoxide derived from the cyclooxygenase pathway.

The severity of alveolar damage depends on the extent to which virus reaches the alveolar epithelium and replicates, thus causing necrosis. This in turn is governed by the virulence of the strain of virus, the mode of infection, and the resistance of the calf. In general, experimental infections deliver more virus to deep regions of the lung and hence cause more alveolar damage. In natural infection, viral replication seems usually to be limited more to airways and hence is characterized more by bronchiolitis than pneumonia. In severe experimental infections, the amount of alveolar epithelial damage can be pronounced. The degree of alveolar exudation and subsequent proliferation of alveolar type II epithelial cells (epithelialization) is correspondingly more dramatic. The extent to which syncytial or multinucleated giant cells are seen on the alveolar walls or in the bronchiolar epithelium varies. They are not usually a notable feature. Occasional multinucleated cells are seen in the active proliferative phase of alveolar and bronchiolar epithelium following severe damage by a wide variety of infectious and noninfectious agents, particularly in cattle. It therefore appears that no specificity can be attributed to occasional giant cells in the absence of viral inclusions or ultrastructural or immunochemical demonstration of virus. The same holds true for occasional macrophage-derived giant cells.

Waxes, together with peptidoglycan (muramyl dipeptide) and various glycolipids, are responsible for most of the adjuvant activity of mycobacteria. Attraction of antigen-processing cells (macrophages) and presentation of antigen in appropriate surface configuration are major attributes of adjuvant activity. The relative importance of purified components is still under investigation. Increased glycolipid content of mycobacterial cell walls is associated with increased virulence. A close parallel is with the amount of \"cord factor\" (virulent mycobacteria form cordlike aggregates when trehalose dimycolate is in the culture medium). This correlates with the fact that, in general, the more acid fast strains are more virulent. Other glycolipids (mycosides) appear to form a barrier against lysosomal digestion and partly explain the ability of the organisms to survive after phagocytosis by macrophages.

If a normal guinea pig is inoculated subcutaneously with a culture of tubercle bacilli, generalization of the infection causes death in 2 to 3 months. At the site of inoculation, a hard nodule, or tubercle, develops in 10 to 14 days. This nodule soon breaks down to form an ulcer that persists until the animal dies. If the inoculation is made into a tuberculous guinea pig, however, the events are quite different. An acute response characterized by exudation and necrosis develops at the site of inoculation. The necrotic tissue soon sloughs, the lesion heals permanently and quickly, and the infection is not disseminated from it, even to the regional lymph node. The injected organisms that provoke the hypersensitivity reaction in the skin are fairly rapidly destroyed, but those in the primary lesions of the disease are not destroyed, and their persistence and proliferation might eventually kill the animal. Whether the hypersensitivity reaction is beneficial or harmful to the host depends on the circumstances. In common with most complex inflammatory conditions, there is a balance between inhibitory and amplifying factors. On the one hand, hypersensitivity to relatively small numbers of bacilli causes accelerated tubercle formation, which enhances the killing of the organisms and helps prevent reinfection or dissemination from the initial site of infection. On the other hand, the hypersensitivity response to large amounts of mycobacterial antigen causes extensive cell necrosis and tissue destruction, which is seriously detrimental. Liquefaction, which is brought about by hydrolytic enzymes of macrophages, and possibly neutrophils, is the most harmful response. The bacilli multiply extracellularly in the liquefied material and are available in large numbers for dissemination through cavities, vessels, and airways.

Bacilli are phagocytosed by macrophages, and if the resistance of the macrophages is adequate, the bacilli are eventually killed. If the balance tips the other way, however, the bacilli proliferate and are released from killed macrophages together with antigenic materials that sensitize attracted T lymphocytes. By the tenth day or so after exposure, by which time hypersensitivity is developing, many bacilli are present, and the tempo of events begins to quicken. Lymphokines secreted by the sensitized T lymphocytes cause the attraction, proliferation, and activation of macrophages, which are derived mostly from blood monocytes. In the infected foci, macrophages assume a distinctive appearance, causing them to be designated as epithelioid cells because of a vague histologic similarity to sheets of large epithelial cells. The epithelioid cells have large, vesicular nuclei, and extensive pale cytoplasm with ill-defined borders. The epithelioid cells ultrastructurally are characterized by abundant organelles and extensive interdigitations of their plasma membranes. They contain ingested bacilli within their cytoplasm, and the structural changes indicate a heightened bactericidal activity. Mixed in with the epithelioid cells are variable numbers of giant cells of the Langhans type ( Fig. 6.30B ). These are large cells with several eccentric nuclei and are formed by the fusion of macrophages. This admixture of epithelioid and giant cells forms the center of young tubercles. At the periphery is a narrow zone of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and unaltered monocytes. As the lesion progresses, the classical tubercle develops peripheral fibroplasia and central necrosis (Fig. 6.31C ). These two features are not present in all tuberculous infections; there are both species and individual variations. Encapsulating fibroplasia is more conspicuous in those individuals that have considerable powers of resistance, and it might, as tuberculous granulation tissue, overgrow and dominate the lesions. It is the development of central necrosis that gives the tubercle its high degree of histologic specificity. The necrosis is a product of the cell-mediated hypersensitivity and is of caseous character.

It requires that other primary cutaneous lesions be contaminated with the tubercle bacillus. The infection is limited to the initial site or may spread to the local lymph node. In congenital tuberculosis, the infection spreads via the umbilical vessels to the fetus. This route of infection is of some importance where the disease is common in cattle, and where as many as 0.5% of newborn calves have been found to have tuberculosis. This route is of little significance in other species, because only in cows is tuberculous endometritis common. When the primary complex is present in congenital infection of calves, it is in the liver and portal lymph nodes. But, as elsewhere, the complex might be apparently incomplete, and the lesions are found only in the nodes. In a fetus or calf of a few days of age, lesions in the portal node are assumed to be evidence of congenital infection; this is not necessarily the case in older calves because the portal node is also the regional node of the duodenum. Congenital tuberculosis in calves progresses quite rapidly, and the animals usually die in a few weeks or months. By that time, the disease has generalized, and lesions can be found especially in the lungs and regional lymph nodes, and in the spleen. Tuberculous lesions rarely occur in the spleen of adult cattle, and when present, irrespective of the age of the animal, they are regarded as indicative of congenital infection. For congenital tuberculosis to occur, infection must be present in the uterus. Small tubercles can be found in the endometrium. Typical placental lesions are a slimy exudate separating the placenta from the endometrium, and caseonecrotic foci in the cotyledons. Extensive areas of tuberculosis in the uterus result in repeated abortions. Genital infection occurs in cattle but is not common; its development requires that the sexual organs of either the female (usually uterus) or male (usually epididymis) be tuberculous.

Minor reaction occurs along the pathway of larval migration, but the important lesions are found in the lungs. The lesions in the pulmonary tissues can be considered in two main phases, the first when the larvae reach the lung and break out into the alveoli, and the second when the mature parasites are located in the bronchi. In natural infections, these two phases overlap and are associated with hyperplastic lymphadenitis in the related nodes. The larvae arrive in the lungs from about 5 to 7 days after ingestion. Where they emerge from pulmonary capillaries, they cause microscopic foci of necrosis or rupture of alveolar walls with an infiltrate of eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and a few giant cells. With more severe larval invasion, these foci become more numerous and larger. Mononuclear cells thicken the alveolar walls, and there is focal exudation of fibrin into alveoli together with the inflammatory cells. Eosinophils are a prominent feature of the reaction. Various degrees of hyperplasia of alveolar type II epithelial cells also occur. The larvae, some of them dead, can be found in the alveoli.

There is a strong tendency, however, for both glandular and squamous components to occur in the same tumor ( Fig. 6.45B ). Sometimes these are mixed with more anaplastic regions. It is more useful to classify these pleomorphic tumors according to the predominant invasive and destructive component, rather than to put them in the adenosquamous category. Squamous-cell and undifferentiated carcinomas are especially prone to arise from major airways and therefore have a more central (hilar) location in the lung. The bronchogenic carcinoma is typically a large, irregular, pale, fleshy mass with illdefined border and, possibly, satellite nodules. More distant intrapulmonary metastasis can occur in the same or opposite lung. Consistency ranges from firm to soft and friable. Mucinous, cystic, or hemorrhagic and necrotic regions are sometimes present in the center of large, bulky masses. Occasionally, highly malignant infiltrative tumors cause more diffuse, discolored, rubbery, or solid regions that cannot be distinguished grossly from pneumonia. Squamous-cell carcinomas have a preponderance of large cells with vesicular nuclei and abundant faintly granular acidophilic cytoplasm. Intercellular bridges can often be detected, but keratinization is usually limited to individual cells with intracytoplasmic clumps of keratin. Bronchogenic adenocarcinomas are invasive and destructive. They have disordered acinar, papillary, solid, or mixed patterns (Fig. 6 .45A), and intermixed squamous components are frequently present (Fig. 6 .45B).

The so-called oat-cell carcinoma has ill-defined clusters of small, round or oval cells resembling lymphocytes because of their hyperchromatic nuclei and small amounts of cytoplasm. In humans, the small-cell anaplastic tumors mostly arise from solitary neuroendocrine cells or organized neuroepithelial bodies, as do carcinoids. They are therefore particularly likely to be associated with paraneoplastic syndromes caused by secretion of polypeptide hormones (e.g., adrenocorticotropin, antidiuretic hormone, calcitonin) or biogenic amines (e.g., serotonin).

Be-cause of the close phenotypic relationship between these two cell types, it is not surprising that histologic and ultrastructural examination sometimes reveals both cell types in the same tumor. Bronchioloalveolar tumors are found most often in dogs, occasionally as an incidental finding at necropsy. They comprise over half the tumors found in some surveys of primary pulmonary tumors of dogs. Typically, they occur as solitary nodules in the periphery of the lung (Fig. 6.46B ). Occasionally there are multiple nodules. The more benign tumors (adenomas) grow slowly by peripheral expansion and compression of surrounding parenchyma. Centers of large nodules frequently become necrotic. Other tumors, in which the neoplastic cells spread peripherally over alveolar walls, have the characteristics of lowgrade adenocarcinomas. Less frequently, there is a rapidly spreading diffuse or disseminated multifocal type (Fig. 6.46A) . Histologically, the special feature of bronchioloalveolar tumors is the regular alveolar pattern and preservation of pulmonary architecture (Fig. 6.46C ). The preexisting alveolar stroma becomes lined by cuboidal or columnar epithelium, often with small, papillary projections into the alveolar lumina. As with many tumors, there is difficulty in clearly separating benign and malignant bronchioloalveolar tumors. Because there seems to be potential for eventual development of malignant behavior, there is often no attempt to categorize them as adenomas or carcinomas, but to regard them all as low-grade carcinomas unless there is clear evidence of highly aggressive behavior.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 942, "end": 953, "text": "(Fig. 6.46B", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1389, "end": 1401, "text": "(Fig. 6.46A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1544, "end": 1555, "text": "(Fig. 6.46C", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Primary Tumors"}, {"text": "There are two major pitfalls in the diagnosis of bronchioloalveolar tumors.
