From Nathaniel I learned not only an enormous amount of exciting physics, but also how to prepare engaging lessons and talks, how to be an effective mentor, how to think intuitively about the natural world and determine the particle physics to describe it, and how to be a caring, welcoming, community-focused academic. It goes without saying that Nathaniel's influence pervades every word written below and the physical understanding behind them.",

As a young undergraduate, Tom Lubensky's patient help during many office hours and his explicit encouragement for me to continue studying physics were vital. Cullen Blake took a risk on me as an undergrad with little to show but excitement and enthusiasm, taught me how to problemsolve like a physicist and a researcher, and truly made a huge difference in my life. And there were many such professors who kindly gave me their time and support-Mirjam Cveti\u010d, Larry Gladney, Justin Khoury, H. H. \"Brig\" Williams, Ned Wright, and othersand if I listed all the ways they have all supererogatorily supported me and my education this section would be too long. In graduate school I have also benefited from the kindness of a cadre of senior academics. Dave Sutherland and John Mason spent hours engaging me in many elucidating conversations. Don Marolf generously included me in gravity theory activities and answered my endless questions. Nima Arkani-Hamed has graciously given me his time and made me feel welcome at every turn. And there have been many other particle theorists who have offered me their advice and support over the years-Tim Cohen, Patrick Draper, Matthew McCullough, and Flip Tanedo, among others. v Of course I have not worked alone, and little of this science would have been accomplished were it not for my many collaborators who have helped me learn and problemsolve and provided guidance and been patient when I was overwhelmed with being pulled in too many directions. Let me especially mention those undergrads I have spent significant time mentoring during my time in graduate school, namely Aidan Herderschee,",

Chapter 3 introduces in brief a variety of classic strategies and solutions to the hierarchy problem which also constitute important frameworks in theoretical particle physics beyond the Standard Model. Chapter 4 discusses more-recent ideas about the hierarchy problem in light of the empirical pressure supplied by the lack of observed new physics at the Large Hadron Collider.

For a simple example from an introductory Newtonian mechanics course, consider studying the motion of balls on inclined planes in a freshman lab. It is neither necessary nor useful to model the short-distance physics of the atomic composition of the ball, nor the high-energy physics of special relativity. Inversely, it is also unnecessary to account for the long-distance physics of Hubble expansion or the low-energy physics of air currents in the lab. In quantum field theories this intuitive course of action is formalized in decoupling theorems, showing precisely the sense in which field theories are amenable to this sort of analysis: the effects of short-distance degrees of freedom may be taken into account as slight modifications to the interactions of long-distance degrees of freedom, instead of including explicitly those high-energy modes.",

Indeed, the necessary physics for describing a situation depends not only on the dynamics under consideration but also on the precision one is interested in attaining with the description. So it is crucial that one is able to correct the leading-order description by systematically adding in subdominant effects, as organized in a suitable power series in, for example, (v/c), where v is the ball's velocity and c is the speed of light. Of course when the full description of the physics is known it's in principle possible to just use the full theory to compute observables-but I'd still rather not begin with the QED Lagrangian to predict the deformation of a ball rolling down a ramp.",

Finally we need a notion of power counting, which organizes the effects in terms of importance. This will allow us to compute quantities to the desired precision systematically.

This is the procedure to find a top-down effective field theory in the abstract. 1 Since we haven't made any approximations and have the same object Z, one may be confused as to why we've lost access to the physics of the \u03a6 fields. In fact I've been a bit sloppy. If we want to compute correlation functions of our fields \u03c6, we must couple our fields to classical sources J \u03c6 as L \u2283 \u03c6(x)J \u03c6 (x). Physically, those sources allow us to 'turn on' particular fields so that we can then calculate their expectation values. Mathematically, we really need the partition function as a functional of these sources Z[J \u03c6 ], and we take functional derivatives with respect to these sources as a step to calculating correlation functions or scattering amplitudes. In integrating out our heavy field \u03a6, we no longer have a source we can put in our Lagrangian to turn on that field, as it no longer appears in the action. A great example of a top-down EFT is in studying the Standard Model fields in the context of a Grand Unified Theory (GUT). Broadly, Grand Unification is the hope that there is some simpler, more symmetric theory behind the Standard Model which explains its structure. A GUT is a model in which the gauge groups of the SM are (partially [41] ) unified in the UV. If there is a full unification to a single gauge factor, then this requires 'gauge coupling unification' in the UV until the symmetry is broken down to the SM gauge group at a high scale [42] . While one's first exposure to this idea today may be in the context of a UV theory like string theory which roughly demands such unification, this was in fact first motivated by the observed infrared SM structure. It is frankly amazing that not only are the values of the SM gauge couplings consistent with this idea, and not only does SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) fit nicely inside SU (5), but the SM fermion representations precisely fit into the 10 \u22955 representations of SU (5) (see Figure 1 .2).",

What's really behind the stability of the proton is that, though U (1) B and U (1) L are not good quantum symmetries, the fact that they are good classical symmetries means their only violation is nonperturbatively by instantons. Such configurations yield SM charges affect slightly how the couplings evolve toward high energies. Indeed, adding supersymmetry makes the intersection of the three curves even more accurate than it is in the SM itself. 3 'Accidental' here means that imposing this symmetry on the SM Lagrangian does not forbid any operators which would otherwise be allowed. The SM is defined, as above, by the gauge symmetries SU (3) C \u00d7 SU (2) L \u00d7 U (1) Y and the field content. Writing down the most general dimension-4 Lagrangian 1.3,1.4 invariant under these symmetries gives a Lagrangian which is automatically invariant under U (1) B . This no longer holds at higher order in SMEFT, and indeed the dimension-6 Lagrangian (Equation 1.5) does contain baryon-number-violating operators. If one wants to study a baryon-numberconserving version of SMEFT, one needs to explicitly impose that symmetry on the dimension-6 Lagrangian, so U (1) B is no longer an accidental symmetry of SMEFT. But in GUTs, baryon number and lepton number are no longer accidental symmetries, so no such protection is available and the GUT gauge bosons mediate tree-level proton decay processes as in Figure 1 .3. We can find the leading effect by integrating these out- 4 Convincing yourself fully that \u2206B = 3 is the smallest allowed transition is not straightforward, but let me try to make it believable for anyone with some exposure to anomalies and instantons. The existence of a mixed U (1) B SU (2) 2 L anomaly-equivalently a nonvanishing triangle diagram with two SU (2) L gauge legs and a baryon current insertion-means that the baryon current will no longer be divergenceless, \u2202 \u00b5 j \u00b5 B \u221d g 2 32\u03c0 2 trW W , where W \u00b5\u03bd a is the field strength andW its Hodge dual. Instantons are field configurations interpolating between vacuum field configurations of different topology, and there are nontrivial instantons in 4d Minkowski space for SU (2) L but not for U (1) Y as a result of topological requirements on the gauge group. So while there is also a mixed anomaly with hypercharge, we can ignore this for our purposes. The SM fermions contributing to the U (1) B SU (2) 2 L anomaly are then only Q a (the left-handed quark doublet with B = 1/3, with a a color index) and similarly for the lepton anomaly only the doublet L matters. There are three generations of each, which leads simply to a factor of three in the divergence of the global currents. Thinking about it in terms of triangle diagrams, this is simply because there are thrice as many fermions running in the loop. The extent to which an instanton solution changes the topology is given by the integral of g 2 32\u03c0 2 trW W over spacetime, which as a total derivative localizes to the boundary, and furthermore turns out to be a topological invariant of the gauge field configuration known as the winding number, an integer (technically the change in winding number between the initial and final vacua). Then the anomaly, by way of the nonvanishing divergence, relates the winding number of such a configuration to the change in baryon and lepton number it induces. The factor of the number of generations means that each unit of winding number ends up producing \u2206B = \u2212\u2206L = n g = 3. And that is why the proton is stable. Classic, detailed references on anomalies and instantons include Coleman [49] , Bertlmann [50] , and Rajamaran [51] .",

While we did need to introduce a regulator, once we make the replacement \u03bb 0 \u2192 \u03bb(\u039b) as defined in Equation 1.25 (and similar replacements for the coefficients of the other operators), the one-loop divergences are gone. We are guaranteed that any one-loop correlation function we calculate is finite in the \u039b \u2192 \u221e limit, which removes the regulator. If we wanted to increase our precision and calculate now at two loops, we would first renormalize the theory at two loops analogously to the above, and would find a more precise definition for \u03bb(\u039b) which included terms of order O(\u03bb 3 phys ).

Performing the path integral over some fields does not change the partition function, so the physics of the other fields must stay the same.

Perturbative series in QFT are quite generally not convergent but we can trust the answers anyway to order n \u223c exp 1/expansion parameter because they are asymptotic series. So really when this parameter becomes large enough we worry that our series is not even asymptotic. Thinking deeply about this leads to many interesting topics in field theory, from accounting for nonpertubative instanton effects which are (partially) behind the lack of convergence; to the program of 'resurgence', the idea that there are secret relations between the perturbative and nonperturbative pieces. This is all far outside my purview here, but some introductions aimed at a variety of audiences can be found in [66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71 ]. a theoretical uncertainty on a perturbative calculation to n th order as n \u2261 n th order result \u2212 estimated size of (n + 1) th order result n th order result , (1.43) where our Wilsonian calculation in Section 1.2.1 gave at first order, as a reminder (and with modified notation) 44) and our heuristic estimate for the size of the second order correction is ( 3 16\u03c0 2 ) 2 \u03bb(\u039b 0 ) 3 log 2 \u039b 0 \u039b .

Here we have 1 = 3 16\u03c0 2 \u03bb(\u039b 0 ) log \u039b 0 \u039b .

To compare these, we must run the highenergy value all the way down into the infrared. Above m \u03c4 1.7 GeV we have a theory where all of e, \u00b5, \u03c4 run in loops and giving an MS beta function \u03b2 \u03b1 = 2\u03b1 2 /\u03c0. But at m \u03c4 we should remove the \u03c4 from our theory, such that from m \u03c4 down to m \u00b5 105 MeV we have \u03b2 \u03b1 = 4\u03b1 2 /3\u03c0. Below the \u00b5 we solely have the electron and recover the textbook \u03b2 \u03b1 = 2\u03b1 2 /3\u03c0, and finally as we cross the electron mass threshold m e 511 keV we remove the electron from the spectrum and find that the gauge coupling stops running \u03b2 \u03b1 \u2261 0.",

Generally one wishes to imagine perturbing a CFT by a particular operator, flowing down in energy, and seeing whether the operator grows in importance-a relevant operator-or shrinks-an irrelevant operator. Perturbing a CFT by an irrelevant operator does not induce an RG flow (to a different CFT), so interesting dynamical RG flows come from CFTs perturbed by relevant operators. This clearly agrees with our power-counting notion of relevance when we're near the Gaussian fixed point, but works also if one is near a strongly-coupled, interacting fixed point where one may not know how to do such power-counting and anomalous dimensions of operators may grow to overpower their classical dimensions.",

This is enormously powerful, as prior arguments for renormalizability were made on a case by case basis and were complicated and messy and graph-theoretic.

An elementary spin-1 field comes along with a gauge symmetry In fact for discussing the technical naturalness of masses there is an even simpler argument: A massless spin-1 boson has two degrees of freedom and a massive one has three. Quantum corrections cannot generate a degree of freedom ex nihilo, so a massless gauge boson must be protected. Similarly a massless chiral fermion has two degrees of freedom, but a massive Dirac fermion has four. So for charged spinors and for vectors, it is simply the representation theory of the Lorentz group that is responsible for the stability of their masses. In either of these cases mass must arise from interactions of the field with a scalar (very broadly defined) as in the Higgs mechanism, which can pair up chiral spinors together and lend vectors another degree of freedom. But a massless scalar and a massive scalar have the same number of degrees of freedom. If we want a scalar mass to be technically natural, it must come from some symmetry past simply the Lorentz group. We'll see some examples of how to arrange this in Chapter 3.

It was common to speak of having to 're-tune the parameters at every order in perturbation theory', as if imagining an algorithmic process where one first computed a treelevel prediction, tuned that to be correct, and then computed the one-loop corrections, re-tuned those parameters to get it right again, etc. This is framed as being 'worse' than just requiring 'one' set of tunings. This is moronic, for the simple physical reason that Nature does not compute via perturbation theory. There is a physical problem, which is how to get the electroweak scale out of other physical parameters in the theory. Whether you compute the predictions in perturbation theory, or on a lattice, or whilst standing on your head is immaterial. and we don't have experimental measurements of \u03bb telling us the value is not that perfect value to get our light scalar. One might thus object that there's no fundamental inconsistency, and as long as our theory can fit the data anything else is just philosophy.",

In the Ptolemaic model, this was dealt with by adding an epicycle, the suggestion that the heavenly bodies moved on smaller circular orbits about their circular orbit around the Earth. As astronomical observations became more and more detailed over the ensuing centuries, multiple layers of epicyclic motion were needed to explain the data-circles on circles on circles, as depicted in Figure 2 .1.

So we have a large Bayesian update factor. While these measures of naturalness are useful to help us clarify our expectations, we emphasize again that they must be used sensibly.

The physics which can destabilize the Higgs mass must, as seen in the above example, both be heavier than the Higgs and interact with it in order to generate a contribution. Since the Higgs mass in the SM is not technically natural (that is, it is UV sensitive), large mass corrections from such particles are generic, as we saw in Section 1.3. One can explore the idea that perhaps there are no such particles. This faces a number of challenges. The first difficulty is that we know there must be new physics. The Standard Model does not explain neutrino masses nor dark matter, though it is possible that both of these be resolved without introducing new heavy particles. But a deeper issue is that we know the SM cannot be a fundamental theory because the Landau pole in hypercharge makes it inconsistent. This demands that something must happen to rid the theory of this pole, and it will interact with the Higgs because the Higgs is hypercharged. This is one motivation for thinking that something like Grand Unification must take place, and of course its breaking introduces a heavy fundamental scale. One can try to get around this by appealing to quantum gravity coming in at scales below that of the Landau pole.",

While true, the point from Section 2.2.3 is that the sensitivity to UV physics is so general that we expect to need a mechanism which stabilizes the Higgs mass to whatever new heavy physics is out there. Our toy calculation of the relative naturalness of SUSY already evinces this point-SUSY tamps UV sensitivity no matter what it is, so the details of the UV completion are immaterial. As a result of this idea, we will mostly worry just about finding a way to produce a light scalar and assume that it can be embedded into whatever physics exists at high scales, rather than committing to a particular framework of grand unification or what have you. Of course it's possible that interesting mechanisms to produce an IR scale do rely on particular properties of the UV, and we'll discuss this important idea in Section 4.3. But even there, our initial goal is simply to produce a light scalar which is compatible with the Standard Model, rather than to write down a full theory of the universe on all scales. If we can first solve the problem in a toy model which shares some features of our universe, then we can hope to abstract what we learn from that to solve the real problem.",

However see [121] for the interesting possibility that at high energies only the up-type Yukawa interactions exist, and the down-type and charged lepton masses are induced by supersymmetry-breaking. try breaking, rather than explicitly putting it in by hand, since we want the far UV to be supersymmetric. Such spontaneous breaking requires the generation of a scale, and so it would be great if such a scale were generated dynamically, as in the dimensional transmutation we saw in QCD in Section 1.3.3. This would then be a natural mechanism for SUSY breaking. This phenomenological prospect lead to and benefited from a fantastic body of work understanding the details of supersymmetric gauge theories e.g. [147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157] , which can be found reviewed in textbooks by Terning [111] and Shifman [158] and in TASI notes by Strassler [159] .",

This leads to a variety of fascinating signatures and constraints, even in the absence of concrete model of quantum gravity, though embeddings into string theory have also been found [175, 176, 177] . Very generically there are corrections to the Newtonian gravitational laws [178] , all sorts of effects on precision observables [179] , a loss of flux of high energy particles into the ambient space either astrophysically [180] or at a collider [144] , violations of the global symmetries of the SM since quantum gravity does not respect them [181, 182, 183] , and production of Kaluza-Klein gravitons [184] and black holes at TeV-scale colliders [185, 186, 187, 188] . This is a fascinating field which is well worth studying in detail, but unfortunately we do not have the space to do it justice.

Imagine a 5-dimensional gauge field with free action For another example of the usefulness of orbifolding, consider a five dimensional theory with the minimal amount of supersymmetry and we want to ensure our fourdimensional theory has only N = 1 supersymmetry. First let's recall why we cannot have more than N = 1 in four dimensions. As emphasized above, the SM is a chiral theory, wherein the different chiral components of its Dirac fields are in different gauge symmetry representations. This means that N = 2 supersymmetry in four dimensions is too much for us, since the irreducible representations of super-Poincar\u00e9 in that case don't allow for chiral matter. In particular, the N = 2 vector multiplet must transform in the adjoint, and the N = 2 hypermultiplet must transform in a real representation in order for it to be CPT self-conjugate, which means the two Weyl fermions must transform in conjugate representations.

So for each N = 1 superfield we want to have, we need to arrange for it to be even under the parity, and so have a zero-mode, and its partner superfield to be odd under the parity, and so only have n > 1 Kaluza-Klein modes.

In particular this means we can choose different embeddings of the Z 2 in the full symmetry on the two ends y = 0, \u03c0R [200, 201] . Now let's apply this technology to the N = 2 case we considered above. We saw we had two different choices for nontrivial embeddings of the N = 2 into the R-symmetry to break the supersymmetry down to N = 1 at the boundary. These correspond to choosing which half of the fields are even under the Z 2 and so get zero-modes. Now that we have independent Z 2 s on either end, we can choose these to leave different N = 1 symmetries unbroken.",

Each of these must be massless by five-dimensional gauge-invariance above the scale 1/R, but below that they can pick up mass corrections up to that cutoff. Either of these possibilities then amounts to a mechanism for UV protection of a scalar mass. In implementing this in the SM, the first possibility is known as the Higgs being a radion-the scalar which controls fluctuations of the size of the fifth dimension, h\u2212\u03b4h = h = 1/R, and the latter is denoted 'gauge-Higgs unification' for obvious reasons. A particular motivation for gauge-Higgs unification is as an extension of the strategy of grand unification. As mentioned in Section 1, the SM gauge bosons and fermions beautifully fit into representations of larger gauge groups, but in 4d GUTs the Higgs is left out in the cold as an extra puzzle piece. But 'grand gauge-Higgs unification' in higher dimensions may allow even further frugality of ingredients [207, 208, 209, 210] .",

Then it's important to explore the possibility of a natural structure which dictates v/f < 1-while there has been much work on this, we mention in particular the interesting strategy of 'collective' symmetry breaking in which a symmetry is broken only by an interplay between different couplings. This class of models is known as the 'Little Higgs' [261, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268] , and can be seen as a purely four-dimensional application of the strategy of nonlocal symmetry breaking through 'nonlocality in theory space' [269, 270] , which is a fascinating topic.

            "text": "Finally, let me mention that composite Higgs models may be understood as being dual to a novel class of extra-dimensional models known as Randall-Sundrum models [272, 273] . Unlike in the simple cases we discussed in Section 3.2, in these models the spacetime does not have a product structure (as did M 4 \u00d7 K) and the geometry is said to be 'non-factorizable'. In this scenario our four-dimensional universe is seen as a brane living on one end of a five-dimensional orbifold of anti-de Sitter space. The minuteness of the electroweak scale compared to the Planck scale is a result of a large fifth-dimensional AdS 'warp factor' between the brane we live on (the 'IR brane') and the brane on the other end of the space (the 'UV brane'). As in Section 3.2.2, this trades the electroweak hierarchy into a geometric hierarchy, but now in AdS we can find novel, natural ways of generating such a hierarchy of scales [274, 275] . Furthermore, embedding our universe into an AdS spacetime means we can take advantage of the enormously powerful program of AdS/CFT holography, which enables us to study the strong-coupling phenomena of composite Higgs models via their weakly-coupled gravitational duals. Pedagogical introductions to holography can be found in lecture notes from Sundrum [276] and Kaplan [277] , and with more background in the textbook by Ammon & Erdmenger [278] . That machinery is not all necessary to appreciate the workings of Randall-Sundrum models, though, and there are a wide variety of great lectures notes aimed at particle theorists, for example those of Sundrum [279] , Csaki & Tanedo [280] , and Gherghetta [281] .",

Depending on how much background in particle physics one has this statement may seem more or less heretical, but the idea is not as radical as it may at first seem-for one reason, the cosmological constant problem has inspired sporadic reexaminations of the validity of effective field theory in our universe for decades. There have been important attempts to address the cosmological constant problem with a violation of effective field theory, from Coleman's suggestion [311] that nonlocality induced by wormholes may allow the early universe to be sensitive to late-time requirements to Cohen-Kaplan-Nelson's suggestion [312] that the Bekenstein bound demands an infrared cutoff on the validity of any EFT. From one perspective, our suggestion to extend this philosophy to the hierarchy problem appears natural in light of its apparent need in cosmology.

While these constraints could be avoided if the two sectors were at radically different tempera- In this work we take an alternative approach and investigate ways in which early universe cosmology can reconcile the mirror Twin Higgs with current CMB and BBN observations. In doing so, we find compelling scenarios that transfer the signatures of electroweak naturalness from high-energy colliders to cosmology. We consider several possibilities in which the energy density of the light particles in the twin sector is diluted by the out-of-equilibrium decay of a new particle after the two sectors have thermally decoupled. Crucially, the new physics in the early universe respects the exact (albeit spontaneously broken) Z 2 exchange symmetry of the mirror Twin Higgs. This symmetry may be used to classify representations of the particle responsible for this dilution. We concentrate on two minimal cases: In the first, the long-lived particle is Z 2 -even and the asymmetry is naturally induced by kinematics. In the second, there is a pair of particles which are exchanged by the Z 2 symmetry and which may be responsible for inflation. 24 Moreover, in these cases the new physics does not merely reconcile the existence of a mirror twin sector with cosmological constraints, but predicts contributions to cosmological observables that may be probed in current and future CMB experiments. This raises the prospect of discovering evidence of electroweak naturalness first through cosmology, rather than colliders, and provides natural targets for future cosmological constraints on minimal realizations of neutral naturalness.",

The lightest of these, namely the twin photon and twin neutrinos, contribute significantly to the energy density of the early universe around the era of matter-radiation equality, since they have a temperature comparable to that of the Standard Model plasma at all times.

More precisely, thermal decoupling will occur once the rate at which energy can be exchanged between SM and twin particles (through the Higgs) falls below Thermal decoupling is traditionally formulated from the Boltzmann equations describing the evolution of single-particle phase space number densities, wherein collisions induce instantaneous changes to the shape of these distributions. When the collisions occur faster than the expansion rate, the phase space probability density functions of the interacting species are expected to relax to an equilibrium distribution (Boltzmann, neglecting quantum statistics, will be applicable to our case). However, once the rate of collisions falls below the expansion rate, collisions become rare on cosmological time scales and the phase space distributions depart from equilibrium. The decoupling temperature is determined as that at which the scattering rate of a participating particle, \u0393, drops below the Hubble rate, assuming that this occurs instantaneously across the entire phase space where the number density is significant.

Since the decay rates of top quarks or weak bosons are fast compared to their scattering rate and the Hubble rate, energy transferred to them is instantaneously transferred to the rest of the plasma. Similarly, the scattering rate of lighter fermions off other particles of the same sector (such as photons or gluons) is much faster than their interaction rate with twin fermions. Energy transferred to the lighter fermions therefore quickly diffuses throughout their respective plasmas. The rate of heat flow between sectors may therefore be well approximated by the rate at which energy is transferred from SM particles to twin particles in Higgs mediated interactions. This may occur through elastic scattering of SM particles off twin particles or annihilations of SM particle/antiparticle pairs into twin particles (or the reverse).

As long as the energy exchange rate exceeds the expansion rate, the sectors will be thermalised and have the same temperature. Decoupling then occurs once this rate drops below the Hubble rate. From Figure 5 .2, this occurs at a temperature \u223c 2 GeV. However, even after the energy exchange rate drops below the Hubble rate, the sectors will remain at the same temperature unless some event that either injects or redistributes entropy occurs within a sector (such as the temperature dropping below a mass threshold). As the heavy quark masses roughly coincide with the decoupling temperature, these do cause the twin sector to be mildly reheated with respect to the SM below decoupling. However, the resulting temperature difference is small and the energy exchange rates are expected to continue to be well-approximated by the rates presented in Figure 5 When the twin sector is colder than the SM (which will be important for much of what follows) the heat flow is typically dominated by annihilations of SM into twin particles. However, the energy exchange from elastic scattering can be comparable to that from annihilations, as illustrated in Figure 5 .2. Although the energy exchange in an annihilation will generally exceed that of a scattering because all of the energy involved in the process must be transferred, the annihilation rate also becomes more Boltzmann or threshold suppressed when the temperature drops below the mass of the heavier twin particles.

For example, at temperatures below the twin sector QCDPT, which occurs at \u223c 1 + log( f v ) higher temperatures than in the SM, the partonic calculation of twin quark/anti-quark pair production must be replaced by a hadronic one. Furthermore, the growth of the twin strong coupling necessitates that the quark-Higgs Yukawa couplings be RG evolved to the scale of the energy exchanged, which can induce an O(1) change to the cross section, although this has only a relatively small effect on the decoupling temperature.

The reason for this is roughly that, although the greater expansion rate induced by the extra radiation reduces the time that CMB photons have to diffuse before decoupling, it also reduces the sound horizon size more severely. As the angular size of the sound horizon is determined by the location of the acoustic peaks and is also well measured, the reduction in the sound horizon must be compensated for by a reduction in the angular diameter distance to the CMB. This effectively raises the angular distance over which photon diffusion proceeds and results in a prediction of smoother temperature anisotropies at small scales. This correspondence with the Silk damping allows N eff to be approximately factorised from other parameters and constrained independently, providing a direct observational avenue for detecting the presence of new, massless fields [374] (see [376] for further implications for model building). This relationship arises because the fixing of a eq implies that N eff effectively determines the energy density of the universe, and hence the Hubble rate, during CMB decoupling. Note, however, that further extensions of \u039bCDM may complicate this correspondence, in particular deviations from the standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis prediction of the primordial helium abundance.",

However, it is not expected that improvements in bounds on the former will be made from improved measurements of the primary CMB itself, differently with f /v). As is plainly evident, the mirror Twin Higgs is ruled out cosmologically, no matter the choices of neutrino masses one makes, if only for the presence of the twin photon. In the standard cosmology, the twin sector will have roughly the same temperature as the SM, giving 4.6 \u2206N eff 6.3 for f /v < 10, according to the definition of (5.20). This range depends upon f /v through the twin neutrino decoupling temperature (5.18), which determines the extent to which the twin photons are reheated relative to the twin neutrinos after twin electron/positron annihilations. This is sufficiently large that even the cold dark matter fraction cannot be adjusted to keep matter-radiation equality fixed, resulting inevitably in changes to the height and shape of the first acoustic peak.",

Resonant decay into gluons from bottomonia mixing has been neglected, although these resonant mass ranges are expected to be only \u223c MeV wide at the CP-even, spin-0 bottomonia masses m X = m \u03c7 bi (see [393] and [394] ). It should be noted, however, that at temperatures above that of the QCD phase transition, the quark decay products behave differently compared to that expected in a low temperature environment. In particular, for hot enough temperatures, the b or c quarks may not hadronise and the partonic partial widths may more reliable. The applicability of the treatment of the flavour thresholds used here may therefore not be valid if the decay occurs in the hot early universe. However, it is only very close to the threshold itself (within several GeV) that this uncertainty becomes significant. Finally, quark masses have been neglected in the gluon partial width. For m X close to the flavour thresholds, this approximation breaks down, but the gluon branching fraction is only \u223c 10% and so the error does not contribute to the uncertainty of the total width by more than this order (it is this uncertainty that is responsible for most of the extension of the length of the gray bands about the flavour threshold).",

If the coupling is too weak to begin with, then the X never thermalises and thermal production cannot happen. Thermal production therefore requires a careful balancing of parameters -small coupling \u03bb x is preferred for X to freeze-out hot and as early as possible, but the coupling is bounded from below by the requirement that X reach thermal equilibrium.

However, even with only one period, inflation can continue for long enough after the inflaton turns the corner in field space such that, at late times, the fraction of the inflaton in the B state relative to the A state is small enough that the expected energy densities that are transferred into each sector satisfy \u03c1 B /\u03c1 A < 0.1.

This asymmetric reheating would dilute the twin energy density and so attune the MTH with the cosmological constraints. This dilution of twin energy density to negligible levels would seem to hamper the prospect that twin states might constitute the dark matter, and generating dark matter was left as an open question. This presents a major challenge toward making such cosmologies realistic. However, we show that asymmetric reheating perfectly sets the stage for a MTH realization of the 'freeze-in' mechanism for dark matter production [406, 407, 408, 409, 410, 411, 412, 413] .",

For example, [405] uses late, out-of-equilibrium decays of right-handed neutrinos, while [13] uses those of a scalar singlet. These new particles respect the Z 2 , but dominantly decay to SM states due to the already-present soft Z 2 -breaking in the scalar sector. In [405] , this is solely due to extra suppression by f /v-heavier mediators, while in [13] , the scalar also preferentially mass-mixes with the heavier twin Higgs. [13] also presented a toy model of 'Twinflation', where a softly-broken Z 2 -symmetric scalar sector may lead to inflationary reheating which asymmetrically reheats the two sectors to different temperatures. In any of these scenarios, the twin sector We will stay agnostic about the particular mechanism at play, and merely assume that by T \u223c 1 GeV, the Higgs portal interactions have become inefficient and some mechanism of asymmetric reheating has occurred such that the energy density in the twin sector has been largely depleted, \u03c1 twin \u2248 0. 27 This is consistent with the results of the decoupling calculation in [13] given the uncertainties in the rates at low temperatures, and will certainly be true once one gets down to few \u00d7 10 2 MeV.",

In Appendix A, we discuss at some length the vanishing of infrared contributions to kinetic mixing through few loop order. If nonzero 28 Note that twin charged states do not couple to the SM photon. Their coupling to the SM Z boson has no impact on freeze-in at the temperatures under consideration. Furthermore, the miniscule kinetic mixing necessary for freeze-in has negligible effects at collider experiments. See Ref. [418] for details. 29 While we are breaking the Z 2 symmetry by a relevant operator, the extent to which a Stueckelberg mass is truly soft breaking is not clear. Taking solely Eq. (5.52), we would have more degrees of freedom in the twin sector than in the SM, and in a given UV completion it may be difficult to isolate this Z 2asymmetry from the Higgs potential. One possible fix may be to add an extremely tiny, experimentally allowed Stueckelberg mass for the SM photon as well [419] , though we note this may be in violation of quantum gravity [420, 421] or simply be difficult to realize in UV completions without extreme finetuning. We will remain agnostic about this UV issue and continue to refer to this as 'soft breaking', following [418] .",

Above the mass of the twin photon, freeze-in proceeds through the marginal kinetic mixing operator, and so a naive classification would say this is IR dominated. However, below the mass of the twin photon, the clearest approach is to integrate out the twin photon, to find that freeze-in then proceeds through an irrelevant, dimension-six, four-Fermi operator which is suppressed by the twin photon mass. Thus, at temperatures T SM m \u03b3 , this freeze-in looks UV dominated. This leads to the conclusion that the freeze-in rate is largest at temperatures around the mass of the twin photon. Indeed, this is generally true of freeze-in -production occurs mainly at temperatures near the largest relevant scale in the process, whether that be the largest mass out of the bath particles, mediator, and dark matter, or the starting thermal bath temperature itself in the case that one of the preceding masses is even higher.",

Specifically, we limit ourselves to m \u03b3 < 2m \u03c0 0 , both for this reason and to avoid uncertainties in the behavior of thermal pions during the epoch of the QCD phase transition. However, we emphasize that freeze-in will remain a viable option for producing a twin DM abundance for even heavier dark photons. But the fact that the freeze-in abundance will be generated simultaneously with asymmetric reheating demands that each sort of asymmetric reheating scenario must then be treated separately. Despite the additional difficulty involved in predicting the abundance for larger twin photon masses, it would be interesting to explore this part of parameter space. In particular, it would be interesting to consider concrete scenarios with twin photons in the range of tens of GeV [422] .",

Understanding a consistent cosmological history for this model is therefore crucial, and an important step was taken in [13, 405] . As opposed to prior work, the cosmology of the MTH was remedied without hard breaking of the Z 2 symmetry by utilizing asymmetric reheating to dilute the twin energy density. Keeping the Z 2 as a good symmetry should simplify the task of writing high energy completions of these theories, but low-scale reheating may slightly complicate cosmology at early times. These works left as open questions how to set up cosmological epochs such as dark matter generation and baryogenesis in such models. We have here found that at least one of these questions has a natural answer.",

This requires extending the mirror twin Higgs minimally with a single free parameter: the twin photon mass. Freezing-in the observed DM abundance pins the required kinetic mixing to a level expected from infrared contributions in MTH models. In fact, the prospect of calculating the kinetic mixing generated in the MTH could make this an effectively parameter-free extension of the MTH. Compared to generic freeze-in scenarios, it is interesting in this case that the \"just so\" stories of feeble coupling and negligible initial density were already present for reasons entirely orthogonal to dark matter.",

As we will see, there are two natural avenues for improved sensitivity at future lepton colliders: improved vertex resolution potentially increases sensitivity to LLPs with relatively short lifetimes, while lower backgrounds and a cleaner detector environment improves sensitivity to Higgs decays into lighter LLPs whose decay products are collimated.",

Full cut tables for both irreducible backgrounds and a variety of representative signal parameter points appear in Tables 6.1 and 6.2, respectively. We next identify candidate secondary vertices using a depth-first 'clustering' algorithm, which roughly emulates that performed in the CMS search [468] . We perform this clustering using all particles in the event because at later points in the analysis we need this truth-level assignment of neutral particles to clusters, but we expect that this (admittedly unrealistic) inclusion does not significantly modify the performance of this algorithm. Beginning with a single particle as the 'seed' particle for our algorithm, we look through all other particles in the event and create a 'cluster' of particles consisting of the seed particle and any others whose origins are within cluster = 7 \u00b5m (the projected tracker resolution of CEPC [440] ) of the seed particle. We then add to that cluster any particles whose origins are within cluster of any origins of particles in the cluster, and do this step iteratively until no further particles are added to the cluster. We then choose a new seed particle which has not yet been assigned to a cluster and begin this clustering process again. We repeat this process until all particles in the event have been assigned to clusters. We assign to each cluster a location d cluster which is the average of the origins of all charged particles in the cluster. To ensure that our events contain displaced vertices, we impose a minimum bound on the displacement from the interaction point | d cluster | > d min , and clusters satisfying this requirement constitute candidate secondary vertices. For our 'large mass' analysis we set d min to be the impact parameter resolution ( 5 \u00b5m for both CEPC and FCC-ee [440] ), and so retain sensitivity to very short X lifetimes. For our 'long lifetime' analysis we set d min = 3 cm, which removes the vast majority of clusters coming from B hadron decays in background events, as seen in we are limited to Pythia objects, but to mock up the (small) penalty to signal of such a selection we implement a selection on the total invariant mass of the clusters M 2 cluster \u2261 ( i\u2208 cluster p \u00b5 i ) 2 .

These limits are competitive with LHC forecasts based on conventional Higgs triggers [353, 352] , noting that these latter forecasts assume zero background. However, the lepton collider limits are potentially superseded by an efficient CMS track trigger [459, 460] for higher-mass LLPs, again assuming zero background is achievable with high signal efficiency across a range of lifetimes. In this respect, the primary strengths of the Higgs factories in searching for exotic Higgs decays to LLPs are the potential to push down to shorter decay lengths and lighter LLPs. In particular, the relatively clean and low-background environment of lepton colliders should enable efficient LLP searches even when the LLP decay products become collimated, which remains a weakness of the corresponding LHC searches.

In this case the novel effects of UV/IR mixing in fact only appear in nonplanar loop diagrams [493] and care is required when interpreting EFT constraints on Lorentz violation-a point we will emphasize in Section 7.2. Even so, it is difficult to imagine that observed properties of the weak scale and the wide range of constraints on Lorentz violation leave room for NCFT to be directly relevant to puzzles of the Standard Model.",

As the fermion is taken above the cutoff, an effective theorist again sees effects past those observed in Wilsonian EFT. These results are expected, but this model affords us a concrete demonstration that UV/IR mixing can only have interesting low-energy effects if the field theory is UV sensitive, and puts this naturalness strategy in stark contrast to conventional approaches. Of course, this also makes addressing the hierarchy problem with UV/IR mixing a potentially Pyrrhic victory: to generate an IR scale, the field theory alone cannot be fully predictive.",

The triviality of this task for tree-level graphs leads to the interesting feature that tree-level amplitudes on noncommutative spaces are the same as on commutative manifolds, and it is only at looplevel that we find deviations.

            "text": "This failure of unitarity is well-understood from the stringy perspective. Spatial noncommutativity appears from a background magnetic field and the field theory limit to a spacelike NCFT is smooth [339] . In the case of timelike noncommutativity, however, approaching the field theory limit forces an electric field to supercritical values whence pair-production of charged strings destabilizes the vacuum [504] . Within the realm of field theory, there have long been suggestions that this difficulty is pointing to the need for a modified definition of quantum field theories on timelike noncommutative spaces (for some early references, see [520, 521, 522, 523, 524, 525, 526, 527] ). From this perspective, the issue is that such field theories are non-local in time, which renders nonsensical the normal time-ordering involved in the perturbative Dyson series (at the least). That is, our effective definition of these theories above via the diagrammatic expansion may be too na\u00efve. An interesting line of work is to formulate a modification of the standard quantum field theory machinery to non-local-in-time theories which avoids the unitarity issue by construction. We note that the same UV/IR mixing effects of interest in the two-point function have been seen to persist in at least some of these approaches (e.g. [522] ). For some recent work on the formulation and properties of nonlocal field theories, see e.g. [528, 529, 530, 498, 531, 532] .",

Renormalizability has been proven for modifications of NCFTs where the free action is supplemented by an additional term which adjusts its long-distance behavior. Such an action is manufactured either by requiring it manifest 'Langman-Szabo' duality [536] p \u00b5 \u2194 2(\u03b8 \u22121 ) \u00b5\u03bd x \u03bd [537, 538] or by adding a 1/p\u2022p term to the free Lagrangian [539] , the latter of which directly has the interpretation of adding 'somewhere to put the 1/p \u2022 p counterterm'.

            "text": "One may then wonder if the lightness of the new IR pole may be understood through the regularization performed by the Lee-Wick field, as is done for the Higgs in the 'Lee-Wick standard model' [543] . However, in that theory the Higgs is kept light because every particle comes with a Lee-Wick partner, and so all diagrams contributing to corrections to the Higgs mass are made finite. The presence of the Higgs' Lee-Wick partner alone is not enough to keep it light. Here, the lightness of \u03c7 can be understood diagrammatically as being simply due to the fact that its only interaction is linear mixing with \u03c6, and so any correction to its two-point function is absorbed into that of the two-point function of \u03c6. A further issue with the Lee-Wick rewriting is that the seeming perturbative unitary of the theory is normally guaranteed by the Lee-Wick partner being heavy and unstable. But as we take the \u039b \u2192 \u221e limit in our Wilsonian action, we see that the Lee-Wick partner becomes massless as well, in accordance with the result that this theory is non-unitary [499] . 43 We note that in matrix models containing dynamical noncommutative geometries it has been argued that emergent infrared singularities should be associated with the dynamics of the geometry (see e.g. [544, 489] ). As our field theories are formulated on fixed noncommutative backgrounds, this interpretation is unavailable to us. 44 Note that this peculiar connection regarding (in)accessibility is due to the Lorentz violation. While the normal pole which is inaccessible in Euclidean signature becomes accessible for timelike momenta in Lorentzian signature, the Wick rotation affects the noncommutative momentum contraction differently. When taking x 4 \u2192 \u2212ix 0 , one also rotates \u03b8 4\u03bd \u2192 \u2212i\u03b8 0\u03bd such that Equation 7.1 continues to hold for the same numerical \u03b8 \u00b5\u03bd . For the simplest configuration of full-rank noncommutativity with \u03b8 \u00b5\u03bd block-off-diagonal and only one eigenvalue 1/\u039b 2 \u03b8 , the Euclidean p \u2022 p = p 2 /\u039b 4 \u03b8 becomes a Lorentzian p \u2022 p = (p 2 0 \u2212 p 2 1 + p 2 2 + p 2 3 )/\u039b 4 \u03b8 . So a noncommutative pole which is inaccessible in the Euclidean theory becomes accessible in the Lorentzian theory for spacelike momenta, while a noncommutative pole which can be accessed in the Euclidean theory becomes accessible in the s-channel in Lorentzian signature. divergences are instead absorbed into the running of \u03c6 parameters-and so no interactions are generated. Furthermore one is obstructed from integrating out the heavy field \u03c6 to come up with an effective action of \u03c7 at low energies by the fact that the kinetic terms of \u03c7 are non-standard, which prevents diagonalization of the quadratic terms in the Lagrangian. Thus it seems it is intrinsically linked with the heavy scalar which begat it.",

In 48 Noncommutative QED also has strange behavior in the gauge sector that runs counter to strong UV/IR duality-the photon self-energy correction gains an infrared singularity from nonplanar one-loop diagrams, even though the commutative quadratic power-counting divergence is forbidden by gaugeinvariance. The theory is constructed in detail in [558] , while more physical interpretation is given in [559] , and the possible relation to geometric dynamics in the context of matrix models is discussed in [544] . 49 Aspects of noncommutative Yukawa theory have also been studied recently in d=3 in [561] , and with a modified form of noncommuativity in [562] . the analysis of [560] , only the g 2 interaction was included. As a result, it was concluded that this theory contains no nonplanar diagrams at one loop, and the first appear at two loops as in Figure 7 .1. This immediately tells us that the one-loop quadratic divergence of the scalar self-energy will not appear with a one-loop IR singularity, and so rules out the putative strong UV/IR duality of the theory they studied. However, we must ask whether we actually have the freedom to choose g 1 and g 2 independently. To address that question, we must understand the role of discrete symmetries in noncommutative theories. For ease of reference we here repeat our definition of the noncommutativity parameter",

The argument is that charged particles in noncommutative space act in some senses like dipoles whose dipole moment is proportional to \u03b8, and so charge conjugation should naturally reverse these dipole moments. Here, however, our particles are uncharged, and thus we have no basis for arguing in this manner. Furthermore, such an anomalous transformation makes charge conjugation relate theories on different noncommutative spaces M \u03b8 \u2192 M \u2212\u03b8 . The heuristic picture of the CPT theorem (that is, the reason we care about CPT being a symmetry of our physical theories) is that after Wick rotating to Euclidean space, such a transformation belongs to the connected component of the Euclidean rotation group [568] , and so is effectively a symmetry of spacetime. So it is at the least not clear that defining a CPT transformation that takes one to a different space accords with the reason CPT should be satisfied in the first place. The 'symmetrization' of the momenta of the internal propagators is an important calculational simplification. This calculation is textbook save for our Schwinger-space regularization, so we will be brief and merely point out the salient features. The sum of these diagrams gives",

We then phenomenologically examine the loop integration appearing in our NCFT calculations to diagnose what caused the appearance of the IR pole. This will lead us to discuss an avenue toward investigating (or manufacturing) such effects in nonlocal, Lorentz-invariant theories.",

The presence of an exponential of momenta was clearly crucial, and this implies a necessity of nonlocality. It's also clear that the modification of the cutoff in the nonplanar diagrams \u039b \u2192 \u039b eff , which rendered the diagrams UV finite in a way that brought UV/IR mixing, was a result of the contraction between the loop momentum and the external momentum. Less obviously, one may see that any quadratic term in loop momentum in the exponential would have erased this feature, as after momentum integration one would find an integrand \u223c 1 1+\u03b1 + , and any divergence will have disappeared. Heuristically, the quadratic suppression in loop momentum is too strong and regulates the UV divergence entirely independently of the cutoff, so no UV/IR mixing appears. NCFT disallows such terms as a result of momentum contractions being performed with an antisymmetric tensor, and this particular mechanism seems to imply the necessity of Lorentz invariance violation. However, this argument only considers small deviations from the form of the integral in NCFT. Further discussions of the form of loop integrals with generalizations of the star-product may be found in [581, 582] .",

That such theories should exist can be broadly motivated by quantum gravity, as any gravitational theory is expected both to be nonlocal and to have UV/IR mixing. That Lorentz violation should be present is less clear. A particularly interesting line of development is to then understand in detail the class of nonlocal theories that would have UV/IR mixing of a sort similar to that discussed here. Recent work toward placing nonlocal quantum field theories on solid theoretical ground [498, 532] is clearly of sharp interest here, though the larger goal is quite distinct. The nonlocality studied in these works is designed to render the field theory UV-finite, and so the nonlocal vertex kernels are chosen precisely to avoid the introduction of new poles by ensuring these are momentum-space entire functions which vanish rapidly in Euclidean directions. The nonlocal vertices of NCFT manage to introduce new poles by oscillating as p \u2192 \u221e, which presumably allows for the appearance of new 'endpoint singularities' [588, 589] , though a full examination of the Landau equations in NCFT has not (to our knowledge) been performed. Our interest is thus in a disjoint class of nonlocal theories, where new poles can appear in interesting ways.

In the noncommutative theory, the presence of both inequivalent Yukawa couplings implies the same strong UV/IR duality exhibited by real \u03c6 4 theory: a quadratic divergence in the one-loop correction to the scalar mass from fermion loops gives rise to a simple IR pole, while a logarithmic UV divergence in the one-loop correction to the fermion mass from scalar loops give rise to only a logarithmic IR divergence.

These fields have likewise turned their focus toward alternative mechanisms in the past few years as a result of the lack of observational evidence for their standard solutions. But these facts all make the universe a more exciting place to study. Imagine if we had found weak-scale supersymmetry at the LHC, and our job now was simply to interpret the data in terms of which of the supersymmetric extensions proposed and well-studied in the past decades were correct. Or even worse, if technicolor had really been the answer and we had to watch Nature repeat the same trick she used at the strong scale again at the weak scale. How dreadfully boring!

Contrariwise, the coefficients of the infinite number of possible irrelevant operators are UV-insensitive, being determined primarily by the IR physics of the relevant and marginal operators. That is, the RG flows are attracted to a finite-dimensional submanifold of the space of Lagrangians. Consider a Wilsonian RG flow where we start off, as above, by specifying a cutoff \u039b 0 and the values of coefficients \u03bb i 0 of all the n marginal and relevant operators at that scale, as well as the coefficients c i 0 of however many irrelevant operators we wish to turn on. We can then flow downwards in energy as normal, and at an energy scale \u039b R \u039b 0 let's say we measure the relevant and marginal coefficients \u03bb i R at that scale. The coefficients of the irrelevant operators are then dominated by the infrared \u03bb i R and \u039b R up to precision (\u039b R /\u039b 0 ) \u2206 i from subleading corrections, with \u2206 i > 0 the scaling dimension of the irrelevant operator.

For concreteness, if \u03c3 0 = 10 \u22123 , y 0 = \u22125 and \u039b = 10 5 m, then (using the full one-loop RG), we have \u03c3(\u039b) 0.55 and y(\u039b) 4.16. How are we to ensure these values at \u039b? We know how to produce small numbers, but not incredibly specific ones. To see that we do need to produce these values very precisely, let's switch directions and consider the RG evolution down in energy from \u039b to m. In the theory with solely \u03c6, the coupling \u03c3 runs incredibly slowly, so an O(1) change in \u03c3(\u039b), evolved down to the scale m, results in an O(1) change to \u03c3(m). But in the theory with two sources of breaking, \u03c3(m) is enormously sensitive to the values of the couplings at \u039b. With the same cutoff \u039b = 10 5 m, if we very slightly change the input value to \u03c3(\u039b) = 0.56 and leave y(\u039b) as above, evolving down now gives us \u03c3(m) 10 \u22122 -a < 2% change in input parameters has resulted in a 1000% change in our low energy observable!

Physically one can imagine that the observed values of such couplings come from the vacuum expectation values of some heavy fields which are above the cutoff of the theory.

The Guidice-Barbieri measure would thus produce \u2206 \u03b8 UV 1, as the measured value is insensitive to small changes in the UV value. And yet, the small theta angle is regarded as a naturalness problem, which can be justified in a Bayesian approach. The necessity of a prior does help quantify one's surprise at the small value of \u03b8 in the context of the Standard Model, but to really think about naturalness we need to have a comparison. We know of simple theories which produce vanishing \u03b8 starting from generic values of the parameters-for example, an axion naturally produces \u03b8 = 0. Then if we have new data which pushes down the upper bound on \u03b8, axion models receive large Bayesian update factors in relation to the Standard Model. When we know of a simple model which automatically explains some data, it's puzzling if our current model requires precise choices for free parameters in order to explain the data. We can see these notions play out for the hierarchy problem by comparing our toy model of a GUT to one with weak-scale supersymmetry. Our toy model in Section 2.2.1 produced a scalar through a cancellation of GUT-scale \u223c 10 16 GeV contributions. A toy model with supersymmetry (to be discussed in Section 3.1) would remove sensitivity to the ultraviolet, and replace the scale of GUT-breaking with the effective scale of supersymmetry-breaking in the SM sectorm. And while the GUT scale is (more or less) fixed by the running of SM couplings, the SUSY-breaking scale in the SM can be far lower. We usem here as a one-parameter avatar of the scale of superpartners. The general prediction for supersymmetry before the LHC wasm \u223c O(100 GeV), with multiple species of superpartners appearing below the TeV scale. Such a model produces an improvement in Giudice-Barbieri tuning of \u03b4\u2206 \u223c 10 28 over our model without SUSY.",

The general lesson is that models which don't predict new visible states near the weak scale have received large Bayesian update factors from the LHC. This doesn't give a strict mandate for our overall relative belief, as one may argue there are good reasons to take a large prior for supersymmetry and expect always to find superpartners right around the corner. After all, even ifm \u223c 1000 TeV, it would still have \u03b4\u2206 \u223c 10 20 Giudice-Barbieri tuning better than the GUT without SUSY. But it does motivate further investigation of models which don't succumb to this issue, be they neutral naturalness modules which push the scale of new visible states up by a loop factor or more radical ideas about the origin of the electroweak scale. Furthermore, we can directly input physics into making a sensible choice of the prior one places on a model, and there has been much discussion of justifying simple choices. The dictum of Dirac naturalness mandates priors peaked at O(1) values. But with a model which makes some parameter technically natural one, a prior that allows small values is justified, such as a logarithmic prior. An explicit example of this modification of priors by physics can be seen in the application of the Weak Gravity Conjecture to the hierarchy problem[97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,11,5,105], which will be discussed in more detail in Section 4.3.1. This mechanism explicitly modifies the prior one should have on UV theories by linking the notion of the Swampland-that some string vacua don't admit universes like ours-to the allowed range of Higgs masses. This addresses the hierarchy problem by constructing a model where the priors are forced by UV physics to favor a light Higgs.",

The (unique) minimum of the Twin Higgs potential (4.1) occurs at v A \u2248 alignment of the vacuum in the H B direction occurs if \u03c3 \u2248 \u03ba, which has been assumed in these expressions for the minimum. The consequences of this arethat v A \u2248 v/ \u221a 2 and v B \u2248 f / \u221a 2 v (where v is the vev of the SM Higgs, although v A \u2248 174GeV is the vev that determines the SM particle masses and electroweak properties), so that the SM-likeHiggs h is identified with the Goldstone mode and is naturally lighter than the other remaining real scalar, a radial mode H whose mass is set by the scale f .The component of h in the h B gauge eigenstate is \u03b4 hB \u2248 v/f (to lowest order in v/f ). Measurements of the Higgs couplings restrict f 3v [290, 289], and the Giudice-Barbieri tuning of the weak scale associated with this asymmetry is of order f 2 /2v 2 . The spectrum of states in the broken phase consists of a SM-like pseudo-Goldstone Higgs h of mass m 2 h \u223c 8\u03bav 2 , a radial twin Higgs mode H of mass m 2 H \u223c 2\u03bbf 2 , a conventional Standard Model sector of gauge bosons and fermions and a corresponding mirror sector. The masses of quarks, gauge bosons, and charged leptons in the twin sector are larger than their Standard Model counterparts by \u223c f /v, while the twin QCD scale is larger by a factor \u223c (1 + log(f /v)) due to the impact of the higher mass scale of heavy twin quarks on the renormalisation group (RG) evolution of the twin strong coupling. The relative mass of twin neutrinos depends on the origin of neutrino masses, some possibilities being \u223c f /v for Dirac masses and \u223c f 2 /v 2 for Majorana masses from the Weinberg operator. Mixing in the scalar sector implies that the SM-like Higgs couples to twin sector matter with an O(v/f ) mixing angle, as does the radial twin Higgs mode to Standard Model matter. These mixings provide the primary portal between the Standard Model and twin sectors. The Goldstone Higgs is protected from radiative corrections from Z 2 -symmetric physics above the scale f . While the mirror Twin Higgs addresses the little hierarchy problem, it does not address the big hierarchy problem, as nothing stabilizes the scale f against radiative corrections. However, the scale f can be stabilized by supersymmetry, compositeness, or perhaps additional copies of the twin mechanism [291] without requiring new states beneath the TeV scale. Minimal supersymmetric UV completions can furthermore remain perturbative up to the GUT scale[292,293].As mentioned, the collider constraints on twin Higgs models are very mild and pertain mostly to a lower bound on the soft breaking of the Z 2 . In this respect, the Twin Higgs naturally reconciles the observation of a light Higgs with the absence of evidence for new physics thus far at the LHC. The primary challenge to these models comes from cosmology due to the effects of additional light particles on the cosmic microwave background. We will discuss these issues in Chapter 5 and propose a natural resolution.4.1.2 Neutral Naturalness or The Return Of The OrbifoldMore broadly, the twin Higgs is just the simplest example of the more general 'Neutral Naturalness' paradigm in which the states responsible for stabilizing the electroweak scale are not charged under (some of) the Standard Model (SM) gauge symmetries[288,294,295,296,297,298,299,300,301,302,303,304,305], thus explaining the lack of expected signposts of naturalness.In the symmetry-based solutions to the hierarchy problem discussed in Chapter 3, modifications of the Higgs mass were technically natural as a result of a continuous symmetry which commuted with the SM gauge groups. This na\u00efvely seems necessary to ensure that the necessary degrees of freedom are present and couple to the Higgs with the right strength to cancel divergences. How is the top quark contribution \u221d N c y t (where N c is the number of colors) to be canceled if not by another colored particle with the same coupling to the Higgs, which gives the opposite contribution?

This revived the twin Higgs as a solution to the little hierarchy problem, and their 'fraternal' version brought about many interesting phenomenological possibilities.The 'fraternal twin Higgs' has a twin sector consisting-at energies below its cutoffsolely of the third generation of fermions, and with ungauged twin hypercharge. This brilliantly removes all light particles from the spectrum, so their effects would not cause trouble in the early universe. But this approach leaves perhaps a niggling unpleasant taste for those worried about parsimony. Yes the fraternal twin Higgs introduces fewer new particles than the mirror twin Higgs, so a na\u00efve desire to solve problems with few ingredients might suggest that this is a windfall. However, the mirror twin Higgs really consists of only two 'ingredients': a Z 2 symmetry and some soft breaking to misalign the resulting Higgs vevs-whereas the fraternal twin Higgs has much more structure.While those statements seem to be of a very subjective sort, we can ground this unease in physics by considering what's needed to UV-complete such a model. At the cutoff of this model \u039b \u223c 10 TeV, we need the Z 2 to still be a relatively good symmetry among the largest couplings in the twin sector-that is, the gauge couplings g 2 , g 3 and the top Yukawa y t -such that the cancellation of contributions from the two sectors to the Higgs potential works well. Yet in other parts of the theory we have done great violence to the structure of the theory, having broken twin hypercharge and removed parts of the spectrum. How are we to ensure firstly that the correct degrees of freedom gain large masses, and secondly that this does not radiatively feed into the remaining light degrees of freedom?In the midst of this digression, I should mention a terminological confusion. In the literature, the phrase 'mirror twin Higgs' often refers to models in which the full collection of twin degrees of freedom are present in the low-energy theory, regardless of how much Z 2 -breaking is present. Judicious introduction of such asymmetries has been used to create models which avoid cosmological issues by making all the twin fermions heavy, while still staying within the technical definition of the mirror twin Higgs. But this is an overreliance on a definition; the fraternal twin Higgs is merely a limit of these theories in which the Z 2 -breaking is severe enough to push some degrees of freedom above the cutoff. The real distinction between classes of Neutral Naturalness models should be between those which break the Z 2 only minimally and those which do greater violence to the symmetry. It is this distinction which classifies the difficulty involved in finding a UV completion.Now let me emphasize that this is not to undercut the value of such a model. After all, the Yukawa interactions in the Standard Model badly break the large global symmetries it would otherwise have. Indeed, the fraternal twin Higgs showcased interesting phenomena, pointed to new general experimental probes, and provided a basis for many intriguing lines of research.",

The rate of heat flow that the top quarks and weak bosons can mediate at these temperatures (or below) is negligible because of Boltzmann suppression. The bend in the curves at temperatures \u223c 5 GeV in the lower plot corresponds to a transition from temperatures where the dominant energy exchange rate is through scatterings to those where it occurs through annihilations, as can be seen in the upper plot. The annihilation rate into twin bottom quarks is the dominant component at high enough energies (again because of the larger Yukawa coupling), but this becomes rapidly threshold suppressed as the temperature drops. As can also be inferred in the upper plot, the energy exchange rate through annihilations involving the twin charmed quarks and tau leptons overtakes that of twin bottom quarks at similar temperature, but are still subdominant to scatterings. The decoupling temperature depends upon f /v, which sets both the mass scale of the twin sector and the strength of the Higgs-mediated coupling.

In the case of out-of-equilibrium decays, we have found that decays of Z 2 -even scalars sufficiently dilute the energy density in the twin sector without the addition of any new sources of Z 2 -breaking. In much of the parameter space, the residual contribution to \u2206N eff is directly proportional to the ratio of vacuum expectation values v 2 /f 2 parameterizing the mixing between Standard Model and twin sectors (as well as the tuning of the electroweak scale), and may be within reach of CMB-S4 experiments. In the case of twinflation, we have found that a (broken) Z 2 -symmetric inflationary sector may successfully dilute the energy density in the twin sector, as well as potentially leave signatures in the form of a step in the primordial power spectrum or in departures of primordial perturbations from adiabaticity and Gaussianity. In both cases, these models raise the tantalizing possibility that signatures of electroweak naturalness may first emerge in the CMB, rather than the LHC. There are a variety of possible directions for future work. Here we have focused on the cosmological consequences of late-decaying scalars and twinned inflationary sectors without specifying their origin in a microscopic model. It would be interesting to construct complete models (where, e.g., supersymmetry or compositeness protect the scale f from UV contributions) in which the existence and couplings of late-decaying scalars arise as intrinsic ingredients of the UV completion.

Rather than relying on existing public fast simulation tools, which do not necessarily give a sensible parameterization of signal and background efficiencies for long-lived particle searches, we have implemented a realistic approach to clustering and isolation. This allows us to characterize some of the leading irreducible Standard Model backgrounds to our search and determine reasonable analysis cuts necessary for a zero-background analysis. We obtain forecasts for the potential reach of CEPC and FCC-ee on the Higgs branching ratio to long-lived particles with a range of lifetimes. The projected reach is competitive withLHC forecasts and potentially superior for lower LLP masses and shorter lifetimes. In addition to our branching ratio limits, which may be freely interpreted in a variety of model frameworks, we interpret our results in the parameter space of a Higgs portal Hidden Valley and various incarnations of neutral naturalness, demonstrating the complementarity between direct searches for LLPs and precision Higgs coupling measurements. There are a variety of directions for future work. While we have attempted to investigate some of the leading irreducible backgrounds and impose realistic cuts, we have not attempted to estimate possible backgrounds coming from cosmic rays; algorithmic, detector, or beam effects; or other contributions.

Details on these calculational steps are laid out in Srednicki's Chapter 14, but there's an important and na\u00efvely surprising feature of the above that we should discuss.In previous sections our regularization scheme explicitly introduced a mass scale \u039b which we could think of as having a physical interpretation as some sort of short-distance cutoff, if we wished. We then saw that by cleverly studying how the parameters in the theory are modified as we change \u039b and demand the physics stays the same, we could make a variety of things easier to calculate and make the physical content of the theory more transparent. Note that in doing so, we're stretching the meaning of the scale \u039b away slightly from that physical picture-we don't care what the 'real' cutoff of our system is, or if there really is any sort of cutoff; we simply know that allowing such scale-dependence in our couplings and studying the theory at different values of \u039b makes our lives easier, so we imagine varying it.Now the way this new regularization scheme works is somewhat opaque, but it still necessitates the introduction of a new scale. In this case, the unphysical scale \u00b5 is required to ensure that our couplings remain dimensionless away from d = 4. This scheme thus invites us to further broaden our notion of varying a scale to study the theory at different energies-this time the scale explicitly never had a physical interpretation. We can view \u00b5 as labeling a one-parameter family of calculational schemes. We've ensured by construction that the physics is the same no matter what \u00b5 we choose, but by cleverly using the scale-dependence we can make our lives far easier. The intuition should be the same as in the previous case, and lowering \u00b5 does likewise transfer loop-level physics to tree-level physics and can be used to improve the convergence of perturbative calculations.",

But rather than revealing to us which TeV-scale new physics kept the Higgs light, we've instead had a march of increasingly powerful constraints on new particles which couple to the Standard Model.These null results for physics beyond the Standard Model from run 1 of the LHC rapidly popularized the idea that something else might be responsible for stabilizing the Higgs mass at the electroweak scale up to a higher scale where, say, supersymmetry came in. This line of thinking is termed the 'Little Hierarchy Problem'-the idea being that one of those classic solutions would appear at \u039b \u223c 10 TeV to solve the 'Big Hierarchy Problem' and explain why the Higgs mass was not at the Planck scale, leaving a smaller hierarchy of a couple orders of magnitude between m H and \u039b unexplained.

If global symmetries could be exact, then we could create a big black hole with an arbitrary global charge, and wait a very very long time while it Hawking evaporates down to the Planck scale. Unlike gauge charges, the global charge does not affect the metric, so the black hole does not shed this charge as it evaporates. We then end up with a Planck-sized black hole with an arbitrarily large global charge, which would necessitate the existence of arbitrarily-many black hole microstates for a fixed-mass black hole. But this is a disaster! Now if we have a gauge symmetry, there are no longer Planck-sized black holes with arbitrarily large charge because there is an extremality bound: g|Q| \u2264 M/M pl , with Q the gauge charge and M the mass, in units of the gauge coupling g and the Planck mass.This sort of reasoning motivated Arkani-Hamed, Motl, Nicolis, and Vafa to conjecture that just as quantum gravitational theories must not have exact global symmetries, they must also suffer some physical malady which disallows the limit where Abelian gauge symmetries become global symmetries.
