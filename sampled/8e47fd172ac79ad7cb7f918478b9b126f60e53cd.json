After adjustment for significant covariates, we identified 6 independent predictors of NOAF, including age >70 years (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12 to 2.00), hypertension (HR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.91), left atrial volume index $40 ml/m 2 (HR: 2.03; 95% CI: 1.48 to 2.77), PALS <18% (HR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.18 to 2.17), HF with preserved ejection fraction (HR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.95), and no beta-blocker prescription at discharge (HR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.92). A weighted score based on these variables was used to create a composite score, HAS-BAP (H \u00bc hypertension; A \u00bc age; S \u00bc PALS; B \u00bc no beta-blocker prescription at discharge; A \u00bc atrial volume index; P \u00bc HF with preserved ejection fraction [range 0 to 6] with a median of 3 [interquartile range: 2 to 4]). The probability of NOAF increased with HAS-BAP score. CONCLUSIONS In patients with HF and sinus rhythm, 16.1% developed NOAF, and PALS could be used to predict the risk for NOAF.

Standard techniques were used in accordance with the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines (13) . In brief, echocardiographic images were obtained and analyzed using Image-Arena, version 4.6 (Tomtec Imaging System, Munich, Germany), a vendor-independent program that allows strain analysis, at the strain core laboratory (14, 15) . Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine the optimal cutoffs for PALS to predict the 5-year NOAF using the Youden index. The In receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis, the area under the curve of the PALS to predict NOAF was 0.56 (95% CI: 0.53 to 0.59; p < 0.001) with the best cutoff value of 18%. Using this cutoff value, patients with PALS #18% had a higher 5-year NOAF than those with PALS >18% (Figure 2A ). In addition, PALS #18% was associated with a 1.72 hazard for NOAF (HR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.23 to 1.98; p < 0.001).",

Nonetheless, we reported that patients with HF without AF had an increased risk of stroke, and the risk increased with CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score (22) . Considering the high stroke risk in HF with apparent sinus rhythm, one should consider the possibility of NOAF and/or paroxysmal AF. Thus, it might be interesting to investigate whether patients with a high HAS-BAP score may benefit from anticoagulation therapy. In addition, whether the HAS-BAP score can predict the outcomes after radiofrequency catheter ablation should also be considered when designing future studies. Using a vendor independent software (Tomtec Imaging System, Munich, Germany), they measured PALS using the mean value from 2 apical views using R-R gating. The authors are to be commended for a meticulously performed study with a high feasibility of LA strain performance. They demonstrated that approximately 16% of patients developed NOAF and that PALS #18% independently predicted new AF, among other risk factors. By using linear-by-linear association analysis, an intuitive scoring system (called the HASBAP score: H \u00bc hypertension; A \u00bc age; S \u00bc PALS #18%; B \u00bc no beta-blocker prescription at discharge; A \u00bc atrial volume index >40 ml/m 2 ; P \u00bc HF with preserved ejection fraction) to predict NOAF risk was constructed based on the aforementioned 6 risk factors (range 0 to 6).

A major determinant of LA expansion is LV systolic contraction with downward displacement toward the apex (5, 8) . Therefore, any condition that influences LV myocardial function is expected to influence PALS. Strain, being a measure of deformation, is also influenced by baseline LA enlargement, which, all else being equal, would be expected to result in reduced PALS (8) . There is also evidence that PALS is higher in women and lower in the presence of increasing age and higher blood pressure (9) . Thus, although having a single cutoff value is desirable, it seems to be an oversimplification because it may not fully capture how the aforementioned variables influence strain measurements. Indeed, as an example in the present study (6) , applying the same PALS cutoff value (#18%) to those with normal LA volumes (<40 ml/m 2 ) did not appear to significantly influence the risk of new AF.",

These scores, the original personalized medicine, permit patient-specific prediction via weighted combination of all available data. The question is, is there a need for yet another scoring system? Before there is adoption of this score to routine use, its prognostic value needs to be externally validated. In addition, the clinical benefit of some form of early intervention (e.g., with anticoagulation therapy) for those with an increased HAS-BAP score has to be established. Two prior multicenter, randomized trials have shown no convincing evidence that anticoagulation using vitamin K antagonists reduces mortality or vascular events in patients with HF in sinus rhythm (10, 11) . Nevertheless, the study with CAD (8) and/or HF with either reduced (9) or preserved (10) resting left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) (11, 12) . A \"wet lung\" with appearance or increasing B-lines is more often found with ischemic regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) and/or diastolic dysfunction associated with increase in pulmonary wedge pressure (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) .",

One concern is that there may not be enough speckles to accurately track LA deformation because the atrial walls are only 1 to 2 mm thick. Another potential limitation is that the continuity of the LA wall is interrupted by the orifices of the LA appendage and each of the pulmonary veins; speckles cannot be tracked in these regions.

We demonstrate the following: 1) ECV rather than native T 1 can be a better surrogate marker for detecting histological CVF in HFpEF cohorts; 2) global native T 1 and ECV, but not native T 1 and ECV in the septal myocardium, similarly correlate well with the beta of passive LV chamber irrespective of patients at risk of HFpEF or with clinically manifest. Although the underlying pathophysiology of HFpEF is multifactorial, cellular changes at myocardial tissue level such as diffuse myocardial fibrosis may precede clinical HFpEF diagnosis and therefore can be a potential therapeutic target. However, the prevalence of moderate-tosevere renal dysfunction in patients with chronic heart failure has ranged from 30% to 60% in large clinical studies (29) . Furthermore, there are recent safety concerns regarding GBCA deposition in the brain and other organs (14) , and GBCA is contraindicated in patients with moderate-to-severe renal dysfunction. Given that GBCA retention is also related to the number of doses administered over time (30) , repeated GBCA use for CMR scans, particularly when closely spaced, needs to be minimized or avoided. Native T 1 mapping can be derived without a need for GBCA and has the potential to follow serial changes in the myocardium over time and be useful for cost-effectively identifying patients with HFpEF who are at risk for adverse events. Further studies are needed to determine whether CMR T 1 mapping assessment provides better risk KEY WORDS cardiovascular magnetic resonance, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, histological collagen volume fraction, left ventricular stiffness, native T 1 Omori et al.

In patients without HF, obesity and increases in visceral adipose tissue are associated with heightened intramyocardial fat content, which is also associated with increased ECV content (7), as well as abnormalities in myocardial metabolism (4) . It would be interesting and important to further evaluate these relationships in a cohort of patients with the obese phenotype of HFpEF in future studies.",

We know that expansion of this interstitial volume occurs in a wide variety of diseases producing fibrosis (macroscopic scar from old myocardial infarction or diffuse increase in collagen content from pressure overload) and in infiltrative diseases (e.g., amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, Fabry disease) (11, 12) . Traditionally, the study of myocardial interstitium has been the forte of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), which is able to use relaxation properties of protons to probe tissue architecture, but CT imaging has recently also been successfully deployed for this purpose. One of the strengths of using CT imaging is that the relationship between iodine and attenuation values is more linear and thus more accurate compared with the relationship between gadolinium and T1-shortening due to the rapid flux of protons. Furthermore, the study can be completed within 3 to 5 min with 2 breath-holds with superior spatial resolution, whereas a conventional CMR requires 30 to 45 min and w50 breathholds. CMR also has the well-known difficulties in patients with ferromagnetic materials or claustrophobia or lying supine for this length of time (which is often an issue in these older TAVR patients). Lastly, the ECV CT value can be obtained without the need to administer any additional iodinated contrast. Given the high prevalence of renal disease in this cohort, avoiding an additional CMR study that requires gadolinium administration and extra cost is an added benefit.",

Percentage of normal studies indicated for each score. Rouhani et al. Stress-first protocols have been adopted to improve patient experience, reduce radiation exposure, and optimize resource use. Specifically, stressfirst imaging has been shown to reduce radiation exposure to patients by 25% to 80% (16, 17) , and technologists and nurses by 40% to 50% (18) . As the current radiation reduction goal of ASNC is to reduce median doses to <9 mSv (9) , and a combination of stress-only imaging with CZT cameras is shown to achieve radiation reduction to 1 mSv (19, 20) , such protocols will assist in minimizing patient harm and meeting these goals (21) . By minimizing the need for rest imaging, this would potentially reduce cost and allow for increased patient throughput as well (16, 17) . Identifying patients that would potentially benefit from a stressfirst protocol would allow labs to achieve these goals. Integration of such models into an electronic medical record would improve patient selection and patient care.

We had anticipated this because, aside Previous studies investigated LA strain in AFD by speckle-tracking echocardiography but did not explore the relationship between LA dysfunction and severity of LV involvement ( Glycosphingolipid storage in the atrial myocardium has been previously reported in histological studies, regardless of LVH or enzyme replacement therapy (1, 4) . As observed in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, atrial myopathy in AFD seems to affect primarily LA compliance rather than atrial contractility. The atrial myopathy appears to progress in parallel with the ventricular features of AFD cardiomyopathy as well as its extracardiac manifestations, regardless of male sex or presence of a classic mutation.

The PALS was defined as the first peak positive deflection and is representative of the LA reservoir function. The PALS was calculated as the mean value of the global longitudinal strain from 2 apical views (4 and 2 chambers). We used R-R gating as the zeroreference point. STUDY VARIABLES AND DEFINITIONS. Based on echocardiographic findings at the index admission for acute HF, patients were categorized as having either HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (LVEF #40%) or HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (LVEF >40%) (16). NOAF was defined when patients had no previous history of AF, had no new AF during the index admission, and developed new AF during follow-up after discharge. The primary outcome of interest was NOAF during the 5-year follow-up. For the detection of AF, all electrocardiograms (ECGs) of each patient were reviewed.

A multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression was used to determine the independent predictors of NOAF. We included all variables found to be statistically significant (p < 0.10) in the univariate analysis as covariates in the multivariable analysis, excluding those having multicollinearity with other variables. Multicollinearity was tested with Pearson correlation and linear regression with correlation diagnostics. A significant multicollinearity was assumed if the variation inflation factor was >3.0. The proportional hazards assumption of each variable was tested with the Schoenfeld test. Patients with missing variables were excluded in the multivariable analysis. To determine whether the number of independent risk factors was linearly associated with the risk of NOAF, we compared the NOAF of the patients according to the number of independent predictors using a linear-by-linear association analysis and constructed a scoring system with weighting of each variable. A 2-sided p value of <0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. Statistical tests were performed using SPSS, version 22 (IBM, Armonk, New York) and R, version 3.3.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). RESULTS BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE STUDY POPULATION. Of the 4,312 patients who were included in the STRATS-AHF registry, we excluded 1,276 patients with prior AF, 61 patients with missing rhythm information, 273 patients without PALS, and 176 patients who were diagnosed with AF during the index admission, so that 2,461 patients with sinus rhythm were available for the final analysis. During the 5-year follow-up, 2,064 (83.9%) patients had sinus rhythm, and 397 (16.1%) had NOAF (Figure 1). The median time to NOAF was 170 days (IQR: 11 to 756 days).",

Should LA strain be routinely assessed to help identify patients who are at increased risk of NOAF? The study by Park et al. (6) in this issue of iJACC supports, that measuring LA strain may improve the prediction of AF in HF, although it remains to be seen if this would translate to improved clinical outcomes. In the meantime, there is little doubt in our minds that words by Sir Winston Churchill are true: \"To improve is to change, so to be perfect is to change often.\" The same applies to imaging of the LA, which continues to evolve. To perfect the assessment of the LA, we need to advance from relying solely on conventional echocardiographic volumetric assessments to incorporating parameters of LA function. Future studies will refine our approaches, and if LA strain is to become an accepted method for assessment of LA function, then standardized methodology, terminology (left atrial reservoir strain vs. PALS), common reference ranges, and the impact of different disease states on LA strain must be better understood.

(Stress Echo 2020-The International Stress Echo Study [SE2020]; NCT03049995) (J Am Coll Cardiol Img 2020;13:2085-95) \u00a9 2020 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation. T he B-profile of normal lung sliding with B-lines (also known as ultrasound lung comets) by lung ultrasound (LUS) identifies pulmonary congestion at rest (1) associated with a worse outcome in patients with heart failure (HF), acute myocardial infarction, or chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) (2-6). Tailored B-line-driven diuretic treatment of HF is associated with a reduction of acute decompensation events as shown by a randomized trial, with a number needed to treat of 5 (7). B-lines may also appear during physical or pharmacological stress in patients",

The chi-square or Fisher exact test was used to compare the distribution of categorical variables among groups. B-line response was evaluated as the number of B-lines (rest, peak, and their change from rest to peak). According to B-lines at peak stress, patients were divided into 4 different groups, with absent, mild, moderate, and severe B-lines. A pulmonary decongestion pattern (\"drying lung\") was defined as stress B-lines < rest B-lines for at least 2 points. Event-free survival related to the endpoints of interest was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and survival curves were compared with the log-rank test. Univariate Cox proportional hazards model were used to identify candidate predictors for selected endpoints.

The final multivariable models were obtained excluding just those variables causing collinearity evaluated using the variance inflation factor.

All CMR images were acquired using a 3-T scanner (Ingenia 3T, Philips Medical System, Best, the Netherlands) equipped with dS coils. The CMR protocol included cine CMR, T 1 mapping using a modified Look-Locker inversion recovery (MOLLI) sequence before contrast, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) CMR using a bolus injection of Gd-DOTA (Magnescope, Guerbet, Japan) at a dose of 0.15 mmol/kg, and T 1 mapping by MOLLI after contrast. To assess LV volume and mass, 10 to 12 consecutive short-axis cine images and 2-, 3-and 4-chamber long-axis cine images were acquired using a steady-state free procession sequence. Pre-contrast T 1 mapping was then performed using a 17-heartbeat steady-state free procession, single-breath-hold 3-3-5 MOLLI sequence in 3 short-axis (base, mid cavity, and apex) and 2 long-axis imaging planes. Ten to 15 min after contrast medium injection, short-and long-axis 3-dimensional LGE CMR images were acquired with an inversion recovery gradient-echo imaging sequence. Postcontrast 3-3-5 MOLLI T 1 mapping was performed exactly as pre-contrast T by the consensus of 2 experienced investigators: a cardiologist and a radiologist. On cine MR images, epicardial and endocardial borders at end systole and end diastole were traced manually using short-axis stack images to determine LV end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume (ESV), and LV mass using multiple desk-derived measurements. The presence and pattern of LGE were visually assessed and the LGE volume was measured using the full width at one-half maximum method. A relatively large region of interest of 150 pixels or greater was placed on the myocardium without LGE enhancement, by avoiding contamination from the blood pool signal and artifacts due to misregistration errors. Based on this region of interest, native T 1 and ECV in the mid-septal myocardium were determined. In addition, using the 16-segment model of the American Heart Association, global T 1 and ECV values were measured. It was reported that the MOLLI sequence underestimates T 1",

Our study results are consistent with the recent studies by Ellims et al. (11) and Rommel et al. (12) who have reported that post-contrast T 1 or ECV predicts LV passive chamber stiffness using 1.5-T. The present study demonstrated that native myocardial T 1 mapping at 3-T can be an effective alternative method in predicting LV stiffness of HFpEF. Indeed, LV chamber stiffness is determined not only by interstitial fibrosis but also by intrinsic cardiomyocyte stiffening from titin phenotype shift or concentric geometric remodeling (6). Native T 1 measures the T 1 values from the extracellular and intracellular compartments and can also reflect a number of intracellular processes such as cardiomyocyte hypertrophy or stiffening, leading to slightly higher ability for predicting LV stiffness than ECV measurement. More importantly, global native T 1 rather than native T 1 in the septal myocardium correlated well with the beta of passive LV stiffness and had comparable ability to histological CVF in predicting LV stiffness. Global native T 1 assessment can detect the variety of cellular changes in the whole myocardium where endomyocardial biopsy has limited accuracy and may help detect passive LV chamber stiffness and provide insight of HFpEF heterogeneous pathophysiology. The present study substantially improves our understanding of the relationship between LV passive stiffness and invasive and noninvasive myocardial tissue characterization in HFpEF and enhances the ability of native T 1 in identifying the increased stiffness, which could ultimately provide better risk stratification in HFpEF.",

Native T 1 mapping provides comparable ability in predicting LV stiffness to ECV mapping and histological CVF, and may be useful for monitoring patients with HFpEF who also have renal dysfunction.

Ng, MBBS, PHD b H eart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) affects over one-half of patients with HF, and clinical trials published to date have failed to identify effective treatments(1,2). This failure is thought to be related to pathophysiologic heterogeneity within the syndrome. For example, some patients with a clinical diagnosis of HFpEF display an ischemic substrate caused by epicardial or microvascular coronary disease; others display intrinsic abnormalities in cardiac stiffness or metabolism; and still others display alterations in the extracellular matrix, with diffuse interstitial fibrosis. Some treatments such as diuretic agents might be effective for all of these patients, whereas others might be more targeted and specific to the underlying pathophysiology. This has led to the idea that patients with HFpEF ought to be categorized into phenotypes, but at this time, it remains unclear how this phenotyping should be done(2).Advanced cardiac imaging serves as a potential linchpin for any phenotyping approach in HFpEF (3).Echocardiography provides valuable information on cardiac morphology, function, and hemodynamics, but it is less well-suited to characterize myocardial composition. In contrast, cardiac magnetic resonance(CMR) may provide valuable insight into the tissue characteristics of the myocardium itself. In addition to providing precise measures of chamber volumes and mass, CMR allows for noninvasive characterization of myocardial energy metabolism, lipid content, and interstitial fibrosis (4-7). Pixel intensity on CMR is based on the relaxation of protons. The T 1 relaxation time is typically prolonged in fibrotic tissue in the absence of contrast (native T 1 ), but following contrast administration, the T 1 time is more markedly shortened in fibrotic tissue as compared to normal tissue. Thus by constructing a T 1 map of myocardium prior to and following contrast administration, one can obtain measures that correlate with interstitial fibrosis content: the post-contrast T 1 time (shorter time, more fibrosis); and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) (higher volume, more fibrosis). In patients with HFpEF and in cardiac transplant recipients, higher ECV and shorter post-contrast T 1 time have been correlated with gold standard invasive measures of LV diastolic stiffness determined by conductance catheter measurements (5,6). However, these studies did not include histopathologic assessments of myocardial fibrosis, and prior studies required the use of contrast, which cannot be administered to all patients with HF. In this issue of iJACC, Omori et al. (8) present the results of an interesting study where myocardial properties were definitively characterized by invasive hemodynamics, histopathology, and CMR. They assessed left ventricular (LV) chamber stiffness using gold standard methods, measuring pressure and volume across varying preloads during transient caval occlusion via the conductance catheter. Endomyocardial biopsies were taken from the right ventricular septum, with collagen volume fraction (CVF) determined by picrosirius red. Finally, CMR was performed with T 1 mapping using the modified Look-Locker inversion recovery sequence before and 15 min following contrast administration. A total 19 patients with HFpEF completed the study.

Global and septal native T 1 and ECV values were both increased compared with normal values, consistent with an increase in tissue fibrosis, and both were modestly correlated with histological CVF (r \u00bc w0.4 to 0.5), though ECV tended to show the stronger correlation. Global native T 1 and ECV were also moderately and similarly well-correlated with directly measured LV stiffness, with similar strength of correlation to histological CVF (r \u00bc 0.50 to 0.54, all p < 0.05). In a logistic regression analysis, native T 1 was equivalent to ECV to identify the presence of increased b (defined by 0.054), with area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.75 to 0.81. Omori et al. (8) conclude that native T 1 mapping provides comparable ability to predict LV stiffness to ECV in HFpEF, whereas ECV tends to track more closely with CVF in this cohort. Omori et al. (8) are to be commended for this important study, which both confirms and extends on earlier studies and identifies important new validation that ECV reflects the burden of interstitial fibrosis in HFpEF. These studies are technically demanding and difficult to perform, and a particular strength is the combination of robust invasive methods, human tissue histopathology, and state-ofthe-art CMR. It is extremely noteworthy that this information, at least in regard to LV stiffness, could be obtained without the use of contrast (using native T 1 ). This might have been related to the use of a 3.0-T magnet, rather than the 1.5-T magnet used in prior studies, and has important implications for more widespread use of CMR. The higher magnetic field strength on a 3.0-T system, compared with a 1.5-T magnet, will increase the native T 1 time, which could theoretically increase the sensitivity in detecting a difference in native T 1 times between different disease states (e.g., those with increased vs. normal LV stiffness",

In patients suspected of having stable coronary artery disease (CAD), those with ischemic cardiomyopathy represent a distinct, high-risk subgroup (3,4) and remain challenging to risk-stratify. Noninvasive imaging of patients with reduced LV function may be limited by thinned LV myocardial wall and multivessel disease with a propensity for balanced ischemia. In patients with heart failure and chest pain, the latest American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology guidelines continue to recommend a low threshold for the use of invasive angiography as a first-line test (5). Stress cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has been shown to be an effective prognostic tool in many clinical subgroups of patients with suspected CAD (6-9). It also has demonstrated high diagnostic utility in patients with left main stem or equivalent CAD (10). However, whether stress CMR can adequately risk-stratify patients with impaired LV systolic function remains unclear. We therefore conducted an analysis of patients with impaired LV ejection fraction (LVEF) referred for stress CMR for suspected myocardial ischemia, using a combined dataset from the multicenter SPINS (Stress CMR Perfusion Imaging in the United States) registry and a tertiary referral center.",

Primary aldosteronism (PA), because of excess aldosterone secretion by the adrenal glands, leads to hypokalemic hypertension (HTN) and increased prevalence of maladaptive left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy(6,7). PA is further associated with higher risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and atrial fibrillation compared with essential HTN alone(8,9). Moreover, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists were shown to decrease the risk of sudden death, progression toward heart failure, and cardiovascular mortality independently of BP levels in patients with LV systolic dysfunction(10). In patients with asymptomatic diastolic dysfunction, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy is associated with significant improvement in diastolic function and decreased circulating surrogate biomarkers of cardiac fibrosis(11). The relative contribution of the direct effects of aldosterone on target organ damage and fibrosis, including the heart, kidneys, and vessels, and those indirectly triggered via aldosterone-induced BP increase is not well individualized in humans (1).Currently, the diagnosis of cardiac involvement relies mainly on echocardiographic measures of LV morphology (i.e., hypertrophy: LV mass and thickness) and global ejection fraction, as well as volumedependent estimates of diastolic function. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), a reference technique to investigate cardiac function and geometry, also offers dense replacement myocardial fibrosis assessment by using late gadolinium enhancement, which has demonstrated prognostic value in various ischemic and nonischemic cardiac diseases(12,13). T1 relaxation mapping of the myocardial tissue provides quantitative assessment of intracellular and extracellular compartments of the myocardium. The latter was shown to be highly correlated with interstitial fibrosis quantified from myocardial biopsies(14,15).To decipher the respective roles of aldosterone and BP on myocardial hypertrophy and extracellular matrix remodeling on the human heart in vivo using CMR, we designed a 4-corner approach study including subjects with contrasting aldosterone and BP levels: 1) patients with PA with excess reninindependent aldosterone secretion by adrenal glands and high BP levels; 2) patients with Bartter/ Gitelman (BG) syndrome, a salt-losing autosomal recessive tubulopathy, characterized by renindependent hyperaldosteronism and normal BP levels; 3) patients with essential HTN and average aldosterone levels; and 4) healthy subjects (HS) with both normal aldosterone and BP levels.",

CMR at 1.5-T and vascular investigations were performed on the same day (extensive description of the method in the Supplemental Appendix). CMR ACQUISITIONS. CMR examinations included: 1) cine short-axis slices covering the LV and left atrium; 2) late gadolinium enhancement images, performed 10 min after intravenous injection of 0.2mmol/kg Gd-DTPA (Dotarem, Guerbet, France); 3) T1 mapping before contrast and 15 min after contrast injection, acquired in a single midventricular short-axis view using a modified Look-Locker inversion recovery sequence; and 4) phase contrast acquisitions of transmitral flow and basal myocardial longitudinal velocities, acquired as described previously for diastolic function assessment (20). ANALYSIS OF LV MORPHOLOGY AND FUNCTION. Cine steady-state free precession data were analyzed by the same operator blind to study groups, for the semiautomatic tracing of endocardial and epicardial contours on all contiguous short-axis slices during the end-diastolic and end-systolic phases, resulting in LV mass (LVM) and end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes. LV ejection fraction, stroke volume, and end-diastolic mass-to-volume ratio were further calculated. All measures of ventricular volumes and mass were indexed to body surface area, and LV hypertrophy was defined by an LVM index >95 g/m 2 in men and >85 g/m 2 in women (upper 95th percentile of local reference values in 200 healthy subjects). LV diastolic function assessment was performed from phase contrast acquisitions as previously described (20), resulting in early and late diastolic peaks of transmitral mean flow velocities, total transmitral filling volume, and early diastolic peak of myocardial longitudinal velocity. MYOCARDIAL TISSUE CHARACTERIZATION. For myocardial tissue characterization, all analyses were done blinded to study groups. Visual analysis for the presence or absence of late gadolinium enhancement was performed by an experienced operator. Inversion Recovery images were analyzed using a custom software that enabled T1 map estimation (21). Quantitative T1 analysis included interventricular septum and blood pool native and post-contrast T1 values, which were used for the estimation of the partition coefficient (l), calculated using a previously described formula: l \u00bc (post-contrast R1 myo \u00c0 native R1 myo ) / (post-contrast R1 LV-Cavity \u00c0 native R1 LV-cavity ) with R1 \u00bc 1 / T1. The extracellular volume (ECV) (%) was calculated as follows: (1 \u00c0 hematocrit) l. LV extracellular mass (ECM) was defined as ECM \u00bc LVM ECV (g) when intracellular mass was defined as intracellular mass (ICM) \u00bc LVM \u00c0 ECM (g) and intracellular volume (ICV) (%) as ICV\u00bc 100 \u00c0 ECV. Both ECM and ICM were indexed to body surface area, resulting in an ECM index (g/m 2 ) and ICM index (g/m 2 ). LABORATORY ASSAYS. Plasma renin; aldosterone; B-type natriuretic peptide; and biomarkers of collagen metabolism including TIMP1 (inhibitor of type 1 metalloproteinase), ICTP (C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen), PICP (C-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen), proMMP-1 (type 1 pro-matrix metalloproteinase), and PIIINP (N-terminal propeptide of type III collagen) were measured using commercially available kits (Supplemental Appendix).STATISTICAL ANALYSIS.

This effect remained significant between hypertensive subgroups after adjustment for mean BP.Aldosterone is a key determinant of cardiovascular disease, leading to heart failure through indirect effects on water and salt homeostasis increasing volemia, and BP, as well as has direct effects on the heart and vessels through activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor pathway. Compared with patients with HTN, patients with PA are likely to have more severe LV hypertrophy because of an increase in both myocyte size and extracellular matrix (fibrosis), as suggested by experimental animal studies(24). The main stimulus for cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is mechanical stress secondary to increased preload or afterload, whereas myocardial fibroblast stimuli depend on a balance between collagen synthesis and collagen degradation enzymes but may also be influenced by BP(25).

Higher ECM index found in patients with PA but not in patients with BG with secondary aldosteronism in a sodium-depleted state suggests a permissive effect of high BP on the profibrotic effect of aldosterone. Indeed, aldosterone remained a significant determinant of ECMi in hypertensive subjects (PA and HTN groups) independent of BP (Supplemental Tables 2 and 3).

This approach will be also promising in the future development of personalized therapeutic strategies.

ICA-determined CLs were co-registered to the coronary CTA precursor lesions using the distance from coronary ostia as well as bifurcations as fiduciary landmarks. MACHINE LEARNING. Model creation and feature selection. A total of 46 coronary CTA-based qualitative and quantitative plaque features were used in the ML model in order to create a predictive model of CLs (SupplementalTable 1). Models were then built usinga boosted ensemble algorithm (XGBoost), using an open-source XGBoost library. XGBoost uses an ensemble of gradient-boosted decision trees, and has been widely applied within the domains of computer science and medicine. The advantage of using a boosted ensemble algorithm is the fact that it can combine multiple weak classifiers to produce a single strong classifier, which can improve prediction modeling. The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method was used to explain the output of the ML model. The SHAP method assigns each variable animportance value for a particular prediction, and in this instance was used to order to determine the influence of a particular variable on CL prediction, as well as the direction of that association(17). Such a step provides insight into the inner workings of complex models, such as those created using ensemble methodologies, and strikes a balance between accuracy and interpretability.Model training. The total dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets in such a way that the ratio of CLs to non-CLs was maintained. This training set was further split into 10 folds while maintaining the ratio of CLs to non-CLs for grid search of model hyperparameters using 10-fold cross-validation.

The segment where an atherosclerotic lesion starts was the only ordinal variable in the top 20 features, while none of the high-risk plaque features were among the most predictive features. SHAP assigns each variable an importance value for CL prediction, as well as the direction of that association. SHAP provides information not only about how important a feature is in a particular prediction (vertical position), but also about whether the feature value was high or low for that dataset (color), and also whether the effect of that value resulted in a higher prediction (CL prediction) or lower prediction (non-CL prediction) (horizontal position). For example, higher values for the top feature (start of a lesion to minimal lumen diameter) were predictive of CL precursors, indicating that the length and location of baseline plaque influenced short-term plaque stability. Further, higher plaque burden was predictive of CL precursors, while lower plaque burden was predictive of being a non-CL (Figure 3). According to the feature ranking done by SHAP, baseline plaque location (\"Shape of a lesion to minimal lumen diameter\") and plaque volume factored higher than baseline luminal area stenosis in the maximal stenosis section.

These results were consistent across certain subgroups while the most predictive features were quantitative features. The unexpected finding regarding the poor performance of high-risk plaque for CL discrimination could be secondary to the fact that the derivation cohort included ACS patients, with previous investigations showing that even though high-risk plaque was an independent predictor of ACS, the cumulative number of lesions with and without high-risk plaque was similar in ACS cohorts, as compared with the low incidence of high-risk plaque in a non-ACS cohort (in our cohort, 40 of 126 [32.0%] of CLs had high-risk plaque, whereas 93 of 458 [20.3%] of the non-CLs had high-risk plaque) (19). The results of the present analysis are important, as they provide a better understanding of the relationship between computed tomography-determined plaque features (in terms of both qualitative and quantitative measures) and the presence of CL precursors in a high-risk cohort, albeit over a median follow-up interval of 865 days. It also provides a model featuring quantitative and qualitative plaque characteristics that can be used to determine plaque stability in a non-ACS cohort. Prior to the inception and adoption of invasive and noninvasive coronary imaging, a significant body of knowledge on the natural history of coronary atherosclerosis came from pathology studies demonstrating that an ACS event occurs as a result of atherosclerotic plaque erosion or rupture, which frequently occurs in the setting of thin-cap fibroatheromas that are characterized by the presence of a large necrotic core and covered with a thin fibrous cap (<65 mm) separating it from the coronary lumen (5).

As such, there has been keen interest in developing catheter-based imaging techniques for the detection of various anatomic components of thin-cap fibroatheromas, as well as metabolic processes of high-risk plaque, culminating in the application of intravascular ultrasound, near-infrared spectroscopy, and optical coherence tomography to visualize and characterize atherosclerotic plaque. For instance, the PROSPECT trial enrolled 697 patients with ACS who underwent 3-vessel coronary angiography as well as imaging after percutaneous coronary intervention (3). The PROSPECT trial showed that lesions at enrollment that were associated with subsequent events, at a median follow-up period of 3.4 years, were characterized by a minimal luminal area of #4.0 mm 2 and plaque burden of $70%, or were identified as thincap fibroatheromas. The VIVA (Virtual Histology in Vulnerable Atherosclerosis) study enrolled 170 patients with stable angina or troponin-positive ACS who underwent 3-vessel intravascular ultrasound (a total of 30,372 mm of intravascular ultrasound analyzed) and evaluated the association between intravascular ultrasound-identified thin-cap fibroatheromas and major adverse cardiac events(20).",

Despite the novelty of the conducted investigation, there are certain limitations that are noteworthy to mention. As previously described, individuals with ACS within the ICONIC study cohort had been selected from the larger observational CONFIRM registry investigation. As such, there could be unmeasured confounders with respect to patient selection as well as potentially other biases regarding the propensity-matching approach employed within the ICONIC study cohort, hence limiting the generalizability of the present findings. For example, the proximity of ACS events after CTA acquisition indicates that this referral population is at higher risk than the general population. Further, the impact of coronary CTA on decision making, including changes in medical therapy, is unclear. Thus, the current findings are mainly limited to a higher-risk patient population and cannot be generalized to stable angina or even asymptomatic patients. Second, quantitative plaque and luminal measures were performed with a semiautomated software (QAngio CT Research Edition version 2.1.9.1), a process that is laborious and not easily reproducible. Third, the median follow-up period after coronary CTA performance was 865 days, which is fairly short, especially when the endpoint is the occurrence of an ACS event on a patient level and the development of unstable plaque on a lesion level. It is possible that non-CLs could become culprits over longer follow-up, and it is uncertain whether the same plaque characteristics influence long-term plaque stability. Fourth, the results of the present study were not externally validated on a separate cohort. However, no cohort exists in which a primary prevention cohort underwent extensive baseline coronary CTA-derived qualitative and quantitative plaque assessment for suspected CAD and subsequently had CL adjudication on ICA as well as co-registration of CLs to the coronary CTA precursor lesions. Last, this study was limited to CLs that could be identified by a clinical committee, with the presence of significant diameter stenosis on ICA being the major driver for determining the presence of a CL. As such, the performance of this model in the setting of CLs that are nonobstructive, or lesions that lead to clinically silent events, is not known. The results of present analysis have several important clinical implications. First, with the increasing wealth of knowledge regarding the influence of qualitative and quantitative plaque analysis for future cardiovascular event prediction, there is an unmet need for advanced analytic approaches for data processing as well as precise and patient-tailored risk prediction. ML has been applied for assimilation of complex datasets for patient-level risk prediction, and this study shows that it is possible to integrate a multitude of qualitative and quantitative plaque characteristics for prediction of plaque stability. Second, there is inconsistency and significant variability regarding the acceptable definitions for high-risk plaque, with often arbitrary cutoff values used to define the presence or absence of such features. Our approach plots the influence of each value on the prediction of plaque stability, using the SHAP method, which can be used as a platform in future analysis for refined and more precise definition of high-risk features. Third, the ability to predict likely CLs in symptomatic high-risk patients could be useful for therapy selection and downstream testing. For instance, if the ML model predicts that a left main or proximal left anterior descending artery plaque might become a culprit, then a clinician may consider aggressive preventative therapies, regular follow-up, and performance of invasive evaluation in the setting of breakthrough symptoms. However, the utility of such an approach needs to be supported by evidence from clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS An ML approach incorporating coronary CTAdetermined qualitative and quantitative plaque features was better at predicting CL precursors compared with diameter stenosis or computed tomography-determined high-risk plaque features and was robust across several subgroups. Furthermore, it was accurate in ruling out the presence of CL precursors in a non-ACS cohort. This study highlights the utility of ML for predicting culprit from non-CL precursors in a high-risk cohort on coronary CTA. ADDRESS FOR CORRESPONDENCE: Dr. Subhi J.

PERSPECTIVES COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: An ML model that integrates coronary CTA-determined qualitative and quantitative plaque features showed improved detection of CL precursors in a high-risk cohort compared with contemporary risk assessment methods, and was robust across several subgroups including younger individuals (<65 years of age) and in the left anterior descending artery distribution. When applied to a non-ACS cohort, the model had a specificity of 89% for ruling out the presence of CL precursors. TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Future analysis is required in order to externally validate the ML model across various cohorts and to determine its generalizability. Such work has the potential to further enhance the ability for accurate phenotypic plaque characterization that precisely predicts at-risk individuals through the detection of CL precursors. Michelle C. Williams, MBCHB, PHD, David E. Newby, MD O ur understanding of atherosclerotic plaque is constantly evolving, as research has progressed from histological studies, through to invasive imaging, and now to noninvasive imaging with coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA). We know that risk stratification and management based on coronary CTA stenosis severity improves prediction of events and clinical outcomes (1). However, coronary CTA can assess much more than just stenosis severity, and the information provided from the assessment of atherosclerotic plaque and the surrounding tissues may be more important for prognostication and guiding management than for the presence of coronary artery stenoses (2). Early studies divided plaques into calcified, noncalcified, and mixed plaques, and showed that noncalcified plaques were more frequent in acute coronary syndrome culprit lesions. Subsequently, more detailed assessment of high-risk plaque characteristics identified positive remodeling, lowattenuation plaque, spotty calcification, and the napkin-ring sign as key features (3). The PROMISE (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain) and ROMICAT II (Rule Out Myocardial Infarction/Ischaemia using Computer Assisted Tomography II) trials found that high-risk plaques were associated with increases in major cardiovascular events. However, in the SCOT-HEART (Scottish COmputed Tomography of the HEART) trial, high-risk plaque characteristics also identified patients at increased risk of cardiovascular events, but this was not independent of coronary artery calcium score, a marker of plaque burden (2). This highlights that although visually identified high-risk plaques are important, other markers of overall plaque burden and composition are likely to be more useful. Several approaches are now available that can perform semiautomated assessment of the entire coronary artery tree, with plaque categorization based on attenuation density rather than qualitative visual categorization. Indeed, quantitative coronary CTA assessment of plaque is now a key endpoint in a number of therapeutic interventional trials. In the PARADIGM (Progression of Atherosclerotic Plaque Determined by Computed Tomographic Angiography Imaging) registry, quantitative plaque analysis on serial coronary CTA demonstrated that statin use was associated with a slower progression of plaque volume and a change in plaque composition, with decreased noncalcified plaque and increased calcified plaque (4). In the SCOT-HEART trial, quantitative coronary CTA assessment identified patients at increased risk of myocardial infarction or coronary heart disease death (5",

This research is a secondary analysis of the ICONIC (Incident COroNary Syndromes Identified by Computed Tomography) study, a nested case-control study from the CONFIRM (Coronary CT Angiography Evaluation for Clinical Outcomes: An International Multicenter) registry (7). In the ICONIC study, 234 patients who had undergone coronary CTA and subsequently developed an acute coronary syndrome were matched with 234 control subjects without acute coronary syndrome, and quantitative coronary CTA plaque analysis was performed (7). Patients with acute coronary syndrome had higher volumes of fibrofatty plaque, necrotic core, and cross-sectional plaque burden (7). Al'Aref et al. (6) trained and tested a machine learning model using data on 46 plaque variables from 124 patients with invasive coronary angiography-confirmed culprit lesions. The resulting model had an area under the curve for detecting culprit lesions of 0.774 (95% confidence interval: 0.758 to 0.790), which was higher than that obtained using traditional methods, including diameter stenosis, high-risk plaque features, or lesion-level plaque analysis. The model also had a specificity of 89% for predicting nonculprit lesions in the 234 patients without acute coronary syndrome. This paper is the latest machine learning analysis from the CONFIRM registry and represents the first to use quantitative plaque measures in a machine learning model. For many observers, machine learning is treated as a \"black box\" in which data are analyzed and results produced, without attempting to understand how or why. This has the potential to cause significant issues if systematic biases are introduced and not recognized. We commend the authors for their efforts to explain how the machine learning model was developed using the different variables. Al'Aref et al. (6) used the SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) methodology to provide an explanation of which parameters were the most important within their model. This is 1 of several methods that attempt to explain the results of machine learning models (so-called explainable machine learning). Currently, these methods will be unfamiliar to many, but as the use of machine learning in research studies becomes more prevalent, we will become more familiar with these new approaches. Interestingly, the results of the SHAP analysis showed that the most important parameter was the distance between the start of the lesion and the minimal lumen diameter, followed by plaque volume and then luminal area stenosis. This confirms results from previous invasive and noninvasive angiography studies showing that plaques, rather than stenoses, are more important in predicting the culprit lesion in patients undergoing subsequent acute coronary syndrome (7). Among the top 20 features used by the model, there were several quantitative coronary CTA measures, including the volume of dense calcium, fibrous plaque, and fibrous-fatty plaque. However, the low-attenuation plaque and visually assessed high-risk plaque features were not among the top 20 features. This is likely to reflect the nature of the cohort used to create the machine learning model as well as how the culprit lesions were defined: the maximum stenosis was used to define the culprit lesion if more than 1 lesion was a potential culprit. In addition, the number of patients used to train this machine learning model is rather small, leading to the potential for overfitting a model, which may not be representative. As the authors note, this machine learning model does require external validation. Subgroup analysis is another important method that can be used to assess the behavior of a machine learning model. Al'Aref et al. (6) found that the machine learning model was superior when stratifying patients by age and location of the culprit vessel.However, when assessing the impact of sex, they found that diameter stenosis performed better than the machine learning model for female patients (Cstatistic: 0.748 vs 0.835; p < 0.001). We know that there are differences in atherosclerotic plaque composition in men and women undergoing coronary CTA(8), and clearly, further research is required in this area.",

Recent work has shown a remarkably high prevalence (14% to 16%) of ATTR-CA in the elderly AS population being considered for TAVR (ASamyloid) (8,9). We do not yet fully understand the significance of this dual pathology, either for valve intervention or the role for specific amyloid therapies such as tafamidis (10), patisiran (11), and inotersen (12), but detection is likely to be important. Conventional first-line investigations for ATTR-CA, such as echocardiography, blood biomarkers, or electrocardiogram (ECG), are confounded by the dual pathology. ATTR-CA can now be diagnosed noninvasively by using bone scintigraphy, such as 99m Tc-3,3diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid (DPD), 99m Tc-pyrophosphate, and 99m Tc-hydroxymethylene diphosphonate, coupled with a negative search for a plasma cell dyscrasia (13). Although availability and awareness are increasing, it requires an extra test in elderly, often frail, patients. As part of routine TAVR evaluation, patients typically undergo contrast computed tomography (CT) imaging to assess annulus dimensions, coronary artery height (and patency, where possible), and vascular access. Contrast CT imaging can also be used to measure the myocardial extracellular volume (ECV) in a manner similar to cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)",

Recent research has shown just how common it is in elderly subjects with AS(8,9,33,34), but it is not limited to this population; indeed, 13% of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction may have underlying cardiac amyloid(35), and 5% of those with LV hypertrophy may have variant ATTR-CA (this study used genotyping to screen LV hypertrophy patients and thus will have missed those with wild-type ATTR-CA)(36). The clinical impact of myocardial amyloid deposition in these patients with AS, however, remains unclear. We know that there may be a long preclinical phase and that prevalence increases with age, becoming the primary cause of death in supercentenarians(37). The spectrum therefore potentially extends from \"bystander\" to the primary cause of symptoms and adverse outcome, depending on the time of diagnosis and the myocardial tolerance. In turn, these are likely to be affected by amyloid burden, rate of amyloid deposition, the ability of the myocardium to adapt, and other myocardial \"hits\" such as, in this case, the increased afterload from AS. These may not be independent (the prevalence of AS-amyloid seems to be higher than what would be expected from age alone, suggesting that there may be an interaction), with an increased likelihood of amyloid in the interstitium of myocardium with afterload. This uncertainty of significance cascades into our terminology, which is not fixed. Should this be AS-amyloidor amyloid-AS? Similarly, is it cardiac amyloidosis (implies pathological) or cardiac amyloid (might be bystander deposition)? Here we have chosen ASamyloid. These questions are about to become",

Furthermore, the need to combine information from 2 different measurement techniques is a potential barrier. STUDY LIMITATIONS. This was a single-center, single-vendor study. ECV CT performance on other vendors has not been assessed but should follow similar methodology. Focal ECV CT elevations were included in the calculated global ECV CT , and excluding these areas may increase performance. Our mean patient age was 86 years. Younger cohorts will have possibly lower rates of discovered AS-amyloid. This study is a CT technical development subset of a larger study (including, for example, only those patients who had not already had a CT scan at the time of recruitment); although prevalence and other clinical information informs, this is not the primary focus of this paper. Inline ECV CT software is not yet available, and the work presented here will need to be optimized for integration into the daily CT workflow. Although global longitudinal strain data were included in this study, unfortunately we did not have regional longitudinal strain data available at the time of submission, which may have proven additive in identifying cardiac amyloidosis. The relatively small number of patients with AS-amyloid in this study may also have affected our results. CONCLUSIONS Lone AS results in detectable increases in ECV CT compared with control subjects. ECV CT using a lowdose protocol, with a 3-min post-contrast acquisition, can detect AS-amyloid and grade its severity in the TAVR population, and it could be used as a screening tool in those patients already undergoing a clinically indicated CT scan. PERSPECTIVES COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Pre-TAVR cardiac CT scans can be used to quantify myocardial ECV using a low-dose protocol, with additional baseline and 3-min post-contrast acquisitions. TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK 1: ECV CT during routine CT TAVR evaluation can reliably detect AS-amyloid and track the degree of infiltration, offering a potential screening tool in patients already undergoing a clinically indicated CT scan. TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK 2: ECV CT is higher in lone AS compared with control subjects due to myocardial fibrosis.

KEY WORDS aortic stenosis, cardiac amyloidosis, computed tomography, extracellular volume APPENDIX For a supplemental figure and table, please see the online version of this paper. You can't teach an old dog new tricks\" -Old proverb (1) C ardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) debuted in the clinical arena in the late 1990s. Since then, it has become a vital tool to evaluate patients with coronary artery disease, before structural and electrophysiological interventions, cardiac masses, and a wide array of other cardiac conditions. Its excellent spatial resolution, noninvasive nature, wide availability, and short scan times have driven most of its clinical utility. In addition, recent data have shown the potential of CCTA to improve patient outcomes (2). Its role in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) planning and follow-up has become paramount owing to the wealth of data that can be obtained from the scan, including annular dimensions, coronary anatomy, and vascular and access site pathology. However, several recent technological advances have expanded its role beyond these conventional areas (3). These include the ability to interrogate the hemodynamic significance of coronary lesions with computational fluid dynamics, probe the details of vulnerable plaques and study their evolution over time, characterize myocardial disease with dual energy/spectral CT imaging, and quantify strain (4,5). As more and more aspects of cardiac pathology are being captured simultaneously within the same scan, CCTA is starting to provide a comprehensive look beyond just one aspect of the clinical question being asked (e.g., is there a coronary stenosis?) but also to provide a portfolio of answers pertaining to multiple facets of cardiac disease, without having to resort to additional imaging modalities (3). It is in this context that the paper by Scully et al. (6) in this issue of iJACC explores the value of CCTA in screening patients with aortic stenosis (AS) for coexisting cardiac amyloidosis (CA).",

            "text": ", the authors explored the value and diagnostic accuracy of ECV CT to noninvasively detect TTR-CA using another established imaging marker of myocardial amyloid infiltration (bone scintigraphy) as the gold standard (18). Cardiac uptake of 99m Tc-labeled bone tracers such as pyrophosphate or 3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid (DPD) has a high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing TTR-CA once plasma cell dyscrasia has been excluded with blood and urine testing for monoclonal protein (19). Perugini et al. (20) proposed a simple grading system (grade 0 to 3) of myocardial radiotracer uptake, with higher uptake indicating more myocardial amyloid deposition. A graded relationship between ECV CT and higher DPD-Perugini grades was noted by Scully et al. (6), signifying expansion of the extracellular compartment (32 AE 3% for grade 0 [i.e., patients with pure AS without CA] vs. 43 AE 6% for grade 2 [i.e., patients with both AS \u00fe CA]). In contrast, the ECV CT in 20 non-AS control patients was normal at 28 AE2%. Using grade 2 DPD uptake yielded an accuracy of 95% for ECV CT to diagnose TTR-CA, which is comparable to that seen for ECV CMR(21,22). The negative predictive value of an ECV CT value of <33.4% for grade 2 uptake was 100%. Another interesting observation was that the electrocardiography voltage/mass ratio also had a fairly robust accuracy of 87%. However, because one-third of their patients with CA had bundle branch block or ventricular pacing, this simple albeit powerful tool was not useful in such patients. Low electrocardiography voltage relative to increased left ventricular mass was first described in 1982, but it is now appreciated that up to 50% of patients with TTR-CA and 25%",

However, there is an increasing interest in stress-first and stress-only imaging to reduce patient radiation exposure and improve patient workflow and experience. Methods for identifying patients who are most likely to undergo successful stress-first imaging are required.

The objective of this study was to derive and validate a model that could be easily applied at the \"point of referral,\" which would identify a population more likely to have \"normal\" MPI and would potentially be candidates for stress-first protocols. METHODS Consecutive patients between December 1, 2010 and June 30, 2017 referred to SPECT and PET at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute were prospectively included in the MPI clinical databases. Patients with a history of cardiac transplant or congenital heart disease were excluded from the analysis. After exclusion criteria, 18,389 consecutive patients who underwent SPECT (2009 to 2015) were used as the derivation cohort and 5,819 consecutive patients who underwent SPECT (2015 to 2017) were used for validation. that was used as an external validation cohort. Ethics approval was obtained for each center, and all centers similarly collected standardized demographic data, medical history, and PET results. As per clinical routine, patient demographic data, medical history, and cardiac risk factors were recorded for all patients at the time of MPI. Chest pain symptoms were recorded, and typical angina was defined as a composite of substernal location, exertional or emotional stress, and relieved by rest or with administration of nitroglycerin (7). Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure >140 mm Hg or current treatment with antihypertensive medications. Diabetes was defined as a previous clinical diagnosis or current treatment with hypoglycemic medications. Hyperlipidemia was defined as known personal history of hyperlipidemia or current treatment with lipid-lowering agents. STRESS PROTOCOL.

Technetium-99m tetrofosmin radiotracer was used with standard rest-stress SPECT protocols as per ASNC guidelines (9). Images were acquired using either dual-headed Na-I gamma cameras (Infinia with Hawkeye [GE Healthcare, Waukesha, Wisconsin] and e-CAM [Siemens Medical Systems, Siemens Healthineers AG, Erlangen, Germany]), or cadmium-zinctelluride (CZT) cameras (Discovery NM, 530c, GE Healthcare) (Supplemental",

            "text": "). The derivation cohort consisted of a mixture of full-dose studies until February 2012 and primarily half-dose studies after that date. For full-dose studies, the injected radiotracer activity was 300 MBq (8.1 mCi) at rest and 1,000 MBq (27 mCi) at stress for body mass index (BMI) <30 (male patients) or <25 (female patients) and increased to 350 MBq (9.5 mCi) at rest and 1,100 MBq (29.7 mCi) at stress for larger BMI patients. For BMI >30 (female patients) or >35 (male patients), a 2day protocol was used with 1,100 MBq (29.7 mCi) injected at both rest and stress. The half-dose protocol used exactly one-half of the full-dose activity amounts. Dual-headed gamma cameras used parallel-hole low-energy high-resolution collimators and acquired images at 25 s per projection for 60 (Infinia) or 64 (e-CAM) projections over 180 for both rest and stress images (full-dose protocol). For the half-dose protocol, acquisition times were changed to 30 s per projection (rest) and 20 s per projection (stress). Studies performed at full-dose tracer with the Infinia camera were reconstructed using an ordered-subset expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm (2 iterations and 10 subsets for stress, 3 iterations and 4 subsets for rest), whereas half-dose Infinia images were reconstructed with a maximum a posteriori OSEM algorithm performed with Evolution for Cardiac software (GE Healthcare) using 8 iterations and 15 subsets (rest and stress). Post-reconstruction filtering was achieved with 3-dimensional (3D) Butterworth filtering (order 10, 0.3 cycles/cm cutoff) for both half-dose and full-dose Infinia studies. The e-CAM images were reconstructed using an OSEM algorithm (6 iterations, 16 subsets, Butterworth 3D filter with order 5, 0.43 cycles/cm) with Hermes software (Hermes Medical Solutions, Stockholm, Sweden) until July 2015 after which OSEM with resolution recovery (HRecon; Hermes Medical Solutions) was used with 5 iterations and 16 subsets and 3D Butterworth filtering (order 5, 0.32 cycles/cm cutoff). The CZT camera used 19 pinhole collimators and acquired stress and rest images for 3 and 5 min, respectively, for full-dose studies, or 6 and 10 min, respectively, when half-dose protocols were employed. Maximum a posteriori EM software (40 iterations for rest or 50 iterations for stress) and 3D Butterworth filtering (order 7, 0.37 cycles/cm) were used for image reconstruction. PET IMAGE ACQUISITION PROTOCOL. PET MPI images were acquired using a Discovery 690 or 600 PET-CT scanner (GE Healthcare) with low-dose CT attenuation correction scans acquired at rest. Weight-based dosing of 8 to 10 MBq/kg rubidium-82 was used at rest and stress per ASNC guidelines. Dynamic PET imaging was started with the initial arrival of activity in the scanner field of view. Static (ungated) images were reconstructed from 2 to 8 min using the vendor iterative program (VuePoint HD) with 12-mm 3D Hann post-filter. Electrocardiogram-gated images (8 bins) were reconstructed from 1.5 to 8 min with 16-mm 3D Hann post-filter.",

Therefore, a stress-first protocol would most greatly benefit those who will most likely have a normal MPI. Our model can select patients using easily obtainable clinical information and could be calculated at the time of scheduling or even at the point of care. Another group has examined a model to identify eligible patients for stress-first studies(22). Their study reported a sensitivity and specificity of 57% and 88% in identifying unsuccessful stress-first protocols, with the investigators commenting on its cumbersome nature and demonstrating that it is only marginally more accurate than triaging patients based on CAD status alone(23).Another shortcoming of this prediction score was the assignment of 5 points to male sex, which placed all men in an intermediate risk group. The investigators circumvented this limitation by assigning 4 points to men. Our study separated analyses according to sex, in light of growing awareness on differences in presentation, management, and prognosis between sexes (24). Furthermore, previous studies incorporated variables that may not be immediately available, such as an abnormal electrocardiography and congestive heart failure status, and included 1,996 patients in their derivation cohorts. The model present here was developed to be easily applied at point of care (e.g., by booking staff or implemented into an electronic ordering system) using readily available clinical variables at time of booking and was derived with a very large cohort of 18,389 patients, which is much more robust in terms of sample size. As well, it was validated in 3 large cohorts across both sexes, demonstrating that it is robust across a diverse patient population. Performing stress-first studies does not detract from the prognostic value of MPI. It has been previously demonstrated that normal stress-first studies carry similar prognostic value in patients with normal stress-rest studies (16,17,25). Selective omission of rest imaging in these patients would be beneficial in reducing image acquisition, processing time, and interpretation time, and it requires lower radiation dosing to the patient. STUDY LIMITATIONS. This model was derived in a single-center SPECT cohort, and thus the population and prevalence of CAD may differ from the population at other centers. Although this model can be used to predict those more likely to have normal MPI, it does not identify those who may be subject to artifact or incomplete attenuation compensation whereby rest images are still required. CONCLUSIONS A novel model, based on easily obtained clinical variables, is proposed to identify patients with low probability of having abnormal MPI results. This point-of-care tool may be used to identify a population that might qualify for stress-first MPI protocols.

            "text": "Robert C. Hendel, MD, Michael J. Crawford, MD M yocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is widely used to detect coronary artery disease and assess cardiovascular risk for subsequent cardiac events. Traditionally, MPI is composed of 2 images, 1 at rest and 1 under stress conditions, with the entire process requiring approximately 3 to 4 h and 2 doses of radiotracer. In circumstances when stress MPI is normal, the rest images are unnecessary. Efforts have been made to circumvent this issue by performing stress-first MPI and forgoing rest imaging if the initial images areinterpreted as normal. This strategy has proven to decrease the study length and radiation exposure while maintaining diagnostic and prognostic integrity(1,2). In a prior American Society of Nuclear Cardiology information statement, stress-only imaging is recommended when applied to appropriately selected patients(3). However, little guidance is offered in the selection of these patients leading to attempts to create a model or scoring system that would do so.Rouhani et al. (4)  propose a new risk stratification tool to identify patients that are candidates for stressfirst (stress-only) MPI. Prior studies have created prediction scores or models but are relatively complex and difficult to apply quickly(5,6). The objective of this study was to produce an easily applied modelthat would identify patients most likely to have a normal MPI. This study evaluated 18,389 patients who underwent SPECT between 2009 and 2017 in the derivation cohort and another 5,819 patients who underwent SPECT between 2015 and 2017 for validation. An additional 4,631 patients who underwent positron emission tomography were used for secondary validation as well as another 7,028 patients from a multicenter positron emission tomography registry for external validation. Rouhani et al. (4) are to be congratulated on the methodologic rigor and the use of validation cohorts. Patient demographic data, medical history, and cardiac risk factors were assessed at the time of MPI. Normal studies contained no perfusion abnormalities or other evidence of ischemia (transient ischemic dilatation, right ventricular uptake, and so on) and had normal left ventricular wall motion and ejection fraction. Patients with \"abnormal\" SPECT were analyzed based on de-mographic data and clinical variables. Variables that were associated with abnormal MPI included age, sex, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, prior coronary artery bypass graft, prior percutaneous coronary intervention, prior myocardial infarction, and typical angina. A final predictive model for each sex was developed based on these variables. The scoring system assigned weighted points for each variable and a total score was calculated for each patient. The area under the curve of the receiveroperating characteristic of the derived model was 0.684 (95% confidence interval: 0.674 to 0.694) for men and 0.681 (95% confidence interval: 0.666 to 0.696) for women. A threshold of #1 identified those with an abnormal study with a sensitivity of 89.6% in men and 82.2% in women. A score of #1 applied to approximately 16.6% of men and 30.5% of women in the derivation cohort and was associated with a 70.6% probability of having a normal study in men and 87.1% in women, therefore, 29.4% of men and 12.9% of women still required rest imaging. The model performed similarly, if not better, in the validation cohorts.The scoring model developed by Rouhani et al. (4) is simple to use and, in line with prior studies, it does not affect the diagnostic integrity of MPI as long as rest imaging was performed as needed. Still, perhaps, the model could be even further simplified by initially excluding any patient with a history of myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass graft, or other risk factor that exceeds a score of 1. The scoring model could then be composed only of risk factors with a score of 1, and those with more than 1 of those risk factors would not be candidates for stress-only imaging. Patients may be screened at the time the study is ordered or immediately prior to the test without causing significant delay. Whereas the area under the curve values from the derived model were acceptable (0.684 and 0.681), they are not great and raise the question of the overall accuracy of the model. Rouhani et al. (4) point out that the model was derived in a single-center cohort, which may limit its application to areas with differing populations and cardiovascular disease prevalence. Another limitation is the model's inability to account for additional factors that could possibly cause stress-perfusion defects, such as incomplete attenuation correction or other artifacts. The use of attenuation correction has been proven to significantly increase the diagnostic accuracy of MPI studies and is particularly vital to the success of a stress-first imaging protocol as there are no rest images for comparison(7). Heller et al.(8)    found that when applying attenuation correction to studies with stress-only SPECT images, they were able to significantly increase the number of studies characterized as definitely normal or abnormal (84% vs. 37%; p < 0.005). Furthermore, Mathur et al.(9)    were able to reclassify 83% of nonattenuated abnormal studies as normal after use of attenuation correction. Based on these prior studies, attenuation correction should be considered a prerequisite for stress-first imaging protocols(6).Subanalysis of the data that proved that their model performed equally well in patients with low to intermediate-low pretest probability of coronary artery disease, which was defined as #33.3%. It is unclear what this study considers as low pretest probability and how many patients fell into this category, posing the question of whether those that qualify for stress-first imaging protocol should even have the study performed at all. If appropriate use criteria guidelines were implemented, many of these studies may not have truly been \"appropriate\" (10). A more judicious selection of patients may have decreased the number of candidates for any MPI, along with the number of normal studies. Of note, this report already identifies only on a small cohort of patients that qualify for the stress-first imaging protocol (16.6% of men and 30.5% of women), and of those, a substantial proportion (29.4% of men and 12.9% of women) still required rest imaging. Based on these numbers, stress-only imaging was clinically valuable in only 11.7% of men and 26.6% of women referred for MPI. Therefore, this raises the question the overall impact of this model. Does its proposed benefits (reduction of radiation exposure, decreased costs, improved throughput) truly outweigh the additional stress and work of implementing this model? Barriers to stress-first imaging protocols have been highlighted in other studies. Physicians must be present on demand to interpret the stress images and decide whether rest imaging is needed, otherwise it can mitigate the benefit of improving patient throughput (3,7). Also, the importance of obtaining high-quality images and having an experienced reader is even greater with stress-only imaging given the lack of rest images for comparison. As mentioned, the use of attenuation correction is essential to this strategy, which further increases the complexity and cost of the study. In conclusion, Rouhani et al. (4) have provided a simple scoring model to identify patients that are candidates for stress-first imaging. There are many advantages with stress-first imaging protocols, including reduced radiation exposure, patient convenience and satisfaction, lab efficiency, conservation of radiopharmaceuticals, and overall reduced costs (3). Whereas there are no significant disadvantages to the use of the proposed scoring method for determining candidacy for stress-only MPI, there are still questions with regard to its accuracy and as to whether it would have a substantial impact on its proposed benefits. However, the current report provides additional evidence to move forward with a more widespread use of stress-first imaging, provided appropriate equipment and personnel are available and patients are carefully selected for this abbreviated protocol. ADDRESS FOR CORRESPONDENCE: Dr. Robert C. Hendel, Tulane University School of Medicine, Sec-P rospective invasive imaging studies of coronary atherosclerosis have provided robust evidence that intravascular imaging can identify, but only with modest accuracy, vulnerable plaques that are likely to progress and cause cardiovascular events (1,2). Computational fluid dynamic analysis of models reconstructed by intravascular imaging data and estimation of the local hemodynamic forces appear to provide additional prognostic information. Recent reports have shown that when they are combined with plaque characteristics, they enable accurate detection of lesions that can and blood flow simulation processing is a tedious and time-consuming process that requires dedicated software and expertise, thus limiting its use in everyday clinical practice. Conversely, 3-dimensional quantitative coronary angiography (3D-QCA) can be performed in real-time while the patient is in the catheterization laboratory. This technique appears to accurately assess lumen dimensions, as well as the extent and the severity of coronary artery disease. Recently, we processed 3D-QCA models with computational fluid dynamic techniques and demonstrated that the estimated endothelial shear stress (ESS) was a predictor of atherosclerotic disease progression at 1-year follow-up (5). In addition, a post hoc analysis of the FAME (Fractional Flow Reserve versus Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation) II study showed that the 3D-QCA-derived ESS estimated in hemodynamically severe stenoses predicted stenoses that caused myocardial infarction at 3-year follow-up (6). However, the combined value of plaque characteristics and of ESS estimated by 3D-QCA in nonflow limiting plaques in predicting stenoses that are likely to progress and cause events is yet unclear. vessel VH-IVUS imaging of the proximal 60-to 80-mm segment. The IBIS 4 study was a multicenter multimodality imaging study that aimed to examine the effect of aggressive statin therapy (rosuvastatin 40 mg once daily) on plaque burden (PB) and composition in patients admitted with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. All the recruited patients (n \u00bc 103) had successful revascularization and underwent 3-vessel VH-IVUS and optical coherence tomography imaging of the proximal 50-mm segment at baseline and at 13-month follow-up. The patients recruited in the PROSPECT study were followed for a median of 3.4 years, whereas those recruited in the IBIS-4 study were followed for 5 years.

CLINICAL ENDPOINTS. The primary endpoint of the PROSPECT study was the composite endpoint of cardiac death or arrest, myocardial infarction, or rehospitalization for unstable or progressive angina. The IBIS-4 study had an imaging-based endpoint (i.e., the change in the percent atheroma volume at 13-month follow-up). However, in the IBIS 4 study, which was a sub-study of the COMFORTable-AMI (Comparison of Biolimus Eluted from an Erodible Stent Coating with Bare Metal Stents in Acute ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction) study, clinical endpoints were also recorded, including cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and target and nontarget lesion revascularization. In the IBIS 4 study, revascularization was deemed clinically indicated at follow-up angiography when there was a percent diameter stenosis (%DS) of $70% on QCA or 70% $ %DS $50% and recurrent angina or evidence of ischemia at rest or during an exercise test. The clinical, angiographic, and intravascular imaging data in both studies enabled identification of untreated lesions that were assessed by VH-IVUS at baseline and caused events. The present analysis focused on these lesions; the primary endpoint of this study was the combined endpoint of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or revascularization because of progressive or unstable angina, because of evidence of ischemia and 70% $ %DS $ 50% on follow-up coronary angiography, or because of significant disease progression (%DS $70%) at follow-up angiography (MACE-R). The secondary endpoint of the present analysis was the combined endpoint of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or revascularization because of progressive or unstable angina (MACE). STUDIED LESIONS AND VH-IVUS ANALYSIS. In the PROSPECT study, 25 of the untreated lesions at baseline that were studied by VH-IVUS and caused events had a thin cap fibroatheroma (TCFA) phenotype, 18 untreated lesions had a thick cap fibroatheroma (ThCFA) phenotype, 7 had a non-fibroatheroma phenotype, and 4 were unclassified lesions. In the IBIS 4 study, all the lesions associated with MACE-R had either a TCFA (n \u00bc 13) or a ThCFA (n \u00bc 2) phenotype (2,4). The present analysis included only untreated lesions with a lipid-rich phenotype (TCFA or ThCFA) that caused MACE-R during follow-up and a 4fold sample of lesions with a lipid-rich phenotype that remained quiescent. Lesions that were short (<9 mm), those with suboptimal angiographic images (i.e., poor opacification of lumen silhouette, excessive foreshortening, or overlapping), and cases in which the DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) file did not include all the necessary information for 3D-QCA reconstruction were excluded from the analysis. VH-IVUS data analysis was performed by independent core laboratories (Cardiovascular Research Foundation, New York, New York in PROSPECT and Cardialysis B.V., Rotterdam, the Netherlands in IBIS-4). Classification of remodeling pattern and lesion phenotype was performed in both core laboratories using the same protocol (Supplemental Appendix). For each lesion with a TCFA or ThCFA phenotype its remodeling pattern, its length, the length of the proximal shoulder of the lesion, the distance ostium of the studied vessel to minimum lumen area (MLA) of the lesion, its MLA, external elastic membrane, plaque area, and PB at the MLA were estimated and recorded. 3D-QCA RECONSTRUCTION, BLOOD FLOW SIMULATION, AND DATA PROCESSING. Anatomical landmarks (i.e., side branches) seen in both IVUS and x-ray angiography were used to identify the proximal and distal end of the \"segment of interest\" (i.e., the segment that was assessed by VH-IVUS) on coronary angiography. Two end-diastolic angiographic projections (>25 apart) where there was no overlapping or foreshortening of the segment of interest and that allowed accurate delineation of the lumen silhouette were selected and used to reconstruct its anatomy using well-validated software (QAngio XA 3D RE, Medis, Leiden, the Netherlands) (8). The distances proximal end of the segment of interest to the proximal end of each TCFA/ThCFA and distal end of the segment of interest to the distal end of each TCFA/ ThCFA were used to identify lesion location in 3D-QCA models. Then, 3D-QCA analysis was performed for each lesion, and the lesion length, minimum lumen diameter (MLD), and %DS were estimated. The 3D-QCA models were processed with computational fluid dynamic techniques, and the ESS distribution was estimated (Supplemental Appendix). The location of each TCFA/ThCFA lesion was identified in the 3D-QCA models and the lesion was then divided into consecutive 3-mm segments. The ESS values were extracted across the circumference and length of the segment for each of these segments, and the mean value was calculated (3,4). For each lesion, the highest and lowest mean ESS values, estimated in the 3-mm segments of the lesion, were recorded and defined the maximum and minimum lesion ESS, respectively. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. Numerical variables are presented as median (interquartile range [IQR]), whereas categorical variables are presented as absolute values and percentages. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare numerical variables between lesions associated with MACE-R or MACE and those that remained quiescent, whereas categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test. Cox regression analysis was used to identify VH-IVUS, 3D-QCA, and 3D-QCA-derived hemodynamic predictors associated with MACE-R or MACE. Receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis was performed for each variable associated with MACE-R (p < 0.05); those with the highest area under the curve that were not collinear (r < 0.50) were entered into a multivariate model. Receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis was also used for the computational fluid dynamicderived variables to identify the best cutoff that predicted MACE-R; this was used to classify lesions in groups. Kaplan-Meier plots were used to display time to event at lesion and patient levels; comparison of the MACE-R rate between groups with different plaque characteristics and hemodynamic profiles was performed using the log-rank test. Lesions or patients with no events were censored at the latest contact date. In case of multiple lesions in the same patient, the lesion with the highest maximum ESS value or the lesion that exhibited the highest pressure gradient was used in the patient-level analysis. Analyses were performed in Stata version 15.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas) and R version 3.4.2 (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria). A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS. In the PROSPECT study, 54 MACE occurred during a median of 3.4 years of follow-up. In the IBIS 4 study, 15 MACE-R events occurred (9 cardiac events and 6 revascularizations) within 5 years of follow-up. After excluding cases who had IVUS analysis or co-registration with coronary angiography was not possible, cases in whom there was insufficient information for 3D-QCA reconstruction in the DICOM files, lesions with short length, and those with a nonlipid-rich phenotype, 28 MACE-R lesions (n \u00bc 26) were included in the present analysis (16 from the PROSPECT study and 12 from the IBIS-4 study). Revascularization was performed in 6 lesions during invasive assessment at 13-month follow-up either because of new-onset angina and a 70% $ %DS $ 50% (n \u00bc 1) or significant disease",

From these lesions, 16 cases were excluded because of suboptimal angiographic image quality, and 61 were excluded because of lack of sufficient information in the DICOM file for 3D-QCA analysis. Therefore, the final control group consisted of 119 non-MACE-R lipid-rich lesions (53 from the PROS-PECT and 66 from the IBIS-4 study) (Figure 1). A total of 92 patients (45 recruited from PROS-PECT and 47 from the IBIS 4 study; 119 vessels) were included in the present analysis. As shown in Table 1, there were no significant differences in the baseline demographics between the patients who experienced MACE-R and the control group. Coronary reconstruction and blood flow simulation was successfully performed in all the studied vessels (n \u00bc 147). The median length of reconstructed segments was 44.1 mm (IQR: 34.3 to 56.2 mm), which yielded 1,882 3-mm segments; the median mean ESS was 2.19 Pa (IQR: 1.46 to 3.39 Pa). The IVUS MLA coincided with the 3D-QCA MLA in 40% of studied lesions; in the remaining lesions, IVUS MLA was located in a different 3-mm segment than the 3D-QCA MLA. The distribution of the ESS across the studied lesions is shown in the Supplemental Table 2 shows the morphological, angiographic, and hemodynamic characteristics of the studied lesions. MACE-R lesions were longer on VH-IVUS, had a smaller MLA, and increased PB compared with non-MACE-R lesions. Conversely, the 3D-QCA lesion length was not different between groups; however, the lesions associated with MACE-R had a higher %DS and a smaller MLD. The maximum ESS values and the pressure drop across the MACE-R lesions were higher compared with non-MACE-R lesions. There were no differences between groups in the incidence of TCFA, minimum ESS values, and location of MACE-R and non-MACE-R lesions in the coronary tree. Similar findings were noted for the morphological, angiographic, and hemodynamic characteristics of the lesions that caused MACE (n \u00bc 22) (Supplemental",

We found that:1) ESS distribution estimated in 3D-QCA models provided additional prognostic information and was an independent predictor of MACE-R or MACE; 2) the pressure gradient across nonflow limiting lipid-rich lesions was a predictor of MACE-R and/or MACE; 3) the combination of plaque characteristics and 3D-QCA-derived hemodynamic indexes (i.e., ESS or the pressure gradient across the lesion) enabled more accurate detection of MACE-R and MACE lesions than VH-IVUS-derived variables; and 4) plaque morphology and the hemodynamic variables estimated in 3D-QCA models allowed more accurate identification of the patients who were at risk to experiencing cardiovascular event than standalone VH-IVUS imaging. Computational fluid dynamic-based animal and human studies have provided robust evidence about the role of the local hemodynamic forces on atherosclerotic disease progression and have highlighted their prognostic implications (9). Low ESS appears to promote, through mechano-transduction pathways, plaque evolution and the development of high-risk plaques and in clinical studies, low ESS was reported to be a predictor of lesions that progressed and caused events (3,10). Conversely, the role of high ESS on the formation of high-risk plaques is less well established; however, there is considerable evidence to suggest that high ESS contributes to the destabilization of vulnerable lesions (11,12). Despite the undoubted prognostic implications of ESS, blood flow simulation analyses have limited applications in the clinical arena. This should be at least partially attributed to the increased time required for coronary reconstruction and blood flow modeling.In the present study we examined the prognostic value of 3D-QCA-derived hemodynamic variables in detecting nonflow-limiting lipid-rich plaques that are likely to progress and cause MACE-R. In contrast to findings reported in previous studies, we found that the maximum and not the minimum ESS predicted MACE-R and MACE(3,4).

Taking into account the limitations of 3D-QCA and the fact that it generates smooth luminal surfaces, we used the mean rather the more commonly used minimum predominant ESS value to define the physiological profile of 3-mm segments(3,4).Despite the limitations of 3D-QCA-modeling, the estimated hemodynamic indexes, and in particular, the ESS distribution provided useful prognostic information and improved the efficacy of established VH-IVUS-derived plaque characteristics in predicting events (Figure 3, Central Illustration). The maximum ESS was a predictor of lesion-related MACE-R/MACE in multivariable analysis, and the Kaplan-Meier plots demonstrated the synergetic effect of plaque morphology and ESS in predicting future MACE or angiographically indicated revascularizations. Two recent studies, the EMERALD (Exploring the Mechanism of Plaque Rupture in Acute Coronary Syndrome Using Coronary CT Angiography and Computational Fluid Dynamics) and a post hoc analysis from the FAME II reported similar findings to our analysis, demonstrating that the maximum ESS estimated in lesions reconstructed by computed tomography/coronary angiography or 3D-QCA were predictors of future myocardial infarctions (6,14).

In addition, the EMERALD study predominantly included patients without a history of coronary artery disease who were less likely to have complex lesions, whereas in the FAME II study there was no information about plaque composition. Therefore, this analysis was unable to examine the additive predictive value of hemodynamic indexes over anatomic and morphological plaque characteristics derived by intravascular imaging. Finally, coronary reconstruction and blood flow simulation in both studies was computationally demanding because the EMERALD used computed tomographic coronary angiography derived models, whereas the FAME II study incorporated the side branches in the 3D-QCA models, which considerably increased computation time. Conversely, our analysis included only the main branch and assumed steady coronary flow; this approach makes the real-time estimation of ESS feasible while the patient is in the catheterization laboratory.

The preceding processes eventually result in fibrous cap fragility and rupture that can cause vessel thrombosis or plaque healing with accelerated disease progression(15). These events can have clinical manifestations if they occur in segments with increased PB and small MLA because in this setting they are likely to cause flow obstruction and ischemia(16). In our study, apart from ESS, increased PB and small MLA were also predictors of MACE-R, whereas PB was also an independent predictor of MACE-R in the multivariate Cox regression analysis.Interestingly, apart from ESS, the pressure gradient across the lesion estimated in our 3D-QCA models also provided useful prognostic information and was a predictor of MACE-R and MACE. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that lesions with a high pressure gradient (and especially those with high-risk plaque characteristic) had a poor prognosis, with event rates as high as 51.8% at 5-year follow-up. Several studies demonstrated that a low fractional flow reserve was a predictor of worse outcomes even in angiographically nonflow limiting stenoses(17). In these studies, the prognostic value of fractional flow reserve was attributed to the fact that it reflected atherosclerotic burden. However, in our analysis and in the EMERALD study, the pressure gradient seemed to provide additional prognostic information beyond plaque characteristics. An increased pressure gradient across a lesion is associated with increased axial tensile stress, flow disturbances and ESS heterogeneity; this unfavorable hemodynamic environment can accelerate atherosclerotic evolution, leading to plaque destabilization and future events(18,19).The findings of the present analysis provide evidence of the value of 3D-QCA\u00c0derived hemodynamic indexes in identifying vulnerable plaques (Supplemental Figure 3). Software have been developed that enable real-time computation of the fractional flow reserve from 3D-QCA, which could be used in future studies to enhance the efficacy of intravascular imaging in detecting plaques prone to progress and cause events (20). Moreover, the present analysis also underscore the potential value of plaque morphology and physiology (i.e., ESS distribution or pressure drop across a lesion) in stratifying cardiovascular risk. The models that are currently available to identify high-risk patients rely either on patient demographics or on the combination of clinical and imaging biomarkers and they have modest predictive accuracy (21). The patient-level analysis of our study showed that the subjects with high-risk plaques and an unfavorable local hemodynamic environment had a high event rate during follow-up. Further research is needed to examine the potential value of noninvasive or invasive assessment of plaque pathology (i.e., plaque burden and composition) and physiology in identifying patients at risk who would benefit from emerging therapies that target atherosclerosis. STUDY LIMITATIONS. A significant limitation of the present analysis was that only 48% of the lipid-rich lesions that caused MACE-R were suitable for inclusion. This might have introduced selection bias and resulted in a small sample size and events that did not allow us to accurately quantify the additive value of hemodynamic variables over VH-IVUS\u00c0derived plaque characteristics in predicting MACE-R. Therefore, the reported results should be interpreted with caution and require further confirmation in future large-scale studies. In addition, in some of the angiograms from the PROSPECT study, the pixel size was not available; thus, vessel reconstruction relied on a manual calibration that could affect the accuracy of 3D-QCA modeling. Moreover, we performed steady flow simulation, which assumed that blood was a Newtonian fluid, and we did not include side branches in the 3D-QCA models. Steady flow simulation can accurately predict time-averaged ESS in pulsatile simulations (22). Conversely, a Newtonian assumption might not accurately approximate blood behavior, especially in diseased segments where more regions of slow flow are expected (23). In addition, the incorporation of the side branches in the 3D models was expected to enable more accurate assessment of the ESS distribution; however, a recent study showed that incorporation of the side branches into the 3D vessel geometry only marginally improved the accuracy of the ESS in predicting plaque evolution (24). Complex simulation, especially in complex geometries, is time consuming and cannot be performed in the catheterization laboratory. With the proposed approach, ESS, and especially, the pressure drop across a lesion, can be computed fast in single-vessel geometries. Currently, QCA reconstruction and blood flow simulation takes approximately 15 min; however, developments in software design and advances in computer technology are expected to s5 in IBIS 4 [Volcano Corp., Rancho Cordova, California]; VH analysis from these 2 systems might provide different estimations for plaque composition and phenotype. In addition, follow-up coronary angiography and revascularization because of disease progression on angiography was performed only in the IBIS 4 study, whereas the follow-up period (median 3.4 years in the PROSPECT and 5 years in the IBIS-4) was different in the 2 studies. However, it is reassuring that our findings were similar when analysis was restricted to MACE or to the first 3.4 years of follow-up (Supplemental Figure 4). Finally, the number of the events reported in this analysis was relatively small, and most of the events were unstable or progressive angina and not hard clinical endpoints (death, myocardial infarction). However, we must acknowledge that in all the prospective multivessel intravascular imaging studies of coronary atherosclerosis, the incidence of hard endpoints is low (1\u00c03). In addition, the clinical endpoints of this study were similar to the endpoints of the recently completed Lipid Rich Plaque study and of ongoing studies of coronary atherosclerosis (PROS-PECT II [PROSPECT II & PROSPECT ABSORB-An Integrated Natural History Study and Randomized Trial. (P2)]; NCT02171065; PREVENT [The Preventive Coronary Intervention on Stenosis With Functionally Insignificant Vulnerable Plaque]; NCT02316886; COMBINE [Optical Coherence Tomography Morphologic and Fractional Flow Reserve Assessment in Diabetes Mellitus Patients]; NCT02989740) that are expected to provide additional data and the substrate to prove the concept introduced in this study.CONCLUSIONS In the present analysis of the PROSPECT and IBIS 4 studies, hemodynamic indexes estimated from 3D-QCA models provided additional prognostic information to VH-IVUS\u00c0derived variables and enabled more accurate detection of nonflow limiting lesions that were likely to progress and cause events. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and examine the efficacy of intravascular imaging and 3D-QCA-derived variables in detecting high-risk lesions and patients who may benefit from preemptive focal or systemic treatment of atherosclerosis.",

KEY WORDS quantitative coronary angiography, shear stress, vulnerable plaque APPENDIX For an expanded Methods section and supplemental tables and figures, please see the online version of this paper. of Identifying Vulnerable Plaque Remains Alive* Habib Samady, MD, a Joo Myung Lee, MD, MPH, PHD a,b T he 2 major arguments against pursuing detection of vulnerable plaques are as follows: 1) it is the patient as a whole who is vulnerable to an acute coronary event and not the individual plaque; and 2) even if one could identify characteristics of plaques that are likely to be vulnerable to rapidly progress, rupture, or erode, the prevalence of such plaques is likely too low to have clinical value. For the proponents of vulnerable plaque detection, however, the rebuttal to the first argument is that the concept of the vulnerable plaque is not mutually exclusive with that of a vulnerable patient. It is clear that the most likely host of a vulnerable plaque is a vulnerable patient. Indeed, any ultimate clinical evaluation of a potential vulnerable plaque should be performed in a high-risk population further enriched by biomics, including genomics, transcriptionomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics, as well as inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers, among others. The second argument related to low prevalence of vulnerable plaque, even in enriched nonculprit vessels of patients with acute coronary syndrome(1-3), has been rebutted by the observation that vessel and plaque biomechanics play an important role in further enriching coronary plaque phenotyping (4-6). Building on extensive basic and translational underpinnings, initial clinical studies in patients with mild coronary atherosclerosis showed that coronary segments with low endothelial shear stress (ESS) or wall shear stress (WSS) are associated with plaque progression (7). Interestingly, there has been controversy over the prognostic value of segments with high WSS, with some observations showing transformation of high WSS segments into a vulnerable phenotype",

(17) report on their case-control study using the PROSPECT (Providing Regional Observations to Study Predictors of Events in the Coronary Tree) and IBIS-4 (Integrated Biomarker Imaging Study-4) datasets to investigate the prognostic value of anatomic and biomechanical coronary plaque features of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). They evaluated several anatomic plaque features, including minimal luminal area (MLA), plaque burden (PB), and the presence of thick cap fibroatheroma assessed by virtual histology intravascular ultrasound (VH-IVUS); they also evaluated 3D-QCA-derived minimal luminal diameter (MLD), percent diameter stenosis (%DS), and ESS (or WSS). The authors make several very interesting observations (17). The patient-level analysis showed that MLA, PB, MLD, %DS, and the maximum ESS were predictors of the primary endpoint, MACE plus revascularization (MACE-R). They further inform the controversy regarding the prognostic value of low versus high ESS by showing that patients who had lipid-rich plaques with $2 high-risk plaque characteristics who were exposed to high ESS (>4.95 Pa) had a worse prognosis than those with high-risk plaques exposed to low ESS. The results also showed that a resting pressure gradient >2.31 mm Hg across lesions provides additional prognostic information to plaque morphology in indicating that patients with lesions with $2 high-risk plaque characteristics or MLA #4 mm 2 and PB $70%. The lesion-level findings of Bourantas et al. (17) are largely consistent with their patient-level analysis. The univariable predictors of MACE-R included VH-IVUS-derived variable lesion length, MLA and PB, 3D-QCA-derived MLD and %DS, and the hemodynamic variables of maximum ESS value and pressure drop across the lesion. Multivariable analysis revealed that PB and maximum ESS were independent predictors of MACE-R lesions, and maximum ESS was the only independent predictor of MACE-R when the MLA was entered in the multivariate model. In addition, the best ESS cutoff for predicting MACE-R lesions was 4.95 Pa.",

First, the nonculprit target lesions of patients with ACS were very mild, non-flow-limiting with a median DS of 26% and a modest pressure gradient of 1.95 mm Hg. Second, the simplified 3D-QCA computational fluid dynamic (CFD) methodology, using steady flow boundary conditions and not accounting for side branches, enables faster CFD simulation. Third, the resting pressure gradient has incremental prognostic value over anatomic plaque severity and plaque characteristic features. Fourth, and importantly, unlike the authors' previous findings (5), they found in the current study that maximum WSS (>4.95 Pa), and not the minimum ESS, was an independent predictor of MACE (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or revascularization due to unstable angina) or MACE-R (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or revascularization due to unstable angina or evidence of angiographic progression base on diameter stenosis) at 5 years.",

To initiate the re-entrant circuit, unidirectional conduction block in some part of the circuit is a pre-requisite. Furthermore, to sustain the re-entrant circuit, the length of this circuit needs to be long enough to enable tissue in each part of the circuit to restore its excitability in order to conduct the next impulse. Unexcitable regions caused by infarction in the human heart may have a circumference of that length. Furthermore, activation delay has also been observed in normal myocardium at sites where an activation front proceeds from a small strand into a larger structure. In these cases, the activation delay was based on the so-called source-sink mismatch,i.e., a delay caused by the difference between the current supply of the small source and the current requirement of the large sink, thus providing an alternative explanation of slow conduction in infarcted areas where encapsulated myocyte bundles interconnect. De Bakker et al. (8) elegantly demonstrated that surviving myocardial fibers in the chronic healed phase of myocardial infarction are encapsulated by fibrous tissue. In these interconnected bundles of myocardial fibers, slow conduction perpendicular to the fiber direction proceeds along complex pathways with a \"zigzag\" pattern characterized by branching and merging of surviving myocardial fibers that are encapsulated by collagenous strands of the infarct scar. Diffuse fibrosis means that collagen is interspersed among myocardial fibers. This reduces gap junction connections between myocytes, isolates myocytes from each other, and thereby , C. et al.

Patchy and severe interstitial fibrosis creates strands of myocytes that increase the possibility that a premature ventricular complex is generated and propagates into the surrounding tissue(10). Third, myofibroblasts have a direct pro-arrhythmic effect on myocyte electrophysiological properties(11). By expressing connexins and gap junctions between myofibroblasts and myocytes, the cells are coupled electrically, and resting potential is slightly depolarized. Hence, the threshold for spontaneous afterdepolarization is reduced and triggers emerge. Lastly, paracrine factors secreted by myofibroblasts further promote a pro-arrhythmic effect on myocytes(12).The different patterns of myocardial fibrosis (i.e. compact, patchy, interstitial, and diffuse) are involved in various electrophysiological mechanisms to generate ventricular arrhythmia under different predisposing conditions. Different types of tissue remodeling (i.e., replacement fibrosis or reactive interstitial fibrosis) have implications in both therapies and imaging visualization of fibrosis.

Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) cardiomyopathy is characterized by glycosphingolipid (Gb3) storage in all cellular components, with consequent left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Gb3 accumulation also involves atrial myocytes (1), ultimately leading to left atrial (LA) enlargement and reduced atrial compliance. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) plays an important role in the assessment of the severity of Fabry cardiomyopathy.

A similar incremental benefit was observed on a per-patient analysis (data not shown). In vessels with FFR CT #0.80, the use of the FFR CT model to estimate the ischemic myocardial burden is a simple, rapid, and reproducible technique, which provides improved diagnostic discrimination of vessel-specific ischemia over FFR CT alone, particularly at FFR CT values in the gray zone between 0.7 and 0.8. As a stand-alone clinical tool, the location at which FFR CT values should be read is unclear, especially because there is typically a gradual decline of FFR CT values along the course of even normal coronary arteries (3). The majority of clinical studies have thus far applied the most distal FFR CT value in guiding clinical decisions (3). This potentially overestimates the hemodynamic significance of coronary artery lesions . Our results suggest that with gray-zone FFR CT values or FFR CT values that only decrease below the ischemic threshold in the distal vessel, the integration of CT-derived ischemic myocardial burden using the APPROACH FFRCT score may assist in the interpretation of FFR CT in real-world practice. Myocardial mass is a key determinant for modeling FFR CT ; however, it is only used to derive total coronary flow and global baseline resistance (4). These global measures of coronary flow and resistance are then distributed along the coronary tree in relation to vessel size (4). Therefore, although myocardial mass is an input in the modeling of FFR CT , the FFR CT value on the coronary geometry is not influenced by the degree of fractional myocardial mass subtended.",

Our group previously published data providing prognostic and hemodynamic validation for the ASE/ EACVI algorithms and the E/\u00e9 ratio following a first myocardial infarction (MI)(3,4). We re-analyzed our data to determine if significant DD (grade 2/3) assessed using the combined algorithm had a robust correlation with clinical outcomes and invasively measured LVFP.The study cohort for the prognostic study con-sisted of 419 patients with MI who underwent echocardiography the day after admission and were followed up for a median of 24 months. The primary endpoint was a composite of recurrent MI, heart failure, and death (major adverse cardiovascular event(s) [MACE]). The study cohort for the hemodynamic study consisted of 120 patients with non\u00c0STsegment elevation MI who underwent either simultaneous (n \u00bc 30) or same day (n \u00bc 90) cardiac catheterization and echocardiography. The correlation between significant DD assessed with the combined algorithm and invasively measured left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was analyzed (LVEDP $15 mm Hg was considered elevated). For the current re-analysis, all patients were re-graded for DD based on the combined algorithm, with patients with $3 criteria of septal \u00e9 <7 cm/s, septal E/\u00e9 >15, tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV) >2.8 m/s, and left atrial volume index >34 ml/m 2 categorized as having significant DD. Patients with 2 and 2 of both criteria were further classified with pulmonary venous inflow data (systolic (S) to diastolic (D) ratio ratio <1.0 regarded as evidence of significant DD).

These results were consistent with the results of previously published studies and were not unexpected because the novel com-bined algorithm was derived by combining the 2 ASE/ EACVI algorithms. The limitation of the combined algorithm was that the frequent unavailability of TRV limited the application of the algorithm. We did not perform a direct comparison of the combined algorithm with the ASE/EACVI algorithms primarily because the ASE/EACVI algorithms remain the preferred approach in our laboratories based on evidence from a large body of hemodynamic and prognostic validations in a variety of clinical settings. The data presented here had some limitations. Preexisting data were re-analyzed for this research. Only subjects with MI were included, and further validation in other patient subsets is needed. For patients with indeterminate diastolic function using the combined algorithm, other data that could have refined the assessment of DD (including left atrial strain or global longitudinal strain) were not routinely available. Measurements of mean left atrial pressure, the ideal measure of left atrial pressure, were not available. Finally, longer term follow-up in larger cohorts would be desirable. THE AUTHORS REPLY: I read with interest the letter by Dr. Prasad and colleagues. The investigators draw reasonable conclusions from the post hoc analysis of previously acquired data. Because of the inclusion of similar echo-Doppler parameters, the performance of the combined algorithm was similar to the main guidelines, with only a 5% difference in significant diastolic dysfunction (DD) grading (1). Although limitations were acknowledged, a few points are worth emphasis. The overall attempt in looking at the accuracy of DD algorithms was hampered by the low feasibility of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) jet acquisition, at only 55% in the hemodynamic study and 66% in the prognostic study. This limitation was not unique to the work by Dr. Prasad andcolleagues, and stemmed from the attempt to apply the guidelines to retrospectively acquired data. The guidelines were also applied to several prospective studies that did not use saline or contrast agents to enhance the TR jet when the objective was to study diastolic function.The investigators presented the results in all patients, but it is important to assess accuracy based on left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) and the presence or absence of LV segmental abnormalities.",

LARS was significantly impaired even in patients with mild dysfunction, regardless of whether echocardiographic or CMR methods were used. Importantly, impaired LARS was associated with AF in follow-up. As pointed out by the accompanying editorial, the work by Kim et al. (6) advances the field by independent validation of echocardiographic methods by CMR, the use of vendor-agnostic software, and the link between diastolic dysfunction, AF, and heart failure.These findings were complemented by Park et al. (12), whose study of 4,312 consecutive patients with acute HF, 16% of whom developed new onset AF over follow-up. Patients with reduced LARS (#18%) had a 60% increment of hazard of new-onset AF, independent of age, hypertension, LA size, HFpEF, and the absence of beta blockade. Although the accompanying editorial expressed reservations about the uptake of the resulting HAS-BAP (hypertension, age, PALS, no Beta-blocker prescription at discharge, atrial volume index, HFpEF (range, 0-6)) score, the ability to identify a high-risk group opens intriguing possibilities. Strain measurements open another interesting avenues of research in the AF-embolic events linkage: could they denote an \"atrial myopathy\" that could mediate blood stasis and risk thromboembolism events independent of AF (13,14)? LA strain abnormalities are early signs of chamber dysfunction and remodeling and correlate with local structural changes like regional fibrosis (15). Whether through AF or without it, LA strain seems to predict adverse events robustly and becomes a useable marker in clinical practice. The pathophysiology of cardiac aging underlies the most common and increasing cardiac diseases, AF and HFpEF. Measurement of LV global longitudinal strain, already a sensitive marker of subclinical LV dysfunction (16), is now being strengthened by a strain measurement for atrial dysfunction.

            "text": "Making a Splash Stress Lung Ultrasound and the Rising Tide of Lung Water* Sharon L. Mulvagh, MD, a Omid Kiamanesh, MD b L ung ultrasound (LUS) is making a splash, and it is time for cardiologists to dive in. Congestion is a common, yet often challenging-to-diagnose finding in heart failure. It is a strong predictor of poor cardiovascular outcomes, including hospitalization and death. Our current approach to diagnosing congestion by using symptoms and late signs is insensitive and delayed. We know that earlier in the course of clinical congestion, a cascade of events initiates with a rise in left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure and results in pulmonary congestion. However, until very recently, we have lacked a practical, noninvasive, radiation-free tool to assess this early rise of lung water. Enter lung ultrasonography! LUS is more accurate than chest auscultation and radiographs to detect pulmonary edema (1) and can predict mortality after hospital discharge (2). LUS interpretation is based on artifacts produced by normal and abnormal lung. Fluid-filled lung interstitium produces vertical hyperechoic artifacts called B-lines that correlate with pulmonary congestion. B-lines may be quantified by count (sum of Blines) or score ($3 B-lines is \"positive\") per zone examined. Quantifying B-lines provides a graded estimate of pulmonary congestion; #2 may be normal, whereas >2 is abnormal, and coalescent B-lines are severely abnormal. A novel approach of combining LUS with stress echocardiography can detect an increase in pulmonary congestion in response to exercise (3). Indeed, stress LUS to detect pulmonary congestion is analogous to inducing regional wall motion abnormalities during stress echocardiography to detect ischemia. However, until now, stress LUS has shown no prognostic value and has been poorly used compared with stress echocardiography. In this issue of iJACC, Scali et al. (4) report on their experience using LUS to detect pulmonary congestion during stress echocardiography to predict death and nonfatal myocardial infarction. This prespecified interim analysis of The International Stress Echo Study in Ischemic and Non-ischemic Heart Disease (Stress Echo 2020) included 2,145 consecutive adult patients referred for stress echocardiography to evaluate coronary artery disease and heart failure. They excluded patients with noncardiac diseases that produce B-lines, such as interstitial lung disease and pneumonia. Although the population was representative, information regarding medication use, noncardiac comorbidities, and interventions was lacking. The patients underwent stress LUS combined with stress echocardiography. B-lines were counted at rest and after stress using a simplified 4-zone protocol (Figure 1). Patients were grouped according to the peak number of stress B-lines, scored from 0 to 40. Severe stress B-lines ($10) were observed in 119 patients and associated with increased age, comorbidities, and measures of poor cardiac function, including stress-induced regional wall motion abnormalities, exercise-induced B-lines, lower LV contractile reserve, lower coronary flow velocity reserve, and abnormal heart rate reserve. They were also associated with poorer anatomic indices, including moderate or greater mitral regurgitation, and multivessel coronary artery disease. Not surprisingly, severe stress B-lines were associated with a higher risk of death and nonfatal myocardial infarction by univariate (hazard ratio: 8.27; 95% confidence interval: 4.17 to 16.40; p < 0.01) and multivariate (hazard ratio: 3.54; 95% confidence interval: 1.47 to 8.69; p < 0.01) analyses at a median follow-up of 15 months. Importantly, severe stress B-lines improved risk reclassification and incrementally improved the prediction of death and nonfatal myocardial infarction. This study (4) adds to growing evidence for the detection of pulmonary congestion by LUS in patients with heart failure. Pulmonary congestion is quickly and reliably detected by LUS to predict poorer outcomes (5). LUS can also detect changes in pulmonary congestion in response to therapy, which is associated with improved outcomes. Importantly, LUS has incremental prognostic value beyond clinical examination to predict heart failure rehospitalization and death. Scali et al. (3) previously applied LUS to stress testing and correlated exercise-induced B-lines with a poorer B-type natriuretic peptide level, peak oxygen uptake, and clinical outcome in ambulatory patients with heart failure with decreased LV systolic function. The current study builds on their findings by using a large and representative international cohort of patients and a simplified 4-zone protocol to increase the power, generalizability, and feasibility of using stress LUS to predict outcomes. The study by Scali et al. (4) has several limitations. First, the method of stress was suboptimal and not uniform. Only one-half of the patients were exercised, which is the preferred method to assess a hemodynamic response. The other half received a vasodilator, which produces a different hemodynamic profile that is better suited to detect ischemia. Second, it is unsurprising that severe stress B-lines are associated with poorer outcomes. However, this definition is arbitrary and not standardized. The incremental value of severe stress Blines should be compared against a similar grade of functional indices, such as severe inducible wall motion abnormalities and severe decline in LV function. Third, the prognostic value of exerciseinduced B-lines should be normalized for the presence of rest B-lines to conclude that stress LUS provides an incremental benefit over rest LUS. Fourth, there is no comparison of stress B-lines with clinically useful indices of heart failure, such as the ratio between early mitral inflow velocity and mitral annular early diastolic velocity, B-type natriuretic peptide levels, and peak oxygen uptake. Fifth, treatment interventions are not reported and could have affected the primary outcome. We commend Scali et al. Their essential work helps LUS evolve from a point-of-care test into a diagnostic technique. In this study (4), they show that stress LUS can be standardized and operationalized across multinational centers with excellent interobserver reliability using a highly feasible (100%) and reproducible 4-zone protocol. Stress LUS can be performed with the same ultrasound probe as cardiac imaging, uses neighboring scanning zones, and is not affected by tachycardia or respiratory motion. Furthermore, stress LUS does not interfere with the performance of stress echocardiography. Because pulmonary congestion persists into recovery, stress LUS images can be acquired following stress echocardiography, similar to the acquisition of diastolic stress testing parameters. With this foundational study, the authors prove that stress LUS is reliable, accurate, and useful. In doing so, they lay the groundwork for this field to advance. The next generation of studies using stress LUS will include standardized reporting and a large number of patients to define the optimal methods, cutoffs, and application of this technique (6). These studies should capitalize on the strengths of stress LUS to determine how it can improve our standard methods of assessment. For example, can stress LUS identify patients with latent diastolic dysfunction by the development of pulmonary congestion in response to exercise? Does the number of exerciseinduced B-lines have an incremental value beyond their mere presence? Can the dynamic assessment of B-lines allow us to tailor heart failure therapies such as medications, mechanical circulatory support, and transcatheter mitral valve interventions? Stress Echo 2020 will answer some of these questions and likely generate many more",

In a metaanalysis of 19 studies and 11,636 patients with known or suspected CAD undergoing stress CMR, Lipinski et al. (8) reported an annualized hard outcome (cardiovascular death or nonfatal MI) rate of 4.9% and 0.8% for positive versus negative ischemia and 4.6% and 1.4% for positive versus negative LGE at median follow-up of 25 months. Mean LVEF for the included studies, however, ranged between 55% and 67%. Few studies have examined the prognostic impact of stress CMR in a population with impaired LVEF. Husser et al. (24) reported on 391 patients with reduced LVEF (mean 39%) undergoing stress CMR. At median follow-up of 1.8 years, presence of perfusion defect, but not LGE, was associated with major cardiovascular events. However, that study was limited by its relatively short follow-up duration and lack of adjustment for history of heart failure and LVEF. Our study significantly expands upon prior results and demonstrated that at median follow-up of 5.0 years, independent of LVEF, CMR-detected myocardial ischemia and LGE provided incremental prognostic value to a clinical model for cardiovascular outcomes. In patients with heart failure, particularly in those with depressed LVEF, assessment of etiology is of paramount importance in determining prognosis and treatment. Studies have previously demonstrated that both the presence and extent of coronary disease are predictive of long-term mortality in patients with cardiomyopathy (25,26). Although pharmacologicalFIGURE 4 Invasive Coronary Angiography and Revascularization at 90 Days Referred to Coronary Angiography Within 90 Days Coronary Revascularization Within 90 Days if Referred to Coronary Angiography Referral to invasive angiography at 90 days, with corresponding percentage of patients undergoing revascularization, stratified by presence and extent of ischemia (A) and presence or absence of ischemia and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) (B).therapy remains the mainstay treatment for LV dysfunction in either ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathies(5,27), there are significant differences in interventional therapies, including options for revascularization. There is also emerging evidence to remain normal in the presence of multivessel disease and \"balanced ischemia\"(33). For stress echocardiography, relatively few studies have examined its performance in patients with reduced LVEF. The largest series, including 70 patients, reported sensitivity and specificity of 83% and 71%, respectively(34). Because of its excellent spatial resolution, LGE imaging by CMR has the ability to accurate characterize the location and extent of myocardial scar.Previous studies examining patients with known obstructive CAD and reduced LVEF have detected ischemic pattern LGE in 80% to 100% of cases(35)(36)(37). Diagnostic accuracy of CMR to discern ischemic etiology in patients with new-onset heart failure was >95%, similar to coronary angiography(38). This is of particular significance, given the proportion of patients with prior infarct, but no clinical history of MI, and the prognostic importance of unrecognized MI(39). In our study, ischemicpattern LGE was present in 48% of the cohort but a history of MI in only 24%.A few studies using different imaging modalities have examined the prognostic value of noninvasive stress testing in patients with low LVEF. Majmudar et al. (40) studied 510 consecutive patients referred for stress positron emission tomography with resting LVEF #45%.

            "text": "cardiovascular events. In a multivariate model including etiology of LV dysfunction, neither ischemia nor scar was a significant predictor of cardiovascular events. In a substudy of the STITCH trial, which enrolled patients with ischemic heart failure with LVEF #35% and randomized them to CABG in addition to medical therapy, Panza et al.(41) evaluated 399 patients who underwent stress testing. Approximately one-half underwent single-photon emission computed tomography and the other onehalf dobutamine stress echocardiography. Sixty-four percent had evidence of ischemia, and at median follow-up of 56 months, the presence of ischemia did not predict all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, or all-cause mortality plus cardiovascular hospitalization. Our results suggest that stress CMR provides incremental value above a clinical model in predicting long-term hard cardiovascular outcomes and that this finding was independent of LVEF. A few key differences, however, exist between the present study and that reported by Panza et al., including differences in noninvasive modalities, population (suspected or known CAD vs. known CAD), LVEF (median 39% vs. mean 26%), and LV volumes.We reported on the downstream use of invasive angiography, revascularization, and cost of ischemic testing. Consistent with current guidelines (5) and clinical practice, the presence and extent of ischemia were strong drivers behind invasive investigation and revascularization therapy. Referral to angiography remained at the discretion of the treating physician. We observed that 35% of patients with mild, 59% with moderate, and 67% with severe ischemia on stress CMR were referred to angiography. Many studies that have shown benefit of revascularization in ischemic cardiomyopathy(42) were published toward the end of the eligibilityperiod of SPINS (2008 to 2013), which may explain the relatively lower rate of invasive therapy in those with higher burden of ischemia. Fifteen percent of patients with no evidence of ischemia still underwent diagnostic coronary angiography at 90 days, which likely reflects clinical practice at the time of study performance and the clinical recognition of high-risk features. In patients without CMR-detected ischemia who underwent revascularization, the majority had prior infarct. Because this study was conducted before the widespread adoption of fractional flow reserve to guide revascularization, we do not know whether all these interventions would have been performed under current indications. In terms of the cost of care of downstream ischemic testing, presence of ischemia was significant driver of resource use, particularly in the first 90 days, when it was associated with a 3-fold higher cost. The difference in cost was no longer significant after the second year of follow-up. STUDY LIMITATIONS. First, our participating sites consisted of experienced, high-volume CMR centers, and therefore it is unclear whether the results can generalize to less experienced centers. Second, given the retrospective design and limited number of patients who underwent revascularization, we were unable to assess for CMR guidance of medical therapy or coronary revascularization toward improvement of cardiovascular outcomes.Third, there was a limited number of patients with severe LV dysfunction (LVEF <30%), and hence our results may not be generalizable to this population or to those with end-stage ventricular remodeling. Fourth, LVEF determination was by CMR only, so the prognostic value of ischemia and LGE, adjusted to LVEF, may be different than if non-CMR-based LVEF was used. Finally, we excluded patients with a history of CABG from our study; this will have to be addressed in a future study. In this study of patients with impaired LVEF referred for clinical assessment for CAD, presence of ischemia and LGE on stress CMR was associated with worsened long-term cardiovascular prognosis.

            "text": "The Stress CMR Top SPINS On and On* Gonzalo Pizarro, MD, PHD T hirty years ago, Atkinson et al. (1) injected a bolus of gadolinium contrast endovenously and observed its transit through the cardiac chambers and myocardium. It was the beginning of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) perfusion imaging. At that time, dipyridamole vasodilator stress testing was commonly used in thallium-201 perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography scanning. Aiming to demonstrate the superiority of CMR in detecting perfusion abnormalities, Pennell et al. (2) began to perform vasodilator stress protocols inside the magnet. In this scenario, gadolinium injection had 2 different purposes: detection of inducible ischemia on first-pass perfusion imaging and detection of myocardial infarction (MI) on late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging. The technique experienced tremendous technical and clinical development, thereafter, becoming one of the most accurate noninvasive methods for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). During the past decade, numerous studies have been published addressing the prognostic significance of CMR in patients with known or suspected CAD (3). They have been focused mainly on 3 aspects: wall motion abnormalities and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on cine imaging, presence or extent of infarcted tissue on LGE imaging, and presence or extent of ischemic tissue on stress imaging. To evaluate the capability of stress CMR to stratify the risk of patients with suspected CAD, experienced centers in the United States was published (7). After following up more than 9,000 patients for up to 10 years, the investigators concluded that stress CMR was strongly associated with all-cause mortality. A subgroup of patients with LVEF lower than 55% was analyzed, revealing the same association. The Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance designed and promoted the retrospective SPINS (Stress CMR Perfusion Imaging in the United States) registry, collecting data from 13 CMR centers of excellence (8). A total of 2,349 patients referred for stress CMR were followed for a median period of 5.4 years. The investigators showed that patients without ischemia or scar experienced a very low incidence of cardiovascular events and had low average annual cost for subsequent ischemia testing. The presence of systolic dysfunction in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy is known to confer a higher risk for cardiovascular events. Heart failure (HF) is a complex and not completely understood multiorgan clinical syndrome, in which more than 50% of patients present with CAD as the underlying cause (9). Even though low LVEF is only an occasional component of HF pathophysiology, current guidelines maintain LVEF cutoffs for risk stratification and management. In this issue of iJACC, Ge et al. (10) report an important population: a total of 582 patients with LVEF <50% undergoing clinical vasodilator stress CMR for suspected ischemia (10). The study exploited 2 different sources of data: the aforementioned multicenter SPINS registry and a registry from theBrigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Median LVEF was 39%, with more than one-half of patients ISSN 1936-878X/$36.00 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcmg.2020.06.021 *Editorials published in JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging reflect the views of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of iJACC or the American College of Cardiology.

            "text": "Only 40% of the cohort had a history of HF, and 24% had a history of MI. Abnormal stress CMR results were detected in a total of 321 patients (55%), with either ischemia (30%) or prior MI (48%). The presence of silent ischemia and/or silent MI in patients without a history of CAD is a relevant finding that confirms previous CMR studies (3). The purpose of the study was to demonstrate the capability of stress CMR to stratify the risk of patients with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. The primary endpoint was defined as cardiovascular death or nonfatal MI, while the secondary endpoint was defined by a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, hospitalization for unstable angina, hospitalization for congestive HF, and unplanned late CABG.The main results resembled those of the original SPINS study(9), making it possible to reach similar conclusions: after a median follow-up period of 5 years, patients with myocardial ischemia, LGE, or both had higher rates of cardiovascular death and MI.Taking into account that the presence of LV systolic dysfunction is supposed to entail very high risk, it is remarkable to note that the annual primary event rate in patients with neither ischemia nor LGE was as low as 1.1%. When only ischemia or LGE was present, the annual rate was about 3% to 4%, while when both occurred in the same patient, the annual rate was8.8% for the primary endpoint and 17.3% for the secondary endpoint. Importantly, the incremental prognostic value of stress CMR was independent of LVEF. Probably the most important limitation of the study comes from its observational retrospective nature and the potential patient or referral selection bias. Nevertheless, real-world data from registries are necessary to define the potential applications of diagnostic and therapeutic measures. Images were interpreted by local readers with no core laboratory, but the investigators performed a careful quality assurance protocol in an attempt to homogenize the analysis. Quantification of ischemia or LGE (in grams of myocardium or transmurality) can improve the prognostic capacity of stress CMR (11). Ge et al. (10) did not include this information in their prognostic model. Strictly visual interpretation of the images was used to identify the presence or absence of ischemia and LGE, on a per segment and per patient basis. The investigators reached relevant conclusions by interpreting the results in a dichotomic fashion, raising the question of the importance of quantification in clinical stress CMR. Routine qualitative interpretation of ischemic defects and LGE seems to work well for risk stratification in patients with LV systolic dysfunction. Interestingly, the investigators specifically studied ischemic segments location and peri-infarct ischemia, finding that once adjusted for the presence of ischemia or LGE, peri-infarct ischemia was not independently associated with events. Apart from showing the excellent predictive value of stress CMR findings, the authors studied downstream health care costs in the follow-up period, finding, as expected, that the presence of ischemia resulted in higher use of invasive procedures and higher costs during the first 90 days.",

Using different LGE quantification methods results in different LGE sizes (43), with significant implications for risk stratification. These differences in LGE extent are explained by the limited spatial resolution of CMR rendering partial volume effects unavoidable (44). As a consequence, the LGE signal becomes patchy, and large gray zones are present. Nevertheless, this heterogeneity is not only due to technical limitations but also has a pathophysiological basis that holds substantial clinical relevance.",

            "text": "). Strengthening the value of the LGE gray zone even further, these studies have found a doseresponse effect-patients with a larger extent of LGE gray zone have a higher arrhythmic risk(36). In an animal study investigating imaging findings of the peri-infarct zone in pigs comparing histology, the authors found that an infarct scar and a viable myocardium were clearly delineated in all chronic myocardial infarctions, and islands of viable myocytes could be detected by Masson trichrome staining at the border zone of the infarcts(48). Therefore, it can be suggested that the bundles of the viable myocardium mix with the fibrotic scar tissue in the gray zone, indicating that re-entry routes for the slow electrical conduction might exist in the inhomogeneous infarct tissue. Furthermore, in a high magnetic field (7.0-T CMR scan) validation study, Schelbert et al.(49) found that by analyzing the histology andLGE of pigs' hearts after myocardial infarction, the border between the viable myocardium and theinfarct on histological sections revealed that some borders had sharp and distinct transitions between fibrotic regions and viable cardiomyocytes, but others demonstrated mixtures of viable myocytes and patches or fingers of fibrosis. Histological and highresolution LGE images identify both the heterogeneous peri-infarct border zone, where mixtures of viable cardiomyocytes and collections of fibrosis are intermingled, as well as the distinct edge of the infarct, where the infarct and myocardium are separate. However, after retrospective degradation of CMR images to a lower resolution (i.e., comparable with the resolution of clinical scans), the apparent size of the intermediate signal intensity peri-infarct border zone increased significantly as a function of resolution. This partial volume error only affected the sharp and distinct borders of the infarct, and the proportion of infarcted myocardium did not change significantly as image resolution was degraded (49). Therefore, image resolution has to be taken into account when assessing LGE gray zones. LGE gray zone needs to be optimized and standardized to allow clinical implementation because the current protocols involve complex and operator-dependent procedures. T1 MAPPING, ECV, AND T2 MAPPING. Although LGE is a sensitive method in detecting myocardial replacement fibrosis, it has limited capacity in discriminating interstitial fibrosis from a normal myocardium. Interstitial fibrosis is usually diffuse and microscopic; thus, it does not result in visual focal changes of signal intensity. Diffuse interstitial fibrosis can be assessed by native T1 mapping of the myocardium. Native T1 mapping allows quantification based on pixel values of T1 in each voxel and can depict even relatively small variations of T1 within the extracellular and intracellular compartments.Native T1 can change with a number of processes such as lipid accumulation, edema, and interstitial fibrosis, and, therefore, this technique has the potential to more accurately detect fibrosis (compared with signal intensity in arbitrary units)(50). With the use of extracellular paramagnetic contrast agents, structural changes in the myocardium can be \"amplified.\" Therefore, by mapping T1 before and after gadolinium, the ECV of the myocardium can be quantitatively calculated and serves as a surrogate for diffuse fibrosis. Several studies have confirmed a close correlation of myocardial ECV with histopathologically determined collagen volume fraction assessed from endomyocardial biopsies from patients(51,52);",

            "text": "Therefore, more evidence is needed in order to evaluate the value to guide therapy and potentially improve patient selection for ICD implantation using these new mapping techniques. T2 mapping, an emerging valuable clinical tool for better noninvasive assessment of myocardial edema than traditional T2weighted imaging, was shown in patients with acute myocardial infarction to accurately distinguish an infarcted from a salvaged myocardium(57). Whether and to what degree T2 mapping has significance in the risk stratification of sudden cardiac death remains unknown. FEATURE TRACKING. Left ventricular strain defined as the deformation of the myocardium can be assessed in echocardiography and CMR feature tracking. In a recent study, CMR feature trackingbased global longitudinal strain was independently associated with all-cause death in IHD. In fact, each 1% worsening in global longitudinal strain was associated with an 89.1% increased risk of death after adjustment for clinical and imaging risk factors including LVEF and LGE. The risk stratification could be refined by adding global longitudinal strain to the model, which resulted in a significant tion does not directly represent arrhythmogenic substrate but may rather act as a surrogate marker, this technique might be particularly useful when dealing with patients with contraindications for gadolinium-based contrast agents, when CMR scan time is an issue, and/or when LGE images are of nondiagnostic quality.THERAPIES AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVESCurrent guideline-recommended therapies for the treatment or prevention of SCD in IHD consist of optimal reperfusion strategies, treatment of predisposing risk factors, medications, catheter ablation of arrhythmia, and ICD implantation.MEDICATION. Besides antiarrhythmic medication (see later) and pharmacological prevention of ischemia using statins and platelet aggregation inhibitors, rapid reperfusion therapy (i.e., percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting) results in a decrease of SCD risk in patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome. Moreover, observational data in chronic coronary artery disease have shown that coronary reperfusion strategies added to optimal medical therapy modify the risk for SCD when noninvasively assessed ischemia exceeds 10% of the left myocardium (59). Medications are essential to controlling arrhythmia and improving symptoms in IHD across all LVEF subgroups. Among IHD patients with preserved LVEF, at present only the use of beta-blockers has demonstrated survival benefits toward SCD in randomized controlled trials. However, in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (either an angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]), an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor, and antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g., beta-blocker, amiodarone, and sotalol) have been shown to reduce the risk for SCD (60-62). With the advance of guidelinedirected medical therapies (GDMTs), patient mortality had declined among those with left ventricular dysfunction due to either ischemic or nonischemic causes (63). GDMTs may improve clinical outcomes and reduce the need for ICD therapy among patients whose heart failure demonstrates a response to medical therapy (64,65). Therefore, clinical trials are needed to evaluate the incremental benefits of ICD over GDMT in the modern era. Although beta-blockers reduce the arrhythmogenic effects of sympathetic stimulation, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and aldosterone receptor antagonists have been demonstrated to reverse remodeling and consecutively decrease fibrosis, a substrate and trigger for ventricular arrhythmia as outlined previously (66). This finding is of particular interest because these indirect-acting \"antifibrotic\" medications are readily available in clinical routine. One may speculate that patients with increased levels of diffuse fibrosis may benefit from more intense treatment by ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and aldosterone receptor antagonists. Future studies have to investigate whether CMR can optimize treatment strategy in these patients. The significance of fibrosis is not only emerging to predict SCD but also in heart failure overall (67). The consequences of myocardial interstitial fibrosis are detrimental to the failing heart, and a specific antifibrotic treatment would be appealing. However, the knowledge on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of fibrosis have poorly translated into diagnostics and therapeutics. This has partly been due to the paucity of instruments to identify myocardial fibrosis. Yet, the potential of stem cells and cardiac regenerative therapies targeting fibroblast regulation needs to be elucidated to identify possible therapeutic approaches to limit progressive cardiac fibrosis as the underlying arrhythmogenic substrate (68). ABLATION. If medication is not effective, not tolerated, or not desired by the patient, catheter ablation is an option in patients with symptomatic sustained VT. A recent trial showed that radiofrequency ablation of VT reduced the combined endpoint of mortality, VT storms, and appropriate shocks over drug/ antiarrhythmic treatment (69). Furthermore, radiofrequency catheter ablation reduced implantable ICD shocks and VT episodes in patients with sustained VT with IHD at follow-up (69-72). However, its impact on long-term patient mortality remains unknown at present. Moreover, to date, no trial has specifically assessed radiofrequency ablation versus standard medical therapy in patients with VT toward SCD as the primary outcome measure. Considering that the LGE gray zone has been described as the strongest predictor of appropriate ICD therapy (even outperforming LGE extent) (45), CMR-guided ablation could improve ablation success or potentially even defer ICD implantation. ICD IMPLANTATION. Although the cost-effectiveness ratio is below the $100,000 per quality-adjusted lifeyear threshold (73), prophylactic ICD implantation is associated with enormous health care expenditures given the combined cost of implanting ICD (i.e., Medicare reimburses about $30,000 per case), monitoring, and the downstream generator exchange.There is a large number of potentially eligible patients (i.e., more than 500,000 Medicare beneficiaries)(74).Current Class I recommendations for ICD implantation do not effectively use the therapeutic benefits of ICD therapy(1,2). SCD presents as a first cardiac event in approximately 50% of all patients who suffered an SCD(2). The majority of patients who presented with SCD have LVEF >35%(75,76). Conversely, over 80% of patients who underwent implantation of an ICD per current guideline recommendations never received an appropriate shock during follow-up of over 8 years(77), and approximately 10% of ICD patients experience inappropriate shocks (78) that are associated with both increased morbidity and mortality and substantial health care use and expenditures(79). As a result, current recommendations for ICD therapy suffer from inadequate risk stratification.Another issue is the low adherence to guidelines in patients eligible for ICD implantation. Approximately one-quarter of patients who receive an ICD to prevent SCD do not meet evidence-based indications for implantation(80), and <10% of eligible patients had an ICD implanted within 1 year after myocardial infarction(81). In the secondary prevention of SCD, an ICD is recommended after ischemia warranting revascularization has been excluded, and the patient is expected to live longer than 1 year. Conversely, the recommendations are more complex in the primary prevention of SCD. In patients with IHD, an ICD is indicated if LVEF is below 35% in patients with New York Heart Association functional class II or III, below 30% in patients with New York Heart Association functional class I, or below 40% if sustained VT is induced during electrophysiological study(1).HOW IMAGING MAY AID IN THERAPEUTIC DECISIONS.To date, none of the imaging modalities have been evaluated in a prospective randomized controlled trial setting guiding ICD therapy toward the improvement of outcomes. Challenges in conducting such randomized controlled trials include the established practice pattern of ICD implantation using current LVEF cutoff criteria, the high costs of ICD and subsequent monitoring, and the low relative risks of SCD in the large number of IHD patients at risk with only mild to moderate left ventricular dysfunction.",

The primary endpoint was HF hospitalization and/or cardiovascular death. Dedicated software (Circle Cardiovascular Imaging, Calgary, Alberta, Canada) was used for feature tracking analysis of the LA wall. The ethics committee of the Medical University of Vienna approved the study protocol (EK 796/2010). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to determine the prognostic relevance of phasic LA size and functional parameters. In addition, the Spearman (r) test was used to define factors correlated with LA phasic function. Baseline LA volumetric results included a maximum volume index (VI) of 55 AE 19 ml/m 2 , LAVI prior to LA contraction of 44 AE 16 ml/m 2 , minimum LAVI of 35 AE 17 ml/m 2 , and total LAEF of 39 AE 11%. The reservoir strain rate was 102%/s (IQR: 80 to 136); the conduit strain rate was \u00c077 %/s (IQR: 60 to 114); and the booster pump strain rate was \u00c0105%/s tions [17%], and 6 deaths [6%]). All parameters, except for maximum LAVI, were related with outcome by univariate Cox regression analysis. Two clustered multivariate regression models were applied. The volumetric parameters LAVI prior to atrial contraction, minimal LAVI, and total LAEF were included in model 1. Model 2 consisted of LA conduit strain rate, booster pump strain rate, and reservoir strain rate. Echocardiographic studies have shown that LA function in HFpEF is strongly associated with cardiovascular outcome and pulmonary vascular disease(1). In comparison with echocardiography, CMR provides superior spatial resolution, which allows exact cardiac wall motion measurements and atrial strain and strain rate analyses (2-4) but at the cost of temporal resolution and real-time imaging. The present results indicate that LA conduit function represents an important pathomechanistic determinant in HFpEF. It is closely linked to pulmonary vascular function and exercise capacity and ultimately cardiovascular outcome. These findings complement those from prior studies also showing that LA conduit function is closely and independently particularly CMR-derived LAEF and LA conduit strain rate can detect mechanical changes at earlier stages and are therefore superior to static LA volumetric measures in predicting adverse events in HFpEF (3). However, the use of CMR feature tracking for the assessment of LA conduit function is limited in clinical routine. Moreover, reference values for myocardial feature tracking are not established, and significant intervendor variability has been described (5). Therefore, LAEF could be used in daily practice. The present and other data support its superiority as a risk predictor over still widely used maximal LA expansion (1). Progressive aortic valve calcification (AVC) plays a central role in aortic stenosis (AS). Until recently, quantitative assessment of AVC distribution was not measurable in vivo. Computed tomography (CT) now provides high-quality, simple, and reproducible AVC quantification. We developed en face aortic valve imaging by re-registering CT datasets to precisely map and quantify AVC, aiming to analyze AVC distribution between and within cusps and to link those to AS severity. We included 418 subjects (age 76 AE 9 years, 69% men; ejection fraction >50%: 84%; n \u00bc 200 from the Mayo Clinic [Rochester, Minnesota], n \u00bc 218 from the",

Noncontrast CT datasets were reorientated en face using 3-dimensional multiplanar reconstruction. Each cusp was identified through its relationship to the sinuses of Valsalva and the interatrial septum. volume-rendered datasets were used to confirm anatomy and illustrate relationships between calcification distribution and systolic cusp movement. En face AVC mapping was performed cusp by cusp (quantified as the percentage of total calcium in the same view and expressed as absolute AVCd per cusp) and by assessing cusp-edge calcium extension, in which each cusp free-edge commissural segment was counted as calcium positive (score 1) if $50% was occupied by calcium, summating the valve ranging from 0 to 6 (Figure 1). Total valve edge calcification was categorized as none or mild (score 0 to 2), moderate (score 3 to 5), or severe (score 6). In 20 patients (55% severe AVCd) intra-and interobserver reproducibility of these measures were assessed, Our first result confirms that AVC is not evenly distributed. AVC mapping demonstrated consistent differences between cusps, with a most to least calcified cusp AVCd difference of 112 (IQR: 66 to 182) AU/cm 2 . Second, this AVC inhomogeneity is not random; in 61% of patients, AVC predominated in the noncoronary cusp, whether AS was hemodynamically severe or not (63% vs. 61%; p \u00bc 0.65), and accounted for 43 AE 17% of total AVC. Calcification of the right and left coronary cusp approximated each other (27 AE 13% vs. 29 AE 14% of total AVC; p \u00bc 0.42), and the specific cusp affected as most or least calcified showed no associations with AS severity. Third, relationships between AVC distribution and hemodynamic severity emerge: although AVCd differences between the most and least calcified cusps were larger in patients with hemodynamically severe versus moderate AS (145 [IQR: 103 to 215] AU/cm 2 vs. 80 [IQR: 46 to 119] AU/cm 2 ; p < 0.001), the presence of significant AVC asymmetry (defined as 1 cusp with <20% of total AVC) was univariately associated with nonsevere AS (p < 0.001).Fourth, the distribution of calcification within cusps is heterogenous. AVC was limited to commissures in 9% of cusps, extending with or without annular extension into incomplete or complete arcs (41% and 35% of cusps, respectively) (p < 0.001).Cusp-edge calcification not only increases in extent with severe calcification, but also varies considerably for any given AVC burden (Figure 1); this heterogeneity in AVC location has important hemodynamic consequences.

Tissue characterization by late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is a valuable tool for early detection and monitoring progression of myocardial fibrosis in the dystrophic heart (2). We previously showed that LV ejection fraction (LV-EF) #45% and a \"transmural\" pattern of LGE independently predict cardiac events in DMD/BMD (3). We aimed to describe the progression of cardiomyopathy by serial CMR and to relate it to the development of cardiovascular events. We prospectively enrolled 91 MD males (median age 29, interquartile range [IQR]: 21 to 43 years; 19 DMD/72 BMD) in whom at least 2 CMRs were performed-1 baseline and at least 1 follow-up. The study protocol complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local ethics committees. Informed consent was obtained from the patients prior to study inclusion. In addition to standard volumetric analysis of cine images, LGEwhen present-was quantified ($3 SD above normal myocardium) and expressed as % of LV mass. A transmural pattern was considered whenever $1 segment presented transmural LGE. The patients were followed up for a composite endpoint comprising cardiac death/transplantation (HTx) or either of: HF hospitalization, non-/sustained ventricular tachycardia (nsVT/VT). An arrhythmic endpoint was defined as detection of nsVT/VT in the surviving patients. At baseline, 92% of patients reported NYHA functional class I/II HF. Patients with DMD were significantly younger than BMD (14, IQR: 12 to 22 vs. 36, IQR: 24 to 46 years; p < 0.001). At baseline CMR, 43% of patients had a LV-EF <55% and 68% showed (exclusively non-ischemic) LGE. Twenty-five percent of patients had a LV-EF #45%, while LV-EF#35% was seen in 7%. Among LGE-positive patients, 24% presented a transmural LGE-pattern. LGE extent ranged from 1% to 44% with median of 9%. A high negative correlation between LGE extent and LV-EF was noted (Spearman-Rho -0.72; p < 0.001). positive (80% vs. 68%; p \u00bc 0.001) and had higher percentage of transmural LGE (37% vs. 24%; p < 0.0001) vs. baseline. In the LGE-positive patients at baseline (n \u00bc 62), LV-EF decreased from 50 AE 10% to 48 AE 10% (p < 0.001) on average with 0.7%/year and LGE extent increased from median 9% (IQR: 4% to 23%) to 12% (IQR: 7% to 27%) (p < 0.001) on average with 0.7%/year. The prevalence of transmural LGE almost doubled in these patients (from 24% to 44%; p < 0.001). In N \u00bc 11 initially LGE-free patients becoming LGE-positive at follow-up, median LGE extent was 2% (IQR: 1 to 9), none of them showing a transmural pattern. Among them, only a mildly impaired LV-EF was present in 4 at follow-up. During total follow-up of median 6 years (1 to 11 years), 4 cardiac deaths and 1 HTx occurred. Thirty-five further endpoints occurred in another 30 patients (three experienced 2 and 1 three nonfatal, non-HTx endpoints): HF hospitalizations in N \u00bc 8, sustained VT in n \u00bc 4 and nonsustained VT episodes in n \u00bc 23 patients. Thus, the composite endpoint occurred in 38% (n \u00bc 35) of patients. The secondary arrhythmic endpoint (nsVT/VT) occurred in 30% (n \u00bc 27) of DMD/BMD. nsVTs were exclusively detected on repeated ambulatory monitoring using an external event loop recorder and were mostly asymptomatic. Patients with a composite endpoint showed significantly lower EF and higher LGE prevalence, extent and frequency of transmural pattern at baseline and follow-up (Table 1). There was a significant difference in LV-EF worsening to #45% in MD with vs. without events (17% vs. 2%; p \u00bc 0.012).

Does a Prior Normal Transthoracic Echocardiogram Negate the Need for Another Echocardiogram? Noninvasive transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is commonly performed in the evaluation of syncope.However, despite its utility as a diagnostic tool, TTE for syncope is associated with higher costs and length of stay, without a mortality impact (1). Therefore, risk stratification of syncope patients prior to TTE referral could reduce health care costs. As the overall rate of TTE use rises nationally(2), many syncope patients are likely to have had a prior TTE. To our knowledge, no study has assessed whether data from a prior TTE can help predict the diagnostic yield of a new TTE in patients presenting with syncope. We hypothesized that information from a prior TTE would allow providers to better riskstratify patients, and thereby both improve diagnostic yield for those with a prior abnormal TTE and reduce the need for another TTE for those with a prior normal TTE. We retrospectively identified 2,000 consecutive TTEs performed for syncope between November 11, 2013, and November 26, 2017, at a large academic medical center. A total of 27 TTEs were excluded for erroneous coding, and 3 were uninterpretable due to very poor image quality. The remaining 1,970 TTEs (mean age 63 years; 52% women) included 31.2% (n \u00bc 615) with a prior TTE in our electronic database, dating back to July 1, 2000 (time since prior TTE <1 year for 32.0%, >5 years for 28.8%). Older age, African-American race, and inpatient status were associated with a higher likelihood of having a prior TTE (71.1 years vs. 59.7 years, 19.1% vs. 12.9%, and 68.8% vs. 62.9%, respectively, all p #0.01). TTE reports were independently reviewed for any findings to potentially explain syncope using the criteria in",

In conclusion, our retrospective cohort study of 1,970 consecutive TTEs performed for the evaluation of syncope demonstrates that a prior normal TTE does not affect the TTE-positive diagnostic yield. Therefore, patients presenting with syncope should be considered for TTE despite the presence of a prior normal TTE. Further research should assess how specific findings on a prior TTE correlate with outcomes in patients presenting with syncope, and include this type of information in risk stratification models.",

In this retrospective, observational study, 45 patients with AFD underwent CMR with T1 mapping using shortened modified Look-Locker inversion recovery sequences, 2-dimensional echocardiography, and quantification of Mainz Severity Score Index (MSSI). Patients were divided into 3 groups (n \u00bc 15 each) with increasing severity: 1) normal T1, no LVH; 2) low T1, no LVH; and 3) LVH. Patients were compared with 15 healthy control subjects. CMR-FT was applied for the analysis of LA strain (total, conduit, booster) and volumes. Mean age of the patients with AFD was 38.5 AE 15.1 years; there were 34 (56%) men. No differences in sex distribution and \"classic\" mutation prevalence were found between groups. Higher values of global or cardiovascular MSSI, rate of patients assuming enzyme replacement therapy, indexed LV mass, LV maximum wall thickness, and late gadolinium enhancement-positive segments were observed from groups 1 to 3, reflecting a gradient of disease severity. Native T1 values were normal in healthy control subjects and in group 1 patients and were progressively lower in group 2 and 3. LA total strain was comparable between control subjects and patients in group 1 (36.8 AE 6.4% vs. 36.8 AE 6.0%; p \u00bc 0.45), while a significant difference was found between group 1 and group 2 (36.8 AE 6.4% vs. 29.9 AE 5.2%; p \u00bc 0.01). Group 3 showed a significantly reduced LA total strain compared with all other groups (19.6 AE 4.8%; p < 0.001 for all). A progressive reduction in LA conduit strain was observed from control subjects to group 3, paralleling the increase in patients with echocardiographic diastolic dysfunction. No difference among groups was found in LA booster strain values (Figure 1). Atrial volumes were significantly increased in group 3 compared with the other groups. Overall, LA total strain showed very good correlation with native septal T1, LV maximum wall thickness, atrial volumes, and global or cardiovascular MSSI. Univariate regression analysis showed a significant association between LA total strain and age, native septal T1, and MSSI but not with sex or presence of \"classic\" mutations. This is the first study systematically assessing LA function by CMR-FT in a population of patients with AFD stratified according to the degree of LV involvement. Atrial deformation was already impaired in patients with AFD with low T1 values (tracking Gb3 deposition), even in the absence of LVH and diastolic dysfunction.

The ischemic myocardial burden is an established metric used to guide clinical decision making and is traditionally assessed using noninvasive stress imaging. The potential to incorporate FFR CT values (\"depth\" of ischemia), together with CT-derived ischemic myocardial burden (\"extent\" of ischemia), has yet to be explored and may improve the diagnosis of hemodynamically significant coronary stenosis.

Future studies are needed to further investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of the APPROACH FFRCT technique, including validation of the optimal diagnostic threshold. The integration of such techniques with FFR CT and emerging metrics such as shear stress and high-risk plaque quantification may have the potential to transform cardiac CT into an even more sophisticated platform for predicting cardiovascular risk and guiding therapeutic decision making. Analysis Using Feature-Tracking CMR to Detect LV Systolic Dysfunction in Myocardial Iron Overload Disease Iron-induced cardiomyopathy with progressive heart failure is the leading cause of death in patients with systemic iron overload, and early detection is vital for chelator therapy (1). The transverse relaxation time T2* (\u00bc1/R2*) nonlinearly reflects tissue iron concentration and allows pre-symptomatic detection of myocardial iron deposition using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is the reference standard for evaluating systolic function. However, its sensitivity to indicate iron-induced cardiomyopathy is limited to later disease stages. Instead, myocardial strain has been shown to detect cardiac dysfunction even at subclinical levels in various diseases (2). We aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance of feature-tracking CMR to indicate systolic cardiac impairment due to myocardial iron toxicity. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the General Medical Council for Hamburg, Germany. Patients with systemic iron overload disease (n \u00bc 123; mean age 29 AE 14 years) and 47 control subjects (mean age 31 AE 12 years) underwent CMR using a 4-element phased-array coil (1.5-T; Symphony, Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Erlangen, Germany). Multi-slice short-axis cine steady-state freeprecision images were acquired (TE \u00bc 1.6 ms, TR \u00bc 50 ms, FA \u00bc 65 , slice thickness \u00bc 6 mm, phases \u00bc 25). For assessing the transverse myocardial relaxation time T2*, a multipurpose iron measureelectrocardiogram-gated, TR/TE1/DTE \u00bc 244/1.3/ 1.16 ms, Nte \u00bc 12, FA \u00bc 20 , bandwidth \u00bc 1,955 Hz/ pixel). A monoexponential function with constant signal offset was applied to region of interest-based signal intensities of the mid-papillary septum. Elevated myocardial iron levels were defined by a conservative threshold of T2* <20 ms. LVEF was analyzed by semi-automated delineation of epicardial and endocardial contours using a dedicated software (cvi42, Circle Cardiovascular Imaging Inc., Calgary, Alberta, Canada); trabeculae and papillary muscles were included in the ventricular volumes and excluded from the myocardial mass for better reproducibility (3). Myocardial strain was determined by using the feature-tracking software Segment version 2.1.R.6108 (Medviso, Lund, Sweden). The entire image content (i.e., blood pool, entire myocardium) is used during the optimization process instead of tracking only the myocardial boundaries (4). Global radial strain (GRS) and global longitudinal strain (GLS) were measured on 3 long-axis cine series and global circumferential strain (GCS) on 3 short-axis cine series (4). In patients with septal T2* <20 ms (group A: 66 of 123) and T2* >20 ms (group B), median T2* with quartiles [25% to 75%] of 9.3 [6.3 to 11.1] ms and 33 [27 to 37] ms were obtained, respectively. Median ferritin levels in group A were higher compared with those in group B (2,208 [1,225 to 5,185] mg/l vs. 1,093 [532 to 1,990] mg/l; p < 0.001) and in the control subjects (group C: 88 [38 to 136] mg/l). pair-wise comparisons among groups A, B, and C, a post hoc test (Games-Howell test) was used: LVEF was decreased in group A compared with group B (54 AE 14% vs. 61 AE 6%; p < 0.01), whereas group B did not differ from group C (62 AE 6%; p \u00bc 0.5). All strain parameters (GRS, GCS, and GLS) were significantly decreased in group A compared with group B, especially GLS (-15 AE 3% vs. -18 AE 3%; p < 0.0001). Comparing groups B and C, both GRS and GLS were different (p < 0.0001), although GCS was not (p \u00bc 0.6). Receiver-operating characteristic analysis resulted in the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91 (p < 0.0001; 95% CI: 0.85 to 0.96) and a cutoff defined by Youden's index >\u00c019% for GLS to indicate impairment of systolic LV function in group A with a sensitivity of 88% (95% CI: 78 to 95) and a specificity of 79% (95% CI: 64 to 89) (Figure 1A). AUC values for GRS (0.80; 95% CI: 0.72 to 0.87) and GCS (0.77; 95% CI: 0.69 to 0.85) were higher than for LVEF (0.68; 95% CI: 0.58 to 0.76). AUC values in group B",

Patients <18 years of age, with an absence of PH in the RHC, group 2 PH, and incomplete clinical or CMR data were excluded. Steady-state free precession cine imaging was used to quantify RV volumes, and flow imaging perpendicular to the main pulmonary artery (PA) was used to calculate stroke volume (SV). Coupling was estimated Hybrid method: We combined RHC and CMR information such as Ea \u00bc (mean PA pressure \u00c0 PA wedge pressure)/SV (where SV is obtained from PA flow imaging) and Ees \u00bc mean PA pressure/endsystolic volume (ESV). CMR flow method: The numerator for Ea was simplified as mean PA pressure alone, so that Ea/ Ees could be expressed as ESV/SV, with SV again obtained from PA flow imaging. CMR volume method: Coupling is also simplified as ESV/SV, but SV was obtained from cine images. All individuals consented to the procedures, and the Mount Sinai Hospital Institutional Review Board approved the study with a waiver of informed consent. A total of 133 patients were included; their mean age was 53.3 AE 13.5 years, 72.2% were female, 69.2% had pulmonary arterial hypertension, 12% had PH secondary to lung disease, 5.3% had chronic thromboembolic PH, and 13.5% had miscellaneous etiologies. Mean PA pressure was 45.2 AE 11.6 mm Hg, RVEF was 37.1 AE 14.5%, and Ea/Ees (Hybrid method) was 2.3 AE 3.1. During a median follow-up of 3.4 years, 73 (54.9%) patients died. Patients who died were more often male, used diuretic agents more commonly, and had lower RVEF, larger RV volumes, and pericardial effusions. Notably, low PA oxygen saturation was the only invasive index associated with increased mortality. In Cox regression analyses, the Hybrid and Flow methods were independently associated with death after accounting for age, sex, PA oxygen saturation, RVEF, diuretic use, or pericardial effusion (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.103 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.012 to 1.203; p \u00bc 0.027] and aHR: 1.084 [95% CI: 1.004 to 1.172; p \u00bc 0.04], respectively). However, neither the Volume method nor RVEF (entered separately in the models due to high collinearity) was a predictor of events (aHR: 1.006 [95% CI: 0.833 to 1.214; p \u00bc 0.952] and aHR: 0.996 [95% CI: 0.976 to 1.016; p \u00bc 0.687]) (Figure 1). Models' goodness of fit and discrimination were comparable for all methods, with an Akaike information criterion of 580 and Harrel C statistic of 0.68. An analysis restricted to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension produced similar findings (data not shown). In individuals with relatively preserved RV function (RVEF >35%), neither the Hybrid nor Flow method was associated with outcomes after adjusting for RVEF. However, the Volume method and RVEF (both entered separately) remained associated with mortality (aHR: 3.394 [95% CI: 1.284 to 8.975; p \u00bc 0.014] and aHR: 0.942 [95% CI: 0.900 to 0.985; p \u00bc 0.009], respectively). Conversely, in patients with RVEF #35%, the Hybrid and Flow methods were independently associated with mortality (aHR: 1.128 [95% CI: 1.030 to 1.235; p \u00bc 0.009] and aHR: 1.105 [95% CI: 1.021 to 1.196; p \u00bc 0.014]) after adjusting for RVEF, but the Volume method and RVEF were not.As expected, given the mathematical relationship between the CMR volume method and RVEF, these 2 approaches exhibited a perfect (curvilinear) correlation. Our results suggest that estimates of right ventriculoarterial coupling that use CMR-based ESV and PA flow-derived SV, alone or in combination with RHC, predict survival in this heterogeneous cohort of patients with PH and may be advantageous over RVEF in certain scenarios such as severe RV dysfunction. The reasons remain speculative, but they may be related to a wider range of possible values once RVEF is low, due to the still curvilinear relationships with RVEF (data not shown) and/or less preload dependency than RVEF, which requires enddiastolic volume for calculation (4).Our findings are limited by the retrospective and observational nature of this study from a single tertiary center, as well as by the inclusion of multiple PH etiologies.",

We included PROMISE patients who underwent cardiac computed tomography (CT) imaging and observed them for a median of 2 years for adverse cardiac events (composite of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and hospitalization for unstable angina) (3).

However, this association attenuated after adjustment for the ASCVD risk (p \u00bc 0.264). EAT attenuation was not associated with events (p \u00bc 0.409). In patients with stable chest pain and increased cardiovascular risk, we found higher EAT volume in male subjects, the elderly, and those with increased cardiovascular risk and advanced CAD (i.e., higher CAC score, SIS, HRPF). Nevertheless, these observations did not translate into an association between EAT volume and adverse events beyond traditional cardiovascular risk factors. In accord with Mancio et al. (1), a meta-analysis with w20,000 asymptomatic, low-risk subjects from mostly large longitudinal studies with long-term follow-up (e.g., FHS [Framingham Heart Study], MESA [Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis], HNR [Heinz Nixdorf Recall] study, EISNER [Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis by Noninvasive Imaging Research] study, and the Rotterdam study), our results showed a strong relationship between EAT, cardiovascular risk factors, and extent of CAD. However, we did not find an independent association between EAT volume and adverse events.In a symptomatic population, EAT may have low short-term prognostic utility due to many confounding elements such as clinical risk factors, presence of established CAD, and management strategy (e.g., medical therapy, revascularization). These elements are physician dependent and may have varied between sites due to the pragmatic design of the PROMISE trial. Moreover, PROMISE patients already had an indication for CTA, based on their symptoms and pretest probability. Although longitudinal studies in asymptomatic cohorts have shown independent predictive prognostic value for deep learning-derived EAT, independent of ASCVD risk score (2), the prognostic relationship may be attenuated for symptomatic patients undergoing CTA due to the reasons mentioned earlier.We found no relationship between overall EAT attenuation and events. Thus, the cardiovascular riskFIGURE 1 EAT on Cardiac CT Imaging EAT Segmentation on Cardiac CT EAT by CV Risk Factors and CAD on CT * Deep learning (DL) segmentation system was trained on manually segmented CTs from the Framingham Heart Study (n = 628), PROMISE (n = 130), and National Lung Screening Trial (n = 100). The system reached a high accuracy in an independent subset of 1,010 PROMISE patients with manual EAT measurements (median dice: 0.952; IQR: 0.943-0.958).may be better predicted by the local attenuation of EAT directly adjacent to the coronaries. As reported by others, peri-coronary EAT attenuation has shown a strong association with cardiovascular events (4). The differences may be due to the local effects of EAT versus the global attenuation assessed in our study.To conclude, our results show a limited short-term predictive value of EAT in symptomatic patients with increased cardiovascular risk. Further research is needed to identify factors influencing the relationship between EAT and adverse outcomes.",

With respect to outcomes, there were a total of 40 MACEs (median follow-up 24 months). Significant DD was associated with MACEs on Kaplan-Meier analysis (log-rank chisquare: 22.08; p < 0.001). In a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model that incorporated significant clinical factors (age, chronic kidney disease) and LV ejection fraction (LVEF), significant DD was the most powerful predictor of outcomes (hazard ratio: 2.71; 95% confidence interval: 1.28 to 5.71; p \u00bc 0.008), and its inclusion in sequential models produced a significant increment in the chi-square model.
