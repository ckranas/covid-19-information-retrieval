The roles of immune indicators (such as IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and fgl2), gene polymorphisms, HBV genotypes, and gene mutations as early clinical indicators. 2. Intensive Care Unit monitor patients with severe hepatitis include intracranial pressure, infection, blood dynamics, respiratory function, renal function, blood coagulation function, nutritional status and blood purification process. Nursing care should not only include routine care, but psychological and special care (complications). 3. Nutrition support and nursing care should be maintained throughout treatment for severe hepatitis. Common methods of evaluating nutritional status include direct human body measurement, creatinine height index (CHI) and subject global assessment of nutrition (SGA). Malnourished patients should receive enteral or parenteral nutrition support. 4. Immune therapies for severe hepatitis include promoting hepatocyte regeneration (e.g. with glucagon, hepatocyte growth factor and prostaglandin E1), glucocorticoid suppressive therapy, and targeting molecular blocking. Corticosteroid treatment should be early and sufficient, and adverse drug reactions monitored. Treatments currently being investigated are those targeting Toll-like receptors, NK cell/NK cell receptors, macrophage/immune coagulation system, CTLA-4/ PD-1 and stem cell transplantation. 5 . In addition to conventional drugs and radioiodine, corticosteroids and artificial liver treatment can also be considered for severe hepatitis patients with hyperthyreosis. Patients with gestational severe hepatitis require preventive therapy for fetal growth restriction, and it is necessary to choose the timing and method of fetal delivery. For patients with both diabetes and severe hepatitis, insulin is preferred to oral antidiabetic agents to control blood glucose concentration. Liver toxicity of corticosteroids and immune suppressors should be monitored during treatment for severe hepatitis in patients with connective tissue diseases including SLE, RA and sicca syndrome. Patient with connective tissue diseases should preferably be started after the antiviral treatment with nucleos(t) ide analogues. 6. An artificial liver can improve patients' liver function; remove endotoxins, blood ammonia and other toxins; correct amino acid metabolism and coagulation disorders; and reverse internal environment imbalances. Non-bioartificial livers are suitable for patients with early and middle stage severe hepatitis; for late-stage patients waiting for liver transplantation; and for transplanted patients with rejection reaction or transplant failure. The type of artificial liver should be determined by each patient's condition and previous treatment purpose, and patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions and complications. Bio-and hybrid artificial livers are still under development. 7. MELD score is the international standard for choosing liver transplantation.",

If an early prediction can be made with specific clinical signs before the occurrence of AECHB, the disease progression may be interrupted by a timely effective management. Currently, although researches have been focused on prognosis of estimation and prediction on AECHB, there is no obvious progress due to lacking sensitive, reliable and systematic markers and grading systems for early prediction of AECHB. Establishment of AECHB staging system by a combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, mutation of HBV genome, host immune response and genetic susceptibility to evaluate various risks, may be useful for specific early intervention and treatment to elevate curative effect, and therefore to reduce morbidity and mortality in these patients.",

            "text": "Currently, effective assessment of AECHB is still on its way to fulfill the anticipation of clinicians and researchers around the world. Several common clinical markers may contribute to early diagnosis of AECHB, including T.Bil, prothrombin activity (PTA), cholinesterase (CHE), serum albumin and pre-albumin et al. According to the definition of liver failure by the Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure Study Group of Asia-Pacific Liver Congress in 2008, serum T.Bil \u22655 mg/dL (85 \u03bcmol/L) and coagulation dysfunction including international normalized ratio (INR) \u22651.5 or PTA <40% are considered as necessary points for the diagnosis. So, T.Bil and PTA are the most frequently used markers to evaluate the severity and prognosis of patients with severe hepatitis. Synthesis of serum albumin and CHE reduced when hepatocytes were injured, and CHE is more sensitive than albumin in reflecting hepatic synthesis function Researches have reported that CHE level can predict the degree of severe hepatitis recovery. The half-life of serum pre-albumin is much shorter than serum albumin (1.9 days vs. 20 days), and the two proteins share similar metabolism pathways. So, serum pre-albumin may be more sensitive to reflect albumin metabolic function in the liver. Researchers have observed the dynamic change of serum pre-albumin levels in patients with severe hepatitis, and found that serum pre-albumin levels decreased at early stage of liver injury. Another study compared serum pre-albumin levels between patients with different liver diseases, and found that serum pre-albumin levels restored rapidly along with the recovery in those who suffered mild hepatocyte necrosis and with a favorable prognosis, while serum pre-albumin levels always stayed low in patients with severe hepatitis. Sustained serum pre-albumin levels <100 mg/L can be regarded as one of the markers for early diagnosis of severe hepatitis in clinical practice. Other researchers have found that serum thymosin \u03b24 can be used as one of the markers for early prediction of hepatitis B related liver. Hepatic encephalopathy is required for the diagnosis of liver failure, and early diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy contributes to early prediction of liver failure. Early stage of hepatic encephalopathy can be realized not only by clinical manifestations such as mild personality change or abnormal behavior, but also by laboratory test results. Patients with abnormal electroencephalogram, special intelligence quantitative test or evoked potentials were usually checked out with subclinical hepatic encephalopathy. Bernal et al. found that arterial blood ammonia level (>100 \u03bcmol/L) is an independent risk factor for severe hepatic encephalopathy in patients with acute liver failure (ALF) with a prediction accuracy of 70%, MELD score is also a risk factor. Furthermore, the two combinations, blood ammonia level and MELD score, can elevate specificity and accuracy for prediction. Takikawa et al. established models for acute severe hepatitis progressing to hepatic encephalopathy by Logistic regression analysis, and their results indicated that older age, prolonged PTA, elevated T.Bil levels, viral hepatitis (except hepatitis A or E) were risk factors for hepatic encephalopathy.",

Yoshiba et al. enrolled acute severe hepatitis patients without hepatic encephalopathy, but with PTA <40%. Viral type, T.Bil level and CHE were selected from 13 clinical and laboratory markers to establish a prediction model. Their results showed that T.Bil level is positively correlated to the incidence of liver failure, while CHE level exhibited a negative correlation. Then researchers confirmed that the judging formula showed a satisfied efficacy in early diagnosis of liver failure. The specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 83.3%, 98.3%, 94.7%, 95.0%, 93.8%, respectively.",

            "text": "It is known that molecules and intrinsic modulation factors are involved in the course of ALF. For example, these host immune factors can cause severe liver in situ inflammatory injury and systematic inflammatory reaction syndrome, which indicate progression to multiple organ failure and final poor outcomes. Mononuclear macrophages release abundant pro-inflammation and anti-inflammation cytokines after activation, the severity degree of the diseases are closely related to proinflammation cytokine levels of peripheral blood in patients with ALF. In peripheral blood, levels in tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) are much higher in ALF patients who failed to survive or urgently needed to perform liver transplantation than those who survived. Human fibrinogen-like protein 2/fibroleukin (fgl2), produced from activated macrophage, belongs to fibrinogen super-family. This protein can catalyze prothrombin to thrombin directly, thus initiate coagulation process rapidly and lead to thrombus formation. Recently, researchers have found that fgl2 was specifically highly expressed in peripheral monocytes and liver tissues in AECHB patients, and its level was closely correlated to the severity of the disease. The above findings indicated that peripheral pro-inflammation cytokine levels may be helpful for prognosis prediction in patients with ALF. Except for secreting inflammatory cytokines, mononuclear macrophage initiate acquired immune response through antigen presentation, the expression of human leukocyte antigen II molecules, especially the human leukocyte antigen-DR, which are responsible for antigen presentation, are vital to monocyte activation. Antoniades et al. noticed a significant decrease of human leukocyte antigen-DR expression in peripheral monocytes accompanied by a significant increase of serum anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10) expression levels in patients with ALF, suggesting that function states of peripheral monocytes in patients with ALF can be used for monitoring disease progression and predicting clinical outcomes. The concept of Th17 cell was proposed in 2005, the biological function, differentiation process and cytokines expressed from Th17 cells were totally different from Th1 and Th2 cells, by recruiting and activating neutrophil granulocyte to mediate inflammation effectively by secretion of cytokines such as interleukin 17 (IL-17), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and TNF\u03b1. Zhang et al. found that Th17 cells gathered in peripheral blood and liver in chronic hepatitis B patients with acute on chronic liver failure, the increase frequency of Th17 cells are closely correlated to HBV virus titer, serum ALT levels and inflammatory activity of liver tissue, indicating that Th17 may play a role in predicting the prognosis of chronic hepatitis B patients with acute on chronic liver failure. PD-L/PD-1 signal pathway can inhibit activation of T and B lymphocytes in the initial sites and target sites during immune responses, which is important to maintain peripheral immune tolerance. Zhang et al. analyzed different types of hepatitis B patients by modern immune technologies including pentamer staining, signal pathway blockade, to investigate the expression of PD-1 molecule on viral specific CD8 + T cells and the relationship between PD-1 and disease progression. They found that high expression of PD-1 in early stage can specifically inhibit host immune response to reduce liver injury, while low expression in delayed stage leads to a loss of inflammation control, and by this way it may induce ALF. This study uncovered the protective modulation mechanism of the negative regulation molecule PD-1 in the course of ALF, and indicated that PD-1 may be one of the important markers in predicting prognosis of acute hepatitis B or ALF.",

More and more evidences showed that disease progression and prognosis are correlated with HBV genotypes in patients with chronic hepatitis B. While the result of studies in the relationship between HBV genotype and AECHB from different regions varies. In worldwide, researchers pointed out that the patients with HBV genotype A and B are easier to achieve HBeAg seroconversion and suffer milder liver lesions than those with HBV genotype D and C, respectively. While divergence still exist in studies from different regions. Imamura et al. found that detection rate of genotype B is significant higher in the population with fulminant hepatitis B than in population with acute self-limited hepatitis B. A multi-center study from Japan showed that in 301 patients with acute HBV infection, genotype B is the independent prediction factor for acute fulminant hepatitis by multivariate regression analyses. While another multicenter study also from Japan showed that patients with genotype C occupied 80% and 69% in patients with fulminant liver failure and acute fulminant liver failure on the basis of hepatitis B reactivation, respectively. These results indicate that patients with genotype C are more likely to suffer from fulminant liver failure. Recently, we have found that the proportion of severe hepatitis in patients with genotype B was not lower than those with genotype C, indicating a complicated relationship between genotype and severity or prognosis, which needs further investigation.",

Currently, the major sites reported to be related with AECHB are the terminal mutation at 1896 in pre-C gene and 1762/1764 double mutations in promoter of C gene. Imamura et al. performed a study on 61 patients with hepatitis B in Chiba Japan, and found that site mutation rates of 1896 in pre-C gene and 1762/1764 in promoter of C gene are much higher in patients with fulminant hepatitis than in patients with acute self-limited hepatitis. A study performed by Sainokami also indicated that G1896A and (or) G1899A in pre-C region and T1753A/C and (or) T1754C/G and (or) A1762T/G1764A in C region were correlated to fulminant hepatitis. In Japan, therefore, site 1896 terminal mutation in pre-C region was considered as one of the independent prediction factors for fulminant liver failure. However, this correlation did not seem to be the same in different areas due to differential genotype distribution. For example, studies from Taiwan, China showed that site 1896 terminal mutation in pre-C region of HBV plays a protective role in liver function decompensation.",

Due to the different including strategies in different period of severe hepatitis, accurate diagnosis on the severity and period of the course may help clinicians making optimal individualized therapeutic schedule for each patient. Early prediction and course surveillance show important significance for clinical guidance. Management in severe hepatitis B is a big issue for medical and health enterprises in China. Meanwhile, organ transplantation was limited by various factors, shortage of liver donor, immune rejection and lifetime intake of immune suppressive drugs after transplantation significantly reduce long-term survival in these patients. Thus, it is necessary to find an effective therapeutic approach to fit our national conditions. It is important to find the key target of anti-virus gene therapy and host immune mediated gene therapy for severe hepatitis B, so as to establish gene therapy cell models, animal models and pre-clinical research system, to construct bone marrow stem cell components of functional liver tissue and investigate its short-term and long-term efficacy.

When the liver cells which are sensitive to the hypoxia are severely damaged, that their ability to uptake the oxygen is impaired leads to the further degeneration, necrosis [13] . The mortality is negatively correlated with the low oxygen saturation. Therefore, hypoxia, which showed the illness in the severe conditions and further detritions, is one of the important prognostic factors, oxygen uptake is one of the effective ways to improve the hypoxia, and the better way is to maintain 95% or more of the SaO 2 through inhaling 1-3 L/ min of the oxygen flow.

The rate of ICH in acute liver failure is as higher as 20-30%, which is greater than that in the chronic liver failure and can result in fatal cerebral herniation. One thing should be noted that patients with hepatic encephalopathy, does not mean that there is ICH, such as there is no cerebral edema in most of the decompensated cirrhotic patients with HE. Higher grades of encephalopathy correlate with a higher risk of ICH, and 20-25% of ALF deaths have been attributed to ICH historically, though more recent data show significantly fewer deaths (5-13%) directly resulting from ICH [10] . The pathological mechanism of cerebral edema is not completely understood, it is appeared that the rapid rise of the ammonia may played a critical role in development of the cerebral edema. Ammonia crosses the blood-brain barrier to be taken up by the astrocytes, where it converts to the osmotically active glutamine, water passively diffuse into the astrocyte, causing edema. In addition, inflammatory cytokines exacerbate vasodilation, resulting in the swelling worse. In contrast, Inpatients with liver cirrhosis complicated hyperammonemia, glutamine accumulated in astrocytes in relatively slow speed since the organic permeable material can be discharged from the cell, so that it can be maintained intracellular osmotic pressure relative balance with outside, which may explain why the less cerebral edema and ICH in patients with liver cirrhosis. In addition, in patients with acute liver failure, the enhanced anaerobic glycolysis could easily lead to the accumulation of lactic acid in the body, as well as mitochondrial dysfunction, which can promote the formation of cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure (intracranial pressure, ICP) [15] .",

However, compared with invasive ICP monitoring, it is not as intuitive and accurate as invasive ICP monitoring and has a lower sensitivity to early intracranial pressure elevation, when the ICH is diagnosed, the brain has been significantly damaged, which leaves no chance of liver transplantation. For this reason, for patients with liver failure, on the one hand, a prospective, randomized, controlled multi-center clinical trial should be conducted to compare invasive and non-invasive ICP monitoring to decide which one is better in guidance to reduce the ICH and improve the prognosis.

Therefore, low tidal volume lung protective ventilation strategy should be adopted, tidal volume of 4-6 mL/kg, plateau pressure \u226430 mmHg may be considered in these settings. Its purpose is to minimize barotrauma caused by mechanical ventilation (barotrauma) and biological injury (biotrauma) and reduce ventilator-associated ALI/ARDS. However, in the implementation of such lung protective ventilation strategy, increased P CO2 and hypercapnia may be occurred due to hypoventilation, leading to dilatation of brain's blood vessels and increased ICP, the appropriate respiratory rate would be used to maintain adequate minute ventilation to prevent this from happening. In addition, conservative fluid administering can reduce the occurrence of pulmonary edema, an appropriate PEEP can facilitate the lung recruitment and improve the hypoxemia, but it is possible to lead the reduction in blood flow returning and liver. Therefore, respiratory support modes and parameters should be considered in these scenaria to benefit the patients with liver failure from the mechanic ventilation [26] .",

Since 2002, UNOS has used this system to assess the severity of the patients and to allocate the organs and widely used in the other countries. The system gives each person a score based on how urgently he or she needs liver transplantation within the next 3 month and no longer based on principle of \"first come, first served\". The unreasonable allocation of the organ is avoided to the maximum. But there are still some disadvantages for MELD scoring system: First, although variables are finally included in the MELD scoring system is determined by the multivariate analysis, these variables were first selected empirically for their potential impact on the prognosis of the patients, thus some important variables may not be included. Second, the variables in MELD scoring system theoretically are objective, it incorporates laboratory parameters that are easily available and reproducible, but some of them (creatinine, bilirubin) are varied with the treatment and complications (diuretic, sepsis or hemolysis). Third, In studies in which liver patients' plasma samples were tested using different prothrombin reagents, there was a substantial degree of variation in INR values. In china, not all of the liver centers use INR as a marker for liver failure patients. Fourth, the MELD score, which was initially created to predict survival rate in patients with complications of portal hypertension undergoing elective placement of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS), is used as a predictor for decompensated liver cirrhosis and ACLF except ALF. Fifth, this system, which is created from individuals with alcoholic liver disease and hepatitis C, should be verified in china, where the majority of the patients is infected with hepatitis B virus.",

Prevent constipation and ensure the daily urine volume is essential to reduce the absorption of ammonia, urea and other metabolic poisons. Nutritional support is the most important but the most likely to be overlooked clinical issues. It is easy to be neglected in clinical practice that abnormal nutrition and metabolism (including sugar, lipids, and proteins) can even occur in patients with compensated liver function. Meanwhile, it is a major complication of the end-stage liver disease and is a significant risk factor affecting the short-term prognosis and long-term survival of the patients, especially in patients with severe hepatitis B. Many factors can lead to malnutrition in patients with severe hepatitis B. The patients usually have decreased appetite, nausea and abdominal distension, which result in the lack of dietary intake and poor digestion, at the same time, the complications such as infection or bleeding will increase the energy requirement. In particular, the hepatic and extra-hepatic abnormal metabolism in patients with severe hepatitis B will further aggravate the nutrition deficiency. Malnutrition is common in patients with severe hepatitis B, which can severely weaken the reserve and regenerative capacity of the liver, and is an independent risk factor for poor prognosis.

According to the pathological features and progressing rate of diseases, SH can be classified into four categories: acute liver failure (ALF), subacute liver failure (SALF), acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) and chronic liver failure (CLF) [39] . Despite the traditional therapy based on supportive care, the majority of patients with SH still have a very poor prognosis if liver transplantation isn't available [40] . Nowadays, orthotopic liver transplantation has been considered to be the most effective method. However, liver transplantation hardly becomes the routine treatment due to the shortage of donor, exorbitant price and long-term immunosuppressive therapy. In addition, the long-term survival rate is still unsatisfactory although liver transplantation has significantly improved the short-term survival rate [41] . Over the past decades, immunotherapy and cellular therapy has attracted more and more attention, which provides an alternative strategy for the treatment of SH. Here, we review available data regarding the application of immunotherapy and cellular therapy, and discuss the prospectives and hurdles of novel strategies in the treatment of SH. In this chapter, we will focus on the clinical application of immunotherapy and cellular therapy in the treatment of acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B (AECHB), considering that hepatitis B (HBV) infection is one of the most common causes of SH and the majority of SH patients manifest AECHB [37, 39] . As described in previous chapters, acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B (AECHB) is characterized by the imbalanced cytokine profile, uncontrolled activation of immune cells and progressive loss of viable hepatocyte. Therefore, some strategies which have already been demonstrated to be effective in ALF, SALF and advanced liver cirrhosis may also be suitable for AECHB although this conclusion remains to be validated in the future clinical practice.",

In vitro and in vivo studies also found that HGF exerted protective and anti-apoptotic functions through preventing Fas-triggered death of hepatocytes [46, 47] . A recent study demonstrated that HGF ameliorated the immune-mediated damage during viral hepatitis by modulating DCs activation and T cell priming, but viral clearance wasn't compromised [48] . In addition, HGF induced the retention of ductal structures, avoided ductal proliferation and damage, and modulated the hepatic inflammatory response through down-regulating the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which may reduce the extent of liver fibrosis after SH [49] . Ido and his colleagues reported that repeated intravenous administration of rh-HGF at a dose of 0.6 mg/m 2 was well tolerated in SH patients [50] . The efficacy and safety of rh-HGF at an increased dose needs to be further investigated. Some potential adverse effects of rh-HGF should be carefully considered.

In an animal model of acute liver damage, PGE1 markedly improved survival rate after massive hepatectomy in rats by enhancing heat shock protein and alleviating endoplasmic reticulum stress [53] . Co-administration of PGE1 and somatostatin obviously attenuated liver damage of rats, which down-regulated the production of inflammatory factor TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 and inhibited hepatocyte apoptosis via down-regulation of Bax and caspase-3 and up-regulation of Bcl-2 [55] . In a randomized control trial, combined therapy of lipo-PGE1 and glucagon-insulin alleviated liver damage, which was indicated by the trends of relatively lower alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels [54] .

Li et al. constructed HSS encapsulated by sterically stable liposomes, which showed a longer half-life and markedly improved the therapeutic effect on FHF in rats [58] . Another study from China used a naked plasmid encoding human HSS, they found it effectively protected the mice liver against failure via suppressing the mitochondrial permeability transition [59] .

According to previous researches, glucocorticoids may protect liver tissue against further damage through the following mechanism [70] : (1) [70] . However, the usage of glucocorticoids in patients with SH is still controversial. Some studies suggested that the immune function in end-stage SH was suppressed and even paralyzed [72] . If steroid therapy is applied to patients with immunosuppressive status, the effects are contrary or even disastrous. Mathurin et al. proposed the three patterns of steroid responses based on Lille score which was defined by age, albumin and bilirubin, etc. [71] . The survival influence of steroid therapy was significant on complete or partial responders (Lille score <0.45) but was negligible on null responders (Lille score \u22650.45). Some clinicians had reported that the immunosuppressive therapy could activate HBV infections, eventually resulting in liver failure in patients with current or past HBV infections [73, 74] . Regarding these facts, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had warned on HBV reactivation with immunosuppressive drugs [75] . Hence, it must be prudent to use glucocorticoids in patients with SH. Agreement has yet to be reached with regard to the dose and duration of steroids therapy. In a Japanese study, the introduction of high-dose steroids was shown to reverse deterioration in patients with earlystage severe exacerbation of chronic hepatitis [76] . The adoptive doses of prednisolone were 60 mg/day or more for a minimum of 4 days, and then were reduced to 30 mg by 10 mg every 4 days when prothrombin time was remitted in trends, and were finally tapered off by 2.5 or 5 mg/week. Collectively, glucocorticoids are like a double-edged sword, which only produce positive effects when they are used appropriately.",

T\u03b11 has been widely applied to clinical practice as an immune enhancer including viral and bacterial infectious diseases, immune deficiency disease, cancer, and immune adjuvant for vaccines. T\u03b11 can involve innate immunity through interacting with Toll-like receptors (TLRs), especially with TLR9 and TLR2 on DCs and precursor T cells, and activating the p38MAPK, NF-\u03baB and MyD88-dependent signaling pathway [77] . T\u03b11 has already been shown to increase the function of regulatory T cells through activating the tryptophan catabolism pathway, which inhibits the excess production of cytokine and prevents the potential pro-inflammatory cytokine storms [78] . Besides, T\u03b11 exerts its immune-modulating functions on subpopulations of T cells through enhancing the effects of NK cells, Cytotoxic T cells and T helper cells with the increased secretion of cytokines such as IL-6, IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1 [77, 79, 80] . Zhang et al. compared lamivudine monotherapy with lamivudine and T\u03b11 combination therapy among HBeAg-positive patients from eight controlled Trials, and they found the latter had higher virological response rate and ALT normalization rate [81] . Based on these evidences, T\u03b11 has been recommended as adjuvant treatment for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines [82] . However, a recent multicenter, randomized study found that a short-term duration of T\u03b11 treatment combined with peg-interferon \u03b1-2a wasn't superior to only peg-interferon \u03b1-2a in CHB patients, suggesting that 3 months might be insufficient to enhance the efficacy of peg-interferon-based antiviral therapy [83] . At present, the data about T\u03b11 in SH are still small, and the optimal dose and treatment timing need to be explored in future clinical trials.",

It has been demonstrated that the levels of TNF-\u03b1 in serum and liver tissue were significantly elevated in SH patients [85, 86] . TNF-\u03b1 monoclonal antibodies, infliximab and adalimumab, have been shown to be clinically effective in various TNF-\u03b1-related diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease [87] [88] [89] . Sharma et al. evaluated infliximab therapy in 19 patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis, and found that single-dose infliximab (5 mg/kg body weight, a single 2 h infusion) significantly improved the parameters of severity and 2-months survival [90] . However, three patients had pneumonia and two developed into a flare of pulmonary tuberculosis. Another study showed that the incidence rates of seriously infectious events were higher in etanercept (another TNF-\u03b1 monoclonal antibody) group with a higher 6-month mortality rate [91] . These studies remind us that it is clearly not the case what we imagine must be the same as realistic effect. Malik compared infection and inflammation to two sides of the same coin in liver failure [92] . Future studies should be performed to explore which patients are likely at high risk of subsequent infections and suitably targeted for intensive surveillance and treatment. Immunoglobulin new antigen receptors are a subset of antibodies comprising five constant domains and a single variable domain (vNAR). VNAR domains are regarded as recognition units and attractive candidates for antibody-based therapy. In an animal model of endotoxic shock, anti-TNF vNAR single domains obviously improved the survival of murine through regulating the TNF/IL-10 balance and attenuating IL-6 gene expression [93] . Xu et al. demonstrated that soluble TNF receptor: IgG-Fc (sTNFR:IgG-Fc) prevented the development of ALF or ACLF by blocking the TNF/TNFRp55 pathway and reducing hepatocytes apoptosis [94] . These studies may provide new concepts for TNF-\u03b1 blockage in future treatment of SH.",

TLR4 is a transmembrane protein mainly expressed in macrophages such as Kupffer cells, which plays an important role in activating macrophage and mediating pro-inflammatory cytokine release [107] . In an animal model of endotoxin-induced acute liver injure, E5564, a TLR4 antagonist, could mitigate the liver damage through blocking TNF-\u03b1 overproduction from macrophage [108] . Ma et al. found that sesamin could prevent LPS-induced FHF in mice by suppressing the expression of TLR4 [108] . TLR9 predominantly recognizes viral DNA and synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs). The Function of TLR9 is controversial. TLR9 activation could aggravate liver injury by promoting the activation of CD4+ NKT cells [109] . However, it was recently shown that DCs secreting IL-10 may alleviate liver ischemia-reperfusion injury via TLR9 [110] . Besides, signaling through TLR2 and TLR3 has also been demonstrated to contribute to liver failure, especially in the early phase [111] .

It has been documented that the activation of NK/NKT cells involves in the progression of SH in acetaminophen and concanavalin-A (ConA) ALF models [112, 113] . For one thing, NK/NKT cells can directly induce the apoptosis of hepatocytes via perforin/granzyme or Fas/FasL pathways [114] . For another thing, activated NK/NKT cells can release large amounts of inflammatory mediators, such as IL-5, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4, which indirectly participate in liver damage through inducing hepatocyte apoptosis, up-regulating the expression of LSEC adhesion molecule and activating other immune effector cells [115] . The biological activity of NK/NKT cells is regulated by activator and inhibitor receptors on the cell surface. NKG2D is an activating or co-stimulatory receptor and its surface expression is increased in hepatitis B. Chen's study showed that the expression of NKG2D ligands in hepatocytes was markedly increased and (HBV) transgenic mice were more susceptible to liver injury induced by ConA [116] . These findings were further demonstrated by Vilarinho's research in which the blockade of NKG2D could inhibit HBV-mediated acute hepatitis and liver injury [117] . Blocking the activator receptors on NK/NKT cells surface may be efficacious strategies for therapeutic intervention given that the activation of NK/NKT cells has been implicated in SH.",

            "text": "Monocytes/macrophages are central cellular component to both SIRS and CARS. After the exposure to LPS or other microbial constituents, monocytes/macrophages are activated and produce large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines [115] . Monocytes/macrophages also possess the ability to digest, process and present antigen, which in turn trigger the adaptive immune responses. The serum endotoxin level is often elevated in patients with SH [118] . Following repeated exposure to endotoxin, monocyte function is impaired with the alterations in inflammatory cytokine secretion and HLA-DR surface expression [119] . KCs, liver-specific macrophages, reside in liver sinusoid and serve as gatekeepers. Some studies confirmed that the early devastating activation of KCs has been implicated in the pathogenetic mechanisms of SH [120] . Tsutsui elaborated the important roles of KCs in two models of liver failure [121] . KCs contributed to LPS-induced liver injury through secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines and LPS tolerance as described above. However, in ConA-induced ALF, KCs initiated pathogenic intrasinusoidal thrombosis in collaboration with LSEC. In a mouse model of ConA-induced ALF, the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by KCs was significantly inhibited through the blockade of intracellular HMGB1 expression [122] . Compared with wild-type mice, KCs depleted mice manifested attenuated liver damage and lung inflammation following acetaminophen-induced ALF [123] . One point must be noted: the roles of KCs are gradually altered in SH. Immunotherapy should be targeted at restraining the massive activation of monocytes/macrophages at the initiation phase of SH, but it is also crucial for the later resolution of macrophage paralysis in CARS phase.",

            "text": "During the early stage of HBV-related SH, massive HBV-specific CD8+ T cells are activated and may directly eliminate HBV-infected hepatocytes, resulting in liver damage [124] . Therefore, limiting effector function of HBV-specific T cell may ultimately alleviate liver damage and prevent the occurrence and development of liver failure. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is a key negative regulator, which is recruited to T cell membrane upon activation of the TCR receptor where it binds to accessory molecules B7 expressed by the antigen presenting cells (APC) [125] . CTLA-4 ligation effectively prevents further activation and expansion, thereby negatively regulating T cell function. Metushi et al. found that amodiaquine and anti-CTLA-4 resulted in a greater increase in ALT level than treatment with amodiaquine alone in PD-1 (\u2212/\u2212) mice, which was similar to idiosyncratic liver injury [126] . A recent study demonstrated that replication-defective adenovirus expressing CTLA-4Ig could induce immune tolerance and prolong islet allograft survival [127] . In Uchida's research, they found that CTLA-4 mediated ALF through the damage of HBV-infected hepatocytes, which could be rescued by CTLA-4 immunoglobulin (CTLA-4Ig) [128] . Abatacept, as a CTLA4-Ig, has been recommended for the treatment of refractory rheumatoid arthritis [100] , which may be used for the treatment of SH in the short run. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is another T cell receptor and exerts similar biological activity to CTLA-4 [129] . PD-1 is mainly expressed on the surface of activated T cells, rendering CD8+ T cells unresponsive or exhausted. Related research has shown that decreased PD-1 expression on HBV-specific CD8+ T cells was significantly associated with ACLF [130] . They thought that the low PD-1 expression might reverse PD-1-mediated restraint of CD8+ T cell responses. In addition, Ji et al. also found that stimulating PD-1/B7 signals with anti-B7-H1 mAb could protect mice liver tissue from ischemiareperfusion injury through inhibiting T cell activation and KCs function [131] . CD28 has been identified as an important T cell receptor for co-stimulatory ligands, such as CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2). Previous study found that the expression of ligands CD80, CD86 and CD28 in liver tissue was enhanced in patients FLF, suggesting that abnormal expression of CD28/B7 might participate in the immunemediated pathogenesis through excessive antigen presentation in FLF [132] . It has been proved that anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies induced donor-specific tolerance to allografts and prong graft survival in rat liver transplantation model through blocking co-stimulatory signals [133] . Although the related study is scarce in SH, blocking co-stimulatory signals CD28/B7 may provide an alternative method for T cell immune modulation.",

            "text": "Conceptually, primary adult human hepatocytes are ideal sources of cellular therapy. Hepatocyte transplantation (HT) is less invasive than orthotopic liver transplantation and multiple patients with liver failure can benefit from one donor liver [134] . What's more, hepatocytes can be cryopreserved for a long term, while donor livers must be immediately used in liver transplantation. It has been demonstrated that this procedure was basically safe for patients who undergo HT in adult and children [135, 136] . During the past 30 years, extensive studies have investigated the efficacy of hepatocyte transplantation in patients with liver failure or some metabolic liver disease [136] [137] [138] [139] [140] . Intraportal or intrahepatic injection is generally preferred as the method delivering hepatocytes. However, intraportal administration was reported to augment the risks of portal vein thrombosis [141] . Another concern is that intraportal injection may enhance portal venous pressure given that many patients with liver failure, especially end-stage liver cirrhosis, have distorted liver architecture and portal hypertension. In a 5-year follow-up study, MRI (Gd-BOPTA) scanning showed the existence of living hepatocytes signals in spleen even after 48 months, and histopathological analysis further demonstrated the small clusters of the surviving hepatocytes in the 2nd year, suggesting that intrasplenic infusion is feasible and effective [136] . The peritoneal cavity was also proposed as transplanting sites. However, transplanted hepatocytes normally do not survive long in the peritoneal cavity environment owing to the lack of anchorage [142] . Yokoyama et al. established a vascularized subcutaneous space with a polyethylene terephthalate mesh device coated with poly(vinyl alcohol), which effectively prolonged the survival of hepatocyte [143] . This founding provides novel insights into the procedures of hepatocyte administration. Agreement has yet to be reached with regard to the optimal doses and repeated times. In two successful reports, the used number of hepatocytes was 4.2-6.0 \u00d7 10 10 and 0.88 \u00d7 10 9 per patient, respectively [136, 139] . The huge difference implied that available hepatocyte quantity in different studies limited the standardization of treatment protocols. Hepatocyte transplantation significantly improved laboratory parameters and prognostic scores in patients with liver failure, such as decreased ammonia, alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin levels, increased albumin levels, normalized prothrombin time and improved MELD scores [136, 138, 140] . Notable symptomatic improvement was only observed in a small portion of patients, and survival benefit was unsatisfactory although some patients receiving hepatocyte transplantation survived for a few years. The majority of studies regarding hepatocyte transplantation are case-reports, and the lack of control group in these clinical trials makes it difficult to assess the survival benefit. Therefore, hepatocyte transplantation is primarily applied to patients who reject liver transplantation or await liver transplantation in an effort to fight for a longer survival time before transplantation. Similar to liver transplantation, immunosuppressive drugs are required since immune-mediated rejection can lead to allograft cell loss [144] . Unfavorably, there is still no standard regimen for immunosuppressive treatment after hepatocyte transplantation. It appears difficult to effectively expand hepatocytes in vitro although hepatocytes have already been proved to possess a high proliferative ability in vivo [145] . Moreover, the isolation and cryopreservation of hepatocytes is technically demanding. In reality, this procedure is also hampered by the shortage of honor organs and hepatocyte viability because hepatocytes are generally obtained from honor organs that are not deemed unsuitable for liver transplant. Recent researches mainly focused on efforts to seek a sustainable or available source of cells.",

In a previous clinical study, autologous HSCs therapy caused the 2.5-fold increase of the mean proliferation rates in remnant segments after portal vein embolization compared with the control group, indicating that HSCs played a key role in liver regeneration [150] . HSCs also have a potent anti-fibrotic effect, which was proved by liver biopsy analysis in Burganova's study [151] . In a study conducted by Salama and his colleagues, 48 patients with SH underwent HSCs infusions via hepatic artery or portal vein [152] . Significant decrease in ascites and marked changes in albumin, bilirubin, INR, and ALT levels was observed in the majority of patients compared with pre-transplantation. The transplantation procedure caused serious treatment-related complications in three patients-hematemesis, hemoperitoneum and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, respectively. In another randomized controlled study, the HSCs transplanted group showed significant improvements in hepatic function, Child-Pugh score and the quality of life in comparison with the regular treatment group [153] . The 6-month mortality rate in the control group was up to 52%-15 patients from haematemesis, 6 from hepatic coma and 5 from hepatorenal syndrome. However, the 6-month mortality rate in transplanted group was only 10%; 7 died from hematemesis, and 2 died from hepatorenal syndrome. The life span of injected cells and occurrence rate of long-term complications remains to be explored in future studies. In addition, HSCs may be not the optimal candidate for stem therapy given that only a small proportion of HSCs can finally differentiate into hepatocytes.",

MSCs can engraft preferentially to the injured or inflammation sites in vivo, which may make peripheral vein administration feasible [156] . Another unique feature of MSCs is little or low immunogenicity due to the lack of expression of co-stimulatory molecules [155] . This phenomenon makes it possible to administer allogeneic MSCs without HLA matching for cell therapy. With the ease of harvest, culture and genetical modification, MSCs represent a promising therapeutic option to treat liver failure. Among these, bone marrow-derived MSCs are most fully characterized and considered as gold standard for MSCs clinical applications due to first discovery and extensive study. It has been reported that the majority of patients with chronic decompensated liver cirrhosis could benefit from MSCs therapy at least short-term. In a study performed by Jang et al., 11 patients received autologous BM-MSCs therapy, and 5 \u00d7 10 7 cells were injected twice at a 1-week interval through the hepatic artery [157] . Histological analysis revealed that the Laennec fibrosis scoring and Metavir fibrosis scoring was improved in 6 of the 11 patients, and the expressions of TGF-b1, collagen-1 and a-SMA in liver tissues were significantly decreased compared with pretransplantation, implying the anti-fibrotic effect of MSCs therapy. In a recent clinical trial, BM-MSCs therapy was demonstrated to improve liver function through regulating the balance of Treg/Th17 cells in patients with HBV-associated liver cirrhosis [158] . Peng et al. respectively evaluated the short-term and long-term efficacy of a single BM-MSCs infusion in patients with HBV-associated liver failure [159] . Short-term benefit was favorable, and albumin, bilirubin, PT levels and MELD scores were significantly improved in the transplanted group after 2-3 weeks. However, there were no dramatic differences in long-term outcomes. This study may also explain the different results from two trials. Salama et al. assessed the efficacy of autologous BM-MSCs infusion via peripheral vein in a randomized trial [160] . The transplanted group showed significant improvements in albumin, bilirubin, INR and ALT levels within 3 months compared the regular supportive treatment group. In contrast, MSC transplantation via peripheral vein could not bring benefit to cirrhotic patients at 3 and 12 month follow-up in Mohamadnejad's study [161] .",

Several studies indicated that UC-MSCs are similar to BM-MSCs with respect to cell morphology and biology properties but more primitive, proliferative and immunosuppressive [154] . In a clinical study conducted by Wang et al., UC-MSCs were intravenously injected at a concentration of 0.5 \u00d7 10 6 /kg body weight into patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis [162] . UC-MSCs infusions markedly improved liver function and reduced ascites. In the further research, Wang et al. demonstrated that UC-MSCs therapy not only improved liver function but also enhanced the survival rates in patients with acute-on-chronic liver Failure [163] .

Which types of patients are suitable for this therapy? Which types of patients should be forbidden for MSCs therapy? How can MSCs therapy achieve the desired effects when combined with other strategies? Animal experiments demonstrated that MSCs could reverse acute liver failure through secreting some molecules and regulating immune cells in addition to promoting liver regeneration [164] . Whether the patients with acute liver failure can benefit from MSCs therapy needs to be confirmed. Whether MSCs is required to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells before the infusion is also controversial. For one thing, differentiated MSCs may lost several major properties such as immunosuppression and secreting hepatocyte growth factor [165] . For another thing, pure differentiation into hepatocytes from MSCs seems to be difficult in vivo [166] . In a phase II clinical trial, both differentiated group and undifferentiated group showed no significant difference regarding liver functions, prognostic scores and hepatogenesis by immunohistochemical analysis in patients with liver cirrhosis [167] . It was perplexing, and the results may be attributed to the release of cytokines and breakdown of scar tissue caused by undifferentiated MSCs, thereby increasing the intrinsic proliferative ability of hepatocytes. Besides, some reports indicated that MSCs possessed profibrogenic properties and might spontaneous transform into tumor during the long-term cell culture, which makes the long-term safety of MSCs therapy become uncertain [166, 168] . We believe that these questions will be well addressed in future studies.",

It is well established that ESCs can differentiate into nearly all types of cells and tissues under certain conditions, including hepatocyte-like cells. Therefore, they may have therapeutic value in liver regeneration. However, some critical questions remain to be addressed before ESCs can be translated into clinical applications. First, transplantation of ESCs-derived cells may give rise to teratoma, so additional strategies are required to purify the desired cell population but eliminate tumorigenic cells. For instance, Kahan et al. isolated a population of endodermal cells with EpCAM(+) SSEA1(\u2212) SSEA3(\u2212) markers by magnetic bead sorting, and the transplantation of sorted cells into immunodeficient mice could not generate teratoma [170] . It has been reported that ESCs-derived hepatocyte-like cells (ESCs-Heps) had similar karyotype, morphology and metabolic function to primary hepatocytes. In vivo experiment also suggested that ESCs-Heps repopulated into liver tissues and corrected metabolic liver disease after transplantation [171] . Hepatic stellate cells promoted the generation of HPCs from ESCs-derived definitive endodermal cells through creating an appropriate microenvironment [172] . In addition, it has also been demonstrated that ESCs-Heps could contribute to liver regeneration through both cell replacement and trophic factors secretion in vivo [173] . Thus it seems possible that differentiated ESCs progeny integrate into the liver tissue and function normally and effectively as primary hepatocytes. The immunological incompatibility can result in graft rejection and the failure of ESCs therapy. Apart from conventional immunosuppressive drugs, some studies also attempted to knock out major histocompatibility complex or other responsible gene though genetic engineering technology so as to minimize immune rejection [174] . Moreover, the usage of human ESCs has raised some ethical issues because these cells are obtained from an embryo. The results from a clinical trial recently published in Lancet were exciting [175] . Nine patients with Stargardt's macular dystrophy and nine with atrophic age-related macular degeneration respectively received the therapy of human ESCs-derived retinal pigment epithelium transplantation. During the long term follow-up, no adverse proliferation, graft rejection, or severe transplantation-related diseases occurred, and visual acuity and quality-of-life was improved in the majority of patients undergoing ESCs progeny transplantation. On the basis of previous studies, ESCs therapy in liver generation may be feasible and justified although it is too early to draw a conclusion.",

These reprogrammed somatic cells resemble ESCs in morphology, telomerase activity, cell surface markers and gene expression and have the ability to generate all cells of three germ layers in vitro. The advent of iPSCs solves the dilemma of ethical controversy caused by ESCs and expands the sources of these pluripotent cells. On the other hand, iPSCs can be produced by autologous somatic cells, which theoretically allays some fears about immune rejection. Thus iPSCs hold great promise for regenerative medicine, including the treatment of liver failure.",

            "text": "To implement clinical applications, some obstacles surrounding genetic instability and pluripotent status of iPSCs remain to be overcome. Similar to ESCs, the usage of iPSCs is limited by the risk of teratoma formation. Importantly, iPSCs display many characteristic of cancer cells including unlimited proliferative properties, self-renewal activities and even bioenergetic metabolism [179] . These phenomena imply that overlapping mechanisms or similar pathways may be involved in both oncogenesis and pluripotent cells production. The inductive process of iPSCs also increases our worries about the tumorigenicity; iPSCs may themselves be a consequence of genetic anomalies and aberrant epigenetic changes induced by reprogramming [180, 181] . Therefore, it is crucial to control the biological behavior of iPSCs and their progeny and minimize the risks of tumorigenesis in vivo. One safeguarding strategy is the selective ablation of undesired cells through suicide gene modifications, monoclonal antibodies, drugs or flow cytometry sorting [170, 182] . In other studies, small molecules are utilized to generate iPSCs instead of the import of exogenous genes, avoiding the risks of tumorigenesis along with gene transfer [183, 184] . Maybe the major challenge facing iPSCs application is whether iPSCs-derived hepatocyte-like cells (iPSCs-Heps) can perfectly perform the duties of primary hepatocytes in vivo. There were some specific differences in the expression of cytochrome P450 gene even though iPSC-Heps were compared with that from ESCs [185] . A recent study showed that human iPSC-Heps and ESCs-Heps were parallel to fetal rather than adult hepatocytes in functions and phenotype [186] . Yanagida et al. also found that iPSC-Heps exhibited a bi-potent capability to differentiate into Heps or cholangiocytic cyst-like structure in vitro culture system, which is extremely alike the features of HPCs [187] . These studies indicated that iPSCs-Heps were immature and had limited functional characteristics compared to adult primary hepatocytes.",

Interestingly, xenogeneic hepatocytes appear insusceptible to the infections from human hepatitis viruses [195] . The largest concern about xenogeneic hepatocytes is hyperacute and delayed xenograft rejection, thereby resulting in the failure of xenotransplant and deterioration of diseases [196] . Whether xenogeneic hepatocytes function effectively in human body environment still remains uncertain. Additionally, the origin of HIV and mad cow disease virus reminds us that potential risks transmitting unknown infectious agents from xenogeneic organ are unavoidable. In an early clinical trial, Starzl et al. undertook a liver transplantation surgery from a baboon to a 35-year-old man with HBV and HIV co-infection [197] . The patient died of lethal infectious complications, and biochemical monitoring and histopathological examination showed little evidence of hepatic rejection. At present, pigs are regarded as the preferred species for xenotransplantation due to the similarity of volume and function to human organ. In a mice model of acute liver failure, Ham et al. encapsulated and re-aggregated pig hepatocytes, which showed higher viability and greater synthesis of albumin and urea and significantly improved the survival rate of mice after intraperitoneal transplantation. Surprisingly, porcine hepatocytes stayed viable for more than 80 days after a single intrasplenic transplantation and even for more than 253 days following repeated transplantation in nonhuman primates when combined with immunosuppression to control rejection [198] . More importantly, porcine hepatocytes functioned normally and secreted albumin. Several researches utilized genetic engineering technique in an attempt to improve the survival of pig hepatocytes and overcome immune rejection in nonhuman primates, such as genetic modification with human complement regulatory protein (CRP) CD55 or \u03b1 1,3-galacto-syltransferase gene-knockout combined with transgene for the CRP CD46 [199] . In a latest study published in Science, Yang et al. successfully eradicated all porcine endogenous retroviruses with a >1000-fold reduction in a porcine cell line and avoided the transmission to human cells using CRISPR-Cas9 [200] . Hence, xenotransplant of hepatocytes may be rational as we better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying graft rejection and the safety of xenotransplant is well addressed.",

In addition to hepatocytes, HPCs and other stem cells are abundant in fetal liver tissues [201] , which will be detailed in the following text. Fetal hepatocytes of 20-22 gestational ages have been functionally competent and comparable to adult hepatocyte in terms of many liver-specific functions, but they don't divide in vitro [202] . On the contrary, hepatocytes of earlier gestational ages resemble hepatic precursors with high proliferative activity but low liver-specific functions. Hence, fetal hepatocytes of 20-22 gestational ages should be recommendable for cellular therapy. In a matched case-control study in patients with end-stage liver disease, intrasplenic fetal hepatocyte infusion at the doses of 5 or 10 \u00d7 10 8 was well-tolerated and markedly improved the model for end-stage liver disease and Child-Pugh scores, but no obvious survival benefit was observed (treatment failure in 6/9 patients compared with 14/16 patients in control group) [203] . A study with an increased hepatocyte amount and a larger scale may finally prove the clinical efficacy of fetal hepatocyte transplantation. Some obstacles remain to be overcome. Kamimura et al. evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of hepatocyte-transplantation from various differentiation stages in a mice model of lethal liver damage and found that adult hepatocytetransplanted group (8/20, 40%) showed higher improvement of survival rate in comparison to fetal hepatocyte-transplanted group at 35 days after transplantation [204] . Fetal hepatocytes are generally regarded as immature hepatocytes. The amounts of most metabolites in glycolysis/glyconeogenesis pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle and urea cycle are significantly lower in fetal hepatocytes, suggesting discriminative metabolic functions between fetal and adult hepatocytes [205] . Fetal hepatocytes are usually acquired from elective abortions, so their usage is limited by ethical issues. Furthermore, similar to adult hepatocyte transplantation, available fetal tissue is not infinite owing to low numbers of donors and small-size liver in fetal.",

This approach requires lengthy culturing process and thus is of high cost. Direct conversion from other somatic cells into Heps can not only save time and materials but also bypass the pluripotent stage and lessen the risks of teratoma formation. Over the past 5 years, some studies have successfully reported the generation of Heps from other somatic cells. Huang et al. first found that mouse fibroblasts could be induced into functional Heps by introducing Gata4, Hnf1a and Foxa3 and knocking out p19Arf [215] . Of note, induced Heps could repopulate into liver tissues, restore liver functions and rescue almost half of death in fumarylacetoacetate-hydrolase-deficient mice. Similar findings were also referred to in a study from Japan [216] . Hnf4a plus Foxa1, Foxa2 or Foxa3 could convert mouse embryonic and adult fibroblasts into Heps in vitro. In vivo experiment further suggested that induced Heps had the ability to reconstitute liver tissues. In another study, Bing Yu et al. demonstrated that Foxa3 and liver organogenesis transcription factors are sufficient to convert mouse embryonic fibroblasts into HPCs. Recently, Kamen P. Simeonov and Hirdesh Uppal showed that human Heps was achieved through repeatedly transfecting human fibroblasts with synthetic modified mRNAs coding Hnf1a plus any two of Foxa1, Foxa3, or Hnf4a [217] . The human induced \"Heps\" had similar morphology and albumin expression with mature hepatocytes, but their functions remain to be further confirmed in vivo. The majority of current studies about direct conversions are from mouse because direct reprogramming of human somatic cells is actually more difficult than mouse cells. Once this technical handicap is conquered, directly induced \"Heps\" may provide an ideal and promising source for cellular therapy.",

Some clinicians might choose to continue therapy, and, in that case, tenofovir is often considered the long-term therapy of choice throughout pregnancy. Women presenting in the second or third trimester of pregnancy who have been taking antiviral therapy risk the possibility of rebound viral hepatitis with drug discontinuation as well as an increased risk of MTCT with high HBV DNA levels. Thus, expert opinion would favour continuation of antiviral therapy in this scenario. However, most women of childbearing age will be in the immune-tolerant phase or have early disease, in which case antiviral therapy will be deferred, except in women with high HBV viraemia, for whom initiation of antiviral therapy might be advised in the third trimester for purposes of reducing risk of MTCT. EASL recommends that in all pregnant women with high HBV DNA levels (>200,000 IU/mL) or HBsAg levels >4 log 10 IU/mL, antiviral prophylaxis with tenofovir should start at week 24-28 of gestation and continue for up to 12 weeks after delivery.

Inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and nitric oxide, have been shown to impair the metabolic action of insulin in the liver, which results in hepatic dysfunction and, in turn, leads to insulin resistance.

            "text": "The key to prevention of HBV reactivation is the identification of patients with HBV infection prior to initiation of immunosuppressive therapy. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, European Association for the Study of the Liver, and Asian-Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver recommended universal HBV screening prior to initiation of immunosuppressive therapy. Antiviral therapy is started prior to or at the same time as the initiation of immunosuppressive therapy and before any elevations in ALT or HBV DNA levels-and pre-emptive therapy, in which antiviral therapy is initiated when serum HBV DNA or ALT levels are elevated but before symptomatic manifestation of hepatitis or liver failure. Prophylactic antiviral therapy has been demonstrated to be effective in prevention of HBV reactivation and its sequelae. Entecavir is better than tenofovir because of the lack of nephrotoxicity. Lamivudine could be used in patients with undetectable serum HBV DNA before the start of immunosuppressive therapy and if the anticipated duration of use is short (for example, <12 months) to avoid resistance. Continuing preventative antiviral therapy is recommended for at least 6 months after the completion of immunosuppressive therapy and even longer for those who receive rituximab who had high serum HBV DNA levels before the start of immunosuppressive therapy. It is not necessary to delay the start of immunosuppressive therapy except in patients with high baseline serum HBV DNA levels (for example, >4 log 10 IU/mL); for these patients, the benefit of delaying immunosuppressive therapy until HBV DNA level is suppressed must be weighed against the risk of progression of the underlying medical condition.",

However, with more recent very potent immunosuppressive agents like rituximab, ofatumumab, and alemtuzumab, severe (sometimes fatal) reactivation has been reported in patients with occult hepatitis B, that is, patients who are negative for HBsAg pretreatment but positive for other HBV markers, anti-HBc with or without anti-HBs. Studies showed that after elevation of ALT or HBV DNA levels has occurred, antiviral therapy is less effective in preventing progression to liver failure. Clinical signs of poor prognosis include jaundice, encephalopathy, ascites, elevated bilirubin levels or prolonged prothrombin time. A liver transplantation centre should be considered for all patients with clinical signs of liver failure, but the benefits of liver transplantation must be weighed against the prognosis of the underlying cancer or other medical condition for which immunosuppressive therapy was prescribed.",

            "text": "Liver failure is a state of severe liver dysfunction that can lead to coagulation disorders, jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy and ascites [218] . In China, the main aetiology of liver failure is acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B infection. The deterioration of liver functions including biotransformation, excretion, and secretion, leads to increased levels of various toxicants, such as ammonia, bile acids, mediators of oxidative stress, nitric oxide, and lactates, which in turn results in multiple organ failure. Liver failure is the leading cause of mortality among adults worldwide and has a considerable economic burden and social impact. Currently, only orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) can reverse liver failure. Although OLT is an effective surgery to save patients with liver failure, whole-organ transplantation is hindered by the shortage of suitable donor organs. Liver support systems can prevent or reverse secondary organ failure and promote restoration of hepatic function until an appropriate liver is available for transplantation, or stimulate hepatocyte regeneration and let liver recover from injury. Dialysis was initially developed to keep patients with acute renal failure alive until kidney transplantation. This function was incorporated into the design of the first extracorporeal liver support devices. Because of the capacity of healthy liver tissue to regenerate, early liver support devices provided short-term support to enable liver regeneration. In the 1950s, artificial kidneys were used for the first time to treat liver coma. Because of the liver's complex functions, including metabolism, synthesis, and detoxification, early approaches focused on detoxification and regulation using a cell-based platform. Those early devices included cross circulation with both human and primates. Non-cell-based devices were also investigated during this period.",

Since 1986, Li Lanjuan's team at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University has used their non-biological artificial liver (NBAL) (Li-NBAL 1.0; also known as the artificial liver support system [ALSS]) to detoxify patients with severe hepatitis, and maintain them until their liver has regenerated sufficiently or a donor liver is available. Plasma exchange (PE), plasma perfusion (PP), haemofiltration (HF), and haemodialysis have been systematically applied to treat patients with liver failure, alone or in combination. In 1997, a study assessed the efficacy of ALSSs. Beginning in the late-1990s, NBALs were used in an increasing number of Chinese hospitals. By 2001, more than 50 hospitals in China offered NBAL treatment. In 2002, the Artificial Liver and Liver Failure Group of the Chinese Society of Infection built guidelines for artificial liver treatment [219] . According to the pathophysiological characteristics of liver failure, Li Lanjuan's team has developed a new NBAL device, the Li-NBAL 2.0 (also known as Li-ALS), which combines PE, plasma adsorption, and filtration. In animal studies, the Li-NBAL 2.0 prolonged survival compared with PE or plasma adsorption and filtration individually [220] . A clinical trial of the Li-NBAL 2.0 is imminent.",

The control group also comprised 400 severe viral hepatitis patients, who were treated at the same hospital from 1986 to 1994. The artificial liver therapy was carried out two or three times in weeks 1 and 2, and then once a week until the patient's condition stabilised. Almost 90% of the patients have improved symptoms after each treatment. The liver function tests improved significantly in all patients after treatment. The serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), the serum total bilirubin (TBIL), and total bile acid (TBA) levels declined significantly (P < 0.001), and the prothrombin time decreased sharply.

However, Livigni et al. [224] conducted a multicentre, randomised, unblinded trial to compare the therapeutic effects of CPFA and standard care on critically ill patients with septic shock. CPFA did not reduce the mortality in patients with septic shock and did not affect other important clinical outcomes. However, the subgroup analysis showed that CPFA can reduce the mortality rate after large volume plasma treatment. Maggi et al. [225] reported that following liver transplantation, one patient developed early allograft dysfunction, and another hyperbilirubinemia associated with chronic rejection. After three cycles of CPFA, the bilirubin level rapidly declined in both cases. Each cycle of treatment reduced the bilirubin level by 40%. One round of PE requires 2000-2500 mL of fresh frozen plasma. However, the supply of fresh frozen plasma is limited. Bilirubin adsorption combined with HF can clear a certain proportion of toxins, but also affects blood coagulation in liver failure patients at high risk of bleeding. Li Lanjuan found that CPFA was effective for clearing inflammatory mediators in patients with liver failure, but did not correct coagulopathy. Thus, Li Lanjuan developed a new NBAL system that coupled lowvolume PE with plasma filtration adsorption, the Li-NBAL 2.0 [220] . After low-volume PE (500-1000 mL), plasma adsorption continues in parallel with plasma filtration. The technique can not only supply coagulation factors, but also removes small molecular substances and re-establishes the hydro-electrolyte acid-based equilibrium. Li Lanjuan's team used this system to treat liver failure patients. It improved the efficiency of artificial liver while plasma exchange successively combined with coupled plasma filtration adsorption. One round of treatment required 500-1000 mL of plasma, considerably less than for PE alone. The total bilirubin level was reduced by about 50%. Additionally, the treatment was well tolerated, and did not significantly influence blood cell count and coagulation function. Further studies should determine if the cure rate is increased with Li-NBAL 2.0 treatment compared with conventional PE. The Li-NBAL 2.0 treatment method and a pipeline connection diagram are shown in Fig. 4 .2.",

Kribben et al. published a preliminary report in 2012 [236] , in which acute-onchronic liver failure patients were randomly divided into an FPSA group (77 cases) and a standard medical therapy group (SMT group, 68 cases). The Prometheus group underwent 8-11 treatment sessions over 3 weeks with a minimum treatment time of 4 h. The 28-day survival rate of the FPSA group was 66%, compared to 63% in the SMT group (p = 0.70), while the 90-day survival rate in the FPSA group was 47%, compared to 38% in the SMT group (p = 0.35). There was no significant difference in the 28-and 90-day survival rates between the two groups, which was disappointing. However, a pre-defined subgroup analysis found that in patients with a model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) score > 30 (total of 48 cases, 24 per group), 28-day survival rates were 42% and 57% in the SMT group and FPSA group, and the 90-day survival rates were 9% and 48% in the SMT and FPSA groups, respectively (p = 0.02). Therefore, the Prometheus system improved [226] survival. Randomised crossover controlled trials of Prometheus and MARS indicated that clearance, and an ultimately reduced rate of albumin-bound and watersoluble products, was higher with the Prometheus system than with MARS treatment.",

A retrospective analysis of MARS and SPAD involving 163 albumin dialysis treatments (126 with MARS and 37 with SPAD, in a total of 57 patients) [238] showed that MARS caused a significant decrease in bilirubin, liver enzymes, creatinine, and urea levels, while SPAD caused a significant decrease in bilirubin and gamma-GT levels, and an increase in the lactate level.

During the operation, little to no heparin should be used in patients with obvious haemorrhage or a positive faecal occult blood test. Alternatively, in vitro heparinisation can be applied in these patients. If serious digestive tract bleeding occurs, the amount of bleeding should be accurately estimated.

Meanwhile, this treatment promotes the disappearance of jaundice, restoration and regeneration of the liver cells and excretion of metabolites like endotoxin, relieves all kinds of clinical symptoms and increase the survival rate by 10-15%.

The severe hepatitis is progressing rapidly, while its treatment with western medicine is therapeutically limited. By contrast, TCM treatment is widely recognized in clinical practices. The therapies of TCM injections, TCM colonic dialysis and acupuncture and moxibustion are comparatively effective, cheap and convenient.

The rapid thickening of jaundice is a significant indicator of the worsening of severe hepatitis, whereas hepatic encephalopathy, massive hemorrhage of the upper alimentary tract and cerebral edema are the major causes of death for patients afflicted with severe hepatitis. Therefore, hindrance of the thickening at early stage is the key to preventing the liver cells from necrosis. Therapeutic measures such as stopping bleeding, turning the tide of hepatic coma and eliminating cerebral edema aim to help the patients survive the critical stage and make more time for hepatic restoration and regeneration. Consequently, the key to the improvement of the therapeutic effect is to look for effective prescriptions directed at the main syndromes. The three treasures, namely, removing jaundice by clearing heat and relieving toxins on the basis of taking rhubarb and Herba Artemisiae Capillariae, dispelling the exogenous pathogens by purgation and taking the Cow-bezoar Bolus for Resurrection comply with the standard that the tip of the disease should be treated first when it's urgent.

Therefore, we should struggle to sum up the complicated principle of treatment based on syndrome differentiation and improve the efficacy of the simple recipes and proved recipes in TCM, and to lay solid foundation on the clinical research in order that the recovery rate and effective repetition rate will be enhanced. The new TCM prescriptions administrated by veins like Mind-Refreshment Injection and Compound Injection of Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae have witnessed satisfying effect in the treatment of severe hepatitis, therefore are innovations in TCM treatment means.
