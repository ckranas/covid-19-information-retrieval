Absence of functional CFTR at epithelial membranes leads to cystic fibrosis (CF). CFTR is regulated by protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation, and a cycle of ATP binding and hydrolysis. An unstructured intracellular segment of CFTR known as the R region contains 11 putative PKA phosphorylation sites, including dibasic and monobasic PKA consensus motifs. As it remains unclear which of the sites are modified by PKA phosphorylation in the fulllength protein, we investigate sites of PKA phosphorylation in purified CFTR, and quantify the relative change in phosphorylation at each site before and after treatment with PKA.",

Our aim is to provide such a high resolution structure for the protein. Structural biology of membrane proteins such as CFTR is extremely challenging. This is partly because of problems in the production of large amounts of such proteins, and partly because of difficulties in crystallisation. Electron microscopy of 2-D crystals offers an attractive route to the structure of CFTR because only low protein amounts are needed when compared to X-ray crystallography and NMR. Two-dimensional crystals are crystals many molecules wide and long, but are just a single molecule thick. Hence they are extremely fragile, and have to be supported on a rigid surface. Another major advantage of the electron microscopy approach is that structural data can be obtained with or without crystallisation of the protein. Even for crystallisation, only 100ng protein is required per crystallisation experiment. Two-dimensional crystals of CFTR are ordered sufficiently to provide data to a resolution of about 0.4nm where the polypeptide chain can be traced (Figure 1 ). Three-dimensional data has been collected by tilting the 2-D crystals in the electron beam. The estimated resolution of these data is currently to about 7\u00c5 with 100% completeness and to about 4\u00c5 resolution in some directions.",

Deletion of F508 (F508del), a residue within the first NBD (NBD1), is the most common cystic fibrosis causing mutation. F508del leads to reduced cell surface CFTR due to folding and stability defects and a reduction in individual channel activity. F508del causes minimal structural perturbation as demonstrated by comparing crystal structures of WT and mutant NBD1. Instead, the deleterious effects of the mutation are thought to be due to disruption of NBD1 surfaces required for interdomain interactions and/or a change in the kinetics or thermodynamics of NBD1 folding and interactions. We have used NMR to study human NBD1 in order to identify differences in the dynamics of the WT and F508del. Spectra of both WT and F508del hNBD1 with the regulatory insertion removed (deltaRI) exhibit spectral characteristics associated with highly dynamic proteins. The dynamics appear widespread with both the ATP-binding core and the alpha-helical subdomain undergoing motions in the \u00b5s-ms timescale range as evidenced by broadening and loss of intensity of NMR resonances from atoms in these regions. The broadening and loss of signal intensity are exacerbated by deletion of F508 with the largest changes occuring at the interface between the ATP-binding core and the alpha-helical subdomain. These results provide evidence that deletion of F508 leads to changes in NBD1 dynamics at sites that are distant from the site of mutation and thus may disrupt the kinetics and thermodynamics of NBD1 interactions even when the interfaces involved are distant from the site of mutation.

In order to establish if PKA treatment induces a change in phosphorylation levels at the ten sites, we designed a MRM method to quantify the abundance of the phosphopeptides containing each of the sites. At each site, there was a significant increase in phosphorylation. Of particular interest is the increase in phosphorylation at the poorly characterized monobasic PKA consensus sites S670 and S753. The increase in phosphorylation at these sites was measured as 26 and 500 fold increases in phosphorylation, respectively.

California Pacific Medical Center Res. Inst., San Francisco, CA, USA; 3. Lab. Med., UCSF, San Francisco, CA, USA; 4. McGill Univ. Health Centre Res. Inst., Montreal, QC, Canada The Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) is an integral membrane glycoprotein that functions as an anion channel and influences diverse cellular processes. Its role in salt transport has been well studied, but its possible role in maintaining epithelial polarity and barrier function have not been investigated. We studied the effect of expressing wild-type (WT-) or \u2206F508-CFTR using the CFBE41o-cell line from human CF bronchial epithelium. Cells were cultured at the air/liquid interface and GFP-tagged WT-or \u2206F508-CFTR was transiently expressed using adenoviruses. The results were compared with those obtained from CFBE41olines stably complemented with WT-CFTR (CFBE-WT) or \u2206F508-CFTR (CFBE-\u2206F). CFTR was localized by immunostaining and GFP fluorescence, and barrier function was monitored as transepithelial resistance (TER) and 14 C-mannitol backflux. Although CFTR is an anion channel and its expression would be expected to reduce TER, transient overexpression of GFP-CFTR increased the TER of CFBE41o-monolayers from 380\u00b125 to 638\u00b162 \u2126.cm 2 (n=8, p<0.005) whereas transient overexpression of GFP-\u2206F508-CFTR had no effect (348\u00b147 \u2126.cm2). Imaging confirmed that changes in TER were correlated with the localization of CFTR; GFP-CFTR was detected at the apical membrane whereas only perinuclear GFP-\u2206F508-CFTR was observed. CFBE-WT cells formed high-TER monolayers (1560\u00b194 \u2126.cm 2 ) whereas CFBE-\u2206F had dramatically lower TER= 323\u00b128 \u2126.cm 2 . Reducing the temperature to 29\u221eC for 24h to enhance \u2206F508-CFTR processing increased the TER of CFBE-\u2206F monolayers to 640\u00b1108 \u2126.cm 2 (n=12, p<0.001), but had little effect on CFBE-WT monolayers, which already had higher TER (826\u00b178 vs control: 868\u00b1110 \u2126.cm 2 ). Rescue at 29\u221eC reduced 14 C-mannitol backflux and increased the TER of CFBE41ocell monolayers to values near those observed for CFBE-WT monolayers (1005\u00b185 vs 494\u00b181 \u2126.cm 2 at 37\u221eC, n=8, p<0.001), and the effect of temperature on TER was reversible through two cycles of restrictive and permissive temperatures. The results suggest that CFTR expression at the plasma membrane strongly influences TER, and this effect is probably at the level of tight junctions because 14 C-mannitol is an indicator of paracellular permeability and the changes in TER are opposite to those expected for insertion of a conductance in the membrane. The temperature dependence of TER was not dependent on the Clconcentration and was not affected by CFTRinh172, which strongly inhibited forskolin-stimulated current, suggesting that CFTR-induced changes in barrier function do not depend on its channel activity. After \u2206F508-CFTR rescue by low-temperature, genistein (10 \u00b5M) reduced the TER to the value observed without rescue (888\u00b1152 vs 561\u00b196 \u2126.cm 2 ; n=7, p< 0.05, vs 37\u221eC: 580\u00b193 \u2126.cm 2 ), suggesting a possible involvement of a tyrosine kinase. CFTR trafficking to the apical membrane may be required for the optimal organization of junctional complexes, and partial loss of this barrier function in tissues that express \u2206F508-CFTR may contribute to epithelial abnormalities in CF.

Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Bethesda, MD, USA; 3. GeneGo, Encinitas, CA, USA One unresolved issue in cystic fibrosis research is whether the defective CFTR trafficking and resulting functional loss is directly linked to the often seen chronic inflammatory state, and if so what is the possible mechanism. OMICs experiments investigating protein or gene expression changes due to altered CFTR trafficking have produced long lists of elements significantly changed in expression but have no apparent connection to inflammation. Likewise, microarray experiments documenting the effects of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on bronchial epithelial cell gene expression patterns have yielded no insights into CFTR trafficking or its role in the infection process. In an attempt to understand the possible interplay between inflammation and CFTR trafficking, we combined and analyzed the results of several published OMIC studies using MetaMiner (Cystic Fibrosis), a knowledge base data analysis system created by CFFT and GeneGo, Inc. The results of 7 OMICs studies were entered into the analysis system and examined for known, published interactions between the experiments. Unexpectedly, numerous connections were established between genes documented to correct DF508 trafficking when expressed in cell lines (Trzcinska-Danelut, et. al. 2009 ) and a list of genes differentially expressed in bronchial epithelial cells after exposure to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Mayer et.al. 2007 GEO dataset GSE6802) . Of 34 genes documented to correct DF508 trafficking, 9 (CCL2, Endothelin-1, Calgranulin A, CCK, AQP3, Galectin-3, Caveolin-2, STAT1, PPAR-gamma) were directly linked by positive expression activation mechanisms to the inflammatory response. Two of the nine correctors, CCL2 and AQP3, were increased in expression in the bacterial infection model. STAT1, a trafficking corrector, is known to promote HSP90 and HSP70 expression which are involved in CFTR trafficking. However, STAT1 also influences other inflammatory response transcription factors which in turn activate expression of CCL2, Endothelin-1, CCK and Galectin-3. Looking at interactions among the results as a whole and in detail, it appears that an inflammatory response produces numerous changes which favor correct trafficking of DF508. In that regard, one can take an alternative view of the inflammatory process as potentially a compensatory mechanism for dysfunctional DF508 trafficking. Using knowledge management platforms to integrate multiple disciplines within the CF research community should accelerate our understanding of disease mechanism and identify therapeutic targets.",

In Ussing chamber experiments, VX-770 plus forskolin increased CFTR-mediated Clsecretion in G551D/F508del-HBE by approximately 10-fold to about 50% of that observed in HBE isolated from individuals without cystic fibrosis (EC 50 = 236 \u00b1 200 nM). The increase in CFTR function by VX-770 was sufficient to reduce the excessive epithelial Na + channel (ENaC)-mediated Na + absorption to levels observed in wild-type HBE as determined by the change in potential difference response to amiloride (-46 \u00b1 2 mV in untreated G551D/F508del-HBE vs. -22 \u00b1 1 mV in VX-770-treated G551D/F508del-HBE vs. -17 \u00b1 4 mV in wildtype-HBE). VX-770 had no effect on ENaC function in recombinant cells, suggesting that the decrease in Na+ transport was the result of CFTR potentiation. We further found that VX-770 was able to decrease the airway surface liquid absorption rate in G551D/F508del-HBE towards that observed in wild-type HBE (1.25 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b5l/cm 2 /hr in untreated G551D/F508del-HBE vs. 1.0 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b5l/cm 2 /hr in VX-770-treated G551D/F508del-HBE vs. 0.82 \u00b1 0.01 \u00b5l/cm 2 /hr in wild-type HBE), which is consistent with the decrease in ENaC-mediated Na + transport. Finally, the increase in airway surface volume caused by VX-770 was sufficient to increase the cilia beating frequency from 2.9 \u00b1 0.3 to 11 \u00b1 1 Hz in G551D/F508del-HBE. These results support the hypothesis that pharmacological agents that increase defective CFTR function may rescue ion and fluid transport in cultured human cystic fibrosis airway cells. We have identified and validated a variety of chemically and structurally distinct molecules as correctors of the CFTR-\u2206F508 trafficking mutation. The next stage in the drug discovery process will be discovery of mechanism(s) of action leading to correction. To elucidate the events involved in correcting CFTR-\u2206F508 we generated a compendium of genome-wide corrector transcriptional profiles.",

We acknowledge the support of Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics. The most common cystic fibrosis (CF)-causing mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is deletion of Phe508 (\u2206F508) in the first of two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). The \u2206F508 mutation leads to defects in cellular processing and folding, as well as channel gating. As a potential therapy for CF, small-molecule compounds have been identified that correct processing/folding defects (correctors) and/or channel gating defects (potentiators). We report NMR studies of the interactions of a number of newly identified small-molecule compounds with wild type (WT) and \u2206F508 human NBD1. In order to obtain appropriate solubility and yields required for NMR, our constructs lack the regulatory insert (\u2206RI) normally contained within NBD1. These constructs either retain or omit the regulatory extension (\u2206RE), which is composed of the first 25 residues of the R region. Addition of several related compounds to both WT and \u2206F508 (\u2206RI \u2206RE) (387-646) gives NBD1 spectra with changes in chemical shifts for residues in the two short C-terminal helices and intervening loop (634) (635) (636) (639) (640) (641) (642) (643) (644) (645) (646) . In contrast, minimal shifts were observed when compounds were added to constructs retaining the RE in . We have previously reported that phosphorylation disrupts interactions between the murine NBD1 core and the RI/RE regions. Titration of compounds into phosphorylated constructs for both WT and \u2206F508 reveals similar chemical shifts although to a lesser degree. We interpret these results to imply that the small-molecule compounds compete with the C-terminal helix and the RE/R region for interaction with the NBD1 core. We hypothesize that binding to the C-terminal site displaces the RE/R region from its NBD1 site, thereby promoting NBD dimerization required for ATP hydrolysis and accounting for the potentiating effects of the compounds. Additionally, we suggest that promoting dimerization could stabilize the folding of full-length CFTR, accounting for the corrector effect of the compounds.

Protein kinases and phosphatases have long been known to regulate CFTR function. However, the role of phosphorylation in CFTR biogenesis and trafficking remains less explored. Recently, it was shown that recombinant casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylates in vitro CFTR NBD1 at the residue serine 422 [1] . In addition, CFTR possesses several CK2 consensus phosphorylation sites, namely S511 (very close to F508) and T1471 at the C-terminus. Our aim here was to determine how mutation of these putative CK2 P-sites affects the CFTR biogenesis, turnover and processing.",

Pulse-chase experiments followed by CFTR immunoprecipitation, Western blot assays and functional assessment by iodide efflux assay were performed in these cells. Quantification of bands B (immature form) and C (mature form) of CFTR in pulse-chase shows that substitution of S511 does not affect the turnover or processing of either wtor F508del-CFTR. However, substitution of threonine at position T1471 to D (but not to A) completely impairs the processing of wt-CFTR and increases the turnover of F508del-CFTR. Interestingly, T1471A although not interfering in the production of mature protein, abolishes CFTR function. Mutation of S422 to an aspartic acid residue, although not compromising the appearance of mature CFTR, reduces its function by 40%. Moreover, treatment of cells with 20 \u00b5M TBB (tetrabromobenzotriazole, a specific inhibitor of CK2) for 90 min significantly reduces the processing efficiency of wt-CFTR.",

            "text": "The activity of cytoplasmic domains of CFTR controls channel opening and closing of the anion-selective pore. The channel activation requires phosphorylation of the R-domain while ATP interacts at the two nucleotidebinding domains (NBD), playing a critical role on the channel gating. We discovered several years ago the dual activity compounds benzo [c] quinolizinium and hypothesized that the NBD1-R domain tandem could be an important molecular site on CFTR for interaction with these compounds (Becq et al. J Biol Chem 1999; 274:27415; Dormer et al. J Cell Sci 2001; 114:4073; Stratford et al. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 2003; 300:524; Norez et al. J Pharmacol Exp Ther 2008; 325:89) . We also performed a molecular dissection of this part of CFTR by examining several CFTR mutants (constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed as GFP-tagged proteins in HEK and BHK cells) situated in the neighborhood of the putative latest \u03b2 strands (\u03b2 c 5 and \u03b2 c 6) of the NBD1 (Callebaut et al. Cell Mol Life Sci 2004; 61:230) . Two glycine residues appear highly conserved in ABC transporters and are suspected to form the hairpin (G622) between the two \u03b2 strands or to be located at the extremity of the last \u03b2 S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) is an endogenous signaling molecule with many potentially beneficial effects. GSNO is normally present in the lung but concentrations tend to be low in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Previously, we and several other research groups have found that different Snitrosylating agents, including GSNO, increase the expression, maturation and function of mutant \u2206F508 CFTR in human airway epithelial cells. Further, we showed that \u2206F508 CFTR maturation leads to the cell surface expression following GSNO treatment. We also examined the relative ability of GSNO and hypothermia (27 o C) to up-regulate \u2206F508 CFTR expression. We have also demonstrated a role for different molecular co-chaperones, including Hsp70/Hsp90 organizing protein (Hop), in the regulation of mutant \u2206F508 CFTR expression. Also of interest, we found through Western blot analysis and more recently by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy that Hop is expressed in CFBE41o-cells, CFPAC-1 cells and A549 cells. In addition, we showed that GSNO S-nitrosylated Hop decreases Hop expression and also decreases the association between Hop and \u2206F508 CFTR in the ER. Interestingly, knockdown of endogenous Hop by using siRNA duplexes for Hop, produced marked increases in levels of fully mature forms of \u2206F508 CFTR; but, in the presence of GSNO, expression of mature form of \u2206F508 CFTR, significantly increased. At present, we sought to determine whether GSNO and hypothermia increase stability and decrease the internalization rate of mutant \u2206F508 CFTR. CFBE41o-cells were grown at 37 o C to 70% confluence, and then incubated for an additional 48 hr at 27 o C in the presence or absence of GSNO (10 \u00b5M) for last 4 hr. Internalization rates were then performed at 37 o C, using a two-step biotinylation processes. Following biotin labeling cells were lysed and CFTR was immunoprecipitated with an anti-CFTR antibody (kindly provided by Dr. J. Riordan). Interestingly, we found that both GSNO and hypothermia not only induce mutant \u2206F508 CFTR expression but also enhance stability of \u2206F508 CFTR in the cell surface and decrease the internalization rate of \u2206F508 CFTR in CFBE41o-cells. On the other hand, the combination of both treatments (GSNO/hypothermia) has a greater effect on stability and internalization rate of \u2206F508 CFTR than either alone. These data indicate that GSNO treatment may be complemented by other corrector therapies to exploit more than one mechanistic pathway, achieving the restoration of mutant \u2206F508 CFTR function.

Chemestry and Biochemestry Department, Faculty of Sciences University of Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal; 2. Human Genetics Department, National Institue of Health Dr. Ricardo Jorge, Lisboa, Portugal Regulation of CFTR early and late intracellular trafficking as well as channel activation is the result of a complex network of CFTR interacting proteins (CIPs) namely, molecular chaperones, glycosidases, the basal trafficking machinery (Rab GTPases, SNAREs and PDZ-domain-proteins) and other factors including molecular switches (like protein kinases and phosphatases). Among CIPs yet to be identified and/or characterized are those affecting CFTR biogenesis/traffic by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, described to have a role in signal transduction and signalling in haematopoietic cells. Its consensus for protein phosphorylation includes a tyrosine followed by two negative residues. In CFTR, this consensus appears only once at residue 512 (i.e., very close to F508, the residue which is deleted in most CF patients).",

The gallbladder preparations were treated on both apical and basolateral sides with either DMSO vehicle or corrector (C) concentrations equivalent to the reported K a (1-3 \u00b5M) or 10 \u00b5M for 24 hrs. After treatment, the gallbladder cultures were mounted in Ussing chambers in standard Kreb's bicarbonate Ringers containing the same concentration of corrector. After equilibration, gallbladder preparations were treated with a forskolin/IBMX/genistein cocktail for 15 min followed by sequential treatments with 25 \u00b5M CFTR(inh)-172 and 100 \u00b5M niflumic acid (NFA) for 10 min each. Vehicle control studies showed nearly complete loss of the CFTR(inh)-172-sensitive I sc (CFTR \u2206I sc ) and small increase in the NFA-sensitive I sc , a measure of alternative Clconductances (ACC \u2206I sc ), in the \u2206F508 CFTR as compared to wild-type preparations (WT: CFTR \u2206I sc = 62.1\u00b19.0 and ACC I sc = 2.1\u00b11.1 vs. \u2206F: CFTR \u2206I sc = 1.6\u00b10.9 and ACC I sc = 5.6\u00b10.5 \u00b5A/cm 2 , p<0.05, n = 4 -8) . The corrector C1 demonstrated a positive concentration-response relationship for the CFTR \u2206I sc (3 \u00b5M = 3.2 \u00b1 0.0; 10 \u00b5M 6.4 \u00b1 1.3) but not for the ACC \u2206I sc (3 \u00b5M = 7.4 \u00b1 2.8; 10 \u00b5M 3.2 \u00b1 2.6, n = 3-4). The corrector C3 did not correct the CFTR \u2206I sc at 2 \u00b5M but increased both CFTR \u2206I sc and ACC \u2206I sc at 10 \u00b5M (CFTR \u2206I sc : = 11.1\u00b18.0; ACC \u2206I sc = 8.0\u00b11.6, n =2). Measurements of the transepithelial conductance under all conditions did not indicate adverse effects of C1 or C3 on mucosal integrity. Evaluation of other correctors is on-going. In conclusion, positive effects of the publicly available correctors C1, C3 and C6 on \u2206F508 CFTR processing were found using Western blot analysis and/or native murine gallbladder mucosa. However, the functional studies indicate that the level of correction (10-18%) at the concentrations used is likely near the lower limit of therapeutic value for cystic fibrosis patients.",

These compounds can be classified according to their effects on CFTR: small molecules that modulate CFTR function are termed potentiators or inhibitors, whereas small molecules that rescue mutant CFTR maturation efficiency are termed correctors. One possible mechanism by which these compounds may affect CFTR, is by direct interaction. We have developed assays to test whether a given compound is able to directly interact with the critical NBD1-CFTR or predicted sites within full length CFTR. NBD1-CFTR contains the most common CF-causing maturation mutation, the deletion of phenylalanine at position 508, a mutation that destabilizes the isolated domain; known NBD1-CFTR ligands (such as ATP) stabilize the domain. The panel of CFFT compounds and other known CFTR modulators were assessed for direct interaction with NBD1-CFTR utilizing a stabilization assay. Under mild denaturant conditions, a number of the tested compounds were able to protect the native conformation of NBD1-CFTR by directly interacting with this subdomain of CFTR. In addition, specific, predicted, interdomain binding sites shared with NBD1-CFTR were tested with mutants designed to fill these sites in full length CFTR. Identification of the site(s) of action of small molecule CFTR modulators provides critical mechanistic information and is the first step towards elucidating relevant structures.",

Previous work has shown that CFTR-NBDs possess the capacity for two different kinds of enzymatic activity that are coupled to channel opening and closing. In the presence of ATP alone, ATPase activity (ATP \u00c7 ADP + P i ) governs normal channel gating. However, when ATP is added in the presence of adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP), adenylate kinase activity (ATP + AMP \u00c4 ADP + ADP) regulates channel activity. Adenylate kinases have distinct binding-sites for ATP and AMP that often bind cooperatively. Although structural and functional studies have ascertained where ATP binds in the NBDs of CFTR and other ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, the amino acid residues involved in AMP-binding and the mechanisms underlying adenylate kinase activity and adenylate kinase-dependent CFTR gating are unknown. We hypothesized that as in other adenylate kinases, AMP binds to a site in CFTR that is distinct from the ATP-sites and that ATP and AMP mutually influence their interaction with CFTR.",

As others have reported, we found that [\u03b1 32 P]8-N 3 -ATP labeled CFTR. Non-radioactive ATP reduced labeling, suggesting specific labeling of the ATP-sites. AMP did not reduce 8-N 3 -ATP labeling indicating that it did not compete at the ATP-sites. Instead, AMP increased 8-N 3 -ATP labeling by ~20% suggesting that it induced conformational changes that involve the ATP-sites. When we added [\u03b1 32 P]8-N 3 -AMP alone, it only weakly labeled CFTR. However, when we repeated the experiment in the presence of ATP, labeling with [\u03b1 32 P]8-N 3 -AMP increased several fold. This labeling decreased in the presence of nonradioactive AMP suggesting specific labeling of the AMP-site. 8-N 3 -AMP labeling of CFTR also decreased when Ap 4 A or P 1 ,P 5 -di(adenosine-5') pentaphosphate (Ap 5 A) was added; Ap 4 A and Ap 5 A are compounds that bind both ATP-and AMP-sites of adenylate kinases. In addition, we found that CFTR was readily labeled with [\u03b2 3 32 P]8-N 3 -Ap 4 A and that labeling was reduced when we added non-radioactive Ap 4 A or Ap 5 A. Importantly, photolabeling was reduced both by non-radioactive ATP and by AMP, consistent with [\u03b2 3 32 P]8-N 3 -Ap 4 A interacting with both ATP-and AMP-sites in CFTR. In summary, these results indicate that 1) AMP binds to a site within CFTR that is different from the ATP-sites; 2) ATP enhances specific labeling of the AMP-site; 3) AMP induces conformational changes that involve the ATP-sites; and 4) ATP and AMP interactions with CFTR show some similarities to other adenylate kinases. Specific labeling of the AMP-site could provide a tool to identify labeled CFTR peptides that are involved in AMP-binding.",

Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA Type III Secretion System (T3SS) toxins of P. aeruginosa are important virulence factors in Pseudomonas infections. In a mouse model of Pseudomonas pneumonia, infection with P. aeruginosa Exo S+ strains causes an increase in total amount of fluid in the lungs as determined at autopsy in contrast to infection with P. aeruginosa Exo Sstrains. The exact molecular mechanism underlying these observations is not known. ExoS is a bifunctional protein with GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) activity at the N terminal domain and ADP ribosyl transferase (ADPRT) activity at the C terminal domain. We find that ExoS-GAP activity increases total cellular levels of mature (C band) Wild Type (WT) CFTR in CFBE41o-and MDCK cells as measured by Western blot analysis. R146K, a mutant of ExoS-GAP, lacking the GAP activity fails to significantly increase WT CFTR total levels. This indicates that GAP activity conferred by the R146 residue is essential for its effect. In contrast, ExoS-GAP fails to increase total levels of band B of \u2206508 CFTR. This indicates that targets of ExoS-GAP exist in CFTR trafficking beyond the ER degradation pathway. ExoS-GAP fails to increase total levels of Na + /K + ATPase indicating that ExoS-GAP targets are mediators of trafficking pathways specific to CFTR and related proteins. Increase in total CFTR by ExoS is mediated by decreased delivery of WT CFTR for lysosomal degradation. Protein turnover studies corroborate this mechanism wherein turnover of WT CFTR in cells transfected with ExoS-GAP is much slower than in control cells or in cells transfected with R146K. ExoS-GAP also brings about a corresponding increase in surface levels of mature WT CFTR.",

The decrease could be occurring in part by inactivation of small molecular weight G-proteins involved in delivery of WT CFTR to lysosomes. Increases in total and hence surface levels of CFTR could in part explain increased amounts of fluids seen in the P. aeruginosa pneumonia mouse model treated with Exo S+ strains. This study is supported by CFF and NIH. The balance between protein biosynthesis and degradation is one of the most important determinants for CFTR delivery to, and function at, the cell surface. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), this balance is determined by proteins that facilitate folding (i.e. the Sec61 translocon and molecular chaperones) and components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The heat shock proteins of 70 kDa, constitutive Hsc70 and inducible Hsp70 (referred to here as Hsp70), reside at the junction of these two competing pathways. During CFTR biosynthesis, Hsp70 together with cochaperones (i.e. Hdj1 and Hdj2) is proposed to assist folding and maturation. The resulting improvement in folding efficiency is expected to render CFTR less susceptible to proteasomal degradation. In contrast, Hsp70 is also reported to recruit E3 enzyme complexes (i.e. CHIP-UbcH5a) that facilitate covalent ubiquitin attachment needed for proteasome targeting. The mechanism and extent to which the Hsp70 system contributes to these opposing fates for CFTR remain unknown.",

We now selectively manipulate cytosolic Hsp70 function Organellar acidification by the electrogenic vacuolar proton-ATPase is coupled to anion uptake and cation efflux to preserve electroneutrality. The defective organellar pH regulation, caused by impaired counterion conductance of the mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), remains highly controversial in epithelia and macrophages. Impaired functional expression of CFTR has been implicated in the hyperacidification, and alkalinization, as well as having no effect on organellar pH regulation. Restricting the pH-sensitive, fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC) probe to CFTR containing vesicles, the counterion and proton permeability, and the luminal pH of endosomes were measured in various cells, including genetically matched CF and non-CF human respiratory epithelia, as well as cftr+/+ and -/-mouse alveolar macrophages. Passive proton and relative counterion permeabilities, determinants of endosomal, lysosomal and phagosomal pH-regulation, were also probed with FITC-conjugated transferrin, dextran and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. Although CFTR function could be documented in recycling endosomes and immature phagosomes, neither CFTR channel activation nor inhibition influenced the pH in any of these organelles. CFTR heterologous overexpression also failed to alter endocytic organellar pH, implying that the chloride accumulation does not limit the vesicular acidification. We propose that the relatively large CFTR-independent counterion and small passive proton permeability ensure efficient shunting of the proton-ATPase generated membrane potential. These results have implications in the regulation of organelle acidification in general and demonstrate, consistent with a subset of previous studies, that perturbations of the endo-lysosomal organelles pH homeostasis cannot be linked to the etiology of the CF lung disease. Supported by CIHR and NIH. CFTR\u2206F508 is the most common mutation in cystic fibrosis. It has at least three defects: it disrupts biosynthetic processing, it reduces the channel opening rate, and it decreases the protein lifetime on the cell membrane. Unlike human CFTR\u2206F508, mouse CFTR\u2206F508 is partially processed to the cell membrane, yet it exhibits a gating defect similar to hCFTR\u2206F508. To better understand which regions of the protein are important in causing CFTR\u2206F508 processing and gating defects, we designed a series of humanmouse CFTR chimeras including the membrane spanning domain 2 (MSD2) and the two nucleotide binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2). We found that substitution of mNBD1 partially rescued the processing defect of CFTR\u2206F508; the C-terminal portion of mNBD1 (the Regulatory Extension, RE) was critical for this rescue. The crystal structures of CFTR-NBD1 suggest that the RE region lies on the surface of NBD1 and therefore may be accessible for interaction with other domains in CFTR or with other proteins. In contrast, none of the mNBD1 chimeras rescued the gating defect. Models of CFTR structure suggest interactions between NBD1 and the intracellular loops (ICLs) of MSD2. Therefore, we substituted mMSD2 into hCFTR and found that it did not rescue the CFTR\u2206F508 processing defect, but it did affect gating. The mMSD2 chimera reduced the channel opening rate of CFTR. However, adding the \u2206F508 mutation caused no further decrease in opening rate. We found that both ICL3 and ICL4 of MSD2 are important for this change. These results indicate that the CFTR\u2206F508 processing and gating defects involve different mechanisms. By pointing to specific regions of CFTR that alter the effects of \u2206F508, the data may sug-gest novel strategies for correcting the defects caused by the \u2206F508 mutation.",

Department of Physiology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH, USA The goal of this study was to develop an accurate, precise and high throughput method for quantitative analysis of plasma membrane CFTR. In this work, we report the first mass spectrometry (MS) method for quantifying plasma membrane CFTR. Wild type CFTR, isolated from CFBE41o-, BHK and HT29 cells by immunoprecipitation and cell surface biotinylation, was digested by trypsin and the resulting peptide mixture was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (LC)-MS. Several peptides were selected as candidate signature peptides for the protein, based on LC-MS analysis of the tryptic digest of full-length, wild type CFTR. After validation experiments, one peptide (NSILTETLHR, termed as CFTR01) was chosen as the marker peptide for the protein. Compared with the intact CFTR, the marker peptide was a better analyte with regard to sample preparation and MS analysis. An oxygen-18 stable isotope-labeled version of CFTR01 was also prepared and used as the reference peptide, which provided internal standardization for MS quantitation of CFTR in each sample. Quantitation of the marker and reference peptides was performed using multiple reaction monitoring MS. A workflow was established from generating the marker peptide for CFTR samples to MS quantitation. This analytical platform had a low femtomole and high attomole quantitation limit with a statistical error of about 20%. The MS assay of plasma membrane CFTR is expected to be useful in high throughput drug discovery experiments designed to identify compounds that increase the plasma membrane expression of deltaF508-CFTR, as well as in studying cellular trafficking of CFTR.",

Ubiquitination has multiple cellular functions including targeting proteins for proteasomal and lysosomal degradation. Ubiquitination is a process where the C-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin covalently attaches to the lysine residue in the target protein through an isopeptide bond. Polyubiquitin chains can be formed by repeated addition of ubiquitin to one of the seven lysine residues in ubiquitin itself. The polyubiquitination chain serves as a signal to tag its substrate protein for proteolysis in the lysosomal or proteasomal compartments, or in some cases to nonproteolytic events. The configuration of the polyubiquitination chain determines in which compartment proteolysis occurs. Lysine (K) 48-linked chains are well established as mediators of proteasomal degradation. Recently, non-classical, lysine (K) 63-linked ubiquitination was found to act in lysosomal degradation and nonproteolytic events. \u2206F508-CFTR undergoes proteasome-dependent degradation by passing through ER-associated quality control mechanisms. Wildtype CFTR or rescued \u2206F508-CFTR in the cell periphery undergoes lysosome-dependent degradation and is thus also subjected to peripheral quality control. Previously, we have demonstrated that association of wild-type CFTR with CAL leads to the enhanced lysosomal degradation of mature CFTR. To investigate the role of ubiquitination in this process, we epitopically expressed mutant ubiquitins and monitored their effect on CAL-mediated CFTR degradation. To determine whether lysine 48 or lysine 63 linked polyubiquitination is involved in the CAL-mediated degradation of CFTR, we transfected HA tagged wt, K48 or K63 ubiquitin with GFP-CFTR and myc-CAL into HEK293 cells. Both K48 and K63 polyubiquitination of GFP-CFTR were detected by immunoprecipitation of GFP-CFTR followed by Western blotting with an HA antibody. Overexpression of myc-CAL enhanced the degradation of CFTR as expected. Expression of wt and K48 ubiquitin had no effect on CFTR degradation. However, the K63 ubiquitin mutant blocked the degradation of GFP-CFTR caused by myc-CAL. These results suggested that K63-linked polyubiquitination is involved in CALmediated degradation of CFTR in the lysosomal compartment. We are currently utilizing bioinformatics tools and binding assays to identify which E3 ligases bind specifically to the coil-coiled domain of CAL and play a role in the CAL-mediated degradation of CFTR.

Dalton Cardiovascular Research Center, Columbia, MO, USA Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a phosphorylation-regulated chloride channel gated by ATP binding and hydrolysis at its nucleotide binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2). Mutations in the gene encoding CFTR cause the lethal genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). G551D is the third most common CF-related mutation worldwide. We've previously demonstrated that the G551D mutation completely eliminates the ATP-dependent gating of CFTR, rendering the open probability of the mutant channel ~100-fold lower than that of wild-type CFTR (Bompadre et al. J Gen Physiol 2007; 129:285) . The finding that N6-(2-phenylethyl)-ATP (PATP), a high affinity ATP analogue, potentiates G551D-CFTR by binding to NBD1 (Bompadre et al. J Biol Chem 2008; 283:5364) raises the possibility that enhancing nucleotide-NBD1 interaction may alleviate the functional defects. Our studies showing that the lock-open time of CFTR elicited by MgPPi is positively correlated with the ATP bringing stability in NBD1 (Tsai et al. J Gen Physiol 2009; 133:405) allows us to systematically search for candidate mutations that strengthen ATP-NBD1 interaction. Here, we report that a mutation at residue 401 (W401F), which has a lock-open duration ~2-fold longer than WT, turns G551D-CFTR ATP-responsive! In excised membrane patches, the basal current of W401F/G551D-CFTR was increased by 7.78 \u00b1 0.68 (n = 8) fold upon the application of 2.75 mM ATP. PATP (50 \u00b5M) increased the basal current by an even greater magnitude (22.34 \u00b1 3.12 fold, n = 5) than in G551D-CFTR (6.14 \u00b1 0.92 fold, n = 8), suggesting that W401F indeed further stabilizes nucleotide binding in NBD1. Interestingly, we found that the enhanced response to nucleotides by the W401F mutation was blunted by the S1347G mutation at NBD2's signature motif as reflected by a decreased ATP/basal ratio of 1.79 \u00b1 0.19 (P < 0.001, n = 12) and PATP/basal ratio of 4.83 \u00b1 0.55 (P < 0.001, n = 5). As crystal structures of NBDs from many ABC proteins show that this serine residue at the signature sequence of NBD2 forms a hydrogen bond with the bound ATP molecule in NBD1, our results suggest that ATP or PATP link together F401 and S1347 from opposite NBDs, bringing the channel into a conformational state that functions better. We propose that reagents being able to promote entering into this state may help improve the functionality of G551D-CFTR. More extensive studies are now underway to characterize the newly-identified functional state and its relationship with pharmacological reagents.",

Comparison of the proteolytic patterns of wild-type CFTR and the deltaF508 mutant showed the loss of an NBD1related protease resistant fragment in the deltaF508 mutant, which was recovered upon insertion of the I539T suppressor mutation. Limited proteolysis on purified as well as in vitro translated NBD1 domains gave similar results, showing that a 25-kDa fragment within the NBD1 domain lost its stability in the deltaF508 mutant. Using antibodies that recognize specific sequences within the NBD1 domain, we found that the destabilized NBD1 fragment represents the NBD1 core domain, missing both the N-and C-terminus. We concluded that the deltaF508 mutation induced a local conformational change within the NBD1 domain of CFTR that could be reversed with I539T, which effectively rescued NBD1 stability.",

We performed a differential display RT-PCR screen on RNA isolated from IB3-1 CF epithelial cells treated with 4PBA for 0-24 hours, and isolated a cDNA encoding a putative human STAT-3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-3) interacting protein (StIP-1) that regulates STAT-3.

As detected by cell surface biotinylation followed by CFTR immunoprecipitation, co-expression of CK19 increased the plasma membrane expression of wt-CFTR 2.5-fold. In Calu-3 and HeLa cells stably expressing wt-CFTR, the over-expression of CK19 using recombinant adenovirus (AdCK19) produced ~2-fold increase in CFTR-mediated Clfluxes/currents, assayed by SPQ and whole-cell patch clamp. The physiological role of CK19 was examined using recombinant lentiviruses containing shRNAs targeting its expression in HEK293 cells. Knockdown of endogenous CK19 by 50% yielded an 85% reduction in wt-CFTR at the plasma membrane. Cell surface CFTR internalization assays indicated that the expression of CK19 reduced the rate of wt-CFTR endocytosis. Thus, inhibition of CFTR endocytosis is a key aspect of the mechanism by which CK19 promotes apical CFTR stability. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that CK19 expression enhanced the maturation efficiency of wt-CFTR, while having no significant effect in promoting the maturation of \u2206F508-CFTR. Interestingly, however, the over-expression of CK19 stabilized temperature rescued \u2206F508-CFTR at the plasma membrane, increasing its density by 4.6-fold. This result was supported by transepithelial current measurements across CFBE41o-\u2206F508 epithelia, which showed that CK19 expression potentiated forskolin-stimulated Clcurrent by 65% after temperature rescue of the mutant. Taken together, our data reveal a novel mechanism by which the intermediate filament protein, CK19, stabilizes CFTR at the plasma membrane, increasing its plasma membrane density by inhibiting CFTR endocytosis. The retention of rescued \u2206F508-CFTR at the plasma membrane by CK19 may provide a therapeutic approach to CF by stabilizing mutant protein that escapes ER-associated degradation, or by facilitating the actions of ER-targeted correctors of \u2206F508-CFTR trafficking.",

Biochim Biophys Acta 2008; 1783 :1585 The interactions between the domains of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) are important for its function as a chloride channel and many mutations leading to cystic fibrosis (CF) are thought to disrupt critical intramolecular interactions. NBD2 is a critical component of these interactions, including the NBD1/NBD2 dimer required for ATP hydrolysis and channel opening. Multiple models of CFTR [1] [2] [3] point to significant interactions with the intracellular loop (ICL) regions that are likely important for transmitting information about the NBD state to the channel pore. Additionally, intriguing hints in the literature suggest that the R region, whose phosphorylation state regulates dimer formation and channel function [4] , also interacts with NBD2 [5, 6] . It has been difficult to obtain isolated NBD2 reagent for biochemical and structural studies, although a crystal structure has been determined for a NBD2-MalK fusion protein. Even with five solubilizing mutations, the isolated human NBD2 (hNBD2; residues 1193-1445) is only marginally soluble. However, by optimizing the purification protocol and buffer conditions, we have obtained sufficient hNBD2 concentrations for study via NMR spectroscopy.",

Using a non-linear Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to globally fit the data, the DSC transitions can be fit to a multi-step unfolding pathway that includes an irreversible step. The accompanying poster of Hunt and coworkers provides complementary isothermal unfolding data under conditions which overlap with those studied by DSC. Together, these studies enable us to propose a global unfolding model for NBD1.",

            "text": "In epithelial cells CFTR is endocytosed rapidly from the apical plasma membrane. The majority of internalized CFTR is then recycled efficiently back to the cell surface through the endosomal recycling compartment. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of the recently cloned lemur-tyrosine kinase (LMTK2) in regulating the recycling of CFTR in polarized human epithelial cells. RT-PCR analysis of human lung, intestine and pancreatic tissues revealed the presence of LMTK2 transcript in all tissues. Image analysis revealed that LMTK2 localizes to early and recycling endosomes and shows overlap with CFTR in these compartments. siRNA mediated knock-down of LMTK2 in T84 cells caused CFTR to be trapped in endosomes, reducing apical membrane CFTR levels and dramatically reducing forskolin-stimulated chloride secretion. In contrast, over expression of LMTK2 led to enhanced CFTR recycling and an increase in forskolin-stimulated chloride movement. Since LMTK2 is a kinase, we generated a point-mutation in the active site, rendering the kinase catalytically inactive. Overexpression of the \"dead kinase\" resulted in a loss of CFTRmediated chloride currents, similar to that seen with knock-down of LMTK2, suggesting that the dead kinase acts as a dominant negative. Furthermore, we show that CFTR is a target substrate for LMTK2 kinase activity. These studies demonstrate a role for LMTK2 in the recycling of CFTR in polarized epithelia, and suggest that phosphorylation events are involved in the acute regulation of CFTR trafficking. Finally our results suggest that activation of LMTK2 could be therapeutically beneficial by enhancing the recycling of internalized \u2206F508 CFTR.",

Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine, Universit\u00e9 Paris 12, Creteil, France Cystic fibrosis (CF) is mainly caused by mutations interfering with the biosynthetic folding of the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) protein. To better understand the regulation of CFTR processing and trafficking, we made a genetic screen, which identified COMMD1 as a new CFTR partner. COMMD1 was first found to be involved in the regulation of hepatic copper excretion and then in sodium uptake through interaction with ENaC (epithelial sodium channel). Currently, a growing number of data suggests that COMMD1 is associated with the ubiquitin proteasome system for regulating protein stability of NF-\u03baB subunits, ATP7B and HIF-1\u03b1.",

CFTR\u2206F508 biogenic defects are conditional and folding correctors are actively being developed as CF therapeutics. How the cellular environment impacts CFTR\u2206F508 folding efficiency, as well as the identity of correctable folding defects in CFTR\u2206F508, is currently unclear. The folding progression of CFTR appears to be monitored by at least two distinct endoplasmic reticulum quality control (ERQC) complexes that are located in the ER membrane and cytosol. The membrane-associated RMA1/Derlin-1 complex appears to recognize folding defects in CFTR that may involve misassembly of MSD2 into a complex with the amino-terminal regions of CFTR (1) . In contrast, the cytosolic Hsc70/CHIP complex appears to sense folding defects that are related to misassembly of NBD2 (1) . However, these previous observations were made with over-expressed RMA1 or CHIP and the extent to which endogenous levels of the ERQC components determine the fate of nascent forms of CFTR\u2206F508 has not been well-defined. In addition, whether activity of the ERQC machinery impacts the effectiveness of drugs developed to correct misfolding of CFTR\u2206F508 is unknown. We demonstrate that decreasing the endogenous pools of the E3 ubiquitin ligases RMA1 or CHIP by siRNA permits a sub-population of CFTR\u2206F508 to fold, escape the ER and accumulate as a maturely glycosylated species. In the absence of these ERQC factors, we found folding corrector Corr-4a to be more effective at rescuing folding defects in CFTR\u2206F508. Amazingly, the combination of RMA1 inactivation and Corr-4a treatment dramatically enhanced CFTR\u2206F508 folding 13-fold while a 6-fold increase was observed with Corr-4a treatment alone. It appears that some, but not all, folding defects in CFTR\u2206F508 are correctable, and a large pool of nascent CFTR\u2206F508 is degraded before Corr-4a action. RMA1 recognizes defects in CFTR\u2206F508 related to misassembly of a complex that contains MSD1, NBD1 and the R-domain (2) . Corr-4a could not rescue \u2206F508 dependent folding defects in these amino-terminal regions, but instead acts on CFTR\u2206F508 after MSD2 synthesis. Corr-4a appears to act in part via stabilization of the MSD2, which may enhance critical contacts between MSD2 and other sub-domains of CFTR, such as MSD1 or NBD1. Correction of folding defects recognized by the RMA1 ubiquitin ligase and/or global modulation of ERQC activity has the potential to increase CFTR\u2206F508 folding and provide an approach to treat CF.",

Texas A&M Health Science Center, College Station, TX, USA Cystic fibrosis (CF), a common human genetic disease, is caused by mutations in CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator). Over 1,600 mutations throughout the CFTR gene have been identified, many of which disrupt the function of the CFTR protein to cause CF. CFTR is a member of the ABC transporter superfamily that transports chloride ions across the apical membrane of epithelial cells. During biogenesis, the synthesis of CFTR polypeptides initiates on cytosolic ribosomes that are then targeted to the translocon in the ER membrane where the nascent CFTR chain is integrated into the membrane prior to transport through the Golgi to the plasma membrane. Interactions with many other proteins are essential to these processes. Some CF-associated mutations likely alter cotranslational interactions of the CFTR nascent chain with the protein factors involved in its folding, transport, modification, quality control, etc. In the current work, cotranslational protein interactions with the CFTR nascent chain have been identified using site-specific photocrosslinking. This method is based on tRNA-mediated incorporation of a single photo-reactive probe into the CFTR nascent chain at specific positions during its synthesis in vitro. Amber suppressor N \u03b5 -(5-azido-2-nitrobenzoyl)-Lys-tRNA amb (\u03b5ANB-Lys-tRNA amb ) is used to incorporate the probe into the nascent chain wherever an amber stop codon is introduced into the CFTR mRNA. Ribosome-bound CFTR nascent chains of a defined length were prepared by translation of truncated CFTR mRNAs. During the process of elongation, the extreme N-terminus of the CFTR nascent chain is found adjacent to 65, 80, 90, [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] 50 , and 70 kDa proteins depending on the length of the nascent chain and the location of the probe. Analysis of the photocrosslinking patterns demonstrates that the CFTR nascent chain is transferred from one protein to another during the process of its translation. To identify these proteins, a system was developed that includes: 1) in vitro preparation of CFTR ribosome nascent chain complexes with the photocrosslinking probe; 2) fractionation of cellular proteins; 3) selection of fractions containing the protein of interest using a photocrosslinking screen; and 4) identification of proteins in the selected fractions by mass spectrometry or immunoprecipitation. The first set of three interacting proteins identified includes: an N-terminal acetyltransferase-like protein (NAT), a Signal Recognition Particle subunit (SRP54), and the translation elongation factor, eEF-1\u03b1. Notably, wild-type and mutant CFTR exhibit different interaction efficiencies with some of these proteins, which may provide a mechanism of sorting wild-type from mutant CFTR.",

            "text": "The predominant mutation causing cystic fibrosis (CF) in the human population is the deletion of phenylalanine residue 508 (deltaF508) in the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). While the deltaF508 mutation alters the surface topography of NBD1 at its likely site of attachment to the transmembrane domains of CFTR, it does not alter the overall fold of the domain. However, there has been controversy concerning the influence of the mutation on the folding properties and stability of NBD1. Different biophysical techniques have given inconsistent results regarding whether the mutation significantly destabilizes the domain. This controversy has created uncertainty concerning the molecular defects that cause the pathological retention of deltaF508 CFTR molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum. To clarify the influence of the deltaF508 mutation on the thermodynamics of NBD1 folding, we have been characterizing its unfolding pathway using a combination of isothermal (this abstract) and thermal (accompanying abstract by Brouillette and coworkers) denaturation studies. The latest status of these studies and their implications for the molecular etiology of CF will be discussed. This work was supported by a grant from the CFFT. In Sept. 2007 AMRI entered into collaboration with Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics to screen AMRI's collection of natural product samples, for correctors and potentiators of the \u2206F508-CFTR response. AMRI's Natural Products Libraries comprise nearly 300,000 fermentations, extracts, and fractionations from over 35,000 unique plant, fungal, actinomycete, microorganism, and marine invertebrate sources. Natural products have been a rich source for drug leads. Between 1981 and 2002, 52% of all NCEs (new chemical entities) originated as natural products or were synthetic derivatives based on natural products. High-throughput screening (HTS) of the AMRI libraries was performed using a YFP/\u2206F508 CFTR FRT cell line in a 384-well FLIPR TetraPlus TM NaI Flux assay. The initial HTS yielded 8620 corrector and 4171 potentiator hits which exhibited activity at least 3 standard deviations above the mean of the blank control. Hit confirmation was performed by four-point dose/response in the NaI Flux screening assay. Samples with non-specific activity due to intrinsic sample fluorescence or which caused disruption of cellular membrane integrity were eliminated by performing four point dose/responses in the NaI Flux assay in the presence of CFTRinh-172, a CFTR blocker. Confirmed hits were prioritized based on their activity, dose/response effect, and lack of toxicity. Samples from 92 unique sources were further selected for dereplication and structure identification. Purified compounds were tested for corrector and potentiator activity in the NaI Flux assays and in 24-well corrector and potentiator conductance assays developed by Dr. Robert Bridges. One of the active compounds identified from a bacterial source was genistein, a well known potentiator of \u2206F508 CFTR. Dereplication of additional fractions from other sources has yielded unique active scaffolds as possible leads for drug development of CFTR correctors and potentiators.",

Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA Previously we identified that aspects of the cAMP pathway indicate a chronic activation of the inflammatory signaling cascade in cystic fibrosis (CF) epithelial cells. This increase in cAMP signaling was found to be responsible in part for the perinuclear accumulation of cholesterol as intervention with the cAMP-binding competitor Rp-cAMPS reverts cholesterol transport to wt characteristics. The hypothesis of this study is that a chronic increase in cAMP signaling is an initiating factor in CF-related inflammatory signaling. Markers of inflammatory signaling we have identified as exhibiting CF-related changes are an increase in STAT1, a decrease in SMAD3, and a decrease in NOS2 protein expression. CF-model 9/HTEocells were treated with Rp-cAMPS (50 \u00b5M) for 72 h and examined for STAT1 and SMAD3 protein expression by Western blot. STAT1 protein expression decreases significantly, while SMAD3 expression significantly increases in CF-model cells in the presence of Rp-cAMPS. These data demonstrate a reversion to wt phenotypes in the presence of Rp-cAMPS. To assess the effects of Rp-cAMPS in vivo, \u2206F508 mice (\u2206F/\u2206F) were treated with either saline or Rp-cAMPS (5mg/kg/day) for 12 days. Nasal epithelium was excised and examined for NOS2 and SMAD3 protein expression. Mice treated with Rp-cAMPS show restored NOS2 and SMAD3 expression in CF mice, while control mice demonstrate limited expression. These data show that the cAMP feedback response is critical to the control of CF-related signaling and that it is reversible with Rp-cAMPS. In order to assess whether the cAMP pathway has a potential impact on CF inflammatory signaling, the effect of Rp-cAMPS on NF-\u03baB activation and IL-6 and IL-8 production in response to IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 was examined. NF-\u03baB activation as measured by luciferase (NF-\u03baB-luc) is diminished by Rp-cAMPS in CFmodel 9/HTEo-cells but not affected in control cells. These data suggest a CF-related bias in the regulation of NF-\u03baB signaling by the cAMP pathway. If there is cAMP-mediated regulation of NF-\u03baB activation in CF cells, then it is expected that cytokine production should be similarly affected by Rp-cAMPS as was NF-\u03baB. To test this prediction, IL-8 and IL-6 secretion was examined in CF-model 9/HTEo-cells and controls in response to IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1. Identical to NF-\u03baB activation results, Rp-cAMPS has little influence on IL-8 or IL-6 production in control cells, but significantly reduces the production/secretion of these cytokines in CF-model cells. These data further demonstrate the central role of cAMP-related signaling as a key step in a number of CF cell regulatory characteristics. In vivo examination of this anti-inflammatory effect of Rp-cAMPS in CF mouse models is underway. Mechanistic analysis suggests that Rp-cAMPS-mediated control of CREB binding protein (CBP) binding to the p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB is responsible for the anti-inflammatory properties of Rp-cAMPS in CF models. We conclude that chronic activation of the cAMP pathway in CF alters cell regulatory balance to favor pro-inflammatory signaling and that this balance is reverted to wt characteristics with Rp-cAMPS. This work is supported by the NIH/NHLBI and CFF. Sci USA 2008; 105:4335-9) . We further showed that these cells are reconditioned through various signaling pathways (Makam et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2009; 106:2779-83.) , leading to novel competences. However, these results did not address whether reconditioned airway neutrophils retain immune competences expected from professional phagocytes, e.g., functional innate pathways that have evolved for pathogen elimination. Indeed, neutrophilic inflammation in CF airways coexists with chronic bacterial / fungal infections, suggesting immune incompetency.",

First, we assessed their ability to activate the caspase-1 dependent inflammasome, using a specific fluorescent substrate for the enzyme. Upon direct analysis (no exogenous activation) by flow cytometry (4-laser LSRII digital FACS, BD Biosciences), we observed a marked upregulation of caspase-1 activity in CF airway neutrophils, suggesting adequate inflammasome function in these cells. Second, we assessed the activation within CF neutrophils of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha pathway, a transcription factor pivotal to phagocyte function. Using direct single-cell analysis with a novel image cytometry platform (ImageStream, Amnis Corp.), we observed marked translocation of this transcription factor into the nucleus of CF airway, but not blood, neutrophils. Third, we assessed the ability of CF airway neutrophils to phagocytose bacteria and undergo proper phagosome acidification, a process suggested by some to be altered in CF. Using a rapid activation protocol (60 minutes, at 37 \u1b7a C) combined with bacterial particles bearing a pH-dependent fluoroscent label, we demonstrate by flow and image cytometry that CF airway neutrophils are competent at phagosome formation and acidification. Fourth, we sorted live airway neutrophils from the complex mixture of cells and debris present in CF sputum using a newly developed protocol and assessed their mRNA expression profile by microarrays. The mRNA expression profile results obtained are consistent with the notion that, while being reconditioned, CF airway neutrophils do retain essential innate immune functions.",

Mice deficient in A20 display persistent activation of NF-\u03baB by TLRs and tumour necrosis factor receptor, causing mortality among neonates and multiorgan inflammation in adults [1] . Prolonged Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA)-induced signaling via TLR2 contributes to chronic inflammation in cystic fibrosis (CF) . A20 has been shown to be a negative regulator of TLR2-induced inflammatory responses in the airway [2] .

Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol 2009; 40:295-304) . LPS signals through the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) through multiple mechanisms. First, TLR4 signals via the plasma membrane by promoting the activation of NFkB and MAPK (ERK1/2, p38, JNK) cascades. Additionally, the internalization of the TLR4 receptor and its localization in early endosomes activates the interferon beta (IFN-b) response through IRF-3. Subsequently, internalization of TLR4 has been associated with its own degradation and resolution of the inflammatory response. Tight control of active TLR4 is critical for an adequate and controlled inflammatory response. Given that the inflammatory response in CF appears to be hyperresponsive, we investigated the signal transduction and trafficking of TLR4 in WT and CF primary murine macrophages during LPS stimulation.",

Cells were treated for 10, 20 and 60 minutes with LPS and the protein lysates were assessed for the content of key phosphorylated proteins involved in signal transduction of the three pathways (pIKBa, pERK1/2, p38, JNK and pIRF-3). The phospho-protein content was analyzed by either Western blot or Luminex phospho-protein analysis. Protein lysates from untreated WT and CF cells served as controls. The data suggest that CF macrophages have a more rapid and prolonged signal transduction through IKBa, ERK1/2 and IRF3 compared to WT cells. To study the dynamics of plasma membrane TLR4 internalization and its localization with endosomal compartments, CF and WT macrophages were labeled at the membrane with a fluorescent antibody anti-TLR4 and internalization was induced by incubation at 37 \u1b7a C for 5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes in the absence or presence of LPS. We followed TLR4 internalization by flow cytometry, and TLR4 localization with the endosomal compartment by immunofluorescence microscopy (IF) and Imagestream technology. We found that TLR4 internalization was similar in WT and CF macrophages in the absence of LPS such that 50% of the receptors are internalized over 15 min. In contrast, in the presence of LPS, TLR4 internalization was significantly more robust (50% of TLR4 is internalized in less than 5 min) in CF than WT macrophages (p=0.03). In addition, the IF and Imagestream data show that at 30 minutes, CF macrophages had significant accumulation of internalized TLR4 in the endosomal compartment compared to WT cells. In conclusion, our data support the hypothesis that the lack of functional CFTR in macrophages affects the internalization and trafficking of TLR4 during LPS activation and these defects lead to abnormal increase of signal transduction with inefficient resolution. Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA In cystic fibrosis (CF), the depletion of upper airway surface liquid (ASL) and the failure of mucus transport leads to the characteristic phenotype. However, the ultimate origin of the ASL is not completely known. One hypothesis is that the alveoli, presumably alveolar type II cells, possess the ability to secrete fluid, and a portion of this liquid from the alveolar space is transported out into the airways, thus, contributing to total ASL volume. Moreover, recent studies have shown that within the upper airway, purine nucleotides, such as ATP/UTP, significantly regulate ion transport properties and airway surface liquid height across the epithelium. However, the role these soluble mediators play to mediate ion transport and liquid homeostasis within the alveoli is still unclear.",

Bioelectric analysis showed primary normal and CF cultures displaying similar transepithelial resistance, however, CF basal short circuit current was markedly less compared to normal alveolar type II cultures. Treatment of normal cultures with forskolin, the cAMP-inducer, UTP, or ionomycin, significantly induced Clsecretion in the presence of amiloride. Interestingly, forskolin and ionomycin-mediated Clsecretion was significantly reduced in CF alveolar type II cultures in the absence or presence of amiloride. Moreover, normal alveolar type II cultures treated with the extracellular nucleotide, UTP, exhibited an acute Clsecretion response. In addition, short circuit current response in CF cultures exposed to UTP compared to normal cultures was markedly inhibited. Increases in forskolin or UTP dependent alveolar surface liquid height in normal alveolar cultures was significantly inhibited in the presence of the CFTR inhibitor or in primary CF alveolar type II cultures, suggesting a significant role for CFTR-mediated Clsecretion within alveolar type II cells. More importantly, alveolar wall liquid height was significantly increased, up to 24 h, using normal alveolar type II cultures subjected to cyclic compressive stress (CCS), a model used to mimic normal tidal breathing. In addition, we generated a transgenic mouse model expressing the secreted Clara Cell 10 (CC10) protein fused to eGFP driven by the mouse alveolar type II cell promoter, surfactant protein-C (SP-C). To test whether the transgenic secreted protein was transported into the upper airway, the trachea was isolated and lavaged (partial lavage). The secreted transgene was detected within the partial lavage of mice expressing the eGFP fusion protein. Collectively, our data uncover a significant novel CFTR-dependent secretory capacity within primary alveolar type II cells. Understanding the physiology of ion transport within the alveoli and the potential communication between the alveolar space and upper airways within physiological and pathological environments may be crucial to developing targeted therapeutics. The relative roles of CFTR and Ca 2+ -activated Clchannels (CaCC) in the function of airway submucosal glands is controversial. To address this issue we produced primary cultures of epithelial cells from human airway glands that formed tight epithelia when grown on permeable supports. In terms of their ultrastructure (granule size and opacity) and secretory products (lactoferrin, mucin) we established cultures that resembled either mucous or serous phenotypes by growth factor modifications and selection of support membranes. Serous cell differentiation was established on polyester (PET) filters in laminin-supplemented medium, and mucous cell differentiation on polycarbonate filters in EGF-containing medium. In Ussing chambers, basal Clcurrents were larger in mucous than serous cells, and were stimulated in both cell types by ATP or methacholine. With normal Cl --containing media on both sides, forskolin had little effect on Clcurrents, though it became markedly stimulatory in the presence of a serosal-tomucosal Clgradient. Baseline and mediator-induced increases in Clcurrents were inhibited by 40-60% by CFTRinh-172. To measure Clconductances directly we performed whole cell patch clamp studies of single isolated cells, which visually maintained their serous or mucous characteristics. The CFTR-mediated Clconductances in the presence of maximal intracellular cAMP concentrations was very small in the two cell types (serous, 50.6 \u00b1 12.7 pS/pF; mucous 16.3 \u00b1 4.1 pS/pF), but inhibited by ~66% by GlyH-101 and thus distinct from non-specific leak currents. ATP-stimulated conductances were also small. However, the maximal Clconductance induced by ionomycin was an order of magnitude larger (serous, 651 \u00b1 73 pS/pF; mucous, 416 \u00b1 152 pS/pF). Expression of mRNA for TMEM16a (the likely molecular basis for CaCC) was 26x (serous) and 104x (mucous) more abundant than mRNA for CFTR.",

The apical HVCN1 H + channel of the airway epithelium contributes to cellular acid release into the airway surface liquid and likely supports the antibacterial activity provided by DUOX of the airways (Fischer H et al. Antiox Redox Signal 2009 Apr9 [Epub ahead of print]). A critical characteristic of the HVCN1 H + channel is its activation by an inside-to-outside H + gradient or by mucosal alkalinity, which is thought to be generated by bicarbonate secretion across CFTR. To investigate the regulation of HVCN1 by pH, we cloned the open reading frame of HVCN1 from total RNA prepared from human primary airway epithelial cultures from two donor lungs. In one lung we found two sequential polymorphisms at positions 452T->C and 453G->A resulting in a novel missense mutation M91T HVCN1. To determine the distribution of M91T HVCN1 in the human population, we investigated the genomic DNA Coriell panel SNP500V by PCR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. In 95 analyzed samples, the M91T mutation was found in one heterozygous sample, which was further verified by sequencing. Wildtype and M91T HVCN1 were recombinantly expressed in Cos-7 cells as GFP fusion proteins and H + currents were investigated by whole cell patch clamping. We found that M91T HVCN1 resulted in H + currents that required significantly larger H + gradients than wildtype for the activation of H + currents. The relation of the activation potential to outside pH was shifted by 0.6 pH units to more alkaline values for M91T HVCN1. Further, we performed measurements of acid secretion by confluent airway epithelial cultures that natively expressed the M91T mutation (or wildtype) using the pH stat technique. HVCN1-dependent H + secretion was identified by its sensitivity to mucosal Zn 2+ (10 \u00b5M). The mucosal threshold pH above which HVCN1-mediated H + secretion was activated was found to be on average pH=6.9 in wildtype cultures and pH=7.5 in M91T cultures, indicating that the mutant is active only at quite alkaline pH values. In both whole cell and transepithelial measurements, the maximal H + currents achieved during large pH gradients were not affected by the mutation suggesting that the M91T causes a defect in the pH-dependent gating of HVCN1. We predict that this HVCN1 mutation will negatively impact airway disease if present in a CF subject.",

The facts that 1) mucus and HCO 3 are secreted concurrently in tissues in general, 2) HCO 3 secretion is decreased in CF-affected organs, and 3) the severity of clinical manifestations in CF appear to be associated with the gravity of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-dependent bicarbonate transport defect all suggest that HCO 3 must be critical to the process of normal mucus secretion. We previously found that the absence of serosal HCO 3 appears to inhibit mucus release. In the present study, we asked whether luminal HCO 3 -would support mucus release. We also examined the molecular components of HCO 3 secretion that may be crucial to the mucus release process. Methods: We perfused paired distal small intestinal segments of CL57BL/6 mice stimulated with prostaglandin E 2 or 5-hydroxytryptamine in the presence or absence of luminal or serosal HCO 3 and collected the perfusates to measure the amount of mucus released.

Blocking HCO 3 entry via inhibition of the Na + -HCO 3 cotransporter (NBC) with 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS) decreased mucus release as much as did removal of serosal HCO 3 -, but carbonic anhydrase inhibition with acetazolamide did not decrease mucus release. Interestingly, the \u2206F508 intestine showed poor or no response to mucus stimulation regardless of whether serosal HCO 3 was present or absent. Conclusions: Thus, concurrent HCO 3 secretion appears to be a necessary component of the mucus release process. The poor response of mucus release to luminal HCO 3 suggests that HCO 3 secretion must accompany, and must be in close proximity to the site of, mucus release. Functional NBC and CFTR appear to be essential components of mucus secretion. We propose that the characteristically aggregated mucus, observed in mucin secreting organs, is a consequence of defective HCO 3 transport in CF.",

UNC-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA Mucins are high-molecular-weight glycoconjugates that line the airway surfaces and protect the lungs against pathogens by means of their viscoelastic properties. Alterations of the macromolecular composition and the biophysical properties of the mucus gel affect its rheology, causing reduced transportability and adherence to cell surfaces in disease. In CF, mucus clearance is impaired, which leads to mucus plugging, chronic infection, chronic inflammation and subsequent irreversible tissue damage. Despite an increasing interest in mucin biology, the causes of airway mucus accumulation are still unknown. In this work, we present data comparing normal and CF specimen that show mucin gene expression, mucin composition of the plugs and introduce a novel assay to measure mucus adhesion. Fifteen disease-control and 5 CF lung samples were collected for this project at the time of lung transplantation or death. To ensure high-quality mRNA, tissue dissection took place immediately upon receipt. Specific regions of the lungs, i.e. segmental bronchi, intermediate-size and small (\u2264 2mm diameter) airways were excised and either fixed or processed for mRNA analysis. The remaining lung tissue was processed to generate tracheobronchial air-liquid interface cell cultures. Following mRNA extraction, the levels of MUC5AC and MUC5B gene expression were measured by quantitative PCR and normalized to 18S. We showed that MUC5AC and MUC5B genes were upregulated in all-size CF airways, reaching up to 12.4-and 6.7-fold increase, for the respective mucins, in CF bronchi as compared to non-CF (p<0.05). Despite the lack of submucosal glands in the noncartilagenous airways, MUC5B expression was increased 5.9 fold in the small CF airways whereas MUC5AC expression remained low. Histology sections were used to confirm the absence of submucosal glands in the small airway samples. Immunostaining using new polyclonal antibodies against MUC5AC and MUC5B and AB/PAS staining revealed the presence of mucous glycoconjugates consistently in the airway surfaces of ventilated non-CF subjects but no mucus plug; whereas severe mucus obstruction occurred in CF airways. MUC5B signal was mainly detected in submucosal glands with few positive epithelial cells, while MUC5AC signal was restricted to the cell surfaces. Both mucins participated in the formation of the plugs. More work has to be done to determine the mucin subtype ratio in different areas of the lungs. Mucus adhesion in CF may be a crucial issue that requires to be addressed to restore mucus flow either by cough or by mucociliary clearance. Recently, our laboratory has generated a unique peel-test assay using a transducer device to measure the force required to remove mucus from epithelial surfaces and was used on normal and CF cultures and on organotypic lung explants. Our preliminary data showed increased mucus adhesion force in CF (1.4 mN) vs. normal (0.8 mN) cultures and measured a more robust force in organotypic explants (9.9 mN for normals, no CF was tested yet). This system offers a valuable in vitro model to uncover the causes of mucus adhesion and test pharmacological reagents, i.e. osmotic, emulsifying, chelators and/or mucolytic drugs, aimed to restore mucociliary clearance.",

Prior measurements of ASL depth have been made in airway epithelial cell cultures. Here, we established methodology to measure ASL depth to ~1-\u00b5m accuracy in intact fragments of freshly obtained human and pig tracheas. Airway fragments were mounted in chambers designed for perfusion of the basal surface, and observation of the apical, fluorescently stained ASL by z-scanning confocal microscopy using a high numerical aperture lens immersed in perfluorocarbon. Analysis routines were developed to deduce ASL depths for every x,y-pixel in z-image stacks, in order to report data in an unbiased manner as histogram distributions of ASL depths. Average ASL depth in well-differentiated primary cultures of non-CF human nasal respiratory epithelium was 8.3 \u00b1 0.8 \u00b5m (S.E., 8 cultures) under basal conditions, 8.0 \u00b1 1.5 \u00b5m following ENaC inhibition by amiloride, and 14.5 \u00b1 1.1 \u00b5m following CFTR stimulation by cAMP agonists. In CF nasal epithelial cell cultures, ASL depth was 6.3 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5m under basal conditions, slightly lower than that in the non-CF cultures, and not affected by IBMX/forskolin. ASL depth in human trachea was 7.0 \u00b1 0.7 \u00b5m under basal conditions, 11.0 \u00b1 1.7 \u00b5m following amiloride, 17 \u00b1 3 \u00b5m following cAMP agonists, and 7.1 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b5m after CFTR inhibition. Similar results were found in pig trachea. This study provides the first direct measurements of ASL depth in ex vivo fragments of intact human and pig airways, and indicates the involvement of ENaC sodium channels and CFTR chloride channels in determining ASL depth. We propose that a primary cause of CF lung disease is the inability of CFTR-deficient airways to increase their ASL depth following various secretory stimuli that in non-CF airways produce transient increases in ASL depth.",

CF Research Laboratory, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA; 2. Internal Medicine, Iowa University, Iowa City, IA, USA; 3. Pathology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA Human CF airway submucosal glands show a profound reduction in mucus secretion (Joo et al. J Biol Chem 2002; 277:50710; Salinas et al. Faseb J 2005; 19:431; Joo et al. J Biol Chem 2006; 281:7392; Song et al. Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 2006; 290:C741; Choi et al. J Clin Invest 2007; 117:3118; Choi et al. J Clin Invest 2009; 119:1189) . To evaluate the role of CFTR in airway gland secretion of the CF pig model (Rogers et al. J Clin Invest 2008; 118:1571; Rogers et al. Science 2008; 321:5897) , we used in situ optical monitoring to measure individual airway gland secretion rates in isolated tracheal mucosa from WT, heterozygous (cftr +/-, HZ) and CF (\u2206F508/null and null/null) piglets less than a week old. All secretion rates are expressed as picoliters/min/gland, followed by the number of glands and number of piglets tested (n). Average basal secretion rates were <1 in all genotypes (30-60 glands, n=3-5) . Mucus secretion rates for glands stimulated with 3 \u00b5M forskolin (Fsk), were WT: 73.7 \u00b1 38.2; 38 glands, n=3, HZ: 68.0 \u00b1 22.1; 46 glands, n=4, and CF: 1.3 \u00b1 1.6; 30 glands, n=3. To assess the effect of CF mutations on synergistic gland secretion, we combined 100 nM carbachol (Carb), which alone induced no mucus secretion, with 3 \u00b5M Fsk. The combined treatment potentiated secretion rates in all genotypes: WT: 168.0 \u00b1 29.7; 22 glands n=2, HZ: 230.0 \u00b1 91.9; 34 glands, n=3, and CF: 36.0 \u00b1 22.2; 30 glands, n=3. Substance-P (Subs-P) is a potent stimulus of gland secretion in pigs (Trout et al. Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 2001; 281:639) . Secretion rates to 1 \u00b5M Subs-P were WT: 212.5 \u00b1 16.3; 22 glands, n=2, HZ: 215.0 \u00b1 140; 14 glands, n=2, and CF: 52.7 \u00b1 28; 24 glands, n=3. A high concentration of Carb (1 \u00b5M) strongly stimulated gland secretion: WT: 1895.5 \u00b1 1637; 10 glands, n=2, HZ: 815 \u00b1 345.8; 10 glands, n=2, and CF: 254 \u00b1 116.3; 12 glands, n=3. The results demonstrate that mucus secretion from CF submucosal glands of piglets is greatly reduced in response to all agonists tested (forskolin, forskolin + low dose carbachol, Substance P, high dose carbachol) compared with secretion from WT and HZ controls of the similar age (CF piglets were 1 day old, WT: 3.1 \u00b1 1.2, and HZ: 3.5 \u00b1 1.7 days old). As a percent of the combined WT and HZ data, CF responses to each of the mediators were as follows: Fsk: ~2%, Fsk + low Carb: ~18%, Substance P: ~25% and high dose carbachol: ~19%. Our results from CF piglets suggest that CFTR plays a role in mucus secretion from pig airway glands that is similar in importance to its role in human airway glands. Because the CF piglets were tested within one day of birth, these differences predate infection. If CF pigs develop lung infections, the results will be consistent with the interpretation that defects in anion-mediated fluid secretion are part of the causal pathway leading to CF lung disease.",

Cystic Fibrosis Center, Univ. of North Carolina Hospitals, Chapel Hill, NC, USA Background: In cystic fibrosis (CF), dysregulated ion transport is postulated to cause dehydration of the airway surface liquid (ASL) layer. ASL dehydration may cause impaired mucociliary clearance, thus predisposing to chronic endobronchial infections and an intense inflammatory response. We hypothesized that ASL dehydration represents the initiating event in CF airways disease; therefore, should be demonstrable early in life with appropriate measurement techniques. To test this, we assessed the status of ASL (percent solids) across a spectrum of CF and other diseases, extending into early childhood.",

Another group of subjects 5-12 years of age were recruited for induced sputum during a baseline period. A novel method using a stationary cytology brush placed against the lateral wall of a mainstem bronchus during bronchoscopy was used to collect mucus that was transported via mucociliary clearance onto the brush over 3 minutes. The endobronchial brush (EB) samples were serially weighed with an ultramicrobalance over a 2 minute period to extrapolate a \"time=0\" wet weight. The brush was then dried overnight at 80\u221eC and re-weighed to determine a dry weight. Vigorous cleaning of the brush (in 6 M guanidine, using sonication) and redrying allowed subtraction of the \"clean brush weight\" so that percent (%) solids could be calculated. Induced sputum (IS) samples were analyzed using an established pre-post desiccation weight/gravimetric method to determine % solids.",

Evidence for ASL dehydration was seen in the youngest subjects enrolled (<3 years of age), supporting the hypothesis that this is an early pathogenic event. For comparison, identical IS procedures in stable adults with CF (n=9) (unpublished data) revealed similar levels of dehydration (4.98+/-1.52%) whereas healthy adult volunteers (n=29) yielded lower % solids (1.93+/-2.05%). Also, adults with mild-moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had less-pronounced ASL dehydration (2.8%+/-1.12%). Further studies are underway that will elucidate the nature of mucus constituents (i.e. mucin concentration, cell counts) and levels of potential regulators of hydration (i.e. nucleotides, cytokines).",

Previous work from our laboratory has implicated the EP 4 . prostanoid receptor as playing an essential role in CFTR-mediated transepithelial anion secretion across, and anion efflux from, the human airway epithelial cell line, Calu-3 in response to the isoprostane molecule 8-iso-PGE 2 . Isoprostanes are produced when oxygen-centred free radicals react with membrane bound polyunsaturated fatty acids and their levels are elevated in exhaled breath condensates from CF patients, indicating they may be important mediators of oxidant stress in the airways. Recently, levels of PGE 2 measured in exhaled breath condensates were also found to be significantly higher in CF patients compared to controls (Lucidi et al. Free Radic Biol Med 2008; 45:913-9) . In order to more thoroughly understand the physiological role of the EP 4 receptor in airway epithelial cells, we investigated the signalling pathways and downstream events initiated by activation of this receptor. Treatment with either the isoprostane 8-iso-PGE 2 (1 \u00b5M or 3 \u00b5M) or the EP 4 receptor selective agonist PGE1-OH (1 \u00b5M or 3 \u00b5M) resulted in the phosphorylation of two major ERK pathway proteins, MEK1/2 and p44/42MAPK in the cytoplasm, whereas there was no detectable change in phosphorylation status of c-Raf, p90RSK or Elk1. We additionally investigated whether these agonists induced activation of the transcriptional factor early growth response (Egr-1), which regulates downstream target gene expression via binding to an Egr nuclear response element. Using Western blotting, we determined that neither agonist (at 1 \u00b5M) induced transient induction of early growth response Egr-1 protein. However, PGE1-OH at 3 \u00b5M showed a significant increase of Egr-1 protein expression, detectable in the nuclear fraction as soon as 30 min post-treatment. This increase of Egr-1 protein expression was abolished in the presence of the EP 4 receptor antagonist AH23848, confirming it is an EP 4 receptor mediated event. In addition, we investigated whether EP 4 receptor activation ultimately resulted in the additional production of PGE 2 , which could potentially act either in a positive-feedback way via the EP 4 receptor, or alternately, act at other EP prostanoid receptor subtypes in either an autocrine or paracrine manner. Using misoprostol (which stimulates EP 2 , EP 3 and EP 4 receptors) as our agonist (at 1 \u00b5M for 24 hours), we determined that treatment of Calu-3 cells was associated with an increased production of PGE 2 as measured by ELISA.",

            "text": "Conclusions: These results suggest that basal MCC from the large and small airways of this group of 7-12 yr old children with CF and normal pulmonary function is similar to that of healthy, adult controls and is not yet impaired. However, basal MCC in male children in this group appears to be lower than female children. More than half of the children showed improvement in MCC after treatment with HS. The clinical impact of improvement in MCC with HS in these children is unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of CFTR in airway epithelial cell migration using Calu-3 and normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells. Migration was assessed by measuring changes in impedance (Z) at the membrane-substrate interface as cells migrated onto the surface of an electrode to close a wound in the epithelium. Inhibition of CFTR activity with CFTR inh -172 slowed the rate of wound closure (time to reestablish initial Z) of Calu-3 cells (30 \u00b5M) by 6.2 hours compared to control cells (serum free media, 1\u00b5g/ml EGF), and of NHBE cells (20 \u00b5M) by 10.0 hours compared to control cells (serum free media). A CFTR specific effect on migration was verified in Calu-3 cells by constitutive expression of a CFTR specific shRNA which reduced CFTR mRNA expression by >99%. Silencing CFTR in Calu-3 cells delayed wound closure by 9.8 hours compared to wild type Calu-3 cells and cells expressing a non-specific shRNA. Silencing or inhibition of CFTR in Calu-3 cells reduced the area of lamellipodia projected from the leading edge of wounds by >2-fold, and CFTR inhibition in NHBE cells reduced this area by 2.6-fold. Replacement of Clions with in the media during Calu-3 cell migration had no effect on cell migration rate. However, reduction of [HCO 3 -] from 26 mM to 5 mM in HEPES buffered CO 2 gassed media slowed the rate of Calu-3 cell migration by 3.7 hours, in the absence of a change in intracellular pH. The results of these experiments indicate that functional activity of CFTR is involved in Calu-3 and NHBE cell migration and suggest a role for CFTR in airway epithelial restitution. Further, these results suggest that CFTR participates in HCO 3 transport which appears to be necessary for efficient cell migration.",

            "text": "Dysregulation of ion transport in lung epithelial cells is of critical importance in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Recent in vitro work has demonstrated that stimulation of the beta-2 adrenergic receptors (ADRB2) results in stabilization of chloride channels and restoration of secretory capacity in glandular serous cells that is dependent on CFTR. In addition, ADRB2 stimulation results in an increase in the number of epithelial Na + channels on type-I alveolar cells and increased transfer of Na + into the cells. Pursuant to planned studies in CF, we sought to determine the influence of an inhaled \u03b2-agonist on exhaled breath condensate (EBC) volume and Na + , K + , and Clin healthy subjects (n=13, age=28\u00b19years, ht=178\u00b110cm, wt=73\u00b114kg, BMI=23\u00b15kg/m 2 , VO2Peak=105\u00b128%predicted, FVC=94\u00b110%predicted, FEV1=95\u00b115%predicted, mean\u00b1SD). To determine this, we collected EBC (for Na + , K + , and Cl -) for 25 minutes, along with serum Na + , K + and Cl -, before and 30, 60, and 90 minutes following the administration of a \u03b2-agonist (nebulized albuterol sulfate, 2.5mg diluted in 3ml of normal saline). The administration of a \u03b2-agonist resulted in a small decrease in serum K + and Clthat was significant (p<0.05) at 60min following albuterol administration but there was no change observed in serum Na + (Na + =139\u00b11 and 139\u00b11mmol/l, K + =4.1\u00b10.5 and 3.9\u00b10.4mmol/l, Cl -=105.5\u00b11.5 and 104\u00b12mmol/l for baseline and 60min following albuterol). The volume of EBC collected was reduced with albuterol and became significant (p<0.05) after 60min (4.0\u00b10.6, 3.8\u00b10.6, 3.7\u00b10.5, and 3.7\u00b14ml, for baseline, 30, 60 , and 90min post \u03b2-agonist). Exhaled Na + was lower following the \u03b2-agonist, whereas Clvalues increased, but there was no significant change in exhaled K + (Na + =3.4\u00b11.9, 2.2\u00b10.6, 2.3\u00b10.7, and 2.4\u00b11.3mmol/l; K + =0.028\u00b10.02, 0.029\u00b10.02, 0.022\u00b10.01, and 0.021\u00b10.01mmol/l; Cl -=69\u00b141, 84\u00b154, 96\u00b136, and 70\u00b127\u00b5mol/l, for baseline, 30, 60, and 90min post, p<0.05 for Na + and Cl -). These results demonstrate that administration of an inhaled \u03b2-agonist results in a decrease in exhaled Na + and in the volume of EBC along with an increase in exhaled Cl -. These findings confirm previous in vitro studies that have demonstrated ADRB2 stimulation enhances Clefflux and Na + influx from the airspace of the lungs and highlight the future importance of similar studies in patients with CF. In cystic fibrosis (CF) lungs salt and water transport of airway bronchial epithelium is impaired resulting in mucus adhesion and chronic bacterial colonization. We analyzed the influence of the cyclic AMP (cAMP), GlyH-101 and the potentiator UCCF-853 on paracellular fluorescein permeability of model bronchial epithelium 16HBE14o-and CFBE41o-. In 16HBE14o-cAMP produced a decrease of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) by 50% and strong increase of paracellular permeability of the marker molecule fluorescein. The \u2206F508-CFTR expressing CFBE41o-cells show under control conditions paracellular permeabilities similar to those of 16HBE14o-. Exposure of CFBE41o-cells to cAMP increased TER slightly without influencing the permeability of the paracellular pathway. Interestingly, the CFTR specific blocker GlyH-101 was without influence on the cAMP induced changes in paracellular permeability of 16HBE14o-cell layers. Also the CFTR potentiator UCCF-853 did not change the fluorescein flux of 16HBE14o-cells under control and stimulated conditions. However, UCCF-853 caused a significant increase of paracellular permeability in CFBE41o-cell layers upon cAMP stimulation. Temperature rescuing (27\u221eC for 48h) changes the situation completely. Now cAMP is able to increase the paracellular fluorescein flux in CFBE41o-cell layers considerably. This augmentation of fluorescein permeability is further increased by UCCF-853. After temperature rescuing the changes of paracellular permeabilities upon cAMP and UCCF-853 were comparable in CFBE41o-and 16HBE14o-cells. Of note, there was also no effect of GlyH-101 on the fluorescein flux in these temperature-rescued cell lines. It is worth mentioning that we observed no difference between basolateral to apical and apical to basolateral fluorescein flux.",

Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) is a key enzyme controlling the release of arachidonic acid (AA) from membrane phospholipids. Conversion of AA by cyclooxygenases (COX) and lipoxygenases (LOX) generates prostaglandins and leukotrienes, respectively. We have previously observed that cPLA2 is involved in the mucus overproduction and mucin MUC5AC expression in CF mice. Our aim is to identify AA metabolites and signalling pathways involved in MUC5AC expression in the bronchial epithelial cell line NCI-H292. Measurements of MUC5AC expression by ELISA and qRT-PCR showed that PMA-induced MUC5AC production was mimicked by AA and inhibited by cPLA2 inhibitors. MUC5AC expression was inhibited by a general LOX inhibitor (nordihydroguaiaretic acid or NDGA) but not by COX inhibitors (aspirin, NS398). Inhibitors of 12-LOX (cinnamyl-3,4-dihydroxy-alpha-cyanocinnamate or CDC and baicalein), but not those of 5-LOX or 15-LOX, reduced MUC5AC expression. These inhibitors did not reduce IL-8 secretion. In agreement, 12-HETE, the first AA metabolite by 12-LOX, stimulated MUC5AC production. Baicalein reduced ERK activation and SP-1 translocation induced by PMA. In addition, 12-HETE activated ERK and SP-1 translocation. Both 12-R-LOX and 12-S-LOX forms are expressed in NCI-H292. Using siRNA targeting 12-R-LOX or 12-S-LOX we showed that 12-R-LOX rather than 12-S-LOX is involved in PMAinduced MUC5AC secretion. Our data suggest that 12-R-LOX pathway is involved in MUC5AC production via ERK and SP-1-dependent mechanisms. Potential therapeutic approaches targeting 12-LOX would be of great interest in the treatment of mucus overproduction in chronic lung diseases such us CF.",

Although the activity of store operated TRPC1 Ca 2+ channels was similar in these cells, the application of the membrane permeant diacylglycerol analog, oleyl-acetyl glycerol (OAG) activated TRPC6-mediated Ca 2+ influx that was abnormally increased in CF (F508del/F508del) compared to non-CF cells. After correction of abnormal F508del-CFTR trafficking in CF cells, the level of OAG-dependent and TRPC6 mediated-Ca 2+ influx was also normalized. In CF cells, siRNA knockdown of endogenous TRPC6, but not TRPC1, reduced the abnormal OAG-dependent-Ca 2+ influx. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed TRPC6/CFTR and TRPC6/F508delCFTR interactions in CF or non-CF epithelial cells. By contrast, we found no evidence for TRPC1/TRPC6, TRPC1/CFTR or TRPC1/F508delCFTR interactions. These data indicate that TRPC6 and CFTR are functionally coupled within a molecular complex and that CFTR down-regulates TRPC6 activity in non-CF airway epithelial cells. On the contrary, because this functional coupling is lost in CF cells, the OAGdependent-Ca 2+ influx is abnormal. In conclusion, we identified TRPC6 as the channel responsible for Ca 2+ influx in human CF cells linking in airway epithelial cells, the calcium signalling to CFTR pathobiology.",

Physiology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA Submucosal glands secrete a significant amount of the fluid and mucus that line cartilaginous airways, facilitating mucociliary clearance and likely playing a role in airway diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF). Previous studies of intact glands have yielded insights into the regulation, volume, and composition of their secretions, but the contributions of the various glandular cell types (serous, mucous, collecting duct) remain poorly defined. The serous acinar cells, thought to be the primary source of secreted fluid, are major sites of CFTR expression in the lung. We previously developed optical methods to study fluid secretion in primary serous cells isolated from murine nasal glands. However, data has emerged suggesting that fundamental differences exist between murine and human glands, particularly concerning CFTR-dependent secretion. We have thus begun examining serous cell secretion in the pig, an animal model more similar to humans in terms of airway gland distribution and physiology. Intact submucosal glands were dissected from adult WT porcine bronchi and enzymatically digested. Serous acinar cells were identified based on visible morphology, immunocytochemistry, and gene expression profiling. Cells were studied using DIC imaging of cell volume to track agonist-induced changes in cell solute content in combination with simultaneous fluorescence microscopy of indicator dyes to track changes in the concentrations of ions involved in driving fluid secretion (Cl -) and regulating it (Ca 2+ ). Stimulation of serous cells with 10 \u00b5M carbachol (CCh; a cholinergic agonist) was associated with a profound elevation of intracellular [Ca 2+ ] ([Ca 2+ ] i ) from 50\u00b16 nM at rest to a peak of 365\u00b138 nM within 68\u00b111 sec (n=10), accompanied by rapid cell shrinkage of 24\u00b12 % within 39\u00b115 sec after the onset of the [Ca 2+ ] i response. Elevation of [Ca 2+ ] i was found to be both necessary and sufficient to activate cell shrinkage. Upon return of [Ca 2+ ] i to resting levels, cells swelled back to resting volume (time to 50% volume recovery 150\u00b128 sec; n=5). Agonist induced volume changes were associated with changes in [Cl -] i , suggesting that shrinkage and swelling are indicative of solute efflux and influx, respectively. The rate of CCh/Ca 2+ -evoked shrinkage/Clefflux was inhibited by the Ca 2+ -activated Clchannel inhibitor niflumic acid (50 \u00b5M), while the CFTR inhibitor GlyH-101 (10 \u00b5M) had no discernable effect, suggesting that Ca 2+ -evoked serous cell secretion is primarily CFTR-independent, as previously observed in murine cells. Cell swelling upon return of [Ca 2+ ] i to resting levels was inhibited by both the Na + K + 2Clcotransporter (NKCC) inhibitor bumetanide (100 \u00b5M) and the Na + H + exchanger (NHE) inhibitor dimethylamiloride (30 \u00b5M; times to 50% volume recovery were 640\u00b1145 sec [n=7] and 500\u00b185 sec [n=5], respectively). Thus, both NKCC activity and paired NHE and Cl -/HCO 3 exchanger activity likely accumulate cell solute content to sustain transepithelial secretion. Together, these data suggest that agonist-induced volume changes reflect changes in the secretory state of porcine bronchial serous cells, and that cell volume imaging will be useful for identifying mechanisms involved in serous cell fluid secretion.",

            "text": "The serous acini of airway submucosal glands are thought to be the origin of the majority of the fluid secreted by these glands. Serous cells are sites of CFTR expression in the lung, and thus they may be critical to CF pathology. Fluid secretion is significantly reduced in intact airway glands from CF patients stimulated with the physiological secretagogue vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) or the adenylyl cyclase-activating compound forskolin, both of which are thought to signal through cAMP production leading to downstream activation of CFTR via PKA phosphorylation. We isolated serous acinar cells from adult WT porcine bronchi to (1) directly examine if these cells secrete fluid in response to VIP, (2) determine whether or not CFTR functions as a secretory Clchannel in these cells, and (3) identify other ion channels and transporters involved in serous cell secretion. Serous cells were studied using DIC imaging of cell volume to track changes in cell solute content along with simultaneous fluorescence microscopy of either fura-2 or SPQ to measure changes in intracellular ] i responses elicited by CCh (100nM and 1\u00b5M), suggesting cross-talk exists between cAMP and Ca 2+ signaling pathways in these cells. By measuring simultaneous changes in cell volume and SPQ fluorescence, cell volume changes during VIP stimulation were found to be associated with changes in [Cl -] i , suggesting that VIP-stimulated cell shrinkage reflects Clefflux as observed for CCh-stimulated shrinkage. The rate of VIP/forskolin-stimulated shrinkage/Clefflux was significantly inhibited by the CFTR-inhibitor GlyH-101 (10\u00b5M), while the Ca 2+ -activated Clchannel inhibitor niflumic acid (50\u00b5M, which slows the rate of CCh-stimulated shrinkage) had no effect. These data suggest that VIP-evoked Clefflux occurs at least partly through CFTR. Whole cell patch clamping is currently being used to examine/characterize both cAMP-and Ca 2+ -activated Cland K + conductances. The combination of optical and electrophysiological techniques will allow us to directly determine if VIP stimulation activates CFTR and whether or not the observed Ca 2+ signals are required for K + channel activation to mediate counter-ion current required for Clsecretion. Prior investigations suggest that, in contrast to the nasal mucosa, CFTR plays a minor role in murine tracheal epithelium. However, the activity of CFTR has not been examined in native distal airways, where the pathophysiology of human cystic fibrosis occurs. We sought to define CFTR-mediated chloride conductance in lower murine airway epithelium using a novel ex vivo microperfusion assay. Our hypothesis is that CFTR contributes a small chloride conductance in this tissue, similar to the trachea.",

            "text": "Discussion: We present an ex vivo microperfusion assay of the intact murine lung, developed to better replicate the native environment of the distal airways. Our data demonstrate small but significant CFTR activity in the distal airways of both wild type and CF mice. The reproducible response to IBMX with forskolin and CFTR inh -172, and its diminished effect in the \u2206F508 mouse, suggest that this is a CFTR-mediated chloride conductance. These findings support those seen in murine tracheal epithelium, which exhibits predominantly calcium-activated chloride conductance with a seemingly decreased dependence on CFTR. The greater amiloride-induced depolarization generated in the CF mouse suggests augmented epithelial sodium channel activity or possibly lower, but undetected, CF airway chloride conductance. As the CF mouse does not exhibit airway pathology, it is unclear whether this plays a role in vivo. The apparent residual CFTR activity of the \u2206F508 distal airways suggests persistent, albeit attenuated, expression, the role of which awaits further exploration. Recent studies have identified alterations in cholesterol processing associated with cystic fibrosis (CF). Some studies suggest that cholesterol processing alterations in CF are the result of deltaF508 CFTR trafficking deficiencies resulting in disrupted lipid trafficking. Previous observations demonstrate that Cftr-null cells and tissues exhibit an increase in plasma membrane cholesterol content and an increase in de novo cholesterol synthesis compared to wild type controls arguing against the role of deltaF508 CFTR trafficking as an initiating source of cholesterol accumulation. The hypothesis of this study is that these CF-related alterations in cholesterol processing will be influenced by Cftr genotype, but not dependent on the deltaF508 mutation. De novo cholesterol synthesis was assayed in mice homozygous for either the R117H (R/R) or the deltaF508 (F/F) CFTR mutations. Results reveal a 1.6 \u00b1 0.2 fold (p < 0.01) increase in % new cholesterol synthesis in the lung of F/F mouse lung compared to controls and a 1.6 \u00b1 0.3 fold (p = 0.04) increase in the liver. Similar results were found in the R/R mouse with a 1.2 \u00b1 0.1 fold (p = 0.04) and 1.7 \u00b1 0.2 fold (p = 0.008) increase respectively in the lung and liver. Membrane cholesterol content is determined by electrochemical detection and de novo synthesis is monitored by assessing deuterium-labeled water incorporation into cholesterol over an eight-hour period. In order to determine if membrane cholesterol content correlated with Cftr genotype, membrane cholesterol content was measured in nasal epithelium isolated from R/R and F/F mice. Membrane cholesterol content as measured by response ratio is elevated in both R/R and F/F nasal epithelium (1.64 +/-0.09 (R/R), p < 0.001; 2.14 +/-0.10 (F/F), p = 0.01) compared to age-matched sibling wt controls. These data demonstrate that either a mild or severe disease-related CFTR mutation will result in an increase in membrane cholesterol, with a larger magnitude increase in the F/F tissue. The magnitude increase in membrane cholesterol content in F/F mouse nasal tissue is identical to what is observed in Cftr -/-nasal tissue. The next goal was to determine if there is a CFTR dose effect with Cftr +/mice. Cftr +/-nasal epithelium exhibits a relatively slight, but significant loss of membrane cholesterol (0.87 +/-0.04 fold compared to wt, p < 0.01). These data suggest that CFTR function impacts cholesterol movement to the plasma membrane. To test this hypothesis directly, 9/HTEo-cells were treated with CFTRinh-172 and membrane cholesterol assayed. Contrary to cellular and in vivo CF models, acute CFTR inhibition resulted in a dramatic reduction in membrane cholesterol content. This finding suggested that increased membrane cholesterol content in CF is actually a secondary response. This study demonstrates that alterations in cholesterol synthesis and membrane cholesterol content are not dependent on deltaF508 CFTR trafficking disruptions and that secondary responses may be likely for increases in membrane cholesterol content in response to lost CFTR function. Results also suggest that membrane cholesterol content of nasal epithelium could prove to be an effective biomarker for CFTR correction.",

Although widely used as a model for airway mucus secretion, no previous single-gland studies have been reported for fluid secretion from ferret glands. Therefore, we have carried out such studies in the hope that they can provide normative, parametric data to help inform studies of gland secretion in CF ferrets. We used in situ optical monitoring to measure individual airway gland secretion rates in isolated tracheal segments with intact cartilage from ferrets, aged 80 \u00b1 4 days. All tracheas were obtained after acute experiments for other purposes. Secretion rates are expressed as picoliters/min/gland, followed by the number of glands and number of ferrets tested. Gland density based on actively secreting duct openings was 2-3 per mm 2 . Average basal secretion rates were < 3 (256 glands, n=13). Carbachol (1 \u00b5M) increased secretion rates to 1027.8 \u00b1 309.8 averaged over the first 10 min (53, n=5) with early peak responses. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP, 1 \u00b5M) and forskolin (10 \u00b5M, Fsk), which elevate cAMP, each produced sustained secretion of 186.7 \u00b1 63.0 (57 glands, n=6) and 243. 3 \u00b1 55.8 (34 glands, n=3) . The secretion pattern lacked the early peak seen with carbachol and required at least 30 min to reach a maximum rate that was then sustained. Ferret glands responded to Fsk (10 \u00b5M) with secretion rates that were 23.3 % of the secretion rates to 1 \u00b5M carbachol. The \u03b1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine is a weak agonist for gland secretion in humans, sheep and pigs, but a strong agonist in cats (Joo et al. Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 2001; 281:458) . Ferrets responded like cats, with 10 \u00b5M phenylephrine producing a rate and pattern of secretion similar to that seen for carbachol. The overall and sustained secretion rates were 1655.4 \u00b1 389.1 (62 glands, n=6) and 1721.3 \u00b1 400.8 (59 glands, n=6); values slightly higher (118%) than those obtained for carbachol. Except for responsiveness to phenylephrine, ferret glands appear similar to human glands in their responses to mediators. It will be of great interest to determine how these responses are affected in CFTR -/-ferrets.",

To investigate a potential role of CFTR in submucosal gland secretion of the CF piglet nasal turbinate, we used in situ optical monitoring to measure individual airway gland secretion rates in isolated nasal turbinate mucosa from WT and CF (\u2206F508/null and null/null) piglets less than 3 weeks old. Secretion rates are expressed as picoliters/min/gland, followed by the number of glands and number of piglets tested (n). Average basal secretion rates were <5 in both genotypes (73 glands, n=7). Mucus secretion rates for glands stimulated with 3 \u00b5M forskolin (Fsk), were WT: 15.5 \u00b1 3.9; 46 glands, n=4, and CF: 5.9 \u00b1 1.8; 27 glands, n=3. To evaluate the consequence of CF mutations on synergistic gland secretion, we combined 100 nM carbachol with 3 \u00b5M Fsk. The secretion rates to combined treatment were: WT: 41.9 \u00b1 9.9; 37 glands n=3, and CF: 29.3 \u00b1 10.7; 27 glands, n=3. Unlike tracheal glands, the glands in the turbinates also responded to 100 nM carbachol alone (WT: 271.7 \u00b1 53.5; 9 glands n=1, and CF: 32.3 \u00b1 6.8; 7 glands, n=1). We tested the effects of Substance-P (Subs-P) on nasal glands because it is a potent agonist of airway gland secretion in pigs (Trout et al. Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 2001; 281:639) . Secretion rates to 1 \u00b5M Subs-P were small and inconsistent (<12) in both genotypes (46 gland, n=5), unlike the strong responses of piglet tracheal glands (see our companion abstract, Joo et al.). A high concentration of carbachol (1 \u00b5M) strongly stimulated gland secretion: WT: 188.9 \u00b1 39.3; 31 glands, n=3, and CF: 64.8 \u00b1 12.5; 26 glands, n=3. As a percent of WT, CF responses to each of the mediators were as follows: Fsk: 38%, Fsk + low Carb: 69%, and high dose carbachol: 34%. The reduced gland secretion in CF piglet turbinate glands to all agonists was apparent even though the CF piglets were older, on average, than the WT piglets (CF: 10.4 \u00b1 7.3 vs. WT: 2.9 \u00b1 1.7 days old). Compared with tracheal/bronchial glands, gland secretion in nasal turbinates from both WT and CF piglets differed in having a lower sensitivity to Subs-P and a higher sensitivity to carbachol. Nasal turbinates have a higher gland density than trachea, while gland sizes appear to be much smaller (~10%), based on secretion rates of maximally stimulated glands. Consistent with tracheal airway glands, nasal glands of CF piglets show mucus hyposecretion. These results from piglet nasal turbinates and tracheal/bronchial airways (Joo et al. companion abstract) suggest that CFTR plays an important role in gland mucus secretion throughout the upper airways.",

Prior to the development of synchrotron phase contrast X-ray imaging (PCXI), non-invasive detection and tracking of individual particle movements produced by mucociliary transit (MCT) was not possible. Since MCT is affected in cystic fibrosis (CF), the ability to quantify MCT in CF disease models could assist in examining airway surface dysfunction and responses to treatment. Using PCXI we have dynamically and non-invasively examined the behaviour of individual pollutant particles deposited on the airway surfaces of live intact mice to determine the most suitable particles for transit analysis, and to document particle visibility and behaviour.",

            "text": "Conclusion: PCXI permits detection of particle transit via MCT along live mouse nasal and tracheal airways. The majority of particles deposited in the trachea appeared to immobilise soon after deposition, presumably via trapping on surface mucus/fluid. The tendency for particles to localise along the dorsal wall is consistent with known tracheal MCT patterns. The most visible particles were the hollow glass beads, which could be resolved to less than 10 um. We are continuing with studies to improve our direct and noninvasive MCT assessment methods to assist our understanding and treatment of respiratory diseases such as CF. Chloride secretion by airway epithelial cells is defective in cystic fibrosis (CF). The conventional paradigm is that the CF transmembrane conductance regulator chloride channel (CFTR) is activated through cAMP / protein kinase A (PKA), whereas the Ca 2+ -activated chloride channel (CaCC) is activated by Ca 2+ agonists such as UTP. We report evidence for major crosstalk between Ca 2+ and cAMP signaling in well-differentiated primary cultures of human airway epithelial cells, such that the majority of chloride current elicited by Ca 2+ agonists such as UTP involves Ca 2+ /calmodulininduced activation of adenylyl cyclase I (AC1) with consequent cAMP / PKA signaling. By short-circuit current analysis, Ca 2+ agonists such as UTP, carbachol and ionomycin produced more chloride secretion from CFTR than CaCC, as judged by effects of CFTR and CaCC-selective inhibitors. The CFTR component of chloride secretion was reduced by PKA inhibition, but not by inhibition of PKC or EGFR, and was absent in cell cultures from CF patients. Calcium agonists produced cAMP elevation, which was blocked by inhibition of adenylyl cyclase or calmodulin. We found expression of AC1, a Ca 2+ /calmodulin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase, in human airway epithelial cells and found that selective RNAi knockdown of AC1 abolished almost completely both the cAMP elevation and chloride secretion following Ca 2+ agonists. Immunostaining showed AC1 expression at the apical membrane of cultured airway epithelial cells. Taken together with correlations between cAMP levels and chloride currents, as well as immunoprecipitation studies, we suggest compartmentalized coupling of AC1 and CFTR. Our results provide evidence for major Ca 2+ /cAMP cross-talk in human bronchial epithelial cells involving AC1, and indicate CFTR as the principal chloride secretory pathway in non-CF airways for both cAMP and Ca 2+ agonists.",

Levels of inflammatory mediators in sputum from patients with CF might further impair the already defective chloride secretion in the CF airway, promoting further mucociliary dysfunction, infection and inflammation. Inhaled hypertonic saline (HS) appears broadly applicable as an inexpensive therapy for most patients with CF, mildly improving lung function, quality of life and absenteeism and markedly reducing pulmonary exacerbations, without promoting infection or inflammation. Some studies recorded intolerance of regular HS due to sustained cough, presence of new wheeze or rales on the exam and saltiness ranging from 3% to 10% of patients in regular regimen with HS, despite a pretreatment with bronchodilator. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a naturally occurring polysaccharide, which can be found in numerous tissues and body fluids.

            "text": "Supported by \"Vaincre la mucoviscidose\" and FNRS. Airway submucosal glands secrete mucus (fluid + macromolecules) in response to various neurotransmitters and mediators such as histamine, which is released mainly by mast cells but also by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Devalia et al. J Clin Pathol 1989; 42:516) and sometimes by neutrophils (Xu et al. J Exp Med 2006; 203:2907) . Thus, high levels of bacteria and neutrophils in infected CF airways might produce significant levels of histamine in addition to the mast cell source. We studied the effects of histamine on mucus secretion from control and CF human airway glands obtained at lung transplantation. Secretion rates from individual glands were measured using optical imaging (Joo et al. Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 2001; 281:458) . The average responses over a 15-20 min period to 100 \u00b5m histamine applied basally were as follows (in nanoliters/gland/min, followed by n of subjects and n glands): control (donor) tracheas: 0.41 \u00b1 0.21, n=9, 67 glands; non-CF disease controls: 0.24 \u00b1 0.07, n=6, 37 glands; and CF: 0.02 \u00b1 0.02, n=2, 18 glands. Each experimental tissue was subsequently tested with 10 \u00b5M carbachol and the response to histamine was expressed as a percent of the carbachol response in that tissue. The average histamine/carbachol ratios were: donor control: 25 \u00b1 6%, n=9; non-CF diseases: 15 \u00b1 4 n=6, and CF: 0.004 %, n=2; (CF vs. controls p <0.05); the average carbachol responses of the three groups did not differ. The loss of secretion by CF glands suggests that histamine requires CFTR to produce gland mucus secretion. Histamine elevates intracellular [Ca 2+ ] i in gland cells (Lee et al. J Physiol 2007; 582:1099) , and can potentially activate Ca +2 activated Clchannels, yet the near absence of a response in CF cells suggests that unlike carbachol, but like the [Ca 2+ ] i elevating agent Substance P, it does not do so (Choi et al. J Clin Invest 2009; 119:1189) . As a further test of the CFTR-dependence of histamine-induced gland secretion, we tested a subset of donors to determine the interaction between forskolin (known to stimulate glands in a CFTR-dependent manner (Joo et al. J biol Chem 2002; 277:50710) ) and histamine; we again normalized responses to carbachol responses to control for tissue/gland variability. After a saturating (10 \u00b5M) dose of forskolin, histamine failed to produce any increase in secretion rates: forskolin normalized rate was 0.37 \u00b1 0.08; and for 100 \u00b5M histamine added on top of forskolin the normalized rate was 0.30 \u00b1 0.08 (n.s.). Lack of additivity between histamine and forskolin further supports a common path through CFTR. Lack of histamine-induced fluid secretion from CF airway glands may contribute to decreased mucus clearance in CF airways. Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by the thick aggregated mucus that affects every mucus-producing organ in the body. Consequently women with CF have a tenacious cervical mucus that retains its viscosity throughout the menstrual cycle. As well as a loss of Clconductance, mutant CFTR channels fail to support bicarbonate (HCO 3 -) transport. We have previously reported that mucus release in the female reproductive tract is critically dependent on HCO 3 -. In the absence of extracellular HCO 3 and in the presence of CFTR inhibitors, mucus release was undetectable [1] . These findings support the recently proposed mucus and HCO 3 hypothesis [2] where HCO 3 may play a critical role in unshielding mucin molecules released into the lumen. In the present study we show cervical mucus release is impaired in \u2206F508 mice, whereas fluid secretion is preserved under the same conditions. Methods: \u2206F508 mice originated from Case Western Reserve University. The reproductive tracts from wild type (wt) and \u2206F508 mice were excised and mounted in a custom-built constant temperature perfusion chamber. Mucus collection: The lumen was perfused with a glucose free Ringer and bathed basolaterally with a HCO 3 or HCO 3 --free Ringer. Mucus content was determined by binding of wheat germ agglutinin lectin to samples. Fluid secretion measurements: One of the uterine horns was cannulated with a fire polished glass capillary. The vaginal end of the tissue was then ligated to form a closed, cannulated sac isolated from the external solution. After equilibrating, fluid secreted into the lumen displaced fluid into the capillary. The rate of fluid secretion was measured under a microscope by monitoring the displacement of the air/liquid meniscus in the capillary.",

PGE 2 + carbachol stimulated fluid secretion was partially preserved in \u2206F508 mice (43.2 \u00b1 19 \u00b5l. min -1 .g -1 ; HCO 3 -Ringer). Conversely PGE 2 + carbachol stimulated mucus release was severely impaired in the \u2206F508 mice (119 \u00b1 62 % increase; HCO 3 -Ringer) compared to wild type mice (650 \u00b1 77 % increase; HCO 3 -Ringer). Conclusions: Defective cAMP-mediated fluid secretion is a characteristic of all exocrine systems affected in CF, suggesting abnormal mucus in CF may be simply due to impaired fluid secretion. We show that PGE 2 + carbachol stimulated mucus release, which is CFTR and HCO 3 dependent, is impaired in the \u2206F508 reproductive tract, whereas fluid secretion is partially preserved under similar conditions. Our findings suggest that rather than a simple loss of fluid secretion, the loss of CFTR dependent HCO 3 secretion is an important factor contributing to depressed mucus release. The bronchial airways of the lung have the potential to both secrete and absorb liquid. Liquid absorption occurs across the surface epithelium of the bronchi, whereas liquid secretion occurs from both the submucosal glands and the surface epithelium. Previous studies documented that the net liquid secretion induced by glandular secretagogues can be measured in cannulated bronchial airways excised from the lungs of domestic pigs. This technique has now been modified to permit measurements of both unidirectional liquid secretion and unidirectional liquid absorption across porcine bronchi. From each pig, three bronchial airways were dissected from the lungs, cannulated, and immersed in bicarbonate-buffered Krebs solution. Two airways were filled with a known volume of Krebs solution. One of these liquid-filled airways was used to measure net liquid transport. The other liquid-filled airway was pretreated with 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB) to block unidirectional anion and liquid secretion to obtain a measurement of unidirectional liquid absorption. Unidirectional secretion was calculated as the difference between the net change and the unidirectional absorption. A third airway remained air-filled for comparison. The airways were incubated for 2 h after which the rates of liquid secretion or absorption were calculated based on changes in luminal liquid volumes. These liquid transport responses were assessed under the control condition (no secretagogue) or when airways were treated with 10\u00b5M acetylcholine (ACh), 1\u00b5M substance P, or 100nM vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). Under the control condition, the bronchi exhibited unidirectional absorption of liquid (-4.25\u00b10 .62 \u00b5l\u1b79cm -2 \u1b79h -1 ) while unidirectional secretion was essentially absent. ACh, substance P, and VIP induced unidirectional secretion of +14.55\u00b11.37 \u00b5l\u1b79cm -2 \u1b79h -1 , +12.18\u00b11.36 \u00b5l\u1b79cm -2 \u1b79h -1 , and +4.42\u00b11.26 \u00b5l\u1b79cm -2 \u1b79h -1 , respectively, whereas unidirectional liquid absorption remained near control levels (-5.74\u00b10 .89 \u00b5l\u1b79cm -2 \u1b79h -1 , -4.37\u00b10.49 \u00b5l\u1b79cm -2 \u1b79h -1 , and -4.72\u00b10.81 \u00b5l\u1b79cm -2 \u1b79h -1 , respectively). Net liquid flux in the presence of the secretagogues was slightly higher (in the direction of secretion) in the air-filled bronchi than in the liquid-filled bronchi. These data demonstrate that both net and unidirectional liquid fluxes can be accurately measured in intact bronchial airways from pigs.",

Thrombin-promoted ATP release was associated with connexin/pannexin hemichannel opening (Seminario-Vidal et al. J Biol Chem 2009 May12 [Epub ahead of print] ). In the present study, we asked whether RhoA and connexin/pannexin hemichannels are involved in mechanically-induced ATP release from HBE cells. Hypotonic challenge promoted robust ATP release that was accompanied by activation of RhoA and enhanced phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC), a downstream effector of Rho kinase (ROCK) and MLC kinase (MLCK). Inhibition of ROCK and MLCK diminished hypotonicity-induced ATP release in primary HBE cells. Furthermore, hypotonicity-induced ATP release was drastically impaired in lung epithelial cells transfected with RhoAT19N (RhoA dominant negative mutant). These results suggest that activation of RhoA/ROCK and MLCK are necessary for ATP release in hypotonicity-stimulated HBE cells. Hypotonicity-stimulated ATP release was also decreased by non-selective connexin/pannexin hemichannel inhibitors. Confocal microscopy studies illustrated that hypotonic challenge elicited a rapid uptake of the hemichannel-permeable reporter dye propidium iodide. Hypotonicity-induced propidium iodide uptake kinetics was similar to that of ATP release and, like ATP release, it was inhibited by hemichannel blockers, ROCK inhibitors, and RhoAT19N. RT-PCR analysis of HBE cells revealed the expression of Panx1, Cx26, Cx30.3, Cx31, Cx31.1, and Cx43, but not Panx2, Panx3 or Cx32 in these cells. An initial screening indicated that Cx43 blocking peptide (i.e., Gap26) or 10Panx1blocking peptide (but not with their scrambled versions) reduced hypotonicity-induced ATP release from primary HBE cells. Taken together, our data suggest that connexin/pannexin hemichannels act as ATP conduits in hypotonicity-stimulated airway epithelial cells and that hemichannel opening is regulated by MLCK-and RhoA/ROCK. Supported by CFF SEMINA08F0 and NIH P01HL34322. Proper regulation of the airway surface liquid (ASL) volume is critical to allow for effective mucus clearance from the lung. The ASL, which is composed of periciliary liquid and mucus, is regulated by the active transport of sodium and chloride which establishes osmotic gradients that drive fluid flux across the airway epithelium. Despite the importance of the ASL to mucus clearance, few labs have the resources to study the volume or height of this liquid layer. We observed that when primary human airway cells are cultured on an air-liquid interface (ALI), a liquid meniscus typically develops at the edge of the culture insert. We reasoned that the size of the fluid meniscus is likely determined by the ASL volume and could be measured as an index of the epithelial surface hydration status. Therefore, we developed a simple method to measure the meniscus length and determined whether this measurement changes with perturbation to the ASL volume.",

Therefore, the meniscus length measurement is sensitive enough to differentiate CF from non-CF cultures. Next, a series of experiments was performed to determine whether the meniscus length could detect differences in ASL volume following volume expansion with isotonic (KBR) or hypertonic (KBR + 300 mM mannitol) fluids. A 2.5 \u00b5l bolus of the solutions was applied to the apical surface and changes in the meniscus length were measured. Two hours following the fluid bolus, the meniscus length increased 1.8 \u00b1 0.1 fold under isotonic conditions compared to a 2.6 \u00b1 0.2 fold increase with the hypertonic fluid (p= 0.002, n=12 cultures from 3 non-CF tissue donors).

Approximately 55% of cells responded only to cAMP agonists (IBMX+Forskolin) by depolarizing cell potentials (DVm= 5.6\u00b11.1, n=31 cells). Approximately 10% of the cells responded to both amiloride and cAMP agonists and ~11% of the cells did not respond to either amiloride or cAMP agonists. Results from immunolabeling of Na/K/2Cl co-transporter appear to indicate that this transporter (which plays a characteristic role in secretory cells) is predominantly confined to a specific group of cells located in the pleats but not in the ridges of the epithelial folds of small airways. Assuming that ENaC is critical for Na + transport and hence electrolyte fluid absorption, these results seem to indicate that only about half of the bronchiolar epithelial cells are engaged in fluid absorptive function. Furthermore, since about half of the cells responded to cAMP agonists but not amiloride seems to indicate that these cells may be involved in a function other than absorption. Further studies are required to determine whether these amiloride insensitive cells in fact express Na/K/2Cl co-transporter and therefore are responsible for secretory function.",

Most strains of P. aeruginosa secrete the virulence factor pyocyanin (Nmethyl-1-hydroxyphenazine; mw 210) that provides growth and survival advantages for P. aeruginosa in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Pyocyanin is cytotoxic and concentrations in pulmonary secretions from CF patients have been shown to reach levels up to 100 \u00b5M. Pyocyanin has the ability to penetrate cell membranes, and is known to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) by its ability to redox cycle with cellular electron donors, such as NADPH and glutathione. Since CFTR couples ATP hydrolysis to the extracellular transport of chloride and alters its anion selectivity for bicarbonate in response to metabolic changes, we investigated the central role of pyocyanin on CFTR Cltransport function (Ussing chamber assay) in CFTR-corrected CF bronchial epithelial cell monolayers (wtCFTR-CFBE41o-) and delineated its impact on key amino acid metabolites involved in the transmethylation, transsulfuration, and glutathione synthesis pathways using a high-throughput liquid chromatography linked tandem mass spectroscopy technique (LC/MS/MS). Acute exposure of the apical membrane to pyocyanin (100 \u00b5M) for 2-3 hours caused a gradual decline of CFTR Clcurrents that were stimulated by forskolin (to 86%), genistein (to 76%) or L-ascorbate (to 90%). Interestingly, CFTR Clcurrents stimulated by L-ascorbate were more rapidly blocked by pyocyanin and the faster rundown was likely due to the fact that L-ascorbate enhanced the production of ROS by serving as an electron donor for pyocyanin. These data suggested that prolonged exposure to pyocyanin induced increased ROS production which affected normal CFTR function.",

Supported by NIH grant P01 AT002620, PACFI, ENF, and CFF. Nasal polyposis (NP) is a useful model to study pathogenesis of chronic airway inflammation. NP could be either of unknown origin (primary NP) or secondary to cystic fibrosis (CF). To investigate the pathogenesis of human nasal epithelial cells (HNEC) from NP, we first performed relative protein quantitation by iTRAQ labeling followed by mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis. Among almost 600 proteins found to be differentially expressed, 158 were quantified with at least 2 peptides. The expression of 8 proteins was found to be significantly up-regulated in cells derived from primary and CF NP compared to control (mucosa without inflammation). One of the up-regulated proteins was GRP78, a protein involved in unfolded protein response (UPR). This result prompted us to further characterize UPR in primary and CF NP. Immunoblots were used to evaluate GRP78 expression at 7 and 21 days. We found an over-expression (3-4 fold) of GRP78 in primary and CF NP, compared to controls. To confirm a possible UPR induction in primary and CF NP, we performed immunoblots with three other UPR markers (calreticulin, GRP 94 and SERCa2). These 3 markers were found to be up-regulated in primary and CF NP (3-4 fold) at 7 days of culture, as compared to controls. Searching for the origin of UPR we tested a possible involvement of constitutive abnormally folded proteins. We performed the same experiments after 21 days of culture and found that the expression of 4 markers of UPR was unchanged in primary and CF NP vs. controls, showing a normalisation of UPR state with time of culture and thus suggesting another UPR origin. Knowing that aggregation of glycoproteins may trigger UPR, we tested whether MUC5AC, a major mucin expressed in airway cells, aggregates in endoplasmic reticulum after 7 days of culture. MUC5AC expression was similar after 7 and 21 days of culture, suggesting that this mucin is not involved in the trigger of UPR. To investigate a possible NP-dependent UPR induction, we performed immunoblots of GRP78 on proteins from primary culture of HNEC obtained by nasal brushing in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis or primary NP and in controls. GRP78 was found to be over-expressed in primary NP compared to control patients (3-4 fold) but was unchanged in chronic rhinosinusitis vs. controls, thereby showing that inflammation alone is not responsible for UPR and suggesting the involvement of UPR induction in the pathophysiology of NP. To investigate the connection between UPR response and inflammation, we measured secreted IL-8 by ELISA from primary cultures of primary NP and control patients at 7 and 21 days of culture. IL-8 levels were found to be increased after 7 days in primary NP culture vs. control (4-5 fold) , and normalised after 21 days of culture. These data indicate that inflammation may be in part consecutive to UPR response. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that UPR is related to inflammatory microenvironment and plays a role in the pathogenesis of primary and CF NP. The mechanism that triggers UPR in NP remains to be discovered.",

The better understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the first stages of CF lung disease development requires the analysis of respiratory epithelium samples obtained from young asymptomatic CF infants.

These native cells were then immediately used for the study of the airway epithelium functions. Airway epithelial sheets collected from brushings were analyzed by videomicroscopy for ciliary beating frequency measurement, for assessment of the cAMP dependent chloride efflux and for measurement of the gap junctions functionality by using a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) technique. In 6 CF infants, nasal brushing was performed within 2 months after birth and then when children were 1 year old. Six non-CF infants were also studied as control. At the time of nasal brushing, all non-CF patients were free of clinical signs of respiratory infection, and CF patients had no respiratory symptoms. We observed that the ciliary beating frequency was similar in the CF infants (12.5\u00b11.1 Hz) and in the non-CF infants (12.7\u00b10.5 Hz). The chloride efflux in the CF infants was 3.5 fold decreased (p=0.01) compared to the non-CF infants. This decreased chloride efflux was also observed in the airway cells obtained during the second brushing of CF infants. Large inter-individual variations of chloride efflux were noticed in the CF group (coefficient of variation: 94%) compared with the non-CF group (coefficient of variation: 34%).

            "text": "Xu, X. 2 ; Jackson, P.L. 2 Chronic neutrophilic inflammation is a common feature of a variety of lung diseases (such as chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis (CF)), leading to aggressive airway remodeling and increased morbidity/mortality. Recently our group has characterized N-acetyl Pro-Gly-Pro (Ac-PGP) as an important neutrophil chemoattractant in CF lung disease. Ac-PGP is generated from the breakdown of extracellular matrix (ECM) by the actions of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). MMP-9 is present in the tertiary granules of neutrophils and can be released following stimulation by inflammatory mediators. In the present report, we explore the ability of Ac-PGP to cause granule release from PMNs and determine if Ac-PGP-induced granule release could result in a feed-forward cycle by releasing the enzymes (i.e. MMP-9) required for its production. Freshly isolated human neutrophils were stimulated for 0, 15, 30 and 45 min with 1.0 mg/ml Ac-PGP. The cell-free supernatants were then collected and assayed for the presence of MMP-9 by gelatin zymography and ELISA. The results showed that Ac-PGP induced significant release of MMP-9 as early as 15 min post-treatment with the maximal MMP-9 release at 30-45 min. This release was recapitulated from quiescent PMNs isolated from mouse bone marrow. Both the MAPK/ERK pathway and p38 pathways are activated with Ac-PGP stimulation of PMNs. However, significant inhibition of MMP-9 release is observed only with ERK-pathway blockade. These data indicate that ECM-derived Ac-PGP could result in a feed-forward cycle by releasing MMP-9 from PMNs, augmenting PGP production and neutrophil influx. In addition, these results also highlight an important intracellular signaling pathway of MMP-9 release from PMNs. Targeting this feed-forward pathway in CF lung disease may serve as one mechanism to modulate disease progression. Kreda, S.M.; Seminario-Vidal, L.; van Heusden, C.; O'Neal, W.K.; Jones, L.C.; Boucher, R.C.; Lazarowski, E.R. Cystic Fibrosis/Pulmonary Research and Treatment Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA Purinergic regulation of native defence activities at the airway lumen is achieved by the release of ATP and other nucleotides from the underlying epithelial cells. However, there is no consensus about the mechanism(s) of nucleotide release. We have illustrated that ATP is secreted from goblet airway epithelial cells during Ca 2+ -regulated mucin exocytosis, suggesting that ATP is a releasable cargo-molecule within the mucin granule (Kreda et al. J Physiol 2007; 584:245) . This hypothesis was reinforced by illustrating that isolated mucin granules contain ATP and other adenyl-nucleotides (Kreda et al. Pediatr Pulmonol 2008; S31:246) . Thus, ATP released from mucin granules likely signals through purinergic receptors on neighbouring (ciliated) cells to promote ion/water transport for hydration of secreting mucins in the airway lumen. Here, we describe a receptor-mediated mechanism that promotes coordinated ATP and mucin release during inflammation in obstructive lung disorders. Thrombin and neutrophil elastase are human proteases abundant in lumenal secretions of airways undergoing inflammation, and are agonists for the protease activating receptors (PAR) 1 and 2, respectively. RT-PCR analysis revealed the expression of PAR-1 and PAR-2 in Calu-3 and primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. Thrombin and elastase applied basolaterally stimulated the simultaneous and lumenal release of mucins (assessed by immuno-slot blot) and ATP (quantified by the luciferase assay) from Calu-3 and HBE cells. PAR-1 and PAR-2 selective peptide agonists mimicked the proteases' response, suggesting that PAR-1 and PAR-2 activation mediated the ATP and mucin release stimulated by thrombin and elastase, respectively. Thrombin, elastase, and PAR-1 and PAR-2 activating peptides elicited mucin granule exocytosis as determined by confocal microscopy studies of cells labelled with FM 1-43 and MUC5AC antibodies. PAR-mediated mucin and ATP release was dependent on intracellular Ca 2+ mobilization and actin cytoskeleton, since BAPTA-AM and cytochalasin D blocked these responses. We recently established that Rho kinase and myosin light chain (MLC) kinase regulate thrombinpromoted ATP release in airway cells (Seminario-Vidal et al. J Biol Chem 2009 May12 [Epub ahead print] ). Inhibitors of Rho and MLC kinases blocked not only ATP release, but also mucin granule secretion in PAR-stimulated Calu-3 and HBE cells.",

Mucin proteins are the main macromolecular component of airway mucus, a fundamental constituent of the mucosal innate defense system, whose failure is responsible for the development of severe pulmonary disease in cystic fibrosis (CF). Our current hypothesis is that loose physical interactions between secreted mucins (Muc5AC and Muc5B) and membrane-tethered mucins (Muc1, Muc4, Muc16), in the context of normal airway surface liquid, allow for efficient airway mucus clearance via the action of beating cilia and cough. In the context of a dehydrated airway surface, such as would be expected in CF lungs, secreted mucins become adherent to the underlying airway epithelium, possibly due to inappropriate interactions of secreted mucus with membrane-tethered mucins, which are predicted to form a significant component of the epithelial glycocalyx via their large extracellular glycosylated domains. To begin to unravel the significance of the interactions between secreted and membrane-tethered mucins, we have utilized mice deficient in Muc1 and Muc4 in the context of the Scnn1btransgenic mouse model, in which airway-targeted overexpression of the \u03b2subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (\u03b2ENaC) results in airway surface dehydration, early postnatal death due to airway mucus obstruction, and chronic neutrophilic inflammation. We hypothesized that, in the absence of Muc1 and Muc4, secreted mucus would be less adhesive and better cleared from the airways, resulting in less inflammation and amelioration of the chronic lung disease that develops in this model. Contrary to our predictions, we detected no significant difference in the phenotype of the Scnn1b-Tg mice in the absence of either Muc1, Muc4, or in the absence of both Muc1 and Muc4. Survival did not significantly improve, nor did any of the parameters that are normally measured to monitor disease phenotype, including presence of airway inflammation and infiltrating inflammatory cell profile, occurence of mucus plugs, and incidence of air space enlargement. We have previously shown that deletion of Muc4 can lead to transcriptional up-regulation of Muc16, and so we suspect that functional redundancy is responsible for the lack of phenotype in Muc1/Muc4 Scnn1b-Tg mice. To address this issue, we have begun breeding the Scnn1b-Tg mice to the Muc16 knockout mice. Preliminary results of this cross are pending. We anticipate that the availability of all of these models, in conjunction with mouse models deficient for Muc5AC and Muc5B, will allow us to study the role of individual mucins in the adhesive properties of airway mucus under normal conditions and in the presence of CF-like airway surface dehydraton.",

The gel-forming mucins are very high molecular weight (6-100 MDa), heavily glycosylated proteins which are stored in mucin secretory granules (MSGs) and secreted by goblet cells from the airway surface epithelium or from mucous cells in submucosal glands. The principal airway mucins, MUC5AC and MUC5B, are the precursors to normal airway mucus, which is a key part of the mucociliary clearance system, the first line of innate defense in the airways. The molecular mechanisms by which these mucins are packaged in MSGs and released by exocytosis, and how the released mucins mature to form a functioning mucus layer are not understood. We have therefore worked to develop a method to isolate intact MSGs, to be used as a common technical approach to all of the above questions. Starting with extracts of human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells, or of N3T cells, a cell line derived from HBE cells which exhibits a goblet cell phenotype, equilibrium centrifugation in a continuous Iodixanol (OptiPrep\u00ae) gradient (5-33%) , was used to separate MSGs from mucins (released or secreted) and other cell organelles. The results revealed that the buoyant density of MSGs is only slightly higher than that of secreted mucin, ~1.1 and ~1.05 g/ml, respectively (note: the usual buoyant density reported for mucins isolated by equilibrium centrifugation in CsCl 2 is ~1.4 g/ml). To achieve a faster and higher degree of separation, rate zonal centrifugation was used to take advantage of the differences in sedimentation rates between MSGs and secreted mucins, rates that are heavily influenced by size and shape. Antibodies specific to MUC5AC or MUC5B were used to probe fractions bound to nitrocellulose in a slot blot apparatus. The MSG-rich fraction identified was also positive for Rab3D, a well-known marker for mucin and many other secretory granules. Light microscopy of the MSG-rich fraction revealed \u00b5m-sized spherical organelles which trapped acridine orange, indicating the low pH environment expected for MSGs. By electron microscopy, a dense, fibrous material was clearly associated with the organelles when they were disrupted by low concentrations of detergent. This MSG purification method represents a tool that can be used to study many aspects of mucin biology, including how it is unpackaged following release from the granule. This study was supported by a grant from the Mucus Consortium funded by Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics. Defective electrolyte transport by airway epithelia may play an important role in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. To better understand how loss of CFTR affects transepithelial ion transport, we investigated airway epithelia in a porcine model of CF. We studied epithelia from pigs within ~12 hr of birth and assessed electrolyte transport in vivo in the nose and trachea and in vitro with freshly excised tissue and epithelial cultures from the nose, trachea and small bronchi. There were several general findings. a) We observed no consistent differences between CFTR +/+ and CFTR +/epithelia, suggesting that reduced amounts of CFTR are sufficient for normal transport. b) After inhibiting short-circuit current (I sc ) with amiloride, increasing cellular cAMP by adding forskolin and IBMX stimulated I sc in wild-type and CFTR +/epithelia, but generated little or no current in CFTR -/epithelia. In vivo studies of V t yielded similar results. In addition, HCO 3 transport was eliminated in CFTR -/epithelia. These data indicate the loss of CFTR function in CFTR-null airways. c) We observed transient electrical responses to apical addition of ATP that did not differ by genotype. d) Under basal conditions, V t was greater in vivo than in freshly excised tissue. Our studies suggest a significant component of edge damage that increased transepithelial electrical conductance (G t ) in freshly excised tissue. The G t of cultured epithelia was much lower than that of freshly excised epithelia. e) Electrolyte transport by trachea and lower airways was similar, but there were differences between those epithelia and nasal epithelia. Compared to epithelia from intrapulmonary airways, cultured nasal epithelia had greater values of basal I sc and G t ; this was the case in both CFTR -/and control epithelia. In wild-type epithelia, nasal cultures also showed a smaller current increase with elevations of cAMP than did epithelia from intrapulmonary airways. These data suggest physiological regional differences, even in newborn pigs. In summary, these studies allow a comparison between in vivo and in vitro epithelia and between different airway regions that has not been possible in humans. They also provide an opportunity to investigate transport at a time when epithelia do not manifest changes secondary to disease. Similarities between the function of human and porcine airway epithelia suggest porcine airway epithelia should be of value for better understanding the early development of CF lung disease. Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA; 2. Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA The critical dysfunction in cystic fibrosis (CF) is an increase in mucus viscosity, which disrupts healthy mucocilliary clearance in the airway. For this reason, measurement of mucus viscosity is key to quantifying CF pathology and developing new CF therapies. Unfortunately, mucus specimens are difficult to obtain, viscometry is low-throughput, and volume sizes are small.",

            "text": "Conclusions: SLC26A9 knock-down by siRNA does not significantly affect 36 Chloride uptake in A549 cells. A recent publication (Bertrand CA et al. J Gen Physiol 2009; 133:421) demonstrated interaction between SLC26A9 and CFTR, and that functional CFTR is needed for SLC26A9 to function as a chloride transporter in human bronchial epithelial cells. As A549 cells do not express CFTR, further studies following transfection of CFTR into A549 cells may help elucidate the role of SLC26A9 in chloride transport in small airway epithelium. The efficiency of the mucociliary clearance (MCC) system depends critically on the height and properties of a thin airway surface liquid (ASL) layer that covers the respiratory tract. Compelling evidence shows that extracellular nucleotides in the ASL play an important role in the control of ASL volume and MCC function. Recently, we demonstrated that ATP release from alveolar A549 and bronchial 16HBE14oepithelial cells is a mechanosensitive, Ca 2+ -dependent process that is strongly amplified by the synergistic autocrine/paracrine actions of co-released adenosine and uridine nucleotides. Studies of the purinergic regulation of ASL volume have been hampered, however, by the lack of appropriate methods that allow the direct monitoring of ASL in real-time. We have recently developed a side-view fluorescence microscopy technique that allows the direct monitoring of the ASL on cell monolayers cultured at air-liquid interface. The aims of this study were to test our method with different airway epithelial cell models, including CF and non-CF cells, and to optimize the image analysis method for ASL volume quantification. During side-view imaging experiments, the basolateral side of the cell monolayer is perfused with physiological solution (37\u221eC), while the apical side is exposed to airflow (37\u221eC, humidity ~90%), mimicking the lung micro-environment. The Alexa 488 dextran-labelled ASL is observed at different angles, ranging from 0\u221e to 90\u221e, permitting the direct observation of ASL distribution and thickness. Results with 16HBE14o -, A549 and Calu-3 epithelial cell models indicate that ASL isn't homogenously spread over the cell monolayer and that its local thickness varies significantly due to its accumulation in crypts between cells. Consequently, ASL volume per surface area, e.g. in \u00b5l/cm 2 , provides a better description than ASL height at any point. Similar ASL distribution was observed with both a bronchial epithelial CFBE cell line that expresses the \u2206F508 mutation, and the wild-type CFTR-corrected CFBE line. To quantify ASL volume, the most convenient approach was to observe the apical surface of the cell monolayer at 45\u221e. In this configuration, only a narrow bright fluorescent strip remains in focus, due to the depth of field effect. The variable width of the strip is directly related to local ASL height, from which the ASL cross-sectional area, average thickness and volume per surface area was estimated using the Metavue image analysis software (Molecular Devices, PA). Experiments with Calu-3 cell cultures showed that a thapsigargin-induced (1 \u00b5M) intracellular calcium elevation transiently increased the ASL volume from a basal level of 0.7 \u00b5l/cm 2 , to 0.95 \u00b5l/cm 2 within two minutes, and then returned to its baseline level after 15 minutes. The experiments demonstrate the feasibility of our imaging technique to quantify the volume and distribution of ASL on cell culture surfaces, and to study the changes induced by physiologically-relevant stimuli in real-time.",

The airway epithelium is lined by a small amount of airway surface liquid (ASL). Studies of exhaled breath condensate suggest that glucose con-centration in this fluid is one tenth that in plasma. During hyperglycemia, ASL glucose concentration increases while the gradient of plasma to ASL glucose concentration is maintained. Interestingly, in normoglycemic humans with cystic fibrosis, this gradient is disrupted resulting in an abnormally high glucose concentration in ASL. We studied this glucose concentration gradient in vitro, and showed that well-differentiated HAE cultures generate a transepithelial glucose gradient with low ASL glucose concentration. We investigated the mechanisms that generate the transepithelial glucose gradient. We found that HAE do not show electrogenic glucose transport, suggesting absence of sodium-glucose cotransporters (SGLT). Immunofluorescence showed that the facilitated diffusion transporter GLUT-1 is expressed in the basolateral membrane and GLUT-10 is expressed in the apical membrane. Absence of SGLT expression was confirmed by immunofluorescence. In bidirectional flux assays, we found that HAE have low paracellular permeability to L-glucose. Moreover, 2deoxyglucose fluxes favored basal to apical transport. Finally, we studied the physiological significance of the transepithelial glucose gradient. We found that increasing ASL glucose results in increased growth and infection rates with P. aeruginosa in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that increased plasma glucose concentration or disruption of the paracellular barrier could result in increased glucose in the ASL and increased risk of pulmonary infection. In the CF lung, an increased ASL concentration of glucose and other potential carbon sources could be an additional factor that promotes airway colonization by bacterial pathogens.

The mucus transport rate initially increases as the viscosity of the layer increases before reaching a threshold viscosity at which mean transport decreases. Further, results indicate that while average rate of transport is constant as a function of height over the time course of the experiments, oscillations in mean transport velocity are present. These oscillations, which occur at a congruent frequency to the underlying ciliary beat, decay with the distance from the mucus ciliary interface, and can be used to define the viscoelastic properties of the fluid, as well as the strains and strain rates imparted on the mucus layer by cilia.",

The gap between plates is small, between 50 -500 \u00b5m, and when the driven oscillations are on the same order as those seen in mucus transport, the device is able to successfully mimic the oscillatory component of mucus transport. Under these controlled conditions, we are able to accurately measure the bulk viscoelastic properties of only 10 -20 \u00b5L of a complex fluid like mucus, compared to the 1 -2 mL required for standard cone and plate rheometry.

Cystic Fibrosis/Pulmonary Research and Treatment Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA; 3. Departhment of Physics and Astronomy, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA Determining the force generated by individual human lung epithelial cilia is critical for predictive modeling of many physiological functions including the ability of cilia to clear pathogens and particulates via transport of mucus. Such a measurement also allows a reasonable calculation of the force produced by each dynein motor during the active stroke, which is of interest to understanding motor function within all cellular systems. We covered 2.8 \u00b5m magnetic beads with gold, except for a small area of streptavidin on each bead, and used biotinylated wheatgerm agglutinin to bind the beads to cilia. We recorded bead motion while we applied forces on the bead via magnetic fields generated by a 3-Dimensional Force Microscope. We found that forces up to those sufficient to reduce beat amplitude by 85% did not alter the cilia beat frequency, and thus the axoneme behaved as an internally driven system throughout its beat cycle. Forces in excess of 160 pN were required to reduce the beat amplitude below 15%. We cast these results into a simple one dimensional model of axoneme dynamics, which yields an effective internal motor force of 62pN \u00b1 14pN, or ~ 6pN per active dynein. MaxiK channels (i.e. BKCa) are voltage and calcium dependent potassium channels constituted by a tetramer of the pore-forming alpha subunit (KCNMA1). We previously demonstrated that MaxiK channels play a role in nucleotide-stimulated chloride transport in bronchial epithelial cells differentiated at the air-liquid interface. MaxiK activity is regulated by the presence of beta regulatory subunits (KCNMB1-B4). KCNMB1 and KCNMB4 positively modulate response to calcium in MaxiK channels, while KCNMB3 and KCNMB4 are inhibitory subunits. Expression of KCNMA1 and KCNMB1-B4 was studied in normal (NBE) and cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial (CFBE) cells from human donors, cultured and differentiated at the air\u2212liquid interface (ALI). We found that KCNMA1 and KCNMB4 were expressed both at mRNA and protein level in NBE (from 9 donors) and CFBE (from 3 donors) cells, but the mRNA expression of KCNMB4 was higher in CFBE cells (p<0.005). On the other hand, KCNMB1 mRNA expression could not be detected in NBE or CFBE cells while the inhibitory regulatory subunits KCNMB2 and KCNMB3 appear decreased in CFBE cells compared to NBE. Interestingly, TGFbeta stimulation of cells for 20 hours caused an increase of KCNMA1 and KCNMB4 mRNA in both NBE and CFBE cells. However, only CFBE showed an increase of KCNMB1. When the MaxiK opener NS1619 was used in Ussing chamber experiments, chloride secretion was stimulated in NBE but not in CFBE cells. Pretreatment with TGFbeta elicitied some response in CFBE cells in response to NS1619. The data indicate that alpha and beta subunits of MaxiK channels are expressed in both NBE and CFBE cells, but that there seem to be differences in the regulation of of MaxiK activity between the NBE and CFBE cells. Center, UNC, Chapel Hill, NC, USA CF females exhibit an accelerated decline in lung function and reduced survival rates compared to CF males. The mechanism(s) underlying such a gender disadvantage are unknown. However, we have previously shown that physiologic levels of E2 inhibit ATP/calcium dependent airway surface liquid (ASL) homeostasis by inhibiting calcium signaling (1) . This is predicted to adversely affect airway epithelial function and induce ASL volume depletion and mucus stasis, leading us to hypothesize that E2-mediated inhibition of airways calcium signaling contributes to the gender disadvantage seen in CF females. Using a CF nasal cell line (JME cells) that endogenously expresses estrogen receptor alpha and stromal interacting molecule 1 (STIM1), we measured changes in intracellular calcium levels by imaging Fura2 as described previously (1) . In the absence of extracellular calcium, 10 \u00b5M ATP caused a change in Fura2 emission ratio (F 340/380 ) of 0.63 \u00b1 0.11 (n=12). The subsequent reintroduction of extracellular calcium caused an additional increase in F 340/380 of 0.39 \u00b1 0.07 (n=12). A brief (15 min) pretreatment with 10 nM E2 had no effect on the ATP-dependent change in F 340/380 under calcium-free conditions (n=12). However, E2 significantly reduced the change in F 340/380 seen in the presence of extracellular calcium from 0.39 \u00b1 0.07 to 0.1 \u00b1 0.04, suggesting that E2 specifically inhibits calcium influx (n=6). ATP-stimulated P2Y2 receptors raise intracellular IP3 which stimulates calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. This then triggers STIM1 to aggregate and activate calcium influx. We next tested the hypothesis that E2 prevents STIM1 from initiating calcium influx. Knockdown of STIM1 by >90% with shRNA abolished calcium influx (n=6), confirming that STIM1 is indeed required to initiate calcium influx. We then transfected cfpSTIM1 and yfpSTIM1 into JME cells and measured STIM1 aggregation using Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET). 10 \u00b5M ATP addition increased STIM1 FRET from 14 \u00b1 2.6% under basal conditions to 33 \u00b1 4.6% (n=6; p<0.05). A 10 min preincubation with 10 nM E2 abolished this increase in FRET (post-ATP FRET with E2 was 12%; n=6). Further qualitative analysis revealed that ATP exposure caused the appearance of STIM1 punctae and E2 alone did not change STIM1 localization. However, E2 and ATP together caused STIM1 to be mislocalized and prevented the formation of puncta. Thus, we propose that E2 exerts its negative effects on airway epithelia by preventing STIM1 from aggregating to initiate calcium influx. The nature of the interaction between E2 and STIM1 remains to be determined. The study of mucociliary clearance in vivo would be significantly advanced by the development of a high-speed imaging technology for visualizing the respiratory mucosa at the cellular level, and could yield new insights into disease pathogenesis. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) is an emerging technique capable of providing reflectance images with subcellular resolution at video rates.",

Intermittent acute viral infections have been associated with decreased lung function and disease progression.

We hypothesized that MPA infection facilitates RV binding and replication in airway epithelial cells.

Among the host defense molecules produced by these cells are the inducible antimicrobial peptides, which include \u03b2-defensins and the cathelicidin LL-37. In AEC, human \u03b2-defensin (hBD) 2 and 3 are induced upon recognition of bacteria by receptors which include the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and CD14. We previously demonstrated that LL-37 is induced by the active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 in cultured normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells. To examine this response further, we stimulated air-liquid interface (ALI) cultured cell lines from either normal or cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 . We observed that LL-37 mRNA and protein levels increased in all cell lines when stimulated either in the basolateral medium or on the apical surface, as measured by quantitative PCR and western blot, respectively. Furthermore, antimicrobial activity was similarly increased on the apical surface of the ALI cultures in response to 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 . Analysis of the promoter region of the LL-37 gene identified a C/EBP\u03b1 site adjacent to the vitamin D response element (VDRE) necessary for the induction in airway cells. To determine whether other innate immune genes were similarly induced in airway cells in response to 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 , we tested an innate immunity PCR array with cDNA from stimulated and unstimulated NHBE cells. We observed that mRNA encoding Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells (TREM)-1, was induced over 20-fold in response to 10 -8 M 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 in ALI cultures of both CF and normal cells. The response was rapid, with a 3-6-fold induction within 3 hours, and a peak of 6-15-fold increase by 12 hours. TREM-1 is a novel pattern recognition receptor that has been demonstrated to amplify the innate immune response in monocytes. Our results demonstrate for the first time that TREM-1 gene expression is regulated in AEC, and that vitamin D can increase the innate immune defense of the airway epithelium. This suggests that vitamin D treatment of airways in patients with CF could lead to an increased innate immune defense.",

            "text": "Inflammation and infection are major contributors to the ultimate morbidity and mortality in CF lung disease. Inflammation in the CF lung is excessive, but inefficient at resolving infection with pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.A.). It has been shown that macrophages express Cftr (Nat Cell Biol 8:933. 2006 ) and directly contribute to the exaggerated inflammatory response in CF knockout mice (AJRCMB 40:295. 2009 ). We hypothesize that not only do myeloid cells directly contribute to the exuberant response in CF, but Cftr expression directly impacts macrophage phenotype and response to infection even prior to infection exposure. In bone marrow (BM) studies using chronic infection with P.A., not only can wild type (WT) BM decrease CF knockout mortality due to chronic infection with P.A. (from 0% survival to 54% survival) but CF BM given to WT mice significantly decreased survival of WT mice in response to P.A. chronic infection (from 55% survival to 22% survival). These observations suggest that BM-derived cells have important contributions to CF. BM includes myeloid progenitors macrophages and neutrophils, essential players in host innate immunity. To study the direct role of Cftr on macrophage function and activity, we generated a myeloid-specific Cftr knockout mouse using the mechanism of cre/loxP. In this system Cftr exon 10 is floxed by loxP sites resulting in excision of exon 10 in myeloid cells with cre-recombinase production regulated by the lysozyme promoter. Evaluation of myeloid specific Cftr bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell pellets showed a significant decrease in peroxisome proliferator activator receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) expression relative to WT controls (-2.06\u00b10.7 fold less PPAR\u03b3 expression compared to WT, p=0.05). PPAR\u03b3 expression was also decreased in BAL cell pellets of Cftr null animals (B6.129P-2-Cftr tm1Unc ,-2.88\u00b10.11 fold less PPAR\u03b3 expression compared to WT, p<0.001), and CF patient sputum cell pellets (-21.50\u00b17.50 fold less PPAR\u03b3 gene expression compared to healthy control, p<0.03). The absence of sufficient PPAR\u03b3 may contribute to the overt inflammatory response found in CF (J Cyst Fibros 7:68. 2008 ). To determine if decreased myeloid specific PPAR\u03b3 could contribute to the enhanced inflammation and infection in vivo, we evaluated the ability of the myeloid specific PPAR\u03b3 knockout (WT Cftr) to resolve chronic infection with P.A. Our results showed that 75\u00b17% of the myeloid-specific PPAR\u03b3 deficient animals died in response to chronic infection with P.A. compared to 100% survival of WT controls. These data suggest an essential role of myeloid PPAR\u03b3 in resolving chronic lung infection with P.A. To evaluate if the deficiency of PPAR\u03b3 was related to loss of Cftr function, we induced PPAR\u03b3 expression in the macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 in the presence or absence of Cftr inhibitor I172 (I172, 10 \u00b5g/ml). I172 inhibited PPAR\u03b3 expression in LPS-stimulated cultures (-2.1\u00b10.7 fold less PPAR\u03b3 compared to no I172). These data suggest that Cftr deficient myeloid cells have altered expression of PPAR\u03b3, resulting in a phenotype which can directly contribute to the excessive inflammatory response in CF.",

            "text": "Funded Pulmonary infection leads to chronic inflammation and irreversible loss of lung function over time. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is arguably the most important pathogen in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients leading to this loss of lung function. Currently our therapeutic strategies to treat P. aeruginosa infection focus on antimicrobials and airway clearance; however, these treatments are only partially effective because they cannot eliminate the inciting pathogen. An alternative therapeutic approach is to target the host inflammatory response, neutralizing ineffective or overtly inflammatory components, while preserving functional immunity that prevents acute dissemination of P. aeruginosa. Currently the inflammation-targeted therapies are not widely used due to difficulties with monitoring (NSAIDS) or significant side effects (steroids). Identification and characterization of other inflammatory targets is critical to developing new therapies. Our prior work identified IL-17 as critical to driving neutrophil recruitment in an agarose bead model of P. aeruginosa infection (Dubin PJ and Kolls JK, Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 2007;292:L519-28). Our subsequent work suggested that IL-23, an upstream cytokine to IL-17, might also be critical to neutrophil recruitment through actions which were dependent-and independent of IL-17. We hypothesized that: IL-23 mediates neutrophil recruitment seen in P.aeruginosa airway infection through interactions with IL-1\u03b2 and through the downstream activation of Th17 cells. Our data from in vitro and acute in vivo murine models of pulmonary infection with P. aeruginosa demonstrate that IL-23 is a critical innate immune mediator of neutrophil recruitment through its interactions with IL-1\u03b2 to precipitate the production of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth factors by macrophages; the IL-23/IL-1\u03b2 effects seen are synergistic. We have also demonstrated the IL-23induced production of IL-17 by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and a specific Th17 response during the adaptive immune response in P. aeruginosa infection, using both \"acute\" and \"chronic\" (agarose bead) models of P. aerguinosa infection. This response is characterized by the production of IL-17, IL-17F and IL-22. In these studies, neutralization of the IL-23 and Th17 responses did not lead to worsened pulmonary infection or dissemination of infection. These studies demonstrate the importance of IL-23, IL-17 and Th17 cells to P. aeruginosa-induced inflammation. Because these inflammatory mediators are critical to neutrophil recruitment, dispensable for P. aeruginosa containment and key check-points in the inflammatory response, they are promising targets for anti-inflammatory therapy in CF.",

In contrast to the neutrophilic inflammation in the airway lumen, lymphocytes predominate in the airway wall. The phenotype and roles of these lymphocytes have not been explored. It is postulated that the Th17 pathway could play a pivotal role in CF as IL17, secreted by Th17 cells, is proinflammatory, and regulates granulopoiesis as well as neutrophil recruitment. Raised levels of IL17 have been observed in the BAL of patients with CF and non-CF bronchiectasis (Bx). The aim of this study was to characterize the lymphocytes in the submucosal area of endobronchial biopsies of patients with CF, non-CF Bx and healthy controls, staining for CD4 (T helper cells), CD8 (cytotoxic T cells) and IL17.",

Microbiology and Immunology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada S100A7, also called psoriasin, is a low molecular weight, Ca 2+ -binding protein, originally described in psoriatic skin lesions, and which possesses antimicrobial activity in addition to acting as a chemotactic agent for T lymphocytes and neutrophils. Airway epithelial cells produce a number of powerful antimicrobial agents, often in common with the skin, since both skin and the airways ultimately function as barriers and come into contact with significant amounts of microflora. Therefore, we wished to investigate whether airway epithelial cells expressed psoriasin, and hypothesized that if present, its expression might be affected by physiological factors pertinent to the CF lung, for example oxidant stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Using RT-PCR and immunoblotting, we determined that psoriasin is expressed at the transcript and protein levels in a number of model human airway epithelial cells lines. Comparison of the normal bronchial epithelial cell line 16HBE14o-and the CF bronchial epithelial cell line CFBE41o-(\u2206F508/\u2206F508) determined that significantly less psoriasin was expressed, both at the mRNA and protein level, in the CFBE41o-cells compared to the normal 16HBE14o-. Using quantitative PCR, we found that treatment with the oxidant stressor t-butylhydroperoxide (t-BOOH) at 500 \u00b5M for 24 hours significantly reduced psoriasin gene expression in the 16HBE14o-cells, while 150 \u00b5M t-BOOH (which was the highest dose of t-BOOH we could administer without causing cell death) had no effect in CFBE41o-cells. Next, we investigated psoriasin expression in response to IL-22: 16HBE14o-cells treated with IL-22 (40 ng/ml) showed a significant increase in psoriasin gene expression, while no change was apparent in the CFBE41o-cells. Finally, since high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines have been measured in the CF airway, we wished to investigate whether exposure to IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3 would have any effect. Exposure to IL-1\u03b2 for 24 hours had no effect on psoriasin gene expression in the 16HBE14o-cells, but significantly increased expression in CFBE41o-cells. Treatment with either TNF-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3 (again for 24 hours) significantly increased psoriasin gene expression in both cell lines, though the increases in the 16HBE14o-cells were less pronounced than in the CFBE41o-cells. Presently, studies using the mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain 8821 (a gift from A. Charkrabarty, University of Illinois) are underway to determine whether the enhanced expression of psoriasin seen in response to IL-22 treatment is associated with increased bacterial internalization and killing.",

            "text": "Conclusions: This preliminary series of observations supports reports of increased CO in the exhaled breath of patients with CF. The positive correlation of HbCO, measured by SpCO, and FEV1 suggests that HbCO is not only a marker of inflammatory and oxidative stress but may be a measure of a beneficial adaptive response. This concept is supported by an in vitro study of a CF airway epithelial cell line that showed overexpression of HO-1, which results in the release of CO, led to protection against Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced injury and apoptosis (Zhou et al. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2004; 170:633-640 CF lung disease is characterized by an exaggerated inflammatory response and susceptibility to microbial colonization, particularly with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa). Overall in CF, host immune response does not seem to be adequate to eradicate Pa from the respiratory tract. CFTR is expressed in a variety of cells of the immune system, including dendritic cells (DC). Given the critical role of lung DC to initiate adaptive immune response against pathogen infections of the respiratory tract, the present study characterizes lung DC subsets including conventional DC (cDC) and plasmacytoid DC (pDC) from CF mice and their response to pulmonary infection with Pa. DC were isolated from lung suspensions of naive CF mice (Cftr tm1UNC knockout mice) and WT mice (C57/BL6 mice) or 6 days following intranasal administration of Pa (1x10 5 cfu/mouse). The lung DC subsets were analyzed as cDC (CD11b high CD11c high cells) or pDC (CD11b -CD11c + B220 + cells), and their activation and maturation profiles by surface expression of CD40, CD80, CD86, MHCII, and PCDA1 by flow cytometry. Both pulmonary DC subsets in naive CF mice were lower compared to WT controls (cDC: 1.6 \u00b1 0.1% in CF mice, 2.9 \u00b1 0.1% in WT mice, p<0.01; and pDC: 0.5 \u00b1 0.1% in CF mice, 0.9 \u00b1 0.1% pDC in WT mice, p< 0.01). The DC subsets from the CF mice showed less maturation and activation compared to the WT controls at baseline, with lower expression of CD40, CD80, CD86, and MHCII (p<0.05, all comparisons). Mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) was performed to assess the allostimulatory capacity of DC. The proliferation index of allogeneic T cells stimulated by CF DC was 1.7-fold lower compared to the WT controls (p<0.01). Following infection with Pa, the percentage of cDC decreased 1.4 \u00b1 0.1-fold in WT mice compared to 0.9 \u00b1 0.1-fold in CF mice (p<0.05); and the pDC population decreased by 1.2 \u00b1 0.1-fold in the WT mice and did not change in the CF mice (p<0.05). After Pa infection, cDC from CF mice showed up-regulation of CD40 (p<0.05), and MHCII expression was increased in cDC from both WT and CF mice. The proliferation index of allogeneic T cells stimulated by CF DC or WT DC following infection with Pa was comparably increased 2-fold. These data demonstrate that lung DC from CF mice show baseline differences of activation and maturation profiles and allostimulatory capacity, and an impaired response upon infection with Pa. This may be an important mechanism underlying the increased susceptibility of Pa infection in CF lung disease.",

Hypertonic saline treatment lowers IL-8 levels in the lung and therefore may aid inflammatory resolution. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is the principal chemoattracting agent of neutrophildominated inflammation, which causes progressive lung tissue damage in cystic fibrosis (CF). CF respiratory epithelium secretes elevated amounts of IL-8 either spontaneously or in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1. Ibuprofen, a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug, and corticosteroids are clinically beneficial in CF, but concerns over adverse effects have limited their use. Corticosteroids, such as dexam-ethasone, are known negative regulators of IL-8 in respiratory epithelial cells. It is not clear whether ibuprofen exerts similar effects on IL-8 production in respiratory epithelial cells. We examined the effects of clinically relevant concentrations of ibuprofen (480 \u00b5M) and dexamethasone (5 nM) on nuclear factor \u03baB (NF\u03baB, a transcription factor up-regulating IL-8) activation and IL-8 production in a TNF-\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) stimulated CFTE29o-cell line, in order to compare anti-inflammatory mechanisms. CFTE29o-cells, expressing \u2206F508 mutated CFTR, were pre-incubated for 30 minutes (\u00b1) ibuprofen or dexamethasone, and stimulated for 1 hour with TNF-\u03b1.

Growing evidence suggests sphingolipids (SLs) and glycosphingolipids (GSLs) as novel targets for the treatment of pulmonary disorders such as asthma, COPD, acute lung injury and CF [Uhlig, 2008] , being involved in many biological events such as immunity, pathogen invasion and apoptosis [Hannun 2008] . Recently, the accumulation of the SL ceramide has been identified as one of the key regulators of inflammation and infection in CF airways [Teichgraber 2008] . Miglustat, an inhibitor of the synthesis of glycosphingolipids, already used for treating type I Gaucher disease, produces an anti-inflammatory effect in bronchial epithelial cells [Dechecchi 2008] . In this study we tested the effect of miglustat on murine models of lung inflammation in vivo by administrating aqueous solution of miglustat (2 mg/dose) in C57BL/6J mice by intraesophageal gavage with three administrations 72, 48 and 24 hours before intranasal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected 4 h post LPS challenge. Miglustat significantly reduced the amount of neutrophils recruited in BALF by 60% whereas lymphocytes or alveolar macrophages were unchanged. These results indicate that miglustat strongly reduces neutrophil chemotaxis in vivo. To support the hypothesis that miglustat affects the im\u00b5mune response through changes in cellular ceramide levels, CF bronchial cells were treated with amitriptyline, an inhibitor of two important enzymes of the SL metabolism: acid sphingomyelinase and acid ceramidase. Amitriptyline (10 \u00b5M), added to IB3-1 and CuFi-1 cells 4 hours before infection with P. aeruginosa, significantly inhibited the expression of IL-8 mRNA by about 50%. Cellular ceramide levels were then measured in cells treated with both miglustat and amitriptyline, by FACS analysis with anticeramide antibody MAS 0020 (Glycobiotech). Ceramide staining in IB3-1 and CuFi-1 cells increased upon infection with P. aeruginosa. Both miglustat and amitriptyline significantly reduced the increase of ceramide expression induced by P. aeruginosa. Collectively these data indicate a link between the anti-inflammatory effect of miglustat and the decrease of ceramide levels and strengthen the hypothesis that SL metabolism represents a target to restore a normal inflammatory response in CF epithelium.",

Cultured 2WT2 epithelia pre-incubated for 10 min. with living P. aeruginosa (MOI 100) had 1.15X increase in forskolin-activated CFTR dependent peak iodide efflux rate. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS 50-200ug/mL) purified from P. aeruginosa extracellular surface when preincubated for 10 min. increased CFTR channel activity more potently than live bacteria (1.5X increase in forskolin-activated CFTR dependent peak iodide efflux rate), and did so in a dose dependent manner. However, shorter exposure to 100ug/mL LPS (no pre-inubation but simultaneous administration with forskolin) resulted in 0.8X reduced CFTR-dependent area under the curve of iodide efflux rate. This is the first report of a bacterial product causing a biphasic time-dependent and a dose-dependent alteration of CFTR channel activity. These data are consistent with a model in which CFTR may be removed from the plasma membrane during phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa followed by recruitment of the channel to the membrane to replace channels removed during phagocytosis. Chronic bronchial infections by Pseudomonas aeruginosa are a major problem in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF), bronchiectasis or COPD. Earlier studies suggest that azithromycin (AZM) improves respiratory function in CF patients colonized with P. aeruginosa independent of the bacterial count within the lung.

The results could help explain the beneficial effects of macrolides observed in CF clinical trials. Center, UNC, Chapel Hill, NC, USA; 2. Medicine, UNC, Chapel Hill, NC, USA We have shown that human bronchial epithelial (HBE) inflammation triggers endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR activation during HBE inflammation couples to stimulation of the inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), an ER enzyme that splices the mRNA of the transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1), a pathway required for protein secretion in many cells. Our recent data demonstrated that activation of IRE1/XBP-1 is functionally relevant for airway inflammation in vitro and in vivo, because XBP-1 mRNA splicing induces expansion of ER calcium stores, which mediate an increased calcium-dependent cytokine secretory response in inflamed airway epithelia (Martino et al. J Biol Chem 2009; 284:14904) . The present study addressed whether IRE1 is also functionally relevant for mucin production during airway inflammation. We first investigated the relative expression of the two IRE1 isoforms, \u03b1 and \u03b2. IRE1\u03b1 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas IRE1\u03b2 is only found in gut and upper and lower airway respiratory tissues. In freshly isolated HBE, IRE1\u03b2 expression was more than 30 fold higher than IRE1\u03b1 expression but was absent in primary human alveolar type II cells. Studies in primary cultures of HBE revealed a positive correlation between the mRNA levels of IRE1\u03b2 and MUC5B during the time course of epithelial differentiation. In mouse studies, IRE1\u03b2 expression was not detected in lung parenchyma but was 8.1 and 2.3 fold higher than IRE1\u03b1 expression in freshly isolated nasopharynx and trachea, tissues that exhibit higher levels of goblet cells. These findings led to the hypothesis that IRE1\u03b2 might be functionally relevant to airway mucin production. This hypothesis was tested by comparing the airway responses of IRE1\u03b2 -/vs. wild-type (wt) mice to ovalbumin (OVA) challenge. In wt mice, IRE1\u03b2 co-localized with the Clara cell secretory protein (CC10), which expression increases following an OVA challenge as it reflects goblet cell metaplasia. Notably, IRE1\u03b2 was not expressed in ciliated cells. In IRE1\u03b2 -/mice, the absence of IRE1\u03b2 in airway epithelia correlated with a lack of CC10 induction by OVA. Moreover, OVAincreased airway epithelial Muc5b and Muc16 production was blunted in IRE1\u03b2 -/vs. wt mice. Additional evidence for a role of IRE1\u03b2 related to mucin production was obtained by a decreased AB/PAS staining of goblet cells in nasopharynx epithelia from IRE1\u03b2 -/mice. Finally, XBP-1 splicing resulting from ER stress induced by thapsigargin was the same in primary cultures of control vs. IRE1\u03b2 -/mice, suggesting that IRE1\u03b2 function is not mediated by the XBP-1 UPR pathway. These novel findings suggest that IRE1\u03b2 exhibits a specific functional role in airway goblet cells, its action is distinct from IRE1\u03b1 and independent from XBP-1. We conclude that IRE1\u03b2 activation by airway inflammation-induced ER stress is a key functional epithelial response required for mucin production. Addressing the mechanism of IRE1\u03b2-mediated mucin production may lead to therapies targeting this pathway and benefit CF patients suffering from chronic airway inflammation and mucus overproduction.

Glucocorticoids (GC) are powerful anti-inflammatory molecules but of limited benefit in CF patients [Nichols DP et al.

These results confirm that miglustat has an anti-inflammatory effect in bronchial epithelial cells exposed to P. aeruginosa and demonstrate no impairment of the antimicrobial activity. In respect to dexamethasone, CF bronchial cells seem to be resistant to GC treatment, which, however has some adverse effects in reducing the antimicrobial activity.

            "text": "Kelley, T.; Shank, S.; Corey, D.; Ziady, A.G. Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA Nrf2 is a transcription factor that regulates the antioxidant response element and controls redox mediated inflammatory signaling. It is sequestered in the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus in response to increases in oxidants. In the nucleus, Nrf2 associates with a number of proteins that promote or diminish DNA binding and transcription. Previously, we investigated the role of Nrf2 on inflammation in a number of cell and animal CF models. Proteomics revealed decreases in antioxidant proteins (APs), especially peroxidases that are promoted by Nrf2, including thioredoxin (TRX) 1, peroxiredoxin (PRDX) 1, 3, 5, and 6, glutathione S-transferase (GST) 1 and 2, and catalase in CF cells and animals vs normal controls by >2 fold. Intracellular H 2 O 2 , a potent inducer of inflammatory cytokine production, was elevated by as much as 5 fold (when stimulated with TNF\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2) in CF vs normal. Despite increases in oxidants, Nrf2 activation is diminished in CF model cells as evidenced by proteomics and reporter gene analysis. This response is paradoxical, and is responsible for excessive inflammation. Therefore, we studied the activation of Nrf2 in CF. Increases in oxidants are expected to increase Nrf2 nuclear translocation, which is expected to occur normally in CF. However, once in the nucleus, Nrf2 must associate with a number of proteins to facilitate DNA transcription. One of these proteins is CREB binding protein (CBP). Reduced Nrf2 interaction with CPB diminishes its transcriptional activity by increasing its export from the nucleus. Based on previous studies that indicate an upregulation of cAMP signaling in CF cells, we hypothesized that increased phospho CREB (mediated by cAMP) binds CBP and prevents its interaction with Nrf2. We used the cAMP antagonist Rp-cAMPs, which competes with cAMP and blocks activation of its targets. First, we tested the effect of Rp-cAMPs on the expression of proteins regulated by Nrf2 using proteomic analysis. In 3 experiments, Rp-cAMPs significantly corrected (increased) the expression of TRX 1, PRDX 1, 3, 5, and 6, and GST 1 and 2 in the 9HTEo-pCEPR (CF) cells by an average of 4.1+0.8 fold towards normal. Rp-cAMPs decreased H 2 O 2 in 9HTEo-pCEPR cells by 3 fold to a level below that observed in normal cell pairs. This is consistent with an increase in Nrf2 activity and an increase in associated peroxidases. To examine the mechanism by which Rp-cAMPs activates Nrf2, we used Western blot analysis to assay CBP interaction with Nrf2. When we immunoprecipitated CBP and probed for Nrf2 in the 9HTEo-model cell pairs, we found that CBP interaction with Nrf2 was decreased by 62+5.2% in CF. This result was reproduced in nasal epithelia from \u2206F508 mice. Treatment of the CF model pCEPR cells with Rp-cAMPs reversed decreased CBP interaction by ~2.5 fold to levels only 23+6.2% below normal. We conclude, that in CF, upregulation of cAMP signaling diminishes CBP interaction with Nrf2, thereby decreasing its transcriptional activity in the nucleus. This phenomenon contributes to the paradoxical dysfunction of Nrf2, reducing antioxidant responses, and allowing for the accumulation of oxidants that promote inflammation in CF models.",

            "text": "Supported by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life limiting recessive disease in the U.S., and is due to mutations in the CFTR gene. CF mutations, of which the most common is \u2206F508-CFTR, cause massive proinflammatory phenotype in the lung, which is characterized by high levels of interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is the most powerful known biological attractant of neutrophils, which are called upon to mount a vigorous defense against bacterial invaders. However, even in the absence of bacterial invaders, as occurs, for example, in the lungs of newborn infants with CF, the sustained and spontaneous release of high levels of IL-8 and other related agents causes profound inflammatory damage. The mechanism by which IL-8 gene expression is dysregulated in CF is not known. Our data indicate that in CF, high levels of IL-8 protein are due in part to aberrantly low rates of degradation for the IL-8 mRNA. This mechanism involves the adenine and uridine rich sequences (AREs) in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the IL-8 message, which interact with specific ARE-binding proteins. These ARE-binding proteins modulate post-transcriptional processes including mRNA stability and translation of the message into functional protein. Our data suggest that tristetraprolin (TTP), a proto-typical ARE-binding protein, is principally responsible for controlling the stability of IL-8 mRNA. The initial and perhaps the rate limiting step in mRNA decay is the removal of the poly (A) tail from the 3'-end. This is accompanied by removal of the 5'cap structure and is ultimately followed by exonucleolytic (5'-3' and/or 3'-5') degradation of the mRNA body. TTP has been reported to cause enhanced decay of ARE-containing mRNAs by promoting enhanced deadenylation.",

            "text": "References : Intense inflammation marked by an accumulation of neutrophils in the lung mucosa occurs in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF). Chronic infection with various pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa likely contributes to lung inflammation associated with CF. Neutrophils are recruited to the airspace and breach the mucosal epithelial barrier in an attempt to eradicate P. aeruginosa residing in the airway lumen. Unfortunately, P. aeruginosa is highly resistant to neutrophilic attack and confrontation results in neutrophil release of noxious products culminating in lung tissue destruction. The precise mechanism by which neutrophils exit circulation, travel through multiple tissue compartments, and eventually migrate across the lung epithelial barrier remains to be fully elucidated. Using an in vitro model consisting of multiple cell types, we have previously reported a novel molecular mechanism whereby P. aeruginosa infection on the apical surface of polarized lung epithelial monolayers results in transmigration of neutrophils added to the opposite surface. This process is mediated by epithelial cell polarized secretion of the neutrophil chemo-attractant hepoxilin A 3 . Hepoxilin A 3 is a member of the eicosanoid class of bio-active lipids that is synthesized from arachidonic acid by the actions of a group of enzymes collectively known as 12-lipoxygenases. In the present study our objective was to determine which of the three known human 12-lipoxygenase genes (alox12, alox12B, and alox15) are expressed in lung epithelial cells, and whether expression is modulated by infection with P. aeruginosa. We observed that alox12 and alox15 are expressed under baseline conditions. Both alox12 (4-fold) and alox15 (2-fold) are slightly, but significantly induced upon infection with bacteria for 2 hours. Furthermore, treatment of lung epithelial cells with P. aeruginosa results in a significant increase in epithelial production of the 12-lipoxygenase pathway metabolite 12(S)-HETE. In conclusion, two enzymes capable of hepoxilin A 3 synthesis are expressed in lung epithelial cells and both expression and activity are increased in response to infection. Current efforts are underway to determine which enzyme is responsible for P. aeruginosa stimulated increases in 12-lipoxygenase activity, hepoxilin A 3 production, and neutrophil trans-epithelial migration. Deciphering molecular mechanisms that underlie this complex process may lead to development of more targeted anti-inflammatory therapeutics to alleviate neutrophil associated lung tissue damage.",

Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA Background: Vitamin D insufficiency is common among CF patients and may contribute to chronic bacterial colonization of the respiratory tract, leading to chronic inflammation and recurrent infections. Bacterial components like capsular polysaccharides (CPS) and endotoxin (LPS) are shed in large quantities in acutely infected CF lung. These bacterial ligands are potent activators of pattern recognition receptors, mainly Toll-like receptors (TLRs), expressed in host cells. In the normal lung, secreted anti-microbial peptides such as cathelicidin (LL-37) and effective mucociliary clearance serve as the first line of defense for the innate immune system. Controlled levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are required to alert the innate immune system but excessive release is adversarial to the host. The anti-microbial peptide, LL-37, is found to be significantly higher in induced sputum of CF subjects compared to healthy controls, suggesting impaired killing activity of LL-37 due to inactivation by CF sputum.

The addition of exogenous LL-37 resulted in dramatic attenuation of cytokine release in both 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 -and ethanol-treated macrophages. Similar results were seen in epithelial cells HEK/TLR4-MD2 and HEK/TLR2-6. Taken together, the data indicate that LL-37 dampens inflammation measured by TNF\u03b1 by neutralizing the stimulatory effect of TLR ligands. Treatment with 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 was not additive to LL-37 treatment in the reduction of macrophage derived TNF\u03b1.",

Applied Math, Chapel Hill, NC, USA The constant beating of cilia drives the mucus flow which maintains lung sterility. The interaction between the rapidly moving cilia tip and the viscoelastic mucus layer is largely unknown. However, it is critical for understanding the role of viscoelasticity in mucus clearance and the failure of clearance when mucus becomes too dehydrated. We are beginning to study these phenomena using driven microbead rheology where we place a magnetic micron-diameter bead into polymeric solutions and apply forces to generate dynamics representative of cilia. A spherical bead under constant force in a shear thinning entangled polymer solution experiences a sudden and substantial (>200%) increase in velocity. The earlier and slower steadystate behavior corresponds to known experimental work on transient viscosity overshoots (i.e. strain thickening) in polymer solutions during the startup of shear flow. We use a Stokes Flow continuum approach to model and characterize the instantaneous shear velocity in the field around the bead as it moves through an incompressible liquid. This velocity allows us to calculate the ubiquitous Weissenburg number (Wi) for a field around the bead. We can then determine the dynamic viscosity field and model the expected properties of the surrounding polymer solution. Finally, we consider cilia as a physiological system where this dynamic strain thickening phenomenon may be fundamentally important.",

In response to viral exposure, CF AECs produce significantly higher levels of IL-8 and IL-6 compared to healthy cells. As all of CF individuals partic-ipating in this study are associated with Class II mutation, it may suggest a CFTR-dependent exaggerated IL-8 response to RV exposure. This study also demonstrates the role CF AECs might play in initiating and exacerbating early innate response. Background: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has a significant impact on the overall quality of life of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Treatment strategies vary, but usually include a combination of sinus surgery, systemic and topical antibiotics/steroids, and nasal irrigations. Unfortunately, the indications, timing, and degree of surgical management and postoperative care are controversial. Many CF patients have had multiple sinus surgeries by the time they reach adulthood. The maxillary sinuses, in particular, are a recurrent problem area because normal mucociliary clearance transports against gravity toward the natural ostium. Mucopurulence filling the inferior half of the maxillary cavities is common despite \"adequate\" maxillary antrostomies. The endoscopic medial maxillectomy (EMM) procedure presented here involves removal of the medial maxillary wall, essentially marsupializing the maxillary sinus into the nasal cavity. This permits physical debridement of mucus in clinic, improved clearance of mucus with nasal irrigations, and increased access for topical delivery of therapeutics. However, surgery is only one part of an overall treatment strategy. The clinical effects of aggressive sinus surgery, proactive clinic debridements, and regimented medical treatment with prolonged intravenous antibiotics and steroids during the healing process have yet to be elucidated. The purpose of the current study was to establish a treatment protocol for severe, recalcitrant CF CRS. Our primary outcome measure was whether patients had improvement in symptoms at an 8 week follow-up interval.",

Ongoing prospective follow-up is necessary to determine whether this treatment paradigm will decrease pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis. Background: CF lung disease results from a failure of pulmonary innate immune functions. This includes loss of airway antibacterial activity, reduced mucociliary clearance, and failure of immune mechanisms to successfully opsonize and kill bacteria. Cellular inflammation in the CF airway is marked by very high levels of neutrophils. These neutrophils have been attracted into the lung, from the peripheral circulation, by Interleukin-8 (IL-8) which is hypersecreted by CF epithelial cells. We have conjectured that the proteomic and genomic signature of CF neutrophils might generate direct endpoints for both prognosis and therapy. A recent study by Karp and colleagues has identified a protein that is expressed during terminal neutrophil differentiation as an important modifier gene for CF. Surprisingly, Cavaillon and colleagues have shown that airway and peripheral blood neutrophils have similar gene expression patterns. This suggests that the study of neutrophils from the circulation could lead to mechanistic insights into CF pathophysiology. The less intrusive approach of obtaining these cells from the peripheral circulation is attractive from a practical and clinical point of view.",

The first isoform is predicted to produce a short deletion (from aa 831 to 872) of a cytoplasmic portion spanning between the R domain and the seventh transmembrane segment whereas the second one generates a half-CFTR (truncation after the R domain). Biochemical analysis performed on transiently transfected HeLa cells revealed a truncated protein at the expected size for E831X-CFTR while CFTR del(831-873) generated a coreglycosylated protein. Strikingly, when both mutant proteins were coexpressed, mimicking the endogenous state, a strong fully-glycosylated CFTR band appears at 37\u221eC without any further treatment. Additionally, co-immunoprecipitation experiments performed with a C-terminal antibody enabled detection of truncated E831X-CFTR. These data suggest an interaction between both proteins inducing a rescuing mechanism of CFTR del(831-873) by E831X-CFTR. The ability of this isoform to correct misprocessed CFTR proteins will be evaluated on F508del-CFTR and other class II mutants. It is still uncertain which isoform bears functional activity accounting for the very mild phenotype observed. E831X-CFTR has been previously described as a functional mutant in Xenopus oocytes (Schreiber et al.

The search for genetic modifiers of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease requires a phenotype measure that accurately categorizes disease severity across all ages, and ideally across different study populations and ascertainment schemes. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second as a percent of predicted based on height, age, and sex (FEV1pp) is a clinically useful and relevant measure of lung disease severity relative to a \"normal\" or background population. However, the same FEVpp value indicates different levels of CF severity at different ages (eg FEVpp=50 in a 10 year old signals severe disease, while in a 40 year old it is quite mild). Age-specific percentiles of FEV1 among CF patients have also been developed (Kulich et al. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2005;172:885) which indicate CF lung disease severity relative to other CF patients. The 50th percentile for a 10 year old or a 40 year old indicates average lung function compared to other surviving CF patients, but clearly the 10 year old has more severe lung disease. We propose a new lung phenotype that accounts for the progressive decline of lung function as well as the increasing mortality attrition with increasing age. Using information obtained from the Canadian CF Patient Data Registry (CPDR) we determined survival probabilities to Dec 31, 2002 for each birth year cohort from 1973 to 2002, i.e. from 0 to 30 years of age. For ages over 30 years a logarithmic curve was fit through birth cohort survival estimates based on Canadian live births and CF patients reported alive in the 2002 CPDR. The CPDR survival estimates matched closely with estimates from the US CF Registry which were available up to age 22 years. To calculate the new phenotype for an individual patient, the mean value of available CF age-specific FEV1 percentile scores over a 3 year period was adjusted by the survival percentile corresponding to the mean age of measurements for that patient. This produced a cohort percentile for each patient relative to others who had lower lung function or had died. The new phenotype was computed for 1437 CF patients with pancreatic insufficiency (PI) in the Canadian CF Modifier Study, 1162 deltaF508 homozygous patients with mild or severe lung function in the US CF(UNC/CWRU) Modifier Study, and 1179 CF PI patients in the US CF Sibling and Twin Study. In all 3 groups, the new phenotype was highly correlated with previous phenotypes based on models of longitudinal lung function and predicted age at death (Schluchter et al.) . These complex models require many years of prospective follow-up and produce estimates for an individual that depend on the make-up of the study group included in analyses. The relative ease of computing Kulich CF percentiles and the stable population based survival estimates from the CPDR make the new phenotype easy to implement and most importantly, independent of the study group milieu. Application of the new phenotype in genome wide association analysis will ensure the comparability of results in the different modifier study designs.

Family-based association analysis was performed in 136 families participating in the CF Twin and Sibling Study (CFTSS) in which at least one child had MI. All subjects were pancreatic insufficient (n=269). A cluster of SNPs within the methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MSRA) gene showed association with MI. The highest association was observed for rs11783705, which had an uncorrected p-value of 2.5x10 -5 that nearly achieved region-wide significance. We then tested haplotypes composed of up to 8 consecutive SNPs for association with MI in a 1.85 Mb region containing the MSRA gene. A 3-SNP haplotype (rs10903323 T -rs4840475 G -rs17151637 A; frequency, 0.15) spanning a 3.5 kb region in intron 3 of MSRA was identified as being protective against MI (p=3.1x10 -7 ).

Haplotypes were derived using an estimation-maximization method and case-control analysis showed that homozygosity for the T-G-A haplotype was protective against MI (p=0.02). Odds ratios were constructed to assess the difference in risk between subjects with two copies of the protective haplotype and those with no copies. In the CFTSS and GMSG cohorts, respectively, subjects homozygous for the T-G-A haplotype had 7.2-fold (95% CI, 1.3-72; p=0.016) and 9.5-fold (95% CI, 1.2-427; p=0.035) reduced odds of MI than subjects not carrying this haplotype.",

Although the household environment was found to make less of an impact than unique environmental factors, this may be less applicable to families with a single member with CF.

The heritability estimates generated by siblings alone were 0.80 for the larger CFTSS group and 0.88 in the CCCGS group.

Our aim was to evaluate the relation between the presence of CFTR mutations and the degree of nasal transepithelial transport dysfunction in such patients. Nasal potential difference (NPD) was measured in 120 patients with DB of unknown origin, without pancreatic insufficiency and with a normal sweat test ([Cl-] < 60 mmol/L). Extensive CFTR genotype analysis was performed and patients were classified according to the presence of CFTR mutations: none (DB-0), one (DB-1) and 2 mutations (DB-2). In this DB-2 group with normal sweat test and 2 mutations, one mutation at least was classified as mild (class IV or V) or variant, and patients were diagnosed as having cystic fibrosis (CF). A control group comprised 92 classic CF patients with an abnormal sweat test ([Cl-] \u2265 60 mmol/L) and 2 identified CFTR mutations: \"severe-CF\" patients were homozygous for the F508del mutation and \"mild-CF\" patients carried at least one \"mild\" mutation. Results are shown in the table below. Nasal ion transport was normal in DB-0 group. However, in DB-1 group, the Wilschanski's index (which takes into account the different variables measured by NPD) was significantly increased, as compared with the one observed in DB-0 group. Moreover, as the number and/or the severity of CFTR mutations increased from DB-1 to severe-CF, the degree of ion transport dysfunction increased in nasal epithelium and in sweat glands also. These results show a close relation between the severity of CFTR genotype and ion transport dysfunction in DB, both in the nasal epithelium and in sweat glands. One may speculate that the slight abnormal airway ion transport due to the presence of one CFTR mutation may contribute to the development of bronchiectasis if associated with another yet unidentified genetic or environmental factor.",

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is usually diagnosed by a sweat test showing increased chloride concentration. However, new technologies that easily and rapidly show abnormal sweat chloride concentrations are of interest since they would allow performance of the time-consuming and skill-demanding sweat test to be restricted to selected patients. EZscan\u00ae is a new patented technology using increasing low direct current voltages (<4V) generating reverse iontophoresis. It allows measurements of electrochemical skin conductance (ESC) which is linked to the ion with the highest physiological concentration in sweat, i.e. chloride. Our aim was to compare this new concept of quick, non invasive ESC measurement to the classical sweat test. EZscan\u00ae was performed in 41 adult patients with classical CF (16 F, 25 M; mean age\u00b1sd: 28\u00b19 yrs) and in 20 healthy control patients (10 F, 10 M; mean age\u00b1sd: 25\u00b110 yrs). ESC was measured by the means of electrodes on each hand and each foot and expressed in \u00b5Siemens (\u00b5Si). At low voltages (<2V), ESC was analyzed. At the highest voltage (4V), there was a change of ESC that was expressed as dESC, i.e. the difference between the conductance observed at 4V and ESC at low voltages. Sweat stimulation was performed on the forearm by pilocarpine iontophoresis and sweat was then collected on a filter paper. Sweat chloride was measured by colorimetry. Both ESC and dESC were significantly different in CF patients, as compared with control patients: ESC measurements were on the hands: 73\u00b114 \u00b5Si and 61\u00b115 \u00b5Si (p<0.01), and on the feet: 75\u00b110 and 62\u00b113 \u00b5Si (p=0.0001) in CF and control patients, respectively. dESC measurements were on the hands: 9\u00b117 \u00b5Si and 49\u00b131 \u00b5Si (p<0.0001), and on the feet: 34\u00b121 \u00b5Si and 93\u00b124 \u00b5Si (p<0.0001) in CF and control patients, respectively. Chloride concentrations as measured by the sweat test were: 95\u00b115 mmol/L and 19\u00b17 mmol/L in CF and control patients, respectively (p<0.0001). There was a significant correlation between dESC and chloride concentration as measured by sweat test (r=-0.78; p<0.0001). dESC diagnostic performance was analyzed by ROC curve modelisation (a cut-off<60 \u00b5Si predicts CF). dESC measurement provided a diagnostic specificity of 0.93, a sensitivity of 0.95 and a diagnostic performance as assessed by the area under ROC curve of 0.94. EZscan\u00ae appears an attractive tool for easy screening of patients with symptoms evocative of CF: it requires no patient preparation, no medical personnel training; it provides a quick measurement (less than 2 min) and an immediate reading of the results. A study of EZscan\u00ae in children will soon be undertaken. ",

We hypothesised that cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with the G551D mutation would have less severe disease than those F508del homozygotes. We compared the clinical phenotype of patients with a G551D mutation (class 3) with patients homozygous for F508del (class 2) and those with the missense mutation R117H (class 4). Including the R117H mutation allowed a comparison across three mutation groups to be established. Compound heterozygotes for the G551D and R117H were analysed separately. Data were collected for 101 adult CF patients. Group 1-4 represents in order F508del homozygote patients (n=61), those with the G551D mutation (n=13), those with the R117H mutation (n=23) and those compound for both the R117H and G551D mutations (n=4). In the case of categorical variables, binary logistic regression analysis was used to compare group 1 with each of the other three groups and univariate analysis of variance with age as a covariate for the continuous variables. Fisher's Exact test was used to establish any association between genotype and gender. Our findings demonstrate that patients with the G551D mutation and a second severe mutation have a milder clinical phenotype than F508del homozygous patients. Compound heterozygosity for G551D and R117H mutations was associated with normal spirometry, body mass index, no chronic infection and no symptoms. In this context it is possible that mutations on different chromosomes are not independent of each other for the overall impact on phenotype. Interpreting the combination of mutations as opposed to simply accepting the milder mutation as dominant is more appropriate. Objective: In 2006, the American College of Medical Genetics recommended the inclusion of cystic fibrosis (CF) in the Newborn Screening Uniform Core Panel. CF screening in most regions first analyzes immunoreactive trypsinogen and, when elevated, employs a second-tier mutational screen of the CFTR gene. CDC's Newborn Screening Quality Assurance Program (NSQAP) offers proficiency testing (PT) for screening programs that employ CFTR mutation detection. The PT specimens are prepared from CF donor blood. We undertook the validation of CF center genotypes and extensive characterization of a subset of these PT specimens for single nucleotide changes, small insertions and deletions, and large insertions and deletions.",

These 32 sequence variants were used to predict haplotypes from the 98 chromosomes using the two major haplotype blocks defined by the HapMap data (breakpoint of two blocks in exon 10). Interestingly, 29 of the 30 F508del-containing chromosomes showed an identical haplotype across both blocks.

Lung infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) or mucoid Pa (MPa) was also established using 4 other criteria: chronic (three positive cultures within six months each one month apart), multiple (3 times within the subject's lifetime), persistent (2 out of 3 cultures positive from cultures obtained in 3 consecutive years) and current (positive culture within three months of the last clinic visit). The contribution of CFTR genotype to infection was assessed in two ways: \u2206F508 homozygotes compared to all other genotypes; and \u2206F508 heterozygotes with a class 1, 2 or 3 mutation compared to \u2206F508 heterozygotes with a class 4 or 5 mutation. The contribution of other genes was derived by concordance and regression analysis of 48 monozygous (MZ) twin pairs and 114 dizygous (DZ) twins or sibling pairs. Measurements and Main results: Odds of infection for 4 organisms (Pa, MPa, Aspergillus (Asp), and Escherichia coli (Ec)) were higher in patients homozygous for \u2206F508 compared to other genotypes (OR (95% CI): Pa 2.29 (1.58, 3.32); MPa 1.38 (1.02, 1.88); Asp 1.34 (1.01, 1.78); Ec 1.57 (1.12, 2.19) ). Eight organisms had higher odds of infection in \u2206F508 heterozygotes with a class 1, 2 or 3 mutation compared to \u2206F508 heterozygotes with a class 4 or 5 mutation (OR (95% CI): Pa: 8.47 (3.77, 19 .02); MPa: 4.33 (2.12, 8.85 ); methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSa): 3.18 (1.46, 6.93); Asp: 4.02 (1.64, 9.84) ; Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (Sm): (4.32 (1.93, 9.71) ; Achromobacter xylosoxidans (Ax): 6.08 (1.85, 19 .98); Ec: 18.06 (2.38, 136.98) ; and Klebsiella pneumonia (Kp): 4.48, 1.34, 15.00)). Concordance rates for Pa or MPa did not differ between MZ twins and DZ twins and siblings for any of the 5 definitions of infection. Of the remaining organisms, only absence of Asp and Kp were more concordant in MZ twins compared to DZ twin/sibling pairs (p = 0.001 and 0.04, respectively). Regression analysis confirmed that MZ twins were less likely than DZ/siblings to have a co-twin infected with Asp (p = 0.046) or Kp (p = 0.041).",

Taking progression of these discriminative lung function parameters into account, best pulmonary outcome can be predicted for genotypes with at least one missense mutation and both mutations localized in MSD2 and/or NBD2, and worst prognosis was associated with genotypes composed by one inframe mutation in NBD1 (mainly F508del) and one frameshift mutation in NBD2 (mainly 3905ins T). Strongest progression (slope), however, was observed for genotypes including one inframe (mainly F508del) and one nonsense mutation (mainly R553X) both located in NBD1.",

Gene arrays provide a uniquely unbiased survey of the biological state, enabling scientists to identify patterns of change in gene expression that lead to new insights. Though unbiased and potentially powerful, gene array results are inherently ambiguous: in different hands, the same data yield strikingly different interpretations. Broadly speaking, most practitioners identify differentially expressed genes as those with extremely small P values in a statistical test. An alternative practice, recommended by the FDA's microarray quality control project (MAQC), involves selecting genes on the basis of both fold change and P value, using a less restrictive P value threshold. Using four publicly available experiments (1-4) that measured gene expression differences between cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF human airway epithelial cells, we compared the two techniques. We found that gene selection on the basis of P value alone generated results that were less repro-ducible than those selected by considering both P value and fold change. Computer simulations demonstrated how consideration of both factors increases concordance. We used the MAQC gene selection approach in an integrated analysis of the four publicly available cystic fibrosis data sets comparing the CF genotype in human airway epithelia to non-CF controls. The analysis did not support the generally accepted hypothesis that the NFkB inflammatory pathway is up-regulated in CF, but revealed that antigen presentation pathway genes, including major histocompatibility complex genes such as HLA-F and HLA-G previously identified by Wright (3), were down-regulated in CF. The identification of this pathway is consistent with clinical observations in CF that the immune response is compromised, and should facilitate research interest in the antigen presentation pathway in CF.",

Integration of molecular and clinical information in the quantitative framework can provide insights leading to diagnostic/prognostic panels in clinical setting and pathogenetically aimed and personalized treatment in CF. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which when mutated causes cystic fibrosis (CF), encompasses nearly 200 kb of genomic DNA at chromosome 7q31.2. It is flanked by two genes ASZ1 and CTTNBP2, which have very different expression profiles. CFTR is expressed primarily in specialized epithelial cells, while ASZ1 is transcribed exclusively in the testis and ovary, and CTTNBP2 is highly expressed in the brain, kidney and pancreas, with lower levels of expression in other tissues. Despite its highly regulated pattern of expression, the promoter of the CFTR gene apparently lacks the necessary elements to achieve this. We previously suggested that cis-acting regulatory elements elsewhere in the locus, both flanking the gene and within introns, were required to coordinate regulated, tissue-specific expression of CFTR. We identified a number of crucial elements, including enhancer-blocking insulators flanking the locus, intronic tissue-specific enhancers and also characterized some of the interacting proteins. We recently employed a high-resolution method of mapping DNase Ihypersensitive sites (DHS) using tiled microarrays. DHS are often associated with regulatory elements and use of this technique generated cell-specific profiles of potential regulatory sequences in primary cells and cell lines. We characterized a set of cis-acting elements within the CFTR locus and demonstrated direct physical interaction between them and the CFTR promoter, by chromosome conformation capture (3C). These data provide the first insight into the 3D structure of the active CFTR gene.",

The main cause of morbidity and mortality in CF is due to inflammation and chronic infections of the respiratory tract.

There is a low correlation between the type of mutation in the CFTR gene and the clinical features of patients, thus studies of environmental and genetic factors could contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. The ACE gene encodes the angiotensin-converting enzyme, which is related to the pro-inflammatory response of the lung parenchyma of CF patients. This gene presents a polymorphism denominated D/I, the D allele is characterized by the deletion of 287pb in intron 16 and responsible for a higher gene expression.",

Functional replacement of CFTR by MRP1 has been previously suggested. We investigated the possible association of MRP1 promoter 5'FR/G-260C polymorphism with severity of CF disease. One hundred thirty non-CF subjects and 234 CF patients homozygous for F508del mutation were genotyped by snapshot: no significantly different allelic frequencies between groups were found. Association of polymorphism with disease severity as assessed by FEV1, BMI, diabetes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) chronic infection was not statistically significant. The CC genotype tended to be linked to higher rate of chronic colonization by PA as well as with earlier chronic colonization by PA but these trends did not reach statistical significance. Allelic frequencies in 20 CF patients were not in relation with MRP1 mRNA levels and basal/cAMPstimulated anion conductance in nasal epithelial cells.

The identification of nucleotide substitutions affecting exon recognition will give a better understanding of CFTR RNA processing and will lead to reconsideration of some neutral variants as diseasecausing, thus improving diagnosis accuracy. This work was supported by public grants from INSERM, EC Grant NEUPROCF (LSHG-CT-2005-512044) The CFTR sequence variant 1811+1.6kbA>G, or more specifically 1811+1634A>G, has been reported as a mutation that causes severe cystic fibrosis (CF) with pancreatic insufficiency (Reboul MP et al. J Med Genet 2002; 39:e73) . This mutation creates a new donor splice site in intron 11 that produces a new exon of 49bp between exons 11 and 12, so-called exon 11b (Chillon M et al. Am J Hum Genet 1995; 56:623) . In this study, we report a novel sequence variant, 1811+1643G>T, located only 9bp downstream from the 1811+1.6kbA>G mutation. We detected this novel mutation in 11 unrelated CF patients from a pool of diagnostic samples analyzed between January 2007 and March 2009 by gene sequence analysis. All 11 patients are of Hispanic descent. One is homozygous for the mutation and the other 10 carry a second known CF mutation (three 3876delA, two Delta F508, and one each D1152H, G1244E, G542X, P205S, 3199del6). There were 587 unrelated Hispanic families in this pool, which makes the frequency of this allele approximately 1% (12/1174) in the Hispanic population. Clinical data from the 11 patients indicate that 1811+1643G>T is a deleterious mutation with varying age of onset depending on the severity of the second mutation. For example, one patient whose second mutation is D1152H, was diagnosed only with infertility (azoospermia) and pneumonia at the age of 43. Similarly to 1811+1.6kbA>G, the G to T substitution at 1811+1643 likely creates a new donor splice site, 4bp further downstream, which would produce a new exon of 53bp. CFTR-cDNA studies are currently underway. The diminishing splicing efficiency that is associated with increasing numbers (>11) of (TG) repeats in the CFTR IVS8-(TG)m(T)n haplotype results in decreasing production of functional CFTR protein. We sought to determine whether the number of (TG) repeats at the (TG)(T)5 locus of hypertrypsinogenemic (HT) infants with genotype \u2206F508/5T (\u2206F508 in trans with only a 5T allele and no other known CFTR mutation) correlated with biochemical (immunoreactivetrypsinogen, IRT) and physiological (sweat chloride, SC) measurements. In addition, we explored the correlation between the IVS8 Poly T length (5T, 7T or 9T), when in trans with \u2206F508, and IRT.",

Increasing IRT with decreasing Poly T length supports the observation that the 5T allele can impact biochemical status. Further study is warranted to determine the role of testing for this locus in the assessment of infants with an unclear diagnosis following, or as part of, CF NBS. Synonymous or \"silent\" genetic polymorphisms (i.e. exonic alterations that do not change amino acid sequence) can influence function in ATP binding cassette proteins (e.g., p-glycoprotein, Science 315, 525-528). When high usage codons are substituted for others that utilize less prevalent tRNAs, the timing of polypeptide assembly (cotranslational folding) may be altered and confer functional protein defects. In the present study, we initiated a search for synonymous polymorphisms in CFTR that may have clinical significance and/or contribute to CF-related pathogenesis. In particular, we investigated \"silent\" CFTR polymorphisms in the setting of congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD). CBAVD has been viewed as a mild CF phenotype, and provides a useful perspective from which to evaluate subtle defects in CFTR that could contribute to clinical abnormalities. In addition, because 70% of CBAVD subjects carry at least one defective CFTR allele, but millions of males worldwide are heterozygous for CFTR defects without developing CBAVD, silent polymorphisms could serve as modifiers that underlie vas deferens involution when only a single (non-synonomous) CFTR defect is detected by conventional genotyping. A large CFTR genotype repository (Ambry Genetics, Aliso Viejo, CA) was used to analyze over 5,000 chromosomes, primarily tested as part of CF carrier screening. A prototypic synonymous mutation (P1290P) was observed in 0.82% of CFTR alleles, and selected for further evaluation from among a larger panel of \"silent\" allelic alterations. We conducted studies of P1290P by cloning the mutant cDNA (4002 A-G) into expression constructs and completed a comprehensive CFTR analysis that included studies of Band C formation, maturational efficiency, limited proteolysis (to evaluate conformation), surface localization, macropatch channel behavior, and fluorescent dye halide efflux assays. These measures of P1290P were largely comparable to wildtype, with the possible exception of a defect in P1290P gating that is being further investigated. The studies provide a framework from which synonymous CFTR mutations can be tested for their contribution to clinical phenotype. Other \"silent\" mutations identified in our screen are being analyzed by the approaches and methodologies described here.",

The association between the clinical manifestations of cystic fibrosis (CF) and causative cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene mutations is continually undergoing investigation. We present a case study with genetic analysis of a unique family as well as retrospective analysis of clinical laboratory sequencing data in order to enhance the literature with regard to the specific CFTR promoter variant, c.-755C>T (also known as -816C>T). This variant was first described by Bienvenu et. al. in 1993, as documented in the Toronto Sick Kids Cystic Fibrosis Mutation Database. The variant was identified in a 45 year-old male with moderate lung disease, bronchiectasis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization. No other variant was identified. We describe a 10 year-old African American female who presented with failure to thrive, pancreatic insufficiency, weight loss and vomiting. Sweat chloride levels were measured at 63 and 63 mEq/L for the first attempt and, upon repeat 2 months later, were 48 and 50 mEq/L. Comprehensive CFTR sequence analysis revealed only one variant, c.-755C>T. We also detected this same variant in one half sibling. The sibling was asymptomatic and had sweat chloride levels of 11 and 9 mEq/L. A second half sibling had no variant identified, however the sweat chloride levels were 38 and 42 mEq/L. No other identifiable CFTR mutations have been detected for this family. c.-755C>T has been detected in combination with known diseasecausing mutations as well as in the absence of other mutations. This variant has also been detected in almost 1% of over 10,000 studies (S. Keiles, Ambry Genetics), most of whom did not carry a second disease causing mutation. In addition, three families who did carry a second mutation, deltaF508 identified by newborn screening, had very normal sweat tests of 10-13 mEq/L and presented with no symptoms (S. Keiles, Ambry Genetics). Other researchers identify c.-755C>T as non-disease causing (Cardoso et al. 2004; Romey et al. 1999 ). Based on this information and the frequency of the c.-755C>T variant, it is likely to represent a common disease causing polymorphism and not a deleterious mutation. The cause of the symptoms for this family are most likely not CFTR related. Lung disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in CF but its variability among CF patients cannot be attributed to CFTR genotype. Heritability studies indicate that variation in CF lung function measures is influenced by genetic modifiers. Linkage analysis can aid identification of genetic modifiers by detecting genomic regions that are shared in siblings with similar lung function measures.",

Among more than 1500 clinically important mutations identified in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the most prevalent involves deletion of phenylalanine at CFTR position 508 (\u2206F508). The \u2206F508 mutation confers CFTR misfolding, and leads to retention in the endoplasmic reticulum, enhanced degradation, and consequent loss of functional Clchannels in epithelial membranes. Studies to identify small molecules that correct \u2206F508 folding defects and enhance surface localization of \u2206F508-CFTR have been viewed as priority. However, high throughput screens based on functional assays that measure CFTR dependent Cltransport have often failed to identify consistent \"correctors\" of \u2206F508-CFTR misprocessing due to methodologic limitations. In the present study, we developed a novel, cell-based imaging assay that enables high throughput screens to identify small molecule correctors of \u2206F508-CFTR using the Evotec Opera\u2122, an automated confocal microscope system. This assay is designed to semi-quantitatively estimate surface localization of \u2206F508-CFTR through an analysis of two-dimensional images in permeabilized cells labeled with antibodies that recognize internal CFTR epitopes. We used the imaging technology and 3G11 rat monoclonal antibody (www.cftrfolding.org) for epitope recognition of nucleotide binding domain 1, and to detect surface localization of \u2206F508-CFTR expressed in HeLa cells. The assay established enhanced surface localization of \u2206F508-CFTR specifically after low temperature treatment at 27 o C for 48 hours. In addition, treatment with the chemical corrector Corr-4a (10 \u00b5M for 24 hours) resulted in much higher \u2206F508-CFTR signals (approximately 2.6 fold) at the plasma membrane compared with vehicle control (0.1 % DMSO), whereas rescue of \u2206F508-CFTR to the cell surface was negligible following 24 hour treatment with CFTR potentiators genistein (50 \u00b5M) or UC CF -152 (10 \u00b5M). Enhanced surface localization of \u2206F508-CFTR was confirmed by rescue of fully glycosylated \u2206F508-CFTR (Band C) as judged by Western blotting and recovery of cAMP-dependent Cltransport after treatment with low temperature or Corr-4a. Recent findings with small molecules such as VX-770 suggest that responses of mutant CFTR in primary airway epithelial cells may predict effectiveness in human subjects. We are therefore optimizing the assay system for analysis of \u2206F508-CFTR in polarizing airway cell monolayers. Our results indicate that automated confocal imaging is well suited for multi-well plate configurations, and can quantitatively measure surface localization of \u2206F508-CFTR. This method will provide a means for drug discovery of \u2206F508-CFTR correctors that ultimately could be useful for the therapy of cystic fibrosis.",

Antibody reagents capable of monitoring dynamic changes in the CFTR folded state are not currently available, but would be useful for studies of cystic fibrosis (CF) cellular biology and/or disease mechanism. One of the barriers to generating conformationally selective reagents stems from difficulties encountered by laboratories attempting to synthesize and purify sufficient amounts of full length CFTR for use as immunogen. In order to obtain adequate protein, CFTR with a C-terminal histidine tag was expressed under the regulatory control of the doxycycline inducible promoter. Large scale protein synthesis following induction was achieved in bioreactors with a yield of ~ 2 -8 pg/cell. This capacity enables milligram quantities of protein purification for antibody production (~0.1 -0.3 mg CFTR per billion induced cells). In order to minimize immune tolerance, the purified protein was inoculated into CFTR -/-(knock-out) mice. Lymphocytes from immunized mice were fused to the HGPRT-deficient mouse myeloma line P3X63-Ag8.653 to generate hybridomas. One hundred forty-six mouse hybridoma clonal supernatants were screened for the ability to recognize WT-CFTR by cell-based ELISA under various cell permeabilization conditions, including mild fixation intended to maintain a native CFTR structural configuration in the plasma membrane. We also assessed each monoclonal for the propensity to detect denatured WT-CFTR by Western blotting. Nine clones have been identified that selectively recognize epitopes in the putative \"native\" but not denatured CFTR configuration. Six hybridomas appear specific for epitopes that are accessible in denatured (but not properly folded) CFTR, and others are positive for both experimental conditions. We plan to characterize CFTR epitope binding sites of all positive hybridomas in the panel. We will also determine the ability of the new reagents to recognize \u2206F508-CFTR, with or without rescue by low temperature (or chemical correction). Identification of conformationally sensitive antibodies will provide a critical research tool and help elucidate mechanisms underlying CFTR misfolding. In addition, antibodies that discriminate properly refolded \u2206F508-CFTR can be used to optimize and prioritize drug discovery efforts in the future.",

Abnormalities in the pulmonary circulation are common in conditions associated with hypoxemia, such as cystic fibrosis (CF), and can lead to pulmonary hypertension (PH) and cor pulmonale, which often worsen prognosis. Multiple factors, such as air trapping, hypoxic vasoconstriction, protease/antiprotease imbalance, loss of capillary bed, and endothelial dysfunction, can contribute to the development of PH in CF. However, the molecular determinants of susceptibility to PH remain elusive. In Scnn1b-Tg mice, airway-targeted overexpression of the \u03b2 subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (\u03b2ENaC protein, Scnn1b gene) recapitulates many of the pathological features of human CF pulmonary disease, including airway surface dehydration, impaired mucus clearance and chronic neutrophilic inflammation. Our efforts aimed at identifying modifier genes of lung pathology in congenic Scnn1b-Tg mice led us to discover that, in selected strains, airway mucus obstruction was associated with surrogate markers of PH. In congenic C3H/HeN Scnn1b-Tg mice, airway mucus obstruction was associated with poor survival (20% compared to 80% for congenic C57Bl/6N Scnn1b-Tg mice), histological evidence of pulmonary hemorrhage and a high incidence (10/11 at day 5, 8/8 at day 10, 8/8 at 4 weeks, and 10/10 at 8 weeks of age) of blood contamination in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). These findings were corroborated by the presence of hemosiderin-laden macrophages -an indicator of previous/ongoing hemorrhage -in the lung parenchyma of surviving mice (3/10 at 10 days, 2/7 at 4 weeks, and 6/11 at 8 weeks of age). Pulmonary hemorrhage was also observed in congenic BALB/cJ Scnn1b-Tg, which also exhibit very low survival, but not in the C57Bl/6N Scnn1b-Tg strain. Intrigued by this novel phenotype, we sought to identify the cause of pulmonary hemorrhage in C3H/HeN Scnn1b-Tg mice and evaluate whether the mice were developing PH, which can be associated with pulmonary hemorrhage in human pulmonary diseases. Strikingly, 9 day-old C3H/HeN Scnn1b-Tg mice already exhibited increased heart/body weight ratio (0.005 for Scnn1b-Tg mice vs. 0.008 for WT littermates, p=0.0064) and right ventricular enlargement (7/8), as assessed histologically and by two-dimensional echocardiographic scan. Importantly, pulmonary hemorrhage and right ventricular enlargement were absent in C57Bl/6N Scnn1b-Tg mice. The inflammatory infiltrate profile was similar between resistant C57Bl/6N and susceptible C3H/HeN strains. These data strongly suggest that C3H/HeN Scnn1b-Tg mice develop PH, whereas C57Bl/6N Scnn1b-Tg mice do not. The availability of congenic strains with either susceptible or resistant phenotypes will allow us to use wide-range genetic approaches to identify heritable factors that determine protection or susceptibility to PH associated with airway mucus obstruction.",

While progress has been made in patient care, our understanding of key events in the early onset and progression of CF lung disease are lacking, in part because these events occur in infants and young children. The porcine model of CF provides a unique opportunity to investigate the lung phenotype as it evolves. At birth, neonatal CFTR-/-pigs lack pulmonary lesions commonly associated with CF disease including cellular inflammation, submucosal gland hypertrophy, or obstructive lesions. In CFTR+/+ neonatal pigs, the submucosal glands were most evident in the trachea, where mucin immunostaining reveal MUC5AC to be localized mostly in goblet cells of the surface epithelium with rare staining in submucosal glands, and MUC5B detected principally in submucosal glands with some goblet cell staining in the superficial epithelium. CFTR+/and CFTR-/-pigs show similar MUC5AC/5B distributions. Bronchoalveolar lavage of CFTR-/-pigs 6 -12 hrs after birth showed no significant difference from CFTR+/+ pigs in total cell counts or cytokine levels. We performed large scale transcript profiling in lung tissue and airway epithelia using an Affymetrix\u00ae porcine genechip. Unsupervised hierarchal clustering of microarray data comparing the mRNA expression profiles of alveolar, bronchus, and tracheal tissue failed to distinguish samples based on genotype. Furthermore, microarray analysis of airway epithelial primary cultures revealed few significant differences in gene expression between the four genotypes studied: CFTR+/+, CFTR-/-, CFTR+/-and CFTR-/\u2206F508. Analysis of selected candidate genes detected as differentially expressed is ongoing. These data suggest that the lung phenotypes of neonatal CFTR-/and CFTR+/+ pigs are very similar. Furthermore, while there is little evidence of infection or inflammation in the neonatal CF pig lung, a prospective analysis of animals of different ages and disease states may provide mechanistic insights. We hypothesize that cystic fibrosis (CF)-causing CFTR mutations are present in dogs. To test this hypothesis, large numbers of domestic dogs are currently being screened for the presence of CFTR mutations by using temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE). To increase the probability of detecting CF-causing mutations, the screening population includes animals with disorders that in humans harbor relatively high frequencies of CFTR mutations (i.e., idiopathic bronchiectasis and pancreati-tis). Three different categories of dogs were screened: 167 at-large animals, 147 animals diagnosed with pancreatitis, and 12 animals diagnosed with bronchiectasis. From these animals, one of four CFTR missense mutations (R812W, P1281T, R1456W, and P1464H) were found in each of 27 dogs. The R812W mutation, which does not have a specific human analog, is in a highly conserved region of the CFTR regulatory domain. This mutation site is flanked by several highly-conserved residues that are the sites of CFcausing or congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD)-causing missense mutations in humans. Although position 1281 is weakly conserved among species, the P1281T mutation is in a conserved region of the second nucleotide-binding domain (NBD2). The canine CFTR R1456W mutation is analogous to the human R1453W mutation, which has been associated with pancreatitis and panbronchiolitis. The P1464H mutation has not been documented in humans and is in a poorly conserved region of the carboxy terminus. Overall missense mutation frequency was 1 in 12.1 dogs, with the most prevalent mutation, R1456W, occurring in 1 in 23.3 dogs. Mutation frequency was approximately twice as great in the pancreatitis and bronchiectasis animals as in the at-large animals. We have cloned the normal canine CFTR as well as all four of the missense CFTR mutations, and we await the results of in vitro expression assays to determine the magnitude of mutation effects on CFTR function. If one of these mutations results in a severe loss of CFTR function, we will screen reproductively competent dogs to identify a carrier for that mutation that can be bred to produce a canine genetic model of CF.",

The development of new animal models of cystic fibrosis (CF) has presented tremendous opportunities for understanding the pathogenesis of CF and developing new treatments. We have recently generated a ferret CFTR knockout (KO) model for which newborn animals develop classic signs of CF including pancreatic disease and meconium ileus (MI). Currently, the lung phenotype in this model is unclear. To gain more information on the bioelectric defects seen in CF ferret airways, we have utilized a tracheal xenograft model to evaluate bioelectric properties of CF and wild type littermate tracheas. Tracheas isolated from newborn kits were cannulated with flexible plastic tubing and xenografted subcutaneously into the flanks of nu/nu mice. Grafts were irrigated weekly to remove excess mucous and functional analysis to assess transepithelial potential differences (TEPD) was initiated at 4 weeks post-transplant. Several bioelectric parameters of these airways were assessed including: 1) amiloride-sensitive Na + permeability, 2) cAMP/forskolin-induced Clpermeability, 3) UTP-induced Clpermeability, and 4) the fraction of Clpermeability that is inhibited by GlyH-101. Each of these parameters of ion permeability has been demonstrated to be altered in human CF airway epithelia and/or CF nasal epithelium. Results from these studies demonstrate that cAMP/forskolin treatment (which activates CFTR) induces a change in the TEPD of WT, but not CF, ferret xenografts. This finding is important since CFTR KO mouse tracheal epithelium has alternative non-CFTR Clchannels induced by cAMP agonists and this has been suggested as one reason they do not have a classic CF lung disease phenotype. Furthermore, administration of the CFTR-specific inhibitor GlyH-101 under Clsecretory conditions (low luminal Cl -, cAMP/forskolin) only led to a change in TEPD in WT ferret xenografts-no change was observed in CF ferret xenografts. Interestingly, no significant differences in amiloride sensitive TEPD were observed between WT and CF ferret tracheal xenografts, suggesting that dysregulation of Na + permeability is not a feature of the CF ferret model. It should be noted, however, that CF human bronchial xenografts also do not appear to have significantly elevated amiloride-sensitive TEPDs when compared to non-CF xenografts. Interestingly, a trend toward elevated UTP-dependent changes in TEPDs were seen in CF ferret xenografts, which is similar to what has been reported in the human CF nasal epithelium. In summary, initial characterization of bioelectric properties of the CF ferret airway suggest that this mod-els retains characteristics seen in the human CF airway and hence may be a good model for the progression of CF lung disease. One important goal of translational cystic fibrosis (CF) research is to determine the amount of DF508 CFTR correction necessary to approximate wtCFTR activity. Defining this relationship would help set benchmarks for DF508 CFTR correction. Previous studies have typically examined nonpolarizing systems and have relied on traditional stimuli (eg: cAMP-elevating agents like forskolin or IBMX) to activate wtCFTR and DF508 CFTR in paired expression systems. WtCFTR regulation in vivo is believed to be through Ado stimulation of A2B adenosine receptors, and the gating defect of corrected DF508 CFTR is postulated to be a target of many potentiating molecules. Thus, defining the amount of DF508 CFTR correction necessary to approximate wtCFTR activity would logically include assessment of A2B AR activation of DF508 CFTR in the presence and absence of potentiator molecules. For our studies, DF508 CFTR was corrected by growth of stably transduced DF508 CFTR-expressing CFBE41o-cells at 27 o C for increasing durations. Monolayers were mounted in Ussing chambers, and cells were stimulated with Ado in the presence and absence of P1 (Vrt532). We then compared the Vrt532 + Ado-stimulated Isc in temperature-corrected DF508 CFTR+ cells with that produced by Ado alone in wtCFTR-transduced CFBE41o-cells. These paired cells are stably transduced with lentiviral CFTR cDNA under regulatory control of the CMV promoter. Our results indicate that when Ado-stimulated currents in wtCFTR+ CFBE41o-were used as a denominator (to represent physiologic CFTR regulation), Ado stimulation alone of temperature corrected DF508 CFTR+ CFBE41o-cells produced 1% -5.43% of wt currents following growth of the DF508 CFTR cells at 27 o C for up to 48 hours. In the presence of P1 (10 \u00b5M), Ado-stimulated currents in DF508 CFTR+ cells were 13.8%, 13.4%, 61.28%, 77.88%, and 102.18% of the wtCFTR (Ado alone) at 0, 6, 16, 24, and 48 hours (p<0.01 for DF508 CFTR+ cells + Vrt532 compared with the Ado alone at 16, 24, and 48 hours growth at 27 o C). When using common maximal stimuli for both the wtCFTR+ and the DF508 CFTR+ cells [Ado (10 \u00b5M), forskolin (10 \u00b5M) and genistein (50 \u00b5M)], the percent wtCFTR Isc seen in the DF508 CFTR cells was 3.99%, 5.87%, 18.89%, 34.01%, and 56.07% at 0, 6, 16, 24, and 48 hours of low temperature growth. Complementary C-Band assessments will help clarify the relationship between the percent biochemical correction with the percent wtCFTR Isc produced by DF508 CFTR+ CFBE41o-monolayers after increasing growth durations at low temperature. The results indicate that when using Ado-stimulated Isc in wtCFTR+ CFBE41o-cells as a benchmark, the addition of a potentiator (Vrt532) dramatically increased the Ado-simulated currents in temperature-corrected DF508 CFTR+ CFBE41o-cells across increasing durations of low temperature growth. Short low temperature exposure (16 hours) of DF508 CFTR+ CFBE41o-cells was sufficient to restore >60% of the wtCFTR+ response to Ado in the presence of Vrt532. This approach may serve as a useful surrogate for the examination of DF508 CFTR corrective compounds in preparation for clinical trials. Supported by CFFT and the NIH.",

A three site GI Outcomes Consortium has developed shared methodology across sites, including common subject preparation; biopsy forceps; buffers, tissue dissection and mounts, Ussing chambers, voltage clamps and EDC software, reagent content and sequence (10uM indomethacin x 20 min, followed by 100\u00b5M amiloride, 10\u00b5M forskolin/100\u00b5M IBMX, 100\u00b5M carbachol, and 100\u00b5M bumetanide), centralized data review and scoring, and comprehensive SOPs. Based on careful review of run-in studies, a priori criteria have been established to include/exclude data for further analysis, including initial tissue resistance (in non-CF subjects, tissue resistance < 100 ohm.cm 2 predicted the presence of CFTR dependent Clsecretion), amiloride sensitive Isc (in DF508/DF508 CF tissue, the presence of amiloride-sensitive Isc predicted the absence of cAMP-stimulated Isc), and bumetanide inhibited Isc (defining Cltransport in non-CF subjects, and K + secretion in CF subjects without CFTR activity). Eighty to 85% of sequential biopsy specimens met these criteria for further analysis (n=33:40), producing mean cAMP, CCh, and cAMP + CCh-stimulated Isc of 98.26 ohm.cm 2 (SD 66.39), 158.75 ohm.cm 2 (SD 115.68), and 249.91 ohm.cm 2 (SD 167.48) for non-CF subjects across two study centers respectively. These criteria clearly discriminated cAMP-stimulated Isc between non-CF and DF/DF CF cohorts [non-CF = 111.62 ohm.cm 2 (SD 62); CF = -20.45 (SD 23.20) ]. Treatment of non-CF tissues with indomethacin (10 \u00b5M x 20 min) led to higher cAMP-, CCh-, and cAMP + CCh-stimulated Isc in non-CF subjects (p< 0.01 for each parameter compared with non-Indo-treated controls). Applying common methodology across two sites led to similar values for CFTR-dependent Clsecretion (mean cAMP, CCh, and cAMP + CCh-stimulated Isc within 10%, p = NS) that is in line with published reports (Hirtz S et al. Gastroenterology 2004; 127:1085) . Data from the third study site is under analysis following installation of common equipment.

Previous studies by our laboratory suggest that a cellular feedback response to lost CFTR function increases the cAMP pathway resulting in cholesterol accumulation. The goal of this study is to further elucidate the mechanisms relating cAMP signaling and control of cholesterol transport. Two indicators of chronically increased cAMP signaling in cystic fibrosis (CF) cells is the increased expression of both pCREB and betaarrestin-2 (\u03b2arr2). Since \u03b2arr2 actively participates in the internalization and sorting of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), like the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor (\u03b22-AR), into the endosomal/lysosomal pathway, we hypothesize that \u03b2arr2 is playing a regulatory role in linking the cAMP pathway to cholesterol processing in CF. To test this, 9/HTEo-cells stably overexpressing GFP-tagged \u03b2arr2 (\u03b2arr2-GFP) and their respective control cells (cont-GFP) were examined by filipin stain to determine intracellular processing of free cholesterol. \u03b2arr2-overexpressing cells exhibit a clear perinuclear accumulation of cholesterol similar to that seen in CF cells and also exhibit a colocalization of the \u03b2arr2 and cholesterol indicating a shared processing mechanism. Also, similar to CF cells, the intracellular cholesterol accumulation can be alleviated with the cAMP binding antagonist Rp-cAMPS after 72 h as determined by filipin stain. Furthermore, depletion of \u03b2arr2 expression with shRNA in CF cells eliminates cholesterol accumulation. These data taken together show that \u03b2arr2 overexpression alone is enough to cause CF-like perinuclear cholesterol accumulation which can be reversed by inhibiting cAMP pathway activation. Because of this, the effect of chronic \u03b2arr2 expression on the cAMP pathway was examined. The \u03b2arr2-GFP cells demonstrate a 2.2-fold increase in pCREB expression compared to cont-GFP cells as determined by Western blot analysis (p < 0.05) indicating that increased \u03b2arr2 expression causes increased pCREB expression. To assess the role of CREB activation in the development of CF-like cholesterol accumulation, 9/HTEo-cells stably expressing dominant-negative CREB (kCREB or CREB-133; mutations which either block binding to CRE or phosphorylation of CREB, respectively) and wildtype cells (wt-CREB; 9/HTEo-cells stably expressing human wildtype CREB) were exposed to the cAMP analog 8-Bromo cAMP (8-Br) for 48 h and examined by filipin stain. The CREB-133 and kCREB cells exhibit no apparent alteration in cholesterol processing in the presence of 8-Br whereas untreated wt-CREB cells show perinuclear cholesterol accumulation which in the presence of 8-Br becomes even more pronounced. To ensure the co-localization of \u03b2arr2 and accumulated cholesterol is occurring in the lysosomes/late endosomes, \u03b2arr2-GFP cells exposed to lysotracker and examined by filipin stain show a clear co-localization of \u03b2arr2, lysotracker, and cholesterol indicating that \u03b2arr2 and cholesterol are both being sorted into the lysosomal/endosomal pathway. The same localization of cholesterol is observed in CF cells. All these data implicate a regulatory role of \u03b2arr2 on the development of the cholesterol phenotype in CF.

Mucociliary clearance (MCC), an innate host defense mechanism important for keeping the airways cleared of inhaled particles, bacteria, and viruses, is impaired in cystic fibrosis (CF), facilitating mucostasis and chronic bacterial infections. A number of genetically engineered mouse models have recently been designed to modify various components of the mucociliary apparatus. These models not only allow the study of how alterations in MCC compromise lung defense, but have the potential to be useful model systems to test potential therapeutic regimens directed at stimulating mucus clearance. Traditionally, radionuclide particle clearance has been used to quantify mucociliary clearance rates in the airways of humans and large laboratory animal models. Unfortunately, attempts at performing similar measurements in mice and other small rodents have been less successful due to the increased complexity associated with radioaerosol delivery and imaging in these small animals. The objective of these studies was to develop radionuclide particle clearance methodologies for quantifying mucus clearance in anesthetized and conscious mice.",

However, in mice killed with an overdose of isoflurane (> 10%), known to inhibit cilia beating, clearance of radionuclide was essentially inhibited (0.13\u00b10.01 %/min), demonstrating clearance of radiotracer is dependent on the mucociliary clearance apparatus. We have also performed studies in restrained conscious animals, where clearance was noticeably stimulated. These mice exhibited an initial clearance of 12.3\u00b11.2 %/min over the first 6 min followed by a sustained rate of 0.9\u00b10.1 %/min thereafter.",

Supported by CFF. Expression of CFTR by gene transfer offers the potential to correct cystic fibrosis (CF) abnormalities. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a promising vector for CF gene transfer but the length of DNA that can be efficiently packaged in AAV vectors is limited. To produce a CFTR cDNA insert that can be packaged in an AAV vector, we shortened the CFTR coding sequence (CFTR\u2206R) by deleting the nucleotides corresponding to residues 708-759 of the R domain. Our earlier work showed that CFTR\u2206R retained the Clchannel properties of full length CFTR and corrected the Cltransport defect in differentiated CF airway epithelia in vitro. Here we tested the hypothesis that the shortened CFTR transgene can rescue CFTR function in vivo and improve a clinical phenotype. CFTR-/-mice develop severe intestinal disease that is usually lethal at the time of weaning. Previous studies showed that expressing wild-type CFTR in the intestine with the intestinal fatty acid binding protein (FABP) promoter rescued the intestinal phenotype. Therefore, we generated CFTR-/-mice that contained a transgene with the FABP promoter driving CFTR\u2206R. Immunocytochemistry revealed expression of CFTR\u2206R in intestinal villi and crypts of transgenic, but not CFTR-/-mice.",

            "text": "Immunoprecipitation and phosphorylation experiments also confirmed the presence of a shortened CFTR in the intestine of CFTR\u2206R transgenic, but not CFTR-/-mice. To test for CFTR function, we studied ileal and jejunal segments from CFTR-/-mice transgenic for CFTR\u2206R and found that they generated cAMP-stimulated short-circuit currents that were inhibited by bumetanide; the currents were equivalent to those in CFTR-/-mice transgenic for wild-type CFTR driven by the FABP promoter. Importantly, the FABP>CFTR\u2206R transgene prolonged the survival of the CFTR-/-mice (80-100% survival beyond 120 days). Histopathological analysis showed marked improvement in the intestine of CFTR-/-that carried the FABP>CFTR\u2206R transgene. These data indicate that a shortened CFTR can correct the electrophysiological and pathological intestinal abnormalities in CFTR-/-mice and rescue their survival from intestinal disease. Thus, these results suggest that a CFTR\u2206R construct may be a valuable part of an AAV vector for CF gene transfer. Our laboratory recently generated an exon-10 deleted cystic fibrosis (CF) ferret model using CFTR gene-targeted fibroblasts and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) (Sun, et al. J Clin Invest 2008; 118:1578) . At birth, CFTR knockout (KO) kits demonstrate pancreatic lesions and variable degrees of intestinal obstruction characteristic of meconium ileus (MI). Although pharmacologic approaches to treat MI in these CF ferrets may prove useful in enhancing post-natal survival, developing a genetic background that alleviates MI would be extremely useful for dissemination of the model and characterization of a lung phenotype. To this end, we have begun to develop a transgenic CFTR-KO ferret model that expresses fCFTR containing a 3xHA tag in ECL4 (fCFTR-HA) under the direction of a gutrestricted Intestinal Fatty Acid Binding Protein (iFABP) promoter. We show that indeed iFABP protein is only expressed in the gut of ferrets and expression is activated by E28 of the 42 day gestation. The insertion of the HA-tag in fCFTR was included to allow for sensitive assessment of transgene expression and the generation of a useful animal model for studying fCFTR processing and cell biology in vivo. The fCFTR-HA cDNA has been generated and is fully processed and functional like the hCFTR-HA counterpart. The transgenic construct containing the rat iFABP promoter driving the fCFTR-HA cDNA and a floxed PGK promoter-driven Zeocin resistant gene cassette was generated. Cre recombinase-mediated excision of the PGK-Zeocin cassette will be needed to ensure that the PGK promoter does not interfere with restricted iFABP promoter-directed expression. To test whether this CRE-mediated approach of engineering primary ferret fibroblasts is feasible, we generate pools of CRE-reporter fibroblasts transfected with a CMV-LacZ(LoxP)/AP/Neomycin (Z/AP) expression cassette and tested whether virally mediated expression of CRE was capable of efficiently switching gene expression from LacZ to alkaline phosphatase (AP). These studies demonstrated 95% efficiency of CRE-mediated excision. We are currently undergoing experiments to generated iFABP-fCFTR-HA transfected/selected pools of CFTR-KO female ferret fibroblasts that will then be subjected to CRE-mediated excision of the PGK-Zeocin cassette and used as nuclear donors for SCNT cloning of ferrets. Following nuclear transfer, 28 day embryos will be harvested to generate primary fibroblasts and to determine tissue-specificity of transgene expression in the lung, pancreas, and intestine. Rederived fibroblasts from fetuses that demonstrate intestinal-specific expression of fCFTR-HA will then be used as nuclear donors to generate transgenic iFABP-fCFTR-HA CFTR-KO ferrets by SCNT. These efforts may greatly enhance the utility of the CF ferret model by preventing neonatal complications of MI, thus allowing for studies of lung pathogenesis in the model. The development of new animal models for cystic fibrosis (CF) are needed to dissect mechanisms of disease progression and develop therapies. We have recently obtained births from a newly developed CFTR knockout (KO) ferret model and have carried out initial analyses of gross and histologic pathologies in newborn kits ranging from 24-72 hrs of age. The gross presentations in the first two CFTR-KO kits differed significantly. One kit (CF-1) had meconium ileus (MI)-like dilation proximal to an obstruction-like interface, as well as a perforation site more distally in the colon. Distal to the perforation, the intestine appeared to be unusually small, slightly coiled and at the histologic level laden with mucus. The second pup (CF-2) passed stool within the first 24 hrs and had a grossly normal bowel that did not significantly differ in presentation from age-matched WT kits. The variable penetrance of the MI in these CF kits is consistent with the occurrence and severity of MI in CF infants. Gross and subgross examination of CF-1 and CF-2 pancreases did not detect differences from WT as is seen in the CF pig model; however, histological lesions were consistently detected as most acini and ductules were dilated by eosinophilic inspissated zymogen secretions. The histopathology of the CF pancreas suggests that the animals may have at least partial exocrine/pancreatic insufficiency. The lung of CF-1 had no features that were overtly distinguishable from those of WT kits. However, the lung of CF-2 exhibited small foci of bronchopneumonia characterized by degenerative neutrophils that filled bronchioles, and alveoli bearing admixed bacterial colonies. Focal parenchymal necrosis similar to that seen in the case of an infarct was observed, although no thrombus was detected. Historically, bronchopneumonia was not atypical for CF infants (e.g. early 20th century prior to aggressive antibiotic therapies). Bronchopneumonia is also sometimes detected in association with microaspiration of milk in nursing neonatal animals and this may have been the case for CF-2. However, focal bronchopneumonia has yet to be observed in the lungs of control non-CF kits. Histologic analysis of the liver and gallbladder of these CF kits demonstrated these organs were spared from overt disease. Both CF-1 and CF-2 died within 36-42 hrs after birth. The above initial pathology results suggest that CF-1 died of meconium ileus related disease including intestinal obstruction and perforation, and that the cause of death for CF-2 was not readily defined by necropsy but the bronchopneumonia may have contributed. More recently, new cohorts of CF ferrets have been obtained and we are working through pharmacologic approaches to treat both MI and pancreatic disease in the newborns. Thus far, all 12 CF kits have died postnatally and retain diagnostic pancreatic abnormalities. However, approximately 25% (3 of 12 CF kits) appear to escape MI and pass stool. Histologic assessment of the lungs demonstrated recurrent focal bronchopneumonia in a subset of CF kits and we are using aggressive antibiotic therapy to prevent aspiration bronchopneumonia. A mutation in the yeast ABC-transporter, yor1-\u2206F670 is analogous to human CFTR-\u2206F508, as evidenced by a similar trafficking defect, retention in the ER, processing of the defective protein by Endoplasmic Reticulum Associated Degradation (ERAD), and failure to reach the plasma membrane. In contrast to the chloride-channel function of CFTR, YOR1 is a drug pump that confers resistance to oligomycin, an inhibitor of mitochondrial function. We constructed a Tet-regulatable allele of yor1-\u2206F that exhibits titratable resistance to oligomycin, to optimize detection of gene-gene interactions. A novel high throughput method for constructing double mutants was used to introduce Tet-yor1-\u2206F into the set of 4850 yeast gene deletion strains to screen for enhancers and suppressors of oligomycin resistance and investigate their potential role in trafficking of yor1-\u2206F to the plasma membrane. For sensitive detection of gene-gene interactions, we analyzed kinetic growth curves for all 4850 double mutant strains at multiple concentrations of oligomycin. Two rounds of screening identified over 100 potential gene-gene interactions. These included several genes having both human orthologs and previously described cellular functions of presumed relevance to CFTR-\u2206F biogenesis. For example, CDH1, identified as a potential regulator of yor1-\u2206F in our screen, has been shown previously to function in ubiquitin-mediated protein turnover and the RAS pathway. Another strongly positive gene interaction involved JJJ1, which regulates endocytosis (membrane trafficking) at the cell surface. Neither of these gene products has been implicated previously as part of ABC-protein biogenesis. Followup experiments are in progress to investigate the molecular basis for the phenotypic findings. Once genes involved in post-transcriptional mechanisms are confirmed, the corresponding mutants will be assessed for effects on yor1-\u2206F protein stability, degradation, and ultimately trafficking to different cellular compartments. The longer-term goal, related to identifying genetic and cellular targets that modulate the biogenesis of yor1-\u2206F, is to validate evolutionarily conserved roles for functions relevant to biogenesis of CFTR-\u2206F. Toward this end, we are investigating conserved modifiers using RNAi approaches in established human cell types. In summary, we have developed a yeast genetic model for cystic fibrosis, wherein we hope to scan a eukaryotic genome for extragenic mutations that result from deletion of a conserved phenylalanine residue in NBD1, corresponding to the most common mutation associated with cystic fibrosis. The approach is aimed at identifying new participants in ABC-protein biogenesis, and opportunities for development of novel genetic targets for cystic fibrosis therapeutics. Homologous recombination using recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) has been used to generate new cystic fibrosis models in the ferret and pig. Preliminary evidence from our laboratory suggests that the \u2206F508 mutation in ferret CFTR gives rise to a mutant protein that undergoes similar processing defects as seen in human CFTR. Hence, the ferret may be a good species for modeling this mutation. Here we report our current efforts to produced a \u2206F508-CFTR ferret model using rAAV mediated-gene targeting in primary fibroblasts and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) cloning. Our initial strategy involved construction of a rAAV targeting vector (AV-\u2206F508/neo252) that encoded homologous sequences flanking exon-10 with the \u2206F508 deletion and a floxed neomycin selectable marker 252 bp downstream of exon-10. The distance of the Neo selectable marker from exon-10 was chosen to minimize interference with splicing of the CFTR gene. AV-\u2206F508/neo252 virus was used to infect primary ferret fibroblasts and cell clones were isolated by limiting dilution in 96 well plates under G418 selection and then screened by PCR. Although 0.34% of the screened clones demonstrated homologous recombination at the CFTR locus, none of the clones retained the \u2206F508 mutation in exon-10. These findings suggested that the distance between the F508 deletion and the Neo insertion was to great, leading to homologous recombination between the \u2206F508 target site and the Neo insertion. We next redesigned the targeting vector (AV-\u2206508F/neo65) to place the Neo insertion 65bp downstream of exon-10. Of 11,868 clones screened thus far using this vector, 35 clones were positive for a homologous recombination event (0.29%). However, only 15 of the 35 clones demonstrated correct left arm and right arm flanking sequences by PCR. Sequence analysis of exon-10 demonstrated that 12 of the 15 clones with correct flanking sequences contained the F508 deletion and 3 clones remained F508 unchanged. PCR sequencing data also revealed sequence rearrangements in the target site among a significant portion of the targeted fibroblast clones. This low fidelity of homologous recombination, which was not seen when targeting an insertion to fCFTR exon-10, implies mechanistic differences in the recombination events that control large insertions and small deletions. Although the correctly targeted F508-deleted fibroblast clones rapid senesced upon expansion, we were able to amplify enough cells for SCNT from six fibroblast clones and obtain ten mid-gestation embryos for rederival of fibroblasts and Southern blot confirmation of the targeting event. However, fibroblasts derived from these embryos lacked Neo resistance despite the fact they were PCR positive in the initial screen. This was also observed when the exon-10 knockout ferret was generated and is thought to be due to episomal AAV genomes that allow for persistence of non-targeted cells (G418 resistant) in the original gene-targeted clones. We are currently evaluating an altered vector design to increase the fidelity of homologous recombination and attempting to utilize hybrid ITR vectors for gene targeting which minimize circular episomes that interfere with the selection process of clonal fibroblast lines. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). While our understanding of CF disease pathogenesis has significantly improved, chronic pulmonary bacterial infections and inflammation remain the major causes of morbidity and mortality in CF. Because swine share many anatomical and physiological similarities to humans, we recently developed CFTR-/-piglets using recombinant adeno-associated viruses targeting CFTR in pig fetal fibroblasts and somatic cell nuclear transfer to porcine oocytes. At birth, similar to humans these animals demonstrate meconium ileus, pancreatic involvement, and absent epithelial CFTR chloride current. The most common genetic mutation in CF leads to deletion of phenylalanine at amino acid position 508 (\u2206F508) in CFTR. In humans this mutation disrupts processing of CFTR leading to an incompletely glycosylated protein that fails to properly traffic to the Golgi and plasma membrane. In vitro studies have suggested that some mouse and pig CFTR \u2206F508 are fully glycosylated and reach the apical surface. In order to begin to study the biosynthetic defects in CFTR \u2206F508 we have generated CFTR-/\u2206F508 pigs using similar techniques as for generation of CFTR-/-piglets. At birth, all CFTR-/\u2206F508 pigs had meconium ileus and pancreatic involvement similar to CFTR-/-piglets and humans with CF. Nasal voltage measurements showed lack of epithelial chloride conductance. In differentiated cultures of tracheal epithelia from CFTR-/\u2206F508 pigs, CFTR appeared primarily as the immature band B form and there was lack of CFTR chloride current. These findings suggest that CFTR-/\u2206F508 pigs may be a useful model to further investigate the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of CFTR \u2206F508 processing in CF disease and to develop new therapeutic tools for CF.",

Although CF primarily affects the lungs, many CF patients exhibit gut, liver, pancreas, and vas deferens defects, indicating an important role for CFTR outside the lungs. Understanding the pathophysiology of CF in these organs has been difficult due to the absence of a genetically tractable, easily accessible model system. To address these obstacles, we are using zebrafish to examine the role of the CFTR channel during organogenesis. The zebrafish is an optically clear, genetically tractable organism that is amenable to pharmacological and genetic manipulations, allowing live imaging of experi-mental animals. Importantly, CFTR is highly expressed in a variety of zebrafish tissues. To investigate the role of CFTR during organogenesis we are using a variety of organ-specific fluorescent proteins in transgenic zebrafish lines to track the development of individual organs. Inhibition of the CFTR channel during development by pharmacological or genetic manipulations leads to striking morphogenesis defects in the zebrafish eye and endodermal organs. This indicates that CFTR plays a critical role in organogenesis in addition to organ homeostasis. The transparent and genetically tractable zebrafish model provides a powerful system for studying CFTR's role in organogenesis.",

Meconium ileus is a congenital obstruction of the intestine that is detected in15-20% of infants with cystic fibrosis (CF) following birth and may present with complicating lesions (e.g. atresia, perforation, etc.) that require surgical intervention. We recently developed a CFTR-/-pig model in which meconium ileus is ubiquitous at birth. In addition to severe obstruction, the CFTR-/-pig has the presence of variable atresia, stenosis, perforation and microcolon that require surgical intervention. Following birth, CFTR-/-and CFTR+/+ (control) pigs were anesthetized with isoflurane and placed on mechanical ventilation. Prior to abdominal surgery, a tunneled central venous catheter was placed in the left internal jugular vein via a cut down approach and brought out between the scapulae. This provided venous access for post-operative care. Next, a left subcostal incision was made and exploration identified the location and severity of the obstruction. Most inspissated meconium was either in the terminal jejunum to ileum or in the spiral colon. At times, the obstruction was severe with atresia and microileum/colon. If this was the case, a loop ostomy proximal to these obstructions was performed. If no impediments to passage of intestinal material were detected or if the obstruction was located in the spiral colon, then the cecum was opened and the inspissated meconium was flushed out of the ileum and colon. Cecostomy formation followed this maneuver. Within hours of the surgery, piglets were freely walking. The pigs are maintained in pICU (pig intensive care unit) care for 2-4 days with intravenous fluids, systemic intravenous antibiotics (metronidazole, ampicillin, and gentamicin), topical wound care, and regular ostomy flushing. The pigs remain in pICU care until they have successfully transitioned back onto milk-based nutrition and hydration with normal outflow of ostomy material. Surgical correction for meconium ileus obstruction in neonatal pigs is now routine and permits long-term survival of the CFTR-/-pig for study of CF disease pathogenesis. Delivering the cystic fibrosis gene (CFTR) to the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients has proven to be a significant challenge. To select a lead gene therapeutic for CF lung disease we undertook a systematic candidate selection by screening novel adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors in defined models of airway epithelium. Our work led to the identification of a lead AAV vector candidate known as AAV6.2 that has a superior transduction profile in mouse and macaque lung in vivo; human and macaque airway in vitro. In efforts to progress AAV6.2 into the clinic, we evaluated its immunogenicity in mouse lung. AAV6.2 expressing \u03b2-galactosidase (nLacZ) was intratracheally delivered into C57BL/6 and BALB/c mouse lung, and T cell responses were evaluated at the peak of nLacZ expression. The IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot assay confirmed the presence of a high T cell response to both the vector and the nLacZ gene product in lung. Longitudinal gene expression studies demonstrated that although nLacZ-specific T cells were present in lung, nLacZ expression was not impacted, suggesting that the cytolytic activity of these T cells was suppressed. In an attempt to identify the mechanisms underlying the persistence of gene expression in airway we focused on the role of alveolar macrophages (AMs). It is long known that resident AMs are the main reason why lungs remain sterile and clean despite daily encounters with noxious particles in inspired air. Using clodronate liposomes we depleted AMs from BALB/c mouse lung prior to the intratracheal delivery of the AAV6.2 vector expressing nLacZ. We evaluated nLacZ expression in lung and monitored T cell responses to both the vector and nLacZ in lung and spleen up to day 90. We also evaluated B cell responses to vector and nLacZ in serum and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). At day 7, while the magnitude of the vector-and nLacZ-specific T cell response in spleen was similar between the AM depleted and the na\u00efve animals; in lung there was a significantly higher T cell response in the AM depleted mice. Similarly, IgG and IgA responses to the vector and LacZ were significantly elevated in the serum and BALF of the AM depleted mice. Importantly, at days 14, 21 and 90 nLacZ expression in the airways of the AM-depleted mice was ablated and was accompanied by high levels of vector-and nLacZ-specific T cells as well as increased IgG and IgA responses to both vector and nLacZ in serum and BALF, respectively. To summarize, our data show for the first time the role of resident AMs in mediating tolerance to both the AAV vector and transgene product delivered to the lung. Findings in CFTR knockout mice using AAV6.2 vector expressing CFTR are also being discussed.",

Although recurrent lung infection and inflammation is the leading cause of morbidity in cystic fibrosis (CF), the role of CFTR in the modulation of the innate immune response of respiratory epithelia remains controversial. While the presence of increased level of neutrophils, free neutrophil elastase activity and IL-8 in the bronchoalveolar lavage of CF infants without the evidence of infection favours the suppressive role of CFTR in pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion, the absence of infection remains under debate. Cell models yielded contradictory results that could be, in part, attributed to the impact of genetic background variability, modifier genes and genetic instability of clonally-selected immortalized cell lines. To assess the role of CFTR expression in the innate immune response of respiratory epithelia in vitro and to minimize the potentially confounding genetic influence, we expressed the human CFTR under the control of an inducible transcriptional activator in the CF bronchial epithelia CFBE41o-. This experimental system allows the gradual adjustment of the channel expression to a level comparable with the endogenous expression in Calu-3. To mimic the air-liquid interface environment of lung epithelia, the cells were cultivated on semipermeable filter support under either air-liquid (ALC) or liquid-liquid (LLC) culture conditions. Under LLC condition we did not observe differential cytokine secretion regardless of the CFTR expression level. In contrast, under ALC condition CFTR expression significantly suppressed the increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-8, observed both in the apical and the basolateral compartment. Parental CFBE41o-cells, similar to a cell line harbouring inducible expression of the folding-deficient \u2206F508 CFTR, also secreted significantly higher levels of IL-6 and IL-8 compared to wt CFTR expressing epithelia. Initial studies using quantitative RT-PCR analysis on a panel of unfolded protein response markers, including X-box protein 1 (XBP1), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), or Erdj4 and Western blotting using antibodies raised against UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) or the phosphoeukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF-2\u03b1), suggested that the increased cytokine secretion is independent of the generation of an ER-stress response. Even upon induction of \u2206F508 CFTR expression there was only negligible increase in the ER-stress response, suggesting the involvement of other signalling mechanism in the pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in CF respiratory epithelia. Despite the importance of nasal potential difference (NPD) as an in vivo biomarker of CFTR activity, a single, unified protocol has not been adopted worldwide. Moreover, performance of the assay in multi-center clinical trials has been associated with unreliability, excessive artifact, and inter-center variability that may adversely affect sensitivity. Following an analysis of NPD methods, we successfully pilot-tested a \"Universal\" NPD protocol utilizing electronic data capture (EDC-with human grade bioamplifier) and use of a non-perfusing (agar) nasal catheter less susceptible to artifacts. To confirm the validity and feasibility of the agar approach, we performed a multicenter, randomized, crossover trial to compare previous methodology (site specific standards in accordance with TDN SOP using a continuously perfusion catheter) and a proposed agar-based NPD protocol. Normal subjects randomly underwent two-nostril NPD with each method, separated by \u2265 1 day. We enrolled 22 subjects in 6 centers, and all completed paired analysis. PD values measuring total chloride conductance (TCC) were significantly more polarizing using the agar method (-24.2 \u00b1 12.9 mV agar vs. -18.2 \u00b1 9.1 mV with perfusion; p<0.05). Similar trends were seen in individual measures of chloride conductance (change zero chloride: -12.7 \u00b1 10.4 mV agar vs. -8.7 \u00b1 5.6 mV perfusion, p<0.05; change isoproterenol: -11.5 \u00b1 6.2 mV agar vs. -9.5 \u00b1 6.3 mV perfusion, p=0.15). Results may reflect a more potent Clgradient due to the absence of continuous Ringers with the agar method. Despite an enhanced signal, no increase in CV was observed (0.53 agar vs. 0.50 perfusion for TCC). Agar tracings were significantly more reliable, demonstrating 3.5 and 1.5 artifacts per tracing in the sodium and chloride components, respectively, compared to 11.4 and 8.8 with the perfusion method. Tracing stability (estimated by the variability of the measure over a 10 sec interval) was significantly enhanced with the agar method (0.42 vs. 0.71 with perfusion). Limited comparison with an alternative non-perfusion device (ECG with AgCl electrodes) showed similar beneficial results. Operators at all sites preferred the agar method, and reported reduced setup and troubleshooting. Interim results shared with CFFT and industry partners endorsed use of the approach, which will be used in two upcoming international trials examining CFTR modulators. In conclusion, the proposed non-perfusion NPD approach is preferred over traditional (perfusion) NPD methods, and may improve sensitivity to changes in Clconductance within therapeutic trials. The proposed NPD procedure should be considered for adoption for therapeutic monitoring worldwide.",

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder caused by defective CFTR function leading to abnormal epithelial fluid transport in the lungs and other organs. VX-770 is a CFTR potentiator under clinical investigation in CF. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate VX-770 safety and tolerability; clinical outcomes (spirometry and CFQ-R) were also assessed. Subjects were adults with CF and a G551D-CFTR allele. Part 1 was a cross-over design in which 20 subjects received placebo or VX-770 q12h at 25, 75, or 150 mg for 14 days. Part 2 was a parallel design in which 19 new subjects received placebo or VX-770 q12h at 150 or 250 mg for 28 days. In both parts, no drug-related serious adverse events were reported and VX-770 was generally well-tolerated. Results demonstrating statistically significant improvement in forced expiratory volume (FEV1) from baseline to days 14 and 28 have previously been reported. Changes in forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory flow (FEF25-75) have now also been analyzed. In Part 1, mean (\u00b195%CI) In the analysis of respiratory outcomes by CFQ-R in Part 2, median improvement in respiratory domain score at Day 28 in the 150 and 250 mg groups was 8.3 (p=0.06) and 11.1 (p=0.08), respectively. In the 250 mg group, 6 of 7 subjects at 14 days, and 5 of 7 at 28 days demonstrated a minimal clinically important difference in their respiratory domain score (\u22654 points). Further details of effect of VX-770 on CFQ-R by domain will be presented. Conclusion: 14-and 28-day administration of VX-770 led to improvement in early respiratory outcomes and further studies are needed to assess persistence of effect. Certain aminoglycosides (AG) can induce \"translational readthrough\" of premature termination codons (PTCs) in CFTR, and the approach has been shown to restore full-length functional protein in a number of preclinical and clinical settings. However, cumulative toxicity and relative lack of efficacy of AGs deter development as a treatment for genetic disease caused by PTCs, including the ~12% of affected cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Using a structure-based approach, a series of synthetic AGs (termed NB30 and NB54) were developed that exhibit enhanced suppression of PTCs using a dual-luciferase readthrough construct while also exhibiting reduced toxicity in cellular assays. To confirm the utility of the approach in CF, we tested NB30 and NB54 in comparison to gentamicin (gent). In a fluorescencebased halide efflux assay (SPQ), all agents (500 mcg/mL incubated 18 hrs) restored activity of W1282X CFTR expressed in HeLa cells (p<0.01), with a relative rank-order of NB54, NB30, and gent. Confirmatory testing in an SPQ-based plate-reader assay of IB-3 cells (endogenous genotype W1282X/\u2206F508) indicated dose-dependent rescue of CFTR activity by NB30 and NB54 at the highest concentrations tested (2.4 and 2.2 fold over control at 1000 mcg/mL, respectively; p<0.001), whereas gentamicin-treated cells peaked at the lowest tested dose (125 mcg/mL). As expected, no rescue of CFTR-mediated halide efflux was seen with CFNPE cells (endogenous \u2206F508/\u2206F508) or HeLa parental (no CFTR transgene) cells. To confirm the effect in polarized epithelia, we assessed forskolin-stimulated Isc in CFBE41o-cells stably transfected with W1282X. Treatment of monolayers with NB54 for 18 hours resulted in 0.526 \u00b5A/cm 2 of CFTR dependent Isc over vehicle, whereas gentamicin induced 0.084 \u00b5A/cm 2 (p<0.05 vs. gentamicin, n=12). Dose-dependent comparisons in CFBE41o-cells transiently infected with G542X CFTR showed similar results. Limited studies utilizing primary human nasal airway epithelial cells expressing 2789+G->C/DF508 (heterozygous for a splice mutant encoding an in-frame PTC) treated with NB54 (500 mcg/mL) indicated activation of forskolin-mediated CFTR transport (Isc=2.4 \u00b5A/cm 2 vs 1.5 \u00b5A/cm 2 with vehicle). Preliminary results in vivo indicate that systemic administration of NB54 (120 mg/kg SC) compared to gentamicin (30 mg/kg, SC) to CF -/-hCFTR-G542X transgenic mice for 2 weeks restored comparable chloride transport following forskolin addition in excised murine intestines studied under Isc conditions (23 \u00b5A/cm 2 vs. 24 \u00b5A/cm 2 , respectively), but greater chloride transport with NB54 following sequential carbachol addition (47 \u00b5A/cm 2 vs. 22 \u00b5A/cm 2 , respectively), suggesting more robust CFTR rescue. When taken together, these results indicate that the synthetic aminoglycoside NB54 demonstrates enhanced suppression of PTCs within CFTR compared to gentamicin. Synthetic aminoglycosides may provide an improved means of treating genetic diseases caused by PTCs, and deserve further exploration as therapeutic agents in nonsense mediated CF.",

Experiments in CF hBE were performed at ChanTest, Inc. Activation of alternative chloride channels by drugs is one strategy for cystic fibrosis (CF) therapy, with two compounds (denufosol and Moli1901) in clinical trials that activate calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs) by transient elevation of cytoplasmic calcium. We reasoned that compounds that directly target CaCCs might be superior to non-selective calcium-elevating agonists in terms of fewer off-target effects and the possibility of producing sustained rather than transient CaCC elevation. TMEM16A was found recently to be a CaCC expressed in airway epithelial cells. A highthroughput screening (HTS) assay was developed based on iodide quenching of YFP fluorescence in FRT cells stably expressing human TMEM16A. The HTS assay was designed to identify TMEM16A inhibitors and activators in the same kinetic measurement. Screening of 100,000 diverse, druglike small molecules yielded many active TMEM16A inhibitors, with several classes having nanomolar potency and inhibiting CaCC chloride conductance in multiple cell types of airway, salivary gland, pancreas and intestinal origin. A smaller number of TMEM16A activators were identified, with at least 5 classes strongly activating TMEM16A with submicromolar potency. Activation was independent of calcium chelation and without cytoplasmic calcium elevation, suggesting that the compounds target TMEM16A directly. The compounds produced a sustained increase in chloride current in short-circuit current measurements on primary airway epithelial cells from CF subjects. Small-molecule activators of TMEM16A and related CaCCs may be useful in the therapy of CF.",

Nasal potential difference (NPD) is a measure of CFTR and ENaC activity used in early phase clinical trials, but it remains unclear which NPD parameters are most sensitive to changes in CFTR activity. Relating NPD measurements and clinical outcomes (eg, lung function, patient reported outcomes) can help optimize the design of trials that utilize NPD and aid in prioritizing drug candidates for testing in larger trials. In a two-part safety and tolerability study in patients with the G551D CFTR mutation, the oral CFTR potentiator VX-770 was generally well-tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events. This study also included biomarker and clinical efficacy endpoints. NPD was performed throughout the study, affording an opportunity to explore relationships between clinically meaningful outcomes and nasal ion transport and providing important reproducibility data. A NPD parameter measuring CFTR-dependent Cltransport (change in PD following zero Clsolution and isoproterenol perfusion) demonstrated a significant change from baseline within the treatment group for VX-770 for the 75 and 150 mg doses at Day 14 in Part 1 (-4.7 and -5.4 mV, respectively; P<0.05) and VX-770 150 and 250 mg doses at Day 28 in Part 2 (-3.5 and -5.5 mV, respectively; P<0.05). The corresponding changes in the placebo groups at those time points were -1.7 and -0.4 mV, respectively. Improvement in Cltransport was paralleled by improvements in NPD measures of Na + ion transport, such as change from baseline to Day 14 (Part 1) in amiloride response (-3.5 and -8.6 mV for the VX-770 75 and 150 mg groups vs +4.5 mV in the placebo group; P<0.05 vs placebo) though Na + transport changes from baseline were not significant at Day 28 (Part 2). Improvements were also observed in sweat chloride biomarker and lung function endpoints in this study. Correlations between zero Clplus isoproterenol to sweat chloride were weak for all treatment groups (Pearson coefficients for VX-770 150mg: -0.15 after 14 days and -0.23 after 28 days in combined analysis of Parts 1 and 2 of the study). Correlations of zero Clplus isoproterenol to lung function (%predicted FEV1) after 14-and 28-days of therapy were similarly weak (+0.27 after 14 days and -0.32 after 28 days). Inconclusive correlations were probably due to the small sample size. The results of this small study suggest that oral administration of a CFTR modulator compound can improve NPD measures of CFTR-related Cltransport and may lead to an improvement in ENaC-related Na + transport. In addition, though NPD-measured ion transport, sweat chloride, and lung function all showed improvement in this study, the changes were not necessarily correlated. Further clinical evaluation will be necessary to better understand the relationship between biomarkers and outcome measures. Introduction: Sensitive outcome measures to assess the efficacy of therapeutic interventions in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with mild lung disease are currently lacking. We studied the ability of the Lung Clearance Index (LCI), a measure of ventilation inhomogeneity determined during Multiple Breath Washout (MBW) to detect a treatment response to hypertonic saline inhalation in pediatric CF patients with normal pulmonary function.",

Markers obtained by rapid and non-invasive methods could be used in the precocious detection of exacerbations or as prognostic indicators in cystic fibrosis (CF). Our goal was to search for lipid signatures characteristic of CF patients in blood plasma using two separate mass spectrometry approaches: a novel MALDI-TOF-ClinProTools analysis, and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) LC-ESI-MS/MS. Samples from 53 CF patients and 18 healthy children were collected at the Institute for Mother and Child (Warsaw). Organic extraction was followed by column chromatography separation of lipid classes. Extracts were analyzed by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF), ion signatures were compared by the ClinProTools software (Bruker Daltonics) and relevant peaks were identified by LC-ESI-MS/MS. The most remarkable differences were found in the phospholipid class. Eighteen ions were significantly decreased in CF patients, corresponding to 6 lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC16:0, 18:0, 18: 1, 18:2, 20:3, 20:4) and 12 phosphatidylcholine species (PC32: 1, 34:2, 36:1, 36:2, 36:5, 38:0, p38:3, 38:4, 38:5, 38 :6, e40:0, p40:1). One ion (either LPCe16:0 or LPE18:0) was significantly increased in patients. Five ions (LPC20:3 and PC36: 1, 38:3, 38:4, 40:6) were consistently downregulated in severe vs mild patients (according to Shwachman score). In parallel, organic extracts from 16 healthy children, 29 mild and 6 severe patients were subjected to LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis and quantification. This approach found 3 peaks sig-nificantly downregulated in patients vs controls (LPC18:0, PC32:1 and PC40:6), confirmed 4 of the 5 differential peaks found by the first approach between mild and severe, as well identified 3 PC (36:0 or p38:6, 36:2 and 36:3) and one sphingomyelin form (SM24:1) decreased in severe patients. These results indicate that some plasma phospholipid signatures may be able to discriminate mild and severe forms of CF, and shows for the first time that MALDI-TOF and ClinProTools may be a suitable methodology for the search of lipid markers in CF. EPIX is developing novel small molecules that can correct the folding defect of the \u2206F508 CFTR mutant, leading to increased cell surface expression and accordingly enhance CFTR function. We have previously presented an EPIX-generated full length model of wild type CFTR, from which a model of the intracellular domains of \u2206F508 CFTR had been generated. With this model a total of five in silico screening campaigns were carried out that targeted four different sites in the domain-domain interfaces of \u2206F508 CFTR. In parallel, a ligand-based pharmacophore screen was conducted. A prioritized set of 100 to 300 compounds from each in silico screen was purchased and tested in biological assays. Active hits were identified in a highthroughput assay employing FRT cells that stably express the human \u2206F508 CFTR and the halide-sensitive yellow fluorescent protein (Galietta et al. Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 2001; 281:C1734-42) . Hits were confirmed in Ussing chamber assays with FRT cells expressing \u2206F508 CFTR. Short circuit current changes were recorded in response to subsequent additions of 10 \u00b5M forskolin, 100 \u00b5M IBMX and 20 \u00b5M genistein.",

            "text": "A compound identified from the pharmacophore screen was the starting point for the most advanced lead series. As previously described, this series is unique from published CFTR modulators because the compounds have dual corrector-potentiator activity. Based on our FRT cell Ussing chamber results, we have improved the corrector efficacy ~6-fold (24 h incubation with 10 \u00b5M compound) from the first lead compound, and these compounds achieve ~3-fold more correction over basal activity than corrector 4a (6 \u00b5M). The additional potentiator activity helps to boost the forskolin-induced current to 10-fold of that observed for vehicle-treated control cells. Compound activity has been confirmed in Ussing chamber experiments with primary CF human bronchial epithelial (hBE) cells. In these cells the best compounds to-date achieve forskolin-induced currents that are ~3-fold larger than vehicle-treated cells. Equally, the current that can be inhibited with 10 \u00b5M CFTR(inh)-172 is 2-3 fold greater than that from vehicle-treated cells. Increased Band C formation was observed in cell surface biotinylation experiments after 24 h incubation with compound using HeLa cells expressing \u2206F508 CFTR; thus confirming the compound-mediated correction of the folding defect of \u2206F508 CFTR. The substantial improvements in compound activity have achieved efficacy levels close to what is considered necessary for beneficial effects in \u2206F508 CF patients.",

Physiology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada; 4. Biochemistry, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, Netherlands; 5. Cell Biology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, Netherlands Cystic fibrosis (CF) results from mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The most frequent mutation, deletion of phenylalanine 508 (DF508), causes a folding defect that inhibits trafficking to the plasma membrane. DF508 retains some anion channel function if it reaches the cell surface, which makes it an attractive target for pharmacotherapeutics. We constructed a novel high-throughput (HTS) cell based assay to test the ability of small molecules to restore DF508 CFTR trafficking to the plasma membrane. As marine sponges are a rich source of natural products having novel chemical structures and potent biological activities, we investigated 720 sponge extracts for their ability to correct DF508 trafficking. After 6 rounds of purification and HTS assay, we isolated three closely related members of the latonduine family of alkaloids having corrector activity from the Stylissa group of sponges. These compounds increased CFTR surface expression up to 80% with detectable channel activity at 1 nM concentration. Results were confirmed in the airway epithelial cell line CFBE, which is derived from a cystic fibrosis patient homozygous for DF508. Latonduine A was tested further in vivo using a mouse salivary secretion assay. CFTR-dependent secretion increased 4-fold when CF mice received 0.25 mg/kg latonduine A twice daily for 2 days by intraperitoneal injection. A biotinylated analog of latonduine A was prepared to identify molecular targets by affinity purification and mass spectrometry. Reducing the expression of several putative targets by siRNA knockdown led to partial rescue of functional CFTR. These compounds and their potential target proteins are currently under active investigation.",

            "text": "Supported through the BREATHE program funded by the CCFF and CIHR. Small molecule agents that overcome the primary \u2206F508-CFTR processing defect (CFTR Correctors) are being pursued as therapies for cystic fibrosis (CF). Several such compounds from high-throughput drug screening (HTS) programs are available for study through the CFFT Modulator Library (R.J. Bridges, Rosalind Franklin University). We previously reported a comparison of the first four corrector agents available through the library, indicating a rank order of Corr-4a>VRT-325=VRT-640\u2265Corr-3a by short-circuit (Isc) assays of CFTR Clchannel function. We have since extended this study to 13 additional compounds, using forskolin (20 \u00b5M)and genistein (50 \u00b5M)-stimulated Isc to evaluate \u2206F508-CFTR activity at the plasma membrane. Experiments were conducted in FRT and CFBE41omonolayers stably transduced with \u2206F508-CFTR. In \u2206F508 FRT monolayers, the cell type frequently used in large-scale HTS programs, \u2206F508 correction rank order was observed as follows: (Corr-4c, -15Jf, -4d = Corr-4a)>(Corr-2b, -2i, -5a, -5c, dynasore = low temperature (27 o C x 48 hrs))>(Corr-3d, cmpd-48, KM11057 = vehicle control)>(C8 and KM11060) (p<0.05 between groups). In CFBE41o-cells using an identical Ussing chamber protocol, rank order was similar except for low temperature (as previously reported): 27 o C >(Corr-4c, -4d)>(all other compounds = Corr-4a = vehicle control)>(C8 and KM11060) (p<0.05). Three of the most active correctors, Corr-4a, -4c and -4d, are all bismethylbithiazoles. Interestingly, a fourth compound of that class, Corr-15Jf, was active in the more permissive FRT model but not CFBE41o-, reinforcing that important differences exist between commonly utilized cell models. In FRT cells, each compound augmented both forskolin-and genistein-induced Isc, with the exception of Corr-4c and -4d, which only increased forskolin response (p<0.05 vs. vehicle control). In CFBE41o-(known to be relatively refractory to cAMP-based activation) treated with Corr-4d, increase in Isc mediated by both forskolin and genistein was observed, whereas Corr-4c increased genistein, but not forskolin, response (p<0.05 vs. vehicle control). The activity profile (across both cell lines) of Corr-4c and -4d resembles that of Corr-4a, and may provide a basis to discern distinct mechanisms induced by particular compound scaffolds or chemical subgroups (e.g. Corr-15Jf). Recent preclinical and clinical results using VX-770 suggest the primary airway cell model may predict in vivo efficacy. Complementary studies of the CFFT library in fully differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial monolayers are in progress, and preliminary results suggest correction in some (but not all) \u2206F508/\u2206F508 donor cells. Comparison with cell lines may help determine the optimal model for future modulator screening. In aggregate, these findings highlight the importance of secondary studies in multiple cell models to evaluate compounds emerging from HTS programs. Difference in efficacy, activation profile, and activity across multiple cell models (i.e. spectrum of activity) may provide compound signatures that yield new insights regarding the mechanisms underlying correction of \u2206F508 processing and gating, and could be used to construct optimized treatment paradigms for the \u2206F508 mutation.",

The major CF causing mutant, deltaF508-CFTR, results in a misfolded protein that fails to traffic out of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Introduction of second site mutations that disrupt a di-arginine (RXR)-based ER retention motif in the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1) (R 553 XR 555 ) rescues the trafficking defect of deltaF508-CFTR. We hypothesize that if the R 553 XR 555 motif mediates retention of the native deltaF508-CFTR protein in situ, peptides that mimic this motif (CF-RXR) should antagonize mistrafficking mediated by aberrant exposure of the endogenous RXR motif. We generated CF-RXR peptides conjugated to the cell-penetrating peptide Tat (CPP-CF-RXR) to facilitate intracellular delivery and investigated their efficacy in rescuing the mistrafficking and dysfunction of deltaF508-CFTR. Using N-glycan processing, we demonstrate that CPP-CF-RXR is effective at increasing surface expression of deltaF508-CFTR. The increase in surface expression in the presence of CPP-CF-RXR was confirmed using fluorescent antibodies directed against a deltaF508-CFTR construct bearing an HA-epitope in the fourth extracellular loop, as monitored by FACS. Furthermore, CPP-CF-RXR improved deltaF508-CFTR channel function as assessed in cell lines by YFP quenching and Iodide efflux assays as well as in respiratory epithelial tissues obtained from CF patients assessed by Ussing Chamber assays. Taken together, our data suggests that abnormal accessibility of the RXR motif present in NBD1 is a key determinant of mistrafficking of the major CF causing mutant and furthermore addition of peptides mimicking this motif is capable of rescuing deltaF508-CFTR trafficking and function.",

Several compounds that potentiate and/or correct mutant CFTR function are in active preclinical or early clinical development for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF). Previous studies in patients with mild CF genotypes (CFTR class IV or V mutations) indicated that low levels (10-20%) of normal CFTR function are sufficient to reduce disease severity and may therefore have significant therapeutic effects in CF. Therefore, highly sensitive and specific assays will be necessary to determine effects of potentiator and corrector compounds on CFTR function in clinical trials. Our previous studies demonstrated that intestinal current measurements (ICM) are a sensitive method to quantitate wild-type and mutant CFTR function in native rectal biopsy tissues (Hirtz et al. Gastroenterology 2004; 127:1085 -1095 . However, the sensitivity of this assay to monitor effects of potentiators and/or correctors remains unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of ICM to detect effects of a pharmacological potentiator on CFTR function in native non-CF and CF rectal tissues. To achieve this goal, we used the potentiator compound 1-EBIO, previously shown to improve CFTR-mediated Clsecretion in cultured cells by coordinate activation of luminal CFTR Clchannels and basolateral Ca 2+ -dependent and clotrimazole-sensitive K + channels (Devor et al. Am J Physiol. 1996; 271:L785-95) , and tested its effects in rectal biopsies obtained from CF patients carrying mild CF genotypes (class IV or V mutations; n = 12), severe CF genotypes (class I-III mutations; n = 27) and non-CF controls (n = 18). To determine effects of 1-EBIO on CFTR-mediated Clsecretion, rectal biopsies were mounted in perfused micro-Ussing chambers, pretreated with amiloride (10 \u00b5M) and indomethacine (10 \u00b5M), and sequentially exposed to IBMX/forskolin (100 \u00b5M/1\u00b5M), 1-EBIO (500 \u00b5M) and clotrimazole (30 \u00b5M) or CFTR inh-172 (20 \u00b5M). In non-CF rectal biopsies, cAMP-dependent activation (IBMX/forskolin) induced a large Clsecretory response (\u2206I sc-cAMP = -130.3 \u00b1 19.2 \u00b5A/cm 2 ) that was further increased by 1-EBIO (\u2206I sc-EBIO = -50.2 \u00b1 13.1 \u00b5A/cm 2 ; P < 0.001). 1-EBIO-induced I sc was significantly inhibited by clotrimazole and CFTR inh-172 . In rectal biopsies from CF patients with mild CFTR mutations, cAMP stimulation induced residual Clsecretory responses (\u2206I sc-cAMP = -40.7 \u00b1 13.1 \u00b5A/cm 2 ) in the range of ~31% of non-CF controls. In this group, 1-EBIO further increased residual CFTR-mediated Clsecretion by ~33% (\u2206I sc-EBIO = -16.4 \u00b1 5.1 \u00b5A/cm 2 ; P < 0.001). In contrast, cAMP activation and 1-EBIO failed to induce Clsecretion in rectal biopsies from CF patients with severe CFTR mutations. We conclude that (i) 1-EBIO potentiates CFTR-mediated Clsecretion by coactivation of luminal CFTR Clchannels and basolateral K + channels, and (ii) that ICM is a sensitive technique to monitor pharmacological activation of low levels of residual CFTR function in native rectal tissues. These results provide a proof of concept that ICM is a suitable biomarker for the assessment of potentiator and/or corrector effects on CFTR function in future clinical trials.",

The training and expertise gained by the sites through participation in this study has created a network primed to conduct future intervention studies involving preschool lung function testing. Objective: Pulmonary exacerbations, defined by an increase in respiratory symptoms and/or a decrease in pulmonary function, are a hallmark of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Management often requires hospitalization for IV antibiotics and increased frequency of airway clearance. In older children and adults, changes in pulmonary function testing are frequently used to determine response to therapy; however, little objective data is available on therapeutic response in infants. Our objective was to determine the change in lung function testing in a population of CF infants who underwent clinically indicated infant pulmonary function testing (PFTs) before and after hospitalization for management of pulmonary exacerbation.",

Pediatrics, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, USA Methodology is available for the measurement of lung volumes and forced expiratory flows in infants comparable to older children and adults. However, these tests require sedation and are time-consuming. The multibreath washout (MBW) test involves the measurement of a tracer gas as it is either breathed in and/or out by a subject. MBW can be performed during regular tidal breathing in subjects of any age. Besides Functional Residual Capacity (FRC), one of the measurements that can be obtained is the Lung Clearance Index (LCI). LCI has advantages over spirometry in that it can be measured easily in all age groups and normative values are similar from early childhood to adulthood, which is not the case with most other PFTs. The recent availability of ultrasonic gas mass-molar ratio analyzers with fast response rates has permitted the development of devices that are more practical for the evaluation of LCI in infants. We wanted to evaluate the feasibility of conducting these measurements in infants with cystic fibrosis (CF) and compare their performance to other coventional measurements. The MBW procedure has been implemented at Stanford University with the use of a Exhalyzer \u00ae D (Eco Medics AG, Switzerland). The tracer gas used for the measurements is 4% sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Measurements were performed at the time of conventional infant PFT. Once the test was completed, the infant breathed through a face mask connected to a bypass flow arranged to provide room air at a flow that met the infant's inspiratory demand. The tracer gas was blended in to the bypass flow and its flow was controlled manually to start and end the gas wash-in. This was determined by visual inspection of the breath-by-breath time-concentration curve. A total of three maneuvers free of artifact were performed and the data saved for later analysis. We have at this time been able to test 9 infants with CF who underwent routine pulmonary evaluation. The testing procedure was well tolerated and completed without difficulty in all subjects. In 7 of these infants the measurement were performed under sedation and after completing RVRTC and plethysmography measurements. In the remaining 2 the measurements were performed without sedation. The mean (SD) LCI observed in this group was 10.7 \u00b1 2.3, with the reported normal in healthy infants being <7.8. For the infants where plethysmography data was available, the FRC obtained by MBW correlated fairly well with the plethysmographic measurements (r=0.80). Of note is that although there was some correlation between LCI and RVRTC parameters that assess for the presence of airflow obstruction (r=0.46 for FEV0.5 and r=0.48 for FEF25-75), even infants with normal RVRTC parameters (greater than 85% predicted) had abnormal values for LCI. We conclude that MBW is a safe and feasible method for the assessment of pulmonary function in infants. With our methodology the LCI is easily estimated and identifies the presence of ventilation inhomogeneity among this group of infants with CF, as previously reported. Further, the LCI seems to be more sensitive to the presence of early airway disease in children than other conventional measurements of airway obstruction. LCI has good potential as a surrogate measure of airway obstruction in children with cystic fibrosis.",

            "text": "Conclusion: Arikace\u2122 given once daily for 28d at doses of 70 mg, 140 mg, and 560 mg was well tolerated in subjects with CF. Twenty-five subjects in Cohort 3 (560 mg) have completed treatment and are being followed for durability of response for 2 months off-treatment. Baseline characteristics and clinical parameters of the subjects enrolled in this randomized, placebocontrolled study of Arikace\u2122 for inhalation may suggest a profile of subjects with CF who may benefit from this treatment. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding CFTR, an ion channel involved in fluid regulation across epithelia. Sweat chloride is a biomarker used in the diagnosis of CF, with chloride levels \u226560 mmol/L indicative of disease. VX-770 is a CFTR potentiator under evaluation for the treatment of CF. As a systemic agent, it is hoped that VX-770 would improve CFTR function in the lungs and other organs, including the sweat gland. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the safety and tolerability of VX-770 in adults with CF and a G551D-CFTR allele. Sweat chloride was also tested. Part 1 was a cross-over design that randomized subjects to placebo (n=4) or VX-770 q12h at either 25 and 75 mg (n=8) or 75 and 150 mg (n=8) doses in two 14-day periods. Part 2 included distinct subjects from Part 1 randomized to placebo (n=4), 150 mg VX-770 (n=8), or 250 mg VX-770 (n=7) q12h for 28 days. Throughout the study VX-770 was generally well-tolerated and no drug-related serious adverse events occurred. In Part 1, mean\u00b1SD baseline sweat chloride for the study population was 101.4\u00b112.9 mmol/L. At Day 14, mean chloride was near or below the diagnostic threshold for CF in the VX-770 75 mg (60.9\u00b121.8 mmol/L) and 150 mg (47.5\u00b114.8 mmol/L) groups. Changes from baseline in the VX-770 groups were significant (P<0.001 within-group and vs placebo). In Part 2, the median (range) sweat chloride concentration at baseline was 98.6 (80.5-117.0) mmol/L. At Day 28, sweat chloride levels were 52.0 (28.0-84.0) and 64.0 (39.0-77.5) mmol/L in the VX-770 150 and 250 mg groups, respectively, versus 102.5 (100.0-107.0) mmol/L for placebo. The changes from baseline in the VX-770 groups were significant (P<0.05 within-group and vs placebo) at the first treatment assessment (Day 3) and at treatment end (Day 28). Combining Parts 1 and 2 at Day 14, a total of 6 (75.0%), 11 (84.6%), 13 (92.9%), and 4 (57.1%) subjects in the VX-770 25, 75, 150, and 250 mg dose groups, respectively, were responders by the pre-specified criterion of a change from baseline of \u226520 mmol/L. No placebo-treated subjects were responders. Sweat sodium changes with VX-770 paralleled sweat chloride. Serum aldosterone was measured in Part 1 and did not change significantly. Correlations between change from baseline in FEV1 and sweat chloride in treatment groups were generally weak and not conclusive, which may be due to the small sample size. In conclusion, a rapid significant improvement in sweat chloride followed administration of VX-770 that was near or below the diagnostic threshold for CF, suggesting that further evaluation of VX-770 in larger studies is warranted. Background: This open-label study included 274 patients with CF (age > 6 years with pulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and FEV1 > 25% and < 75% predicted) from 71 study centers (US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand) who participated in one of two previous double-blind studies of AZLI 75 mg (dosed twice [BID] or three times [TID] daily). Patients received AZLI (as assigned in the previous studies) for nine 28 day courses, separated by 28 day off treatment intervals.",

P. aeruginosa clinical isolates and PAO1 were grown at stationary phase under aerobiosis in the presence or absence of AZM. We demonstrated that conditioned medium from the clinical strain AA2, unlike CM from the laboratory strain PAO1, induced a statistically significant increase of about 4 times of IL-8 mRNA, in CF airway epithelial cells. This induction was reduced about 20% when AA2 was grown in the presence of AZM, suggesting that this macrolide reduces Pa pathogenicity. In the attempt to gain information on the identity of the molecules released by Pa strains before and after treatment with AZM and to identify candidate molecules involved in Pa virulence, we applied a recent proteomic approach (2DC-MS/MS). Two-dimensional capillary chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry (also named MudPIT) identified polypeptides released by PAO1 and AA2 in the absence and presence of drug.

Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) represents a promising potential gene therapy vector for cystic fibrosis (CF). However, the most commonly-studied rAAV serotype (rAAV2) is inefficient at transducing human airway epithelial (HAE) cells from the apical membrane. Interestingly, rAAV transduction from the basolateral membrane is highly efficient. In contrast, rAAV1 is efficient at transducing HAE with no polarity bias. Differences in intracellular trafficking of rAAV virions have been thought to underlie the transduction differences observed with these two serotypes. We hypothesized that rAAV1 and rAAV2 utilize similar intracellular trafficking pathways from the basolateral membrane of polarized HAE, resulting in efficient transduction. However, we surmise that these two serotypes utilize distinct apical endosomal trafficking pathways, leading to efficient nuclear import and transduction in the case of rAAV1, but resulting in poor transduction with rAAV2 due to routing of the virus to a compartment that inefficiently processes the virion. In order to test these hypotheses, we conducted transduction experiments using rAAV particles labeled with fluorescent dyes. Following apical infection of polarized HAE cultures with labeled rAAV1 or rAAV2, rAAV1 was distributed throughout the cytoplasm of epithelial cells while rAAV2 was sequestered in the apical cytoplasm. These findings support inefficient intracellular trafficking of rAAV2 as compared to rAAV1. In addition, we utilized co-infections with two sets of virions labeled with different fluorophores to directly compare the apical and basolateral trafficking of rAAV1 or rAAV2, and also to directly compare rAAV1 and rAAV2 trafficking from either the apical or basolateral membranes in the same cells. Greater co-localization was observed between apically and basolaterally-applied rAAV1 than for rAAV2, indicating that rAAV1 uses similar intracellular trafficking pathways for apical and basolateral infection, but rAAV2 does not. In addition, we observed little co-localization between rAAV1 and rAAV2 applied simultaneously from the apical membrane, suggesting that these viruses use distinct apical trafficking pathways. In contrast, basolateral co-infection resulted in more significant co-localization between rAAV1 and rAAV2, demonstrating that these viruses utilize similar trafficking pathways following basolateral infection. We also analyzed the requirements of the cellular proteins Rac1 and Rab5, which are involved in vesicular trafficking, on rAAV apical and basolateral transduction using dominant-negative constructs. We found that rAAV1 and rAAV2 both require these proteins for efficient transduction from the apical and basolateral membranes, but to different degrees, highlighting the distinct biology of intracellular trafficking in HAE cells between the different serotypes. The results of this study have shown that intracellular trafficking of rAAV is directly influenced by the viral capsid sequence. An understanding of the basic biology of rAAV trafficking in HAE cells will be essential for determining the particular characteristics needed for a successful gene therapy vector for CF. The design of safe and efficient vectors for gene delivery is a current challenge for cystic fibrosis (CF) gene therapy. Viral-based systems are for now, one of the most efficient methods to deliver genes into the cells. However, immunogenic and oncogenic complications are two of the main disadvantages of this transfection approach. As an alternative, synthetic carriers have been developed, notably based on cationic lipids. We have previously demonstrated the efficiency of our original vector, especially in vivo. However, to enhance cationic lipid transfection ability, their design and formulation have to be adapted to overcome the extra-and intracellular-barriers.",

            "text": "Here, our objective was to evaluate the in vivo transfection capacity of three cationic carriers (KLN47, EP8e, BSV-18) that differ by the nature of their hydrophobic domain, respectively oleyl, linoleyl and phytanyl chains. Formulated in NaCl 0.9%, they are associated with 50 \u00b5g of pDNA encoding Luciferase. Then, lipoplexes are injected in the tail vein of mice and Luc expression was analyzed up to 72 h by in vivo bioluminometer (NightOwl II, Berthold). We first observed that Luc expression was exclusively located into the lungs. Secondly, the highest transgene expression was obtained 24 h after transfection and progressively decreased up to three days. Thirdly, EP8e and BSV-18 were much more efficient than KLN47. Then, contrary to KLN47, both new vectors did not induce any mice death and their lower toxicity was confirmed by ALAT/ASAT measurements. Moreover, if they induced a very weak inflammation, no immunogenicity stimulation was measured. The structure-activity relationship is crucial for a gain of effectiveness and innocuity. The majority of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients acquire chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection. Treatment of the chronic biofilm infection is difficult due to tolerance and development of resistance to antibiotics. Therefore, adjunctive treatment possibilities are pivotal. The course of the chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection is characterized by development of a pronounced antibody production and a T-helper 2 (Th2)-dominated immune response, which correlates to a poor prognosis. In contrast, a more Th1-dominated response in CF has been shown to correlate with a better lung function. Since the serum concentrations of GM-CSF in CF correlated with a more Th1-dominated response, we speculated whether GM-CSF treatment could induce a Th1 response in susceptible Th2-reacting BALB/c mice with chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection. Dendritic cells (DC) would presumably be mediating such effect.",

In addition, the GM-CSFinduced modulation of the Th1/Th2 balance is probably mediated through the pulmonary LC-derived DCs. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The most common mutation, \u2206F508-CFTR, is a temperature-sensitive, trafficking mutant with reduced chloride transport and exaggerated immune response. The \u2206F508-CFTR is misfolded, ubiquitinated, and prematurely degraded by proteasome mediateddegradation. We recently demonstrated that selective inhibition of proteasomal pathway by the drug bortezomib (pyrazylcarbonyl-Phe-Leu-boronate, a.k.a. Velcade or PS-341) ameliorates inflammatory pathophysiology in CF cells. This proteasomal drug is an extremely potent, stable, reversible and selective inhibitor of chymotryptic threonine protease activity. A main concern in considering the proteasome as a therapeutic target is the theoretical risk that multiple processes may be affected by proteasome inhibitors. The risk of global suppression of proteasomal degradation may outweigh the favorable anti-inflammatory effect we observed. To overcome this challenge, we developed a nano-based approach that uses drug loaded biodegradable nanoparticle (PLGA-PEG-Bortezomib) to provide controlled drug delivery at lower doses, which demonstrates the promise to rescue the CF lung disease in murine model. The in vitro release kinetics of drug from nanoparticle was quantified by proteasomal activity assay from days 1-7 that showed slow drug release from day 2-7 with maximum inhibition at day 7. For in vivo release kinetics, these drug-loaded nanoparticles were fluorescently labeled, and administered to wild type (WT) and CF knockout (CFKO) mice by intranasal route. Whole-body optical imaging of the treated live animals demonstrates efficient delivery of particles to murine lungs, 2 hrs post treatment, followed by biodegradation and release over time. The efficacy of drug release in WT and CFKO mice lungs was determined by quantifying the changes in proteasomal activity (< 2 fold) and ability to rescue the Pseudomonas aeruginosa LPS induced inflammation, 3-5 day post treatment. In conclusion, we have developed a novel drug delivery system that has been engineered to bypass the mucus barrier and provide sustained drug delivery in CF lungs. We are also developing methods to encapsulate selected known CF correctors, potentiators and antimicrobials, in PLGA-PEG based nanoparticles to develop this nanosystem as a therapeutic delivery vehicle for variety of CF drugs.

The finding that the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is present in human red blood cells (RBC) opens new perspectives for blood-based diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF). We developed such a blood-based CF test in which the trivalent cation Gadolinium (Gd 3+ ) induces hemolysis of RBC from healthy donors but fails to hemolyse RBC from CF patients (Stumpf et al. Physiological concept for a blood based CFTR test. Cell Physiol Biochem 2006; 17:29-36) . Actually, the selectivity and sensitivity of this method will be tested in an ongoing multicentric clinical trial.",

Chronic colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the resulting progressive loss of lung function ultimately leads to respiratory failure in many patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The P. aeruginosa virulence factor hemolytic phospholipase C (PlcH) is an extracellular protein able to cleave the phosphorylcholine head group from phosphatidylcholine, a major component of lung surfactant, resulting in surfactant dysfunction. Surfactant dysfunction is hypothesized to be one of many factors resulting in poor lung function in P. aeruginosa colonized patients. We presented data at the previous NACFC meeting showing the significant impact of PlcH on host lung physiology during infection which suggested that PlcH inhibition may be a possible anti-pseudomonal therapy. The ether-linked phosphocholine compound miltefosine is a promising inhibitor of PlcHR enzyme function. The kinetic analysis of miltefosine inhibition of purified PlcH enzymatic activity will be presented. To test the efficacy of miltefosine as a potential therapeutic agent, we used our mouse model of P. aeruginosa PAO1 lung infection to determine the effects of miltefosine on infection progression and lung physiology as determined using a small animal ventilator (flexiVent, SCIREQ). Administration of miltefosine via intraperitoneal injection did not lead to differences in viable bacterial counts from the lungs and did not alter the number of immune cells in the airway lumen. However, measurements of lung mechanics, including pressure-volume loops and impedance mechanics, demonstrate significant protection of the surfactant system and resulting lung physiology. We are conducting dose titration studies of miltefosine to assess the optimal dose and delivery method to prevent lung damage by P. aeruginosa. These data suggest that, by limiting surfactant dysfunction, miltefosine may be an effective addition to the therapeutic regimen against P. aeruginosa . Ca 2+ activated Clchannels (CaCC) are co-expressed with CFTR in airway surface epithelia and up-regulated in cystic fibrosis (CF). The presence and functional properties of CaCC make it a possible therapeutic target to compensate for the deficiency in Clsecretion in CF epithelia. CaCC is activated by an increase in cytosolic Ca 2+ . The intracellular Ca 2+ increase not only activates epithelial CaCCs, but also inhibits epithelial Na + hyperabsorption, which may also beneficial in CF.",

Herein, we performed a mass spectrometry analysis and identified 32 proteins that showed significant differences in their expression level between spiperone treated and non-treated CF airway epithelial cells. Four of those proteins are involved in the tyrosine-phosphorylation pathway and three of them are expressed in our airway cells. Among these three proteins, proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) has been shown to be implicated in PLC activation and increased release of Ca 2+ in endothelial cells.

Previously, we characterized the anti-inflammatory effect of synthetic triterpenoids in CF. We find that two of these compounds, CDDO and CDDO-Me, exhibit potent anti-inflammatory effects in a number of models of CF including: 9HTEo-(pCEP compared pCEPR (CF)) and 16HBEo-(sense compared antisense (CF)) cells, human primary tracheal epithelial cells (HPTE, treated with vehicle vs. 20\u00b5M CFTR inh -172 (CF)), and R117H mutant mice vs. normal littermates. Inflammation in our models is excessive compared with normal controls. In stimulated CF cell models CDDO decreases inflammatory cytokine (IL-8 and IL-6) production by 23-57% from non-treated cells, correcting excessive inflammation. A similar effect was observed for CDDO-Me in HPTE inhibited with the CFTR inh -172. In mice stimulated with LPS, cytokine production (IL-8, IL-6, TNF\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2) was decreased to background levels when animals received intratracheal administration of CDDO prior to stimulation. No adverse effects were observed for any of the CDDO or CDDO-Me doses used (max in cells: 300 nM, max in animals: 5mg/kg). Taken together these data are compelling evidence for the potential utility of these compounds in CF. Therefore, we used 2 approaches to study the mechanism of action of these compounds. First, we treated HPTE cells and mutant R117H mice with 300 nM or 5 mg/kg CDDO, respectively. Three days later, we stimulated CFTR inh -172 inhibited HPTE cells with 10 ng/mL TNF\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2 and CF mice with LPS. Controls received vehicle (25\u00b5L DMSO). Whole cell protein was prepared from HPTE cells or mouse lungs, separated by 2D gels, and compared to controls by densitometry. Differential expression of 103 proteins by >2 fold in HPTE cells treated with CDDO vs. vehicle was observed. Of these, 87 were concordant with proteins found to be different in CF mouse lungs treated with CDDO vs. vehicle. GeneGo TM pathway analysis revealed that CDDO activated stress responses, especially the Nrf2 regulated antioxidant/anti-electrophile response element, and improved the ability of cells to respond to stimulation. For our second approach, we conducted metabolomic screens of the effect of CDDO treatment on stimulated HPTE cells inhibited with CFTR inh -172 vs. controls. HPTE from 6 different individuals were cultured at an air liquid interface and allowed to form tight junctions. Metabolomic analyses revealed CDDO effects that were concordant with those observed in proteomic analyses, with enhancement of stress responses resulting in the normalization of stress responses. These data were consistent with increased activation of Nrf2 and the enhanced activation of the antioxidant/anti-electrophile response element. We conclude that CDDO and CDDO-Me correct cytokine production in CF models to normal levels. Normal responses are not diminished and no cell toxicity is observed for maximum doses. Proteomic and metabolomic screens of the effect of these compounds are consistent with a mechanism of action that involves the activation of Nrf2 and the antioxidant/anti-electrophile response element, which significantly corrects aberrant inflammatory responses in CF models.",

Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life limiting autosomal recessive disease and is due to mutations in CFTR gene. CF mutations cause a massive pro-inflammatory phenotype in the lung arising from aberrant expression of inflammatory genes. Recently microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small endogenous RNA molecules, have emerged as important targets in the frontier of biomedical research. miRNAs regulate gene expression by targeting mRNAs for degradation and/or translational repression. The dysregulation of specific miRNAs has been demonstrated in a variety of diseases in humans including cancer, heart disease and diabetes. However, to date there has been no study targeted towards examining the role of miRNAs in CF. The present study is targeted to investigate how aberrant expression of miRNAs in CF lung epithelial cells leads to the disease phenotype.",

DTNB, a cell impermeable free sulfhydryl blocker, inhibited in vitro gene transfer by SS-DNA NP in dose-dependent manner, indicating that this mechanism is related to extracellular thiol/disulfide exchange. We then examined the colloidal stability of CSand SS-DNA NPs in cell culture medium. Sedimentation assay revealed that SS-DNA NP but not CS-DNA NP could be sedimented after incubation in culture medium with cell contact. Ellman's assay confirmed the presence of extracellular thiols secreted by the cell which could reduce the disulfide bonds in SS-DNA NPs. In vitro luciferase assay indicated the level of reporter gene expression correlated with the level of extracellular thiols in two cell lines transfected with SS-DNA NP. The release of the PEG moiety from SS-DNA NP in cell culture upon disulfide bond reduction was detected by SDS-PAGE and PEG specific iodine staining. Electron microscopy and fluorescence quenching assay further suggested that dePEGylation of SS-DNA NP by extracellular thiols caused aggregation and condensation of the DNA NPs. Higher in vitro gene transfer by SS-DNA NP could be partially attributed to this aggregation, since a partial increase of reporter gene expression was observed when cells were transfected with non-PEGylated DNA NPs which also aggregated in culture medium.

The prevalence of biofilms in human disease and in the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients constitutes a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The increased antibiotic tolerance of bacteria in biofilms is a significant problem as traditional antibiotic strategies become less effective against biofilm eradication. Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in the lungs of CF patients are characterised by overproduction of alginate or extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) produced by the bacteria themselves. This study investigated a novel treatment strategy to determine if the susceptibility of bacterial biofilms to antibiotic/antimicrobial therapy could be modulated by treatment with defined alginate oligomers. Alginates are linear polymers of \u03b2-D-mannuronic acid (M) and/or \u03b1-L-guluronic acid (G). The ability of alginates to potentiate the activity of antimicrobial/antibiotic therapy against Pseudomonas sp. was investigated in standard MICs and, against biofilms, using an established minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) assay. Pseudomonas biofilms were pre-treated with alginate oligomers with a contiguous sequence of G residues (ca. 2600 M W ) having at least 90-95% of the monomer residues as G residues. These studies demonstrated MBEC values of a range of antibiotics including amikacin, tobramycin, oxytetracycline and ciprofloxacin were reduced (by up to three orders of magnitude) when Pseudomonas sp. biofilms were pre-treated with a 6% alginate oligomer solution. The effect of the alginate oligomers on bacterial biofilm populations was studied using live/dead staining, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy. These studies demonstrated the ability of the alginate oligomers to effectively disrupt in vitro biofilms with loss of EPS demonstrated by SEM at higher alginate oligomer concentrations. This study highlights the potential of alginate oligomers, in combination therapy, to reduce the tolerance of established biofilms to conventional antibiotic/antimicrobial therapy. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutation in the cftr gene, encoding for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMPdependent anionic channel. The deletion of Phe508 (delF508) in CFTR first nucleotide binding domain is the most frequent mutation in CF patients in the Caucasian population. DelF508CFTR is a misfolded, rapidly degraded protein. Its rescue is a major goal for CF therapy. A recent study shows that treating Estradiol (17\u03b2 E) a delF508CFTR airway cell line with 17\u03b2 restores delF508CFTR functional expression, in a NHERF1 (Na-H Exchanger Regulatory Factor 1)-dependent fashion (Fanelli et al. Biol Cell 2008; 100:399-412) . In the present study we hypothized that resveratrol (a phytoalexin with a phytoestrogenic properties) may have a similar effect. The aim of this study was to test if the treatment of cells with resveratrol leads to the functional expression of delF508CFTR. The effects of resveratrol were compared to those of 17\u03b2 E regarding the expression and function of CFTR/delF508CFTR. Experiments were performed on a human breast cancer cell line (MCF7, endogenously expressing wild-type CFTR and highly sensitive to estrogenic compounds) and a human pancreatic cell line (CFPAC1, endogenously expressing delF508CFTR). Immunoblot and immunocytochemistry were used to evaluate the expression of NHERF1 and CFTR/delF508CFTR. The function of CFTR was evaluated by a fluorescent dye 6-methoxy-N-3-sulfo-propylquinolinium, SPQ. Cells were treated with 17\u03b2 E (50 \u00b5M) and of resveratrol (50 \u00b5M) for 2 or 18h. cAMP-dependent anionic efflux was measured in CFPAC non-confluent cells by measuring the rate of fluorescent change after perfusion of cells with a solution containing a PKA-activated cocktail.",

Background: In response to infection, neutrophils accumulate in the cystic fibrosis (CF) airway, yet at the tissue level the inflammatory response in the airway wall is lymphocytic. T-cells accumulate at the distal level in areas of tissue damage suggesting an involvement in respiratory or immune cell activation leading to tissue remodelling. For example, IL-17 is derived from a Th17 T-cell subset and is a potent inducer of neutrophil recruitment to the lungs. Expression of the CC chemokine and T-cell chemoattractant RANTES by the bronchial epithelium is undetectable in CF. However, platelets, which are not reported to express CFTR, are activated in patients with CF and are a source of RANTES. We previously reported that copper induces oligomerisation of RANTES, generating the minimal tetrameric structure required for in vivo chemoattractant activity.",

One possible target for drug discovery aiming at treating CF is to correct the ionic imbalance through stimulation of an alternative ionic pathway that may compensate for the deficient CFTR dependent Clsecretion. In a previous study, we identified guanabenz as an in vitro activator of Ca 2+ -dependent Clchannel (CaCC) via a Ca 2+ influx in human nasal CF airway epithelial cell line (1) . In this new study, we determined the in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo effects of guanabenz on several CF or knock-out models.",

Guanabenz induced a depolarization inhibited by DIDS, niflumic acid and NPPB. These results confirmed guanabenz as an activator of CaCC in CF cell line. Secondly, by recording shortcircuit current (Isc) measurements in mice colonic epithelium, we demonstrated that 100 \u00b5M of guanabenz induced a non-CFTR dependent increase of Isc: \u2206Isc = 2.27 \u00b1 0.09 \u00b5A/cm 2 (N = 3) in wild type mice (cftr +/+ ) and \u2206Isc = 4.47 \u00b1 0.92 \u00b5A/cm 2 (N = 3) in knock-out mice (cftr -/-). This elevation of Isc is dose-dependent giving a half maximal effective concentration EC50 of 192.2 \u00b1 4.2 \u00b5M.

In CF patients, unregulated inflammatory processes overwhelm the normal neutrophil elastase (NE) / AAT balance, leading to accumulation of NE in the lung and ultimately to tissue damage. The rationale for inhaled AAT therapy is to treat the imbalance and prevent this destructive cycle.

Further study is warranted to elucidate the identity, function, and possible role of these as biomarkers. For example, in the setting of CFTR potentiator or corrector therapy, such protein markers might ultimately furnish a useful tool for assessing efficacy. The experiments also provide a means by which the mechanisms underlying exocrine dysfunction in CF might be better understood in the future. The development of gene therapy as a treatment for cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease has been limited in part by the lack of an animal model that presents a similar disease progression as humans. The generation of a porcine model of CF by somatic cell gene targeting and cloning to generate a CFTR null allele may provide the research community with an animal model that more closely mimics the human phenotype. We are optimizing a lentiviral vector for disease correction in this model by screening transduction efficiencies in well-differentiated primary cultures of pig airway epithelia (PAE) and wild-type pigs in vivo. Species-specific retroviral restriction factors may present barriers against lentiviral gene transfer. We contrasted the restrictive properties of human and pigs cells against both feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-and HIV-based vectors. Surprisingly, HIV-1 was restricted more by porcine cell lines and primary epithelia than was FIV. Using the FIV-based vector, we previously reported that the envelope glycoproteins from baculovirus (GP64), retrovirus (JSRV), coronavirus (SARS), and filovirus (Ebola) confer apical entry into differentiated primary cultures of human airway epithelia whereas VSV-G confers basolateral entry. Screening of the apical and basolateral transduction profiles of pseudotyped FIV of well-differentiated PAE resulted in gene transfer efficiency and polarity similar to that observed for human airway epithelia. In addition, we are testing the efficacy of multiple influenza A pseudotypes. Finally, we generated FIV vectors that express a variety of reporter genes including eGFP, mCherry, firefly luciferase, gaussia (secreted) luciferase, and nuclear targeted beta-galactosidase. Each of these reporters have attributes that make them suitable for measuring transduction efficiency and persistence in pig epithelial cells in vitro or in vivo. To date, our findings indicate that pseudotyped FIV lentiviral vectors confer similar tropisms in porcine epithelia as observed in human primary cultures and have implications for the selection of vectors and envelope pseudotypes appropriate for preclinical gene therapy studies in the porcine model. Background: Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) frequently suffer from infective exacerbations caused mainly by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and in a few cases by Burkholderia cepacia. Colonisation with both of these organisms is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, colonisation with Burkholderia cepacia (BC) is associated with an even poorer prognosis in many patients. There are many reports in the literature on the use of inhaled antibiotics leading to increased respiratory function and decreased numbers of infective exacerbations in patients colonised with Pseudomonas. However there is limited data available on patients infected with B. cepacia.",

Gilead Sciences, Seattle, WA, USA Introduction: The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised Respiratory Symptoms Score (CFQ-R RSS) is a disease-specific, validated, patientreported measure of respiratory symptoms, comprising six questions. In a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study (AIR-CF1), 164 patients with CF (age \u2265 6 years with pulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa and FEV 1 \u2265 25% and \u2264 75% predicted) from 67 study centers (US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand) received AZLI 75 mg three times daily for 28 days. The CFQ-R was completed at each study visit prior to any other study procedures. The primary endpoint was change from baseline at Day 28 in CFQ-R RSS. Patients treated with AZLI had significant improvement in CFQ-R RSS compared to those treated with placebo (\u22069.71, p=0.0005). One of the concerns of a composite score is that deleterious effects reported for a single question may be masked by beneficial effects reported in others. We investigated whether a particular question in the CFQ-R RSS contributed to the overall positive AZLI treatment effect.",

Thus an increase in CFTR activity is expected to increase Gm for chloride. Indeed changes in Gm have frequently been used to study CFTR activity in such large cells as Xenopus oocytes. However, the small size of mammalian cells and the technical difficulties of impaling these cells with microelectrodes precludes the use of this approach for drug discovery in epithelial cells. Fortunately FRT cells express CFTR in both the apical and basolateral membranes and therefore activation of CFTR is expected to increase the transepithelial conductance (Gt) for anions. The assay we developed utilizes the expected change in Gt as a measure of CFTR channel activity. \u2206F508-CFTR expressing FRT cells were grown on Costar HTS 24 well filter plates and Gt was measured using a WPI EVOMX device and modified electrodes that provide a precise, accurate and reproducible measure of Gt. The effects of compounds on CFTR expression levels (correctors) and gating (potentiation) were evaluated. Studies to date have demonstrated the measured changes in Gt are stimulated by cAMP agonists, increased by known correctors and potentiators in the CFFT compound panel and inhibited by Inh-172 and Gly-H-101. Low temperature treatment (27\u221eC) of \u2206F508-CFTR expressing FRT cells caused the most pronounced increase in Gt upon agonist stimulation. None of these effects were observed in parental untransfected FRT cells indicating the CFTR dependence of the Gt responses in CFTR expressing cells. Depending on the number of electrode probes one uses it is possible to measure 1 to 24 wells simultaneously. Routinely, we now use a four probe manifold and four EVOMX devices to measure four wells at once. Performed in this manner the Gt responses to the sequential addition of two agonists and an inhibitor can be completed on 96 filters in less than two hours.",

We have identified the non-viral gene transfer formulation pGM169/GL67A for the next phase of the UK Cystic Fibrosis Gene Therapy consortium clinical programme. Quantification of pGM169-derived vector specific mRNA by real-time quantitative TaqMan RT-PCR is a key outcome measure for our clinical programme, additionally we also determine endogenous CFTR mRNA levels allowing us to determine percentvector mRNA/endogenous mRNA ratio (%VE). Cell mixing, transgenic animal and mutational analysis suggest that a gene transfer formulation that achieves >5 %VE might be expected to be therapeutic. Simplistically, the determination of %VE in clinical samples is straightforward -standard methods exist for bronchial and nasal cell sampling, mRNA preparation and TaqMan RT-PCR. However, when we evaluated the performance of these standard methods in bronchial brushing samples from volunteer CF subjects it became apparent that the Residual Sensitivity (RS) of the assay (that value of %VE required for detection and quantification of successful gene expression) was at nearly 5 %VE. It was thus essential to refine our method by systematic optimisation of every individual step in the assay with the intention of reducing the RS to levels well below that required for therapeutic benefit. During initial sample collection we evaluated the impact of bronchial and nasal brushing methods, airway cell retrieval strategies and time allowed from sample removal to cellular preservation. We found that pooling bronchial brushings dramatically improved assay RS by minimising the fixed losses associated with mRNA purification. Furthermore, the speed of initial sample processing was found to be a key factor, and we now require that it is completed with 15 minutes. Nevertheless, mRNA yields from bronchial brushing samples remain the key limiting step in the assay. Consequently, in the TaqMan RT-PCR stages, we evaluated the impact on RS and assay range and precision of alternative sample division strategieshigher RNA usage per replicate with low replicate numbers and vice versa along with the impact of multiplexing vector and endogenous CFTR assay within the same replicate. While each one of these steps in isolation had a modest impact on assay RS, the cumulative effect was highly significant. Using the optimised sample handling and assay conditions, RS in CF bronchial brushing samples improved dramatically to 0.09% (p<0.05) and RS in CF nasal brushings improved from 0.9% to 0.08% (p<0.05). In parallel, our strategy of co-purification of DNA from the same cell lysates as for mRNA purification has allowed us to also determine plasmid DNA delivery in clinical samples without affecting mRNA assay RS. Together, these improvements in the processing of clinical samples and detection of vector RNA and DNA will permit the best opportunity to evaluate the delivery and expression of our gene therapy formulations in CF patients. Primary cell culture provides an accurate and robust experimental means to approximate human airway cellular physiology in vivo. We standardized and characterized primary cell cultures using murine nasal septal or human sinonasal epithelia grown at an air-liquid interface. Septal epithelia demonstrate excellent differentiation with cilia in approximately 90% of cultured cells, and ciliary beat frequencies stimulated by physiologic agonists, such as ATP and forskolin. Septal epithelial cultures also have substantially greater CFTR activity in Ussing chamber analysis than comparably processed tracheal monolayers, and allow direct comparisons of otherwise genetically identical (congenic) animals without the confounding effects attributable to mixed genetic backgrounds. Nasal primary cells can provide mechanistic comparisons with the nasal potential difference assay, a mainstay of CFTR detection in vivo. The culture model may thus be ideal for testing activity of CFTR correctors and potentiators, and determining whether such agents restore normal ion transport by potentiating the CFTR activation pathway.",

Quantitative PCR (reported as relative mRNA levels \u00b1 S.D.) showed dramatic differences in CFTR mRNA between homozygous (6.5 \u00b1 2.5), heterozygous (68.9 \u00b1 23.1), and wild type cultures (129.9 \u00b1 56.3, p < 0.0002).In addition, there was a 4.5-fold (homozygous) and 2.5-fold (heterozygous) decrease in CFTR mRNA compared to wild type in nasal tissues from mice.",

            "text": "Prior studies concerning Cftr tm1Kth transgenic mice have indicated tissue specific differences in CFTR expression, and in particular, lower levels of \u2206F508 CFTR mRNA in the upper intestine compared to wild type mice. Normal levels of CFTR mRNA were reported previously in \u2206F508 murine lung, testes, and submaxillary glands. In the present experiments, CFTR expression was reduced in \u2206F508 nasal epithelium, and markedly repressed in primary tissue culture. Whether these differences are mediated by higher expressivity in a pure epithelial cell population (compared to mixed cells from native tissues), decreased CFTR transcription, or message instability will require further investigation. However, our findings indicate significant limitations of airway cultures from Cftr tm1Kth mice, and those previous studies of \u2206F508 CFTR from the tm1 Kth background (generated by exon replacement) should be reevaluated in this light. For example, potentiator activation profiles observed in \u2206F508 CF mice may underestimate potency as a result of diminished levels of mRNA. Emerging transgenic \u2206F508 CF animal models (pig, ferret) should also be evaluated for decreased gene expression in both cell culture models and native tissues. Gene therapy is being evaluated for treatment of chronic cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. When plasmid DNA expressing CFTR is complexed with cationic liposomes or polymers, it can be delivered to the lungs of mice and sheep via aerosol, and CFTR mRNA can be detected in lung tissue. Recently, the CpG-free plasmid pGM169, which can result in persistent, inflammation-free, expression of human CFTR via the hCEFI promoter in the mouse lung (Hyde et al. Nat Biotechnol 2008; 26:549) was selected for clinical study. Currently, the UK Cystic Fibrosis Gene Therapy Consortium is conducting a Phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety of aerosol delivery of a pGM169/GL67A liposome formulation to the lungs of CF patients. Although the primary aim of the clinical study is to evaluate safety, we are also taking the opportunity to measure gene expression in nasal and bronchial brushings. To quantify transgene expression in clinical samples, traditional 2-step TaqMan RT-PCR is routinely used as a reliable and sensitive method. Using this type of assay we are capable of quantifying pGM169 mRNA and endogenous human CFTR mRNA down to 25 and 10 copies/\u00b5l of input RNA respectively, however below this threshold the samples are non-quantifiable and are reported as negative. To improve the opportunity to detect low levels of mRNA in clinical samples we developed a 3-step TaqMan RT-PCR assay, which includes an additional nested PCR step. This resulted in improved sensitivity by facilitating detection of low concentration pGM169 mRNA mimics that were previously undetectable by 2-step TaqMan RT-PCR. To model expression of pGM169 in the human lung, sheep lung tissue samples were collected following aerosol delivery (32mg pGM169). When vector-specific CFTR mRNA was assayed in the sheep samples, 25% of samples reported as negative by 2-step TaqMan PCR, had a strong (though non-quantifiable) vector signal when assayed by 3-step TaqMan PCR. Similarly, RNA from human Air Liquid Interface cells transfected with pGM169 resulted in detection of vector signal in 50% of previously \"negative\" samples. Thus application of the 3-step RT-PCR assay to RNA samples below the quantifiable threshold demonstrated that these tissue samples actually contained vector RNA signal. The ability to detect low levels of vector-specific mRNA in heterogeneous tissue samples indicates that this assay is ideal for measuring transgene expression in clinical samples, where availability may be limited. Efficient transduction of the airway epithelium and long-term expression of the transgene are essential elements for successful cystic fibrosis (CF) gene therapy. Parsons et al (2008) showed that action of the natural detergent lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC) to open tight junctions between cells allowed improved access to viral receptors on the basolateral surface of the airway epithelium in mice. We have previously shown that bronchoscope-guided, targeted lobar aerosolization of a mixture of LPC and Helper Dependent Adenovirus (HDAd) into nonhuman primate lungs results in uniform, high level pulmonary transduction. Our ultimate goal is to use LPC as the carrier in delivery of HDAd for gene therapy in CF patients. In this study we investigated the effects of LPC on lung mechanics of non-human primates.",

Bacterial biofilms contribute to the reduction in effectiveness of many antibiotics in chronic infections such as cystic fibrosis (CF) lung infections, chronic wound and sinus infections, endocarditis, and medical device infections. Panaecin\u2122 (gallium ) is a novel anti-infective with demonstrated efficacy against many gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria growing under planktonic or biofilm conditions, such as P. aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Furthermore, Panaecin is effective in the presence of CF sputum against tobramycin-and aztreonam-resistant P. aeruginosa that chronically colonize the lungs of CF patients, which makes it a promising drug candidate (1) . Panaecin\u2122 competes for iron in critical enzymatic pathways in bacteria such as DNA synthesis, metabolic conversion, electron transport and oxidative stress defense. We report the lung residence time of Panaecin \u2122 following an intratracheal instillation in rats which supports a once a day, or even less frequent, administration by inhalation. A gallium (III) formulation was prepared and instilled into the lungs or injected via IV in male Sprague-Dawley rats. At predetermined time points, blood samples were taken, the animals were euthanized, the lungs lavaged and excised. Gallium (III) was extracted from the lung tissue, bronchial-alveolar lung fluid (BAL), and serum, and subsequently quantified using flameless atomic absorption spectroscopy. An approximate 5-fold greater concentration was observed in lung tissue within 1 hour after intratracheal administration of 2 mg/kg of the inhalation formulation of gallium (III) compared to intravenous injection of the same dose. Approximately 50% and 95% was eliminated from lung compartments within 60 minutes following IT instillation or IV injection, respectively. The remainder of the dose was eliminated with a half-life of 24 hours. This compares well with the reported clinical findings following inhalation of a gallium-67 solution by healthy volunteers in which approximately two-thirds of the dose remained in the lung after 24 hr (2) . In comparison, the reported lung clearance half-life for tobramycin following IT instillation of 10 mg/kg to rats is 147 minutes (3).",

            "text": "References It has long been proposed that inhaled alginate lyase enzymes capable of degrading the exopolysaccharide alginate would render mucoid, cystic fibrosis (CF) associated P. aeruginosa infections more susceptible to the human immune response and antibiotics, resulting in an overall improvement in lung function. The therapeutic candidate Sphingomonas sp. A1-III alginate lyase (A1-III) has shown significant potential for bacterial alginate degradation, but unfortunately is predisposed towards excessive immunogenicity as a result of its bacterial origin. To address this problem, we have genetically engineered an A1-III enzyme containing a single cysteine substitution permitting controlled, orthogonal, maleimide-thiol conjugation to polyethylene glycol (PEG). This rational approach has produced a PEGylated A1-III enzyme with 48% decreased antigenicity, as assessed by enzymelinked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and a 44% decreased in vivo immunogenicity in a rabbit model. Furthermore, antibody binding studies with a na\u00efve repertoire of human single chain variable fragments displayed on yeast showed a 90% reduction in human scFv binding for the PEGylated variant compared to the native enzyme, suggesting that the de-immunization effect translates to the human immune system. In addition to reduced immunogenicity, the PEGylated A53C variant was found to possess catalytic activity equivalent to the native enzyme when assessed with a soluble brown seaweed alginate substrate. Importantly, PEGylated A53C was found to be 80% more active than the native enzyme when assayed with alginate purified from a mucoid P. aeruginosa clinical isolate, and in vitro studies demonstrated that 0.25 mg/ml doses of the PEGylated enzyme were able to reduce established mucoid P. aeruginosa biofilms by 30% relative to a notreatment control. Finally, we have observed that addition of a C-terminal his-tag to the enzyme results in a 300% increase in its maximum reaction velocity. It is a tantalizing possibility that his-tag mediated metal-ion interactions may improve the alginate degrading capacity of therapeutic candidates. As a whole, these results demonstrate that genetically and chemically modified A1-III alginate lyase exhibits therapeutically relevant, enhanced alginate degrading activity while simultaneously possessing decreased potential for eliciting an immune response in patients. A library of silver N-heterocyclic carbene complexes has been synthesized and the complexes are under investigation as potential antimicrobial agents for aerosol delivery. Although a silver carbene complex (SCC) designated SCC1, a methylated caffeine silver(I) acetate molecule, has demonstrated efficacy in treating respiratory infections in mouse models when dosed every 12 hours, there remains a need for packaging, protection and targeted delivery of Ag(I) in order to increase dosing intervals and hence, patient compliance. We sought to develop nanoparticles loaded with SCC1 in order to provide depot delivery of the drug, but for technical reasons, SCC1 could not be easily incorporated into nanoparticles. In this study, we developed shell crosslinked knedel-like (SCK) nanoparticles, loaded with Ag(I) both as 1-hexyl-3-methyl-4,5-dichloro-imidazole-2-ylidene silver (I) acetate (SCC10) and as free Ag(I), as an advanced antimicrobial device, designed to encapsulate and protect Ag(I) from salts and other biological agents, while retaining the potential for functionalization to achieve targeting and imaging capabilities. The SCKs were constructed by the supramolecular assembly of amphiphilic block copolymers, poly (acrylic acid)-bpolystyrene (PAA-b-PS), into micelles, followed by covalent crosslinking throughout the shell layer to afford discrete nanostructures having a hydrophobic core domain and a hydrophilic shell region. The silver-bearing nanoparticles were characterized and their antimicrobial activities against strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients were evaluated both in vitro and in a mouse model. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of SCC10 against P. aeruginosa ranged from 1-6 \u00b5g/mL. The activity of the silver-bearing SCK constructs against a representative strain of P. aeruginosa (strain PA M57-15; MIC [SCC10] = 1 \u00b5g/mL) was measured by monitoring optical density (650 nm) in a microplate spectrophotometer 6 h after treatment with constructs equalized for silver content as determined by ICP-MS. Independent of the silver loading method, decrements in the growth of P. aeruginosa PA M57-15 were observed at [Ag + ] of 2-4 \u00b5g/mL and growth was completely inhibited at [Ag + ] of 8 \u00b5g/mL. Intranasal inoculation of mice with P. aeruginosa (PA M57-15) followed by 2 nebulized doses of water, SCC10-Ag-SCK or SCC10-SCK constructs delivered at 1 and 25 hours after inoculation resulted in a 40 and 60% survival advantage, respectively, compared with water highlighting the importance of the sustained release of Ag(I) from the SCC10 loaded into the core domain versus the immediate release of shell-loaded Ag(I). These silver-loaded SCK nanoparticle delivery systems exhibited potent antimicrobial activities both in vitro and in vivo and may provide effective, sustained antimicrobial therapy for treatment of CF pulmonary infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is a frequent cause of respiratory infections in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Azithromycin, which has no activity against PA at achievable serum concentrations, is associated with improved outcomes in patients who have chronic PA lung infection, although the mechanism is unclear. Unlike antipseudomonal beta-lactams and aminoglycosides, which penetrate poorly into mammalian cells, azithromycin is concentrated to high levels within phagocytes and may potentially exceed the MICs of PA strains in this compartment. We therefore postulated that during infection azithromycin eradicates intracellular PA, augmenting the efficacy of conventional antipseudomonal antibiotics. Using an in vitro infection model, PA was incubated with J774 macrophage-like cells in the presence of amikacin with or without azithromycin. Recoverable internalized bacterial CFUs were enumerated after 24 hours of incubation by plating. In vivo experiments were performed using a well-characterized nasal aspiration mouse model of acute pneumonia. Mice were treated with amikacin with or without azithromycin. In separate experiments, pulmonary phagocytes were purified from infected mice by gradient centrifugation, and viable internalized bacteria enumerated from cell lysates. In addition, disease severity and survival were measured over 96 hours. In vitro assays confirmed that a small portion of the PA inoculum persisted within J774 macrophage-like cells. The addition of azithromycin to these assays resulted in a significant reduction (p<0.05) in the number of surviving intracellu-lar bacteria after 24 hours of infection compared to amikacin or piperacillin alone. In the mouse model of pneumonia, a significant improvement in clinical well-being and survival was observed in mice treated with amikacin plus azithromycin relative to amikacin alone (p<0.01), untreated controls (p<0.001) and azithromycin alone (p<0.001). Significantly fewer viable bacteria were recovered from pulmonary phagocytes of mice treated with azithromycin plus amikacin compared to amikacin alone (p<0.03). The improvement in survival with addition of azithromycin was not observed when an isogenic PA strain that remained largely extracellular was used for infection. Thus both in vitro and in vivo models demonstrated decreased severity of infection with the addition of azithromycin to standard PA therapy, and in both cases improved outcomes were associated with decreased numbers of viable bacteria within phagocytes. These results suggest that eradication of intracellular bacteria may be another mechanism by which azithromycin contributes to improved outcomes in CF patients with PA airway infections.",

Several other paralogous cytochrome encoding genes underwent strong expression changes in response to the alteration in oxygen concentration.

The microarray reference data set has enabled the identification of the most important B. cenocepacia genes regulated in response to the environmental parameters which alter during infection. The large dataset can be used to inspire future investigative approaches aimed at preventing and treating Bcc infection in CF. This research was supported by grant MAHENT06V0 from Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Inc. Quorum sensing (QS) is a bacterial signalling mechanism that allows communication between bacteria and the coordination of group behaviour. In gram-negative bacteria, the QS signals are acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) that bind to transcriptional regulators and modulate gene expression when present in sufficient quantities. QS systems in the cystic fibrosis (CF) pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc), regulate expression of many virulence factor genes thought to contribute to acute and chronic infections. Despite convincing evidence for a role for QS in virulence, there have been several reports of lasR QS mutants of P. aeruginosa being recovered from airways of chronically infected CF patients. P. aeruginosa lasR mutants have been demonstrated to have a growth advantage over wild type strains in some conditions suggesting that QS regulated virulence factors may be more important in acute than chronic infections. The objectives of this study were to determine if similar adaptations in the CepRI QS system occurred over time in Bcc chronic infections. Genetically-related sequential isolates from 12 patients chronically infected with B. cenocepacia and 10 patients infected with B. multivorans were analyzed for AHL production. The mean collection time between the paired sequential isolates was 6.2 years for the B. cenocepacia strains and 5.7 years for the B. multivorans strains. All isolates with the exception of one B. cenocepacia strain produced AHLs suggesting that the cepRI genes were functional. The one AHL negative isolate was found to contain an insertion sequence in the cepR gene. Nine of the remaining 11 B. cenocepacia paired isolates had the same or higher AHL production in the later isolate than the original isolates. All but one of the B. multivorans later isolates produced more AHL than the original isolate from the same patient. Competitive growth assays were performed with the B. cenocepacia wild type (WT) and cepR mutant clinical isolates in an agar bead model of chronic respiratory infection and in various culture media. The growth competitiveness between the WT and cepR mutant isolate varied depending on the culture medium; however, 99% of the colonies recovered from lungs 10 days post infection in the animal model were WT, whereas the initial inoculum contained 52.5% WT. These data suggest that there is a selective advantage for AHL production and QS mediated gene regulation in Bcc Pseudomonas aeruginosa chronically colonizes the lungs of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Evidence suggests that this infection process involves the transition of P. aeruginosa from an acute, virulent phenotype to a more chronic lifestyle typified by the formation of biofilms within the airways. We have previously developed a tissue culture model system for the development of P. aeruginosa biofilms directly on cultured human CFderived airway epithelial cells. Using this model, we found that the magnesium transporter MgtE influences the cytotoxicity of the bacteria toward the epithelial cells. Mutation of the mgtE gene led to increased cytotoxicity, and overexpression of this gene resulted in decreased toxicity. Using in vitro assays, we discovered that the mgtE mutant strain secreted a greater amount of toxins through the type III secretion system (T3SS). Mutational analysis and transcriptional studies of T3SS structural, effector, and regulatory genes suggested that the MgtE protein interacts with the regulatory network that governs T3SS gene transcription, likely by controlling the activity of the master regulatory protein ExsA. Intriguingly, although MgtE can transport magnesium, the effects of MgtE on cytotoxicity appeared to be magnesium-independent. These studies demonstrate that by varying the levels of MgtE in the bacterial membrane, P. aeruginosa can modulate its toxicity towards epithelial cells. This control of cytotoxicity may influence the acute to chronic lifestyle transition enacted by P. aeruginosa during infection of the CF lung. Thus, these studies suggest that future therapies might target MgtE in order to disrupt P. aeruginosa biofilms and influence bacterial toxicity. Here we performed an unbiased signature tagged mutagenesis (STM) study and for the first time we exploited a positive selection screening in a mouse model of chronic infection. As read-outs of virulence in the agar beads lung infection model, we tested P. aeruginosa persistence versus clearance to select for mutants with increased virulence. Ninety-six pools of 72 mutants each carrying a different signature tag were exposed to murine airways and viable P. aeruginosa were recovered after 14 days. After three rounds of screenings with mixed mutants, followed by a round of screening with single mutants, 16 STM mutants were selected as able to establish chronic infection in higher percentage of mice when compared to PAO1293 strain (STM mutants vs PAO1293: 80-100% vs 12.5%; Chi square analysis: PAO1293 vs STM mutants p<0.05).",

In the lung, P. aeruginosa produces a number of virulence factors including hemolytic phospholipase C (PlcH), which breaks down phosphatidylcholine (PC), a major component of lung surfactant. In addition to the direct toxic effects of PlcH on the host, we have shown that PC degradation also enhances P. aeruginosa biofilm formation, which may contribute to decreased host clearance and increased antibiotic resistance. Gene expression analysis of P. aeruginosa grown in the presence of PC-rich bovine lung surfactant has allowed us to identify transcripts indicative of PlcH production and PC degradation. Bacterial RNA isolated from the sputum of CF patients was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. These studies provided evidence that PC-degradation likely occurs in the lung during chronic infections, and preliminary data show that plcH mRNA levels may correlate with decreased forced expiratory volume (FEV 1 ). We have discovered that miltefosine, a commercially available alkylphosphocholine currently in therapeutic use, decreases PlcH activity towards its substrates, and we have found that addition of 50\u00b5M miltefosine to P. aeruginosa in vitro cultures decreased biofilm size. We will present data on miltefosine-mediated inhibition of P. aeruginosa PC degradation in liquid and biofilm cultures, and studies on PC-catabolite stimulation of P. aeruginosa biofilm formation.

The relationship between Aspergillus fumigatus and remaining clear of mucoid P.aer warrants further study. Dynamic microbial communities typify the airways of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Culture-independent approaches have been used to characterize the microbial constituents of such communities because it is thought that a more inclusive perspective of the lower airway microbiology is afforded by obviating the requirement for laboratory cultivation. A large proportion of the organisms reported in these studies are represented by bacterial species not identified by using the standard protocol for CF sputum microbiology, which has led to the notion that much of the microbiota present in CF airways is uncultivable. To better define the composition of the cultured airway microbiome of CF patients we used a more complete cultivation practice, which included several non-standard mediums as well as anaerobic growth conditions. We generated a strain collection of greater than 2000 isolates, recovered from hundreds of sputum specimens. Bacterial species identification was done by 16S rRNA sequence and revealed the presence of greater than 130 bacterial species from 40 different genera, many of which have only been detected by using culture-independent means. Additionally, several bacterial species were recovered that have not previously been described. In an attempt to evaluate the efficacy of the cultivation procedure we used to characterize the airway microbiome, a novel method was developed to discern the microbial community profiles recovered on twelve different culture mediums cultivated under two growth conditions (5% carbon dioxide and anaerobic). The culture-enrichment Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism technique indicated that even our extensive collection of organisms underestimates the true magnitude of the cultured airway microbiome. The fusion of a culture-dependent and culture-independent approach allowed for a more comprehensive perspective of the lower airway microbiology by significantly increasing the sensitivity of either technique alone. We show that although each patient has a unique consortium of organisms, it is possible to culture the vast majority of organisms from CF sputum.",

Fewer bacterial species were present in older patients, those on antibiotics, and in those with PA. The bacterial communities of different patients with PA had a smaller proportion of taxa in common than did those of patients without PA. Correspondence analysis showed that the PA-containing communities did not cluster with those of PA negative communities nor with each other (Fig.1 ).

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods applied to nasal and/or throat swabs can be used for the rapid detection of common respiratory viruses. The majority of adults with CF produce sputum during infective exacerbations. We investigated whether sputum from CF patients is a suitable medium for the diagnosis of respiratory viral infections in patients with CF by a PCR method, by comparing results of PCR tests from paired sputum and nasal swab samples collected from patients with symptoms of a viral respiratory illness.",

In our clinical practice, the specificity of PCR is greater using sputum samples than nasal swab samples. In vitro experiments demonstrate that genomic mutations can lead to increased persister formation. We hypothesized that persisters enable establishment of chronic infections despite aggressive antibiotic therapy and that periodic treatment of a patient over time will select for mutations leading to increased persister formation. To test these hypotheses we obtained longitudinal clonal clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa from chronically infected cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Thirty-five of these isolates obtained from a single patient with CF were evaluated for antibiotic tolerance during log phase growth, stationary phase, and biofilm growth. During stationary phase, between 1x10 -5 and 1x10 -4 percent of the population of the early isolate are drug-tolerant persisters, while between 0.01 and 0.1% of the population of the last isolate are persisters. Thus the last isolate exhibits a 100-1000 fold increase in persister cell formation at stationary phase compared to the early parent strain. During exponential phase, between 0.1 and 0.5% of the early isolate population formed persisters while between 5-10% of the last isolate population tolerated this antibiotic, indicating at least a 10-fold increase in persister formation in the last isolate. In biofilms, the last isolate formed between 0.02-0.05% persisters while the parent strain formed no persisters at any of the antibiotic concentrations tested. This is a surprising result given that the last isolate is partially defective for in vitro biofilm formation. The early isolate forms bioflms with approximately 1x10 7 CFU/peg while the last isolate forms biofilms of approximately 1x10 5 CFU/peg. For all antibiotics tested the last isolate exhibited higher resistance. To distinguish resistance from the persister phenotype we knocked out the MexXY pump from the last isolate, which was upregulated due to a mutation in mexZ not present in the parent strain. This resulted in parental MIC levels in the last isolate without affecting persister levels. In addition to the isolates from this patient, clonal pairs from 13 other patients were assessed for their ability to form persisters at stationary phase. The last isolate from 10 of these 13 pairs formed at least 10-fold more persisters at stationary phase compared to the paired early isolate. Moreover, in 5 of these 10 pairs, there was no significant increase in antibiotic resistance between the early and the late isolate indicating that increased survival was due to increased persister cell formation and not classical antibiotic resistance. Together, these results suggest that increased persister formation by P. aeruginosa is an important adaptation in chronic infection of the CF airway.

Nine of 11 UNC isolates and the remaining BPCF isolate, also formed a cluster of >70% similarity to each other, with spa types and PFGE patterns related to the New York/Japan MRSA clone and were agr type II. The remaining 2 UNC isolates were PVL positive, resembling the USA-300 MRSA clone. Multiple MRSA isolates from one sputum or BALF sample shared the same PFGE pattern, suggesting that patients were colonized with one MRSA strain. BPCF isolates included isolates from 2 sibling pairs; one pair was identical, with exact banding pattern matches, while the other pair had a one-band difference. Furthermore, duplicate isolates from one patient, obtained 18 months apart, were similar, but not identical (a 2-band difference). Irrespective of agr type and source, all isolates formed weak biofilms with no difference observed in biofilm formation under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Conclusion: UNC and BPCF MRSA isolates differed from each other and likely reflected the predominant MRSA strain types circulating in their respective countries. Molecular epidemiological studies to investigate the potential impact of the differing MRSA strains on clinical outcome within the CF population warrant further investigation. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative opportunistic pathogen that causes chronic infection in the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. P. aeruginosa has been shown to secrete a soluble protein, termed CFTR inhibitory factor (Cif), which affects the trafficking of select ABC transporters; including CFTR and P-gp. The result is a rapid mislocalization of the transporter to endosomes, followed by degradation. Cif's effect on CFTR causes inhibition of chloride currents across the membranes of treated cells. Since the majority of CF patients are colonized by P. aeruginosa, Cif represents a potential roadblock to the effectiveness of CFTR targeted therapies in a clinical setting. Cif is a member of the \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase superfamily of proteins, and is an epoxide hydrolase (EH). Mammalian EHs can function as regulators of blood pressure and inflammation, while bacterial EHs have mostly been characterized for their ability to detoxify environmental and industrial compounds. This is the first example of an EH functioning as a virulence factor.",

            "text": "We have determined the X-ray crystal structure of Cif to 1.8 \u00c5. The enzymatic mechanism utilizes a catalytic triad of residues Asp129, Glu153, and His297. His269, previously implicated as an active site residue, is located at the mouth of the putative substrate access tunnel to the active site. This mutation does not impair enzymatic function with low molecular weight substrates in vitro, but does abrogate all measureable effect in vivo with airway epithelial cells, classifying it as a potential K m mutant. The structure provides a basis for investigating the role of the active site in Cif activity. The intracellular signaling molecule, cyclic-di-GMP, has been shown to influence bacterial behaviors, including motility and biofilm formation. Given that Pseudomonas aeruginosa is able to chronically colonize the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients leading to an increase in morbidity and mortality, we would like to better understand the mechanisms by which the c-di-GMP signaling pathway impacts surface behaviors of this bacterium. Recently, we reported the characterization of the bifA gene, a regulator of surface-associated behaviors in P. aeruginosa. The bifA gene encodes a c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase and the \u2206bifA mutant exhibits increased cellular pools of c-di-GMP, forms hyper-biofilms and is unable to swarm. The hyper-biofilm phenotype results from an increased synthesis of a polysaccharide produced by the pel locus. However, this increased polysaccharide production in the \u2206bifA mutant has only a subtle inhibitory effect on swarming motility. In this study, we sought to understand why the \u2206bifA mutant is unable to swarm and to elucidate the potential mechanism(s) by which c-di-GMP impacts swarming motility.",

Since PA escapes the systemic immune system because of adhesion to IgA in the mucus, the systemic IgG response is not activated and the biofilm growing PA persists. As a consequence PA adapts silently to the airways subsequently leading to colonisation and infection of the lungs with adapted bacteria, which are difficult to eradicate since they grow slowly, and are resistant to antibiotics. Chronic airway infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is a specific hallmark of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Airway secretions are routinely cultured for bacteria, but this approach is of limited sensitivity in younger, non sputum-producing patients. Therefore, non-invasive real-time tests would offer significant advantages in the surveillance, detection and subsequent early treatment of PA infection.",

PGP shares structural features with CXCR ligands (eg. IL-8) and independently drives pulmonary neutrophil influx. PGP and its acetylated form (Ac-PGP) are found in high levels in CF sputum vs. healthy and disease controls, and inhibition of MMP-9 blocks >80% of PGP generation. CF patients have high sputum levels of MMP-9 that lacks negative regulation, with activity exceeding that of children intubated with respiratory failure and Acute Lung Injury (ALI). When examining MMP-9 activity in intubated-mechanically ventilated children, we found that the highest levels were seen in patients with RSV-induced disease (12-fold increase, p<0.002, n=23 for children with RSV, and n=21 for children without RSV). These results suggest that RSV is a specific stimulus for MMP-9 expression. It has been postulated that viral infections are an important early life stimulus to initiate the progressive cascade of lung inflammation and damage seen in CF. Based on these observations, we tested the hypothesis that RSV infection induces MMP-9 expression and release from human airway cell monolayers. 16HBE cells and wtCFTR+ CFBE41o-cells were grown as polarized monolayers on permeable supports and infected with RSV at an MOI of 10. Cell lysates and media were assayed for MMP-9 expression and release from day 01 through day 12 post-infection. Our results indicate that RSV A2 induces MMP-9 expression in both cell types, with increased transcript levels in 16HBE cells of 5, 25, and 150-fold over non-infected controls at days 03, 06, and 09 (p<0.02 at all time points). Complementary Western blots and activity assays performed on cell media indicated that MMP-9 zymogen increased in a qualitatively similar fashion over the course of RSV infection, with delayed and modest induction of TIMP-1 expression at later time points (maximum of 4-fold over uninfected controls at day 09 post-infection). Comparisons of apical and basolateral MMP-9 release indicated that MMP-9 was released into both compartments, with apical > basolateral release at all time points tested. Control experiments with heat-killed RSV and non-replicating adenovirus exposure confirmed that induced MMP-9 expression was specific for live RSV virus. The results support the hypothesis that RSV infection is sufficient to induce MMP-9 expression in human airway cells. The release of MMP-9 to the apical compartment suggests that the high levels detected in airway secretions relative to non-RSV diseases represent MMP-9 derived from neutrophils and the epithelium. The detection of basolateral release suggests that epithelial-derived MMP-9 has access to extracellular matrix proteins and may contribute to the generation of PGP and damage to airway structural proteins.",

            "text": "Conclusion: Both regimens tested have a high and comparable immediate Pa eradication rate. Only half of the patients remain free of Pa during 6 months without additional antibiotic treatment. Pseudomonas aeruginosa hemolytic phospholipase C (PlcH) is an extracellular virulence factor that cleaves the phosphorylcholine head group from phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, both present in pulmonary surfactant and lung cell plasma membranes. In vitro and in vivo experiments have demonstrated PlcH alteration of lung surfactant, immune cell function, and inflammatory processes. In cystic fibrosis (CF)-related P. aeruginosa infections, early and robust antibody production to PlcH indicates that this secreted virulence factor is produced in the CF lung. We previously identified the P. aeruginosa transcription factor GbdR as the primary regulator of plcH transcription in the mouse lung. Transcriptional induction by GbdR is dependent on glycine betaine (GB) concentration within the bacterial cell. The enzymes required for GB catabolism to dimethylglycine in P. aeruginosa are GbcA and GbcB. To test the hypothesis that plcH transcription and resulting phospholipase activity could be reduced by perturbing intracellular levels of GB, we generated gbcAB deletion strains and inducible gbcAB expression strains. Here we show that changes in the rate of GbcAB-dependent catabolism of GB alter both plcH transcription and resulting PlcH-dependent virulence as measured by transcriptional fusions, enzymatic assay, epithelial cell biofilm formation, and mouse lung infection data. Our data also support the hypothesis that the native mechanism controlling the size of the cytoplasmic GB pool in P. aeruginosa is based on regulation of gbcB translation. By understanding the connection between catabolism of host-acquired molecules and the regulation of virulence factors we gain insight that will be valuable in developing novel therapeutic agents that target microbial catabolic pathways in order to reduce bacterial virulence and improve patient lung function. P. aeruginosa-induced activation of NF-\u03baB and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by airway epithelia requires that the bacteria express flagellin. We tested whether P. aeruginosa and human airway epithelia secreted factors that modulated this response. Experiments were performed on both the Calu-3 cell line and primary cultures of tracheal epithelia. P. aeruginosa strain PAKfliC (flagellin knock-out) did not activate NF-\u03baB or IL8, but inhibited flagellin-activated NF-\u03baB by 40-50% and IL8 secretion by 20-25%. PAKfliC also inhibited NF-\u03baB induced by IL1\u03b2 and toll-like receptor 2 agonist Pam3CSK4. Similar inhibitions were observed with strains PAK, PAO1 and PA14. The inhibitory factor was present in conditioned medium isolated from PAKfliC or Calu-3+PAKfliC, but it was not present in conditioned medium isolated from Calu-3 cells alone or from PAKfliC that had been heat-treated. Inhibition by PAKfliC-conditioned medium was exerted from either apical or basolateral side of the epithelium; was enhanced in simple Ringer's solution compared to in tissue culture media; and did not result from altered pH or depletion of glucose. The inhibitory effect of conditioned medium was abolished by boiling and appeared from filtration studies to result from effects of a factor with molecular weight <3 kDa. These and further studies with isogenic mutants lead to the conclusion that the NF-\u03baB and IL8 response of airway epithelia to P. aeruginosa results from a balance of proinflammatory effects of flagellin and anti-inflammatory effects of a small (<3kDa), heat-sensitive factor(s) that is not LPS, C12 homoserine lactone, alginate, CIF or exotoxins A, S, T, U, or Y. P. aeruginosa infections of lung airways are characteristic of cystic fibrosis (CF). Flagellin and quorum-sensing homoserine lactones (N-(3oxo-dodecanoyl)-S-homoserine lactone, 3O-C12, and N-butyryl homoserine lactone, C4) are released from P. aeruginosa into the airway surface liquid of infected individuals. We tested flagellin (10 -6 g/ml) and 3O-C12 and C4 (1 to 100 \u00b5M) on Clsecretion and Ca 2+ and cyclic-AMP responses of Calu-3 cells, a human, non-CF, serous-like line. Flagellin and 3O-C12 (but not C4) stimulated slow increases in Clsecretion (I Cl , Ussing chamber transepithelial electrophysiology) that began within 1-5 mins and continued to increase to 30-150 \u00b5A/cm 2 over 45 mins. Flagellin and 3O-C12 activations of I Cl were: largely blocked by CFTR inhibitor CFTRinh172, somewhat larger for 3O-C12 than for flagellin and smaller than those elicited by forskolin. Stimulatory effects of flagellin on I Cl were abolished by prior stimulation with 3O-C12, indicating common mechanisms of action. 3O-C12, but not C4 or flagellin, increased cytosolic [Ca 2+ ] (Ca i , fura-2 fluorescence imaging in single cells), and there was similar concentration dependence for effects on Ca i and I Cl . Thapsigargin, an inhibitor of CaATPase that releases Ca 2+ stored in the endoplasmic reticulum, increased both Ca i and I Cl . Subsequent stimulation with 3O-C12 elicited no further stimulation of Ca i but small, further increase in I Cl . 3O-C12 also increased Ca i and I Cl , and prior treatment of cells with 3O-C12 prevented further stimulatory effects of thapsigargin on I Cl and Ca i . 3O-C12 and flagellin also increased cytosolic [cAMP] as measured by a sensitive FRET-based cAMP sensor in single cells; stimulatory effects of flagellin were smaller than those of 3O-C12, consistent with effects of flagellin and 3O-C12 on I Cl . I Cl stimulated by 3O-C12 or forskolin was inhibited by about 50% by prior treatment with the cAMP antagonist RpBrcAMPS and increased by >50% by treatment with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (100 \u00b5M). These results indicate that, in addition to having proinflammatory effects to activate NF\u2212\u03baB signaling and IL8 secretion in airway epithelia, flagellin and 3O-C12 both stimulate Clsecretion that is CFTR-dependent and is mediated at least partly through agonist-triggered increases in cytosolic [cAMP]. 3O-C12, but not flagellin, may also stimulate Clsecretion through its effects to raise Ca i . In CF, flagellin and 3O-C12-triggered signaling and cytokine responses will be retained but activation of CFTR-dependent Cland fluid secretion will be prevented. Support: CFF and CFRI. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has enormous clinical relevance to patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), many of whose lungs are colonized by this bacterium in the first few years of life. The strains involved are generally consid-ered environmental, and yet to date the environmental niches that are most important in lung colonization remain unknown. There are two possible benefits to identifying these niches. First, if P. aeruginosa or the genotypes most likely to colonize the lung occur in a limited set of habitats, infection risk could be reduced and colonization delayed by simple interventions (cleaning, avoiding specific exposures). Second, identification of infecting niches may reveal characteristics of good colonizers that could be targeted with new therapeutics for early infections.",

Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH, USA Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is abundant in the lung environment as a major phospholipid component of surfactant fluid and cell membranes. Pseudomonas aeruginosa utilizes two enzymes: phospholipase C (PlcH) and phosphorylcholine phosphatase (PchP), which help break down PC to yield diacylglycerol and choline. Work from our lab and others has shown that the liberated choline promotes P. aeruginosa virulence and survival in a variety of ways. Despite the multifaceted roles of choline, the mechanisms for its uptake by P. aeruginosa in the lung are not yet understood. Using whole genome analysis and homology based searches in combination with mutant analyses, we identified one predicted ABC transporter, Bcc, and one putative choline symporter, BetT1, that together appear to mediate uptake of choline under physiological conditions. Additionally, our findings suggest that the transcriptional regulation of these genes is different. On availability of the choline catabolite, a regulator GbdR highly induces the expression of bcc genes. In contrast, the expression of betT1 gene does not depend on GbdR. Current work is focusing on the role of these transporters in uptake of choline for the purpose of surface modification and the regulation of choline induced virulence genes in vivo. We are testing the latter by analyzing the expression the of plcH, pchP, betA and betB genes (genes highly expressed by P. aeruginosa in the CF lung) as molecular markers of choline uptake in lung surfactant fluid and mouse model of infection. A thorough understanding of the choline transporters will facilitate design of novel anti-Pseudomonas therapies targeted at decreasing virulence in the cystic fibrosis lung. In 1995 over 75% of the children attending the Liverpool Regional CF Centre had Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) isolated from their respiratory culture. In the majority of these children (n, 55), this was identified as a genetically identical clone, assumed to be a transmissible strain (supported by the subsequent recognition of the Liverpool Epidemic Strain (LES) in numerous CF centres in the UK and beyond). Initially LES was considered inherently resistant to ceftazidime (a feature that prompted the initial investigation and genotyping), however sensitive isolates have subsequently been recognized.

This policy has been aided by the use of a rapid PCR assay. The previous segregation policy (based on ceftazidime resistance) is not completely reliable. Although most LES are ceftazidime resistant, this should not be considered an inherent property of the strain. A low threshold of suspicion with respect to the LES should be exercised when considering your clinic population. Factors that should prompt further investigation include a high prevalence of PA infection and unusual patterns of resistance. Background: Literature is emerging describing zoonotic transmission of bacteria and viruses to humans. Bordetella bronchiseptica (BBS) is a common cause of \"kennel cough\" in dogs. Despite a large proportion of people keeping dogs as pets BBS does not appear to be responsible for significant respiratory morbidity except in compromised health conditions.

Symptoms varied from asymptomatic to an acute respiratory exacerbation requiring admission for intravenous antibiotic therapy. A year following infection lung function was reduced in both patients 2 and 3. This improved in patient 2 who remains colonized with BBS 4 years after isolation (2009 Lung function: FVC 115%, FEV 1 105%).

Summary: We have isolated Bordetella bronchiseptica in a total of three patients in our clinic. The infection is highly likely to have occurred from contact with dogs infected with BBS. Clinical features may vary but infection resulted in one patient chronically colonized with Bordetella bronchiseptica. The impact on lung health remains to be determined.

The apparent lower prevalence may, at least in part, be due to a low frequency of testing for NTM. About half of those culturing NTM had been started on treatment, though the threshold for commencing treatment varied across centres. The diagnosis of NTM infection has a significant impact for CF patients, both in the requirement for long-term therapies and potential refusal for transplant.

The other three patients were heterozygotes (\u2206F508/I148T, \u2206F508/621+1G\u00c7T and 621+1G\u00c7T/G542X).

The year preceding the acquisition of RM, the median time spent in hospital was 43 days (range 22-159). Prior to the acquisition of RM, one patient was colonized with Ralstonia Picketti (formerly called Burkholderia picketti), two with multiresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one with BC and three with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. After reviewing the social contacts and the clinic visits of these patients, we do not believe that there was any person-to-person transmission of RM. Within two months of the first positive culture for RM, four patients presented episodes of fever up to 39\u221eC. Three patients developed marked leucocytosis (white cell count \u2265 40x10 9 /L). For three patients, RM was identified in other specimens than sputum (bacteremia (1), sinus (1) and mediastinal lymph node biopsy (1)). Because it was a multiresistant bacteria, prolonged course of combination intravenous antibiotic therapy was necessary to control the infection in most patients. Despite treatment, three patients died. Two of them died within 3 months of the acquisition of RM. Both presented with acute pulmonary exacerbation that rapidly evolved to hypoxemic respiratory failure for one patient and sepsis complicated by multiple organ failure (renal and lung) for the other. The third patient died of progressive hypercapnic respiratory failure. Eradication of RM occurred only for one of the three remaining patients, after one month of antibiotic therapy.",

Antibiotic efflux pumps are a known mechanism by which PA acquires antibiotic resistance and has been suggested to play a major role in PA infections in patients with CF. Resistance to aminoglycosides (AG) has specifically been associated with increased expression of the mexXY-OprM efflux pump in both CF and non-CF isolates. However, little is known about the time course and factors that facilitate increased mexXY expression and whether it is associated with deterioration in lung function.

MRSA was first recognized as being acquired from hospitalized patients (HA-MRSA), but the onset of MRSA infection outside the hospital, in community-associated settings (CA-MRSA), has been described with increasing frequency. CA-MRSA strains are replacing HA-MRSA strains causing severe infections. A proper evaluation of CA-MRSA prevalence should rely on SCCmec molecular characterization. However, data are limited regarding the genetic background of these pathogens in the CF population. This Italian study investigated the epidemiology, SCCmec type and clinical impact of MRSA strains isolated from nine Italian CF centers. MRSA strains (n=178) were collected from 178 out of 2362 (7.5%) patients. A high prevalence (36%) of CA-MRSA (SCCmec IV) strains was found. The mean patient age at time of the first infection was 11.8 years and 19.2 years in those with CA-MRSA (n=28) and in those with HA-MRSA (n=37) respectively. This difference was statistically significant (p<0.05), suggesting that CA-MRSA strains lead to an earlier onset of the first pulmonary infection compared with HA-MRSA. Decline of pulmonary function was evaluated one year before and one year after MRSA infection. Preliminary data, available on two small groups of patients (6 patients infected exclusively by CA-MRSA and 14 patients infected exclusively by HA-MRSA), showed that FEV 1 decline in CA-MRSA infected patients is more consistent than in HA-MRSA infected patients (-3.67 and +1.07 respectively). Although the observation period is limited and the number of patients studied does not permit statistical analysis, this preliminary observation suggests that more study is needed to evaluate the pathogenic roles of CA-and HA-MRSA.

It can cause allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), aspergilloma and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. While antifungal agents in vitro are active against A. fumigatus, in vivo antifungal therapy is often complicated and resistance is observable. The virulence of A. fumigatus is exhibited by production of fungal proteins promoting mycelia growth into the lung parenchyma or by structural features of the conidia that confer resistance to the host antifungal properties. A. fumigatus can grow in multicellular communities on plastic surfaces and on human bronchial epithelia cells (16HBE) and human bronchial epithelia cells with F508del/F508del (CFBE41o-). The proteome and transcriptome of planktonic and biofilmlike grown A. fumigatus mycelium was studied for identification of induced proteins.",

The expression of several proteins changed significantly in biofilm-like grown mycelium. Time-dependent, decreased expression of enzymes of the citric acid cycle and proteins involved in ATP synthesis in the biofilm culture was observed, whereas the glycolytic enzyme enolase and an aldehyde dehydrogenase were upregulated. This points to a developmental stage of the biofilm at 24h demanding energy. At a matured biofilm phase, metabolic activity seems to be reduced. The most striking result was the significant upregulation of proteins involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. In particular, proteins of the gliotoxin secondary metabolite cluster were induced in biofilm-like grown cultures and a gliotoxin peak was observed after 48h by HPLC analysis.",

SCCmec type I, II and III are responsible for hospital-associated infections, types IV and V are typically defined as CA-MRSA isolates. CA-MRSA are often characterized by a good susceptibility pattern to non beta-lactam antibiotics, and the ability to produce specific toxins. Recently, CA-MRSA are increasingly isolated from hospital settings, causing severe infections and outbreaks.

            "text": "The morbidity and mortality arising from respiratory failure due to bacterial infections of the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung is still high. As such, it is important first to better understand these infections and, critically, be able to treat them more effectively. In order to achieve more effective treatment, the manner by which antibiotic susceptibility data are gathered must be considered. Currently, antibiotic assessment is carried out using cells not grown in a biofilm mode of growth -this runs counter to the way in which bacteria typically grow in the CF lung. More than this though, currently, antibiotic susceptibilities are assessed for single species -here, this differs from the complex communities of bacteria that are now known to be present in the CF lung. This study proposes a new model system to assess in vitro efficacy of antibiotic therapy. This model system forms bacterial biofilms in vitro directly from the species present in clinical samples. The degree to which the biofilms that formed resembled the species composition of the original sample could then be assessed. To do this, culture-independent Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiling analysis of 16S rRNA gene PCR products amplified from directly extracted nucleic acids was used. In this way, T-RFLP analysis resolved which bacterial species were present in the original sample as compared to the in vitro formed biofilms. A total of thirty one CF sputum samples, each from a different patient, were studied in this way. The sputa on average contained 4.6\u00b12.3 dominant bacterial species, with the number of species detected decreasing to 4.0\u00b11.6 after five days of bacterial biofilm growth in vitro. Overall similarity of bacterial biofilm communities therefore did not differ significantly over time, with the bacterial content of sputa well reproduced in the biofilm models. Additional measures of biofilm mass and microscopic analysis were also made. Having established model systems in vitro, these were used to study the impact of antibiotics. The central hypothesis here was that through forming models in vitro directly from the multiple bacterial species that these would serve in turn as improved assays of antibiotic susceptibility than conventionally-grown cells. The mean biofilm MICs were 149.8 \u00b5g/ml and 53.8 \u00b5g/ml for colistin and tobramycin respectively, compared to the MIC values for non-biofilm grown CF sputum samples (76.7 \u00b5g/ml and 33.9 \u00b5g/ml). This showed that biofilm bacterial communities were significantly more resistant to antibiotic challenge than non-biofilm grown bacteria from the same CF sputum sample. Extensions to this model system also will allow the response of pathogens to antibiotic challenge within this system to be assessed. The potential impact of this strategy in relation to ameliorating existing therapies and for screening for novel treatments is also discussed. cenocepacia strains were tested in competition experiments and directly compared with results obtained from single infections. Paired strains of P. aeruginosa and B. cenocepacia of clinical and environmental origin (RP73/LMG16656, E5/Mex1) were included in the agar beads and challenged in murine lung through intratracheal surgery. After 14 days postinfection, only P. aeruginosa was isolated from lungs of the mice infected with a polymicrobial inoculum (RP73/LMG16656, cfu: 1.8\u00d710 4 /0; Chisquare: p=0.0001; E5/Mex1, 5.4\u00d710 3 /0; p=0.0003). Cytokines (IL-6, MIP2, JE, KC, IL-1\u03b2) tested in the murine lung homogenates showed high levels for JE, KC and IL-1\u03b2 while low levels for IL-6 and MIP2.

In this method, primers were designed against the RecA gene that were suitable for Real Time PCR (product size 125bp). GAPDH was used as a reference gene against the human cells. The difficulty in this system was distinguishing between bacterial DNA and abundant human DNA which is an issue in many microbiological samples. The method was therefore optimized to exclude non-specific amplification from human DNA. The method was thoroughly validated and shown to correlate well with traditional microbiological techniques and predicted values.

Microbial pathogens cause damage by the production of proteases and toxins harmful to lung tissues and by interaction with elements of the innate immune response. Early Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection is typified by the production of quorum sensing (QS)-regulated factors involved in virulence and biofilm maturation which are essential for or augment pathogenicity. Cells cultured from patient's sputum during the early, acute phase exhibit a wild-type QS-active phenotype. If infection is not eliminated, selective pressures in the lung lead to the cumulative acquisition of selectively advantageous mutations. The loss of aggressive virulence factors during progression from acute to chronic phase is well documented (Smith et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2006 30; 103(22) :8487-92) and is frequently attributable to disruption of the QS communication systems (D'Argenio et al. Mol Microbiol. 2007 64(2) :512-33).

            "text": "Together the data suggest that adaptation of P. aeruginosa during chronic infection of the CF lung focuses on evasion of the host innate immune response and may include an increasing ability to survive intracellularly as has been reported for Burkholderia. The prospect of intracellular survival of P. aeruginosa has important implications for treatment of persistent infections. Biofilms provide a reservoir of potentially infectious microorganisms, that are resistant to antimicrobial agents. Their importance in chronic inflammatory conditions, such as cystic fibrosis (CF) is increasingly recognised. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) is a technique that can be used to visualize the 3-dimensional structure of biofilms and to identify specific bacterial populations within the biofilm itself, including those encountered in the cystic fibrosis lung. In this study, FISH utilising Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA) probes, was used in combination with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to detect and characterise the spatial distribution of biofilm-forming bacteria which predominate within human chronic infections. In vitro biofilms were prepared using the Constant Depth Film Fer-menter (CDFF) and a reconstituted human epidermis (RHE) model. The specificity of PNA probes for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and universal bacterial detection was initially determined using planktonic bacterial preparations. Subsequently, biofilms comprising target and non-target species were prepared on PTFE discs in a constant depth film fermenter, and on reconstituted human epithelium (SkinEthic Laboratories). Biofilms were washed with PBS and PNA probes (100-400nM) applied for 1 h at 55\u221eC. Sections of these stained biofilms were then viewed by CLSM. The specificity of the PNA probes was confirmed using mixed preparations of planktonic bacteria and multiplex PNA probing. The identification of target bacteria within the biofilms was also evident, confirming the suitability of the approach for biofilm analysis. CLSM revealed clustering of individual species within the biofilm, with limited co-localisation of mixed species; defined aggregates of bacteria being evident in the dermis of CVLUs. The development of this standardized procedure makes available an assay for simultaneous identification of single or multi-species bacterial populations using distinctly labelled PNA probes. The protocol presented gives a reliable basis to design and perform PNA FISH analysis on both bacterial biofilms and infected tissue and offers an approach to assess targeted biofilm disruption strategies in vivo.",

            "text": "Longterm use of the macrolide, azithromycin, has shown a significant clinical improvement for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, its longterm effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the CF airways to macrolides has not yet been examined. The aim of this study was therefore to determine the level of erythromycin resistance in naturally colonising viridans group streptococci (VGS) and pneumococci, as well as to characterize macrolide resistance gene determinants via sequence analysis. Streptococci (190) were isolated from 54 sputum specimens from 41 adult CF patients, 35 who were on longterm oral azithromycin therapy for at least the previous seven months. Macrolide resistance was examined by standard disk diffusion assay and molecularly for the presence of erm(B) determinant, as well as mef(A/E). Among the isolates tested, the majority of them (128; 67.7%) were resistant to erythromycin, whilst a further 37 (19.4%) had reduced susceptibility, leaving only 25 (13.2%) isolates sensitive. These results are well correlated to the presence of macrolide resistance determinants, as demonstrated by possession of the erm(B) gene 29/190 (15.3%), the mef(A/E) gene 129/190 (67.9%) and both erm(B) + mef(A/E) genes simultaneously 14/190 (7.4%). These results indicate that genotypic resistance for macrolides is common in VGS in adult CF patients, with efflux being over three times more frequent as a resistance mechanism than rRNA methylation, in comparison. Chronic treatment with azithromycin in patients with CF may reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal streptococcal flora, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of macrolide antibiotic resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic sensitive pathogens. Reid, A.; McCaughan, J.; Jenkins, L.; Leavy, A. Paediatric, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children, Belfast, United Kingdom Background: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) remains an important common pathogen in the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung. Chronic PA infection is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality in the CF population. Over the last 15 years there has been major emphasis on early identification and eradication of PA in an attempt to stop or slow progression to chronic infection. Since the early 1990s we have adopted various modifications of the Danish Protocol for PA eradication. In 2004 we also introduced segregation of all inpatients and outpatients, not just those colonised with B. cepacia or MRSA.",

During the normal physiological, disease-free state and in the absence of inflammation, the anti-proteinase activity of A1AT outweighs the proteinase burden, hence preventing hNE-mediated damage to airway tissue and local defences. Previously Morihara et al.

Department of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, University Of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada; 4. Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University Of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common fatal genetic disease affecting young Caucasians. CF is a multi-organ disease that primarily affects the lungs and digestive system, with the majority of mortalities resulting from pulmonary failure due to repeated pulmonary exacerbations. Recently the Streptococcus milleri group (SMG: S. anginosus, S. constellatus and S. intermedius) has been implicated in pulmonary exacerbations of CF patients due to the development of a SMG selective media. This media has allowed for the detection of SMG and shows that it is an under-reported respiratory pathogen. Our aim was to develop a real-time PCR assay to complement the detection of SMG within diagnostic samples. The cpn60 gene was chosen as a target based on multiple sequence alignments showing conserved regions within SMG. These conserved regions were used to develop primers and probes that were selective for SMG. The Roche Lightcycler 2.0 was used for real-time PCR assays, along with Roche Hybridization probe real-time PCR technologies. Streptococcus constellatus, S. intermedius, and S. anginosus ATCC type-strains can be amplified using a single hybridization probe set. Clinical strain analysis showed that speciation based on melting curve analysis allowed for the majority S. constellatus and S. intermedius isolates to be correctly identified and most of the S. anginosus strains. To improve our ability to detect SMG in complex polymicrobial specimens, two 16s rRNA real-time PCR assays were developed targeting the 16s rRNA gene. The 16s_SA assay is specific for S. anginosus, while the 16s_SCI assay is specific for S. constellatus and S. intermedius. These assays can detect less than 10 genome equivalents for the target strains in pure culture and >10 5 genome equivalents in complex polymicrobial specimens. This sensitive quantitative molecular test will allow rapid identification of SMG in sputum samples. ",

Recently members of the SMG group have been shown to be important pathogens in pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Currently, there is little information on the genetic composition of SMG and factors contributing to virulence. We conducted whole genome sequence analysis of two isolates of each species Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus and Streptococcus intermedius, that comprise the SMG group. For each species a representative strain from CF airways (numerically dominant isolate during acute exacerbation) and invasive isolates (from other body sites) were analyzed to study the genetic relationships of the pathogens. Pyrosequencing, using the GS FLX platform, was used for whole genome sequence generation. Sequence was arranged using the Staden suite of pro-grams and gaps were filled using a combination of fosmid library development and primer walking. The genomes were then run through the NML Bioinformatics core genome analysis pipeline, including analysis with GenDB suite of programs for automated annotation, checked for potential frameshifts, and finally manually annotated to ensure proper start calls for genes and appropriate detection of regions for genes with lower known homologies. Any sequence deviations including SNPs, length of homopolymers, and insertions or deletions were checked using PCR and traditional Sanger sequencing.",

            "text": "Streptococcus constellatus was the smallest genome with 1663 automated gene calls and a genome size of 1935392 bp and a 38.18% G+C content, S. intermedius had 1666 gene calls a genome size of 1996181 bp and 37.56 G+C content, while S. anginosus was larger with 2024 gene calls and a genome size of 2233408 Mbp and 38.25 G+C content. The sizes of these genomes are within the range of already sequenced Streptococcus genomes and the G+C content is within the previously predicted range for SMG (37-41%). The availability of sequence data for these organisms will allow indepth study of this pathogen such as development of specific PCR diagnostic assays, insight into potential virulence factors and novel information regarding the biology of the organisms. The airways of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are typically infected with multiple pathogens, including but not limited to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), Staphylococcus aureus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Burkholderia spp. and Aspergillus ssp. There is concern that an alteration in the bacterial microenvironment by an antibiotic can promote growth of untreated or resistant pathogens. AZLI is an anti-pseudomonal antibiotic with a lysine excipient that has significantly reduced mean sputum PA density in two 28-day course multicenter, randomized, Mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) is most commonly a result of massive bacterial infection in the lungs due to reduced mucociliary clearance. Although the most common bacterial species found in CF lungs are classic opportunists like Pseudomonas and Burkholderia, most infections consist of a multispecies community. Bacterial communities can display emergent properties due to the complex interactions within the community and with the host tissue, and the impact of these interactions on the overall pathology of CF is not fully understood. To examine these complex bacterial infections and interactions in a CF-like environment, we have developed a novel technique for the installation of a mucus simulant that closely mimics the viscoelastic properties of CF mucus. Low melting point agarose (LMPA) maintains viscoelastic properties similar to water at high temperature (42 o C) but forms a viscoelastic gel upon cooling to 37 o C. C57/BL6J mice were infected intratracheally with varying doses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 x 10 3 -1 x 10 7 ) with low LMPA or saline and examined 72h later. Challenges with agarose resulted in decreased survival of the mice, with nearly 70% dying within 48 hours when dosed with more than 1 x 10 5 bacteria. Similar numbers of bacteria suspended in saline were well tolerated and all survived. Bacteria (10 5 ) suspended in saline were more than 90% cleared by 72h, but when suspended in agarose were maintained at the inoculum density or higher. Across the dose response curve, LMPA-Ps challenged animals exhibited increased total cell and neutrophillic infiltration of the airways, along with increased expression of key inflammatory cytokines compared to saline-Ps challenged mice. Histologic examination confirmed restriction of infection and inflammation to airways of the LMPA-Ps dosed animals compared to control, and hypoxic regions in the airway lumen. Low volume LMPA-Ps challenge appears to be a good technique to develop chronic bacterial airways infections with hypoxic niches.

            "text": "These findings clearly show that specific Pa IgY has an effect on Pa. However, the increased adherence mediated by IgY was surprising and it contradicts earlier findings of a decreased adherence to epithelial cells of healthy individuals obtained from skin or the external auditory canal. This discrepancy might be explained either by differences in cell source or differences in techniques. A plausible explanation of the clinically demonstrated efficacy would be that bacteria are anchored in the oropharynx after gargling with specific Pa IgY and cleared by local defence mechanisms rather than being inhaled into the lower airway where infection can be established. 1 1. Adult Cystic Fibrosis Centre, Cork University Hospital, Cork, Ireland; 2. Otorhinolaryngological Department, South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital, Cork, Ireland Introduction: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a well-recognized clinical syndrome affecting patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and has been implicated in recurrent infective pulmonary exacerbations. Self-reported symptoms in the CF population are low, despite a high prevalence of radiological and clinical sino-nasal disease. Few studies have addressed the implications of unrecognized upper airways disease on clinical phenotype in adult CF.",

We suggest that IS should be considered more routinely in the clinical setting; its use could save patients from more invasive investigation such as bronchoalveolar lavage and could result in the earlier and more rational treatment of lower airway infection. Agmatine is the decarboxylation product of arginine and a number of bacteria have devoted enzymatic pathways for its metabolism. Pseudomonas aeruginosa harbors the aguBA operon that is upregulated by agmatine and results in conversion of agmatine to putrescine, which can be subsequently converted into other polyamines or shunted into the TCA cycle for energy production. We have discovered an alternate agmatine operon in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA14 named agu2ABCA' that contains two genes for agmatine deiminases (agu2A and agu2A'). Agu2A' contains a twin-arginine translocation signal at its N-terminus and site directed mutagenesis and cell fractionation experiments confirmed this protein is secreted to the periplasm. Analysis of the agu2ABCA' promoter demonstrates agmatine induces expression of the operon during the stationary phase of growth and agu2ABCA' provides only weak complementation of aguBA, which is induced during log phase. We hypothesized the preferred expression during stationary phase, and the periplasmic location of Agu2A' may implicate agu2ABCA' in biofilm production. Biofilm assays of mutants of all three agmatine deiminase genes in PA14 revealed agu2ABCA', specifically its secreted product Agu2A', enhance the biofilm production of PA14 in the presence of agmatine. Without agu2ABCA', the PA14 biofilm is reduced in the presence of agmatine, showing agu2ABCA' reverses the biofilm response to exogenous agmatine and implicates role for polyamines in the biofilm development of P. aeruginosa.",

Nanoemulsions (NE) are oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by surfactants with an average droplet size of ~400 nm. They have broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and kill pathogens by interacting with their membranes. This physical kill-on-contact mechanism significantly reduces the possibility of the emergence of resistant strains. The NE is formulated from pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients.

Inclusion criteria for this study was diagnosis of CF, first MRSA positive culture within past year, positive MRSA culture during data collection period, treatment with eradication protocol, and at least one follow-up culture. The primary outcome of this study was reduction or elimination of MRSA on culture. Other data collected were CF culture results, pre and post-treatment, oxygen saturations, antibiotics used, weight, and demographic data. A Mann-Whitney test and paired t-test were used for statistical analysis. This project was IRB approved.",

This population included patients found to be recently positive for this organism. The approach in our center addresses environmental contamination, nasal and skin carriage and treatment of contacts. Our approach utilizes an inexpensive oral regimen at first colonization. Linezolid use is carefully monitored. More studies are needed to see which treatments are most effective and to look for trends of increased antibiotic resistance and increased P. aeruginosa burden. Eliminating MRSA may be beneficial since previous retrospective studies have shown that chronic colonization with MRSA may lead to decreased lung function.",

Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada; 3. Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada P. aeruginosa strains adapt to the lung environment within the cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Our hypothesis is that an alternate CFTR genotype, specifically the M1101K mutation, in CF patients may influence the P. aeruginosa lineages colonizing the lungs. The M1101K CFTR mutation is rare in the global CF population with an occurrence of 0.8%. However, founder effects and subsequent genetic isolation in the Hutterite brethren of North America has resulted in a predominance of this mutation in these CF patients. In order to test our hypothesis, we obtained isolates from two populations of patients that attended the UCMC Adult CF Clinic; M1101K CF patients and general CF patients. A total of 24 isolates from five M1101K patients were assessed and compared to 24 isolates from twelve general CF patients. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) revealed that in the 48 isolates there were 18 sequence types (STs) representing different P. aeruginosa lineages. Based on the P. aeruginosa MLST website (http://pubmlst.org/paeruginosa/), nine of those STs were previously identified in other CF isolates from Canada, the UK, the Netherlands, and Spain. In both patient populations, we found CF isolates that accounted for seven novel STs. Only two of our isolates had STs that were previously identified in a non-CF nosocomial isolate or an environmental isolate. In the isolates from the general CF population, three clonal complexes were present with the founder isolate for clonal complex 3, ST-17, previously identified in CF isolates from Canada and the UK with some ST-17 isolates reported as epidemic strains. There were also two clonal types, present in five of the general CF patients and in other CF isolates from Canada. Overall, these results suggested that in the general CF patients there was a predilection for P. aeruginosa lineages that were also identified in other CF patients rather than lineages found in environmental or nosocomial isolates. With respect to the P. aeruginosa isolates from M1101K patients, these patients were colonized with different lineages not seen in our general CF patients despite living in the same geographical region and attending the same CF clinic. Further, the trend was for the maintenance of one P. aeruginosa lineage in each M1101K patient. In comparison, isolates from our general CF population showed genetic variability within patients and overlap of STs between patients with lineages previously seen in CF isolates being favoured. Interestingly, the one exception was the M1101K homozygous patients that shared the same lineage, ST-689, suggesting a preference for this lineage in these patients. Overall, the isolates from M1101K patients revealed a more genetically homogenous and stable population of P. aeruginosa in each patient. Taken together, these results suggested that the M1101K CFTR allele might play a role in the predilection for or maintenance of P. aeruginosa lineages in these CF patients.",

Some of this variability has been explained by specific environmental factors; however a portion remains unexplained and may be due to non-CFTR genetic factors. Innate immune inflammatory responses might play a role in the pathogenesis of airway disease in CF.

Background: Progressive decline in lung function is a defining feature of cystic fibrosis (CF). Yet, clinical course varies considerably even among children carrying the same genetic mutations. It is unclear which children are at risk for earlier and more severe lung disease and who will experience a more rapid decline in lung function. Since airway inflammation plays a central role in CF lung disease, biomarkers of inflammation that can be used to monitor disease activity would be extremely valuable.",

Changes in FEV1 correlated with changes in % neutrophils (r=-0.38, p=0.02), TIMP-1 (r=-0.37, p=0.03) and weakly correlated with changes in IL-8 (r=-0.29, p=0.09) and NEAPC (r=0.29, p=0.09).

Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2005; 172:885) . Using this approach, 19 subjects were \"decliners\" and 16 were \"maintainers.\" A logistic regression model revealed that the initial measurement of TIMP-1 had the highest individual predictive value for subsequent lung function decline (c=0.78) while TIMP-1, SLPI and TNF-\u03b1 had the highest combined predictive value (c=0.77). Examining the predictive value of biomarker slopes (i.e changes over time), the single best predictor of lung function decline was NEAPC (c=0.67) while the best predictive combination was elastase, NEAPC and TNF-\u03b1 (c=0.79).",

PTC Therapeutics, South Plainfield, NJ, USA Background: Though chronic coughing is among the most prominent of cystic fibrosis (CF)-related symptoms, objective cough assessment has seldom been performed in patients with CF. The LifeShirt \u00ae (VivoMetrics, Ventura, CA) is a new device that quantitatively measures cough. The LifeShirt \u00ae incorporates motion-sensing transducers, electrodes, a microphone, and a 3-axis accelerometer into a lightweight, washable vest. The frequency and intensity of cough can be measured using integrated input from the motion sensors and microphone. The device is designed to discard events such as throat-clearing, sneezing, sighing, or talking. Data are stored on a compact flash card housed within the recorder and can be uploaded for analysis using specialized software. We used the LifeShirt \u00ae to characterize coughing in patients with CF.",

Although these are pilot study results, the data suggests home monitoring can detect exacerbations more than two weeks before patients typically seek medical care; therefore, early intervention may improve CF outcomes. Although not statistically significant, there was less use of IV and oral antibiotics during the study period compared to the prior 6 months. Though speculative, this may be a result of objective feedback leading to better treatment adherence resulting in less need for antibiotics. There was also a clinically meaningful improvement of 5% in FEV1 during the home monitoring period, though it was not statistically significant in this pilot study. Therefore, home measurement of FEV1 could be used to promote earlier, more aggressive pulmonary therapy, to prevent more severe exacerbations, possibly improving long-term lung function.

One patient was diagnosed with Wolfe-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, six with atrioventricular nodal-reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), one with atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, and three with unspecified supraventricular tachycardia. CFTR genotypes included two \u2206F508 homozygotes, five \u2206F508 heterozygotes, three non-\u2206F508 heterozygotes, and one with unknown genetics. Lung function (FEV1) at time of diagnosis of SVT ranged from 23% to 75% predicted. No patients had a history of cardiac disease or clinical evidence of cor pulmonale. Four patients were investigated with echocardiograms, all of which showed normal left and right ventricular function and normal chamber dimensions. All patients had hemoglobin levels greater than 100 mmol/L and there were no identified thyroid hormone abnormalities. Nine of eleven patients were treated with \u03b2-agonists and no patients were treated with theophylline or atropine. For management, four patients underwent slow pathway ablation for AVNRT, one patient (with WPW) was treated with fle-cainide, three patients were treated with diltiazem, and three patients received no specific treatment.",

We report the largest case series of SVT in adult patients with CF to date. No clear association of SVT with CFTR genotype, CF disease manifestations, or treatment was determined. In contrast to previously published case reports, these eleven patients did not have underlying cor pulmonale and were not treated with theophylline or atropine. A combination of clinical factors may predispose certain patients with CF to development of SVT, or there may, in fact, be no association present between the two conditions. Advances in molecular cardiology research regarding the physiologic role of CFTR in the heart may provide further clarification. Junge, S.; Brinkmann, F.; Ballmann, M. paediatric, medical school, hannover, Germany Background: Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a rare complication of cystic fibrosis (CF). Sensitization to Aspergillus fumigatus leads to allergic inflammation of the lower respiratory tract. Persistent ABPA is suspected to cause permanent pulmonary damage.

Radiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA Computed tomography (CT) scans in infants and children with cystic fibrosis (CF) have revealed early and previously undetectable alterations in lung structure that precede changes in pulmonary function. Children who cannot lie still and perform the respiratory maneuvers for CT scanning require sedation or general anesthesia (GA) to ensure motionless images and the necessary lung volumes needed to produce high-quality images. GA is reported to be more time efficient than conscious sedation with less side effects and negligible failure rates. The ProSeal\u2122 LMA (laryngeal mask airway, PLMA\u2122) under GA allows for higher inspiratory pressures without tracheal intubation for assisted ventilation with a conduit to suction the stomach.

Consequently, it is clinically relevant to validate a multi-factorial scoring system to simultaneously assess pulmonary function, anatomical involvement and their clinical consequences. In this context, numerous radiographic and clinical scoring systems have been used, including the Shwachman-Kulczycki Clinical Score (SK) and the Brasfield Radiological Score (BR). On the other hand, Celli et al. (N Engl J Med 2004; 350:1005-12) developed the 0-10 BODE index which includes measurements of body composition (body mass index: BMI), airflow obstruction (forced expiratory volume in one second, FEV 1 ), dyspnoea (Modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale) and exercise capacity (six-minute walking distance, 6MWD) for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This scheme has been found to predict exacerbations, hospitalizations and mortality, being also sensitive to detect changes over time after interventions in COPD patients. To the best of the author's knowledge, however, no previous study has investigated whether such a multi-dimensional scoring system is also useful in CF adult patients.",

            "text": "Lactate concentrations in CF sputum can be determined non-invasively and several times a day. It may be used for treatment control of stable as well as exacerbated CF patients. It is inexpensive and can be investigated using routine equipment. Antibiotic as well as antiinflammatory or even mucolytic therapies most probably are reflected by changes in lactate values. This is especially true for the rapid control of exacerbation treatment. Therefore, lactate is a promising marker substance for the short-term control of the progression of CF lung infection and inflammation. Exercise is increasingly prescribed for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) as adjunct to chest clearance regimens, to increase the quality of life, and as a strategy that may prolong life. Previous studies have demonstrated desaturation during exercise in patients with CF when compared to healthy control subjects. The diffusing capacity of the lungs represents the transfer of gas from the alveoli to the pulmonary capillaries, is influenced by alveolarcapillary membrane conductance (DM) and pulmonary capillary blood volume (Vc), and is a factor that influences peripheral oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ). We sought to determine the influence of CF on DLCO, DM, and Vc along with SaO 2 during exercise. To determine this we recruited six mild/moderate CF patients (age=24\u00b17years, ht=174\u00b11cm. wt=67\u00b16kg, BMI=22\u00b12kg/m 2 , VO 2 peak=50\u00b12%pred., FEV1=61\u00b121%pred.) and 10 healthy control subjects (age=30\u00b110years, ht=176\u00b110cm. wt=76\u00b113kg, BMI=25\u00b15kg/m 2 , VO 2 peak=97\u00b126%pred., FEV1=92\u00b115%pred.) for study. Subjects performed cycle ergometry to exhaustion using three minute stage increments with continuous monitoring of SaO 2 and measures of DM and Vc taken at each stage using the diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide and nitric oxide. There were no differences in SaO 2 at rest, however, the CF patients had a lower SaO 2 at peak exercise (SaO 2 rest=97\u00b11 vs. 96\u00b12%, SaO 2 peak=97\u00b11 vs. 94\u00b12, for healthy and CF, respectively, mean\u00b1SD, p<0.05 at peak). At rest, there were no significant differences in DM, Vc, or DM/Vc (alveolar-capillary conductance corrected for the amount of pulmonary capillary blood)(DM=36\u00b17 vs. 32\u00b15ml/min/mmHg, Vc=75\u00b137 vs. 55\u00b126ml, DM/Vc=0.59\u00b10.2 vs. 0.63\u00b10.2, for healthy and CF, respectively). At peak exercise, the healthy subjects demonstrated a significant increase in DM and sustained DM/Vc, whereas the CF subjects had no change in DM and a drop in DM/Vc (DM=53\u00b114 vs. 34\u00b18ml/min/mmHg, Vc=100\u00b133 vs. 92\u00b134ml, DM/Vc=0.56\u00b10.15 vs. 0.39\u00b10.11, for healthy and CF, respectively, p<0.05 healthy vs. CF for DM and DM/vc). At peak exercise, there was a mild relationship in DM/Vc and SaO 2 in CF patients that did not reach statistical significance, likely because of the relatively small sample size (CF r=0.51, healthy r=0.15, p=0.15 for CF and p=0.7 for healthy). These results suggest an attenuation in the increase in alveolar-capillary membrane conductance with exercise in patients with CF which may contribute, in part, to a drop in SaO 2 along with the ventilation/perfusion mismatch that is known in this patient population. Predictors of survival can be useful in planning treatment, especially when referral for transplantation is considered. The BODE index (Body mass index, degree of airflow Obstruction, Dyspnea, and Exercise capacity) is now accepted as a useful tool to predict survival in COPD. However, it has not previously been used to assess survival in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). To study this further, we looked at a modified BODE index (mBODE) in a cohort of 65 adult CF patients (mean age 27 (range 18 to 46), 35 female) and compared its utility with the more standard measures of FEV1 and exercise tolerance in predicting survival.",

There were no differences in treatment failure between the two groups (based on 30 day readmission rates). Our home IV program is a safe alternative in large part due to detailed patient education, close monitoring, partnerships with neighborhood home care networks and careful follow-up by an organized team of caregivers specifically dedicated to the home IV program. With newer nebulizing devices offering significant advantages in both time for pulmonary lung delivery and efficiency, confusion often arises with regard to the appropriate charge dose for various devices. The PARI LC Star \u00ae breath enhanced nebulizer is one of the more efficient of its type and the newer vibrating membrane system, the PARI eFlow \u00ae appears to be faster, more efficient and more flexible in that the particle size produced can be manipulated by changing the pore size in the membrane. The purpose of this study was to investigate relative equivalence of pulmonary deposition and time required for it. On 2 occasions, 6 normal adult males inhaled either 36 mg of normal saline in 4 mL using the LC Star \u00ae driven by the PARI ProNeb Ultra compressor or 22.5 mg in 2.5 mL from an investigational model eFlow \u00ae with a 30 membrane which produced a similar particle size distribution to the LC Star \u00ae . The radiolabel 99m Tc-DTPA was added to both solutions. The choice of the charge \"dose\" was based on in vitro device performance which was used to estimate what would yield an equivalent in vivo lung deposition. Lung deposition was quantified using previously described nuclear medicine techniques (Coates et al. J Aerosol Med 2007; 20:320) which accounts for pulmonary clearance of the radiolabel during nebulization through both mucociliary action and absorption into the pulmonary circulation so the slower system will not be biased to favour the faster. Pulmonary deposition was 9.6 (8.8, 10.4) mg (mean with 95% C.I.) or 26.4 % of charge for the LC STAR \u00ae and 8.6 (7.8, 9.4) or 38.0% for the investigational eFlow \u00ae . The time to \"dryness\" of the LC STAR \u00ae was 11.8 (10.1, 13.5) minutes and 4.8 (4.5, 5.0) for the investigational eFlow \u00ae . There were no differences in pulmonary distribution for the two devices. The investigational eFlow \u00ae is about 2.5 fold faster than the LC STAR \u00ae . This study suggests that in vitro testing slightly overestimated eFlow \u00ae efficiency. When changing from one nebulization system to another, it is essential to consider device efficiency when choosing the appropriate charge dose. Tamalet We have previously shown that one year of AZ treatment was associated with a decrease in respiratory exacerbations and number of antibiotic courses. The aim of this study was to confirm these results in a long term openlabelled trial in children with CF.",

The Wisconsin randomized clinical trial of CF NBS (RCT), with enrollment from 1985-1994, led to the implementation of the Wisconsin Routine CF NBS (ROUTINE) program in 1994.

Later survival in these patients suggests the possibility of more prolonged indwelling catheter duration, for which the safety has not been established. There is a need for consensus guidelines for the prevention of thrombosis associated with prolonged indwelling catheters in CF patients. Objective: Airway hyperreactivity and bronchodilator responsiveness are common in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF); little is known about the prevalence of bronchodilator responsiveness in CF infants. Our objective was to determine prevalence of bronchodilator responsiveness in a population of CF infants who underwent clinically indicated infant pulmonary function testing (PFTs).",

PFTs were performed using the raised volume rapid thoracoabdominal compression technique to measure forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 0.5 seconds (FEV 0.5 ), and forced expiratory flows at 75%, 85%, and 25-75% of FVC (FEF 75 , FEF 85 , and FEF 25-75 , respectively). Forced expiratory maneuvers were performed before and 10 minutes after 2-6 puffs of albuterol MDI (administered until subject's heart rate increased \u226510% or to a maximum 6 puffs). Bronchodilator responsiveness was defined in two ways: 1) increase in FEF 75 of >24% and/or increase in FEF 85 >39%, or 2) increase in FEV 0.5 of > 12.8% and/or increase in FEF 25-75 >24% (Goldstein et al.

Harrison, A.N.; Castro, G.; Dashefsky, L.; Nussbaum, E. Pediatric Pulmonary, Allergy, and Cystic Fibrosis, Miller Children's Hospital, Long Beach, CA, USA Rationale: Infant pulmonary function testing (IPFT) has become a standard clinical tool for the evaluation of lung function in infants with cystic fibrosis (CF) at many large CF Care Centers. However, most centers utilize a conscious sedation protocol that uses chloral hydrate (CH) as the primary sedative agent. Due to several recent reports of unpredictability of both treatment effect and side effect profile, our pediatric sedation team elected to utilize continuous propofol infusion (CPI) instead for outpatient testing. Chloral hydrate was used for testing patients tested as inpatients. Our hypothesis was that CPI would provide comparable data to patients studied via a CH protocol.",

A total of 9 patients were studied (3 with CH, 5 with CPI, and 1 with ketamine/versed secondary to soy allergy). Chloral hydrate was administered as an initial 50 mg/kg dose, followed by 25 mg/kg doses up to a total of 100 mg/kg, if necessary. Doses used for testing ranged from 50-100 mg/kg. CPI was performed with continuous intravenous infusion of propofol as needed. Doses used for testing ranged from 60-250 mcg/kg/minute of propofol, with most patients requiring doses at the lower end of the reported range. The average age at testing was 17.6 months. Patients were kept NPO for a minimum of 6 hours prior to testing, as per the policies and procedures in place at our institution. IPFT was performed using the Infant Pulmonary Laboratory by nSpire. Lung mechanics, including Rrs and Crs, were measured by the occlusion technique. Forced expiratory flows, including FVC, FEV0.5, FEF 25-75, FEF 75, and FEF 85, were obtained by raised volume rapid thoracic compression (RVRTC). Plethysmography was performed to obtain total lung capacity (TLC), residual volume (RV), and RV/TLC ratio. All patients were either observed closely in the pediatric recovery room following testing until ready for discharge (following CPI) or returned to the pediatric ward with continuous cardiac and respiratory monitoring until they had recovered fully (following CH).",

The above correlations between walk distance and lung functions, and between FEV1 and minimum SaO 2 and delta SaO 2 were also significant for both the male and female subgroups, with the correlations for walk distance and both FVC and FEV1 being stronger in the female than in the male group. For both genders and for the whole group, the correlations between walk distance and lung functions tended to be stronger in patients < 18 years as compared to patients > 18 years of age.",

In female patients, the correlations were stronger than in males, and in younger patients they were stronger than in older ones. It remains to be shown whether treatment-induced changes in walk distance are also correlated to the respective changes in lung function. Azithromycin is a macrolide having antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties without immune-suppression. Compared to oral and parenteral drug administration, inhalation may offer treatment benefits for several respiratory diseases (e.g. bronchiolitis obliterans, cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, community acquired pneumonia, ventilator associated pneumonia, pulmonary ciliary dyskinesia). Hickey et al. (J Aerosol Med 2006; 19 :54) evaluated aerosolization efficiency of different concentrations of azithromycin solutions with jet nebulizers. The solutions were prepared from a reconstituted Zithromax \u00ae freeze-dried powder. However, a reconstituted Zithromax \u00ae solution is stable only for 7 days when stored under refrigeration and azithromycin is known for its very bitter taste. To improve patient-acceptance of nebulized azithromycin solutions, we developed novel, stable, taste-masked aqueous formulations with high azithromycin concentrations using excipients, which are generally regarded as safe. The inhalation formulation was composed to achieve an antioxidative effect in vivo, improve airway surface liquid hydration and mucociliary clearance.",

Background: Levels of sputum cytokines may reflect the degree of inflammation in the cystic fibrosis (CF) airway, and thus be useful to monitor changes in response to interventions. However, many of the methods used for cytokine detection have not been formally validated for use with sputum. Dithiothreitol (DTT) has commonly been used to separate cellular components for total and differential cell counts. However, DTT acts by cleaving disulphide bonds, present in soluble mediators and in reagent antibodies; analysis of the soluble phase with immunoassays may therefore be significantly impaired in the presence of DTT. It has been previously recommended for non-CF sputum that DTT be removed by dialysis under conditions that encourage the reformation of disulphide bonds, as this improves cytokine detection. Here we looked at the effects both of DTT and its removal with dialysis on detection of cytokines with a Luminex system in CF sputum.",

Recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase) has been shown to improve pulmonary function and high resolution computerized tomographic (HRCT) imaging scores in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). The purpose of this study was to quantify the effects of rhDNase in infants with CF using infant pulmonary function tests (IPFTs) and controlled ventilation HRCT chest imaging. Twenty-four infants who were clinically well at the time of entry into the study were randomized to receive rhDNase (2.5 mg) or placebo by nebulization once daily for 6 months. Investigators and parents were blinded regarding treatment group. Raised volume rapid thoracic compression spirometry, plethysmographic fractional lung volumes and controlled ventilation HRCT images of the chest at 25 and 0 cm H 2 O were obtained at baseline and after 6 months of treatment. Lung function and HRCT measurements were obtained on 24 infants at baseline (mean age 42 \u00b1 32 weeks) and on 19 and 21 infants respectively at 6 months. IPFT results were expressed as percents of predicted and as z-scores based on published normal values. HRCT images were quantified using the Brody scoring system modified for very mild disease. Airway wall thicknesses (AWT), airway lumen diameters (ALD) and accompanying vessel diameters (VD) were measured from axial images with electronic calipers using a GE workstation. Mean AWT/VD and ALD/VD ratios were calculated at baseline and at 6 months for each patient. Between treatment group differences in baseline to 6 month changes were assessed using unpaired t-tests. At baseline mean lung function was near normal (FEV0.5 98.1 \u00b1 13.4, FEF25-75 87.4 \u00b1 24.7 and RV/TLC 86.4 \u00b1 23.4% of predicted). No significant differences in changes (\u2206) from baseline to 6 months between the two treatment groups were detected for any of the IPFT measures expressed as z-scores (z). Similarly no significant between treatment group differences were found for baseline to 6 month changes in total HRCT score, air trapping (AT) subscore, AWT/VD or ALD/VD ratios (see table below). In this relatively healthy population of infants with CF, we were unable to detect any differences between patients treated with rhDNase and placebo over a 6 month interval using IPFTs and HRCT imaging of the chest.",

The decrease in FEV1 was smaller than the change in FEV1 after 1 year of inhalation with the conventional jet nebuliser (control period, -3.1%), although this difference was not statistically significant. The same effect was seen in MEF25[%] (-2.6% with conventional nebuliser compared to -1.6% after eFlow \u00ae rapid). Concerning the FVC, there was a greater improvement after 1 year of inhalation with the eFlow \u00ae rapid than with the jet nebuliser (+ 2.9% vs. +1.1%). For PEF%, there was an increase during the control period, whereas after inhalation with eFlow \u00ae rapid there was a decrease (+1.1% vs. -2.9%). All changes were not significantly different. The eFlow \u00ae rapid reduced total daily inhalation time by two-thirds (conventional nebuliser: 31.1 min/day; eFlow \u00ae rapid: 10.2 min/day, n=70 patients) Conclusion: Inhalation with the new nebuliser eFlow \u00ae rapid does not alter FEV1, FVC or PEF significantly after 1 year of inhalation. The treatment time could be significantly reduced by inhalation with the eFlow \u00ae rapid. Background: Pulmonary exacerbations compromise patient well-being and augment disease burden for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Lack of consensus regarding the definition of exacerbation complicates the evaluation of exacerbation frequency, severity, and duration in CF therapeutic trials. Further efforts are needed to standardize the assessment of exacerbations, particularly considering the patient perspective. Exacerbations in COPD and CF have common clinical features, including dyspnea, coughing, sputum production, chest discomfort, and fatigue. The EXACT is a patientreported outcome (PRO) measure designed to standardize the assessment of pulmonary exacerbations in clinical trials involving patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The EXACT total score is derived from 14 questions that capture information on Breathlessness (5 items), Cough and Sputum (2 items), Chest Symptoms (3 items) and systemic attributes of exacerbation (4 items). The EXACT improves accuracy and eliminates recall bias by asking patients to provide an evaluation of their health state, including pulmonary symptoms, every day before bedtime. Data entry and transmission are facilitated through use of a portable, handheld electronic device and require ~3 minutes to complete. This study examined the suitability of the EXACT for patients with CF by examining the extent to which items comprising the EXACT are understandable and meaningful to these patients.",

This study suggests the items comprising the EXACT are relevant to patients with CF across a range of ages, including both adults and children and provides guidelines for using the EXACT in young patients. In conjunction with physician assessment of exacerbations, the utility of the EXACT to document CF pulmonary exacerbations will be assessed in a Phase 3 study of ataluren (PTC124\u2122) as a treatment for nonsense mutation CF. Introduction: Detecting a pulmonary exacerbation (PE) is important in outpatient cystic fibrosis (CF) care. Since the definition of a PE is subjective, identification of an exacerbation varies among practitioners, and this inconsistency has been identified at our CF Center. Scoring systems have been developed in other institutions to standardize identification of PEs in a more objective manner in order to improve care. Our Center has used a categorical assessment of pulmonary status, but we implemented a pulmonary exacerbation score (PES) in 2007 to improve pulmonary care and outcomes in our CF population. The objective of this study was to compare PES to the categorical system and to determine if implementation of the PES improved detection of an exacerbation and therefore increased treatment and followup.",

This could result from an insufficient number of patients or an inadequate time frame, both of which would result in underpowering of the study. Also, the relative weighting of the sub-score elements of PES may have biased the results. PES may be a better tool than a categorical system to identify pulmonary exacerbations in patients with CF. Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by progressive destruction of the lungs with highly elevated levels of pro-inflammatory mediators -i.e. the chemokine IL-8 -leading to massive infiltration of neutrophils into the airways. In the CF airway microenvironment, airway neutrophils undergo apoptosis and necrosis and release significant amounts of pro-inflammatory mediators and neutrophil elastase (NE) resulting in further tissue damage. CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR protein which is the major transporter of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) in airway epithelial cells. CFTR mutations are believed to lead to depleted levels of GSH in the epithelial lining fluids (ELF). It was hypothesized that due to extracellular GSH deficiency effector cells like neutrophils loose intracellular GSH into the ELF. Low intracellular GSH levels are associated with oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis of cells.",

These results demonstrate that during a pulmonary exacerbation, patients are limited by dyspnea and those with lower lung function have lower exercise tolerance.

These findings show that MSWT is a useful measure of improvement in the hospital and has potential applications to assess exercise tolerance in an outpatient setting.",

Background: Aquagenic wrinkling of the palms (AWP) is a cutaneous phenomenon marked by the transient formation of edematous, translucent papules and plaques on the palms and fingertips within minutes of exposure to water. In the few reports in the literature, it appears that AWP may be associated with cystic fibrosis (CF). We hypothesized that AWP is an underreported cutaneous manifestation of CF. The primary aim of the trial was to establish the prevalence of aquagenic wrinkling in children with cystic fibrosis relative to controls. <\\>> Methods: Fifty children with CF and 25 control children without CF who were being treated for asthma underwent a 5 minute hand immersion in lukewarm water to attempt to induce AWP. The test was considered positive if subjects demonstrated >30% wrinkling over the palmar surface area. Among subjects with CF, secondary correlations were attempted to deter-mine whether CFTR genotype/mutation class, pancreatic sufficiency, body mass index (BMI), sweat chloride levels, palmar transepidermal water loss as measured by a vapometer, and most recent FEV1% predicted were associated with the presence or absence of AWP.",

            "text": "The present study was conceived to elucidate novel relationships among hematologic and sputum iron indices and clinically-relevant metrics of CF care. Preliminary data from fifteen stable outpatients and eight patients hospitalized for exacerbation were analyzed. Spearman's rank correlation (\u03c1) was used to determine relationships among biochemical and categorical variables (Table 1) . Lower serum iron levels were associated with inpatient status, diabetes mellitus, inhaled tobramycin and dornase alfa use, and lower FEV1. These data suggest that iron-deficiency anemia is a surrogate for disease severity in cystic fibrosis. FEV1 was inversely related to serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) (R 2 =0.25, p=0.03) and erythropoietin levels (R 2 =0.56, p <0.001) but was directly related to serum iron level (R 2 =0.34, p=0.006). Iron-deficiency also correlated with higher serum IL-6 levels (\u03c1 = -0.55, p=0.01). Despite its reported accuracy in differentiating anemia of chronic inflammation from iron-deficiency anemia, [2] the soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) level correlated only with serum erythropoietin (R 2 =0.31, p=0.009). Quantification of sputum iron levels for the cohort is forthcoming. This is the first study in cystic fibrosis to explicitly associate lung function and systemic iron deficiency with circulating IL-6. IL-6 causes hypoferritinemia by inducing the production of hepcidin, a regulator of enterocyte iron uptake. [3] The role of hepcidin in the anemia of cystic fibrosis, however, is unclear. Because sTfR levels did not correlate with any hematologic iron parameter, this test may have limited clinical utility in working up anemia among CF patients. Background: There are currently no data in adult cystic fibrosis (CF) patients on the prevalence of hyperinflation and its relation with dyspnea, quality of life and exercise performance in this population. Furthermore, little is known about the functional correlates of hyperinflation in CF.",

Both groups were statistically similar with regard to mean age, gender, prevalence of diabetes, long term oxygen therapy, use of supplementary pancreatic enzymes and lung function at entry into the study. The only difference between the two groups was the use of rhDNase. Use of rhDNase was much greater in the group with improved survival. Significantly more patients in Group 2 took rhDNase regularly with 35% in Group 1 vs. 87% in Group 2 (p<0.001) and using Cox regression analyses, patients who were using rhDNase had a significantly reduced risk of mortality by 41% (p<0.001).

We have in fact underestimated this improvement as some in Group 2 were in the study for a shorter period of time than the patients in Group 1. Many factors may be implicated but it would appear that the regular use of rhDNase, which became widespread in the mid 1990s, is associated with stabilisation of lung function. Further analyses need to be undertaken but it is no longer valid for clinicians to assume that an FEV 1 <30% of the predicted value means that 50% of patients will die within 2 years. Consideration should be given to treatment with rhDNase if this is not already the case. In addition, it is important to note that female patients and those with diabetes might be considered for transplantation at an earlier stage. . Adults with CF are living longer with more complex disease, requiring novel approaches to treatment. Although standard airway clearance techniques (e.g. ACBT, autogenic drainage, oscillating PEP devices) are the foundation of independent daily management, physiotherapists are forced to widen their treatment repertoire as advanced disease challenges our ability to achieve effective airway clearance. The use of mechanical adjuncts in combination with our standard techniques may help to overcome the difficulties faced.",

This necessitated the use of treatment combinations using mechanical adjuncts to optimise airway clearance, prompted by a range of clinical observations. In advanced disease and respiratory failure where symptoms such as fatigue and airway tightness compound active airway clearance techniques, mechanical adjuncts may assist in conserving energy whilst maintaining airway clearance. In patients who are unable to fully participate in physiotherapy and/or continue to deteriorate, mechanical adjuncts offer the ability to continue an airway clearance regime, and the benefits of these devices are worthy of further investigation in a prospective study. 1 ; Gunaratram, C. 2 1.

A value equivalent to 85% of the subject's VO 2 max was calculated and the walking speed for the ESWT was interpolated from a graph by Revill et al. (4) . Three ESWTs were performed and assessed for reliability. During each test the following outcome measures were collected: respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), modified Borg rating of breathlessness (BORG rating), leg fatigue (LF), distance covered, and endurance time.",

Several studies have shown an inferior exercise performance in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) compared with healthy individuals when looking at the data in absolute terms or expressing the measurements relative to body weight. Furthermore, one study employing 31 P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) suggested a disturbed muscle metabolism during isometric quadriceps knee extension exercise to exhaustion in CF. Based on these data, an involvement of skeletal muscle in CF has been hypothesized. The objectives of this study were 1) to assess differences in exercise performance between patients with CF and a control group while using allometric scaling to account for differences in body size, and 2) to assess muscle metabolism by 31 P-MRS acquired during dynamic exercise of the quadriceps femoris muscle.",

Larger samples are required to confirm the prognostic value of the 3MST in adults with CF. Introduction: Exercise testing has become an important tool in the evaluation and care of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Exercise capacity decreases with progression of lung disease, and in severely affected patients with CF supplemental oxygen during exercise, or even for 24 hours may be warranted to avoid oxygen desaturation. In those patients with CF having supplemental oxygen a cardio-pulmonary exercise test (CPX) is difficult to perform. Due to various factors (e.g. deconditioning, peripheral muscle dysfunction) the results of CPX may not be useful to determine training intensity in most of the patients. The aim of the present study was to use a stepramp test (SRT) on a treadmill to determine training intensity and to evaluate a training program for patients with advanced lung disease.",

All patients performed a SRT on a treadmill using a modified Balke protocol. The velocity was continuously 4 km/h during the test. The initial grade was 2.5%, with an increment of 2.5% every 20 sec. The test was stopped when the patients were exhausted. During the test, heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation (O 2 Sat) were recorded. All patients received supplemental oxygen during the STR. After 6-week training program the SRT was repeated. The training program consisted of an interval-training on a treadmill (continuously 4 km/h) with duration of 20 minutes five times/weekly. High intervals of 30 s with 50% of maximal grade were followed by an active recovery of 0% grade. In total 10 periods of high intensity were followed by active recovery. Supplemental oxygen was administered to reach a haemoglobin oxygen saturation of more than 90% during training. Discussion: Most SRT for patients with CF are performed on an electronically braked bicycle. We adapted the SRT to a treadmill. The test was well tolerated by all patients. Most of the patients stopped the test due to muscle fatigue before as well after training. Recommendation of training intensity could be given according to the results of the SRT (50% of max grade) achieved during SRT. A significant training effect was observed after the exercise program of 6-weeks.",

Behavioural intention, defined as how strongly patients intend to do regular CPT in the next three months, was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures included patients' behavioural beliefs, attitude towards behaviour, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control. Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire, view the video, and complete a post-video questionnaire. The questionnaires were developed based on the TPB framework. Data were collected on patient demographics, FEV 1 , self-perceived health, and CPT regimen. Descriptive statistics (mean\u00b1SD) were carried out.

Improvements were seen in patients' attitude towards doing CPT, their belief that positive outcomes will result from doing CPT, and their perception of their capability to do CPT after watching the video. The video stimulated questions regarding CPT which may result in better adherence to CPT. Further analysis with the full cohort is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterised by recurrent bacterial infections of the lungs which eventually cause irreversible lung damage. Inhaled antibiotic therapy in the home environment may postpone or prevent hospital admissions. The increasing use of inhaled antibiotics in combination with inhaled mucolytics, can create a time burden that is often underestimated by those involved in CF care. Furthermore, there is often confusion about the order and timing of inhaled medications around other aspects of CF care.",

As the number and type of inhaled medications become more common, it is important to achieve maximum benefit while ensuring time efficiency. At the time of prescription of inhaled medications it is important to provide education in respect to technique, timing of treatment and hygiene and this needs to be reassessed regularly as additional treatments are added to an individual patients' regimen. Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterised by dehydrated airway secretions that can be difficult to expectorate causing repeated infections, inflammation and scarring of the lungs. Physiotherapists employ a variety of airways clearance techniques (ACT) to aid sputum clearance aiming to maintain or improve lung function and hence slow progression of the disease. No single ACT has been identified in the literature to be more effective than any other or any better than no treatment at all, although Cochrane reviews of the literature comment on the paucity of long-term randomised control trials (Main et al. Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2005; (1):CD002011; Van der Schans et al. Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2000; (2) :CD001401). A previous analysis at this centre in 2007 of ACT versus FEV1 over a one year period concluded that no significant difference in lung function decline existed between any form of ACT or no treatment at all. The study did not however consider the effect of nebulised mucolytics and antibiotics.",

However, in the present study the percussion and vibration group demonstrated much lower baseline FEV1 than any other treatment group. A lower baseline FEV1 may mean more frequent exacerbations and faster decline in lung function. Some treatment groups such as the autogenic drainage (AD) and Acapella groups only had small numbers which may contribute to statistical error. Additionally, adherence was reported by patients and assessed by the physiotherapist but not formally monitored. This may cause inaccuracies associated with self-reporting.",

Further studies with larger cohorts are required before any firm clinical judgements are formed. Recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase) applied to patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), has been shown to improve lung function in shortterm trials, and there is some evidence that the number of pulmonary exacerbations may be reduced. However, its long-term effect on airway inflammation, improvement of airway clearing and hence, the effect on different characteristics of lung function has not yet been clearly assessed. In a retrospective observational study we evaluated the long-term effect of rhDNase on bacterial acquisition (onset of chronic P. aeruginosa infection; OCPAI), the effect on various lung function parameters such as functional residual capacity (FRC pleth ), lung clearance index (LCI), trapped gas (V TG ), specific airway resistance (sR eff ), forced expiratory indices (FEV 1 , FEF 50 ), gas exchange (PaO 2 , PaCO 2 ) and BMI in 170 children (85 males; 85 females) over an observation period ranging from 5 to 18 years of age. When treated, the patients received rhDNase 2.5 mg/day. Kaplan-Meier plots and linear mixed model (LMM) analysis were used to assess differences in OCPAI and drug efficacy on lung function respectively. In 72 patients the event of OCPAI occurred before initiation of rhDNase treatment (50% onset at age 4.9 years). In 75 patients rhDNase was never used (control group with 50% onset at age 7.3 years). OCPAI could be studied in 23 patients ON rhDNase, presenting a later OCPAI (50% onset at age 13.3 years; n.s.). Efficacy of rhDNase treatment was assessed by comparison of the slope 10 years before versus after initiation of treatment. The LCI (degree of ventilation inhomogeneities) was the only parameter demonstrating significant improvement (p=0.024) in patients with mild to moderate lung involvement (FEV 1 < -6 SDS; PaO 2 > 72 mmHg), but not in severely diseased patients. There was no effect on flow limitation (FEV 1 , FEF 50 ), bronchial obstruction (sR eff ), the degree of pulmonary hyperinflation (FRC pleth ), the degree of trapped gas (V TG ), nor on the BMI. Noteworthy, the beneficial effect of rhDNase was significantly more pronounced in younger patients (age < 10 years). Longterm treatment of rhDNase in patients with CF may significantly improve ventilation inhomogeneities, especially in patients with age less than 10 years. Improvement of ventilation inhomogeneities may be an expression of a better clearing of the bronchial tree explaining the delay in OCPAI in CF patients ON rhDNase. No long-term effect could be established on any of other lung function parameters (FRC pleth , V TG , sR eff , FEV 1 , FEF 50 , PaO 2 , BMI). This observational study showing only modest long-term effect of rhDNase on lung function in CF patients raises concerns about cost effectiveness. Objectives: To compare maximum muscle strength and power between children with CF and pancreatic insufficiency (PI) and healthy controls, age 5-to-19-yrs.",

Montreal Children's Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada Rationale: Peak aerobic fitness (VO 2 peak) has been linked to outcome in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. However, this parameter requires expensive equipment and expertise that is not readily available in all centers. Other fitness parameters such as peak anaerobic capacity, power measures such as vertical jump and strength measures such as hand grip may be simpler to deliver in the clinic.

A coordinated systematic model should be utilised to facilitate the process which is stressful for these otherwise terminally ill patients. Denk, O.; Keller, M.; Prante, S.; Gruber, F.; Fuchs, C.; Knoch, M. Aerosol Research Institute, PARI Pharma GmbH, Munich, Germany Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) is a major cause of death after lung transplantation, being treated today with systemic immunosuppressive drugs, e.g. cyclosporin A (CsA). Since systemic immunosuppression is of limited efficacy to prevent or treat BO and since systemic CsA has severe nephrotoxic effects, direct intrapulmonary CsA delivery may result in higher local drug exposure and better effect in association with less systemic side effects. Reports on positive therapeutic effects upon nebulisation of CsA dissolved in propyleneglycol (CsA-PG) indicated that inhaled CsA may be advantageous. Still, treatment compliance to inhaled CsA was poor due to the irritating organic solvent and long nebulisation times of up to 1 hour (FDA Briefing Document for Pulmonary Advisory Committee June 6, 2005). Thus, development was needed for a well-tolerable inhalation formulation in a low, non-toxic nominal dose but high peripheral lung dose (about 10 -28 mg/week) enabling short delivery times. A novel aqueous liposomal cyclosporin A 0.4% (L-CsA) formulation derived from an artificial lung surfactant carrier showed good cell tolerability in a Calu-3 epithelial cell culture model and was non-toxic in rats when L-CsA was given by inhalation for 6 months. Lung deposition in 12 lung transplanted patients was about 40% after inhalation of 10 mg L-CsA via a customized eFlow \u00ae electronic nebulizer and 50% were found in the lung periphery (Behr et al. J Aerosol Med Pulm Drug Deliv 2009; 22:121) . Compared to CsA dissolved in propyleneglycol a sustained release profile could be observed for L-CsA after incubation with human lung cell homogenates. A favourable drug distribution upon inhalation was obtained in a perfused rabbit lung model with a distribution profile pattern after 6 hours as follows: 77.6% in lung homogenates, 16.4% in the bronchoalveolar lavage and 6% in the perfusate. Upon nebulisation no drug was leaking out of the unilamellar liposomes having a size range of about 50 -100 nm. Based on these positive outcomes Orphan Drug Designations were granted for inhaled L-CsA in the USA and Europe. A currently ongoing phase 2b multicenter trial will hopefully prove the efficacy and safety of inhaled L-CsA delivered via an investigational customized eFlow \u00ae electronic nebuliser. It is our hope that detoriation in lung function caused by BO in lung transplanted patients will be reduced and their life expectancy prolonged.",

Thoracic Surgery, H\u00f4pital Erasme, Brussels, Belgium Actuarial survival 10 years after lung transplantation (LTx) is approximately 30% according to the data from the 2008 ISHLT Registry. Published data on lung function and metabolic complications in LTx recipients having survived more than 10 years are, however, scarce. We reviewed these data in our cohort of 318 LTx recipients (n=90 with cystic fibrosis (CF)) transplanted from August 1983 onwards. Thirty-seven patients survived for more than 10 years. The indications for LTx in these patients were CF (n=12), emphysema (n=8), primary pulmonary hypertension (n=5), Eisenmenger's syndrome (n=5), and other (n=7). One of 12 CF long-term survivors died 12 years after LTx (Clostridium difficile colitis, acute renal insufficiency and pulmonary emboli); the other 11 patients are currently alive. There are 8 men and 3 women. They present the following CFTR mutations: deltaF508/deltaF508 (n=4), deltaF508/3849+10kb C/T (n=3), deltaF508/G542X (n=1), deltaF508/--(n=2), unknown (n=1). Their median age is 46 (\u00b1 2.8) years. All 11 patients present exocrine pancreatic insufficiency; the median BMI is 18.4 (\u00b1 1.1). Eight patients have received a heart-lung and 3 a bilateral lung transplant. They are alive 13.9 (\u00b1 2.5) years after transplantation. At the most recent evaluation, median forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second, forced expiratory flow at 25% to 75% of FVC are 88 (\u00b1 18), 83 (\u00b1 24), 83 (\u00b1 35) % of predicted, respectively. One of the 8 CF heart-lung Tx recipients had to undergo heart re-Tx. Nine of 11 patients present treated arterial hypertension. Two patients had to undergo kidney Tx; the median serum creatinine and the median glomerular filtration rate in the remaining 9 patients are 1.5 (\u00b1 0.81) mg/% and 42 (\u00b1 31) mL/'/1.73 m 2 , respectively. Eight of 11 long-term survivors present insulin-requiring diabetes. Additionally, recurrent and/or severe Clostridium colitis has proven to be a cumbersome complication (n = 4). In conclusion, 1) 15-year survival with excellent lung function can be observed in some CF LTx recipients, 2) cardio-vascular and metabolic complications are prominent. Allergy, and Critical Care Division, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; 2. Psychiatry, Psychology, Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; 3. Heart, Lung, and Esophageal Surgery Institute, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; 4. Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, USA Rationale: Lung transplantation (LT) is a viable but suboptimal option for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and end-stage lung disease. Survival in CF after lung transplantation is limited primarily by chronic rejection (BOS) and infections, which contribute to one and five year survival rates of ~80% and 55%, respectively. Induction therapy with lymphodepleting agents has emerged as a strategy to reduce rejection rates, reduce morbidity, and increase survival in solid organ recipients. In particular, induction therapy with alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) has been associated with reduced morbidity and mortality at 6 months after LT. Whether these benefits are maintained, particularly in CF patients with chronic respiratory pathogens, is unknown. We therefore reviewed survival and rejection rates in CF patients who received induction therapy with alemtuzumab at the time of LT at a single, large lung transplant center (UPMC).",

Later more mutations were progressively added to the panel, which now includes 34 mutations. Diagnosis is established, and later confirmed by a sweat test, in homozygous or compound heterozygous neonates. A sweat test is performed also if either one mutation tests positive or if the meconium lactase exceeds a given threshold. As a fail-safe strategy, when IRT at birth is above the 99.9th centile, even if lactase and mutation analysis test negative, a second blood sample is requested: a persistently raised IRT calls for a sweat test.

            "text": "Between January 1993 and December 2008, 838,510 newborns were screened for CF, with an average per year of 52,406. IRT values above the threshold were found in 4,451 neonates (0.53%), of whom 295 had high meconium lactase activity, 352 at least one mutation, 145 both raised meconium lactase and one or two mutations, and 86 persistently raised IRT. Altogether, 878 newborns were sweat tested. CF was diagnosed in 202 newborns. By eliminating meconium lactase testing, we would have missed 3 diagnoses (elevated IRT, -/-mutation analysis, negative lactase). Nine children with CF were missed by the neonatal screening procedure, and were later diagnosed by clinical symptoms (mean age at diagnosis 49.5 months, minimum 2 maximum 139). Of the false-negatives, 8 had IRT values below the cut-off, one had raised IRT but lactase was in range and the genetic analysis wrongly resulted negative. The overall incidence of CF was 1/4,151, which raised to 1/3,973 including false-negatives. Each case was classified as: true positive (TP); false positive (FP); true negative (TN); or false negative (FN). The sensitivity of the program, defined as TP / (TP + FN), was 0.957. The specificity of the program, defined as TN / (TN+FP), was 0.999. The positive predictive value of the test, defined as TP /(TP + FP), was 0.23. The ratio of sweat tests requested to true CF patients was 4.34:1. In Mediterranean populations CFTR mutations are quite diversified, and even specifically designed mutation panels may obtain unsatisfactory detection rates. The protocol we are using allows good sensitivity and specificity. Methods: Infants included in this analysis were identified by CA CF NBS which began in July 2007 and has 4 steps: 1) measuring immunoreac-tive trypsinogen (IRT) levels in all newborn blood spot specimens, 2) specially designed CA (29-40) CFTR mutation panel testing of specimens with high IRT values (\u226562 ng/mL, top 1.5%), 3) CFTR full gene sequence analysis utilizing scanning-sequencing technology of specimens found to have only 1 mutation in Step 2, and 4) referring infants with 2 mutations found during Step 2 (\"Step 2 positives\") or 1 mutation found during Step 2 and 1+ mutation/variant found during Step 3 (\"Step 3 positives\") to CF Care Centers (CFCs) for SC testing and long term follow up unless mutations are in cis. CFCs attempted to repeat [SC] on all infants with initial [SC] \u226459 mEq/L. We analyzed [SC] and diagnoses for all Step 3 positives and stratified the analysis by initial [SC] (\"abnormal\" (\u226560 mEq/L), \"intermediate\" (30-59 mEq/L), and \"normal\" (\u226429 mEq/L)).",

Using ICD-9 diagnosis codes, we estimated the number of hospitalizations per year for pulmonary exacerbations for males and females. Poisson regression models using generalized estimating equations methods included predictors of hospitalization, such as age, % predicted FEV 1 for children and adults, nutritional status (body mass index [BMI] in adults, CDC BMI z score for children), pancreatic status, presence of CF-related diabetes (CFRD) and microbiology. SES was based on neighbourhood income quintiles using postal code information from Census and Statistics Canada data. Rural community size was defined at a population < 10,000. The distance between place of residence and CF centre was calculated as the shortest distance (in km) using longitude and latitude measurements.",

Approximately 37% of CF NBS infants were previously reported to be pancreatic sufficient (PS-CF) at diagnosis. Our aim was to investigate the pancreatic status of infants with a confirmed diagnosis of CF (sweat chloride > 60mmol/L and/or 2 CF-causing mutations) and those with an uncertain diagnosis of CF (sweat chloride 30-60mmol/L; U-CF) who were assessed in the CF clinic at The Hospital for Sick Children in the first few months of life using stool elastase-1 (Monoclonal-ELISA. Schebo Biotech AG) and adjunctive tests (serum Vitamins A and E and serum albumin). Of 14 infants with a confirmed diagnosis of CF through NBS, 10 had stool samples tested for elastase at mean age 42 \u00b1 36 days. Eight of the 10 infants (80%) were pancreatic insufficient (stool elastase <100 \u00b5g/g (1); PI-CF). All infants with CF had lower stool elastase compared with all 5 patients with U-CF. There were significant differences in mean stool elastase between infants with U-CF, PS-CF and PI-CF (Table) . Four PI-CF infants had low serum Vit A levels (<0.6 \u00b5mol/L), while Vitamin E was low in one PI-CF infant (< 5 \u00b5mol/L) and in the normal range for the remaining 9 infants. Serum albumin values tended to be lower in the PI-CF group at 26.9 \u00b1 4.6 vs. 34 \u00b1 4.2 (p = 0.08), and except for 3 patients in the PI group, all were in the normal range. None of the infants with U-CF had low serum Vit A, Vit E, or albumin levels.

Instead, they have an intermediate degree of pancreatic exocrine function, in between those with PI-CF and U-CF. These findings support the role of monitoring PS-CF infants for possible progression to PI. Testing for pancreatic elastase in a timely manner helps to define pancreatic status, and guide treatment for PI. Serum Vitamin E, A or albumin may only be useful if low values are observed. 1.

Changes in respiratory signs and symptoms were associated with significant changes in Physical, Vitality, and Respiratory domains for adults, adolescents, and parents (beta coefficients ranging from -3.04 to -9.90, P values <.05). New symptoms such as cough, wheezing, or IV antibiotic treatment were associated with worsening CFQ-R Respiratory Symptom scores; however, different respiratory symptom patterns emerged across age groups. For children, increased cough was predominant; for adults, changes in cough, crackles, wheeze, and IV antibiotic treatment clustered to predict changes in HRQOL scores. Changes in weight-for-age z-scores were associated with significant changes on the Body Image, Eating Problems, and Weight domains across the groups (beta coefficients ranging from 6.38 to 26.71, P values <.01). Improvements in weight were associated with better perceptions of body image and fewer eating problems.",

Almost half (14, 47%) were college graduates. Sixteen (53%) of sweat tests took place <3 weeks after birth.

Twelve (40%) knew that the gene for CF was present in their or their partner's family. Approximately 75% were initially notified of the NBS result by a pediatrician, and were told about CF and the meaning of a positive NBS for CF at this time. However, 17 (57%) were not given a description of the sweat test. Reported anxiety was a 3.40 (out of 4) at initial notification. Three-quarters spoke to a genetic counselor when scheduling the sweat test. Three did not schedule the sweat test themselves, but of the remaining 27, over 85% received information about CF, the NBS, and the sweat test when scheduling. Their reported anxiety decreased to 2.72 after phone counseling. All but one correctly understood the interpretation of their child's sweat test; however 10 (33%) did not understand if a mutation was found and 9 (30%) did not correctly understand their child's carrier status. Reported anxiety after receiving sweat test results was 1.25. Despite this, 9 (30%) reported thinking about the results once a week or more. The mean score for knowledge of CF was 78%: 100% understood that CF cannot be transmitted by physical contact but less than 1/2 understood that there are no health risks associated with being a carrier. Among 24 mothers who identified their children as carriers or potential carriers, ~90% think that first degree relatives should know that their child is a carrier; but <50% think that other relatives should know, and 3 (13%) do not want other relatives to find out.

The annual prevalence of ABPA (total number of individuals with ongoing disease within the CF population) has decreased slightly year-on-year since its peak in 2003, from 5.96% to 4.29% in 2007, see Table 1 . There was a predominance of males diagnosed during the study period (58.9%) although subgroup analysis demonstrated a significantly higher proportion of females than males in the 5-9 year age group. ABPA was associated with a significantly higher rate of isolation from respiratory specimens of both Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p<0.05) and Aspergillus fumigatus (p<0.01) than those without ABPA. A considerable proportion (24/134; 17.9%) of those diagnosed during the study period went on to have recurrent episodes of ABPA necessitating further treatment.",

Contrary to our clinical impression, our findings suggest that there has been little change in the prevalence of APBA in the CF population over recent years. The observations of a recent trend towards a reducing prevalence and of a female preponderance in early life will require ongoing data collection to confirm. Current antibiotic strategies do not appear to be associated with increased occurrence of ABPA within our regional CF services. 3 ; Cullinan, P. 3 ; Larsen, A. 2 1.

Chronic S. aureus and P. aeruginosa infections were present in 17.3% and 37.7% of patients respectively. B. cepacia was detected in 3.7% in patients at their clinical visit, MRSA in 3.5% and H. influenzae in 7.4%. FEV1 (% predicted) varied between 12.2% and 186.1% (median=73.2%) in patients aged 8 years and older and tended to be higher in younger patients than older patients. Age 8-11yrs median (range) FEV1 (% predicted) = 87% (19.6%-140.8%), 16-19 yrs = 74.4% (15.8%-186.1%), 28-31yrs = 63.7% (12.5%-163.2%), 40+ yrs = 57.8% (13.5%-143.7%).

Among adults, BMI increased with age and ranged between 14.1 and 41.0 (median=21.2) among females, and between 14.9 and 51.1 (median=22.0) among males. Given the ages of patients in the Registry and the mortality distribution of deaths in 2007, it was predicted that half of the current UK CF Registry patients would be expected to live beyond 35.2 years (95% CI: 31.0, 42.6).",

Furthermore, whenever environmental changes happen like in 1987 and 2007, dehydration becomes the commonest presentation. The high frequency of dehydration among infants may contribute to the early suspicion and diagnosis of CF, prior to the onset of symptoms from the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. Considering the global environmental changes, dehydration, as a clinical presentation, will probably be of growing significance in the future. Methods: Starting 16Jul07 all infants born in CA were screened for CF using the CA model which has 4 steps: (1) measuring immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) levels in all newborn blood spot specimens, (2) specially designed CA (29-40) CFTR mutation panel testing of specimens with high IRT values (\u226562 ng/mL, top 1.5%), (3) CFTR full gene sequence analysis utilizing scanning-sequencing technology of specimens found to have only 1 mutation in Step 2, and (4) referring infants with 2 or more mutations/variants to CF Care Centers (CFCs) for sweat chloride (SC) testing and follow up. Infants with only 1 mutation detected are not referred for sweat testing; their mothers are sent a letter describing the infant's carrier status and offered telephone genetic counseling. CFCs are asked to report all newly diagnosed CF cases not referred to them by the screening program (false negatives (FN)).",

For the first full year, CF prevalence was 1 in 6,313. CF cases with 2 mutations identified by Step 2 were significantly younger at treatment initiation than CF cases identified by Step 3 (excluding meconium ileus (MI) cases, median ages: 26 vs. 61 days). Most (94%) non-MI cases identified by Step 2 began treatment at age \u226460 days, while only 44% of cases identified by Step 3 began treatment at age \u226460 days.

Using all IRT assessments from both the IRT and IRT/F508del PT programs, the IRT false-negative rate for U.S. and Canadian laboratories combined and for international laboratories was less than 1% (U.S. and Canada: 0.86%, n=1628 results and international: 0.65% n=3409). Correct clinical assessments based on F508del analysis (IRT/F508del program) were reported 96% of the time from U.S. and Canadian laboratories with a 2% sample failure rate (n=258 assessments) and 84% of the time with a 10% sample failure rate from international participants (n=300 assessments). For the multiple mutation detection program using CF donor blood, U.S. and Canadian participants reported 98% correct assessments (n=609 assessments) and international participants reported 94% correct assessments (n=295). Since each NBS laboratory determines the mutation panel that most closely follows their population, there is a wide variety of test panels in use. Therefore, 7% of U.S. and Canadian assessments and 35% of international assessments were not evaluated because 1 or both mutations were not on the laboratory's test panel. Sample failure occurred 0.6% of the time for U.S. and Canadian participants and 2% of the time for international participants.",

The program uses both immunoreactive trypsinogen and detailed genetic analysis thereby enabling the detection of both novel and less severe variants. Despite the presence of genetic-based diagnosis, guidelines applied by CF Centers call for a diagnosis of CF on the basis of elevated sweat chloride results. The uncertain relationship between genotype and phenotype creates a significant diagnostic and nosologic dilemma for clinicians and families. Thus, the present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that a correlation exists between genotype and phenotype even upon initial presentation. To test this hypothesis, the CF Center at Stanford evaluated 34 infants referred on the basis of the NBS over an 18 month time interval. Median age at first encounter was 43 days (range 14 to 60 days). All infants underwent a standard assessment that included anthropometrics, sweat chloride (SC) testing, and fecal elastase-1 determination. CFTR mutations were categorized according to their functional class, with classes I, II and III considered severe and classes IV, V mild. Ten infants had a severe genotype (SG), fifteen a mild genotype (MG), and nine infants had mutations which were unclassified (UC). Based on the results of first assessment, five infants were dismissed as not at risk for developing CF disease (all weight >50%ile, SC<15 mmol/L and fecal elastase >350). Of the remaining 29, based on fecal elastase, 20 were classified as pancreatic sufficient (PS), 9 insufficient (PI), and 2 are still pending. All but one infant in the SG group were PI, all but one infant in the MG group were PS and all but one infant in the UC group were PS. For the entire cohort, Median Birth weight percentile was 35%ile, with the lowest value observed in the UC group (25%ile vs 37%ile in SG and 46%ile in MG). These 29 infants were assessed for the degree of malnutrition present at the time of first encounter. At the time of first visit a slight drop in weight percentile to the 30%ile (range 1 to 82) had occurred and weight for length was at the 47%ile. Com-pared to birthweight all genotypic groups demonstrated a slight decline in the median weight percentiles from birth . Weightfor-length (WFL) was already less than adequate only for the SG group (30%ile SG, 48%ile UC, 47%ile MG). The SC values for the entire cohort had a median of 54 mmol/L (range 10-127). Median SC for the SG, UC and MG groups were 116, 84 and 40 respectively. By SC values, infants with SC <30 demonstrated higher birth and first encounter weight percentiles than those with borderline (30-60 mmol/L) or high SC. However, their median weight for length was comparable to that of the infants with high SC (20 %ile vs 30%ile) and infants with borderline SC had the highest WFL (63%ile). This data indicate that genotype phenotype predictions are unreliable in this cohort of newborns. We conclude that genotype phenotype correlations are not absolute in the NBS population. Further, a genetic based diagnosis allows for greater sensitivity in the detection of infants early in the development of nutritional deficiencies regardless of what would be predicted from other parameters such as SC or pancreatic status. Objective: Sweat chloride (SC) testing remains the gold standard diagnostic test for cystic fibrosis (CF) and is the last step in all CF newborn screening (NBS) programs. As a result, the performance and reliability of SC testing impacts the effectiveness of all CF NBS programs. We evaluated SC testing performance and [SC] by CFTR mutation class among infants identified by CF NBS in California (CA).",

The \"fail-safe\" method of the Ultrahigh IRT in the IRT/DNA model is most likely unnecessary if the correct DNA CFTR panel is selected, eliminating the report to the CF centers of the initial blood samples from the NICUs. This most likely will not decrease the sensitivity for diagnosing patients with CF in the NBS. Results: There were 6 Centers in the LOW group, and the mean open case rate was 4.7% (range=1.9-8.4%). There were 6 Centers in the HIGH group, with a mean open case rate of 17.7% (range=12.5-21.6%). The results of the survey are summarized in the Table. More primary care practitioner (PCP) involvement, and upstate location were significantly associated with LOW centers. LOW centers also had more FTE devoted to NBS per 100 referrals, more hospital support for NBS, and a lower percentage of unknown PCP, although these differences were not statistically significant compared to HIGH centers.

On admission, patients and families were provided with an education packet detailing the goals of the program, and invited to participate. They were asked to sign a contract stating they understood the program and would support its activities. The core nurse met with the family to discuss the program and develop a schedule of all activities, and then communicated the schedule to the interdisciplinary team. Patients were given tokens as incentive for (1) on time wake-up and availability for morning assessments and meds; (2) consuming all meals and dietary supplements; and (3) observing nighttime curfew. They also received tokens from other disciplines for participating with airway clearance therapies, exercise, and calorie counts. We monitored program effectiveness and acceptance by surveying patients at discharge, and adjusted our approach based on this input.",

We plan to apply the program to all admissions, and begin a new phase involving the identification and remediation of gaps in CF knowledge among patients and families. Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease associated with an accumulation of tenacious mucous causing airway obstruction. Chest physiotherapy (CPT) facilitates the removal of these secretions. Due to the chronic nature of the disease and the labor-intensive therapy, non-adherence to CPT is well documented in the literature. Patients' knowledge and participation in regular CPT may be increased with education and recommendations provided by the CF physiotherapist.",

Two full-time physiotherapists are responsible for a 15 bed inpatient respirology unit in addition to the ambulatory clinics. Outpatient physiotherapy consultations are provided on an asneeded basis. Patients requiring physiotherapy services were traditionally identified during clinic by the CF nurse who documents the type of physiotherapy used, duration, and frequency. However, this process was not standardized and physiotherapists had no advance notice of outpatient consultations. Thus, criteria for \"adequate\" CPT were established by the physiotherapists based on the frequency and duration of patients' CPT regimen. Patients were then categorized into \"high,\" \"moderate,\" and \"low\" priority for physiotherapy consultation using a standard algorithm during the weekly chart review meeting. Patients identified as \"high\" priority were flagged and highlighted on the clinic list prior to their next appointment. Our shortterm goal was to provide outpatient physiotherapy consultations to 100% of individuals identified as \"high\" priority and the long-term goal is to track the proportion of patients doing \"adequate\" physiotherapy.",

Although many factors affect growth, aggressive nutritional management may lead to improved linear growth, ultimately resulting in improved lung function and survival for CF patients. Beginning in mid-2006 the Lewis H.

Although the center median BMI percentile increased following consistent use of the NAS (Phillips et al. Pediatr Pulmonol 2008;S31:408), it was unclear if patients were making gains in linear growth.

As we become more proficient at this process, the focus will shift from a process measure to how well patients are meeting their goals or moving toward readiness to set goals. Ultimately, we will observe and measure improvement in health and quality of life outcomes. The Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Foundation published evidence-based recommendations for nutrition goals in 2005 stating that a BMI > 50% is associated with lower risk of morbidity and mortality. Our CF Center Quality Improvement efforts focusing on improving nutrition outcomes began in 2002. The initial focus was to classify each patient's nutritional status at every encounter and address barriers to achieving desired BMI. This systematic approach led to improvements in our Center's median BMI percentile from 33.2% in 2002 to 52.4% in 2008. Encouraged by these results, the team was eager to take the next steps. We enhanced our algorithm that has become our center's Nutrition Guideline, created a tool to track interventions over time (Nutrition Tracker), and increased the productivity of our weekly patient care planning meeting (Chart Conference).",

A key component of the Nutrition Guideline is assessing the patient's actual weight gain since their last encounter compared to their monthly weight goal. We discovered our patients and families were often unaware of their short-term and long-term weight goals. Together with the patient and family, we now set individualized monthly weight goals based on age, gender and catch-up needs for the patient.

A magnetic board divided into the 4 nutrition categories was displayed in the team conference area. Each patient was assigned a magnet color coded to one of three clinic physicians. The magnet was moved to correspond with the assigned nutrition category at each visit. The board was used as a visual prompt to monitor work in progress. A nutritional intervention checklist was developed and used to assess those At Risk or Urgent Need. The checklist identifies the current nutrition regimen and tracked interventions previously tried, on-going, and goals. Interventions included methods to maximize intake, absorption and testing for other medical conditions. Patients and families collaborated with team members on individualized goals and action plans.

We devised a plan to train staff respiratory care practitioners (RCPs) to adhere to a standard protocol for use of Acapella, huff cough, high frequency chest wall oscillation, and autogenic drainage, beginning with the first two. RCPs worked one-on-one with the staff educator to learn a standardized approach to ACT and were asked to demonstrate skills using a standard protocol checklist; they will be re-evaluated yearly. A pilot program was then developed for application to patients 10-19 years old and physically able to perform their chosen ACT as well as huff cough. On admission, patients worked with nursing to set a daily schedule for ACT and other activities, and chose, in collaboration with the RCP, which form of ACT they preferred. They were then evaluated and educated on proper ACT technique. Members of the healthcare team, including physicians, were asked not to disturb the patient when ACT was being performed. Following the correct performance of each treatment per standard protocol, patients were entitled to receive a token. These tokens were exchanged for prizes at discharge.",

Background: Physical activity promotes airway clearance and increases bone density, strength and endurance as well as overall life expectancy for people with cystic fibrosis (CF) [1] . As part of an improvement project led by a multidisciplinary steering committee (that included parents) whose intent was to standardize hospital treatment of pulmonary exacerbations and make it more efficient and productive, we developed an individualized exercise program for each patient. While previously each CF patient received physical therapy (PT) no more than 3 times/week, under the new program each patient received guided PT 5 times/week and was given an individualized exercise program based on their initial evaluations. A token incentive program was introduced to promote compliance with all treatments included in their schedules. We sought to measure the benefit of this program on patients' physical wellness by comparing aerobic endurance on admission and at the end of seven physical therapy treatments.",

Additionally a benefit on halting rate of decline of lung function and improving exercise ability is suggested. Further research is planned to prospectively evaluate the OPI scheme, with detailed cost-benefit analyses, and a wider range of outcome measures including exercise capacity and quality of life. Airway clearance, an essential element for maintaining and improving the lung health of people with cystic fibrosis (CF), is a mainstay of pulmonary care. To improve the lung health of our patients through the use of age-appropriate airway clearance techniques, our CF Center embarked on a quality improvement (QI) initiative. The specific aim was to increase the number of patients receiving formal airway clearance education. In particular, our plan was to educate 25% of all patients seen in the CF Center from 4-1-08 to 7-1-08 and 100% of all patients seen from 4-1-08 to 3-31-09. To that end, a multidisciplinary team, including a parent representative, was convened and developed an airway clearance training protocol, a patient incentive plan, patient educational materials and an airway clearance questionnaire. Additionally to assure that the entire CF team provided uniform education and a consistent message, three airway clearance training sessions were scheduled for the entire CF team. Checklists for each form of airway clearance were developed and an emphasis was placed on the importance of daily exercise. Baseline adherence, obstacles to therapy, lung function measures and BMI were performed prior to instituting the airway clearance project and will be reevaluated at the end of the study period. From 4/1/07 to 3/31/08, only 15% of pediatric patients had documentation of having received airway clearance teaching (ACT). In contrast, a year after instituting the project, 89% of patients had documentation of having received ACT. The most common form of airway clearance utilized by our patients was high frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO), with 33 patients (51%) using HFCWO exclusively. A significant number of patients report that they utilize multiple airway clearance modalities (n=19, 29%). Lastly, a small number of patients report using the Acapella (n=6, 9%), the manual percussor (n=3, 5%), or CPT (n=1, 2%) exclusively. Three (5%) patients did not respond to this question. With regard to adherence twelve (18%) individuals report not having enough time during the day between work and school as an obstacle to airway clearance. An additional four patients (6%) did not feel airway clearance worked or did not think they needed it when they felt well. There were 3 subjects (5%) who found airway clearance embarrassing. Lastly, 21 respondents (32%) listed \"other\" reasons for not performing airway clearance as prescribed. The remaining study parameters including FEV1 and BMI, will be evaluated at the 12 month mark for each patient. The interim results from this project indicate that a standardized team approach to airway clearance training can increase the number of patients who receive airway clearance training. Lessons learned from this QI initiative include the facts that pre-planning is necessary, teamwork is important, communication is vital, and family involvement is critical. Armoni, S.; Rony, R.Y.; Cohen-Cymberknoh, M.; Shoseyov, D.; Pugatsch, T.; Kerem, E. CF Center, Hadassah Medical Center Mount Scopus, Jerusalem, Israel Background: Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) need attention, financial resources and energy for their daily, time-consuming therapies to maintain an optimal health status. Our goal as healthcare providers (HP) is to offer the best care. This results in a heavy burden for the patients which impairs the quality of life (QoL) and may lead to poor adherence. The ultimate goal should be to propose a true balance between quality of care (QoC) and QoL. The QoC in CF is measured by outcome variables that include morbidity, mortality, FEV 1 and BMI. Over the last decade, the patient's perspective on QoL was included as well. Patients grade the effect of the disease on their daily life, and include their subjective assessment of respiratory status, physical activity, eating, body image, social status and the emotional effects of CF.",

Background: Since 1998, high frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) therapy has been an integral part of the treatment program at our Cystic Fibrosis Center's pediatric and adult programs, often beginning at 2 years of age. Our usual recommendation is that HFCWO be used once or twice daily for 20-30 minutes each time. Our instructions are to increase the oscillation frequency in 1 Hz increments from 10 to 14 Hz with a \"huff\" cough between each frequency change, and at the end of the session. Patients are told that a \"huff\" cough involves a maneuver similar to blowing one's breath in order to cause \"steam\" to appear on a mirror. At each clinic visit, patients or their parents are asked to report the hours of HFCWO as recorded on the machine. Documented adherence is rewarded with a $10 gift card. Once a year, our respiratory therapists review all respiratory treatments and modalities with patients and/or parents. In order to assess the efficacy of our educational efforts relating to the rate of adherence to HFCWO therapy, a survey was administered by our respiratory therapists.",

            "text": "Our stated goals for HFCWO therapy have not been met despite significant efforts. We speculate that the reasons for this short-coming include that when HFCWO is initiated at 2 years of age, it cannot be expected for toddlers to cough voluntarily. When these patients became older, it appears that we may not have conveyed adequately the importance of coughing, or that the parents and patients had difficulty changing their physiotherapy routine. Based on the survey results, we have begun to explain to our patients and their parents that without coughing, HFCWO is analogous to sweeping the floor without picking up the debris, which allows it to rescatter on the floor. After hearing this analogy, a number of our patients have reported that their HFCWO now helps them to have a productive cough. Further, we are creating laminated cards detailing the desired procedure and importance of HFCWO in addition to other respiratory procedural techniques. We plan to distribute this information to all of our patients, and to review it with them at each quarterly visit to our Center. The CF MT focuses on high impact therapies: Pulmozyme \u00ae , Tobi\u2122, Hypertonic Saline, and Azithromycin. An additional area of focus of the MT was to evaluate the use of leukotriene receptor antagonists and inhaled corticosteroids. Minimum criteria for anti-inflammatory use was 12% reversibility in FEV1 or clinical wheezing in the prior year. Ninety-one unique patients between 6 and 16 years of age had at least one MT encounter in each of the years: 2006, 2007, and 2008 and were evaluated. The 2006 values were considered baseline values. Lung function and nutritional parameters were compared between the baseline MT and 2007 and 2008. Median FEV1 per year was calculated using the median of the mean of the best quarterly values. BMI percentile was calculated as the median of the mean of best quarterly BMI%.",

There was also high compliance but slightly more variability with azithromycin, hypertonic saline, and anti-inflammatory therapy. Defining eligibility for therapies can become challenging and tends to vary over time. Despite high compliance with medications as demonstrated with the MT, lung function and nutritional status declined slightly in this population over time. These data do not reflect the individual changes in clinical care made directly as a result of the MT. We demonstrated a high level of compliance with CF medication prescription could be achieved. The MT often triggers a change in medication regimens to assure compliance. We speculate a modification of the tracker with increased emphasis on microbiology and lung function trending will result in better preservation of clinical status over time.",

Overall, the use of megestrol was associated with an improvement in nutritional status and lung function. To standardize the use of megestrol, our care center has developed an appetite stimulant protocol, which is incorporated in a new outpatient nutrition pathway. Per the protocol, the starting dose of megestrol is 5mg/kg/day. A weight goal for each patient is established, and if the weight goal is met, megestrol is discontinued. If megestrol is continued, a morning cortisol level and blood glucose level are checked every 6 months. The initial focus of our quality improvement program was to improve the nutritional status of our patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Initially we placed each patient into a nutritional category, which is now tracked and adjusted at each visit, then assuring that every patient left clinic with a plan laid out for nutrition until the next visit. The next step was to standardize our approach and assure that we are not missing any important issues for those that are not at goal. We developed a nutrition action plan and as a team worked our way through a preset plan for all those not at goal nutritional status. We have tracked results both for our interventions and for BMI of all our patients. Categorization is reliably done for 95-100% of all patients at each visit, and, despite a large workload associated with every patient at every visit, we have placed written nutritional action plans in the hands of approximately 95% of all patients seen, at each visit. We feel that these numbers represent excellent compliance by our staff. We have not yet begun tracking use of the intervention checklist, but feel that this will be the hardest to both implement and track.",

Nursing, LeBonheur Children's Medical Center, Memphis, TN, USA The aim of this project was to improve our sweat collection technique so that we achieve our goal of less than a 5% \"quantity not sufficient\" (QNS) rate, a requirement for maintaining accreditation with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the College of American Pathologists. A multidisciplinary improvement team focused on recognizing issues that could potentiate the collection of an insufficient sweat sample during the preparation, stimulation, and collection phases of pilocarpine iontophoresis. The project scope covered all ages undergoing sweat chloride testing but did not include the analysis phase. To decrease insufficient samples, the team utilized Six Sigma/LEAN process tools to evaluate and control the collection process. The DMAIC process, which includes the following steps, was used: Define (purpose of project), Measure (collect and summarize data), Analyze (determine the causes of variation), Improve (determine best solution to minimize variation and reduce defects in the process), and Control (assure improvements are sustained). After defining project goals and collecting baseline data, process flow and fishbone diagrams helped delineate variations in technique during the sweat collection process. A detailed analysis of each step of the process was reviewed, evaluated for variation, and standardized. Opportunities for improvement were identified, including a change in filter paper size and a different method of sealing the stimulated area to minimize evaporation. Staff education was performed, and awareness of insufficient sweat samples was raised through posting compliance, one-on-one meetings with staff to provide feed back concerning individual performance, and celebrations for the staff when milestones were achieved. Education was developed for parents with the assistance of the Patient and Parent Advisory Council regarding patient preparation prior to collection. To sustain these changes, a control plan was implemented to assure continued success. The overall QNS rate fell from 6.92 per 100 patients in 2008 to 2.47 after the test of change was initiated, a 64% reduction. Ultimately, we expect to see a statistically significant improvement as our sample size increases. registry data, our median BMI was less than the national average in our pediatric population. Therefore, we implemented several specific change ideas between April and June of 2008: 1) developed a written communication tool for patients and families about their nutritional and pulmonary plan of care as well as written goals for weight and pulmonary function; 2) created an Electronic Medical Record (EMR)-based nutrition, pulmonary and therapy summary tool for pre-clinic screening; the EMR screen includes BMI percentile, FEV1, sputum cultures, diabetes and DEXA screening dates, as well as pulmonary therapies (DNase, hypertonic saline, azithromycin, inhaled antibiotics); 3) implemented a new process to ensure 100% of patients complete yearly diabetes screening beginning at age 13 by obtaining 2-hour post Glucola glucose levels during annual clinic visits; 4) established a process for the dietitian to prioritize contact time for patients with BMI < 50th percentile; 5) developed and distributed a questionnaire to assess adolescent CF care knowledge, permitting us to provide targeted education in a monthly STAR (Starting Transition to Adult Responsibility) adolescent clinic. We assess our patient and family involvement at a level 3 during this quality improvement (QI) process.",

Maintaining enthusiasm for improvement after the end of the collaborative has required continued regular QI meetings, sharing improvement data with patients and families at education day and patient and parent advisory board meetings, and incorporation of our aims into routine clinic practice. Introduction: Certain behaviors associated with feeding and mealtimes can become a barrier to achieving adequate energy intake and optimal nutri-tion for young children with cystic fibrosis (CF). Studies have demonstrated that nutrition counseling and interventions are most effective when provided at a younger age. The Behavioral Pediatrics Feeding Assessment Scale (BPFAS) has been used to identify behaviors associated with inadequate nutritional intake (1) . At our center, a nutrition recovery protocol (NRP) was created for patients who have suboptimal nutrition status (SNS), defined as wt/lg% or BMI% <50. A specialized clinic, staffed by a nurse practitioner, RN, RD, and licensed counselor (LC), was developed for patients with SNS and/or behavioral issues affecting nutrition as identified by the care team or parent. This Nutrition Clinic (NC) was specifically designed to address behavioral issues and co-morbidities, such as sinus disease or medication interactions, that impact nutrition. The purpose of NC was to improve the nutrition status of patients with SNS by providing focused clinical nutrition interventions and incorporating a counselor to address parent and child behaviors as a unique intervention.",

More aggressive recruitment to the NC is planned for patients with consistent SNS. Background: Many factors contribute to poor weight gain in cystic fibrosis (CF). The presence of poorly controlled CF-related diabetes (CFRD) is often associated with weight loss or difficulty gaining weight. Lack of education and inadequate monitoring increase the risk of poor glycemic control.

The second stage of this project involved developing a diabetic education program and assessing the frequency of diabetic monitoring using hemoglobin A1C. A diabetic education checklist was created. All CFRD patients attending the outpatient clin-ic were identified and diabetic education was given by the CF nurse practitioner/dietitian using the checklist. The proportion of patients who received diabetes education at each clinic was tracked. Standard of care at our centre involves monitoring A1C in patients with CFRD every 3-4 months. We began tracking A1C measurements and reasons for inadequate monitoring of A1C were recorded. Strategies were developed in order to improve the frequency of monitoring.",

Post-transplant patients and those lost to follow-up are at highest risk for inadequate monitoring. Strategies to target these two groups are being developed because of this QI initiative. Optimal nutritional status is a target quality improvement goal for our pediatric cystic fibrosis (CF) center, serving approximately 225 infants, children, and adolescents. The nutritional status of children with CF hinges on the ability of parents to effectively manage dietary issues associated with CF. Previous studies at this center determined that parents' knowledge and confidence in nutrition-related skills were lower than in other components of CF care. We hypothesized that empowerment of parents with CF nutrition knowledge results in improved nutrition status for their children. This participative research project aimed to identify parents' perceived needs for CF nutrition information and their preferences for receiving the needed information. The local CF Parent Advisory Board (CFPAB) collaborated with this research project through feedback at CFPAB meetings and administration of weekly email correspondence with parents.",

Introduction: Depletion of whole body sodium (Na) has been associated with poor growth in animal studies as well as in infants. Infants with cystic fibrosis (CF) have excessive Na and chloride loss through their sweat. Poor growth in infants with CF is associated with poor lung function later in life. Infants with CF are given Na supplements to prevent electrolyte disturbances and poor growth. However, the assessment of adequate supplementation is difficult, as Na depletion occurs before hyponatremia is apparent. Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) has been used to measure sodium sufficiency, but it requires blood collection. Urinary Na:creatinine (UNa:Cr) ratio only requires a spot urine collection and correlates well with FENa (estimated normal range of FENa 0.5-1.5 corresponds to UNa:Cr 17-52). This study sought to obtain values of UNa:Cr ratio in healthy infants, to study their sodium intake, and to create reference ranges to guide sodium supplementation for infants with CF.",

Introduction: Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR) controls approximately 80% of gastrointestinal (GI) tract pH. Inadequate proximal small bowel gastric acid neutralization may interfere with pancreatic enzyme activity. Pancreatic enzyme products that are enteric-coated rely on exposure to pH>5.5 or 6 for 10-45 minutes to dissolve and release active enzymes. The SmartPill\u2122 GI Monitoring System (Smart-Pill Corporation; Buffalo, New York) is an ambulatory wireless motility capsule (WMC) that measures pH, pressure and temperature of the GI tract and records the data on a receiver worn by the subject. We aimed to describe the gastrointestinal pH profile (GpHP) in patents with CF; to compare the GpHP of patients with CF to those without CF; and to determine if the GpHP of patients with CF is reproducible when measured at two points in time approximately one to two months apart. We hypothesize that time to neutralize gastric acid and sustain physiologic small bowel pH in CF subjects will be longer compared controls. Initial results are presented here.",

The first two hours of small bowel pH (5 second intervals) were analyzed and plotted for each subject. Identification of gastric emptying was indicated by an abrupt rise in pH of 3 or more units. The elapsed time from gastric emptying until a sustained (15 minutes) target pH above 5.5 and 6 was quantified using predicted values from the fitted local regressions.

Background: Low serum levels of linoleic acid (LA) in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients have been attributed to malabsorption of fatty acids and an essential fatty acid deficiency.

This increased AA led to elevated downstream proinflammatory mediators and worsening lung inflammation. A high LA diet (6-12% of total calories) is the current recommendation for CF patients.

Shown in the table is the AA ratio and AA/LA ratio which compares these fatty acids measured on the high LA diet versus the low LA diet for each subject with increasing values reflecting increased AA production. The AA ratios in nasal epithelial and mononuclear cells were greatest in CF subjects compared to HT and HC subjects. In contrast, serum did not show any changes in the AA ratios. A greater fold increase was seen in the AA/LA ratios in CF subjects, consistent with LA levels not significantly increasing in CF subjects due to its enhanced conversion to AA.

CFTR is located on the apical membrane of BECs and represents a pathway for Clefflux. However, the findings that i) only 20% of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) (and non-functioning/absent CFTR on BECs) develop liver disease, and ii) Ca 2+ -activated secretion is 2 to 3-fold greater than that mediated by increases in cAMP via CFTR, suggest that alternate Clsecretory pathways exist in BECs and are important mediators of bile formation. However, the molecular identity of the Ca 2+ -activated Clchannel in biliary epithelium has not been defined. TMEM16A is a newly identified protein capable of transporting Clin other epithelium.

Currents had a reversal potential at 0 mV (ECl=0) and mild outward rectification. UTP-stimulated currents were significantly inhibited by TMEM16A siRNA in both human (2.0\u00b10.7 pA/pF) and mouse (15.5\u00b13.2 pA/pF) BECs, but unaffected by mock transfection. In polarized NRC, UTP increased Isc (\u2206+24 \u00b1 3 \u00b5A from basal) which was inhibited by the Ca 2+ -activated Clchannel blocker, niflumic acid (\u2206-16 \u00b1 5 \u00b5A from basal), and increased by the TMEM16A potentiator IL-4 (\u2206+35 \u00b1 6 \u00b5A). Together these results demonstrate that TMEM16A is functionally present in BECs and contributes to Ca 2+ -activated Clsecretion in response to extracellular nucleotides. These studies represent the first molecular identification of an alternate, non-CFTR, Clchannel in the liver and therefore may be a powerful target to modulate bile formation in the treatment of liver disorders such as cystic fibrosis. *Studies supported by the CFF (FER-ANC08G0).

Cystic Fibrosis Centre, UZ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium Background: Although bleeding from oesophageal varices is regarded as the main complication of portal hypertension (PH) due to cystic fibrosis (CF) related liver disease, increasing splenic enlargement often causes earlier concern. When the spleen becomes voluminous it provokes abdominal discomfort, appetite loss by gastric compression and hypersplenism with worrying thrombocytopenia and anemia. In general it begins within a few years after the occurrence of liver fibrosis (LF) and can rapidly progress as no treatment is available to stop it. Eventually splenectomy with surgical shunting can be performed but this procedure has serious risks, especially in those under 10 years. For all these reasons we investigated the potential of preventive TIPSS, before variceal bleeding, in 5 cf patients under 10y. after the early detection of PH.",

When the abnormalities increased over the following years TIPSS was installed after 1.3 -4.5y (M 2.5y) in an attempt to arrest further progression of PH. Follow up during the first six months after the procedure showed no improvement of established abnormalities like spleen enlargement or hypersplenic activity. On the other hand however deterioration was neither noted in any patient. This suggests that TIPSS can at least in the first six months after its installation, stabilise the effects of PH on the spleen. It can thus be of prophylactic value if applied soon after the detection of progressive LF, before the development of negative consequences of PH. It is however worrisome that it caused a persistent deterioration of biochemical markers for hepatic synthetic function in all patients. No other side effects were noted.",

Further work needs to be done to establish the most appropriate way of managing this unpleasant complication of CF which occurs with increasing frequency in a subgroup of adult people with CF as they become older. Background: A strong association exists between CFTR genotype and exocrine pancreatic phenotype, with mild mutations conferring pancreatic sufficiency in a dominant fashion. Pancreatitis occurs in approximately 15% of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with pancreatic sufficiency (CFPS-PANC) and in a subset of patients who carry CFTR mutations but do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for CF (CFTR-related pancreatitis; CFTR-PANC). In our experience, patients with pancreatic insufficiency do not develop pancreatitis. Our aim was to evaluate the association between severity of CFTR mutations and the development of pancreatitis by comparing patients with CFTR-PANC, pancreatic sufficient CF with pancreatitis (CFPS-PANC) and without pancreatitis (CFPS-NOPANC).",

            "text": "*cost on 22nd April 2009 and VAT included. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride channel located on the apical side of epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal tract. CFTR mutations cause cystic fibrosis (CF), a disease characterized by recurrent pulmonary infections, pancreatic insufficiency, intestinal malabsorption and steatorrhea. Remarkable benefits resulting from exogenous pancreatic supplementation have contributed to the continual improvement of the quality of life of CF patients. However, despite these significant steps forward, fat malabsorption remains a persistent feature in CF patients. It has been previously shown that these patients exhibited abnormalities in the intra-enterocyte lipid processing. Studies aimed at increasing our understanding of the intestinal handling of macro-and micronutrients in CF are multiple although none of them has specifically addressed the direct implication of CFTR in lipid absorption and metabolism by intestinal cells. We carried out studies aimed at investigating the role of CFTR in intestinal synthesis, lipid transport and secretion using Caco-2/15 cell line.Using shRNAi, CFTR knockdown in Caco-2/15 cells resulted in the reduction of gene (70%) and protein (50%) expression. CFTR invalidation led to a significant increase in lipid synthesis and secretion, which was mainly attributed to raised levels of phospholipids, triglycerides (TG) and cholesteryl ester. In line with the augmented level of TG, an induction was noted in the activity of monoacylglycerol and diacylglycerol acyltransferase. Analysis of lipoprotein metabolism showed an enhanced secretion of TG-rich lipoproteins, as well as low-and high-density lipoproteins, including most of their apolipoproteins. Accordingly, the activity of microsomal transfer protein, a key protein in lipoprotein assembly, was elevated. Moreover, the total amount of fatty acids (FA), especially of saturated FA, was significantly higher in cells with CFTR knockdown, confirming the magnitude of lipid absorption. On the other hand, the expression of liver-fatty acid binding protein, a cytosolic FA binding protein, was strongly induced following CFTR knockdown while phosphorylation of acetylCoA carboxylase was significantly reduced, thereby allowing more lipogenesis to occur. Finally, investigation of cholesterol (CHOL) metabolism revealed that CFTR knockdown had no impact on [ 14 C]-CHOL uptake by the apical membrane of Caco-2/15 cells and on the level of proteins involved in CHOL influx [Scavenger Receptor Class B Type I and Niemann-Pick C1 like 1] and efflux [ATP-binding cassette G8)]. Overall, these data demonstrate that the reduction in CFTR expression alters intestinal FA metabolism and lipid transport in intestinal absorptive cells. Our findings may suggest that CFTR defects are not directly responsible for the abnormal intracellular phase of lipid transport in CF and that other confounding factors (essential FA deficiency, intraduodenal acidification) might explain the abnormal intra-enterocyte events contributing to fat malabsorption in CF patients. Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA; 5. Akron Children's Hospital, Akron, OH, USA; 6. American Family Children's Hospital, Madison, WI, USA; 7. Texas Children's, Houston, TX, USA Background: Up to 90% of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients have exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, resulting in poor absorption of nutrients including fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. There is also evidence that CF patients who are pancreatic sufficient may have increased vitamin requirements. Research is constantly emerging on the role of vitamin D in pulmonary health and the roles of vitamins A, D, and K in bone health. A line of CFspecific multivitamins (SourceCF) was designed for CF patients and provides a range of formulations for all ages. In recent years, new data have been published that provide evidence that vitamin formulations could be further optimized.",

Vitamin D insufficiency is common in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Recent studies have demonstrated that vitamin D may be important for immune system by increasing production of cathelicidin, a potent antimicrobial peptide with activity against bacteria. Thus, rapid correction of vitamin D status may be important in CF patients admitted for acute respiratory exacerbation. The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of a single large dose of vitamin D 3 in CF patients during a hospitalization for an acute respiratory exacerbation. Inclusion criteria include CF patient admitted for respiratory exacerbation and age >18. Exclusion criteria include current therapy with high dose vitamin D (>2000 IU QD) or an admission for serious terminal illness. The study was approved by the Emory IRB. Subjects were randomized in blocks of 6 to either 250,000 IU of vitamin D 3 or placebo given orally as a single dose within 48 hours of admission. Blood levels for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) were drawn at randomization and at the time of hospital discharge.

By eliminating these agents and decreasing pill burden, EUR-1008 may allow for improved enzyme regimen compliance, resulting in better overall nutritional status for CF patients with EPI. These findings need to be confirmed in clinical studies. Cystic fibrosis (CF) has been associated with abnormalities in the lipid metabolism specifically with reduced levels of fatty acids from the omega-3 family such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and elevated concentrations of omega-6 fatty acids such as arachidonic acid (AA). We have found these abnormalities in our CF mouse model (C57BL/6J-Cftr m1Unc ) and in patients with CF. Recently, we have described in CF mice and patients defective levels of some species of ceramides. We also found the lipid abnormalities to be correctable by treatment with fenretinide, , a semi-synthetic retinoid. To determine the source of this lipid imbalance and to elucidate the mechanism of fenretinide's effects on fatty acids, we proceeded to determine whether the fatty acid imbalance depended on CFTR and whether various cell types would respond to the drug. CFBE cells demonstrated similar fatty acid abnormalities as seen in CF mice and patients. These aberrant fatty acid profiles were corrected by the transfection of wild-type CFTR, indicating that the fatty acid abnormalities are linked to the primary gene defect. All cells, transfected and untransfected, were treated with fenretinide. Both groups displayed an increase in DHA and ceramide, and decreased AA following drug treatment however the greatest effects were found in untransfected cells.",

Following treatment with fenretinide, DHA and ceramide increased (p = 0.0028 and p < 0.0001, respectively) and AA decreased significantly (p < 0.0001). These results indicate for the first time that fenretinide can act on a systemic level in CF patients. Interestingly, bone marrow macrophages from our CF mouse model also displayed similar fatty acid abnormalities (low DHA, high AA levels and low levels of ceramides) which were improved following treatment with feneretinide. We quantified the levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation pre-and post-stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). As expected LPS stimulation increased the levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Interestingly, when cells were treated with fenretinide, ERK1/2 phosphorylation was reduced to basal levels even in the cells treated with LPS. These results demonstrate an innate augmentation in ERK1/2 phosphorylation most likely linked to the aberrant fatty acid metabolism in CF cells. The majority of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients have exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), requiring supplementation with pancreatic enzyme products (PEPs). EUR-1008 is a novel, enteric-coated, zero-overfill PEP. Very young children and some adults have difficulty swallowing whole capsules. The ability to open capsules and disperse the contents onto foods is an important option for these patients; however, there are no published data on the effect of dispersing on the efficacy of PEPs. In order to examine whether dispersing affects the efficacy of EUR-1008, an exploratory analysis of patients administered EUR-1008 by dispersion of capsule contents onto foods vs those receiving it by capsule was performed.",

For these infants, feeding advice is required and, if the infant is pancreatic insufficient (PI), pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) prescribed. The choice of feeding regimen and of pancreatic enzyme preparation can be difficult. Although there is a body of evidence to support the use of breast feeding in non-CF infants, it is not universally accepted that this is sufficient for CF PI infants. If powdered enzyme preparations are used, this may lead to excoriation of mother's nipples and of the infant's lips and mouth resulting in early abandonment of breast feeding and change to use of infant formulas. Enteric coated (EC) enzyme preparations can prevent these problems, but there is little evidence to guide dosage in this age group and to confirm that breast-fed CF infants on EC PERT exhibit satisfactory nutrition and growth.",

These phenotypes are largely attributed to malnutrition resulting from the early loss of exocrine pancreatic function, leading to nutrient malabsorbtion that affects growth and development. However, aggressive nutritional therapy, even at very early ages, does not fully restore the BMI of patients. Even with the best of nutritional care, patients have short stature and low BMI.

The changes of those compartments are controlled by the metabolic fluxes, i.e. rates of synthesis and degradation of lipids and proteins. CF mice (null and \u2206F508) exhibit similar growth retardation as patients, but without pancreatic insufficiency or apparent malabsorption, providing a model to study the rates of metabolic fluxes that \"set\" the growth retardation phenotype. We found no difference in fatty acid absorption by comparing fatty acid profiles from feces of WT and CF -/mice relative to that of their chow. WT and CF profiles of fecal fatty acids looked virtually identical indicating similar absorption efficiencies. Using CT and MRI, we found that ~17% lower body weight in CF mice was composed of 17% less of whole-body adipose tissue and 7% less of lean muscle tissue. In CF mice, epididymal adipose tissue was reduced by a third (598\u00b179 vs. 399\u00b133 mg, WT and CF, respectively, p<0.05). We hypothesized that such drastic differences could be due to excessive lipolysis and/or decreased synthesis rate. We found free plasma glycerol (a measure of intracellular lipolysis) was indeed significantly elevated (0.14\u00b10.01 vs. 0.23\u00b10.02 mM, WT and CF mice, respectively, p<0.01). To determine fractional rates of synthesis of newly made lipids and proteins, we injected mice with a bolus of deuterated water ( 2 H 2 0) and determined 2 H incorporation into newly made fatty acids and proteins of adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver. We found fractional lipid synthesis was not different in the adipose tissue (14.0\u00b11 vs. 13.2\u00b10.8%, WT and CF mice, respectively), but absolute rate of synthesis was significantly lower in CF (85.3\u00b115.7 vs. 40.2\u00b16.4 mg/day, p<0.05). Fractional rate of protein synthesis tended to be lower in both skeletal muscle and heart proteins. However, absolute rate of whole-body protein synthesis was significantly lower in CF mice (~45%, p<0.05). Lastly, we found significantly decreased hepatic de novo lipogenesis in CF mice (~24 and ~20%, palmitic and stearic fatty acids, respectively, p<0.05) while cholesterol synthesis was significantly increased in CF mice (~20%, p<0.05).",

Subsequent data processing using sophisticated multivariate statistical analytical software enables reliable, relative quantitative comparison of large numbers of metabolite levels between sample cohorts. This allows broad ranging analysis seeking to identify disturbances in metabolic pathways that may be causally linked to or predict subsequent disease. Our focus is the biochemical basis for disturbed methyl and thiol metabolism and its relation to varying degrees of disease severity among children with cystic fibrosis (CF). Using this approach, we analyzed 40 urine samples from children with CF and 9 healthy children without CF. All of the children with CF were outpatients at the CF clinic of the British Columbia Children's Hospital and all were seen during a routine outpatient clinic appointment.

Benzoic acid is a natural component of foods, such as berries and other fruits and, importantly, is widely used in high doses as a preservative in processed foods and soft drinks. Due to widespread use of benzoic acid in foods and no evidence of lower benzoate intakes among children with CF when compared to other children, metabolic limitation of conjugation appears likely. Gregus et al. (2) have shown that the limiting factors for benzoate metabolism are glycine and/or coenzyme A, not low enzymatic activity. Increased glycine loss via bile acid conjugates may deplete glycine pools; and glycine is also an essential amino acid in glutathione and involved in methyl transfer, all known to be disrupted in CF (3) , but Coenzyme A is also formed from sulphur amino acids. Intakes of benzoate that exceed glycine availability lead to increasing benzoate levels in plasma, since renal excretion of unconjugated benzoic acid is minimal and other benzoate metabolic pathways, such as formation of benzoylalanine or benzoylglucuronide, represent very limited alternatives (1) . Current analysis is focusing on quantitative analysis of plasma benzoate to confirm impaired conjugation and excretion, also enabling assessment of potential risk of benzoate toxicity, as well as quantitative measures of methyl metabolites and amino acids.",

Background: Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is the most common co-morbidity in persons with CF. Several studies have provided evidence for the clinical utility of oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) screening in adolescents and adults with CF. Guidelines recommend annual OGTT screening for all CF patients age 10 and older. This recommendation does not address younger patients with CF. However, OGTT screening in children could be recommended if, as in adults, the glucose tolerance category provided clinically relevant prognostic information. This current retrospective chart review was performed to determine whether the baseline OGTT category in CF children age 6-10 years predicts subsequent clinical course.",

In addition, patients report little difficulty on daily management of CFRD, achieving glucose control within recommended levels.

These women have a mean age of 42yrs (range 31-63) with BMI 22 (17-35); FEV1 56% predicted (23%-115%) and 61% are PI. Eleven of 33 (33%) subjects answered questions in the MRS indicating symptoms of perimenopause. Five of 11 had reached menopause at an average age of 47.8yrs (45-51) and 6/11 had not yet reached menopause. The average age of onset of perimenopause symptoms was 37.8yrs (32-42yrs). Perimenopausal symptoms included: hot flashes in 58.1%, palpitations 46%, sleep problems 75%, depressed mood 68%, anxiety 59%, exhaustion 67%, sexual problems 64%, bladder problems 51%, vaginal dryness 53% and joint/muscle discomfort in 75%. Sleep problems had the highest score in severity (15.6% marked \"very severe\"). All but one patient reported increased respiratory symptoms which included: dyspnea 9/11, chest tightness/wheezing 8/11, thicker sputum 10/11, increased sputum volume 9/11, and hemoptysis 5/11. Conclusion: Women with CF appear to experience perimenopause sympotms slightly earlier than the general population (37.8yrs in CF vs 41yrs). Sleep problem is the most dominant and severe symptom reported. It is not clear if the increased respiratory symptoms are related to progressive lung disease or perimenopause. Educational material can be developed to increase patients' knowledge of perimenopause and outline strategies that can be used to deal with this change of life. Leptin, a protein secreted from white adipose tissue, plays an important role in the regulation of food intake. Serum leptin levels have been shown to be regulated by circulating insulin concentrations. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is often associated with endocrine pancreatic dysfunction. As a result, most CF patients have decreased and/or abnormal insulin secretion. Our hypothesis was that serum leptin concentrations would be reduced in CF subjects and particularly in those that have CF related diabetes (CFRD) who showed a pronounced decrease in insulin secretion. To examine the relationship between leptin and insulin, we measured the levels of both hormones in the fasting state in 10 healthy controls (6 men and 4 women), 50 CF adults with normal glucose tolerance (NGT, 30 men and 20 women), 22 CF subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT, 12 men and 10 women) and 12 subjects with CFRD but without insulin treatment (6 men and 6 women). We also determined body mass index (BMI) and the percentage of fat mass by bioimpedance for each participant. We observed no difference in serum leptin levels between healthy controls and CF subjects from all three glucose tolerance groups (NGT, IGT and CFRD). In CF subjects we observed positive correlations between leptin and BMI (p<0.001), percentage of fat mass (p<0.001), fasting insulin (p \u22640.035) and insulin resistance as evaluated with the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index (p\u22640.034). Interestingly, after correction for BMI and fat mass, the correlations between leptin and fasting insulin levels and HOMA index remained significant for women but not for men. Thus, while leptin levels of CF subjects are similar to those of healthy controls, we observed significant differences in the association between leptin and insulin among men and women. These results suggest that the association between these two hormones may be modulated by gender. Future studies are necessary to examine these differences observed between men and women. Background: Evidence indicates that the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) may follow a period of decline in lung function and weight gain. Early diagnosis and treatment of CFRD may alter the progression of disease. In 2007 our center began annual oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) for patients with CF age \u2265 10 years. Inconsistency in the diagnosis and treatment of CFRD was noted among various endocrinology specialists (ES). Later that year, we evaluated current practice with a literature review, consensus meetings, and a benchmarking visit to a leading CFRD-CF center. As a result, we made three changes: a protocol for the diagnosis and treatment of CFRD; a CFRD clinic on the same day as CF clinic; and a primary ES for those with CFRD.",

Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a progressive disease that is characterised by repeated respiratory infective exacerbations, a gradual decline in lung function and eventually respiratory failure in >90% of patients. Prolonged treatment with high dose intravenous (IV) antibiotics is an established treatment for exacerbations which can be delivered in hospital or at home. Thornton et al. (J Cyst Fibros 2005; 4:239) concluded that hospital treatment was significantly more effective at improving FEV1 but more expensive than home treatment. In a review of the literature Balaguer and Gonz\u00e1lez del Dios (Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2000;(3):CD001917) identified one randomised controlled trial that included 17 CF patients. The authors suggested that home IV treatment in CF showed no differences for clinical outcomes, adverse events, or complications. Patients who did the home IV regimen however, reported being more tired and found the treatment more difficult to master. A possible reason for these findings was cited as patients being more active and needing more support. Home therapy was cheaper for families and the hospital.",

Vermont Childrens Hospital, FAHC, Burlington, VT, USA Background: The Vermont Cystic Fibrosis Program is part of the Children's Specialty Center, an outpatient subspecialty clinic area composed of 19+ pediatric subspecialty practices. We hold weekly CF clinics, have monthly team meetings which include members of the family advisory board, and attend the monthly CF advisory board meetings. As part of transitioning our patients to the adult program, one of our CF Team goals is to develop educational tools related specifically to the CF patient. We felt that the team members routinely educated the families, have addressed education related to transition for the 12-18 year old, but did not have a formal process in place to educate the patient from diagnosis to the age of transition. As most patient teaching was being done by the CF Nurse Coordinator, we were limited by time and priority of other tasks related to a busy clinic. Two years ago, the Children's Speciality Center applied for and received funding from the Children's Miracle Network to support a full time Child Life Specialist (CCLS) for our oupatient subspecialty practices. At our institution, CCLS's were primarily staffed in the inpatient setting, so their role had not been defined in the outpatient areas. The Child Life Council defines the role as \"Child life specialists are experts in child development, who promote effective coping through play, preparation, education, and self expression activities.\"",

A decline in score may be an indication to re-evaluate current treatment regimens and to discuss available chronic therapies and/or aggressive nutritional support. The benefit of adding therapy at the time of a drop in Liou score may outweigh the perceived negative aspects of adding additional time-consuming and costly treatments. A stable or increased score may indicate that therapies and treatments in place are appropriate. In addition, Liou score trends may be a valuable tool that could be used to improve the prescription and use of recommended, chronic CF therapies. We describe the value of using a standard scoring system to identify pulmonary exacerbations via telephone triage and to ensure subsequent office follow-up. A telephone triage form was adopted in 2006 to rapidly identify and treat pulmonary exacerbations using a modified version of the Pulmonary Exacerbation Score (PES) that has been in use in our outpatient clinic as a result of the Learning and Leadership Collaborative project in 2004. This phone-adapted modification of the PES assists nurses to consistently assess pulmonary exacerbations over the phone so that antibiotic treatment can be initiated quickly, and office follow-up assured.",

As a consequence of cortical thinning, both the age-adjusted (-1.56 \u00b1 0.94) and the height-adjusted (-0.80 \u00b1 0.82 SDS) Strength-Strain Index that reflects the combined strength of trabecular and cortical bone, was reduced. In addition, the height-adjusted muscle crosssectional area (-1.34 \u00b1 0.89 SDS) was significantly decreased. BMD by DEXA both of the lumbar spine (-1.38 \u00b1 1.21 SDS) and the total skeleton (-0.67 \u00b1 1.14 SDS) was also compromised.

Chronic illness, malnutrition, vitamin D deficiency, glucocorticoids, inflammatory cytokines and hypogonadism contribute to CF bone disease. However, epidemiological investigations and knockout animal models suggest a direct link between CFTR inactivation in bone and low BMD. Studies were performed examining mechanisms of bone cell dysregulation due to CFTR inactivation. Osteoblasts expressed significantly more CFTR than osteoclasts, so studies were directed at this cell type. In the calvarial organ culture assay, Cftr null mice had reduced bone formation compared to WT littermates (6430 \u00b5m 2 vs. 16440 \u00b5m 2 , p=0.0023).

A survey was sent to adult, pediatric and affiliate CF program directors (PDs) using the CFF database. A second survey was sent to NPPs from CFF contact information and referrals from PDs. Results: PD survey: Responses were received from 108 PDs (49% pediatric, 34% adult, 17% affiliate) with center sizes ranging from 30-700 patients (mean 177 +/-128). Overall, 57 (53%) programs had NPPs and 76 (70%) had or planned to hire NPPs. Academic programs comprised 84 (77%) of programs. Of the 57 programs with fellows, 58% had NPPs. PDs described collaborative relationships between fellows and NPPs. Reasons for NPP use included ideal clinical role (75%), expansion of services (72%) and physician shortage (40%). Programs actively recruiting physicians Based on the survey results, education related to infection and infection control measures continues to be justified. Staff need to be educated about use of gowns and gloves with all CF patients to assure 100% compliance with our standard. Parent/child education regarding signs of possible lung infection needs to be offered frequently",

Conclusions: NPPs are working with physicians in many centers and have the potential to help meet the increasing clinical workforce need. Further evaluation of financial issues is indicated to continue the support of NPP jobs in CF. Roles and expectations need to be clearly defined.

Department of Cellular Biology and Development, University \"La Sapienza\", Rome, Italy P. aeruginosa and B. cenocepacia opportunistic infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients can be single or polymicrobial. Relatively little is known regarding microbial interactions within such communities compared to what is known about individual bacterial species living in isolation. Here, we used a mouse model of chronic infection (Bragonzi et al. J Infect Dis 2005;192:410) to screen the pathogenicity of two different panels of P. aeruginosa and B. cenocepacia strains, isolated from CF patients and from environment and to test polymicrobial interactions during co-infections. Virulence was assessed by monitoring acute mortality versus survival and chronic persistence versus lung clearance in C57Bl/6 mice. Single infections demonstrated that both clinical and environmental P. aeruginosa and B. cenocepacia strains challenged in agar beads were able to persist in the lungs of infected mice irrespective of their origin (Bragonzi et al. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2009 May7 [Epub ahead of print]; Pirone et al. Environ Microbiol 2008;10:2773). Next, selected P. aeruginosa and B.",

Subsequent infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PsA) is linked to accelerated decline in lung function and increased morbidity and mortality. Current literature supports therapeutic interventions designed to clear PsA from the lung with a variety of anti-PsA antibiotics. The Pediatric CF Care Center at the University of Alabama initiated an eradication protocol for PsA in 2001. Patients were initially prescribed 28 days of inhaled tobramycin (TOBI) following identification of PsA via airway culture. Patients remaining PsA positive after one month of therapy received 28 more days of TOBI with the addition of two weeks of oral ciprofloxacin. Patients still PsA positive after the second course of therapy were treated with additional antibiotics at the discretion of the treating physician.",

Nevertheless, similar [Ca 2+ ] i elevations observed upon stimulation with low [carbachol] (CCh; 100nM) alone (95\u00b19 nM; n=5) were not sufficient to activate cell shrinkage, suggesting that VIP-evoked shrinkage was not solely the result of Ca 2+ -activation of K + and/or Clpermeabilities as observed during secretion evoked by higher [CCh]. VIP-evoked Ca 2+ signals likely originate downstream of cAMP, as stimulation with either forskolin (10\u00b5M) or the phosphodiesterase-inhibiting compound IBMX (250\u00b5M) elicited similar [Ca 2+ ] i elevations and simultaneous cell shrinkage.

            "text": "Toronto has faced the challenges of caring for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) infected with B. cepacia complex (Bcc) for 3 decades. The dominant genomovar of Bcc has been B. cenocepacia ET 12. Since the institution of infection control measures in 1992, the prevalence of infection with Bcc has decreased and currently ~ 20% of our 380 patients are infected. Since 1998, there have been 19 new acquisitions ofBurkholderia, 8 B. cenocepacia, and 2 B. gladioli. The last patient to acquire B. cenocepacia was in 2003. Between September 16 and October 7, 2008, 5 CF patients were newly infected with B. cepacia complex. Box PCR genotyping (LiPuma lab) revealed that all patients had identical B. cenocepacia ET 12. Microbiological testing, including MCBT testing, revealed all isolates were highly multi-drug resistant. All 5 patients had overlapping hospital stays on the CF ward in August 2008 and positive cultures for Bcc occurred 2-6 weeks following discharge from hospital. A patient with known multi-resistant B. cenocepacia ET12 was also admitted to the CF unit in August and expired due to cepacia syndrome. A chart review and interviews with patient and staff indicated that there was no common or shared respiratory equipment and that none had consecutive procedures such as bronchoscopy or pulmonary function. No direct linkages were identified between the patient with known B. cenocepacia and these 5 patients. Discussions with patients indicated a widespread change in behavior with complex and tight-knit social groups and a variety of \"high risk\" activities in outpatient and inpatient contexts. Contact tracing was conducted on all inpatients in hospital during the original admission of the 5 case patients, as well as any outpatients known to have contact with these patients. No new cases have been identified from the 51/54 (94%) contacts screened. Environmental swabs from the unit, clinic, and pulmonary function lab were all negative for Bcc. The clinical outcome of this outbreak has been sobering. Four of 5 patients have died between 37 and 104 days post acquisition. One patient is still alive and well post-acquisition. B. cenocepacia has been a part of our CF population for decades but a new \"vulnerable\" patient population had emerged. The epidemic curve suggests a point source transmission of B. cenocepacia on the CF ward. The etiology of the spread is uncertain -contact between patients, indirect contact spread through health care workers hands, or environmental contamination are all possible. There is no room for complacency in CF clinics with patients with Bcc. Ongoing education of infection control measures is necessary for staff and patients. The increased ability to \"meet\" others with CF through internet communication may lead to increased physical contact between patients. A rapid and coordinated response by CF and Infection control teams hopefully limited the epidemic though the final implications remain to be determined.",

We investigated whether repeated therapy with AZLI led to an increase in the acquisition of pathogens other than PA.Methods: In aPhase 3, 18 month,  follow-on study (AIR-CF3) patients could receive up to nine courses of AZLI therapy, 28-days of AZLI (BID or TID) followed by 28 days off treatment.Patients attended up  to 20 scheduled clinic visits (every 28 days). At each study visit, sputum samples were collected and processed according to the CF Foundation standards and cultured for PA, S. aureus, S. maltophilia, A. xylosoxidans, Burkholderia spp. and Aspergillus ssp. The appearance or disappearance, and change in CFU density of each pathogen were evaluated. Results: A total of 274 patients enrolled in AIR-CF3; 166 patients completed all nine treatment courses. The minimum number of sputum samples that were analyzed at a single time point was 134. Over the nine treatment courses the mean PA density decreased 0.5-0.74 log 10 CFUs during each on-treatment course. Increases in mean log 10 PA CFUs occurred during the off-treatment intervals but were limited such that PA CFUs in sputum were generally below baseline over the entire study. At baseline, 24% of patients had a positive sputum culture result for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, 13% for methicillin-resistant S. aureus, 10% for S. maltophilia, 8% for A. xylosoxidans, and 21% for Aspergillus ssp. The percentage of patients infected with each of these pathogens at the end of 9 courses of AZLI therapy deviated only 1-2% from the baseline values. Furthermore, most patients experienced no change in the presence or absence of these pathogens. Burkholderia spp., which was present in one patient at baseline, was detected only intermittently in 4 other patients. A high percentage of patients experienced no gain or loss of other pathogens throughout nine treatment courses of AZLI. This no change population percentage ranged from 84-92% for MSSA, 91-96% for MRSA, 87-91% for S. maltophilia, 94-98% for A. xylosoxidans, and 76-85% for Aspergillus ssp. Conclusion: Repeated courses of AZLI were associated with a consistent reduction from baseline in PA CFUs throughout AIR-CF3. Despite this decrease in PA density in sputum, there was no emergence of other common respiratory pathogens, such as S. aureus, S. maltophilia, A. xylosoxidans, Burkholderia spp. and Aspergillus ssp.

Open-ended mutation testing reveals CF cases that would be misidentified as carriers using other screening algorithms that rely heavily on evaluation by[SC]  for making follow up decisions.RISK FACTORS FOR EARLY PSEUDOMONAS ACQUISITION IN A LARGE COHORT OF YOUNG U.S. CF PATIENTSRosenfeld, M. 1 ; Emerson, J. 1 ; Joubran, K. 1 ; Morgan, W. 2 ; Gibson, R. 1 ; The EPIC Observational Study Group. 1.

This information should be used together with the clinical assessment to determine diagnosis. Ruling out a diagnosis of CF should not be based solely on a normal[SC].

Objective: Identify factors associated with high CF NBS open case rates at NY CF Centers. Methods: We divided the Centers into two groups based on their cumulative open case rate during the years 2005-2008: a low rate (LOW group) and a high rate (HIGH) group.

Acknowledgments: This study was supported by Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA. The authors gratefully acknowledge the patients, parents, investigators, and coordinators of the ESCF.A number of previous investigations have reported that cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with liver disease have worse FEV1 than those without liver disease, whereas others have reported no difference or even a slower annual rate of FEV1 (% Pred) decline. We speculate that the lack of a welldefined relationship between liver disease and pulmonary function in CF reflects, in part, the lack of a uniform definition of clinically relevant liver disease. To assess the relationship between clinically significant liver disease and pulmonary function, we retrospectively evaluated spirometric data from 235 CF patients (62% male) with severe liver disease (CFLD) as defined by the presence of portal hypertension (confirmed by splenomegaly, esophageal varices, and/or hypersplenism). The distribution of FEV1 (% Pred) values in this cohort (mean age 11.2 yrs +/-5.4) at or before the diagnosis of CFLD approximated a normal distribution (confirmed by Shapiro-Wilk test, p=0.28), indicating no significant shift toward mild or severe lung disease. We also compared those FEV1 measures obtained at the time of (or prior to) the diagnosis of CFLD to CF-specific reference values matched for age and gender, as defined by Kulich percentile; there was a strong correlation between FEV1 (% Pred) and Kulich percentile (r=0.85; Figure 1 ). Lastly, rates of annual decline of FEV1 (% Pred) before diagnosis of CFLD showed no significant difference when compared with post-CFLD rates of decline (p=0.34). Taken together, these results suggest that pulmonary function at the onset of CFLD (defined by portal hypertension) is neither more mild nor severe than that of matched CF patients without CFLD, suggesting no strong overlap for the underlying genetic risk in these two diseases.",

Risk factors for decline (including signs and symptoms, medical conditions, and microbiology), were identified and compared among and within age groups with repeated-measures, mixed model regression.Results: Mean (\u00b1SD) baseline FEV1 % pred was 67.7\u00b122.0 for ages 18-24 (n=2795) and 55.7\u00b121.0 for ages \u226525 yrs (n=1378). The mean rates of FEV1 decline (% pred/yr) were -1.93 and -1.35 respectively. Independent risk factors for decline in the 18-24 yr group (p < 0.05, ranked in order of impact on decline) were pancreatic enzyme use (surrogate for pancreatic insufficiency)(-0.88 % pred/yr), B. cepacia (-0.85 % pred/yr), multiply resistant P. aeruginosa (-0.61 % pred/yr), asthma (-0.32 % pred/yr), sputum (-0.31 % pred/yr), mucoid P. aeruginosa (-0.30 % pred/yr) , and female sex (-0.28 % pred/yr) . Three factors were identified as contributing to less decline, wheeze (0.55 % pred/yr), sinusitis (0.41 % pred/yr), and baseline FEV1 % pred <40 (1.19 % pred/yr higher than the 40-69 group). Restricting the analysis to those 18-24 yrs with FEV1 % pred \u226540 yielded similar results (risk factors and impact), and identified an additional risk factor (cough; -0.34 % pred/yr), while baseline FEV1 % pred, sputum, wheeze and asthma were no longer significant. For the \u226525 yr group, the only significant risk factor for decline was pancreatic enzyme use (-0.53 % pred/yr), while baseline FEV1 % pred <40 contributed to less decline (0.72 % pred). Restricting the analysis to those \u226525 yrs with FEV1 % pred \u226540, Aspergillus was identified as a risk factor (-0.67 % pred) , the impact of pancreatic enzyme was stronger (-0.57 % pred/yr), and sinusitis was identified as contributing to less decline (0.52 % pred/yr). The \u226525 yr group was divided and analyzed for ages 25-31 (n=772) and \u226532 (n=606). Results were similar between these 2 age groups. Compared to our previous analysis in children (ages 6-17 yrs) with CF (Konstan et al, J Pediatr 2007; 151:134-9) , our analysis in adults differed for several risk factors. Most notable was no effect of baseline FEV1 % pred \u226540, and the exclusion of crackles and IV-treated exacerbations as risk factors in adults.Conclusions: This study identifies and assesses the impact of risk factors for FEV1 decline in adults with CF. Many of the risk factors identified for the youngest adults (ages 18-24 yrs) were similar to those identified in our previous work in children. We speculate that a survival effect in older adults (\u2265 25 yrs) accounts for the differences in risk factors. As with our previous work in children, the results from this study in adults might allow clinicians to determine the estimated risk of FEV1 decline for an adult with CF.

Younger children can experience disease progression that is not easily identified and traditional spirometry, the standard by which CF lung disease progression is measured, cannot be reliably performed under age 6. A previous analysis using data from the Epidemiologic Study of CF (ESCF) showed relationships between clinical variables at age 3 and lung function at age 6 ( Konstan et al., J Pediatr 2003; 142:624-30) . We have extended this work using ESCF data to develop a simple tool for use during a routine clinic visit for children ages 2-5 yrs to estimate lung function at age 6.Methods: Subjects ages 2-5 yrs were included if they had an index clinic visit (ICV) prior to 1/1/1998 and >1 yr after ESCF enrollment. FEV 1 % predicted measured at a stable follow-up clinic visit between the 6 th and 7 th birthday was used as the outcome. Age, sex, sputum production, cough, wheeze, clubbing, crackles, sinusitis, elevated liver enzymes, pancreatic enzyme use, weight-for-age percentile, height-for-age percentile, number of past year exacerbations, and culture status at the ICV were used to predict FEV 1 % predicted in multivariable linear regressions. Variable interactions were also studied. A \"risk score\" was created by assigning whole numbers to risk factors with each 1-unit difference representing a 2% predicted deviation from 100% predicted at age 6. The relationship of the risk score and actual FEV 1 % predicted at age 6 was assessed by Pearson correlation coefficient.Results: 2,709 CF patients were included in the analysis. Whole numbers were assigned to categories for cough, wheeze, clubbing, crackles, weight-for-age percentile, number of past year exacerbations, and P. aeruginosa infection status and summed to create a risk score ranging from -18 to +2 (theoretical range, -20 to +2), with a median score of -1 (mean, -2.1; standard deviation, 3.3) . No variable interactions remained in the final algorithm. The relationship between risk scores and FEV 1 at age 6 approximated target values, with a risk score of 0 equal to 99.3% predicted FEV 1 and each score unit equal to 2.09% change in predicted FEV 1 . The Pearson correlation coefficient was +0.35. For any given risk score, mean and median FEV 1 % predicted for patients with that score increased as the value of the score increased.Conclusions: This simple category scoring tool to predict FEV 1 % predicted at age 6 uses information available at any clinic visit. The tool has the potential to identify young patients at high risk of having poorer lung function at age 6. The results might better inform clinicians and families about the risk of measurable lung disease by age 6 yrs in young children with CF.Background: The Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis & Genetic Disorders (CFGD) Review Group was established in 1995 and publishes systematic reviews of interventions for cystic fibrosis (CF), which are available via The Cochrane Library (www.thecochranelibrary.com). The Editorial Board includes 5 CF specialists. A Cochrane review provides systematic evaluation of the best evidence available to determine the effectiveness of an intervention (for example, hypertonic saline) for people with CF. A review will generally have 3-5 authors; international collaborations are encouraged. Following publication of a peer-reviewed protocol, authors complete the review (often with support and guidance from the Editorial base staff) and after successful open peer review (including statistician and consumer) the review is published.Aim: To assess the impact of Cochrane CF reviews on the care of people with CF.Methods: The most recent edition of the Cochrane Library (2009) was examined for CF reviews and protocols. We noted the number of trials from the CFGD register (a comprehensive database of CF-related clinical trials) that have been evaluated. We examined citations in national guidelines and feedback from authors.Results: Forty-five reviews and 6 protocols directly related to CF have currently been published in the Cochrane Library by the CFGD. In December 2008, a total of 1072 CF trials were listed on the CFGD register; 478 (45%) of these have been evaluated critically and 178 (16%) were of sufficient quality to be included in published systematic reviews. All reviews contain recommendations for future research and in five cases this had a direct impact resulting in new trials. Data from these trials have then been incorporated in the updated reviews leading to a change in recommendations for clinical practice. Reviews have also been cited in consensus documents and guidelines published by the UK CF Trust, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the European Cystic Fibrosis Society and the Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews now has an impact factor of 4.654 and is ranked 14th out of 100 journals in the 'Medicine, General and Internal' category.Conclusions: Systematic reviews have a direct impact on practice and can also identify gaps in current evidence and help set the research agenda. Reviews are written by volunteers, usually healthcare professionals, with support from the Editorial Base. Anyone who is interested can contribute as an author, peer reviewer or consumer referee.",

Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital and Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA Rationale: Determining quality outcomes in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) has historically relied on ranking care sites based on patient data from a single year (Quinton and O'Connor. Clin Chest Med 2007; 28:459-72) . This site ranking also correlates with practice patterns (Johnson et al. Chest 2003; 123:20-7) . However, change in pulmonary function over time (slope) may be a more important metric to determine best practice. Therefore we used data from the Epidemiologic Study of Cystic Fibrosis (ESCF) to determine how site rankings differ based on various single-year measures vs. multi-year measures including FEV1 slope.Methods: Data from ESCF for the years 2000-2002 were used to identify CF care sites with at least 10 patients in one of three age groups (6-12, 13-18, \u226518 years). Patients had to have received care at that site for all 3 years and have results from at least two \"clinically stable\" pulmonary function tests (PFTs) per year. Sites were ranked by the median of their patients' PFT values (separately for FEV1, FVC, or FEF25-75) using three methods: the best value in 2002 (single-year); the average of each best value in 2000, 2001, and 2002 (3-year average) ; and the slope of best values from 2000 to 2002 estimated by simple linear regression (3-year slope) . Spearman rank correlation coefficients were used to compare the site rankings by the different methods.Results: A total of 113 sites were included. The site median FEV1 in 2002 correlated well with other PFT variables for that year as well as the 3-year average FEV1 of the best value from each year (Table) . There was a much smaller correlation with the slope over the prior 3 years. Because patients with severe disease often demonstrate little decline in FEV1 we re-analyzed site ranking based upon only those with FEV1 \u226550% predicted. This minimally altered the results with a minor increase in the correlation of single-year FEV1 with 3-year slope in the \u226518-year-old group (r = 0.19).Conclusions: These results suggest that using single-year, or 3-year average, patients' PFTs to rank sites does not represent the rank based on the PFT slope over 3 years. We speculate that using PFT slope over several years may better reflect the impact of care within a site and should be considered when evaluating best practices.",

            "text": "Sufian, B.S.; Passamano, J.A. Sufian & Passamano, L.L.P., Houston, TX, USA Introduction: Maintaining health insurance is an important concern to CF patients. In the past year, most likely due to the economic recession, the number of patients with problems related to health insurance greatly increased. The issues are: (1) losing employer-sponsored health insurance; (2) needing to extend coverage under COBRA; (3) seeking to qualify for Social Security Disability Insurance; (4) retaining coverage under a parent's plan as a disabled child; (5) obtaining Supplemental Security Income; and (6) losing benefits due to marriage.Method: The CF Legal information Hotline is sponsored by the CF Foundation. It began operation in 1998 and provides free and confidential legal information to people with CF. It has received over 12,000 calls in 11 years from throughout the U.S. The calls received by the Hotline reflect the legal issues affecting the CF community. The average number of calls per month by subject in 2009 is compared to 2008 to determine any significant change in problems experienced.Results: The study showed a significant increase in concerns about maintaining health insurance. It showed a 117.8% increase in the number of persons with CF or their parents who lost employer-sponsored health insurance. The number of callers seeking to extend coverage under COBRA increased 153.2%.The study showed a 70.2% increase in the number of persons with CF seeking Social Security Disability Insurance. Many of these are young adults who experienced a decline in health after entering the workforce. Yet, no significant increase was observed in the numbers seeking to qualify for Supplemental Security Income (SSI).The study showed a 35.3% increase in the number of persons with CF who reached a limiting age on their parents health plan, but sought to remain on the plan because they are incapable of self-support. These individuals are young adults completing high school or college. Finally the study shows an 87.1% increase in the number of young adults concerned about how a proposed marriage will affect their health benefits.Discussion: Persons who lost their jobs were often eligible for a COBRA subsidy which made COBRA affordable. Direction as to coverage options was helpful. Young adults reaching a limiting age under their parents plan are aided by Disabled Child laws that allow a child incapable of selfsupport to remain a dependent on a parent's plan.Workers unable to work seeking SSDI benefits have several concerns, including maintaining coverage during the 29 month Medicare waiting period and the 5 month income waiting period. Others experience difficulty when medical records do not adequately reflect the conditions of eligibility. Some report tension between a patient's need to stop work and the care team's use of employment as a measure of successful treatment.Marriage may adversely affect health benefits. Marriage can cause a person to lose coverage under a parent's policy, without adequate replacement coverage. The combined assets of spouses may cause the spouse with CF to become ineligible for Medicaid or cause the loss of Medicare subsidies.Conclusion: Obtaining and maintaining insurance coverage remains the single most important legal concern among CF patients and families. Coverage issues increase and are harder to solve during a recession. Background: Acute treatments such as intravenous (IV) antibiotics are used mainly for treatment of bacterial infections that result in cystic fibrosis (CF) exacerbation admissions. In the 2008 CF Exacerbation guidelines, the CF Foundation recommends the use of once-daily IV aminoglycosides in all CF patients with acute pulmonary disease. In early 2006, we started using the once-daily tobramycin dosing strategy for most CF patients. We monitored toxicity and efficacy via a trough drawn 30 minutes prior to the second dose and a peak drawn one hour after the second dose: Trough Dose Peak (TDP). Dosing adjustments were made using standard pharmacokinetic equations or by adjusting the dose by 10% in order to achieve a peak of 20-30 mg/mL and a trough < 1 mg/mL. This process was performed until 10/2008 when a change in the monitoring strategy was initiated based on information from the 2008 NACFC. We began to use a peak drawn one hour after the second dose and a random level drawn at eight to twelve hours: Peak Random (PR). In addition, target ranges of Cmax (20-30 mg/mL) and AUC (80-125 mg/L/hr) were used to guide therapy. The objective of this study is to evaluate the initial effects of the change in tobramycin pharmacokinetic monitoring strategy.",

            "text": "Methods: We conducted a retrospective data analysis of all CF admits utilizing once-daily tobramycin therapy from 01/01/2007 to 03/31/2009. Descriptive statistics and student's t-test were used for data analysis. The variables included were dose in mg/kg (before/after the change in monitoring process), half life (T1/2) (before/after), volume of distribution (Vd) (before/after), Cmax (after), AUC (after), number of tobramycin laboratory draws per admit (before/after), number of dose changes per admit (before/after), and serum creatinine values (before/after). This project was IRB-approved.Results: A total of 79 patients with 129 admissions were included in the study: 54 patients with 100 admissions (TDP) vs. 25 patients with 29 admissions (PR). The mean mg/kg/dose was 10.2 mg/kg/dose (TDP) vs. 10.3 mg/kg/dose (p=NS) (PR). The mean T1/2 was 3.3 hours (TDP) vs. 1.89 hours (PR) (p<0.001). The mean Vd was 13.85 L (0.35 L/kg) (TDP) vs. 9.9 L (0.3 L/kg) (PR) (p=0.001). The mean calculated Cmax for the PR group was 32.8 mg/mL. The mean calculated AUC for the PR group was 96.5 mg/L/hr. There was a mean of 3.6 tobramycin levels per admit with 1.5 dose changes (TDP) vs. 4 tobramycin levels per admit with 1.6 dose changes (PR) (p=NS). The mean serum creatinine values drawn during admit were 0.62 mg/dL and 0.58 mg/dL, respectively (TDP) vs. 0.52 mg/dL and 0.5 mg/dL, respectively (PR).Conclusion: A statistically significant difference was found between the mean T1/2 and Vd between the TDP and PR methods, however, this did not translate to a change in overall dosing. The PR method calculated a T1/2 within the published aminoglycoside half-life range in CF patients (1-2 hrs) . The TDP method was not as reliable at predicting the T1/2 and Vd possibly due to the inability of the tobramycin assay to detect levels below 0.6 mg/L or the potential inaccuracy of using an extended interval trough to calculate elimination. Healthcare systems have not universally adopted systematic approaches to quality improvement (QI). Using Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Learning and Leadership Collaborative tools for enhancing delivery of care, the Central CT CF Center's (CCCFC) global aim is to improve adherence and selfmanagement of care in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). We hypothesize if adherence and co-management improve, disease management improves, and potentially so will health outcomes.",

            "text": "Background: Pancreatic involvement is common and the injury is progressive in cystic fibrosis (CF), leaving over 85% of patients with pancreatic insufficiency (PI). Despite a universal involvement of the pancreas in CF, the mechanisms leading to its destruction are not well-known. CFTR gene knock-out mouse models do not recapitulate the pancreatic involvement characteristic of CF in humans.Hypothesis: Pancreatic involvement in a CFTR-/-pig model will be similar to humans with CF.Methods: We investigated the pancreatic histology and the expression of exocrine and endocrine cell markers in CFTR-/-newborn pigs and contrasted our findings with CFTR+/+ pigs. We used microarray expression profiling to explore the differences in gene transcription between CF and non-CF pig pancreata using an Affymetrix Porcine GeneChip.Results: Lobular exocrine tissue was significantly reduced in CFTR-/pancreata with variable degrees of acute and chronic inflammation. There were scattered neutrophils and macrophages infiltrating the acini and the inspissated material in ectatic ducts. In contrast, lymphocytes and plasma cells infiltrated the interstitial space; they formed large aggregates in areas of severe exocrine tissue destruction often centered on the ectatic remnant ducts. Pancreatic ducts were dilated with mucus surrounding centrally oriented inspissated zymogen secretions. Pancreatic amylase, lipase and trypsin activities, and pancreatic elastase and chymotrypsinogen expression were markedly decreased in CFTR-/-pigs. Immunohistochemistry staining for insulin, glucagon and somatostatin were present and comparable in all pigs. Microarray expression profiling showed unchanged mRNA expression for glucagon and somatostatin, diminished mRNA expression for pancreatic exocrine enzymes, and upregulation of proinflammatory genes in CFTR-/-pig tissue. Interestingly, mucin producing gene expression (MUC1, MUC5B, MUC5AC) was diminished in CFTR-/-pig pancreata compared to CFTR+/+ pigs.Conclusion: CFTR-/-pig pancreas had increased inflammatory cell infiltration and proinflammatory gene expression compared to CFTR+/+ pigs. It is currently unknown whether inflammation precedes the pancreatic lesions or develops in response to tissue destruction. Our studies show that the pancreas is severely involved in CFTR-/-pigs, similar to humans with severe CFTR mutations. CFTR-/-pigs may be an excellent model to study the mechanisms underlying pancreatic disease in CF. 5 1. Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA; 2.

Patients were randomized to one of two sequences, pancrelipase then placebo, or placebo then pancrelipase (5 days each with intervening washout period of 3-14 days on their usual PERT). We measured the coefficient of fat absorption (CFA), the coefficient of nitrogen absorption (CNA), clinical symptomatology, and safety parameters by age (12-18 years vs >18 years of age) and severity of EPI (placebo CFA \u2264 50% [more severe] vs CFA >50% [less severe]).Results: The effects of study drug on CFA and CNA (placebo-adjusted change from baseline) were slightly higher in subjects 12-18 years of age compared to those >18 years of age. LS means \u00b1 standard error (SE) for treatment difference from placebo were CFA 43.4 \u00b1 5.7% vs 37.3 \u00b1 4.2%, respectively and CNA 39.0 \u00b1 5.2% vs 33.6 \u00b1 3.3%, respectively (all P<0.001 vs placebo). Subjects with more severe EPI showed greater improvement with study drug compared to those with less severe EPI: CFA and CNA LS means \u00b1 SE for treatment difference were 52.4 \u00b1 2.5% vs 23.3 \u00b1 2.9%, respectively and 42.3 \u00b1 3.0% and 26.6 \u00b1 3.9%, respectively (all P<0.001 vs placebo). However, the active-treatment LS means \u00b1 SE at the end of the study drug period were similar (CFA 88.7 \u00b1 1.8% vs 88.7 \u00b1 2.0%, respectively; CNA 83.7 \u00b1 2.1% and 86.3 \u00b1 2.7%, respectively). Similar patterns were observed for symptom improvement on study drug vs placebo by age (comparable in both age groups) and by EPI severity (greater improvement in subjects with severe EPI) although sample sizes were too small to reach meaningful conclusions. Fewer treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported on study drug than placebo irrespective of age and EPI severity. Study discontinuation due to the TEAE weight loss occurred in 1 patient one day after last day of study drug in the first cross-over period. There were no serious TEAEs and no differences between treatments in laboratory abnormalities.Conclusion: In this study, pancrelipase delayed-release 24,000-lipase unit capsules were effective in treating EPI due to CF and had a tolerable safety profile. Both younger and older patient groups experienced similar changes in CFA and CNA. Those with more severe EPI demonstrated greater improvement.Supported by Solvay Pharmaceuticals Inc., Marietta, GA, USA.

Patients were randomized to one of two treatment sequences for a period of 5 days: pancrelipase then placebo, or placebo then pancrelipase, with a washout interval of 3-14 days in between on their usual PERT. Dosing was targeted at 4,000 lipase units/g of dietary fat intake. Each patient received a prospectively designed diet to include at least 40% of calories derived from fat. The primary outcome measure was the coefficient of fat absorption (CFA); the study also investigated the coefficient of nitrogen absorption (CNA), stool output, clinical symptoms, and safety parameters.Results: Seventeen subjects were randomized (8 placebo then pancrelipase, 9 pancrelipase then placebo). One subject (pancrelipase then placebo group) withdrew consent in the first treatment period; 16 subjects completed the study. The median age was 8.0 years, 12 (70.6%) were male, and the mean daily lipase dose was 4,472 units/g fat consumed. CFA values were significantly greater on pancrelipase vs placebo, with least square (LS) means \u00b1 SE of 82.8 \u00b1 2.7% vs 47.4 \u00b1 2.7%, respectively (p<0.001). Similar results were observed for the CNA: 80.3 \u00b1 3.2% vs 45.0 \u00b1 3.2% (p<0.001). Stool output was significantly reduced with pancrelipase vs placebo: LS means \u00b1 SE for 72-hour stool weight (g) 166 \u00b1 28 vs 436 \u00b1 33 (p<0.001); 72-hour stool fat (g) 58 \u00b1 10 vs 183 \u00b1 10 (p<0.001); and stool frequency per day 1.9 \u00b1 0.2 vs 3.4 \u00b1 0.2 (p<0.001). Symptoms of EPI (abdominal pain, flatulence, and stool consistency) were improved with pancrelipase compared with placebo. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 5 (29.4%) patients taking pancrelipase vs 9 (56.3%) receiving placebo and were predominantly gastrointestinal events. There were no treatment discontinuations due to TEAEs, or serious TEAEs reported, in any patients receiving pancrelipase or placebo.Conclusion: In CF children with EPI, this new formulation of pancrelipase dramatically improved CFA, CNA, stool output and symptoms, and was safe and well tolerated in this study.Supported by Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Marietta, GA, USA.",

            "text": "There was a significant association between severity of CFTR mutations and development of pancreatitis, with patients carrying mild mutations more likely to develop pancreatitis (Table) . The odds ratio for developing pancreatitis with mild mutations was 2.2 (95% CI, 1.2-3.9; P=0.006) compared with intermediate and severe mutations. Patients with CFTR-PANC developed pancreatitis at a younger age (median, 15.7; range, 2.1-36.0) compared with 22.8; range, P=0.009) . There was no significant difference in gender ratio between the 3 groups. Overall, there was a difference in sweat chloride and FEV1 % predicted values between the 3 cohorts but these differences were not significant between CFPS-PANC and CFPS-NOPANC groups.Conclusion: There is an increased risk of developing pancreatitis in patients who carry functionally mild mutations and those who are in the mildest end of the spectrum of CFTR dysfunction develop pancreatitis at a younger age. Future studies are necessary to understand these observations. Apart from the risk of pancreatitis, there was no phenotypic difference between patients with CFPS-PANC and CFPS-NOPANC. Background: Australian guidelines for administration of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) recommend that enzymes should be distributed over the day based on the fat content of meals and should be taken before, or before and during the meal (1). These recommendations are however, consensus rather than evidenced based. Limited data exists as to how the timing of PERT in relation to a meal affects efficacy. Taylor et al. (2) showed that there was a mismatch between gastric emptying of PERT and a meal, with a mean difference of 67 minutes (range 3-129 minutes). Hence there may be a benefit in taking enzymes after a meal. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate whether PERT given before or after a meal resulted in improved lipase activity.",

The labeled isotope was ingested combined with a test meal after an overnight fast. Breath samples were collected and analysed for 13 CO 2 content. Results: On an individual level we were able to show significant improvements in the cumulative dose recovered (PCDR) of 13 C-MTG when the pattern of PERT was switched to either before or after the meal. Five subjects had a greater PCDR when PERT was taken 10 minutes before the test meal and five subjects when PERT was taken 10 minutes after the test meal. Improvements in the PCDR ranged from 0.69 -21.58%.The improvement in PCDR as measured by highest PCDR minus lowest PCDR was not correlated with gastric emptying rate (r= -0.31, p= 0.39).Conclusion: This small pilot study indicates that on an individual level there is a wide variation in PERT efficacy and that timing has an impact with 6 out of 10 patients having an improvement in PCDR of greater than 10% when the PERT pattern was changed. Clinically, improvements in lipase levels by 10% or more could result in improved nutritional outcomes or the requirement for less PERT. Further research is required to determine why patients benefited from either of the two patterns. A larger scale study may be able to find a correlation with gastric emptying rates. The impact of nutritional status on quality of life (QOL) is unknown for children with cystic fibrosis (CF). In the present study, potential associations between early growth response, nutritional status and multiple domains of quality of life are examined over 3 years in children aged 9-19 years.Methods: Patients (N=100; mean age = 13.6 \u00b1 2.8 years) were participants in the Wisconsin Randomized Clinical Trial of Cystic Fibrosis Newborn Screening. Beginning in 2002, the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire (CFQ) was administered yearly for approximately 3 years to assess QOL (observations=279). Seven CFQ dimensions were measured in both children and adolescents: physical functioning, emotional functioning, social, body image, eating disturbances, treatment burden and respiratory symptoms. These factors were standardized to a 0-100 point scale, with higher values representing better QOL. Height z-score (HtZ) and body mass index z-score (BMIZ), measured at the time of CFQ administration, and early growth response, characterized as the achievement of adequate weight gain within 2 years post-diagnosis (i.e., responder vs. non-responder), were evaluated using generalized estimating equations and included as covariates age, presence of meconium ileus at birth, pancreatic functional status and version of CFQ questionnaire.Results: Mean values of at least 80.0 were observed for physical functioning, emotional functioning, social, body image and eating disturbances. These dimensions also had the greatest proportion of scores equal to 100 (range 18% for social -62% for eating disturbances), and thus are subject to ceiling effects. Treatment burden (9% with score of 100, mean=65.2 \u00b1 19.8) and respiratory symptoms (8% with score of 100, mean=77.5 \u00b1 16.8) had the lowest mean values. No differences in CFQ dimensions were observed across the 3 yearly CFQ measures. HtZ was positively associated with eating disturbances (p=0.01) and BMIZ (p=0.01) was associated with higher scores for respiratory symptoms. Both HtZ and BMIZ, independent of each other, were positively associated (p<0.01) with physical functioning and body image. Early life growth response was associated with better scores for body image (p=0.01) and eating disturbances (p=0.045).Conclusions: Early growth response and concurrent nutritional status, as indicated by height and BMI z-scores, were positively associated with multiple dimensions of QOL in a population with high scores on most CFQ dimensions.(Supported by NIH Grants R01DK072126, R01DK34108 and Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics grant.)Conclusions: PANCREASE-MT compared to placebo significantly improved fat and protein absorption that was accompanied by marked improvements in EPI symptoms, stool consistency and CGI scores. No unexpected adverse events were reported in this population of patients with CF. Background: Carnitine deficiency has been previously described in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) based on plasma levels; however, plasma carnitine levels neither convey tissue status nor functional information. Carnitine plays a central role in beta oxidation, which has not been assessed in CF using current technology.",

Healthy subjects 6-18 years old served as a comparison group.Fasting plasma samples for both groups were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry for acetyl (C2) and palmitoyl (C16) carnitine esters, and the C2:C16 ratio was calculated, as measures of carnitine adequacy. Statistical analyses were performed using Spearman rank correlations for associations among variables and analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) for group differences adjusted for age and gender.Results: Seventy-four subjects (43 males, 10.9 \u00b1 3.0 years old) with CF participated, and 190 children (95 males, 10.8 \u00b1 3.3) served as a comparison group. The Table presents the medians [ranges] for the two groups for C2 and C16 carnitine esters, and for the C2:C16 ratio. In subjects with CF, the C2:C16 ratio declined significantly with age (r= -0.26, p=0.024). No significant age associations were found for the comparison group. After adjusting for age, gender and gender*group interaction, subjects with CF had significantly lower concentrations of C2 (p=0.038).Conclusions: Age affected acylcarnitine profiles in subjects with CF but not control subjects. These data suggest impaired flux through the fatty acid pathway and decreased acetyl CoA production which may be progressive with age, and may indicate an impairment of beta oxidation in children with CF and PI.Supported by NIDDK (R44DK060302), Clinical Translational Research Center (UL1RR024134), the Nutrition Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. Low weight for age is an independent risk factor for decline in pulmonary function. Growth retardation of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients has been attributed to malnutrition from loss of exocrine pancreatic activity and cachexia from bacterial colonization of the lungs. Significant advancements had suboptimal levels of vitamin K; in another study, 90% of CF patients receiving vitamin supplementation remained vitamin D deficient. Two studies (n=151) demonstrated that CF subjects receiving supplemental vitamin A had elevated serum retinol levels, and this suggests that other sources of vitamin A such as beta-carotene be considered. Based on the data from the literature review, SourceCF multivitamins were reformulated with increased amounts of vitamin D and vitamin K and a greater ratio of vitamin A in the form of beta-carotene while keeping the total retinol activity equivalents the same as the original formulations.Conclusions: Vitamin needs of CF patients are unique; knowledge surrounding these needs is limited yet dynamic. As new evidence becomes available, CF-specific vitamin products require modification. SourceCF vitamin products were reformulated based on current nutrition evidence. Vitamins D and K and beta-carotene were increased, and retinol decreased. The SourceCF multivitamins also contain B-complex vitamins, biotin, ascorbic acid, and zinc. The new formulation should either reduce the need to use or reduce the doses of single vitamin supplements, such as D and K, to meet the vitamin needs of CF patients. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of PANCREASE-MT capsules (MT 10.5 or MT 21) on the quantitative change in fat absorption in adults and adolescents/children with cystic fibrosis (CF) who had clinical symptoms of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). Secondary endpoints included the coefficient of nitrogen absorption (CNA, a gauge for protein absorption), clinical signs and symptoms of EPI, stool consistency, and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scores.",

When an optimal PANCREASE-MT dose was reached and the high fat diet was maintained for at least 3 days, subjects underwent the first 72 hour stool collection period to determine the open-label treatment coefficient of fat absorption (CFA). Subjects with a CFA \u226580% were randomized into the double-blind withdrawal phase to either continue on PAN-CREASE-MT or matching placebo. After a minimum of 24 hours in the double-blind phase, a repeat 72-hour stool collection was performed to determine the CFA of the double-blind phase. The CFA was determined by measuring both the fecal fat excretion and fat intake (g/day; a component of dietary data collection) during the stool collection periods.Results: Forty-nine subjects entered the open-label, run-in phase and 40 (14 adolescents 12 to <18 yrs; 26 adults \u226518 to 60 yrs) were randomized into the double-blind withdrawal phase. The mean CFA from open-label phase to the end of double-blind phase decreased slightly by 1.4% (88.2% to 86.8%) in subjects who continued to receive PANCREASE-MT compared with a decrease by 34.1% (90.5% to 56.4%) in subjects receiving placebo (between-group difference p<0.001).

            "text": "Background: Oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) followed by home serial capillary blood glucose (CBG) monitoring is the gold standard for determining glycaemic control in clinically stable adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) in the UK. However the OGTT only provides a \"snapshot\" of glucose handling at the time, classified as normal, impaired or diabetic glucose tolerance (NGT, IGT or DGT) according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. If abnormal, patients monitor serial CBG levels. CBG testing should be accurate to within 10% of corresponding plasma glucose levels, according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA). Continual glucose monitoring studies (CGMS) offer a novel approach in evaluating \"real life\" glycaemic control. A subcutaneous electrochemical sensor calculates interstitial glucose values every 5 minutes, producing a trace showing glucose trends for up to 72 hours. CGMS device calibration requires 4 CBG daily.Objective: We evaluated the accuracy of the CBG values compared with plasma glucose values, and CGMS glucose values compared with plasma glucose values, at the 0 and 2 hour time points of the OGTT.Methods: Twenty-seven clinically stable adults with CF commenced a 72 hour CGMS and attended the clinic for a 2 hour OGTT 1, 2 or 3 days later. They recorded 4 CBG daily during the monitoring period. During the OGTT, CBG and plasma glucose were taken immediately before and 2 hours after the standard glucose load (1.75g/kg up to maximum 75g). CGMS monitors were returned along with CBG results and downloaded sensor data was converted into a glucose trace using Solutions\u2122 (Medtronic) software. The absolute and percentage deviation of each CBG value and CGMS value from its concurrent plasma glucose value was determined and summary statistics were performed.Results: Three of 27 (11.1%) CGMS sensors failed before OGTT, leaving 24 patients' traces (48 paired data sets) available for analysis. Two of 48 BM readings and 6/48 CGMS sensor values were technically incorrect and excluded from analysis. Twenty-nine of 46 (63.0%) CBG levels were within 10% of their paired plasma glucose values. The mean (SD) and median [range] deviation of CBG from paired plasma glucose values were 9.6 (7. There were 20 complete sets of patient data with valid plasma and CGMS values for both time points. By OGTT 8 individuals had NGT, 4 had IGT and 8 had DGT. The CGMS 2 hour time point value agreed with the conventional OGTT value in 15/20 subjects, underestimated glycaemia in 3 and overestimated glycaemia in 2 cases.Conclusion: Accuracy of CBG monitoring did not meet ADA standards but was \"good\" in keeping with reported data from clinical settings. CGMS single time point values were accurate within limits reported in the literature. These single time point CGMS values should not be interpreted alone but in conjunction with other available objective and subjective measures of glycaemic control. Further evaluation of CGMS traces is required to establish the most valid and reliable means of interpretation. Objective: In the setting of cystic fibrosis, both diabetes (CFRD) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are associated with greater decline in pulmonary function. Further highlighting the importance of CFRD is the finding that CFRD is associated with increased mortality. Currently, IGT and CFRD are defined by two-hour plasma glucose (PG) during an OGTT, but PG abnormalities due to the delayed and blunted insulin secretion that are typical of CF, frequently are missed by the 2hr OGTT PG (PG2). The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between the 1hr OGTT PG (PG1) and pulmonary function in the pediatric CF population.",

Data analysis was limited to first-time OGTT (PG0, PG1, PG2) performed in the well state. Additional data collected included PFTs (FEV1 and FVC) performed as part of routine annual evaluations at the time of the OGTT and 1-yr later, body mass index% (BMI%), sputum colonization, age, and sex. OGTT were categorized according to PG2 as normal (PG2<140 mg/dL), IGT (PG2: 140-199 mg/dL), and CFRD (PG2> 200 mg/dL) and according to PG1 as normal PG1 (PG1<140 mg/dL), IGT PG1 (PG1: 140-199 mg/dL), and CFRD PG1 (PG1> 200 mg/dL). Multivariable linear regression was used to analyze the association between FEV1 and OGTT PG. Mixed effect models were used to determine the association of OGTT PG with FEV1 one year later.Results: OGTT were available in 106 children (63M/43F; age 5.8-22 yrs); complete PG data were available in 89. In general, the CF population was healthy: baseline FEV1% (51.5+SD)=95+18% and BMI%=52+25%. By PG2 criteria, 94 OGTT were normal, 10 IGT, and 2 CFRD. Of these 94 normal, 26% had IGTPG1 and 18% had CFRDPG. PG1 was negatively associated with FEV1 even after adjustment for sputum colonization and BMI% (partial beta-coefficient=-0.1, p=0.009, R2 0.13). FEV1% was not associated with PG0, PG2, age, or sex.Conclusions: Despite being classified as normal based upon the 2-hr OGTT PG, many individuals with CF have elevated 1-hr PG. The long-term implications of having an elevated 1-hr PG for individuals with CF is not known, but the association of increasing PG1 with worse pulmonary function suggests these early PG abnormalities may have deleterious effects. Introduction: Recent advances in the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) have led to an increase in life expectancy; as a consequence new issues and in particular renal disease such as oxalate nephropathy, pigmented tubulopathy and CF-related nodular glomerulosclerosis in the absence of diabetes mellitus are emerging in the CF population. The importance of this is highly relevant for patients with CF given the international guidelines state a creatinine clearance <50 mg/ml/min is a contraindication to lung transplantation.",

Forty percent (n=36) of patients had chronic renal impairment as defined by an eCrCl <90ml/min. Despite the high incidence of chronic renal impairment only 5.5% (n=2) of the patients had a raised serum creatinine level outside the laboratory reference range, both of whom had eCrCl <50ml/min. Spearman analysis shows there is a significant correlation between declining eCrCl and declining lung function (R=0.33, p=0.002) and independently between declining eCrCl with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization (r=0.247, p=0.02). Age, gender, CF related diabetes mellitus (CFRD), nebulised Tobramycin use and Azithromycin use did not correlate with eCrCl.Conclusion: Renal impairment is common in the adult CF population and is not confined to patients with CFRD. Serum creatinine levels alone are a very poor indicator for renal dysfunction in the CF population, identifying only 5% of patients with chronic renal impairment. This study highlights that with increasing survival and with consideration for lung transplantation there needs to be an increased consideration for regular eCrCl monitoring and caution in the use of potentially nephrotoxic medications.",

With this dramatic improvement in life expectancy comes the challenge of preparing the adolescent CF population for adulthood. A significant piece to this is engaging these youth in self-care, which will be critical in preventing life-threatening complications and improving quality of life.Until recently, self-care has received little attention in the CF population and educational materials and tools are limited. This lack of age-appropriate materials has made working with these teens challenging. Nursing practice would be much improved if self-care materials targeted at the adolescent and young adult CF population were available.This need prompted the writing of the booklet Cruising On, Next Stop...Adulthood. Successful Strategies for Adolescents and Young Adults with CF, which provides both a process and the necessary tools for implementing self-care in the CF population.The booklet, which is evidence-based and utilizes Orem's Self-Care Deficit Theory. The booklet has four chapters focusing on helping the teen and young adult with CF develop self-care skills, learn how to integrate these shills into their daily life, and how to handle some of the challenges chronically ill teens experience as they transition toward adulthood. Several tools have been developed to help the teen successfully create and implement their self-care plan.The CF Self-Care Questionnaire measures one's knowledge of CF and its treatment plan.The Body Check is a self-assessment and decision-making tool aimed at preventing CF complications. The Self-Care Schedule puts all the pieces of the treatment plan and life activities together in a daily schedule and The Self-Care Contract helps to gradually transfer CF cares from parent to teen.Several of these tools, which were developed to improve nursing practice in implementing self-care, can also be used for nursing assessment of CF patients and nursing education in CF. They can also easily be modified for use in self-care with other chronic pediatric diseases.Digestive Care Inc. provides complimentary copies of this booklet to every CF Center in North America as a service to the CF population. Methods: We analyzed the CF Patient Registry between 1992-2007 evaluating all patients age >18 years and their level of education, employment status, and insurance status with respect to measures of severity of disease including age, sex, forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1), and body mass index (BMI).Results: In 2007, 37.5% of patients were employed full-time, 17.3% part-time, 15.1% were disabled, and 7.9% were classified as unemployed. Although the numbers in each category have increased, these percentages have not changed since 1999. Prior to 1998, disabled patients were not categorized separate from unemployed, and the combination of the two has not changed since 1992. We found the same results for categories of level of education. In 2007, 8.6% of patients had not graduated high school, while 30.5% had graduated from college, which was no different than the percentages observed in 1995. For all categories of education and employment, there was a significant increase in median FEV1 (% predicted Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients have to spend a lot of time on inhalation every day. Patient adherence to inhaled medications is important for the outcome of clinical trials and interpretation of the results. Typically consumption of medication and diary entries are used to monitor adherence.In our study a modified investigational eFlow \u00ae nebulizer system was used for monitoring adherence of CF patients to their inhalation treatment. For each treatment the nebulizer stores data on a chip card that needs to be inserted into the nebulizer control unit to operate the nebulizer.The chip card is replaced every time the patient visits the clinic and downloaded onto a computer using the PARI Pharma Patient Monitoring Software. This software stores all data in a database and offers several reports. Adherence is calculated as the ratio of actual to planned inhalations and is shown graphically per study day and as cumulative adherence from the start of the study onwards. This provides immediate information about the patient's adherence to the study protocol.First results within an ongoing clinical trial have shown that adherence to the study protocol varies between patients. For non-compliant patients the adherence showed peaks directly before and after they visited the clinic. The additional patient monitoring feature offers the clinical trial investigators to intervene as soon as non-adherence is recorded and to interpret clinical data accordingly. Background: Treatment regimens for cystic fibrosis (CF) are time-consuming and complex, leading to consistently low rates of adherence. To date, few studies have evaluated the use of innovative technologies to improve adherence in this population. Current infection control guidelines for patients with CF prohibit face-to-face peer contact to minimize patientto-patient transmission of potential pathogens. Thus, interventions to improve adherence must be delivered individually, limiting opportunities for peer support. This study aimed to develop and assess a web-enabled cell phone, CFFONE \u00ae to provide CF care management information and support to improve adherence in adolescents with CF.",

            "text": "Methods: The acceptability, feasibility and utility of the CFFONE \u00ae was evaluated in a focus group with health care professionals (n = 17) and interviews and surveys with adolescents with CF ages 11 to 18 years old (n = 12), adults with CF ages 21 to 36 years old (n = 6), parents of adolescents or young adults with CF (n = 12), and technology experts (n = 8). In addition, adolescents tested a prototype of the CFFONE \u00ae (n = 9). Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from participants.Results: Focus group data with health care professionals indicated a need for this type of adherence intervention, and suggested that the CFFONE \u00ae would be likely to improve knowledge, adherence and social support. Adolescent, adults and parents all rated the CFFONE \u00ae as likely to improve adherence and management of the CF regimen. Technology experts rated the prototype design and format as appropriate.Conclusions: The current study provided strong support for this application of cell phone technology as an intervention to improve adherence in shown in Table 1 ). Even the patients classified as disabled had an increase in lung function with the median FEV1 reaching 40% predicted.Discussion: Although the number of adult patients is increasing, there has been no change in the general employment and educational status of patients. Overall health has improved, even in those patients receiving disability. This suggests that despite improving health status and development of adult CF programs, there has been no improvement in achievement of normal adult milestones for CF patients. (2) timeline, or views about the illness trajectory, particularly the cyclical nature of chronic disease; (3) consequences, or views about the expected outcome of the illness; and (4) control, or views on how to control symptoms. Using a validated illness perception questionnaire which we adapted for CF, we examined the relationship between illness perception and health status in a cohort of adults with CF.Methods: In the Project on Adult Care in Cystic Fibrosis (PAC-CF), a longitudinal panel study of adults with CF from 10 US CF centers, we administered a modified version of the Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised (IPQ-R). We assessed 5 subscales from the IPQ-R: treatment control (5 items), personal control (6 items), illness consequences (6 items), illness coherence (5 items), and illness timeline-cyclical (4 items). Each IPQ-R item is scored on a Likert scale of 1-5, with a composite score summed for each subscale. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to explore the associations between IPQ-R scores and demographic (age, gender) and health status indicators (lung function, BMI, change in lung function and BMI over time, frequency of pulmonary exacerbations, and presence of Pseudomonas and B. cepacia in respiratory cultures).Results: The IPQ-R was completed by 180 respondents (response rate 73%): 63% female, mean age 36.8\u00b110.2 years, mean FEV1 63\u00b123% predicted. Mean (\u00b1SD) IPQ-R domain scores were: treatment control 18.1\u00b13.0, personal control 24.6\u00b13.3, illness consequences 23.3\u00b13.9, illness coherence 19.6\u00b13.9, and illness timeline-cyclical 13.4\u00b12.7. In our regression models two common indicators of disease severity, lung function and BMI, were not associated with any IPQ-R scores. Increased frequency of pulmonary exacerbations was associated (p<.05) with increased perception of CF as cyclical (illness timeline-cyclical scale) but not with other IPQ-R subscales. Female gender was associated (p<0.05) with higher scores on both the personal and treatment control scales.Conclusions: In the PAC-CF cohort, clinical indicators of CF disease severity were not associated with illness perception. Most adults agreed that CF is a serious condition with major consequences but those with more severe disease did not see the consequences of the disease as more serious. Nor did those with more severe disease report that they have less personal control over the disease or that the treatments were less able to impact outcomes. Those who experienced a recent pulmonary exacerbation perceived their disease as more cyclical than those who had not had a recent exacerbation. Finally, age and gender were not associated with illness perceptions except that women reported higher levels of both personal and treatment control. Although HRQOL measures such as the CFQ-R have been developed for use as patient-reported outcomes, there is little data on changes in CFQ-R scores over time in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are not part of a clinical trial.",

The CFQ-R was administered to the PAC-CF cohort 7 times from April 2005 to January 2007. Individual longitudinal growth curve regression models were fit to each CFQ-R scale with clinical covariates provided by the sites.Results: Completed surveys were received from between 205 and 303 adults (response rate between 70% and 93%). Mean age of respondents at the first CFQ-R assessment was 33 years (range 19-64) and the mean FEV1 % predicted was 59.8% (SD 22%). Over 21 months of follow-up, FEV1 and number of exacerbations were significantly related to all physical domains of HRQOL, with the exception of digestive symptoms. Higher FEV1 was associated with greater HRQOL scores in all CFQ-R physical domains For example, a difference of 5% in FEV1 was associated with a difference ranging from 0.5 to 2.3 points in individual CFQ-R domain scores. Conversely, pulmonary exacerbations were associated with lower quality of life scores, as each exacerbation was associated with a decrease in CFQ-R domain scores ranging from -1.3 to -3.1 points. Weight was positively associated with scores in CFQ-R body image, eating disturbances, weight, and health perceptions domains. There were no significant population trends over time in the physical CFQ-R domain scores (physical functioning, body image, eating disturbances, digestive symptoms, respiratory symptoms, weight, health perceptions, vitality). However, there were longitudinal population time trends in 3 psychosocial CFQ-R domains: treatment burden (+8.9 points per year), emotional functioning (+3.2 points per year), and social functioning (-2.4 points per year). Individual variation in slopes was seen over 21 months in both physical and psychosocial subscales of the CRQ-R. For example, for 5%-95% of the population (excluding outliers), the range of linear slopes was -3.01 to +3.82 points per year for the respiratory subscale, -6.44 to +8.92 points per year for the weight subscale, and -5.54 to +2.83 points per year for the role subscale.Conclusion: In a population of adults with CF who are not part of a clinical trial, clinical variables such as FEV1, exacerbation frequency, and weight were correlated with scores on the matching subscales of the CFQ-R. For the population examined as a whole, psychosocial domains of HRQOL such as treatment burden and social functioning change over 21 months, but the physical domains such as respiratory functioning are stable. Despite this lack of trends over time in the population, there was substantial variation in the individual-level slopes in the physical domains of the CFQ-R over the 21 month period.",

CF Center, Hadassah Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel Background: Cross-sectional studies have shown that pregnancy/normal term delivery is safe for women with cystic fibrosis (CF), but may be a risk factor for women with advanced lung disease. The potential hazards may trigger a moral conflict between the caregiver's advice against pregnancy and the patient's desire for motherhood.Aim: 1. To compare the views of caregivers and women with CF with respect to pregnancy. 2. To analyze the relationship between the severity of the disease and the decision to become pregnant.Methods Objectives: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are increasingly being used in clinical trials and clinical care as health outcomes. Although assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in young children is challenging, they have a unique and important perspective on how cystic fibrosis (CF) affects their symptoms and daily functioning (e.g., school/daycare). HRQOL has been reliably evaluated in children with CF ages 6 and older using the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R). The CFQ-R is one of the most widely used HRQOL instruments for CF and was classified as \"well-established\" in a review of HRQOL measures (Palermo et al. J Pediatr Psychol 2008; 33:983) . The purpose of this study was to downwardly extend the CFQ-R for children 3-6 years of age using a pictorial format.Methods: The CFQ-R preschool version was adapted from the CFQ-R child (ages 6-13) version. Pictures were used to facilitate preschooler's responses, and items were modified to include appropriate developmental examples (see Figure 1 ). Following completion of the initial draft of the CFQ-R preschool version, psychometric properties were evaluated. Pediatric patients (ages 3-6) and their parents completed the CFQ-R and Ped-sQL, a generic measure of HRQOL. Background and medical information were also obtained.Results: Fifty-five pediatric patients (M = 4.89, SD = .88) and their parents in Australia participated. On average, children had mild lung disease as measured by FEV 1 % predicted (M = 93.46, SD = 17.12). Internal consistency (Cronbach \u03b1's) ranged from .60 to .68, with the exception of the Eating Disturbances, Treatment Burden, and Social Functioning scales. For the parent version, internal consistency was adequate to good (\u03b1 = .66 -.88), with the exception of the Health Perceptions, School and Emotional Functioning, and Vitality scales. These results suggest that some scales, such as Social Functioning, may not be appropriate for preschoolers and some questions need to be re-worded to improve the instrument's psychometric properties. Significant correlations were found between relevant CFQ-R and PedsQL scales for both the children (r's = .36 -.46) and parents (r's = .29 -.78), providing evidence of convergent validity. Good agreement was also found between children and parents on the Respiratory Symptoms scale (r =.44, p<.001).Conclusions: Preliminary evidence of reliability and validity of the CFQ-R preschool version was found; however, revisions to the preschool CFQ-R are needed, as well as further validation.Supported by NHMRC and RCHF Brisbane. incorporated demography, disease severity, personal opinion on pregnancy, open questions on anxiety during/after pregnancy. Results: Thirty-six patients (70% of all adult females with CF, mean age 27.5 yrs, FEV 1 57.5%, PI 71%, CFRD 41%) and 36 caregivers (average age 43.3 yrs, 11 male/25 female) from all CF centers in Israel responded to the questionnaire. Sixteen CF patients gave birth to 32 children. Caregivers, more than patients, perceived severity of disease to be the limiting factor in pregnancy. Both caregivers and patients agreed that high pulmonary functions (FEV 1 \u043c90%) are no obstacle to pregnancy, for moderate pulmonary functions (FEV 1 \u03f950%) caregivers more than patients advise to refrain from pregnancies. In contrast to patients, caregivers prefer the wellbeing of the patient over the health of the fetus. A relationship between religious observance of the patient and objection to abort were noted. Treatment compliance during pregnancy was higher than predicted by caregivers.Conclusions: A gap in the perception of pregnancy was observed between caregivers and CF patients. Pregnancy counseling should therefore be incorporated into the treatment plans for adult women at CF centers. Objectives: Numerous studies have demonstrated that patients with chronic illnesses are at increased risk for anxiety and depression; however, no systematic evaluation of symptoms of anxiety and depression in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) has been conducted (Quittner et al., 2008) . This study estimated the prevalence of anxiety and depression in patients with CF and parent caregivers and examined their relationship to health outcomes, such as pulmonary functioning and health-related quality of life (HRQOL).Methods: During a routine clinic visit, adult patients with CF and parent caregivers of children with CF completed two screening measures of depression and anxiety: the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Center for Epidemiological Studies -Depression (CES-D). Participants also completed a demographic and medical information form, which was confirmed by chart review. Adult patients also completed a disease-specific measure of HRQOL, the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R).Results: Forty-five adult patients (M = 30.51 years, SD = 9.18) and 11 parents (M = 40.0 years, SD = 7.65) participated. On average, adult patients had moderate lung disease as measured by FEV 1 percent predicted (M = 55.01, SD = 20.25). Furthermore, 15% of adult patients and 18% of parent caregivers were currently taking anti-depressant or anti-anxiety medications. In the adult sample, 33% endorsed elevated anxiety symptoms and 11% endorsed elevated depressive symptoms on the HADS. Adults reported slightly more symptoms of depression on the CES-D (16%) than the HADS (11%). Nine percent reported co-morbid depression and anxiety. Among parents, 46% endorsed elevated symptoms of anxiety, 27% endorsed elevated depressive symptoms on the HADS and CES-D, and 27% reported comorbid symptoms. Elevations in anxiety or depression were related to worse HRQOL. Specifically, anxiety was related to worse Role and Emotional Functioning (r's = -.33 to -.54). On the HADS, depressive symptoms were negatively related to Emotional Functioning, Body Image, Eating Disturbances, and Health Perceptions (r's = -.30 to -.42). Elevated scores on the CES-D were negatively related to a majority of CFQ-R domains (r's = -.30 to -.54). Patients currently on anti-depressant or anti-anxiety medications also reported worse Role Functioning (r = -.38).Conclusions: In general, higher rates of anxiety versus depression were reported by adult patients and caregivers. Both symptoms of anxiety and/or depression were related to worse HRQOL. Due to clinically elevated levels of anxiety and depression in CF patients and caregivers, routine screening during annual clinic visits is recommended. The current international prevalence study (tides-cf.org) will provide additional data.Funding provided by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Musculoskeletal pain is recognised as a complication in cystic fibrosis (CF) but the prevalence and clinical significance of this co-morbidity in adults with stable lung disease has not been well described. The aim of this study was to determine the location, intensity and experience of musculoskeletal pain and its impact on quality of life in individuals with CF. Participants with clinically stable CF from an outpatient clinic completed three questionnaires measuring the location, severity and degree of interference in daily activities of musculoskeletal pain (Brief Pain Inventory), the psychological impact of pain (Pain Catastrophising Scale) and quality of life (Cystic Fibrosis Quality of Life questionnaire). Seventy-seven participants with mean age 29 years (SD 8 years), FEV1 60 (25) % predicted were included. The prevalence of musculoskeletal pain was 89% and was not influenced by lung disease severity. Pain was commonly located in the back, buttocks and hips (70%), head and neck (52%) and lower limbs (29%). Although pain intensity was generally mild, participants with musculoskeletal pain reported poorer physical functioning (p=0.01) and increased interference with treatment aspects of CF (p=0.03) compared to those with no pain. Participants with symptoms of CF arthropathy reported greater intensity and impact of pain. Pain catastrophising and FEV1 were independent predictors of quality of life in adults with CF. Musculoskeletal pain is a significant complication which negatively influences quality of life in adults with stable CF. These results lend support to the inclusion of musculoskeletal pain screening as part of CF management. As the expected age of survival has increased so has the opportunity to meet major life milestones for adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). Recently, at the Adult Cystic Fibrosis Center in Morristown, the husband of a 37-year-old female patient had a stroke. Thankfully, he has fully recovered. However, long term financial planning is a new frontier for the CF care team. It cannot be assumed that our patients will die before their spouse. Patient education in regards to insurance needs has been focused on health insurance, but perhaps should be expanded to include life insurance.",

            "text": "Methodology: This retrospective chart review included married patients who had been asked about the possession of life insurance for themselves and/or their spouse. Information obtained included: 1) gender, 2) age, 3) employment status, 4) life insurance of spouse, 5) life insurance of patient.Results: Of the 80 patients presently attending our adult CF center, 34 of them are married (42.5%). Upon chart review, 15 (44%) of the patients who are married had information regarding their life insurance status and that of their spouse. The females numbered 11 (73%) and males 4 (27%). Age range of these patients is 21-59 years with a mean age of 38.7 years. Ten patients (67%) are employed full or part-time. The number of spouses of our married adult patients who have life insurance are 13 (87%), with 11 (73%) of our patients owning some life insurance policy. Three (20%) patients were late-diagnosed adults and had purchased additional life insurance prior to their diagnosis.Limitations: This is a small sample from only one center. Documentation was not complete on amount of life insurance coverage. Patients and spouses may be underinsured. Focus was only on married adults, single adults should also be evaluated in the future. Discussion: As the expected age of survival increases, our adult patients move through different adult milestones. The CF healthcare team should expand the area in which we educate our patients, in preparation for these milestones. It can no longer be assumed that our married patients will not be surviving partners. The healthcare team can be proactive in guiding and educating our married patients to pursue appropriate financial and estate planning with their spouses. All adult CF patients need to understand that they may be eligible for life insurance provided by their employer and/or union and be encouraged to take advantage of that benefit as soon as possible. Greater awareness and sensitivity on the part of practitioners working with CF patients is needed to educate and prepare proactively, rather than providing aid to families in a difficult period like an untimely death. Results: In total, 865 adults with CF (M = 30.6 years, SD = 8.5; 55% male) completed the survey. The sample was predominantly Caucasian (95.2%; 2.2% Hispanic, 1.6% African American, 1% Other). Most participants reported being diagnosed at \u2264 1 year of age (60.2%, M = 4.8 years, SD = 8.3, range = 1-67 years).

Pediatrics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA Objective: Research has shown that rates of medical regimen adherence for children diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (CF) are less than 50% and that adherence tends to decline during adolescence. To address this concern, researchers have begun to develop intervention programs designed to promote adherence. One promising intervention, developed by Alexandra Quittner, utilizes a problem solving approach between CF patients and their families. Based on this work, the \"CF My Way\" program was created by an interdisciplinary team of CF clinicians to meet the need for an intervention that can be implemented within a CF Center. The objective of this pilot project was to examine the clinical utility of \"CF My Way.\"Methods: Four CF Centers across the United States participated in the pilot of \"CF My Way.\" Data are reported from 12 patients from our center and 13 patients from across all four centers. Patients ranged in age from 14 to 20. Adolescent patients were asked to participate in the pilot program during a routine clinic appointment or an inpatient hospitalization. Participation included completing an electronic knowledge assessment, reporting rates of adherence, identifying barriers to adherence, and engaging in a problem solving session with a family member. Following participation, patients had the option to provide feedback on the program. Results: For the 12 patients from our center, the average score on the knowledge assessment was 90% with highest average scores in the Lung Health section (92%) and lowest scores in the Nutrition section (84%). All patients identified at least one area of their medical regimen where they were less than 100% adherent (average number of problem areas=3.75, range=1-12) with 50% choosing to focus on adherence to nebulized medications. The most common barriers identified included forgetting, lack of time, and low motivation to complete treatments. Each of the 12 patients was able to choose a solution with a family member with 40% choosing a solution involving obtaining an incentive/reinforcement for adherence, 35% choosing a solution involving use of a reminder, and 25% choosing a solution to increase the ease or decrease the time associated with treatment completion. Themes from 13 patients across the four sites who provided feedback on the program suggest that patients thought that the program increased their understanding of CF, helped them to realize that their adherence was poor, and identified ways to overcome barriers to adherence. However, one to two weeks after the session, only half of the participants reported that they were implementing the solution generated. Parental support was identified as a key factor related to patients continuing to implement their solution. Background: Transition of young adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) from pediatric to adult care programs is an important priority as the majority of individuals with CF are living well into their fourth decade and almost 45% are over 18 years old.",

Transition cases were identified using CF Program ID change from pediatric to adult program for all 18-25 year olds who transferred between 2003 through 2007, and who had at least three years of consecutive data (one year prior, the year of, and one year following transfer). Descriptive statistics were performed. Data from subjects cared for in combined pediatric/adult CF Programs were excluded from this analysis.Results: There were 406 patients, aged 18-25, who had a single change from a Pediatric to Adult CF Program ID between the years 2003-2007, which is 9.4 percent of all \"eligible\" patients (406/4331). The mean age of patients in their year of transfer was 21.2 \u00b1 1.3 years. Cases who transitioned care were less likely to be female (49% vs 54%, p=0.03), were younger (21.2 vs 22.3, p<0.001), had on average more outpatient visits per year (4.5 vs 4.0, p=0.001), higher mean number of respiratory cultures per year (2.8 vs 2.4, p<0.001) and higher FEV1 % predicted (67 vs 65, p=0.05) than patients who did not transfer to an Adult CF Program. There were no differences in mean BMI % predicted, mean hospitalizations per year, or mean FVC % predicted between the two groups.Conclusions: Patients who were transferred to an Adult CF Program were more often male, younger, had higher mean FEV1 % predicted, and seen more often in the outpatient setting than those that remained in pediatric care. Further research is needed to explore the relationship between CF transition practices and health status outcomes in order to establish a systematic, evidence-based transition process.",

Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, USA Background: In 2007, our pediatric cystic fibrosis (CF) care center recognized the need for a formal transition process and subsequently developed a program called Journey to Independence. Program objectives include: Assess patients' transition readiness; offer opportunities for patients to discuss concerns and ask questions independent of parent input; establish educational goals and create homework assignments in order for patients to meet those goals; and increase involvement with the adult care team.Methods: The Journey to Independence program is composed of five stages: Scout (ages 8-10); Explorer (ages 11-13); Trail Guide (ages 14-15); Deputy (age 16); and Park Ranger (ages 17-18). Each stage includes five components with specific educational objectives: Understanding CF; Respiratory; Nutrition; Treatment; and Lifestyle. To obtain the objectives in each stage, patients are required to complete various assignments. A patient in the Park Ranger Stage is expected to: Describe his daily medication and treatment regimen (My Med Sheet); create a weekly food diary (My Meal Plan); determine who to call with certain health related questions (Who You Gonna Call?); and identify and describe how to meet potential challenges of selfcare (Challenges to Independence). In addition, patients in the Deputy Stage are required to attend their clinic appointments without parental accompaniment (solo clinic visits). Parents are asked to remain in the waiting room until the end of the visit, when they are invited to the room to address their Conclusions: This pilot project supports the clinical utility of \"CF My Way.\" Adolescent patients described the program as informative and valuable, were able to complete the program components within a medical setting, and effectively worked with a family member to develop an acceptable solution. However, only half of adolescents actually implemented the solution. Future trials of this program should emphasize parental support and involve follow up with the adolescents after participation.Supported by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.

            "text": "Methods: In 2001, the game \"My Life\" was developed and proven effective. The game was designed to improve decision making and problem solving skills of adolescents. Game participants live out the life of a fictional character. Participants decide how to assign available \"effort points\" (or time) among a variety of \"possessions\" (or activities). How participants spend their effort points will influence and shape their character's life. The game is designed to be statistically similar to chances in real life. Post game discussions reinforce lessons learned in the game and link the events and decisions to the participant's own life. \"My Life with CF\" was adapted from the original \"My Life\" game except the fictional character has CF. Participants also make decisions regarding nutrition, treatments, and medications. The game incorporates realistic projections of the effects of the disease and adherence to treatment on the life of the fictional characters with CF.Sixteen participants with CF, between the ages of 12-20, were enrolled in the study. They completed 4 Attitude Assessment Scales before the game. Attitude scales were completed again immediately after playing the game and one month later. Seven of the participants returned the forms at one month. Attitude Scales 1, 2 and 3 were previously validated. Attitude scale 4 was created specifically for the \"My Life with CF\" game. Each attitude scale has 20 questions and is based on a Likert-type scale. Scale 1 assesses personal invulnerability Scale 2 assesses present versus future considerations Scale 3 assesses luck versus effort Scale 4 has an equal number of questions from the above three categories, specific to CF therapy.Results: Changes in scale scores over time are summarized in the scale below:Participants' feedback: I learned how decisions you make early on can have an effect on your life later on.I stay up as long as I have to to finish my treatments.The game really made me think about how I want to live.

Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada Background: Quality of life (QOL) is increasingly recognized as an essential component of assessing new therapies and individualizing patient care, so much so that the FDA now mandates the inclusion of a QOL measure in evaluations of new therapies. Cystic fibrosis (CF) imposes unique effects upon the QOL of those affected as there may be multiple organ systems involved, treatment may be complex, time-consuming and require conscientious effort, and end-of-life decisions may be faced many years before an individual's peers.In earlier work (Gilljam M. Pediatr Pulmonol 2002;S24:348), a CF-specific QOL instrument was developed with input from multiple individuals with CF and their medical caregivers from three countries. Using frequency-importance ranking for item-reduction, 150 potential questions were distilled to the 40 most important, thus creating the CF-QUEST. This process was done in English and Swedish.The aims of this study were to test the validity and responsiveness to clinical change of the CF-QUEST by comparing it to other QOL measures, physical measures of health, complexity of disease, treatment burden and response to therapy for an acute infective exacerbation.Methods: The CF-QUEST was administered to adults with CF who were deemed to be clinically stable, and to a second group who were experiencing an infective exacerbation of pulmonary disease. This second group completed all assessments on two occasions, once at the start of the exacerbation and then again when they had completed treatment and returned to baseline; clinically stable patients completed all measures once only. Other existing QOL instruments were concurrently administered: a general health QOL questionnaire (SF-36), a respiratory QOL questionnaire (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire), a CF specific QOL questionnaire (the CFQ-R Adult) and a Visual Analogue scale. Measures of physical health that were assessed for correlation included pulmonary function tests, vital signs, sputum pathogens, body mass index (BMI), CF-related co-morbidities and daily treatment time.Results: Over the initial ten weeks, the CF-QUEST has been administered to 58 adults with CF; recruitment is ongoing. Forty men and eighteen women have been included, with ages ranging between 18 to 63 years. The FEV1 of the participants has ranged between 22 to 103 percent predicted.An interim analysis of the data currently available has revealed that there is a significant correlation between the CF-QUEST score and other QOL tools (Spearman r = 0.84 for Mental health component of SF-36). With a target of 100 adults, we anticipate recruitment will be complete by the end of July 2009.",

Psychopharmacologic treatment of ADHD was attempted in 13 (72%) of cases.Psychopharmacologic \"Best Regimens\" included stimulants in 5 cases, with ADHD monotherapy in 9 cases and a combination of 2 ADHD medications in 3 cases. A Clinical Global Improvement (CGI) rating of Much Improved or Very Much Improved was achieved in 8 (62%) of the 13 cases in which ADHD medications were tried. These well tolerated and effective regimens included atomoxetine; atomoxetine + guanfacine; mixed amphetamine salts; buproprion XL + OROS-methylphenidate; methylphenidate; nortriptyline; nortriptyline + guanfacine.While ADHD medication trials were not generally associated with clinically significant BMI changes, a significant drop in BMI occurred with some stimulant trials. Nortriptyline use was associated with a robust increase in BMI percentile, from 22% to 61% in one case and from 34% to 76% in another case.Conclusions: ADHD is common and treatable in pediatric CF patients and often occurs in conjunction with other psychiatric conditions. Non-stimulant medications are frequently effective in this population and may be better tolerated than stimulants in patients at risk for weight loss. Further investigation of the effects of ADHD on medical treatment adherence in CF and of psychosocial and psychopharmacologic treatments for ADHD in the CF population is warranted. ",

Pediatric, Meyer Hospital, Florence, Italy Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF), as a multi-organ disease affecting nutrient absorption and assimilation, often impacts the ability of patients to achieve and maintain adequate body weight. This aspect of the illness could in turn render a patient weaker and less ready to confront an exacerbation of their condition. It is therefore frequently recommended that patients maintain a high calorie diet and sufficient body weight, especially during moments when the effects of the illness are most severe. For this reason, body image and the relationship with the body in general is often stressed in patients with CF.Objectives: The study seeks to determine if there is a correlation between levels of anxiety and depression and body image in CF patients.Method: The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire was administered to 69 patients, 37 females of mean age 27.63y (\u00b16.66), BMI 20.92 (\u00b13.24) and 32 males of mean age 29.86y (\u00b110.15), BMI 22.32 (\u00b14.05) during routine clinical checks.Result: A significant difference in the body image of male and female CF patients was found.The BMI of male patients negatively correlated with levels of anxiety (r=-.386,p<.05), while the BMI of females positively correlated with both levels of anxiety (r=.377,p<.05) and depression (r=.406,p< .05).Conclusion: This study discovered differences in the emotional states of males and females CF patients with a normal BMI, the latter group showing higher levels of anxiety and depression as BMI increased. It is possible that this mirrors a difference which can be found in the healthy population, where a strong body reinforces male identify, while an increase in body weight has a negative impact on female self-image.With regards to females, this study demonstrates that CF patients have the same mental constructs of body image as their healthy peers and seek to achieve the same \"slim\" body image. However, this could represent a risk for this group as it may impact adherence to a high calorie diet, enzyme therapy and supplementation, presenting the possible need for psychological intervention for correct clinical management.Supported by: Italian CF Foundation",

A score of less than 70% on a CFQ-R domain (10-20% below the median on any domain) was designated as a \"CFQ problem score.\" MSAS item and domain scores >1 were considered an \"MSAS problem score\" based on published validation statistics. Additional questions assessed abdomen, chest, limb, and joint pain, consistency with treatments, and presence of pancreatic insufficiency. Analysis methods included the non-parametric Mann Whitney U to compare medians and chi-square or Fisher's Exact test for dichotomous variables. Pearson correlation coefficients were evaluated. Exact statistical methods were used to adjust for the small sample size.Results: Body Image: Eight of 25 (40%) of responders had \"CFQ problem scores.\" CFQ-R Social (p<.001) and Emotional (p=.03) domain scores were significantly lower for those with body image \"CFQ problem scores.\" MSAS Physical domain scores were significantly higher for those with body image \"CFQ problem scores\" (p=.04). Patients with pancreatic insufficiency were more likely to have a problem score (56.3%) compared to those not having a problem score (11.1%) (p=.04). Pain: Eight of 25 (32%) patients indicated having frequent pain. Forty-eight percent and 44% experienced pain in their limbs and joints respectively. Of respondents who indicated frequent pain 62.5% were severely depressed (CES-DC). The MSAS pain score highly correlated with MSAS Lack of Energy (r=.57), Drowsy (r=.7) and Worry scores (r=.59). Sleep: Five of 24 (20.8%) patients had MSAS Sleep domain scores greater than 1. Sleep scores highly correlated with MSAS Lack of Energy (r=.5) and Drowsy (r=.63). MSAS sleep scores tended to be higher for patients with severe depression (CES-DC) (p=.07).Depression/Anxiety: Eight of 13 (61.5%) patients completing the CES-DC were severely depressed. Four of 13 (30.8%) on the HADS were highly anxious and 2 were mildly depressed. Patients positive on the HADS were positive on the CES-DC. MSAS Psychological domain scores were significantly higher for depressed patients (p=.01).Conclusion: Results suggest that pediatric patients with CF have a negative perception of their bodies, experience significant sleep problems, have limb and joint pain, and suffer from severe depression/anxiety. Based on these results, we will continue data collection to further examine the impact of these symptoms on QOL. Our ultimate goal is to improve the lives of patients with CF through a better understanding of their physical, emotional, and social functioning. The results of this study will aid in the development, implementation, and evaluation of future interventions. Methods: Retrospective chart review of patients aged 5-18 in the MGH Cystic Fibrosis Program referred from 8/05-12/08 for outpatient child psychiatric consultation and diagnosed with ADHD using DSM-IV-TR criteria. Treatment outcomes were assessed from recorded clinical data including MGH ADHD Rating Scales prospectively completed by the child psychiatrist, parents, and/or teachers as well as retrospective clinician determinations of severity and response following interventions. For each patient who underwent ADHD medication trials, the \"Best Regimen\" resulting in greatest improvement in ADHD symptoms with the least clinically significant side effects was identified.",

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by progressive decline in lung function up to the end-stage of respiratory failure. The impact of CF on pulmonary function might affect the ability to obtain refreshing sleep.

Furthermore, the study will investigate the causes and the impact of sleep problems.Method. Only CF patients with FEV1 >50% were included in this study. A self-report sleep questionnaire made up of 17 items was administered to 27 adults with CF: 15 females of mean age 24.96 y (\u00b110.51), and 12 males of mean age 21.35 y (\u00b18.94). The same test was administered to 27 adults of a control group: 15 females of mean age 22.33 y (\u00b16.77), and 12 males of mean age 25.78 y (\u00b17.43).A self-report sleep questionnaire with 19 items was also administered to 10 parents of children with CF, 5 females and 5 males, of mean age 9.79 y (\u00b11.79). The same test was administered to 10 parents of healthy children, 5 females and 5 males, of mean age 10.63 y (\u00b12.97).Results. Of the CF patients who responded, 21.6% experienced sleep problems while only 10.8% of control group who responded reported problems (t-test, p=.045). Differences between CF patients and the control group have emerged. CF patients reported difficulty with dry mouth upon awakening due to open-mouth breathing (t-test, p=.027 and p=.016). In the CF patients FEV1 is negatively correlated with facility in falling asleep (r=-.331, p<.05). There are significant correlations between CF adults and healthy adults about the modality of sleep (r=.296, p<.05), the facility of awakening (r=.475, p<.05), the feeling of awakening (p=.376, p<.001) and the quality of their sleep (r=.315, p<.05).Conclusion. The results of the present investigation have revealed that sleep problems appear to be significant in people with CF. In CF subjects, high levels of FEV1 are accompanied by a greater facility to fall asleep. Compared to the control group, the CF group has shown greater difficulties in falling asleep and this is the cause of a greater fatigue and sleepiness when awakening. For these reasons the quality of sleep perceived is worse in CF patients than in the control group. These results suggest that the CF patients show meaningful levels of sleepiness in the morning.How much could this be correlated with the patient's Quality of Life? ",

            "text": "Background: Numerous studies have demonstrated that individuals with cystic fibrosis are at increased risk for developing psychological difficulties such as anxiety and depression. As these psychological outcomes can vary considerably across affected individuals, it is necessary to identify which factors are associated with these individual differences in outcome. A potentially protective factor in these individuals' psychological functioning is acceptance.Objective: This study aims to prospectively investigate the role of acceptance in anxiety and depression in adolescents with cystic fibrosis. Thereby, this study replicates and extends existing research that has heavily relied on cross-sectional methods. We expected that higher levels of acceptance would be related to lower levels of anxiety and depression.Methods: Forty adolescents with cystic fibrosis (14-22 years) completed the Illness Cognition Questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Inventory (Time 1). After 6 months, 28 of these adolescents again completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Inventory (Time 2).",

            "text": "A set of hierarchical regression analyses was performed to examine the role of acceptance in the psychological functioning of these adolescents. Acceptance at Time 1 was related to both anxiety (\u03b2=-.49, p<.05) and depression (\u03b2=-.41, p<.05) at Time 1. Acceptance at Time 1 was also related to depression at Time 2 (\u03b2=-.49, p<.05).Conclusions: As expected, higher levels of acceptance were related to lower levels of anxiety (Time 1) and depression (Time 1 and 2) . These results suggest that acceptance (a) should be taken into account in the multidisciplinary treatment of those individuals with cystic fibrosis who exhibit psychological difficulties, and (b) can be an important factor in the prevention of depression. Furthermore, addressing depression might also have indirect positive consequences on health outcomes, as depression is related to poorer treatment adherence and disease management.Acknowledgements Objective: Youths with cystic fibrosis (CF) may be at increased risk for internalizing symptoms such as anxiety and depression, but little research has examined risk factors that may increase risk for developing such problems among youth with CF. Monitoring, a cognitive-affective information processing style characterized by a tendency to scan for, attend to, and magnify threatening cues when stressed, was recently found to be a concurrent correlate of increased internalizing symptoms (Bennett et al., 2008) . The purpose of the present study was to examine whether monitoring and blunting, which is characterized by the use of distraction or ignoring when stressed, predict increases in future internalizing symptoms.Methods: Participants (ages 7 to 23; current n=43) attending a regularly scheduled CF clinic visit completed the Children's Behavior Style Scale (Miller et al., 1995) to assess monitoring and blunting at two time points separated by 2 years. Participants and a parent also completed measures of participants' internalizing symptoms (Children's Depression Inventory-Short form [CDI-S], Kovacs, 1992; Pediatric Symptom Checklist, Jellinek, Murphy, & Burns, 1986 ; State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children [STAIC], Spielberger, 1973) at both time points.Results: Youth who were relatively high on monitoring and low on blunting (i.e., high monitoring -blunting scores) had increased internalizing symptoms at time 2 on each of the three internalizing measures. Controlling for time 1 depressive symptoms (CDI-S), monitoring-blunting at time 1 predicted greater depressive symptoms at time 2 (r = .31, p < .05). Similarly, controlling for time 1 trait anxiety (STAIC), monitoring-blunting at time 1 predicted greater trait anxiety symptoms at time 2 (r = .32, p < .05). Finally, controlling for time 1 internalizing symptoms (PSC), monitoring-blunting at time 1 predicted increased parent-rated internalizing symptoms at time 2 (r = .39, p < .05).Conclusion: An affective information-processing style characterized by relatively high monitoring and low use of blunting appears to place youths with CF at increased risk of future internalizing symptoms.The objective interpretation of the results of the CFQ is restricted by the lack of reference data from a healthy population. The aim of this study was to collect these reference data.Subjects and methods: A cross-sectional study was done. A multistage, random sample was taken from all primary and secondary schools in the city of Nijmegen. The CFQ was completed by 491 healthy children and adolescents (age groups: 6-11, 12-13 and \u2265 14 yrs). Children with a chronic disease or visiting a paediatrician were excluded. Specific disease-related questions were omitted in the results.Results: In this population the average score was between 80-90 per domain on a scale from 0-100. Lower scores were reported in the domains Emotional State in all age groups and Vitality in the age group \u2265 14 yrs. The domain Body Image scored significantly lower in the age group \u2265 14 yrs (p < 0.01). Boys \u2265 14 yrs showed higher scores in the domains Emotional State, Physical, Eating and Health Perception compared to girls. No relationships were found between education or socioeconomic status and CFQ scores. The age group \u2265 14 yrs showed consistent results in all domains (Cronbach's alpha \u2265 0.6). In the age groups 6-11 and 12-13 yrs the CFQ consistency was slightly lower in some domains (Cronbach's alpha 0.3-0.8).Conclusion: Mean CFQ scores in the healthy population are not constant across the ages; this should be considered when interpreting the CFQ scores in CF patients. Trends in generic domains can not only be explained by having CF as there is also a trend visible in the different healthy age groups. These CFQ reference data are unique and provide objective criteria to define abnormal versus normal CFQ scores in CF patients. Objective: Interest in exercise has increased recently because of its health benefits for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). In randomized controlled trials, exercise improved lung function, muscle strength, and quality of life (1) . There is also evidence that patients with good aerobic fitness have better survival than those with lower levels of fitness (2) . More CF care teams have been recommending exercise to their patients, with 24.6% of CF centers now prescribing exercise as a primary or secondary airway clearance technique (3) . This study examined daily exercise patterns in a large sample of adolescents with CF using a daily phone diary (DPD) measure.",

Of the 117 families eligible for the study, 103 had DPD data at baseline and were included in the current study. Mean age of the participants was 13.4 years (SD = 1.8), approximately half were female (47%), and mean FEV 1 % predicted was 82.1%.The DPD is a phone-based diary that measures activities, companions, and mood over a 24-hour period using a cued-recall procedure (4) . For all activities lasting longer than five minutes, adolescents reported the type of activity, duration, who was present, and a mood rating. A set of 3 DPDs (2 weekdays, 1 weekend day) was collected for each participant at each assessment. Mood was rated on a five-point Likert scale (1= Very Negative, 3= Neutral, 5= Very positive).Results: A majority of the respondents reported completing some exercise over the three-day period (N= 54, 52.4%), with 137 exercise activities reported. The most frequent activities were biking (N= 23 activities, 16.8% of activities), playing sports at home, like basketball (N= 23, 16.8%), and swimming (N= 14, 10.2%). The duration of these activities was generally long, but there was a great deal of variability (mean= 51.9 minutes, SD= 48.5). Mood ratings during exercise were quite positive (mean= 4.07, SD= 0.56, range= 2 to 5). Of those teens who exercised, only 24.1% reported doing so alone, with 35.9% exercising with family members and 20.4% exercising with friends. No difference was found in FEV 1 % predicted between those who did and did not exercise (FEV 1 = 85.0% predicted vs. 81.9%; t= 0.31, p> .05).Discussion: A majority of adolescents with CF reported engaging in exercise activities as part of their daily routine. Exercise typically consisted of informal physical activities at home rather than organized sports, and often included family members and peers. Statistically significant differences in pulmonary functioning between teens who exercised and teens who did not exercise were not found. Future directions include examining prospective, rather than correlational associations between exercise and Grossoehme, D.H. 1, 3 ; Cotton, S. 2 ; Ragsdale, J. 3 ; Seid, M. 4, 1 1.

            "text": "Methods: This qualitative Grounded Theory study used semi-structured interviews of parents of children diagnosed with CF in the past year. A theoretical model of parental use of R/S during this period was created, centered on a \"core dimension\" (the most fruitful explanation for the social process being examined) and subsidiary, \"primary dimensions\" (the means by which the core dimension proceeds).Results: Fifteen children (3-17 mos) were diagnosed with CF during this period. Of all parents approached, 88% agreed to participate; 15 interviews were completed; 9 were mothers. All self-identified as Caucasian; 6 were Catholic, 5 Baptist, 4 Christian. The core dimension is that R/S helps parents make meaning. One primary dimension by which this occurs is viewing God as a personal, active and intervening God (\"We tried for year and a half to have another child and we couldn't. My husband started to think there was something wrong. I said, 'No, when God wants us to get pregnant, He'll make sure we get pregnant. Then my daughter was diagnosed; I said, 'I know why now we didn't get pregnant. I didn't wanna be pregnant but God said, \"No, you're gonna have another one\u2026obviously, He had His plan and I had mine and He just overruled my plan\"). A 2nd is feeling supported by God (\"\u2026moments I feel so helpless but I know that He knows what that feels like because He had to watch Jesus, you know. So I try to also put that in perspective that He understands. I'm very thankful He trusted me enough to give N. to me. She's a lot of hard work; it's awesome to be loved enough by God to be honored to have her. Everything we've been through, we haven't gone through alone; God has been there. He has given strength to us. It's not Him that's doing this to her; it's through Him that we're getting through this\"). Finally, by finding hope (\"I know God doesn't give me more than I can handle; God has more confidence in me than I have in myself\"). More parents reported religious beliefs relating to decision-making or adherence than not (e.g., \"the whole g-tube thing for me was huge\u2026we used prayer instead and thanks to God she doesn't need one\" and \"faith\u2026helps me do things I need to do that aren't easy, like the wound care \u2026it's hard to hurt her but\u2026God gives me strength to go through with it.\"). Stories describing a relationship with God/Higher Power appear to provide the most significant meaning, versus religiosity based on received instruction from one's faith group.Conclusions: R/S is an important part of making meaning, providing hope, and contributing to decision-making and adherence. CF teams should consider chaplains a standard element of care offered. This model can be the basis of psychosocial interventions, including those aimed at improving adherence.",

Department of Medical Psychology, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, Netherlands Background: Optimizing Quality of Life (QoL) is considered an important goal in the management of patients with a chronic disease. The cystic fibrosis (CF) specific questionnaire (CFQ) has been developed as a tool to monitor QoL in CF patients.Admissions for intravenous antibiotics are an important part of the maintenance of lung function in cystic fibrosis (CF). Admissions involve a multidisciplinary team and patients typically interact with many \"microsystems\" within the inpatient setting, including radiology, interventional radiology, pharmacy, and operating rooms which can impact the inpatient experience. Inpatient therapy often lasts 1-3 weeks, and the success of therapy is generally based on objective measures such as lung function. Although useful, objective measures alone fail to capture many aspects of the inpatient experience important to patients and families. The Healthcare Matrix is a tool that was developed to link the Institute for Medicine aims for improvement in healthcare and the six ACGME Core Competencies for healthcare providers (1, 2) . It provides a conceptual framework that projects an episode of care as an interaction between quality outcomes and the skills, knowledge, and attitudes of healthcare providers necessary to effect those outcomes. Previous use of the matrix has primarily depended upon healthcare provider assessment of episodes of care. The purpose of this study was to assess whether the Healthcare Matrix can be used as a tool to allow CF patients and families to evaluate the inpatient hospitalization, combining it with typical objective measures of improvement such as improved lung function.Methods: CF patients admitted to the hospital for pulmonary exacerbations had measurements of lung function, oximetry, and weight done on admission and at twice weekly intervals. A subjective analog score of health was completed on admission and weekly. Completion of a Healthcare Matrix questionnaire was done by parents (and patients) and discussed at a weekly care conference with the attending physician, residents, and multidisciplinary team present. The Matrix as completed by the parent/patient (score: 0 or 1) assessed whether the hospital stay was: 1) Safe; 2) Timely; 3) Efficient 4) Equitable; and 5) Patient-and family-centered. Effectiveness was assessed using improvements in lung function, weight, and oxygen levels as well as the subjective improvement score. The health care team was judged for 1) Overall care; 2) Medical knowledge; 3) Interpersonal and communication skills; 4) Professionalism; and 5) Integrated performance of the inpatient microsystems.Results: The Matrix Score can be used to define parent, patient and caregiver-agreed perfect care as well as providing immediate feedback from patients and families on opportunities for team learning and improvement. Changes in Health Matrix scores over time provide an assessment of how hospital systems are meeting the needs of CF patients and families. Gould, A.L.; McGeachey, A.; Mantell, P.; Riale, S.; Sawicki, G.S. Childrens' Hospital-Boston, Boston, MA, USA Background: Airway clearance treatments (ACT) using chest physical therapy (CPT), high frequency chest compression vest (HFCC), or other modalities, are an essential part of the management of pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). At Children's Hospital Boston due to staffing and time constraints, hospitalized patients with CF received 3 ACT each day between 8:30 am and 5:00 pm. Although optimal frequency of ACT during treatment for PEx is undetermined, increasing the frequency of these ACT may improve patient outcomes. We therefore implemented a quality improvement (QI) initiative to increase ACT by including an evening treatment using HFCC during hospitalizations for PEx.",

            "text": "Methods: Beginning in November 2008 all patients >6 yrs of age admitted for PEx were offered an evening HFCC treatment utilizing Hill-Rom's Vest Airway Clearance System. The HFCC equipment is managed and cleaned by nurses and the treatment is completed by the patient and caregiver following education and demonstration of proper device use by physical therapists. The nursing staff documents the time of the HFCC treatment. As part of our QI initiative, a nursing staff survey assessed nurses' perceptions of the benefits of the additional HFCC treatment and its effect on nursing workload. A patient/parent satisfaction questionnaire (PPQ) on ACT was also administered during hospitalizations before and after implementation of the evening HFCC program.Results: In the four months prior to the initiation of the evening HFCC treatment, 63 hospitalized patients received an average of 2.3 treatments per day. On 49% of hospitalized days they received 3 or more treatments. Prior to the QI project, 13 patients completed the PPQ and 69% were very or extremely satisfied with the ACT received during their admission. From November 2008-April 2009, 37/46 (80%) eligible patients participated in the evening HFCC program. The average number of treatments each day increased to 3.0, and on 73% of hospitalized days patients received 3 or more treatments. After the initiation of the evening HFCC program, 13 PPQ were completed; 85% were very or extremely satisfied with the ACT received during the admission and 85% felt the evening HFCC treatment was beneficial or very beneficial. Many patients chose to do the evening treatment after 9:30 pm; HFCC treatments allowed patients more flexibility of treatment time. Nursing surveys (n=35) revealed that although 55% felt the evening HFCC treatment put an increased burden on the nursing staff, 60% felt it improved patients' ability to clear secretions, and 70% felt it improved patient/parent satisfaction. The primary expense of this program is the cost of disposable vests, which averaged $2025/month, significantly less than the cost of physical therapists extending their shift through 9:00 pm which would be over $5000/month.Conclusion: This QI initiative was successful in increasing the number of ACT patients with CF hospitalized for PEx received each day and appears to be a cost-effective way to increase daily ACT frequency. Patients, parents, and nursing staff reported high satisfaction with the addition of an evening HFCC treatment.This project was partially funded by a 2009 CFF QI grant. Research has shown that good nutritional status is associated with better lung function and pulmonary outcomes in people with CF [1] . However, many patients do not meet their calorie intake and weight gain goals [2] . We have observed that many patients need additional education Background: Medical professionals caring for patients with chronic illness, such as cystic fibrosis (CF), struggle to maintain appropriate boundaries that allow for a safe relationship with a patient based on the patient's needs. Maintaining professional boundaries is difficult due to the nature of support provided, as the patient requires increasing degrees of care. When a professional violates a boundary the indiscretion may exploit the patient's vulnerable position.",

            "text": "Recently, we observed an increase in boundary violations among licensed professionals and unlicensed employees directly involved with the care of inpatients with CF. Following discussions with nursing leadership, a plan was developed to address professional boundaries and assess the staff's beliefs related to boundaries and the impact of education on these beliefs. We aimed to address the needs identified by hospital staff for setting appropriate professional boundaries with patients by developing and conducting educational sessions with the staff.Methods: Two of the authors (KB, LG) led interactive educational sessions with hospital staff about appropriate professional boundaries. The objectives of the sessions were: defining professional boundaries; differentiating between boundary crossings and boundary violations; and techniques for managing boundary violations. A written clinical boundaries inventory (CBI) was administered to the participants prior to and following the sessions. The CBI is a thirty-question tool ranking the acceptability of behaviors on a 3 point Likert scale: 1) Never ok, 2) Sometimes ok, or 3) Always ok. To assess the professional's level of awareness, 4 clinical scenarios were also verbally processed as acceptable behavior, potential boundary crossing, or boundary violation.Results: To date, 40 staff have participated in the educational sessions. CBI obtained after the intervention showed that 81% of respondents changed one or more answers, and 42% of these participants changed 7 or more of their answers. Of those responses changed, 63% of the answers were to a more appropriate boundary. Situations that were frequently answered inappropriately after the sessions included contacting a patient while not working and offering one's family as a socialization option for a patient/patient's siblings. When verbally processing the professional's level of awareness, participants responded appropriately to the scenarios presented. Three scenarios were routinely assessed as questionable boundary crossings: co-ed professional/patient relationships, relationships with former patients who are no longer in the care of the professional, and agreement to act as an employment reference for a patient/patient's family member.Discussion: We conclude that professional boundaries can be improved following an educational intervention. Future sessions will involve additional healthcare professionals, including physicians. We plan to re-administer the CBI within 6 months of the initial training to assess the long-term effects the training had on the beliefs of the participants. We anticipate that ongoing education may be needed. A potent inhaled agent, Equanox is a 50:50 mix of nitrous oxide and oxygen. It provides analgesia, some sedation and relieves anxiety before and during painful procedures. Prior to this an increasing number of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) were requiring general anaesthetic for insertion of long lines. Some requiring gripper needle insertion were becoming increasingly distressed during the procedure. With the assistance of the Paediatric Pain team, it was established that Equanox therapy could be beneficial to this client group. It was observed that Equanox administration was optimised when used in conjunction with input from the play specialist.",

            "text": "Method: Patient satisfaction data was collected over the year April 2008 to March 2009 by means of a simple tick box questionnaire after each procedure using Equanox. Equanox therapy was used for line and gripper needle insertion in CF children on 22 occasions throughout this period. Eight individuals, six boys and two girls with an age range of 4 to 15 years received Equanox therapy during this period. Patients were asked to rate how satisfied they were with the procedure using 4 categories: Poor, Good, Very Good and Excellent.Results: Results showed that on 50% of the occasions that Equanox was used, patients scored their satisfaction as Excellent. On two occasions, patients scored their satisfaction as Very Good, while on 5 occasions scored Good. This means that for over 80% of the occasions on which Equanox was used, children felt it was a positive outcome. No-one scored the procedure as Poor but on two occasions, two individuals became very distressed and could not co-operate with the procedure. One patient felt happy to have his line inserted without the use of Equanox as he felt he no longer required it.Conclusion: Nurse-led Equanox therapy negates the need for some children to be admitted to day case units for line insertion under general anaesthetic. Many studies show it to be a safe and effective analgesic when used for procedure related pain. Its success rate within the CF population at RHSC, although small has encouraged the team to use it more often and undertake training to allow members of the CF team to administer this therapy. Infection control measures currently utilized in the clinic include: hand hygiene prior to and after any interaction with the patient; all staff don gown and gloves prior to entering exam room; the waiting room is arranged so that families may distance themselves minimally three feet from other families; no shared toys or magazines in waiting room; clinic appointment times are arranged to minimize wait time in the waiting room.",

            "text": "Parents of children with CF were asked to complete a seven question survey during their child's clinic visit. Forty-eight parents completed the survey. The surveys were collected ensuring anonymity.Three questions focused on parent knowledge of infection: 1) preventing infection as an important part of their child's care 2) signs of lung infection; and 3) their knowledge that lung infections can cause lung damage.Three questions addressed parent perception of infection control measures utilized in the clinic: 1) are all staff entering the patient exam room garbed in a gown and gloves; 2) utilization of gown and gloves by all staff decreases the risk of infection exposure to their child; and 3) the size of the waiting room allows families the ability to avoid close contact with other CF patients.One question inquired whether parents found the information mailed after clinic visit, discussing infection and the spread of germs, as helpful.The survey revealed that 98% of parents strongly agree or agree that preventing infections is an important part of their child's care. Most (96%) of parents identified change in cough, change in mucous coughed up, fever, and change in appetite as signs of possible lung infection. All (100%) parents indicated that lung infections can cause lung damage.Regarding infection control measures in the clinic, 96% of parents surveyed indicated that staff don gown and gloves prior to coming into the exam room. Eighty-one percent of parents indicated that their child was at decreased risk of germ exposure because staff donned gown and gloves prior to entering the exam room. Seventy-three percent of parents surveyed indicated that they felt the waiting room was large enough to decrease exposure to germs while waiting for their appointment.Ninety-eight percent of parents surveyed indicated that the information sent after their child's appointment about infection and spread of germs is helpful.",

Respiratory Medicine and Allergology, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden Background: At the combined adult and paediatric West Swedish Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Centre patients are seen every 4-6 weeks. Treatment with IV antibiotics for ten days is started early if there is a clinical suspicion of pulmonary exacerbation and most patients administer the therapy at home without support from homecare teams but can contact the centre when needed. Few patients are treated continuously with inhaled antibiotics.Aim:To investigate to what degree the Fuchs criteria of infectious exacerbation were fulfilled at start of intravenous antibiotic therapy and impact on work and school attendance.Methods: All patients who started IV antibiotics during Sept 1-Dec 31, 2008 were included. Symptoms and signs of exacerbation were recorded. The number of peripheral venous catheters (pvc) needed, number of days on IV, days in hospital and days on sick leave from school/work were noted.Results: Forty patients (20 females) with a median age of 23 years (range 6-66) started a total of 47 IV treatments. Seven patients started 2 treatments. FEV1 at start was 64\u00b120% and 25 (62%) were chronically infected with P. aeruginosa. Twenty patients (50%) had a totally implantable venous access system while 20 patients (50%) used pvc. At discontinuation patients were seen in clinic (36 patients) or had a telephone consultation with the nurse (11 patients).The treatment was extended up to 15 days (range 11-15) in seven patients. Two patients were treated in hospital for 9 and 4 days respectively, both for eradication therapy due to first isolation of P. aeruginosa. At IV start 10/47 (21%) fulfilled Fuchs criteria. Five of 15 children (33%) were absent from school/day-care for median 9 (range 2-10) days. Of 31 treatments in adults, absence from work/studies was recorded for 16 (52%) for a median of 9 (range 3-10) days. The median number of pvc used was 2/patient (range 1-6). At follow-up FEV1 improved with 5.7\u00b16.4% (p<0.001), while the weight was unchanged (36 treatments).Conclusion: Less than 25% fulfilled the Fuchs criteria for pulmonary exacerbation at start of intravenous antibiotic therapy. Hospitalization was seldom necessary and the majority of the patients continued their work or studies as usual.",

Pediatrics III, University Heidelberg, Pediatric Pulmonology, Cystic Fibrosis Centre & Infectious Diseases, Heidelberg, Germany Objective: Teenagers with cystic fibrosis (CF) are now in a much better health condition compared to 20 years ago, and therefore they stay less frequently in the hospital. As a consequence, there is less time to provide the teenagers comprehensive information about the disease and treatment opportunities. Teaching in small groups, such as for asthma and atopic dermatitis patients, are of limited use for teenagers with CF, as many of them are already colonized with resistant pathogens and can therefore not attend. Teenagers like to obtain information from the internet and to visit chat rooms. Therefore, in addition to the information provided by the CF team in the outpatient department and during hospital admissions, we developed a CD and internet forum \"mukoteens\" especially designed for teenagers: 1) more information about the disease and treatment opportunities, where the teenagers can decide when to obtain the information and how specific; 2) for a better therapy adherence and compliance in this particular age group for a better quality of life and life expectancy; and 3) for improved communication about the disease between patients of the same age group.Methods: Adolescent CF patients of the cystic fibrosis center Heidelberg were asked, what topics are of interest for a better knowledge about the disease and treatment strategies. The cystic fibrosis team of the centre and in particular the MDs, a psychiatrist, a gynecologist, a physical therapist, a social worker and a dietician did further contribute. Topics of relevance were selected by the team, questions were collected and cartoons, animations, and videos were generated together with a female and male teenager patient from the center in cooperation with a professional media designer.Results: A CD and a corresponding internet platform \"mukoteens\" were developed for the following topics: respiration, alimentation, development, pharmacology of drugs, physiotherapy exercises as well as for partnership, sexuality, and desire to have children. The two teenagers generated a diary of their patient history from diagnosis of the disease to their problems to find a apprenticeship position for them. So far, between 4000 and 7000 visits of the mukoteens internet forum were recorded per month.Conclusions: In addition to the information provided by the CF team to teenage patients in the outpatient department and in the hospital about the disease and the treatment opportunities, a CD and internet forum can provide self-regulated information, and can improve the communication between the patients for a better compliance and quality of life.Supported by an unrestricted research grant by Asche Chiesi GmbH, Hamburg, Germany. Background: Our cystic fibrosis (CF) Program is provided through a small multi-disciplinary clinic for both pediatric and adult care. Transfer to adult clinic usually occurs at age 18. With the exception of the physician, members of the CF team provide care throughout the lifespan, following patients at both pediatric and adult clinics which are held at the same setting.",

            "text": "Objective: Our objective was to implement an effective education/transition program to meet the needs of our combined pediatric/adult CF program.Methods: A literature review was conducted to explore strategies used for the successful transition of persons from pediatric to adult care in CF clinics, and the meaning of \"transition\". Data were collected and reviewed regarding established programs from the literature, NACFC conferences and the Canadian CF Nurses Interest Group, as well as chronic illness models, developmental/theoretical principles, health promotion framework, education techniques for lifelong learning, Standards of Care and Clinical Practice Guidelines for CF. Our CF team held meetings since Dec 2007 to develop an education/transition program to meet the needs of our clinic, using our clinic population statistics to guide priority planning.Results: The literature review revealed little practical advice relevant to our setting. Definitions of \"transition\" varied. The few formal transition programs in Canada or published internationally did not fully meet the needs of our clinic population. Most programs focused on the processes involved with transfer to a separate adult care facility, and did not describe a formal education program for combined CF pediatric/adult settings. Given these findings, our team decided it would be necessary to develop a unique program for our setting. We developed a definition of \"transition\" and created a lifespan CF Education/Transition Program Framework. This framework addresses patients' education needs from the time of diagnosis to end of life care, and incorporates an adolescent care pathway to facilitate transition to adult care. It includes learning needs assessments, evidence-based multi-disciplinary clinical documentation tools, and patient/family educational resources. Since 53% of clinic patients were adolescents and/or young adults, this group was targeted as a priority for program development. A CF team documentation tool was drafted for use with the \"Adolescent Care Pathway\" and early adult care, as well as a \"CF Readiness to Transfer to Adult CF Clinic Questionnaire,\" Adolescent Transition pamphlets, and other resources.Conclusions: Models of transition are still evolving and there are few data on program efficacy. The development of our CF clinic's formal lifespan Education/Transition Program will be the first of its kind in Canada, and was developed to meet the specific patient program needs at our clinical setting. We aim to pilot the adolescent and early adult pathways of our program and incorporate an ongoing evaluation process. Methods: A 60-item questionnaire assessing CF knowledge in five areas (general complications, lung topics, gastrointestinal topics, reproduction, and genetics) was developed and validated. One hundred CF patients (median age: 26.0 years, range 17-49 years; median FEV1: 57.0% predicted, range 20-127% predicted) completed the questionnaire. Level of CF knowledge was correlated with clinical and sociodemographic characteristics.",

Female gender and receiving post-secondary (post-high school) education were significantly correlated with higher CF knowledge scores in all domains (p < 0.05). There was no correlation between CF knowledge scores and lung function, nutritional status, or socioeconomic status.Conclusions: This study validated a questionnaire that can be utilized to assess CF knowledge in adult patients. Our results indicate that CF patients have a good understanding of most aspects of their disease, although clear deficiencies, particularly regarding reproduction and genetics as they relate to CF, are common. These deficiencies should be considered when developing a transition or adult CF education program.",

Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA; 3. Medicine, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston, MA, USA Introduction: Many patients with advanced CF lung disease receive intensive treatments such as non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation which are intended to sustain life. There are no standards for the timing or content of patient-physician discussions about preferences for the use of these treatments. We aimed to describe physician practices for discussing preferences for the use of intensive treatments with patients with advanced CF lung disease, including timing and content as well as barriers and facilitators to discussions.Methods: Physicians at 2 large CF care centers completed an internetbased survey about their current practice for discussing intensive treatment preferences with CF patients. Summary statistics were used to analyze responses. Physicians were also interviewed about their recommendations for improving treatment preference discussions, and recurrent themes were identified using qualitative content analysis.Results: Surveys have been completed by 23 of 35 (66%) eligible physicians in this ongoing study, and interviews by 17 (49%). Physicians report a mean of 16 years experience in CF care, with half of physicians providing primary CF care to 20 or more patients. Most (96%) felt the primary CF physician should initiate these discussions with their patients. Opinions were divided on whether first discussions should take at a time of medical stability (48%) versus during acute illness or a major decline in health (52%). Wide variation in the content of discussions was reported, with only 3 issues always being included: potential risks and benefits of intensive treatments, lung transplant preference, and disease prognosis. Major barriers to discussions identified were overly optimistic expectations about prognosis and about effectiveness of intensive treatments on the part of patients/families, concern for taking away hope, prognostic uncertainty, and competing demands for physicians' time. Major facilitators of discussions included lung disease severity, transplant status, and patient/family inquiry about intensive treatments. Themes emerging from interviews included lack of training in discussing treatment preferences and difficulty identifying the appropriate time to initiate discussions due to variations in disease trajectory and in patient/family readiness. All physicians endorsed initiating discussions when patients are stable enough to participate and felt that educational tools for patients would facilitate discussions and informed decision making about the use of intensive treatments.Conclusions: CF physicians feel responsible for initiating discussions about intensive treatment preferences with their patients, but identify lack of formal training, difficulty determining the appropriate time to initiate discussions, and other patient and physician factors which are barriers to these discussions. Consensus about timing and content of discussions and also development and use of educational tools may facilitate discussions and decision making about intensive treatments.Supported by the National Palliative Care Research Center.",
