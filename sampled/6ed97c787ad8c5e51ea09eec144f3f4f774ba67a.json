Lung hyperinflation associated with mechanical ventilation has traditionally been inferred from functional parameters such as dead space or compliance, but it may also be assessed by quantitative computed tomography (CT) . Because information about the relationship of these surrogates of lung hyperinflation is scanty, we analyzed these parameters simultaneously in an animal model.

Airway pressure, flow, and expiratory CO 2 were recorded continuously in 10 anesthetized, paralyzed and mechanically ventilated sheep with normal lungs.

The first CT (CT-1) was acquired at positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH 2 O. After performing a recruitment maneuver (PCV with PEEP 40 and driving pressure of 20 cmH 2 O for 2 min), a second CT (CT-2) was acquired at 20 cmH 2 O PEEP. For each condition, the hyperinflated lung volume was quantified from the segmented CT images of the entire lung as the volume of regions with CT numbers \\ -900 HU, and the nonaerated volume was calculated as the volume of regions with CT numbers between -100 and 100 HU.

Hemodynamic instability during haemodialysis (HD) is related to decrease in blood volume and cardiac output which result from the imbalance between ultrafiltration rate (UFR) and the plasma refilling rate. Compensatory mechanisms for hemodynamic stabilisation involve increase in heart rate, cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance. Increased oxygen extraction in peripheral tissue (i.e. arterio-venous oxygen difference) is an additional compensatory mechanism. In patient at rest, mixed venous oxygen saturation (ScvO 2 ) reflects cardiac output and oxygen extraction (ERO 2 ; with ScvO 2 = 1 -ERO 2 ). The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of UF volume on global tissue oxygen, as reflected by ScvO 2 , compared to clinical and biological parameters PATIENTS AND METHOD. After local ethical committee approval, 12 patients with central venous catheter and/or double lumen catheter HD in 34 consecutive sessions were studied. The amount of UF was prescribed at the discretion of the same physician, who determined the amount of fluid to be removed based on individual clinical parameters including fluid balance, previous haemodialysis sessions, estimated dry weight and chest Xray. Non invasive cardiac index (CI) was evaluated via transthoracic bioelectrical impedance (Physioflow \u00d2 ). Central venous blood sample for ScvO 2 was drawn hourly. Pulse oxymetric oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ), heart rate, non invasive blood pressure and UF volume were recorded each hour. Arterial blood gas, haemoglobin (Hb) and Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) were determined performed before (H0) and 15 min after completion the haemodialysis session (H4).

As a direct indicator of the global cardiac pumping efficiency, the cardiac stroke volume (SV) has major diagnostic value in numerous conditions, including cardiovascular diseases or congestive heart failure.

One for an open lung (no decrease in PaO 2 ), one after detection of derecruitment. Reference cardiac output was measured by thermodilution and divided by the heart rate (HR) to obtain reference SV.

INTRODUCTION. Data collection is time consuming and expensive. In a prospective observational study, we compared the on-line electronically collected cardiac output values against data registered in the CRF during patient visits. We used continuous cardiac output by FloTrac-Vigileo system (FCO) and continuous cardiac output with pulmonary artery catheter (CCO). For Electronic Data Capture (EDC) we used a multi data logger (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA). Simultaneously registered cardiac output data on CRF forms, marked as ''CRF''. Aim of this abstract is to compare quality of the data acquisition and costs. METHODS. Data collected during standard post-operative care in 28 cardiac surgery patients. The Cardiac output data was collected at 1 h (T0), 2 h (T1), 4 h (T2), 8 h (T3), 12 h (T4), 24 h (T5), 36 h (T6), and 48 h (T7) after ICU admission. For data labeled ''EDC'', the values were taken as an average of 5 min at the time points described above (2.5 min before the time point and 2.5 min after the time point). 179 paired data points could be evaluated. EDC and CRF data was evaluated using a modified Bland-Altman technique (a random effects model to compute within subject variance [1] ). RESULTS. Measured with ICO mean cardiac output was 5.1 (0.98) [range 2.9-8.2] l/min. Bias and precision between EDC data and CRF data for CCO was 0.15 (0.32) l/min, coefficient of variation 0.06, for FCO -0.05 (0.32) l/min, coefficient of variation 0.06, (Figs. 1, 2) . During a half hour visit the study nurse can examine the used equipment and register CRF data; cost were calculated as 179 9 15 Euro = 2,685 Euro.

Obtaining accurate blood glucose levels at the bedside is mandatory to titrate intravenous insulin infusions in ICU patients. Glucose monitoring in this setting appears more complicated than in ambulatory monitoring in diabetic patients [1] . The use of glucose meters included in blood gas analyzers has been advocated [2] . We evaluated comparatively the performance of two new point-of-care devices and a blood gas analyzer. METHODS. Simultaneously, arterial blood glucose was measured with a blood gas analyzer RapidLab 1265 (Siemens), the Accu-Chek Performa strip on the Accu-Chek Inform II (Roche), the Nova StatStrip (NovaBiomedical) and in the central laboratory using the hexokinase method. All the measures were duplicated and the average value of each method was computed. Bland-Altman, Passing-Bablok, Kanji and modified Kanji approaches were used. RESULTS. A total 432 matched analysis were randomly performed in 343 adult patients. The mean SOFA score was 5.0 (minimum 0 and maximum 23). The range of reference method glucose was 20-585 mg/dL. No patient had paracetamol overdose. Biases are defined as point-of care minus reference glucose values. These biases were -0.5 mg/dL for the Accu-Chek Performa strip with the Accu-Chek Inform II, -1.0 mg/dL for the Nova StatStrip and -4.9 mg/dL for the RapidLab1265. The Passing-Bablok regression show that the confidence interval (CI) of the slope contains the 1.000 for the handheld glucose meters but not for the blood gas analyzer. Rates of discrepancies for the different levels (10, 15 and 20%) were not significantly different between the methods. See Table 1 . July 1, 2007 and February 28, 2009 were included. An active computerized decision support system in the first phase (date from January till August 2008) providing patient non-specific advice and in the second phase (date from September 2008 till February 2009.) providing patient-specific advice was developed, implemented and evaluated. Effectiveness/efficiency-related indicators (mean blood glucose levels (BGL), BGL within pre-defined targets and time to capture target), safety-related indicators (hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia events, and hyperglycemia index), and protocol-related indicators (BGL sampling interval) were measured. To visualize and make inferences on the longitudinal development of outcome measures we resort to the powerful instrument of control charts from the field of statistical process control (SPC). We advocate the use of SPC for monitoring the quality of glucose regulation through the two phases as it provides insight of outcome change over time.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 468, "end": 471, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 551, "end": 554, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1859, "end": 1875, "text": "July 1, 2007 and", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1876, "end": 1893, "text": "February 28, 2009", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1849, "end": 1856, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "COMPARATIVE EVALUATION OF ACCURACY OF THREE POINT-OF-CARE GLUCOMETERS IN AN ADULT ICU"}, {"text": "RESULTS.

Myocardial dysfunction, impaired microcirculation and increased vascular permeability accompanying severe sepsis contribute to lung edema, particularly in acute lung injury (ALI) and septic shock (SS). Therefore, these patients require thorough monitoring of gas exchange and pulmonary hemodynamics.

METHODS. 99 previously healthy immunocompetent patients with severe multiple trauma admitted to the E.R in less than 8 h from trauma were included during a period of 22 months. 64 healthy individuals served as controls. We determined a wide spectrum of pro-and antiinflammatory cytokines simultaneously (TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-10, sTNFR type-I and-II, IL-1ra and TGF-b) on admission, 12 h, and 24 h after trauma. All patients were followed up for sepsis, MOF and death until discharge from hospital. The variables were compared between groups with and without complications and death. RESULTS. The age of patients (88 men and 11 women) was 41.98 \u00b1 17.81 years, the ISS 23.21 \u00b1 11.47 and the rate of mortality, MOF, ARDS and sepsis 20.20, 32.32, 10.10 and 41.41% respectively. On admission trauma patients had significantly higher levels of IL-6, IL-10, sTNFRII, IL-1ra and TGF-b than did controls. IL-6 (adm, 12 h, 24 h), IL-1ra (12 h, 24 h) and IL-10 (24 h) were more closely related to the severity of trauma as measured by the ISS score (p \\ 0.001). Elevated IL-6 (12 h), TGF-b (adm) and IL-6:IL-10 ratio were detected in patients who died, whereas sTNFR I (adm, 12 h) as well as IL-1b, IL-6, IL-10, IL-1ra, sTNFR I, sTNFRII levels (24 h) were significantly higher in patients who developed sepsis. Serum levels of TGF-1b and IL-1ra (adm) as well as IL-6, IL-1ra, sTNFR I, sTNFRII (12 h) and IL-1b, IL-6, sTNFR I, sTNFRII, IL-1ra levels (24 h) were significantly higher in patients who developed MOF. A significant decline in serum IL-10 and IL-1ra levels was observed in survivors, non-septic and without MOF patients (12 and 24 h). Results of the multivariate analysis by logistic regression are shown in Tables 1, 2, 3 ROC curve for the model AUC (95% CI) 0.879 (0.809-0.953) CONCLUSIONS. Serum levels of TGF-b1, IL-6 and IL-1ra as well as the sustained overproduction of IL-10 and IL-1ra may predict death and late complications as sepsis and MOF as soon as into the first 24 h after severe trauma.

Among the factors that were associated with the disparity between the two scales, only the diagnosis of delirium by CAM-ICU was associated with worse scores on Glasgow Coma Scale (p = 0002) and worse score on the SOFA scale(p = 0016), while none of the factors studied were associated with the diagnosis only by ICDSC.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "METHODS."}, {"text": "CONCLUSIONS.

The critically ill patients on numerous occasions need to be transported from one section of the hospital to the other for diagnostic, therapeutic or operative procedures. During the intrahospital transport, a number of critical events have been reported with incidence ranging form 21 to 84%. These critical events mainly include variation in blood pressure, airway obstruction, hypoxaemia, cardiac dysrrhythmias and even frank cardiac or respiratory arrest. In addition, lack of appropriate monitors and advanced supportive care and absence of trained nurse(s) to transport a patient safely to areas within the hospital, add to the adverse untoward events during Intrahospital transport.

Less than 25% of alarms trigger a staff response (adjustment of sensor position, aspiration, treatment change\u2026) and medical opinion is required in only 5.9% of cases [1] .

Consistency between alarms settings by nurses and physician was recorded, as well as occurrences, type and reasons for modifications of alarms settings during the monitoring period. We also recorded demographic data, motif of ICU admission, ICU length of stay, type and duration of organ support, and SOFA scores.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PATIENTS AND METHODS."}, {"text": "RESULTS. 144 pts monitored for a total 484 monitoring days have been enrolled in the study. Nurses and MDs disagree on alarms settings in 26% of cases, and we identified major discrepancies in patterns of alarm setting irrespective of patients' condition. Nurses initiated 76% of modifications of alarms settings. They modified 3 \u00b1 2.2 settings at start of day shift in 60% of cases whereas settings were altered in only 28% of cases (4 \u00b1 1.8 changes) at start of night shift. 82% of alarms changes occurred outside of starting shifts. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the reasons and the main changes in alarms settings. The noise peaks derived from the alarm systems often exceed 80 dB and are comparable to noise levels next to busy streets, thereby providing potential health hazards to patients and staff. Furthermore, low specificity of the alarms may lead to reduced alertness of staff which can result in missing responses to relevant alarms, eventually leading to a reduction of the clinical sensitivity of the alarm system. Previously, we established an experimental setting for generating a database of physiological data and clinical alarm annotations, and we here report the analysis of the completed database as well as possible solutions for a reduction of alarms. METHODS. The study was performed as a prospective observational clinical study in a medical ICU of a university hospital. Physiologic data, monitor alarms and monitor settings from the cardiovascular surveillance network were recorded at one-second intervals. Bedside video recordings were performed with a day and night camera and clinically annotated offline with respect to alarm relevance and technical validity. RESULTS. 5934 alarms were annotated during 982 h of observation, corresponding to 6 alarms per hour. About 40% of all alarms did not correctly describe the patient condition and were classified as technically false, 68% of those were caused by manipulation. Only 885 (15%) of all alarms were considered clinically relevant. Most of the generated alarms were related to arterial blood pressure (44%), followed by oxygen saturation (26%) and heart rate alarms (13%).

There was no statistical difference in the total number of interventions between very high risk patients (EuroSCORE [ 40), the mortality group and the rest.

However the very high risk and mortality groups did have increased input from non-core MDT groups (mean of 9.7 vs. 8.8).

INTRODUCTION. The leading causes of brain death are traumatic brain injury (TBI), (aneurysm) subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) and intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), which compromise approximately 80-90% of the cases [1] [2] [3] . There is a steady decline in the actual number of brain death patients over the past decades as a result of progress in prevention and treatment of these conditions. There is no uniform definition of a potential organ donor that can be used to determine the potential of heart-beating organ donors. Therefore we defined a potential brain death organ donor as a patient with documented severe brain damage of a known origin, a GCS-score of 3 and more than 2 absent brain stem reflexes which includes: pupil, cornea, oculovestibular, oculocephalic and the cough reflex.

For more than 15 years, our unit has developed an expertise on organ donation. With the evolving modifications in end of life considerations in ICU's, the implantation of a NHBD program appears to be a continuation of the local procurement coordination work. During the same period, the team took care of 322 potentials donors, and more specifically of 15 NHBD. This program was implanted progressively in the unit after consultation of the medical and nursing teams and of course the accordance of the Ethic Committee. A specific psychological support was not included in the program. However, upon request of the staff, psychologist was available. This program represents a hard work for the nursing team and was only possible with the presence of a local coordination (nurse) already in place in our institution since 1994. This point is probably the most important one in the successful introduction of such a program. It is important to point out that contacts with families were especially peaceful. For some patients, the potential of organ donation was indeed suggested by the close relationship when they had to face a hopeless prognosis. Moreover, the local coordinator remains in relationship with the family in the weeks following donation CONCLUSIONS. NHBD program can be implanted successfully in a non transplant center, but the presence of local procurement coordination is probably mandatory. This program allowed an important increase of organ referred for transplantation. However, the burden of work and the psychological impact for the ICU team need to be carefully supported. In our experience, most of the time, the procedure was particularly well accepted by the donor's family and seems to bring some kind of moral support in the mourning process. Importantly, ethical as well as legal reflections are mandatory to explore the future of the NHBD. Indeed, juridical litigation and public disinformation could create a counter-productive opinion on organ donation in general. The specific role of the intensivist should also be carefully asses especially for the procedure surrounding withdrawal from mechanical ventilation. INTRODUCTION. Surgery offers cure for many patients suffering from cardiac diseases, such as vessel diseases or valve dysfunctions. The success of intensive care management has improved and more complex diseases can be adequately treated. Co-morbidity and age of patients undergoing cardiac surgery have increased during the last years, often leading to a prolonged stay at the intensive care unit (ICU). Usually, the outcome following surgery is assessed with mortality or morbidity rates. Nevertheless, quality of life plays an important role in recovery after cardiac surgery.

Acquired coagulation disorders in which autoantibodies against factor VIII are produced are termed acquired hemophilia A. The incidence rate of acquired hemophilia A in the UK is 1.48/million/year. Only 7% of these cases occur in the postpartum period. Acquired hemophilia is associated with significant morbidity and potential death. Cases may be associated with underlying immune or malignant disease, but at least 50% are idiopathic. In young women, the most common association is with the puerperium. There is variation in the natural history of factor VIII inhibitors in pregnancy with respect to onset, site, severity of hemorrhage and inhibitor titre. factor VIII inhibitors are most commonly found in primigravid patients. Acquired hemophilia is typically diagnosed in the postpartum period, but, rarely, it can be detected antenatally or during delivery. The median time to inhibitor onset is 2 months, but onset can occur from as soon as the antepartum period to 12 months after delivery. BACKGROUND AND GOAL OF THE STUDY.

According to the arterial vasodilation hypothesis, in cirrhotic patients, splanchnic vasodilation and a reduction in ''effective'' blood volume cause a counter-regulatory increase in endogenous vasopressors leading to renal vasoconstriction, refractory ascites and functional renal failure.

TIPS placement resulted in an increase of central blood volume and CI. Whereas in our series of patients the latter effect seems to be predominantly due to a raised HR, there was also a trend towards an increase in SVI, suggesting improved cardiac filling conditions. Increasing cardiac power index upon increased preload suggests that cirrhotic cardiomyopathy was not an important factor in this series of patients. The associated decrease of RI, although partly explained by the increase in HR, indicates improved renal perfusion. Amiodarone is the antiarrhythmic agent of choice in treatment of haemodynamically unstable patients suffering from acute tachyarrhythmias due to impaired cardiac function. The intravenous form of amiodarone-hydrochloride (IvAm) has an interindividually different antiarrhythmic and rate controlling efficacy, and the dosage of amiodarone is empirical. Main adverse effects are severe bradyacardia, asystole, hypotension, low cardiac output, acute heart failure, bronchosapsm and impaired liver function.

INTRODUCTION. Volemia is one of the independent variables determining cardiac output. Its evaluation is therefore fundamental in critically ill patients. Beyond clinical examination, many techniques have been proposed for its assessment, but none of them has received wide consensus. Normally, variations of volemia are associated to total body sodium (Na) stores, which are finely regulated by the kidney. If an extra-amount of Na is added to plasma, arriving to the kidney, and the kidney is conditioned by hypovolemia, the extra-Na will be entirely reabsorbed, therefore not reaching the urine. In contrast, in normo-/hypervolemia, Na will be almost completely excreted. The extra-amount of urinary Na will increase the urinary strong ion difference (SID U ), thereby causing a consensual elevation in urinary pH (pH U ).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONCLUSIONS."}, {"text": "OBJECTIVES.

The current guidelines of the American Heart Association (AHA) prescribe immediate defibrillation after onset of VF or VT. The whole purpose of using a defibrillator is to eliminate the chaotic electrical activity of the heart during VF or the too-rapid ventricular activity in VT which precludes a circulation.

Analysis of critical incidents in our hospital suggested that the adverse events related to intra-hospital transfers may be both numerically and proportionately larger. The commonest reason that led to critical incidents related to intra-hospital transfer was that the escorting staff lacked the necessary knowledge and skill to match the complexity of the level of transfer. A critical care outreach team (CCOT) and the Early Warning Score-EWS [2] is well established in our hospital. The trigger score is 4 or more and this demands an immediate referral to the CCOT.

These are two different regions, with different administration, management and the finance. Traditionally the public health services in Moscow area have the worst financing and are worse quality, than in the city of Moscow. On the other hand, traffic accidents victims in Moscow area have more serious traumatic injuries due to higher speeds on country roads and smaller availability of the qualified medical aid.Children are evacuated from traffic accident places to local municipal hospitals by emergency medical service. Since 2004 patients with severe trauma are transported by a pediatric intensive care team of Centre for Disaster Medicine on the ambulance or the medical helicopter to the children's hospital of Moscow (it is approximately equal to level 1 pediatric trauma center).Pediatric intensive care team can consult now with senior pediatric surgeons or emergency physician (intensivists) in children's hospital of the Moscow directly from local hospital or accident place.

Labad 1 1 Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge, Servei de Medicina Intensiva, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, SpainBACKGROUND. Acute renal failure (ARF) in septic shock (SS) is common and worsens prognosis. ARF can be classified in different stages with RIFLE score. Early stages of SS and ARF share pathophysiology pathways with citokines causing endothelial damage. Continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) could play an important role as convective techniques could eliminate citokines and achieve imunomodulation.OBJECTIVE. Analyse clinical parameters in patients with SS and ARF that need CRRT. Analyse survival based on ARF stage and type of CRRT. 55 days. CRRT applied: 57% HVHF, 32% CVVH, and 11% CVVHDF. 28 day mortality 47% (36% HVHF, 50% CVVH, 100% CVVHDF). Group II: depuration days 6.4 \u00b1 9, days from admission ICU to CRRT 5.2 \u00b1 11, ICU length of stay 24 \u00b1 21 days. CRRT applied: 34% HVHF, 29% CVVH, 37% CVVHDF. 28 day mortality 65% (71% HVHF, 70% CVVH, 56% CVVHDF). No global statistical survival differences were found neither between the three different CRRT nor between the RIFLE initial score. We found statistically significant survival differences between different CRRT in each RIFLE score group. Group I: HVHF better survival than CVVH and CVVHDF. Group II: CVVHDF better survival than HVHF and CVVH.CONCLUSIONS.Patients with SS and ARF who need CRRT present high mortality. Early start of CRRT (low RIFLE score) seems to improve survival. CRRT with HVHF seems the best technique in early stages (Risk-Injury). CRRT with CVVHDF seems the best technique in late stages (Failure).EFFECTS OF INTRAVENOUS IGM-ENRICHED IMMUNOGLOBULINS ONMUSCLE TISSUE MICROCIRCULATION IN SEPTIC SHOCK: A PRELIMINARY REPORT I.

In sepsis, multiple organ dysfunction is a consequence of cellular dysoxia caused mainly by microcirculation impairment. Intravenous polyclonal IgM-enriched immunoglobulins (IgGAM) have been recently re-evaluated as a valid therapeutic option in septic patients. The exact mechanism of action of IgGAM is still unclear, but the antitoxin and anti-inflammatory properties may influence the microcirculatory disturbances observed in sepsis. The aim of this study was to evaluate in patients with septic shock the effect of an early therapy with IgGAM on muscle tissue microcirculation by means of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF33": {"text": "VERY HIGH VOLUME HEMOFILTRATION IMPROVES HEMODYNAMICS AND RESPIRATORY VARIABLES AND PROBABLY INCREASE SURVIVING IN CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS WITH SEPTIC SHOCK C.

The fat embolism syndrome (FES) is a rare clinical condition in which circulating fat emboli or fat macroglobules lead to multisystem dysfunction. Patients with long-bone fractures have a 1-20% chance of acquiring the syndrome. However, the true incidence of FES is rather unknown because mild cases may be unnoticed. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial; it is mainly based on clinical criteria and may be masked by associated lesions especially in the multitrauma victim.OBJECTIVE. The aim of this study is to describe the epidemiological, clinical and evolutionary findings in patients with post-traumatic FES.MATERIALS AND METHODS. 23 patients had sustained trauma related FES and admitted in our unit between January 2006 and December 2008. They were reviewed retrospectively.RESULTS. The median age of the patients was 34 years (range 17-59 years). All affected patients were exclusively male. 43.5% of our patients had an age B30ans. The average annual recruitment was 7.6 cases/year. FES was associated with long-bone isolated fracture in 52.1% (7 femur and 5 tibia fractures). 77% of patients presented closed fractures. All patients reached the hospital within 3 h from the injury. The clinical manifestations occurred a few hours to 5 days after the initial insult (the free interval's duration) with an average of 41 h 30 min. The clinical form was complete (presence of the classical triad consisting of respiratory distress, neurological abnormalities and a petechial rash) in 70% of cases, incomplete in 30%. Anemia and thrombocytopenia were found, respectively in 65.2%, 43.5% of cases. A decrease in hematocrit (\\30%) was seen in 60%. No dyslipidemia was found. In most patients, chest radiographic findings were reported normal. Retinal changes at fundoscopy were revealed in two patients. Supportive pulmonary care with mechanical ventilation was indicated in 48% of cases, and 7 patients have required perioperative transfusions. Only 30.5% of cases benefited from early fixation of long bone fractures. The average time of osteosynthesis was 38.7 h (after trauma). Most patients responded well to supportive care, but serious infectious complications occurred and were dominated by nosocomial pneumonia in 30.5% of cases and catheter-related infections in 17.4% of cases. The mortality rate was 17.4% caused by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. The average durations of stay in intensive care unit and hospital stay were 7.7 and 12.7 days respectively.CONCLUSION. FES is one of the few pathologic entities that are diagnosed based on readily available clinical criteria. In our routine, careful clinical examination remains the ''gold standard'' for early diagnosing FES. The prevention, the improvement of trauma care process (with rapid and safe transfer system) and the correct management of bone trauma may decrease its occurrence of this life-threading disorder and the hospital stay of trauma patients.ADMISSIONS TOA SCOTTISH ICU SECONDARY TO ASSAULTS WITH SHARP WEAPONS B.

Death or dependency occurs in up to 70% of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and is often due to clinical vasospasm (CV) causing delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND) in approximately one third of patients. Our objective was to systematically review randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining magnesium (Mg) therapy for preventing CV/DIND in patients with aSAH.METHODS.In duplicate, we searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials from database inception to April 2009 using all terms for SAH (SAH or aneurysm or vasospasm) and magnesium. We included RCTs of Mg compared to any control group without Mg to prevent CV/DIND in adults after aSAH. Outcomes included CV/DIND (primary) and incidence of good neurological outcome, cerebral infarction evidenced by neuroimaging, rebleeding, hypotension, adverse events, and mortality, all at the latest time measured. We excluded RCTs of Mg to treat (vs. prevent) CV/DIND. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using random effects models (RevMan 5). We used the Q test and I 2 to assess statistical heterogeneity. RESULTS. Of 451 citations, 6 RCTs (N = 558) met inclusion criteria. All studies initiated Mg sulfate (MgSO4) intravenously on admission, with a bolus dose in 5/6 RCTs, and titrated with a continuous maintenance infusion to a prespecified level (double the normal serum Mg value in 4/6 RCTs). Interventions common to Mg and control groups included nimodipine (1 RCT), nimodipine/antiepileptic (3 RCTs), and nimodipine/phenytoin/prophylactic triple-H therapy (1 RCT). One additional RCT compared Mg to nimodipine directly. Meta-analyses showed that Mg reduced the incidence of CV/DIND; p = 0.01; 6 RCTs) with a trend to increased incidence of good neurological outcome; p = 0.14; 6 RCTs). There was no effect on cerebral infarction (0.93 [0.73-1.17] p = 0.52; 3 RCTs). There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity in any pooled analysis. Unfortunately, data on adverse events and mortality were too infrequently reported for meta-analysis.Incidence of CV/DINDCONCLUSION. The available evidence suggests that Mg therapy reduces the incidence of CV/DIND and possibly improves neurological outcome when administered prophylactically to patients with aSAH. Forthcoming results from the MASH (N = 1,100) and IMASH (N = 800) trials may contribute to more definitive results.THE PROGNOSTIC RELEVANCE OF ACUTE PHASE REACTION IN PATIENTS WITH INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE I.

More and more elderly patients are proposed for neurosurgery. Only few data on elderly patients are available for long-term functional prognosis after intra cranial surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Inclusion: all patients [70 years old hospitalised for intra cranial surgery. Exclusion: chronic subdural haematoma. Health status was evaluated using 2 scales: Karnosky (KPS) and ADL scales (dependence if KPS B 40% or ADL B 3). Data were expressed as median [Q1-Q3]. Continuous data were compared using Wilcoxon tests, discrete data using Fisher exact test. Primary endpoint: the probability of having an ADL C 4 at 1 year assessed using maximum likelihood logistic regression. p \\ 0.05 for significance.CONCLUSION. Intra cranial surgery in elderly patients is associated with a very low mortality.

The main reasons for ICU admission of study patients were intoxication (16.5%), severe sepsis/septic shock (14.5%), trauma (14.0%), pulmonary (12.8%) and cardiac diseases (8.7%). The overall mortality of them was 8.7% (21/242). On admission day, 79.8% of the patients received less than 50% of their caloric requirements enterally, on the second and third day 59.7 and 51.1%, respectively. Concomitant gastrointestinal symptoms included absent/ abnormal bowel sounds (22% on admission day and 15% on the second day) and vomiting (16.4 and 16.5%, respectively). Intra-abdominal hypertension was observed in 38 patients (15.7%) during their ICU stay. The patients, in whom the goal for enteral feeding was not achieved after two days in ICU, had significantly higher mortality than the patients in whom the goal was achieved (12.5% vs. 4.4%, p = 0.021). The mean enteral caloric delivery by day three was 962 \u00b1 595 kcal/day in survivors compared to 441 \u00b1 450 in non-survivors (p = 0.001).

Low cholesterol and low HDL levels and high triglyceride levels are significantly related to the onset of infection and progression to sepsis. The lowest cholesterol and HDL levels were associated with increasing mortality, whereas discharge from the unit was correlated with higher cholesterol and HDL levels. This study revealed the negative prognostic value of hypercholesterolemia, low HDL levels and hypertriglyceridemia, suggesting that lipoproteins are a sensitive marker of infection and progression to sepsis.NUTRITIONAL MARKERS AS A SURROGATE OF SEVERITY OF ILLNESS: ASSOCIATION WITH ICU MORTALITY L.

Nutritional status has been associated with several outcomes in critically ill patients, including prolonged ventilatory dependence, increased infection rate, prolonged ICU length of stay (ICU LOS) and mortality.AIM. To study the influence of several markers of nutritional status on mortality.METHODS.Observational study regarding several nutritional markers (serum albumin, nitrogen balance and caloric deficit) routinely recorded on our ICU and its association with mortality. Appropriate descriptive statistics are presented Comparisons between groups were performed using Chi-square test, Student's t test or non-parametric Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis tests as appropriate. Analysis of the association between nutritional markers and mortality, estimated by the odds-ratio, unadjusted and adjusted for sex and SAPS II were calculated using logistic regression. Multiple logistic regression modelling was performed, using the stepwise forward method, with mortality as dependent variable and age, sex, nutritional markers and ICU variables (reason for ICU admission, SAPS II, ICU LOS) as independent variables. For hypothesis testing a value of P \\ 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 16.0 \u00d2 software package.RESULTS. 139 patients were included, from which 60 were male, mean age was 60 yearsold. Reason for admission was medical in 110 patients, surgical in 22 and trauma in 8 patients. Mean SAPS II was 46 and median ICU LOS was 11 days. Severity of illness (SAPS II) (OR 1.039; 95% CI 1.005; 1.074), nitrogen balance (OR 1.125; 95% CI 1.029; 1.231) and the need of mix nutrition support(OR 6.201; 95% CI 1.429; 36.906), were significantly associated with mortality in the logistic regression model.CONCLUSION.Nutritional markers were associated with a higher mortality. This hypothesis should be evaluated with more appropriate methodological approaches.USE OF MICRODIALYSISTO STUDY LIPID METABOLISM IN SEPTIC ICU PATIENTS. PRELIMINARY RESULTS M.

One hundred and two patients (687 days of NS) were studied: 53 medical, 27 trauma and 22 surgical patients. They were mainly male (69.6%) with a mean age 57.9 \u00b1 17.8 years and a mean SAPS II score 49.6 \u00b1 14.4. NS was started meanly 34 \u00b1 18.3 h after ICU admission and most of the times by enteral route feeding (89.2%). Target dose was achieved in 42.2% of the patients (median: day 5). NS delivery was: enteral 583 days (84.9%), parenteral 69 days (10.0%) and mixed 22 days (3.2%). EN was started in 75.8% of the cases with a standard polymeric diet. In 23.6% of the days NS was suspended due to gastrointestinal dysfunction (GI) (46.9%), airway management (6.8%), diagnostic exams (25.3%) and lack of route delivery (8.0%). NS period (OR = 1.30; CI = 1.18-1.43) was the only risk factor to suspension in a multivariate logistic regression model. EN was reduced in 9.8% of the days usually by GI dysfunction (84.8%). More than 80% of the prescribed volume was delivered in 68.3% of NS days. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the longer the time of NS the higher the risk of receiving less than 80% of NS protocol (OR = 1.56; CI = 1.41-1.72). The use of parenteral (OR = 0.14; CI = 0.04-0.47) or mixed (OR = 0.10; CI = 0.02-0.40) nutrition was associated with a NS delivery higher than 80%.

Scheduled surgery allows for a short stay in ICU and a low mortality rate (3.6%). Only 1.9% was readmitted within 48 h.Analyzing cause of death following discharge from ICU to surgical wards, 6.4% (0.9 + 5.5), we consider that the transfer of patients to an intermediate care unit(HDU) until stabilized would produce improved results and a more discerning selection of patients for surgery would decrease mortality rates (ICU = Intensive care unit, HDU = High dependency unit, MV = Mechanical ventilation, GIS = Gastrointestinal surgery, THS = Thoracic surgery, NUS = Neurosurgery, VAS = Vascular surgery, URO = Urology, MFS = Maxillofacial surgery).

We included 2997 patients, 606 (20%) of them had a malignancy, 567 (93%) had solid tumor and 39 (7%) had haematological cancer. Solid cancer patients were younger than non-cancer patients (62 \u00b1 15 vs. 68 \u00b1 5, p \\ 0.001). There was no difference in age between patients with haematological malignancies and non-cancer patients (63 \u00b1 15 vs. 68 \u00b1 5, p = 0.95). Patients with haematological cancer were more severely ill than solid cancer and non-cancer patients at admission, as assessed by higher APACHE II score, respectively (12 \u00b1 5 vs. 21 \u00b1 6 vs. 15 \u00b1 7, p \\ 0.001). In comparison to non-cancer patients, haematological cancer patients had sepsis more frequently (13% vs. 51%, p \\ 0.001) and needed mechanical ventilation more often (34% vs. 56%, p = 0.005) and for longer period (8 \u00b1 12 vs. 11 \u00b1 12, p = 0.031).

In accordance to previous studies, haematological cancer patients in our study had the highest mortality. We found that solid tumor patients can have a better prognosis than non-cancer patients admitted to ICU. The limitation of this result is that we did not discriminate the type and stage of the cancer among those with solid tumor.REFERENCE.

Classicals variables (such as IMV) associated with ICU's mortality in others studies with HMP were not in our preliminary data[1, 2]. 2.

ICU mortality was evaluated along with reasons for ICU admission and organ support. Statistics were performed using T test (Mann Whitney). Results are expressed as median [interquartile range]. RESULTS. There were 66 admissions involving 56 patients (49 male). 47 patients had alcohol related liver disease (8 with Hepatitis C). Median (IQR) age was 52y [46-59.5] and ICU length of stay was 5 [2-11] days. 22 patients died (1 on his 2nd admission) giving an overall ICU mortality of 39%. Patients who died had significantly higher serum bilirubin levels on admission to ITU (survivors (median 41 [26-88]) vs. non-survivors (median 135.5  [92-495], p \\ 0.001). However, there was no significant difference between survivors and non-survivors in age, presence of encephalopathy or ascites, hospital days prior to admission, length of stay on ICU, markers of infection, and serum creatinine levels. 25 patients were either admitted with sepsis or developed an episode of sepsis during their stay (only 2 documented episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis). One patient developed sepsis on two admissions. 17 patients died (68%). All were treated with antibiotics; 6 were treated with steroids for varying lengths of time (all died). 18 patients were given inotropic support (4 survived), 17 renal replacement therapy (5 survived) and 12 received both(3 survived). 26 patients had UGB (3 were admitted twice with UGB) during their ITU stay. All underwent endoscopy with bleeding oesophageal varices diagnosed in 25 procedures (duodenal ulcer in 2), all of whom were treated with band ligation, terlipressin and systemic antibiotics. 12 patients died (46%) of which 7 had a co-existent diagnosis of sepsis.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF208": {"text": ". 1.

To evaluate intraluminal contamination, we examined the bacteria isolated in the inline bacterial filters which were attached to downstream of the injection ports.RESULTS. The incidence of bacterial contamination was significantly different between the groups (Test group 2/151 (1.3%) vs. Comparator group 11/179 (6.2%), p = 0.04). There was no correlation between the microbial contamination rate and in-situ time of filters or numbers of injections.CONCLUSIONS. The use of the protection cap for needleless injection device decreased microbial transfer from the injection port to the intraluminal fluid pathway and lowered the risk of CR-BSI. METHODS. Data were collected on device-associated nosocomial infection (DANI) in patients older than 16 years that remain for a period longer than 24 h in intensive care units in Colombia. We included patients with pneumonia associated with mechanical ventilation (VAP) central venous catheter-associated bacteremia (CVCB) and infections associated with urinary bladder catheter (UIAUC). The definitions of these infections are the same used by the GRUVECO group RESULTS. The germs most commonly isolated were Klebsiella Pneumonia comprehensively in a 19.8%, 18.3% in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli in 15.5% when analyzed all together.When analysing germs by disease subgroup we found that the germ most commonly isolated for VAP was Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a 24.4%, for CVCB was K. pneumonia in a 16.57%, and for UIAUC was E. coli in a 37.2%.When analyzing the profiles of resistance we found that in the 144 of the infections caused by E. coli, 40.94% were positive for extended spectrum beta-lactamase and in 182 infections caused by K. pneumiae 31.31% were positive for ESBL. No test was conducted for Amp C associated resistance in 67.07% of infections cause by K. pneumonie and 83.55% of infections due to E. coli.It was found that the sensitivity of fourth-generation cephalosporins for P. Aeruginosa in VAP was 60.43 and 62.76% for carbapenems.For K. Pneumonia in CVCB was 80.95 and 96.42% for carbapenems and for E. coli to a fourth-generation cephalosporins was 82 and 100% for carbapenems INTRODUCTION.

On PICU, the average predicted risk of mortality was 5.23% and the actual mortality was higher than predicted at 6.52%.On PICU, 50% of the total admissions had a primary diagnosis of congenital disorder followed by 13% with Neuromuscular disorders.

The outcomes for patients aged 16-19 years are similar in both Paediatric and Adult Intensive Care. However, there is significant variation in the diagnostic profile.Further larger scale studies are needed to develop a standardised and pragmatic approach to patients aged 16-19 years. INTRODUCTION.

Between 1 July 2002 and 30 June 2007 a total of 98 self-injured patients and 2251 conventionally injured patients were admitted to the ICU at the Alfred Hospital following traumatic injuries. Self-injured patients made up 4.17% of the trauma admissions during the study period. Self-injured patients were younger (mean 38.7 years \u00b1 13.3 versus 42.6 years \u00b1 20.4, p = 0.043) and more likely to be female (40.9% versus 25.9%, p = 0.002). Injury severity was similar in the two groups (ISS 28.8 \u00b1 17.13 versus 27.9 \u00b1 12.8, p = 0.291).There was no difference in hospital length of stay for self injured patients compared to conventionally injured patients (median16.8 days, IQR 7.2-39.1 versus 14.8 days, IQR 7.9-26, p = 0.205). ICU length of stay (5 days, IQR 2-12 for both groups, p = 0.58) was the same for both groups. Patients who sustained self-inflicted injuries had a higher mortality (22.4% versus 14.8%, p = 0.041). After adjustment for age and severity of illness, self-injury remained significantly associated with increased mortality (odds ratio 2.0, 95%CI 1.15-3.48, p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS. Self injury is an independent risk factor for mortality after trauma. This supports previous studies [2] . Patients who have self-inflicted injuries may be subject to negative preconceptions by clinicians, and decisions to withdraw care may be more likely to be made or made earlier. Alternatively they may be more prone to mortality and morbidity in a way that is not well described by the ISS. It is possible that investments in psychiatric care may reduce the incidence of such injuries, their associated mortality and the demand on scarce ICU resources. METHODS.

Investigation of the pleuropulmonary (PP) pathologies in ICU is based on clinical examination, chest X-ray which is poorly accurate and thoracic CT scan which has become the gold standard. However, its use is limited by the risks of intrahospital transport of patients, X-ray radiation and availability. PP ultrasonography (US) is an alternative.

A PP US was performed by the same operator before the CT scan was done and consisted in examination of 6 areas by lung. Semiological signs for pleural effusion (with quantification), alveolar consolidation and pneumothorax were recorded. The diagnostic performances were evaluated by calculation of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV), positive and negative likelihood ratios (PLR and NLR) and diagnostic accuracy (DA) in comparison to the CT scan interpreted by a radiologist blinded of the US results. When possible, US was performed by two investigators blinded from each other for evaluation of interobserver agreement (Kappa coefficient). CONCLUSIONS. Even in an inexperienced ICU, PP US is feasible, reproducible, and may be accurate enough to reduce the need for thoracic CT scan. Diagnostic accuracy of PP US depends of the pathology considered. The best performances concern diagnosis and quantification of the pleural effusions. INTRODUCTION.

A regional EIT-score was calculated, which incorporates the increase (+1) or decrease (-1) in regional ventilation within each ROI in comparison to EIT baseline data (T1).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "METHODS."}, {"text": "In all patients a significant decrease in EELV occurred after OSP, which was pronounced in the dependent lung regions. There was no significant difference between the groups in the regional EIT-score at T2, whereby the EELV loss in the EIT corresponded well with the FRC measurement. After CONCLUSIONS. The regional EIT-score is practical to describe changes in regional ventilation and matches with FRC, oxygenation and pulmonary compliance. Patients after cardiac surgery benefit from RM after OSP irrespective of the initial FRC. RM and PEEP after OSP lead to a long-term preservation of regional lung volume in lung-healthy patients. INTRODUCTION. There is a high prevalence of intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) in intensive care patients. In ARDS, the measurement of Intra-abdominal Pressure (IAP) could be important for a better interpretation of respiratory mechanics, and appropriate setting of the ventilator. Although prone position (PP) is considered simple and safe, it could be associated with an increase in IAP and potential adverse effects. The same applies to semi-recumbent position. We evaluated the changes of IAP in response to changes of body positioning, and different positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RESULTS."}, {"text": "Nine ARDS patients were included. The values for IAP in supine (head of the bed elevated to 0\u00b0and 45\u00b0), and PP, were registered at PEEP 5 and 15 cmH 2 O, after 15 min in each position and level of PEEP. IAP was measured by the bladder pressure method. All patients were sedated-paralyzed, and ventilated in volume-controlled ventilation with TV of 6 ml/kg. FiO 2 and RR were adjusted to maintain O 2 sat [ 93% and PaCO 2 \\ 55 mmHg. Respiratory mechanic and hemodynamic status were evaluated during the study. IAP values were compared with t test. p \\ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTS. We analyzed 9 ARDS patients, mean age 60 \u00b1 21 years (3 male), 5 medical-4 surgical admissions, APACHE II 22 \u00b1 6, SOFA 11 \u00b1 3, SAPS II 46 \u00b1 10, 50 \u00b1 18 h of mechanical ventilation (MV), PaO 2 /FiO 2 168 \u00b1 52, and Compliance 34 \u00b1 5 ml/cmH 2 O. Mean IAP was 11 \u00b1 5 mmHg before the study. In supine, the effect on IAP showed a trend to significance when changing the position from 0\u00b0to 45\u00b0(p = 0.058). There were no differences when IAP was registered with PEEP 5 and 15 cmH 2 O in supine position, either at 0\u00b0or 45\u00b0, (p = 0.251). Likewise, we did not find significant differences in IAP when comparing supine versus prone position for each level of PEEP (p = 0.145 for PEEP 5, and p = 0.064 for PEEP 15). We did not find difference in IAP between patients with primary vs secondary ARDS at PEEP 5 cmH 2 O. Patients with secondary ARDS had higher levels of IAP than primary ARDS patients at 45\u00b0with 15 cmH 2 O of PEEP (p = 0.028), and it was at limit of significance when we comparing these subgroups in prone at PEEP 15 cmH 2 O (p = 0.051).Only patients who increased IAP [ 5 mmHg at 45\u00b0with respect to 0\u00b0, showed a significant decrease on compliance (6 of 9 pts, from 38 \u00b1 4 to 30 \u00b1 4 ml/cmH 2 O, p \\ 0.012). We did not find any significant variation in hemodynamic variables with the changes on IAP values.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "METHODS."}, {"text": "The results obtained suggest that changes in position and PEEP, in ARDS patients produce at most mild changes in IAP. Secondary ARDS patients ventilated with 15 cmH 2 O of PEEP in semi-recumbent position (and probably in prone too), exhibit higher IAP than primary ARDS patients. Semi-recumbent position can affect significantly the compliance when IAP increased [5 mmHg from 0\u00b0to 45\u00b0. However, larger studies would be needed to confirm these findings.GRANT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. FONDECYT 11070156. AIMS. Positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) is applied in artificially ventilated patients with the intention to avoid the ventilation synchronous opening and closing of the alveoli. It is postulated that this cyclic recruitment and de-recruitment is one of the main causes of ventilator induced lung injury. Especially in patients with acute lung injury (ALI), an extremely inhomogeneous regional lung function can be found. Thus, regional differences exist in the onset of lung opening, leading to different regional time delay (RTD) in ventilation. Wrigge et al. have shown that RTD correlates with the regional lung function in an animal model of artificial intra-and extrapulmonary acute lung injury (ALI) and can be monitored by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) (Wrigge et al. Crit Care Med 36:903-909, 2008) . We postulated that this time delay exists when different regional inspiratory pressure levels are needed to open up the alveoli.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1268, "end": 1314, "text": "(Wrigge et al.

In these sedated and paralysed patients, a low flow inspiratory pressure volume manoeuvre with constant gas flow of 4 l/min starting at a PEEP level of 0 cmH 2 O was realised. EIT examinations were performed using the Goe-MF II EIT device (Cardinal Health, Hoechberg, Germany). Electrical currents (50 kHz, 5 mArms) were applied through adjacent pairs of electrodes in a rotating mode. The EIT data were acquired at a rate of 25 scans per second. A back-projection image reconstruction procedure was used. Regional opening pressure was defined as the value of global airway pressure at the time point when the regional lung areas opened up. The regional opening pressures were compared with the point of maximal compliance change (Pmci,i) on the inflation limb of the pressure volume curve.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "METHODS."}, {"text": "The linear regression analysis showed a good correlation between the opening pressure and RTD in all lung areas in the lung healthy group (ventral: r 2 = 0.69; middle r 2 = 0.81; dorsal r 2 = 0.94).

In all patients, there was a significant difference between the global Pmci,i (8.56 \u00b1 2.97 cmH 2 O) and the regional opening pressures measured by EIT (ventral: 3.57 \u00b1 2.8; middle: 4.19 \u00b1 2.16; dorsal: 6.07 \u00b1 2.85 cmH 2 O).CONCLUSIONS. The linear correlation between regional opening pressure and RTD support our hypothesis that RTD is related to different pressure level needed to open up the regional lung areas. The knowledge of regional opening pressures allows the optimisation of PEEP during mechanical ventilation based on absolute pressure values. RESULTS. The first 13 trainees have been enrolled in December 2008 and completed the training program in January 2009. Success rate at first attempt was 95% and complication rate was 0%.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia is the most fatal of hospital infections, with mortality rates of 30-60%.

INTRODUCTION. Many strategies have been done to prevent ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) and simple rules, such as maintainance of patients at semi recumbent position on the bed, intermittent sedation, daily assessment of readiness for weaning, prefer orotraqueal and orogastric tubes, oral hygiene and avoid gastric hiperdistension are related to VAP prevention.OBJECTIVES.

The data were analized with Epi Info 3.3.2 program.RESULTS. The educational program was developed during a one month period covering four groups of health care professionals who worked in different day and night shifts.

Multiple (root) causes contribute into the cascade of incidents and errors. Root causes are not always clear and visible. Applying the PRISMA method for analysing incidents improves the comprehension of incident cascade. Measures for improving patient safety can be better founded if root causes are clear.
