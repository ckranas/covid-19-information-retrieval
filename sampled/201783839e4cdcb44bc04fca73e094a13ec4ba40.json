            "text": "The failure of Medicare to cover dental care has engendered some (albeit not much) public debate. In 2003, Congress enacted the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (Medicare Part D). By 2009 Medicare provided $56.6 billion in benefi t payments for outpatient prescription drugs and Medicaid paid 15.7 billion for outpatient prescription drugs (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2010 ) . Benefi ciaries provided billions more in the form of monthly Part D premiums. The expense of the Medicare prescription drug program and the controversy surrounding its enactment may well have eroded public support for increased Medicare coverage. So while there has been no shortage of effort paid to improving Medicare, the one common theme in all of the recent initiatives is that dental care has been conspicuously 1 A new study by Hedlund, Jeffcoat, Genco and Tanna funded by CIGNA of patients with Type II diabetes and periodontal disease found that medical costs of patients who received maintenance therapy were $2483.51 per year lower than patients who did not. CIGNA, Research from CIGNA Supports Potential Association between Treated Gum Disease and Reduced Medical Costs for People with Diabetes, http://newsroom.cigna.com/NewsReleases/research-from-cigna-supports-potential-association-between-treated-gum-disease-and-reduced-medical-costs-for-people-with-diabetes. omitted. As a result, 43 million Medicare recipients in 2009 (US Census Bureau 2011 ) continue to have no dental insurance coverage through Medicare. 2 Medicaid dental coverage is an optional benefi t that states may or may not elect to provide. In Medicaid, both the State and the Federal government provide funds to cover healthcare services to eligible patients. The bulk of the money comes from the Federal government. Because the Medicaid dollars are limited and coverage for systemic diseases has precedence, Medicaid coverage of dental care has been spotty. Even where it has been provided, payments to dental providers have been so low as to make it diffi cult or impossible for Medicaid benefi ciaries to obtain adequate dental care (Broadwater 2009 ) . The 2008 recession increased the number of Medicaid eligible individuals nationwide. Further, the federal budget defi cits of the past few years have reduced the federal contribution to state Medicaid programs. The combination of increases in the number of benefi ciaries and diminished revenues has caused a number of states to eliminate or curtail Medicaid dental coverage (eHow 2011 ; Mullins et al. 2004 ) . The result, 49 million Medicaid benefi ciaries in the US (US Census Bureau 2011 ) in 2009 either had no dental insurance coverage or inadequate coverage.",

Moreover, diabetics have a six times greater risk for worsening of glycemic control over time compared to those without periodontitis and, periodontitis is associated with an increased risk for diabetic complications. For example, in one study more than 80% of diabetics with periodontitis experienced one or more major cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular events compared to 21% of the diabetic subjects without periodontitis (Thorstensson et al. 1996 ) . Also, a longitudinal study of 600 type 2 diabetics found that the death rate from ischemic heart disease was 2.3 times higher in subjects with severe periodontitis and the death rate from diabetic nephropathy was 8.5 times higher (Saremi et al. 2005 ) . Clinical trials have demonstrated that treatment of periodontal disease improved glycemic control in diabetics (Miller et al. 1992 ) . Moreover, investigations have found an association between periodontal disease and the development of glucose intolerance in non-diabetics (Saito et al. 2004 ) . While it is diffi cult to establish causality and it is possible that other factors infl uence periodontal disease and medical complications, these studies suggest that treatment of periodontitis substantially improves health and greatly reduces medical complications related to diabetes.",

Hung and colleagues evaluated the association between baseline number of teeth and incident tooth loss and peripheral arterial disease. They determined that incident tooth loss was signifi cantly associated with PAD, particularly among men with periodontal disease potentially implying an oral infection-infl ammation pathway (Hund et al. 2003 ) . The same group of researchers used the population enrolled in the Health Professionals' Follow-Up Study (41,000 men free of cardiovascular disease and diabetes at baseline) to assess the relationship between tooth loss and periodontal disease and ischemic stroke. Controlling for a wide range of factors including smoking, obesity, and dietary factors, the researchers found a \"modest\" Association between baseline periodontal disease history and ischemic stroke . As early as 1993 DeStefano and colleagues found that among 9760 subjects, those with periodontitis had a 25% increased risk of coronary heart disease relative to those without. The association was particularly high among young men. The authors questioned whether the association was causal or not, suggesting that it might be a more general indicator of personal hygiene and possibly health care practices (DeStefano et al. 1993 ) . In 2000 Wu and colleagues used data from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and its Epidemiologic Follow-Up Study to examine the association between periodontal disease and cerebrovascular accidents. The study found that periodontitis was a signifi cant risk factor for total CVA, in particular, for non-hemorrhagic stroke (Wu et al. 2000 ) .",

They found that periodontitis was more prevalent in patients with rheumatoid arthritis than in the control group and that patients who were seropositive for rheumatoid factor were more likely to have moderate to severe periodontitis than patients who were RF negative and also that patients who were positive for anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies were more likely to have moderate to severe periodontitis (Redman et al. 2010 ) .

Approximately 52% of direct medical expenditures were incurred by people over 65. Indirect expenditures included lost workdays, restricted productivity mortality and permanent disability -a total of $39.8 billion. All told, diabetes was found to be responsible for $160 billion of $865 billion in total expenditures. Per capita medical expenditures totaled $13,000 annually for people with diabetes and $2600 for people without diabetes (Hogan et al. 2002 ) . More recently, Dall and colleagues estimated that the US national economic burden of prediabetes and diabetes had reached $218 billion in 2007, $153 million in higher medical costs and $65 billion in reduced productivity. Annual cost per case was estimated at $2,900 for undiagnosed diabetes and 10,000 for type 2 diabetes (Dall et al. 2010 ) . The costs of caring for people with diabetes have risen both because the numbers of diabetics has been increasing and because the per capita costs of care have increased. The number of diabetics increased from 5.8 million on 1980 to 14.7 million in 2004 (Ashkenazy and Abrahamson 2006 ) . A recent report by the UnitedHealth Group Center for Health Reform & Modernization provides a dire estimation -that more than 50% of adult Americans could have diabetes (15%) or prediabetes (37%) by 2020 at a cost of $3.35 trillion over the decade. This compares with current estimates of 12% of the population with diabetes and 28% with prediabetes, or 40%. These estimates conclude that diabetes and prediabetes will account for 10% of total healthcare spending in 2020 at an annual cost of $500 billion, up from an estimated $194 billion in 2010 (UnitedHealth Center for Health Reform and Modernization 2010 ) . Average annual spending over the next decade by payer type is $103 billion for private health insurance, $204 billion for Medicare, $11 billion for Medicaid and $16.6 billion for the uninsured.",

The American Heart Association estimates the 2010 cost of cardiovascular disease and stroke to be $324 billion in direct expenditures and $41.7 billion for productivity losses due to morbidity and $137.4 billion in lost productivity due to mortality (present value of lost wages at 3%) (Lloyd- ) . The Centers for Disease Control estimates that during 2007-2009 50 million Americans had selfreported doctor diagnosed arthritis, 21 million of them with activity limitations (Cheng et al. 2010 ) . Cisternas and colleagues estimated that total expenditures by US adults with arthritis increased from $252 billion in 1997 to $353 billion in 2005. Most of the increase was attributable to people who had co-occurring chronic conditions (Cisternas et al. 2009 ) . The Cisternas study appears to aggregate all medical care expenditures by people with arthritis (which would include expenditures to treat diabetes and cardiovascular disease).

Recent health reform has provided for the issuance of health insurance to the uninsured by state exchanges. Aggressive dental care that saved 10% of costs attributable to diabetes, cardiovascular disease and arthritis could save the exchanges $10 billion per year. And, if greater proportions of costs can be saved or if the 2020 estimates of costs are low, potential benefi ts will be even larger. Once again, it would be important to know whether aggressive dental care could produce such savings and how much. Ide and colleagues found that people who were treated for periodontitis incurred 21% higher health care costs than those who were free of periodontal disease (Ide et al. 2007) . Similarly, Albert, et al., found medical costs associated with diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease were signifi cantly higher for enrollees who were treated for periodontitis than for other dental conditions (Albert et al. 2006) .

Suppose health insurance companies, understanding the benefi ts from dental care, were to require their private employer customers to cover the costs of dental care. How much would all of this cost? How would it compare to the benefi ts that may be available? In order to estimate the potential costs of providing enhanced coverage for dental care we start use the CMS estimates of national health care spending for dental services and Statistical Abstract of the US estimates for Medicare enrollment, Medicaid enrollment, private health insurance enrollment and uninsured persons. Based on the estimate that half of private employers with health insurance provided dental insurance coverage we estimate that of the private health insurance enrollment one half would have dental insurance coverage and one half would not.

In our 2009 example there were 43 million Medicare benefi ciaries including 9 million dual eligibles. Accordingly, the estimates would cover the 34 million Medicare benefi ciaries that are not dual eligible at a cost equal to the per capita cost of private dental insurance ($494.66) less amounts that Medicare is already paying for dental services ($6.73 per person). The result provides an estimate of the cost of covering all Medicare benefi ciaries for dental services at a level equivalent to private health insurance.

If quality dental coverage saves health care costs attributable to diabetes, cardiovascular disease and rheumatoid arthritis then the exchanges will have an incentive to provide quality dental coverage to reduce costs. Accordingly, we estimated the cost of providing dental coverage equivalent to private dental insurance coverage through the exchanges. Again we assume that the costs of such coverage will be equivalent to the number of uninsured persons multiplied by the annual per capita cost of coverage. 5 For the 2009 example, this would refl ect coverage for 52 million people at $494.66 per person, a total of $24.9 billion.

            "text": "Heretofore the case for expanding Medicare coverage to include dental care has taken the form of \"benefi t\" to patients rather than benefi t to health insurance programs and society and has been cast in emotional and political terms. For example, Oral Health America grades \"America's commitment to providing oral health access to the elderly\" (Oral Health America 2003 ) . In truth, there is no American commitment to providing oral health access to any age group, much less the elderly. Rubenstein notes that \"at least one commentator has suggested that the dental profession should join with senior citizen groups when the time is right to ask Congress to expand Medicare to cover oral health\" (Rubenstein 2005 ) . Rubenstein emphasizes that \"calls for action\" are \"mere words\" unless they are accompanied by political actions that health policy professionals and the dental profession must help promote (Rubenstein 2005 ) . Another commentator has suggested that \"as soon as the debate over Medicare prescription drug coverage and, the debate to provide dental care coverage for the elderly may soon begin\" (Manski 2001 ) . Rubenstein, again suggests that \"the dental community must convince Americans, and particularly aging boomers, that oral health is integral to all health, and for that reason, retiree dental benefi ts are an important issue\". In truth, a decade of defi cit spending and public distaste for out of control program costs in the Medicare and Medicaid programs as well as the unpopularity of the process that was used to provide Medicare prescription drug coverage (with perceived abuses by the health insurance and drug lobbies) and national health reform makes it unlikely that the public would be willing to approve expansions in insurance coverage for dental care \"for its own sake\" or \"as the right thing\" or to \"benefi t seniors.\" What this political climate has produced is an arena in which a good idea that could provide appropriate return on investment for society might well be rejected out of hand based on political history of health insurance coverage. As a result, it is incumbent on policymakers, medical and dental research scientists and health economists to investigate and confi rm the potential savings that expansion of dental insurance coverage has the potential to produce and to develop hard evidence regarding potential costs of the expansion prior to, not as a part of, political efforts aimed at dental coverage expansion. A responsible, well informed effort to expand dental coverage may well go far to restore public confi dence in the health policy process.",

In 2008 health care costs in US were $2.2 Trillion. There have been numerous reports on health disparities, the burden of chronic diseases, increasing healthcare costs and the need for change. Long-term economic benefi ts associated with the cost of care are dependent upon integrating oral health with medicine. This is particularly true as it relates to the management of those conditions which impact the economics of healthcare the most. As examples, 96% of Medicare costs and 83% of Medicaid costs are in managing chronic health conditions (Partnership for Solutions National Program Offi ce 2004 ) . More than 40% of the U.S. population has one or more chronic condition (Cartwright-Smith 2011 ) and in 2006, 76% of Medicare spending was on patients with fi ve or more chronic diseases (Swartz 2011 ) . Effective management of health care resources and information are critical to the economic well-being of our healthcare system. We can no longer afford to manage care in isolation. Integration of care between medicine and dentistry holds much promise in terms of reducing the cost of care and an integrated Medical-Dental Electronic Healthcare Record (iEHR) is the vehicle that will lead to downstream cost savings.",

Section 121 of the Benefi ts Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 mandated CMS to conduct a disease management demonstration project. April 1, 2005, as an effort to reduce the cost of care and improve quality associated with chronic diseases, CMS partnered with ten premier health systems to effectively manage chronic diseases in a Medicare Physician Group Practice Demonstration (PGP). It was the fi rst pay-for-performance initiative for physicians under the Medicare program (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2010 ) . It involved giving additional payments to providers based on practice effi ciency and improved management of chronically ill patients. Participants included ten multispecialty group practices nationwide, with a total of more than 5,000 physicians, who care for more than 200,000 Medicare benefi ciaries (Frieden 2006 ) . The chronic diseases that were targeted were based on occurrence in the population and included diabetes, heart failure, coronary artery disease, and hypertension (Frieden 2006 Under the PGP, physician groups continued to be paid under regular Medicare fee schedules and had the opportunity to share in savings from enhancements in patient care management. Physician groups could earn performance payments which were divided between cost effi ciency for generating savings and performance on 32 quality measures phased in during the demonstration as follows: year 1, 10 measures, year 2, 27 measures and years 3 and 4 having 32 quality measures. For each of the 4 years only the University of Michigan Faculty Group Practice and Marshfi eld Clinic, earned performance payments for improving the quality and cost effi ciency of care. A large part of the success of this project was attributed to being able to extract, evaluate, and monitor key clinical data associated with the specifi c disease and to manage that data through an electronic health record (Table 4 .4 ).",

Accountable Care Organization (ACO) is a term used to describe partnerships between healthcare providers to establish accountability and improved outcomes for the patients. In a CMS workshop on October 5, 2010, Don Berwick, the administrator of CMS, stated \"An ACO will put the patient and family at the center of all its activities\u2026\" An emerging model of an ACO is the patient-centered medical home (PCMH). PCMH is at the center of many demonstration projects. ACOs were derived from studies piloted by CMS. Since funds provided by CMS, do not cover routine dental care as part of the patient management or quality and cost objectives CMS ACO studies are limited if they become models for the PCMH, due to the exclusion of dental.",

As of this writing, dentistry remains largely separate from medical reimbursement mechanisms such as shared billing, integrated consults, diagnosis, shared problem lists, and government coverage. For example, CMS does not cover routine dental care. Dentistry is also working to establish its own \"dental home\" with patients.

The case for medical and dental professionals' comanaging patients has been suggested for almost the past century, in 1926 William Gies reported that \"The frequency of periodic examination gives dentists exceptional opportunity to note early signs of many types of illnesses outside the domain of dentistry\" (Gies 1926 ) . As described by Dr. Richard Nagelberg, DDS \"The convergence of dental and medical care is underway. Our patients will be the benefi ciaries of this trend. For too long, we have provided dental care in a bubble, practicing -to a large degree -apart from other health-care providers. Even when we consulted with our medical colleagues, it was to fi nd out if premedication was necessary, get clearance for treatment of a medically compromised patient, or fi nd out the HbA1c level of a diabetic individual, rather than providing true patient co-management. We have made diagnoses and provided treatments without the benefi t of tests, reports, metrics, and other information that predict the likelihood of disease development and progression, as well as favorable treatment outcomes. We have practiced in this manner not due to negligence, but because of the limitations of tools that were available to us\" (Nagelberg 2011 ) . Integrated medical/dental records need to be a tool in a providers' toolbox. In the case of Marshfi eld Clinic, dental was not included in their past CMS demonstration project as dental is not a CMS covered benefi t, and thus not part of the demonstration. However, as a leader in healthcare, the Marshfi eld Clinic recognizes the importance of data integration for both increased quality and cost savings. \"Marshfi eld Clinic believes the best health care comes from an integrated dental/medical approach,\" said Michael Murphy, director, Business Development for Cattails Software. Integration enhances communication between providers and can ultimately lead to better management of complex diseases with oral-systemic connection, avoidance of medical errors, and improved public health.",

As such they have pursued the economic and outcome benefi ts of integrated medical -dental clinical decision making. As an example, in 2009 there was a study conducted by the University of Michigan, commissioned by the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Foundation ( 2009 ) , the study included 21,000 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan members diagnosed with diabetes who had access to dental care, and had continuous coverage for at least 1 year. With regular periodontal care, it was observed diabetes related medical costs were reduced by 10%. When compounding chronic health complications were also examined, the study showed a 20% reduction in cost related to the treatment of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes and heart disease. A 30% reduction in cost related to treatment of kidney disease for patients with diabetes and kidney disease. And a 40% reduction in costs related to treating congestive heart failure for patients with diabetes and congestive heart failure. According to a joint statement by lead researchers, and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan executives, \"Our results are consistent with an emerging body of evidence that periodontal disease\u2026it addresses quality of care and health care costs for all Michigan residents.\" Also, at the Institute for Oral Health conference in November 2007 Joseph Errante, D.D.S., Vice President, Blue Cross Blue Shield of MA reported that 2003 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts claims data showed medical costs for diabetics who accessed dental care for prevention and periodontal services averaged $558/month, while medical costs for diabetics who didn't get dental care were about $702/month (Errante 2007 ) . Similarly insured individuals with cardiovascular diseases who accessed dental care had lower medical costs, $238/month lower than people who did not seek dental treatment (Errante 2007 ) . The cost is $144 less per visit for those diabetics who accessed prevention and periodontal services. Those savings could be translated into access to care or additional benefi ts for more individuals.",

Over 12% of all births in the U.S. are delivered preterm, with many infants at risk of birth defects ( Martin et al. 2009 ) . According to a January 2006 statement issued by Cigna, announcing their CIGNA Oral Health Maternity Program, \"the program was launched in response to mounting research indicating an increased probability of preterm birth for those with gum disease. These research-based, value-added programs are designed to help improve outcomes and reduce expense\" (CIGNA 2006 ) . The program was initially designed to offer extended dental benefi ts free of charge to members who were expecting mothers, citing \"research supporting the negative and costly impact periodontal disease has on both mother and baby.\" According to research cited by CIGNA, expecting mothers with chronic periodontal disease during the second trimester are seven times more likely to deliver preterm (before 37th week), and the costs associated with treating premature newborns is an average of 15 times more during their fi rst year, and premature newborns have dramatically more healthcare challenges throughout their life. CIGNA also cited the correlation between periodontal disease and low birth weight, pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes as additional rationale to support extended dental benefi ts to expecting mothers. Six months later CIGNA initiated Well Aware for Better Health, an extended benefi ts free of charge program for diabetic and cardiovascular disease patients aimed at \"turning evidence into action by enhancing dental benefi ts for participants in disease management\" programs. It is interesting to note, not only does CIGNA offer extended dental benefi t to targeted groups, they also reimburse members for any out-of-pocket expenses associated to their dental care (co-pays, etc.) In 2006, Columbia University researchers conducted a 2-year retrospective study of 116,306 Aetna PPO members with continuous medical and dental insurance, exhibiting one of three chronic conditions (diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular disease) (Aetna 2008 ) . Researchers found members who received periodontal treatments incurred higher initial per member per month medical costs, but ultimately achieved signifi cantly lower health screening (Episode Risk Group/ERG) risk scores than peers receiving little or no dental care. Convinced by the data and understanding lower risk scores ultimately leads to healthier people and cost savings, Aetna initiated the Dental/Medical Integration (DMI) Program in 2006. Aetna's DMI program offers enhanced benefi ts in the form of free-of-charge extended benefi t dental care to Aetna's 37.2 million Indemnity, PPO and Managed Choice medical plan members, specifi cally targeting members deemed at-risk, including those who are pregnant, diabetic, and/or have cardiovascular disease and have not been to a dentist in 1 year As a result of various outreach methods during the pilot, 63% of at-risk members who had not been to a dentist in the previous 12 months, sought dental care (Aetna 2008 ) . \"The fi ndings from this latest study we conducted continue to show that members with certain conditions who are engaged in seeking preventive care, such as regular dental visits, can improve their overall health and quality of life,\" said Alan Hirschberg, head of Aetna Dental (Aetna 2008 ) .",

After subtracting the expense of the IT investment, there was a net savings of $3 billion for the VA during the 10 years covered by the study (McBride 2011 ) . Furthermore, the study estimated that \"more than 86 percent of the savings were due to eliminating duplicated tests and reducing medical errors. The rest of the savings came from lower operating expenses and reduced workload.\" Independent studies show that the VA system does better on many measures, especially preventive services and chronic care, than the private sector and Medicare. VA offi cials say \"its [integrated] technology has helped cut down hospitalizations and helped patients live longer\" (Zhang 2009 ) . Recently, the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported on a tragic loss of life due to the systemic nature of oral health. A study found oral bacteria called Fusobacterium nucleatum was the likely culprit in infecting a 35-year-old woman's fetus through her bloodstream (Carroll 2010 ) . The doctors determined that the same strain of oral bacteria found in the woman's mouth was in the deceased baby's stomach and lungs. Integrated records would provide critical data to the Obstetrician including oral health issues and when the patient had her last dental exam. How does one measure the economic impact of a life not lived and another derailed by such tragedy?",

For example, if an integrated record saved providers 5 min per hour of patient care, that would be 40 min per day. Imagine giving a physician or dentist 40 min more a day. In a capitated system, this allows for more patients to be seen in a day for roughly the same amount of expenditure. In a production based clinic this allows more patients to be seen and more charges per day. In either case, the investment into informatics is covered.

According to (NICDR 2011), overall \"dental caries in the baby teeth of children 2-11 declined from the early 1970s until the mid 1990s. From the mid 1990s until the most recent (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) ) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, this trend has reversed: a small but signifi cant increase in primary decay was found. This trend reversal was more severe in younger children.\" Disparities in children's oral health and access to care persist by age, income \u2022 level, race and ethnicity, and parental education level (Edelstein and Chinn 2009 ) . Of concern, the latest increase was actually in a traditionally low-risk group of young children (Dye and Thornton-Evans 2010 ) . The human and economic costs of early childhood caries are substantial \u2022 (Casamassimo et al. 2009 ) . According to Catalanotto ( 2010 ) , health consequences include\u2026 extreme pain, spread of infection/facial cellulitis, even death (Otto - 2007 ) diffi culty chewing, poor weight gain falling off the growth curve (Acs et al. - 1999 ) risk of dental decay in adult teeth (Broadbent et al. - 2005 ; Li and Wang 2002 ) crooked bite (malocclusion) -Children with special health care needs (CSHCN) may be at higher risk for oral \u2022 disease and diffi culties accessing care. Analyzing data from the National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, (Lewis 2009 ) found that \"CSHCN are more likely to be insured and to receive preventive dental care at equal or higher rates than children without special health care needs. Nevertheless, CSHCN, particularly lower income and severely affected, are more likely to report unmet dental care need compared with unaffected children.\" Children who were both low-income and severely affected had 13.4 times the likelihood of unmet dental care needs, Dental care is the highest unmet health care need of children; 4.6 million children \u2022 had unmet dental care needs because families could not afford care compared with 2.8 million with unmet medical needs for the same reasons (CDC 2008 ) , According to the National Survey of Children's Health, children are 2.6 times as \u2022 likely to lack dental as medical insurance (Lewis et al. 2007 ) ,",

Following is a set of local \"best practices\" from Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, which may help other children's hospitals in planning acquisition of an integrated pediatric EHR system. Integrated (medical-dental) EHR technologies are becoming more widely available outside the Federal government sector (see integrated models E1 and E2 in Fig. 1.3 ).

            "text": "1. Minimize registration and dual databases . Patient registration takes time and requiring both a stand-alone dental and a medical patient registration inhibits cost-effective fl ow of services. Integration allows for the use of single demographics information for all clinics in the comprehensive care system serving the patient. Clinicians always have an updated health history on patients, if they have been a patient of record. If not, and for a dental clinic that sees walk-ins, a brief \"critical\" dental health history can be completed on paper by a parent and scanned into the eMR. In designing an integrated medical-dental record for patients of record, the system can sort essential health history elements into a brief focused dental history without the detail needed by other medical specialty clinics. Kioskdriven electronic health histories for those children who are new to clinic similar to those used in airline travel could be considered if feasible in busy clinics. 2. For charting, no more key/mouse strokes than with paper . Some commercial dental record products try to accomplish too much. Moving from paper to electronics should be driven in part by effi ciencies. The tooth chart, which is an essential part of any dental record, must be such that examination fi ndings can be transferred quickly and accurately to either paper or electronic capture. A helpful exercise is visualization of the functionality of the charting process, including both the different types of entries (caries, existing restorations and pathology) and how these are entered in the paper world. If charting will be able to be used for research the system should be able to translate pictures to numerical values, often a complex programming function. Dental practitioners and faculty may want to use drawings of teeth or graphics of surfaces because that is their current comfort level. A true digital charting is possible with no images of teeth, but some habits are hard to change. 3. Maximizing drop downs with drop down building possible . Duplication of paper chart entries using drop downs which can be upgraded as more clinical entities are found is a staple of an EMR. The paper process usually relies on a clinician's wealth of medical-dental terms since inclusion of every possible, or even the most common fi ndings, is prohibitive on a paper chart. The EMR drop down requires front-end loading of the most common clinical fi ndings with opportunity for free-hand additions. Being able to add terms to any drop down is a needed capability. 4. Don't design a system for uncommon contingencies, but for your bulk of work . A pediatric dental record should be primarily designed around dental caries, with secondary emphases on oral-facial development (orthodontics) and a lesser capability to record traumatic injuries and periodontal fi ndings. These second and third level characteristics can be hot-buttoned and should not drive the design of the basic system which is caries charting for 98% of our patients. Sadly in most dental schools, the chart is slave to every teaching form, few of which ever exit with the DDS into practice! These forms may have little relationship to patient care and only create \"signature black holes\" that need to be addressed, usually after treatment is completed. 5. Progress notes should be designed for the routine entries with free-hand modification possible . Student learners tend to write too much and a carefully crafted progress note format with standard entries in required fi elds helps patient fl ow and record completion. In federally funded clinics and residencies, attending reconciliation of student/resident service delivery is a compliance requirement. A well-designed EMR system can \"stack\" required co-signing tasks on a computer screen, offer standard entries as well as free-hand options, and create a process far faster than paper records for an attending's validation (same as reconciliation?). 6. Tie examination results to treatment planning and treatment planning into billing . A good system allows easy transfer of clinical fi ndings needing treatment into some problem \"basket\" and ideally in a tabulated format. An alternative is a split screen that allows a clinician to visualize clinical fi ndings, radiographic fi ndings while compiling a treatment plan. Again, in clinical settings where compliance to Medicaid/Medicare regulations is required, the design of the record should give attention to auditing principles and security. A good EMR system allows portals of entry for billing and compliance personnel. 7. Plan for users of different skill levels and different periods of exposure . The teaching hospital or dental school environment often involves learners and attendings with varying skill levels and computer experience who may be there for brief periods of time. This reality adds signifi cant security and userfriendliness issues. Some medical record systems are far too complex for shortterm or casual users. A well-integrated medical-dental EMR allows navigation of the depths of the medical side should a user want to explore, but should focus on the dental portion. Some suggestions in design:",

No chronic kidney disease was defi ned as an estimated GFR of 60 ml per min per 1.73 m 2 . Three percent of the patients had CKD, 22.5% were hypertension and 4.4% had diabetes (2.4% with glycated hemoglobin of 7% or higher). Four models were constructed to examine the potential relationship between periodontal disease and CKD. In model one adults with either periodontal disease or edentulous had an adjusted odds ratio of 1.83 (with 95% confi dence intervals of 1.31-2.55) of having CKD, independent of the other risk factors for CKD including of age above 60 years, ethnicity, hypertension, smoking status, female gender and C-reactive protein elevation. The fourth model contained 15 potential risk factors including the periodontal disease score and for every 1-unit increase in the score, the risk of having CKD increased by 1% controlling for the other risk factors. The authors hypothesized from their results that the relationship between periodontal disease and CKD was bidirectional in that CKD may increase the risk of periodontal disease which in turn increases the risk of CKD. Grubbs et al. ( 2011 ) also used NHANES data to look more closely at the relationship between periodontal disease and CKD, using dental examinations obtained from 2001 to 2004 (n = 6,199 adults, 21-75 years) (Grubbs V, et al. 2011 ) . In this analysis edentulous subjects were excluded and those with albuminuria were included in the defi nition of CKD. In the entire population CKD was present in 10.6%, but in those with moderate to severe periodontal disease this increased to 21.6%. Other associations with moderate to severe periodontal disease were being older, male, nonwhite, less educated and poor. There was a strong relationship between periodontal disease and CKD (2.5 unadjusted odds ratio). When adjusted for age, gender, tobacco use, hypertension, diabetes, ethnicity, poverty and educational attainment, the odds ratio for the association of periodontal disease and CKD was still signifi cant (1.55). In some groups (Mexican American, poor, and poorly educated) dental care was not received on an annual basis in the majority of this segment of the population.",

Because of the special nature of the neurovascular bundle of the head and neck this symptom can be presented to both dentists and otolaryngologists (Ram et al. 2009 ). Any sinus pathology can present as a headache to an otolaryngology practice. Since the maxillary sinus fl oor is in close proximity to the maxillary premolars and molars, it is imperative to obtain a dental evaluation in persistent cases of headache. There are a number of causes for headache from the dental and otolaryngology perspective. A mal-aligned denture patient with chronic headache, whom I saw in my practice was shuttled between departments and an array of investigations only to fi nd at the end that an ill-fi tting denture caused the intractable headache. In these cases, an integration of fi ndings is extremely important in providing quality treatment to the patient and also saves money and time for the whole health care system. Hence it is important to have an integrated patient record for this particular symptom alone.",

Another example would be the patient who suffers from the secondary health consequence of gastroesophageal refl ux disease (GERD) as a result of the neuromotor impairment associated with multiple neurodevelopmental disorders; and whose tooth enamel and dentinal tissues become chemically eroded as a result of the chronic intraoral acidity produced by GERD (See: Fig. 4.16 ) .

Indeed, it is often the case that quality primary care provided in one discipline will provide potentially valuable information to an attending clinician from another discipline. Such is the case with the patients featured in Figs. 4.16 and 4.17 .",

The infl ammatory lesion is one in which the gingival tissues are swollen and bleeding, and in which pain is often a component. This type of gingival enlargement is the more acute lesion, frequently seen in patients who are currently taking Phenytoin. In advanced cases of infl ammatory gingival enlargement, the tissues can appear botryoid, with a characteristic grape-cluster appearance. In advanced cases of Phenytoin-induced gingival enlargement, the lesion can sometimes shroud entire sections of the dentition. Phenytoin has long been a common medication used to treat seizure disorders in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders and intellectual disabilities. However, the gingival enlargement it produces, and the obstacle this lesion can pose to effective oral hygiene -especially in a population in which oral hygiene is typically compromised -can, over time, lead to periodontal disease, edentulism, and in advanced cases, systemic bacteremias. Gingivectomy performed to reduce Phenytoin-induced gingival enlargement will typically fail unless the patient is weaned off the offending medication, and another anti-seizure medication is titrated to effect. Multiple alternative anti-seizure medications are currently available, which do not have the side effect profi le of Phenytoin, and most patients who are weaned off Phenytoin will demonstrate a virtual 100% resolution of the infl ammatory lesion within a matter of 3 or 4 months.",

After the unfortunate incidents in 2001 the public health system was revisited and the realization that \"the nation's public health infrastructure is not fully prepared to meet this growing challenge\" (Frist 2002 ) became clear. To address this need, Congress and President Bush enacted the Public Law (P.L.) 107-188 titled \"Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002\" (Frist 2002 ; 107th Congress 2002 ) . The main purpose of this law was to improve the public health capacity by means of increasing funding and fostering other measures. Frist ( 2002 ) , described the law as a \"good start\" and that \"to be prepared for bioterrorism, it is imperative that we develop a cohesive and comprehensive system of ongoing surveillance and case investigations for early detection\". In this way, several early detection systems have been implemented with different levels of success among different geographic regions in the US.",

This meeting reviewed several aspects of bioterrorism and the dental profession: the nature of biological pathogens and its oral manifestations, what needed to be communicated, how dentists should participate, etc. Dr. Michael C. Alfano described the diffi culties that biological pathogens create for clinicians because \"they are so insidious.\" While discussing the anthrax mailings after September 11th he pointed out that: \"\u2026 early symptoms appeared so they resembled the aches, fever, and malaise of fl u so those affected delayed seeking treatment, a delay that has proven fatal in some cases\". Lieutenant Colonel Ross H. Pastel of the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease (USAMRIID) listed the \"Category A\" pathogens as defi ned by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and those are: smallpox, anthrax, plague, botulinum toxin, tularemia and viral hemorrhagic fever.

Dr. Michael Glick described the oral manifestations of smallpox showing \"signs 24 hours before skin rash.

Such surveillance-knowing what to look for and whom to report to-is critical and applies not only to suspected bioterrorist agents, but to a list of reportable diseases which has grown to include such entities as West Nile virus and Sever Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).\" Dr. Sigurs O. Krolls presented the response at the local level and he \"stressed the importance of communication and the need for redundant systems\", \"to keep all the parties informed\". He also posed the question \"Can dentists recognize signs and systems of contagious diseases?\", and emphasized that education can be essential. Dr. Louis DePaola made several connotations that can be key in the scope of this paper by saying \"dentists can contribute to bioterrorism surveillance by being alert to clues that might indicate a bioterrorism attack. Such surveillance would note if there is an infl ux of people seeking medical attention with non-traumatic conditions and fl ulike or possibly neurological or paralytic symptoms\u2026 or even specifi c signs of a bioterrorist agent. Patterns of school of work absence, appointment cancellations or failures to appear, could also be indicators.\" Dr. DePaola made clear that in cases of limited release of bioterrorist agents, dentists \"have little to offer\" but \"a widespread attack can certainly tap into dental professional skills in recognition, isolation and management\". In addition, Dr. Guay ( 2002 ) lists all the possible roles in which dentists can participate including \"education, risk communication, diagnosis, surveillance and notifi cation, treatment, distribution of medications, decontamination, sample collection and forensic dentistry.\"",

He also acknowledges that one of the advantages of this type of documentation is that it \"is much more transportable\". He also recognizes the need for standardized methods for collecting information from dentists. Schleyer and Eisner ( 1997 ) defi ned several scenarios where the COHR is used in a \"shared\" environment where several healthcare providers interact and information is seamless communicated, improving the decisions made by clinicians. Delrose and Steinberg ( 2000 ) discuss how the \"Digital Patient Record\" enhances clinical practice by providing \"better quality information\" to the clinician. Although all of these benefi ts sound promising and encouraging some still express concern of the lack of standards among different information systems, which translates in communication breakdowns (Schleyer 2003 ) . On the other hand, Heid and colleagues ( 2002 ) mention a list all the steps that are currently being taken by different organizations such as the ADA in order to produce a standardized COHR. Other examples of standardization can be found in a paper presented by Narcisi ( 1996 ) where ADA's participation as a voting member in the American National Standards Institute has allowed EDI or the COHR to be discussed and improved at a national level. Additional infl uences in the standardization of the COHR are the security regulations mandated by HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. Dentists are required to \"adopt practices necessary for compliance\" (Sfi kas 2003 ; Chasteen et al. 2003 ) . These and other regulations (Szekely et al. 1996 ) will encourage the homogeny among different system vendors. Computer ownership, on the other hand, has increased steadily during the last 25 years. According to Schleyer et al. ( 2003 ) in 1976 only 1% of dental professionals used computers in their practices compared to 85% in the year 2000. Additionally similar trends in Internet connectivity where described.",

An epidemiologic study later would show that the patient was present at the football stadium when an infectious agent was released (Fig. 4.25 ) . Although, at that time his medical history showed no indication of a systemic disease, the presence of multiple oral vesicles prompted the dentist to make an annotation into the COHR. The system, by using a natural language processing engine, detected such sign and sent this information to a central database. The patient was discharged and instructed to take some support medication to treat the oral ulcers. The next day, the central database pinpointed the presence of an out of the ordinary increase in the number of cases with the same signs and symptoms around that region. When the presence of this peak was detected, the central server sent a request to the dentist computer for additional information. One of the requested elements was if there was any use of medication for treating oral ulcers. Fortunately this information was available. The central database crossed this with the information of other surveillance systems together with the information from other patients that happen to have similar clinical signs and/or symptoms. Dr. X received an email from a public health offi cial asking her to communicate to the local health department to discuss information about one her patients. The case depicted above simulates the release of smallpox during a football game. In the case of smallpox oral symptoms include tongue swelling, multiple oral mucosal vesicles, ulceration, and mucosal hemorrhaging (National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research 2004 ) .

This leads to the discussion mentioned in the background section about \"individual rights\" vs. \"common good\". Although HIPAA addresses public health , some other implications may arise and the health professionals including dentists, physicians, public health offi cials and patients should discuss and address such issues.

Clinical research often occurs in the context of also providing patient care, yet the systems that are used for each are different and often cannot exchange data. The lack of data exchange between systems pose signifi cant barriers to effi ciently treating patient and conducting clinical research in dentistry. The purpose of this section is to review the benefi ts and challenges of integrating electronic health record (EHR) used for patient care and electronic data capture (EDC) which is used for clinical research such as clinical trials. An increasing number of dentists routinely use EHRs (Schleyer et al. 2006 ) . Most dental schools in North America also use EHRs. Benefi ts of using EHRs include increased legibility, portability, and improved patient safety (Buntin et al. 2011) . Recent federal incentives, although not directly benefi cial to dentists, will also likely spur the adoption of EHR (Blumenthal and Tavenner 2010 ) .",

Research is needed in defi ning an optimal workfl ow that can streamline the tasks associated with patient care and research, while at the same time providing a unifi ed information system that support these activities. Also, the data that are collected for care and research are likely to differ. A researcher may require far more granularity of an oral health measurement than a clinician seeking to provide care. In cases when conducting a double blind placebo controlled clinical trial, the investigator may not even know the type of treatment that has been delivered to the patient. Due to complexities of each domain, and large differences in goals, to date mutually exclusive workfl ows have arisen. A clinician investigator who sees a patient for both care and research, will likely need to enter data on this same patient twice; once in the EHR and once in the EDC system.",

As a result, $19.2 Billion is made available to incentivize the physicians, dentists and hospitals for the adoption of the EHR through the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act. As the nation head towards adoption of the EHRs, there has also been a growing interest with the majority of the U.S. dental schools to implement EHRs within the educational setting. Fifty of the fi fty-six U.S. dental schools, as well as dental schools in Canada and Europe, are either using or in the process of adopting some aspects of a common dental EHR framework (White et al. 2011 ) . A group of dental schools known as Consortium for Oral Health-Related Informatics (COHRI) was formed in 2007 which used this common dental EHR framework -axiUm (Stark et al. 2010 ) .",

While dramatic advances in experimental designs, statistical approaches, and clinical insights have greatly aided this scientifi c campaign, the central driver of this progress has been the development of high-throughput, inexpensive genetic technologies. Following initial molecular studies using variant forms of enzymes, or allozymes, a major breakthrough was the use of highly informative DNA-based markers throughout the genome (Botstein et al. 1980 ) . This idea of directly assaying existing DNA variation to conduct linkage and association studies in genetics began a revolution in disease gene mapping. Recent interest from commercial entities has produced a feverish pace of technological innovation, markedly reducing cost and expanding the depth of inquiry. Previously unfathomable, the testing of over one million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in thousands of patients and controls is now commonplace (Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2007 ; Schaefer et al. 2010 ) ; and very recently, next generation sequencing technologies have progressed to the point where sequencing of the entire protein-coding portion of the genome (exome) or even the entire genome is a costeffective method to examine disease traits across the entire spectrum of genetic variants in small numbers of affected individuals (Ng et al. 2010 ) . There is little doubt that soon whole genome sequencing will be applied to nuclear family-based designs, studies among distantly-related affected individuals in extended pedigrees, and case/control studies involving thousands of individuals. This unprecedented scope of inquiry made possible by large-scale genetics, has begun to yield fascinating resulting into predisposition to oral cancers, caries, and periodontal disease that will molecularly redefi ne these pathologies, explicate unique biological connections with related diseases, give impetus to the development of directed therapeutics, and indeed personalize medicine. Still, much more genetic focus on oral disease phenotypes is required if we are to realize this medical impact in a timely fashion.",

Genetic studies have much to offer investigations of disease etiology. Why do some acquire diseases and others do not? For those affected, why do some progress more rapidly than others? What causes some patients to respond to therapies, while others suffer from adverse reactions? These are all fundamental questions in both biology and medicine, whether the focus is on the gastrointestinal tract, the hippocampus, the lymphatic system, metabolic disorders, or oral diseases. Speaking generally across disease areas, a portion of the answers to these questions often lies in described environmental effects. In numerous chronic diseases, infectious agents are likely contributors to the disease process -periodontitis, for example, is initiated by gram negative anaerobes in susceptible individuals (Holt and Ebersole 2005 ) . Surely, unique and latent environmental exposures provide a random component to common disease susceptibility and progression. Through twin studies, studies of risk in close relatives, and quantitative traits experiments, it is well-understood that heritable factors, including but not limited to DNA variation, are typically responsible for 30-90% of the phenotype variability for common diseases. This section will attempt to cover, at least at a cursory level, the major salient developments affecting genetic insights into chronic and aggressive periodontitis, with some comment on genetic factors infl uencing susceptibility to caries and oral cancers. While it would be extremely na\u00efve to view genetic studies as an immediate panacea for our ills, the discovery of disease-causing genes does illuminate hitherto unknown biological pathways and molecular mechanisms, draws unforeseen connections with other traits, may improve prognostic models applicable for individuals, and suggests specifi c therapeutics.",

However, the accompanying physical inactivity coupled with a high calorie diet are probable contributors to an extremely common, chronically infl amed metabolic syndrome (Hotamisligil 2006 ) that is thought to give rise to a multitude of intimately related disease traits: insulin resistance, compromised insulin signaling, hyperglycemia, obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, impaired kidney function, elevated liver enzymes and steatohepatitis, poor wound healing, neurodegeneration, vascular disease, pregnancy complications, accelerated immunosenescence, and periodontal disease (Ford et al. 2002 ; Ferrannini et al. 1991 ; Eaton et al. 1994 ; Holvoet et al. 2008 ; Speliotes et al. 2010 ; Eckel et al. 2005 ; D'Aiuto et al. 2008 ) .

These features constitute a disruption in a fundamental homeostatic mechanism with intensifying pathogenic consequences.

            "text": "It is becoming increasing clear that many chronic diseases have an infectious component. There is relatively convincing evidence that many systemic, T-cell mediated autoimmune disorders may be initiated by infections. For example, from archaeological data, it is believed that an infectious agent -currently unknown -is necessary for rheumatoid arthritis (Firestein 2003 ) , and both Guillain-Barre syndrome and rheumatic fever have well-described pathogeneses triggered by specifi c infections in susceptible individuals (Bach 2005 ) . In many instances, oncogenesis and tumor progression can be traced to pro-infl ammatory responses at the site of chronic infection (Coussens and Werb 2002 ) , although it is not known whether these effects are mediated through the actions of the immune system, the infectious agents, or a combination thereof. Several cancers fall into this category including gastric adenocarcinoma (Uemura et al. 2001 ) , cervical cancer (Walboomers et al. 1999 ) , hepatocellular carcinoma (Saito et al. 1990 ) , and Kaposi's sarcoma (Dictor 1997 ) , all having unequivocal infectious agent etiologies. Recent fi ndings of antiinfl ammatory pharmaceuticals, particularly those that inhibit COX-1 and COX-2, reduce the incidence of certain classes of cancers are consistent with this view (Dannenberg and Subbaramaiah 2003 , Rothwell Rothwell et al. 2010 ) . In addition, there is moderate evidence that several bacteria -the most studied is Chlamydia pneumoniae -play a role in atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction (Saikku et al. 1988 ; Watson and Alp 2008 ) , however the studies are not conclusive and antibiotic treatment does not appear to be effective (Andraws et al. 2005 ) .",

Aside from the known oral pathogenic species P. gingivalis , T. denticola , and T. forsythensis , the so-called \"red complex\" (Holt and Ebersole 2005 ) , new bacterial species associated with chronic periodontitis have also been described (Kumar et al. 2003 ) .

Compelling meta-analyses demonstrate a highly signifi cant synchronicity of obesity and periodontal disease (Chaffee and Weston 2010 ) . In addition, the correlation between periodontal diseases/ alveolar bone loss and frank metabolic syndrome is repetitively observed (Nesbitt et al. 2010 ; Andriankaja et al. 2010 ) . Extensive work has also shown a strong role for both infl ammation-related genes and circulating infl ammatory markers in periodontal disease (Nikolopoulos et al. 2008 ; Bretz et al. 2005a, b ) . Treatment studies further support the link between periodontal disease and immuno-metabolic syndrome. These experiments have demonstrated a signifi cant improvement in intermediate molecular markers of infl ammation when chronic periodontitis in the presence of metabolic syndrome (Acharya et al. 2010 ) or type 2 diabetes (Iwamoto et al. 2001 ) was treated. Conversely, treatment of periodontal disease with reduction of bacterial load leads to greater glycemic control among diabetic patients (Simpson et al. 2010 ; Stewart et al. 2001 ) . Given the high prevalence of periodontitis and the co-morbidity of metabolic syndrome with periodontal disease, these treatment experiments appear to suggest that the virulent oral microbiome could play an important role in the pathogenesis of systemic infl ammatory metabolic syndrome, and is exacerbated by the syndrome. Certainly, further studies are needed to defi nitively answer this question.",

Mutations in the lysosomal protease, cathepsin C, have been shown to be responsible for some forms of aggressive periodontitis, along with complications associated with other infl ammatory diseases (Laine and Busch-Petersen 2010 ) . The specifi c HLA variants thought to play a role in aggressive periodontitis, are also involved in infectious disease susceptibility and autoimmunity; and, interestingly, two of the non-MHC-linked regions, FAM5C and a locus on chromosome 9p21, have been implicated in myocardial infarction (Connelly et al. 2008 ) and may have action as a tumor suppressor in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (Kuroiwa et al. 2009 ) . As with chronic periodontal disease, an infectious microbiome is heavily involved. However, in general, microbiome differences could not explain the presence of chronic versus aggressive forms of the disease, although in some aggressive periodontitis patients, a highly leukotoxic A. actinomycetemcomitans strain may contribute to the disease process (Mombelli et al. 2002 ) . We currently do not fully know the differences between the genetic susceptibility factors for the chronic and aggressive forms of the disease.",

Caries formation is a complex disease with several interacting components form the environment and host genetics. Similar to gingivitis and periodontitis, caries have an infection-initiating etiology with acidifi cation leading to localized demineralization. Epidemiological studies have long shown that diet is a strong predictor of caries formation; and the reduction in pH is exacerbated by high consumption of carbohydrates. The principal pathobacterial species are Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus ( van Houte 1994 ) . There are also several reports of positive correlations of caries with infl ammatory diseases, although the association is not always repeatable. It is also not clear what proportion of the putative association with infl ammatory disease is due to innate upregulation of immune networks in contrast to the immuno-modulating pharmaceuticals prescribed to those with infl ammatory disease (Steinbacher and Glick 2001 ) . Much of the effect is reported to result from lack of saliva volume (Steinbacher and Glick 2001 ) . Interestingly, the presence of epilepsy may be associated with higher caries rates (Anjomshoaa et al. 2009 ) . Fluoride is an effective antimicrobial agent that interferes with bacterial growth and metabolism (Wiegand et al. 2007 ) . Hence, topical fl uoride administration as well as ingestion of fl uoridated water inhibits cariogenesis and caries progression (Ripa 1993 ) . Amelogenesis is a key process involved in modifying the rate of caries formation. Both common variation and rare mutations in enamel formation genes such as amelogenin and enamelin are involved in caries rates (Patir et al. 2008 ; Kim et al. 2004 ; Crawford et al. 2007 ) , the molecular actions of which are beginning to be revealed (Lakshminarayanan et al. 2010 ) .",

Again, oral cancers have a complex etiology existing of entangled genetic, epigenetic, infectious, and dietary causes, further modifi ed by tobacco, alcohol and other environmental exposures. As with most cancers, it is reasonable to expect that both germline and somatic genetic changes will be involved in carcinogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis. Promoter hypermethylation of genes central to cellular growth, differentiation, DNA fi delity, apoptosis, and metabolic stability is an important facet of these cancers (Poage et al. 2010 ) . Indeed, methylation-mediated silencing of genes involved in tumor suppression (e.g. the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A), detoxifi cation (e.g. MGMT ), and apoptosis (e.g. the death-associated protein kinase-1) are commonly found in oral squamous cell carcinoma samples (Ha and Califano 2006 ) .",

Researchers subsequently developed several methods for estimating heritabilities using the measure of a trait (e.g. occurrence of disease/not-disease) in combinations of relatives (e.g. parentoffspring, or monozygotic-dizygotic twins). In general, the higher the measured heritability of a variable phenotype, the larger the contribution of genetic factors is in comparison to environmental effects. It is fallacious to assume that the heritable variation is composed entirely of alleles residing in the DNA sequence, for heritability studies simply examine the covariance between relatives without comment on specifi c molecular mechanisms. Hence, any heritable variation such as methylation patterns, vertically-transmitted infectious agents, as well as DNA variation can contribute to the heritability measure. Heritability results are important because they not only give a rough estimate of the collective effects of heritable factors, but also can provide a measure to quantify how much of the total genetic effect is accounted for by specifi c loci examined.",

Although varying in sample size and methodological details, all four arrived at consistent results, with 30-50% of the variance in periodontal disease being attributed to genetic variability for chronic periodontitis. Given the segregation patterns described in the literature, it is reasonable to assume that aggressive periodontal disease exhibits a higher heritability. Therefore, given the prevalence of periodontal disease, heritable factors within the population at large are likely appreciable. Using 314 twin pairs, Bretz and colleagues reported substantial heritability values for multiple traits related to caries ranging from 30% to 56% (Bretz et al. 2005a, b ) . Lastly, mutagen sensitivity studies of head and neck cancer patients suggest a signifi cant effect of genetic factors for the carcinogenesis of oral cancers (Cloos et al. 1996 ) .

Genotyping of short, tandem repeated sequences (Weber and May 1989 ) -microsatellites -spurred on a wave of genome-wide linkage studies, which evaluate the co-segregation of disease state with microsatellite markers, for both rare Mendelian disorders as well as more common diseases with complex inheritance patterns. While the rarer traits with more coherent transmission patterns generally relinquished their genetic secrets to linkage analysis, more common diseases did not. In the mid-to late 1990s, several theoretical studies had shown that the power to detect disease-causing alleles is higher with association-based designs such as a case/control experiment or association in the presence of a linkage signal as in the transmission/disequilibrium test if the frequency of those alleles is high and the effects are moderate (Kaplan et al. 1995 ; Risch and Merikangas 1996 ; Jones 1998 ; Long and Langley 1999 ) . However, to conduct genomewide association studies presented an ominous obstacle for the genetic technologies at the time. The number of markers required to effectively cover the genome was prohibitively large as the chromosomal blocks in population-based samples used in association designs were expected to be small. Even within large extended families, the limited number of recombination events generates substantial chromosomal blocks passed through the pedigree, but researchers had both theoretical and empirical evidence that the blocks in population-based samples were on the order of 50 K base pairs for most large human populations. As the reader can imagine, the mean length of blocks that are shared by descent is inversely related to the product of recombination rate, the number of affected individuals and the number of meioses separating the affected individuals. In practice, even very large extended families segregate regions shared by affected members on the order of several million base pairs in length. However, once geneticists seriously considered large-scale studies using a case/control design where individuals are separated by say 5,000 meioses, it became clear that to adequately cover the much smaller shared regions across the entire genome, hundreds of thousands of markers would be required (Kruglyak 1999 ) . Utilizing the human genome sequence (Venter et al. 2001 ; Lander et al. 2001 ) , a number of studies at Celera Diagnostics provided an intermediate solution, where approximately 30,000 putative functional SNPs primarily located in genes were assayed through allelespecifi c PCR in a number of common diseases using a staged case/control design. These studies were successful in identifying several gene-centric polymorphisms associated with common diseases (Begovich et al. 2004 ; Cargill et al. 2007 ) (Fig. 4.35 ) .",

Multiple rare sequence variants generating high levels of allelic heterogeneity, functional de novo mutations, structural mutations such as copy number variants and large deletions, and epigenetic effects constitute four of several possible disease models that could account for the heritability discrepancy. The answer will almost certainly consist of a conglomeration of these and other effects.

This is particularly true for expanding populations. Are these rare variants the source of much of the missing heritability? Recently, with the application of high-throughput sequencing technology to human studies over the past decade, empirical studies have clearly verifi ed these predictions -the large majority of variants have low frequencies (The International HapMap 3 Consortium 2010 ) . The distribution of deletions appears to be skewed toward more rare frequencies, presumably due to the deleterious effects of such variants. Individual mutations appearing de novo typically are extremely rare events per locus, but collectively are numerous. Other types of genetic variability, such as copy number repeats, span both ends of the frequency spectrum with the preponderance of the markers being rare.

Structural variants can exist in a multitude of forms including deletions, copy number variants, and inversions among others. Due to the nature of these genetic changes, many are considered to be highly disruptive of molecular function if they lie in functional motifs. Indeed, there are several Mendelian diseases are caused by fully-penetrant structural variants impacting a chromosomal region (Lupski 2007 ) . Numerous structural variants have recently been reported to be associated with common diseases, particularly in the neurological fi eld (Sebat et al. 2007 ; Stefansson et al. 2008 ; Elia et al. 2010 ) , infectious disease susceptibility (Gonzalez et al. 2005 ) , and drug metabolism (Zackrisson et al. 2010 ) . Although they have improved dramatically over the past few years, algorithms using SNP-based data from hybridization arrays to infer copy number variants have had high error rates, perhaps explaining the rather low rates of replication of structural variation association results for common diseases. Nevertheless, given the high frequency of structural variants, their pathogenic potential, and that we are on the precipice of a sequencing revolution in genome-wide studies, examination of these variants should be a high priority for new sequencing-based studies in oral disease susceptibility, progression, and related pharmacogenetic applications.",

As discussed above, sequencing technologies may address many aspects of DNA variation including copy number loci, rare haplotypes, inversions, and insertions/deletions, but it is also worthwhile to repeat that the molecular mechanisms for disease heritability are not necessarily limited to variation at the DNA level. For a disease state, the covariance between relatives could be driven by co-inherited chromosomal regions or other phenomena. Chief alternative heritable mechanisms include DNA methylation (Hammoud et al. 2009 ) , modifi cations to the histones (Bestor 2000 ) , complex RNA zygotic transfer (Rassoulzadegan et al. 2006 ) , and vertical transmission of infectious agents. Additionally, transgenerational effects offer an intriguing class of epigenetic mechanisms (Nadeau 2009 ) . In a thorough review on epigenetics and periodontitis, Gomez et al. make a strong argument for consideration of both CpG dinucleotide methylation and deacetylation actions on cytokine expression as a credible avenue for further investigation in periodontal disease etiology (Gomez et al. 2009 ) . Genome-wide epigenetic studies have been successfully conducted for oral cancers (Poage et al. 2010 ) . The scale of this study on head and neck squamous cell carcinomas allowed these researchers to show a global pattern of tumor copy number changes signifi cantly correlated with methylation profi les that was not detectable at the individual gene promoter level. With advanced chromatin immunoprecipitation and new methods to study DNA methylation, efforts to apply highthroughput epigenetic methods to oral diseases should be accelerated.",

There are two large reviews of the existing candidate gene results (Nikolopoulos et al. 2008 ; ) . Laine and colleagues have recently put together a comprehensive review article covering gene polymorphisms. There are some suggestive fi ndings for cyclooxygenase-2 gene, COX-2 , the cytokineencoding genes, IL6 and IL1B , the vitamin D receptor, VDR , a polymorphism immediately upstream of CD14 , and the matrix metalloproteinase-1 gene, MMP1 . However, these initial results will require further confi rmation, for the association patterns are inconsistent across independent studies, the statistical signifi cance is moderate, and the posterior probability of disease is decidedly bland. The striking pattern that emerges from the Laine et al. summary data is the lack of coherent replication of genetic association for the vast majority of polymorphisms examined. The situation is reminiscent of genetic association studies prior to large-scale SNP studies where poor repeatability of results plagued the fi eld. In a pivotal study from 2002, Hirschhorn and colleagues (Hirschhorn et al. 2002 ) examined the state of genetic association studies, fi nding that \"of the 166 putative associations that had been studied three or more times, only six have been consistently replicated.\" The dearth of robust results was largely remedied when large-scale genetic studies were applied to very substantial numbers of well-characterized patients and geneticallymatched controls and stringent statistical criteria enforced. One can only suspect that a similar state of affairs is operating in genetic studies of chronic periodontitis. Perhaps efforts to (1) reduce the heterogeneity of the disease state through detailed clinical and laboratory assessments, (2) drastically increase sample sizes, and (3) expand the scope of inquiry to larger numbers of genes/regions, and examine a more comprehensive set of variants/epigenetic effects will improve the current situation.",

Often, seemingly signifi cant results from large studies are due to the effect of reporting the top result from a great many statistical tests -this is called the multiple testing problem. In this situation, the strength of the fi nding, along with the replication across three case/control studies, argues for true association with aggressive periodontal susceptibility. The SNP may modulate the binding affi nity of GATA-3. The association with GLT6D1 is currently one of strongest genetic associations for aggressive periodontal disease, testifying to the power of genome-wide studies to generate novel, relevant molecular pathophysiology for complex diseases. It seems unlikely that GLT6D1 would be extremely high on a candidate gene list, and it was only through a genome-wide scan that it appeared.

Scientifi c progress in revealing the molecular pathogenesis of oral diseases is dependent on genome-wide genetic studies; and I have argued that progress in related immuno-metabolic diseases is also dependent on these large-scale genetic studies in periodontal disease. To study sporadic disease, substantial patient collection efforts are required for the application of these technologies. This may involve a combination of new recruitment and consortiumrelationships with existing collections. The beginning of such a collection for sporadic aggressive periodontitis in Europe has shown extremely intriguing initial results, but more patients are needed to examine rare variants of moderate effect. Both the German/Dutch collection of aggressive periodontitis and the Brazilian collection have begun to revolutionize the study of periodontal disease susceptibility with the discovery of GLT6D1 SNPs and FAM5C -linked haplotypes. There is little doubt that subsequent molecular work on these two genes will uncover novel mechanisms for the predisposition to aggressive periodontal disease. Focus should also be placed on the collection of extended families segregating these diseases. Applying sequencing technologies to large pedigrees can be an effective method of identifying rare variants and structural variants in a highly-refi ned phenotype. Furthermore, applying these methods to the entire genome would make for a comprehensive genetic study.",

            "text": "The sociology of biological sciences has changed over the past 15 years so as to \u2022 become more collaborative. Essential for association-based designs, consortiumbased genetic research has blossomed over that time period, increasing sample sizes and therefore the power to detect disease-causing variants. There currently is consortium-based research in periodontal disease and oral cancer. Further expanding these efforts will enhance subsequent studies, particularly those investigating rare alleles and/or rare epigenetic effects. Through over a century of laboratory work, the collective knowledge of bio-\u2022 chemical pathways, signal transduction, cell physiology, regulatory mechanisms, and structural biochemistry is weighty. Incorporation of this information into etiological models may substantially advance oral disease work as well as the fi eld of complex disease genetics in general. Sophisticated analysis techniques are needed to perform this task. Recent advances merging results from network science with probability theory within the context of computer science have produced the fi eld of machine learning. This rigorous framework can be used to identify those factors responsible for disease status and can also be used to develop robust predictive models using known biological networks and genetic data. The output from such models, typically the probability of disease, an estimate of disease progression rate, or a probability of adverse reaction, can be used by physicians and dentists to personalize medical care. Until relatively recently, population genetics did not contribute a great deal to \u2022 human genetics research. That has changed in the past decade where effort spent on association studies surpassed that spent on family-based studies. Those investigating disease gene mapping began to collaborate with population geneticists and population geneticists took up a wide-spread interest in fi nding disease alleles. Incorporation of population genetics theory into such studies markedly improved association studies on several levels: confounding by population stratifi cation was effectively treated using population genetics, linkage disequilibrium patterns. Use of population genetics theory in large-scale oral disease mapping studies may accelerate discoveries. Sequencing technology has rapidly progressed over the past decade. Currently, \u2022 sequencing studies across the exome can be accomplished at reasonable cost and yield data for all known genes in the genome. Within the next few years, sequencing costs will depreciate to a point where whole-genome sequencing studies will be commonplace, using both family-based and population designs. Application of these technologies to oral disease studies is imperative for comprehensive studies of etiology. High-throughput DNA methylation and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies \u2022 will enable large-scale epigenetic studies in oral diseases (Meade et al. 2006 ; Ehrich et al. 2005 ; Bibikova et al. 2006 ; Ren et al. 2000 ; Pokholok et al. 2005 ) . These have already started to play an important role in delineating mechanisms responsible for oral cancers (Poage et al. 2010 ) . Additional application of these techniques to studies of gingivitis, caries, and periodontal diseases may generate novel fi ndings.",

These crossroads are described in the fi rst third of the section.

The ADA reported \"multidisciplinary education must become the norm and represent the meaning and purposes of primary care as it applies to dentistry. Educational sequences should include rotation strategies across discipline specialties in medicine and dentistry, clerkships and hospital rotations, and experience in faculty and residency clinics.\" (Barnett and Brown 2000 ) The models alluded to, were school-based attempts at improving educational outcomes. Perhaps the proverbial fork in the road regarding the future of dental education leaves two paths for consideration. Is it better to travel down a road that leads a school to develop and operate a clinic? Or is the road less traveled, where a clinic becomes a school, the better of the two options? The answer, perhaps, is that a combination of both will accomplish the desired outcome. For example, didactic knowledge is measured by examination whereas competency as a practitioner is measured by clinical demonstration. At a minimum, the result must achieve learner competency, quality, and sustainability. However, the road less traveled has not been taken yet. William Gies, in his revered report written 85 years ago on the state of American dental education, wrote \"Dental faculties should show the need\u2026. for integrated instruction in the general principles of clinical dentistry and in its correlations with clinical medicine\" (Gies 1926 ) . Basic sciences aside, could a clinicalbased educational training center have an advantage over a school-based clinical center? Soon-to-be-implemented new Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) standards will require schools to demonstrate competency in patient-centered care (Valachovic 2010 ) . Might an enterprise profi cient at running a successful clinical business model have an advantage running a professional, patient-centered clinical training program as compared to a pedagogical business model attempting to run a clinical training model? These questions should challenge us to reexamine why our thinking about educational models should be limited to schools being the starting point for the development of a profession that demands clinical competency, patientcenteredness, and integration as outcomes. The clinic based model may serve as an equivalent starting point and, have some distinct advantages for achieving responsiveness to recommendations and directions cited in this section.",

FHC-Marshfi eld is a Federally Qualifi ed Health Center (FQHC). As an FQHC, FHC receives cost-based reimbursement for its dental services to Medicaid populations. Along with the cost-based reimbursement, FQHCs are obligated to provide care to anyone regardless of their ability to pay. Presently, FHC is the nation's largest federally qualifi ed dental health center. To date, this network of dental clinics has served over 58,000 unique patients, 85% of whom were under 200% of poverty. Notably, service was provided to a signifi cant number of cognitively and developmentally disabled patients in special stations developed for serving patients with special needs. These patients frequently travel the furthest to get to our dental centers for care. Beginning in 2008, FHC stepped up the pace of dental clinic expansion, constructing two new dental centers in 2009, two in 2010, and two more are slated to open in 2011. When fully operational, this will establish capacity to serve 66,000 patients annually. Each site has proactively included dedicated clinical and classroom training space for dental residents or students, thus laying the framework for clinic-based training of new dental professionals. The plan is to continue to stand up new dental centers until they have the capacity to serve 158,000 patients annually or approximately 50% of the 300,000 underserved patients in the rural service area. In addition to the capacity for training residents and students, a dental post-baccalaureate program is being considered in partnership with regional 4 year under graduate campuses. The post-baccalaureate program is aimed at preparing students from rural and underserved areas who desire to practice in rural and underserved areas for acceptance and success in dental schools.",

By establishing clinical campuses in regional underserved dental health professional shortage areas, access to care where care is needed most was provided. Sustainment of a work force for provision of care across the dental clinic network is accomplished by schools contracting with FQHC's for service learning, thus circumventing challenges associated with releasing dental students at traditional dental schools to distant extramural training sites as discussed previously. This model is however not without its own set of challenges including calibration of faculty, supervision and evaluation of students in training, and achieving accreditation acceptance. However, through video connectivity and iEHR technology curriculum, learning plans, competency assessment, progression, performance, faculty development, and learner evaluations can be centrally calibrated.

To function competently in this role, the graduate needs to have a strong academic linkage to primary care medicine. At a 2010 dental deans forum, 84 years after the Gies report, Dr Polverini made the statement \"Dentistry has never been linked to the medical network but unless dentistry becomes part of the solution to the challenge of providing comprehensive patient care, it will be looked on as part of the problem, and ultimately, all dental schools will be called into question.\" (Polverini 2010 ) The use of dental informatics and an integrated record are elements essential to this competency. On April 1, 2010, FHC and Marshfi eld Clinic successfully transitioned all of their dental centers to a new practice management and electronic health record system that fully integrates medical and dental; one of the fi rst such systems in the nation. Along with the benefi ts derived in Fig. 4 .39 , CHC placement also exposes students to an integrated medical-dental care setting where learners can develop skills in system-based practice to include the interdependence of health professionals, systems, and the coordination of care. On the administrative side, dental and medical appointments can be coordinated to enhance convenience for patients and improve compliance with preventive dental visits. In 2009, Marshfi eld Clinic's Research Foundation Biomedical Informatics Research Center hired their fi rst Dental Informatician, Dr. Amit Acharya, BDS, MS, PhD. With dedicated biomedical informatics and research resource centers, the Marshfi eld Clinic has laid the groundwork for true medical/dental integration with appropriate electronic health record decision support and is positioned to develop a dental education curriculum capable of implementing the IOM recommendations. Downstream benefi ts of using such a curriculum are the ability of future practitioners to use informatics to improve quality of care and reduce the burden of disease.",

The following examples show how integration of dental and medical care can impact patient outcomes, underlining the importance of this concept in dental curriculum design.",

Another example is found in the context of preterm delivery and miscarriage.

Care is facilitated by registries, information technology, health information exchange and other means to assure that patients receive defi ned, timely and appropriate care while remaining cognizant of cultural, linguistic and literacy needs of the patient being served. The model includes the opportunity to deliver patient care that is patient-centric, incorporates the patient in the care planning, considers the patient's beliefs and views, and incorporates the patient's families as needed. The model allows providers to deliver care that is inclusive of needs, attentive, and accessible. The model equips payers to purchase high quality and coordinated care among teams of providers across healthcare settings.

Commenting on the inadequate training relative to the integration of medical and dental education, Baum ( 2007 ) stated that \"we need to design new curricula with meaningful core competencies for the next generation of dentists rather than apply patches to our existing ones.\" While this statement was made in reference to the basic sciences, the same holds true for patient-centered system-based practice competencies. Utilizing state-of-the-art electronic medical records as a tool and the FHC infrastructure as the service venue, meaningful patient-centered system-based practice core competencies achievement becomes possible in a manner highly responsive to societal needs. By defi nition, FQHCs must provide primary medical care, dental care, and behavioral health. FQHC have also historically been utilized as healthcare workforce training centers and the Affordable Care Act of 2010 reinforced their role as healthcare training centers. Specifi cally, this legislation serves to promote FQHCs as the entity through which the primary care workforce (including dental) will be developed and expanded. In combination, FQHCs and primary care centers are positioned to be the front runners in a medical/-dental home training model which will be essential to preparing future practitioners for practice in an ACO. Critical to this success is the ability to train these practitioners on an integrated medical-dental record and informatics platform. Use of this platform imprints most strongly during the learner's formative years of training; instructing and guiding disease management, decision making, patient care coordination, prevention, and both outcome-based and comprehensive care. Training in this hybrid academically orientated clinically integrated setting moves dental education off its crossroads and creates the highway to its future.",

            "text": "Concerns with the new models extend to their ability to integrate medical and dental disciplines at the clinical and informatics level. While the 1995 IOM report identifi ed the need to integrate medical and dental curriculum, success at the curricular and technological level within schools, has been limited. Three major factors have contributed to the limited progress: Access priorities. Creating access to care has outranked the need to integrate \u2022 care. In part, this refl ects societal need for care and public demand to reduce the burden of the \"silent epidemic.\" Schools play an important role as a safety net to care for the uninsured and underinsured through intramural clinical service learning. Even though \"dental colleges seem to be willing to bearing a large and disproportionate share of the burden in terms of access to care\" (Dunning et al. 2009 ) , schools were challenged as part of IOM, Surgeon General, and Macy reports, to expand that role. While these reports have prompted creative educational solutions to increase access, the reports understate the tremendous opportunity, quality and cost benefi ts that could result from an integration of medicine and dentistry. It is diffi cult to change the culture and structure of existing schools. This is not \u2022 unique to dentistry. However, the 1995 IOM report specifi cally recommended that schools \"eliminate marginally useful and redundant courses and design an integrated basic and clinical science curriculum\". The challenges with this are many. Examples include: Some schools may not have other disciplines to draw from to create an inte-grated curriculum; A number of schools use a faculty senate to determine curriculum. This can result in curriculum that preserves the current faculty structure; Changing curriculum is associated with expense and can be fi nancially pro-hibitive to some schools Physical changes may be needed and represent an expense and/or may, in some instances, may not be practicable based on structure of existing facilities. Public school programs may direct the fi nal curriculum, as boards or regent's one or two steps removed from the curriculum often have fi nal authority conversely, private schools may specify business or mission objectives that determine fi nal design. Perhaps most germane to this text is the lack of a common technology plat-\u2022 form between disciplines in a learning environment. An integrated curriculum requires an integrated platform to accomplish delivery and evaluation. This is particularly essential to clinical management of the patient by professionals in training as part of a healthcare delivery team. Some progress in establishing shared basic sciences curricula has been documented in the literature. To date, no single integrated electronic health (medical-dental) record has been meaningfully adapted for educational purposes, including incorporation of assessment of the learner relative to integrated competencies, integrated case-based and problem-based curriculum, and integrated evaluation and assessment.",

Moreover, CHC's must be more involved in a training curriculum integrated with informatics. CHCs, in turn, benefi t from residents and students through service-learning to help meet a societal and workforce need, while the learners benefi t from increased competency. In order to train an evidence-based, patient-centered, medical-dental workforce, it is imperative that medical and dental data and record accessibility be incorporated into these training and care delivery initiatives.
