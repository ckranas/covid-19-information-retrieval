            "text": "Aging-related processes such as cellular senescence are believed to underlie the accumulation of diseases in time, causing (co-)morbidity, including cancer, thromboembolism and stroke. Intervening into these processes may delay, stop or reverse morbidity. To study the link between (co-)morbidity and aging, by exploring biomarkers and molecular mechanisms of diseasetriggered deterioration, we will recruit 50 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, 50 patients with (thromboembolic) ischemic stroke and 50 controls, at Rostock University Medical Center. Methods and Analysis: We will gather routine blood data, clinical performance measurements and patient-reported outcomes at up to 9 points in time, and in-depth transcriptomics & proteomics at two early time points. Aiming for clinically relevant biomarkers, the primary outcome is a composite of probable sarcopenia, clinical performance (described by ECOG Performance Status for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and the Modified Rankin Scale for patients with stroke) and quality of life. Further outcomes cover other aspects of morbidity such as cognitive decline, and of comorbidity such as vascular or cancerous events. The data analysis is comprehensive in that it includes biostatistics & machine learning, both following standard role models & additional explorative approaches. Predictive biomarkers for interventions addressing senescence may become available if the biomarkers that we find are predominantly related to aging / cellular senescence. Similarly, diagnostic biomarkers will be explored for their relationship to aging / cellular senescence. Our findings will require validation in independent studies, and our dataset shall be useful to validate the findings of other studies. In some of the explorative analyses, we shall include insights from systems biology modeling as well as insights from preclinical animal models. We humbly suggest that our detailed study protocol and data analysis plan may also guide other biomarker exploration trials. Ethics and Dissemination: The study was approved by the local ethics committee, registered at the German Clinical Trials Register, and results will be published following standard guidelines.",

Other proteins involved in cellular senescence, specifically inflammatory cytokines such as IL6, and the lesser known osteopontin and gelsolin, are also markers for both PDAC and stroke [57] [58] [59] [60] . The cyclin-dependent kinase CDK5 61 is implicated in the progression of PDAC as well as in the recovery from stroke 55 62 . Moreover, apart from being genetic risk factors 63 64 , the most prominent drivers of cellular senescence (p16/CDKN2A and p21/CDKN1A) also promote PDAC progression 65 and endothelial embolic and arteriosclerotic mechanisms of stroke 66 . Finally, two smallmolecule interventions into cellular senescence, fisetin and quercetin, are both potential treatments of both PDAC and stroke. In case of stroke, the blood-brain-barrier is passed by quercetin which improves stroke outcome 67 . In case of PDAC it was observed that quercetin inhibits pancreatic cancer growth in-vitro and in-vivo 68 . Fisetin is found in various fruits (especially strawberries) and it is chemically similar to quercetin, with strong putative senolytic effects, extending lifespan of mice even when intervention with fisetin started only at an advanced age 69 . In a study involving nude mice implanted with prostate cancer cells, treatment with fisetin significantly retarded tumor growth 70 . Also, in case of lung cancer, there is evidence for the beneficial effects of fisetin. One study showed that fisetin provides protection against benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P]-induced lung carcinogenesis in albino mice 71 and another in vivo study demonstrated the synergistic effects of fisetin and cyclophosphamide in reducing the growth of lung carcinoma in mice 72 . Several other studies have also demonstrated its anticarcinogenic, neurotrophic and anti-inflammatory effects that are beneficial in numerous diseases, including pancreatic cancer and stroke 73 .",

For controls, the experimental blood analysis will be carried out at month 0 and at month 12, assuming that for these, data do not change much in the 3 months after baseline. The justification for taking the better state in case of stroke is the maximization of differences with the 12 months follow-up data. In terms of practicality (being able to calculate a biomarker signature sooner), however, the state at month 0 should be selected for all stroke patients. Since the blood sample will be taken pre-processed and frozen at month 0 in all cases, we are in principle able to perform the experimental blood analysis for all stroke patients at month 0, and we can do this analysis in retrospect if deemed necessary. We also take blood of PDAC patients at month 12, to have the option to do an experimental blood analysis if deemed useful. In the following we will refer to the baseline time-point (month 0, or month 3 in cases of stroke patients that improved) and the landmark time-point (month 3 for PDAC patients and month 12 for stroke patients and controls).

We intend to measure gelsolin and osteopontin as well, provided that sufficiently standardized assays become available in due time; the blood collected for this measurement shall otherwise be used to measure cytokines/chemokines such as IL6, IL8 and TNF\u0251, which are part of the SASP, by ELISA assays. At time of writing, we do not yet have reliable estimates on the amount of blood cells still available for measuring protein expression, so an antibody-based protein array (in case of low amounts), or mass spectrometry (in case of sufficiently high amounts) will be used alternatively. For the blood serum, we intend to use the same protein measurement method. In the default case of a protein array, we plan to use the novel but dedicated \"Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) Antibody Sampler Kit\" (consisting of approx. 10 SASP-related proteins being measured; Cell Signaling Technology) for both cellular and serum proteomics.

As described above, for patients with IS who have improved their condition (measured by NIHSS) within the first 3 months, this time point (month 3) will be used as a baseline instead. Item (a) is the deterioration from \"no sarcopenia\" to \"probable sarcopenia\" as defined by current consensus 1 . Grip strength has been widely used for assessing muscle strength, which is currently used as the most reliable measure of muscle function, loss of which indicating sarcopenia 1 . ECOG PS is established in describing the general condition of patients with cancer, whereas mRS is established in patients with stroke. Death is reflected by both scores as ECOG PS of 5 or mRS of 6, and it will always consider death from any cause. The EQ-5D-5L evaluates QoL in five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), all relevant for patients with PDAC and IS. Furthermore, it is a generic score so that results will be comparable for different diseases (as recently described in patients with stroke 88 ) and for the general population 89 ). Even though disease-specific scores might evaluate symptom burden in even more detail, the EQ-5D-5L was recently shown to be comparable to QoL scores developed specifically for pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis (that is, PEmb-QoL, VEINES-QOL/Sym and PACT-Q2) in terms of acceptability, validity and responsiveness 90 . A clinical deterioration in EQ-5D-5L is described as a minimal important difference in the range from 0.07 to 0.09 index points and in VAS from 7 to 10 91 which is the basis for the definition of item (c). Controls reach their endpoint by the same definition as the subcohort for which they serve as control; in any integrative analysis of both subtrials, a deterioration of the mRS by at least one point will be used as the criterion (instead of ECOG PS), because stroke patients in general have a slower deterioration than PDAC patients, and controls naturally have the slowest expected deterioration.",

Our feature integration approach (see above) is also known as a \"late integration\" type of analysis, implying that measurements for different omics data types are reduced early on to activation scores for pathways or subnetworks that are then integrated at a \"late\" level. To calculate the activation scores for subnetworks, we use, by default, the ExprEssence/FocusHeuristics linkscore 96 97 , taking the links (gene/protein interactions) from a functional interaction network defaulting to STRING. Our experience with the linkscore motivates us to include this method as one of the approaches proposed for feature integration in the following, influencing the calculation of up to 10 features on which the standard biostatistics and machine learning shall be based. Specifically, we take the average expression measurement for all patients (as a list of expression values, one per gene) and the average for all controls (as a list of expression values, one per gene) to calculate a linkscore for each STRING interaction, and assemble a \"condensed\" network including all interactions with a linkscore in that percentile for which the 50 highest-scoring interactions are shown. These interactions form subnetworks. We then take the average linkscore for each subnetwork as the subnetwork activation score. Alternative methods such as keypathwayminer will be used in the exploratory analyses, see below. For the pathways (such as KEGG), we will calculate pathway activation scores using Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) 98 . This method calculates pathway activation scores from expression data, is suited for use with microarray as well as RNAseq data and performed strongly in a recent benchmarking analysis 99 . The GSVA-based pathway activation scores can subsequently be compared between patients and controls in the same way as normal gene expression data, calculating, for each pathway, a fold-change of the pathway activation scores between patients and controls. Here, we average over all patients and over all controls, respectively, using the limma R package and adjusting for age and gender of the individual patient/control pathway activation. An example of this approach is given in the GSVA publication, where differential pathway activation was identified between acute lymphoblastic lymphoma and mixed-lineage lymphoma 98 . The major downside of feature integration may be information loss; subsequent statistical and machine-learning-based analyses receive only a tiny fraction of the amount of information that is available in total. Gene expression data (transcriptomics) will be our preferred omics data type. Nevertheless, proteins are closer to the phenotype than transcripts, so we wish to not ignore these. Therefore, we prepare to deal with both kinds of proteome data that we may expect (see \"Experimental blood analyses\", above), as follows.",

However, to our knowledge, none of these features are validated clinical biomarkers, and it is quite possible that a combination of simple biomarkers is key to the best possible prediction.

Data analysis for biomarker discovery trials in a clinical setting is usually described with a biostatisticians' mindset, who also developed methods to cope with the high dimensionality of omics data (see below). On the other hand, the challenges of omics data also spurred the recent publication of many methods adopting machine learning, which however did not yet make it into clinical trial analysis routine, but which we wish to test (see below). We will focus on methods readily available in SAS or as R packages.

For the biostatistics part, the concordance statistics (c-index) will be used as an overall measure of predictive accuracy, and time-dependent ROC curves and AUC will be used to summarize the predictive accuracy at different cut-off points in time. For the machine learning part, the cross-validated accuracy and AUC/c-index, following 94 , are used, and to take care of a potential Simpson's paradox we will either analyse the data stratified by gender, or we will add such an analysis and check for consistency.

For selection of the most important features that might be related to the primary endpoint we will use a procedure proposed by Sauerbrei et al. 103 , as follows. First, 100 bootstrap samples will be generated. Then, a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model with backward elimination with selection level of 0.05 will be fitted to each replication of the original data set. In a second step features with a relative selection frequency of 30% or less over all bootstrap samples will be eliminated. In a third step each feature Xi for which the hypothesis of independence in combination with a feature Xj can be rejected will be eliminated if Xi is less important when Xj is included in the model, or if it does not gain importance when Xj is excluded from the model. All remaining features will be included in the final model. Graphical and numerical methods will be performed to establish the validity of the proportionality assumption 104 in the final model. Results will be reported as p-values, HRs and corresponding 95%-CIs. A p-value of p \u22640.05 will be interpreted as indicating statistical significance. From the final model a risk score will be calculated by multiplying the individual feature measurement of a patient with the estimated regression coefficient of each feature.

All secondary endpoints will be evaluated using the same approach as for the primary endpoint except for the sum-score used as a surrogate for \"aging\". For this endpoint, a linear mixed effects model with random intercept and spatial power covariance structure will be fitted to the data to estimate the progression of \"aging\". The covariance structure is chosen to reflect the unequal intervals of follow up investigations. Model assumptions and model fit will be checked by visual inspection of residuals, and influence diagnostics. Missing values will be taken into account by a likelihood-based approach within the framework of mixed linear models with the assumption that missing values occur at random. Results will be reported as p-value assessed at a level of significance of 5% accompanied by the value of the test statistic and degrees of freedom.

Intervening into these processes may delay, stop or reverse morbidity. To study the link between (co-)morbidity and aging, by exploring biomarkers and molecular mechanisms of diseasetriggered deterioration, we will recruit 50 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, 50 patients with (thromboembolic) ischemic stroke and 50 controls, at Rostock University Medical Center. Methods and Analysis: We will gather routine blood data, clinical performance measurements and patient-reported outcomes at up to 7 points in time, and in-depth transcriptomics & proteomics at two early time points. Aiming for clinically relevant biomarkers, the primary outcome is a composite of probable sarcopenia, clinical performance (described by ECOG Performance Status for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and the Modified Rankin Scale for patients with stroke) and quality of life. Further outcomes cover other aspects of morbidity such as cognitive decline, and of comorbidity such as vascular or cancerous events. The data analysis is comprehensive in that it includes biostatistics & machine learning, both following standard role models & additional explorative approaches.",

            "text": "Study Rationale and Aims. The primary aim of the SASKit (\"Senescence-Associated Systems diagnostics Kit for cancer and stroke\") study is to discover a set of molecular biomarkers for outcomes after pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and ischemic stroke (IS), which are specifically useful to predict disease-triggered deterioration of health (\"disease deterioration\" for short) in terms of probable sarcopenia 1 , reduced clinical performance and quality of life (QoL). The outcomes also include the (co-)morbidity of vascular events (here defined as stroke, myocardial infarction, and venous or arterial thromboembolism) in patients with PDAC, which are observed frequently apart from sarcopenia. Also included is the (co-)morbidity of any kind of cancer and of cognitive decline following IS. Moreover, we consider mortality, as the most canonical outcome. Following up on the primary aim, we will investigate the nature of the molecular biomarkers to find out whether cellular senescence and other aging-associated processes are contributing to disease deterioration. As a secondary aim, we will search for diagnostic biomarkers related to cellular senescence and other aging-related processes that may differentiate healthy controls from PDAC or IS patients. Therefore, in the following we motivate our study by describing the prevalence and the outcomes of PDAC and IS, the known predictors of these outcomes, and the specific prevalence of co-morbidity and known predictors for this comorbidity. The role of cellular senescence in aging and disease is described in Box 1. The background of the cancerous and vascular comorbidity is described in Box 2. Importantly, despite differences in disease pathology, dynamics and prognosis, there is a lot of evidence that cellular senescence is, in part, an important contributor to disease etiology, progression and consequences for both diseases. Avoiding unclear or circular terminology, we define a biomarker in a very general fashion, simply as a feature (data point) f 1 that successfully predicts another feature f 2 at a later time-point 2 , in a biomedical context. Here, features may be composite ones, based on the measurement of individual features. Often, feature f 1 refers to molecular data, while feature f 2 refers to phenotypic data, such as clinical outcomes. Ultimately, we aim to identify biomarkers that are easy to measure, and that are then validated in other studies to predict a clinically relevant outcome. The study design is illustrated in Figure 1 , while the data analysis plan is summarized in Figure 2 .",

Age is the most important risk factor, and incidence peaks at 65 to 69 years in males and 75 to 79 years in females 3 . Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common histological type of pancreatic cancer 4 . The disease is characterized by late clinical presentation 5 , early metastases and poor prognosis, with a one-year survival rate in Europe of only 15% 6 . Many patients have unresectable disease at the time of diagnosis, either as locally advanced disease or already with metastases. Therefore therapy is palliative consisting of chemotherapy and/or best supportive care. Disease deterioration with weight loss and low muscle strength, that is, cachexia and sarcopenia 7 , will follow, for some patients rapidly (within a few weeks) and for others during a longer interval of one or two years. Recent developments in oncology have not shown much benefit in clinical trials of patients with PDAC 8 . Inflammation, desmoplasia and early metastases are deemed responsible for the difficulties in targeting the disease. Moreover, vascular events are frequent problems in the course of PDAC and may contribute to disease deterioration or early death. Venous thromboembolism is the most common event occurring in up to 34% of patients with metastatic PDAC 9 10 , but arterial ischemic events, like stroke, are also reported 11-14 15 16 , see also Box 2. Therefore, deterioration and mortality in PDAC can not only be explained by tumor progression as such, but other factors like sarcopenia/cachexia and vascular events contribute as well. Furthermore, we suggest that the underlying cause of all these factors are aging-related processes such as cellular senescence and chronic inflammation.",

Referring to the endpoint of overall survival, some recent studies tried to establish inflammation-based scores to better characterize outcome in PDAC. In a retrospective analysis of 386 patients with PDAC of different stages, CRP/Alb ratio, neutrophillymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and modified Glasgow prognostic score (mGPS) were studied 17 . In patients with locally advanced and metastatic disease, the CRP/alb ratio was an independent factor of poor survival 17 . Another retrospective study evaluating CA19-9, CEA, CRP, LDH and bilirubin levels in locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer patients treated with chemotherapy showed an independent prognostic significance for overall survival only for CA 19-9 decline during treatment 18 . Other studies have evaluated risk factors for thromboembolic events in pancreatic cancer patients and more generally in patients with cancer 19 (see also Box 2) . The Khorana score, developed more than ten years ago, is widely used to estimate venous thromboembolic risk in the population of cancer patients 20 ; it integrates standard laboratory parameters (platelet count, hemoglobin, leukocyte count), body mass index (BMI) and the cancer site (with pancreatic cancer and gastric cancer classified as very high risk). Still, its performance was questioned in a retrospective cohort of pancreatic cancer patients 21 and in a prospective cohort study of patients with different cancer types, among them 109 with pancreatic cancer 19 . The clinical association of PDAC, sarcopenia/cachexia and thromboembolism is well-described 11 , but still not understood in its pathophysiology 22 . Within the SASKit study we aim to identify biomarkers and molecular mechanisms contributing to this clinical association, by investigating their relation to clinically relevant outcomes.",

The mean age of acute stroke patients is 73-74 years, with more than 80% of patients being over 60 years old. After a first stroke, nearly 5% of patients suffer a second stroke within a year. Mortality after IS is about 12% within one year and about 30% within five years 23 . Mild to moderately disabled stroke survivors showed an elevated prevalence of sarcopenia >6 months after onset of stroke compared with non-stroke individuals (13.2% vs 5.3%) 24 . The mechanisms underlying sarcopenia include loss of muscle mass, reduction of fibre cross-sectional area and increased intramuscular fat deposition occurring between 3 weeks and 6 months after stroke in both paretic and non-paretic limbs 25 . Comorbid, or subsequent cancer may facilitate sarcopenia after IS. A US nationwide inpatient sample study reported that 10% of hospitalized IS patients have comorbid cancer, 16% of them with gastrointestinal cancer and 1% with PDAC, and that this association may be on the rise 26 . Additionally, within two years after IS, another 2% to 4% of patients receive a new cancer diagnosis [27] [28] [29] . Within the SASKit study we aim to identify biomarkers to predict outcome after IS in terms of general health state (i.e. sarcopenia, deterioration of clinical performance, cognitive functioning, frailty) and quality of life, as well as (co-)morbidity, as we do for the PDAC cohort.

More recent studies uniformly identified age and stroke severity, usually assessed on the NIHSS or similar scales, as biomarkers of long-term functional outcome and mortality after stroke 31 32 . Fibrinogen has been related to long-term outcome after stroke 33 34 . There have been conflicting data on the predictive value of serum bilirubin levels on the long term risk of cardiovascular disease. While some studies are in favor of a predictive value (e.g.: [35] [36] [37] ), others are not (e.g.: 38 ). Also, CRP levels have been reported to impact the functional long-term outcome after IS 39 , and early neurological deterioration after IS has been related to decreasing albumin levels, elevated CRP and fibrinogen levels 40 . Potential biomarkers for occult cancer in IS patients include elevated D-dimers, fibrinogen, and CRP; infarction in multiple vascular territories; and poor nutritional status 41 . Interestingly, IS patients with elevation of at least two of the following coagulation-related serum markers, that is, D-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1.2, thrombin-antithrombin complex and fibrin monomer, in the post-acute phase of stroke, were more likely to have occult cancer or recurrent stroke during follow-up for 1.4\u00b10.8 years 42 . In another study of acute IS patients, high D-dimer levels at admission were independently associated with recurrent stroke and all-cause mortality during follow-up for up to 3 years 43 . These findings underpin the idea of shared risk factors for unfavorable outcomes in IS as well as cancer and they suggest that there may be coagulation-related biomarkers indicating an early stage of carcinogenesis or stroke (see also Box 2) . Nevertheless, the clinical biomarkers that currently exist for predicting outcome are limited in their performance and clinical utility, and there is a need to overcome the limitations of current predictive models 44 .",

            "text": "Extra lifetime gained over the last century led to the widespread emergence of age-related diseases that are rarely seen in younger people. Older patients are thus more likely to display several comorbidities, which makes treatment difficult and expensive. Over the last years, strong evidence has accumulated that the presence of senescent cells (i.e. non-dividing, arrested but metabolically active cells that escape apoptosis) is causally involved in diseases such as atherosclerosis, cancer, fibrosis, pancreatitis, osteoarthritis, Alzheimer disease and metabolic disorders 45 46 . Evidence that senescent cells are not only correlated with aging and diseases, but are instead causally involved, comes from recent studies, which transplanted senescent cells from old into young mice 47 . This resulted in persistent functional impairment as well as spread of cellular senescence to host tissues. Another strong line of evidence comes from experiments that actually removed senescent cells from aged mice by senolytics [47] [48] [49] . In each case an increase in lifespan and a delay of typical age related diseases was observed. Most recently, the results of human pilot trials of putative senolytic treatments in case of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and osteoarthritis have been reported. One team 50 treated idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients with dasatinib and quercetin and demonstrated safety as well as notable improvements in some physical abilities. Furthermore, a human phase-1 study demonstrated that a senolytic compound, which was applied locally in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, was safe and well-tolerated 51 . A clinically meaningful improvement in several measures, including pain, function, as well as modulation of certain senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors and disease-related biomarkers was observed after a single dose.",

In turn, strong associations between coagulation, cellular senescence and the SASP 52 . While cellular senescence can suppress PDAC and cancerous proliferation in general, it also triggers tumor progression by fostering inflammatory processes, including the SASP, while on the other hand, after ischemic stroke, it attenuates recovery [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] . For both diseases, causal influences can be traced back to molecular determinants: PAI-1 (also known as SERPINE1 and part of the SASP) is involved in cancer-triggered thromboembolism 54 56 and stroke recovery in animals 58 . Other proteins involved in cellular senescence, specifically inflammatory cytokines such as IL6, and the lesser known osteopontin and gelsolin, are also markers for both PDAC and stroke [59] [60] [61] [62] . The cyclin-dependent kinase CDK5 63 is implicated in the progression of PDAC as well as in the recovery from stroke 57 64 . Moreover, apart from being genetic risk factors 65 66 , the most prominent drivers of cellular senescence (p16/CDKN2A and p21/CDKN1A) also promote PDAC progression 67 and endothelial embolic and arteriosclerotic mechanisms of stroke 68 . Finally, two smallmolecule interventions into cellular senescence, fisetin and quercetin, are both potential treatments of both PDAC and stroke. In case of stroke, the blood-brain-barrier is passed by quercetin which improves stroke outcome 69 . In case of PDAC it was observed that quercetin inhibits pancreatic cancer growth in-vitro and in-vivo 70 . Fisetin is found in various fruits (especially strawberries) and it is chemically similar to quercetin, with strong putative senolytic effects, extending lifespan of mice even when intervention with fisetin started only at an advanced age 71 . In a study involving nude mice implanted with prostate cancer cells, treatment with fisetin significantly retarded tumor growth 72 . Also, in case of lung cancer, there is evidence for the beneficial effects of fisetin. One study showed that fisetin provides protection against benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P]-induced lung carcinogenesis in albino mice 73 and another in vivo study demonstrated the synergistic effects of fisetin and cyclophosphamide in reducing the growth of lung carcinoma in mice 74 . Several other studies have also demonstrated its anticarcinogenic, neurotrophic and anti-inflammatory effects that are beneficial in numerous diseases, including pancreatic cancer and stroke 75 .",

For controls, the experimental blood analysis will be carried out at month 0 and at month 12, assuming that for these, data do not change much in the 3 months after baseline. The justification for taking the better state in case of stroke is the maximization of differences with the 12 months follow-up data. In terms of practicality (being able to calculate a biomarker signature sooner), however, the state at month 0 should be selected for all stroke patients. Since the blood sample will be taken pre-processed and frozen at month 0 in all cases, we are in principle able to perform the experimental blood analysis for all stroke patients at month 0, and we can do this analysis in retrospect if deemed necessary. We also take blood of PDAC patients at month 12, to have the option to do an experimental blood analysis if deemed useful. In the following we will refer to the baseline time-point (month 0, or month 3 in cases of stroke patients that improved) and the landmark time-point (month 3 for PDAC patients and month 12 for stroke patients and controls).

T cells are of interest because these were reported to carry the strongest signal with respect to cellular senescence, based on the marker p16 77 . We intend to measure gelsolin and osteopontin as well, provided that sufficiently standardized assays become available in due time; the blood collected for this measurement shall otherwise be used to measure cytokines/chemokines such as IL6, IL8 and TNF\u0251, which are part of the SASP, by ELISA assays. At time of writing, we do not yet have reliable estimates on the amount of blood cells still available for measuring protein expression, so an antibody-based protein array (in case of low amounts), or mass spectrometry (in case of sufficiently high amounts) will be used alternatively. For the blood serum, we intend to use the same protein measurement method. In the default case of a protein array, we plan to use the novel but dedicated \"Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) Antibody Sampler Kit\" (consisting of approx. 10 SASP-related proteins being measured; Cell Signaling Technology) for both cellular and serum proteomics. Further exploratory molecular analyses not (yet) funded but permitted based on the ethics approval include the following: single-cell analyses of blood, methylation assays for calculating epigenetic clocks 78 , genetics by SNP array or whole-genome sequencing, and telomere length. A separate ethics approval was granted for an optional skin biopsy; skin microbiome analyses are planned as well. More specifically, participants have the option to provide a skin biopsy of 5 mm from an area that is not usually visible. We expect that about 30-50% of the participants will opt in. We keep the biopsy in culture for several days and divide it into several pieces. Using these, we measure biomarkers of cellular senescence (specifically, senescence-associated beta-galactosidase, which cannot easily be measured in blood) and we treat some pieces with compounds that may affect cellular senescence, such as quercetin or fisetin. Moreover, we plan to sample the microbiome of the forehead using a standard swab. This is a very simple procedure, motivated by the claim that a competitive epigenetic aging clock can be based on such a sample 79 .",

Grip strength has been widely used for assessing muscle strength, which is currently used as the most reliable measure of muscle function, loss of which indicating sarcopenia 1 . ECOG PS is established in describing the general condition of patients with cancer, whereas mRS is established in patients with stroke. Death is reflected by both scores as ECOG PS of 5 or mRS of 6, and it will always consider death from any cause. The EQ-5D-5L evaluates QoL in five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), all relevant for patients with PDAC and IS. Furthermore, it is a generic score so that results will be comparable for different diseases (as recently described in patients with stroke 91 ) and for the general population 92 ). Even though disease-specific scores might evaluate symptom burden in even more detail, the EQ-5D-5L was recently shown to be comparable to QoL scores developed specifically for pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis (that is, PEmb-QoL, VEINES-QOL/Sym and PACT-Q2) in terms of acceptability, validity and responsiveness 93 . A clinical deterioration in EQ-5D-5L is described as a minimal important difference in the range from 0.07 to 0.09 index points and in VAS from 7 to 10 94 which is the basis for the definition of item (c). Controls reach their endpoint by the same definition as the subcohort for which they serve as control; in any integrative analysis of both subtrials, a deterioration of the mRS by at least one point will be used as the criterion (instead of ECOG PS), because stroke patients in general have a slower deterioration than PDAC patients, and controls naturally have the slowest expected deterioration.",

This delineation is justified by (a) the paradigm that (clinical) relevance is tied to high-level phenotypes describing health and survival, specifically including QoL 2 , and (b) the goal of developing a \"senescence-associated systems diagnostics kit\" that includes a careful selection of biomarkers contributing, as much as possible, also to molecular-mechanistic insights into PDAC, IS and their (co-)morbidity, which we hypothesize to be related to cellular senescence and aging.

Our feature integration approach (see above) is also known as a \"late integration\" type of analysis, implying that measurements for different omics data types are reduced early on to activation scores for pathways or subnetworks that are then integrated at a \"late\" level. To calculate the activation scores for subnetworks, we use, by default, the ExprEssence/FocusHeuristics linkscore 99 100 , taking the links (gene/protein interactions) from a functional interaction network defaulting to STRING. Our experience with the linkscore motivates us to include this method as one of the approaches proposed for feature integration in the following, influencing the calculation of up to 10 features on which the standard biostatistics and machine learning shall be based. Specifically, we take the average expression measurement for all patients (as a list of expression values, one per gene) and the average for all controls (as a list of expression values, one per gene) to calculate a linkscore for each STRING interaction, and assemble a \"condensed\" network including all interactions with a linkscore in that percentile for which the 50 highest-scoring interactions are shown. These interactions form subnetworks. We then take the average linkscore for each subnetwork as the subnetwork activation score. Alternative methods such as keypathwayminer will be used in the exploratory analyses, see below. For the pathways (such as KEGG), we will calculate pathway activation scores using Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) 101 . This method calculates pathway activation scores from expression data, is suited for use with microarray as well as RNAseq data and performed strongly in a recent benchmarking analysis 102 . The GSVA-based pathway activation scores can subsequently be compared between patients and controls in the same way as normal gene expression data, calculating, for each pathway, a fold-change of the pathway activation scores between patients and controls. Here, we average over all patients and over all controls, respectively, using the limma R package and adjusting for age and gender of the individual patient/control pathway activation. An example of this approach is given in the GSVA publication, where differential pathway activation was identified between acute lymphoblastic lymphoma and mixed-lineage lymphoma 101 . The major downside of feature integration may be information loss; subsequent statistical and machine-learning-based analyses receive only a tiny fraction of the amount of information that is available in total. Gene expression data (transcriptomics) will be our preferred omics data type. Nevertheless, proteins are closer to the phenotype than transcripts, so we wish to not ignore these. Therefore, we prepare to deal with both kinds of proteome data that we may expect (see \"Experimental blood analyses\", above), as follows.",

For selection of the most important features that might be related to the primary endpoint we will use a procedure proposed 106 , as follows. First, 100 bootstrap samples will be generated. Then, a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model with backward elimination with selection level of 0.05 will be fitted to each replication of the original data set. In a second step features with a relative selection frequency of 30% or less over all bootstrap samples will be eliminated. In a third step each feature Xi for which the hypothesis of independence in combination with a feature Xj can be rejected will be eliminated if Xi is less important when Xj is included in the model, or if it does not gain importance when Xj is excluded from the model. All remaining features will be included in the final model. Graphical and numerical methods will be performed to establish the validity of the proportionality assumption 107 in the final model. Results will be reported as p-values, HRs and corresponding 95%-CIs. A p-value of p \u22640.05 will be interpreted as indicating statistical significance. From the final model a risk score will be calculated by multiplying the individual feature measurement of a patient with the estimated regression coefficient of each feature. The c-index will be used as an overall measure of predictive accuracy of the resulting score, a time-dependent ROC curve and AUC will be used to summarize the predictive accuracy of the score at specific times. All secondary endpoints will be evaluated using the same approach as for the primary endpoint except for the sum-score used as a surrogate for \"aging\". For this endpoint, a linear mixed effects model with random intercept and spatial power covariance structure will be fitted to the data to estimate the progression of \"aging\". The covariance structure is chosen to reflect the unequal intervals of follow up investigations. Model assumptions and model fit will be checked by visual inspection of residuals, and influence diagnostics. Missing values will be taken into account by a likelihood-based approach within the framework of mixed linear models with the assumption that missing values occur at random. Results will be reported as p-value assessed at a level of significance of 5% accompanied by the value of the test statistic and degrees of freedom.

Second, we could not identify role-model publications reporting results of biomarker explorations that made use of machine learning methods, except for, to some extent, 119 , so that we enter unknown territory to some degree. The two most obvious risks to our goal of investigating the role of cellular senescence in the (co-)morbidity of PDAC and IS could be an insufficient prevalence of co-morbid events, and the complex role of treatment in case of PDAC, where additional cellular senescence is most likely triggered by therapeutic intervention 121 .

The primary aim of the SASKit (\"Senescence-Associated Systems diagnostics Kit for cancer and stroke\") study is to discover a set of molecular biomarkers for outcomes after pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and ischemic stroke (IS), which are specifically useful to predict disease-triggered deterioration of health (\"disease deterioration\" for short) in terms of probable sarcopenia 1 , reduced clinical performance and quality of life (QoL). The outcomes also include the (co-)morbidity of vascular events (here defined as stroke, myocardial infarction, and venous or arterial thromboembolism) in patients with PDAC, which are observed frequently apart from sarcopenia. Also included is the (co-)morbidity of any kind of cancer and of cognitive decline. Moreover, we consider mortality, as the most canonical outcome. Following up on the primary aim, we will investigate the nature of the molecular biomarkers to find out whether cellular senescence and other aging-associated processes are contributing to disease deterioration. As a secondary aim, we will search for potential diagnostic biomarkers related to cellular senescence and other aging-related processes that may differentiate healthy controls from PDAC or IS patients. Therefore, in the following we motivate our study by describing the prevalence and the outcomes of PDAC and IS, the known predictors of these outcomes, and the specific prevalence of co-morbidity as well as known predictors for this co-morbidity. The role of cellular senescence in aging and disease is described in Box 1. The background of the cancerous and vascular comorbidity is described in Box 2. Importantly, despite differences in disease pathology, dynamics and prognosis, there is a lot of evidence that cellular senescence is an important contributor to disease etiology, progression and consequences for both diseases. Avoiding unclear or circular terminology, we define a biomarker in a very general fashion, simply as a feature (data point) f 1 that successfully predicts another feature f 2 at a later time-point 2 , in a biomedical context. Here, features may be composites, based on the measurement of individual features. Often, feature f 1 refers to molecular data, while feature f 2 refers to phenotypic data, such as clinical outcomes. Ultimately, we aim to identify biomarkers that are easy to measure, and that can then be validated in other studies to predict a clinically relevant outcome. The study design is illustrated in Figure 1 , while the data analysis plan is summarized in Figure 2 .",

Age is the most important risk factor, and incidence peaks at 65 to 69 years in males and 75 to 79 years in females 3 . Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common histological type of pancreatic cancer 4 . The disease is characterized by late clinical presentation 5 , early metastases and poor prognosis, with a one-year survival rate in Europe of only 15% 6 . Many patients have unresectable disease at the time of diagnosis, either as locally advanced disease or already with metastases. In these cases, therapy is palliative consisting of chemotherapy and/or best supportive care. Disease deterioration with weight loss and low muscle strength, that is, cachexia and sarcopenia 7 , will follow, for some patients rapidly (within a few weeks) and for others during a longer interval of one or two years. Recent developments in oncology have not shown much benefit in clinical trials of patients with PDAC 8 . Inflammation, desmoplasia and early metastases are deemed responsible for the difficulties in targeting the disease. Moreover, vascular events are frequently observed in the course of PDAC and may contribute to disease deterioration or early death. Venous thromboembolism is the most common event occurring in up to 34% of patients with metastatic PDAC 9 10 , but arterial ischemic events, like stroke, are also reported 11-14 15 16 , see also Box 2. Therefore, deterioration and mortality in PDAC can be explained not only by tumor progression, but also with other factors like sarcopenia/cachexia and vascular events contributing as well. Furthermore, we suggest that the underlying cause of all these factors are agingrelated processes such as cellular senescence and chronic inflammation.",

            "text": "In PDAC patients there is a lack of established scores describing the risk of disease deterioration and the risk of sarcopenia/cachexia in particular. Referring to the endpoint of overall survival, some recent studies tried to establish inflammation-based scores to better characterize outcome in PDAC. In a retrospective analysis of 386 patients with PDAC of different stages, CRP/Alb ratio, neutrophillymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and modified Glasgow prognostic score (mGPS) were studied 17 . In patients with locally advanced and metastatic disease, the CRP/Alb ratio was an independent factor of poor survival 17 . Another retrospective study evaluating CA19-9, CEA, CRP, LDH and bilirubin levels in locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer patients treated with chemotherapy showed an independent prognostic significance for overall survival only for CA 19-9 decline during treatment 18 . Other studies have evaluated risk factors for thromboembolic events in pancreatic cancer patients and more generally in patients with cancer 19 (see also Box 2). The \"Khorana score\", developed more than ten years ago, is widely used to estimate venous thromboembolic risk in the population of cancer patients 20 . This score integrates standard laboratory parameters (platelet count, hemoglobin, leukocyte count), body mass index (BMI) and the cancer site (with pancreatic cancer and gastric cancer classified as very high risk). Still, its performance was questioned in a retrospective cohort of pancreatic cancer patients 21 and in a prospective cohort study of patients with different cancer types, among them 109 with pancreatic cancer 19 . The clinical association of PDAC, sarcopenia/cachexia and thromboembolism is well-described 11 , but still not understood in its pathophysiology 22 . Within the SASKit study we aim to identify biomarkers and molecular mechanisms contributing to this clinical association, by investigating their relation to clinically relevant outcomes.",

            "text": "Ischemic stroke (IS) occurs in the German population with an incidence of 236 per 100,000 per year 23 . The mean age of acute stroke patients is 73-74 years, with more than 80% of patients being over 60 years old. After a first stroke, nearly 5% of patients suffer a second stroke within a year. Mortality after IS is about 12% within one year and about 30% within five years 23 . Mild to moderately disabled stroke survivors showed an elevated prevalence of sarcopenia >6 months after onset of stroke compared with non-stroke individuals (13.2% vs 5.3%) 24 . The mechanisms underlying sarcopenia include loss of muscle mass, reduction of fibre cross-sectional area and increased intramuscular fat deposition occurring between 3 weeks and 6 months after stroke in both paretic and non-paretic limbs 25 . Comorbid, or subsequent cancer may facilitate sarcopenia after IS. A US nationwide inpatient sample study reported that 10% of hospitalized IS patients have comorbid cancer, 16% of them with gastrointestinal cancer and 1% with PDAC, and that this association may be on the rise 26 . Additionally, within two years after IS, another 2% to 4% of patients receive a new cancer diagnosis [27] [28] [29] . Within the SASKit study we aim to identify biomarkers to predict outcome after IS in terms of general health state (i.e. sarcopenia, deterioration of clinical performance, cognitive functioning, frailty) and quality of life, as well as (co-)morbidity, as we do for the PDAC cohort.

More recent studies uniformly identified age and stroke severity, usually assessed on the NIHSS or similar scales, as biomarkers of long-term functional outcome and mortality after stroke 31 32 . Fibrinogen has been related to long-term outcome after stroke 33 34 . There have been conflicting data on the predictive value of serum bilirubin levels on the long term risk of cardiovascular disease. While some studies are in favor of a predictive value [35] [36] [37] , others are not 38 . Also, CRP levels have been reported to impact the functional long-term outcome after IS 39 , and early neurological deterioration after IS has been related to decreasing albumin levels, elevated CRP and fibrinogen levels 40 . Potential biomarkers for occult cancer in IS patients include elevated D-dimers, fibrinogen, and CRP; infarction in multiple vascular territories; and poor nutritional status 41 . Interestingly, IS patients with elevation of at least two of the following coagulation-related serum markers, that is, D-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1.2, thrombinantithrombin complex and fibrin monomer, in the post-acute phase of stroke, were more likely to have occult cancer or recurrent stroke during follow-up for 1.4\u00b10.8 years 42 . In another study of acute IS patients, high D-dimer levels at admission were independently associated with recurrent stroke and all-cause mortality during follow-up for up to 3 years 43 . These findings underpin the idea of shared risk factors for unfavorable outcomes in IS as well as cancer and they suggest that there may be coagulation-related biomarkers indicating an early stage of carcinogenesis or stroke (see also Box 2) . Nevertheless, the clinical biomarkers that currently exist for predicting outcome are limited in their performance and clinical utility, and there is a need to overcome the limitations of current predictive models 44 .",

            "text": "Extra lifetime gained over the last century led to the widespread emergence of age-related diseases that are rarely seen in younger people. Older patients are thus more likely to display several comorbidities, making treatment difficult and expensive. Over the last years, strong evidence has accumulated that the presence of senescent cells (i.e. non-dividing but secretory, damaged, and metabolically active cells that escape apoptosis) is causally involved in diseases such as atherosclerosis, cancer, fibrosis, pancreatitis, osteoarthritis, Alzheimer disease and metabolic disorders 45 46 . Evidence that senescent cells are not only correlated with aging and diseases, but are also causally involved, comes from recent studies, which transplanted senescent cells from old into young mice 47 . This resulted in persistent functional impairment as well as spread of cellular senescence to host tissues. Another strong line of evidence comes from experiments that actually removed senescent cells from aged mice by senolytics [47] [48] [49] . In each case an increase in lifespan and a delay of typical age related diseases was observed. Most recently, the results of human pilot trials of putative senolytic treatments in case of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and osteoarthritis have been reported. One team 50 treated idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients with dasatinib and quercetin and demonstrated safety as well as notable improvements in some physical abilities. Furthermore, a human phase-1 study demonstrated that a senolytic compound, which was applied locally in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, was safe and well-tolerated 51 . A clinically meaningful improvement in several measures, including pain, function, as well as modulation of certain senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors and disease-related biomarkers was observed after a single dose.",

In turn, strong associations between coagulation, cellular senescence and the SASP were recently demonstrated 52 53 . While cellular senescence can suppress PDAC and cancerous proliferation in general, it also triggers tumor progression by fostering inflammatory processes, including the SASP, while on the other hand, after ischemic stroke, it attenuates recovery [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] . For both diseases, causal influences can be traced back to molecular determinants: PAI-1 (also known as SERPINE1 and part of the SASP) is involved in cancer-triggered thromboembolism 55 57 and stroke recovery in animals 59 . Other proteins involved in cellular senescence, specifically inflammatory cytokines such as IL6, and the lesser known osteopontin and gelsolin, are also markers for both PDAC and stroke [60] [61] [62] [63] . The cyclin-dependent kinase CDK5 64 is implicated in the progression of PDAC as well as in the recovery from stroke 58 65 . Moreover, apart from being genetic risk factors 66 67 , the most prominent drivers of cellular senescence (p16/CDKN2A and p21/CDKN1A) also promote PDAC progression 68 and endothelial embolic and arteriosclerotic mechanisms of stroke 69 . Finally, two smallmolecule interventions into cellular senescence, fisetin and quercetin, are both potential therapeutic agents of PDAC and stroke. In case of stroke, the blood-brain-barrier is passed by quercetin which improves stroke outcome 70 . In case of PDAC it was observed that quercetin inhibits pancreatic cancer growth in-vitro and in-vivo 71 . Fisetin is found in various fruits (especially strawberries) and it is chemically similar to quercetin, with strong putative senolytic effects, extending lifespan of mice even when intervention with fisetin started only at an advanced age 72 . In a study involving nude mice implanted with prostate cancer cells, treatment with fisetin significantly retarded tumor growth 73 . Also, in case of lung cancer, there is evidence for the beneficial effects of fisetin. One study showed that fisetin provides protection against benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P]-induced lung carcinogenesis in albino mice 74 and another in vivo study demonstrated the synergistic effects of fisetin and cyclophosphamide in reducing the growth of lung carcinoma in mice 75 . Several other studies have also demonstrated its anticarcinogenic, neurotrophic and anti-inflammatory effects that are beneficial in numerous diseases, including pancreatic cancer and stroke 76 .",

It will furthermore be repeated at month 3 in the case of PDAC, and at month 12 in the case of stroke (\"landmark\"). For controls, the experimental blood analysis will be carried out at month 0 and at month 12, assuming that for these, data do not change much in the 3 months after baseline. The justification for taking the better clinical state in case of stroke is the maximization of differences with the month 12 follow-up data. In terms of practicality (being able to calculate a biomarker signature sooner), however, the state at month 0 should be selected for all stroke patients. Since the blood sample will be taken pre-processed and frozen at month 0 in all cases, we are in principle able to perform the experimental blood analysis for all stroke patients at month 0, and we can do this analysis in retrospect if deemed necessary. We also take blood of PDAC patients at month 12, to have the option to do an experimental blood analysis based on these samples, if deemed useful. In the following we will refer to the baseline time-point (month 0, or month 3 in cases of stroke patients that improved) and the landmark time-point (month 3 for PDAC patients and month 12 for stroke patients and controls).

T cells are of interest because these cells were reported to carry the strongest signal with respect to cellular senescence, based on the marker p16 78 . We intend to measure gelsolin and osteopontin as well, provided that sufficiently standardized assays become available in due time; the blood collected for this measurement shall otherwise be used to measure cytokines/chemokines such as IL6, IL8 and TNF\u0251, which are part of the SASP, by ELISA assays. At time of writing, we do not yet have reliable estimates on the amount of blood cells still available for measuring protein expression, so an antibody-based protein array (in case of low amounts), or mass spectrometry (in case of sufficiently high amounts) will be used alternatively. For the blood serum, we intend to use the same protein measurement method. In the default case of a protein array, we plan to use the novel but dedicated \"Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) Antibody Sampler Kit\" (consisting of approx. 10 SASP-related proteins being measured; Cell Signaling Technology) for both cellular and serum proteomics. Further exploratory molecular analyses not (yet) funded but permitted based on the ethics approval include the following: single-cell analyses of blood, methylation assays for calculating epigenetic clocks 79 , genetics by SNP array or whole-genome sequencing, and telomere length. A separate ethics approval was granted for an optional skin biopsy; skin microbiome analyses are planned as well. More specifically, participants have the option to provide a skin biopsy of 5 mm from an area that is not usually visible. We expect that about 30-50% of the participants will opt in. We keep the biopsy in culture for several days and divide it into several pieces. Using these, we measure biomarkers of cellular senescence (specifically, senescence-associated \uf062-galactosidase, which cannot easily be measured in blood) and we treat some pieces with compounds that may affect cellular senescence, such as quercetin or fisetin. Moreover, we plan to sample the microbiome of the forehead using a standard swab. This is a very simple procedure, motivated by the claim that a competitive epigenetic aging clock can be based on such a sample 80 .",

Item (a) is the deterioration from \"no sarcopenia\" to \"probable sarcopenia\" as defined by current consensus 1 . Grip strength has been widely used for assessing muscle strength, which is currently used as the most reliable measure of muscle function, loss of which indicating sarcopenia 1 . ECOG PS is established in describing the general condition of patients with cancer, whereas mRS is established in patients with stroke. Death is reflected by both scores as ECOG PS of 5 or mRS of 6, and it will always consider death from any cause. The EQ-5D-5L evaluates QoL in five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), all relevant for patients with PDAC and IS. Furthermore, it is a generic score so that results will be comparable for different diseases (as recently described in patients with stroke 93 and for the general population 94 ). Even though disease-specific scores might evaluate symptom burden in even more detail, the EQ-5D-5L was recently shown to be comparable to QoL scores developed specifically for pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis (that is, PEmb-QoL, VEINES-QOL/Sym and PACT-Q2) in terms of acceptability, validity and responsiveness 95 . A clinical deterioration in EQ-5D-5L is described as a minimal important difference in the range from 0.07 to 0.09 index points and in VAS from 7 to 10 points 96 , which is the basis for the definition of item (c). Controls reach their endpoint by the same definition as the subcohort for which they serve as control; in any integrative analysis of both subtrials, a deterioration of the mRS by at least one point will be used as the criterion (instead of ECOG PS), because stroke patients in general have a slower deterioration than PDAC patients, and controls naturally have the slowest expected deterioration.",

The primary endpoint was defined to integrate expected clinical utility and maximum signal. In defining the (secondary) endpoints, we considered an array of clinically relevant single endpoints as well as a sum-score of all phenotypic measurements; we hypothesize that the latter carries the largest amount of signal.

            "text": "Notably, we face a heterogeneous \"multi-view\" dataset, usually referred to as \"multi-omics\". Our feature integration approach (see above) is also known as a \"late integration\" type of analysis, implying that measurements for different omics data types are reduced early on to activation scores for pathways or subnetworks that are then integrated at a \"late\" level. To calculate the activation scores for subnetworks, we use, by default, the ExprEssence/FocusHeuristics linkscore 101 102 , taking the links (gene/protein interactions) from a functional interaction network defaulting to STRING. Our experience with the linkscore motivates us to include this method as one of the approaches proposed for feature integration in the following, influencing the calculation of up to 10 features on which the standard biostatistics and machine learning shall be based. Specifically, we take the average expression measurement for all patients (as a list of expression values, one per gene) and the average for all controls (as a list of expression values, one per gene) to calculate a linkscore for each STRING interaction, and assemble a \"condensed\" network including all interactions with a linkscore in that percentile for which the 50 highest-scoring interactions are shown. These interactions form subnetworks 103 . We then take the average linkscore for each subnetwork as the subnetwork activation score. Alternative methods such as keypathwayminer will be used in the exploratory analyses, see below. For the pathways (such as KEGG), we will calculate pathway activation scores using Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) 104 . This method calculates pathway activation scores from expression data, is suited for use with microarray as well as RNAseq data and performed strongly in a recent benchmarking analysis 105 . The GSVA-based pathway activation scores can subsequently be compared between patients and controls in the same way as normal gene expression data, calculating, for each pathway, a fold-change of the pathway activation scores between patients and controls. Here, we average over all patients and over all controls, respectively, using the limma R package and adjusting for age and gender of the individual patient/control pathway activation. An example of this approach is given in the GSVA publication, where differential pathway activation was identified between acute lymphoblastic lymphoma and mixed-lineage lymphoma 104 . The major downside of feature integration may be information loss; subsequent statistical and machine-learning-based analyses receive only a tiny fraction of the amount of information that is available in total. Gene expression data (transcriptomics) will be our preferred omics data type. Nevertheless, proteins are closer to the phenotype than transcripts, so we wish to not ignore these. Therefore, we prepare to deal with both kinds of proteome data that we may expect (see \"Experimental blood analyses\", above), as follows. 1. Large-scale data, likely based on mass spectrometry, in the order of hundreds or more proteins that can be identified and measured in all the conditions investigated. 2. Small-scale data, likely based on antibody arrays, in the order of ten proteins or less. Except for the raw data preprocessing depending on the platform, once log-fold changes describing differential expression are established, we thus expect to handle the large-scale proteome data essentially the same as the transcriptomics data, and the small-scale proteome data similarly to the blood routine data, for cells and serum alike. Overall, the omics data are expected to come along three main coordinates, that is, 1. as blood cell transcriptomics and proteomics as well as serum proteomics; 2. longitudinal in time (for baseline and landmark); and 3. for PDAC, IS and control. All coordinates can be exploited for differential analyses, even though the PDAC and IS data will be analyzed separately except for some integrative explorative analyses (see below). In the explorative analyses, the longitudinal transcriptomics of the patients and controls will also be analyzed together, see below. For the standard biostatistics and machine learning analyses, we plan to employ 5 approaches to feature integration, each yielding a shortlist of 5 integrated features, as follows.",

On the other hand, the challenges of omics data also spurred the recent publication of many methods adopting machine learning, which however did not yet make it into clinical trial analysis routine, but which we wish to test (see below).

For the biostatistics part, the concordance statistics (c-index) will be used as an overall measure of predictive accuracy, and time-dependent ROC curves and AUC will be used to summarize the predictive accuracy at different cut-off points in time. For the machine learning part, the cross-validated accuracy and AUC/c-index, following 99 , are used, and to take care of a potential Simpson's paradox we will either analyse the data stratified by gender, or we will add such an analysis and check for consistency.

The 5 shortlists of 5 features (see above) will be providing the canonical predictors, analyzed together. For selection of the most important features that might be related to the primary endpoint we will use a procedure proposed by Sauerbrei et al. 109 , as follows. First, 100 bootstrap samples will be generated. Then, a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model with backward elimination with selection level of 0.05 will be fitted to each replication of the original data set. In a second step features with a relative selection frequency of 30% or less over all bootstrap samples will be eliminated. In a third step each feature X i for which the hypothesis of independence in combination with a feature X j can be rejected will be eliminated if X i is less important when X j is included in the model, or if it does not gain importance when X j is excluded from the model. All remaining features will be included in the final model. Graphical and numerical methods will be performed to establish the validity of the proportionality assumption 110 in the final model. Results will be reported as p-values, HRs and corresponding 95%-CIs. A p-value of p \u22640.05 will be interpreted as indicating statistical significance. From the final model a risk score will be calculated by multiplying the individual feature measurement of a patient with the estimated regression coefficient of each feature. The c-index will be used as an overall measure of predictive accuracy of the resulting score, a time-dependent ROC curve and AUC will be used to summarize the predictive accuracy of the score at specific times. All secondary endpoints will be evaluated using the same approach as for the primary endpoint except for the sum-score used as a surrogate for \"aging\". For this endpoint, a linear mixed effects model with random intercept and spatial power covariance structure will be fitted to the data to estimate the progression of \"aging\". The covariance structure is chosen to reflect the unequal intervals of follow up investigations. Model assumptions and model fit will be checked by visual inspection of residuals, and influence diagnostics. Missing values will be taken into account by a likelihood-based approach within the framework of mixed linear models with the assumption that missing values occur at random. Results will be reported as p-value assessed at a level of significance of 5% accompanied by the value of the test statistic and degrees of freedom. In addition, 95% CIs for the progression (slope) will be provided.",

First, we found it hard to estimate the distribution of events as defined by the primary outcome; we cannot exclude that too many events take place already at the start of the study, or until the first follow-up, specifically in the PDAC subtrial, limiting the amount of information available to the subsequent time-to-event analyses. Then again, had we defined the primary outcome more conservatively, there would have been a chance that not enough events happen before the end of the study. Second, we could not identify role-model publications reporting results of biomarker explorations that made use of machine learning methods, except for, to some extent, Schussler-Fiorenza et al 122 , so that we enter unknown territory to some degree. The two most obvious risks to our goal of investigating the role of cellular senescence in the (co-)morbidity of PDAC and IS could be an insufficient prevalence of co-morbid events, and the complex role of treatment in case of PDAC, where additional cellular senescence is most likely triggered by therapeutic intervention 124 .

Age is the most important risk factor, and incidence peaks at 65 to 69 years in males and 75 to 79 years in females 1 . Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common histological type of pancreatic cancer 2 . The disease is characterized by late clinical presentation 3 , early metastases and poor prognosis, with a one-year survival rate in Europe of only 15% 4 . Many patients have unresectable disease at the time of diagnosis, either as locally advanced disease or already with metastases. In these cases, therapy is palliative consisting of chemotherapy and/or best supportive care. Disease deterioration with weight loss and low muscle strength, that is, cachexia and sarcopenia 5 , will follow, for some patients rapidly (within a few weeks) and for others during a longer interval of one or two years. Recent developments in oncology have not shown much benefit in clinical trials of patients with PDAC 6 . Inflammation, desmoplasia and early metastases are deemed responsible for the difficulties in targeting the disease. Moreover, vascular events are frequently observed in the course of PDAC and may contribute to disease deterioration or early death. Venous thromboembolism is the most common event occurring in up to 34% of patients with metastatic PDAC 7 8 , but arterial ischemic events, like stroke, are also reported 9-12 13 14 , see also Box 2. Therefore, deterioration and mortality in PDAC can be explained not only by tumor progression, but also with other factors like sarcopenia/cachexia and vascular events contributing as well. Furthermore, we suggest that the underlying cause of all these factors are agingrelated processes such as cellular senescence and chronic inflammation.",

            "text": "In PDAC patients there is a lack of established scores describing the risk of disease deterioration and the risk of sarcopenia/cachexia in particular. Referring to the endpoint of overall survival, some recent studies tried to establish inflammation-based scores to better characterize outcome in PDAC. In a retrospective analysis of 386 patients with PDAC of different stages, CRP/Alb ratio, neutrophillymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and modified Glasgow prognostic score (mGPS) were studied 15 . In patients with locally advanced and metastatic disease, the CRP/Alb ratio was an independent factor of poor survival 15 . Another retrospective study evaluating CA19-9, CEA, CRP, LDH and bilirubin levels in locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer patients treated with chemotherapy showed an independent prognostic significance for overall survival only for CA 19-9 decline during treatment 16 . Other studies have evaluated risk factors for thromboembolic events in pancreatic cancer patients and more generally in patients with cancer 17 (see also Box 2) . The \"Khorana score\", developed more than ten years ago, is widely used to estimate venous thromboembolic risk in the population of cancer patients 18 . This score integrates standard laboratory parameters (platelet count, hemoglobin, leukocyte count), body mass index (BMI) and the cancer site (with pancreatic cancer and gastric cancer classified as very high risk). Still, its performance was questioned in a retrospective cohort of pancreatic cancer patients 19 and in a prospective cohort study of patients with different cancer types, among them 109 with pancreatic cancer 17 . The clinical association of PDAC, sarcopenia/cachexia and thromboembolism is well-described 9 , but still not understood in its pathophysiology 20 . Within the SASKit study we aim to identify biomarkers and molecular mechanisms contributing to this clinical association, by investigating their relation to clinically relevant outcomes.",

            "text": "Ischemic stroke, prevalence and outcomes. Ischemic stroke (IS) occurs in the German population with an incidence of 236 per 100,000 per year 21 . The mean age of acute stroke patients is 73-74 years, with more than 80% of patients being over 60 years old. After a first stroke, nearly 5% of patients suffer a second stroke within a year. Mortality after IS is about 12% within one year and about 30% within five years 21 . Mild to moderately disabled stroke survivors showed an elevated prevalence of sarcopenia >6 months after onset of stroke compared with non-stroke individuals (13.2% vs 5.3%) 22 . The mechanisms underlying sarcopenia include loss of muscle mass, reduction of fibre cross-sectional area and increased intramuscular fat deposition occurring between 3 weeks and 6 months after stroke in both paretic and non-paretic limbs 23 . Comorbid, or subsequent cancer may facilitate sarcopenia after IS. A US nationwide inpatient sample study reported that 10% of hospitalized IS patients have comorbid cancer, 16% of them with gastrointestinal cancer and 1% with PDAC, and that this association may be on the rise 24 . Additionally, within two years after IS, another 2% to 4% of patients receive a new cancer diagnosis [25] [26] [27] . Within the SASKit study we aim to identify biomarkers to predict outcome after IS in terms of general health state (i.e. sarcopenia, deterioration of clinical performance, cognitive functioning, frailty) and quality of life, as well as (co-)morbidity, as we do for the PDAC cohort.",

More recent studies uniformly identified age and stroke severity, usually assessed on the NIHSS or similar scales, as biomarkers of long-term functional outcome and mortality after stroke 29 30 . Fibrinogen has been related to long-term outcome after stroke 31 32 . There have been conflicting data on the predictive value of serum bilirubin levels on the long term risk of cardiovascular disease. While some studies are in favor of a predictive value [33] [34] [35] , others are not 36 . Also, CRP levels have been reported to impact the functional long-term outcome after IS 37 , and early neurological deterioration after IS has been related to decreasing albumin levels, elevated CRP and fibrinogen levels 38 . Potential biomarkers for occult cancer in IS patients include elevated D-dimers, fibrinogen, and CRP; infarction in multiple vascular territories; and poor nutritional status 39 . Interestingly, IS patients with elevation of at least two of the following coagulation-related serum markers, that is, D-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1.2, thrombinantithrombin complex and fibrin monomer, in the post-acute phase of stroke, were more likely to have occult cancer or recurrent stroke during follow-up for 1.4\u00b10.8 years 40 . In another study of acute IS patients, high D-dimer levels at admission were independently associated with recurrent stroke and all-cause mortality during follow-up for up to 3 years 41 . These findings underpin the idea of shared risk factors for unfavorable outcomes in IS as well as cancer and they suggest that there may be coagulation-related biomarkers indicating an early stage of carcinogenesis or stroke (see also Box 2) . Nevertheless, the clinical biomarkers that currently exist for predicting outcome are limited in their performance and clinical utility, and there is a need to overcome the limitations of current predictive models 42 .",

            "text": "Study Rationale and Aims. The primary aim of the SASKit (\"Senescence-Associated Systems diagnostics Kit for cancer and stroke\") study is to discover a set of molecular biomarkers for outcomes after PDAC and IS, which are specifically useful to predict disease-triggered deterioration of health (\"disease deterioration\" for short) in terms of probable sarcopenia 43 , reduced clinical performance and quality of life (QoL). The outcomes also include the (co-)morbidity of vascular events (here defined as stroke, myocardial infarction, and venous or arterial thromboembolism) in patients with PDAC, which are observed frequently apart from sarcopenia. Also included is the (co-)morbidity of any kind of cancer and of cognitive decline. Moreover, we consider mortality, as the most canonical outcome. Following up on the primary aim, we will investigate the nature of the molecular biomarkers to find out whether cellular senescence and other aging-associated processes are contributing to disease deterioration. As a secondary aim, we will search for potential diagnostic biomarkers related to cellular senescence and other aging-related processes that may differentiate healthy controls from PDAC or IS patients. Avoiding unclear or circular terminology, we define a biomarker in a very general fashion, simply as a feature (data point) f 1 that successfully predicts another feature f 2 at a later time-point 44 , in a biomedical context. Here, features may be composites, based on the measurement of individual features. Often, feature f 1 refers to molecular data, while feature f 2 refers to phenotypic data, such as clinical outcomes. Ultimately, we aim to identify biomarkers that are easy to measure, and that can then be validated in other studies to predict a clinically relevant outcome.",

            "text": "Extra lifetime gained over the last century led to the widespread emergence of age-related diseases that are rarely seen in younger people. Older patients are thus more likely to display several comorbidities, making treatment difficult and expensive. Over the last years, strong evidence has accumulated that the presence of senescent cells (i.e. non-dividing but secretory, damaged, and metabolically active cells that escape apoptosis) is causally involved in diseases such as atherosclerosis, cancer, fibrosis, pancreatitis, osteoarthritis, Alzheimer disease and metabolic disorders 45 46 . Evidence that senescent cells are not only correlated with aging and diseases, but are also causally involved, comes from recent studies, which transplanted senescent cells from old into young mice 47 . This resulted in persistent functional impairment as well as spread of cellular senescence to host tissues. Another strong line of evidence comes from experiments that actually removed senescent cells from aged mice by senolytics [47] [48] [49] . In each case an increase in lifespan and a delay of typical age related diseases was observed. Most recently, the results of human pilot trials of putative senolytic treatments in case of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and osteoarthritis have been reported. One team 50 treated idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients with dasatinib and quercetin and demonstrated safety as well as notable improvements in some physical abilities. Furthermore, a human phase-1 study demonstrated that a senolytic compound, which was applied locally in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, was safe and well-tolerated 51 . A clinically meaningful improvement in several measures, including pain, function, as well as modulation of certain senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors and disease-related biomarkers was observed after a single dose. 9 . In turn, strong associations between coagulation, cellular senescence and the SASP were recently demonstrated 52 53 . While cellular senescence can suppress PDAC and cancerous proliferation in general, it also triggers tumor progression by fostering inflammatory processes, including the SASP, while on the other hand, after ischemic stroke, it attenuates recovery [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] . For both diseases, causal influences can be traced back to molecular determinants: PAI-1 (also known as SERPINE1 and part of the SASP) is involved in cancer-triggered thromboembolism 55 57 and stroke recovery in animals 59 . Other proteins involved in cellular senescence, specifically inflammatory cytokines such as IL6, and the lesser known osteopontin and gelsolin, are also markers for both PDAC and stroke [60] [61] [62] [63] . The cyclin-dependent kinase CDK5 64 is implicated in the progression of PDAC as well as in the recovery from stroke 58 65 . Moreover, apart from being genetic risk factors 66 67 , the most prominent drivers of cellular senescence (p16/CDKN2A and p21/CDKN1A) also promote PDAC progression 68 and endothelial embolic and arteriosclerotic mechanisms of stroke 69 . Finally, two smallmolecule interventions into cellular senescence, fisetin and quercetin, are both potential therapeutic agents of PDAC and stroke. In case of stroke, the blood-brain-barrier is passed by quercetin which improves stroke outcome 70 . In case of PDAC it was observed that quercetin inhibits pancreatic cancer growth in-vitro and in-vivo 71 . Fisetin is found in various fruits (especially strawberries) and it is chemically similar to quercetin, with strong putative senolytic effects, extending lifespan of mice even when intervention with fisetin started only at an advanced age 72 . In a study involving nude mice implanted with prostate cancer cells, treatment with fisetin significantly retarded tumor growth 73 . Also, in case of lung cancer, there is evidence for the beneficial effects of fisetin. One study showed that fisetin provides protection against benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P]-induced lung carcinogenesis in albino mice 74 and another in vivo study demonstrated the synergistic effects of fisetin and cyclophosphamide in reducing the growth of lung carcinoma in mice 75 . Several other studies have also demonstrated its anticarcinogenic, neurotrophic and anti-inflammatory effects that are beneficial in numerous diseases, including pancreatic cancer and stroke 76 .",

It will furthermore be repeated at month 3 in the case of PDAC, and at month 12 in the case of stroke (\"landmark\"). For controls, the experimental blood analysis will be carried out at month 0 and at month 12, assuming that for these, data do not change much in the 3 months after baseline. The justification for taking the better clinical state in case of stroke is the maximization of differences with the month 12 follow-up data. In terms of practicality (being able to calculate a biomarker signature sooner), however, the state at month 0 should be selected for all stroke patients. Since the blood sample will be taken pre-processed and frozen at month 0 in all cases, we are in principle able to perform the experimental blood analysis for all stroke patients at month 0, and we can do this analysis in retrospect if deemed necessary. We also take blood of PDAC patients at month 12, to have the option to do an experimental blood analysis based on these samples, if deemed useful. In the following we will refer to the baseline time-point (month 0, or month 3 in cases of stroke patients that improved) and the landmark time-point (month 3 for PDAC patients and month 12 for stroke patients and controls).

Further exploratory molecular analyses not (yet) funded but permitted based on the ethics approval include the following: single-cell analyses of blood, methylation assays for calculating epigenetic clocks 79 , genetics by SNP array or whole-genome sequencing, and telomere length. A separate ethics approval was granted for an optional skin biopsy; skin microbiome analyses are planned as well. More specifically, participants have the option to provide a skin biopsy of 5 mm from an area that is not usually visible. We expect that about 30-50% of the participants will opt in. We keep the biopsy in culture for several days and divide it into several pieces. Using these, we measure biomarkers of cellular senescence (specifically, senescence-associated \uf062-galactosidase, which cannot easily be measured in blood) and we treat some pieces with compounds that may affect cellular senescence, such as quercetin or fisetin. Moreover, we plan to sample the microbiome of the forehead using a standard swab.

As described above, for patients with IS who have improved their condition (measured by NIHSS) within the first 3 months, this time point (month 3) will be used as a baseline instead. Item (a) is the deterioration from \"no sarcopenia\" to \"probable sarcopenia\" as defined by current consensus 43 . Grip strength has been widely used for assessing muscle strength, which is currently used as the most reliable measure of muscle function, loss of which indicating sarcopenia 43 . ECOG PS is established in describing the general condition of patients with cancer, whereas mRS is established in patients with stroke. Death is reflected by both scores as ECOG PS of 5 or mRS of 6, and it will always consider death from any cause. The EQ-5D-5L evaluates QoL in five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), all relevant for patients with PDAC and IS. Furthermore, it is a generic score so that results will be comparable for different diseases (as recently described in patients with stroke 93 and for the general population 94 ). Even though disease-specific scores might evaluate symptom burden in even more detail, the EQ-5D-5L was recently shown to be comparable to QoL scores developed specifically for pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis (that is, PEmb-QoL, VEINES-QOL/Sym and PACT-Q2) in terms of acceptability, validity and responsiveness 95 . A clinical deterioration in EQ-5D-5L is described as a minimal important difference in the range from 0.07 to 0.09 index points and in VAS from 7 to 10 points 96 , which is the basis for the definition of item (c). Controls reach their endpoint by the same definition as the subcohort for which they serve as control; in any integrative analysis of both subtrials, a deterioration of the mRS by at least one point will be used as the criterion (instead of ECOG PS), because stroke patients in general have a slower deterioration than PDAC patients, and controls naturally have the slowest expected deterioration.",

This delineation is justified by (a) the paradigm that (clinical) relevance is tied to high-level phenotypes describing health and survival, specifically including QoL 44 , and (b) the goal of developing a \"senescence-associated systems diagnostics kit\" that includes a careful selection of biomarkers contributing, as much as possible, also to molecular-mechanistic insights into PDAC, IS and their (co-)morbidity, which we hypothesize to be related to cellular senescence and aging. Age and gender will be included as mandatory covariates (also termed confounders, that is, predictors which we do not aim to explore, or which we wish to improve upon) in all statistical models. Further covariates are smoking, liver dysfunction or disease, the baseline NIHSS score in case of IS, as well as locally-advanced vs metastatic PDAC and modality of treatment in case of PDAC.

Regarding endpoints, whenever possible, we thus wish to consider the (censored) time-to-event information inherent in the baseline and follow-up examinations, and in the mortality data. The primary endpoint was defined to integrate expected clinical utility and maximum signal. In defining the (secondary) endpoints, we considered an array of clinically relevant single endpoints as well as a sum-score of all phenotypic measurements; we hypothesize that the latter carries the largest amount of signal. Given the small sample, we cannot set aside an extra validation dataset. For the predictors considered to be covariates/confounders, please see the section on \"Predictors\", above.

            "text": "Specific omics data feature integration: Notably, we face a heterogeneous \"multi-view\" dataset, usually referred to as \"multi-omics\". Our feature integration approach (see above) is also known as a \"late integration\" type of analysis, implying that measurements for different omics data types are reduced early on to activation scores for pathways or subnetworks that are then integrated at a \"late\" level. To calculate the activation scores for subnetworks, we use, by default, the ExprEssence/FocusHeuristics linkscore 101 102 , taking the links (gene/protein interactions) from a functional interaction network defaulting to STRING. Our experience with the linkscore motivates us to include this method as one of the approaches proposed for feature integration in the following, influencing the calculation of up to 10 features on which the standard biostatistics and machine learning shall be based. Specifically, we take the average expression measurement for all patients (as a list of expression values, one per gene) and the average for all controls (as a list of expression values, one per gene) to calculate a linkscore for each STRING interaction, and assemble a \"condensed\" network including all interactions with a linkscore in that percentile for which the 50 highest-scoring interactions are shown. These interactions form subnetworks 103 . We then take the average linkscore for each subnetwork as the subnetwork activation score. Alternative methods such as keypathwayminer will be used in the exploratory analyses, see below. For the pathways (such as KEGG), we will calculate pathway activation scores using Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) 104 . This method calculates pathway activation scores from expression data, is suited for use with microarray as well as RNAseq data and performed strongly in a recent benchmarking analysis 105 . The GSVA-based pathway activation scores can subsequently be compared between patients and controls in the same way as normal gene expression data, calculating, for each pathway, a fold-change of the pathway activation scores between patients and controls. Here, we average over all patients and over all controls, respectively, using the limma R package and adjusting for age and gender of the individual patient/control pathway activation. An example of this approach is given in the GSVA publication, where differential pathway activation was identified between acute lymphoblastic lymphoma and mixed-lineage lymphoma 104 . The major downside of feature integration may be information loss; subsequent statistical and machine-learning-based analyses receive only a tiny fraction of the amount of information that is available in total. Gene expression data (transcriptomics) will be our preferred omics data type. Nevertheless, proteins are closer to the phenotype than transcripts, so we wish to not ignore these. Therefore, we prepare to deal with both kinds of proteome data that we may expect (see \"Experimental blood analyses\", above), as follows. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1. Large-scale data, likely based on mass spectrometry, in the order of hundreds or more proteins that can be identified and measured in all the conditions investigated. 2. Small-scale data, likely based on antibody arrays, in the order of ten proteins or less. Except for the raw data preprocessing depending on the platform, once log-fold changes describing differential expression are established, we thus expect to handle the large-scale proteome data essentially the same as the transcriptomics data, and the small-scale proteome data similarly to the blood routine data, for cells and serum alike. Overall, the omics data are expected to come along three main coordinates, that is, 1. as blood cell transcriptomics and proteomics as well as serum proteomics; 2. longitudinal in time (for baseline and landmark); and 3. for PDAC, IS and control. All coordinates can be exploited for differential analyses, even though the PDAC and IS data will be analyzed separately except for some integrative explorative analyses (see below). In the explorative analyses, the longitudinal transcriptomics of the patients and controls will also be analyzed together, see below. For the standard biostatistics and machine learning analyses, we plan to employ 5 approaches to feature integration, each yielding a shortlist of 5 integrated features, as follows.",

For the biostatistics part, the concordance statistics (c-index) will be used as an overall measure of predictive accuracy, and time-dependent ROC curves and AUC will be used to summarize the predictive accuracy at different cut-off points in time. For the machine learning part, the cross-validated accuracy and AUC/c-index, following 99 , are used, and to take care of a potential Simpson's paradox we will either analyse the data stratified by gender, or we will add such an analysis and check for consistency. More generally, to investigate the role of confounders (and, if necessary, to correct for these) in the machine learning part, we wish to use the permutation technique described 107 . We expect that we can identify a set of biomarkers that affords an accuracy of 75% or more or an AUC of 0.75 or more in correctly predicting the primary endpoint with a precision of +/-12% 108 . This estimate of precision is based on half the width of a 95% confidence interval (CI) for a probability of 75%, by extension of item 6 of the tables of Sorzano et al 108 , which shows precision up to a sample size of N=30. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   15 SASKit study protocol V01",

The 5 shortlists of 5 features (see above) will be providing the canonical predictors, analyzed together. For selection of the most important features that might be related to the primary endpoint we will use a procedure proposed by Sauerbrei et al. 109 , as follows. First, 100 bootstrap samples will be generated. Then, a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model with backward elimination with selection level of 0.05 will be fitted to each replication of the original data set. In a second step features with a relative selection frequency of 30% or less over all bootstrap samples will be eliminated. In a third step each feature X i for which the hypothesis of independence in combination with a feature X j can be rejected will be eliminated if X i is less important when X j is included in the model, or if it does not gain importance when X j is excluded from the model. All remaining features will be included in the final model. Graphical and numerical methods will be performed to establish the validity of the proportionality assumption 110 in the final model. Results will be reported as p-values, HRs and corresponding 95%-CIs. A p-value of p \u22640.05 will be interpreted as indicating statistical significance. From the final model a risk score will be calculated by multiplying the individual feature measurement of a patient with the estimated regression coefficient of each feature. The c-index will be used as an overall measure of predictive accuracy of the resulting score, a time-dependent ROC curve and AUC will be used to summarize the predictive accuracy of the score at specific times. All secondary endpoints will be evaluated using the same approach as for the primary endpoint except for the sum-score used as a surrogate for \"aging\". For this endpoint, a linear mixed effects model with random intercept and spatial power covariance structure will be fitted to the data to estimate the progression of \"aging\". The covariance structure is chosen to reflect the unequal intervals of follow up investigations. Model assumptions and model fit will be checked by visual inspection of residuals, and influence diagnostics. Missing values will be taken into account by a likelihood-based approach within the framework of mixed linear models with the assumption that missing values occur at random. Results will be reported as p-value assessed at a level of significance of 5% accompanied by the value of the test statistic and degrees of freedom. In addition, 95% CIs for the progression (slope) will be provided.",

Then again, had we defined the primary outcome more conservatively, there would have been a chance that not enough events happen before the end of the study. Second, we could not identify role-model publications reporting results of biomarker explorations that made use of machine learning methods, except for, to some extent, Schussler-Fiorenza et al 122 , so that we enter unknown territory to some degree. The two most obvious risks to our goal of investigating the role of cellular senescence in the (co-)morbidity of PDAC and IS could be an insufficient prevalence of co-morbid events, and the complex role of treatment in case of PDAC, where additional cellular senescence is most likely triggered by therapeutic intervention 124 .

Employing clinical performance measurements and patient-reported outcomes, we aim for clinical relevance and we suggest that prognostic biomarker signatures for general health and QoL are perhaps more important than (progression-free) survival, although there is much more data about the latter. Moreover, good disease treatment options are still lacking for PDAC as well as for stroke, and the more we find cellular senescence implicated in disease deterioration, at least in a subgroup of patients with a specific biomarker signature, the more confidently we can suggest, and further explore, seno-therapeutic interventions for these two diseases.",

That study will also investigate aging-and senescence-related outcomes, and as such it can be seen as a test of a cautious yet potentially very effective approach to primary prevention; if the diagnostic biomarkers we find in the SASKit study relate to cellular senescence, this observation would constitute further evidence for (cautious) seno-interventions, moving towards a kind of universal approach of disease prevention by tackling fundamental aging-related processes (see Boxes 1 and 2). Secondary prevention, aiming to reduce the impact of a disease that has already occurred, can ultimately be supported by the SASKit study, if we can demonstrate, and (in follow up studies) confirm, a distinctive role of cellular senescence (and/or other aging-related processes such as inflammation/inflammaging 125 ) in disease deterioration as defined here. Finally, evidence for tertiary prevention by seno-therapeutic intervention, aiming to attenuate the impact of an ongoing disease, is also an option based on how accurate, relevant and specific our biomarkers will be.",
