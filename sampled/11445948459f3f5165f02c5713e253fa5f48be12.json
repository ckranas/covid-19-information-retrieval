The unique features of MOFs, such as their permanent porosity, high surface area, and structural flexibility, continue to draw industrial interest outside the traditional MOF field, both to solve existing challenges and to create new businesses. In this context, diverse research has been directed toward commercializing MOFs, but such studies have been performed according to a variety of individual goals. Therefore, there have been limited opportunities to share the challenges, goals, and findings with most of the MOF field. In this review, we examine the issues and demands for MOF commercialization and investigate recent advances in MOF process engineering and applications. Specifically, we discuss the criteria for MOF commercialization from the views of stability, producibility, regulations, and production cost. This review covers progress in the mass production and formation of MOFs along with future applications that are not currently well known but have high potential for new areas of MOF commercialization.",

Excellent progress has been made in MOF synthesis, structure, chemistry, properties, and applications on the fundamental level [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , but challenges remain both in the development of engineering processes and exploring game-changing applications on the industrial level. Recently, many research groups have focused on the development of MOF manufacturing, activation, shaping, and dispersion processes, and various startup and global companies have increased their efforts toward the development of MOFs for new business areas. However, these developments in engineering and industrial processes typically arise from studies performed according to the specific demands and goals of the individual projects. Therefore, the challenges and findings are difficult to share with researchers across various MOFrelated fields.",

We also explore recent advances in processes for the scaled-up synthesis, product recovery, activation, drying, shaping, and dispersion of MOFs. Furthermore, we investigate possible future applications that are not currently well known but have significant potential to serve as new business areas for MOF commercialization. In this regard, we focus on purification, biological toxicant removal, antibacterial implementation, ion transport for solid-state electrolytes (SSEs), electrode materials, low-kappa dielectric materials, and sensors. We believe that this review will enhance the understanding of recent progress and future demands for MOF commercialization.",

Second, syntheses for the mass production of many MOFs have not yet been established [19] [20] [21] [22] .

However, many MOFs, especially those based on Zn, decompose easily from humidity and chemicals. Other MOFs synthesized through hydrothermal reactions have been reported to have better stabilities but are still below the necessary specifications [25, 26] . Many studies have suggested potential MOF applications in various devices and appliances. Adapting MOFs to such industrial applications places key emphasis on the lifetime of the components. The acceleration test is the standard method to judge the lifetime of a module or set and is usually performed under 85\u00b0C/85% humidity or 120\u00b0C steam conditions to shorten the test period. Unfortunately, most MOFs lose their properties under these conditions because of their lack of aqueous acid/base stability. There is a pioneer reference mentioning the steam stabilities of MOFs [27] . Steam stability was investigated through experimental and calculated observations on 10 types of MOF consisting of Zn, Cu, Cr and Al metal source. It demonstrates that the bonding strength of metal oxide and linker is the most important factor of steam stability. Zr/Hf/Al-based MOFs and zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) have been demonstrated as capable of passing the standard acceleration test, and an interesting method has also been reported for fortifying the hydrothermal stability of MOFs [15] . For example, the HKUST-1 consists of three different sized cages and these cages form a ship-in-a-bottle complex that is preventing access to reactants and improving stability.",

Approximately 70,000 MOFs have been reported [28] , but their typical synthetic schemes are designed to yield <1 g per batch to achieve high-quality crystallinity. Crystallization is highly sensitive to many factors such as reaction temperature, heating rate, ligand/metal ion concentration, the empty space of the reaction vessel, and even the roughness of the reactor surface. Therefore, the crystallization process is one of the factors hindering the producibility of MOFs. Sometimes, a synthetic scheme must be completely modified to increase the reaction volume. There are also several reaction types that are not conducive to a largevolume scale such as vapor/base diffusion, solvent layering, and solvent evaporation because of their limited reaction volumes. Thus far, solvothermal/hydrothermal/mechanochemical reactions have been regarded as appropriate for the mass production of MOFs.",

Room-temperature (RT) or mild heating (below the solvent boiling points) is highly recommended to enhance the producibility of manufacturing processes.

A target cost for MOFs of 15 USD kg \u00c01 has been reported [40] , toward which several approaches have been suggested. First, the solvent must be collected and reused several times. DMF is used in the synthesis of MOF-5 and UiO-66 and accounts for 78.6% and 71.7%, respectively, of the material costs. Solvent recycling is the most important factor for cost-saving with MOF synthesis. Solvent recovery systems are usually installed in petrochemical factories. Another approach is to use water as a solvent, as is the case for Ni-MOF-74, where the water solvent accounts for only 1% of the material cost. However, water-based syntheses require high-pressure reaction vessels, which are difficult to adapt to large-scale production. The third method is mechanochemical synthesis, which requires only a small amount of solvent compared with solvo/hydrothermal reactions. The mechanochemical synthesis of a MOF was first reported in 2006 [45] and has since been used to synthesis several MOFs such as COF [46] [47] [48] , MOF-5 [49] , ZIF-8 [50] [51] [52] , MIL-53 [53] , MIL-101 [54] . However, no mechanochemical syntheses for Zr-based MOFs have been established. UiO-66 MOFs with functional groups (amine, fluoride) have been reported, but pristine UiO-66 still requires a solvothermal method.

One factor determining the metal selection is its solubility in the reaction solvent. MOF synthesis is highly similar to crystallization, and thus solubility is critical for obtaining high-quality products. Metal nitrates, acetates, and sulfonates are popular choices in many studies because they are highly soluble in the typical solvents employed in MOF syntheses, such as DMF, alcohol, and water. Halides are another common choice, especially for UiO MOFs, whereas oxides are perhaps the least common because of their poor solubility in many solvents. Nitrates, acetates, and sulfates remain as anions in the solution after the reaction, leading to higher costs for waste chemical deposition and limiting the recycling of used solvents. Halide metal sources have the additional disadvantage of producing HCl gas from some metal ions (for example, ZrCl 4 ) when dissolved in DMF. This necessitates an acid-resistant coating on the walls of the reactor or changing to a higher quality reactor material such as stainless steel.",

Their characteristics and applications have been widely studied, and now it is time to move forward with their practical mass production and application. MOF synthesis requires chemical components such as organic ligands, metal ions, solvents, and modulators, as well as thermal energy and pressure conditions. Research on the academic level has yielded diverse MOFs and synthetic techniques on the gram scale. However, the units required for commercial usage are tons and kilograms, which necessitate entirely new synthetic procedures for mass production. In this context, the areas of concern are the chemical costs, reaction vessel efficiency, reaction yields, reproducible quality, environmental regulations, and mild conditions for safety. In general and lab-scale MOF synthetic procedures, the organic ligands and metal precursors are chemically combined in organic solvents to afford powder products, which are then recovered from the reaction solution. Finally, the product is activated to afford empty pores in the resulting MOFs. This section will discuss how to produce MOFs on a large scale and what kinds of procedures have been chosen for industrial-scale production. The scaling methods are divided into static and continuous processes, and we will introduce various synthetic strategies and methods for each. ",

A majority of static processes employ solvents to mediate the reaction between the organic ligands and metal ions. Considering environmental regulations and cost concerns, it is desirable to develop more solvent-free synthetic systems, but the common synthetic procedures still rely on solvent-based systems. Depending on the equipment and energy source, solvent syntheses can be divided into ambient temperature (RT) and ambient pressure (1 atm), high-temperature (>RT) and ambient pressure (1 atm), high-temperature (>RT) and high pressure (>1 atm), microwave heating, sonochemical, and electrochemical syntheses. Solvent-free processes are mainly mechanochemical, typically via grinding or ball-milling. In the next section, these methods will be introduced and discussed in terms of their pros and cons with representative cases.",

In solvent-based static syntheses, MOFs are synthesized by adding energy to the solvent in which the organic ligands and metal precursors are dissolved in a fixed vessel. Because solvent-based static syntheses are the most common in the traditional academic community, a database of MOF syntheses for various conditions has accumulated, allowing for easy access to scaled-up syntheses by expanding the reactor size. This type of method also facilitates diverse reaction conditions for general MOF syntheses as well as more specific conditions. However, the larger the reaction becomes, the more solvent is required. In particular, polar aprotic solvents, which are widely used in MOF synthesis due to their ability to solubilize the reactants, generally have a high boiling point and thus require a high temperature for hydrothermal synthesis. Most of these solvents are organic, such as DMF, DEF (N,N-diethylformamide), and DMA, which are environmentally regulated and expensive, accounting for 60% of the total MOF synthesis cost. In addition, the use of fixed vessels makes it difficult to automate static solvent syntheses into continuous processes.",

The organic ligands and metal salts are usually pre-activated in separate solutions, ready for vigorous nucleation upon mixing (Fig. 3a) . Ligands can be pre-activated ligand by either using a salt-like ligand [65] or deprotonating the ligand by adding a base [41, 64, 65] (Fig. 3b) . This increases the solubility of the ligand in polar solvents to improve the reactivity, and the deprotonated moiety has a pre-activated form that can immediately participate in the synthesis. As examples, MIL-53(Al) and MOF-5 were synthesized at RT using a sodium carboxylate-type pre-activated ligand (sodium terephthalate) and a general carboxylic acid-type ligand (terephthalic acid) with added NaOH, respectively [65] . In addition, with other bases, MOF-5 and ZIF-8 were synthesized by inducing ligand deprotonation with trimethylamine (TEA) [41, 64] . For the metal reagent, the reactivity depends on the type of counter anion in the metal salt. It is advantageous to use metal salts with acetate (CO 2 CH 3 \u00c0 ) as the counter anions since they exhibit faster nucleation than nitrate (NO 3 \u00c0 ), sulfate (SO 4 2\u00c0 ), and chloride (Cl \u00c0 ) salts [41, 63, 65, 66] .

The table below summarizes the conditions under which MOFs have been synthesized in short periods. First, when ZrOCl 2 was used as a metal source, nucleation occurred faster than with other metal sources like ZrCl 4 due to the influence of the counter ions [71] . Second, to promote the nucleation of Zr-MOFs, He at al. introduced water to accelerate the hydrolysis of the metal salt and deprotonation of the ligands. Additionally, acetic acid was used as a modulator to control the reactivity because a fast reaction results in poor crystallinity of the grown MOF.

Synthetic conditions for this traditional process have been well established for most types of MOFs, making their customization straightforward through modification of the underlying conditions. When the reaction temperature is above the boiling point of the solvent, the autogenous pressure generated by the solvent vapor also affects the synthesis. Therefore, it is necessary to use heat-and pressure-resistant vessels. A high temperature and autogenous pressure enhance the solubility to the point where even reactants that are insoluble in a specific medium (e.g., organic ligands in water) can be used, which can expand the options for combinations of solvents and reactants. In general, Teflon-sealed glass vials can be used for low vapor pressures near the boiling point, but digestion bombs (Teflon-lined autoclave reactor, high-pressure digestion tank) are necessary for harsh conditions such as high temperatures and pressures for longterm reactions (Fig. 3f) . To apply such a container to mass synthesis, a large-capacity pressure vessel can be manufactured and employed like that reported previously [75] (Fig. 3g) . These traditional heating methods can be largely divided into hydrothermal and solvothermal approaches, which use water and organic solvents, respectively. Hydrothermal methods are advantageous in terms of environmental regulations and solvents when scaled to industrial production, which require a large amount of solvent due to the usage of water. While ionic precur- [75] . Solvothermal synthesis mainly employs polar solvents (DMF, DEF, DMSO, alcohols, etc.) that dissolve the inorganic precursors, where the solvent selection affects the precursor reactivity and crystal growth. In this case, the temperature in the reactor is usually 100-240\u00b0C. With a solvent that does not dissolve the ligand or metal source well, the reaction should be carried out at higher pressures and temperatures to improve the solubility. Therefore, proper solvent selection is important for large-scale syntheses. Another option for solvent selection is ionic thermal synthesis using an ionic liquid, which gives a temperature above the melting point of the salt and rarely generates pressure from the solvent or reactant.",

The molecular movement of the solvent produces heat, which disperses as the molecules collide. Microwave heating synthesis is energy efficient because it only transfers energy inside the reaction solution. Conventional heating methods first heat the surface of the vessel to add heat energy, but microwave synthesis produces heat directly throughout the material (Fig. 4a) . Therefore, uniform heat transfer occurs inside the vessel within a short time (a few seconds to hours), resulting in rapid nucleation and enabling the easy synthesis of small, uniformly sized MOF particles. The power level, temperature, and reaction time of the microwave irradiation can be adjusted to control the MOF size and characteristics. Although the synthesis time is short, solvent evaporation makes pressure control difficult and requires the use of a pressure vessel.",

This method was first introduced by a BASF patent in 2005, which detailed the synthesis of HKUST-1 (Cu-BTC) in thin layers via Cu plate electrodes (Fig. 5c ) [102] . Despite being a static synthesis, this method allows for continuous production as long as reactants are present. In addition, electrochemical syntheses have the significant advantages of mild conditions and short reaction times compared with hydrothermal synthesis. The MOF is synthesized by a reaction between the electrode and precursor, which is controlled by adjusting the current and voltage. Electrochemical syntheses can be classified into anodic dissolution and cathodic deposition, which produce a MOF film on the electrode (Fig. 5 ) [103] . The mechanism of anodic dissolution consists of four phases: initial nucleation, growth of islands, intergrowth, and detachment. As the metal ions are released from the electrode into the ligand solution, nucleation initiates at defects on the metal substrate. Nuclei continue to grow next to the initial nuclei, forming intergrown MOF islands. This has been confirmed not only for Cu-based HKUST-1 but also for Zn and Febased MOFs [103] [104] [105] . After the MOF film is formed, the metal ions dissolved from the metal substrate pass through the MOF layer to continuously synthesize the MOF at the MOF-solution interface. As a result, a void forms between the first MOF layer and the metal substrate, which separates the two. This method requires time for MOF electrodeposition, which depends on the current, and the size of the crystal depends on the reaction time and solvent. In addition, the use of metal anodes limits the MOFs that can be synthesized depending on the type of metal selected. Additionally, in terms of the reaction solvent, it should be noted that an aqueous solvent can generate hydrogen in the cathode.",

The cathodic deposition mechanism consists of three steps: nucleation of dispersed nuclei, formation of crystal islands, and intergrowth [103, 106] .

Using electrochemistry, MOFs can be synthesized continuously in a short time at RT and atmospheric pressure. In particular, anodic dissolution is advantageous in that no counter ion waste is generated from the metal precursor. Comparing metal materials in terms of cost efficiency, anodic dissolution uses a metal substrate, whereas cathodic deposition uses metal ions, making the latter reaction easier and cheaper. However, in terms of reaction solvents and electrolytic baths, the cathodic method requires expensive solvents such as DMF, and the bath has a short lifetime of several days. The anodic method, on the other hand, is more suitable for long-term and large-scale syntheses due to the inexpensive solvents like alcohol and long lifetime of the bath [103] . In electrochemical synthesis, MOFs are synthesized by coating on the elec- trode, and thus it is difficult to produce uniformly sized particles since they are aggregated rather than separated. Thus far, electrochemical methods have yet to be applied to many MOFs, and most research has been aimed at MOF film coating. Electrochemical syntheses are more suitable for producing large-area MOF films (Table 7) .",

Typically, in academic research, the reactants are ground by a mortar and pestle (Fig. 6a ) or ballmilled (Fig. 6b, c) . The mechanical force breaks the intramolecular bonds, and new bonds form between the metal and ligands to drive MOF formation. Since this is a quantitative reaction, the proportion of metal to ligand is an important element affecting the reaction yield and efficiency. Additionally, a catalytic amount of liquid or ionic material (salts) can be employed to accelerate the reaction, also called liquid-assisted grinding or ion-assisted grinding, respectively. The small amount of solvent increases the mobility of the reagent [112] , and anionic salts induce templating effects [113] . Kimakow et al. synthesized the Cu-based MOFs HKUST-1 and MOF-14 by ball-milling with copper acetate. The surface area of HKUST-1 was low at 758 m 2 g \u00c01 without activation but increased to 1713 m 2 g \u00c01 after EtOH washing. This was caused by the byproduct, acetic acid, blocking the product pores [112] . Thus, a washing process is required to remove any byproducts other than water.",

Furthermore, mechanochemical synthesis can be applied to a stoichiometric ratio of mixed distinct metal components to synthesize mixed-metal MOFs by milling [115] . However, if the byproducts also react under the employed conditions, a solvent may be necessary, as is the case for pore activation by solvent exchange. For mass production, the grinding operation is simple and cost-effective. In particular, solvent-free methods reduce the cost of solvents and environmental regulations. However, the worn metallic impurities from ball milling equipment are the main drawback of this method for certain applications [116] (Table 8 ).",

Static syntheses use one large reactor, which is not suitable for mass production by repeated synthesis and recovery processes. This section introduces continuous flow systems capable of continuous synthesis, recovery, and wash steps, where the ligands and metal precursors are synthesized into MOFs as they enter the reactor. With a constant pump pressure, the reagents are continuously supplied to the reactor, and the product is sent out. Finally, flow systems can be managed with a computer program, and it is possible to maintain uniform synthesis conditions by checking and adjusting the temperature and flow rate at different points. In addition, continuous processes can result in improved MOF reproducibility because the continuous reaction maintains the same synthetic conditions. Continuous processes can be classified as solvent-based or mechanical depending on the use or lack of a solvent, respectively, as a reaction medium. We take a closer look in the following subsections.",

The static heating syntheses described in Section 3.1.1 involve expanding the laboratory-scale synthetic methods to a large-scale reactor. At this time, the use of a large amount of solvent causes environmental and cost problems, and larger containers have lower surface-tovolume ratios and thus poor reactivity. On the other hand, flow heating systems are optimal for industrial production with their high surface-to-volume ratios, which improve the mass and heat transfer, reaction efficiency, and reaction rate. Such flow systems are commercially available and have been studied for the synthesis of various materials, such as quantum dots, metal nanoparticles, and metal oxides [120] (Fig. 7) . Therefore, flow systems are an effective approach that can be easily applied to industrial production. As shown in Fig. 8a , in flow heating synthesis, the metal and ligand precursors are transported by a pump to be mixed in a reactor and receive energy to synthesize MOFs. Immediately afterward, the reaction is stopped by the cooling system to obtain MOFs with a uniform and controlled shape. Then, the as-synthesized MOFs are moved to a constant pressure by a back pressure regulator (BPR), which solves the tube clogging problem caused by MOF powders. This type of system is eco-friendly and cost-efficient because it expends a small amount of solvent and reuses the separated solvent through recovery. In addition, the activated final product can be manufactured by simultaneously performing the synthesis, recovery, and washing steps. The reactors can be divided into 5 types depending on their shape and the manner of mixing of the ligand and metal source (Fig. 8b) : column, counter-current mixing, continuous stirred tank, tubular flow, and microfluidic reactors. Additionally, various types of energy sources can be applied to the reaction by irradiating with microwaves and ultrasound in addition to heat.",

This is the simplest reactor with no mixing device, where the reactants are instead blended by the flow rate ( Fig. 9 ). Kim et al. obtained HKUST-1 at 2.04 g h \u00c01 with a column reactor, where the size and crystal phase of the MOF were controlled by adjusting the EtOH/water ratio of the metal source and the reaction temperature (Fig. 9a) [121] . Bayliss et al. prepared a metal, ligand, and hydrothermal line to synthesize MIL-53(Al) [122] , where the reagent line with an aqueous solution at RT met the hydrothermal line in a column reactor (Fig. 9b) . However, since terephthalic acid (H 2 BDC) as an organic ligand is not soluble in cold water, disodium terephthalate (Na 2 BDC) was used instead as a soluble salt. Importantly, this study established a system capable of simultaneous synthesis and recovery, which is the goal of industrial production. After the reaction, it was possible to perform continuous recovery in the flow system by a filter replacement method through two divided filter lines. The filtered MOF product was transferred to a critical EtOH extraction reactor for pore activation, which demonstrates the possibility of extending flow heating synthesis to the washing process. This system achieved 500 g of MIL-53(Al) in 4 h with an STY of 1300 kg m \u00c03 d \u00c01 . The surface areas of HKUST-1 and MIL-32(Al) synthesized through this column reactor were 1673 and 1010 m 2 g \u00c01 , respectively, which are higher than those of the same MOFs synthesized by static solvent methods. This illustrates that the porous properties of MOFs are properly maintained when mass-produced.",

The size and surface area of the MOF were controlled by optimizing the temperature of the reactor and the concentration of the metal source. In a subsequent work, ZIF-8 was synthesized using an organic ligand and base solution as the pre-heated downward stream and metal solution (RT) as the upward stream [124] . The synthesized MOF was then transferred to a coil in a water bath by BPR, and pore activation was performed by heating and sonication to manage the surface area.

After optimizing the synthetic conditions for the mesoscale reactor, 4533 kg m \u00c03 d \u00c01 STY of HKUST-1 was ultimately synthesized with a macroscale reactor. The second strategy for controlling the reaction parameters is to maximize the reactor volume by adjusting the diameter of the tube within a range that does not increase the surface-to-volume ratio (Fig. 11b) . The degree of reactant mixing in the reactor tube is an important factor, where more uniform mixing results in greater mass and heat transfer to the reactor wall and thus improves the yield. This degree of mixing, or homogeneity, is related to the fluid flow dynamics of the stream. The reaction surface area decreases as the tube diameter increases, but this can be attenuated by increasing the mixing degree of the solution, as turbulent flow prevails over laminar flow. One study showed that upon increasing the reactor diameter (volume) from 1 mm (10 mL) to 10.9 mm (1394 mL), the STY increased from 81,120 to 97,159 kg m \u00c03 d \u00c01 without any significant changes in the MOF properties ( Fig. 11c ) [128] . It is necessary to determine an appropriate tubular diameter to increase the reaction volume as much as possible while maintaining the yield. Finally, to expand the reaction capacity for mass synthesis, length and diameter adjustments must be performed through the simultaneous series connection of reactors.",

On the laboratory scale, Buchner funnels and filter paper are used to separate solid products from reaction solutions. For scaling, the simplest approach is to enlarge the laboratory scale by bulk filtering on a larger scale. This type of filter system can separate approximately 10-50 L of solution at once. Although this simple system is capable of solid-liquid separation at a low cost, continuous production is impossible because the filter must be replaced after separating a certain amount of product. Therefore, it is suitable for use in the laboratory on a small test amount before proceeding to mass synthesis. Nutsche filtration operates on the same principle as basic vacuum filtration but is suitable for industrial production as a continuous method capable of simultaneous washing, drying, and filtration (Fig. 15a ). An automatic system charges and then filters the sample in the chamber. Thereafter, fresh solution is sprayed on the sample cake, and washing is performed through a re-slurry process. The wet cake is obtained again through a filter process, and then the sample is dried by vacuum or convection in the chamber. Finally, the dried product is discharged from the bottom by rotating the agitator. This approach is excellent for producing high-quality products with recovery and refinement occurring at the same time. There are various system options and capacities depending on the usage and portions, from experimental laboratory scale to industrial scale (19-15,000 L) [142] . Continuous vacuum systems Continuous vacuum filtration involves the automated continuous filtration of a uniform amount of sample, unlike batch systems. Continuous vacuum filtration systems are either belt type or rotary drum type, where the same basic principle of filtering a solid using a filter applies to both. For belt-type systems, the sample is placed on a filter cloth that rotates along rollers, causing a cake to form on the belt by an internal vacuum (Fig. 15b) . Washing can also be performed while the belt is moving. The cake is separated downward when the filter passes through the last flat section of the belt, and then the system is reused by washing the filter cloth.",

As shown in Fig. 16a , the sludge is introduced between two tension filter clothes with rollers outside of each filter. The cloths are continu-ously pressed between small-diameter rotating rollers. The pressed solid cake is discharged as the cloth moves, and the filtered liquid is separated through the cloth filter. The used filter can be reused after discharging the cake by spray washing. Belt press systems can typically be applied to solids with particle sizes of 1-200 lm and feed concentrations of 0.2-30% w/w. The maximum feed flow rate according to the guidelines is 10-15 m 3 h \u00c01 for each meter of the filter width, which is almost the same as loading 850 kg h \u00c01 m \u00c01 of solid [143] . In addition, belt presses exert a very high force on the solids between the filters, which can produce a solid filter cake even for cases where this would not be possible with other filtration methods. Belt press filtration is highly effective due to the high throughput and appropriate particle size range for MOFs. However, it requires a long, strong filter cloth that is expensive to replace.",

Typically, the screw filtration system is equipped with a helical screw rotating at 2 rpm inside a cylinder-shaped perforated cage. The slurry introduced into the closed end is moved to the opposite side by the rotating screw. As the volume between the barrels of the screw gradually decreases, pressures up to 40,000 kPa occur. The solid cake is compressed and discharged in the opposite direction, and the separated liquid passes through the porous cage. Screw pressing for continuous filtration is based on a high pressure and can separate 1-200 lm particles in a feed concentration range of 10-80% w/w. There are different sizes and types of equipment depending on the required processes, and the processing capacity depends on the material type and length and diameter of the system. A high-capacity unit with a length of 8 m and diameter of 1 m can handle one ton of solids per hour [144].

A large-capacity centrifuge operates on the same principle as a lab-scale centrifuge (Fig. 17 ). There must be a density difference between the solid and liquid to be separated, and the denser solid precipitates on the wall and is separated from the solvent by a centrifugal force. The separation efficiency depends on the type of solvent, amount of solid, rotational speed, and residence time, where increasing the speed and time also increases the efficiency. Whereas filtration requires the hassle of selecting a filter type according to the particle size and concentration and replacing the consumable filter, centrifugation separates various particles more effectively by controlling the operating conditions. Although there are several types of industrial centrifuges, disc stack centrifuges are notable in that they can be operated in both batch mode and continuous mode and can handle large volumes. When solid products build up on the wall, a valve automatically or manually opens to release the product, and the accumulating step repeats. Disc stack centrifuges exert centrifugal forces exceeding 14,000 g and rotational speeds of 3000-10,000 rpm. They are useful for obtaining various sizes of particles from 0.1 to 200 lm, which can be recovered even at low solid concentrations (>25%), making centrifugation an effective way to separate MOFs from solutions.",

High-frequency ultrasound is generated by placing a dispersion solution between the transducer (sound source) and reflector (Fig. 18a, b) . The ultrasonic standing waves concentrate individual particles at the acoustic pressure nodes or antinodes, and thus the particles migrate closer together and aggregate, even coagulate and coalesce (Fig. 18c ). If the MOF is small (nanometers to a few micrometers) or present at a low concentration in solution after the reaction, directly using a conventional filter or centrifuge may be inefficient. Therefore, the processing cost and time can be reduced by performing ultrasonic separation in parallel. Ultrasonic separation can separate solids from dispersions without chemical or physical effects, and in the case of porous structures such as MOFs, activation of the inner pores can be performed simultaneously. In an example of applying ultrasonic separation to MOFs, Al-Fum and MIL-53 were separated in 10 min via 2 MHz sonication in a 1 L chamber (Fig. 18d ) [145, 146] . Compared with centrifugation, sonication had a 3% lower yield, but the surface areas were improved by 21% and 47% for Al-Fum and MIL-53, respectively.",

However, any solvents, unreacted substances, and counter ions that have not been completely removed from the inner pores will reduce the porous properties such as the surface area. In addition, since MOFs are generally synthesized in solvents with high boiling points, structural collapse and incomplete activation can occur due to high capillary forces and surface tension during evaporation. Solvent exchange to address these issues proceeds in two stages: guest exchange and guest evacuation (Fig. 19 ). When the MOF is washed with volatile solutions having low boiling points, the washing solvent exchanges with the reaction solvent in the pores. This is a common method for pore activation and has been proven effective in many studies [75, 102] . In some cases, an additional chemical treatment is performed to remove specific reactants. Although pore activation processes such as solvent exchange are not essential for MOF production, their use can greatly reduce the total amount of energy input to remove the reaction solvent. Such processes should be performed when counterions that do not evaporate must be removed. ",

During washing with rotation, the solid products and solvent are blended homogeneously, allowing for efficient solvent exchange. Additionally, other filtration methods such as belt and rotary systems can be performed for simultaneous recovery and washing when forming a cake by vacuum. Because of the short contact time between the fresh solvent and cake, it is not easy to exchange the solvent in the pores, but the method is appropriate for removing unreacted substances and solvents from the product surface. There are various combinations of residence times and solvent types, which depend on the MOF type and synthetic conditions. To optimize the process, the rates of substitution and surface area enhancement should be determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and sorption analysis.",

In contrast, Soxhlet extraction employs a closed batch system consisting of a sample contained in a cup (filter), condenser, distillation flask, and heat source (Fig. 20) . As the evaporated solution condenses, the warm solvent drops onto the sample for solvent exchange, and then the solvent is re-evaporated. Therefore, Soxhlet extraction has the significant advantage of reusing a limited amount of solvent through an automatic system. This method has commonly been used for MOF solvent exchange (Mg-MOF-74, Mg-MOF-174, Mg-MOF-184, MIL-100, etc.) [73, 76] on the laboratory scale, but it is expected to also be capable of processing a large amount of MOFs with an industrial extractor.

The product is continuously transferred to the dryer by a conveyor, and hot air is forced through the bed (Fig. 21b) . Vacuum belt conveyor dryers are expected to be more suitable for heat-sensitive products and effective pore activation. The inside of the closed chamber is kept under vacuum, and samples are continuously introduced and dried on the conveyor. In such conveyor systems, the drying yield depends on the size of the equipment and the heating area, but equipment with a water vapor capacity of 210-230 kg h \u00c01 can yield up to 500-800 kg h \u00c01 of dry powder [151] . The drying rate depends on the condition and type of material, where a continuous conveyor system can process approximately 10-50 kg m \u00c02 h \u00c01 [152] . To enhance the product drying capacity, stages can be connected to increase the drying rate, retention time, loading amount, as shown in Fig. 21b . In addition, crushing of the agglomerated product after drying can be carried out continuously, which simplifies the process. This type of conveyor system is used for drying chemical products, pharmaceutical products, baking mixes, baby food, etc.",

The fluid is sprayed through a nozzle, and the expelled droplets encounter the hot medium immediately (Fig. 22a) . Spray drying causes rapid evaporation and maintains the droplets at a low temperature, and thus the product is not affected by heat [150] . In addition, spray drying requires a very short process time compared with other dryers and is mainly used for processing pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, inorganic chemicals, dairy products, food, and ceramic powders. This type of equipment is not only excellent for drying heatsensitive samples but also allows for control of the product properties such as particle size, shape, and morphology and can be applied to nanosized particles. In addition, spray drying is also suit-able for the mass production of MOF nanopowders because it can be performed continuously in connection with a previous stage, and uniformly sized particles with a high reproducibility can be produced by controlling the spraying conditions. In addition, products can be dried in the form of microcapsules according to the spraying conditions (Fig. 22b) . Spray dryers have evaporation capacities from a few kilograms per hour to 50 tons h \u00c01 or more [152] . As detailed in a 2006 BASF patent, 12.64 kg of Al-MOF was sprayed and dried using a conical laboratory fluidized-bed dryer, and the surface area of 1333 m 2 h \u00c01 of the resulting product was slightly higher than that of the same MOF dried in a convection oven [68] . There are many advantages to spray-drying MOFs, but the high initial installation cost and low thermal efficiency must also be taken into account.",

Since this is not a direct heating method, it is advantageous for heatsensitive products. Particularly, when drying porous materials such as MOFs, freeze-drying is effective for minimizing structural collapse and obtaining a high surface area. However, due to the long drying times and vacuum process, it is only suitable for the production of expensive, high-quality materials. In particular, the most common freeze-drying system is the tray batch type, which is mainly used for food, but only 2-20 kg can be processed at one time. A multi-batch freeze dryer or tunnel freeze dryer can be used to increase the throughput. Additionally, combining spray-and freeze-drying is excellent for producing uniform products of a certain size continuously. In a previous study on a Cu-MOF composed of tetracarboxylic acid, the surface area was increased by 3 times (1725 m 2 g \u00c01 ) compared with the vacuumdried MOF (582 m 2 g \u00c01 ) [153] .

Young's modulus indicates the mechanical stiffness of a solid material and is defined by the relationship between stress (force per unit area) and strain (proportional deformation). The value corresponds to the maximum tensile strength before fracture and thus gives a mechanical guideline for process engineers. This value is not related to geometric shapes but instead to the material composition and shaping process conditions. Attrition tests include both dropping and abrasion analyses. For the dropping test, multiple samples from different batches are dropped from a specific height, and the number of samples that maintain their original shape without breaking into fine particles is counted. Alternatively, a sample is repeatedly dropped from a specific height, and the number of times it can be dropped while maintaining its shape is recorded. For the abrasion test, samples are repeatedly rolled in a rotating container at a specific rotational speed, and the number of samples maintaining their original shape without breaking into fine MOF particles is counted. These methods are suitable for comparing samples measured under the same conditions, but the results cannot be directly compared with reported values measured under different conditions.",

Typically, polymer binders are the first choice for MOF shaping because i) they are easy to dissolve in volatile dispersion media, making mixing and drying of the MOF powder relatively simple; ii) they have various chemical bonding groups, and thus the degree of interaction between the chemical functionalities and dangling components of the MOF particles can be controlled; iii) there are many precedents for the use of polymers as binders with other classes of porous materials, such as activated carbon and zeolites, which increases the probability of shaping success; and iv) compared with inorganic binders, organic binders have relatively low weights, and thus the weight of the binder required for shaping is low, which is advantageous in terms of performance per unit weight. On the other hand, there are also disadvantages to the use of polymer binders: i) there is a relatively high possibility of reducing the surface area due to insertion of the polymer binder into the MOF pores; ii) use of an improper polymer can coat the MOF surface and block the pores; and iii) the chemical functionalities of the polymer binder can influence the chemical characteristics of the MOF, which can unexpectedly change or deteriorate the target properties.

This effect is used to determine whether a mixture is a colloid, as no scattering occurs when light passes through a true solution. Light scattering occurs in a colloidal dispersion because visible light is reflected off of particles that are slightly below or near the size of the wavelength of light, such as the scattered particles in a colloid-like substance (e.g., dust in water). Depending on how much light a particular material absorbs, different color light is emitted. Shorter wavelengths of light tend to be scattered more than longer wavelengths. It is easy to judge how well MOF particles are dispersed in a medium by taking photos of various solution conditions or by using laser beams to see how evenly the light is transmitted through the suspension or colloid.",

To maintain the quality of our air, novel materials are required that can purify the air and reestablish a healthy atmosphere. Although several important review articles have highlighted the development of advanced purification filters, in many cases the filters are limited to the removal of only a few major air contaminants [209] [210] [211] [212] [213] . In this section, we cover the most severe environmental air pollutants and briefly introduce the pollutants and emphasize their negative impact on the environment and public health. In addition, we discuss the recent advances in the field of MOFs for the removal of these pollutants from air. We have classified the pollutants as follows (Fig. 27) :",

Air purification filters for particulate matter are divided into two types: (1) air filtration materials for the public, such as commercially available face masks; and (2) air filtration materials at the source of emissions, such as chimneys and automobile exhausts. The main requirements for air purification filters are as follows: high filtration efficiency, good mechanical strength, high thermal stability, low resistance to air flow, relatively low pressure drop, light weight, and long working lifetime. [224] . In addition, air fil- [232] ters for use at the source of emissions should be able to endure harsh conditions such as rapid air flow, high temperatures, and high humidity [225, 226] . MOFs are promising materials for air purification filters because of their unique properties such as crystallinity, high thermal stability, large surface area, high porosity, chemical stability, and tunable functionality [227] . In particular, they are widely used as adsorption-based filters because of their high porosity and surface area [228] . However, particulate matter is usually too big to be removed by adsorption in MOF pores. Although the role of MOFs in particulate matter removal applications is not clearly proven, MOF/polymer composite filters offer better recyclability and durability for use in harsh environments.",

It is also important for adsorption to occur without interference from atmospheric gases; that is, the MOFs must have high selectivity toward the target gas. In this regard, it is important to consider the adsorption mechanism to develop MOFs that can selectively capture each respective toxic gas. Several methods for endowing selectivity to MOFs have been proposed, including: (1) tuning the pore size to ensure specific adsorbate gases are captured by size discrimination; and (2) incorporating a specific functionality or material for selective interaction with the toxic gas. Specific functionality can be achieved by inserting functional ligands (acidic or basic), open metal centers (coordinatively unsaturated metal sites), metal oxides, or polyoxometalates that provide specific interactions such as acid-base, electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, or p-p complexation/interactions [210, 244] . Therefore, the incorporation of organic functional linkers, specific metal coordination, and guests molecules are major considerations for developing materials that can selectively remove toxic gases. With this in mind, we explain in this section some of the various recent advances in MOF-derived materials for the adsorptive removal of toxic gases.",

The resultant MOF, denoted as MFM-601, had an improved BET surface area and displayed a higher gas adsorption capacity than the original MFM-600. MFM-601 exhibited an SO 2 adsorption uptake of 12.3 mmol g \u00c01 at 298 K and 1.0 bar, in preference to CO 2 and N 2 . The selectivity toward SO 2 was investigated, and it was revealed that the dipole moment of SO 2 leads to intermolecular interactions with the hydroxyl groups of the Zr 6 nodes, resulting in the stable binding of SO 2 in the MOF pores (Fig. 31a, b) . This unprecedented MOF is important due to its high SO 2 selectivity over other gases (CO 2 and N 2 ), as well as its reversible adsorption properties. Table 17 summarizes these and some further examples of metal-carboxylate MOFs for SO 2 removal. A few metal-azolate MOFs have also been explored for the adsorptive removal of SO 2 . In 2017, a new strategy was reported for the selective capture of SO 2 from flue gas [252] . Extraframework Ba 2+ ions were introduced into the defect sites of an Ni-based pyrazolate MOF via an ion-exchange process. Moreover, breakthrough dynamic adsorption experiments and computational studies revealed that the Ba 2+ -exchanged framework was a key factor in the adsorption of SO 2 , as the SO 2 uptake was considerably higher than that of the parent Ni-MOF and K + -exchanged MOFs (Table 17 ). This finding allowed the researchers to propose an adsorption mechanism for SO 2 fixation (Fig. 31c, d) . The comparatively low reactivity of a barium hydroxide co-crystal toward SO 2 illustrates the importance of having many accessible and disperse adsorptive sites in defect-engineered Ni-MOFs. Hence, this exceptional result provides a new platform for the development of novel metal-azolate MOFs.",

            "text": "To date, only a few fibrous MOF membranes have been explored for the selective capture of SO 2 under dynamic adsorption conditions. However, the results thus far have been promising. Fibrous MOF membranes or thin films have incredible advantages over solid-state crystalline MOF materials, and can resolve many critical problems such as clogging of pipes and recycling issues. In 2016, Wang and coworkers focused on the fabrication of MOF filters by embedding MOF crystals into polymers through electrospinning [233] . Although there have been several reports on the fabrication of MOF films by electrospinning, systematic investigations are required to give deeper understanding of how to tune the morphology and modify the surface functionality. Analyzing the compatibility of different polymers and MOFs is also important for the development of efficient filters for the capture of SO 2 and particulate matter. The MOF/PAN filters developed by Wang and coworkers [233] , denoted as UiO-66-NH 2 /PAN and MOF-199/PAN, showed dynamic SO 2 adsorption capacities of 0.019 and 0.014 g g \u00c01 , respectively. These filters exhibited very low flow gas resistance and an exceptionally low pressure drop (20 Pa at an air flow rate of 50 mL min \u00c01 ). In addition, the UiO-66-NH 2 / PAN filter showed excellent durability, and could be used several times for the removal of SO 2 . Another group reported an electrospun nanofibrous material, MIL-53(Al)-NH 2 /PAN (MGP), for the selective removal of SO 2 (Fig. 32d) [236] . Motivated by the previous results, the authors designed a novel fibrous membrane by investigating other amine-functionalized MOF networks. Importantly, the MGP composite membrane had an excellent SO 2 uptake of 0.0028 g g \u00c01 under dynamic sorption conditions. When a mixed gas was passed through the MGP filter, its SO 2 concentration dropped from 7000 to 40 ppb. These studies on nanofibrous MOF-based filters have encouraged researchers to investigate their utilization in practical and industrial applications.",

Several materials (activated carbons, graphite oxides, zeolites, etc.) have been utilized as NO 2 adsorbents, but there are typically critical limitations such as low uptake and/or irreversible NO 2 adsorption.

Furthermore, the NO 2 adsorption properties of NH 2functionalized UiO-66 have also been investigated [260] . It should be noted that NH 2 -functionalized UiO-66 exhibited very low NO generation capability (7 wt%) compared to activated carbon (28 wt%) . The MOF also showed very high NO 2 uptake capacities of 20.3 and 31.2 mmol g \u00c01 under dry and humid (80% RH) conditions, respectively. The NO 2 adsorption pathways were investigated by NMR, diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. It was found that the generation of diazonium ions at NH 2 sites, nitration of aromatic linkers, and nitrate formation at bridging oxygens of Zr 6 metal cluster nodes all contributed to NO 2 adsorption (Fig. 32c) .",

In competitive sorption measurements between benzene and water vapor, MIL(Cr)-Z1 showed a higher uptake for benzene than water. The p-p interactions of aromatic linkers with benzene and the relatively large molecular size of benzene with respect to the pores could be responsible for this selective adsorption behavior. Moreover, MIL(Cr)-Z1 gained more attention than the other reported MOF materials (e.g., MIL(Cr)-101) because of its benzene sorption capability at high humidity (60% RH).",

Embedding porous carbon in the MOF network improved the surface dispersive forces and generated more uncoordinated Cr 3+ metal sites (typically known as defect sites). Owing to these key features, the MOF composite materials displayed better performance toward the adsorption of acetone vapor.",

Comparative studies of formaldehyde adsorption by various cyclodextrin based-MOFs revealed that c-CD-MOF-K has greater formaldehyde uptake than aand b-CD-MOF-K. Interestingly, c-CD-MOF-K displayed superb capture speed (15 min) for complete adsorption (0.48 mg m \u00c03 ) of formaldehyde, whereas the other cyclodextrin based-MOFs took>1 h to reach 50% adsorption.

Owing to health and safety risks, the usage and production of CWAs is strictly prohibited according to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Unfortunately, the recent utilization and production of CWAs means that there is an immediate requirement to develop novel technologies that can neutralize or suppress their toxicity under ambient conditions [281] . Owing to the prohibition of using real CWAs for research purposes, alternative chemical compounds named CWA simulants have been produced that display very similar structural features to CWAs but with significantly lower toxicity (Fig. 34a) . This has provided enormous relief to researchers, as they can now develop relevant materials to neutralize CWAs using CWA simulants, before the conduction of tests using real CWAs by the appropriate authorities.",

Owing to the long-range order and tailored functional linkers of MOFs, their pores are large enough to confine guest entities. In this regard, Su and coworkers designed a composite with Keggin-type polyoxometalate (POM, (PW 12 O 40 ) 3\u00c0 ) and a copper-based porous MOF (PMOF) architecture (NENU-11, H 3 [(Cu 4 Cl) 3 [284] . The PMOF/POM composite was used for the efficient removal and decomposition of a CWA sarin simulant, dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP), under humid conditions. NENU-11 can adsorb 15.5 DMMP molecules per SBU, which is higher than that of HKUST-1 (8.2 molecules per SBU) and MOF-5 (6 molecules per SBU), as calculated from adsorption uptake experiments. In addition, purposely constructed NENU-3 (POM-incorporated HKUST-1) showed less uptake of DMMP (11.5 molecules per SBU) than NENU-11, which may be due to the different loadings of POM in the MOFs (Fig. 34b, c) . The exceptional DMMP adsorption performance of POM-incorporated MOFs can be explained by the hydrogen bonding interactions between the POM and DMMP molecules, and the presence of entatic metal centers in NENU-11. In addition, the Keggin-type POM in NENU-11 MOF was found to acts as an acid catalyst for the hydrolysis of DMMP simulants into methyl alcohol, as evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Finally, this material was reusable for up to 10 cycles without loss of structural integrity, which will facilitate a new era of POM-incorporated MOF materials for the sorption and decomposition of CWAs in practical applications.",

            "text": "Understanding the reaction mechanisms between CWAs and adsorbents is crucial for the development of superior MOF materials for CWA adsorption. Investigations using in-situ probe experiments are valuable for this purpose. In 2017, four Zr-derived MOFs (UiO-66, UiO-67, MOF-808, and NU-1000) were tested for the adsorptive removal and decomposition of CWA simulants under ambient conditions [285] . The highlight of this work was demonstrating the key aspects of the atomistic reaction mechanisms between MOF adsorbents and CWAs. The authors proposed a mechanism for the adsorption based on in-situ experiments using synchrotron PXRD, EXAFS (Extended X-ray absorption fine structure), and DRIFTS-IR analysis. Although DMMP adsorption occurred in the pores of the selected MOFs, desorption occurred in the UiO-series MOFs owing to collapse of the framework, whereas MOF-808 and NU-1000 survived with small structural changes, as characterized by in-situ PXRD analysis. Le Bail fitting of the PXRD patterns revealed expansion of the unit cell volumes for UiO-66 (1.30%, 60 min), UiO-67 (0.76%, 30 min), MOF-808 (1.33%, 60 min), and NU-1000 (1.17%, 30 min) upon exposure to DMMP for various time intervals (Fig. 35a, b) . In addition, in-situ EXAFS revealed that the Zr 6 metal-cluster is a key site for DMMP uptake, which was proven by an increase of disordered Zr-O and Zr-Zr pairs. Moreover, the presence of characteristic peaks corresponding to methyl methylphosphonate (MMP) in the DRIFTS-IR results confirmed that DMMP decomposition occurred. Timedependent DRIFTS and EXAFS experiments suggested that the decomposition of DMMP gives rise to the formation of covalently bound MMP with Zr 6 cores, with a methanol byproduct (Fig. 35c) . It should be noted that the presented MOFs showed good performance for the removal of DMMP from air as well as from various mixed gases, even in humid conditions. Therefore, in-situ probe experiments may provide greater insight for the in-depth understanding of reaction mechanisms for the future development of MOF adsorbents, and emphasize their utilization in air purification applications.",

The ''MOFwich\" had high adsorption capacities and an excellent moisture vapor transport rate (MVTR). Considering these advantages, the authors developed two mixed MOF composites (MMCs), SEBS/HKUST-1 and SEBS/UiO-66-NH 2 (named as M3), to test the permeation of CEES and MVTR. The M3 filter showed limited permeation (<0.01 mg m \u00c03 ) of CEES over 16 h exposure, whereas latex gloves of the same thickness displayed greater permeation (Fig. 36e) . M3 did not exhibit breakthrough permeation even when exposed to CEES for>40 h. However, the hydrophilicity of the MOF in M3 meant that its MVTR value (16 g m \u00c02 h \u00c01 ) was higher than that of the latex polymer. Therefore, combining the properties of M3 with common polymers such as latex may encourage the development of user-friendly protective barriers against mustard gasbased CWAs.",

The researchers investigated the effect of changing the loading of HKUST-1 (10-50 wt%) and the thickness of the film (75-150 lm) on the CEES permeation rate and MVTR. Increasing the MOF loading and thickness reduced the CEES permeation rate and increased the MVTR. Interestingly, the composite also acted as a self-indicator upon exposure to CEES to detect the toxicant. Therefore, this MOF-polymer compositing strategy is expected to support the industrial production of mustard gas protective equipment in the future.",

Uremic toxins are human metabolism products, divided into three categories: (1) water soluble (e.g., urea, uric acid, and creatinine), (2) water insoluble (e.g., peptides and leptins), and (3) proteinbound moieties (e.g., p-cresyl sulfate, indoxyl sulfate, and hippuric acid). Hemodialysis therapy has been widely used to remove or filter these toxins from human blood. Nevertheless, hemodialysis lacks filtration efficiency and has difficulties removing water insoluble toxins and protein-bound moieties. Therefore, several porous adsorbents such as activated carbons, zeolites, carbon nanotubes, and composite membranes have been investigated for the removal of uremic toxins in artificial kidney applications [293] [294] [295] . Crystalline and porous MOFs are expected to play a vital role in addressing the unresolved problems with other porous materials, and provide a competitive alternative for commercially available adsorbents in various applications.",

A comparative study with various manufactured fabric composites revealed that the prepared MOF composite showed exceptional adsorption capacities both in situ (212.8 mg g \u00c01 ) and ex situ (192. 3 mg g \u00c01 ) compared to pristine cotton (113.6 mg g \u00c01 ) (Fig. 37a, b) . In addition, the adsorption mechanism was studied, with the results suggesting that weak interactions including hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions between the active binding sites of the composite and the functional groups (N and O atoms) of creatinine, as well as physical deposition on the composite surface, were the main mechanisms of creatinine removal from artificial blood. The regenerated fabric retained 82% of its initial creatinine removal performance after three cycles. This strategy highlights the opportunities for the development of diverse composite materials for the efficient removal of uremic toxins in artificial kidney applications.",

Adsorption studies revealed that NU-1000 showed exceptionally high uptake of p-cresyl sulfate (440 mg g \u00c01 at 303 K), indoxyl sulfate (254 mg g \u00c01 at 310 K), and hippuric acid (199 mg g \u00c01 at 310 K) in comparison to other MOF adsorbents. More excitingly, the pcresyl sulfate crystals that accumulated in the NU-1000 network helped the researchers to develop an understanding of the adsorption mechanism, by utilizing single-crystal structure analysis and DFT calculations (Fig. 37c-h) . They found that the extended pconjugated systems, where hydrophobic sites were sandwiched between pyrene linkers and the hydroxyl groups of Zr 6 nodes, were responsible for the high uptake of p-cresyl sulfate. These results are promising for the future study of diverse MOF derivatives for the removal of protein-bound uremic toxins in artificial kidney applications.",

Recently, researchers have incorporated antibacterial agents into the pores of porous MOFs to bestow them with antibacterial properties. Rifampicin (RFP, antibacterial agent) and 2-nitrobenzaldehyde (o-NBA, pH jump reagent) were loaded in the pores of ZIF-8 (RFP&o-NBA@ZIF-8) for the effective treatment of in vivo and in vitro bacterial infections as well as wound infection therapy under optimal pH and ultraviolet (UV)-light irradiation [309] . Interestingly, the RFP&o-NBA@ZIF-8 material showed high activity against both gram negative (ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli, E. coli) and gram-positive bacteria (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA) at optimal conditions, as evaluated by the in vitro studies. Antibacterial activity tests demonstrated that the E. coli growth rate decreased with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 10 mg mL \u00c01 and illumination time of 120 min, whereas the MIC of MRSA was in the range of 65-131 mg mL \u00c01 . Furthermore, in vivo studies proved that the MOF material showed high antibacterial efficiency toward bacterial infections upon UV-light (365 nm) irradiation at pH = 8.5. Significantly, this MOF that degrade to generate Zn 2+ ions upon UV-light exposure, which would induce a local pH change, can be employed for the controlled release of RFP. The idea of combining MOFs with antibacterial agents inspired the development of MOFs with antibacterial activity and wound healing properties. For example, MOFs that degrade to generate Zn 2+ ions upon UV-light exposure, which would induce a local pH change, can be employed for the controlled release of RFP.",

The use of biodegradable materials with MOFs may provide a solution to this problem. Qian and coworkers reported a new biodegradable paperbased MOF composite from cellulose paper (CP), cellulose nanofiber (CNF), and Co-based ZIF (ZIF-67) (Fig. 39c) [311] . As compared to Ag + ions, the use of less toxic Co 2+ ions in ZIF-67 enables its use in antibacterial applications. The antibacterial activity of the CP/ CNF/ZIF-67 composite toward E. coli was tested. Good antibacterial activity was achieved with an antibacterial rate of 80% with an MIC of 10 mg mL \u00c01 ZIF-67, suggesting the dependency of antibacterial activity on the loading of ZIF-67 in the composite. Moreover, the cytotoxicity test revealed that ZIF-67 showed exceptional cell via- bility of~94% even at high concentrations of 80 mg mL \u00c01 compared to other characteristic MOFs (e.g., ZIF-8), which further confirmed the applicability of the CP/CNF/ZIF-67 composite for antibacterial purposes.",

The Ag@CD-MOF showed attractive antibacterial efficacy, whereas the other MOF composites showed no further enhancement against bacterial activity. The MICs of the Ag NPs for E. coli and S. aureus were 16 and 64 mg mL \u00c01 , respectively. The thick peptidoglycan layer in S. aureus (gram positive bacteria) hindered the penetration of the Ag NPs, which resulted in reduced antibacterial efficacy compared to that for E. coli. Interestingly, time-dependent bacteria growth curves revealed that increasing the concentration of Ag NPs was not favorable for improving antibacterial activity (Fig. 40b, c) . Finally, a Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (GRGDS) peptide-incorporated Ag@CD-MOF exhibited a great response for wound healing therapy, highlighting its importance in drug delivery applications.",

In these MOF compounds, the set concentration for Ag + and Zn 2+ metal ions was 21.17 mg mL \u00c01 . Among the prepared MOFs, p-MOF showed the best activity against oral bacteria, whereas MOF-5 and ZIF-8 performed moderately. Specifically, solid-phase growth curves demonstrated that the performance of these MOFs and silver nitrate (AgNO 3 ) followed the order p-MOF > AgNO 3 > MOF-5 > ZIF-8 ( Fig. 41f-h) . Hence, the authors suggested that the structural stability and metal ion content of the MOFs was key for better performance in anti-oral bacterial studies. In addition, they explained that the greater the release of specific metal ions from the MOFs, the higher the antibacterial activity.",

These types of materials may be most suited to use in biomedical applications such as wound healing bandages, antibacterial surfaces, and biofilms. In addition, the utilization of antibacterial MOFs in food technology and water treatment is still in its infancy. Any related applications should consider the potential toxicity originating from MOF composites. In this regard, future generations of MOF compounds for antibacterial purposes should be developed with biocompatible cations and less toxic ligands. The depletion of unrenewable energy resources like coal, oil, and natural gas and increasing human population have impacted the demand for energy in electricity, transportation, industry, and other purposes [317] . In addition, the combustion of fossil fuels releases toxic gases and VOCs into the atmosphere, which has led to a severe global issue with greenhouse gases. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop sustainable and renewable energy sources to solve the present energy and environmental concerns. Fuel cells and batteries/supercapacitors are highly attractive technologies for clean energy production and energy storage applica- tions, respectively [318] . Among the various types of fuel cells, proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have emerged as promising candidates for the production of clean and sustainable energy, as they combat the drawbacks of traditional engines, and release only H 2 /O 2 as byproducts. The solid electrolyte plays a crucial role in PEMFCs [319, 320] . Therefore, there is a strong need to design and develop new solid electrolyte materials that can meet stringent requirements, including: (i) high proton conductivity (r > 10 \u00c02 S cm \u00c01 ), (ii) high operation temperature (>100\u00b0C) to avoid electrode poisoning and fuel crossover; (iii) good mechanical strength and processability of solid membrane/electrolyte; (iv) chemical and thermal stability under operating conditions; (v) good compatibility, especially with the electrodes and bipolar plates; (vi) reasonable cost of bulk production; and (vii) porosity tunability or switching by external stimulus.",

For fuel cells, two main types of MOF materials have been extensively studied: water-assisted proton-conducting MOFs, and anhydrous proton-conducting MOFs. In water-assisted protonconducting MOFs, proton transformation relies on guest water molecules, whereas in anhydrous proton-conducting MOFs, proton conduction depends on the existing protons of heterocyclic compounds, organic acids, and inherent water molecules. Therefore, the majority of improvements to proton conductivity involve the introduction of acidic functional groups (e.g., -COOH, -SO 3 H, and -OH) or guest molecules (e.g., H 2 O, imidazole, and triazole) into the MOF network [323, 324] .

Battery technologies have been widely explored to deliver superior characteristics like high power density, fast charge/discharge rates, and long lifetime [327] . Most conventional batteries including Li-ion batteries (LIBs) utilize a polymer membrane saturated with an organic liquid electrolyte, which can lead to serious safety issues, such as leakage, poor chemical stability, and flammability. In practice, LIBs present several safety concerns; for example, lithium dendrite formation leads to shortcircuiting, and leakage of the organic electrolyte can cause explosions [328] . Solid-state electrolytes are therefore promising candidates to replace liquid electrolytes for practical applications. Solid-state electrolytes should meet the following requirements to provide suitable electrochemical performance: (i) high ionic conductivity (on the order of 10 \u00c03 S cm \u00c01 ); (ii) reduced electronic conductivity; (iii) single mobile ion species; (iv) high transference number; and (v) good chemical, thermal, and electrochemical stability. Over the past few decades, inorganic systems composed of ceramics, glasses, or organic polymers have been widely used as solid-state electrolytes [329] . Although inorganic solid-state electrolytes exhibit high ionic conductivity (~10 \u00c03 S cm \u00c01 ), they have numerous drawbacks including high interfacial resistance and poor processability. This has inspired research attention toward new classes of solid-state electrolytes. In this regard, MOFs have intriguing properties: tunable MOF networks can provide unique channels for single ion mobility; nano-MOF compounds provide strong electrode-electrolyte interfacial interactions that can to address mobile ion kinetics; and high ionic conductivity functional linkers can be incorporated into MOFs to improve the electrochemical performance. Hence, MOFs go some way toward meeting the requirements for solid-state electrolytes, and are expected to facilitate the development of better performance solid-state batteries in the future [330] [331] [332] [333] .",

            "text": "The tuning and modulation of both ionic conductivity and proton conductivity in crystalline MOF materials is highly attractive for addressing performance and other adverse issues of proton-conducting materials. However, such research investigations are still in their infancy. With this in mind, Yoon and coworkers presented proton conduction switching two microp-orous MOF compounds, Mg(HCO 2 ) 2 , Co(HCO 2 ) 2 , that showed a reversible crystal-to-amorphous structural transformation for switching conductivity on/off [335] . Water vapor adsorption and proton conductivity experiments demonstrated that these compounds assumed several different structural states depending on the relative humidity (Fig. 42a, b) . Detailed structural analysis proved that there were three phases: (1) an anhydrous phase, (2) a water-adsorbed phase, and (3) a water-coordinated phase. The proton conductivity of the water-coordinated phase was 1.0 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 S cm \u00c01 for Mg(HCO 2 ) 2 and 1.0 \u00c2 10 \u00c06 S cm \u00c01 for Co(HCO 2 ) 2 at 90% RH and 298 K. Interestingly, watercoordinated framework showed the crystalline-to-amorphous transition, upon which the MOFs changed from conductor to insulator, and vice versa. The dynamics of the watercoordinated phase were further analyzed by solid-state 2 H NMR spectroscopy. Although the proton conductivity was moderate, this work presents the first reversible crystal-toamorphous structure transformation by changing the RH values, which enables proton conductivity switching behavior.",

            "text": "Recently, metal-organic gels (MOGs) have emerged as alternative materials to conventional MOF materials for exceptional proton conducting performance. A recently developed Cr-based MOG (Cr/sBDC-Gel; sBDC = 2-sulfoterephthalic acid) showed higher proton conductivity than MOF pellets comprising a similar functional linker (MIL-101-SO 3 H) [336] . The Cr/sBDC-Gel-0.4 M (0.4 M represents concentration of sBDC solution) exhibited a proton conductivity of 7.84 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 S cm \u00c01 at 80\u00b0C and 100% RH, whereas that of the MIL-101-SO 3 H pellets was only 8.7 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 S cm \u00c01 . Although the MOG cannot be considered a conventional solid-state material, it is believed that this work can provide a strategy for increasing the conductivity of solid-state materials by incorporating continuous long-range proton transfer channels, such as that of this 3Dpercolated MOG network. Metal-phosphate MOFs have intriguing properties compared to their metal-carboxylate counterparts. The phosphate terminals present proton-donating and proton-accepting functionality, which can be useful for proton conduction at high temperatures or under anhydrous conditions. Levenson et al. prepared four lanthanide phosphonate frameworks with different phases (a or b) and/or different counter anions (Cl \u00c0 or Br \u00c0 ): a-PCMOF-21-Br, a-PCMOF-21-Cl, b-PCMOF-21-Br, and b-PCMOF-21-Cl (Fig. 42c ) [337] . The different phases affected the water vapor adsorption property of the materials, which had a significant effect on the proton conductivity (Fig. 42d ). In addition, the flexible nature of the a phase allowed an unusual stepped water vapor sorption isotherm with higher water vapor adsorption capacity than that of the b phase, resulting in higher conductivity. Interestingly, the removal of anions from the framework revealed that a-PCMOF-21-Br possessed higher proton conductivity (1.69 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 S cm \u00c01 ) than a-PCMOF-21-Cl at 85\u00b0C and 95% RH. It should be noted that the conductivity of most water-assisted proton conducting MOFs decreases rapidly above 80\u00b0C owing to water loss due to evaporation. However, the conductivity of the presented MOFs increased continuously until 85\u00b0C. This was considered to be related to the strong water-binding properties of the phosphate functional groups and the ease of proton donation-acceptance on the phosphate (Fig. 42e) . This work has brought insight into opportunities for the development of proton-conducting MOFs that can operate above 100\u00b0C for higher fuel cell performance.",

            "text": "Overcoming the issue of lithium dendrite formation within solid-state MOF electrolytes is a considerable challenge. Yaghi and coworkers developed a new Li-exchanged Anderson-type polyoxometalate (POM)-based MOF network (MOF-688) [338] . The prepared MOF had a highly porous structure and exhibited high Li-ion conduction for application as the solid-state electrolyte in LIBs (Fig. 43, Table 22b ). MOF-688 attained a high ionic conductivity (3.4 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 S cm \u00c01 at 20\u00b0C) and transference number (t Li+ = 0.87), with POM playing a crucial role for efficient Li conduction. Although the exact role of POM is still not clearly understood, this work motivates toward testing in practical solid-state battery applications. Along the same lines, an MOF superionic conductor (PL/UiOLiTFS) was also reported for Li-ion conduction, which possessed high ionic conductivity (2.07 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 S cm \u00c01 at 25\u00b0C) and a large transference number (t Li+ = 0.84) [333] . Interestingly, the prepared material worked even at low temperatures (0\u00b0C), which is unusual for conventional Li-ion conducting materials as the liquid tends to freeze. Although the conductivity and transference number were not excellent, the non-freezing behavior presented in this work opens a new avenue for solid-state electrolytes that can allow low-temperature battery operation. Therefore, this development presents a model for future generations of solid-state battery devices.",

Recently, Pan and coworkers prepared postsynthesized MOF-808 (WZM solid-state electrolyte) for the incorporation of Zn 2+ ions the solid-state electrolyte for practical VS 2 / Zn batteries [339] . They inserted single Zn 2+ ions into the MOF network, which enhanced the ionic conductivity (2.1 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 S cm \u00c01 ) and transference number (t Zn2+ = 0.93) at 35\u00b0C. Moreover, the electrolyte showed good electrochemical stability, cyclability, and lower self-discharge rates.

Supercapacitors are mainly divided into two categories based on the energy-storage mechanism: (1) electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), and (2) pseudocapacitors. In electrochemical double-layer capacitors, electrical energy is stored on the internal ''surface\" of the electrode through electrostatic interactions, whereas pseudocapacitors utilize fast and reversible redox reactions on the electrode surface [381] .

Therefore, there is a strong focus on the design and development of efficient electrode materials that meet key requirements such as high specific surface area, high conductivity, thermal stability, facile processability, corrosion resistance, and low cost. In this respect, MOFs have emerged as promising electrode materials for use in energystorage supercapacitor applications owing to their characteristic properties. Several important review articles have already discussed MOF-derived electrodes for supercapacitors [355, 382, 383] .

Analysis of their electrochemical properties revealed that the asymmetric electrodes achieved a gravimetric capacitance of 125 F g \u00c01 for CNF@Ni-HITP and 75 F g \u00c01 for CNF@Ni-HHTP at current densities of 0.33 and 0.2 A g \u00c01 , respectively. In addition, the flexibility, mechanical strength, and high conductivity of the CNF@Ni-HITP composite material meant it showed a high gravimetric capacitance of 141.5 F g \u00c01 at 0.075 A g \u00c01 and exceptional volumetric capacitance of up to 2800 mF cm \u00c03 in a symmetrical supercapacitor device.",

However, increasing the speed of integrated circuits while reducing the size engenders several practical issues, including resistive-capacitive (RC) delay, power dissipation, and crosstalk noise. Two major actions have been proposed to overcome these issues. (1) The low resistivity Cu can be used to replaced Al components. (2) The SiO 2 components (dielectric constant k % 3.9-4.5 depending on the deposition and processing protocol) can be replaced with low-k interlayer dielectric (ILD) materials.

Although the development of MOF-based ILDs is still at the early stages, seminal work has done over the last decade.

In addition, comparative studies between the fluorous MOFs and their non-fluorous analogues revealed the high efficacy of their dielectric properties as low-k materials. The authors suggested that the unusual hydrophobicity was due to the presence of -CF 3 groups on the ligand.

With this in mind, novel dielectric ZIF films were prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [ZIF-8-CVD and ZIF-67-CVD], which exhibited suitable gap-filling performance in fork-fork capacitors with low-k dielectrics (Fig. 45b , c) [397] . Metal-insulator-metal (MIM) measurements revealed low k values of 2.23 \u00b1 0.11 and 2.39 \u00b1 0.18 for ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 at 100 kHz, respectively. Moreover, these low k values were insensitive to heating up to 150\u00b0C, proving the thermal stability of these dielectric films. In addition, the authors reported that the ZIF-67-CVD film had high mechanical stability with a greater Young's modulus than that of the ZIF-8-CBD film (3.79 \u00b1 1.83 vs. 3.44 \u00b1 1.42 GPa). In gap-filling tests, the ZIF-67-CVD film attained an effective low k value of 2.71 (Fig. 45b, c) . These results are encouraging for future integration protocols with considerable optimizations to achieve the better low-k gap-filling performance.

In contrast, the guest-free framework exhibited an ultralow k value of 1.80 at 100 kHz, with constant dielectric properties over wide temperature range (40-130\u00b0C) . These results demonstrate the effect of small counter ions on the k value, and how removing the guest molecules from the porous material can reduce k to ultralow values. Very recently, Zhou et al. prepared a HMS@ZIF-8/6FPBO (HMS@ZIF-8 = hollow silica@ZIF-8, 6FPBO = fluorinated polybenzoxazole) composite film via an in-situ polymerization and coating method, which showed a low k value of 2.12 at 1 kHz [399] . MIM studies revealed that dielectric constant was unaltered over a wide temperature range (from room temperature to 200\u00b0C). The lower k value of the composite material compared to the fluorinated polybenzoxazole (6FPBO) matrix (k = 2.12 vs. 2.67) was related to the empty space (nanopores) in the ZIF-8 and HMS framework. In addition, the composite film possessed high thermal stability up to 480\u00b0C and a tensile strength of 2.11 GPa with 6 wt% of HMS@ZIF-8/6FPBO, which is useful for practical applications in electric devices. The dielectric constants of recent dielectric MOFs and their composites are summarized in Table 23 . ",

There is therefore an urgent need to develop a suitable sensor to identify high Pb concentrations. Recently, NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) was employed as a sensing probe for the detection of Pb 2+ ions in real water samples [405] . Among various metal ions, the developed sensor showed high selectivity toward Pb 2+ and detected concentrations as low as 7.7 pM, which is one of the lowest detection limits ever reported. Notably, the fluorescence quenching upon addition of Pb 2+ ions was attributed to ligandto-cluster charge transfer of -NH 2 functional groups in the MOF with Pb 2+ ions, as analyzed by FT-IR, XPS, and UPS (ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy). Furthermore, the NH 2 -MIL-125(Ti) colloid particles dispersed well in water and were easily processible. Stamping the MOF solution onto a surface using a rubber stamp allowed the MOF to be transferred to the surface, which facilitated the preparation of paper-based Pb 2+ sensors. The paper sensor was suitable for reversible Pb 2+ sensing, which provides opportunities for information encryption and decryption applications (Fig. 46) . However, the authors observed that the Pb 2+ ion selectivity decreased in real water samples due to interference from other inorganic salt ions (Na, K, Ca, etc.) and organic molecules present in the water.",

Interestingly, Al 3+ and Cr 3+ enhanced the luminescence of the Cd-CP sensor probe (''turn-on\" effect), whereas Fe 3+ quenched the luminescence (''turn-off\" effect). Competitive experiments revealed that addition of Al 3+ to Fe 3+ @Cd-CP suspension showed a enhanced luminescence to greater degree rather than addition of Cr 3+ .

Indeed, the photoluminescence can occur from diverse energy or charge transfer mechanisms ensuing from the structure-property relationships of MOFs [425] . Therefore, there is a key focus on effective strategies such as metal-ligand combinations and immobilizing luminescent guest molecules and multifunctional moieties into the MOF network to enhance and tune the luminescence properties. In this section, we highlight the recent developments in LMOFs for utilization in LED applications (Table 25) . The development of rare-earth-free yellow phosphors has enormous advantages for white LED applications. In this context, Li's group prepared lanthanide-free MOFs for yellow LEDs [426] . To achieve yellow light emission, a highly conjugated organic ligand was prepared and reacted with Zn ions for MOF synthesis, resulting in the formation of an LMOF denoted as LMOF-305. Although LMOF-305 originated from the reported LMOF-231, improved photoluminescence quantum yield was obtained owing to the inclusion of the fluorinated ligand (H 4 tcbpe-F) into the MOF network. Through spectroscopic measurements and DFT calculations, the authors predicted the structure of the organic ligand before the synthesis of LMOF-305 for yellow light emission. The LED performance test revealed that LMOF-305 emitted yellow light at 550 nm with 88.2% quantum yield. The luminescence lifetime was 3.98 ns with 450 nm excitation. It should be noted that the high quantum yield of was attributed to the 20% increase in blue light absorption owing to the inclusion of guest linker in LMOF-305.",

These LMOFs exhibited white-light emission upon excitation by blue light (Fig. 48c) . To combat luminescence interference of the nanocomposites from the surface of the R6G guest molecules, R6G@ZIF-8 was covered with an additional shell of ZIF-8 (denoted as R6G@ZIF-8 2 ). Under blue light excitation at 450 nm, R6G@ZIF-8 2 emitted a bright yellow light and possessed a high internal quantum yield of 63.1%. However, the DBNT@UiO-66 nanocomposite exhibited white light emission with a poor quantum yield of 22.7% under similar excitation wavelengths. The coated R6G@ZIF-8 2 composite therefore has practical use in white-LED applications for commercial blue light bulbs (450 nm) (Fig. 48d) [429] . The prepared MOF composites showed multi-color light emissions under unpolarized and polarized light. Under unpolarized light, FSDCo and FSDMn exhibited a shiny green color, while FSDCd possessed a dark brownish color. Upon irradiation with polarized light, FSDCo and FSDMn showed multi-colors of green, blue, and brown, while FSDCd strictly emitted green and brown colors. The exhibition of multi-colors was attributed to the low optical bandgaps of 1.8 and 1.83 eV for FSDCo and FSDMn, respectively, while FSDCd had a notably higher optical bandgap of 2.11 eV. In addition, the researchers investigated the light-emitting properties by confocal microscopy, and found that FSDCd responded with rare tricolor (blue, green, and red) light emissions, whereas FSDCo and FSDMn exhibited dual color emissions (blue and green) under various laser excitation wavelengths (Fig. 48h, i) .

Based on the fundamental research, interest in MOFs has moved beyond purely academic to engineering processes and new applications, which open new opportunities in various industries. It is a good time to review the latest advances in MOF researches for the developments in engineering processes and future applications. In this review, we surveyed the criteria for commercial use, the engineering process for mass production and post-process, and future application areas of the MOFs along with representative examples of recent studies. In particular, principle requirements, including stability, producibility, regulation, and production cost of the MOFs are reviewed. Engineering processes for the mass production of MOFs are reviewed in processes of synthesis, product recovery, solvent exchange, and drying. Each process are separately discussed as the manufacturing process can be composed depends on the onsite situation and demands. We also explored the post-processing of MOFs, including shaping and dispersion processes, making MOFs used in large-scale applications.",

We describe their use as adsorbent materials for air purification devices, with a particular focus on removal of particulate matter, toxic gases, volatile organic compounds, and chemical warfare agents. Following this, we discuss their use as adsorbents for the removal of biological toxicants. Several porous adsorbents have been investigated for the removal of uremic toxins in artificial kidney applications, yet crystalline and porous MOFs are expected to play a vital role in addressing the unresolved problems with other porous materials for this application. The porous structure of MOFs has led to their use as efficient antibacterial agents for various biomedical applications, with often exceptional antibacterial behavior. We discuss the different methods of imparting antibacterial functionality to MOFs, as well as the mechanisms by which their antibacterial activity occurs. Several important works that present various MOF-based compounds for bactericidal applications are discussed, along with their possible working mechanisms.",

            "text": "Another key research area for MOFs is their use in solid-state electrolytes in energy storage and conversion applications, as well as electrode materials for energy storage applications. We cover some of the most recent research into proton-and ion-conducting MOFs for fuel cell and battery solid-state electrolyte applications. Following this, we describe the developments in MOF-based materials for anode and cathode materials in rechargeable batteries (Li-and Naion batteries) and supercapacitors. Recently, MOFs have been employed to develop interlayer dielectric materials with low dielectric constants (k) for microelectronic device applications. Low-k dielectric materials are necessary to overcome issues with the miniaturization of integrated circuits with higher speeds. We describe many of the recently designed MOF-based materials with ultralow k values, which provide a platform for the development of superior microelectronic devices. Finally, we describe the luminescent behavior of MOFs and utilization of luminescent MOFs for sensing and light-emitting diode applications. The luminescence of MOFs can be easily tuned by inserting guest molecules into the pores of the MOF, which can be readily adopted for sensing applications and has been widely exploited in LED applications.",

Although many challenges and opportunities are still remaining, the manufacturing process would eventually be developed, and low-cost production can be achieved by economies of scale. The commercialization of MOFs would also be arisen in upcoming applications that are not currently well known in MOF field. We believe that the MOFs should be commercialized in the new area with relatively small quantity during the development of their processes engineering to the larger scale and lower production cost. Therefore, more efforts from academia, and various startup and global companies should be devoted to develop the production and engineering process, and game-changing applications of MOFs that can create added value for a better future.",

Fluorescence studies revealed that the probe could efficiently detect MnO 4 2\u00c0 , and CrO 4 2\u00c0 with concentrations of 0.03, 0.02, and 0.03 mM, respectively. In real water samples, the fluorescence probe successfully detected these anions and exhibited excellent water stability and recyclability. Two lanthanide MOFs (Tb(Hmcd)(H 2 O)(DMF) 2 ] n and [Eu(Hmcd) (H 2 O)(DMF) 2 ] n ) were also prepared for the highly sensitive and selective detection of Cr 2 O 7 2\u00c0 and CrO 4 2\u00c0 [411]. The Tb-and Eubased probes detected Cr 2 O 7 2\u00c0 with LODs of 1.32 \u00c2 10 \u00c06 and 1.34 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 M, respectively, and CrO 4 2\u00c0 with LODs of 3.88 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 and 2.37 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 M, respectively. Although the site at which fluorescence quenching occurred was not clearly analyzed, it was hypothesized that the fluorescent property of lanthanide may play a crucial role in the highly sensitive detection of these chromates. Although several electrochemical methods have been developed for the detection of S 2 O 8 2\u00c0 , the luminescence sensing of S 2 O 8 2\u00c0 has not been extensively studied. Recently, Zhao and coworkers reported a viologen-based Cd-MOF that exhibited excellent S 2 O 8 2\u00c0 detection by enhancement of luminescence [412]. Interestingly, the MOF showed a very fast response of only 2 min. Spectroscopic analysis proved that the nitrate (NO 3 \u00c0 ) anions in the pores of the Cd-MOF were responsible for the selective detection of S 2 O 8 2\u00c0 in aqueous media.",
