MKD is caused by recessive, hypomorphic mutations in the mevalonate kinase gene (MVK) encoding a key enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. This pathway is responsible for cholesterol synthesis and the production of isoprenoid lipid tags required for posttranslational prenylation of proteins. It is believed that inflammation in MKD is triggered by shortage of isoprenoid lipids and defective prenylation of small GTPases. We have found that protein prenylation is indeed compromised in PBMCs from patients and this defect distinguishes MKD from other periodic fever syndromes. However, the link between protein prenylation and inflammation in MKD is still far from understood, largely due to the lack of suitable genetic mouse models. Objectives: To generate new Mvkmutant mouse models of MKD that mimic the human disease. Methods: CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing was used to generate different heterozygous mouse lines with hypomorphic mutations in exon 11 of theMvkgene: a V377I substitution (the most frequent mutation in MKD), and 8, 13 or 91 base pair deletions. These lines were then crossed to generate homozygous Mvk V377I/V377I or Mvk V377I/deI compound heterozygous mice. To assess the effect of the mutations on the mevalonate pathway, we measured the accumulation of unprenylated Rab GTPases and Rap1A using an in vitroprenylation assay and western blotting. For quantification of inflammatory cytokines in serum, as well as in culture supernatants from LPS-stimulated PBMCs and bone marrow macrophages, we used ELISA and multiplex cytokine bead arrays. Results: Homozygous mice carrying complete loss of function deletion mutations were not viable and, as expected, wildtype and heterozygous Mvkmutant mice had normal protein prenylation. However, in a similar pattern to patient PBMCs, Mvk V377I/deI immune cells from blood, spleen and bone marrow had a dramatic accumulation of unprenylated Rab and Rap1A GTPases, with a much milder defect in Mvk V377I/V377I cells. This is consistent with reportedly less severe clinical disease associated with the homozygous V377I mutation. Furthermore, Mvk V377I/deI mice Disclosure of Interest None Declared", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Generation and analysis of mice carrying a novel heterozygous missense mutation of a proteasome subunit, PSMB9, in patients with autoinflammation and immunodeficiency", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "had slightly elevated levels of inflammatory serum cytokines, including IL-6 and G-CSF, and cultures of PBMCs and bone marrow macrophages responded more robustly to LPS stimulation than cells from control mice. Interestingly, like patient-derived cell lines, the prenylation defect was dramatically enhanced in bone marrow cells from Mvkmutant mice after briefly culturing at higher temperature (39-40 o C). Importantly, addition of the missing isoprenoid lipid geranylgeraniol could rescue the prenylation defect in primary cell cultures in vitroand in peritoneal macrophages in vivo. Conclusion: To our knowledge, we have generated the first genetic mouse avatars of MKD. These mice, like MKD patients, have defective protein prenylation and an exaggerated inflammatory response. Furthermore, as with patient-derived cell lines, Mvkmutant mouse cells are temperature-sensitive, suggesting that elevations in body temperature (e.g. caused by mild infections) could quickly precipitate devastating defects in protein prenylation that lead to systemic inflammatory flares. These mice are exciting new tools to study the pathophysiology of MKD and can be used to develop new therapeutic approaches, such as supplementation with isoprenoid lipids.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Introduction: NLRP3 has a pivotal role in nucleating the inflammasome, a cytoplasmic multiprotein complex that mediates the maturation of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) by activating caspase-1. Mutations in the gene encoding NLRP3 cause a spectrum of autoinflammatory diseases, the cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is one of the major NLRP3 inflammasome activating factors. However, the molecular basis of the relationship between change of cellular redox state and NLRP3 inflammasome activation has not been elucidated. Methods: We utilized mouse bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) to analyze interaction of cofilin-1 and NLRP3 by coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP). Mouse BMDMs were used to ectopically express wild-type (WT) or mutant cofilin-1 proteins, and to transfect siRNA for knockdown assay. Cofilin-1 knock-in (KI) mice (C39A or C39S) were generated by microinjection of sgRNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "To identify an ROS-mediated regulator for NLRP3 inflammasome activation, the immune complexes precipitated by NLRP3 specific antibody from BMDMs of WT or NLRP3-KO mice were analyzed by mass spectrometry. We found cofilin-1, the actin severing protein, as a negative regulator for the NLRP3 inflammasome. Cofilin-1 interacted with the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of NLRP3 and dissociated from NLRP3 when the cells were stimulated with known NLRP3 inflammasome activators, such as ATP or nigericin. The NLRP3 inflammasome activators generate ROS that leads to cofilin-1 oxidation, which is intramolecular disulfide bond formation between two cysteine residues at amino acids 39 and 80. This oxidation induces conformational change of cofilin-1 and dissociation from NLRP3, which results in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Indeed, the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome components is impaired and the IL-1\u03b2 release was significantly suppressed in BMDMs ectopically expressing oxidationresistant mutant cofilin-1 (C39A or C80A). In addition, knockdown of cofilin-1 in LPS-primed BMDMs induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation without activator treatment. We also observed that the interaction of cofilin-1 with the CAPS-associated mutant NLRP3 proteins was substantially diminished relative to WT NLRP3, which resulted in constitutive activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. To examine the role of cofilin as a redox sensor for NLRP3 inflammasome activation in vivo, we have generated KI mice expressing oxidation-resistant mutant cofilin-1 (C39A or C39S). Unexpectedly, the IL-1\u03b2 release from the BMDMs of the KI mice was higher than WT BMDMs when the cells were stimulated with ATP after LPS priming. Consistently, IL-1\u03b2 levels in the serum of KI mice after injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intraperitoneally was significantly higher than WT mice. This inconsistent result may be due to the low level of mutant cofilin-1 in KI mice. Indeed, similarly to the result of cofilin-1 knockdown, LPS-primed KI BMDMs release substantial IL-1\u03b2 without activators. Conclusion: Taken together, these findings suggest that cofilin-1 is a key component in regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome in response to ROS. In addition, our data suggest cofilin-1 as a potential therapeutic target for the inflammatory conditions involving the NLRP3 inflammasome, including gout, type 2 diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results:"}, {"text": "Introduction: Monogenic autoinflammatory disorders are characterised by dysregulation of the innate immune system. A significant number of this broadening group of disorders are caused by gain-of-function mutations in inflammasome forming proteins, such as NLRC4. A number of mutations in NLRC4 have been described, leading to a spectrum of NLRC4-associated autoinflammatory disorders (NLRC4-AID). Objectives: We studied two patients with early onset macrophage activation syndrome caused by the same de novo mutation in NLRC4 (c.G1965C, p.W655C). Unlike other mutations in NLRC4 described to date, p.W655 is located within the leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain. For this reason, we investigated mechanisms by which this mutation contributes to the pathogenesis of autoinflammatory disease. Methods: Next generation and Sanger sequencing techniques were used for genetic analysis. ELISA was performed to quantify serum cytokine levels. In vitro, inflammasome complex formation was quantified using flow cytometric analysis of Apoptosis-associated Speck-like protein containing a Caspase recruitment domain (ASC) specks.Monocytelike cell lines were generated by genetic deletion of NLRC4 from THP-1 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 techniques followed by lentiviral transduction of wild type (WT) or mutant NLRC4 cDNA. Cell death and release of IL-1b/IL-18 were quantified using flow cytometry and ELISA respectively. Results: Both reported patients succumbed to macrophage activation syndrome early in life, associated with increased IL-18 serum levels. The NLRC4 mutation identified, c.G1965C/p.W655C, caused increased ASC speck formation in vitro. In THP-1 cells, introduction of c.G1965C/ p.W655C NLRC4 resulted in increased cell death, IL-1b and IL-18 production. The enhanced response was independent of NLRP3 and caspase-8. ASC contributed to p.W655C NLRC4 mediated cytokine release, but not cell death. p.W655 is located at the interface between adjacent LRR domains in the oligomeric inflammasome structure. Mutation of p.W655 activates the NLRC4 inflammasome complex by engaging with two interfaces on the opposing LRR domain. One key set of residues (p.D1010, p.D1011, p.L1012 and p.I1015) participates in LRR-LRR oligomerization when it is triggered by NLRC4-AID mutations or T3SS effector (PrgI) stimulation of the NLRC4 inflammasome complex. Conclusion: This is the first report of a mutation in the LRR domain of NLRC4 causing NLRC4-AID. c.G1965C/p.W655C NLRC4 increases inflammasome activation, leading to constitutive IL-18 production and increased IL-1b release upon priming, where ASC contributes to the cytokine response, but not to cell death. Data generated from various NLRC4 mutations suggests that the tryptophan at p.W655 does not tolerate substitution, and provides evidence that the LRR-LRR interface has an important, previously unrecognized role in oligomerization of the NLRC4 inflammasome complex.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results:"}, {"text": "Introduction: Treatment with canakinumab (CAN), a selective, human anti-IL-1\u03b2 monoclonal antibody, has shown sustained therapeutic effect along with corticosteroid dose reduction/discontinuation in patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), in a long-term extension study (NCT00891046). 1 Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety results from a study evaluating 2 different canakinumab tapering regimens in SJIA patients who were in clinical remission (NCT02296424). Methods: This Phase 3b/4 study had two parts. In Part I, 182 patients with inactive disease from the extension study 1 (cohort 1) and CAN-na\u00efve patients (cohort 2) with active disease were administered subcutaneous CAN 4 mg/kg q4w. Per protocol titration off corticosteroids and/or methotrexate was attempted during Part I. Eligible patients (inactive disease for 24 consecutive weeks and being corticosteroid-and methotrexate-free for at least 4 weeks) advanced to Part II. Patients were randomised to either a 3-step CAN dose reduction regimen (2mg/kg/q4w, followed by tapering to 1 mg/kg/q4w and then discontinuation) or dose interval prolongation regimen (4mg/kg q8w, followed by tapering to 4 mg/kg/q12w and then discontinuation); patients advanced to the next tapering step if inactive disease was maintained for 24 weeks. The primary objective was to evaluate if at least 40% of patients were able to maintain inactive disease status for at least 24 consecutive weeks on either 2mg/kg q4w or 4mg/kg q8w. Results: In Part II, a total of 75 patients were randomised to a dose reduction (n=38) or dose interval prolongation (n=37) in CAN tapering regimen. The proportion of patients who maintained inactive disease for 24 consecutive weeks exceeded the predefined threshold of 40% for Step 1 of: the reduced CAN dose (71%; 2 mg/kg q4w) and prolonged dose interval (84%; 4 mg/kg q8w) treatment arms. A total of 68% (26/38) and 79% (30/37) of the dose reduction and interval prolongation arms, respectively were successful in Step 2, while only 33% (25/75) of patients successfully discontinued CAN and maintained inactive disease for 24 consecutive weeks. Adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs observed within the 2 treatment cohorts and across Parts I and II were similar without any specific pattern or relationship to patients' disease status at baseline or treatment regimen. The most frequent AEs were common infections such as nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and pharyngitis followed by SJIA-related events such as rash, pyrexia and arthralgia. Clinical laboratory abnormalities were consistent with expected findings in patients with active SJIA and the known safety profile of CAN. Conclusion: SJIA patients who are able to maintain inactive disease status on CAN monotherapy can successfully taper CAN by either reducing the dose or prolonging the dosing interval. However, only a minority of patients successfully discontinued CAN treatment for 24 weeks. The safety profile for both CAN titration regimens was similar and consistent with other CAN SJIA studies.

A broad spectrum of features, including systemic inflammation, cutaneous, neurologic, musculoskeletal, and immunological manifestations have now been associated with DADA2. Given the highly polymorphic nature of the ADA2 and the complex clinical presentations of DADA2, large cohort studies are critical to advancing our knowledge of ADA2's role in disease manifestation and pathogenesis. Objectives: To expand on the genetics of patients with DADA2 and explore the pathophysiology and the underlying mechanisms of TNF inhibitor response in these patients. Methods: We performed Sanger sequencing of the ADA2 gene (previously known as CECR1) and measured ADA2 enzyme activity in serum samples of patients and family members. We used flow cytometry, intracellular cytokine staining, transcriptome analysis, immunohistochemistry and cell differentiation experiments to define an inflammatory signature in DADA2 patients and studied their response to TNF inhibitor treatment. Results: We have identified 60 patients with DADA2 and detected 10 pathogenic variants, which had not previously been associated with DADA2p.R9W, p.R34W, p.W204C, p.E244A, p.D329N, p.L351Q, p.A357T, p.P425A, p.P435A, p.W501*.Patients tested for ADA2 enzymatic activity had significantly decreased protein activity. Symptoms were highly variable among patients, even in cases with identical genotypes. We identified distinct inflammatory signatures. Patients had significantly higher subsets of CD14+ inflammatory monocytes than healthy controls. Phosphorylation of STAT1 was upregulated in patients CD4+ cells and monocytes following stimulation. Additionally, we observed increased gene expression of IP-10 in patients' monocytes and macrophages. Furthermore, we observed strong NF-\u03baB signaling in patients. Intracellular cytokine staining and qPCR for IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF cytokines were elevated in patients' monocytes. After TNF inhibitor treatment, IFN and NF-\u03baB inflammatory signatures were normalized. Analyses of post-treatment skin, lung and brain biopsies showed minimal perivascular TNF and resolution of inflammatory myeloid cell infiltrates. Immunostaining of skin biopsies revealed intact blood vessels with normal endothelial layers after treatment. Together, the data provides evidence that TNF inhibition both reduces systemic inflammation and improves endothelial integrity in the small vessels. ADA2 deficiency affects the differentiation of monocytes to antiinflammatory M2 macrophages. Treatment with TNF-inhibitors rescued the impairment of M2 differentiation as demonstrated by improved cell morphology and a higher number of M2 macrophages. Conclusion: We report 10 novel pathogenic variants in ADA2, which is valuable for future DADA2 molecular diagnostic. Most important, we showed the cellular mechanism underlying effective treatment with anti-TNF therapies.

For the following statements, it is assumed that the patient is compliant with colchicine. When utilizing colchicine to treat FMF, it is recommended to adjust the dose based on disease activity with the maximal dose in children depending on age (and weight). The maximum recommended colchicine dose for the treatment of FMF is between 1-3 mg per day depending on age, limited by signs of toxicity and tolerability. For a patient receiving the maximum tolerated dose of colchicine, resistance to colchicine is defined as ongoing disease activity (as reflected by either recurrent clinical attacks (average one or more attacks per month over a three-month period), or persistently elevated CRP or SAA in between attacks (depending on which is available locally)), in the absence of any other plausible explanation.

The genetic predisposition to this rampant IL-1-driven inflammation remains nevertheless elusive. Previous studies failed to identify associations between polymorphisms in the genes encoding IL-1 and AOSD, thus pointing at more complex genetic mechanisms.

Primary symptoms include cutaneous vasculitis, increased susceptibility to infection, microthrombocytopenia, and colitis. ARPC1B is a component of the Arp2/3 complex which regulates branched actin polymerization.

Methods: Mutant Arpc1b-deficient zebrafish were generated by targeting CRISPR-Cas9 to exon 4 of arpc1b in AB zebrafish embryos, and crossing F1 mutants to mpeg1-GFP + fish. Four days post-fertilization, tails were cut transversely just distal to the notochord, and GFP + cells imaged over an 8 hr period. Cells were tracked individually and migration behaviour quantified using Volocity. EBV-transformed lymphoblasts (LCLs) were derived from three previously characterised ARPC1B patients. Patient 1 has a null mutation (c.387_388insCT, L90fs). Patients 2 and 3 are brothers with two SNPs (c.434C>T, A105V; c832G>A, A238T). LCLs were also derived from the parents of Patient 2 and 3, heterozygous for both mutations. Cell phenotype was assessed by immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry. Calcium flux was analysed by flow cytometry using ratiometric dye Fura Red-AM and stimulating LCLs with anti-IgG. The VCA domain of WASP binds and activates the Arp2/3 complex and was used to stimulate pyrene-actin polymerization activity.

In the patient LCLs, loss of ARPC1B protein, compensatory upregulation of isoform ARPC1A, and loss of total F-actin were confirmed. Patient 1 LCLs were unusually adherent in the absence of stimulation, suggesting constitutive activation. To measure activation, LCLs were stimulated with anti-IgG to measure calcium flux; Patient 1 had a statistically significant higher calcium flux peak compared to control. To address whether Arp2/3 function was compromised, LCL lysates were stimulated with (activating domain) VCA and actin assembly was measured. Although both ARPC1B and ARPC1A isoforms were found to interact with VCA and full-length WASP in immunoprecipitation experiments, VCA-induced actin polymerization in cell lysates was completely abolished in Patients 1-3. Patient 1 was treated with an allogeneic HSCT in January 2018.

Moreover, the patient presented recurrent HLH episodes that required high dose of glucocorticoid and cyclosporine-A treatment.

During the HLH episodes levels of IL-18 were moderately elevated (10.880 pg/ml) the IFN-gamma induced chemokine CXCL9 was markedly high (21.871 pg/mL) and remained markedly elevated also during clinical and laboratory HLH remission (3.121 pg/ml and 9.929 pg/ml respectively).

Introduction: Autoinflammatory disorders (AIDs) is defined as an disorders associated with dysregulation of innate immune systems. In typical case, patients with AIDs show various inflammatory symptoms, such as periodic fever, skin rash and sterile serositis. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models of AIDs are supposed to be feasible and useful, because 1) most of typical AIDs are monogenic, 2) responsible cells are usually innate immune cells which can be robustly differentiated from PSCs, and 3) improvement of therapeutic or diagnostic approach is still needed in many AIDs. We therefore focused on establishing PSC models of AIDs, and applied these models to identification of genetic and biological background of patients' pathophysiology. Results: We established iPSCs from patients with AIDs such as CINCA/ NOMID, Nakajo-Nishimura syndrome (NNS), and Blau syndrome (BS). We also corrected the disease-causing mutations by genome editing technology in selected clones. iPSCs were then differentiated into hematopoietic cells, especially into monocytic lineage cells. To stably obtain functional monocytic cells, monocytic progenitor cells derived from iPSCs were immortalized. The immortalized monocytic cell lines (MLs) were further differentiated into mature macrophages and then used for functional assays. The monocytic cells from AID-iPSCs showed increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF and IL-1\u03b2. In case of CINCA/NOMID, iPSCs established from a NLRP3mutation negative patient were useful for the identification of somatic NLRC4 mutation of the patient. The AID-iPSCs were also used for dissecting underlying disease mechanism, and suitable for highthroughput phenotypic screening.

Currently, next generation sequencing (NGS) allows the simultaneous investigation of multiple genes at a manageable cost. We present here our 4 years of experience of targeted NGS as a routine diagnostic for SAIDs. Introduction: Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in TNFAIP3 lead to haploinsufficiency of A20 (HA20) commonly manifesting with severe orogenital ulceration and ocular inflammation. Central nervous system (CNS) inflammation has been observed in patients with haploinsufficiency of HA20 but CNS involvement as the sole clinical manifestation of heterozygous TNFAIP3 mutation in humans has never been described however. Herein, we report on the case of an 8 year old female of non-consanguineous Pakistani-Indian descent who presented with left sided focal seizures and hemiparesis, acute uveitis and congitive decline. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her brain revealed contrast-enhancing T2 hypointense intracranial mass lesions, in the grey matter of the paracentral lobule and the thalamus on the left with surrounding oedema. Brain biopsy revealed necrotising granulomatous inflammation. Brain CT revealed intracerebral calcification. Extensive screening of infectious or malignant causes was negative.She failed to respond to multiple antiinflammatory treatments but had an excellent radiological and clinical response to an oral JAK-STAT inhibitor suggesting this was likely an interferon (IFN) mediated inflammatory disease. Objectives: To use next generation sequencing to identify the genetic cause of the progressive neuroinflammatory disorder in this case and characterise the mechanisms underpinning neuroinflammation Methods: Whole exome sequencing (WES; illumina MiSeq) was carried out in all family members. Expression of phosphorylated-p65, IRF3, STAT1 and STAT3 in both patient and healthy control derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells was assessed by flow cytometry. Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) assays was used to quantify cytokines in patient serum. qPCR assays measured the expression levels of IFN stimulated gene expression. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis assessed the binding capacity of the mutated protein to Tankbinding kinase 1 (TBK1) Results: WES revealed a heterozygous missense p.T647P mutation in TNFAIP3 as the cause of the progressive neuroinflammatory disorder in this case. Patient-derived cells exhibited enhanced phosphorylation of the p65 transcription factor, and increased expression of NF-\u0199B mediated proinflammatory cytokines. The mutated p.T647P A20 protein failed to control interferon-regulatory-factor-3 (IRF3) activation and interferon (IFN)-dependent gene transcription, in comparison to healthy control cells. We also show that the mutant A20 protein cannot efficiently bind to TBK1, in order to turn off IRF3 activation leading to an enhanced IFN signature in the patient. We believe that failure to regulate IFN-mediated immune responses, was the driver of the CNS inflammation observed. Furthermore, treatment with an oral JAK 1/2 inhibitor resulted in marked clinical improvement, complete radiological resolution of neuroinflammation, and normalisation of IFN-stimulated gene expression in whole blood. IFN mediated immune responses were also impaired in an additional disease control case of HA20 in a 4 year old heterozygote for the p.N98Tfs25 TNFAIP3 variant. Conclusion: We describe for the first time heterozygous p.T647P missense mutation in TNFAIP3 as the cause ofprogressive neuroinflammation. The p.T647P mutated A20 proteinfailed to control IRF3 activation and IFN dependent transcription. Treatment with an oral JAK 1/2 inhibitor was highly effective. Our report now adds TNFAIP3 mediated neuroinflammation to the ever-expanding group of monogenic interferonopathies with propensity to CNS involvement.

It is caused by mutations of the MEFV gene encoding a protein called pyrin. The most frequent genotype-phenotype correlation is in a certain part of exon 10, especially M694V mutation. There are also a group of patients with non-exon 10 mutations, who have a similar clinical spectrum of the disease. Objectives: We aim to investigate the genotype-phenotype differences between M694V heterozygote mutations and non-exon 10 mutations.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Methods: Data charts of children (n=431) with FMF from Dokuz Eylul University childrens' hospital and Dr.B.Uz childrens' hospital were reviewed.

Results: There were M694V heterozygote mutations in 128 (29.7%) patients and non-exon 10 mutations in 303 (70.3%) patients. The follow-up period was 54.5 (33-105) months. There was no difference between the age of symptoms onset, the age of diagnosis, and the diagnosis delay time. The family history in patients with M694V heterozygote mutation was statistically positive compared to non-exon 10 mutation group (p:0.000). The symptoms of joint involvement as arthritis were significantly higher in the M694V heterozygotegroup (p:0.026).

Introduction: Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome (AGS) is a genetically determined encephalopathy characterized by calcification of the basal ganglia and white matter, demyelination, and raised levels of lymphocytes and IFN\u03b1 in the cerebrospinal fluid [1] . Neurological dysfunction becomes clinically apparent in infancy and manifests as progressive microcephaly, spasticity, dystonia, and psychomotor retardation. Expression of interferon-regulated genes (IGS) in peripheral blood is also upregulated, which is sustained over time [2] . The genes mutated in AGS have been defined to encode proteins implicated in the metabolism of nucleic acids TREX1, the RNASEH2 complex and SAMHD1,which may all function as cellular nucleases [3] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 512, "end": 515, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 793, "end": 796, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 990, "end": 993, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Objectives: Arthritis and progressive arthropathy with distal joint contractureshave been reported in SAMHD1 mutation along with neurological symptoms [4] .

He had active arthritis in his both wrists, knees and elbows. Lab testing revealed normal blood work ESR, CRP, and negative ANA and RF. Interestingly HLAB27 was present.A diagnosis of JIA was made and he was started on naproxen, and had intra-articular in jectionsarticular injections twice. His arthritisHis arthritis was difficult to control and Etanercept andsubcutaneous Methotrexate were started. His arthritis improved significantly,with residual mild disease atboth wrist joints.His brother, patient two is a 3 year old boy who presented similarly at age of 18 months with morning stiffness and abnormal gait for one-month duration. He had active arthritis in both knees, hips and wrists. He had similar lab findings and positive HLAB27.He was treated with naproxen, a short course of oral steroid and Methotrexate. He responded faster than his brother, but continue to have mild arthritis atboth wrists. Due to difficult to treat, early arthritis in two consanguineous brothers, wesent genetic testing with whole exome sequencing (WES) to look for other causes of their arthritis.Genetic testing for both siblings showed Homozygous mutation at the SAMHD1 gene for the P.Arg 290His (CGT>CAT):c.869G >A.Both parents were heterozygous for the same mutation. The R290H variant in the SAMHD1 gene has been reported previously in association with AGS in an affected individual with multiple clinical features including CNS symptoms and arthritis [5] .Peripheral blood analysis of type I interferon-related biomarkers demonstrated that both siblings have an interferon signature characteristic of Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (Fig 1) . Both brothers continued to have normal development with no CNS symptoms or rash and their eye exam showed no glaucoma, which was previously reported in AGS with the SAMHD1 mutation. Despite being asymptomatic from CNS disease we are considering brain MRI to look for inflammatory cerebral vasculopathy that has been reported previously [6] . Conclusion: We are reporting a spectrum of AGS with a SAMHD1 mutation that mimicks difficult to treat early onset polyarticular arthritis without any CNS or skin manifestations. This illustrates the need to consider mutation analysis of SAMHD1 in similar presentations as CNS and skin disease may evolve later. Finally, even though there has been partial response to treatments,we may consider changing therapy to Janus Kinase inhibitors to achieve complete remission of arthritis. Objectives: To report the phenotype, genotype and response to treatment in Arab children with monogenic AIDs other than FMF, with focus on accrual damage. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients with clinical and/ or genetically proven monogenic AIDs other than FMF seen between 1990 and 2018 at 10 rheumatology clinics from seven Arab countries. Data were collected at the last follow-up visit comprising history of consanguinity, age at onset and diagnosis, follow-up duration, clinical and laboratory findings, as well as the damage accrual and death related to monogenic AIDs. Results: Seventy (46 female) patients with monogenic AIDs were analyzed. Consanguinity rate among the enrolled patients was 74.6% and a family history of AIDs was present in 60%. The mean age at disease onset was 3.2\u00b12 years and mean duration of follow-up was 7.5\u00b14 years. The initial diagnosis was inaccurate in 47% and the mean diagnosis delay was 4\u00b13 years. The most frequent monogenic AIDs were LACC1 associated monogenic disorders (monogenic JIA and monogenic Crohn's) (23) followed by cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) (12), tumor necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) (12), hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome (HIDS) (9), Majeed's syndrome (6) and eight patients with other monogenic AIDs. Musculoskeletal involvement was the main feature in LACC1 associated monogenic disorders while fever and mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal involvement were the most prevalent features in the other monogenic AIDs. Genetic testing was performed in 67 patients, 69% had genetically confirmed disease. Patients with mutation c.T850C p.C284R in exon 4 of LACC1 had severe arthritic changes. Three CAPS patients with NLRP3 mutation had cognitive impairment and one with significant hearing and ocular damage. Two HIDS patients had homozygous p.V3771 mutation and other two patients with p.V3771/ compound heterozygous MEFV: p.E148Q/p.P369S/p.R408G. Three different LPIN2 mutations were recorded for Majeed's syndrome. Overall, growth failure was the most frequent (36%), followed by cognitive impairment (13%). There were three deaths due to infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1753, "end": 1756, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2276, "end": 2279, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1930, "end": 1937, "text": "(Fig 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Conclusion: The number of genetically confirmed patients with monogenic AIDs other than FMF are not uncommon among Arab children probably due to a high consanguinity rate.

Introduction: The auto-inflammatory conditions represent an emerging and over-expanding series of diseases unified by a dysregulation of innate immunity. The current increase in the prevalence of chronic inflammatory diseases makes this subject of interest. Early recognition and treatment with immunomodulator agents have the potential to improve the outcomes and the quality of life. Objectives: The purpose of this review is to describe the clinical features, investigations, therapeutic modalities and outcome of auto-inflammatory syndromes seen at King Abdullah Specialized Children's Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Methods: We carried out a descriptive retrospective analysis of pediatric patients with auto-inflammatory diseases who were seen and managed at a single tertiary center, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between 2004 and 2018. Multiple measures were investigated including time of disease onset, clinical features, investigations, treatment, and outcome. Results: 67 patients (30 females and 37 males) with auto-inflammatory diseases were identified and formed the basis of the study (Table 1) . Autoinflammatory diseases include Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (sJIA) 46%, Chronic Recurrent Multifocal Osteomyelitis (CRMO) 15%, Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) 7%, Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS) 6%, Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, cervical adenitis (PFAPA) 6%, Neonatal onset multisystemic inflammatory disease (NOMID) 3%, STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI) 3%, ), Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome (AGS) 1%, Deficiency of Adenosine Deaminase 2 (DADA2) 5%, Deficiency of interleukin thirty-six receptor antagonist (DITRA) 1%, Blau syndrome 1% and Uncharacterized Auto-inflammatory Disease (UAD) 3%. The mean age at initial presentation was 58.2 months. The median Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C -Reactive protein (CRP) were 72 mm/hr and 86 mg/dl, respectively. Treatment modalities that have been used include Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and/ or biologic therapy including Anti TNF alpha, Anti IL-1 or Anti IL-6 and others (Table1). Conclusion: We believe this cohort provides the common features of autoinflammatory diseases in Saudi Children and the outcome after frequently used target therapies. Early recognition and treatment of auto-inflammatory diseases with immunomodulator agents have the great potential to alleviate the debilitating symptoms and to improve the quality of life. Introduction: Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) as an ethnic disease is wide-spread in Armenia. In most cases FMF manifests in childhood. Myalgia is an essential feature of musculoskeletal symptoms (MSM) of FMF, which can be presented as acute muscle attacksspontaneous myalgia (SM) and exercise-induced myalgia (EIM), as well as prolonged protracted febrile myalgia (PFM). Awareness of these symptoms are important for early diagnosis and differential diagnosis of FMF. Objectives: to study the frequency of different types of myalgia in Armenian children with FMF and their correlation with MEFV genotype and disease severity. Methods: A group of 715 children with FMF was observed at the National Pediatric Centre for FMF (438 boys, 277 girls, mean age 8.64\u00b10.17). The diagnosis of FMF was based on the Tel-Hashomer criteria and detection of 12 MEFV mutations common for Armenians using Viennalab Diagnostics molecular-genetic assay. For statistical analysis standard statistical Epi-Info 2000 Program was performed. For comparison of two nominal variables in table \"two by two\" Yaet's corrected for continuity chi-square test was used, significance level p<0.05 Results: Myalgia was observed in 37.5% (268 out of 715) of FMF patients and manifested mainly as SM and /or EIM in 34.7% (248 patients), as well as PFM in 2.7% (20 patients). SM and EIM manifested as transient pains of the legs without fever, disappearing after resting or taking NSAIDs. The frequency of development of SM and EIM varied from 43.6% to 31.2% depending on the genotype and was relatively common in M694V and V726A heterozygotes compared to homozygotes(\u03c72= 3.41; p> 0.05). Risk of development of SM and EIM was associated with severity of FMF (\u03c72= 23.20, p <0.0001) and was higher in severe and moderate course of FMF compared to mild 5.6 times (\u03c72= 18.28; P <0.0001) and 1.9 times (\u03c72= 3.77; P <0.05) respectively. We observed prolonged PFM in 2.7% of FMF patients with more severe phenotypes, which were characterized by 4 times higher risk of early onset (\u03c72= 5.94; p = 0.015) (mean age 3 years), as well as late diagnosis of FMF (9.42 \u00b1 0.72) and the delayed start of colchicine therapy . This cohort of patients had also high frequency of severe FMF attacks with generalized febrile muscle pain during 1-3 weeks, prevalence of acute recurrent arthritis, erysipelas-like erythema. PFM manifestation usually was after 5-6 year of FMF onset. Because of PFM is considered also as vasculitis, steroid therapy was started along with colchicine. Development of PFM was associated with severe M694V-homozygous genotype (\u03c72 = 8.27; p <0.02) and was observed at 4.6% of M694V-homozygous patients. Conclusion: The frequency of different types of myalgia in Armenian children with FMF is high (37.5%), especially acute muscle attacks -SM and/ or EIM (34.7%). PFM is diagnosed in 2.7% patients. The development of SM and EIM is associated with the severity of FMF and does not depend on the MEFV genotype. The risk of development of PFM, as a part of prolonged MSM, is associated with both: the MEFV genotype (mostly M694V-homozygous) and the severity of the disease. This allows to consider PFM as a marker of severe course of FMF and early disease onset and the M694V homozygous genotype as a risk factor for the development of PFM. MEFV mutation genetic screening is recommended for Armenian paediatric patients with different types of myalgia, especially with PFM, for early diagnosis of FMF, treatment and prevention of complications. on disease course and treatment status and comorbidities of our patients with FMF. Methods: Among the FMF patients who have been followed in our FMF outpatient clinic with a pool of approximately 5000 patients, those who have aged 40 and over are being included to the study. As by today 180 patients are considered for evaluation. The files of patients were reviewed and a standard questionnaire was used to interview the patients. Here we report the results of 100 of these patients (56%) who were contacted for this purpose. These patients were questioned on their demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, colchicine treatment details, and attack information. In order to see the trend of the change in the parameters assessed , the patients were divided into two groups based on their present age(Group 1: 40-50 years, Group 2: \u226550 years).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1391, "end": 1400, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Results: A total of 100 (78 F, 22M) patients were evaluated. There were 61(46F, 15M) patients aged between 40-50 years and 39 (32F, 7M) over 50. The demographic characteristics and clinical features of these patients are given in Table 1 .Besides 3, all patients were still on colchicine regularly. Ninety-six percent of the patients declared overall benefit from colchicine therapy, however 38% experienced a side effect related to this treatment.-Over 88% of the patients reported decrease in severity and frequency of FMF attacks.The mean daily colchicine dose was lower in the age 50 and over group (1.7\u00b10,77 mg versus 1,35 \u00b10,38 mg). There were no patients with AA amyloidosis in neither age group. The mean duration from the last attack increased from 15.3 \u00b119.7 months to 35.6\u00b1 52 months in the older patients. One or more additional disease was present in 75% of this patient group.Among the comorbidities hypertension was the most frequent, diagnosed in 25% of the patients, followed by hypothyroidism (16%), diabetes mellitus (10%) and cardiac disease (5% ). Sixty-five of the patients were recieving other medications in addition to colchicine. Conclusion: According to our preliminary data the majority of the patients continue to take colchicine after age of 40. However the frequency of FMF attacks as well as daily colchicine dose decrease as the patients get older.With well designed trials stopping colchicine treatment may be considered in a subgroup of patients after 50 years of age. Approximately \u00be of the FMF population over 40 years of age has a comorbidity that neccecitates additional medications which underlines the need for special attention. 880 of 1999 (44%) FMF patients had homozygous MEFV gene mutation, the most common mutation was M694V homozygous. The remaining were compound heterozygous. 656 patients (32.8%) had one or more than one comorbidity associated with FMF. Ankylosing spondylitis was the most common comorbidity associated with increased inflammation while the most common comorbidity in FMF related comorbidities was renal amyloidosis. The frequency of ankylosing spondylitis, henoch schonlein purpura, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), multiple sclerosis (MS) and Beh\u00e7et's disease were increased in patients with FMF when compared to those in the literature.

Also, the values of phospho-calcic metabolism samples were not statistically different between patients and controls. As expected, SAA levels were significantly higher in patients (p= 0.0144), and interestingly also OPG levels were significantly higher if compared to the healthy subjects (p= 0.0018). For b-ALP, CTX and RANK-L no differences were observed between the two groups (p=0.1466, p=0.8861, and p= 0.7890 respectively). Conclusion: Patients of our cohort affected by FMF, TRAPS and HIDS do not present an increased risk of OP compared to the healthy controls. Indeed, TBS and BMD are similar between the two groups highlighting a preserved bone quality in our patients. Interestingly, OPG levels are higher compared to controls and this could suggest a protective role and a bone re-balancing activity in a context of inflammation. Finally, a regulatory effect of serum amyloid A on bone homeostasis should be taken into account. Genetic testing revealed the same two variants in the patient's mother and aunt, while unaffected relatives had one or the other (see Table 1 ). The patient and mother are HLA-B27+ and have the same 2.8 Mb duplication from 3q28 to 3q29 on chromosomal microarray including IL1RAP.

Conclusion: Cessation ofcolchicine therapy following prolonged remission in selected group of patients who are not homozygous for MEFV mutation could be considered. Patients with arthritis or arthralgia are more likely to have an attack after ceasing colchicine therapy. Introduction: Cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) are rare autoinflammatory disorders associated with dominantly gain-offunction mutations in the NLRP3 gene that result in overactivation of the inflammasome, increased secretion of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18, and systemic inflammation. It has been reported that oligomeric particles of the adaptor ASC (apoptosis-associated Speck-like protein with a caspase-recruitment domain) are released together with IL-1beta and active caspase-1 subunits after activation of the inflammosome complex and that patients with CAPS show an increased serum concentration of ASC + particles. Objectives: The diagnosis of CAPS is a critical factor due to both the lack of specific laboratory results and the sharing of similar clinical manifestations with other autoinflammatory diseases, our aim is to develop a simple assay to evaluate the levels of ASC particles in the serum of CAPS patients to provide novel biomarkers facilitating early disease diagnosis and able to monitor treatment responses. Methods: We developed an ELISA for the quantification of ASC particles in serum and plasma of normal and pathological subjects. We analysed samples from CAPS patients and from patients with autoimmune disorders (Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis), to confirm that ASC presence in the serum is not due to other chronic inflammatory processes characterizing autoimmunity. In addition, we also evaluated the concentration of ASC in the sera of TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) patients to reinforce the concept of specificity of this biomarker in CAPS patients and not in individuals suffering from others inflammatory disorders. Results: We observed that untreated CAPS patients are characterized by the presence of a significant higher amount of ASC particles when compared with healthy controls (HS) and with patients suffering from MS and T1D. This tendency was also evident in patients with arthritis and TRAPS even if the difference was not statistically significant due to the small number of samples. In addition there is a tendency through a reduction of ASC levels in CAPS patients after pharmacological treatment, which require future investigations. Conclusion: These data suggest that ELISA quantitation of ASC protein could represent a novel and additional strategy for the diagnosis and monitoring of CAPS.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 589, "end": 601, "text": "1-36.4months", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Introduction: The prevalence of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS) is estimated at about one per million.

During cold months, she needed daily FANS because of fever, and topical steroids for skin rash, prescribed by dermatologists. The patient was in chronic therapy with local steroids because of recurrent ulcerative keratitis. Some corneal scars are present as outcomes. She experienced ocular manifestation on exposure to cold and summertime in contact with air conditioning. She has a 18-years daughter and a 15years son with a long history of maculopapular rash after cold exposure starting in childhood associated with low-grade fever, fatigue, headache and arthralgia (more severe in the son) lasting less than 24hours. The two children had the same ocular manifestations of the mother and underwent local steroids therapy 4-5 times per year. They all carried the A439V mutation on NPLR3 gene exon 3. Patients were vaccinated (Pneumococcus, HBV, HAV) before starting treatment for anti-IL1 (canakinumab, a fully human anti-IL-1\u03b2 monoclonal antibody, at a dose of 150 mg subcutaneous every 8 weeks). The Auto-Inflammatory Disease Activity Index (AIDAI, the simplified items scored 0-1 (CAPS range 0-155)) and the Autoinflammatory Disease Damage Index (ADDI) scores were assessed before every treatment. Before treatment, the AIDAI score calculated during a winter and summer month was respectively 59 and 5 for the mother, 30 and 3 for the daughter and 40 and 3 for the son. After 12-months of treatment, the AIDAI score is zero for the mother and the daughter as well as the ADDI score. During treatment mother experienced a urinary tract infection and the daughter two distinct infectious episodes: one of pharyngitis and one of diarrhoea. The son delayed his treatment because of a severe chronic sinusitis that needed surgical treatment. He just received his first dose last month. Conclusion: The NLRP3 mutation A439V was first entered into the Infevers database in 2002 by Hal Hoffman. It is one of the most common mutations in multiplex families with CAPS and it is considered a CAPS disease-causing mutation, although the overall clinical phenotype is rather mild. Most of the patients reported with FCAS carrying A439V have ocular manifestations (conjunctivitis, keratitis, uveitis) that causes lifelong debilitating effects that restrict patients' daily activities, as well as rash or low-grade fever or myalgia/arthralgia.FCASassociated ocular manifestations need treatment with anti-IL1, which typically results in dramatic improvement in clinical and laboratory measures of inflammation, and is well tolerated. Unfortunately, ophthalmologists, dermatologist as well as other specialists do not recognise FCAS and do not appropriately treat this disease nor send patients to Autoinflammatory Diseases experienced Centres. Introduction: Clinical spectrum of Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is heterogeneous, ranging between minimal activity of few affected sites and excellent response to colchicine and large number of frequent, intolerable, treatment-resistant attacks. Frequent and severe FMF attacks may result in serious complications. Severity scoring systems for FMF have been developed and validated in adults (1998 Pras et al., 2005 to objectively quantify the disease severity for both therapeutic and prognostic purposes. In 2016 the ISSF score has been developed with a consensus-driven methodology by paediatricians and internists, with expertise in this disease, and validated in a large database comprising both children and adults with FMF.

Methods: All the patients with FMF in charge since 2003 have been enrolled. Severity scores have been calculated at the diagnosis and ADDI has been calculated at the latest visit. ROC curves and statistical analysis have been performed. Results: Forty-five consecutive patients affected by FMF (follow-up 1-41 years) with a median age of 39 years (range 9-89) have been evaluated. Ten patients were diagnosed for FMF in childhood and 35 in adulthood, with a median of diagnostic delay of 12 years (range . Eight patients are homozygous carries of one mutation on MEFV gene exon 10, twelve patients are heterozygous carriers of two mutations on MEFV gene exon 10, and twenty patients are heterozygous carriers of one mutation on MEFV gene exon 10. All patients except four are under therapy with colchicine. Nine patients need more than 1mg per day of colchicine. Ten patients reported one or two mild FMF attacks during the year before the last visit. According to the severity score of Mor et al., 15 patients were stratified as mild disease, 20 as intermediate and 10 as severe. According to the ISSF score, 37 patients had a mild disease, eight intermediate and no one severe. Sixteen patients have a positive ADDI score (range 0-4). The ROC analysis shows that the score of Mor performed better than the ISSF (AUC 0.903vs0.661) to identify patients needing more than 1mg of colchicine per day. The ISSF has a good performance (AUC 0.694) to identify patients referring one or two mild attacks in the year before the last visit. The ROC curves analysis shows that both the Mor (AUC 0.677) and the ISSF (AUC 0.657) scores can identify patients with chronic damage (positive ADDI score). ROC analysis of Mor, ISSF and ADDI scores for FMF genetic pattern, showed that only ADDI has a good performance (AUC 0.811) to discriminate the FMF homozygous patients. Conclusion: The score of Mor et al. can be useful for prediction of FMF patients needing higher colchicine dosage. The ISSF score seems to predict better patients with one or two mild attacks per year. The most of homozygous FMF patients have a positive ADDI score despite therapy. was 93.6\u00b1104 months. 43% (174) of the patients had positive family history for FMF, 7% (29) had consanguineous marriage in family. 24% of the patients had appendectomy. Fever and abdominal pain both were initial symptoms in 72% of the patients, while 7% of them had chest pain, 4% had only fever, 15% had arthritis, 1% had erysipelas like erythema (ELE) as the first symptom of FMF. Fever was observed 76% of the patients, abdominal pain in 86%, ELE in 13%, chest pain in 21%, and arthritis in 32%. The frequency of monoarthritis was 21%, oligoarthritis 10,5% and polyarthritis was identified 0,5% of the patients. Ankle arthritis was the most frequent(20%) one among the patients who had monoartritis. 16% of the patients had inflammatory back pain, while 11% of the patients were identified with sacroiliitis. 8 patients (2%) suffered from chronic kidney disease and 2 of them were on dialysis programme. Amyloidosis (diagnosed with biopsy) was identified among 14 patients (3,5%) . At least one mutation of MEFV gene was identified in 78% of the patients. No mutation could be identified in 8%. MEFV gene analyses was not performed in 14% of the patients. The most frequent mutation was M694V mutation and its allel frequency was found to be 54%. For V726A, M680I, E148Q, R761H and A744S allels, mutation frequency were in order of 11%, 7%, 7%, 2%, 1%. The frequency of compound heterozygositywas 38% and the most common genotype wasM694V/R202Q (11%). There was a significant relationship between M694V mutation and arthritis, ELE, amyloidosis and sacroiliitis (p<0.001). Amyloidosis was more frequent in patients with M694 homozygous mutation. Mean age of disease onset was lower in patient who had M694V homozygous mutation than M694V heterozygous mutation (p<0.001). Conclusion: The most common mutation in our patients is M694V mutation and it is significantly associated with arthritis, ELE, sacroiliitis, and amyloidosis. Tight control and regular treatment are important in FMF patients to protect from amyloidosis. Introduction: Deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 (DADA 2) is a rare autosomal recessive autoinflammatory condition. Recognised features include vasculitis predominantly affecting medium sized vessels, livedoid skin rash, central and peripheral nervous system involvement, variable degrees of immunodeficiency, and marrow failure amongst other clinical presentations. We present the case of a six year old male with DADA 2 who presented with acute testicular ischaemia secondary to vasculitis, the first such description in DADA2. Objectives: We wish to highlight the ever-expanding phenotype of DADA2, and to emphasise the ongoing controversies regarding management of this lifelong genetic disease. Improvements in our understanding of the pathogenesis will ultimately lead to better biomarkers, better treatments, and ultimately even cure using gene therapy based on the favourable clinical outcomes of patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT thus far. Methods: A six year old male presented acute right-sided testicular pain. His history included transient infantile neutropenia, resolved hepatosplenomegaly, and longstanding livedo racemosa, leading to screening and confirmation of DADA2 caused by homozygous c.139G>C(p.G47R) mutation of ADA2. As his only clinical feature was that of mild livedo racemosa with normal laboratory parameters at diagnosis, he was being actively monitored prior to starting any treatment. At a routine clinic follow-up a 24 hour history of testicular pain was noted on systems review; he was afebrile, and his only physical signs were that of moderate livedo racemosa, and tenderness of the right testicle. Laboratory parameters revealed C-reactive protein 8mg/L (reference range [RR]<20mg/L); erythrocyte sedimentation rate 28 mm/hr (RR<10); and serum amyloid A 5mg/L (RR<10). Ultrasound-scan of the scrotum revealed significantly reduced perfusion of the right testes, without torsion; and surgical scrotal exploration confirmed testicular ischaemia without torsion. Histology demonstrated ischaemic seminiferous tubules with intervening haemorrhage and acute inflammatory cells, consistent with vasculitis of the testis as the cause. He was treated with high dose intravenous methyl-prednisolone followed by a weaning course of oral prednisolone, and subcutaneous adalimumab (anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha, anti-TNF\u03b1). Repeat ultrasound-scan 3 weeks later revealed good testicular perfusion, with a small area of focal infarction. At last follow-up (11 months post-event) he remained asymptomatic, on treatment with adalimumab. Results: Figure 1 : Livedo racemosa noted on both lower limbs. Figure 2 : Doppler study of both testes (transverse views) showing globally reduced (but not absent) perfusion in the right testes compared to the left. Figure 3 : Photomicrograph of testicular biopsy showing patchy areas of tubular necrosis with loss of cellular and nuclear detail and nuclear 'smudging' (Right side) with more normal, viable tubules (Left side); H&E original magnification x100 Figure 4 : Acute phase markers before, during, and after acute testicular infarction in DADA2. Acute phase responses were completely normal prior to testicular infarction. C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) remained within the normal range throughout the episode and follow-up. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was normal, but was transiently modestly elevated on the day of tissue infarction (arrowed), remaining normal at follow-up. Conclusion: The phenotype of DADA2 continues to expand, and we add testicular infarction to the features of DADA2. CRP and SAA cannot be relied on as reliable biomarkers to predict tissue ischaemia and hence who to target for anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy in DADA2, since these remained steadfastly normal before, during, and after testicular infarction in this case Consent for publication has been obtained from patient Yes", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3387, "end": 3393, "text": "(3,5%)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 7013, "end": 7021, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 7067, "end": 7075, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7220, "end": 7228, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7464, "end": 7472, "text": "Figure 4", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "A novel duplication in the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein gene leading to recurrent hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis that is responsive to interleukin-1 blockade Dilan Dissanayake 1 , Rebecca Marsh 2 , Ahmed Naqvi 3 , Michael Jordan 2 , Rae Yeung 1 , Ronald Laxer 1 Introduction: We present here a 9 year-old male with recurrent episodes of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), characterized by fever, cytopenias, transaminitis, hyperferritinemia, hypofibrinogenemia, and elevated levels of soluble CD25 and soluble CD163, in whom we investigated for an underlying genetic defect. Methods: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from the patient and his family members for analysis using next generation sequencing by gene panels commonly associated with HLH and recurrent fever syndromes, followed by whole exome and whole genome sequencing.The patient's blood was also assessed using an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay for serum interleukin (IL)-18. Intracellular X-linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein (XIAP) levels were measured by flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).The function of XIAP was assessed by a previously established assay that measures intracellular cytokine staining for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) production following stimulation of PBMC by muramyl dipeptide (MDP), the ligand for the Nucleotide-binding Oligomerization Domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) receptor. Results: The HLH and recurrent fever syndrome gene panels, as well as whole exome sequencing were initially unable to identify a contributory variant in this patient.However, we strongly suspected a primary form of HLH after having measured persistently elevated levels of serum IL-18 to 2524 pg/ml in between episodes of HLH.Furthermore, we discovered a family history of recurrent fevers in the maternal grandfather, which was suspicious for an X-linked condition, such as XIAP deficiency. While awaiting results of whole genome sequencing, we performed flow cytometry for XIAP, which demonstrated reduced protein levels in the patient's T-lymphocyte, B-lymphocyte and natural killer cell populations.Subsequent results from whole genome sequencing demonstrated a large duplication spanning three exons within the XIAP gene, which was present in the patient, his asymptomatic mother, and his maternal grandfather. In addition to decreased protein expression, MDP stimulation of the patient's PBMC confirmed a significant functional defect in XIAP function downstream of the NOD2 receptor.While the above testing was being completed, the patient was started on anakinra and successfully weaned off steroids, with no further recurrences of HLH to date. Conclusion: This case describes the identification of a previously undescribed large duplication within the XIAP gene, which was initially not identified on gene panels and whole exome sequencing.This genetic variant is associated with reduced expression of XIAP in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as well as decreased function downstream of the NOD2 receptor.Interestingly, while patients with XIAP deficiency are typically treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, this patient has been successfully maintained on anakinra, suggesting an IL-1 dependent link between XIAP and recurrent HLH. We thereby illustrate the utility of combining genetic and molecular tools for the identification of contributors to unexplained autoinflammatory presentations, and present IL-1 blockade as a potential safe and effective alternative for some patients with XIAP deficiency. Introduction: In Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), other than amyloidosis factors affecting mortality are being debated. In our previous study, we did not observe any atherosclerotic plaque formation in carotid or femoral artery. We thought that the risk of atherosclerosis did not increase in patients diagnosed with FMF. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the 10 year prognosis and comorbidity of patients diagnosed with FMF who have been treated in our rheumatology clinic. Methods: The sample group is a subset of 2009 study. In 2009, the patients who already had myocardial infarction or cancer diagnosis were excluded. The patients were interviewed with polar questions of whether they were diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), cerebrovascular events, cancer, diabetes, and hypertension. Results: We studied 71 patients (37 males, 34 females; mean age: 49.66\u00b16.91) with FMF, and 59 patients (24 males, 35 females) in healthy control (HC) group. The gender and age difference between two groups was not found significant. During 10 year follow-up, 8% of FMF patients had either a cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event comparing to 5% in HC (p>0.05). 3% of FMF patients had a cancer diagnosis comparing to 3% in HC (p>0.05). Even though diabetes mellitus diagnosis rate was higher in FMF patients (15% to 10%), results were still not significant (p>0.05). Hypertension diagnosis was 5% higher in FMF group (p<0.05) Conclusion: Even though there was a significant increase in hypertension, increased diabetes, cancer, and AMI/Stroke ratio was not found significant when compared to the HCs.

PSTPIP1 was sequenced through Sanger Sequencing or targeted resequencing using a customized panel and analyzed with the NextSeq\u00ae platform (Illumina) Results: We describe 7 patients from 4 unrelated families with the E250K mutation in a mother and 2 siblings, the A230T variant in a father and his son and the R405C and D266N respectively in the last 2 unrelated patients. Disease onset occurred within the 7 th year of life in all patients. Patients 3 and 4 (table) presented since the 1st year of life recurrent episodes of fever without any cutaneous or articular symptoms. In both patients inflammatory markers were elevated during fever episodes but persistently negative during well-being not requiring any therapy. The variants described in these patients were not previously reported. However their pathogenic role is supported by the detection of markedly high serum calprotectin levels (>10.000 microg/ ml). The predominant feature of patients 1 and 2 was articular involvement with recurrent episodes of arthritis associated to acne. Patient 1 was initially treated with prednisone with good clinical response but relapse of arthritis at discontinuation followed bythe development of a sterile muscle abscess. An anti-TNF drug was started in both patients with complete clinical response. Patient 5 reported severe acne and psoriasis, and recurrent episodes of sterile arthritis. She presented a persistent elevation of acute phase reactants with severe anemia and leukopenia not resolving after splenectomy. His son (pts 6) presented with recurrent episodes of sterile arthritis, hepato-splenomegaly, anemia and neutropenia. Zinc and calprotectin serum levels resulted respectively 728 micromol/l and 2600 microg/ml. IL-1 inhibition determined a complete normalization of inflammatory parameters with no effects on anemia and neutropenia. In patient 6 zinchemia decreased to almost normal value after 4 months of therapy. Patient 7 presented at the age of 4 years a sterile lymphnode abscess.

Anakinra was proposed but not administered for poor compliance Conclusion: The clinical picture of patients carrying PSTPIP1 mutation may be heterogeneous. In our cohort TNF-inhibitors were successfully used in PAPA patients preventing new arthritis episodes and resolving cutaneous manifestation where present.

Defined IFN-mediated diseases were excluded. Patients with IFN-score above 10 underwent genetic screening by running a panel of 24 genes involved in interferonopathies Results: 10 pts followed in a pediatric rheumatology center were included. 7/10 presented with recurrent fever (table). Pts 2, 3 and 7 displayed neurological manifestation, respectively epilepsy, epilepsy and mental retardation and progressive hemiplegia. To note epilepsy in pts 2 might be due to a bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage presented at birth. In pts 1,4 gastrointestinal manifestation resembling inflammatory bowel diseases were described while pts 5,7 and 10 suffered from recurrent abdominal pain, diarrhea and patient 10 from hypertransaminasemia. Half of the patients complained arthromyalgia; arthritis developed in pts 2. Cutaneous involvement presented in pts 1,3,6 respectively with widespread panniculitis of trunk and limbs, aspecific vasculitis and Schonlein Henoch purpura (HSP). Other cutaneous manifestation were urticarial rash (pts2) and an erythematous, desquamative confluent eczema (pts 4). Autoimmunity was detected in 2/10 pts.

After few months the patient developed clinical and laboratory findings of HLH (Hemophagocytic Lympho-Histocytosis), confirmed on bone marrow samples; treatment with intravenous (IV) high dose (HD) steroids was started, with prompt response. During steroids tapering fever and systemic inflammation reappeared; anti-IL1 treatment (anakinra) was not effective.

Introduction: Transition is the period during which the young patient will move from the pediatric team to the adult team for the follow-up of his or her chronic disease. It requires perfect coordination between the two medical teams but also the active involvement of the young person and his or her family. A specific transition program increases the chances of good health and well-being and reduces mortality in this age group.

A total of 81% young patients came regularly (about once a year). Only 3 patients are currently out of sight (4%); none had a clearly identified single gene MAI requiring very regular follow-up. The young people interviewed are generally satisfied. Conclusion: No difference was observed in the transition efficacy process when comparing the two transition strategies (joint consultation or not). Joint consultation is experienced as necessary, but our results show that this strategy is not mandatory for a successful transition. When asked, young people are eager to have written documentation about their illness and to have the telephone number and e-mail address of the doctor to contact in case of problems. These positive results of the effectiveness of a transition program require close collaboration between the pediatrician and the adult physician regardless of the transition strategy chosen. The adult doctor must invest in taking care of young people who are very connected and in case of problems expect a quick response by email most often. Indeed, more than a joint consultation, the involvement of the adult physician seems essential to the successful transition from pediatrics to adult service. Introduction: Deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 (DADA2), is an autosomal recessive disease caused by biallelic loss-of-function mutations in the ADA2 gene. Deficiency of ADA2 is the first molecularly described monogenic vasculitis syndrome. In some cases, DADA2associated peripheral vascular disease (PVD) can be severe enough to require amputation.

Introduction: The dominantly inherited PAPA syndrome is caused by mutations in PSTPIP1. It is one of the least understood of the known monogenic autoinflammatory diseases, both from a pathogenic and treatment perspective.

Aldolase was elevated in 2/10. CK was elevated in 1/10. MRIs done on two patients with PAPA syndrome did not show muscle inflammation during a flare. Upon further analysis of LDH isoenzymes I-V tested in 12/20 patients with PAPA syndrome, 12/12 had elevated LDH isoenzyme V, a skeletal muscle isoenzyme. Conclusion: Our findings indicate an expanding clinical spectrum in PAPA syndrome that includes aseptic supraglottitis and non-bacterial osteomyelitis. Improvement in clinical symptoms, MRI findings, and acute phase reactants as well as a normal WBC on methylprednisolone support an inflammatory rather than infectious process. We do not have a clear understanding as to the relevance of elevation in LDH and aldolase in patients with PAPA syndrome and overall normal LDH and aldolase in the PAPA-like phenotype during periods of flare and no flare. LDH isoenzyme V and aldolase are markers of skeletal muscle involvement. In looking at muscle MRIs and obtaining CK levels, we did not see any muscle inflammation. Therefore, in addition to pursuing further testing to rule out muscle damage, additional etiologies for elevation of LDH and aldolase should be considered. Introduction: Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is an autoinflammatory disorder that causes recurrent fevers and painful serosal inflammation in the abdomen and pleura as well as synovial inflammation in the joints. Missense M694V, V726A, M694I, M680I and other mutations in exon 10 of the MEFV gene are well known to cause FMF, usually with a recessive mode of inheritance. The MEFV gene encodes pyrin, a key component of the pyrin inflammasome. FMF-associated mutations in pyrin cause dysregulated activation of the inflammasome, leading to activation of caspase, which converts pro-interleukin-1 (IL-1) beta to its active cleaved form.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Objectives: We obtained a Turkish kindred with multiple cases with Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) and Beh\u00e7et's disease (BD)-like manifestations.

The high frequency of affecteds could be consistent with a dominantly inherited inflammatory disease in this family, although other individuals had clinical features consistent with recessively inherited FMF. We sequenced DNA from members of this family to determine whether the TNFAIP3 frameshift mutation and MEFV variants could explain this autoinflammatory disease pedigree. Methods: Patients were clinically diagnosed to have FMF or BD.

Introduction: In 5%-10% of patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), colchicine is not effective in preventing inflammatory attacks. Furthermore, another 5%-10% of patients are intolerant to effective doses of colchicine and experience serious side effects. In recent years, it has been shown that interleukin-1 (IL-1) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of FMF.Several reports have pointed out the efficacy of IL-1 blockade in colchicine resistant FMF. Objectives: To review the patients followed with FMF who received anti-IL-1 treatment, in terms of outcome and side effects Methods: 18 FMF patients who were treated with anti-IL-1 treatment were retrospectively reviewed with regard to indication, effect on disease activity and acute phase response, adverse events and AIDAI score and patient global assessment. Colchicine resistance was defined as at least one attack per month for three consecutive months and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein in-between attacks despite taking adequate dose of colchicine. Results: There were 18 patients with FMF (9 M/ 9 F) who were treated with Anakinra and Canakinumab for various indications (colchicine resistant recurrent febrile attacks in 16, colchicine related side effects in 1, subclinic inflamation in 1). 11 patients were treated with Anakinra while were 15 patients with Canakinumab.

All patients were taking adequate dose of colchicine for their age before treatment with a median dosage of 0,03 \u00b10,012 mg/kg/day before anti-IL-1 treatment (0.03-0.06 mg/kg/day). 11 patients were treated with anakinra with a median duration of 29,7 months (8-60 months), but 6 of them switched to canakinumab because of noncompliance and side affects (2 headache, 1 urticerial rash), all responded.After the initiation of Anakinra treatment 6 patients became attackfree, 2 patients reported more than 50% decrease, and 3 patients no change in the frequency of the attacks. 15 patients were treated with Canakinumab but 2 (%13,3) of them swiched to anakinra because had increase in frequency of the attacks.

Introduction: Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is a monogenic autoinflammatory disease characterized by recurrent polyserositis attacks, mainly involving peritoneum, pleura and synovium. Erysipelas-like erythema (ELE) is an aseptic neutrophilic dermatose defined as well-demarcated, warm, tender, erythematous and infiltrated plaques which resolves spontaneously in 2-3 days. ELE is a pathognomic cutaneous manifestation of FMF. The reported frequency of ELE is 5-30 % in different populations. It typically developes on the extensor surface of lower extremities especially on dorsum of ankles and feet. It is usually unilateral and associated with more severe FMF clinical phenotype and M694V homozygosity.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Objectives: Here we would like to present a 12 year old girl admitted to the emergency service with an erythematous, painful rash at the dorsum of her foot.

The wide variety of referring specialities reflects the diverse nature of SAIDS and the importance of almost all specialities considering the possibility of SAIDS. Only just over 50% referrals had evidence of diseases falling within the recognised SAID spectrum and 26% of these have currently uncharacterised disease with non diagnostic genetic testing. Of those in whom a diagnosis could be made there are significant diagnostic delays fortunately despite late initiation of treatment no patients had evidence of systemic AA amyloidosis.

Objectives: This study aims to evaluate the diagnosis, treatment and use of genetic testing of patients diagnosed with periodic fever syndromes at a single tertiary paediatric hospital.

Genetic testing of between 1-26 genes was performed in 26 patients (60%).1-3 genes were tested in 13 patients, targeted panels in 10 patients, SNP only in 1 patient.Genetic variants were identified in 9 patients (34% of those tested) however only 2 of these variants were clearly pathogenic (7.7% of those tested). Clinical diagnosis and the Eurofever classification criteria were in agreement for patients diagnosed with CAPS (p=0.046) and TRAPS (p=0.025) but not for patients diagnosed with MKD (p=0.47).10 of the patients where clinical diagnosis and Eurofever classification criteria were in agreement had 2 diagnoses positive on the classification score.Two patients diagnosed with CAPS were exclusively positive for CAPS on the classification score and none of the patients diagnosed with TRAPS were exclusively positive for TRAPS.6 of the 7 TRAPS patients had a positive eurofever score for at least one PFS diagnosis. Conclusion: As reported in previous studies there was a significant delay between onset of symptoms and diagnosis.This reflects an ongoing need to raise awareness of these conditions with primary care providers. The large number of patients treated with multiple medications and the broad range of medications used reflects the lack of established treatment protocols and varied response to treatments in this group of patients. The clinical diagnosis and diagnostic score showed agreement for CAPS and TRAPs however many patients had a diagnostic score positive for more than one diagnosis meaning that a combination of clinical score and clinical judgement is required to make a diagnosis. Consistent with previous studies many patients with heterozygous mutations in genes associated with periodic fevers were identified.The significance of these variants is not clear and the diagnostic yield from genetic testing in this cohort was low. Further improvements in availability of next generation sequencing and molecular understanding of autoinflammatory conditions will hopefully improve this yield and allow more confident diagnoses and targeted therapies. Results: We identified 20 cases of PAMI syndrome in the literature. PAMI syndrome is an early onset inflammatory diseasewith a median age of 2.4 years. Clinical manifestations include Osteo-articular manifestations (80%), skin lesions (71%), splenomegaly (89%), hepatomegaly (68%), lymphadenopathy (42%), growth failure (58%) and hemorragic diasthesis withrecurrent epistaxis and/or haematoma tendency in 5 patients. All cases had relevant abnormalities in hematologic parameters:mild to severe neutropenia and anemia (100%). Thrombocytopenia (42%). Systemic inflammation was confirmed in 94% using the monitoring of CRP, ESR or SAA. Zinc and MRP 8/14 blood concentrations were markedly elevated in all tested patients. Genetic analyses of PSTPIP1 gene revealed the two specific identified mutations (p.E250K and p.E257K) in all patients. Response to the treatment was variable with no consistently effective therapy. Most common therapeutic optionswere AINS, Corticosteroids (n=9), Anakinra (n=9), Anti-TNF (n=6) and Cyclosporine A (n=4). Conclusion: PAMI syndrome is a rare auto inflammatory condition which should be considered in patients with undefined systemic inflammation and neutropenia, even without skin or osteo-articular manifestations. Zinc and serum MRP 14/8measurement may be helpful tools for the diagnostic orientation in these cases. Introduction: Autoinflammatory diseases, periodic fever syndromes, are a group of diseases that develop recurrent inflammatory response in the absence of infection. Familial Mediterranean fever, which is the most common disease among autoinflammatory diseases, is caused by mutant pyrin production due to mutations in MEFV gene. Pyrin protein is thought to be involved in inflammatory pathways by means of protein-protein interactions. There are studies supporting the role of pyrin as a proinflammatory regulator in the literature and involved in pathways associated with cell migration.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of pyrin inflammasome on cell migration in FMF patients, in CAPS patient as disease control and healthy controls.

Lipopolysaccharide was used to induce the activation of inflammasome in the cells, while arachidonic acid was used for the inhibition of inflammasome.

Conclusion: These findings support the idea of increased cell migration ratio in patients with FMF due to the more active pyrin inflammasome seen in patients.

Conclusion: Our preliminary data is the first study identified cell migration defect seen in HIDS. Due to the mutant protein produced as a result of MVK gene mutations, the deficiency in the function of the mevolanate kinase enzyme observed in HIDS leads to the depletion of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, a key substrate for protein prenylation.Considering the close relationship between protein prenylation and cytoskeleton elements related with cell migration, a possible decrease in prenylation may be a potential explanation of cell migration defect seen in HIDS patients. Introduction: Systemic Auto Inflammatory Diseases (SAID) is a group of rare and hereditary periodic fever syndromes with recurrent inflammatory involvement developing in the absence of infection.

Introduction: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) can be complicated by inflammatory (AA) amyloidosis, but the reason why only some patients will develop amyloidosis is not completely understood. Objectives: To assess gut microbiota composition and inflammatory markers in FMF patients complicated or not by AA amyloidosis. Methods: We included 34 FMF patients without AA amyloidosis, 7 FMF patients with AA amyloidosis, 19 patients with AA amyloidosis from another origin, and 26 controls. The gut microbiota was studied by 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Associations between bacterial taxa and clinical phenotype were evaluated using the multivariate association with linear models (MaAsLin) statistical method. Blood dosages of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 were carried out by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Compared to healthy subjects, significant decreases in \u03b1diversity were noted in FMF patients without amyloidosis and in patients with non-FMF-related AA amyloidosis. \u03b2-diversity analysis also showed significant differences between healthy controls and two same groups. After multivariate association testing with the MaAsLin statistical method to control for the effects of potential confounding factors (such as age, gender, body mass index and treatments), several operational taxonomic units belonging to the Clostridiales order were associated with FMF. Moreover, 2 operational taxonomic units belonging to the Clostridiales order were overrepresented in FMFrelated AA amyloidosis compared to FMF patients without AA amyloidosis. All studied groups had higher blood levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 than controls. Conclusion: FMF was associated with a gut microbiota dysbiosis characterized by a decreased \u03b1-diversity and a significant alteration in composition. Although these results are descriptive, they suggest that the gut microbiota might be involved in the clinical expression of FMF. In FMF patients, amyloidosis was independently associated with a specific alteration in the microbiota composition, suggesting that the gut microbiota may play a role in AA amyloidosis pathogenesis. These data need to be further consolidated in mechanistic and interventional studies.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patient and 3 healthy controls were stimulated with NF-kB inducers (TNFa and LPS or left untreated. Phosphorylated IkBa, as a measure of NF-kB activation, was measured by Luminex technology. PBMCs were stimulated with different ligands (TNFa and LPS and muramyl dipeptide (MDP) or left untreated for 16 hrs. Proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6, IL-18, and TNFa) were measured in the supernatants using Mesoscale U-plex multiplex assays. Results: Sanger sequencing identified a heterozygous variant (c.175G>C, p.A59P) in the autoinhibitory PYD domain of NLRP1. The variant has a high CADD score of 24.1 predicting a high likelihood of deleteriousness and is not present in the gnomAD database. The sequencing revealed other variants (p.L155H, p.V1063M and p.M1188V) with high minor allele frequencies, most likely benign. Family analysis showed that A59P and L155H were carried by the father and the grandfather's brother but none by the mother. Patient PBMCs demonstrated significantly increased levels of Ser32/ 36 phosphorylated IkBa in response to TNFa and LPS stimulation compared to controls, indicating increased NF-kB activation. In response to especially MDP, but also TNFa stimulation, patient PBMCs expressed extremely high levels of IL-1b and IL-6 and increased IL-18 levels in unstimulated PBMCs compared to controls. Clinically and biochemically the patient responded well to monthly treatment with subcutaneous canakinumab (5 mg/kg) with rapid improvement of the gingivitis, and ophthalmologically administration of diluted anakinra (2.5% solution) as 1 eye-droplet three times per day had a dramatic effect on ocular pain and inflammation. Conclusion: We here report A59P NLRP1 as a novel defect causing inflammasome hyperactivation/autoinflammatory disease and a clinical picture including severe inflammation of the gingival mucosa and keratitis in a 5-year-old boy with a family history suggesting HBID. Patient PBMCs exhibited increased NF-kB activation and elevated levels of IL-1 and IL-6 in response to proinflammatory stimuli. Thus, our results enabled us to select relevant targeted therapy deploying IL-1binhibition with systemic canakinumab and topical anakinra. Introduction: NOD2 is crucial for innate immune response and mainly expressed in hematopoietic lineage cells, especially in monocytic cells. On the recognition of its ligand, muramyl dipeptide (MDP), NOD2 leads to activation of NF-\u03baB pathway, causing upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Objectives: Mutations of NOD2 have been associated with Blau syndrome, but the details regarding mechanisms associated mutant NOD2 leads to granuloma formation are still unclear. By using iPS cells derived from the patients, we tried to reveal the molecular mechanism of Blau syndrome. Methods: The iPS cells with R334W mutation in NOD2 have been established from a Blau patient and we corrected the mutation of the iPS cells into wild type (WT) by using a CRISPR-Cas9 system. These isogenic iPS cells were differentiated into monocytic cell lineages, then transfected with the lentiviral vectors and maintained in the StemPro-34 medium with M-CSF and GM-CSF. Results: IFN\u03b3 induced the same upregulation of NOD2 in iPS-derived monocytes with WT and those with R334W. Without MDP stimulation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production was only found in those with mutant NOD2, suggesting that Blau-associated NOD2 is gain-offunction mutation. However, after stimulating with MDP, the R334W mutant cells showed NF-\u03baB pathway activation and cytokine secretions less than WT cells even with or without IFN\u03b3 treatment. On the other hand, both the cell groups showed the comparative immune response to TNF\u03b1 and LPS treatment, unrelated to NOD2 mutation. Conclusion: The response to MDP by mutant NOD2 was selectively impaired in Blau syndrome, that may incompletely lead to neutrophilic inflammation but compensatively induce granuloma formation in host defense. Introduction: Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is the most common hereditary SAID, with a high prevalence in patients of eastern Mediterranean decent. It is known as an autosomal dominant disease with mutations in the MEFV gene that encodes for Pyrin, an important innate immunity regulator. However, some heterozygous individuals also show an FMF phenotype, which leads to the assumption that other modifying factors lead to a manifestation of the phenotype 1 . In recent years, DNA methylation has demonstrated suitable as biomarker and its potential for disease diagnosis by several studies. DNA methylation plays an important epigenetic regulatory effect on gene expression, and aberrances can result in pathological disease states. Objectives: The main goal of this study was to evaluate the DNA methylation in patients carrying heterozygous mutations in the MEFV gene but show different phenotypes. We hypothesis that alterations in DNA methylation can add important and valuable information about the disease etiopathogenesis. Methods: The study included 32 patients, 12 of the patients show a typical FMF phenotype and SNP analysis showed a heterozygous mutation, 9 patients showed similar heterozygous mutations but lack FMF characteristics and are healthy. We also included 12 control samples without any mutation in the MEFV gene. We performed a genome wide DNA methylation analysis using Illumina's EPIC BeadArray, interrogating over 850.000 CpG sites at single C resolution covering the first exon of >84% of all Genes 2 . The results were processed and normalized using the R package Champ 3 and group comparisons were performed with limma 4 . Results: In total four different group comparisons were calculated including Heterozygous Healthy vs. Heterozygous Disease, Heterozygous Healthy vs. Control, Heterozygous Disease vs. Control and Heterozygous (Disease + Healthy) vs. Control. Each comparison revealed over 30000 significant cpgs (p<0.05) where between 28 and 75 cpgs showed at least 15% differences in mean methylation between the groups. Eighty of the significant cpgs were present in every group comparison covering 62 unique genes. During hierarchical clustering the three clusters separated visibly, where two Heterozygous Healthy patients cluster within the control samples. A group comparison between the two Heterozygous groups revealed 71 differentially methylated sites (p<0.05, difference \u2265 15%), able to separate the two groups. Conclusion: During our experiments we were able to detect differentially methylated sites separating Heterozygous Healthy and Heterozygous Disease patients. We hypothesize that the identified CpG sites can contribute to provide information to the etiopathogenesis of FMF in general. Introduction: Seemingly unprovoked trafficking of neutrophils to the serosal/synovial membranes is a key event in acute inflammatory attacks of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). Migratory events behind abnormal trafficking of the cells remain largely unknown. Objectives: The aim of the present study is to analyze kinetic of actin polymerization and migration rate of neutrophils from colchicine na\u00efve and colchicine receiving FMF patients. Methods: FMF patients in acute attack (colchicine na\u00efve A-FMF), FMF patients in remission period (receiving colchicine, R-FMF), and healthy controls (HD) were enrolled in the study. We have measured the amounts of F-actin in untreated and pre-treated with colchicine neutrophils induced by fMLP at 5s, 15s, 30s, 60s, 120s, and 180s time points in vitro. Actin polymerization was investigated by flow cytometry using FITC-Phalloidin. Neutrophils migration to fMLP was assessed using Transwell cell migration assay. Results: Neutrophils from A-FMF displayed higher migration rate compared to R-FMF and HD (P< 0.05). R-FMF patients, who were receiving colchicine, displayed the lowest actin polymerization activity in neutrophils at all-time points. The cells from FMF patients in A-FMF stimulated with fMLP displayed a maximal F-actin polymerization earlier (at 5s) than in R-FMF (at 30s) and HD (at 15s) (P< 0.05). In opposite, plateau levels of F-actin content were reached earlier in HD neutrophils (after 1 min), while plateau levels in A-FMF and R-FMF cells were reached later (after 2 min). Colchicinepretreated cells in all studied groups reached maximal F-actin polymerization later than in untreated with colchicine cells, namely at 15s in A-FMF and 30s in R-FMF and HD groups. Conclusion: We have demonstrated actin dysfunctions in neutrophils from FMF patients which might cause defects in neutrophil functioning. The results suggest that colchicine may affect actin polymerization in the cells due to unknown mechanism.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Introduction: Blau syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from genetic variants in the CARD15 gene previously known as NOD2. It is characterized by a clinical triad of arthritis, uveitis and skin rash. Classic features also include skin lesion with non-caseating granulomas, boggy synovitis or tenosynovitis and camptodactyly. CARD15 gene comprises eleven exons encoding for a 1044 amino acid protein. The protein has N-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) linked to a nucleotide binding domain (NBD) and C-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). Objectives: The objective of the study was to determine the underlying genetic variants in our cohort of patients with Blau syndrome and to establish a genotype-phenotype correlation if any. Methods: Genetic variants in CARD15 were determined in 11 of our patients with Blau syndrome. Targeted next-generation sequencing was employed to detect these variants in six patients at the Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genoa, Italy. In rest of the 5 patients, conventional Sanger sequencing was used. Since most of the variants have been detected in Exon 4, the exon4 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Four pairs of specific primers described in Resource of Asian Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases Database were used for amplification of the Exon 4 and the PCR amplifications generated were sequenced using conventional Sanger sequencing. Results: Single nucleotide substitutions resulting in missense variants were detected in all of the eleven patients. Nine of the eleven patients had a recurrent, previously reported missense variant in Exon 4 which encodes for the nucleotide binding domain (NBD). This variant resulting from the substitution of Thymine for cytosine at c.1000; c.1000C>T causes the replacement of Arginine with Tryptophan at codon 344; p.R344W. This variant has been reported in the Infevers database. Three of the nine patients with this variant were related, an affected mother with her son and daughter. Rest of the six were from unrelated families. However, six of the nine patients were from the north Indian state of Haryana, and one was from the adjoining northern state of Punjab. The remaining two patients were from the eastern part of India. Two patients had another missense variant in the Exon 4; p.G299D with replacement of Glycine with Aspartic acid at codon 299. This variant has not been reported in the Infevers database or the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD), but it has been reported in the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC). Conclusion: The detection of a similar previously reported missense variant in 9 of the 11 patients might denote a founder mutation especially given the fact that seven of the nine patients with the p.R344W variant were from the same geographical locale in North India. This recurrent variant also provides an opportunity for development of an amplification-refractory mutation system for its detection without resorting to sequencing.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest None Declared"}, {"text": "Differential activation of the Pyrin inflammasome in monocytes and macrophages predicts the pathological significance of MEFV variants in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) patients Takeshi Shiba 1 , Takayuki Tanaka 1 , Hiroaki Ida 2 , Misa Watanabe 3 , Haruna Nakaseko 4 , Mitsujiro Osawa 5 , Hirofumi Shibata 1 , Kazushi Izawa 1 , Takahiro Yasumi 1 , Yuri Kawasaki 5 , Megumu K.

Objectives: To determine the effect of MEFV variants on IL-1\u03b2 production by monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages from Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) patients and to extend this approach to the functional evaluation of rare MEFV variants. Methods: Freshly isolated monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages from patients with typical FMF and healthy donors were analyzed for IL-1\u03b2 secretion in response to the pyrin inflammasome activator Clostridium difficile toxin A (TcdA). Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) clones derived from FMF patients and healthy donors were differentiated into macrophages and analyzed for pyrin inflammasome activation. Rare MEFV variants were expressed in iPSCderived macrophages. Results: IL-1\u03b2 secretion by FMF monocytes in response to TcdA was comparable to that of healthy donors, and colchicine inhibited IL-1\u03b2 secretion from healthy donors, but not from FMF monocytes. FMF macrophages secreted significantly higher levels of IL-1\u03b2 than healthy donor macrophages, and their IL-1\u03b2 secretion could be inhibited with colchicine. The characteristics observed in monocyte-derived macrophages were recapitulated in iPSC-derived macrophages. Finally, iPSC-derived macrophages transgenically expressing the N679H variant were functionally similar to those expressing the pathogenic MEFV variant M694I, while cells expressing the T577N variant had a similar phenotype as control cells. Conclusion: While FMF monocytes carrying the typical MEFV mutations were distinct from healthy monocytes in their unresponsiveness to colchicine, FMF macrophages showed hyperactivation of the pyrin inflammasome and were sensitive to colchicine inhibition. Our novel approach may be useful for identifying MEFV variants that cause the typical FMF phenotype according to their capacity to induce pyrin inflammasome activation. Introduction: Cytoplasmic sensing of nucleic acids via cGAS-TBK1 pathway leads to type I interferon (IFN) production. DNase2 deficiency impairs DNA digestion in phagosomes resulting in cGAS-dependent IFN hyperproduction (1) . However, other sensors like TLRs can stimulate this pathway, as recently shown in animal models (2) . Objectives: To investigate the interaction between cGAS and TLRs stimulation in DNAse2-deficient fibroblasts. Methods: Fibroblasts from a subject with DNase2 deficiency and from healthy controls were treated with different Multiplicity Of Infection (MOI) of E. coli and concentration of bacterial LPS, 2'3'-cGAMP and Poly(I:C) for 1 hour. After stimulation, phosphorilated-TBK1 was measured by flowcytometry with intracellular staining. Results: Fibroblasts with DNase2 deficiency responded to an overload of bacteria with a greater activation of the IFN pathway compared to healthy controls. DNase2-mutated cells showed an enhanced IFN response even after stimulation with pure E. coli derived-LPS (Tab. 1). Moreover, the combined stimulation of the cGAS-STING pathway and on TLRs (cGAMP + LPS, cGAMP + Poly(I:C)) resulted in a synergic increase of TBK1 phosphorylation compared with any stimulus alone (Tab. 1). Conclusion: The possibility that the dysregulated IFN pathway in DNase2deficient fibroblasts may sensitise cells to an increased response to LPS is supported by others preliminary data (not shown) proving that intact STING is necessary for LPS-induced IFN production. Indeed, there are evidences that STING can be activated not only by 2'3'-cGAMP, but also by other molecules collecting the signals from distinct TLRs. Considering these results, we can assume that a dysfunctional IFN pathway could display a \"permissive\" role towards other stimuli acting on STING-TBK1 signaling. Ongoing experiments are being carried out to clarify the convergence of different TLRs stimuli on the cGAS-TBK1 axis. Introduction: SAIDs are a large and heterogeneous group of inflammatory conditions, including monogenetic and multifactorial diseases, associated with a dysregulation of innate immune system. Early diagnosis and treatment of these conditions are essential to prevent serious complications, in particular the development of amyloidosis. Biological treatments blocking the Interleukins (IL-) 1 and 6 can lead to rapid remission and are expected to improve long-term outcome in these patients. Five of them received an indication to be treated by these medications in Switzerland; therefore, we are interested to evaluate the number of patients who may receive these treatments. Objectives: To describe and estimate the prevalence of FMF, MKD, TRAPS, CAPS and SoJIA in Switzerland. Methods: This is a monocentric, prospective and descriptive cohort study, through the JIRcohorte platform. Patients with juvenile-onset sAIDs attending the pediatric rheumatology unit of Western Switzerland in the University Hospitals of Lausanne and Geneva were enrolled at the study until August 2018. AIDs included diagnosis of Systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SoJIA), Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), Mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD) and Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS Introduction: Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is characterized by recurrent attacks of fever, serositis and arthritis, but some patients may experience long-term complications of disease such as infertility/ subfertility.The published data about FMF associated infertility is still limited.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2664, "end": 2667, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2766, "end": 2769, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P1064"}, {"text": "Objectives: The aim of this study is to investigate the frequency and to determine potential factors for FMF associated infertility /subfertility.

Introduction: Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is a prototypic autoinflammatory disorder associated with MEFV pyrin-encoding gene mutations, characterized by unprovoked episodes of inflammation.

Methods: HiPSCs were generated from MEFV-mutant patients with clinical FMF and from healthy controls by reprogramming of peripheral blood-derived (PB) CD34+ HSCs. After confirmation of MEFV genotypes, HiPSCs were differentiated to monocytes using an embryoid body (EB)-based differentiation protocol. Terminally differentiated cells were phenotyped regarding extra-and intracellular marker expression as well as cell morphology and were subjected to different functional assays.

All cells expressed identical levels of CD14. Similar to our observations on primary monocytes from FMF patients and controls both CD14 and CD16 expression was lowest on p.M694V homozygous hiPSC derived monocytes. On the contrary intracellular S100A9 and A12 expression in both primary as well as hiPSC derived monocytes increased with p.M694V gene dose. Correspondingly, p.M694V homozygous hiPSC-derived monocytes revealed increased S100A8 expression at base line and already spontaneous protein release in stimulation experiments. In contrast, Il1rn expression in p.M694V mutant hiPSC-derived monocytes was low compared to HCs. When induced by IFNa, Il1rn expression was reciprocal according to p.M694V gene dose. In similar lines, p.M694V mutant hiPSCderived monocytes revealed strongly decreased IL-10 expression on both gene and protein level compared to healthy control cells. Conclusion: We successfully generated mature monocytes from hiPSC derived from p.M694V hetero-and homozygous FMF-patients as well as healthy individuals. Apart from S100 proteins p.M694V mutant cells did not reveal a pronounced overexpression of inflammatory cytokines but rather demonstrated an intrinsic lack of antiinflammatory counter-regulation on the level of IL-1Ra and IL-10 expression. Introduction: Monoallelic gain-of-function NLRP3 mutations are the genetic cause of the dominantly-inherited cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), which represent the prototypical early-onset, interleukin-1b-mediated disease (1). Post-zygotic NLRP3 mutations leading to somatic mosaicism have been shown as the disease-causing mechanism in a moderate, but increasing number of patients (2) (3) . Recent reports have also shown that somatic NLRP3 mosaicism may appear later in life, leading to forms of the disease that started during adulthood (4) (5) (6) (7) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2018, "end": 2021, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2022, "end": 2025, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2176, "end": 2179, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2180, "end": 2183, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2184, "end": 2187, "text": "(6)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2188, "end": 2191, "text": "(7)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Objectives: To describe the clinical, analytical and genetic features as well as the outcome of administered treatments in three unrelated Spanish patients with late-onset CAPS carrying somatic NLRP3 mosaicism.

Microsatellites analysis was used to test the intra-familial segregation of the identified variant and to look for a founder effect. Functional analyses included the study of (i) ASC speck formation in HEK293T cells (stably expressing ASC-GFP and pro-caspase1-FLAG) transiently expressing the wild-type or mutated NLRP3 protein, (ii) IL1\u03b2 secretion from transfected THP1 cells, and (iii) inflammasome-related gene expression and cytokine secretion from monocytes isolated from patients in crisis (probands from the two families), related patients out of crisis, and from controls. Results: The same heterozygous mutation (c.1322C>T, p.A441V) in NLRP3 exon 3, segregating with the disease within the first family, was identified in the two families which were shown to share the same mutation-associated NLRP3 haplotype. HEK293T cells transfected with the pNLRP3-A441V construct showed a significantly higher percentage of ASC specks, a common readout of inflammasome activation, as compared to cells transfected with pNLRP3-WT. Transfection of THP1 cells with pNLRP3-A441V led to significantly higher levels of secreted IL1\u03b2, a hallmark of inflammasome activation, as compared to cells transfected with pNLRP3-WT. Monocyte inflammasome-related gene expression and cytokine secretion profile was similar in patients out of crisis and in the healthy controls. However, the expression of the inflammasome-related genes in the two probands was different from that of patients without crisis and healthy controls. In addition, this expression pattern was found to be differentially regulated between the two probands, correlating with their phenotypic status. Conclusion: These molecular and cellular findings, which indicate a founder effect in these two families, clearly demonstrate the pathogenicity of the p.A441V missense mutation in CAPS and point to the interest of studying patients' primary cells to assess disease activity.

Introduction: Adenosine Deaminase 2 deficiency (DADA2) is an autosomal recessive autoinflammatory disease caused by loss of function mutations in the ADA2 gene, located on chromosome 22q11.1. The clinical spectrum of the disease is heterogeneous, ranging from multisystemic inflammation with vascular and multiorgan involvement to immunodeficiency and immunedysregulation. 1 A small proportion of patients, despite consistent phenotype and lack of ADA2 enzymatic activity, has an incomplete or negative genotype.

At 1-year old inflammatory symptoms became persistent and the patient developed hypertension and a severe dilatative myocarditis, responsive to high doses of steroids. Anakinra was not effective, hence steroid therapy could not be suspended for years. Hypogammaglobulinemia was also present, together with recurrent upper airways infections.

Introduction: Monogenic autoinflammatory diseases (AID) are severe lifelong systemic inflammatory disorders with dysregulated innate immunity, causing significant morbidity, mortality, and economic burden. Often these diseases present with isolated central nervous system (CNS) involvement and mimic other noninflammatory CNS disorders. This significantly hampers the clinical management of these patients, who are subjected to expensive and often invasive diagnostic patient pathways. Securing a molecular diagnosis is of major importance in these cases for treatment, prognosis, and genetic counselling. Routine genetic screening is time-consuming, costly, and lacks sensitivity since only common disease harbouring exons of a minority of the known genes causing autoinflammation of the CNS are currently tested using Sanger sequencing. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) offers the ability to rapidly and cost-effectively screen all exons of a gene panel containing hundreds of genes. This approach has not yet been routinely introduced in the UK for these conditions. Somatic mosaicism may account for between 19 to 69% of these, from previous reports. Genetic heterogeneity has also been implicated in patients with CAPS-like phenotypes, with the identification of pathogenic mutations in the NLRP12, PLCG2 and NLRC4 genes (Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome subsets 2, 3 and 4, respectively).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results:"}, {"text": "To explore the genetic cause(s) in a paediatric cohort of mutation negative CAPS patients using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques, by assessing:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Objectives:"}, {"text": "1. the rate of somatic NLRP3 mosaicism, and 2. possible contribution of other/novel genes", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Objectives:"}, {"text": "Patients from a single paediatric centre who met the CAPS diagnostic criteria and had no NLRP3 mutations identified by partial (exons 3, 4 and 6) or total Sanger sequencing, were identified.

Introduction: Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is a chronic autosomal recessive autoinflammatory disease with very high incidence and prevalence in Armenians. First information about recurrent inflammatory syndrome or polyserositis in Armenians was reported in ancient manuscripts of XII Century. It has been confirmed that MEFV (Mediterranean Fever) gene mutations play the main role in occurrence of severity of this disorder. MEFV gene encodes pyrin, the most important regulator of immunity processes. Mutated pyrin is responsible for inflammasome formation and increased inflammatory response. It was reported in \"Infever Database\" (2015) that more than 310 sequence variants of MEFV gene are revealed in 10 exons of Mediterranean Fever gene. The carrier rate of MEFV gene mutations is extremely high (about one in three) in Armenians. Distribution and spectrum of MEFV gene mutations are responsible for mild and severe forms of recurrent febrile and pain attacks, periodic episodes of fever, peritonitis, pleuritic, erysipelas-like skin lesions, arthralgia. Although FMF is autosomal recessive condition, but in more than 19% of our cohort of FMF patients have been shown to exhibit the same symptoms with heterozygous genotypes. In some heterozygous cases we detected atypical clinical forms of FMF. Objectives: In some FMF patients \"mild\" MEFV mutations, such as P369S, A744S and E148Q, are responsible for the determination of severity of attacks in FMF, along with environmental or possible other genetic factors associated with inflammatory attacks. We have identified E148Q mutation in exon 2 of MEFV gene in three individuals of three generations of one family with confirmed clinical diagnosis of FMF. Methods: They were genotyped using Viennalab Reverse Hybridization Strip Assay (Austria). Genetic and clinical data of more than 36000 individuals, including FMF patients and their family members, revealed statistically significance of phenotypes and distribution ofMEFV mutations covering more than 98% of the cases. Results: In this family report we present the three FMF patients, including two males and one female of three generations. In the first generation 50 y.o. female has typical clinical FMF with periodic episodes for 1-2 days duration of fever, abdominalgia, thoracalgia, arthralgia, hepato-and splenomegaly. Disease manifested in age of 16 years old. Genetic investigation identified heterozygous E148Q mutation of exon 2. Treatment with Colchicine decreased the intensity of attacks to one-two episodes annually. The son of this patient also inherited the same heterozygous E148Q mutation.The disease onset with first attacks was observed when the boy was in age of 7 years old. The recurrent fever attacks of abdominal pain, myalgia had occurred for 5-6 days. Colchicine treatment decreased the frequency of attacks to 2-4 annually. His son also inherited the same E148Q heterozygous genotype from his grandmother and father. The boy was born in 2018. The disease manifested in 8 months with fever attacks. Introduction: Sporadic cases with adult Cryopyrin Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS) are associated with a somatic mutation in the NLRP3 gene, often restricted to the myeloid lineage. Objectives: We investigatedif mutations in myeloprliferative genes that are known to drive age related clonal heatopoiesis (ARCH) associated with the development of CAPS in a late onset case. Methods: We sequenced 26autoinflammatory and 52 myeloproliferative genes in peripheral bloodDNA ofa 56 year oldpatient with late onsetCAPS, by the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) method. The pathogenic mutations were screened in DNA derived from FACS-sorted CD3-positive T cells, CD14positivemonocytes and granulocytes, and from single cells. Results: A somatic NLRP3 mutation, NM_001243133.1:c.1709A>Gp.-Tyr570Cys, was present in DNA purified from granulocytes or monocytes (20% NLRP3 gene reads) but was hardly detected in the patient's DNA from T cells (1%). Two pathogenic mutations linked with myeloproliferative disorders were detected: A known frame shiftmutation in the Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 gene (TET2, in 31% ofthegene reads), and a known amino acid substitution in the Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2, in 43% of the SRSF2 reads). Both had the same lineage pattern asthe NLRP3 mutation, yet a higher somatic mosaicism rate than the NLRP3 mutation in peripheral blood cells (PBC). Co-occurence of the NLRP3 mutation with one or two loss-of-function TET2 allele(s) was demonstrated in several single myeloid cells. There was no evidence of hematologic malignancy in the bone marrow or in a CT scan of the patient. Rather, the patient developed macrophage activating syndrome (MAS) that was also the cause of death after 8 years of disease. Conclusion: Our results suggest the need to evaluate sporadic late onset CAPS cases for clonality of myeloproliferative genes, with prospect of dynamic and severe disease evolution, including MAS. In the case of TET2deficiency mutations a proinflammatory effect through the NLRP3 inflammasome may be suggested based on mice models. Clonal autoinflammatory diseases may constitute a distinct entity within the autoinflammatory diseases, characterized by clinical complexity and imposing therapeutic challenges. Introduction: Diagnostic CNV (copy number variation) analysis in molecular genetics with exon level resolution is performed mainly by hybridization techniques (e.g. multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification). Therefore, the examinable genomic region is restricted to commercially available test kits in most cases. Objectives: The amount of clinically relevant CNVs located beyond the examinable region of these kits remains elusive. Hence, a bioinformatic pipeline for the detection of CNVs from NGS sequencing data was established (MIDAS pipeline). The analysis is routinely performed for patient samples in parallel to NGS testing for single nucleotide variations and small insertions/deletions by targeted enrichment and sequencing of candidate genes. Methods: DNA samples from 115 patients with suspected autoinflammatory disease were subjected to NGS panel diagnostics including the genes ELANE, IL1RN, IL36RN, LPIN2, MEFV, MVK, NLRC4, NLRP3, NLRP12, NOD2, PSMB8, PSTPIP1, TMEM173, TNFRSF1A. With the exception of MEFV, no commercial CNV detection kits are available for these genes. In addition to routine NGS testing, binary alignment mapping files (BAM) were further analyzed via the MIDAS CNV pipeline. Coverage of targeted regions was normalized with control samples. CNV calls were performed using CoNVaDING, ExomeDepth and XHMM. Results were further investigated if CNVs were called from two out of three callers. Results: Testing in a two-year-old Polish girl presenting with recurrent fever of unknown origin and an increased susceptibility to infections revealed a heterozygous deletion of at least 321 bp comprising exon 5 of the NLRP12 gene (rsa[GRCh37] 19q13.42(54308439_54308760x1, 54310745x2). The deletion was confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and was not present in 240 control individuals. Conclusion: There are known truncating germline mutations in the NLRP12 gene, but no larger deletions have been described in association with the rare familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome 2 (FCAS2) so far. According to Richards et al. (2015) the variant was classified as likely pathogenic, which supports the clinical diagnosis of FCAS2 in the patient. The case described shows that application of CNV analysis of NGS data may increase the diagnostic sensitivity for the molecular diagnostics of hereditary recurrent fever. It is a cost efficient and convenient method to screen for copy number variations beyond regions which are covered by commercially available CNV detection kits. Since very few patients with FCAS2 have been identified, data on the phenotypic presentation is limited. Interestingly, Kostik et al. Methods: Random sample of 290 unrelated persons residing in Armenia, 179 of whom were female and 111 were male were selected. Blood samples were taken from them and analyzed. Identification of FMF and SAA1 gene mutations for 12 more common types of mutations based on PCR and reverse hybridization using Vienna-Lab diagnostic test was performed. Results: This is the first population based study of carrying of FMF gene mutations among Armenian ethnic population in Armenia. Out of 290 participants 98 persons have at least one mutation, among which 59 were female carriers and 39 -male. That makes up 33.45% of the total participants. Out of 98 carriers 87 had heterozygous mode of inheritance, while 10 had compound-heterozygous and 1 had homozygous mode of inheritance. Rate of mutation carriers among female participants was 1 out of 3. In female group 55 had heterozygous mode of inheritance (30.73%) and 4 had compound-heterozygous mode of inheritance (2.23%). Following mutations were found in this group: M694V, M680I, V726A, E148Q, K695R, A744S, R761H, F479L and P369S Highest number of cases of identified in female group was M694V (Table1). Rate of mutation carriers among male participants was 1 out of 3. In male group 32 had heterozygous mode of inheritance (28.83%), 6 had compound-heterozygous mode of inheritance (5.4%) and 1 had homozygous mode of inheritance (0.9%). Following mutations were found in this group: V726A, M694V, E148Q, M680I, M694I, A744S and F479L. V726A was identified 17 times in male group (Table1). Conclusion: The frequency of carrying the FMF gene mutation 1:3 is highest among ever reported. Most common type is heterozygous mode of inheritance, which constituted for 88.8% among all carriers. The most common mutation among all carriers is M694V -32 cases, a little less -is carriage of V726A mutation (30 cases). At the third place -is carriage of \u0415148Q mutation (23 cases). Introduction: Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO), is an autoinflammatory disorder with incidence varying between 1 -4 per million and it is most likely due to defects in TLR4/MAPK leading to in anti-and pro-inflammatory cytokine balance (ORPHA: 324964, PMID:29080202). CRMO occurs in childhood and adolescence, characterized with recurrent inflammation and lesions that are predominantly found in long bones. Reported familial cases and associated inflammatory conditions indicate genetic predisposition in the pathogenesis. Objectives: In this study, we examined a consanguineous family with 2 affected and 1 healthy siblings and their healthy parents to identify the possible causative locus or gene. Methods: Whole genome SNP genotyping by using Illumina OmniExpress-24 BeadChip that targets~700,000 SNP markers was performed on all the family members that consists of 2 affected sibs, 1 healthy sister and their healthy parents. Resulting genotyping data was used for multipoint parametric linkage analysis that was performed under recessive model with complete penetrance. One of the affected siblings was screened by whole exome genotyping for assessment of possible disease-causing rare, homozygous variants. Variants obtained after filtration of exome data was furthered verified with the linkage analyses data. Results: Linkage analyses revealed 137 homozygous regions out of which 44 are longer than 200 kb. Non-synonymous and homozygous variants gathered from the exome data were further filtrated according to 1000G and ExAC databases (MAF < 0.05), revealing 11 candidate variants in NBPF6, DNAH14, MMADHC, KIAA0232, BODIL1, PCDHGB2, PCDHGA6, ZNF316, PWWP2B, CFAB46 and CARNS1. Also, variants in the genes that are listed in Infevers database were checked which revealed 4 intronic variants in NLRP3, NLRC4, PSMA3 and PSTPIP1 genes. Among these variants, rs12786101 in CARNS1 (c.C1145T) and rs55638726 in NLRC4 (g.32461493_32461494insC) were chosen as candidate variants. Conclusion: One of the candidate variants that might be related to CRMO phenotype is located in CARNS1 leading to a missense mutation whereas rs55638726 in NLRC4 is found to be located in the splice site that might lead to aberrant splicing. However, these variants were found in homozygous regions that were shared in all the family members. Identification of disease causing potential of the detected variants are still on-going.

But HLA B27 antigen was present just in 5 among 14 pts. Psoriasis of the palmar-plantar localization -in 1 patient; acnae conglobata -1. Inflammatory bowel disease, uveitis -not identified. Laboratory parameters of activity were detected in the active period of the disease in 6 pnts: ESR acceleration up to 40 mm/h, increase in CRP -up to 73 mg/l; these patients had manifestations of chronic arthritis. Treatment included NSAIDs (all), methotrexate (n=4), sulfasalazine (n=3), bisphosphonates (n=5), TNF inhibitors (n=6). Orthopedic measures: regimen with restriction of movements; during the destruction of the vertebrae, a corset was used (n=3), an operation with the fixation of the vertebrae with metal construction (n=3).

Objectives: We present herein a case of recurrent pericarditis well controlled by Anakinra, that became Anakinra-depent and relapsed after switching to Canakinumab, a recombinant human interleukin-1beta competitive receptor antagonist. Results: Results: in September 2008, S.S., a 14-years old boy (weight 69,8 kg, height 160 cm) was admitted in our Emergency Department complaining of three days of acute chest pain that increased in supine position, fever and dyspnoea. A chest X-ray showed heart enlargement. Past medical history revealed that in the previous eight months, S. presented three similar episodes of chest pain, that were effectively home-treated with NSAIDS. Physical examination showed fair general condition, paleness and friction rubs at the cardiac auscultation. Lab tests revealed elevated CRP (270 mcg/ml) and ESR (79 mm/h). At trans-thoracic echocardiography revealed a diffuse pericardial effusion of 300 cc. Serologic studies didn't suggest a clue for the aetiology of episode. Treatment with naproxen (250 mg twice a day for 7 days) and prednisone (initial dosage 30 mg/die) lead to rapid control of symptoms, inflammatory markers and US findings within few days. From there on, any attempt to taper steroids, even of few mg, led to rapid relapse of symptoms, inflammatory markers, and pericardial effusion. For this reason colchicine was added to initial treatment (1,5mg once a day) with no improvement and, after 3 months from the onset, anakinra (at the dosage of 100 mg/die) was introduced, with prompt normalization of the clinical picture and US findings. Steroids were withdrawn and in the following nine years numerous attempt were made to taper Anakinra but, every time the interval between injection was extended to 4 days, SS experienced a relapse. Genetic tests for TRAPS and Familial Mediterranean Fever resulted negative. In June 2018, we tried to modify the therapy by substituting anakinra with canakinumab, in order to reduced the number of injections. Unfortunately, 48 hours after the administration of canakinumab 150 mg, the patient experienced a flare with thoracic pain and high inflammatory markers. The flare was managed by steroids (prednisone 40mg a day) and, after two weeks, a second dose of Canakinumab was administered. Even after this up-titration it was not possible to taper steroids. Therefore, after an adequate period of wash-out, Anakinra was reintroduced with rapid and stable disease control and steroid withdrawal. Conclusion: our case confirms that Anakinra may be a good option for recurrent pericarditis unresponsive to first line treatment, but drug withdrawal may be difficult. Although limited to this case, it seems that canakinumab is not a valid option. One may speculate that recurrent pericarditis (at least in some cases) is an IL-amediated disease Introduction: Adult-onset Still' s disease (AOSD) is a rare autoinflammatory condition characterized by fever, arthritis, skin rash, and multi-organ inflammation. The pathogenesis of AOSD is centrally mediated by the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2; anakinra, a recombinant inhibitor of the IL-1\u03b2 receptor, has thereby become the cornerstone of biologic therapy for AOSD. More recently, a new agent blocking IL-1\u03b2 has become available, that is, the monoclonal antibody canakinumab.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Objectives: So far, canakinumab has been used in the treatment of AOSD following failure of multiple lines of biologic therapy, including anakinra.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Here, we describe the use of canakinumab as first-line biologic agent in 4 patients with AOSD, and report the highly promising results of this treatment approach.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Methods: Four patients with severe, DMARD-refractory AOSD received canakinumab at the approved dose of 4 mg/kg once every 4 weeks following failure of conventional treatment with corticosteroids and methotrexate.

Fever and skin rash disappeared first and did not recur, followed by progressive and sustained improvement in arthritis. Inflammatory organ involvement also responded to treatment: for example, we observed resolution of pericardial inflammation in two patients, as revealed by cardiac ultrasound; another patient had hepatosplenomegaly, which also reverted to normal upon treatment. A striking reduction in serum pro-inflammatory markers C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and ferritin mirrored the efficacy on clinical manifestations. These effects amounted to a significant decrease in the modified Pouchot score for measuring disease severity (average score before canakinumab treatment: 6; after: 1.25; statistical significance of difference evaluated with Mann-Whitney: p=0.02), and allowed for tapering or discontinuation of concomitant therapy: specifically, corticosteroid treatment was completely discontinued in two patients and substantially reduced in two patients, whereas methotrexate was stopped in one patient. Conclusion: In this study, first-line biologic therapy of AOSD with canakinumab resulted in rapid and marked efficacy, ultimately leading to full clinical remissions in all patients, and allowing for robust steroid-sparing effects.

Introduction: Autoinflammatory diseases (AID) are characterized by a dysregulation of innate immunity leading to uncontrolled inflammation. The treatment in AID is critical to control the disease activity, to prevent complications, and to improve the health-related quality of life. Biologic drugs have revolutionized the treatment and outcomes in AID. Objectives:Herein we aim to present the clinical characteristics of children to whom biologic drug therapy was initiated for the management of AID. Methods: A web-based registry called the Helios Registry (Hacettepe univErsity eLectronIc research fOrmS) has been formed to evaluate the data of all children on biologic treatment. We have been enrolling patients since August 2018 retrospectively and prospectively. We have analyzed the data about the general characteristics of the patients, treatment, the biologic drug used, and adverse effects. Only the patients with the following diagnoses were included: systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), cryopyrin associated periodic syndrome (CAPS), and chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO). Results: Of 60 patients included, 19 had FMF (31.7%), 24 had sJIA (40%), 10 had CAPS,(16.7%), and 7 had CRMO (11.7%). Their median age was 10.7 (2-20) years old and disease duration was 2.8 (0-6) years, at the time of biologic drug initiation. 58.3% were currently on canakinmab, 20% anakinra, 10% tocilizumab, 10% etanercept, and 1.7% adalimumab. 63.3% of our patients had previously used at least one other biologic drug. The rate of glucocorticoid use before biologic treatment was 56.6%. The median duration of glucocorticoid treatment after initiating biologic drugs was 7.4 months.56 (93%) patients achieved remission on biologic therapy. There were 15 patients (25%) who received tuberculosis prophylaxis due to positive tuberculin skin test (diameter\u226510 mm) and there was no Quantiferon test positivity. Thirteen adverse events (AE) had been noted. 2 of them were serious events as anaphylaxis due to tocilizumab infusions.

Non-parenchymal form usually presents with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) and intracranial hypertension. Neurological symptoms in children and adolescents can be confused with many other disorders and may be the initial symptom of BD. Objectives: To report our experiences of the juvenile Beh\u00e7et's Disease patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) and to review previous studies reporting the clinical characteristics and outcomes of Juvenile Beh\u00e7et's Disease with CVS Methods: The patients who met Pediatric Beh\u00e7et's Disease (PEDBD) classification criteria for juvenile Beh\u00e7et's Disease from 3 referral centers in Turkey were reviewed retrospectively. Disease activity was assessed by BD current activity form (BDCAF). A systematic review of literature of all published data was conducted. Results: The study group consisted of 12 juvenile BD patients with CVST. At the time of CVST diagnosis, the most common symptom was headache (%100), followed by vomiting (25%), blurred vision (16.6-7%), and disturbances in eye movements (16.7%). Six (50 %) patients presented with sinus venous thrombosis as an initial symptom. Transverse sinus was the most frequently affected sinus (9/12, 75%) followed by superior sagittal sinus (8/12, 66.6%) and sigmoid sinus (1/12, 8.3%) . The median (minimum-maximum) BDCAF was 6 (5-8). Four children (33.3%) had another venous thrombosis apart from CVST. All patients received pulse methylprednisolone for three consecutive days continued with oral prednisolone. Steroid treatment was tapered and discontinued minimum in six months. Eleven patients received azathioprine concomitant to steroid treatment at the time of CVST. All the patients received anticoagulant therapy concomitantly. Only one patient had relapse. Median (min-max) followup period was 4 years (1-10).In the literature review, we identified nine articles, describing 35 pediatric CVST patients associated with BD. Thirty patients achieved remission, while five patients had residual neurologic deficit. Conclusion: Further multicenter studies with more patients and prospective follow-up may help us to understand the whole spectrum in these patients. Introduction: Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and cervical adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome is the most common autoinflammatory disorder in childhood, with multifactorial, polygenic causes postulated. Children usually present before the age of 5 years with periodic fevers and one or more associated symptoms of stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis, flares usually resolving in adolescence.

Methods: A retrospective observational chart review of all children with PFAPA, confirmed or likely, attending Autoinflammatory clinic at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin Dublin from January 2016. Data were collected on basic demographics, age at presentation, route of referral, symptoms and signs and inflammatory markers during disease episodes and non-episodes. Details of genetics analysis if performed, were included. Information was also gathered on any treatment methods used and their effect including oral corticosteroids, colchicine, biological agents and tonsillectomy. Results were analysed using Microsoft Excel. Results: 13 children were identified as having PFAPA, including 2 sets of siblings. The median age of disease onset was 16 months, ranging from 4 months to 4 years of age. The route to referral was through Immunology (4 patients), Rheumatology (6 patients) and Infectious disease (3 patients) clinics. All children presented with episodic, recurrent febrile episodes with a median duration of 3-4 days and a range of associated features. (See table 1) 3 children presented with the triad of stomatitis, adenitis and pharyngitis. Sixty nine percent of patients had documented raised inflammatory markers during a flare, with 84% having high serum amyloid A levels, the highest documented being 1220mg/l (normal <10). 69% of patients had normal inflammatory markers and 76% normal serum amyloid A documented during disease quiescence. Genetic testing in 6 children was negative for other causes of Hereditary Autoinflammatory disorders-TRAPS FMF. 2 sisters were found to have a benign variant NLRP mutation. Serum IgD levels normal in 9 and raised in 1 patient. 11 patients were initiated with treatment that included a stat of 3day trial of oral corticosteroids, all of whom reported some improvement in symptoms, but 2 reporting rebound flares. 11 were treated with Colchicine, 9 of whom reported some benefit. Tonsillectomy was performed in 5 patients, 3 who found benefit. Anakinra was used to treat 2 and 1 patient was commenced on Adalimumab. Conclusion: This study gives an over view of the burden of disease imposed by PFAPA on an Irish population. While all the children presented with fevers, not all had the classic triad of aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and cervical adenitis.Raised CRP ESR were seen in the majority of patients and 84% had raised amyloid levels during disease flare. The majority of patients had prompt relief of symptoms with an initiation trial of corticosteroid. Colchicine being frequently used with some success to prevent occurrence of flares. Tonsillectomy and biological agents were also used in some resistant/severe cases. Introduction: Autoimmune, autoinflammatory mechanism and drugs used in treatment increase the risk of liver disease in patients with chronic rheumatic diseases. Hepatitis A vaccine is a highly effective vaccine that prevents both the formation and spread of clinical hepatitis. In childhood chronic rheumatic diseases, vaccination is of great importance. The risk of various infections increases with the immunosuppressive effect of both the disease and the drugs.Therefore, vaccination of these diseases is of high importance for the prevention of infectious diseases. Systemic juvenile idiopathic (SJ\u0130A) arthritis is a juvenile idiopathic arthritis (J\u0130A) subtype with autoinflammatory pathogenesis. Steroid, methotrexate and anti-interleukin 1 and 6 are used for the SJ\u0130A treatment. Anti-interleukin 1 treatments are also used in the treatment of Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), which is also characterized with autoinflammatory pathogenesis.Studies on the efficacy and safety of vaccines in autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases are limited. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of hepatitis A vaccine in patients with autoinflammatory disease on anti-interleukin 1 and 6 treatment. Methods: This study was carried out in Pediatric Rheumatology outpatient clinic and Healthy Child clinic between June 2017 and November 2018. A total of 39 patients with autoinflammatory diseases on anti IL-1 and IL-6 therapy were initially evaluated but 25 of them were excluded due to anti-HAV IgG positivity. At the end, 24 patients withautoinflammatory diseases on anti IL-1, anti IL-6 therapyand 39 healthy participants who were seronegative for hepatitis A received two doses of the hepatitis A vaccine in a 0 and 6 month schedule. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) IgG antibodies were measured before vaccination and one month after last dose of the vaccine. Anti-HAV IgG titer as S/ CO;1.1, IU/ L was considered positive and protective. Results: Thirty-three patients, that fulfilled the 2016 classification criteria for MAS [1] at time of sampling, were excluded from the analysis. Therefore, we analysed laboratory parameters of 53 patients with sJIA, 33 of whom without history of MAS (group 1) and 20 who developed at least one episode of MAS during disease course (group 2). Levels of ferritin, AST, LDH, gGT and TGL, collected at T2, were statistically significant higher in patients with a history of MAS compared to those without a history of MAS. For each of these parameters an arbitrary cut-off was defined. In order to define the final score an arbitrary rate was attributed to each parameter. Sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated to define the best scoring system. The scoring system with the best sensitivity was chosen ( condition with high mortality rate. The rate of occurrence of the condition in AOSD patients is 5-10%.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 4950, "end": 4953, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Objectives: A 24-year-old female patient with fever, rash, joint pain having started 1.5 months ago was admitted to our hospital.

The corticosteroid sparing effect and the impact of disease duration and treatment delay on survival constituted ancillary aims. Methods: sJIA patientsdiagnosed according to the revised International League of Association for Rheumatology (ILAR) criteriatreated with anakinra (ANA) and canakinumab (CAN) were enrolled in 15 Italian tertiary referral centers.

Three months later she flared with intense pruritus, arthritis and quotidian fever and was changed to tocilizumab. Shortly after she precipitated with the picture of MAS and ferritin rise to 26,000 \u03bcg/L, elevated LDH, high triglyceride and low fibrinogen. Bone marrow was normal, spinal fluid showed mild pleocytosis, 36 leukocytes per \u03bcL. Etoposide and dexamethasone treatment were started according to the HLH-2004 protocol. Nevertheless, she developed another two episodes of MAS attacks with ferritin peaks >66,000 \u03bcg/L and two CNS attacks with generalized seizures (no cells in spinal fluid, but MRI with widespread bilateral cortical involvement). Despite treatment with canakinumab, dexamethasone, highdose anakinra (8 mg/kg/day), several 3-day pulses with 1 G i.v. methylprednisolone and IVIG the condition deteriorated with repeated hyperferritinemia, fever, and elevated acute phase reactants.

Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a CASP1 variant associated with sJIA and recurrent MAS. We suggest that the Arg161His contributes to the phenotype, since it is located in the catalytic domain of procaspase-1 and therefore might stabilize the ASC Pyroptosome.

Perineal ulcers is a rare presentation in the pediatric age group and being an isolated clinical presentation confirms that in pediatrics the number of symptoms may be too few to apply any classification of diagnosis to a single patient. The severity of the ulcers , the relapsing nature , failure of azathioprine as asteroid sparing therapy lead to applying TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors which proved a great efficacy to maintainremission. Introduction: Pyoderma gangrenousm (PG) is an idiopathic Ulcerative, non-infective chronic inflammatory skin disorder of unknown etiology.The most common reported underlying diseases in pediatrics are inflammatory bowel disease , followed by hematologic disorders, vasculitis, immune deficiencies and pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and acne (PAPA) syndrome. More than half of the cases occur with no underlying disease. The most frequently treatment should be tailored according to the underlying etiology. It includes systemic steroids, corticosteroid sparing agents such as dapsone, cyclosporine, azathioprine and currently TNF -alpha inhibitors such as etenrecpt, adalimumab and infliximab is a promising treatment of refractory PG. Response to treatment is high with cure rates reaching 90%. A high index suspicion and a through workup are mandatory in the management of pediatrics PG. Objectives: To describe the clinical presentation, laboratory testes and challenges with treatment trials in two pediatric cases. Methods: clinical information was gathered from the history, which was taken from their parents after an informed consent Results: for the first time we report two pediatric cases in Libya who diagnosed with refractory pyoderma gangrenousm with no associated systemic diseases except PAPA which can't be excluded since no genetic tests available in all public hospitals in Libya, we report PG in two Libyan children of 2 year-old and 5 year-old, they presented with skin lesions beginning as a small pustule that progressed to very painful large ulcer with irregular borders. There were healed ulcers with scaring present on chest, both upper and lower extremities and abdominal wall.Laboratory testes for both cases showed an increase in white blood cell counts mainly neutrophils, anemia, increased platelets count, elevated erythrosedmintation rate, and elevated C-reactive protein.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction: The differential diagnosis of fever of unknown origin (FUO) is a major challenge especially for differentiation of systemiconset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) and infectious diseases and can be supported by biomarker analysis."}, {"text": "No hematological abnormalities were seen in peripheral blood smears except neutrophilic response, the red cell indices were suggestive of iron deficiency anemia.Cultures for bacteria and fungi from skin lesions, and blood cultures were repeatedly negative. Immunoglobulin assay (IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE) was normal. The antinuclear antibody, cytoplasmic antibody, and antiphospholipid antibodies, tests for hepatitis B, C and HIV were all negative. They didn't have symptoms suggest ulcerative colitis, their colonoscopy was normal. Histopathology from their skin was consistent with pyoderma gangrenousm. Both cases were moderate response to high dose of oral prednisolone 2mg\\kg per day complicated, however by growth retardation and cushingnoid habitus and minimal response to corticosteroid sparing agent azathioprine. Anti TNF-alpha inhibitors etenrecpt, which has been available at hospital since March 2018, we used it in case 2 because he was inadequate response to azathioprine. Both cases showed briefly remitted on azathioprine with relapsed at least 2-3 episodes per year. The ulcer lesions healed with cribriform scaring within 6-8 weeks in each episode. Conclusion: Pyoderma gangrenousm has recently been included within the spectrum of auto-inflammatory diseases, which are characterized by recurrent episodes of sterile inflammation, without circulating autoantibodies and autoreactive, which can be diagnosed by genetic tests, which is unfortunately not available in public hospitals in Libya.We couldn't either be able to start other biological treatment because of the civil war crisis in Libya. Introduction: Monogenic autoinflammatory diseases (AID) with central nervous system (CNS) involvement are often difficult to diagnose and patients may be subjected to expensive and often invasive diagnostic patient pathways. Securing a molecular diagnosis is of major importance in these cases for treatment, prognosis, and genetic counselling.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "We describe a 7-year-old girl of non-consanguineous Swedish/Lebanese descent with severe developmental delay. Her psychomotor development was normal until 10 months of age. At the age of 10 months she presented with myoclonus and increased muscletone of both legs. She developed a progressive encephalopathy, behavioural change and sleep disturbance during the following months. Cerebral MRI showed white matter disease with high signal on T2 weighted imaging and atrophy. CSF showed normal proteins but minor lymphocytosis, and slight increase in neurological damage markers NFL and Tau (normal GFA-p). Extensive work-up did not reveal a clear diagnosis. Cerebral CT was not performed. At the age of 20 months a neuroblastoma was detected, leading to a diagnosis of atypical opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (OMS) despite the absence of opsoclonus, for which she was treated with cyclophosphamide, steroid pulses, IVIG and rituximab. By this time she demonstrated severe psychomotor delay with no speech and a dyskinetic syndrome. At the age of 6 years she developed skin rash and vasculitis-like lesions on her toes, which developed to also involved the face and upper limbs. Her ESR was increased (47 mm/h), but CRP was normal (<1 mg/L). Titres of several autoantibodies were raised (ANA, anti-dsDNA and anti-ribo-p). Lumbar puncture showed slightly increased lymphocytes (7, ref <4 x 10 6 /L), and slightly elevated levels of Tau protein (normal NFL and GFA-p), with no increase of protein and no oligoclonal bands in the face of slight increase of IgM-index.

IFN score is pending and we are planning to start JAK inhibition Conclusion: We present a child with severe developmental delay having both a classic neuroblastoma and AGS7. She presented with neurodevelopmental delay at the age of 10 months and was found to have a neuroblastoma at the age of 20 months. She was considered to have an atypical OMS even though she didn't demonstrate opsoclonus. Her developmental delay was more severe than usually seen in OMS. The findings of lupus-like features years later made us consider another cause for her neurological delay. The genetic finding of a pathogenic variant in IFIH1is fully compatible with a type I interferonopathy (AGS7). The fact that she also had a neuroblastoma may also have contributed to her neurological features, although this is not clear. To our knowledge, there is no connection between AGS and neuroblastoma described so far. Introduction: Phospholipase-Gamma-C2 (PLC\u01942) is a member of the phospholipase C family and plays a key role in the transmembranous signaling of B-lymphocytes, natural killer cells and mast cells.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Mutations in PLCG2 were associated with rare dominantly inherited diseases characterized by a variable clinical phenotype including cold urticaria, neutrophilic dermatitis, immunodeficiency and autoimmune features or autoinflammation (PLAID/APLAID). The known mutations comprise in frame loss mutations of exon 19 and exon 20-22 and a missense mutation (p.Ser707Tyr) within the PLCG2 gene. Methods: We studied four members of a three-generation family, three of whom were affected by cold-induced urticarial rash. Genetic analysis of the index patient comprised screening for autoinflammatory periodic fever syndrome genes by Sanger sequencing (NLRP3, NLRP12 and PLCG2) and was followed by segregation analysis of further family members. We assessed clinical history and laboratory results including routine laboratory markers, immune status, autoantibodies, immunoglobulins, inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, S100A8/9) and performed cold contact provocation testing. Results: All three affected family members presented with early onset cold-induced urticarial rash since birth associated with an autosomal-dominant inheritance. The patients reported occurrence of pruritic wheals to cold contact and cold evaporation as well as systemic reactions in response to extensive cold. Direct cold contact provocation testing was negative. Treatment with antihistamines could partially reduce the cold-associated skin-symptoms. Laboratory analysis revealed elevated serum S100A8/9 as well as elevated serum IgE levels and reduced IgM levels. Genetic analysis of the index patient showed a heterozygous variant c.2054+5G>T (located in the intronic splice region 18) in PLCG2 which was confirmed in the two other affected family members. Conclusion: We identified a novel mutation variant in PLCG2 associated with a phenotype of cold-induced urticarial rash and immune dysregulation. As the substitution is located in the intronic splice region 18, it may cause aberrant splicing and result in truncated mRNA or mRNA decay. Further studies including the identification of the amino acid sequence as well as functional analysis of the PLC\u01942 protein are necessary to clarify the impact of this novel variant. Introduction: Caffey disease is a rare condition of early infancy characterized by hyperostotic periostitis, acute inflammation and swelling of soft tissues. It is self-limiting and usually caused by the c.3040C>T p.Arg836Cys mutation in COL1A1. Besides Caffey disease, COL1A1 mutations are reported in Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI), with a wellknown pathogenic mechanism. On the contrary, a link between the molecular defects of Caffey disease and its inflammatory, self-limiting phenotype is not properly understood. Another gene associated with OI is SERPINF1, whereas no inflammatory phenotypes are described related to SERPINF1 mutations. Objectives: To describe a case with many common characteristics with Caffey disease, but with a more severe course, steroiddependency and no spontaneous regression. Methods: The proband is a previously healthy 11-month-old girl born from non-consanguineous parents in a community with high risk of endogamy. She presented with persistent fever, elevation of inflammatory markers along with severe pain, functional limitation and progressive swelling of all four limbs. X-ray and MRI documented an aggressive periostitis involving several long bones. Pain was not controlled despite combined antalgic therapies, requiring i.v. morphine administration. Bone biopsy revealed a neutrophilic inflammatory process consistent with acute suppurative osteomyelitis, although broad-spectrum antibiotics were ineffective and an infectious origin was excluded. 41 NGS panel and genetic analysis of COL1A1 excluded DIRA, MKD, Majeed and Caffey disease. With suspicion of a possible auto-inflammatory condition, Anakinra was started and allowed slight clinical improvement but elevation of acute phase reactants and bone swelling persisted. Results: Considering the ineffectiveness of different treatments, high dose steroid therapy was introduced with dramatic improvement, maintained even when oral prednisone was started with slow tapering. Anakinra was confirmed as a possible steroid-sparing agent. Serial X-ray displayed persistent improvement until the age of 2 years, when radiology assessment revealed a subclinical disease progression and recurrence of swelling of the left wrist occurred when steroid discontinuation was tried. In the attempt to stop the subclinical disease progression, steroid therapy was maintained to the minimal effective dose. Anakinra treatment was tapered and finally discontinued without any flare. WES revealed compound heterozygosity for 2 missense variants in SERPINF1 (A131D and P132R), inherited from parents. Immunofluorescence analyses of patient's dermal fibroblasts revealed disorganized collagen type I, III and V in the extracellular matrix, endorsing a possible pathogenic role of both SERPINF1 variants. Biphosphonate treatment was considered because of osteopenic risk due to prolonged steroid treatment and its potential use in OI. 4 doses of neridronate were administered within 9 months and subsequent X-rays displayed improvement of osteopenia and stability of the dysmorphic feature of left wrist. Conclusion: We describe a patient with a clinical picture characterized by fever and multifocal neutrophilic hyperostosis without spontaneous regression, presenting dramatic response to high dose corticosteroid and subsequently to bisphosphonate. We suggest that this is a new variant of Caffey disease caused by SERPINF1 missense variants. Introduction: Chronic multifocal osteitis (CMO) and its adult variant, SAPHO syndrome (an acronym of synovitis, acne, hyperostosis, pustulosis, osteitis) are rare polygenic bone autoinflammatory disorders. However, their radiological features are not pathognomonic, as periostitis, bone sclerosis and cysts may be found in other systemic bone diseases, including myeloid neoplasia. Acquired gain-of-function JAK2 (617F) mutations, frequently found in myeloproliferative neoplasms, are sometimes associated to bone marrow fibrosis. JAK2 inhibitors may improve marrow fibrosis in myelofibrosis. JAK inhibition was also successfully employed in a case of refractory SAPHO syndrome.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Objectives: To present the difficult case of a patient with the clinical picture of a late-onset, incomplete SAPHO syndrome in whom aJAK2-positive myeloproliferative syndrome was found. Methods: A 57-year male patient, with no personal or familial history of acne, psoriasis or spondylarthritis, presented with cervical and anterior chest wall intense bone pain, tibio-tarsal arthritis and left plantar fasciitis. Results: The laboratory revealed inflammation (ESR 88 mm/h, CRP 18 mg/dl, leukocytosis -WBC 10500 with 70% polymorphonuclear neutrophilsand 11% monocytes), with normal alkaline phosphatase, plasma protein electrophoresis,PSA, CA 19-9 and CEA neoplastic markers.HLA-B27 was negative, as well as the tests for Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, Borrelia and hepatitis B, C and HIV serology. Ferritin was 501 ug/l. The radiographs showed left tibial periostitis, asymmetric periarticular bone demineralization, bone cysts, asymmetric sacroiliitis and a dorsal crush fracture. Bone scintigraphy revealed cervical, dorsal sternoclavicular and tibio-tarsal enhancement, with a\" bullhead\" appearance considered pathognomonic for SAPHO syndrome. Abdominal ultrasound, chest radiograph and CT were unremarkable. He received NSAIDs, sulfasalazine and methotrexate, supplemented afterwards with corticosteroids, cyclosporine and alendronate, with clinical improvement, but persistence of ESR elevation and monocytosis (up to 26%). The bone marrow biopsy showed all series, hypolobulated megakaryocytes and areas of myelofibrosis. The JAK2 (V617F) mutation was positive (allele burden 1%).BCR-ABL was negative. Cytogenetic analysis of the bone marrow revealed a normal karyotype. No free immunoglobulin chains were found. The final diagnosis was chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Conclusion: A late-onset and incomplete SAPHO clinical picture, in the presence of persistently abnormal blood counts, may prompt a search for hematologic malignancies. Common putative mechanisms of osteitis and bone fibrosis may be involved, making plausible a role of JAK inhibition for osteitis therapy. Introduction: NLRP3 plays a role in intestinal homeostasis and has been implicated in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Mutations in NLRP3 also cause the autoinflammatory disease cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS). Despite the involvement of NLRP3 in both IBD and CAPS, there are no reports of patients with CAPS who develop colitis and other manifestations of IBD. Objectives: We report on 3 patients who initially presented with bloody stools and were later diagnosed with CAPS. Results: Patient 1 had a history of recurrent painful hives since she was young, triggered by weather changes, stress, illness, or sun, but not cold. At 10 years of age, she developed recurrent uveitis, which was treated with topical steroids. She also had recurrent arthralgias. In her early 20's she was diagnosed with Crohn's disease when she developed abdominal pain and ileitis confirmed by colonoscopy. She was treated with mesalamine as needed during ileitis flares. At around the same time, she developed episodes of painful swelling of hands and feet, in addition to daily episodes of fever, fatigue, hives, nausea, and chills, lasting several hours. She had elevated inflammatory markers. She took hydroxychloroquine with no effect. In her 30's she was diagnosed with CAPS with mutation A441V on the NLRP3 gene. She was started on canakinumab with resolution of most of her symptoms except for her arthritis and conjunctivitis, for which she remained on methotrexate. Patient 2 is the son of patient 1. He had occasional fevers before 1 year of age, but at 1 year of age, he started having episodic hives and fevers, often triggered by weather changes but not cold. He had recurrent episodes of bloody stools and diarrhea, which did not improve after dietary restrictions. At around age 2, he started having episodes of ankle arthritis in addition to conjunctivitis without other signs of ocular inflammation.He had normal growth and development. He did not have a colonoscopy. After his mother was diagnosed with CAPS, he was tested and found to be positive for the same NLRP3 mutation. Anakinra was started on an as-needed basis to be used during episodes with good response. Patient 3 developed feeding intolerance at around 6 months of age, which improved during his toddler years but recurred at 4 years of age, with the development of diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, bloody stools, elevated inflammatory markers, and weight loss requiring NG tube feeding. He was seen by gastroenterology, and his Prometheus IBD panel was consistent with Crohn's disease. He was empirically treated with steroids and sulfasalazine. A colonoscopy performed post-treatment did not confirm a pathologic diagnosis. He then developed recurrent episodes of fever and arthralgias lasting 1-2 days before self-resolving. He also suffered from recurrent headaches and there was a question of developmental delays and/or ADHD. At 9 years of age, whole exome sequencing showed the lowpenetrance mutation R490K on the NLRP3 gene. His asymptomatic father was also found to be positive for the same mutation. Patient 3 was then referred to rheumatology. Further history revealed he had had urticarial rashes induced by heat and cold about twice per year. His hearing testing was normal. He was treated with anakinra, followed by canakinumab, with a good response except for rare breakthrough fevers, and for persistence of the gastrointestinal symptoms, including occasional bloody stools. Conclusion: Patients with CAPS may present with overlapping IBD symptoms such as bloody stools, and failure to thrive that may mask the usual CAPS features, causing delays in diagnosis. Introduction: Beh\u00e7et's Disease (BD) is a multisystemic autoinflammatory disease and the most severe complication of BD is pulmonary artery involvement (PAI). Data regarding treatment and outcomes of pediatric patients with PAI is very limited. Objectives: Herein, we report two pediatric patients with BD presenting with PAI and treated successfully with aggressive immunosuppressive treatment. Results: Case 1 A 15-year-old boy was admitted to a hospital with abdominal pain and feverAn abdominal Doppler ultrasonography (USG) showed stenosis of vena cava inferior (VCI) with a thrombus. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) detected that the thrombus extended from VCI to the right atrium. When he started to have hemoptysis, he was referred to our hospital. TTE showed a mass in RV. The computed chest and abdominal tomography angiography (CTA) showed bilateral aneurysmatic dilatation with thrombi in the pulmonary arteries and thrombosis in vena hepatica. The pathergy test was negative and the HLA B5 was negative. According to the ICBD, the patient had been diagnosed as BD due to genital ulcers and vascular involvement. He was given pulse methylprednisolone 500 mg 3 days along and followed by oral prednisolone 1 mg/ kg/day, intravenous cyclophosphamide at a dose of 500 mg (15 mg/kg) every 3 weeks for a total of 6 cycles, and Interferon-\u03b12a (IFN-\u03b12a) 3 times a week. Within one month, hemoptysis and fever disappeared, and CRP and ESR values normalized.After a three-month treatment, TTE and CTA revealed that thrombi shrank significantly. The dosage of prednisolone was tapered gradually and stopped 2 years later. Immunosuppressive treatment was continued with adalimumab. The patient has been followed in remission for nearly 6 years. Case 2 A fifteen-year-old boy was referred to our hospital for the evaluation of fever for over 4 months and a thrombus in his right ventricle. He had a medical history with cough, fever, intermittent hemoptysis and weight loss (14 kg) for the past 3 months. Physical examination revealed acne-like rashes over face and back, ulcers on the buccal mucosa, a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left upper parasternal area.A CTA confirmed the thrombus in RV and showed bilateral multiple aneurysms along the pulmonary artery and its branches. According to ICBD, the patient was diagnosed with BD due to having aphthous ulcers, pseudofolliculitis, and vascular involvement. Iv methylprednisolone (500 mg/day) for 3 days was followed by oral prednisolone 1 mg/ kg/day, which was subsequently tapered. Iv cyclophosphamide at a dose of 500 mg was also given every 3 weeks for a total of 6 cycles, followed by oral azathioprine (AZA). Concomitant subcutaneous IFN-\u03b12a was given two times per week for 6 months. Within two weeks, cough and fever disappeared, CRP and ESR values normalized. After 1 year the pulmonary artery aneurysm disappeared and cardiac thrombosis resolved and returned nearly normal. We have been following the patient with AZA for four years without recurrence. Conclusion: We present two pediatric patients with pulmonary involvement of BD. PAI is a life-threatening condition and should be managed with more aggressive medical therapy.Early diagnosis and aggressive immunosuppressive treatment are very important in PAI. We strengthened our treatment with IFN-\u03b12a. There is no data in the literature regarding the use of IFN-\u03b1-2a in PAI treatment along with low dose cyclophosphamide. There were no mortality or recurrences within the 6 and 4 years follow up period. An aggressive immunosuppressive therapy leads to better prognosis in this most dreadful complication of BD. Introduction: Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) is a rare and heterogenous inherited autoinflammatory disease entity: a spectrum of clinical phenotypes associated with NLRP3 mutations. It is characterized by the presence of raised inflammatory markers and typical manifestations: urticaria-like rash, cold-triggered episodes, sensorineural hearing loss, arthralgia/myalgia, chronic aseptic meningitis and skeletal abnormalities.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Results: A 64-year-old woman presented psychomotor agitation and a recent diagnosis of left subclavian artery thrombosis with digital ischemia. She had a long history (since adolescence) of acute severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome, early-onset sensorineural hearing loss, seronegative arthritis refractory to NSAIDs, steroids, azathioprine and leflunomide, articular deformities of the wrists, knees and feet, bilateral tibial enchondromas and frontal bossing; recurrent episodes of uveitis (anterior and posterior), resulting in blindness; recurrent headaches associated with aseptic meningitis and negative temporal artery biopsy; and chronic kidney disease, category G4/A3 (KDIGO). There was no history of recurrent fever, cold-triggered episodes or rash and no family history of autoimmune or autoinflammatory disease. Markedly elevated serum amyloid A, ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (C-reactive protein). Negative autoimmune panel. Non-nephrotic proteinuria and small kidneys on ultrasound. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed elevated protein and glucose levels, without associated pleocytosis. Imaging, micro and mycobacteriologic studies were negative for infectious foci. Premortem genetic analysis results were only available post-mortem, with negative NLRP3 mutation findings by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Conclusion: This case report highlights the challenging diagnosis of an adult patient with severe manifestations and organ failure, that fulfils the clinical picture of an autoinflammatory disease, with longstanding uncontrolled inflammation resulting in irreversible organ damage (neurological, osteoarticular, ocular, among others) and complications (prothrombotic state, e.g.). Despite negative NLRP3 mutations, alternative inflammasome mutations (e.g. NLRP12) or mosaicism (not evaluated in the analysis) could explain it. The pattern of manifestations is highly suggestive of CAPS, fulfilling the diagnosis criteria proposed by Kuemmerle-Deschner et al. (2016) , and represents a phenotype of increased severity in the CAPS spectrum in an adult patient. Given the patient's age and clinical course, one may hypothesize an \"attenuated\" phenotype, possibly associated with genetic mosaicism. The diagnostic challenge of autoinflammatory diseases complicates early diagnosis and control of inflammation, which are critical to prevent irreversible organ damage, thus becoming of vital importance the recognition of autoimmune disease patterns and phenotypes. Introduction: Somatic mosaicism has been described as one of the major mechanism for autoinflammatory syndromes with late onset in adults. Results: Case description: We describe a 57 yo previously healthy woman, that after menopause (previous 9 years) developed recurrent 5-10 days episodes of high fever (39\u00baC), flutuant periorbital edema, abdominal urticarial rash, arthralgia/ arthritis, myalgia, abdominal pain (no vomiting, rarely diarrhea), gengival pain, occasional cervical pain and \"feeling flu-ish\". The episodes became more severe and frequent, the flu-like symptoms persisted every day. Fever responded to NSAIDs, not the rest, arthritic flares appear twice a month and she was not compliant to steroids. Blood analysis documented ESR >80mm/1st hour on attacks and 50mm/1st hour between attacks, C reactive protein 170mg/dL on attacks and 70mg/dL between attacks; and serum amyloid A~90mg/dL between flares. Extensive infectious and autoimmune work lab panel was negative. The Eurofever Classification Criteria scored 74 points to CAPS (cryopirinopathies) and 88 points for TRAPS (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Associated Periodic Syndrome). A PCR and Sanger sequencing detected c.176G>A (p.Cys59Tyr) in TNFRSF1A, in 20% of the whole blood sample in EDTA (compatible with somatic mosaicism)validated pathogenic mutation. Colchicine 1mg/day had no effect on clinical symptoms or inflammatory markers. All her symptoms remitted and C reactive protein and serum amyloid A normalized wtih anakinra 100mg/day subcutaneous. No other family member (living parents or sibling) had ever had any fever or inflammatory symptoms. Conclusion: The suspicion level for monogenic autoinflammatory diseases in adults should be high as the clinical picture might be atypical and of slower progression. Genetic testing should include mosaicism screening mainly in adults and a close collaboration with attending clinical physicians is crucial for the final diagnosis. Introduction: Hyperzincaemia and hypercalprotectinemia (HandH) syndrome has been described as a new rare entity characterized by recurrent infections, dermatological involvement, increased inflammatory markers, hepatosplenomegaly and anemia. Little is known about its heterogeneous presentation, pathophysiology and treatment. Objectives: To describe three cases with HandH syndrome Methods: Serum calprotectin (MRP8/14) was measured according to Buehlmann assay (ELISA) and plasmatic zinc by atomic absorption spectrometry Results: Three patients were referred to our centre because an history characterized by recurrent episodes of skin rash, severe oral aphtosis and increased level of serum amyloid A (SAA). Patient 1 presented, since the age of ten years, with recurrent episodes of fever and rash; skin biopsy showed a picture consistent with a lymphocytic lichenoid vasculitis resembling erythema multiforme. Patient 2 presented at birth, with hemolitic anemia and thrombocytopenia. At the age of 5 she was admitted to another hospital due to EBV related hemophagocytic limphohystiocytosis (HLH). At the age of 8, she was first seen at our center because of a persistent desquamant erythematous rash with recurrent abdominal pain and recurrent arthritis. Intestinal biopsy showed small intestine inflammation (erosions in the digiunum). Patient 3 presented with recurrent episodes of fever, rash, two episodes of transient hip synovitis and muscoloskeletal pain. A bone scintigraphy was performed resulting normal. Patients 1 and 2 suffered from recurrent infections (pneumonia, otitis, skin abscesses). Immunological studies revealed in patient 2 a reduction of memory B cells and a reduced response to Toll like receptor 9 agonist. Of note, all the patients presented in their medical history at least one episode of vasculitis: patients 1 and 3 suffered from Schonlein-Henoch purpura at the age of 11 and 3 respectivelyand patient 2 had at the age of 2 years an undefined vasculitis (evaluated elsewhere). Laboratory tests showed in all patients elevated inflammatory markers, zinchemia and serum calprotectin (table) Conclusion: We report three patients with high serum levels of calprotectinemia and zinch presenting with a clinical phenotype consistent with previously reported cases. The presence of vasculitis in all of the patients suggests that it may represent the first symptom of this condition. Vasculitis could lead to an increase of serum calprotectin already proposed as a marker of vascular impairment. Moreover, considering the immunological defect detected in one of our patient, we speculate that recurrent infections described in this syndrome may underline an immune-dysregulation process in which the role of zinc metabolism needs to be assessed Introduction: Aggrecanopathies are a heterogeneous group of skeletal disorders caused by ACAN gene mutations leading to aggrecan dysfunction: this latter is a proteoglycan with a pivotal role in extracellular matrix of the growth-plate cartilage organization. Clinically, aggrecanopathies displayed bone dysplasias, idiopathic short stature and facial dysmorphisms. Herein we report a patient with a prevalent inflammatory articular involvement, e.g. osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) mimicking a septic arthritis. Methods: A 14-year-old boy displayed pain and swelling at the right elbow. Echo-scan revealed an effusion in both coronoid and olecranon recess. Acute phase reactants were negative. Since non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs were ineffective, the patient was admitted in our Institute, a month later clinical onset.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1979, "end": 2011, "text": "Kuemmerle-Deschner et al. (2016)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 6588, "end": 6595, "text": "(table)", "ref_id": "TABREF96"}], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "On physical examination, acute arthritis at right elbow was present, which appeared painful, warm, not erythematous. Laboratory test showed slight elevated inflammatory markers (C reactive protein 1.7 mg/dl, normal value <0.5). Arthrocentesis of the right elbow was performed: sterile synovial fluid was found. Magnetic resonance images of the right elbow displayed bone fragment detachment from humeral condyle with thickening of the synovium and persistent local effusion: the diagnosis of OCD was pointed out. It is worth nothing that patient showed minor dysmorphisms (i.e. dolicocephaly, hypotelorism, arched palate and brachydactyly of the IV finger of both hands). Furthermore parents referred that the child presented a previous episode of OCD when he was 12: the symptoms resolved with non-bearwighting and non-steroidal antiinflammatory therapy. The patient went under regular endocrinologist follow-up for short stature since he was 8. At the age of 10 (height cm 123 -SDS 2.4) Growth Hormone (GH) stimulation tests were performed showing only partial response to insulin tolerance test (GH peak 6.27 ng/mL). Bone age was delayed of 12 months. Human recombinant GH replacement therapy was started without a significant growth-velocity improvement. Results: Although our patient came to observation because of suspected elbow septic arthritis, we re-considered the diagnosis: namely, i. recurrent episodes of osteochondritis dissecans; ii.short stature poorly responsive to human recombinant GH treatment, iii. Mild facial, skeletal dysmorphisms led us to hypothesize a form of aggrecanopathy. Molecular analysis of the ACAN gene was performed revealing a novel missense variant c.6970T>C, p.Trp2324Arg. A similar mutation in the G3 domain (c.7249G>A) has been previously described and has been connected to aggrecanopathy. Conclusion: Aggrecan, an important sub-unit of proteoglycan in cartilage, is synthetized by ACAN gene. Aggrecan-related bone diseases range from severe spondylo-epi-metaphyseal dysplasia to familial osteochondritis dissecans usually associated with short stature. In our experience, a patient with a novel mutation of ACAN gene seems to cause an atypical form of aggrecanopathy mimicking inflammatory and/or septic arthritis associated with slight short stature and bone dysmorphisms. Intra-familial molecular analysis allowed us to recognize other three subjects (mother and 2 siblings) affected only by brachydactily. Further studies need to confirm the role of this variant of ACAN gene as cause of inflammatory arthropathy. Introduction: Lipopolysaccharide-responsive, beige-like anchor protein (LRBA) deficiency causes common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) disorders and autoimmunity. Patients with LRBA deficiency may present with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Herein, we report a patient with LRBA deficiency associated chronic arthritis Results: A 20-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital with swelling in knees and ankles for two months. He was initially diagnosed with Evans syndrome when he was four years old. Subsequently, he was diagnosed with Crohn's disease due to chronic diarrhea at 18-years old. He also suffered from recurrent infections since infancy. He also was followed by endocrinology department due to hypothyroidism. When he was 20-years old, he was referred to our outpatient clinic due to chronic arthritis. In laboratory work- up, he had elevated acute phase reactants and direct coombs positivity. Romatoid factor, anti-nuclear antibody and HLA-B27 were negative. Initially, he was considered to have chronic arthritis due to Crohn's disease and sulfasalazine was started. In third months, adalimumab was administered due to the inadequate response. Immunodeficiency due to coexistence of endocrinopathy, autoimmune cytopenia and recurrent infections was suspected. Therefore, expression of LRBA protein was found to be low. Mutation in LRBA gene was evaluated with Sanger sequence. A homozygous mutation in LRBA gene was detected (c.2818dupC;p.Gln940Profs*5).Abatacept (CTLA4 fusion protein) and intravenous immunoglobulin was started.

Objectives: To look for evidence of prior exposure to c-hGH in patients with AA amyloidosis. Methods: We searched our database of 625 patients with AA amyloidosis seen between 1990 and 2017 using the key words pituitary, craniopharyngioma and growth hormone. Only patients whose records suggested exposure to GH prior to 1985 were included. Results: 10 cases were identified; accounting for 1.6% of all AA amyloidosis and 8.4% of cases of AA of unknown aetiology. 8 were female, 8 were north European ethnicity and the median age at histological diagnosis of AA amyloidosis was 47.9 yrs with a median time since commencing c-hGH of 35 yrs. c-hGH was started in the 1960's in 4 cases, the 1970's in 4 cases and the 1980's in 2 cases. The indications for GH were: craniopharyngioma in 4, one case each of resection of ependymona, nasal pharyngeal tumour and encephalocoele, 3 cases of unexplained hypopituatism. Chronic inflammation was assessed by serial blood tests after the diagnosis of AA amyloid; only 1 case had severe sustained inflammation with a median SAA 131 mg/L; 4 had medians SAAs of between 20 and 54 mg/L and the others had only low level inflammation with median SAA below 20mg/L. No clear cause of inflammation was identified in the cohort although 50% were obese and 3 had body mass index above 45 kg/ m 2 . Genetic testing was performed in allin no cases did this result in a diagnosis of a systemic autoinflammatory disorder. Six European patients were homozygous for SAA1.1 (66.7% compared to a reported frequency of 42.7 -57.9%in European controls), a known predisposing factor for AA amyloidosis. One patient had a fall in SAA after bariatric surgery and one responded completely to anakinra. The other patients had no specific treatment aimed at supressing their SAA production. Five patients eventually required dialysis -2 of them had subsequent renal transplants; median survival from diagnosis with amyloid is 132 months and 3 patients have died. Conclusion: We report 10 patients with AA amyloidosis of unknown aetiology, who were exposed to c-hGH in childhood. We hypothesise that the c-hGH may have contained material that seeded conversion of healthy low concentrations of SAA into AA amyloid fibrils. It is of interest that 6 of this cohort had an additional risk factor in the form of SAA1.1 homozygosity suggesting that a combination of factors may contribute to amyloid formation in individuals who have low levels of circulating potentially amyloidogenic protein. We describe a case of progressive necrotic ulcerative lesions in a 7-month caucasian boy Methods: A 7-month-old Caucasian boy was admitted to our Department with purpuric and telangiectatic lesions on his right hand and left wrist without fever. After one month these lesions evolved in necrotic ulceration of the skin .He was born at term to unrelated parents after a pregnancy complicated by premature contractions.At the age of 9 months he developed a large necrotic lesion (4x4 cm) on the right foot and other similar smaller lesions on the knees. He had purpuric and telangiectatic lesions on the left foot and the medial face of the left leg. Laboratory assessments were performed to exclude infectious diseases (Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, HBV, HCV, HAV, Treponema Pallidum, Rickettisa conorii, Widal-Wright, BorrelliaBurgdoferi, TORCH, EBV) The inflammatory markers (ERS, SAA, CRP), prothrombotic risk factors (PT, APTT, fibrinogen, protein S, protein C), C3, C4, immunoglobulins, antiphospholipid antibodies, ANA, ANCA, ASCA, anti-Dna, celiac disease antibodies, Quantiferon, hemoglobin electrophoresis, blood culturesand urine analysis were negative or in the normal range.The analysis of CERC1 gene was negative for the main mutaions.It was also tested CD18, blood T-lymphocyte subpopulations. cryoglobulins, interferon signature (negative) and CGH ARRAY, karyotype, and for zinc deficiency (ongoing Results: The patient (male, age 30 months) referred to our Unit at the age of 3 months. At 1 month, he underwent a surgical repair of ventricular septal defect. At 3 months, he was admitted to a hospital for fever and maculopapular rash, with marked elevation of acute phase reactants (Protein C-reactive, PCR, 108 mg/L). Empiric antibiotic therapy was started, but no evidence of infectious diseases was disclosed.At the tenth day of fever, laboratory examinations found thrombocytosis and increase of ferritin (5034 ng/ml), lactate dehydrogenase (1059 U/l), aspartate and alanine aminotransferase (254 and 124 U/l) and triglycerides (266 mg/dl). In the suspicion of atypical Kawasaki disease, even if no coronary artery aneurysm was detected, treatment with intravenous Immunoglobulin and aspirin was started with disappearance of fever; because of persistent cutaneous rash and ferritin, triglycerides, platelets and PCR high levels, he was transferred to our Unit. On admission, physical examination revealed neck and inguinal enlarged lymph nodes. No organomegaly was detected. Laboratory investigations also revealed increased neutrophils (17830/ mm 3 ), normocytic anemia (hemoglobin 7,5 g/dl), hypoalbuminemia and hyponatremia. Fibrinogen levels were normal. Bone marrow aspiration revealed no signs of hemophagocytosis or cellular atypia. Intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy (30 mg/kg for three days) was started followed by daily oral prednisone (2 mg/kg/day), with clinical resolution and laboratory improvement. After six-months tapering, steroid therapy was withdrawn. Two months later, the patient newly present fever, rash and increase of PCR and ferritin. Anakinra (2 mg/kg/day) was started with improvement of clinical condition. Nevertheless, because of the persistent elevation of inflammatory markers, anakinra dosage was increased up to 4 mg/kg/ day during the follow-up. Besides, the mother of child revealed difficulty to adhere daily subcutaneous therapy. At the age of 2 years, he presented a new episode of fever and rash with high ferritin level (2364 ng/ml); anakinra was stopped and canakinumab (4 mg/kg/4 weeks) was started with initial dramatic clinical and laboratory improvement. Fifteen days after the first injection of canakinumab, the patient newly presented fever, without rash. IL18 was raised (184000 pg/ml). Therapy with prednisone (2 mg/kg/die) was added with fever disappearance. During the follow-up, in therapy with canakinumab and prednisone, the patient never obtained normalization of inflammatory markers and fever presented two or three weeks after canakinumab injection. So, during the last episode of fever, canakinumab was stopped and cyclosporine was added to steroid therapy. Since the introduction of cyclosporine, the patient has not presented fever and inflammatory markers have normalized.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "During the follow-up, the patient underwent Next Generation Sequencing for HLH and SAID; no mutation was identified, except for a heterozygous CECR1 variant. The average age at first symptoms was 11.5 years for UCD and 8.3 years for MCD. The mean diagnosis delay was 8.2 months for UCD and 5.2 years for MCD. In UCD, the initial symptoms were: isolated lymph nodes (n = 10) or lymph node associated with other symptoms (n = 7), fever was present in 3 patients. Patients with MCD presented with fever (n=5), abdominal lymph nodes (n=5), failure to thrive (n=3), hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly (n=3), arthralgia (n=2), abdominal pain (n=2), fatigue (n=2), facial oedema (n=1), isolated lymphadenopathy (n=1), trunk rash (n=1), vascular hepatopathy with oesophageal varicose veins (n=1), diarrhoea (n=1) or cholestasis (n=1). One patient had a Duchenne muscular dystrophy. No patients had HIV or HHV8 infection. The 6 patients met all the diagnosis criteria proposed by Fajgenbaum et al in 2017 for idiopathic MCD. One MCD patient with recurrent fevers, had a heterozygous mutation in MEFV gene. Another UCD patient experienced fever episodes and pericarditis two years after surgery. Genetic tests revealed one heterozygous mutation in IL10RA gene (V406L) and one in IL36RN gene (S113L). Nevertheless, our patient did not have any psoriasis or inflammatory bowel disease. Treatment of UCD was mainly surgical resection, steroids, and radiotherapy. Treatments of MCD were tocilizumab, rituximab, anakinra, steroids, chemotherapy and splenectomy. Overall survival after an average of 6 years of follow-up, was 100 % for both unicentric and multicentric forms. Conclusion: Paediatric CD seems still underdiagnosed with a significant diagnosis delay specially for the MCD but new international criteria will help in future. In UCD, surgery is the main treatment. New drugs are used specially for the MCD, but more studies need to be conduct in children.

Possible emerging applications for this technique include rheumatologic field and evaluation of fever of unknown origin (FUO). Objectives: To evaluate the ability of WBMRI to identify significant potential diagnostic clue (PDC) in patients presenting a non specific inflammatory clinical picture. Methods: We retrospectively collected cases of pediatric patients followed in a single pediatric rheumatology center who underwent WBMRI between January 2010 and December 2015 for the following indications: i) FUO (temperature greater than 38.3\u00b0C for more than three weeks or failure to reach diagnosis after one week of investigations), iii) recurrent fever (febrile episodesseparated by periods of normal temperature), iii) Inflammation of unknown origin, IUO (an illness of at least 3 weeks' duration, with raised inflammatory markers and fever below 38.3\u00b0C).WBMRI studies were acquired with coronal and sagittal planes (slice thickness 5mm) with acquisition of several image sets with automatic direct image realignment after acquisition creating a wholebody scan.Sequences include short \u03c4 inversion recovery (STIR) and T1weighted. All studies have been evaluated twice, the second time according to a predefined checklist, defined by an experienced radiologist, considering systematically single /multifocal bone lesion, bone marrow, joint effusion, soft tissues, adenopathies, parenchymal and vessels looking for PDC. We considered as a Potential Diagnostic Clue each alteration of the examined district that can potentially guide the diagnosis. Each alteration found is a PDC. We retrospectively evaluated patients' clinical history and final diagnosis and we classified the PDCs identified during both first evaluation and re-evaluation as: Not useful (the identified PDC did not guide the diagnosis and is not coherent with the final diagnosis), consistent (the identified PDC is congruent with the patient's final diagnosis) or diagnostic (the identification of the considered PDC strongly orient the final diagnosis). Results: We collected 102 patients who underwent WBMRI; 24 (23%) of them presenting FUO, 27 (26%) presenting recurrent fever and 51 (51%) presenting persistent low grade fever . The mean age of onset symptoms was 7 years and seven months (range: 2 weeks old-17 years and 6 months). The mean age of execution of WBMRI was 9 years (range: 5 months old-19 years and one month). After the whole diagnostic work-out a final diagnosis was achieved in 42 patients (41%).PDCs were identified at the first evaluation in 76/102 cases (74.5%).In 22 cases (21.5%) the identified PDCs were consistent with the diagnosis, whereas in 7 cases (7%) the identified PDCs were considered diagnostic. Globally we can consider that at first evaluation PDCs were somehow contributory to the diagnosis in 29 cases (28.5%; 6 JIA, 7 systemic infections, 5 monogenic inflammatory diseases, 4 ALPS, 2 Goldbloom's Syndrome,2 Vasculitis,1 eosinophilic fasciitis, 1 hystiocytosis, 1 neuroblastoma). Blind re-evaluation of WBMRI allowed the identification of additional PDCs in 52 patients (12 of them previously negative) . In 10 cases the PDC found after reevaluation were consistent with the final diagnosis (2 JIA, one infectious disease, one neuroblastoma, 3 ALPS, 1 monogenic inflammatory disease, 1Takayasu arteritis, 1 Goldbloom's syndrome).

Objectives: While the granulocytic protein S100A12 is highly overexpressed in sJIA, and the assessment of S100A12 serum levels helps to distinguish sJIA from other febrile illnesses, the presence of elevated levels of IFN\u03b3, IFN\u03b3-induced chemokines and IL-18 have recently been suggested to play a pivotal role during particularly MAS episodes. Clinically, however, MAS is strikingly similar to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and the initial differentiation between sJIA-associated MAS and primary or secondary HLH can be challenging. In this study we set out to define a serum marker profile to support the initial diagnosis of sJIA-MAS and differentiate this from primary or secondary HLH. Methods: A multiplexed bead array panel for simultaneous detection of 53 cytokines and chemokines was built based upon their suggested relevance in MAS or HLH according to respective literature. Serum samples from patients with active primary HLH (pHLH) (n=10), secondary HLH (sHLH) (n=12), clinically active or inactive sJIA-MAS (both n=11) as well as healthy controls (n=10) were subjected to this bead array assay as well as quantification of S100A12 levels by ELISA. Based on the data obtained from this discovery cohort we extracted a subset of analytes, which was validated using commercially available bead array reagents in an independent cohort. Results: Following analysis of the discovery cohort, out of 54 serum analytes 14 markers were identified that significantly distinguished sJIA-MAS from HLH. These mostly distinguished between pHLH and MAS, while S100A12, IL-18 as well as the MIG/IL-18-ratio also separated between MAS and sHLH. In ROC-analyses six out of these 14 analytes separated MAS from HLH with AUC > 0.9. S100A12 (AUC=0.99), sFASL (0.98) and IL-18 (0.97) were the top-three performing markers in these analyses. The 14plex panel including S100A12 was validated in an independent cohort resulting in IL-18 (AUC=0.83), S100A12 (0.75) and sFASL (0.7) as the top-three performing markers in separating sJIA-MAS from HLH. Conclusion: IL-18, S100A12 and sFASL serum levels are useful to differentiate between sJIA-associated MAS and HLH. This can be a helpful diagnostic tool to discriminate sJIA-associated MAS during early onset of the disease from primary or secondary HLH. has been shown to be a major mediator of the inflammatory cascade that underlies sJIA.

After 6 months of treatment 39 patients (69.6%) met criteria for inactive disease. Among 56 patients 17 (30.3%) received anakinra in monotherapy and 39 (69.6%) received anakinra with glucocorticoids. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups for demographic, clinical and laboratory features.13/17 (76.4%) patients treated with anakinra alone and 26/39 (66.6%) patients treated with anakinra and glucocorticoids met criteria for CID off glucocorticoids at 6 months (p=0.54). Among the 56 patients, 29 (51.7%) received anakinra within 2 months from disease onset. There were no statistically significant differences for demographic, clinical and laboratory features among patients who started anakinra in the first 2 months from disease onset compared to those that started anakinra after 2 months. At 6 months after beginning of anakinra treatment, 27/29 patients (93.1%) who started anakinra within 2 months from disease onset and 12/27 (44.4%) who started anakinra after 2 months from disease onset reached clinical inactive disease off glucocorticoids (p=0.0001). Patients who started anakinra after the first 2 months from disease onset have a significantly higher risk of non-response (OR=8.06, 95% CI: 2.03-32.0). Conclusion: According with several observations, anakinra is effective in a significant proportion of patients with sJIA. A possible approach to introduce IL-1 inhibitor, with or without concomitant glucocorticoids, early in the disease course taking advantage of a \"window of opportunity\" has been suggested. Our observation confirms that earlier treatment with anakinra is associated with a better short-term outcome. Moreover, our results show that beginning of treatment after two months from disease onset is correlated with a high risk of non-response. Introduction: Lung transplantation is still characterized by high morbidity and mortality. Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), the clinical correlate of chronic rejection, highly impacts long-term outcomes. It has been shown that recipients can develop antibodies to self-antigens (sAgs) like collagen V (ColV) and K-\u03b1 1 tubulin (K\u03b11t), and this correlates with the development of BOS. ColV and K\u03b11t are expressed by small airway epithelial cells. The interstitial remodeling that occurs with transplantation seems to enhance ColV and K\u03b11t exposure. Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) is a form of juvenile arthritis characterized by various degree of arthritis and prominent systemic features. In few cases it can be associated with lung involvement, a life-threatening complication, whose exact pathogenetic mechanism is still poorly understood.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results:"}, {"text": "Objectives: We decided to explore the possible role of antibodies to lung sAgs in a single patient affected by sJIA complicated by several episodes of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), interstitial lung disease and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.

We considered positive values more than 218 ng/ml for K\u03b11t and 160 ng/ml for colV according to the study by Hachem et al.

The correlation analysis between ColV and WBC, Hb, PLT, CRP and ferritin did not show statistical significance. However, the review of clinical charts showed that at the time of 6 out of the 7 positive samples there was fever, worsening of respiratory symptom like persistent cough, increase respiratory rate or exertional tachypnea, mild flare of sJIA or MAS. Twelve of the 13 negative samples were collected when the patient was in stable clinical conditions, only 1 sample was collected during an episode of early MAS. The trend of K\u03b11t antibodies did not match completely with ColV. Considering the previously reported normality range, we did not find any positive result. Therapy was a combination of steroid, cyclosporin, anakinra, canakinumab, interleukin 18-binding protein, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG). All the treatments, the dosage of steroid and cyclosporin as well as timing of IVIG were tailored on clinical conditions and laboratory test so it is difficult to define a clear association with ColV antibodies values. Conclusion: The pathogenic mechanism of sJIA-associated lung diseases is still poorly understood. This preliminary retrospective study showed a good correlation between antibodies to ColV and clinical disease activity, in particular with MAS and worsening of respiratory symptoms. The lack of correlation with laboratory markers can be explain by the prompt modification of treatment according to the clinical condition of the patient and the retrospective nature of the study. Similar to what happens in BOS after transplantation, we hypothesize that during a flare of sJIA or an episode of MAS the inflammation and cellular damage expose sAgs, normally hidden, to the circulation, worsening and amplifying the immune response. This preliminary evidence of increased pulmonary sAgs in sJIA with lung involvement represents a possible paradigm shift in the pathophysiology of the disease although we need more evidence prospectively collected in a larger population.

LPSstimulated primary human monocytes isolated from healthy donors were analyzed for cytokine expression on gene and protein level over time as well as following various drug or recombinant cytokine treatments.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Results: In plasma of healthy individuals subjected to LPS rechallenge experiments we initially observed that, in contrast to TNF\u03b1, IL-6 or IL-1\u03b2, the IL-18 levels were unaffected by LPS-tolerance. Similarly, in endotoxin desensitization experiments on primary human monocytes, IL-18 gene expression was resistent to endotoxin tolerance and appeared to rather benefit from endotoxin re-challenge. When studying time kinetics of cytokine gene expression, we found that IL-1 and IL-18 followed identical secretion but completely divergent gene expression patterns, thus providing an explanation for observations on IL18 expression in LPS re-challenge experiments. When studying triggers for the observed attenuated gene expression kinetics of IL-18, we found that both IL-18 gene and protein expression upon LPS-stimulation of primary human monocytes was not affected by other prominent inflammatory cytokines but was sensitive to interference with JAK/STAT-signaling and could be modulated by type I interferon priming of cells or STAT1 gain-of-function. While by itself type I interferon did not induce IL-18 expression, IFN\u03b2-neutralization during LPSstimulation blunted IL18 transcription.

Results: 5\\22 patients developed early BCG-related IS (4/11 prior to tocilizumab introduction, and only 1/11with tocilizumab). Three of them presented at days +4, +6 and +12 after HSCT with sustained fever, focal BCGitis exacerbation and one additionally developed macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). All received therapy with steroids and IL-1 inhibitors, in one of them IS symptoms were controlled, but eventually all three died shortly after. One patient without signs of BCGitis before HSCT at day +38 developed IS with symptoms of systemic BCG infection and MAS. He was successfully treated with combination of etoposide and IL-6 receptor inhibitorstocilizumab 10mg/kg. In one patient local BCGitis resolved without treatment. In most cases of early IS significant elevation of TCRgd cell level was observed. Six patients (5/6 with tocilizumab prophylaxis ) had immune recovery associated IS 2,5 -5,5 months after HSCT (M 4,4 months), accompanied by CD3+ lymphocytes increase in peripheral blood. Symptoms included focal BCGitis in all 6 (5 of them had no BCGitis before HSCT), fever in 3, lymphadenopathy in 3, MAS in 1. In four patients monotherapy of anakinra 7-12mg/kg/day was used with full response within 2-4 weeks. They were later switched to canakinumab 5mg/kg every 4 weeks for the next 1-3 months. In one patient IS was controlled by 2 infusions of tocilizumab 10mg/kg every 4 weeks. The patient who developed MAS received anakinra 10mg/kg in combination with steroids with full resolution of symptoms. Conclusion: BCG vaccinated SCID patients are at high risk of BCGrelated early IS after HSCT. Anticytokine therapy with IL6 receptor inhibitor is an effective option for prevention of early BCG-related IS. IL1 inhibitors lead to full resolution of BCG-related immune recovery IS.Evidence-based protocols for IS prevention and treatment are needed. . Peripheral blood was the stem cell source in most cases (n 32). Most received cyclosporine (CsA) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as GVHD prophylaxis (n 37). One did not engraft, needing a rapid second HSCT procedure. 39 patients showed evidence of viral replication (61%) , sometimes from multiple pathogens. Acute GVHD was usually mild and confined to skin (grade I/II, n=27, 49%).Severe acute GVHD occurred in 6 patients (grade III-IV GVHD -10%; 3 died) and two patients experienced extensive chronic GVHD, both deceased.With a median follow-up of 6 .67years (range, 2 months-18 years), 43 of 55 patients were alive and most are either cured and completely healthy (n=21) or significantly improved but with pre-existing end-organ damage (n=11). 19 patients experienced new autoimmune phenomena post-transplant, mostly involving thyroid or hematologic-related.Among the 12 deceased patients, one died from non-transplant related diabetic ketoacidosis, whereas five patients died of GVHD-related causes, five due to infectious causes and one due to extreme induction toxicity, giving a transplant related mortality (TRM) of 20%. Mean age of death was 11 years (range: 0.67-21 years). Conclusion: Allogeneic HSCT can be an effective therapeutic option for severe refractory immune dysregulation in childhood, potentially curative. Appropriate and timely patient selection is fundamental to minimise HSCT-related complications. Introduction: Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy (APECED, also called APS-1), is a phenotypically pleiotropic disease caused by the breakdown of central T-cell tolerance due to mutation of the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene. The presence of autoreactive antibodies (Ab) in APECED has implications for T cell-mediated governance of B-cell tolerance. In particular, soluble factors such as cytokines and antimicrobial peptides are frequent autoantigens in APECED. To fully characterize the humoral response against these and other targets, we tested donor sera for reactivity against more than 3000 secreted proteins using customized protein microarrays.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Results: Applying stringent evaluation methods, we identified more than 50 reactivities enriched among 26 APECED patients relative to 19 healthy donors. We subsequently validated several targets by ELISA, then screened patient IgG memory B cells for Ab of desired specificities using recently developed high-throughput, multiplexed techniques for culture, screening, and cloning. Of particular relevance is the production of Ab against interleukin (IL)-17, given the relationship between TH17-mediated fungal control and chronic candidiasis as a common clinical feature of APECED. To understand the composition and functionality of these Ab, we cloned 15 antigen-specific IgG molecules from 3 APECED patients, and found clear patient-specific skewing toward IL-17A or IL-17F, with some Ab showing crossreactivity. Furthermore, several also bound the heterodimeric IL-17AF in addition to their respective homodimers, and one Ab specifically bound only the heterodimer, the latter one a specificity which has not yet been described. All Ab showed extensive somatic hypermutation, had sub-nanomolar affinities, and functionally block the interaction between IL-17 and its receptor. Conclusion: These features indicate a clear history of interaction with antigen-specific T helper cells, and suggest that autoantibodies in APECED can disrupt immune control, offering insights into the therapeutic control both of APECED and other human diseases. Introduction: Constitutive activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and the consequent elevate production of inflammatory cytokine IL-1\u00df are the pathogenic mechanisms involved in CAPS syndromes.

Introduction: Palindromic rheumatism (PR) is defined as articular and para-articular inflammation that lasts from a few hours to several days, which resolves spontaneously and is associated with increase in inflammatory markers during active disease. It is characterized by recurrent joint manifestations without residual joint destruction. Intermittent hydrarthrosis (IH) is a chronic condition of unknown cause characterized by recurring, temporary episodes of fluid accumulation in the knee. The cause is unknown but allergic and auto-inflammatory mechanisms have been proposed. More recently, specific association with the Mediterranean fever gene, MEFV, has been proposed. So, with some individuals carrying gene mutations (MEFV and also TRAPS-related genes), the native immune system seems to plays a role in the development of IH. Objectives: We evaluated polymorphisms of the genes responsible for AID and clinical characteristics in patients diagnosed as PR with IH.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Methods: Among patients who visited Institute of Rheumatology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, those who fulfills thediagnostic criteria of PR by Gonzal-Lopez L, et al. and manifested IH were enrolled in this study. Polymorphisms of AID genes, clinical manifestations, findings of blood examinations and joint images, treatment responses, and outcome were evaluated retrospectively. Genomic DNA was isolated from the patients' peripheral blood and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the indicated exons of 12 genes: MEFV (exons 1-10), TNFRSF1A (exons 2-4), MVK (exons 9-11), NLRP3 (exon 3-6), NOD2 (exon 4), LI1RN (exons 2-4), IL36RN (exons 2-5), PSMB8 (exons 2, 3, and 5), NALP12 (exons 3 and 9), PSTPIP1 (exons 10 and 11), TNFAIP3, and NLRC4. After cleaning the PCR products, cycle sequencing was carried out using the Big Dye\u00ae Terminator v3.1 kit and analyzed with an ABI 3130xl Prism Genetic Analyzer. Genetic polymorphisms within the above-mentioned genes were examined. Results: Out of six patients (2 males and 4 females, median age: 47.1 years, median age at disease onset: 20 years, median disease duration:12 years), all manifested intermittent knee hydrathrosis lasting for several days with 1-4 weeks of attack intervals. Rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides antibody were not detected in anyone. Knee joint X-ray showed no abnormality in all cases whereas increased synovial fluid and synovium tissue proliferation with positive vascularity by ultrasonography. Polymorphisms of AID genes were identified in all 7 cases as following; MEFV (n=4, all non-exon10), CIAS1(n=1) and TNFRSFIA (n=1). Regarding efficacy of medical treatments, although csDMARDs were not effective in all cases, colchicine applied to 4 with MEFV polymorphism was effective in all the four cases. TNF inhibitors was effective in one of two.

He presented at birth a TORCH-like picture with hepatitis and cytopenias, self-healing in the following months. In his early years, he presented unexplained fever episodes, growth retardation, and poly-articular arthritis. In the subsequent years he developed lipodystrophy, skin rash and lupus pernio. The disease was refractory to several antirheumatic drugs and steroids. At the age of 15 years, DNase2 deficiency was diagnosed by exome analysis (1) . Functional data showed that the disease is due to cGAS-dependent interferon inflammation, paving the way for improved treatments based on the inhibition of the hyperactive pathway.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 820, "end": 823, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Objectives: To describe how the diagnosis impacted on medical choices and overall clinical history of a patient.

With such therapy, he was able to reduce the dosage of steroids and to improve motor capacity. To obtain a more complete control of the disease, ruxolitinib (JAK1/2 inhibitor) was added at the dosage of 10 mg, resulting in a rapid improvement of the headache and of the articular range of motion. In the subsequent six month, the lipodystrophy also showed some improvement, allowing further steroids tapering. However, he developed fatigue, tachycardia and peripheral cyanosis. Cardiologic assessment detected pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and thus the boy started treatment with sildenafil, iloprost, and ambisentan. Considering a possible adverse effect of ruxolitinib, as supported by a single case report (3), we interrupted all immunosuppressive therapies except for steroid boluses, but without any improvement. Moreover, he developed progressive cytopenia and increased interferon signature. Therefore he started again ruxolitinib at an higher dose, together with antimalarials, obtaining a marked drop of pulmonary pressure and an improvement in interferon signature, as described in published cases ofPAH (4) . In few months he got well again, being able to taper steroids. Recently, ruxolitinib was switched to baricitinib, without any evident change in clinical efficacy. Conclusion: The overall clinical improvement and the possibility of reducing the corticosteroid dosage suggest that treatment of our patient can be considered a precision, tailored therapy. Nevertheless, due to the novelty and the rarity of such cases, hard is to disentangle between manifestations of the disease and the effects of treatments that are tailored to each patient without a consistent previous experience, as it is evident for orphan disease. Objectives: To gain further insight in pregnancy, lactation and gynaecological aspect in MKD.

Four participants indicated that they had ever wanted to become pregnant, and all of them conceived spontaneously. One patient reported one pregnancy, and the other three all reported two pregnancies. Median age at first pregnancy was 27 years (range 24-30 years). During all pregnancies, patients remained attack-free without treatment. One of the four patients reported an MKD attack following delivery, and more frequent attacks in the first three months thereafter. During pregnancy, one patient was treated because of pre-eclampsia during the first, and hypertension during her second pregnancy. Five other pregnancies were uncomplicated. All pregnancies resulted in birth of a healthy living child without congenital abnormalities. One patient reported two periods of lactation in two children: one week in the first and 23 weeks in her second child.

Two reported increased attack severity. In four patients, attacks were triggered by menstruation and during menstruation, two patients experienced longer attack duration. During the use of hormonal anticonceptive drugs, one out of eight patients experienced more frequent attacks, while four reported a decrease in frequency. Two patients reported shorter attack duration, while the other six did not notice any change in duration. Two patients were in menopause, one of whom experienced more frequent attacks after menopause. One patient reported a shorter attack duration, while the duration increased in the other patient. Five patients had ever experienced vaginal or vulvar ulcers. Conclusion: During seven pregnancies in female MKD patients, no MKD attacks occured. In one pregnancy delivery triggered an MKD attack, and during the only episode of lactation, MKD attacks were shorter than usual. All seven children were born healthy. As our cohort size was small, it would be interesting to confirm these positive findings in a larger number of patients.

The clinical history disclosed that at the age of 12 and 15 months the patient had two episodes of diffused rash spontaneously resolved in two weeks. From the age of 18 months recurrent hip pain, defined as transient synovitis of the hip, was reported. It was treated successfully with non-steroideal antinflammatory drugs (NSAID) but pain would reappear once stopped the treatment. Clinical evaluation showed polyarticular symmetrical arthritis of wrists, elbows, knees, proximal interphalangeal joints. Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) diagnosis was made and treatment with NSAID and Methotrexate was started without significant improvement; therefore, Etanercept was added and NSAID stopped. Screening of uveitis was performed every six months. Persisting arthritis of right wrist after 7 months of therapy, ultrasound was performed showing tenosynovitis. Therefore, she underwent intra-articular injection of long-acting glucocorticoids with partial response. At the age of 4 years, she presented papuloerythematous rash, mainly on the trunk, infiltrated and confluent in plaques; skin biopsy was performed resulting consistent with granulomatous disease sarcoid-like. Suspecting BS, molecular analysis was done. At the age of 5 years, she presented scotoma and visual loss; the ocular assessment found bilateral anterior uveitis and posterior bilateral synechiae. She started systemic glucocorticoid therapy and shifted from Etanercept to Adalimumab with improvement of both ocular and articular disease. The molecular analysis of NOD2 showed missense mutation p.R334W (c.1000C<T) consistent with BS. Currently, the articular and cutaneous manifestations are controlled by the combined therapy with Adalimumab and Methotrexate; the ocular disease evolved into irido-lenticular synechiae, some mutton-fat keratic precipitates, band keropathy. She started topical treatment with improvement. Her brother (patient 2, age 3 years) at the age of 34 months, developed boggy tenosynovitis and face papuloerythematous rash; inflammatory cellular deposits at anterior segment were disclosed at ophthalmic evaluation.

Introduction: Blau Syndrome is a rare auto-inflammatory disease with variants in NOD2 and an important differential diagnosis for periodic fever syndrome. Patients typically present in the first year of life with fever and a triad (skin manifestation, arthritis and uveitis). The patients could develop pan-uveitis, cardiac manifestation or even renal diseases. Objectives: Our objective is to expand the differential diagnosis of periodic fever syndrome by characterizing a patient with atypical clinical features of Blau Syndrome harboring the most common known genetic variant. Methods: We used standard laboratory assessment of inflammatory markers, MRI and liver biopsy. To confirm the diagnosis we used next generation sequencing to identify NOD2 variants.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Results: A 2-year-old male child presented to the hospital with recurrent fevers and decompensating heart failure due to arterial hypertension. He could not walk because of swelling in both ankles and additionally had swelling of the wrists. The past and the family history were unremarkable. On clinical examination, his weight and length were below the 3rd percentile. Skin examination showed erythematous exanthema on the trunk. There were also hepatosplenomegaly and a cardiac murmur present. At that time, he had been treated for heart failure and hypertension. After his medical condition was stable, further work-up had been done to look for the cause of his symptoms. CRP was massively increased. Infections and malignancy were excluded. There were no signs of immunodeficiency and no signs of uveitis. With the presented symptoms and signs the child was finally diagnosed with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

His symptoms improved under therapy, but he was still not in remission, with recurrent fevers, arthritis and high inflammatory markers. In this condition he was transferred to our center. Here, we started the treatment according to the following table: However, there was no full remission, so whole body MRI was performed, which showed signs of liver cirrhosis, which was not explained by the disease and medications. Liver biopsy showed liver fibrosis with signs of inflammation and granulation formation. We did a molecular genetic analysis (fever panel) which showed a heterozygous mutation in NOD2 gene (c.1001G>A; p.Arg334Gln, Exon 4), which causes Blau Syndrome.

In our case the patient presented with heart failure, hypertension, arthritis, skin rash and also hepatomegaly. Episodic fever was noted. Our patient did not develop uveitis, under the treatment with MTX and the other medications which are all effective against uveitis. The recommended therapy for Blau Syndrome is to use steroid daily in addition to immunosuppressants. Different types of immunosuppressants have been used with a controversial effect, but TNF-alpha inhibitors have been shown to be most effective in treating patients with or without uveitis. Our patient showed partial response under the therapy with MTX, IL-1\u03b2 antagonist and IL-6 antagonist.

Introduction: Disease awareness, diagnostic tools and therapeutic options for hereditary periodic fevers (HRF) have significantly improved in recent years but whether patients' diagnostic pathway and outcome have consistently ameliorated remains to be elucidated. Objectives: To investigate presentation, genotypes, clinical characteristics, natural history and response to treatment in patients with HRF referred to our centre between 1998 and 2018. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of all patients diagnosed with HRF according to genetics and/or clinical Eurofever classification criteria. All patients underwent genetic analysis and full clinical evaluation including investigation for possible amyloid disease. Results: 213 patients (FMF 166, TRAPS 33, CAPS 5, MKD 9) were included, 10% of them are of non-Caucasian ancestry and 41% had a positive family history. Overall 61 genotypes were identified, with 3 novel gene variants, not reported to date. 87% of FMF patients had \u00b3 1 clearly pathogenic variant, the most common being p.Met694Val. 79% of TRAPS patients had a clearly pathogenic mutation, affecting a cysteine residue in 15 cases. Median age at disease onset was 12 years (range 0.5-51). Median age at diagnosis was 34 years . 79 % of patients presented in adult age, of which 35 (31 FMF and 4 TRAPS) reported symptom onset after the age of 20 (median 30, range 21-51). Median time from disease onset to diagnosis in patients referred in adult age was 25 years (0.5-61). Fever was the most common reported symptoms (in 96% of patients), followed by abdominal flares. Median number of inflammatory attacks was 8 in FMF . A chronic disease course was seen in 50% of TRAPS patients. AA amyloidosis was diagnosed in 22 patients (10.3%). Median age at AA onset was 40 years (range 12-77) with a median time from HRF onset to appearance of renal amyloidosis of 33.5 (8-56). In 19 cases (86%) the diagnosis of HRF was established after AA amyloidosis presentation. Regarding diagnostic delay, presenting features and rate of AA amyloidosis, no significant differences was observed throughout different time periods (1998-2004; 2005-2011; 2012-2018) . In patients with FMF, complete response to colchicine is observed in 88%, with a median dose of 1 mg/day (range 0.5-2); partial response and/or limited tolerability was reported in 29 patients (22.7%). 7 pts were shifted to anti-IL1 agents, including two kidney transplanted patients due to AA amyloidosis, with complete response and good safety profile Conclusion: Diagnostic delay hasn't significantly reduced over time in spite of increasing awareness and optimized diagnostic tools. A substantial proportion of patients is still recognized in adult age and therefore remain at high risk ofdeveloping long-term renal complications. Introduction: RNF213 (Ring Finger Protein 213) was first identified as a major susceptibility gene for moyamoya arteriopathy, which is a progressive steno-occlusive disease of the cerebral arteries and the development of abnormal basal collateral vessels. Several other studies have since reported an association of RNF213 variants with various vasculopathies, pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease and stroke. In vivo experiments demonstrated abnormal development of brain vessels in rnf213 knockdown zebrafish, while suppression of both arteriogenesis and angiogenesis were observed in knockout mice.Consequently, RNF213 may not be just a susceptibility gene for moyamoya, but could also play a role in systemic vasculopathy, and be an important mimic of Takayasu arteritis (TA) of the young.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3064, "end": 3097, "text": "(1998-2004; 2005-2011; 2012-2018)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Objectives: To review the phenotype of vasculopathy/vasculitis in a cohort of patients referred for genetic testing where rare or novel variants in RNF213 were identified. Methods: RNF213 variants were screened as part of a nextgeneration sequencing screening strategy for patients with suspected vasculitis or autoinflammation. Variants that were either novel or less than 1% in public genetic databases were considered as candidate for the purposes of this study. Results: We identified 54/272 patients with at least one novel or rare RNF213 variant. Fifteen/54 had vasculopathy or suspected vasculitis without clearly defined aetiology (Table) . Amongst these cases, there were two children with TA, and a third case with familial moyamoya arteriopathy with 3 affected family members. The first case was a Turkish girl, with a novel heterozygous RNF213 mutation p.L5003V; predicted to be damaging, who presented with hypertension at the age of 4 years, with vascular phenotype suggestive of TA, without cerebral involvement. The second TA case was a Dutch girl presenting with systemic inflammation and occlusive vasculopathy of multiple arterial beds, including renal and brain. She has 2 heterozygous variants in RNF213: p.P1721L and p.K4732E. The p.P1721L variant has previously been reported in cohort of patients with moyamoya arteriopathy, and is predicted to be damaging. The third case was a child from a family investigated for suspected familial moyamoya arteriopathy affecting 3 family members. The proband had a heterozygousp.D4013N RNF213 missense mutation, previously reported in association with moyamoya. He had typical occlusive cerebral arteriopathy and collateral vessel formation. This mutation segregated with the same phenotype in the affected father and sister. Vasculopathies observed in the other cases are summarised in the Table.

Molecular defects identified in NLRP3 in children P1, P2, and P3 were p.Asp305His, p.Thr349Ile, and p.Ala352Val, respectively. Conclusion: Delay in diagnosis, lack of awareness, and lack of access to anti-IL1 agents contributed to significant morbidity and mortality in our patients. Thalidomide can be tried to reduce the inflammatory burden in patients with NOMID in settings where there is no access to anti-IL1 agents Introduction: Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) is one of the best known monogenic auto- inflammatory disorder resulting from an autosomal dominant variation in the TNF super family receptor 1A (TNFRSF1A) gene. Objectives: To define best treatment approach in patients with TRAPS and effect on long-term outcomes. Methods: We reviewed all data on patients with TNFRSF1A variants enrolled in the Eurofever/EUROTRAPS international registry. Results: Data on 290 patients were available. Patients with R92Q, P46L or intronic variants (49%) displayed milder disease than 147 patients with mutations affecting other coding regions, with less frequent abdominal pain and skin rashes (P<0.01), higher efficacy rate of colchicine as maintenance treatment, and none developed AA amyloidosis. Almost 90% of patients with exon mutations required maintenance therapy. Anti-interleukin (IL) 1\u03b2 drugs were the most frequently used (47 patients), with the highest efficacy rate (>90% complete response), while Etanercept was less effectively used and discontinued in 72% of patients. No patients on anti-IL1\u03b2 treatment developed amyloidosis and 10 patients with amyloidosis have been successfully treated with anti IL-1 agents with preservation of native renal function in 7 and excellent long-term transplant function in 2. Nine women had a history of failure to conceive and seven had successful pregnancies without fertility treatment following complete disease control with anti-IL1\u03b2 drugs. Long term safety profiles for anti IL-1 agents were excellent even in the presence of comorbidity. Conclusion: Anti-IL1\u03b2 drugs are the best maintenance treatment in TRAPS with potential to reverse the most serious disease complications of AA amyloidosis and infertility. The diagnosis of TRAPS should be considered very carefully in patients carrying R92Q, P46L or intronic TNFRSF1A variants. Introduction: Majeed syndrome is a very rare autosomal recessive, autoinflammatory disorder characterized by a triad of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, congenital dyserythropoietic anemia and neutrophilic dermatosis caused by LPIN2 gene mutation. 14 mutation positive cases identified till 2017 have been reported from the Middle East. Objectives: We describe our brief experience with the second family with a child afflicted with Majeed syndrome from India. Methods: A 4 year old male child born of a consanguineous marriage, presented with recurrent irregular episodes of fever with irritability and failure to thrive since 5 months of age. At 9 months of age parents noticed, small skin 'boils' over the trunk and limbs, which recurred every 15-20 days along with the fever and stayed for 4-5 days. At 18 months, parents noticed that he refused to bear weight and walk and would cry on handling.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P2012"}, {"text": "Gradually the episodes of painful small skin boils, limb pains which the parents could not localize and fever increased in frequency and after multiple pediatric, orthopaedic consults he was referred to us by a pediatric neurologist who had been referred the case to rule out Fabry disease. The pediatric neurologist had asked for whole exome sequencing and referred the case to us for clinical evaluation sensing a musculoskeletal rather than neurological disease. Results: On examination the weight (10 kg) and height (83 cm) were below 3 rd centile. He had pallor, painful swelling over the left tibia, motor delay with hamstring tightness and mild bilateral knee contractures. Language and social milestones were normal. There were no skin lesions at the time of evaluation and systemic examination was normal. Review of his past investigations revealed a persistent, microcytic hypochromic anemia (Hemoglobin 8.3-10.6 gm/dl) with raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (54-105 mm/hr), C-reactive protein (37-98 mg/l) and platelets (4.3-8.9 x10 3 cu mm). His genetic mutation for LPIN 2 returned positive with homozygous missense variation in exon 17 of the LPIN2 gene resulting in amino acid substitution of cysteine to arginine at codon 736 (p.Arg736Cys;ENST00000261596). Meanwhile a bone scintigraphy done, showed increased vascularity and osseous activity in proximal shaft of left tibia with mild osseous activity at D9 and D10 vertebrae. A bone marrow examination was not performed as a conclusive mutation diagnosis was obtained.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "He showed a dramatic response to Ibuprofen with abatement of fever, no skin boils and improvement of general mood and playfulness.

He has received four doses of Pamidronate (cumulative dose 12 mg/kg) over one year and has gained weight (11.5kg) and height (96cm), remained afebrile with full physical activity and no new skin lesions. Conclusion: Paucity of awareness amongst the medical community about these rare illnesses are responsible for diagnostic delays and complex referral pathways. With the high rates of consanguinity in several parts of our country we believe that we are seeing just the tip of the iceberg of monogenic autoinflammatory diseases. Due to non availability of Interleukin-1 inhibitors in India, which are highly effective at controlling osseous and systemic inflammation in Majeed syndrome , we have limited treatment options to offer to our patient. We have offered educational resources and genetic counselling to the family. Introduction: Spondyloenchondrodysplasia (SPENCD) is a very rare genetic immuno-osseous dysplasia characterized by skeletal anomalies (short stature, platyspondyly) and enchondromas in the long bones or pelvis. SPENCD may have a heterogeneous clinical spectrum with neurological involvement or autoimmune manifestations, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Objectives: We describe a child from India with SPENCD, who presented with features of SLE , skeletal dysplasia and enchondromas Methods: A 9 year old male born of second degree consanguineous marriage presented with fever , oral ulcers, leg pain with morning stiffness since 1 month. He was worked up by his primary paediatrician for pyrexia of unknown origin and a summary of laboratory tests performed included, hemogram with hemoglobin 8.7 gm/dl, white cell count 5900 /cu mm platelet 1.85 x 10 3 cu mm, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 100 mm/hr, antinuclear antibody 4+.Suspecting connective tissue disease child was referred to us for further evaluation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Results: On further enquiry, there was past history of multiple medical visits for poor growth since infancy and a bony swelling of the right forearm leading to incomplete supination for which he was operated at age 5 years. No details were available. His milestones were appropriate for age with normal scholastic performance.His weight (16.9 kg) and height (113cm) were below the 3rd centile. On examination, he had pallor, facial rash, mucositis of the palate, generalised lymphadenopathy, triangular facies, prominent anteverted ears, prominent conjunctival blood vessels, supernumerary teeth, right elbow swelling, paucity of body hair On systemic examination abdomen was soft with hepatosplenomegaly and other systems were normal. On further investigation his dsDNA was 4+ , Direct Coombs test was positive, C3 -19.1 mg/dl C4 -3.36 mg/dl, urinalysis was normal, Anti Ro and lupus anticoagulant were negative and APLA IgG was positive and APLA IgM negative. The diagnosis of SLE was confirmed. Considering, consanguineous marriage, short stature and right elbow swelling with other subtle dysmorphisms described above, a syndromic form of lupus was suspected and a skeletal Xray analysis showed extensive areas of metaphyseal abnormalities with epiphyseal remodelling changes and platyspondyly. Hence a clinical diagnosis of Spondyloenchrondrodysplasia (SPENCD) was considered. Sanger sequencing of ACP5 encoding the protein TRAP revealed homozygous non sense mutation (c.849T>A, p.(Tyr283stop) confirming the diagnosis of SPENCD.He was further investigated for diseases associated with SPENCD, which revealed normal thyroid function, IGF -1, immunoglobulin levels and 2DECHO.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "He was started on hydroxychloroquine (5mg/kg/day), oral prednisolone (0.6mg/kg/day), low dose aspirin, supplements and was advised sun protection.

He has gained weight (20.6 kg), height (114 cm), is afebrile with no arthritis, mucositis or rash. Conclusion: SPENCD is an immunosseous dysplasia and a very rare cause of monogenic lupus. This, is the second case of SPENCD reported from India. The entity should be suspected in children with SLE with a consanguineous background who have short stature and bony abnormalities. We expand the phenotype here with additional dysmorphic features comprising supernumerary teeth, triangular facies, prominent anteverted ears and prominent conjunctival blood vessels not described before to the best of our knowledge. Objectives: To describe the clinical and laboratory profile and follow up of a cohort of seven children with hereditary complement deficiency.

Neurologic features are frequently seen while renal manifestations are not. Neuroregression responds to immunosuppressive therapy with children improving on their mental, motor and speech milestones. Except in one patient major life-threatening infections have not been a challenge despite high infection rates in the community coupled with immunosuppression.

Therefore, the objective of this study is to characterize AIS in a LA population. Methods: Fourteen countries from all over Latin America were invited to participate in this observational and descriptive study collecting data on clinical, laboratory, genetic characteristics and treatment response of polygenic and monogenic AIS. Inclusion criteria were patients with clinical and/or genetic diagnosis of AIS. Data were prospectively collected in a web-based data bank. Results: At the time of this report, 162 patients from Brazil (78.8%) and Argentina (21.2%) had been included: 52% males, 75% Caucasians; median age at symptoms onset was 2.1 years, median age at diagnosis of 6.9 years, and median disease duration was 8.5 years. The main AIS diagnosis were: PFAPA (28%), CNO (18%), FMF (16%), PGA (10%), CAPS (9%), HIDS (7%), TRAPS (5%) and PAPA (3%).The diagnosis was made clinically in 62% of patients (either they were PFAPA or CNO patients or presented a negative genetic test); 33% of patients were diagnosed by both clinical features and genetic tests and 5% of patients had no clinical but only a positive genetic test that was performed due to family history. Clinical features were consistent with the genetic abnormalities found. Genetic testing had been done in different laboratories using either Sanger sequencing and/or NGS. One of both acute phase reactants (either ESR or CRP) elevation occurred in 91% patients. The most frequently used medication were corticosteroids (66%, partial response in more than a half of patients) and colchicine (29.6%, total or partial response in half of patients). Regarding biological agents, etanercept was used in 11.1% with a partial response in most patients. IL1 blockers were prescribed in 11.1% but with a total response in the majority who used them.

Objectives: To report and describe clinical features, laboratory and treatment of six cases of CNO. Methods: Retrospective descriptive review of six children and adolescents with CNO treated at a specialized center, between 2010 and 2018. Results: Four (66%) out of 6 patients were girls with mean age of 15.5 years (range 11-20.4) and mean follow-up time of 5.1 years (range 1.5-10.2). Mean age of first symptoms was 10.3 years (range 0.7-15.3) and mean age at diagnosis was 12.8 years (range 9.5-16). The most affected sites were metaphysis and diaphysis of long bones. Median number of initial bony lesions was 2.8 (range 1-7) at onset and 3.5 (range 1-8) during the follow up. Two (33.3%) patients had recurrence in clavicle, one (16.6%) in temporomandibular joint and two in mandible. One (16.6%) patient presented with fever and dyserythropoietic anemia, receiving diagnosis of Majeed syndrome.Five (83.3%) patients presented with arthralgia and bone pain, and two (33.3%) of them had acute migratory polyarthritis. All patients had increased acute phase reactants and radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging alterations.All patients received NSAIDs therapy (indomethacin) with clinical remission in half of the cases.Three (50%) patients received bisphosphonates (alendronate), and one took methotrexate associated with alendronate. All patients had good clinical response and two achieved clinical remission. Conclusion: The awareness of characteristic features of CNO is important for an early diagnosis and can help avoiding unnecessary diagnostic procedures and prolonged antibiotic therapy. Exceptionally, only one mutation can be found.

From the beginning he suffered from strong, unexplained abdominal pain. His CRP values and leukocytes were only moderately elevated. He was first treated in another hospital for infection, but did not respond to broad spectrum antibiotics. He was transferred for further rheumtologic evaluation. Initial blood testing yielded only slightly elevated CrP levels but high ferritine >2000ug/l. Bone marrow aspiration showed strong granulopoiesis, no malignant infiltration or MAS. Ultrasound revealed hepatosplenomegaly, moderate serositis and cervical lymphadenopathy.

High dose methylprednisolonetherapy showed good clinical and laboratory response. On tapering of corticosteroids (CS) however, a rapid relapse resulted and the patient was put on tocilizumab 12mg/kg/2w and ultimately canakinumab 4mg/kg/4w, both of which were not effective. Ciclosporin A (CSA) 5mg/kg/d was added 01/17 due to incomplete control of inflammation and persistent risk of MAS. Further laboratory evaluation was obtained. IL-18 levels were above the detectable level of 20.000pg/ml. Panel diagnostic for autoinflammatory diseases showed a heterozygous mutation of unknown relevance in the PSMB-8 gene, a gene hosting several known mutations responsible for interferonopathies. Interferon signature in our patient showed a very high score, ultimately leading to the hypothesis of type 1 interfonopathy. We started a treatment with baricitinib (BAR) 05/17 and continued CSA and CS. The patient showed a rapid response, BAR was continuously raised to a dose of 4x2mg/day with complete remission. CS were tapered carefully and stopped 08/17. Ultimately CSA was tapered and stopped 09/17. Six weeks after discontinuation of CSA while on monotherapy with BAR 4x2mg/kg, a moderate clinical relapse occured, the interferon signature showing an extremely high score. Thus CSA was restarted and a course of CS was necessary to induce remission. Since 01/17 our patient is off CS and shows a complete remision with excellent tolerance of the tretment with BAR+CSA.

Unprenylated Rap1A was also identifiable by western blotting in the MKD patients that had the greatest defect in Rab prenylation, but this western blot approach was considerably less sensitive than the in vitro prenylation assay. Importantly, the defect in Rab and Rap1A prenylation was absent in individuals with FMF, CAPS or TRAPS, and absent in individuals with heterozygous mutations in MVK or healthy volunteers. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that protein prenylation is indeed defective in individuals with MKD. Furthermore, the accumulation of unprenylated Rab proteins in PBMCs is a sensitive and specific biomarker of MKD that distinguishes this autoinflammatory disease from FMF, CAPS and TRAPS and could therefore be used to aid diagnosis. Introduction: Early onset sarcoidosis (EOS) / Blau Syndrome is NOD2 gene-associated chronic autoinflammatory disease characterized by the classic triad of skin rash, chronic symmetric arthritis, and recurrent uveitis.

Granulomatous interstitial nephritis and granulomatous inflammation of the liver were detected in the biopsies, drug-induced sarcoidosis was considered in our patient, and ETA was stopped. MTX and systemic steroid were continued. Boggy synovitis and, camptodactyly were appeared on follow up. We reevaluated all clinical signs, and NOD2 gene analysis was performed 3 years later. M513T heterozygous mutation was detected. There was consanguinity, but no family history Thus, we diagnosed EOS. In the last three years, the disease activations included arthritis, interstitial lung disease, interstitial nephritis, and bilateral panuveitis. The treatment was systemic steroids on attack periods, MTX, and infliximab (INF). Lastly, she was admitted to our clinic with a headache and vomiting in June 2018. These complaints were there for two weeks and were increasing especially in the morning. She was on Methotrexate (15 mg/w sc), prednisolone (10 mg/d) and infliximab (200 mg/mt) A high fever, high blood pressure, lethargy, diplopia, and bilateral papilledema were detected on PE. Laboratory examination revealed leukocytosis, increased ESR and CRP and pyuria. E. coli was detected in the urine culture. Brain MRI and MRI angiography were normal. The patient underwent repeat lumbar punctures and opening pressures were 23 cm/H2O and 38 cm/H2O, respectively. Study of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed pleocytosis (120 leukocyte /mm3 and), the protein level of 0.35 g/l, normal chloride, and glucose level. CSF cultures were negative. Serology of viruses and Mycobacterium tuberculosis were negative. Electroencephalography (EEG) showed delta brush waves compatible with encephalitis. The pediatric neurology department considered autoimmune encephalitis. CSF limbic encephalitis antibody panel that included NMDA, AMPA1, AMPA2, CASPR2, LGI1, GABA B antibodies was performed. ANA, ANA subgroups were negative. After the urinary tract infection treatment, the fever was resolved. Intravenous immunoglobulin was given at a dose of 400 mg/kg/d for 5 days. But lethargy, diplopia, and papilledema were not resolved. Then the patient was treated with pulse intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g/kg/day for 5 days). After this treatment, his neurological findings improved rapidly. Infliximab, methotrexate, prednisolone (40 mg/d) were continued. At the last visit, neurological and ophthalmologic examinations were normal. Conclusion: Early onset sarcoidosis is an autoinflammatory disease. Autoimmunity is not expected in EOS. Delta brush waves seen in EEG are frequently were detected in autoimmune encephalitis. We could not distinguish that this case is autoimmune encephalitis or neurological involvement of EOS. We wanted to present this interesting case to contribute to the literature.

Results: Results for HLA-B27, ANA, ENA, anti-dsDNA, ANCA, AMA, LKM1, immunoglobulin A/G/M/E, ACE, Transglutaminase-AK-IgA/ IgG, C1q, C2, C3, C4, CH50 were normal. S100-A8/A9 was only moderately elevated. Possible infectious causes were ruled out. A liver biopsy was performed with the result of slight non-specific inflammation. Ultimately molecular genetic panel diagnostic for known rare autoinflammatory conditions was performed and showed no mutations. With progression of symptoms and high steroid burden further treatment options were evaluated. Due to the resemblance of some disease aspects with the clinical picture of interferonopathies we ordered a type 1 interferon signature showing a very strong activation. Type 1 interferonopathy was thus suspected and treatment with the Janus kinase inhibitor baricitinib was initiated, which lead to an immediate improvement of all symptoms and a regression of liver enzymes, ferritin and inflammatory markers. A control of the type 1 interferon signature 4 weeks after start of the treatment presented a normalization of the interferon activity confirming the suspected differential Diagnosis of a Type-1-Interferonopathie. Two months into treatment the patient is currently healthy and shows very good tolerance to the medication with no side effect to this point. Conclusion: Type 1 interferonopathies are autoinflammatory diseases with a very heterogenous clinical manifestation. Symptoms can include every organic system, most common are recurrent fever, cutaneous and neurological manifestations. They should be considered as a differential diagnosis to systemic autoinflammatory diseases like systemic juvenile arthritis. In this case we present a girl with possible type 1 interferonopathy with no relevant medical antecedents or familial history of autoinflammation. While extensive genetic testing in this girl yielded no known genetic cause of the disease, evaluation of the type 1 interferon signature led to a specific treatment with a Janus kinase inhibitor, which ultimately showed a rapid improvement with complete remission. Considering the short duration of treatment to this point, the further disease course needs to be monitored carefully. Introduction: Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS)a group of rare monogenic hereditary autoinflammatory diseases (AIDs). CAPS is clinically characterized by fever, urticarial skin rash, musculoskeletal features, eye manifestations, neurological symptoms, hearing loss, acute phase markers. There is a high risk of amyloidosis, renal failure. Age of onset may be different. The diagnosis is sometimes delayed for many years. IL-1 inhibition (anakinra, canakinumab) is indicated for the whole spectrum of CAPS (FCAS, MWS, CINCA/NOMID) Objectives: To present clinical, laboratory and demographic characteristics and therapy of patients with CAPS in the practice of an adult rheumatologist Methods: The study included 11 inpatients or outpatients with CAPS, who were on examination in Federal center of Rheumatology (10 women with MWS, 1 boy with CINCA/NOMID), aged from 18 to 60 years. All conducted standard rheumatological examination, including ESR, CRP.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P2025"}, {"text": "Results: The age of the onset was 0-51 years, in 10 of 11 in childhood.

Delay in diagnosis varied from 1 to 44 years, 1 -6 years in 2 pts, 15-17 years in 4 pts, above30 years in 4 pts. The fever was in all pts, urticarial skin rash in 9 (81,8%), musculo-skeletal manifestations in 11 (mostly benign oligoarthritis, 4 -polyarthritis). 1 patient with polyarthritis had comorbid pathology -rheumatoid arthritis. Eye manifestations (conjunctivitis, corneal dystrophy, uveitis) had 9 (81,8%), sensorineural hearing loss -6 (54,5%). 2 pts had abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, 4headache. Duringthedisease all pts had increased ESR, CRP. Among our pts there were 5 family cases. Mutations in the NLRP3 gene in heterozygous state were revealed in all patients except one boy with CINCA/NOMID. 6 pts before diagnosis received corticosteroids, treatment withIL-1 inhibitors was initiated in 7 pts (canakinumab -6, anakinra-1) with a complete or partial response in all pts. Introduction: The most prominent pulmonary manifestations of FMF are chest attacks due to pleuritis. It occurs in 45% of patients, sometimes as a sole manifestation of disease. However, in Armenians pleuritis is more prevalent than arthritis-84% in 3 series of total 335 FMF patients 1 .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P2025"}, {"text": "Objectives: To reveal the spectrum of possible pulmonary manifestations in FMF patients and explore correlations with inflammatory biomarkers. Methods: Pulmonary screening of a random group of 155 Armenian patients with FMF who had pleuritic chest attacks. Pulmonary function test (PFT) by spirometry-FEV 1 (L), FEV 1 %predicted, FVC(L), FVC% predicted, FEV 1 /FVC%; TTE for systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP), chest x-ray and HRCT-scan. C-reactive protein (CRP) by immunoturbidimetry, SAA by ELISA, and capillary blood gases (PO2, PCO2, SpO2) were measured. All tests were done in attack free period. Patients were followed prospectively for 5 years. We demonstrated that FMF patients with amyloidosis have hypoxia and it may have an additive pathogenetic effect for pulmonary complications. We have shown for the first time that patients without renal amyloidosis may develop pulmonary hypertension. These findings raising an intriguing question about pathogenetic mechanisms. We assume that the respiratory symptoms in FMF result from continuous low-grade inflammation. This conclusion drawn from the significantly raised levels of inflammatory biomarkers, CRP and SAA. The present study is the first to consider clinically relevant confounders. Pleural adhesions were frequent radiologic findings (38%). We reveal impaired pulmonary function and gas exchange in patients with amyloidosis. CRP but not SAA well correlates with PO 2 , SpO 2 , and FEV 1 /FVC in FMF-amyloidosis group. Moreover, we reveal correlations between CRP and PO 2 in FMF patients group without amyloidosis. While pleural adhesions, atelectasis and pulmonary infiltrates lead to restriction, obstruction causes hypoxia. A physician, taking care of FMF patient with chest attack, can face various pulmonary manifestations and should aware of their origin. Introduction: Deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 (DADA2) is an autosomal recessive disorder that manifests with fever, rash, hypocellular bone marrow, early-onset vasculitis, and propensity to ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Over 60 pathogenic mutations, mostly missense variants, have been identified to date.

Sequencing analysis did not identify pathogenic mutations in DBA-associated genes and a chromosomal microarray did not detect duplications or deletions. Interestingly, several regions of homozygosity were identified in the proband, one of which comprises the ADA2 gene locus. Sanger sequencing of ADA2 did not identify a pathogenic variant in the patient. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis (MLPA) identified a homozygous duplication of a region comprising exon 7 of ADA2 in the proband, her affected sister, her affected father, and a heterozygous duplication of this region in the proband's mother. Subsequent qRT-PCR experiments confirmed a complete loss of RNA-expression in the individuals homozygous for the duplication. Reduced ADA2 enzyme activity corroborated the qRT-PCR findings. Long-range PCR and long-read sequencing analysis were performed to localize the breakpoints of the duplication. The second index patient is a 17-year-old female who presented with a history of ischemic strokes, livedo rashes and vasculitis. She was found to be heterozygous for a known pathogenic variant in ADA2 (c.1358A>G, p.Y453C). This variant was inherited from the proband's father and is also present in her three at the time unaffected siblings. The ADA2 enzyme activity assay revealed that the proband and two of her siblings have low to absent ADA2 enzyme activity. Her parents, as well as a fourth sibling, exhibited ADA2 enzyme levels in the carrier range. Haplotype analyses revealed that the three children with low ADA2 activity inherited the same allele from their mother while the fourth sibling inherited the unaffected maternal allele. WGS of the mother and the 3 affected children identified a novel canonical splice site variant (ADA2: c.-47+2T>C) in an alternative ADA2 transcript (NM_001282225.1) present in all four individuals. Sanger sequencing analysis confirmed the segregation of this variant with the disease. This variant is absent from population databases and predicted to effect splicing. RNA expression analysis showed that the affected individuals express only 50% of the normal ADA2 mRNA and subsequent cDNA sequencing confirmed that only the allele carrying the pathogenic c.1358A>G, p.Y453C variant is expressed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "Conclusion: The identification of two novel cryptic mutations in ADA2 that were not detected by Sanger sequencing, suggests the incorporation of additional methods in the diagnosis of DADA2.

Introduction: The deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 (DADA2) has recently been defined as a monogenetic autosomal recessive autoinflammatory disease. It mainly characterized by high fever, livedoid racemosa, early onset stroke, and mild immunodeficiency, clinically polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) like symptoms.

This variation were searched in the parents and siblings as well as the symptomatic cousins, by Sanger sequencing. Five homozygos and four heterozygos variations in CECR1 were detected. Results: Fever, skin manifestations and neurological system involvement was observed in the index case and three of which were homozygos mutations but in the one, none of these was observed. A mild to severe involvement of neurological system and skin manifestations was seen more severe in homozygous mutant patients with early onset disease even resulted with necrosis. Gastrointestinal system involvement was only observed in index case and the late-onset patient with homozygous mutation. Arthritis was detected in three of patients with homozygous mutations. The age of onset of the disease is quite different from each other, even in individuals with the same mutation. In the light of these results, we suggest that early age of onset in the disease is associated with serious clinical findings and poor outcome Conclusion: With this report, we aimed to further delineate the phenotype and demonstrate variability both in the clinical findings and in the age of onset in five patients with the same mutation from the same family. As we know, there are any family cases presented with DADA2 almost in all members have been reported yet. Introduction: First case of monogenic autoinflammatory disease (CINCA/NOMID) was diagnosed in Ukraine in 2001. Since, the number of patients with autoinflammatory diseases (AIDs) was slowly growing up. More than 90% of patients were diagnosed and were under surveillance in two centers: Kyiv city pediatric center of clinical immunology and Western Ukrainian Specialized Pediatric Medical Centre. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to describe current situation with AIDs in Ukraine and its problems, and advances. Methods: We reviewed the charts of patients with autoinflammatory diseases from 2 centers where they were followed up. Among them, 7 patients with monogenic AIDs (genetically confirmed), 5 with strong clinical and laboratory phenotype of AIDs and 90 patients with PFAPA-syndrome. Results: We analyzed known patients with AIDs in Ukraine. Spectrum of patients is presented it the Tab. 1. Delay with diagnosis of monogenic AIDs was 2 to 9 years, and 1,5 years for PFAPA patients. The most common burdens on the way to diagnosis were: very low awareness of physicians about AIDs, absence of accessible biologic treatment and absence of genetic tests.Actually, all patient's genetic tests were done in foreign laboratories. In 2018 pediatric immunology community, initiated introduction of IL-1 driven diseases with anakinra with government support. Conclusion: Awareness about autoinflammatory disorders is still poor in Ukraine.Access to treatment with anakinra in Ukraine opened new opportunities to moving forward in the field of autoinflammatory diseases.

Methods: A review of case records of patients with AIDs attending the Pediatric Immune Deficiency in the last 7 years. Results: A total of 35 children with AIDs were identified and their profile is summarized in the Table. Among the periodic fevers group, Periodic Fever, Aphthous Stomatitis, Pharyngitis and Adenitis (PFAPA) was diagnosed in 8 patients. Three patients had Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS) while 2patients hadTumor Necrosis Factor Associated Periodic Fever syndrome (TRAPS). A child novel PSTPIP 1 gene mutation with Pyogenic Arthritis, Pyoderma gangrenosum, and Acne (PAPA) was diagnosed. Ten children werefound to have chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis. The first ever Indian child with Deficiency of IL-1 Receptor Antagonist (DIRA) had presented with lytic bone lesions in early infancy and has been reported. Another infant suspected to have DIRA responded to glucocorticoid therapy with radiological improvement, however, molecular confirmation is awaited.Eight children had Blau syndrome withNOD 2 gene mutations. There were considerable delays in diagnosis and difficulties in treatment due to nonavailability of anti-IL-1 blocking drugs(Anakinra or Canakinumab) in India. Two children with NOMID/CAPS died due to renal amyloidosis. Conclusion: Delay in diagnosis and lack of availability of drugs for treatment of AIDs are difficulties in managing patients in India.

It was learned from the history that the right ankle swelled and hiperemic macular rash were determined on lateral malleol area three years ago and the acute phase reactants were elevated at that time.There was no consanguinity and family history of autoinflammatory diseases. Physical examination of the patient revealed swelling, redness, thenderness, heat increase of on the calf muscles and limitation of extension of the knee joint. White blood cells, C-reactive protein (CRP), and eritrocyte sedimantation rate (ESR) were eleveated, muscle enzymes were normal levels.In the USG, the right popliteal fossa fat tissue was prominent and inflamed, and the neural structures were thick and edematous.Magnetic Resonance imaging of the thighs and right leg posterolateral muscles was consistent with myositis. After NSAID treatment, the clinic improved. However, the high CRP and ESR persisted for six mounths. There was no mutation on TRAPS gene.

Introduction: Mevalonic aciduria (MA) is the most severe phenotype of mevalonate-kinase deficiency (MKD), with a onset in early infancy and poor prognosis. MA diagnosis may be challenging in the neonatal period given its rarity and its unspecific symptoms that frequently recall those of other neonatal diseases.

Infectious work-up was negative for both viral and bacterial infections. Chest x-ray revealed bilateral perihilar peribronchial thickening. Electroencephalography (EEG) reported moderate diffuse anomalies of background activity without major abnormalities. On DOL 20 the first episode of fever was recorded. Due to worsening tachypnea and persistent abnormal chest x-ray, a pulmonary CT scan was performed and showed diffuse ground-glass bilateral infiltrates consistent with alveolar-interstitial lung disease. On DOL 22 a palpable maculo-papular skin rash appeared on feet and hands, vanishing spontaneously 24 hours later. Bone marrow examination and levels of perforins, neuron-specific enolase and urinary catabolites of catecholamines were normal. A total body MRI was normal except for a mild cerebellar hypoplasia and the known interstitial lung disease. The patient kept presenting hypotonia, relapsing episodes of fever and skin rashes, developed anemia requiring blood transfusions and failure to thrive became evident. Type-I IFN signature was negative. A genetic test was requested, as well as quantification of urinary levels of mevalonic acid, which were markedly above the normal range. Direct Sanger sequencing allowed to detect a homozygous c.709A>T missense mutation in the exon 8 of the MVK gene, coding for a protein substitution p.T237S already classified as pathogenic in the INFEVERS database (http://fmf.igh.cnrs.fr/ISSAID/infevers/) and therefore consistent with the diagnosis of MKD. Both parents and her sister were found to be heterozygous carriers of the same mutation. On DOL 38 treatment with anakinra was started, with prompt regression of fever and skin rash, decrease in inflammatory markers, increase in reticulocytes count and weight gain. Hypotonia improved but persisted. The patient was discharged from hospital on DOL 56 in good clinical conditions, with acute phase reactants within the normal range and mild hypotonia. She is now 4 months old, still on anakinra treatment without adverse events. Conclusion: Autoinflammatory diseases in the neonatal period are a diagnostic challenge. Clinical suspicion is crucial in order to perform specific laboratory and genetic testing and start appropriate treatment. Interstitial lung involvement may be present in MKD and, together with increased inflammatory markers, could be the first manifestation of the disease. . Among all 63.1% patients were well responded to colchicine and 8.8% were non-responders. Median ADDI score was 1 (min 0-max 11).

So far, we have revised six sub-branches of the HPO to include a more accurate representation of autoinflammation-associated phenotypes, such as \"increased inflammatory response\", \"abnormality of temperature\" and \"tissue ischemia\". Moreover, we have successfully re-annotated 13 diseases entities with updated HPO terms. Conclusion: Accurate metadata are increasingly needed to describe clinical information not only in a genetic manner, but also phenotypically. With the continued systematic re-evaluation of HPO for SAID, we expect to (i) standardize patient characterization so that clinicians/researchers can characterize patients in a languageindependent manner; (ii) allow for efficient data exchange between clinicians, laboratories and centers; (iii) facilitate matching phenotypically-similar patients to enable gene discovery. Methods: In a prior study, 1 we highlighted that in contrast to wild type Pyrin that requires microtubules to activate the inflammasome signaling pathway, inflammasome signaling by FMF-associated Pyrin variants is independent of microtubules. We used this differential microtubule requirement as a functional assay for diagnosing and stratifying FMF patients. Results: Overall, our data nicely corroborate the recent consensus pathogenicity classification, though also provide potential new insights for specific variants. The assay is highly specific since related disorders (pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne (PAPA) and mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD)) involving Pyrin inflammasome signaling are reliably segregated from FMF. The assay can be performed using purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as well as a small volume of whole blood, providing a robust and versatile tool that paves the way for further research deciphering the molecular pathophysiological mechanisms underlying FMF, and, most importantly, diagnosis of FMF in the clinic.

Introduction: Autoinflammatory diseases include monogenic periodic fever syndromes and genetically complex diseases. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a prototypic monogenic periodic fever syndrome. Yao syndrome (YAOS, OMIM 617321), formerly termed NOD2-asssociated autoinflammatory disease, is considered to be polygenic disease. YAOS is characterized by periodic fever, dermatitis, arthritis, and swelling of the distal extremities, as well as gastrointestinal and sicca-like symptoms and linked to certain NOD2 variants. These diseases share the overlapping clinical phenotypes, which may cause diagnostic dilemma in the absence of genetic testing.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion:"}, {"text": "Objectives: To illustrate the similarities and differences between YAOS and FMF.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion:"}, {"text": "Methods: A case is exemplified coupled with the literature review.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion:"}, {"text": "Results: A 66-year-old Caucasian female presented with recurrent episodes of high fever, abdominal pain, rash and arthralgia for three years. Typically, the patient experienced flu-like symptoms followed by fever of 101 to 103 0 F with chills lasting up to 36 hours. Abdominal pain was generalized with non-bloody diarrhea often lasting for four days and occasionally several months. She reported a nonitchy patchy erythema on her face and chest, lasting up to two weeks with each episode ( Figure  1 ). She also had pain and swelling in her knees and ankles, diffuse myalgia/stiffness, and mouth burning sensation. Her febrile episodes led to hospitalizations three times. The disease flares were initially concerned for FMF in the absence of MEFV mutations and decreased with colchicine 0.6mg twice daily, which was eventually discontinued because of lack of efficacy and side effects. Complete blood counts, complete metabolic panel, and urinalysis were essentially normal except occasional leukocytosis, thrombocytosis and eosinophilia. C-reactive protein was 12.7(<5 pg/ml), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and serum amyloid A were normal. Extensive serologic markers were negative for systemic autoimmune diseases. Testing for food allergy, serum IgE and tryptase level was normal. Other immunoglobulins were normal except IgA 31(81-463 mg/dl). A thorough workup for infectious etiology was negative.Gastrointestinal workup, including DQ2/DQ8 testing for celiac disease, computed tomography and endoscopy, was essentially normal without inflammatory bowel disease. Cytokine levels in plasma were normal for IL-1, IL-6, TNF\u03b1 and IL-5. She also had fibromyalgia and rhinitis/ asthma. Maternal and paternal families both originated from Czechoslovakia, and there was no known history of periodic fever syndromes. She was allergic to a sulfa antibiotic. Physical examination was positive for multiple tender spots. Next generation sequencing for periodic fever syndrome 6-gene panel (MEFV, NLRP3, TNFRSF1A, MVK, NLRP12 and NOD2) was only positive for heterozygous NOD2 IVS8 +158 and R702W. In this well-studied case, the clinical phenotype and genotype NOD2 IVS8 +158 /R702W are consistent with YAOS. The diagnostic criteria for YAOS include the characteristic phenotype, specific NOD2 variants, and rigorous exclusion of overlapping disease entities. One of the major differential diagnoses is FMF since YAOS and FMF share some clinical phenotypes; however, they are distinct in clinical manifestations otherwise and genotypes (Table1). Conclusion: Given the shared phenotypes and that the current diagnostic criteria for FMF remain clinical, molecular genetic testing to cover both MEFV and NOD2 may be imperative for distinguishing these two diseases. It may be particularly true for those patients who present with atypical phenotype for FMF and/or poor response to colchicine.

Introduction: Procaspase-1 (CASP1) variants trigger febrile episodes and systemic sterile inflammation in a subset of patients with autoinflammatory diseases despite altered enzymatic activity of procaspase-1 and reduced IL-1\u03b2 release. These on the first view contradictory observations of reduced IL-1\u03b2 expression and systemic inflammation could at least partially be explained by increased NF-\u03baB activation through prolonged interaction of CASP1 variants with receptor interacting protein kinase 2 (RIP2).

Proliferation and phagocytosis was assessed by using the IncuCyte\u00ae livecell analysis system in combination with pH sensitive probes (e.g. pHrodo E. coli microparticle). Real time deformability cytometry (RT-DC) was assessed to define cell mechanical properties of monocytes/ macrophages, which could be altered by CASP1 variants and then contribute to disease pathogenesis (by influencing cell migration).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods:"}, {"text": "Results: Macrophages with CASP1 variants strongly influenced formation of cytosolic macromolecular complexes (pyroptosomes/specks).

The p.L265S variant additionally showed disturbed nuclear localization. Proliferation and phagocytosis of monocytes/macrophages was not significantly influenced by CASP1 variants, but RT-DC revealed monocytic shape changes and deformation by CASP1 variants compared to procaspase-1 wildtype. Conclusion: These findings reveal abnormal pyroptosome formation, impaired nuclear localization and changes in monocyte cell shape and deformation as further mechanisms, how CASP1 variants could trigger increased inflammation despite reduced IL-1\u03b2 release. Further investigations are needed to confirm these data in vivo. Patient PBMCs demonstrated normal NF-kB activation. Upon stimulation, phosphorylated IkB\u03b1 increased, but comparably to control levels, and was unaffected by MDP. Cytokine analyses are pending.Activation of lectin pathway was 0%, and plasma MBL <100\u03bcg/L. Initially, CNO was suspected and bisphosphonate treatment was initiated. Recurrent fever episodes of 4-8 weeks duration questioned the diagnosis. Nevertheless, adalimumab was initiated 40 mg e.o. week, but due to poor response, substituted with anakinra 2 mg/kg/day after half a year. On this treatment she suffered a new and long attack of daily fever for 8 consecutive weeks with abdominal pain and markedly raised ESR and CRP levels. PET-CT and new MRI remained unremarkable. During fever episodes she continued to develop minor skin and mucosal infections with herpes simplex virus and staphylococci, but despite relevant antibiotic treatment fever episodes continued. Renewed literature review on NOD2 variants raised the suspicion of the recently described NAID, also known as Yao Syndrome. It is characterized by recurrent fever episodes, weight loss, fatigue, polyarthralgia/polyarthritis, and often increased acute phase laboratory findings. Genetically, one or more variants in the NOD2 gene are typically found. Conclusion: We believe our patient has NAID due to the presence of two NOD2 variants IVS8 +158 and 1007fs commonly associated with this condition. We speculate that a defective NOD2 dependent phagocytosis leads to bacterial persistence and secondary inflammatory changes. Additionally, the variants in NLRP1 and C9 might contribute to her overall hyperinflammation and infectious susceptibility. Pending cytokine analyses might further clarify whether these immune responses act through inflammasome-dependent or -independent cellular pathways. Results: We have found differences in the proinflammatory biomarkers between CNO, JIA, and HC. Patients with NBO had higher levels of 14-3-3-protein, calprotectin and interleukin-6 compare to HC, but lower levels of 14-3-3 protein and interleukine-6 then in JIA patients (table 1) . We have found positive correlation between 14-3-3-protein and ESR (r=0.41, p=0.04 for whole group and r=0.52' p=0.047 for NBO), and negative correlation with multifocal involvement (r=-0.45, p=0.016) and hemoglobin (r=-.072, p=0.028).

However, although decreased calreticulin level was observed in BD patients compared to healthy controls by 2D-DIGE analysis, we detected increased calreticulin level in BD patients by western blot analysis. Conclusion: We identified proteins related to glycolysis, coagulation, ER stress, and cytoskeleton by 2D-DIGE analysis. Although none of these proteins have been previously implicated in BD, lower levels of stathmin, WDR1, and calreticulin having roles in inflammation was revealed in BD patients. Also increased PGK1 level was observed in BD patients, which is a glycolytic enzyme and previously suggested to have a role in rheumatoid arthritis. The expression of proteins involved in ER protein processing (calreticulin, HSPA8, GRP78-BiP) were down-regulated in BD patients compared to healthy controls, which hints the involvement of ER stress in BD and will be investigated in more detail.

Methods: The follow up data of 11 AOSD patients (8 female, 3 male), who were followed up in outpatient clinics of 3 tertiary centers were reviewed retrospectively. The initial characteristics and follow up findings were reported. Results: The mean timespan between the initial diagnosis and Canakinumab treatment 43.2 \u00b1 28 months (mean \u00b1 SD). Before the onset of Canakinumab therapy, all patients were exposed to methotrexate, 1 to leflunomide, 9 to Tocilizumab and 8 to Anakinra. As for the biologic agents, 3 patients were also treated beforehand with Infliximab, 2 with Adalimumab, 3 with Etanercept and 2 with Rituximab. Canakinumab therapy was initiated in all patients with the indication of refractory disease under other medications, except for the one in whom neutropenia became evident under anakinra. The mean number of Canakinumab injections was 11,8 \u00b1 6. The mean follow-up period of patients treated with Canakinumab was 42.2 \u00b1 31 months. Five of 8 patients are still being treated with Canakinumab of 150 mg/month, one of 300 mg/month and two of 150 mg/every 2 months. One patient had a single injection and was fully controlled. The mean ferritin measure of 9 patients was reduced from 1292.3 \u00b1 1530 ng/ml to 218.1 \u00b1 327.1 ng/ml following the Canakinumab therapy (p=0.056).

The indication of therapy termination in the remaining 1 patient was the diagnosis of tuberculosis at 9th month of the treatment despite isoniazid prophylaxis. The patient was also treated with multiple biological agents beforehand, therefore it is not easy to conclude that treatment with Canakinumab induces tuberculosis flares. Conclusion: Canakinumab treatment seems to be effective in refractory AOSD patients who were previously treated with various agents. We state that an IL-1 blocking agent, Canakinumab is a relatively safe and effective alternative in managing refractory AOSD cases. On the other hand, randomized controlled trials are needed to further investigate the role of Canakinumab in these cases as well as its use as the first choice of biologic agents.

Efforts have been paid to prevent AA amyloidosis or to control an already formed amyloidosis in order to prevent organ function loss, particularly renal insufficiency. There are emerging therapies in FMF related amyloidosis. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the role of anti-IL-1 regimens, anakinra and canakinumab regarding their efficacy and safety in FMF related amyloidosis. Methods: In this single center study, 44 patients diagnosed with FMF and had a histologically proven diagnosis of amyloidosis, were exposed to Anakinra or canakinumab. Patients who received anti IL-1 therapy for at least 3 months were evaluated for treatment response. All of the patients recruited in this study received colchicine and are either resistant or intolerant. Patients were questioned with regards to FMF related characteristics and comorbidities. MEFV gene status, laboratory measures, side events and therapy outcomes were tested and followed. Results: Four patients were excluded because they received treatment less than 3 months. Among remaining 40 patients, anakinra was switched to canakinumab due to allergic reactions or insufficient response in 15 patients. There are 16 patients still on anakinra and 10 with canakinumab after a mean of 25.92\u00b111.31 months. The patients were divided into two subgroups with regards to their initial creatinine levels: Group 1 creatinine levels below 1.5 mg/dL and Group 2 above 1.5 mg/dL. The analysis of clinical outcome is summarized in Table 1 . The decrease in proteinuria is more modest (p=0.01) in Group 1 in comparison with Group 2 (p<0.01). The decrease in the mean patient global assessment scores was significant for both groups. It decreased from 6.82 to 1.2 in Group 1 and from 6 to 2.5 in Group 2. At the time of this review 8 patients were still on hemodialysis. Three patients had renal transplantation. The only side effect observed was injection-site reaction in patients receiving anakinra (n=3). Patients on canakinumab developed pneumonia, flare of psoriasis, and lichen planus one each.

Long-term treatment of the disease is based on daily intake of colchicine, which has proven its effectiveness in the occurrence of acute attacks and AA amyloidosis. In cases of poor tolerance, ineffectiveness or contraindication, anti-interleukin-1 (IL-1) biotherapies have been effectively tested. Objectives: To report on the experience of using IL-1 biotherapies in real life among FMF patients followed in the French National Reference Centre (NRC). Methods: All French adult FMF records were reviewed; for those receiving or having received IL1 biotherapy, the all medical file was available. Results: Among the 603 FMF patients, 3.5% (n=21) were included (12 women/9 men); 81% displayed M694V homozygous MEFV mutation and 13 had AA amyloidosis. Anti-IL1 biotherapy used were: anakinra (n=20) and canakinumab (n=2)0. Colchicine was maintained in 18 patients at a median dose of 1 mg/d. The prescription of IL1 biotherapy was justified by: 1/ AA amyloidosis responsible for renal failure that did not allow the colchicine dose to be increased: n=13 (2.2% of the overall FMF population); 2/ Insufficient control with colchicine: n=4 (0.7%) 3/ Coexistence of an inflammatory or neoplastic disease participating in the poor control of FMF: n=4 (0.7%); 3/ In one patient, renal failure on AA amyloidosis and colchicine resistance coexisted. In all our patients, the use of anti-IL1 has allowed clinical and biological control of their disease. There was no evidence of poor tolerance of anti-IL1 except for reactions at injection sites for anakinra and weight gain. Conclusion: In our clinical experience, the first cause of prescription of anti-IL1 biotherapy is the existence of AA amyloidosis with renal failure, which corresponds to more than half of the indications and 2.2% of FMF patients followed on our CNR. Colchicine resistance is lower than expected, 1% of our patients, compared to 5 and 10% that were recently published. This can be explained by potential \"false resistances\" to be eliminated as a priority: either poor compliance or insufficient dosage. Finally, in the case of true resistance to colchicine, our patients displayed another inflammatory disease associated to FMF. In conclusion, situations constituting an indication for IL1 biotherapies in FMF are rare (3.5% of patients) and their prescription requires great vigilance on the part of the clinician, which is why they should always be the subject of a collegial discussion, after having eliminated all organic causes of FMF deregulation. Introduction: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) consists in accumulation of pulmonary surfactants in the alveolar space. It is supposed to be caused by reduced number and/or impaired function of alveolar macrophages, with resultant reduced clearance of surfactant. It could be an autoimmune, a congenital or a secondary disease associated to a very large spectrum of pathologies and has recently been described as an extremely rare but potentially fatal complication of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA). We describe a case of a very severe and persistent systemic inflammation complicated by PAP who had a dramatic recovery and also an improvement of lung injury, under anti IL6-treatment with Tocilizumab. Results: Case report: A 14-year-old boy has been affected by a very severe systemic inflammation (flares of fever, generalized lymphnodes enlargement, rash, fugacious small joints arthritis, increase of blood acute phase reactants), with features consistent with sJIA, since the age of 11. Once malignancies were ruled out (bone marrow examination; lymph-node biopsy; total body PET), systemic steroid was started (prednisone 1mg/kg/die) with only a transient benefit, as he relapsed during the progressive tapering. Among the tried treatments used in association with steroids (Cyclosporine; Micophenolate Mofetil; Anakinra), only high-dose Canakinumab (300 mg/4 weeks) lead to a complete disease control. In the following months steroid tapering was performed with disease flares at low steroids doses. Due to parental decision, Canakinumab was discontinued and alternative medicine was followed for at least nine months. During this period the patient presented a very severe inflammatory relapse, which was complicated by pulmonary manifestations, such as dry cough and dyspnea. Radiological images (chest-TC), functional test (DLCO with moderate impairment of predicted value, 49%; spirometry with mild restrictive alteration) and, finally, lung biopsy, lead to the diagnosis of PAP. Anti-IL6 drug (Tocilizumab, 10mg/kg), was started with dramatic response both on systemic inflammation and on pulmonary impairment (cough resolution, no dyspnea, DLCO with mild impairment of predicted value, 70%). Maintenance therapy with Tocilizumab led to long-term clinical stability. Conclusion: Secondary PAP could be a severe complication of persistent and uncontrolled systemic inflammation and may respond to treatment of the underlying disease. Both IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors are effective in systemic inflammation diseases such as sJIA; though, Introduction: Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a very rare condition. It is the most catastrophic form of heterotopic ossification, caused by ongoing intra-cellular signaling through the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) pathway, which results in chondrocyte formation and complete ossification of soft tissues. The ACVR1/ALK2 gene produces the Activin 1 receptor, which serves as the heterodimer of the BMP type I receptor. The typical R206H activating mutation occurs within the highly conserved glycine-serine region of the cytoplasmic domain, adjacent to a protein kinase domain. Painful, soft tissue swellings usually appear by the age of 3-4 years, but the typical, bilateral deformity of the large toes can be noted at birth. Average life expectancy is 45 years. Morbidity and mortality are commonly related to ankylosis of the temporomandibular joints and thoracic insufficiency syndrome. Currently, no treatment has proven effective. Some use antileukotrienes, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and other agents, as prophylaxis. When swelling appears, corticosteroids, along with bisphosphonates, are usually used. Anti-TNFa agents were reported unsuccessful. The recurrent paroxysmal appearance of local tender swellings, with erythematous skin, which partially react to anti-inflammatory agents, accompanied by elevated inflammatory markers during flares, suggest that FOP might be an auto-inflammatory disease. We hypothesized that treatment with anti-interleukin-1 (IL-1) agents helps ameliorating progression of this devastating disease, and report our experience.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Objectives: To try lowering the rate of FOP paroxysms, and/or limit symptoms and residual lesions, with anti-IL-1 agents in one patient with FOP.

Treatment with high-dose corticosteroids, pamidronate infusions, and daily celecoxib and monteleukast did not affect the course of the disease, and new swellings, lasting 5-7 days, continued to appear, at an approximate rate of one new swelling every 8 days. Anakinra treatment was commenced (100mg/day, as the patient weighed more than 100 kg). After marked improvement was noted during a 2-month period, with no side effects, he was switched to monthly canakinumab (300mg/ dose) for 5 months. Markedly lower rate of flare-ups was documented (a new swelling every 22-25 days), with shorter duration (2-3 days) . The swellings were smaller and easier to control, with shorter courses of methylprednisolone during flares. Treatment was withdrawn, but renewed after 6.5 weeks, due to appearance of a large swelling below his left scapula. High plasma levels of IL-1b were found during this flare (18.17-21.52pg/ml). In contrast, the 3 previous blood samples, obtained during treatment with anakinra or canakinumab, showed undetectable IL-1b levels (<0.125pg/ml), (Figure) . Introduction: The development of more potent therapeutic approaches of KD is an urgent need because intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment is not effective in 20% of patients, increasing the risk of coronary dilatations/ aneurysms. The combination of genetic and transcriptomic data revealed the key role of interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling in KD vasculitis and mouse model of KD has shown that anakinra (IL1RA: IL-1R1receptor antagonist) could prevent the development of vascular aneurysms. Objectives: To assess as primary objective, the efficacy of anakinra in patients with KD who fail to respond to at least one infusion of 2g/ kg of IVIg To assess as secondary objectives, its safety and tolerability and its effect on disease activity, systemic inflammation and coronary lesions. Methods: A 45-day, phase IIa proof of concept study open labeled with anakinra dose escalation, with a target of at least 12 patients completing the study Eligible patients had KD according to the AHA criteria, duration of fever \u2264 14 days, and were \u2265 3 months and 5 Kg. They had persistent (or relapsing) fever (\u226538\u00b0C) within 48h of the last IVIG infusion, had not received other alternative treatment including steroids, and had no others exclusion criteria. After informed consent, they received a starting dose of 2mg/kg (patients <10kg and/or <8 months: 4mg/kg) of anakinra, which could be increased every 24h of 2mg/kg until a maximum of 6mg/kg (patients <10kg and/or <8 months: 8mg/kg), in case of persistent fever. Anakinra treatment duration was 15 days. Outcome measures were fever, KD symptoms, blood inflammation and cardiac echography. Total study duration was 45 days. Clinical trials: NCT02390596. The study is supported by a grant from the French ministry of health, APHP, national PHRC 2014. IRB approval was obtained and all patients (parents) gave informed consent. Results: 18 patients were screened and 16 were included and 13 have completed the study. Anakinra was started in 16 patients (14 boys, 2 girls) at a median age 2 years (3 months to 6 years) and at a median of 9.5 days after the onset of fever. 4 patients escaped early for SAE, and 1 had sJIA final diagnosis. The maximum dose of anakinra was 6mg/kg in 6 patients, 4mg/kg in 6, and 2mg/kg in 4. Mean PGA decreased from 7.80 (4-10) to 1.2 (0-3) at D14. Median temperature was 37.6\u00b0C (36.7-39.7) at day 3 and 37.2\u00b0C at D7 (36.7-37.9)). Median CRP was 135mg/L at screening and decreased to 9.5 mg/L at D7. 8/14 evaluated patients had coronary dilatation (Z score max \u22652.5mm) at inclusion, 5/14 at D14 and 3/14 at D45. 3/14 patients who increased Z score at D14 decreased it at J45. We observed 3 severe adverse events (SAE) where treatment was discontinued: anakinra overdose, MAS in a patient evolving to sJIA and increase of coronary dilatation. Others AE included cytolytic hepatitis (2 patients), hypereosinophilia (1), injection site reaction (1) and pancreatitis (1) without treatment discontinuation. Conclusion: We have realized the first experimental trial assessing IL-1 blockade in severe refractory KD. 15 day-duration of anakinra treatment, given early in the course of IVIG-resistant KD, was rapidly effective on KD symptoms, biologic inflammation and coronary dilatations in almost all patients, with a good tolerability. This study calls for further investigation of IL1 blockade in KD. Introduction: Schnitzler's syndrome (SchS) is a prototype adult-onset autoinflammatory disease characterized by urticarial exanthema and monoclonal gammopathy combined with systemic inflammatory symptoms. We have previously reported the efficacy of canakinumab treatment in a 4-month randomized placebo-controlled multi-center study involving 20 patients with SchS. Methods: All patients who successfully completed the initial 4-month trial were eligible to enter an open-label study extension for a maximum period of 4 years. Patients received canakinumab 150 mg or 300 mg injections as needed based on individual disease activity and response to treatment within the first 4 months. Efficacy was monitored by changes in disease activity (physician global assessment [PGA; range 0-20]), inflammation markers (C-reactive protein [CRP], serum amyloid A [SAA]) and quality of life (DLQI, SF-36). Safety assessment included adverse event reporting and routine clinical and laboratory assessments. Results: A total number of 17 patients entered the open-label extension of the study. Of these, 15 patients completed the whole study period of 4 years. During this study, continuous effectiveness of canakinumab treatment was demonstrated by significantly lower PGA scores as compared to baseline scores throughout the study. The clinical response was mirrored by normalized inflammation markers CRP and SAA in most patients and stabilized quality of life as determined by DLQI and SF-36. Relapse of symptoms was rare and occurred after canakinumab interruption or infections. During the open-label extension of the study, seven serious adverse events (SAEs) were noted. These included infections such as pneu-monia and sepsis in two elderly patients, one of them with fatal outcome. Also, one patient developed plasmocytoma and left the study. Conclusion: In this long-term open-label study, canakinumab treatment provided continuous symptom control in most patients.

It can be idiopathic or it can occur after a pericardial procedure (post-pericardiotomic). First line treatment consists of a combination of high-doses of NSAIDs with colchicine; corticosteroids represent the second line in resistant or intolerant cases. Different biologics and immunosoppressant have been used as third line treatment, with variable responses: by now the most promising results have been obtained with anakinra, enlightening the possible role of IL-1 in the pathogenesis of this condition. Objectives: To describe the clinical course and the outcome of desensitization procedure to anakinra in a patient with steroiddependent pericarditis, who withdrawn anakinra for adverse reactions and did not respond to IL-1\u03b2 blockade with canakinumab. Methods: A 9-years old girl started to complain with recurrent pericarditis at the age of 6 years old, after surgical correction of an atrial septal defect. NSAIDs were not effective and colchicine was withdrawn for intolerance; oral steroids were started with good response, then gradually tapered, with prompt relapse after the steroid discontinuation, requiring pericardiocentesis. The child showed a steroid-dependent course of the disease, with several relapses after tapering attempts. In March 2016, after 5 relapses, anakinra (2 mg/ kg/day) was started with a fast and complete clinical response; however, it was discontinued after 2 weeks for the appearance of severe local side effects. She was firstly evaluated in our Center in April 2016; in July 2016 therapy with canakinumab 150 mg (4 mg/kg) every 4 weeks was started. She experienced four relapses during this treatment (July 2016 -December 2017), following every attempt to reduce steroidal dosage, despite the modification of the schedule (4 mg/kg every three weeks) and the reintroduction of colchicine. Due to inadequate response, canakinumab was withdrawn and, in light of the effectiveness previously demonstrated by anakinra, it was decided, after an allergologic consultation, to attempt to reintroduce this therapy, performing a process of desensitization as reported by Mendonca et al (J clin immunology, 2017) . Results: In January 2018 desensitization to anakinra was started. The patient received five to three consecutive injections per day of gradually increasing anakinra doses and dilutions from days 1 to 9. Each injection was spaced by 15 minutes intervals, raising the dose at each step. On Day 2, due to the appearance of skin reactions at injection site, it was decided to enlarge the interval between the injections (30 minutes) and increase the dilution, restarting desensitization protocol. The full target dosage (80 mg/day; 2mg/kg/ day) at standard dilution (divided in 4 different administrations) was reached on Day 8. Since Day 11 anakinra was administrated twice a day, once a day after one month. Antihistaminic and steroids were administrated during all the desensitization process, then discontinued, without recurrence of both skin reactions and disease manifestations. In June 2018 low-dose colchicine was progressively tapered and finally discontinued. Conclusion: Desensitization process to anakinra allowed to achieve full control of the disease in a patient with severe refractory recurrent pericarditis, not responding neither to first line treatment nor to IL-1\u03b2 blockade and becoming steroids-dependant. Even further data are required, the divergent response to the two antagonists of IL-1 could suggest a prominent role of IL-1\u03b1 in the pathogenesis of this disease.

Introduction: Although there is growing evidence on the efficacy of anakinra in the treatment of recurrent pericarditis, its use in pediatric patients is still very limited. Objectives: Our aim is to review the experience of our center in the use of this therapeutic option in children with recurrent pericarditis who did not respond to classical therapy. Methods: Descriptive study of a series of cases by collecting data through the clinical history. Results: 7 patients were included (6 girls, 1 boy). All of them presented recurrent symptomatic pericarditis with poor outcome despite several treatments (ibuprofene, colchicine, steroids). All had a quick response to treatment with complete resolution of systemic and cardiologic symptoms, associated to normalization of laboratory parameters thus allowing steroids withdrawal. Two out of the three patients in whom anakinra was eventually discontinued required reintroduction due to recurrences. One remains asymptomatic after two years without treatment. Six patients are still on anakinra (variable dosage), with absence of flares and with no significant side effects. Conclusion: Anakinra is very useful for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis in pediatric patients. The good response observed through this sample supports the autoinflammatory etiopathogenesis of some cases of recurrent pericarditis. The duration of treatment needs to be prolonged, and its withdrawal may involve flares that quickly respond to ANK reintroduction. assessment were performed to further characterize the phenotype and pathophysiology of the disorder.Symptomatic treatment with the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra at a starting daily dose of 100mg subcutaneously was attempted in six patients.

Introduction: TRNT1 is a nuclear gene encoding a ubiquitous enzyme (CCA-adding tRNA nucleotidyl transferase enzyme) necessary for aminoacylation of both mitochondrial and cytosolic tRNA. TRNT1 mutations are associated to heterogeneous phenotypes and systemic involvement of variable severity and progression. Objectives: To characterise clinical features, laboratory assessment and treatment strategies of two patients affected by an autoinflammatory syndrome caused by TRNT1 mutations. Methods: The patient 1 (P1) is a twenty years old female. From the first month of life she experienced recurrent fever associated to painful cutaneous lesions, edema of the hands, raised inflammatory markers and anemia. The symptoms were moderately controlled by corticosteroid therapy. One of these episodes was characterized by severe anemia (Hb 6.6 g/dl), requiring blood transfusion. At the age of 8 months she was found to have mild hypogammaglobulinemia, but no other alterations were found on immunological investigations. She showed normalization of the immunoglobulin levels at the age of 22 months. The physical examination found facial dysmorphisms, brittle hair, developmental delay and microcephaly. Splenomegaly was reported by abdomen ultrasound. Isolated Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) was diagnosticated at the age of 3 years and it was treated with recombinant human GH (rhGH) for the next 4 years, without improvement. At the age of 8 years she was diagnosed with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.At the age of 10 she was diagnosticated with posterior subcapsular cataract, probably related to chronic steroid treatment. The patient 2 (P2) is a ten years old female. From four months of age she suffered from recurrent fever, associated from the age of 11 months to painful cutaneous lesions. Laboratory assessment showed elevated serum inflammatory markers, mild anaemia, hypogammaglobulinemia and reduced levels of B-cells. Growing up, she showed failure to thrive, developmental delay, facial dysmorphisms, brittle, microcephaly, hepatosplenomegaly and swelling of the right ankle. At the age of two she was diagnosticated with sensorineural hearing loss and bilateral cataract. At the age of 5 she started therapy with rhGH for GHD. Results: Suspecting Chronic Infantile Neurologic Cutaneous and Articular (CINCA) syndrome, even though negativity of molecular analysis of CIAS1, they started treatment with anti-IL1 (Anakinra) at the age of 9 (P1) and 2 (P2). Due to the partial response, P1 shifted to anti-TNFa therapy (Etanercept) at the age of 11 with significant improvement. P2 showed nonresponse to Anakinra so she shifted to Etanercept after four months. Whole exome sequencing was performed resulting in two mutation of TNRT1: P1 c.608G>A (p.Arg203Lys), c.1246A>G (p.Lys416Glu); P2 c.938delT (p.Leu313fs), c.1246A>G (p.Lys416-Glu).During the 9 years follow-up the patients underwent sixmonth clinical and laboratory assessment, showing normalization of inflammatory index and resolution of recurrent fever and associated symptoms. Conclusion: To date, 34 patients with TRNT1 mutations related disease have been reported, presenting significant clinical heterogeneity. In this study we extend the cohort of patients and we report a new mutation (c.938delT).It was recently reported that treatment with TNF inhibitors has been efficacious in four patients, including three patients treated with Etanercept for 3 years.We report the longest follow-up in these patients treated with Etanercept, confirming efficacy and safety of that treatment. Introduction: FMF is the most common monogenic autoinflammatory disease and colchicine has been used as the drug of choice for the treatment since 1972. It is a safe drug when it is used in the suggested dosage however it is associated with certain side effects. Some case reports suggest that colchicine can cause leukopenia even with the lower doses. Objectives: In this study, we aimed to investigate the bone marrow side effects of colchicine in patients who are treated with normal routine dose (0.5-2mg/day) for FMF. Methods: 213 consecutive pediatric FMF patients between July-September 2018 who were followed at Hacettepe University Department of Pediatric Rheumatology and treated with colchicine for at least 6 months were included in this study. Clinical characteristics, demographics, and laboratory findings were reviewed retrospectively from medical charts and electronic records of the patients. In patients with leukopenia, the time interval from the treatment onset and time interval to full recovery were also recorded. Patients were diagnosed as FMF according to Yalcinkaya-Ozen criteria, and the treatment started as 0.5 mg/day <5 years, 1 mg/day 5-10 years and 1.5 mg/day >10 years old. Max colchicine dose was 2 mg/day. Patients were followed at 2 nd week of treatment for acute side effects of colchicine, at 3 months and then every 6 months. GraphPad 6.0 was used to evaluate the statistical analysis. Proportions, medians, minimum and maximum values were used where appropriate to present the descriptive analyses.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Results: 213 pediatric FMF patients were included to the study group of whom 52.3% of them were female. The mean age at the disease onset and the start of the colchicine was 5.74\u00b14.07 years. The median follow-up duration was 70 months ranged from 8 months to 16.9 years.175 (82.2%) of the patients had recurrent fever, 165 (77.5%) of them had abdominal pain, 89 (42%) of them had arthritis and 17 of them (8%) had chest pain at the time of diagnosis. Twenty-three (10.8%) out of 213 FMF patients had leukopenia during the colchicine treatment. Among these 23 patients, 1 of them had moderate lymphopenia (500-1000/mm 3 ), 2 had moderate neutropenia (500-1000/mm 3 ), 7 had mild neutropenia (1000-1500/mm 3 ) and 2 patients had both mild lymphopenia and neutropenia. The median interval between the onset of the treatment and the leukopenia onset was 63 months (range 3-179 months). At the time of leukopenia onset, median colchicine doses per weight (0.026 vs 0.027 mg/kg/day p:0.96) were comparable in patients with and without leukopenia. There were no other significant differences in terms of demographics, clinical features, mutation types and colchicine formulations. Lymphocyte count (1760.87\u00b1512.34 vs 2264.89\u00b1924.04; p<0.001) PMNL count (1673.91\u00b1574.63 vs 4172.34\u00b13074.77; p<0.001) and platelet count (249304\u00b142568 vs 282399\u00b177571; p<0.001) were also lower in this group as expected. Colchicine doses were lowered due to this adverse event. In all patients, leukopenia was transient and completely resolved in median 146.0 days. There was no increased rate of infections observed in these patients with leukopenia compared to other patients. Conclusion: Colchicine caused leukopenia in 10.8% of the patients in our cohort however only 3 patients had moderate cytopenia and none of them had severe leukopenia. All of the cases were fully reversible after dose adjustment and there were no clinical consequences.Leukocyte counts should be assessed every 6 months in patients on colchicine. Introduction: Type I interferonopathies are genetic disorders characterized by an up-regulation of type I interferon (IFN) activity. An increased expression of type I IFN regulated genes, IFN signature (IS), is described in these conditions. They are characterized by autoinflammation and varying degrees of autoimmunity or immunodeficiency. Some patients with a phenotype strongly suggestive for type I interferonopathy with a high IS, do not show any mutations in known type I interpheronopaties related genes, being classified as undefined Objectives: To evaluate the effect of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in patients with defined and undefined type I interferonopathy Methods: 7 patients with type I interferonopathy followed at a Pediatric Rheumatology center, were included. Leucocyte (WBC) and platelet count, hemoglobin (Hb), CRP, ESR, serum amyloid A (SAA), autoantibodies, complement levels and IS, were assessed before and after 5-7 months of MMF treatment (600 mg/m 2 BID). IS was determined by qPCR (high scores >1.42) Results: Patient 1 and 2 presented respectively with SAVI and Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome. The others were classified as undefined. In patient 1(table), treated with JAK1/2 inhibitor, MMF was followed by decrease of inflammatory markers and resolution of lung involvement; in patient 2 to an increase in Hb and normalization of inflammatory markers. Among patients with an undefined phenotype the addition of MMF to low dose prednisone led to complete resolution of inflammation. A reduction of the antinuclear antibodies titre was observed in patients 2, 3 and 7 and a normalization of complement level in patients 3, 4 and 7. Patient 5 had normal inflammatory markers already before the beginning of MMF possibly due to previously administered immunosuppressive treatment. Despite all patients presented a significant improvement of clinical picture after 5 months of MMF treatment, the IS decreased only in 4/7 patients while it remain stable or increased in the others Conclusion: Our data suggest that mycophenolate mofetil might be an effective therapy in patients with type I interferonopathy leading to improvement of clinical and laboratory features thus allowing a glucocorticoid sparing Introduction: Blau syndrome is a monogenic disease resulting from mutations in the pattern recognition receptor NOD2, and is phenotypically characterized by the classical triad of granulomatous polyarthritis, dermatitis and uveitis. However, extra-triad symptoms have increasingly been reported including, but not limited to, vasculitis, granulomatous glomerular and interstitial nephritis, interstitial lung disease, arterial hypertension, pericarditis, and hepatic granulomata. 1 Therapy of Blau syndrome is challenging with following medications being reported with varying responses: steroids, methotrexate, TNFblocker, Il-1 and IL-6 targeted therapies. Objectives: To describe the case of a Blau syndrome patient refractory to conventional therapies benefiting from IL-17 targeted therapy. Results: The female patient of African origin presented at the age of six months with recurrent high fever episodes for days to weeks, polyarthritis, erythematous and ichthyosiform skin manifestations, severe panuveitis, granulomatous liver disease, kidney disease with tubulopathy and severe arterial hypertension. Laboratory evaluation revealed highly elevated inflammation parameters (C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), Serum Amyloid A (SAA)). Liver biopsy showed granulomatous liver disease. Broad infectious disease work-up including tuberculosis was negative. The family history was unremarkable regarding inflammatory or immunological diseases. The suspicion of Blau syndrome was made and genetic analyses revealed a novel de novo mutation in the NOD2 Gene (c.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 4706, "end": 4707, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "[1807C>A]; Histidin 603 > Asparagin) confirming the diagnosis Blau syndrome. The patient was consecutively treated with each high doses of steroids, IL-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra up to 10mg/kg/ d) and anti-TNF antibodies (allergic reaction to 3 rd dose of infliximab, adalimumab up to 5mg/kg weekly) in addition to maintenance doses of steroids, none of which with sustained success. Therefore a hitherto novel therapeutic approach was initiated with an anti-IL-6 therapy (tocilizumab; up to 20mg/kg every 2 weeks) which yielded a good, yet only contemporary response for up to 6 months. As significant amounts of IL-17 have been identified in granuloma biopsies of Blau syndrome patients\u00b2 we decided to start a novel therapy targeting the Il-23 / IL-17 pathway. We first used the anti-IL-12 / IL-23 antibody ustekinumab (up to 6mg/kg every 3 weeks) which led to striking clinical and laboratory response for up to 6 months but then lost effectiveness. Therefore we switched to the anti-IL-17A antibody secukinumab (up to 17mg/kg every 4 weeks) leading to substantial therapeutic response again. The patient has now been successfully treated with this therapy for 10 months together with a maintenance dose of prednisolone (0,2 mg/kg/d), electrolyte substitutions due to her tubulopathy and anti-hypertensive therapy. No substantial side effects have been observed so far. Further observation is needed for long term evaluation of the anti-IL-17 therapy response in this single patient.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Conclusion: This case report might encourage the use and report of high-dose IL-17 targeted therapies in further refractory Blau syndrome patients.

Introduction: Rubenstein-Taybi syndrome, a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by intellectual disability and dysmorphic facial features, is usually associated with mutations in the transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein. 1 Mutations in the transcriptional factor, DEAF1, have been associated with DEAF1-associated neurodevelopmental disorder (DAND), characterized by intellectual disability, speech impairment and motor delay. 2 We describe the presence of a recurrent fever syndrome in a child with Rubenstein-Taybi syndrome and another with DAND. We evaluated a child with Rubenstein-Taybi syndrome with recurrent fevers associated with grunting.During a severe flare, he had been found to have small pericardial and pleural effusions. He did not respond to colchicine and was treated frequently with prednisone. A second child was diagnosed with DAND and recurrent fevers that exacerbated his seizure disorder. Both children had increased inflammatory markers at the time of their fevers.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 667, "end": 668, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 873, "end": 874, "text": "2", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Objectives: To find a steroid-sparing treatment for these children.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Methods:Both children were treated with anakinra at the first sign of symptoms related to a fever flare.

These children have dysregulation of multiple genes, including some plausibly involved in the innate immune system. Introduction: HSCT isan accepted curative treatment for diseases caused by genetic defects of immune system. Yet, it's not as widely used in autoinflammatory syndromes since some of them affect not only hematopoietic, but also other cell types. PAMI caused by certain mutations of PSTPIP1 gene andmanifests mainly withhematologic abnormalities (that can be life-threatening) and autoinflammation with or without purulent features.PAMI treatment is challenging as IL-1 inhibitors can alleviate the inflammatory symptoms but not hematologic features.Hence HSCT seems a logical treatment optionin PAMI.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Objectives: To describe treatment results of two PAMI patients.

Gene expression testing of interferon related genes was performed before and after treatment. Tofacitinib was prescribed at a dose of 5 mg twice daily for the older girl and 2.5 mg twice daily for the younger one. Results: Gene expression testing of interferon related genes showed upregulation in both girls before treatment. The older girl was started on tofacitinib and noted a great improvement with many fewer oral ulcers even when her dose of tofacitinib was reduced to once daily. Repeat gene expression testing post-initiation of therapy showed a reduction in expression of interferon related genes. After approximately 3 months of taking tofacitinib, the younger girl's liver fibroscan (transient elastography) measurement had decreased from 13.5 Kpa, suggestive of advanced liver disease, to 8.7 Kpa (normal \u22647 Kpa).

MKD phenotype is characterized by multiorgan inflammation, which may involve the brain in the most severe cases. Anti-IL-1 therapies can contrast almost completely systemic inflammation, but it is uncertain whether they can prevent neural inflammation.

At the same time, cells were stimulated with different concentration of Lapaquistat (10/25/50 \u03bcM). After 24 hours, cells were treated with bacterial stimuli (lipopolysaccharide) to mimic a generic inflammatory stimulus. Cell viability, programmed cell death, morphology and cytokine release were the experimental readouts. Cell viability was measured by means of impedance assay: the system allows to quantify cell proliferation, changes in morphology and the quality of cell adhesion to the plastic wells. These data were confirmed by flow cytometric programmed cell death assays. Cells morphology was assessed by electronic microscopy, and in particular the evaluation was focused to discriminate the mitochondrial and membranes size and shape. Finally, after stimulation, culture supernatants were collected to analyse the cytokine concentration by means of Multiplex Assay, with particular reference to IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. Results: Lapaquistat was able to preserve the cellular morphology in MKD-cellular model, as assesses by impedance analysis. However, treatment with Lapaquistat didn't reduce LPS-induced apoptosis. As for the cytokine profile, as expected, the production of inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 significantly increased following treatment with LPS in cells treated with alendronate in a dosedependent manner. At low doses of alendronate, Lapaquistat was able to reduce the release of these cytokines, contrasting inflammation, with a significative effect on IL-6.

However, further studies in animal models are needed to evaluate whether the benefits of increasing pre-squalene isoprenoids overcame the costs of a reduction of post-squalene sterols in vivo, which might affect in other ways the cell function. Introduction: Increasing evidence suggests that idiopathic Recurrent Pericarditis (RP) results from inflammasome activation. The autoinflammatory (AIF) origin is strongly supported by the efficacy of treatments typically applied in Familial Mediterrenean Fever (FMF) and other AIF diseases; colchicine and IL1 blockade.

Introduction: Autoinflammatory diseases are inborn errors of the innate immune system. They present with uncontrolled systemic and organ specific inflammation, like infections, that generally associate inflammation of the skin and others organs since neonatal period and raised inflammatory markers in blood. Some may not have fever. In recent years, new mutations were discovered, as causes of primary immunodeficiencies. SAMD9L expression is high in B and NK lymphocytes, moderate in T cells, monocytes, neutrophils, lung and muscle and low in skin, liver, heart and kidney tissues. Missense mutation in SAMD9L can cause, an Early-Onset Immune-Dysregulation Syndrome of Neutrophilic Panniculitis, Interstitial Lung Disease and Cytopenias. Objectives: Report clinical case and immune reconstitution 3 years after bone marrow transplant in a patient with severe neonatal autoinflammatory syndrome due to SAMD9L mutation, with innate and adaptive immune compromise. Methods: Retrospective analysis of a clinical history and immune reconstitution in a patient with a new primary disease of immune dysregulation.

In the immunological lab: hypogammaglobulinemia and almost absent B cell counts. Because of that she began treatment with intravenous gammaglobulin and corticosteroid, in spite of it she presented several skin exacerbations. So anti-TNF \u03b1 (0.8 mg/dose weekly) treatment was added. She could improve skin lesions and almost normalized CRP but at fifth dose, she presented low platelets, white cells count and visceromegaly with respiratory failure because of Pneumocity Jiroveci and skin erythema and adenopathy at BCG site, needing mechanical ventilation, antibiotic, corticosteroid, cyclosporine and tuberculostatics drug because: positive Mycobacterium bovis in blood. After this treatment she presented partial response with marrow aplasia and she received canakinumab (ant IL-1\u03b2) 1 mg/kg/dose. No mutation in ADA2, TNFRSF1A, CECR1 and NLRP3 was found.

Despite correction surgery, he displayed proteinuria after one year, and kidney biopsy did not revealed significant lesions. After two years, he displayed bilateral tarsal malformations requiring orthopedic surgery. At the age of 6, a pathological fracture of the right wrist occurred, and local X-ray revealed osteolysis of carpal bones. The patient B was treated with intra-articular steroid injection and subcutaneous methotrexate for one year without benefit because of a suspected juvenile idiopathic arthritis of the right wrist.

C3 and C4 positive mesangial deposits were also present. The patient C was sent to our observation for a suspected juvenile idiopathic arthritis of the right wrist. No inflammatory signs were present at the ultrasound examination. Sanger sequencing of the MAFB gene revealed in all the patients a novel heterozygous mutation. Although specific variants have not been reported before, the nature and position of the variants associated with the clinical features of the patients strongly argued in favor of their pathogenic role. The serum C1q concentration was normal in all the patients. Conclusion: MCTO-associated progressive nephropathy is an orphan disease with dramatic impact on the patient life who usually require kidney transplantation in the adulthood. For that reason, despite ACE-inhibitor could reduce progression of kidney dysfunction, retarding the onset of end state kidney disease, other treatments should be used to permit a sufficient lifelong kidney function in patients with the well-known structural kidney damage related to MafBdeficiency. Furthermore, a slight proteinuria reduction in a patient with MCTO treated with cyclosporine has been reported. However, despite further studies are necessary to exclude a role of complement system in the progressive nephropathy of patients with MCTO, our study seems to exclude a MafB-dependent regulation of complement component C1q production in humans.

Genomic analysis was done using singleton whole exome sequencing (WES). Results: Our patient is a male with suspected ataxia telangiectasia and JIA. His older sister suffers from cerebral palsy (due to complications of premature birth). He was diagnosed with ataxia at 3 years of age. Brain MRI performed at the age of 15 years revealed pontocerebellar hypoplasia and laboratory testing showed selective IgA deficiency, decrease in proportion of lymphocytes and progressive elevation of alpha fetoprotein concentration. Genetic testing excluded Friedrich ataxia and spinocerebellar ataxia. Cytogenetics analysis detected mosaic translocation (7;14) suggestive of chromosomal instability. These findings were clinically suggestive of A-T. Regarding the JIA, the patient first noticed swelling of the fifth finger of the right foot at 13 years of age. Two years later the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb of his left hand started to swell and finally his left knee. MRI revealed chronic effusion, oedema and a popliteal cyst in the left knee. MRI of the right foot detected erosive changes followed with the expansion of the soft tissue and bone. Ultrasound of hands, left knee and feet confirmed chronic inflammatory changes. Based on these features the patient was diagnosed with JIA and treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Due to the chronic character of JIA and having in mind the concomitant disease, low doses of methotrexate were initiated alongside NSAIDs, after which a stable improvement followed.

Further analysis of these case with the rare association between A-T and JIA may help us explore and understand the possible role of the ATM gene in development of JIA. Introduction: Munchausen syndrome by proxy (MSBP) is a mental health problem in which a caregiver makes up or causes an illness or injury in a person under his or her care, such as a child. Because vulnerable people are the victims, MSBP is a form of child abuse.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods:"}, {"text": "Objectives: The purpose of the study was to analyze the case of undifferentiated connective tissue disease and probable autoinflammatory disease as a manifestation of MSBP.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods:"}, {"text": "Methods: A 2-years-old girl was referred to Pediatric Hospital for symptoms of increase in body temperature to 39-40\u00ba C, recurrent lower back pain, lethargy, general weakness. A baby was from the first pregnancy. The second pregnancy of the mother ended in premature stillbirth of the twins under unknown circumstances. Results: Physical examination confirmed daily episodes of resistant to antipyretics febrile fever which were accompanied by severe lower back pain and hepatosplenomegaly. Anemia, leukocytosis, high rates of ESR (up to 149 mm/hour), C-reactive protein (up to 267,9 mg/l) and procalcitonin (up to 269,5 ng/ml) were recorded. Slightly increased Ig M and circulating immune complexes were noted in the serum of blood without violations of the cellular immunity. CT of abdomen just confirmed hepatosplenomegaly and mesenterial limfadenopathy. No other lymph nodes have been enlarged. Results of trepanobiopsy allowed to exclude the diagnosis of leukemia. A girl received antibiotics of different groups, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and detoxification therapy in relation to an intoxication syndrome of unknown etiology. 6 weeks later were arose positive alarm symptoms, and appendectomy was performed. Catarrhal appendicitis was diagnosed postoperatively. Further daily episodes of high fever up to 39-40\u00b0C and lower back pain were observed with symptoms of transient synovitis of the right hip joint. Undifferentiated connective tissue disease and utoinflammatory disease were suspected. A short-term effect of pulse corticosteroid therapy with methylprednisolone was noted. Methotrexate therapy was not accompanied by an improvement of girl's condition. The results of immunohistochemical study of the skin and kidneys confirmed mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis with a weak tubuleinterstitial component and secondary microvasculitis. In dynamics, oliguria, erythrocyturia, and unstable edema of the face and pubic area were increased on the background of normal rates of urea and creatinine in the blood serum. Methotrexate was replaced by cyclophosphamide. Episodes of hyperthermia last 5-6 days, after the normal body temperature is noted 1-2 days. Given the lack of positive dynamics, cyclophosphamide has been discontinued. Negotiations with European clinics for genetical diagnosis of autoinflammatory disease in this girl were conducted. Three months colchicine therapy didn't produce any positive effect. After 9 months from the debut of disease a group of doctors documented urinary catheter tie with thread that was the reason of blocked urine flow. During the search policemen seized a blank ampoule of pyrogenal from the mother. Pyrogenal is an immunomodulator which contains the bacterial lipopolysaccharide and enhances the functional activity of the cellular and humoral immune response (produced by the Russian Federation only). Side effects of the drug are dose-dependent and accompanied by high fever, lower back pain, and extremely increased inflammatory blood parameters. From the moment of mother isolation from the child, girl's condition has improved, all symptoms of the disease have disappeared till now. Conclusion: The diagnostic search for recidive fever is extremely difficult even for a highly qualified doctor. In the search for rare diseases accompanied by a persistent fever, a doctor should always remember about MSBP. Introduction: Takayasu arteritis is a granulomatous large vessel vasculitis involving mainly the aorta and its major branches.

The minor salivary gland and lymph-node biopsies showed a chronic sclerosing sialoadenitis and a reactive follicular hyperplasia, respectively. The laboratory work up showed a neutrophilic leukocytosis and elevation of acute phase reactants. A broad work-up for infectious diseases was negative, as chest x-ray, whole body STIR-MRI and bone marrow evaluation. Abdominal US identified a slight splenomegaly. All the immunologic investigations were negative except for a B CD20 lymphocyte expansion and an elevation of plasmatic IgG4. The double negative T lymphocytes were negative, as the FAS-mediated apoptosis test. A 41-gene NGS panel for autoinflammatory diseases was negative. The patient was treated with i.v. metilprednisolone (2 mg/kg), with prompt clinical response and resolution of acute phase reactants, but reappearance at tapering. In light of the non-specific clinical and immunological findings and the age of the patient, treatment with Mophetil Mycophenolate (600 mg/mq twice a day) was started with good response. After 3 months, the patient started to complain with pain of the right foot and after few days presented with cyanosis of the anterior part of the right foot and an ulcer of the first toe, associated to severe systemic hypertension and elevation of acute phase reactants. The Doppler US revealed a reduced patency of the common iliac arteries, with a wall thickening of the common right iliac artery, a discontinuous aspect of the femoral and posterior tibial right arteries and of the subrenal abdominal aorta. The angioCT and angioMRI showed a thickening of the abdominal aorta, the common right iliac artery, and the distal part of the brachial right artery. Full dose iloprost, heparine and metylprednisolone pulses were started, together with cyclophosphamide (4 mg/kg/day) with quick amelioration of the pain; however, the ischemia evolved to the entire first toe and the third phalanx of the third and fourth toe.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods:"}, {"text": "In the hypothesis of a large vessel vasculitis, treatment with rituximab (375 mg/m2 x 4 weeks) was added, with complete control of systemic inflammation and without a further evolution of the ischemia.

Subsequently, she had seizures on several occasions successfully treated with diazepam. Since 11 months of age, the child has had periodic protracted febrile episodes. Seven months after the onset of fever, she developed intermittent erythema accompanied with swelling of both hands, feet, knees and face. Subsequently, episodes of fever recurred in an irregular rhythm. The patient has been showing signs of progressive fatigue and severe facial erythema unrelated to febrility. Her physical exam was unremarkable apart from occasional facial erythema. Laboratory findings were normal, except for the long-lasting microcytic anemia (the lowest hemoglobin was 85 g/L) and elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate during the febrile episodes. Comprehensive laboratory, microbiological and immunological examination failed to establish underlying diagnosis. Bone marrow examinations were normal. The frequent and prolonged febrile episodes were successfully treated with short-term methylprednisolone, however this treatment failed to prevent the occurrence of new episodes. To ameliorate fevers, TNF\u03b1 inhibitor (etanercept) was consequently introduced in therapy at 5 years of age. Over the four month period after the initiation of TNF\u03b1 inhibitor, the child had no further febrile episodes or seizures and there was an improvement in appetite and general condition. It is planned to reduce the dose of antiepileptics. Genomic testing using trio WES identified a de novo heterozygous TRNT1 variant, NM_182916.2 (TRNT1_v001): c.448C>T, p.(R150C), predicted to be pathogenic with high CADD score. Previous cases of TRNT1 deficiency have been described with bialellic TRNT1 pathogenic variants and analyses are underway to elucidate whether this finding could establish the underlying diagnosis. At present we hypothesize that this could be a case of unidentified second intronic TRNT1 variant or that this TRNT1 variant could have a dominant negative effect. In this respect, it should be noted that in our patient we have identified some but not other features of SIFD. Conclusion: Clinical manifestations associated with TRNT1 deficiency have a broad spectrum with significant clinical heterogeneity, which makes it difficult for rapid clinical recognition. Although the WES is as a powerful tool for the diagnosis of clinically unrecognized genetic conditions, there are still unresolved cases that pose a challenge in routine clinical practice. A 35-year-old man was referred to ophthalmologist's evaluation for blurry vision in his left eye. The fundus examination showed choroidal lesions in both eyes. His past medical history was relevant for recurrent episodes of fever and skin rashes, inflammatory lesions of the osteoarticular-muscular system, one episode of aseptic meningitis, an intracranial granuloma and two episodes of anterior uveitis. In adulthood, his medical history included episodes of fever with urticaria and subcutaneous nodules. The histological examination of two skin lesions showed a reactive angioendotheliomatosis and a leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Spleen biopsy revealed the finding of non-caseating granulomas. Brain TC founded multiple lytic and sclerotic skull lesions. He was diagnosed with atypical sarcoidosis and started oral steroid and methotrexate.

Moreover, cell from the patient displayed a lower sensitivity to PIM447. RNAseq showed an altered expression profile in genes involved in the extracellular matrix organization. Our data revealed an increased expression of some collagen and matrix metalloproteinases genes, which are related to invasion and migration processes, already known to be impaired in several cancer types, and a decreased expression in genes responsible for anti-tumorigenic activity.

Results: MAS was found to herald systemic diseases in 8 cases (7F, 1M, median age 46.2 years). The autoimmune diseases were: systemic lupus erythematosus (3 cases-all with anti-Ro+ and no anti-dsDNA, in 2 overlap with Sjogren's syndrome), inflammatory idiopathic myopathy (2 cases), seronegative rheumatoid arthritis, systemic pyoderma gangrenosum and polyarteritis nodosa (1 case each).

Lachmann Pediatric Rheumatology 2019, 17(Suppl 1):P1127Introduction: The development of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in individuals who had been treated during childhood with human cadaveric pituitary-derived growth hormone (c-hGH) was first reported in 1985 and resulted in its immediate withdrawal and replacement with recombinant protein. Subsequently amyloid-\u03b2 protein (A\u03b2) deposits have been described in individuals with CJD and prior exposure to c-hGH. Recently misfolded A\u03b2 peptide was identified in archived vials of human c-hGH, which induced A\u03b2 pathology in an experimental model (Purro et a Nature 2018) supporting its role in the transmission of CJD.These observations are reminiscent of the concept of amyloid enhancing factor (AEF), in experimentally induced AA amyloidosis, in which administration of tiny amounts ofamyloidotic material is associated with massively accelerated AA amyloid deposition.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF13": {"text": "pure red cell aplasia[PRCA], immune mediated neutropenia, trilineage bone marrow failure) were referred for hSCT. Results: Anti-TNF Analysis: In total, 42/45 were initiated on anti-TNF agents.

Prior to anti-TNF initiation, there were 66 cumulative strokes and post-anti-TNF initiation, there were 0 strokes. There was a statistically significant decrease in inflammatory burden (ESR, CRP) post-anti-TNF initiation. Pre-treatment transient elastography was abnormal in 11/34 with 6/11 normalizing posttreatment. The inflammatory skin manifestations such as erythema nodosum and vasculitic nodules improved on treatment. There was visible improvement of livedo racemosa but little response to peripheral vascular disease/Raynaud' s phenomenon with 1 patient undergoing 3 partial digit amputations despite treatment. The patient with PRCA remained transfusion dependent. Immune mediated neutropenia was present in 10/38 pre-anti-TNF and persisted in 6/10 post-treatment. Trilineage bone marrow failure developed in 1 patient on anti-TNF. hSCT Analysis: At the time of analysis 4/45 had undergone hSCT (2 for immune mediated neutropenia, 1 for combined PRCA/immune mediated neutropenia, 1 for trilineage bone marrow failure).All had been on anti-TNF agents leading up to hSCT and 1 developed trilineage bone marrow failure after 4 years of anti-TNF treatment. All received reduced intensity conditioning with varying regimens. One patient was transplanted successfully and is doing well 1 year post-transplant. Two additional patients with immune mediated neutropenia experienced graft failure due to host CD8+T lymphocyte attack requiring second transplant. Patient 4 remains hospitalized after decreasing chimerism and reemergent neutropenia necessitated donor lymphocyte infusion. Three additional patients await hSCT.

Interferonopathies comprise an expanding group of monogenic diseases characterised by disturbance of the homeostatic control of IFN-mediated immun responses. Although differing in the degree of phenotypic expression and severity, the clinical presentation of the diseases shows a considerable degree of overlap, reflecting their common pathogenetic mechanisms. Objectives: Spondyloenchondrodysplasia with immune dysregulation (SPENCDI) is an immuno-osseous dysplasia combining the typical metaphyseal and vertebral bone lesions of SPENCDI and neurologic involvement. Methods: 19 years old a male patient presented with arthralgia and rash in 2014. On physical examination short stature and erythematous skin rash were noted. Laboratory studies revealedproteinuria (740 mg/ d), lymphopenia (1150/mm3), elevated ESR (51 mm/h), CRP (15 mg/l, N<5) and low C3 level. The C4 level was normal. ANA was homogenously positive, while the anti ds-DNA antibody was also positive. Anticardiolipin IgG and IgM and the lupus anticoagulant were negative. HBsAg, HCV and HIV were negative. IgG, IgA and IgM levels were normal. Skin bipsy revealed perivascular dematitis, while a kidney biopsy showed class II lupus nephritis. The patient was given methyl prednisolone, hydroxycholoroquine and azathioprine. On follow up, the proteinuriadecreased. However, he developed attacks of seizuresand ataxia. The neurologic examination, EEG and EMG, were normal. Cranial tomography revealed calcification of lentiform nucleus, corona radiata, frontal lobe white matter and dentate nuclei. In 2015, he presented with abdominal paine, vomiting and nausea. Abdominal CT revealed edema and inflammation of jejenum and dudenum.The steroid dose was increased. After a few months, the symptoms recurred. The patient was thought to have gastrointestinalinvolvement due to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rituximab was added to the treatment. Thereafter the patient did not have anysymptoms related toacute abdomen. Results: A direct raiographic examination of the spine revealed platyspondyly. The parents were consanguineous. His sister was under follow up due to a diagnosis of juvenil onset SLE.Intracranial calcifications, spastic paraparesis, short stature, systemic lupus erythematosus and platyspondyly suggested a diagnosis of SPENCD. Next generation sequencing of the ACP5 gene showed that the patient and his sisters were homozygous for the c.155A C/p.K52T variant. Both parents were heterozygous forthis variant. Conclusion: SPENCDI is a recessive genetic disease caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation in the ACP5 gene on chromosome 19p13. Immune dysregulation ranges from autoimmunity to immunodeficiency. Neurologic and autoimmune manifestations have been observed in different combinations. Skeletal, nneurologic and immune phenotypes were observed between members of the same family.UOC Genetica Medica, IRCCS Istituto Giannina Gaslini; 2 Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Genova; 3 Clinica Pediatrica Reumatologia e UOSD Centro Malattie Autoinfiammatorie-Immunodeficienze, IRCCS Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova; 4 Centre for Advanced Studies Research and Development in Sardinia (CRS4), Science and Technology Park Polaris, Pula; 5 Clinica Pediatrica,Talassemie e Malattie Rare, Ospedale Brotzu e Universit\u00e0 degli studi di Cagliari, Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy Correspondence: Alice Grossi Pediatric Rheumatology 2019, 17(Suppl 1):P1073", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF71": {"text": ":62-72 2.

However, the distinction between HA 20 and BD is unknown. Objectives: To clarify specific features of HA20 compared to BD. Methods: The clinical features of 54 cases of HA 20 cases were examined from the literature including our 4 cases and compared with 520 Japanese BD patients followed at our facility. All BD patients met the 1987 revised diagnostic criteria of the Japanese Bebcet's Disease Eesearch Committee. The research protocol was approved by the facility review committee of Yokohama City University School of Medicine. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 22 (IBM Japan, Tokyo, Japan). Category variables were analyzed using Chi-square test or Cochran-Armitage test. Continuous variables were examined using Student's t test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results: significantly high recurrent fever (74.0%) and gastrointestinal involvement, and less eye involvement than BD. Among gastrointestinal involvement and HA20 patients, 22 (81.8 percent) 18 showed gastrointestinal ulcers including 2 cases with typical deep iliocecal ulcer seen in BD. The positive rate of HLA-B51 was lower (27.3 %) than that of BD (47.8 %), but since the majority of HA 20 has been reported by European populations whose HLA-B51 positive rate is lower than Japanese, it is uncertain whether HLA-B51 affects on HA20 phenotype or not. Conclusion: Comparison of HA 20 and BD cohort revealed several important features of HA 20: early onset, familial onset, recurrent fever, gastrointestinal involvement, and less eye involvement. Patients with familial recurrent fever with early onset with BD symptoms, especially gastrointestinal disorders, should consider TNFAIP3 gene screening.P1077Novel missense mutation of TNFAIP3 gene in a family with A20haploinsufficiency Charlotte Borocco 1,2 , Guillaume Sarrabay 3,4 , Guilaine Boursier 3,4 , Solene Artru 5 , Helene Palluy 1 , Isabelle Touitou 3,4 , Isabelle Kone-Paut 1,2 Pediatric Rheumatology, Bicetre University Hospital; 2 CeReMAIA, Le Kremlin-Bic\u00eatre; 3 Laboratory of Rare and Autoinflammatory Genetic Diseases, Montpellier University Hospital; 4 CeReMAIA, Montpellier; Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Necker Enfants Malades University Hospital, Paris, France Correspondence: Isabelle Kone-Paut Pediatric Rheumatology 2019, 17(Suppl 1):P1077", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF73": {"text": "abstract P1076).

Methods: The Agilent SureDesign tool was used to design an NGS panel targeting 256 genes, grouped into the following broad clinical phenotypes: AID; monogenic vasculitis/vasculopathy; interferonopathies; haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH); immunodeficiencies; metabolic diseases and other inherited white matter diseases. The targeted region includes coding exons, conserved non-coding exons, upstream promoter regions, and splice sites. Captured and indexed libraries (QXT Target Enrichment System) were sequenced as a multiplex of 16 samples on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer in paired-end mode. Positive controls for panel validation comprised 16 DNA samples from patients with confirmed mutations. We then applied the panel to test 60 prospective samples with suspected but unconfirmed monogenic autoinflammation of the CNS. Read alignment, variant calling, and annotation were performed using Agilent SureCall v3.0 software.Results:In the validation stage, our targeted panel detected all known mutations in the 16 positive control samples. The panel was effective at detecting different types of variants, including rare and common single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertion/ deletions, splice-junction variants, upstream promoter region variants, and somatic mosaicism. Prospective testing of the panel in 60 patients revealed pathogenic variants (class 4 or 5) in 23 of 60 patients giving a detection rate of 38%.A definitive molecular diagnosis was established in 11/60 patients (18%).

Clinicians caring for patients with an AID without a pathogenic mutation in known diseasecausing genes do not have a streamlined approach to further genetic evaluation.Objectives: The Australian Autoinflammatory Diseases Registry (AADRY) aims to provide clinicians with access to a research team to further evaluate patients without an established genetic diagnosis as well as to address limitations in the current knowledge of AIDs in Australia. Methods: Patients with suspected AIDs were recruited as trios. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on whole blood or saliva using the Hiseq 4000 platform and Illumina Sureselect XT V5 library. A variant list was generated using a pipeline, variant caller and filtering strategy previously described. Initial filtering of the variants proceeded by excluding synonymous and common variants, and intronic variants more than 50 base pairs from an intron-exon junction. Sequence data quality was assessed by viewing the BAM file on the Integrated genomics viewer. Variant classification was based on ACMG consensus guidelines. Results: From September 2015 to June 2018, 34 index cases underwent WES. Initial curation analysis looked at autoinflammatory genes as per IUIS and ISSAID. A total of 77 variants in 34 patients were filtered with no pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants detected. AADRY has curated the WES of 34 index cases, including 19 trios. A likely pathogenic variant was discovered in one family with a highly penetrant dominantly inherited dermatological phenotype. No clear genetic diagnosis has been made in the remaining index cases, however a number of candidate novel variants are being evaluated. Further work is now underway to gather data on patients with genetically defined AIDs so that the retrospective cohort of patients with an established diagnosis is captured. Review of the appropriate literature. 14 sources on the situation in Georgia published from 1981 until now, were analyzed. 8 of them included genetic data. In summary MEFV mutation was investigated in 202 clinically healthy neonates in Tbilisi and 180 patients (children and adolescents) from different regions of Georgia. Results: The carrier rate of MEFV mutations in neonates was remarkable: Autoinflammatory and Autoimmune Diseases has been established. Hopefully it will help to create more comprehensive registry of patients with these diseases and obtain new data about their genetic and clinical polymorphism.

Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of 302 genes related to PIDs and AIDs was performed. Results: Rare variants of PID genes were detected in 7/22 (32%) patients. Mutations affecting the genes previously associated with CNO were found only in two patients: one of them carried heterozygous variant IL1RN c.170G>T (p.C57F), and another had IL1RN c.512T>C (p.V171A). No mutation of LPIN2 was revealed. Other detected variants included one pathogenic MEFV p.M694V mutation in the heterozygous state and some VUS in CD40LG, NLRP12, CR2, NLRP3, IL12B, PLCG2, SH3BP2, CARD14, IRF8, CASP10, and NFKB1A genes.Conclusion: Mutations in known genes were detected only in a minor fraction of CNO patients from Dagestan and Chechnya.

Although HLA-B51 has been previously described as the most associated allel with BD, presence of BD patients without the B51 allel (42.8%), healthy individuals with HLA-B51 allel (18.1%) were reported. Also, various genetic associations with BD revealed through several genome-wide association and linkage analysis indicate that genetic and environmental factors may play role in BD pathogenesis. Objectives: Investigation of proteome profile is crucial to elucidate disease pathogenesis and related molecular pathways especially in phenotypes like BD with complex genetics and clinical heterogeneity. In this study, we aimed to identify differentially expressed proteins in BD and related pathways through proteomic analyses performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples. Methods: Study groups were composed of active BD (N=33), inactive BD (N=26), and healthy controls (N=28). Isolated PBMC protein samples from each group were pooled and then separated using 2D-DIGE. Protein spots with at least 2 fold-changes or statistical significance in terms of spot density were compared among the groups, and identified by MALDI-TOF-MS. Bioinformatic pathway analyses were carried out through KEGG, PANTHER, and STRING databases. Western blot analyses were performed for WDR1, PGK1, and calreticulin to confirm 2D-DIGE results. Results: A total of 369 protein spots were detected by 2D-DIGE. A number of differentially expressed spots were found: 115 for activeTable 1 (abstract P2058).

Thirty patients (63.8%) were receiving concomitant treatment with glucocorticoids at the median dose (range) of 0.69 (0.02-2.75) mg/kg/die. Thirty nine out of 47 patients had > 6 months of follow-up. Among these 39 patients, 27 (69.2%) achieved CID at 6 months and 5/27 (18.5%) were still on glucocorticoids. Of the 30 patients who received concomitant glucocorticoids at baseline, 24 achieved 6 months of follow-up and 12 (50%) of these were able to withdraw glucocorticoids. Minor adverse events were reported in 5/ 30 (16.6%) patients:upper respiratory tract infections in 4 and transient injection site reaction in 1. No cases of macrophage activation syndrome was reported. Conclusion: Our results provide initial real world evidence of the efficacy of treatment with canakinumab in patients with sJIA. In our study the percentage of patients who reached CID at 6 months is slightly higher (69.2%) than reported at the end (from 3 months to one year) of the 2 published randomized trials (60%)(1). No serious adverse events were recorded in our population.Introduction: A large body of evidence demonstrates the pivotal role of interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) in the pathogenesis of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). IFN\u03b3 is a key endogenous activator of macrophages and exerts its biological activities by phosphorylation of the transcription factor Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). Objectives: In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the phosphorylation status of STAT1 in whole blood cells represents a good biomarker for the identification of patients at early stages of MAS/ sHLH. Methods: Whole blood samples from patients with suspected untreated MAS/sHLH (n=7) and suspected treated (glucocorticoids) MAS/sHLH (n=9) were collected prospectively. As controls, whole blood samples from patients with active systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (sJIA) without MAS at sampling (n=6) and healthy subjects (HS, n=7) were used. Fresh whole blood cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with different concentrations of IFN\u03b3 (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 ng/ml) for 10 minutes. The intracellular phosphorylation levels of Tyrosine (701) STAT1 (pSTAT1) were evaluated by flow cytometry. Results have been expressed as Delta mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), calculated by subtracting the MFI of cells stained with isotype control antibody (Ab) from that stained with anti-pSTAT1 Ab. Anti CD3, CD14 and CD16 staining was performed to discriminate the monocyte, neutrophil, natural killer-and T-cell subpopulations. Results: In both treated and untreated MAS/sHLH patients, flow cytometric analyses showed no significant differences in pSTAT1 levels in unstimulated monocyte, neutrophil, natural killer and T cell subpopulations, compared to sJIA and healthy subjects. Interestingly, we found that, compared to sJIA and healthy subjects, in patients with untreated MAS/sHLH, pSTAT1 levels were significantly higher in monocytes (p<0,01 Vs HS, p<0,05 Vs sJIA and p<0,01 Vs HS, p<0,05 Vs sJIA, for stimulation with 1 and 10 ng/ml of IFNg respectively) and neutrophils (p<0,05 Vs HS, p<0,05 Vs sJIA and p<0,01 Vs HS, p<0,01 Vs sJIA) stimulated with the higher concentrations of IFN\u03b3 (1 and 10 ng/ml). In contrast, we did not find differences in the levels of pSTAT1 observed in stimulated monocytes and neutrophils from treated MAS/sHLH patients or those observed in cells from active sJIA and healthy subjects. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that the combined evaluation of pSTAT1 levels by flow cytometry in monocytes and neutrophils stimulated with high doses of IFN\u03b3 show high levels of pSTAT1 and might contribute to the identification of patients at early stages of MAS/sHLH. In addition, our results further support the involvement of IFN\u03b3 in the development of the diseases, as suggested by the increased phosphorylated STAT1 levels exclusively in patients with active MAS/sHLH and not in patients with active sJIA.P2064 Whole blood cells from patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) in clinical inactive disease displayed a dysregulated response to TLR-4 stimulation Antonia Pascarella, Manuela Pardeo, Ivan Caiello, Claudia Bracaglia, Marianna N.

In regression analysis, patients experiencing adverse events (AEs) (HR=3.029 [C.I.1.750-5.242], p<0.0001) and those previously treated with other biotechnologic agents (HR=1.818 [C.I. 1.007-3.282], p=0.047) were associated with a higher hazard ratio of ANA discontinuation. The median treatment delay was significantly higher among patients discontinuing ANA (p<0.0001). A significant CS-(p=0.033) and cDMARDs-sparing effect (p<0.0001) was also recorded. Less than one third of our cohort developed AEs and 85% were deemed mild in nature, with 70% involving the skin. Conclusion: Our findings display an overall excellent DRR of ANA on the long run for both sJIA and AOSD that may be further optimized by closely monitoring patient's safety issues and employing this IL-1 inhibitor as a first-line biologic as early as possible. Moreover, ANA allowed a significant drug-sparing effect while showing a good safety profile.P2066 Predictors of effectiveness of anakinra in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis Jessica Tibaldi 1 , Bendetta Saccomanno 1 , Francesca Minoia 2 , Francesca Bagnasco 3 , Angela Pistorio 3 , Andreessa Guariento 4 , Roberta Caorsi 3 , Alesandro Consolaro 1 , Marco Gattorno 3 , Angelo Ravelli 1 Istituto G.

See text for descriptionObjectives: To report safety and efficacy of faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in a patient carrying a de novo missense mutations in NLRC4, with gut inflammation and gut colonization by multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens. Methods: Subject and donors were screened for potential FMT according toCammarota et al. (Gut, 2017)  with modifications introduced by Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Ges\u00f9 Committee for paediatric FMT procedures. Culture-based and NGS-based microbiota profiling were performed to address MDR persistence and microbial associated communities coupled to inflammatory profiling. After wide donor screening, a universal adult donor was selected and infusion performed twice by colonoscopy from fresh and frozen faeces, respectively. A one year FMT follow up was ensured to address clinical outcomes. Results: A Caucasian 16 months old boy presented, from 1 month of life, with recurrent HLH, diarrhoea and vasculitic skin lesions, secondary to a de novo missense mutation in NLRC4 (I343N). His disease was not controlled despite treatment with repeated high dose of intravenous methylprednisolone pulses and chronic daily glucocorticoid therapy, cyclosporine-A (5 mg/kg) and anakinra (ranging from 5 to 25 mg/kg/day). Because of recurrent HLH episodes, the patient was treated with emapalumab (anti-IFNgamma antibody) for three months, with HLH control. However, the patient presented persistent diarrhoea with gut inflammation and colonization by MDR pathogens (Enterobacter cloacae and Enterococcus faecalis), leading by translocation to systemic infections and, hence, HLH reactivation. Moreover, he developed severe intestinal meteorism with subsequent paralytic-ileus that required ileostomy. Based on the hypothesis that his intestinal dysbiosis concurred in the persistent gut inflammation related to his underlying disease, he received a first FMT with initial clinical improvement. Therefore, ileal anastomosis was performed with recanalization, and a second FMT was performed a month later. The patient did not develop any complication. The stool cultures no longer showed the presence of enteropathogenic germs and since the last FMT (12 months of follow-up) he did not present any symptom of gut inflammation or HLH reactivations. Conclusion: NLRC4-related disease is typically characterized by enterocolitis and NLRC4, highly expressed in intestinal macrophages, is critical for pathogen restriction by phagocytes in the gut lamina propria. The chronic gut inflammation of NLRC4-patients is a stimulus for systemic inflammation. Moreover, pathogens present in the gut can trigger HLH episodes. A presence of a selected microbiota from appropriate donor can decrease gut inflammation. FMT may represent a valid and safe therapeutic option in NLRC4-patients in order to reduce chronic inflammatory stimuli. for publication has been obtained from patient YesDisclosure of Interest C.

Canakinumab is a human monoclonal antibody against IL-1\u03b2, licensed for the treatment of CAPS. Objectives: To describe the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of a canakinumab vial-sharing programme for paediatric patients with CAPS. Methods: Retrospective case series and clinical service description of a national specially commissioned CAPS clinic at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH). Efficacy was assessed using the CAPS disease activity score (DAS) and serum amyloid A protein (SAA). Adverse events were collected to determine safety. The number of canakinumab vials saved were considered when investigating the costeffectiveness of vial-sharing. Results: Nineteen/20 (95%) of our paediatric patients achieved minimally active clinical disease activity with canakinumab monotherapy; and 75% achieved both minimally active clinical disease and serological remission using a pre-specified definition based on the CAPS DAS and SAA level. Canakinumab was well tolerated, with only one child developing an infection requiring hospitalisation during the study.Canakinumab vial sharing resulted in 117 vials of canakinumab saved over a 24-month period, equating to a direct drug-related cost saving of \u00a31,385,821, and a conservative estimated 5-year costsaving of \u00a33,464,552.50. Conclusion: We provide further evidence for the efficacy and safety of canakinumab in children with CAPS, and highlight the costeffectiveness of a vial-sharing programme for this high cost medicine. We suggest that this could have important implications for the delivery of other high cost medicines used in paediatric practice.Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty; 2 University of Istanbul -Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey Correspondence: Bilgesu Ergezen Pediatric Rheumatology 2019, 17(Suppl 1):P2073", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF179": {"text": "abstract P2071).

Mendonca Pediatric Rheumatology 2019, 17(Suppl 1):P2082Introduction: The immunological concept of autoinflammation made possible genetic dissection of inflammation, development of new cytokine target therapies and catalogue the a.k.a. Autoinflammatory Diseases (AID). However, in 50% or more, no causative gene can be found going down to Undefined Inflammatory Syndromes (UIS). The identification of the pathogenic mechanisms related to most of the monogenic and multifactorial auto inflammatory diseases prompted the evidence of IL-1 as a crucial target for treatment.Moreover,the success of these treatments in the most frequent autoinflammatory diseases, suggested their off-label use in many other rare conditions, including in the undifferentiated AID.Objectives: This paper aims to retrospectively report 10 years experience with different IL-1 blocking agents in monogenic and non monogenic disorders in a single, pediatric reference center in Italy. Methods: All patients followed by the Pediatrics and Rheumatology Unit ogf Gaslini Institutewho start an anti-IL1 treatment , from 2005 to 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Patient's descriptive characteristics were reported as mean, standard deviation, minimal and maximum values. The variables associated with response in the univariate analysis (p<0.20) were included in the multivariate model. Results: From 2005, 108 consecutive patients receive at least one anti-IL-1 treatment, namely Anakinra or Canakinumab. Among monogenic AID (60,1%), 18% were CAPS, 16% TRAPS, 13% Hyper IgD/MKD, 8% PAPA, 1% DADA2. Anti-IL1 was also used in many multifactorial conditions, mainly SJIA (n=51), undefined SAID (n=18), and recurrent recurent idiopathic pericarditis (n=6) and one patient with SAPHO syndrome. Among the monogenic forms, CAPS, TRAPS and Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency, that started on anakinra (n=19) 73,7% (n=14) achieved a complete or partial control of their condition. Switching to canakinumab (n=12) or starting direct with canakinumab (n=9) resulted in 85% of disease control. UIS presented high rate of response to anakinra, 75% versus 52% of SJIA. Biologic drug could be discontinued in 6 patients after clinical remission. Just one patient, with severe phenotype of MVK did not achieve clinical control with anakinra and was successfully submitted to HSCT. In the univariate model, using p value <0,20 , statically difference could be obtained with the following characteristics: symptoms started<1 year, presence of chest pain, macrophage activation syndrome, pericarditis, periodic fever, poliartrhitis and psoriasis. Using the multivariate model, just periodic fever remained as a positive predictor of response to anti-IL1 and the presence of poliartrhitis remained as a negative predictor. Conclusion: Different anti-IL1 strategies can be used to disease control for the monogenic forms of AID as well as for undefined AID.P2083 A prospective outcome of all 17 consecutive pediatric patients with chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis treated with intravenous pamidronate and followed at a single center over 15 years Paivi Miettunen 1 , Chloe M.

Little is known about longterm outcome in CNO after IV-PAM. Objectives: To describe a consecutive series of pediatric CNO (pCNO) patients who were prospectively followed after treatment with IV-PAM between 2003-2018 at a single center regarding: 1) The effect of IV-PAM on pain and Whole Body Magnetic Resonance Imaging (WBMRI) documented inflammation initially and after flare; 2) Relapse rate and; 3) Spinal CNO outcome and4) Urine N-telopeptide/creatinine ratio (UNtx/Cr, a product of collagen 1 breakdown) correlation with active CNO. Methods: Patients: All pCNOpatients (age at diagnosis <18 years) with WBMRI confirmedactive disease who required at least one dose of IV-PAM between 2003-2018 were included.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF185": {"text": "On final WBMRI, 12/17 (70%) had CR and 5/17 (30%) stable mild increased signal but no clinical symptoms. No further spinal compression fractures occurred. One patient required a third course of IV-PAM. Regarding UNtx/Cr, each patient hadappropriate reduction after first IV-PAM. No patients flared whileUNtx/Cr remained suppressed. Three patients developed arthritis and one acne. At last follow-up, 10/17 (59%) patients were on no medications, 4/17 (24%) required prn Naproxen for CNO and 3/17 (18%) were on Naproxen and/or disease modifying medications for arthritis. Conclusion:Long-term follow-up ofpCNO patients treated with IV-PAM confirms that while severalpatients eventually flare, the flares are less painful and have an excellent response to IV-PAM retreatment. No further spinal fractures occurred . No flares occurred while UNtx/Cr remained suppressed, suggesting a role of osteoclasts in CNO. Further prospective multicenter studies are now required to define the long-term clinical and imaging response to IV-PAM.P2084Efficacy of anakinra in the treatment of recurrent idiopathic pericarditis in pediatric population: experience in a tertiary hospital Sara Murias 1 , Luis Garc\u00eda-Guereta 2 , Rosa Alcobendas 1 , Diana Salas 2 , Clara Udaondo 1 , Pablo Fernandez 1 , Catarina Fervenza 1 , Agustin Remesal 1 Pediatric Rheumatology; 2 Pediatric Cardiology, University Hospital La Paz, Madrid, Spain Correspondence: Sara Murias Pediatric Rheumatology 2019, 17(Suppl 1):P2084", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF186": {"text": "P2085Clinical manifestations and treatment of idiopathic recurrent aseptic meningitis (IRAM) Michele Nehrebecky1  , David Beck 1 , Amanda Ombrello 1 , Ariane Soldatos 2 , Bryan Smith 2 , Patrycja M Hoffman 1 , Lauren Reoma 2 , Avindra Nath 2 , Karyl S.

Objectives: We aim to characterize clinical, imaging, laboratory and molecular features of a cohort of patients with IRAM, learn about pathophysiological mechanisms and share our experience with anakinra as a therapeutic option. Methods: A single center cohort of 12 patients with features of IRAM were evaluated from the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. Ages ranged from 12-74 years (5 females, 7 males) with majority adult onset.Duration of symptoms prior to NIH evaluation ranged from 4 months to 29 years. The most common clinical features were recurrent periodic fevers, fatigue, headache, decreased appetite, sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), CSF pleocytosis, elevated inflammatory markers and resolution of symptoms between episodes.

Higher prevalence along the Silk Route and familial cases suggest a genetic contribution to its pathogenesis. We present a Turkish family diagnosed with BD involving the father and three of the four children, all with disease onset before age 16. All affected individuals meet the International Study Group criteria for BD. Oral/ genital ulcers and ostiofolliculitis were shared by all probands. Posterior uveitis and deep vein thrombosis were diagnosed in the father while recurrent arthritis was prominent in the affected children.Objectives: This study aimed to identify the putative gene responsible for autosomal dominant BD. Methods:Exome sequencing was performed for unaffected mother and the four affected family members. Heterozygous, rare (MAF <0.005) and exonic/splicing variants were selected from among the shared variants, and those shared also with mother were excluded. Candidate variants that were chosen after analysis via bioinformatics tools were tested by Sanger sequencing of aforementioned members along with an unaffected and an undiagnosed sibling. Those variants were also screened in 152 healthy controls with high resolution melting (HRM) method. To evaluate the effect of the strongest candidate gene to autoinflammation, levels of IL1\u03b2 isolated from PBMC cells in four healthy controls and an affected member in exacerbation period were compared by ELISA method. Results: Exome analysis showed that patients did not carry variants in TNFAIP3 which is the known gene for autosomal dominant BD. Six rare, heterozygous variants which were shared among four affected members but absent in unaffected mother were selected as initial candidates. Three of those variants were eliminated because they were present in a healthy sib. The remaining three prominent candidate variantsc. 35A>T (p.D12V) in NAGK (rs150821125), c.1490C>G (p.A497G) in SLC9A2and c.11T>G (p.L4R) in IL1RAP (rs200782803) were absent in control samples. Furthermore, variants in SLC9A2and IL1RAP were not reported in gnomAD, 1000G, ExAC and ESP6500 databases. They are predicted as deleterious by computational prediction tool such as Mutationtaster, SIFT. Due to its involvement in IL1 signaling, IL1RAP stood out as the most prominentcandidate.No significant difference in IL1\u03b2 levels were observed between the affected member and the healthy controls (165.4 \u03bcg/ml vs 165.4 \u03bcg/ml respectively). Conclusion: Our results suggest that in this family the most relevant candidate isc.11T>G (p.L4R) in IL1RAP.This is the first report suggesting a possible association of IL1RAP with autosomal dominant BD.

Introduction: We hope to use this forum to guide us in the diagnosis and management of this child. Objectives: We describe a child from India, who presented with bilateral congenital glaucoma, recurrent granulomatous uveitis with episodes of fever, drowsiness, rash and arthritis. Methods: A 5.6 years old male born of a second degree consanguineous marriage presented at birth with watery eyes and was diagnosed with bilateral congenital glaucoma at 2 months of age. Since 8 months of age, he had episodes of fever with recurrent granulomatous uveitis and 'boil' like rash on his face since 1 year of age. Gradually the frequency of fever spikes increased to 2-3 per month with drowsiness and increase in rash. At 2 years of age, he developed swelling of the right knee.

Results: When he presented to us, on examination, he had failure to thrive, delayed milestones, poor vision, hearing loss, erysipelas like rash on the face and limbs with hepatosplenomegaly and arthritis of the right knee. His investigations were suggestive of anaemia (5. 1 -9.4 g/dl) , normal leucocyte counts with monocytosis (max 13%), intermittent thrombocytopenia(30000/cmm) with raisedESR (14-124mm/hr) and CRP(13-368 mg/l). He had hypertriglyceridemia with mild ferritin elevation and (1:40) 1+ ANA. His Immunoglobulin profile, Bone marrow, skin and conjunctival biopsy were all normal. Computed Tomography (CT) brain didnot show any intracranial calcification. Mutation studies were sent for BLAU and CAPS, which were negative. His interferon signals were negative. To date he has received oral corticosteroids, methotrexate, colchicine and thalidomide (as canakinumab and anakinra are not available in our country). After starting thalidomide, in the last 10 months his frequency of fever, rash, arthritis and uveitis has reduced. He is regularly taking topical drugs and following up with the ophthalmologist and has eventually developed cataract, retinal detachment, left eye corneal decompensation, pthisis bulbi (all sequelae of the panuveitis).We propose to start adalimumab for him. Introduction: Chronic Atypical Neutrophilic Dermatosis with Lipodystrophy and Elevated Temperature (CANDLE) syndrome is a complex autoinflammatory disorders arising from inborn defects in immunoproteasome. Several genes can be involved and cases with digenic inheritance have been described. However, many cases remain without the identification of a specific genetic defect. A positive interferon signature is typically found in patients and may serve as a diagnostic clue. Objectives: To describe clinical and genetic features in a girl with CANDLE and in her relatives with a variety of different rheumatologic complaints. Methods: We performed Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) on 10 family members. Moreover, we assessed RNA-seq on three sample from the proband, collected during acute phases of disease (samples positive to class I interferon signature (IS)) (1), and her parents. Results of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were compared with specimens from healthy controls. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were filtered by fold change > 2 and padj < 0.05. DEGs enrichment were performed using different R packages, such as pathfindR. Results: We describe the case of a 20 years old girl with clinical and biological data supportive of CANDLE syndrome. At the age of 3 years, she started presenting a clinical picture reminiscent of amyopathic dermatomyositis, with skin rash, lipodystrophy, subcutaneous panniculitis nodules, and more recently with chilblains, skin ulcerations, polyarticular arthritis and alopecia. Her pedigree includes several relatives with rheumatic disorders, but none has a clinical picture as complex and severe as our patient. This girl was found to have a strongly positive class I IS in peripheral blood cells. After several unsuccessful therapeutic attempts with antirheumatic drugs and biologics, the girl showed a dramatic clinical response to the JAK inhibitors tofacitinbib. IS resulted positive also in 4 of her relatives, three of whom presented also rheumatologic symptoms. Conversely, one uncle of the girl was affected with rheumatologic symptoms but had negative IS. The pedigree may suggest a complex pattern of inheritance, likely with a major dominant disorder, whose expression can be modulated by multigenic and/or environmental factors. WES failed to detect significant genetic variants in proteasome components. However, RNA-seq revealed a profile of differentially expressed IFN-regulated genes similar to that reported by Anja Brehm et al. in subjects with CANDLE/PRAAS (2) . Conclusion: Our results suggest that our family may present a multigenic form of CANDLE, with a complete clinical picture only in the proband, whilst other relatives may only present partial or incomplete forms of the disease. Introduction: STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI) is a newly described type I interferonopathy caused by autosomal dominant gain-of-function mutations in Transmembrane Protein 173 (TMEM173) gene. It is characterized by early-onset systemic inflammation with increased levels of acute phase reactants, severe cutaneous vasculopathy leading to extensive tissue loss and severe interstitial lung disease (ILD) Objectives: to describe an atypical clinical phenotype Methods: A 4 year-old young girl presented since the first months of life with recurrent fevers, arthralgia, persistent cough and failure to thrive (below the 5th percentiles). She never showed skin rash. At the age of 3, she was admitted to our hospital for persistent fever and arthritis of left knee and right ankle. She started ibuprofen without any benefit. Laboratory tests showed persistently elevated CRP and serum amyloid A levels, persistent microcytic anemia and increased IgG levels. Highly positive antinuclear antibody (title 1:640, homogeneous pattern) with positive p-ANCA was detected. Immunological and cytogenetic studies performed on bone marrow were normal. Both sweat and genetic test for cystic fibrosis were negative. She started low-dose glucocorticoids with incomplete response, persistent cough and polyarthritis in small joints. Chest X-ray and CT scan showed a severe interstitial lung disease (ILD) with bronchiectasis and small nodules. Extensive investigations for bacteria, virus and fungi and cytological tests on blood and bronchoalveolar lavage were negative. A lung biopsy revealed desquamative interstitial pneumonia. High-dose methylprednisolone, subcutaneous methotrexate and rituximab were started. Whole blood from patient and healthy donors (HD) (n = 10) were collected into PAXgene tubes. The type I IFN signature was defined by the expression levels of six IFNregulated genes (IFI27, IFI44L, IFIT1, ISG15, RSAD2, SIGLEC1), measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). As previously described by Rice GI, the median fold change of each IFNinduced gene, when compared with the median of the combined HD, was used to calculate the type I IFN score. The mean type IFN score of the HD plus two SD was calculated; we considered as positive a type IFN score higher of 1,42 Results: Because of a persistent inflammatory state, ILD and polyarthritis, an autoinflammatory syndrome with lung involvement was suspected (COPA and SAVI Syndromes) The sequencing of coatomer associated protein subunit alpha (COP\u03b1) gene showed no mutations while the molecular analysis of the TMEM173 gene by NGS showed the presence of c.463G>A (p.Val155Met) variant in heterozygotic status. Whole-blood gene expression studies demonstrated increased IFN signature (182,2), consistent with the values reported in SAVI patients and in other interferonopathies already described. Elevated levels of CXCL-10 (>1000 pg/ml) were also found Conclusion: The clinical picture of SAVI syndrome is characterized by early-onset (in the first month of life) cutaneous vasculitis, recurrent fevers, ILD, and systemic inflammation. Our patient never developed skin rash unlike the cases described in literature. Therefore, the lack of typical skin lesions should not exclude this clinical suspicion since the respiratory and systemic inflammatory components of the disease may predominate. In the context of early age of onset, ILD, failure to thrive and recurrent fevers, SAVI must be considered as a differential diagnosis. A better understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation is needed to improve SAVI management and prognosis. Introduction: Patients with a clinical picture of immune deficiency combined with severe inflammation present significant challenges in diagnosis and treatment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1627, "end": 1639, "text": "1 -9.4 g/dl)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5173, "end": 5176, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest None Declared"}, {"text": "Objectives: Description of the phenotype and treatment of a patient with immune deficiency combined with severe hyperinflammation. Methods: We have investigated a boy of non-consanguineous parents of Middle East origin, with extended immunologic and genetic studies.. Results: The boy was born after an uncomplicated pregnancy at 36 +6 wks.At two wks of age he developed problems moving his right leg. Osteomyelitis was suspected but never confirmed. At admission he had an unspecific skin rash, pancytopenia and very high inflammatory markers He then developed periodic fever, near-fatal episodes of enterocolitis and reoccurent macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). The boy also suffered different suspected and confirmed infections (Enterococcus coli and Enterococcus faecalis) requiring broad-spectrum antibiotics and ICU admission.The immunological work-up initially showed very high levels ofIL-18 (55,000) but normal levels of IFN-gamma. It also showed showed initially low peripheral blood T-and B-cell as well as NK-cell numbers. T-cells and NK-cells were gradually improving when the hyperinflammation was under control, however the B-cells remained low.Both the CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes showed a normal response to stimulation with mitogen and superantigen with FASCIA. Clinical features suggested hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) or NLRC4 which led to a rapid examination of functional studies and the most common genes for these syndromes, which were absent. Whole genome sequencing was performed and analyzed for genes linked to primary immune deficiencies and autoinflammatory conditions, but no genetic alterations linked to the phenotype were found. Treating the reoccuring infections and the hyperinflammation was a balancing act. Supportive care included regular transfusions of erythrocytes and platelelts as well as total parenteral nutrition.Steroid pulses were initially given to reduce hyperinflammation, followed by peroral dexamethasone and then high-dose Anakinra(10 mg/kg/ day).As the dose was lowered hyperinflammation reoccured. Unfortunately neutropenia, a side effect of Anakinra, developed. This was controlled by the addition of colony stimuli factor. The hyperinflammation slowly improved (over months), although an infection triggered a further life-threatning relapse. Due to his severe phenotype a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was considered necessary, with cord blood as the stem cell source. His condition was initially stable with a complete donor-chimerism, but he later developed a severe thrombocytopenia secondary to immune suppression. Consequently, the immune suppression was stopped at approximately eight months following transplantation, with a marked improvement of the thrombocytes. Unfortunately however he then developed suspected severe GVHD of the skin and a myopathy. This is currently being treated with methotrexate and Etanercept. Conclusion: During recent years the progress in immunological phenotyping and genetic investigations have improved tremendously, requiring close collaboration between physicians, clinical immunologists and molecular biologists. However, there are still patients where a specific genetic diagnosis cannot be established, making the choice of treatment difficult. In this case a boy with a severe phenotype of immune deficiency and relapsing hyperinflammation was cured with an HSCT. Introduction: We report two cases of 2-years old twins with periodic fever. They were born at 36 weeks of gestational age after pregnancy with donor oocytes in-vitro fertilization (IVF). The patient came to our attention at 1 year of life due to recurrent episodes characterized by high fever (39-40\u00b0C) for 3-4 days, associated with bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, diarrhea, not constantly morbilliform rash. Laboratory findings, during these episodes, included leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and elevated C-reactive protein. Our patients were generally well between attacks. Regarding their past clinical history: at first months of life they underwent to intervention foranal fistula, discovered on neonatal period. They suffered also from recurrent wheezing since the introduction in the nursery. They presented optimal growth and good psychomotor development. Results: We performed immunological workup that evidenced elevated levels of immunoglobulin D (P1: 150 mg/L and P2 250mg/L, normal values 5-120mg/L) and serum amyloid A (P1 124 mg/L and P2 89 mg/L; normal values < 6.4 mg/L), normal immunephenotyping, with normal lymphocyte T and NK function. We performed analysis of the MVK gene and we identified two known 1 missense compound heterozygous mutations: c.803T > C (p.I268T) and c.1129G > A (p.V377I). In particular, p.I268Tis described in homozygosity in a patient who died at 4.5 months of age. Moreover, other authors, demonstrated in fibroblast-derived lysates of patients with the same mutation, markedly reduced or absent mevalonate kinase activity and in vitro studies they demonstrated dramatically reduced enzyme activity of the mutant protein. These data indicate that the p.I268T mutation markedly affects enzyme stability and activity [2] [3] [4] . In 2016, the same genotype p.V377I /p.I268T was described in 25 patients of a cohort of 114 patients (21%) from the Eurofever Register 5 . The study demonstrated statistically significance between patients with p.V377I/p.I268T versus all other genotypes for amyloidosis developing (p 0.049). At the same time, for the history of perinatal anal fistula and recurrent inflammatory attacks, despite no complete criteria for HLH (Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis), knowns FHL (Familial Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis) genes and SH2D1A and XIAP genes were sequenced and a known hemizygous mutation c.1408A>T (p.T470S) was revealed on XIAP gene (chromosome X). Evidently, it was no possible to demonstrate hereditary of this mutation, because maternal DNA was not available. This mutation is a known missense mutation with very low frequency (reported with frequency <1% in HGMD) and previously reported as causative of XLP2 6 (X-linked lymphoproliferative disease 2) and very early onset Crohn's disease (VEOIBD) 7 . Cytofluorimetric and western blotting analysis showed good expression of XIAP protein in our patients. No others functional analysis was performed, until now. After initial treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids given during attacks, therapy was switched to colchicine without clinical success. Conclusion: On the basis of frequent association between their MVK genotype and amyloidosis (16% of patients) 5 , and persistent high levels of serum amyloid A (mean values: P1 261mg/L and P2 120mg/ L) we decide to start with IL-1 inhibitor (Anakinra) that based on limited literature data, appeared to improve symptoms and could induce complete remission in patients with MKD. Moreover, studies are ongoing to test the response to IL-1 inhibitor in lymphoproliferative disease. The coexistence of mutations of different autoinflammatory syndromes in our patients has been reported very rarely, and its implications are not totally clear, but they include atypical clinical manifestations with a variable response to treatment. Introduction: The interest of the professional community in autoinflammatory diseases (AID) is growing worldwide. Diagnosis of AID began to be made more often. It must be remembered that AID is a diagnosis of exclusion of other conditions with a similar clinical picture, including oncological pathology. Objectives: To present the observation of oncological disease in a child with suspected AID. Methods: Clinicalcase of a 5-year-old girl who entered the Federalrheumatological center in April 2018 to exclude AID. Complaints at admission were periodic fever 38.5 lasting 6-7 days, abdominal pain, increased posterior cervical lymph nodes, sometimes tonsillitis attacks, arthralgia, weakness, fatigue. Patient was examined according to the standard program of the patient with systemic juvenile arthritis (soJIA). Infectious diseases were excluded. X-ray examination and radioisotope skeleton scintigraphy, bone marrow biopsy, molecular genetic analysis using automatic sequencing for mutations in the NLRP3 and TNFRSF1A genes in hot points were performed. Results: The family history of AID is not burdened. The patient is sick from 4 years (from February 2017). In the onset of disease -febrile fever, pain in the cervical spine, cervical lymphadenopathy. After 2 months arthralgia of the knee, synovitis of the hip, claudication appeared. On examination, it was an increase of acute phase markers, anemia. At the initial examination infections, tuberculosis were excluded, on abdominal CT -an increase in para-aortic lymph nodes, radioisotope scintigraphy of the skeleton without pathologicalfeatures. According to bone marrow biopsy, there is no data for hematologic disease. Diagnosis: soJIA. Treatment: NSAIDs, against the background of which the pain in the joints stopped. From the 5th month of the disease was in the form of monthly febrile fevers, lasting 6-7 days, accompanied by hyperemia of the pharynx and raid on the tonsils, spotty rashes, enlarged cervical lymph nodes, abdominal pain, pain in the knee. ESR 59 mm/h, Hb-96 g /l, CRP-43.8 mg/l, WBC-7.3\u044510 9 /l . During hospitalization in the rheumatological center in April 2018 there were febrile fever, weight loss, intoxication (weakness, lethargy, moodiness), generalized lymphadenopathy, liver enlargement, arthritis of the left hip joint, Hb 92 g /l, ESR 48 mm/h, CRP 30 mg/l. There were no pathogenic mutations in the NLRP3 and TNFRSF1A genes. On the X-ray of the pelvis and scintigraphy -multiple lesions in the bones. Sent for re-examination by an oncologist. The increase in the level of the tumor marker of a neuron-specific enolase detected during additional examination, the results of the femur biopsy confirmed the diagnosis: low differentiated neuroblastoma without primary focus, 4 stages with multiple lesions in bones and para-aortic lymph nodes Conclusion: The diagnosis of AID should be considered only after the exclusion of other, more common and severe pathologies. In clinical practice physicians who areworking withpts with an auto-inflammatory phenotype should be aware of possibility of oncological disease.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 5173, "end": 5176, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5177, "end": 5180, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5181, "end": 5184, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "Disclosure of Interest None Declared", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Consent for publication has been obtained from patient Yes"}, {"text": "Coexistence of familial Mediterranean fever with celiac disease in armenian patient (case report) Hasmik Sargsyan Pediatrics N2, Yerevan State Medical University, Yerevan, Armenia Pediatric Rheumatology 2019, 17(Suppl 1):P2112 Introduction: Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is autosome-recessive inherited disorder, particularly frequent around the Mediterranean basin. FMF shows a marked ethnic distribution; it is most frequently observed in Armenian, Jewish, Turkish and Arabic communities. In general, FMF is characterized by recurrent episodes of fever, associated with serositis. Celiac disease (CD) known as gluten enteropathy is immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the small intestine caused by gluten sensitivity in genetically predisposed people. The most common symptoms of CD are chronic diarrhea, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal distention and pain. However, both of the diseases share some common clinical features and sometimes, both of the diseases are associated with many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. It is necessary to mention, that there are some cases of FMF with CD in the literature. Objectives: We present FMF patient coexistence of CD. Despite the high level of FMF in Armenia, this is the first case of these two disorders.Methods: Clinical and laboratory findings are presented. Results: 14 years old boy admitted to the \"Arabkir\" Medical Center with complains of: fever, recurrent abdominal pain, chest pain, arthritis of knee and ankle, sometimes nausea, vomiting, irregular stool. Manifestation of disease began from the four years old. The attack was 3-5 times per month each lasting typically for 3-4 days. There is a family history of FMF: sister and brother have FMF (with M694V/ M694V mutation). Physical examination revealed M-46, P-168, BMI-16,31, paleness, low muscular tone, enlargement of the spleen.Some investigations as a IgA, IgM, IgG, C3, C4, ASLO, RF, PT, serological tests for viral or bacterial infections were negative, kidney and liver tests also without any abnormalities. The inflammation markers were positive (CRP 176.11(N<5mg/dl), ESR 25mm/h, ferritin 101.27(30-300ng/ml). Chest X-ray revealed exudates in the costophrenic angle from the two sites, EchoCGaseptic pericarditis, ultrasound of abdomensplenomegaly and fluid in abdomen. The vitaminD were checked. Specific markers of CD (T-TG IgA 92.6(N<10), HLA DQ2, HLA DQ8, EMA IgA) was positive. Duodenum biopsy was revealed Marsh Type III. Genetic investigation of MEFV discovered M694V/M694V mutation. We established the diagnosis of FMF and CD at the same time rule out other diseases (endocrine, autoimmune, ets.). It was started the treatment with colchicine 1mg/day and gluten-free diet. Conclusion: This is a family case of FMF, one of the member has a CD.It is necessary to continue investigations the siblings in the field of CD. Not excluded, that should be revealed some factors which can confirm familial form of CD in this family. However, for the understanding relationship between CD and FMF should be further studies with more patients for a providing precise interpretation. Introduction: New technologies such as NGS enable elucidation of genetic cause in patients with primary immunodeficiencies with complex, atypical or ambiguous presentation. Here we present a patient with a complicated clinical picture characterized by severe bcgitis in the neonatal and infant age, followed later by manifestations of autoinflammation characterized by generalized skin lesions, lymphoproliferation, recurrent erythema nodosum, joint involvement and bone lesions. Objectives: NGS and testing of immune function in an effort to precise diagnosis and set personalized therapy. Methods: NGS was performed by Illumina-based technology, functional assays included complex immune profiling, analysis of signalling pathways and cytokine response after stimulation by IFNg (due to IFNGR1) and muramyl dipeptide (MDP) (in a context with NOD2 mutation). To verify the effect of the therapy functional tests were repeated after initiation of Methotrexate treatment. Results: In the patient, mutations in IFNGR1 and NOD2/CARD15 genes were detected simultaneously bearing an increased susceptibility to mycobacterial infections and NOD2 associated Blau syndrom. The patient's cellular phenotype correlated with known features of partial IFNGR1 deficiency, a marked overexpression of surface IFNGR1, decreased IFN\u03b3-induced STAT1 phosphorylation, overproduction of IFN\u03b3 by T cells upon stimulation, significantly decreased IL-12p70 production by PBMCs upon IFN\u03b3 and LPS costimulation and a reduction of expresion of STAT1-inducible genes, CXCL10 and IRF1. The functional property of the NOD2 mutation indicated an enhanced basal NF\u03baB activation, MAPK phosphorylation and expression of transcription factors c-Jun and c-Fos. The stimulation with MDP resulted in further increase of NF\u03baB activation, but only minimal increase in MAPK phosphorylation. Interestingly, treatment with methotrexate alone almost completely resolved the inflammatory symptoms. This was paralleled with suppression of untreated and MDP-induced NF\u03baB activation, MAPK activation and MDP-induced and simultaneous IFN\u03b3 and MDP-induced production of cytokines. Conclusion: We present here the patient with a dominant autoinflammatory phenotype consistent with NOD2 related Blau syndrome, influenced by a simultaneous immune deficiency based on IFNGR1 mutation. Based on the results of functional testing we hypothesize that both mutations exhibit certain mutual alteration. While the NOD2-derived proinflammatory bias may decrease the susceptibility to mycobacterial infections associated with IFNGR1 deficiency, the strongly Th1-polarized immune system may accentuate the inflammatory responses via IFN\u03b3-driven priming of NOD2-mutated cells, reflecting in the patient's severe granulomatous disease. We also show significat effect of methotrexate chosen to influence granulomatous inflammation in a situation when antiTNF treatment could not be used due to an increased susceptibility to Mycobacteria.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P2112"}, {"text": "Introduction: We present the case of a 3 years old Romanian healthy boy who developed a relapsing-remitting multifocal encephalomyelopathy and episodic pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly and fever. Objectives: Our patient had a physiological and a remote pathological anamnesis mute up to 3 years of age. He was the first-born of non consanguineus parents. He appeared as an healthy child with very light hairand skin. After some day of a flu-like syndrome,he showed systemic symptoms (fever, pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly) and then developed neurological symptoms consisting of focal epilepsy, cerebellar signs, right hemiparesis. Systemic and neurological symptoms were responsive to steroids. After a short period of well being, he had two more episodes of worsening of neurological symptoms. A few months later, during steroid and antiepileptic therapy, he developeda rightnon-convulsive status epilepticusand then a contralateral one. Methods: Neurological symptoms werein temporal correlation with the appearance ofmultifocal extensive lesions of the white matter in brain andcervical cord, with enhancement. The CSF investigations showed a mild protein elevation. Brain biopsy was compatible with non-specific findings suggestive of inflammatory pathology. We made further investigations in order to exclude infective, metabolic, autoimmune or autoinflammatory diseases . The strong diagnostic suspicion in the context of pathologies that could secondarily be associated with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis induced a deepening in specific immunodeficiencies. Results: We identified a mutation in Rab27a in homozygosity responsible for the type II Griscelli syndrome. Conclusion: Griscelli Syndrome Type 2 (GS-2) is caused by mutations in RAB27A gene and is associated with immunological dysfunction without primary neurological impairment. The cytotoxic defect caused by RAB27A mutations is responsible for triggering the hemophagocytic syndrome characterized by acute onset of uncontrolled T-lymphocyte and macrophage activation. Neurological symptoms in GS-2 may be due to infiltration of brain by the activated hematopoietic cells (1) . A relapsing-remitting course is not typical for GS-2. We can't demonstrate a sure hemophagocytic syndrome (ferritin was always normal) but we had episodic pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly and fever responsive to steroid. Unfortunately, although the genetic defect was identified, the child's general condition was too compromised to carry out a stem cell transplant and medical therapy proved ineffective; after a long period of medicaltreatment the patient died. This case showes the importance to not avoid to consider rare conditions even with atypical manifestations. Introduction: We present the case of a 15 years old girl who was admitted to our hospital for acute lower limb flaccid paralysis. Results: Physical examination revealed marked and diffuse livedo reticularis. Neurologic exam showed peripheral deficit of the VII cranial nerve, motor activity at lower limbs was absent with sensitive deficit. She underwent a brain and spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showing multiple areas of signal abnormalities (T2 hyperintensity) in both thalamus and basal ganglia, small area in the spinal cord at C2-C3, at D10-D11 and L1 levels; these images were related to vascular damage. Blood exams showed high blood counts and high inflammatory markers (PCR 16.76 mg/dl). Coagulation was normal, antiphospholipid and antinuclear antibodies were negative, immunological work-up showed normal immunoglobulins level, T and B phenotype. She started intravenous steroid and received high dose intravenous immunoglobulin in 4 days. The constellation of findings led to clinical suspicion for adenosine deaminase 2 (ADA2) deficiency (DADA2), which was confirmed by low plasma ADA2 activity. For the presence of microhematuria, worsening proteinuria and hypertension, vascular ultrasound was performed with no evidence of renal artery stenosis. She underwent renal biopsy negative for glomerulonephritis, renal vasculitis and amyloidosis. Following the diagnosis of DADA2, she was initiated on etanercept 50 mg once weekly and she was able to switch from intravenous to oral prednisone and to start its tapering with normalization of inflammatory markers and improvement of skin rash. She underwent an intensive daily rehabilitation training with improvement in the trunk stability but without recovery of the leg paralysis. The girl is the second of 3 children, born from consanguineous parents (first grade cousin) of Italian origin. By the age of 1 she started suffering from fever, arthritis, pericarditis with elevation of inflammatory markers and was diagnosed with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA). At that time, she already presented livedo reticularis and chronic disease anemia. She was treated with short term oral steroid first and later with methotrexate with remission of fever and articular symptoms. She presented speech delay. At the age of 2 presented a convulsive crisis. Polysomnography and brain MRI were negative. One year later she presented a convulsive status epilepticus, brain MRI was repeated and resulted negative. She was started on topiramate with no further crisis, treatment was stopped 2 years later. When she was 9, she was admitted for pancytopenia and she was diagnosed of Leishmania infection. The two siblings of the girl were tested for plasma ADA2 activity and both resulted deficient. The boy is a 12 years old boy with mild development delay and a previous diagnosis of sJIA at the age of 5. He was treated with steroid and Methotrexate with remission. The older sister is now 19 years old and she had an episode of erythema nodosum. Genetic testing of all the family members is still pending. In 2014, two independent groups, Zhou et al. and Navon-Elkan et Fever and knee joint pain disappeared at first with pulse corticosteroid (CS) treatment. Until July 2016, he received treatment with 6 CS pulses, low-dose oral CS daily and methotrexate (MTX).However, with CS dose reduction subfebrility and erythema nodosum-like (EN-like) lesions appeared periodically. Skin biopsy showed nonspecific changes. During July and August 2017, the boy had febrile temperature every other day when CS were not given and experienced aphthous stomatitis (possibly MTX-related). The patient became CS dependent. He had recurrent elevated temperature, fatigue, headache, abdominal pain, EN-like lesions.Secondary osteoporosis with vertebral compression fractures was diagnosed. Repeated skin biopsy showed undifferentiated panniculitis. Weber-Christian disease was excluded. Laboratory tests showed Serum Amyloid A 138 mg/L (N <6.4).The diagnosis of Still's disease was reconsidered. Genetic tests for 50 autoinflammatory genes and NOD2 gene were negative. Urinalysis showed normal mevalonic acid level. Treatment with Azathioprine 2 mg/kg and Plaquenil 200 mg once daily was started without significant response. In December he had a fever with CRP 99 mg/L, without signs of infection and CRP normalization without a/b therapy, with an episode of EN-like eruptions with non-specific panniculitis in histologic examination. BMBx remained normal. Cyclosporin A 3 mg/kg was initiated and condition improved slightly. In May 2018 Anakinra 100 mg/day was started, with good response: no recurrent episodes of fever, inflammatory marker values normalized, EN-like lesions appeared periodically.Results: The boy presented with uSAID, with a time of 4 years to diagnosis, with the initial diagnosis of systemic JIA. The results of genetic testing were negative. The disease was only partially controlled by or unresponsive to DMARDs and steroid treatment. Good response was achieved with IL-1 blocker.Conclusion: 1. USAID should be considered in the differential diagnostics of systemic JIA. 2. Genetic testing must be performed in patients presented with a range of nonspecific autoinflammatory symptoms. 3. We conclude that Anakinra seems a feasible treatment option for uSAID. Introduction: Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is an autoinflammatory disease characterized by recurrent fever,peritonitis,pleuritis or arthritis attacks.The main treatment of FMF is daily oral colchicine treatment. There is strong evidence that colchicine inhibits both acute inflammatory attacks of FMF and systemic amyloidosis.We aimed to report the response of a 2-year-old patient with colchicine-resistant FMF to the treatment of Etanercept.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2146, "end": 2149, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5835, "end": 5865, "text": "Zhou et al. and Navon-Elkan et", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest None Declared"}, {"text": "Objectives: A two-year-old girl complained of recurrent fever one year ago. R202Q heterozygote positivity was determined in the gene analysis and colchicine 0.5mg / day was started with the diagnosis of FMF. Although the patient received this treatment regularly, she had fever and abdominal pain attacks for the last 4 months and her attacks started to increase day by day. She lost appetite and weight loss. The older brother had FMF in his family history. Physical Examination: height: 89,5cm, weight: 11,5kg, Fever: 38 degrees, abdominal sensitivity was present, there was no arthritis and rash. In laboratory tests; Sedimentation: 31mm/ h, C-reactive protein: 65mg / L, Fibrinogen: 4.27g / L. The patient was treated with colchicine 1mg / day, ibuprofen 200mg / day and prednisolone 5mg / day. Four weeks later, the patient complained of abdominal pain, fever, loss of appetite and weight loss. The frequency of attacks was not decreased. Methods: The patient who was treated with subcutaneous Etanercept at 0.8mg / kg / week with the diagnosis of colchicineresistant FMF, had no abdominal attacks and fever episodes. Results: After 6 weeks there was no attack and sedimentation, CRP and fibrinogen levels decreased to normal limits.

Exudative erythemas developed on his face and extremities 2 weeks after birth. At 1 month of age, the patient developed fever with elevated serum C-reactive protein and hepatic amino transferase levels. A febrile convulsion with basal ganglia calcification appeared at 4 months. At 7 months of age, severe pulmonary arterial hypertension was diagnosed. He periodically developed erythema and myositis with elevated serum creatine kinase level. Anti-nuclear antibodies were negative. His symptoms were improved with corticosteroid but recurred periodically. Portal hypertension with hepatosplenomegaly was diagnosed at 6 years of age. Although Nakajo-Nishimura syndrome (NNS) was suspected, lipomuscular atrophy has never been developed. This case was once reported in 8 th ISSAID, but we additionally present the case with the recent disease course and new findings, especially the aspects of immunodeficiency.Objectives: To identify the responsive gene mutation(s) in this patient and to clarify his phenotypic difference from NNS. Methods: Sequencing a panel of genes causing known autoinflammatory syndromes and whole exome sequencing of the patient and his parents were performed using the next generation sequencer. Expression of proteasomeal subunits and ubiquitinated protein was analyzed by western blotting and immunostaining. Proteasomal activities were also analyzed. Serum TREC/KREC levels were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Results: No significant mutation had been detected in a panel of genes causing autoinflammatory syndromes including PSMB8, while whole exome sequencing of the patient and his parents identified a novel de novo heterozygous PSMB9 mutation in the patient. Among proteasome-associated genes, a rare polymorphism in PSMD9 has additionally been detected in the patient and his father. By analysis of the patient-derived cells, disrupted assembly and maturation of the immunoproteasome similar to NNS, but relatively intact catalytic activities without apparent accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in contrast to NNS, were observed. Blood analysis showed not only increase of monocytes but also decrease of B cells. A TREC level as well as a KREC level decrease significantly. Notably, serum IgG levels were decreased (less than 500 mg/dL) and IgG supplementation was required every week and efficient as treatment. These facts suggest that humoral immunity was severely impaired. Conclusion: Thus, our case manifested not only autoinflammation but also immunodeficiency, which is resembling but distinct from NNS.

Several responsible genes of type I interferonopathy including not only the 7 causative genes of Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome but also TMEM173(STING) and the genes associated with proteasome such as PSMB8had been reported. Additionally, patients with heterozygous truncated mutation of POMPhad both type I interferonopathy and combined immunodeficiency. More recently, it was shown that the model mice with STING-gain-of-function mutation had combined innate and adaptive immunodeficiency and virus-induced pulmonary fibrosis. In this situation, we found a patient with a mutation of PSMB9 (also called \u03b21i), which is the major component of immunoproteasome.Objectives: In this study, we present the clinical symptoms and the results of in vitro analysis of a novel identified patient who showed the very early onset severe inflammatory phenotype caused by PSMB9mutation in Japan.Methods: The patient is one-month-old male infant. He showed the characteristic phenotypes which included severe skin eruption like chilblain, myositis, hepatitis, pneumonia, pulmonary hypertension, pancytopenia, the increase of inflammatory reactants, the elevated serum ferritin, the increase of protein concentration of the central spinal fluid (CSF), and intracranial calcification. The detailed immunological patterns were evaluated and the gene panel including the known autoinflammatory syndrome was analyzed using next-generation gene sequencer. The trio-based whole exome sequence was also performed as the additional analysis. His dermal fibroblast was established, and the immunoproteasome activity, immunoproteasome assembly analyzed by western blotting of fractionated protein and the cytokine production level were analyzed. The reporter gene activity was analyzed using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system. Results: By the ex vivo analysis using the patient's peripheral blood, several abnormal patterns were detected. In the lymphocyte subset analysis, CD8, \u03b3\u03b4T and NK cells were decreased. NK cell activity was also decreased. IFN-\u03b1 was increased in his serum and CSF. IFN signature of his peripheral blood was also enhanced. Interestingly, in his serum polyoma virus was detected continuously. The gene panel analysis revealed the de novo mutation of PSMB9. This mutation was located on the dimer interface between PSMB9 proteins in the complex structure of immunoproteasome. No other known pathogenic gene was identified by whole exome analysis. Furthermore, the retain of premature form of PSMB9 protein, the accumulation of UMP1 and the decreased activity of IFN-\u03b3 induced 20S proteasome were shown using his dermal fibroblast. The decrease of production level of IL-6 from TNF-\u03b1 stimulated his fibroblast was shown. The decreased NF-\u03baB reporter gene activity was shown in the PSMB9mutation transfected HEK293T cells.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest None Declared"}, {"text": "The identified genotype is same with the previously reported mutation in 8th ISSAID by Kinjo N et al. and their clinical phenotypes were quite similar. Thus, we hypothesized that this PSMB9mutation caused the early onset immunodeficiency leading the virus infection and this might trigger the type I interferonopathy. We proposed that this disease is designated as \"Proteasome-associated autoinflammation and immunodeficiency disease (PRAID)\" including POMP and PSMB9 mutationrelated diseases. Introduction: Inflammation is activated prior to symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases, providing a plausible pathogenic mechanism. Indeed genetic and pharmacological ablation studies in animal models of several neurodegenerative diseases demonstrate that inflammation is required for pathology. Objectives: However, while there is growing evidence that inflammation-mediated pathology may be the common mechanism underlying neurodegenerative diseases, including those due to dominantly inherited expanded repeats, the proximal causal agent is unknown. Methods: We have utilized Drosophila genetics to explore the ability of various forms of expanded repeat RNA to cause pathology and genetically dissect the responsible pathway.Results: Expanded CAG.CUG repeat double stranded RNA causes inflammation-mediated pathology when expressed in Drosophila. Repeat dsRNA is recognised by Dicer2 as a foreign or 'non-self' molecule triggering both antiviral RNA and RNAi pathways. Neither of the RNAi pathway cofactors R2D2 nor loquacious are necessary, indicating antiviral activation. RNA modification enables avoidance of recognition as 'non-self' by the innate inflammatory surveillance system. Human ADAR1 edits RNA conferring 'self' status and when coexpressed with expanded CAG.CUG dsRNA in Drosophila the pathology is lost. Cricket Paralysis Virus protein CrPV-1A is a known antagonist of Argonaute2 in Drosophila antiviral defence. CrPV-1A coexpression also rescues pathogenesis, confirming anti-viral-RNA response.Conclusion: Repeat expansion mutation therefore confers 'non-self' recognition of endogenous RNA, thereby providing a proximal, autoinflammatory trigger for expanded repeat neurodegenerative diseases.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion:"}, {"text": "I have a possible gene or a strange phenotype.Looking for a second case Introduction: Awareness of autoinflammatory disorders is allowing the detection of families with phenotypes reminiscent of known monogenic defects but lacking genetic confirmation. We describe three patients from a family of Italian ancestry with autoinflammatory phenotype. Exome sequencing didn't allow the detection of any mutation in genes associated with autoinflammatory syndromes but held complex results supportive of a possible digenic disorder. Objectives: Describe clinical and genetic features of the family, and to hypothesize treatments targeted to mechanisms likely involved in the disease pathogenesis. Methods: Whole exome sequencing was performed in patient 1, 2, 3 and mother of patient 1. Mutations found were analysed by Sanger sequencing. IFN signature and flow-cytometric assessment of TBK1 phosphorylation was analysed in all the family. Results: Patient (pt) 1, a 2 years old girl, presented urticarial rash since 2 months of age, sometimes aggravated by cold. No history of recurrent fever or abnormal physical and neurological development was reported. Pt 2, her 40 years old father, presented analogues cutaneous lesion associated by sporadic episodes of polyarthritis starting later in childhood compared to his daughter, sometimes treated with prednisone with partial remission of symptoms. Pt 3, the 42 years old uncle, presented episodic fever of unknown origin associated to polyarthritis and urticarial starting during childhood. Corticosteroid therapy did not prevent a severe progression of the disease characterized by cutaneous ulcers and small articulation deforming polyarthritis evolving to erosion of the nasal bridge, deformity of hands and fingers, auto amputation of toes. All three patients present evidence of baseline systemic inflammation with elevations of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. A twin brother and the mother were completely asymptomatic. Whole exome sequencing was performed in pt 1, 2, 3 and mother of pt 1. Two mutations in two candidate genes were found in pt 1, 2 and 3: ZC3H12D and MB21D1. The first is a new heterozygous c.C564A variation in the ZC3H12D gene (stop-gain mutation), coding for a Zn-finger protein involved in the IL-6 mRNA degradation. The second one is a heterozygous c.A948G variation in the MB21D1 gene, encoding the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS, one of the main trigger of type I interferon (IFN) production. This variant is already described but no frequency data are reported and is predicted as damaging by different bioinformatic tools. These two mutations were afterwards analysed in twin brother of patient 1 by Sanger sequencing, revealing the presence of only the heterozygous c.C564A variation in ZC3H12D. None of the two mutation were found in mother. Except for mother, all components of the family showed an intermediate interferon signature, suggesting a possible involvement of the type I IFN inflammation. Despite the role of the two candidate genes, and the result of IFN signature, the flow-cytometric assessment of the TBK1 kinase phosphorylation didn't reveal a significant increase of the IFN pathway activation, even after LPS stimulation. Conclusion: This family shows a clinical phenotype of variable severity, not definitely explained by genetic mutation found. The fact that the uncle phenotype is similar to SAVI syndrome is coherent with the possible involvement of dysregulated cGAS pathway in the pathogenesis of inflammation. Further analysis are required to clarify the role of candidate genes to provide a suitable pharmacological approach.Consent for publication has been obtained from patient Yes", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest None Declared"}, {"text": "None Declared", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disclosure of Interest"}, {"text": "New ATM variants and a rare association of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and ataxia-telangiectasia: coincidence or relationship?

Introduction: Monogenic autoinflammatory disorders are a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by innate immune dysregulation that typically present in early childhood with fever, rashes, and disease-specific patterns of organ inflammation. The genetic mutations leading to autoinflammatory phenotypes affect pathways the innate immune responses. Nuclear localization leucine-rich-repeat protein 1 (NLRP1) play role regulator of the innate immune system. The NLRP1 inflammasome promotes caspase-1, resulting in IL-1\u03b2 secretion.Objectives: We present a patient with a periodic fever who was detected the NLRP1 gene mutation. Methods: The genetic analysis was performed at Ege University, Department of Molecular Genetics. The informed consent form for the publication was obtained from patient and her parents.Results: A 7-year-old girl was admitted with recurrent fever to our rheumatology clinic. Her complaints firstly started in 4-year-old and recurred with a monthly. There were enuresis and dysuria in some of the fever periods and she was treated as urinary tract infection. But there were no positive urine cultures at any time. Urinary ultrasonography and renal cortical scintigraphy were normal. In 5-year-old, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy were performed because of presented tonsillitis in fever attacks and repeated after two years. After these surgeries, the fever was not present in 3 months. But then periodic fever was present again. She had pneumonia at once. In apart of these fever periods, she had the normal physical examination findings. Any rash, arthritis, lymphadenitis, and periorbital edema were not detected. There was no complaint of abdominal pain, diarrhea or myalgia in attacks. She has no remarkable family history. In laboratory examinations in fever attacks, complete blood count and urine analysis were normal, CRP, ESR and serum amyloid A were increased, throat culture was negative. Level of immunoglobulin G, A, M, E was normal but immunoglobulin D was increased. The increased AFRs was seen in the attack-free period also. We considered that she had an autoinflammatory disease and gave colchicine. After colchicine treatment, AFRs normalized, but the fever attacks continued. The comprehensive genetic panel was performed for autoinflammatory diseases . This genetic panel included NLRP3, NLRC4, IL1RN, PSMB8,  TNFRSF1A, MVK, PSTPIP1, MEFV, NOD2, PLCG2, NLRP1, CARD8, NLRP12,  CARD14, CECR1, TNFRSF11A, TMEM173, TNFAIP3, LACC1, OTULIN,  IL23R, TREX1, IL12RB1 , PRF1, DNASE1, UNC13D, STX11, STXBP2, USP43, RIPK1. M1184V mutation was detected in the NLRP1 gene. Conclusion: M1184V is a polymorphism in NLRP1. In one study was shown that M1184V exhibited caspase-1 activation and IL-1\u03b2 secretion. However, this polymorphism was presented in 25% of the population without causing any pathological manifestation.
