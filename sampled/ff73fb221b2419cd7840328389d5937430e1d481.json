The aim of our study was to assess TRM and the reliability of this score in AML elderly patients undergoing Autologous Transplant. We have treated 101 elderly AML patients aged over 60 years, diagnosed between june 1999 and September 2009. All patients received an induction and consolidation treatment including HD-ARA-C and Idarubicin, with a 30% reduction dose in over 70 years patients; those obtaining a successful mobilization (CD34 + cell > 3 \u00d7 10 6 /kg) underwent Autologous Transplant, 12 after Busulfan plus Melfalan (BUMEL) and 9 after BEAM conditioning. The remaining patients received alternative consolidation treatment. We obtained a 71% CR, 49 patients were in CCR and eligible to a second consolidation; 21 of these (43%) obtained a successful CD34 mobilization and underwent Autologous Transplant. Six patients had a HCT-CI 0 score, 11 had a score between 1 and 2, 4 patients had a > 3 score. One of the latter patients had a previous cancer, 2 had an heart valve disease and 1 had diabetes, peptic ulcer requiring treatments and previous severe infectious complications. Five out 21 patients died of transplant, with a 25% cumulative 1-year TRM incidence. Surprisingly no patients with a > 3 HCT-CI score died, vs. one patient in the 1-2 score group (9%) and 4 patients in the 0 score group (67%) (P = 0.02). Age < and > 70 years did not affect the TRM rate, but all the fi ve deaths occurred after the administration of Busulfan plus Melfalan (BUMEL) with an higher TRM rate in this group (42%, P = 0.04) in comparison with the patients receiving BEAM. In our small series all 6 patients with a 0 HCT-CI score received BUMEL as conditioning (P = 0.01), suggesting that the higher TRM rate in this group might be related to the administration of a more toxic conditioning regimen. Elderly patients generally have several comorbidities and HCT-CI score might be an insuffi cient tool in assessing their frailty. The high TRM rate in elderly AML patients suggests that some of these patients should receive less toxic conditioning or alternative consolidation regimen. Larger retrospective and multicentric studies are therefore needed in order to better validate this score in this setting.",

Bornh\u00e4user, S. Parmentier, M. Wermke, M. Schaich, U. Platzbecker, C. R\u00f6llig, G. Ehninger, J. Schetelig University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus (Dresden, DE) Introduction: The hematopoietic cell transplantation specifi c comorbidity index (HCT-CI) has been proposed to predict nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and overall survival (OS) in allogeneic HCT recipients. We performed a retrospective study at our center to investigate its capacity in predicting the outcome in comparison with well defi ned disease-specifi c risk factors. Methods: We reviewed the records of 340 patients with AML who underwent allogeneic HCT at our institution between January 2000 and December 2008. Pretransplant comorbidities were assessed by review of medical charts and computer database system. For each patient we assessed the Karnofsky performance score and calculated the HCT-CI as defi ned by Sorror et al. (2005). Cox regression modeling was applied for the endpoint overall survival (OS). Non-relapse mortality (NRM) was analysed using univariate and multivariate competing events statistics. Results: The median age at HCT was 53 years (range, 11 to 76). 133 patients had received myeloablative and 207 nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens. Donors were matched siblings in 116 and alternative donors in 224 patients. Twenty-fi ve percent patients were in fi rst complete remission of standard risk AML. HCT-CI risk was low in 6%, intermediate in 20%, and high in 74% of the patients. Overall survival at 3 years was 29%, 40%, and 44% (P = 0.7) and NRM was 34%, 32%, and 26% (P = 0.6), in the low, intermediate and high-risk HCT-CI groups, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the HCT-CI failed to predict OS and NRM. A reason for this could be, that patients with low comorbidity scores were very rare in this cohort. In part this was due to the high incidence of \"heart valve disease\" in our cohort, defi ned in the HCT-CI as any kind of valvular disease except for mitral valve prolapse. Heart valve disease qualifi es on its own for a high HCT-CI score. In the original publication by Sorror the incidence was 2%. Prior to HCT 45% of our patients had mostly trace to mild valvular regurgitation, and thus had a high HCT-CI score. This compares to an incidence of 35% valvular regurgitation in the healthy population (Framingham Heart Study) and may therefore not be overestimated. Ambiguous defi nitions could therefore limit the applicability of the HCT-CI. Conclusion: In conclusion, in high risk AML patients the HCT-CI was not associated with NRM or OS in a cohort of predominantly high risk AML patients. Refi ned defi nitions might improve the performance of the index.",

(Lancet 352, 1998). Results: Of the 225 pts., 30 (13%) had an EBMT risk-score of 0-1, 48 (21%) had a score of 2, 49 (22%) had a score of 3, 38 (17%) had a score of 4, 47 (21%) had a score of 5, and 14 (6%) had a score of 6-7. At ten years after alloSCT, OS in the different groups were 68% (score of 0-1), 52% (score of 2), 48% (score of 3), 36% (score of 4), 26% (score of 5), or 28% (score of 6-7) and differed significantly (P = 0.002). Likewise, there was a statistically significant difference in relapse between the score groups ranging from 23% (score of 0-1) to 51% (score of 4) (P = 0.028). In contrast, the EBMT risk score did not predict the NRM in the different subgroups (P = 0.084). However, a significant trend towards a lower NRM in pts. with a low score was noticed (logrank test for trend: P = 0.004). Of note, the EBMT risk-score failed to predict OS, relapse, or NRM in pts. conditioned with RIC (n = 100) whereas it did so in the MAC group. Conclusions: These data indicate that the EBMT risk-score may be used to predict the outcome of pts. with AML following MAC-alloSCT. In pts. conditioned with RIC, the EBMT risk-score did not predict the outcome in our patient cohort.

The Clo and Flu were infused over 1 hr each once daily for 4 days, on each day Bu was given over 3 hr to AUC 6,000 \u03bcMol min. GVHD-prophylaxis was tacrolimus + mini MTX. Recipients of unrelated or one Ag-mism. related donor cells received rabbit-ATG. Results: 24 patients were male, 17 female, median age 45 yrs (range 6-59). 32 had AML (ind. failure: 12, chemo-refr. relapse: 9, untr. relapse: 3, CR2 + CR2p: 6, high-risk CR1 + CR1p: 2 [cytog. -7 and t(3;12)]). 17 of the 32 had intermediate, 15 poor prognosis cytogenetics. 9 had CML (BC: 2, second AP: 3, and late CP 4). 19/41 (46%) had related donors (BM:6, PBPC: 13), and 22 (54%) unrelated (BM:11, PBPC:11). All patients engrafted. Day + 30 T-cell chimerism showed Arms I + II (lower Clo doses) with 85% (range 17-100) donor-derived DNA, while Arms III + IV (higher Clo doses) had 100% (64 100) donor-DNA; by day + 100 all groups had a median of 100% donor-DNA. The adaptive randomization allocated most patients to Arm III, (Clo 30 mg/m 2 , Flu 10 mg/m 2 ), in keeping with in vitro synergy of [Clo + Flu]. 83% (20/24) of patients with active AML and 7 of 9 with CML achieved CR post transplant. Median follow-up is 18 mos (range 6-34), and as of Dec. 11, 2009, one-year OS and EFS are 52% and 41%. There were only 2 treatment-related deaths by day + 100 (5%), one pneumonia, one GVHD. Grade 2-3 mucositis was seen in half the patients, but there was no serious hepatic, renal or neuro-toxicity. We conclude: 1) Clofarabine is immunosuppressive enough for pretransplant therapy, 2) [Clo \u00b1 Flu] + IV Bu is safe and effi cacious conditioning in myeloid leukemia, 3) In vitro synergy of [Clo + Flu] with IV Bu correlated clinically with the adaptive randomization, favoring Arm III (Clo 30 mg/m\u00b2 and Flu 10 mg/m\u00b2). Additional patients and longer follow-up are needed to evaluate combined nucleoside analogs [Clo + Flu] in pretransplant conditioning.",

Among these patients, 98 received transplantation from matched-related donors (MRD) and 38 matched-unrelated donors (MUD). Twentyeight (28.6%) in the MRD and 14 (36.8%) patients in the MUD were high risk diseases (P = 0.349). In vivo-T cell depletion (TCD) (52.7% vs. 6.1%) and tacrolimus for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (44.7% vs. 4.1%) were more commonly used in the MUD than MRD (P < 0.001). The 3-year overall survival (OS) rate (66.0% vs. 62.1%; P = 0.323), the 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse (27.4% vs. 13.6%; P = 0.111) and non-relapse mortality (16.6% vs. 21.6%, P = 0.992) were not different between MRD and MUD group. The incidence of cytomegalovirus reactivation was higher in the MUD (49.8%) than MRD (22.8%; P = 0.005). The 3-year cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD and extensive chronic GVHD was 21.2% vs. 27.8% (P = 0.718) and 13.5% vs. 25.6% (P = 0.040) in MRD and MUD group, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, MUD [hazard ratio (HR) 5.297, 95% confi dence interval (CI) 1.156-24.277; P = 0.032], reduced intensity conditioning (HR 7.318,; P = 0.021), and infused CD34 + stem cells > 6 \u00d7 10 6 /kg (HR 3.906, 95% CI 1.108-13.711; P = 0.031) were identifi ed as risk factors for the development of extensive chronic GVHD in the multivariate analysis. To adjust the white blood cell (WBC) counts on the differentiating capacity of the leukemic clone, WBC index (WBC X marrow blasts%/100) was calculated, and distinguished 3 groups of patients with different outcomes (low, < 1.0; intermediate, 1.0-6.3; high, 6.3 or more). High index showed poor survival compared to the low index (P = 0.038). In conclusion, transplantation outcome was comparable between unrelated and related donors in terms of OS and incidence of relapse in AML.",

Salvage therapy including gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) can induce remission, but allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is the only curative option for this cohort of patients. However, factors predicting the response to GO treatment, especially for patients with complex karyotype, have not yet been defi ned. Here, we present the correlation between response to GO therapy and the presence or absence of HLA-DR15 antigen in a cohort of refractory or relapsed AML patients treated at Hannover Medical School prior to allo-SCT. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated patients with refractory or relapsed AML treated with GO prior to allo-SCT at our center from 2002 until 2009. Patients were divided into two groups: patients who responded to GO (R group; CR, PR, aplasia) and patients who remained refractory (NR group). Results: 26 patients were evaluable for GO response, and 24 patients have proceeded to allo-SCT so far. Both groups were comparable for sex, age, indication for GO (induction failure vs. relapse), patients with de novo AML vs. sAML/ t-AML and high-risk cytogenetics. Indications for GO included induction failure (n = 14, 54%) and relapse (n = 12, 46%). Thirteen patients (50%) responded to GO treatment. Nine (69%) of these were HLA-DR15 positive compared to 1 (8%) in the NR group (P < 0.01). Remarkably, the cumulative dose of GO was higher in the NR group (8 mg/m 2 ) compared to the R group (5 mg/m 2 ). More patients in the R group received a combination of chemotherapy with GO than in the NR group (54% vs. 15%, P = 0.1). Also, patients in the NR group had a median of 2 prior salvage therapies vs. one median salvage course in the R group. Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) is a major complication in patients receiving GO: 6 of the 24 patients (25%) of the transplant cohort developed SOS, 3 in each group. Three out of these 6 patients had a myeloablative conditioning regimen with busulfan. The remaining SCT patients received different reduced intensity conditioning regimens (67% FLAMSA/TBI) without busulfan. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the fi rst report of an association of GO treatment and HLA-DR 15 antigen positivity. If these results were confi rmed in larger studies, HLA-DR 15 could become a marker for GO response. Such information is of special interest for developing salvage therapies for highrisk patients.",

            "text": "Introduction: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) has the goal of inducing a graft versus tumor immune effect, however the choice of the conditioning may have an impact on the overall out come, in fact more intensive regimens can cause greater morbidity and mortality, on the other hand the reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) may have less anti tumor effect. In this study we used a novel conditioning regimen with Fludarabine (FLU) and IV Busulfan (BU) at myeloablative dose. Material and methods: Between February 08 and June 09, 38 Adults pts with AML received a geno identical peripheral blood stem cell transplant with FLU (200 mg/m\u00b2) and one daily iv BU (12,8 mg/Kg) total dose conditioning; the median age is 35 years , the sex ratio is 1,9 (25/13) ; the cytologic types of AML (FAB: M1 = 12, M2 = 16, M3 = 1, M4 = 2, M5 = 5, M6 = 2); 31HSCT were performed in fi rst remission (81,5%), 5 in second remission, and 2 in relapse. The median time from the diagnosis to transplant is 4,4 months (2-10). GVHD prophylaxis associated ciclosporin and methotrexate (Seattle). At September 2009 maximal follow up is 17 months and minimal 3 months. Results: The overall median time to achieve a neutrophil count > 0,5 \u00d7 10 9 /L was the day 14 (9-18), and a platelet count > 20000 was the day 13 (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) ; the median duration of the neutropenia is 9 days (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) . Thirty two pts (84,2%) received blood transfusions (1,8 unit/pt) ; 35 pts (92,1%) received platelets transfusions (2,28 unit/pt). Six pts (16,2%) have a CMV reactivation at day 98 (40-210) Acute GVHD was observed in 10 pts (27%), (Grade II = 4, grade III = 2, grade IV = 4). Chronic GVHD was observed in 11 pts (34,4%), severe cGVHD: 10pts. Four pts (10,8%) relapsed, at a median time of 192 days (102 -330), 2 pts were in 1st CR, and 2 pts in 2nd CR, none of these pts have presented GVHD. Eight pts (21%) died; 4 pts after aGVHD; 2 after relapse, 1 after unknown extra hematological cause, and the last one was graft failure. At one year, TRM was about 10,8%. Thirty pts (84,2%) are still alive; 28 pts (73,6%) are in complete remission; 2 pts are alive in relapse. The median following is 7 (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) . Overall survival and DFS are respectively 74,5 and 64,4%. Conclusion: This study show that FLU-BU myeloablative regimen causes limited toxicity; it can be successfully used in older pts. The rate of relapse seams not higher than what we observed with other myeloablative conditioning regimen (12,8% in CPMC study EBMT 08, 37% GOELAM -Blood 97.",

Uharek (1) (1)Charite Berlin-Campus Benjamin Franklin (Berlin, DE) ; (2) University of Leipzig (Leipzig, DE) Objective: Patients with advanced hematological malignancies, especially refratory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) lacking a HLA-compatible donor for allogeneic stem cell transplantation have very poor outcome. For this patient group haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haploSCT) offers an alternative treatment approach. In a prospective phase I-II trial, we evaluated a haploidentical transplantation protocol S79 combined with early transfer of natural killer (NK) cells, a cell population known to promote lymphohematopoietic reconstitution and to exert cytotoxicity against leukemic blast. Methods: Twenty-fi ve patients with hematological malignancies (AML = 16, ALL = 5, CML = 2, Hodgkin = 1, MDS = 1), lacking an HLA identical donor received a haploSCT followed by transfer of purifi ed CD56 + CD3-NK cells at day + 2. Conditioning consisted of total body irradiation, thiotepa, fl udarabine, and OKT3. NK cells were isolated from the CD34-fraction using an automated two-step procedure of CD3 + depletion and subsequent CD56 + selection. Results: Patients received a mean of 13.3 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/ kg with 2.9 \u00d7 10 4 /kg total CD3 + cells. A mean of 9.9 \u00d7 10 6 CD56 + CD3-NK cells/kg was adoptively transferred. All of the patients developed early graft-versus host disease (GVHD) of the skin (median day of onset d + 9), which promptly resolved after short term treatment with steroids and CSA. After a median follow-up of 4.1 years (range 0.1 to 7.1) 10 of 25 patients are alive and in complete remission resulting in a 3-year overall survival (OS) estimate of 29. 3% . Out of 16 patients with AML, 10 had refractory disease prior transplantation. The 3-year OS estimate for this high-risk group of patients is 44% (8/16) with 5 patients now surviving more than 3 years. Causes of death consisted of infections (n = 12), chronic GvHD (n = 1), relapse (n = 4). Treatment related mortality at d + 100 was 24% (6/25). No correlation was found between KIR-ligand incompatibility and survival. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that the early adoptive transfer of high numbers of HLA-mismatched NK shows promising survival rates for a group of patients lacking other treatment options. Best results have been achieved in patients with AML not only in remission but also with refractory disease -a patient group with otherwise extremely poor outcome. A.H. Elmaagacli (1) , M.

Beelen (1) (1)University Hospital of Essen (Essen, DE) ; (2) University Hospital of Rostock (Rostock, DE) CMV reactivation occurs frequently after HSCT and is associated with an increased TRM. First, we show that HCMV infects acute leukemia cell line Kasumi-1 (AML) and SD-1 (ALL), inhibits their proliferation and induces apoptosis almost in all cells after 14 days. HCMV further inhibits the proliferation of bone marrow progenitor cells derived from healthy volunteers as demonstrated here by the reduction of the number and size of colony forming units in methylcellulose assays. The induction of apoptosis is unusual because HCMV possesses various strategies to prevent apoptosis in infected cells in order to delay their cell death and maintain its own virus replication. Apoptosis via a caspase-dependent pathway occurred although HCMV induced a signifi cant up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic gene cFLIP and anti-stress gene Gadd45a and simultaneously down-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes p53, Bcl-2, Gadd45a in Kasumi-1 and SD-1 cells, showing that the anti-apoptotic mechanisms of HCMV to prevent cell death failed. Concordantly, the coapplication of the caspasespecifi c inhibitor zVAD.fmk to HCMV-infected Kasumi-1 cells inhibited the induction of apoptosis to a great extent. Thereafter we evaluated the clinical outcome of patients with AML after transplant in whom a HCMV reactivation occurred. We evaluated a homogenous group of 140 patients with AML after myeloablative conditioning, non-T cell depleted allogeneic HSCT from a HLA-identical sibling donor, and compared the clinical results to 60 patients with CML after transplant.CMV reactivation was documented by CMV-related matrix protein pp65 antigenemia test and routinely accompanied by a CMV preemptive therapy with ganciclovir. CMV reactivation in AML patients was associated with reduced risk for relapse (11.6% vs. 50.5%; P < 0.0001) and improved overall survival estimates (73.6% vs. 42 .5%, P = 0.039), but increased risk for acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) grade 2-4 (75.1% vs. 37 .5%, P = 0.004) and TRM in our analyses, whereas CML-patients had no advantageous effects. Multivariate analyses for risk of relapse confi rmed CMV reactivation as an independent factor (RR 0.15, ; [95% CI], P < 0.013) besides chronic GVHD, disease stage, and cytogenetics. We show here for the fi rst time a strong anti-leukemic effect of HCMV in AML, which improves the outcome of patients after transplant and might be defi ned as \"virus versus leukemia effect\".",

Mineishi University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, US) In an effort to improve the anti-tumor activity of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) conditioning, we combined clofarabine as a single daily dose of 20, 30 or 40 mg/m 2 IV \u00d7 5d (days -6 to -2) with myeloablative doses of busulfan administered as a single daily dose of 3.2 mg/kg IV \u00d7 4d (days -5 to -2) (CloBu4) in a phase I/II study in non-remission hematologic malignancies. Pts with acute leukemias had either \u2265 5% bone marrow blasts or peripheral blasts, while all other hematologic malignancies had active disease at transplant. Pts received dexamethasone 12 mg IV on the days of clofarabine to prevent capillary leak syndrome. No patients received T-depleting antibodies with conditioning. Characteristics of 44 pts are shown in the Table. Pts received an average of 3 regimens prior to HCT and 57% received unrelated and/or HLA mismatched grafts. Pts with AML (N = 29) had either primary induction failure (41%) or refractory relapse (59%) with an average of 28% (2%-91%) bone marrow blasts. CloBu4 was well tolerated. Non-hematologic toxicities included: transaminitis (52%), hand-foot syndrome (12%), transient hypoxia (11%), VOD (5%), hyperbilirubinemia (5%), and seizure (2%). All patients engrafted (11 days for neutrophils; 12 days for platelets). Full donor chimerism \u2265 95%) at day + 100 was seen in 28/29 (97%) of pts for CD33 + cells and 23/29 (79%) for CD3 + cells. Acute GVHD (\u2265 grade 2) developed in 39% of pts. 80% of pts achieved CR by day + 30 (93% for AML). With a median follow up of 11 months, overall survival for the entire cohort is 44% (54% for AML) at 18 months. We compared outcomes for the 29 pts with nonremission AML to 50 historical non-remission AML pts who received myeloablative conditioning with busulfan (N = 43) or TBI (N = 7) based regimens. The cumulative incidence (CI) of relapse at 18 months in study pts was signifi cantly lower compared to historical controls (26% vs. 60%; P = 0.045). The CI of non-relapse mortality at 18 months was not signifi cantly different between study and control pts (25% vs. 19%, P = 0.13). Disease-free survival at 18 months for study pts was better than control pts, but this did not meet the criteria for statistical signifi cance (45% vs. 21%, P = 0.11; Figure) . In conclusion, these data suggest that clofarabine combined with myeloablative doses of busulfan is well tolerated, results in reliable engraftment, and has signifi cant anti-leukemic activity in patients with non-remission AML at HCT.",

            "text": "We have addressed the question of the feasibility of searching HSC donors grafts [HLA-matched sibling donor (MSD), and alternative donors] and performing such transplants or other treatments (such as autologous HSC transplant or chemotherapy) for adults with AL for whom an indication of allo-HSCT could be planned. The second objective was to compare in an \"intent-to-treat\" analysis, LFS according to planned strategy treatment. Patients were included at HLAtyping test. From 2003 test. From to 2006 , 700 adults were enrolled by 31 EBMT centres, 488 had AML, 212 ALL. HLA-typing was performed for 440 patients at diagnosis, 173 after fi rst CR, 10 after CR2, and 76 in more advanced phase. Defi nitive analysis was planned to be performed in December 2009. Median follow-up was 38 months, median age was 42-years (18-75); 207 patients were aged more than 50-y. A MSD was found for 311 patients (45%). At the end, 269 patients were planned to be transplanted with a family donor. For the remaining 421 patients, the indication of an auto-HCT was made in 84 patients (20%), use of chemotherapy as post-remission therapy in 131 (33%) and indication of an allo-HSCT with an alternative donor in 199 (47%). Of those 199 patients, the transplant centres were keen to search for a cord blood donor in 72 cases and for a haplo donor in 11 cases. At last follow-up, 450 patients of 700 patients included received an HSCT (64%). Cumulative incidence (CI, using death as competing event) of allotransplantation for all patients at 1-year it was 49 \u00b1 2%. At 1y, CI of allotransplantation was 88 \u00b1 2% for patients with a MSD, 57 \u00b1 3% for those of whom a donor search was performed and it was -6 \u00b1 % for those patients for whom another treatment was planned. For those patients with a MDS, 6% died before the transplantation and 16% relapsed before receiving a transplant and for those with a donor search, 8% died and 27% relapsed. Probability of survival at 2-y for 700 patients was 56%. According to treatment planned at HLA-typing, poor risk cytogenetic was present in 46% of patients searching for an alternative donor, 32% for those with a MSD, 10% for autologous treatment and 21% for chemotherapy. In an intent-to-treat analysis, 2y-LFS after HLA-typing was 43% for patients searching for an alternative donor, 49% for those with a MSD, 47% for those with a planned autologous transplantation and 46% for those with a chemotherapy alone treatment. After transplantation, 2 y-DFS was 50% for autologous, 43% for unrelated donors and 54% for MDS transplantation. In conclusion, the majority of patients (80%) with AL in European centres are HLA typed at diagnosis or CR1. The majority of patients received a MSD as planned treatment in the fi rst year after HLA typing. Finally, treatment strategies in those 31 centres seem to be linked to patients and disease characteristics and therefore fi nal LFS was not statistically different between all strategies. B. Federmann, C. Faul, W. Vogel, L. Kanz, W. A. Bethge Hematology & Oncology (Tubingen, DE) Current treatment algorithms in AML employ allogeneic HCT from a matched related donor (MRD) in fi rst complete remission (CR). The role of matched/mismatched unrelated donor (MUD/MMUD) HCT remains to be evaluated. We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 230 consecutive adult patients (median age 50 (range 18-76)) with AML receiving HCT at our institution 2000-2009 after myeloablative (MAC = 142) or reduced-intensitiy conditioning (RIC = 88). 79 patients were transplanted from MRD, 85 from MUD and 65 from MMUD. In all but seven patients receiving MMUD grafts, ATG was included in the conditioning. The three cohorts of patients were evenly distributed for age, risk profi le and pretreatment. At time of HCT 23 (MRD), 18 (MUD) and 30 (MMUD) patients were not in CR. Current overall survival (OS) is 41/79 (52%) in patients transplanted from MRD, 52 of 88 (61%) from MUD and 35 of 65 (54%) from MMUD with a median follow-up of 1331 (range, 136-3530) , 904 (range, 100-3267) and 662 (range, 128-1971) days of patients alive. Kaplan-Meier-estimated 3-year OS was similar with 55% after MRD-, 58% after MUD-and 49% after MMUD-HCT (P = 0.4707). In patients transplanted in CR, 3-year estimated OS was also comparable (60% MRD vs. 57% MUD vs. 50% MMUD, P = 0.90). However, in patients transplanted in partial remission (PR) we observed a better OS with a MUD graft (31% MRD vs. 47% MUD vs. 43% MMUD, P = 0.18). In patients receiving MAC a better OS compared to RIC was observed (estimated 3-year OS of 59% vs. 48% (P = 0.25)) mainly due to a lower incidence of relapse. This was also apparent in the subgroup receiving MRD-HCT (61% vs. 26%, P = 0.06), MUD-(61% vs. 49%, P = 0.80) or MMUD-HCT (51% vs. 50%, P = 0.88) respectively. There were no signifi cant differences in the incidence of aGVHD > II with 24% (MRD), 33% (MUD) and 34% (MMUD) or cGVHD with 38% (MRD), 44% (MUD) and 32% (MMUD), respectively. We observed a significant better OS in patients with limited vs. extensive or without cGVHD (estimated 3-year OS 75% vs. 35% vs. 50%, P = 0.0002). This advantage was present in the subgroup with MRD (86% vs. 40% vs. 43% P = 0.003), but not after MUD (68% vs. 30% vs. 61% P = 0.08) and MMUD (63% vs. 30% vs. 47%, P = 0.32).",

All patients received peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Twenty patients (57%) were transplanted from unrelated donors and 15 patients had an HLAidentical sibling donor. pDLIs were given to patients meeting following criteria: no detectable hematological disease, being off immunosuppression for at least 30 days without active graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), no history of acute GVHD \u2265 grade III\u00b0, no active infections. Two patients received one, 8 patients received two and 25 patients received three pDLIs in escalating doses. Median time from transplantation to fi rst pDLI was 190 days (range 91-439). Minimal interval between two consecutive pDLIs was 4 weeks. Median cell doses were 2 \u00d7 10 5 , 5 \u00d7 10 6 and 1 \u00d7 10 7 CD3 + cells/kg at pDLI 1, 2, 3, respectively. Reasons for administering fewer than three pDLIs were GVHD, relapse, infections or patient\u00b4s refusal. At the time of analysis 24/35 patients (69%) were alive in complete remission (CR). Median follow-up of survivors was 888 days after transplantation (range 292-2281). Six patients (17%) developed disease relapse (medullary n = 5; extramedullary, n = 1). Median time to relapse after transplantation was 322 days (range 222-963). Whereas 5 patients died as a result of relapse, one patient survived, being in CR after second transplantation. The 3-year OS and LFS were 72 and 69%, respectively. Extensive chronic GVHD developed in 7 patients (20%). While in 4 patients chronic GVHD could be controlled, 3 of them died because of refractory GVHD (cutaneous scleroderma, n = 1; pulmonary fi brosis, n = 1; polyserositis, n = 1). Two patients developed limited disease not requiring systemic immunosuppressive therapy. Although further studies assessing the impact of chronic GVHD on the quality of life are warranted, our results indicate that pDLIs are feasible and associated with a low relapse rate and an excellent chance for long term survival in spite of high risk myeloid malignancy in selected patients.",

Here, we analyzed whether the EBMT risk-score predicts the outcome of pts. with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) undergoing alloSCT. Patients and methods: We retrospectively evaluated 225 pts. with AML (median age: 45 years, range: 17-68 years) who underwent alloSCT at our institution between 1994 and 2007. 174 pts. (77%) had de novo AML and 51 pts. (23%) had secondary or therapy-related AML. A favorable karyotype was present in 11 pts. (5%), 122 (54%) or 76 pts. (34%) had an intermediate-risk or a poor-risk karyotype (not evaluable: 16 pts. (7%)). 125 pts. (56%) had a myeloablative conditioning (MAC) whereas 100 pts. (44%) received reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). Transplants were from a matched-related donor (MRD) in 102 pts. (45%), a matched-unrelated or a mismatched-unrelated donor was chosen in 97 (43%) or in 25 pts. (12%). One patient had a mismatched related donor. 120 pts. (53%) were in CR1, 40 pts. (18%) were > CR1, and 65 pts. (29%) had active (relapsed/refractory) disease at the time of alloSCT. The EBMT Isolated GS is a rare malignant disorder usually presenting as an extramedullary myeloid cell tumor proliferation. GS can be associated with chromosome 8 abnormalities and can be also observed in 3 to 7% of AML cases (called \"leukemic\"GS, LGS hereinafter). We have previously shown, that allo-SCT following an AML-like chemotherapy is likely the best available therapeutic option for patients with LGS (J Clin Oncol 2008). However, it is still unclear whether allo-SCT is a valid therapeutic option for patients with isolated GS (IGS). The aim of this analysis was to assess the role of allo-SCT in patients with isolated GS as compared to patients with LGS. We retrospectively analysed the outcome of 68 GS patients including 14 cases of IGS (median age, 39 y.) and 54 cases of LGS (median age, 38 y.) reported to the EBMT registry between January 1990 and December 2007. In this series, patients received either a standard (IGS, n = 13 vs. LGS, n = 44, P = NS) or a reduced intensity conditioning (IGS, n = 1 vs. LGS, n = 10, P = NS) allo-SCT from a related (IGS n = 10 vs. LGS, n = 36, P = NS) or a matched unrelated donor (IGS, n = 4 vs. LGS, n = 18, P = NS). There were no signifi cant statistical differences between the two groups in terms of year of transplantation, cytogenetics features, disease status, source of stem cell, donor type, conditioning regimen, and recipient CMV serostatus. Engraftment was observed in all patients. The incidences of grade 2 and grade 3-4 acute GVHD were 20% (n = 15) and 8% (n = 6), respectively. The incidence of chronic GVHD at 2 years was 37 \u00b1 7%. With a median follow-up of 56 (range, 7-213) months, the probability of 5-year LFS, relapse incidence (RI), non relapse mortality (NRM) were 44 \u00b1 7%, 37 \u00b1 7% and 19 \u00b1 5%, respectively. When comparing the two sub-groups (IGS vs. LGS), there were no signifi cant differences in term of major outcomes: neutrophils recovery (IGS:18 days vs. LGS: 19 days) , occurrence of grade 2-4 acute GVHD (IGS: 21% vs. LGS: 33%), 2-year chronic GVHD (IGS: 54% vs. LGS: 32%), 5-year LFS (IGS: 54 \u00b1 14% vs.",

Rocha on behalf of the Acute Leukemia Working Party of EBMT Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with translocation t(6;9) (p23;q34)/DEK-NUP214(CAN) rearrangement is a rare AML variety, associated to a poor prognosis, with a long-term survival of less than 20% in adult patients (Slovak, Leukemia 2006) . Nonetheless, a more favourable outcome has been suggested after allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (alloHSCT), although only anecdotal studies with small series of patients have specifi cally addressed this issue. To investigate the possible role of alloHSCT for the management of AML with t(6;9), we analyzed the outcome of patients with this entity reported to the ALWP. Overall, we identifi ed 68 patients with this AML subtype allografted during the period 1988-2009 (median year of transplant, 2004) . Median age was 39 (range: and 51% were male. Most transplants were performed in complete response (CR1 = 49, 72%; CR2 = 8, 12%), whereas only a minority were performed in advanced phase (primary refractory, n = 5; relapse, n = 2). Donor was an HLA-identical sibling in 37 transplants (54%), and a matched unrelated donor in 24 (35%). Conditioning regimen consisted of a myeloablative regimen in most patients (n = 56, 82%). After a median follow-up of 52 months , 5-year overall leukemia-free survival (LFS), relapse incidence (RI), and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 42 \u00b1 6%, 28 \u00b1 3%, and 30 \u00b1 5%, respectively. In those patients who received an alloHSCT in CR1, 5-year LFS, RI, and NRM was 50 \u00b1 8%, 19 \u00b1 6%, and 31 \u00b1 7%, respectively, without signifi cant differences between transplants from HLA-identical sibling and unrelated donors (see fi gure). In conclusion, alloHSCT in early phase resulted in a favourable outcome in patients with AML and t(6;9), suggesting this procedure might overcome the adverse prognosis associated to this entity. The analysis of transplant outcome of specifi c, molecularly defi ned entities might provide a better knowledge of the role of alloHSCT for the management of AML.",

We therefore initiated a phase 2 study of repeated vaccination with PR1 and WT1 peptides in patients with myeloid malignancies. Six patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 2 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) received 6 injections at 2 weekly intervals of PR1 and WT1 peptides in Montanide adjuvant, with GM-CSF as previously described. Six of 8 patients completed 6 courses of vaccination and follow-up as per protocol to monitor toxicity and immunological responses. Responses to PR1 or WT1 vaccines were detected in all patients after only 1 dose of vaccine. However, additional boosting did not further increase the frequency of PR1 or WT1-specifi c CD8 + T-cell response. In 4/6 evaluable patients the vaccine-induced T-cell response was lost after the fourth dose and in all patients before the sixth dose of vaccine. We found a signifi cant but transient reduction of circulating CD4 + Foxp3 + T cells associated with an increase in vaccine-induced PR1 and WT1 specifi c CD8 + T-cells in patients following vaccination. Vaccination led to preferential expansion of low avidity PR1 and WT1 specifi c CD8 + T-cell responses that were PD1 negative and was not associated with a significant reduction in WT1 expression, employed as a measure of minimal residual disease. We analyzed bone marrow samples collected from all vaccinated patients 4 weeks following the 6th dose of vaccine and failed to detect PR1 or WT1 specifi c CD8 + T-cells, thereby excluding preferential localization of PR1 and WT1 vaccine-induced CD8 + T-cells to the BM as an explanation for the failure to detect vaccine-specifi c CD8 + T cells in the peripheral blood. Three months following the 6th dose of PR1 and WT1 peptides we could not detect the presence of PR1 and WT1 specifi c CD8 + T-cells by direct ex-vivo tetramer and IC-IFN-g assay or with 1-week cultured IFN-g ELISPOT assay, suggesting that vaccination with PR1 and WT1 peptides in Montanide adjuvant does not induce memory CD8 + T-cell responses. These data support the immunogenicity of PR1 and WT1 peptide vaccines. However new approaches will be needed to induce long-term memory responses against leukemia antigens such as novel adjuvants or induction of CD4 + help. This study is registered at http://clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00499772.",

Russell (2) (1)Alberta Children's Hospital (Calgary, CA); (2) Tom Baker Cancer Center (Calgary, CA); (3) Cross Cancer Institute (Edmonton, CA) Conditioning-intensity signifi cantly infl uences outcomes of stem cell transplant for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Low-dose total body irradiation (TBI) in a once daily intravenous-busulfan (iBu), fl udarabine (Flu) and Thymoglobulin (rATG) regimen improves outcomes. Even without TBI, a daily iBu AUC above 6000 \u03bcM.min, signifi cantly increases non-relapse mortality (NRM) in this regimen. We report the results of a study to determine the effect of iBu exposures below 6000 \u03bcM.min in patients (pts) with AML. 109 adult pts were treated between 2001 and 2008 with Flu 50 mg/m 2 daily \u00d7 5, iBu 3.2 mg/kg daily \u00d7 4 and TBI 200cGy \u00d7 2 on day -1 or 0. Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) prophylaxis was cyclosporine A, methotrexate and rATG (Genzyme) 4.5 mg/kg total dose. Patients received a test dose of iBu two days before the fi rst treatment dose of iBu. One quarter of the test dose AUC was added to the AUC of the fi rst or third iBu treatment dose to give an average daily exposure for the complete 4-day treatment course. Five pts with AUC > 6000 \u03bcM.min were excluded. The remainder (n = 104) were divided equally into low exposure (LE) (AUC 2547-4321 \u03bcM.min) and high exposure (HE) (AUC 4322-6000 \u03bcM.min) groups. Median age was 48 (range 21-63) years in LE pts and 48 (18-66) years for the HE pts. There was no difference in the percentage of recipients with CR1, CR2 and advanced disease (64, 17, 19 vs. 69, 19, 12) , alternative (unrelated/mismatched related) donors (58 vs. 54), CMV + ve donor and/or recipient (67 vs. 60), female donors to male recipients (19 vs. 19 ), high-risk recipient cytogenetics (25 vs. 18 ) and bone marrow as cell source (4 vs. 6 ) between the LE and HE pts respectively. Follow-up of survivors was 12-104 months (median 34) for LE pts and 13-76 months (median 36) for HE pts. The incidence of aGvHD grade II-IV at 27% vs. 20%, aGvHD grade III-IV at 8% vs. 10% and chronic GvHD at 48% vs. 55% was not different for either group. Neither was there a difference in overall-survival (76% vs. 57%, P = 0.094), disease-free survival (74% vs. 56%, P = ns) or relapse (22% vs. 29%, P = ns) for LE or HE pts respectively. NRM (4% vs. 22%, P = 0.039) however, was worse for HE pts. We conclude, when this regimen is used for AML: 1. Higher iBu exposures within the range studied do not reduce relapse. Including TBI in the regimen may abrogate this effect. 2 . Higher iBu exposures increase NRM. 3 . Targeting iBu exposure to between 2500 and 4300 \u03bcM.min may improve outcomes.",

In this study, we tested the missing-self hypothesis, which indicates that alloreactivity is regulated by inhibitory KIRreceptors on natural killer NK cells and their corresponding HLA ligands on recipient cells. Patients and methods: Out of a consecutive cohort of 147 patients allografted between 1996 and 2007, blinded samples from 54 donor/patients AML-patients, pairs were evaluated for retrospective KIR-ligand matching. The median patients age was 47 (25-66) years. Patients were transplanted with G-CSF-stimulated PBSC (n = 51) or bone marrow (n = 3) from HLA matched unrelated (n = 31) donors or family related donors (n = 23). KIR typing was performed as previously described. Patients were categorized according to their HLA inhibitory KIR ligand group C1, C2, Bw4, A3/A11 and presence or absence of KIR. Results: A total of 27/54 patients died due to relapse (n = 17)or NRM (n = 10). The median follow up of surviving patients was 4,2 years (range 1,9-7.2) years. The overall survival (OAS) of all 54 evaluable patients at 5 years was 50%. In 31 patients HLA ligands for donor inhibitory KIR2DL receptors in the recipient were lacking (mismatch). KIR-ligand mismatch was associated with a signifi cantly superior overall survival S84 (0.63 vs. 0.31, P = 0.01) , superior eventfree survival (0.55 vs. 0.25, P = 0.009), a reduced non-relapse mortality (0.12 vs. 0.52, P = 0.015) and a reduced relapse rate (0.36 vs. 0.46, P = 0.15 ). Conclusions: The mismatch for KIR2DL2/3-HLA-C-Group-1 or KIR2DL1-HLA-C-Group-2 ligands is associated with a signifi cantly better outcome for AML patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.",

Orsola-Malpighi Hospital (Bologna, IT) ; (6)University of Brno (Brno, CZ); (7)Collegium Medicum, Jagiellonian University (Cracow, PL); (8)University of Frankfurt (Frankfurt, DE) Approximately 20% of adults with ALL presents with t(9;22). The introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in this group of patients increased CR rate and appeared to prolong leukemia-free survival (LFS). However, the risk of relapse remains high and allogeneic HSCT is still considered the treatment of choice. Patients ineligible for alloHSCT may be offered autologous HSCT although its value in Ph-positive ALL has not been documented so far. The European Working Group for Adult ALL (EWALL) performed a retrospective analysis of results of autoHSCT in a setting of Ph-positive ALL. Only patients with known status of minimal residual disease (MRD) at the time of autoHSCT were included. 22 patients, aged 50 (21-62) years, treated with autoHSCT in fi rst CR between 1996-2006 in 5 European countries entered the analysis. Median CR duration prior to autoHSCT was 6 (2-13) months. 10 patients were pre-treated with imatinib. Peripheral blood was used as a source of stem cells in all but 2 cases. Conditioning was either TBI + Cy (n = 16) or BuCy (n = 6). The status of MRD evaluated based on molecular analysis of BCR-ABL fusion gene was assessed as negative in 11 cases and positive in 11 patients. 9 patients received post-transplant maintenance consisting of imatinib (n = 4) or chemotherapy (n = 5). With the median follow-up of 2 years, the probability of LFS at 3-years for the whole group was 53% ( \u00b1 15%). The probabilities of relapse and non-relapse mortality were 38% and 9%, respectively. The LFS rate was higher for patients with negative MRD status at autoHSCT (82% \u00b1 12%) compared to those MRD-positive (25% \u00b1 20%, P = 0.08). No signifi cant association of the type of induction-consolidation therapy, type of conditioning, the use of post-transplant maintenance and age with outcome was found. We conclude that autoHSCT apppears a valuable option for adults with Ph-positive ALL achieving negative MRD status. Its role as a curative treatment should be assessed in prospective trial.",

Bacigalupo (2) (1)Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro (Genoa, IT); (2) S.Martino's Hospital (Genoa, IT) Background: Leukemia relapse remains a signifi cant cause of failure after allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (Bone Marrow Transplant. 2007; 39: 341) . Increasing the total dose of total body irradfi ation (TBI) has the potential of increasing leukemia cell kill, but is associated with increased toxicity (Blood. 1998 ; 92(4) :1455). Total marrow irradiation (TMI) delivered with Helical Tomotherapy (HT) may overcome this problem, by concentrating the radiation dose to the bone marrow, and reducing the dose delivered to vital organs Aim of the study: This is a feasibility study of TBI/TMI in patients with advanced malignancies, undergoing an allogeneic HSCT. TBI/TMI. Patients received conventional TBI (1200 cGy, as 200 cGy \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3) followed the next day by TMI (2 Gy in a single fraction), followed by cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg \u00d7 2. GvHD prophylaxis was cyclosporine methotrexate. While TBI was delivered with linear accelerator, TMI was HT. Patients were treated in supine position with hands laying on their groins. A couple of thermoplastic masks were used to fi x the head/ neck and the thorax and the arms, respectively. Whole body CT imaging was performed by Tomotherapy unit prior to TMI to provide 3-D alignment of patient anatomy to the intended target regions. Patients: We treated 6 patients beyond CR1 (3 sibs, 3 unrelated), median age 35 (19-55). Two were ALL relapsed within 5 months from an allogeneic HSCT, 2 were AML in relapse, 1 was an AML in CR2 relapsing after an autograft, 1 a myelofibrosis with advanced disease. Results: Median organ doses reduction ranged from 15% to 80% with the largest dose reduction -50% to -80%) achieved for testes, brain, larynx, liver, lungs and kidney. Small organs as parotids and oral mucosa are less spared (-35%) than others. Radiation treatment time for TMI 2 Gy, ranged from 18 min to 22 min. Target areas (bone marrow sites) were irradiated with an optimal conformity and an excellent dose homogeneity. Outcome: Follow up is still short ranging from 40 to 140 days. However: tolerance was not different from a conventional CY-TBI. All 6 patients treated with TBI/TMI are currently alive in remission. Of the two relapsed ALL, one is VDJ negative and one is VDJ positive. Conclusions: This study confi rms the feasibility of using HT to deliver TMI. Organ sparing by TMI with HT, warrants a prospective dose fi nding study, with TMI doses up to 6 Gy (and total dose to the marrow of 18 Gy).",

Milone Ospedale Ferrarotto (Catania, IT) In AML patients with a CD34 + high apheretic yield during mobilization, have a poor prognosis independently from cytogenetic risk (Feller 2004 , Keating 2004 . We have studied prospectively the prognostic value of CD34 peak reached in P.B . during PBSC mobilization in a group of 50 AML adult patients. PBSC mobilization was obtained, after fi rst consolidation course, by use of G-CSF. Cytogenetic assessment at diagnosis was available in 95% of patients and FLT-3 status in 30 patients. 49% of patients received an Allogeneic transplant, 41% an autologous transplant while 10% no further chemotherapy. Overall Survival (OS) in the entire cohort of patients was 60% and Disease Free Survival (DFS) was 50%. CD34 + peak during mobilization, evaluated as a continuous variable, resulted important for OS (hazard ratio: 1.002 ; P = 0.002) as well as for DFS (hazard ratio: 1.001 ; P = 0.01). Importance of CD34 + peak was present also in the stratum of patients with a normal cytogenetic (OS: P = 0.003; DFS: P = 0.002), in stratum of patients having FLT3 wild type (OS: P = 0.02; DFS: P = 0.04) and in stratum of patients that did not receive allogeneic HSC transplant (OS: P = 0.010; DFS: P = 0.007). Importance of CD34 + peak was however not present after allogeneic HSC transplant (OS: P = 0.36; DFS: P = 0.95). Prognostic signifi cance of CD34 + cells was then evaluated in groups of patients identifi ed in respect of median value of CD34 + peak. Those having a CD34 + cell peak > 200/ mmc had a OS of 20%, lower than that observed in patients having a CD34 peak < 200/mmc, who had an OS of 69%, (P = 0.001 ( Figure 1 ). Group of patients having higher CD34 + peak in P.B . had also a lower DFS (20%) in respect to patients having a CD34 + peak < 200/mmc (60%), (log rank: P = 0.008). Again these differences were present in stratum of patients with intermediate cytogenetic risk, in stratum of FLT-3 wild type and in stratum of patients treated with autologous transplantation or not transplanted but were not evident in stratum of patients treated with allogeneic transplantation (Table 1 ). In conclusion a CD34 + peak > 200/mmc in P.B. during PBSC mobilization has a poor prognostic value independent from cytogenetic and FLT-3 ITD. This adverse prognostic effect may be, however, substantially reduced by allogeneic transplantation.",

Little data is available on its role in SCT for acute myeloid leukaemia, in particular in advanced disease. Therefore, we performed a retrospective analysis of 113 patients (57 female, 56 male) who had received an allogeneic SCT for highrisk AML or progressive MDS. Serum ferritin levels measured before start of conditioning were evaluated with respect to their infl uence on post transplant complications and overall survival. Patients were transplanted for de novo AML (n = 50), progressive MDS/sAML (n = 51), tAML (n = 10) and AML secondary to MPS (n = 2), either in untreated disease (20%), primary induction failure (30%), CR1 (16%), or beyond CR1(33%). Cytogenetics were favourable, intermediate, poor and unknown in 3, 61, 46 and 3 cases. Donors were HLA id siblings (24%), matched (50%) and mismatched (26%) unrelated donors. Median ferritin level before start of conditioning was 1900 (76-11008) mg/l. Median follow up in 59 survivors was 19 months, median overall survival (OS) of the entire cohort was 21.7 months. Relapse or progressive leukaemia was the cause of death in 28 patients, 22 died without evidence of leukaemia and were regarded as treatment-related deaths (TRD). With respect to ferritin levels, no association could be detected with cardiac or liver toxicity after SCT, or with TRD in general. Nevertheless, patients with a ferritin level > 2700 mg/l, corresponding to the highest quartile, had a signifi cantly inferior OS (median OS: 6 mo vs. 24 mo, P = .006). This was also confi rmed in a multivariate analysis, with stage at transplantation and donor type as competing variables (HR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.2-4.1) . In conclusion, extremely high ferritin levels seem to be an unfavourable factor for survival after allogeneic SCT in advanced MDS and high-risk AML. Since a clear association with toxicitiy or TRD after SCT could not be shown, it remains to be elucidated by more detailed analysis, whether high ferritin levels are a surrogate marker for otherwise unfavourable disease, or if the iron overload itself was responsible for the inferior outcome by a so far not yet recognized mechanism.",

Genetic and environmental factors play an interactive role in the development of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The HLA association has been considered as a possible genetic risk factor. Aims: It is unknown whether there exists a restriction to certain MHC genotypes in leukemia like ALL. Methods: The material of the study -leukocytes peripheral blood from 162 children with initial diagnosed AML (B-ALL-83, T-ALL-30, ALL-49) and 2060 controls (leukocytes umbilical cord blood from healthy donors). Revealing HLA antigens at low level performed by SSO method on DynalRELI 48 processor. The results received with ambiguous interpretation was using PCR-SSP method (Ivitrogen). Results: The results showed that in comparison with the control group, the gene frequence of: HLA-A*32 (ALL-10,0%, B-ALL-11,7% vs. -4,7%); HLA-A*03 (B-ALL-48,0% vs. 21%); HLA-A*23 (ALL-8,1%, T-ALL -8,0% vs. 4,3%), HLA-A*26 (T-ALL-17,8% vs. 7,8%), HLA-A*51 (T-ALL-18,5% vs. 6,2%); HLA*Cw 04 (B-ALL-35,2% vs. 20,0%), HLA-Cw*07 (B-ALL-68,5% vs. 40,5%), HLA-Cw*01 (T-ALL-20,0% vs. 6,6%), HLA-Cw*05 (T-ALL-15,8% vs. 6,0%), HLA-DRB1*09 (B-ALL-7,9% vs. 2,3%), HLA-DRB1*08 (B-ALL-11,35% vs. 5,4%), HLA-DRQ1*05 (T-ALL-51,7% vs. 30,0%) increased signifi cantly, but the gene frequence of: HLA-A*68 (B-ALL-1,3% vs. -6,0%) and HLA-Cw*01 (ALL -3,7%, B-ALL-3,8% vs. -6,7%) allele frequency decreased signifi cantly for patients with ALL. These alleles it is possible to consider as factors of resistency to the predisposition disease at children. Conclusion: These results suggest that susceptibility to ALL is linked to the histocompatibility HLA molecule itself, although the development of the disease also needs inherited or probably acquired factors not linked to the major histocompatibility complex.",

Treatment consisted for the majority of patients (n = 33) of 3-4 monthly cycles of polychemotherapy and steroids according to national guidelines or hyperCVAD (n = 9) or other (n = 7). Time to transplantation from diagnosis was median 5 (range [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] months and the majority of the patients were transplanted in fi rst CR. The median age was 41 (range 20-66) years.There were 23 females and 26 males. Forty-three received myeloablative and 6 reduced conditioning. Before transplantation imatinib was included in the treatment protocols in 32 patients (65%). Twenty-four patients received stem cells from related donors, 24 from unrelated donors and one from cord blood. Twenty-seven patients (55%) and 22 (48%) developed any grades of acute or chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) respectively. The 5-year overall survival (OS) for all patients was 49%, higher in patients <40 years (n = 21) 71% than in patients \u2265 40 years (n = 28) 35% (P = 0.02). Chronic GVHD was associated with improved 5-year OS of 74% compared to no chronic GVHD with OS of 32% (P = 0.05) . Four of 17 patients with relapse are still alive 8, 12, 14 and 27 months after transplantation on tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment started at relapse. The results have improved compared to our national 1986-2000 study where the 5-year OS was 33% in Ph + ALL patients (n = 27, median age 37 (range 19-57)) grafted in fi rst remission. However, in the present study we have not found superior survival when imatinib was used before transplantation. It can be argued that some patients in the imatinib treated group might not have reached transplantation if imatinib had not been given. According to our limited experience salvage TKI treatment for Ph + ALL given at relapse after transplantation is effective in some patients and may prolong overall survival.",

Bertz, J. Finke Freiburg University Medical Center (Freiburg, DE) Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the most effective curative therapy in many patients with hematologic malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Cytogenetics studies stratify patients into three groups of prognosis according to the overall survival. These classifi cations are not fully predictive of response. Genomic technologies can identify molecular subgroups with distinct genomic signatures. We investigated the genomic changes in patients with AML undergoing HCT using DNA microarrays. We analyzed 11 patients before HCT and at relapse after HCT, 6 patients had a normal karyotype at diagnosis and 5 had abnormal karyotype with different types of aberrations. After high resolution of whole genome DNA profi ling analysis 5 of the 6 patients with normal karyotype showed genomic aberrations (GA) in the form of gains and losses (5/5 gains/losses) in several regions of different chromosomes with a median of 2 GA per case. The abnormal karyotype group, in addition to the cytogenetically detected aberrations GA were present in 2 out of 5 patients (5/4 gains/ losses). Overall 64% of the patients had GA, not detected by conventional cytogenetics. All FAB subtypes of AML showed GA, being M5 and secondary AML both with more numerous GA (average: 12 and 17 GA respectively). At relapse 6 patients increased the number of GA, (median of 7 GA per case), while 3 patients presented a reduced number of GA (median 2 GA per case). The remaining 2 patients showed no additional changes. Before transplantation 16 chromosomes showed GA with a median of 3 GA per chromosome, average size of gains and losses were 1568 and 8046 kb respectively. At relapse 19 chromosomes had GA with a median of 4 GA per chromosome, average size of gains and losses were 697 and 8011 kb respectively. Chromosomes 11, 14 and 21 showed no GA at any time point. Our preliminary data demonstrate that AML is a genomically heterogeneous disease with a high incidence of small non recurrent DNA GA that can be detected even in cases with normal karyotype. Cryptic genomic changes are likely to play a role in relapse after allogeneic transplantation.",

            "text": "Background: The effi cacy of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in fi rst remission has been demonstrated through clinical studies using genetic randomization. These genetic randomization studies, however, cannot accurately answer the question whether patients with a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling should undergo allogeneic HSCT or chemotherapy in fi rst remission, since patients without a sibling donor had to choose alternative donor transplantation or chemotherapy alone once they had a relapse in these studies. Methods: To fi nd out the optimal treatment strategies for adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL in fi rst remission who have an HLA-matched sibling, decision analysis was performed based on the decision tree ( Figure 1 ). Transition probabilities and utilities were estimated from the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group (JALSG) studies (ALL93 and ALL97), the database of the Japan Society for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (JSHCT), and the literatures. Utilities were calculated based on 10-year survival probability with or without an adjustment for quality of life (QOL). Subgroup analyses were also performed according to the risk stratifi cation based on the white blood cell (WBC) count and cytogenetics, and according to the age stratifi cation with a cutoff of 35 years. Results: In analyses without QOL adjustment, the superiority of allogeneic HSCT in fi rst remission was demonstrated in the whole population and also in all subgroups. Sensitivity analyses supported these results in all groups except for the higher-aged group. On the other hand, the superiority of allogeneic HSCT was demonstrated only in the high-risk group if adjusted for QOL. The superiority of chemotherapy appeared to be robust in the higher-aged group by sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: To improve the long-term survival probability, we should consider allogeneic HSCT in fi rst remission for adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL who have an HLA-matched sibling. Considering QOL, however, chemotherapy might be preferred in higher-aged patients.",

            "text": "Tandem auto-allo in acute myeloid leukaemia patients in fi rst complete remission L. Castagna, S. F\u00fcrst, T. Pr\u00e9bet, J. El Cheikh, A. Charbonnier, C. Faucher, M. Mohty, N. Vey, D. Blaise Institut Paoli Calmettes (Marseille, FR) High and intermediate risk acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) can benefi t of reduced intensity allogeneic stem cell transplantation (RIC-ALLO) in fi rst complete remission (CR). To contrast the high relapse rate in RIC-ALLO we hypothyzed that if a better quality of remission could be achieved, the relapse incidence could be lowered. Patients and methods: From 2001 to 2008, 31 AML patients in fi rst CR received a tandem auto-allo program. The median number of white blood cell was 3 \u00d7 10 9 /l (range 0.9-235). After one or two induction chemotherapies (CT), all but two patients received a consolidation course with high-dose cytarabine (HD-ARAC) CT, followed by autologous stem cell harvest. HD melphalan (HD-PAM 140 mg/m\u00b2) followed by autologous stem cells reinfusion was administered, followed by ALLO-RIC. RIC consisted of fl udarabine plus (2 Gy) TBI (3 pts) or fl udarabine, oral or intravenous busulfan (8 mg/kg) in two days, and anti thymocyte globulin (2.5 or 5 mg/kg). GVHD prophylaxis was cyclosporine (CyA) plus mycofenolate mofetil (3 pts) or CyA alone (28 pts). Donors were all but one HLA identical sibling. The median number of allogeneic CD34 + and CD3 + cells was 6.1 \u00d7 10e 6 /Kg (range 1.9-11) and 315 (range 166-609). Prognostic scores (HCT-CI, PAM, EBMT) were retrospectively calculated for each patient. Results: The median follow-up was from diagnosis and ALLO-RIC 40 and 34 months, respectively. The median time between last CT and HD-PAM was 51 days (range 30-77) and HD-PAM and ALLO-RIC was 69 days (55-176). Treatment related mortality after HD-PAM was null. Prognostic scores were: HCT-CI score 0-2 = 53% (16 pts) , \u2265 3 = 47% (14 pts), 1 pt not evaluable; PAM score 9-16 = 30% (10 pts), 17-23 = 67% (19 pts), 24-30 = 3% (1 pt); EBMT score 1 = 9% (3 pts), 2 = 78% (24 pts), 3 = 13% (4 pts). At last follow-up, 42% of pts (n = 13) died: 5 due to disease relapse and 8 because of toxicity. Grade II-IV acute GVHD and chronic GVHD incidence were respectively 26% and 65% (extensive 84%). GVHD was the cause of death in seven pts. The 5-year overall survival (OS), relapse free survival (RFS), and 1-year TRM were 60%, 60%, and 15%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, prognostic scores did not infl uence TRM and OS. Conclusions: This report showed that i) tandem auto-allo is feasible in AML pts; ii) acute GVHD incidence is not increased; iii) prognostic score did not impact on TRM and survival; iv) the TRM is quite low with GVHD as main cause of death. A retrospective comparison with a cohort of pts not receiving HD-PAM is on going.",

Lysak, T. Svoboda, S. Vokurka, V. Koza Charles University Hospital Pilsen (Pilsen, CZ) Background: Outcome of patients (pts) over 60 years of age with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated with intensive chemotherapy is poor. With the aim of improvement of treatment results reduced-intensity transplantation (RIT) was establish as a part of standard treatment strategy for pts older than 60 years with AML in our centre from 2003. To evaluate transplant feasibility and role of RIT in treatment of pts older than 60 years with AML we analysed such treated pts in our centre. As a part of analysis we also tried to evaluate the role of RIT using unrelated donor. Patients and methods: In period 1/2003-9/2009 from 69 intensively treated pts with AML 30 pts with median of age 62 years (range, 60-68 years) with AML in 1.CR (19 pts) or AML beyond 1.CR (11 pts) underwent RIT (40% HLA identical related, 30% HLA matched unrelated, 30% HLA mismatched unrelated). Source of stem cells was peripheral blood and the median of infused CD 34 + cells was 5,79 \u00d7 10 6 /kg (range, 1,89-14,9 \u00d7 10 6 /kg). The conditioning regimen consisted of fl udarabine (30 mg/m\u00b2 for 4 days) and melphalan (140 mg/m\u00b2 for 1 day). Cyclosporine and methotrexate were used as GVHD prophylaxis. Pts transplanted from related or unrelated donors did not differ for any signifi cant variables except for younger age of donors and higher amount of infused CD34 + cells in unrelated RIT. Results : The main reasons of impossibility to implement RIT in treatment of older pts with AML were death during remission induction treatment, non-availability of donor, severe comorbidities and refusal of RIT but 43% of intensively treated pts with AML underwent RIT. All transplanted pts engrafted and achieved complete remission (CR) with full donor chimerism (FDC). 13 pts (43%) developed acute GVHD (3 pts grade III-IV) and among 25 evaluable pts 10 (40%) of them developed chronic GVHD (1 limited, 9 extensive) . With median follow-up 19 months (range, 2-73 months) 17 pts (57%) are alive (16 pts in CR). 5 pts (17%) relapsed and 4 of them died. 9 pts (30%) died due to NRM and 3 (10%) of them till day + 100 after RIT. The estimated probabilities of 4-years EFS and OS are 46% and 48% and the type of donor did not show any significant influence of RIT outcome. Conclusion: Our data show that nearly half of intensively treated pts older than 60 years with AML were able to undergo RIT and that RIT even in case of unrelated or HLA mismatched donor is associated with acceptable NRM and encouraging disease control of unfavourable AML.",

The induced antileukemic T-cell responses are variable both in their specificity and effi cacy. Methods: HLA matched donor T-cells (allogeneic) or autologous T-cells were repeatedly stimulated, either with leukemic blasts or the corresponding DCleu from three different patients with AML. To identify T-cell receptor (TCR) Vbeta-chain-rearrangements in unstimulated and stimulated T-cells, immunoscope spectratyping was performed in CD4 + and CD8 + cells respectively. For functional characterization, fl ow cytometry and non-radioactive fl uorolysis assays were performed. Results: After stimulation with DCleu derived from patient 1 Tcells (allogeneic) showed a lytic activity. In sample 2 (autologous) and 3 (allogeneic) , neither blast-nor DCleu-stimulated T-cells were able to lyse blasts. In sample 1 a CD4:CD8 ratio > 1 was observed in contrary to sample 2 and 3. Spectratyping revealed a restriction of the TCR repertoire in all three cases indicating a specialization of the T cells against the leukemic blasts: After stimulation with DCleu distinct restriction was observed in all CD8 + fractions, while in CD4 + T-cells only sample 1 and 2 showed a restriction after DCleu stimulation. In sample 1 a restriction was also detected after stimulation with blasts in both CD4 + and CD8 + fractions. These variabilities may be explained by the different leukemic antigens or the intraindividual immune response of stimulated T-cells. Furthermore, in the patient 2 an identical TCR-Vbeta sequence was identifi ed in the patients CD8 + T-cell fraction after SCT and the DCleu stimulated T-cell culture. Conclusion: A combined strategy using spectratyping with functional tests may provide useful information about the specifi city and effi cacy of the intraindividual variable induced T-cell response. It seems that CD4 + and CD8 + cells mediate the antileukemic function in combination, however the antileukemic activity was mostly observed at a ratio of CD4:CD8 > 1. Furthermore it may contribute to detect, amplify or monitor T-cell clones (with defi ned Vbeta-profi les) responsible for antileukemic function, in vitro as well as in vivo. The identifi cation of these Vbeta clones may lead to selection procedures generating GvL-(but not GvH) mediating T-cells for individual adoptive immunotherapy.",

Valerius (1) , M. Gramatzki (1) (1) Div. of Stem Cell Transpl. & Immunother. (Kiel, DE) ; (2) Department of Pediatrics (Kiel, DE) Objectives: For patients with relapse of leukemia or lymphoma after fi rst allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) therapeutic options are limited. Here, we report our experience at our unit with second SCT and address particularly the role of a graft from an alternative donor. Methods: Twenty-four patients with a median age of 42 years (range: 6-69) received a second SCT in the relapse situation. Initial diagnoses were AML (14), MDS (4), ALL (4), OMF (1), or CLL (1) . In 17 patients the second transplant was performed from a HLA identical (10/10) donor, whereas 7 received grafts with a minimum of one mismatch. The median interval between the fi rst and second SCT was 398 days (range: 47-1856) and in 13 of the 24 patients (54%) a graft from a different donor was used for the second SCT. Results: The median overall-survival (OS) after second SCT was 220 days. Treatment-related mortality (TRM) was 22%, acute Graft-versus-Host-Disease (aGvHD) was seen in 50% of the patients but only 17% suffered from \u2265 grade 3, and extensive chronic GvHD (cGvHD) occurred in 8%. Relapse was observed in 12 patients. Median time-to-relapse was 227 days (range: 27-717) compared with 274 days (range: 93-1777) after fi rst SCT. However 7 (29%) of the 24 patients after second SCT are still in remission with a median follow up of 526 days. Until now, there is no difference in remission duration but in 4 (57%) of the 7 patients the remission after second SCT is already lasting longer than after the fi rst SCT. The majority of the patients achieving remission received for the second transplantation a reduced intensity conditioning regimen (FLAMSA-RIC) and in 5 of these an alternative donor had donated. In these patients with sustained remission the rate of extended cGvHD was low There is some debate for a conditioning regimen with busulfan and fl udarabine (BF) in malignant lymphoid diseases. This study evaluated the outcomes of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) conditioned with BF compared with BuCy2 in lymphoid malignancies. The results of allogeneic SCT for 47 patients diagnosed with lymphoid malignancies were retrospectively reviewed. Thirty-three patients were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 4 lymphoblastic lymphoma, and 10 acute mixed leukemia. Conditioning regimen was BuCy2 for 18 patients and BF for 29. Eighteen (62.1%) and 13 (72.2%) patients were high risk diseases including 8 (27.6%) and 2 (11.1%) Ph + ALL cases in BF and BuCy2 group, respectively (P = 0.475) . The 3-year overall survival (OS) rate was 50.5% and 31.8% in standard and high risk group, respectively (P = 0.156) . The 3-year OS rate was higher for the patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) than those without chronic GVHD (50.3% vs. 29 .6%; P = 0.004). The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD (47.1% vs. 70 .8%) and extensive chronic GVHD (23.4% vs. 49 .7%) were signifi cantly lower in BF group than BuCy2 group (P = 0.040 and P = 0.037, respectively). The 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 28.0% in BF and 49.0% in BuCy2 group (P = 0.277) . ) and event-free survival (EFS; 40.0% vs. 25.9%) were not different between BF group and BuCy2 group. However, the treatment related mortality (TRM) was signifi cantly lower in BF group (16.5% ) than BuCy2 group (50.1%; P = 0.035). After adjusting age, conditioning intensity, donor type (sibling vs. unrelated), HLA disparity (full match vs. mismatch), and acute GVHD, the BF regimen was an independent favorable risk factor for the TRM (hazard ratio 0.036. 95% confi dence interval 0.002-0.557; P = 0.017).",

Chiozzotto, R. Fanin University Hospital (Udine, IT) Scarce data are available regarding allogeneic SCT (allo-SCT) in elderly Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients. We report on the feasibility and outcome of allo-SCT in 30 poor risk AML patients (pts) older than 60 years. Median age at transplant was 63 years (range 60-70 years) and 18/30 (60%) cases were in complete remission. Donor were MUD in 12 (40%) and sibling in 18 (60%) of 30 cases. Twenty-six of 30 pts (87%) received a reduced intensity conditioning regimen (RIC). The hematopoietic cell transplantation specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI) was two or less in 12/30 cases (40%) and three or more in 18/30 cases (60%). All patients engrafted. One year Nonrelapse mortality (NRM) rate was 20% (6/30 cases). After a median follow-up of 16 months (range 1-64), 17/30 patients (57%) were alive and in complete remission while 13/30 (43%) have died (leukemia refractory or relapse 7/13 and NRM 6/13). Median Overall Survival (OS) for the whole patient population was 28 months. The OS did not differ between unrelated and related donors. The patients transplanted in complete remission have a significantly lower relapse rate compared to those transplanted with refractory or relapsed AML (P = 0,008). The cases with a low HCT-CI (2 or less) have a significantly lower NRM (P = 0,05) compared to those with HCT-CI 3 or more. Taking into account that this is a retrospective analysis with a small number of cases, these results confi rm the feasibility of allo-SCT for high risk AML patients older than 60 years. Outcome was signifi cantly infl uenced by status of disease at transplant and by HCT-CI. We also confi rm that for older patients lacking a suitable family donor MUD can provide a suitable alternative option.",

Cuore (Rome, IT) ; (2) \"La Sapienza \" University (Rome, IT); (3) Ospedale SanCamilloForlanini (Rome, IT); (4) Ospedale Santa Maria Goretti (Latina, IT) Several trials have suggested the potential utility of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) of the elderly and the introduction of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) has reduced morbidity and mortality of the procedure. However the role of ASCT in AML is still a concern expecially in patients > 60 years, and prospective randomized trials are lacking and diffi cult to perform. We report the results of a retrospective multicenter study on 32 patients (15M/17F ) aged > 60 years with AML, who underwent an ASCT in 1st CR between May 1995 and May 2009. Patients' characteristics were as follows: the median age of the patients was 62 years (range 60-68). The median WBC at diagnosis was 4.2 \u00d7 10 9 /L (range 0.9-162). Cytogenetic alterations were found in 6 out 32 pts (2 complex karyotype, 1 t(8;21), 1tris13, 1 tris8, t(11;19) , while 16 pts showed a normal karyotype; in the remaining patients it was not evaluable. Foure out of 19 patients evaluable for molecular analysis showed low risk features (2 AML-ETO, 1 MYH11-CBFB, 1 NPM mutation). The conditioning regimens most used were: BAVC (10pts) and BuCy (14pts). Stem cells sources were PBSC in 29 pts, BM in 2 pts and PBSC + BM in 1 pt. The median dose of CD 34 + cells reinfused/kg was 3.70 \u00d7 10 6 (range 1.85-17) . The median time to granulocyte recovery > 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L was 13 days (range 9-43) and for platelets > 20 and > 50 \u00d7 10 9 /L was 14 (range 8-60) and 21 days (range 12-210) respectively. All but one patient achieved independence from RBC and platelets transfusions (96.8%). Mucosae toxicity grade 3-4 was observed in 5/32 pts (15%). The transplant related mortality was 3.1% and the cause of death was sepsi. After a median follow-up of 2.7 years from transplantation, the median DFS and OS were 48% and 50% years respectively, and the 10-year rates were 42% and 50% respectively (see . Twelve autografted patients are still in complete remission, 16 have relapsed and 3 had died in remission (1 a second neoplasia, 1 cerebral hemorrhage and 1 sepsi from resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa early after transplantation). The long follow up of our data confi rms that intensifi cation of remission including ASCT is a feasible and encouraging therapeutic approach, characterized by low transplant related mortality and providing the possibility of long survivorship characterized by low transplant related mortality and the possibility of long survivorship in selected elderly AML patients.",

Espigado Hospital Virgen del Rocio (Sevilla, ES) Background: Prognosis of patients (pts) with relapse after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is poor. A second HSCT might be an option in selected pts although treatment related mortality (TRM) is a major concern. Objectives: Retrospective analysis of overall survival (OS) and TRM of second HSCT in hematologic malignancies. To identify prognostic factors that infl uence the outcome. Patients and methods: From September 1989 to June 2009, 44 pts received a second HSCT. Median age was 38y , 25 were male and 19 female. Diagnoses were: 18 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), 7 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 5 acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL), 4 hodgkin lymphoma (HL), 5 non-hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 3 chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), 2 solid neoplasms. Autologous SCT was carried out in 10 patients and allogeneic SCT in 34 pts, of which 19 received myeloablative conditioning and 25 reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). Graft source was bone marrow in 4 pts, peripheral blood in 39 pts and cord blood unit in 1 pt. From the initial cohort, we selected a group of 30 patients with AML, MDS and ALL. Median age in this group was 37 y . Disease status previous second HSCT: 11/ 30 pts were in complete remission (CR\u00a1\u00dd2) and 19/30 had either partial response (PR) or progressive disease (PD). 25/30 pts received alloSCT and 5/30 pts autoSCT. Conditioning regimen was myeloablative in 12 pts and RIC in 18 pts. The source graft was bone marrow in 3 pts and peripheral blood in 27 pts. Results: The OS rate was 24.5% at 41 months follow-up in the global group and 19% in the 30-patients cohort. A higher survival rate was observed in pts whose time interval between the fi rst and the second transplant was more than 1 year (OS 43% at 18 months versus 9% OS for pts with time interval less than a year, P < 0,01). 1-year OS in AML pts in RC = or > 2 was 40% vs. 0% for AML pts in PR or PD (P < 0,02) . No difference in OS was observed comparing both types of conditioning regimen. In the 30-patient cohort the TRM was 36% and 33% in AML patients. Conclusion: Despite low long-term OS after the second HSCT, this may be an option in these high risk pts. The remission status at the time of a second transplant and a time interval between both transplants of more than a year, seem to be determinant of the outcome.",

Koza, P. Jindra, M. Karas, D. Lysak, T. Svoboda, S. Vokurka Charles University Hospital (Pilsen, CZ) The prognosis of the patients (pts) with AML relapsed after stem cell transplantation (SCT) is dismal. We describe treatment and outcomes for patients who relapse following SCT and compare the outcome of the group of pts transplanted with myeloablative and with reduced intensity conditioning regimen (RIC). Materials and methods: In a retrospective single center study we analyzed 167 pts (96 pts after myeloablative and 71 pts after RIC SCT) with high risk AML transplanted between the years 1993 and 2009. 29 pts (30%) relapsed after myeloablative SCT and 15 pts (21%) relapsed after RIC SCT (P = 0,2161). Median of relaps was 4 months in the group of myeloablative SCT (1-49 months) and 5 months in the group of RIC SCT (P = 0,1845) . Both groups were comparable according to disease status, prognostic factors and the donor type (HLA identical sibling vs. unrelated donor, P = 0,3401) with the only difference of age. In the group myeloablative regimen the median age was 40 (21-55 years) and in the group of RIC SCT 55(29-66 years), P = 0,0015. 22 pts (50%) received aggressive treatment for relapse (14/29 and 8/15, P = 1,0) including donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) (11/29 and 6/15, P = 1,0), chemotherapy (2/29 and 2/15, P = 0.5962), second transplantation (2/29 and 0/15, P = 0.5402). Results: 7 pts (16%) archieved complete response(CR) after treatment for relapse (5 pts after DLI with or without chemotherapy and 2 pts after second transplantation), 2 pts after RIC SCT and 5 pts after myeloablative SCT, P = 1,0. 2 pts still alive (1 from group of myeloablative SCT and 1 from group of RIC SCT) 15 and 51 months after SCT with median of overall suvival (OS) 5 months after myeloablative SCT and 7 month after RIC SCT, the probability of 1 year OS 31% and 33% (P = 0,5216) . 42 pts died, most of them due to disease progression (40/44, 91%), 1 pts died due to GVHD after DLI and 1 pts due to respiratory failure. We did not observe difference in the outcome among pts treated with DLI, chemotherapy and second transplantation. Conclusion: Salvage chemotherapy or cellular therapy for AML relapse after SCT is feasible with low treatment-related mortality, but optimal management of the therapy for AML relapsing after SCT still remains to be defi ned. Comparing the group of pts transplanted with myeloablative regimen and pts transplanted with RIC no statistical signifi cant difference (except of age) were found, however our results suggest better OS for patients relapsing after RIC SCT.",

Aljurf (1) (1)King Faisal Specialist Hospital (Riyadh, SA); (2)Royal Free Hospital (London, UK) Introduction: T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) accounts for approximately 20% of adult ALL. Historically, T-ALL had a worse outcome compared to other ALL. Recent studies suggest improved outcome with the use of intensive treatment. High risk (HR) patients (pts) are often candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Patients and methods: We analyzed outcomes of 56 consecutive pts (58 transplants) who underwent allogenic HSCT at King Faisal Specialist Hospital from 01/1995 to 07/2009 for HR T-ALL. HR features included: WBCs \u2265 100,000, residual disease at D14 post induction, CNS involvement at diagnosis, poor risk cytogenetic features, primary induction failure (PIF) & disease relapse. Results: Median age was 18 yr (range, 13-51). Male: female ratio was 6:1. T-cell subtypes were pro-T (n = 1, 1.8%), pre-T (n = 21, 37.5%), cortical-T cell (n = 16, 28.6%), mature-T cell (n = 12, 21.4%) and unknown (n = 6, 10.7%). Disease status at transplant: CR1 with HR features at diagnosis (n = 28, 50%), primary induction failure (PIF) (n = 6, 10.7%), \u2265 second complete remission (CR2) (n = 18, 32%) and relapsed disease (n = 4, 7.1%). HLA matched sibling donor was the main donor type. Stem cell source was Bone marrow (n = 40, 69%), peripheral blood (n = 17, 29%) or cord blood (n = 1, 2%). Acute (\u2265 grade) II and chronic GVHD occurred in 38% and 29%, respectively. Thirty pts died, 18 with relapse and 12 secondary to HSCT complications. Transplant related mortality at D100 was 10. 7% . With a median follow up of 13 months (rang, 1-168) the estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) were both 39%. Cortical cell subtype had a trend for a better OS (54%) compared with other cell subtypes but this was not statistically signifi cant. Pts transplanted in CR1 had statistically signifi cant superior OS and DFS compared with those transplanted in > CR1 (50.8% vs. 29 .3% p value = 0.03 and 52.4% vs. 26% p value = 0.007, respectively). Seventeen pts had c GVHD. Patients with cGVHD had a trend for lower risk of relapse compared with those without cGVHD (23% vs. 44%, respectively), but this was not statistically signifi cant. No signifi cant differences in OS and DFS among different age groups were observed. Conclusion: Allogeneic HSCT represents an effective treatment for HR T-ALL particularly if performed in CR1. The presence of clinically relevant GVL effect needs further evaluation.",

Autologous transplantation has also shown encouraging long-term survival results in patients who do not have HLA-matched donors. We retrospectively analyzed our results and role of possible prognostic factors. Material and methods: Fifty-two patients who underwent allogeneic or autologous transplantation either upfront or in relapsed setting were included in this study from March 1983 to September 2009. Patients underwent autologous transplant only if an HLA-matched related donor was not available. Conditioning regimens included busulfan-cyclophosphamide in 27, cyclophosphamide-total body irradiation (TBI) in 16, highdose melphalan in 4, fl udarabine -busulfan in 3, Fludarabine with 2 Gy TBI in 1 and busulfan-etoposide-cyclophosphamide in 1 patient. Baseline cytogenetic analysis was not available for most patients. Prognostic factors evaluated for overall survival (OS) in those who underwent allogeneic transplant were disease status at transplant, presence of acute or chronic GVHD, donor-recipient sex match and ABO compatibility. Results: Fifty-two patients were evaluated, 43 in allogeneic and 9 in autologous setting. At the time of allogeneic transplant, 25 were in fi rst remission (CR-1), 12 in second remission (CR-2) and 6 in refractory state, while in autologous setting, 8 were in CR-1 and 1 in CR-2.Median age at transplant was 27 years. Median time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment was 14 and 15 days respectively. Fifty-three percent and 46% of allogeneic transplants were sex and ABO mismatched respectively. The incidence of acute and chronic GVHD was 42% and 19% respectively. Incidence of veno-occlussive disease was 11.5%. Two patients relapsed after autologous transplant while 13 relapsed after allogeneic transplant. The transplant -related mortality (TRM) after autologous and allogeneic transplantation were 22% and 28% respectively. The cumulative probabilities of OS after allogeneic and autologous transplant at 5 years were 38% and 50% respectively. None of the above prognostic factors evaluated infl uenced OS in allogeneic transplant setting. Conclusion: This is the fi rst report of long-term survival post transplant for AML from India that shows encouraging OS and patients who do not have an HLA-matched donor may still have long-term benefi t from autologous transplant in fi rst remission.",

Chiou Koo Foundation Sun Yat-Sen Cancer Center (Taipei, TW) Purpose: For relapsed or refractory acute leukemia, the curative treatment of choice is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation if patients could tolerate transplant therapy feasibly and an HLA mutched donor available. If not, patients could just go into S95 clinical trial with novel agents or supportive care. However, the transplant related morbidity and mortality is higher and the eventfree and overall survival are worse than patient in remission. Materials and methods: We evaluated our 20 patients who are relapsed or refractory acute leukemia after the treatment of remission induction and high dose Ara-C and mitoxantrone (HAM) chemotherapy or prior autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation between February 2004 and October 2009. All these patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with matched related or unrelated donor. Results: Twenty patients included 11 male and 9 female with median age 40.8 years old (range 21~60). Diagnosis included AML (N = 15, including 4 therapy-related), ALL (N = 3), and CML-BP (n = 2). There were 16 patients (80%) having undergone high dose Ara-C plus mitoxantrone (HAM) chemotherapy. Four patients (20%) had had prior transplant treatment. Four patients were graft failure and died in 1 month. For the other 15 evaluable patients, 5 patients were leukemia free but one of them died of pulmonary invasive aspergillosis. Posttransplant relapse occurred in 10 patients (66.7%), but in 7 patients underwent salvage chemotherapy alone (n = 1) or salvage chemotherapy plus donor leukocyte infusion (n = 6) with 5 leukemia-free achieved. In general, 9 patients died of leukemia, 3 patients died of infection, and 1 patients died of unknown cause of hepatic failure. Three year event-free survival is 22% and overall survival 23%. Conclusions: As expected, the relapse rate is very high and most patients died of leukemia itself but some patients still could be salvaged by re-chemotherapy plus CD34-riched donor leukocyte infusion or second transplantation. Therefore, the plan of programmed prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusion is mandatory.",

Bonaf\u00e9 (1) (1)University of Bologna (Bologna, IT) ; (2) S. Orsola-Malpighi Hospital (Bologna, IT) HSCT is a complex procedure including several life-threatening steps. The success at each step contributes to the global outcome. Some studies have already shown the association of single polymorphisms with GVHD, toxicity, OS, with contrasting results. HSCT outcome may be considered as polygenic quantitative trait, where multiple genes play a role and may also affect different phenotypes (pleiotropy) at different times. Nowadays, high throughput technology allows to simultaneously assay a large amount of genetic variations (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) at various loci. DNA obtained from 176 patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT between 2004 to 2008 for hematologic malignancies were assessed for genetic polymorphisms at 92 polymorphisms inside 34 genomic loci (Table 1) . Genes were chosen on the basis of their capacity to affect liver drug metabolism and oxidative stress response homeostatic pathway, such as glutathion and folate homeostasis, cytocrome oxidase system, ABC cassettes membrane transporters. Median age of the study population was 41 years, 43% were in early phase at transplant, 51% BM were BM, 47% were unrelated donor transplants, 65% received a myeloablative regimen. Genotypes were assessed by MaldiTOF (Mass analysis light desorption-time of light) SequenomTM technology. TRM and OS were chosen as endpoints of the study. Each polymorphism was evaluated in univariate and multivariate analysis, by Cox model incorporating also age, type of donor, intensity of conditioning, phase at transplant as covariates. Multivariate analysis was also performed to assess synergistic effects among multiple polymorphisms. Some of the most representative TRM curves are shown in Figure 1 . Multivariate analysis revealed significant association between TRM and polymorphisms at MTHFR (hazard risk, HR = 2.3), ABCC4 (HR = 3.6 ), GSTM1 (HR = 2.5) loci; a significant increase in the HR for ABCC4 and GSTM1 polymorplysm was found when simultaneuously tested in multivariate analysis. Subgroup analysis according to conditioning regimens revealed drug specific association between polymorphism and TRM and OS (eg CYP3A4 polymorphism was associated with OS in cyclophosphamidetreated patients). Our results shows that the individual genetic makeup may explain part of the inter-patient variability thus predicting the outcome of HSCT. External validations are requested to extend this approach to clinical use.",

For Iranian patients, best available donor sources are full matched relatives (including siblings, parents, and other relatives), one locus mismatched relatives, and unrelated cord blood from Iranian Cord Blood Bank. Many patients have no suitable donor from above mentioned sources and have no availability to abroad stem cell sources. Besides, unrelated donor search, confi rmatory typing, and collection and delivery of cells as a whole is a time consuming process and for many patients, we have no enough time; haploidentical stem cell transplantation could be a life saving option in such cases. Patients and methods: From 2007 to 2009, we performed 19 haploidentical transplantations by in vivo T cell depletion. Patients were high risk acute leukemia (14), Osteopetrosis, (2) , type VI Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) (1), Leucocyte Adhesion Defi ciency (LAD) (1) and Severe Combined Immune Defi ciency (SCID) (1) . Conditioning regimen consisted of standard Busulfan/Cyclophosphamide plus CAMPATH (4 patients) or ATG (14 patients). SCID and LAD patients received Fludarabine, Melphalan, and ATG. GVHD prophylaxis regimen consisted of Cyclosporin A plus Methotrexate. Target cell dose was 6-10 \u00d7 10 8 G-CSF primed bone marrow and/or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The donors were non inherited maternal antigen (NIMA) mismatched group siblings, mothers, daughter, or fathers. Results: Six months and one year overall survival was 42% and 33% respectively.

Eisfeld (1) , S. Leiblein (1) , U. G. Liebert (1) , M. Hehme (3) , D. Niederwieser (1) (1)University of Leipzig (Leipzig, DE) ; (2) LifeSciences LLC (La Jolla, US) ; (3) Novartis Oncology (Nuremberg, DE) Hepcidin (hep) is the key regulator of iron homeostasis. As its transcription is normally upregulated by iron and transfusionrelated iron overload is frequent in AML patients (pts) undergoing HCT we analysed the role of chemotherapy, conditioning regimen, liver and renal function and Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) on hep expression in AML pts undergoing HCT. Also the correlation of hep with blood transfusions (BT), body iron and anemia was studied. Patients and methods: 42 consecutive pts (23 male/19 female, median age 57 years) with AML who underwent HCT from February, 2008 -February, 2009 at the University of Leipzig were included. Each patient was assessed 10 days prior to and 3 months after HCT. Donors were matched related in 8 (19%) and matched unrelated (MUD) in 34 (81%) pts. Preparative regimen consisted of 12 Gy TBI/cyclophosphamid 120 mg/kg in 13 (31%) and fl udarabin 30 mg/m 2 /day for 3 days/2 Gy TBI) in 29 (69%) pts. Acute GvHD > grade II was present in 13 (31%) and chronic GvHD in 17 (40%) pts. Body iron was assessed by serum ferritin (SF) (normal < 400 ng/mL). Serum hep was measured by C-ELISA at Intrinsic LifeSciences LLC, La Jolla, CA. (normal: male 29-254, female: 17-286 ng/mL). Results: Iron overload was present in all pts prior to HCT with a median SF of 1945 (range: 617-6981)ng/mL after a median of 22 units BT. SF prior to HCT correlated with limited (P = 0.06) and extensive chronic GvHD (P = 0.003). Median hep was much higher in pts both prior to and after HCT [median 398 (range: 172-941) ng/ml] compared to normal values (P < 0.0001). Age and gender had no infl uence on hep. Also, prior chemotherapies, conditioning regimen, liver and renal function or antifungal-treatment had no impact on hep levels. Hep signifi cantly correlated with BT (P = 0.001) and inversely with the degree of anemia (P = 0.002) but not with SF values. Hep levels prior to or after HCT did not correlate with acute or chronic GvHD. Conclusions: The highly elevated hep in iron overloaded AML pts undergoing HCT suggests that despite intensive chemotherapy and HCT hepcidin synthesis and upregulation remain intact. Hep normally leads to a reduction of extracellular serum iron, this may be why serum hep correlates with blood transfusions but not with serum ferritin. Hep might have an important protective role in the setting of HCT as it might prevent an increased iron export from macrophages thereby reducing the parenchymal iron loading and damage. studied 70 adult patients who received their fi rst allo-HSCT at our institution. Twenty patients were diagnosed as having hemophagocytosis (HP group), while 50 were not (non-HP group). There were no signifi cant differences in patient characteristics between the two groups. Neurological symptoms, weight gain, hypoxia, jaundice, and elevated serum creatinine were more frequently observed among the HP group than the non-HP group, with fever and elevated AST tending to be more frequent in the HP group than in the non-HP group. The incidence of graft failure was higher in the HP group than in the non-HP group (30% vs. 0%, P < 0.01) and hematopoietic recovery was slower in the HP group than in the non-HP group (P < 0.01). The incidence of engraftment syndrome and graft-versus-host disease did not differ between the two groups. The 2-year overall survival (OS) for the HP group and the non-HP group was 30% and 63% (P < 0.01), respectively, and 2-year nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 54% and 31% (P < 0.01), respectively. Multivariate analysis confi rmed that the HP group was associated with a lower OS (hazard ratio (HR), 2.3 ; 95% confi dence interval (CI), 1.1-4.9 ; P = 0.03) and higher NRM (HR, 3.5 ; 95% CI, 1.3-9.0 ; P = 0.01), whereas it was not associated with a relapse rate. The HP group had higher incidence of death due to graft failure (P < 0.01 ) and endothelial complications such as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome and transplant associated microangiopathy (P < 0.01). In conclusion, the early macrophage activation is an important complication with a signifi cant impact on outcomes of allo-HSCT.",

Masetti, A. Prete, R. Rondelli, V. Gentile, E. Franzoni, A. Pession Sant'Orsola Malpighi Hospital (Bologna, IT) Introduction: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a clinico-neuroradiologic entity represented by symptoms like headache, seizures, visual disturbances and an imaging pattern showing cortical and subcortical edema primarily involving posterior regions of the brain. PRES is a possible complication in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) patients (Pts) treated with immunosuppressive agents. Status Epilepticus (SE) is defi ned as seizure activity lasting 30 minutes or more. Although seizures are a well known manifestation of children with PRES, SE has rarely been described in this setting. Patients and methods: We reviewed 13 episodes of SE in 10 Pts receiving allo-HSCT aged 1 to 17 years (Table 1) with MRI confi rmed diagnosis of PRES. We evaluated data on demographics, etiology of PRES, clinical presentation, seizure semeiology, EEG studies, response to antiepileptic drugs, neuroimaging and outcome. Results: Pts developed PRES with a median time of onset after allo-HSCT of 58 days (range 5-116). In 8/10 Pts SE was the presenting symptom of PRES. Three Pts had two SE during the course of the disease. Nonconvulsive SE involving posterior regions of the brain (confi rmed by EEG monitoring) was observed in 4 cases; convulsive SE was observed in 9 cases. Gaze deviation, oculoclonic movements, nystagmus and altered mental status were the main clinical signs during nonconvulsive SE and preceded convulsive SE in 5/9 cases. SE was responsive to fi rst line drugs (midazolam and/or phenytoin) in 12/13 events but 7/10 Pts needed intensive care admission. Early EEG abnormalities after resolution of SE were prevalent in posterior derivations and consisted in periodic epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) in 8 cases and focal slowing in 5. All Pts showed clinical, EEG and neuroimaging improvement after SE and withdrawal of causative agent. Conclusions: SE is probably an under-recognized event in allo-HSCT children with PRES. In most of our Pts, SE was the fi rst sign of PRES and the onset of the SE was characterized by Introduction: Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) is the most common late non-infectious pulmonary complication after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). It is usually part of systemic manifestation of chronic graft-versus-hostdisease (GVHD) but may also be an isolated pulmonary complication. Early detection of airway obstruction on pulmonary function test (PFT) may predict the development of BO and help in early management to prevent development of advanced BO syndrome with respiratory failure. Objectives: To identify potential early predictors for the development of obstructive airway disease (OAD) in post HSCT patients.",

Pre and post HSCT PFTs were analyzed. Standard American Thoracic Society (ATS) Guidelines for changes in PFTs parameters were used to indicate signifi cant changes. Results: Of 580 transplants performed during the study period. 49 patients had serial PFTs were studied to identify potential early predictors for development of OAD post HSCT. Early in the post HSCT, no signifi cant changes occurred in PFT parameters (FEV1, MEF 25-75, RV, and TLC). However RV/ TLC ratio was noted to be signifi cantly increased in the 1st post HSCT PFT assessment (mean increase in value was 10.88%) Table (1) . Subsequent statistical analysis of PFTs suggested that patients with abnormal RV/TLC ratio on their fi rst post HSCT assessment developed a progressive decline in other parameters of OAD like decreased MEF, decreased FEV1, and increased TLC in addition to further deterioration of RV/TLC ratio. Conclusion: Our study identifi ed an early objective sign of developing BO in the form of airfl ow limitation with increase RV/TLC ratio. Conventionally acceptable changes of OAD like decreased FEV1, decreased MEF and increased TLC took much longer time to occur. Prospective studies are required to evaluate this further and to study whether early therapeutic intervention at this stage will have any impact on the outcome of patients who develop BO post HSCT.",

Kata, T. Czerw, G. Helbig, S. Kyrcz-Krzemien Silesian Medical University (Katowice, PL) Introduction: Isolated extramedullary relapses (IER) are increasingly reported as late complications after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) for leukemias. However, the optimal treatment for IER following alloHSCT remains uncertain. Objectives and methods: We retrospectively analysed incidence, treatment options and long-term outcome of this mode of leukemia recurrence in a cohort of 532 consecutive pts (123 with ALL, 201 with AML, 208 with CML) who underwent alloHSCT in our institution between June 1993 and December 2007. 79 pts (34 with ALL, 28 with AML, 17 with CML) relapsed (any site). Results: 9 (11%) out of all pts who relapsed (4 with B-line ALL, 4 with AML, 1 with CML, F/M 4/5, median age 29 years, range 28 -44 years) developed IER after a median time of 17 months (mts) (range, 8-80 mts) following alloHSCT. We revealed complete donor chimerism in 7/9 studied pts. 4 pts (3 with ALL, 1 with AML) developed skin and/or subcutaneous tissue infi ltrates; in one of them ( patient with ALL) leukemic tumor of the peritibial soft tissues was additionally observed. Other sites of IER included (No. of cases/diagnosis): leptomeninges of the brain (1/Ph + ALL), paraspinal soft tissues (1/AML), small intestine and the root of mesentery (1/AML), inguinal lymph nodes (1/AML), paranasal sinuses (1/AML). Treatment plans for those IER included (No. of cases/diagnosis): 1/involved-fi eld radiotherapy (IF-RT) followed by chemotherapy (CHT) and interferon-alpha (2/ALL), 2/imatinib + cHT + steroids and methotrexate intrathecally (1/Ph + ALL), 3/imatinib + cHT (1/Ph + ALL), 4/CHT (2/AML), 5/dasatinib (1/CD117 + AML,), 6/surgery (1/AML), 7/surgery + IF-RT (1/CML). 7/9 patients died after a median time of 10 mts (range, 1-30) due to resistant systemic relapse and/or infectious complications, 2/9 are currently under CHT. Conclusions. Our data indicate that isolated extramedullary disease following allo-HSCT occurs predominantly in acute leukemia pts, being rarely observed in pts with CML. Sites of extramedullary infi ltrates vary widely among the pts with skin and/or subcutaneous tissue being frequently involved. Local radiation therapy seems to be effective treatment option, but it does not prevent from systemic relapse and should be followed by other therapeutic modalities. According to our experience occurrence of IER following alloHSCT is associated with poor prognosis and the optimal therapy remains a challenge.",

ASCT is generally well tolerated with a treatment related mortality of under 5-10%. Complications are more likely in the elderly patients or in those with comorbidities. We aimed to investigate the incidence of early cardiac complications (ECC) in patients > 60 undergoing ASCT for Hodgkin's (HL) and Non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL). Methods: We retrospectively analysed records of patients > 60 who underwent ASCT with a BCNU/ Lamustine + etoposide + ara-c + melphalan/cyclophosphamide (BEAM, LEAM or BEAC) based regimen in 2 centres between 1982 and 2009. Results: We analysed a total of 76 patients 51 (67%) males, 25 (33%) females aged 60-69 (median 64) transplanted for HL 6(7.9%), NHL 70(92.1%), T cell 5(6.6%), high grade B cell, including transformation from low grade NHL 40 (52.7%), follicular 14 (18.4%), mantle cell 9 (11.8%), lymphoblastic 2 (2.6%). Seventy two (94.8%) of patients had BEAM conditioning, 3 (3.9%) LEAM and 1(1.3%) BEAC. Past medical history (PMH) was available in 37 (48.7%). The median left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 59% (38-75%) and 5 (6.5%) patients had a history of cardiac disease. Patients received a median of 2 (1) (2) (3) (4) prior lines of chemotherapy and 35/37 (94.5%) of patients had had an anthracycline pre- ASCT. Overall 13 (17.1% ) had ECC post-ASCT: 5 Atrial fi brillation (AF) and atrial fl utter, 1 AF and congestive cardiac failure (CCF), 1 AF and pericardial effusion, 3 supraventricular tachycardia, 1 sinus bradycardia, 1 ventricular arrhythmia (VA), 1 pericardial effusion. Four cases of arrhythmia coincided with sepsis and 1 case of VA was related to HL insertion. Overall, 15.8% experienced arrhythmias, 2.6% pericardial effusion, 1.3% CCF. One patient required intensive care admission but none of these ECC resulted in death. 3/5(60%) of patients with a documented cardiac PMH, vs. 5/32(15.6% ) without had ECC post transplant (P = 0.056). There was no difference in pre ASCT LVEF in those who developed ECC compared to those who didn't (P = 0.80). Conclusion: We report a rate of ECC of 17.1% in patients aged over 60 post ASCT for lymphoma. The most common ECC was AF; none of the ECC were fatal. A prior history of cardiac dis-ease was associated with an increased risk of ECC but ejection fraction was not. Physicians need to be aware of the risk of ECC in this setting especially in patients with a prior history of cardiac disease.",

Glucocorticoid treatment of chronic GvHD was ongoing in 9 pts, and 10 pts were on systemic hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Healthy women (n = 26), 3 of them being on HRT, served as controls. In both groups, HRT was stopped 24h before blood sampling. Serum testosterone concentrations were determined using a modifi ed RIA with a sensitivity of 0.03 nM. Free testosterone was calculated from the serum concentrations of testosterone, albumin and SHBG. The analyses were performed in the entire groups of pts (SCT group) and controls, and also in two age cohorts: < 50 yrs (n = 12 + 12), and \u2265 50 yrs (n = 13 + 14). For comparisons Wilcoxon\u00b4s rank-sum test was applied. Results: The SCT group and controls were excellently matched for age (median 51 vs. 52 yrs), weight (67 vs. 65 kg), and salbumin (40 vs. 41 g/L). Compared to fi ndings in the control group, free testosterone was signifi cantly lower in SCT pts < 50 yrs (median 3.0 vs. 7.2 pM; P = 0.03) , and also in pts \u2265 50 yrs (3.1 vs. 8.2 ; P = 0.008). Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) was lower in the entire group of SCT pts (median 0.7 vs. 2.5 uM; P = 0.0007) , the difference versus controls was signifi cant also in pts < 50 years (P = 0.006), but not in pts \u2265 50 yrs (P = 0.08). Oestradiol was signifi cantly lower in SCT pts < 50 yrs (median 50 vs. 328 pM; P = 0.002). Levels of SHBG in the < 50 yrs cohort were lower (median 55 vs. 85 nM; P = 0.02) in SCT pts, with no difference in subjects \u2265 50 yrs. LH and FSH were signifi cantly higher in younger SCT pts as compared with controls. Summary: Free serum testosterone was signifi cantly reduced in both younger and elderly allografted women. This new observation indicates that low androgen production after allo-SCT is a common late effect in women. The fi nding of low DHEAS concentrations suggests that not only ovarian dysfunction contributes to low testosterone levels, but also a reduced adrenal steroid production. The low testosteron production after SCT is likely to be associated with sexual dysfunction and reduced QoL.",

Maruta (1) (1)Kanagawa Cancer Center (Yokohama, JP); (2)Nagoya University (Nagoya, JP); (3) Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine (Yokohama, JP) Background: Recent studies have suggested that iron overload is one of important predictors for outcome in allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). We studied prognostic variables including serum ferritin (SF) in patients receiving SCT and created a new scoring system for predicting allogeneic SCT outcome in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Patients and methods: We analyzed 119 patients with AML or MDS who underwent allogeneic SCT at Kanagawa Cancer Center between January 2000 and December 2008. The following preand post-SCT variables were collected: age, sex, pre-SCT serum ferritin (SF), disease type, disease status at transplantation, conditioning regimen, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis regimen, donor type and stem cell source, use of prednisolone within 100 days after SCT, acute GVHD, and chronic GVHD. The log-rank test was used for comparisons of Kaplan-Meier curves. Cox model was used for multivariate analyses. Results: SF was categorized as low-SF (< 1000 ng/ml) and high (\u2265 1000 ng/ml) in accordance with the median value (973 ng/ml). In univariate analysis, variables associated with poorer overall survival (OS) included high-SF (vs. low-SF, P < .0001), active disease at transplantation (vs. remission, P < .0001), unrelated donor (vs. related donor, P = .0039), use of prednisolone (vs. no use, P = .0054), grade II-IV acute GVHD (vs. grade 0-I, P = .0361). High-SF and active disease at transplantation were signifi cantly adverse variables for 5-y OS and disease free survival (DFS) by multivariate analysis. Furthermore, patients with high-SF showed a signifi cantly higher cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality and relapse compared with those with low-SF. Active disease at transplantation was the signifi cant risk factor associated with increased relapse. Both variables were assigned a score and its sum was used for the prognostic score. This defi ned 3 risk groups, low (score = 0), intermediate (score = 1), and high (score = 2). The 5-y OS in low (n = 41), intermediate (n = 47), and high risk group (n = 31) was 78%, 50% and 14%, respectively (P < .0001). 5-y DFS in each group was 68%, 48% and 12%, respectively (P < .0001) . Conclusions: This simple scoring system may be useful for predicting the outcome in patients with AML or MDS undergoing allogeneic SCT, although its validation should be performed in other large population.",

Kleber, J. Finke, G. Zuercher Albert Ludwigs University Medical Center (Freiburg, DE) Many risk factors for increased morbidity and mortality in allogeneic transplantation have been recognized actually measured and classifi ed for example by the Sorror-Index. The nutritional status before transplantation may as well be a predictor for survival. We therefore analyzed retrospectively the values for the body mass index (BMI, weight in kg/height in m\u00b2), albumin and C-reactive protein (CRP) in all 997 consecutive pts. between 1998 and 2008 at the day of admission for alloHCT. Albumin is a marker for poor nutrition status, which shows conjunction to the protein balance of the patient and CRP as acute phase protein is associated with tumour cachexia. Univariate analysis for the overall survival according the three measures at day + 100, one year and three years post HCT using the log rank test in SPSS\u00ae was performed. Results: The statistical analysis of the BMI (in median 24,7 kg/m\u00b2) at the three time points shows no signifi cant difference comparing pts. with a BMI below and above the median. It shows a trend to better survival in pts. with a BMI above the median at one year (P = 0.058). The median albumin is 4,2 g/dl; pts. with an albumin value at admission > the median had a high signifi cant survival advantage at all three time points (P < 0.001). As well pts. with a CRP < 3 g/dl (median value) at admission had a signifi cant better probability of survival at day + 100, one year and three years post HCT (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Preconditioning albumin and C-reactive protein values signifi cantly predict overall survival after alloHCT. They may be associated with an impaired nutritional status at HCT, but as well albumin and CRP may refl ect the severity of illness showing an acute phase reaction. The BMI alone is not a suffi cient predictor. Multivariate analysis including disease, remission at HCT, graft source, donor and patient gender as well as conditioning regimens will be presented.",

Tichy (1) , M. Ulrychova (1) , P. Zak (1) , M. Lanska (1) , J. Maly (3) (1)University Hospital (Hradec Kralove, CZ) ; (2) Faculty of Military Health Sciences (Hradec Kralove, CZ) ; (3) Charles University (Hradec Kralove, CZ) Aim: Assessment of cardiac toxicity during hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for hematological malignancies with multiple biomarkers of cardiac injury -myoglobin, creatine kinase MB (CK-MB mass), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), heart-type fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP), glycogen phosphorylase BB (GPBB). Experience with new perspective cardiac biomarkers (GPBB, H-FABP) in this context is very limited. Patients and methods: A total of 53 patients (mean age 49.9 \u00b1 12.3 years, median 54 years, 33 males) transplanted for various hematological malignancies were studied. The diagnoses were as follows: AML 27, MM 12, NHL 5, HL 4, ALL 3, CML 1, MDS 1. Thirty transplants were autologous, 23 allogeneic. Cardiac biomarkers were measured on Randox Evidence analyzer the day after completion of preparative regimen (after PR) and the day after infusion of hematopoietic cell graft (after HCT). Values above the reference range recommended by the manufacturer were considered elevated. The cut-off values for cardiac injury were as follows: 76.0 \u03bcg/L for myoglobin, 4.80 \u03bcg/L for CK-MB mass, 0.40 \u03bcg/L for cTnI, 4 .50 \u03bcg/L for H-FABP and 7.30 \u03bcg/L for GPBB. Results: We found signifi cant elevations in GPBB (above 7.30 \u03bcg/L) in 8 (15.1%) patients after PR and in 9 (17.0%) after HCT. H-FABP increased slightly above the cut-off after HCT in 1 (1.9%) patient. Other cardiac biomarkers (myoglobin, CK-MB mass, cTnI) remained within the reference range in all patients. We found a signifi cant correlation between elevation in GPBB and diastolic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction on echocardiography (r = 0.603; P < 0.0001). No patient manifested clinical cardiotoxicity in the peritransplant period. Conclusions: Our results suggest that administration of PR followed by HCT could be associated with myocardial injury manifested by increased release of GPBB from cardiomyocytes which could correlate with diastolic LV dysfunction on echocardiography. In asymptomatic patients, these fi ndings could be considered a sign of acute subclinical cardiotoxicity. Whether these acute changes will have predictive value for development of treatment-related cardiomyopathy in the future is not clear and should be evaluated during a prospective follow-up. Further studies in a larger number of patients will be needed to confi rm our preliminary results and defi ne the potential role of new biomarkers of cardiac injury in this context.

Apperley (1) , J. Goldman (1) , N. Salooja (1) (1)Hammersmith Hospital (London, UK); (2) University of Athens (Athens, GR) Reduction in bone mineral density (BMD) is a well recognized complication of SCT for haematological malignancy. There is a lack of data available on BMD and biological bone markers in very long term survivors of SCT, however. In this study we have evaluated the incidence of reduced BMD a minimum of 10 years following SCT for CML in consecutive patients attending a dedicated haematology/endocrine long -term follow-up clinic. Patients were evaluated by history, biochemical tests (including vitamin D, PTH, sex steroids and thyroid hormones) and DXA scans. In a subset of patients, markers of bone formation (osteocalcin, bone specifi c alkaline phosphatase, bALP) and bone resorption (C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of collagen type I, CTX; tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase isoform 5b, TRACP-5b; RANK-ligand and osteoprotegrin, OPG) were measured in the serum. NTX was also measured in the urine. Forty-two patients (21 = female) were evaluated a median of 17 years (range 10-29 years) post-transplant. The median age at evaluation was 50 (range 27-74). A subset of 20 patients had bone markers measured in parallel with 20 age-matched controls. All transplanted patients had received cyclophosphamide/TBI as conditioning. 21/42 (50%) had a reduction in BMD. The median T score at the spine was -0.64 g/cm 2 (range -2.9- 3.8 ) and at the right hip -0.4 g/cm 2 (range -2.7-2.7). 16 patients were osteopenic (10 female) and 5 were osteoporotic (3 female) according to WHO criteria. Fourteen patients (33%) had sub-optimal vitamin D levels but there was no signifi cant difference between those with low compared to normal BMD. We performed a pairwise comparison between patients and controls using Wilcoxon signed ranks test for non-parametric samples for biological markers. Osteocalcin and bALP were signifi cantly higher in patients compared to controls (P = 0.001 and 0.001 respectively) indicating an increase in osteoblast activity. Serum TRACP-5b, RANKL and OPG were signifi cantly higher in patients compared to controls (P = 0.001, P = 0.031 and P = 0.0001 respectively), and urinary NTX was also signifi cantly higher in transplanted patients (P = 0.014). These results indicate an increase in osteoclast function. Our data demonstrate that reduced BMD is common in long term survivors of SCT for CML and that this reduction is mainly due to high bone turnover. These data suggest that such patients may be at increased risk of fracture.",

King, L. Brennan, M. Ni Chonghaile, S. McCann, C. Flynn, P. Browne, E. Conneally, A. Fortune, E. Vandenberghe National Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Centre, St James's Hospital (Dublin, IE) Background: Avascular necrosis (AVN) of bone is a serious complication of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) treatment and allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT), with the predominant risk factor being the use of high dose steroids, though other unknown factors may be implicated. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis of all patients referred to St James Hospital with ALL between 2002 and 2008 with AVN were included. This population included patients treated with chemotherapy and those treated with both chemotherapy and a myeloablative transplant. Results: 88 patients were identifi ed: age range 16 to 66 years; 54 male and 34 female. All patients were initially treated with induction chemotherapy, 56 patients subsequently underwent a SCT in fi rst or subsequent complete remission (CR). Of those who underwent SCT, 50 were in CR1, 5 in CR2, with 1 in CR3. 10 patients (female n = 3, male n = 7) have confi rmed AVN of 24 joints, age range of 16 to 43 years. Of these, 6/10 had chemotherapy alone (n = 3 UKALL 2003, n = 2 UKALL XII, n = 1 CCSG), and 4/10 were post SCT. Of the patients transplanted 4/5 had GVHD. The median time to AVN development was 17 months, (range 2-44 months). Median follow up was 42 months (range 6-92 months) with an overall survival of 81%. Conclusions: Avascular necrosis is a signifi cant complication of ALL treatment, leading to considerable morbidity. In our study symptomatic AVN occurred more frequently in patients treated with chemotherapy alone (18%) versus SCT (7%). Concern remains about the morbidity of intensive chemotherapy particularly in young adults. Future studies are required to understand the mechanism underlying AVN, improving early diagnosis and to develop early interventions to prevent this debilitating condition.",

Christopeit, G. Behre University Hospital Halle (Halle/Saale, DE) Plasma ferritin levels are surrogate marker for iron overload and easily to access. High pre transplant ferritin levels are associated with increased mortality in allogeneic blood stem cell transplantation (SCT) recipients. This increased mortality is mostly due to infectious complications. The mechanism how iron overload leads to a higher rate of infections in SCT recipients is not fully understood. In patients with thalassemia iron overload is a common problem. In these patients, CD8 + count is signifi cantly decreased and infectious complications are often seen. We addressed the question if secondary iron overload in SCT recipients is also associated with CD8 + depletion. Data of 68 patients who underwent SCT were analysed retrospectively. Pretransplant ferritin levels (day -100 to + 30) could be obtained from 31 patients. Ferritin levels were adapted to C-reactive protein (CRP) levels by creation of an index variable ferritin/CRP. Immune reconstitution data were available for 38 patients on day + 30, 40 patients on day + 100 and 25 patients on day + 180. Transfusions before and after transplantations and infectious complications were assessed for all patients by chart review. The median age at transplantation was 58 years. Forty of the 68 patients were male. Reason for transplantation was acute leukaemia in 25, myelodysplastic syndromes in 3, osteomyelofi brosis in 1, lymphoma in 26 and multiple myeloma in 13 patients. High ferritin levels were associated with a high number of transfusions (rho = 0,384 P = 0,033 n = 31). There was no signifi cant correlation between ferritin levels and CD3 + , CD3 + /4 + , CD3 + /CD8 + , CD56 + cells on day + 30 (n = 19) and on day + 100 (n = 22). However, high ferritin levels were associated with low CD8 + counts on day + 180 (rho = -0,879 P = 0,001 n = 10). No association was noticed between serum ferritin levels and early bacterial, viral and/or fungal infections. Patients with higher ferritin levels had more bacterial and viral infections after resolved neutropenia than patients with lower ferritin (bacterial infections P = 0,08, viral infections P = 0,08) and a higher rate of GvHD (MW, SD, P = 0,118). To our knowledge, we show for the fi rst time that high ferritin plasma levels are associated with a decreased CD8 + count in SCT recipients. As in beta thalassemia, the decreased CD8 + count is associated with an increased risk of infections. The association between low CD8 + count and high serum ferritin should be addressed in larger cohorts.",

Indications for HCT included acute leukemia = 72, MPS = 32, lymphoma = 29, MDS = 10 and other = 38. Moderate to severe changes in taste perception were reported by 71% during the acute phase of HCT with no signifi cant differences between the three groups (MAC 74%, RIC 66%, auto HCT 73%). Changes in smell perception were documented in 54% with a median of 34 days (range, 2-365) to improvement. 30% of these patients described a reduction in smell perception, 21% intensifi cation. The symptoms persisted in 62%. In univariate analysis (chi2-tests) we examined the difference between auto and allo HCT as well as the infl uence of GVHD or immunosuppression. Changes in taste perception were signifi cantly associated with loss of body weight > 5 kg (69.2% vs. 45 .6%, P = 0.002). Alterations in body weight and taste perception tended to be more prevalent after allo HCT with 45.9% and 30.3% compared to auto HCT with 58.1% and 45.5%. A complete recovery at the time of survey was reported by 29%, whereas 26% still suffered from taste alterations. We observed a signifi cant difference in time to recovery of taste alterations between auto HCT vs. allo HCT with a median of 60 days (range, vs. 120 (range, 30-600) days (P = 0.03). The incidence of cGVHD after allo HCT was 79/148 (53%). In patients with cGVHD signifi cantly more changes in taste perception (64.6% vs. 49 .0%, P = 0.04) and loss of body weight > 5 kg (55.7% vs. 33 .3%, P = 0.004) were reported. We observed a signifi cant infl uence on alterations in taste and a of loss weight > 5 kg with the use of tacrolimus (67.2% vs. 50 .0%, P = 0.04) or steroids (72.7% vs. 48 .4%, P = 0.03) and mycophenolatmofetil (53.8% vs. 34 .7%, P = 0.01). In conclusion taste and smell disturbances are common events after HCT persisting in 25% of patients receiving allo grafts. In allo HCT a major impact of GVHD and immunosuppression are observed.",

S. Kim (1) , S.C. Won (1) , M. A. Rhee (1) , K.M. Chung (1) , C.J. Lyu (1) (1)Yonsei University College of Medicine (Seoul, KR) ; (1) Yonsei University (Seoul, KR) Background: Long-term survival rate after myeloablative hemato poietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in childhood cancer patients has been remarkably increased lately. As considerable number of patients survive these days, quality of life (QOL) as well as psychosocial adjustment of HSCT survivors is getting more attention. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate psychosocial status and QOL of childhood cancer long-term survivors and to compare differences between those of survivors with/ without HSCT and healthy control group. Methods: Ninety four children who survived more than two years from off therapy with childhood cancer were included. Forty seven survivors experienced HSCT and the other 47 survivors didn't. Forty seven healthy children were also included. Total 141 children and their mother performed standardized questionnaires (Korean Child Behavior Checklist [K-CBCL], Pediatric quality of life [PedsQL]). Results: Among six-items (total problems, externalizing problems, internalizing problems, thought problems, attention problems, and social immaturity), survivors with HSCT had signifi cantly higher score of total problems (P = 0.006) and externalizing problems (P = 0.003) than both survivors without HSCT and healthy children. Both survivors with and without HSCT had signifi cantly higher score of social immaturity (P = 0.001) than healthy children, but there was no signifi cant difference between survivors. On PedsQL, the score of physical function was lowest in survivors with HSCT, and survivors without HSCT also had lower score than healthy children. Survivors with HSCT had signifi cantly lower score of social function (P = 0.02) and school function (P < 0.001) than the others. Conclusion: Survivors with HSCT had more tendencies of showing delinquency and aggressiveness and experiencing low QOL. Several items showed no signifi cant difference between survivors without HSCT and healthy children. This preliminary study suggests HSCT is thought to be an independent risk factor of poor psychosocial outcomes. These fi ndings propose that childhood cancer survivors who experienced HSCT have more need for attention to their QOL and psychosocial intervention plan to improve their overall outcomes.",

Andersen Childrens Hospital (Odense, DK) Background: Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) is a rare complication in paediatric stem cell transplantation (SCT), and is associated with a high risk of mortality. There is no clear evidence that therapeutic interventions have a positive impact on the course of the disease, but a lasting effect on lung function after high-dose pulse methylprednisolone (MP) therapy has been reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate the response of MP treatment in a population based paediatric cohort from the national SCT centre in Denmark. Material and methods: The study was restricted to patients who had an age suffi cient to perform a reliable spirometry. Seven children transplanted between 1999 and 2008 with median age 10 years (4-13) were included. BO was verifi ed by open lung biopsy and/or high resolution computer tomography (HRCT). One patient, who died from acute respiratory failure due to cytomegalovirus infection during the fi rst month, was excluded. Patients were treated with MP 15 mg/kg for 2-3 consecutive days every 4-6 weeks. In three patients this was combined with infl iximab. Basic immunosuppression included cyclosporine A (n = 7), mycophenolate (n = 5) and prednisolone (n = 5). Median time from symptoms to initiation of MP-treatment was 16 days . Lung function measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) was measured before SCT, before start of MP, and then monthly. Data are presented as medians (range), and were analyzed using Wilcoxon rank sum test. Results: There was a signifi cant reduction in FEV1 (P < 0,01) and FVC (P < 0,05) from pre-SCT values to the time of diagnosis of BO (Table 1) . Three months after initiation of MP therapy, a signifi cant response was seen as FEV1 increased (P < 0,01). However, the levels at six months did not differ signifi cantly from pre-treatment levels. Two patients died from residual cancer within a year from BO diagnosis, whereas fi ve children are alive at median 48 months (9-114) after BO diagnosis. One child is now being referred for lung transplantation. The remaining have a normal to moderately reduced lungfunction after 7,5 (2-43) cycles of MP. Conclusion: Signifi cant improvement in lung function is demonstrated after initiation of MP treatment in children with BO after SCT, but this effect appears to be only temporary. However, MP may have the potential of stabilizing the level of lung function and prevent further decline. Larger studies are needed to establish long term effect.",

Fernandez de Sevilla, R.F. Duarte Institut Catal\u00e1 d'Oncologia (Barcelona, ES) Thyroid dysfunction (TDF) is a recognized late complication of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). For this reason, EBMT/CIBMTR-ASBMT consensus guidelines for longterm HSCT survivors recommend thyroid function testing yearly post transplant in all patients, or if new relevant symptoms develop. The reported incidence of TDF varies between studies, depending not only on patient and HSCT characteristics, but also on the follow-up period of observation. Few studies have analyzed the longer-term prevalence of this complication. In this study, we retrospectively analyse long-term follow-up of thyroid function (TSH and FT4) in 169 long-term HSCT survivors in our center with no pretransplant history of TDF and at least one year follow-up (1993-2008) : autologous 115 (68%), allogeneic 54 (32%); male 90 (53%); median age at HSCT 43 years (15-68); AML/MDS 29%, Mieloma 23%, Non-Hodgkin 17%, Hodgkin 14%, CML 12%, ALL 3%, others 2%. Sixty two of these patients (37%) developed TDF during our median period of observation of 75 months (12-186): 54 cases of subclinical hypothyroidism (32%), six of overt hypothyroidism (4%) and two of overt hyperthyroidism (1%). There was no association between TDF and sex, primary disease, conditioning regimen or type of allogeneic donor (related vs. unrelated). A signifi cantly higher prevalence of TDF was observed in younger HSCT recipients (48% in \u2264 40 years vs. 29% in > 40 years; P = 0.01), and in recipients of autologous vs. allogeneic HSCT (43% vs. 24%; P = 0.02). Moreover, the median time from transplantation to diagnosis of TDF was longer in autologous HSCT (63 vs. 23 months in allogeneic; P = 0.01), where half of the cases of TDF were observed more than 5 years after HSCT, despite comparable median follow-up periods for survivors in both groups (P = 0.20) . The prevalence of this complication in autologous HSCT could have been underestimated in previous studies because of a shorter follow-up. These data not only confi rm the well-established high prevalence of TDF after allogeneic HSCT, but also do suggest that the prevalence of TDF may be higher than initially described long-term after autologous HSCT, and reinforce a recommendation for sustained long-term monitoring, beyond 5 years post-HSCT to diagnose late-onset TDF, in particular in younger patients.",

Kazmi, L. Bishop, M. Streetly, K. Raj Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust (London, UK) Background: As long-term survival in haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) improves, managing late complications becomes increasingly important. The leading causes of late death are relapse and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is now, also emerging as a signifi cant contributor to late morbidity and mortality. Dyslipidaemia is one risk factor for CVD and Joint British Society (JBS) guidance recommends an optimal total target cholesterol of < 4 mmol/L in patients at high risk of CVD. Method: A retrospective review of random lipid levels measured at least one year following HCT is presented. In line with NICE guidance, total cholesterol and HDL are used as markers of dyslipidaemia. Results: 44 allograft patients were identifi ed from departmental records. 68% male, median age 29 yrs, 43% Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, 27% Acute Myeloid Leukaemia, 30% other. 96% had a total cholesterol > 4 mmol/L (64% > 5 mmol/L, median 5.5 mmol/L). 14 (32%) were classifi ed as high risk (9 raised total:HDL ratio, 2 clinical evidence atherosclerotic disease, 4 diabetes, 2 CVD score \u2265 20% over 10 years). The median age of the high-risk group was 39 yrs, and 93% were male. 57% had GvHD, of which 75% were on steroids, and of these 75% were also receiving mycophenylate. 3 patients had a total cholesterol of > 7.5 mmol/L and were being screened for familial dyslipidaemia. 31 autologous HCT patients were also reviewed. 68% male, median age 47 yrs, 55% Lymphoma, 45% Plasma Cell Disorder. 84% had a total cholesterol > 4 mmol/L (52% > 5 mmol/L, median 5.0 mmol/L). Conclusion: We report a high incidence of dyslipidaemia, which is signifi cantly greater than previously published European data of 16% (Tichelli et al., Haematologica 2008) . Previously suggested mechanisms include endocrine dysfunction and prolonged immunosuppression. However, these do not explain the results in our autologous HCT patients. The median time from transplant to testing was 34 and 28 months in the allogeneic and autologous HCTs, and it may be that with time, some normalization of the lipid profi le could be expected. Other possible explanations include poor dietary and lifestyle factors due to the poor socioeconomic status of our population. We propose that all HCT patients should be screened for dyslipidaemia, and statin therapy initiated, with a target total cholesterol of < 4 mmol/L as per the JBS guidance. In addition, dietary and lifestyle factors should be addressed where appropriate.",

Ciceri San Raffaele (Milan, IT) Object: Since perceived quality of life promote patients' compliance and satisfaction to medical treatment, supported by many literature's experiences, the main purpose of this study, risen from the collaboration between the Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit and Health Clinical Psychology Unit at San Raffaele Scientifi c Institute, was to evaluate factors related to patients' perceived quality of life during the different stages of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation program (HSCT). Methods: From January 2008 to October 2009, 93 patients undergoing HSCT completed questionnaires measuring level of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS), coping strategies (Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale, MAC), level of distress (Perception of Distress Index, PDI) and quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study Short form-36, SF 36), controlling for sex, age, stage of HSCT (pre-infusion, within 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, over 3 months post HSCT), diagnosis, type of transplant (autologous, allogenic), disease stage. These data were analyzed by the statistical software SPSS. Results: The results show a signifi cant negative correlation (P < 0.01 ) between perceived quality of life and level of anxiety, depression and level of distress. No correlation between quality of life and type of transplant, stage of HSCT, diagnosis, disease stage was found, so that psychological aspects have been related to patients' perceived quality of life more than the clinical measurable variables of the disease and its treatment. Conclusions: Therefore, the psychological status of the patients has to be taken into a proper account in evaluating even the clinical impact of the HSCT on their quality of life and preventive corrections and therapeutical acts, if needed, have to be taken. The HSCT team should include psychologists to work with the clinicians in order to evaluate, during the treatment, the impact of these factors affecting perceived quality of life related to HSCT.",

Pivkova, S Genadieva Stavrik, Z. Stojanoski, L. Cevreska, S. Krstevska Balkanov, S. Trajkova, I. Panovska Stavridis, O. Karanfi lski, B. Georgievski University Hematology Hospital (Skopje, MK) The hematopoietic cell transplantation comobrbidity index (HCT-CI) was developed as a sensitive tool to capture pretransplant comorbidities among transplant recipients which will have infl uence on non relapse mortality (NRM) and overall posttransplant survival (OS). HCT-CI has not been widely validated among autologous recepients. We retrospectivelly evaluated if HCT-CI and karnofsky performance status (PS) and other readily available pretransplant variables concerning pretransplant mobilization strategies can predict the outcome of autologous recipients in our transplant center. We stratifi ed outcomes among 120 consecutive adult autologous recipients (47 AML in fi rst remission, 24 HD, 27 MM, 16 NHL, 4ALL). HCT-CI risk was low in 10 (12%), intermediate in 22 (27%) high in 45 (55%) and undetermined in 5 (6%). Two year OS was 45% (95%CI: 24-64%), 55% (95%CI: 40-68%) and 42% (95%CI: 24-64%) in the low, intermediate and high-risk HCT-CI groups respectively. Two year NRM was 36% (95% CI: 17-36%), 26% (95% CI: 15-39%) and 30% (95% CI: 22-39%) in the low, intermediate and high-risk HCT-CI groups respectively. The multivariate analysis revealed that HCT-CI failed in prediction of OS and NRM but KPS (< 90%) was a strong predictor of NRM as an independent predictor. The variables concerning mobilization of stem cells (chemotherapy with G-CSF versus G-CSF alone and the dose of infused CD34 + > 4,0 \u00d7 10 6 /kg and < 4.0 \u00d7 10 6 /kg in the three risk HCT-CI groups revealed that patients with HCT-CI score > 3 and intermediate and high risk disease that received < 4.0 \u00d7 10 6 /kg had 2 year NRM <30% and OS<45%, as well the patients mobilized with chemotherapy + G-CSF showed lower NRM in the HCT-CI > 3 (intermediate and high risk disease). To determine the validity of HCT-CI, KPS and weather to include the the independent variables concerning the mobilization strategy and stem cell dose that we analyzed, a multi-center collaboration is necessary to produce an adequately powered validation study for risk stratifi cation of autologous recipients.",

Elmaagacli University of Duisburg-Essen (Essen, DE) Background: The widely expressed detoxifi cation enzyme NAD(P)H:quinine oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) is involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress and irradiation and protects cells against the mutagenicity from free radicals and toxic oxygen metabolities. NQO1 is subject to a genetic polymorphism (C609T) leading to a change in its amino acid sequence. Heterozygous individuals C/T have intermediate activity and homozygotes T/T are NQO1 defi cient. Never before the infl uence of genetic polymorphisms of NQO1 on patients who underwent allogeneic transplantation, was evaluated. Methods: Here we genotyped in a retrospective study 198 patients (and their donors) for NQO1 expression who underwent allogeneic transplantation for various diseases and analyzed their outcome. Genotyping of NQO1 was performed by real-time PCR. Results: 145 patients (73.2%) were genotyped as homozygous wild-type gene C/C, 48 patients (24.2%) were genotyped as heterozygous genotype C/T and fi ve patients (2.5%) were genotype as homozygous gene mutation T/T. From the donors 147 donors (74.2%) were C/C, 50 donors (25.3%) were C/T, and one donor (0.5%) had a homozygous gene mutation T/T. Calculated genotype frequencies did not differ from that reported earlier by other studies for Caucasians. Five-year estimate for TRM was highest in genotype C/T-and T/T-patients with 39% + 11% compared to homozygous wild-type gene C/C-patients (21% + 3.9% [P < 0.045]), whereas the fi ve-year estimate for relapse or overall survival were not statistically different between the groups. No differences for fi ve-year estimates for TRM, relapse rate, or OS were seen in patients with either genotype C/C-, C/T-or T/T-donors. No statistic differences were found in the incidence of acute GVHD grade 2-4 within the study groups. Conclusions: These results suggest that patients with genetic polymorphism of NQO1 do have an increased TRM after transplantation. Genotyping for NQO1 (C609T) might help to identify patients with higher risk for TRM.",

Herbers, J.P. Donnelly, N.M.A. Blijlevens Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center (Nijmegen, NL) Background: Mucositis is a complication of intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy that is debilitating for patients and plays a distinct role in determining the outcome of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Despite encouraging data regarding the effectiveness of rKGF (recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor) on oral mucositis there is a dearth of data regarding its activity on intestinal mucosal barrier injury (MBI). Main reason is the inaccessibility of the gut. Citrulline is an aminoacid that can be determined in blood, which is a functional marker of small intestinal enterocytes. Low citrulline concentrations in blood coincide with and are a response to, severe MBI and associated with bacteraemia. In the present study, we examined the effi cacy and safety of rKGF on intestinal MBI induced by cytotoxic therapy using citrulline as parameter. Patients and methods: Between July 2006 and November 2008 in a single center study 19 patients undergoing autologous HSCT after BEAM were treated with rKGF and retrospectively compared to a matched control group. Outcomes assessed were: safety, daily oral mucositis score (DMS), daily gut score (DGS), course of absolute neutrophil count, C-reactive protein and citrulline, occurrence of neutropenic fever and bacteraemia. Main results: The common side effects of rKGF included rash and erythema, which occurred in all patients and were mild (37% CTC grade 1 and 63% CTC grade 2) and transient in appearance. rKGF recipients showed a signifi cant reduction of approximately 30% in the DMS (between day 10 and 13) and DGS (between day 15 and 18). No signifi cant difference in the course of citrulline was seen between the patients. In both treatment groups 9 patients developed bacteraemia (respectively 6 patients with coagulase-negative staphylococci and 3 patients with viridans streptococci in both groups). Conclusions: The administration of rKGF was generally tolerated and safe. rKGF had a benefi cial infl uence on the signs and symptoms related to oral and intestinal mucositis. However, no impact on the course of citrulline and bacteraemia was seen.",

Koza University Hospital in Pilsen (Pilsen, CZ) Introduction: Melphalan based conditioning regimens are standard and well-established within hematopoietic stem cells transplantation (HSCT) settings. Several factors may have impact on the treatment results. Objectives: to verify melphalan doses administered per kilogram of body weight in AML patients treated with allogeneic HSCT after fl udarabine/melphalan (FLU/ MEL) conditioning regimen and to evaluate impact of the dosing variability on the treatment results and oral toxicity. Methods and patients: retrospective analysis, 38 AML patients, allogeneic HSCT, FLU/MEL conditioning regimen (fl udarabine total dose 120 mg/m\u00b2, melphalan 140 mg/m\u00b2), the period of 10/2001-12/2007. Results: The median melphalan dose administered per a patient was 3,5 (range 2,5 -4,1) mg/kg of actual body weight. Two groups of patients were compared in respect to the melphalan dose: \u2265 3,5 mg/kg (\"higher\") versus \u2264 3,4 mg/kg (\"lower\"). Both groups were relatively well balanced in all important demography, donor-patient transplant characteristics and the follow-up time: 15 (1-70) vs. 13 (2-55) months (P = n.s.) . No statistically signifi cant differences were observed in relapse rate, transplant related mortality, acute or chronic GVHD incidence and graft rejection. No difference was found in the 3-years OS and DFS probability between the two groups (48% vs. 54% and 48% vs. 43%, P = 0,8). In patients with the same body surface area, those with lower body weight had higher melphalan mg/kg doses and had higher incidence of severe oral mucositis grade 3-4 WHO (48% vs. 24%, P = 0,05). Conclusions: In patients with the same body surface area, those with lower body weight received higher melphalan mg/kg doses. This fact appeared to increase oral toxicity and, probably did not have any signifi cant additional effect on the treatment results within the cohort of the patients. Melphalan dosing based on body weight instead of body surface should be considered and the impact of the median 3,5mg/kg melphalan dose within the FLU/MEL conditioning be verifi ed in larger and prospective trial.",

Fassas G.Papanicolaou (Thessaloniki, GR) Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HCT) has been associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) as a late effect caused by a variety of factors. We retrospectively evaluated the development of CKD in 164 patients (pts), aged 9-65, who underwent HCT for hematological disease from sibling (137) or unrelated donors (27) after myeloablative (144) or reduced intensity conditioning regimens (20) and who survived for at least 3 months post transplantation (median follow up 23.5 months). CDK was defi ned as a GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m 2 , estimated by the modifi cation of diet in renal disease (MDRD) formula and the Schwartz formula for children. The probability of CKD was 23.8% at 18 months after a median follow up of 7 (3-120) months. The mean value of pre-HCT-GFR was within normal limits (111.5 \u00b1 26) for pts who did not develop CKD and 97.21 \u00b1 -19 for those who developed CKD, while the GFR at 12 months post transplant was 108 \u00b1 28 and 54.7 \u00b1 5.4 (ml/min/1.73 m 2 ), respectively. The course of CKD was asymptomatic until the end-stage disease when 3 pts were on dialysis and 1 patient received a renal transplant from his mother. On univariate analyses, the probability of developing CKD was 25% at 18 months for pts with 0 or 1 event of kidney injury vs. 60% for those with 2-5 preceded events (p: 0.006). On the other hand, the type of conditioning, hyper fractionated TBI, administration of Thiotepa or Fludarabine, acute or chronic GVHD, the toxicity of antiviral or antifungal treatment did not correlate with the CKD. Calcineurin inhibitors were not included as risk factors because of the universal administration as prophylaxis and because of their toxicity appearing in the long term treatment. On multivariate analysis, the only predictive factors were older age (P = 0.01), the number of preceded events of acute kidney injury, and the in vivo T cell depletion with antithymocyte globulin or alemtuzumab (0.013). The CKD did not infl uence the non relapse mortality of the HCT. The profound lymphocytopenia of T-cell depletion might possibly be related to an excess of secretion of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) which may promote early and rapid renal fi brogenesis. Close monitoring of the patients for early events of acute kidney injury due to drug toxicity is necessary for CKD prevention.",

Anastasia, M. Magagnoli, M. Balzarotti, R. Mazza, A. Santoro Humanitas (Rozzano, IT) Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHCT) for relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) after one line chemotherapy remains the gold standard, with a long-term disease-free survival in 40-50% of patients. However the incidence of toxicity and second cancer development in this distinctive subset of patients has not been well established. The aim of the present study is to assess toxicity and second malignances among 52-months survivors in complete remission after treatment with IGEV plus AHCT. We retrospectively reviewed a uniform cohort of 121 patients who underwent IGEV induction therapy followed by AHCT from 1997 to 2007. Among those treated in our Institution, 75 received one ABVD or ABVD-like chemotherapy line before. Radiotherapy was added in 63% of them with bulky disease. All the 75 patients were treated with IGEV x 4 cycles. However, only 66 underwent autologous stem cell transplantation. Highdose regimen consisted of carmustine, etoposide, aracytin and melphalan (BEAM) for 18 patients and of a tandem procedure (Melphalan200 plus BEAM) for the other 48 patients. Treatment related mortality was null. Early haematological and extra-haematological toxicity were similar in the two cohorts of AHCT. After a median follow-up of 52 months, 50 patients were in complete remission, therefore available for the analysis. Of these patients, 4 (8%) developed a second cancer: 1 acute myelogenous leukemia, 1 pancreatic cancer, 1 papillary thyroid cancer, 1 malignant teratoma. Nine patients (18%) reported late toxicity: 3 thyroid failure, 1 cardiovascular disease, 1 chronic bronchopneumonia, 2 psychiatric and 1 osteopathic disorders. One patient developed Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Furthermore we observed 2 cases of opportunistic infections (Herpes Zoster visceral disease and Cytomegalovirus pneumonia) during the fi rst year from AHCT. The global related mortality was 4% (2 tumors). Salvage therapy using IGEV followed by AHCT was not associated with second cancer development or organ failure in 74% of HL patients in complete response. Late toxicity and second cancers are a signifi cant cause of late morbidity and mortality for relapsed/refractory HL treated with curative intent by AHCT; while in our experience it does not appear increased in a homogeneous cohort exposed to IGEV regimen followed by AHCT.",

Magagnoli, A. Anastasia, M. Mencaglia, M. Balzarotti, R. Mazza, A. Santoro Humanitas (Rozzano, IT) Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHCT) for Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) patients has markedly improved the survival in the last three decades, although, to date, little is known about the psychosocial functioning for long term survivors. Recently, several investigators have suggested the importance of a psychosocial morbidity assessment in the follow-up of these patients. Our study concerns the infl uence of psychosocial dis-functions on the quality of life of patients who underwent AHCT for relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) in our Institution from 1997 to 2007. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical follow-up of 94 patients treated with IGEV plus AHCT, in order to determine the incidence of psychological disorders. Interviews were performed in between 1 year from AHCT. However, among initial 94 patients, 6 died within 100 days from transplant, 7 were lost during follow-up, so data were available for only 81 of them (43 men and 38 women, with median age of 31years). Oral reports about mood, household-life, fatigue, depression and anxiety were collected into a specifi c record called \"Performance Status (PS)\". An unexpectedly high number of HL survivors reported having psychosocial dis-functions 15/81(19%), in spite of young median age and freedom from progression. Depression occurred in 10/15(66%) of them, anxiety in 3/15(20%) and 2 young women developed alimentary disorders. However, although only 6 patients had second cancer and 12 showed late toxicity, over 70% of the survivors referred high fears of recurrence or of second tumors. When we investigated them on \"at home drug therapies\", our fi ndings showed a high use of benzodiazepine (about 90% of survivors), whereas 3 patients reported psychotropic treatments. Our data demonstrate a fairly large number of proven psychological disorders in HL. In contrast only few patients received specifi c management and psychiatric therapy.",

Nieto, F. de Arriba, V. Vicente Hospital Morales Meseguer (Murcia, ES) Background: The recent progresses in hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (SCT), especially in the source of the stem cell and the conditioning regimens allow a better tolerance of the transplant proceeding that favors an earlier discharge. Despite this advances, it is still an aggressive therapy not exempt of toxicities that sometimes can lead to the need of readmission to the Hospital. Aims: To determine the frequency and causes of readmission of patients who underwent stem cell transplant (SCT) in our institution. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed of 192 consecutive patients who underwent SCT, autologus (autoSCT) or allogenic (alloSCT) between January 2005 and July 2009. We considered readmission as any clinical event that need hospitalization after discharge from transplantation proceeding. Data was collected on the following variables: underlying disease, status at transplantation, presence of comorbodities (mesured by the Charlson index), conditioning regimen, cause and date of readmission. Data on complications during the transplantation procedure were also collected: the occurrence of mucositis, infections, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome and other relevant complications related with infusion and/or conditioning. Results: Among 192 patients included in this analysis (120 men, 62'5%), 127 (66%) where autoSCT and 65 (34%) allo-SCT, from related (RD: 50 patients) and unrelated donors (URD: 15 patients).The total of readmissions was of 151 among 94 patients: 70 patients were admitted once, 9 patients twice and 15 patients 3 or more occasions. Readmission rate was signifi cantly higher among patients who received alloSCT from URD (60%) vs. autoSCT (46%) or RD (54%), (P = 0.003). The median day after transplant of hospitalization was also earlier on the URD group of patients: day + 161 (range 13-1095) for autoSCT; + 75 (range 20-732) for RD aloTPH and + 69 (range 34-575) for NRD aloTPH patients. The principal cause of readmission was infectious disease, followed by GVHD for the alloSCT group. Mortality at day + 100 after SCT was 1'5% among autoSCT, and 4% and 13% among RD and URD allo-SCT respectively. Those patients who presented complications during the transplant procedure had a higher readmission rate. Discussion: Infections are the principal cause of readmission in our series. Patients who undergo URD alloSCT have a significantly higher and earlier rate of readmission.",

Several factors might contribute to this-including high-dose chemotherapy, steroids, radiation, prolonged immobilization and malnutrition. Prophylactic measures including provision of suffi cient caloric intake, low-dose vitamin D and calcium S109 supplementation do not seem to be enough to prevent bone loss following Allo-SCT. Methods: In an attempt to evaluate safety and effi cacy of bisphosphonates in preventing bone loss after Allo-SCT in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), we enrolled 17 patients from our institution over a period of 3 years. Bone Mineral Density was measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan at baseline and at 6 and 12 months after transplantation. Bone metabolism was measured by urinary crosslinked collagen (NTX) and serum Osteocalcin levels at baseline and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after transplantation. All patients received 4 mg of zoledronic acid intravenously at baseline and at 6 months after transplantation. Results: Of the 15 evaluable patients, baseline BMD was within normal limits in 10 patients. Four patients had osteopenia and one patient had osteoporosis. DEXA scores did not change signifi cantly in any patient over time including the patient with osteoporosis. Urinary NTX levels dropped over time in the majority of the patients. Median NTX-Telopeptide values in nmol/mmol at baseline, and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months were 60, 53, 32, 20 and 11 respectively (P < 0.05) . Two patients showed increase in urinary NTX values over time and both of them were being treated with high-dose corticosteroids for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In comparison, there was no statistical difference in the serum Osteocalcin levels over time when compared to baseline values in individual patients. Four patients expired from transplant related complications. Four patients did not complete follow-up due to disease relapse (n = 2) or complications from infection and GVHD (n = 2). None of the SAEs were deemed to be related to the study drug. One patient had grade III hypocalcemia that was related to baseline vitamin D defi ciency and was treated appropriately without any adverse outcome. Conclusion: In this pilot study, zoledronic acid (4 mg/6 months) was found to be safe in patients with AML undergoing Allo-SCT and is effective in preserving bone mass by decreasing excessive bone loss in the immediate post transplantation period.",

Wasko-Grabowska, S. Oborska, B. Mlot Institute of Health Services (Warsaw, PL) Oral mucositis is a common complication of high-dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem-cell support (HSCT). We evaluated the effi cacy and safety of calcium phosphate mouth rinse (Caphosol) for prevention and reduction of severity and duration of oral mucositis (OM) in patients treated with HSCT. In 2009 23 patients were treated. Three received allo-: 2-HD, 1-MM and 20 autologous transplantation: 9-NHL; 8-HD; 3-MM. For ALLO conditioning regimens were composed of: fl udarabine 150 mg/m\u00b2 and melphalan 140 mg/m\u00b2. AUTO were treated with: BEAM(HD/NHL) and melphalan 200 mg/m\u00b2 (MM). Caphosol was administered 4 times daily, starting from the day before the beginning of chemotherapy till the end of hospitalization. Control group was composed of patients, who had been treated with HSCT previously, before \"palifermin and caphosol era\". The groups were comparable according to number of patients, their age, type of disease, transplant and conditioning regimen. OM was assessed with the use WHO oral-toxicity scale. Treatment with antibiotics was started when neutropenic fever occurred. The number of days with painkillers or antibiotics were estimated. Statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon` test for analysis of differences between groups. Results: In patients treated with calcium phosphate mouth rinse oral mucositis grade 2-4 was not observed. Nobody had to receive opioid analgesics or total parenteral nutrition. 30% patients developed the fi rst degree of oral mucositis 4-5 days' duration. In the control group OM was observed in all cases, 50% patients had III-IV degree. Median duration of OM was 10 and 12 days (range 5-20) for auto-and allogeneic patients, respectively. As compared with control group, treatment with calcium phosphate mouth rinse was associated with signifi cant reduction of the incidence of oral mucositis in II-IV degrees (0 percent versus 50 percent, P < 0.001), duration of oral mucositis (4/5 days vs. 10/12 days, P < 0.001), duration of pain-killers` treatment (0-3 days vs. 0-22 days, P < 0.001) and number of days with antibiotics` treatment (0-7 days vs. 7-20 days, P = 0.002). These differences were observed in both types of transplantation. No side effects of calcium/phosphate oral rinse were observed. Conclusion: Calcium phosphate mouth rinse is a very promising medicine for prevention of oral mucositis for patients treated with high dose chemotherapy supported with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",

Josep Trueta (Girona, ES) Background and aims: Graft-failure (GF) is an infrequent and poor complication of allogeneic SCT (alloSCT). Strategies for reversing GF will depend on the options available in each situation. We report the frequency and outcome of adult patients with GF in two transplant centers over a 4-yr. period. Patients and methods: From January 2006 to October 2009 171 alloSCT have been performed in two institutions. Stemcell progenitors were from unrelated cord blood (UCB) in 20, from unrelated peripheral blood (PB) in 37 and from related PB in 113 patients. Conditioning therapy was myeloablative (Myel) and non-myeloablative (N-Myel) in 77 and 94 patients, respectively. Primary GF was defi ned as ANC > 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L not reached for three consecutive days by day + 28 after SCT from PB progenitors and by day + 60 after SCT from UCB progenitors. Secondary GF was defi ned as a recurrent ANC < 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /l for at least 7days. Results: Eleven patients (6.4%, median age 47 yr. , diagnoses: AML [7], lymphoma [3] and ALL [1] ) presented GF. Characteristics of SCT and GF treatment are shown in Table 1 . Characteristics of 2nd SCT and patients' outcome are shown in Table 2 . The 2-yr. estimated probability of survival was 51% (95%CI: 19%-83%). No differences were found in GF incidence according to the graft source or the type of conditioning. Conclusions: The incidence of GF in the present series was 6%, without differences according to the graft source or the intensity of the conditioning regimen. The prognosis was poor, although some patients presented long survival if successful recovery of GF was obtained. Supported by grants P-EF/09 of FIJC and RD06/0020/1056 of RETICS.",

Sakamaki Tokyo Metropolitan Komagome Hospital (Tokyo, JP) Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients have an increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, serum creatinine level may underestimate the prevalence of these kidney complications because of decreased lean body mass or concurrent liver disease, which was frequently observed in a HSCT setting. Cystatin C measurement may be more sensitive for detecting impaired kidney function. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 75 allogeneic HSCT recipients and evaluated cystatin C as a potential marker of subsequent renal dysfunction. AKI developed in 31 of 75 patients after a median of 46 days (range, 1-502 days), while worsened stage of CKD was observed in 21 patients during the observational period. Cystatin C level was signifi cantly elevated after allogeneic transplantation (P <0.001 ). Multivariate analysis revealed use of calcineurin inhibitors as a major cause of cystatin C elevation (odds ratio, 7.26; P = 0.04). Cumulative incidence of CKD worsening (30% by day 100) was signifi cantly higher in the group with cystatin C > 0.90 mg/L than in the group with cystatin C < 0.90 mg/L ( Figure 1 ). Cystatin C was elevated in the creatine blind area (GFR 40-70 ml/min) ( Figure 2) . A strong correlation was also seen between 1/cystatin C and eGFR (r = 0.815, P < 0.001). Cystatin C measurement could provide a useful clinical tool to identify hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients at increased risk of CKD.",

Ibrahim, A. Abdou, A. Mugharbil, N. Yassine, G. Nsouli, R. Jalloul, T. Jisr, K. Sayyid Makassed Hospital (Beirut, LB) From 9/1997 and 9/2008, 92 pts underwent myeloablative allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from HLA identical familial donors. Since 1/05, continuous bladder irrigation (CBI) with normal saline (NS) has been added to hyperhydrationforced diuresis (H-D) and Mesna for the prevention of haemorrhagic cystitis (HC). Nine (9.8%) of the 92 pts developed HC. Median age was 18 y (9-34). Five pts were females and 4 males. The diagnosis was CML: 4 pts, AML: 3 pts, beta thalassemia: 1pt and Fanconi anemia: 1pt. All the pts received Cy \u00b1 Bu based conditioning regimens. Median time for the diagnosis of HC was 18 d . HC was of early-onset e (prior to 72 hours following the completion of conditioning) in 4 pts and of late-onset in 5 pts. HC was severe in all cases. Because all pts were refractory to H-D and CBI with NS, cystoscopy (C) with fulguration (F) were performed in a median interval of 21 d after the onset of HC. Instillation of formalin 4% during C was done in 8 pts. For these 8 pts, median interval between C, F, formalin 4% instillation and the resolution of HC was 6.5 d (3-18) .Two pts developed a relapse of HC 30 d and 32 d, respectively after the resolution of the fi rst episode. Both pts were retreated with F and formalin 4% instillation.They obtained a complete resolution of their HC 3 d and 18 d, respectively after treatment.The pt who underwent C and F without installation of formalin 4% needed 49 d for the resolution of HC. We failed to confi rm an association between GVHD and HC since 3 (33.3%) out of the 9 pts who developed HC had GVHD, while 20 (24%) out of 83 pts without HC developed GVHD (P = 0.84). There was a signifi cant association between CMV infection and HC since 15 (18%) out of the 83 pts without HC developed CMV infection while 5 (55.5%) out the 9 pts with HC developed CMV infection (P = 0.03) . CMV infection preceded the recurrence in the 2 pts who recurred of HC. Polyoma BK virus was investigated in only 2 of the 5 pts who develop late-onset HC, and BK viruria was negative. Two of the 8 pts treated with instillation of formalin 4% developed 18m after HSCT contracted bladder, hydronephrosis and renal failure. Double J catheter insertion then augmentation cystoplasty was done in one pt; cystosplasty and renal transplantation were planed for the other pt. Our study confi rmed the effective role of CBI (added since 1/05) in HC prevention since 8 (18.2%) out of the 44 pts allografted before 1/05 developed HC while one (2.1%) out the 48 pts allografted after 2005 developed HC (P = 0.025).",

Eugenio Hospital (Rome, IT) ; (2)Policlinico Tor Vergata (Rome, IT) Background: Motor disability (MD) defi ned as impairment of daily living activities (ADL) related to motor function limitations is frequently observed in hematological malignancies, although rarely explored and reported in patients (pts) undergoing stem cells transplantation (BMT). Patients and methods: With the aim to assess MD, we studied all pts admitted to BMT during an observation period of 24 months. ADL were tested with Barthel Index (BI) at entry and then weekly; MD was diagnosed in the presence of BI reduction and classifi ed as: mild (BI = 67-99%), moderate (BI = 33-66%) and severe (BI = 0-32%). Pts with normal ADL (without MD) were also evaluated for motor function limitation. Results: Pts examined during the observation period were 46, undergoing 51 BMT (40 autologous and 11 allogeneic). Median age was 50 years (21-74). Diagnosis at BMT was acute leukemia in 10, multiple myeloma in 22, lymphoma in 16, myelodisplasia (MDS) in 2, solid tumor (ST) in 1. Disease phase at BMT was complete remission/very good partial remission in 34, partial remission in 13, untreated in 2 (MDS), progression/relapse in 2. At entry, a mild MD was present in 4/51 BMT (8%) and a motor function limitation was identifi ed in 7/47 BMT (15%) with normal ADL. After BMT, MD was present in 13/51 (25,5%), classifi ed as mild in 7/13, moderate in 1/13, severe in 5/13. At discharge, MD was completely, partially or not corrected in 5, 4 and 4 pts respectively, so that 8/51 pts (16%) were disabled at discharge. Disability was present in 26% of assistance weeks. In order to assess risk factors, analysis was then limited to pts with normal ADL at entry (47 BMT). In univariate analysis, age, diagnosis, disease status at transplant and number of lines before transplant were not signifi cantly correlated to risk of MD development. In multivariate analysis, a strong correlation between MD development and both motor function limitation at entry (odd ratio = 13.2; CI 95% = 1.6-106.9: P = 0.015) and allogeneic versus autologous SCT (odd ratio = 11.2 ; CI 95% = 1.6-75.3 ; P = 0.013) was found.",

Anagnostopoulos (1) (1) G.Papanicolaou (Thessaloniki, GR) ; (2)Hippokration Hospital, (Thessaloniki, GR) Cytopenias consist a well recognized multifactorial complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). We retrospectively analyzed 64 patients (pts), aged 25 years, 44 male, allografted for Acute Leukemia 47, MDS 2, CML 6, HL 1, NHL 4, Aplastic Anemia 3 and X-ALD 1; 27 were in complete remission (CR) (11 in CR1), 32 in refractory and 5 in minimal residual disease. Patients received full (26) or partially (38) matched unrelated donor (MUD) marrow (26) or peripheral blood (38) grafts with a median CD34 + cell dose of 4.55 \u00d7 10 6 /Kg. ABO incompatible were 38 pts (major 15, mixed 5). The conditioning regimen was myeloablative in 63/64 pts, TBI-based in 20/64, with ATG (57) or alemtuzumab (7). Engraftment occurred in 62/64 with neutrophil > 500/mm 3 and platelet > 50000/mm 3 in 50 pts at a median of 17 days (10-36 and 11-57 respectively). Complete donor chimerism was achieved in a median of 15 days ( + 13 day to 4 months) in 39/47 with STR evaluated patients. Thirty three/63 pts developed aGVHD (21 \u2265 grade II) and 32/55 chronic (20 extensive). Cytopenias were defi ned as values below normal, i.e. neutrophils<1000/mm 3 , platelets < 100000/mm 3 , Hb \u2264 10 g/dl post stable engraftment. Their incidence was 66% (40/61 of evaluable pts): thrombocytopenia (14), pancytopenia (13), anemia (2), thrombocytopenia with anemia (7) or neutropenia (4) , presenting at a median of 63 days (1 to 8 months). They were associated with refractory disease (8), GVHD (8), GVHD complicated by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), infections or disease (6), MAHA (7), viral infection (3), ABO incompatibility (3), EBV lympoproliferative disease (3), graft failure (1) and hypersplenism (1). Interestingly the incidence of cytopenias was higher in pts who received alemtuzumab (5/7), ATG \u22657.5 mg/Kg (13/17), male with female donor (8/11) and clinical signifi cant GVHD (15/21 grade \u22652 acute and 14/20 extensive chronic). Patients were treated according to the underlying cause of cytopenias including growth factors, immunotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusion. In the whole cohort of pts 44% are alive. The outcome was worse in pts with cytopenias (38% alive) mostly associated with original disease, GVHD and infections complicated by major hemorrhagic events in 2 pts. Cytopenias post HCT remain a complicated, clinically signifi cant entity and its high incidence is possibly related to immune modulations in MUD HCT. S112 better evaluated and compared using a clinical tool that considers the kinetics of organ injury and subsequent recovery. Serial assessment of organ-specifi c toxicity was performed using the Seattle criteria for patients undergoing HSCT in 57 patients undergoing autologous (n = 39) and allogeneic (n = 17) transplantation. Oral mucositis (OM) and hepatic toxicity were more severe following allogeneic HSCT than in autologous transplant (P < 0.05) . OM occurred with a mean toxicity grade of at least 0.5 between days 5 and 15 for autologous transplant recipients and a mean toxicity grade of 1.5 occurred between days 10 and 20 for allogeneic recipients. Resolution of OM was concomitant with hematopoieteic engraftment in the autologous cohort whereas signifi cant OM persisted beyond engraftment in the allogeneic recipients, perhaps owing to added toxicity from methotrexate administered post-transplant to prevent GVHD. The pattern of gastrointestinal toxicity was similar for the allogeneic and autologous groups with gradual resolution following hematopoietic engraftment. A stable but low degree of renal toxicity was observed after allogeneic transplant whereas a second spike of toxicity occurred in auto logous recipients following hematopoietic engraftment. Genitourinary, pulmonary, cardiovascular and neurological toxicity was uncommon. The pattern of toxicity is organ-specifi c and in some cases, recovery was observed concomitant with hemato poietic recovery, suggesting a role for cell-mediated repair. In summary, serial assessment of toxicity provides a means for objective comparison of regimenrelated toxicity in various transplant strategies and may offer potential insight regarding mechanisms of repair.",

We aimed to develop a new symptom assessment tool -Comprehensive Symptom Profi le in Patients Undergoing BMT/PSCT (CSP-BMT) and test its applicability in this patients population. CSP-BMT is developed to assess the severity of 60 symptoms specifi c for patients undergoing BMT/PSCT. It consists of numerical rating scales, scored from \"0\" (no symptom) to \"10\" (most expressed symptom). There have been identifi ed 15 clusters of symptoms which were clinically relevant and increased practicability of the tool. Applicability of CSP-BMT with preliminary analysis of psychometric properties was tested in the pilot study which included 58 patients with hematological malignancies and autoimmune diseases who underwent autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (mean age -34.5; male/female -24/34). The utility of CSP-BMT was shown: all the items were easy to read and understand by the patients; the data of the tool were clear for interpretation by physicians and were used by them in clinical decision making. Reliability of CSP-BMT was satisfactory (Chronbach's alpha coeffi cient varied from 0.70 to 0.96). The construct validity of CSP-BMT was proved by factor analysis. High sensitivity to changes in symptom status was demonstrated by statistically signifi cant difference (P < 0.05) in symptom severity at different time-points post transplant. Thus, CSP-BMT is an appropriate and practical tool to assess symptom severity in patients before, during and after BMT/ PSCT. The utility of the questionnaire was shown; preliminary psychometric properties appeared to be satisfactory. Further studies are needed before the use of CSP-BMT in clinical practice and clinical trials.",

Z. Ak\u00fd, E. Suyani, H. Pasaoglu, S. Ozenirler, S. Elbeg, G. Sucak Gazi University Faculty of Medicine (Ankara, TR) Introduction: Graft versus host disease (GvHD), and iron overload (IO), might contribute to the development of chronic liver injury directly or via the induction of cytokines and formation free radicals. The aim of our study was to analyze the role of plasma fi brogeneic mediators transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), fi broblast growth factor (FGF), endothelin-1 (ET-1) and nitric oxide (NO) levels as a predictor of liver injury in long-term iron overloaded AHSCT recipients. Patients and methods: Fifthy-four AHSCT recipients (17 women, 37 men), with a median age of 25 years (range 16-53 years) were enrolled in the study. Serum samples for the analysis of endothelin-1, TGF-beta, FGF, NO, ferritin, transferin saturation (TS), non-transferin bound iron (NTBI), and liver function tests were obtained at the 1 year post-transplant follow-up visit. Patients were grouped according to the serum ferritin levels as < 1000 ng/ml vs. \u2265 1000 ng/ml. Results: Serum NTBI levels showed a signifi cant positive correlation with serum ferritin (r = , 471, P = 0,000) and TS (r = ,272, P = 0,047). Serum NO levels positively correlated with the serum TS (r = ,284, P = 0,037) and creatinin levels (r = ,283, P = 0,038). However serum levels of ET-1 negatively correlated with NO (r = -,366, P = 0,006) and ferritin levels (r = -,264, P = 0,053). Serum alanin amino transpherase (ALT) levels were positively correlated with ferritin and TS [(r = ,279, P = 0,04) and (r = ,308, P 0,02) respectively]. Serum levels of TGF-beta and FGF did not show any correlation with iron parameters. No correlation was found with serum NO, TGF-beta and FGF levels even with serum ferritin levels \u2265 1000 ng/ml (P < 0,05) . Higher ferritin group patients with hepatic GvHD had signifi cantly lower levels of serum ET-1 when compered to lower ferritin group. Conclusion: Serum ferritin and TS positively correlated with serum NTBI, and ALT levels which suggests the role of IO in hepatocellular injury in the survivors of AHSCT. Although there was a near signifi cant increase in serum FGF levels in patients with a history of GVHD associated transaminitis, other fi brogenic cytokines did not show any correlation with high ferritin levels. AHSCT recipients should be screened for IO and removing the excess iron with iron chelators should be considered to prevent the development of hepatocellular injury.",

Tokita Dokkyo University of Medicine (Mibu City, JP) Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation comorbidity index (HCT-CI) and Pretransplantation Assessment of Mortality (PAM) score have been reported useful for predicting mortality risk in patients undergoing HCT. There are several reports from Europe or United States but a few reports from Japan. Here we evaluated the usefulness of both HCT-CI and PAM scores in Japanese patients who have underwent for SCT. Totally 68 patients who underwent HCT between January 2000 and December 2006 were enrolled in this analysis. Sixty received HCT under myeloablative preconditioning regimen and 8 under S113 non-myeloablative regimen. The median age at transplantation was 39 years. Twenty-four received HLA-matched sibling grafts and 1 received graft from HLA-mismatched sibling donor, and 43 received HLA-matched unrelated grafts. Hemapoietic stem cells were obtained from peripheral blood in 12 , BM in 49 and cord blood in 9 and peripheral blood + BM in 2. Thirty-six% of patients had scores 1 or more by HCT-CI (infection n = 7, liver dysfunction n = 5, history of solid tumor n = 2, renal dysfunction n = 1, diabetes mellitus n = 4, obesity n = 1, arrythmia n = 1, cerebrovascular disease n = 1 psychiatric disturbance n = 1, moderate pulmonary disease n = 1, cardiac disease n = 1). HCT-CI provided discrimination of overall survival (OS) clearly. Whereas PAM score for low intermediate risk and high intermediate risk account for 95% of the patients and it was diffi cult to assess the difference of OS among different risk groups. For conclusion, in our analysis, HCT-CI enabled to discriminate the risk of HCT patients and was proved to be useful for predicting OS in Japanese patients. However PAM score could not discriminate the risk of HCT patients because 95% of them were sorted to intermediate risk. Explanation for the diffi culty for applying PAM score to our patients might be the stringent selection for HCT patients in our institute. Moreover there is a few patients who have severe obesity and evaluation of renal dysfunction using creatinine level maybe taken severe in Japanese patients who were smaller than patients in Europe or United States and using the creatinin clearance may be appropriate. It might be necessary to improve the index to apply Japanese patients.",

Yang National Taiwan University Hospital (Taipei, TW) Background: As survivors of pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCTs) increase in number, it is increasingly important to evaluate their well-being. Late effects following HSCT are related to underlying disease process, the transplant process and/or the transplant preparative regimens. Problems related to the disease include relapse and rejection. Problems related to the transplant process include delayed recovery of immune system and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Problems related to the transplant preparative regimens include those involving the endocrine system, eyes, lungs, bone and development of secondary malignancies. The incidence of late effects must be assessed. Methods: Among 270 HSCTs in our hospital from August 1986 to December 2007, 161 patients (99 malignant/62 non-malignant, 25 autologous/136 allogeneic) survived over 1 year after engraftment. Here we reported the late effects in these patients before disease relapse or death. Results: After a median follow-up of 83 months, the 31 patients (19.3%) were mortal in the follow-up period. The causes of death were relapse (24, 77.4%), chronic GVHD with infection (4, 12.9%), infection (2, 6.5%), secondary malignancy (1, 3.2%) and others (2, 6.5%). Two 2 patients (1.2%) had late rejection. Totally 51 patients (51/136, 37.5%) had chronic GVHD (21 mild and 30 extensive). Among 81 patients received thyroid function tests, 2 patients had hypothyroidism with thyroxin replacement therapy, 1 had Hashimoto disease and 5 patients had compensated hypothyroidism. 79 patients received gonadal function study and 27 patients had hypogonadism. One thalassemia major patient had diabetes. In pulmonary dysfunction, there were 4 patients with bronchiolitis obliterans with obstructive ventilatory defect and 5 patients with restrictive ventilatory defect. One patient had avascular necrosis with artifi cial hip replacement. New neoplasms developed in 8 patients. Conclusion: HSCTs is a life-saving procedure for an increasing number of children. As an increasing number of patients are long term survivals, late effects are emerging and impacting the mortality and morbidity of these survivors. As more experience is gained, changes in the incidence and approaches to diagnosis and treatment is likely to occur.",

The objective of this study was to determine the spectrum and frequency of neurologic complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in leukemia patients and to determine a risk profi le in these patients during a fourteen years period in our center. Materials and methods: The records of all patients who received a HSCT for leukemia at Nemazee hospital in Shiraz University of medical sciences between1993-2007 were reviewed. A total of 105 patients (AML = 55, ALL = 26, CML = 24) were included in this study. We had 37 female and 68 male patients with mean age of 24.4 year. Conditioning chemotherapy regimen included busulfan14-16 mg/kg and cyclophosphamide 120-200 mg/kg. Graft versus host prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine A in combination of methotrexate. Only severe neurological complications were included in this study. A severe neurological event was defi ned as neurological event that contributed to signifi cant worsening of the clinical condition of the patient. Patients with encephalopathy and persistent changes in consciousness, clinical fi ndings suggesting brain edema, cranial nerve involvement, hemiparalysis, visual disturbances (diplopia, ptosis, blurred vision) and those with seizure defi ned as neuro positive. Results: The patients with neurological events were 33 (32.4%) of cases. There were 55 patients with AML of whom 15 (27.2%) showed neurologic complication and 26 patients with ALL of whom 11 (42.3%) developed neurologic event. The incidence of neuro + was signifi cantly lower in AML than ALL but no signifi cantly different than that in CML (29.1%). The most common complications were visual disturbance (19%), seizure (6.7%) and decrease level of consciousness (4%). Mean serum cyclosporine level in patient with visual disturbance, seizure disorder and decrease level of consciousness were 218, 208 and 227 respectively which were not signifi cantly different from each other. Conclusion: We concluded that neurological complication are quite frequent in leukemic patients undergoing HSCT. Major causes are conditioning toxicity, metabolic disturbance, viral infection and cyclosporine toxicity. These patients should be observed carefully due to high risk of neurological complication. By close follow up and effective treatment in spite of high incidence, morbidities and mortalities of these complications can be decreased.",

Martinelli European Institute of Oncolgy (Milan, IT) Introduction: Reinfusion of autologous peripheral blood stem cells (APBSC) via a central venous catheter has been shown to be safe and to lead to successful engraftment. Patients (pts) who undergo APBSC transplants may have already an indwelling Port-a-Cath (PAC) because of previous chemotherapy. Positioning of another temporary central venous catheter may be associated with an increase of infectious and thrombotic complications together with pts' distress. Methods: From January 1st 2008 to November 15th 2009, we performed 80 reinfusions of APBSC in 66 pts after high dose chemotherapy. Pts' median age was 48 years (19-69) with a M/ F ratio of 34/32; 60 pts were affected by hematologic malignancies and 6 by testicular cancer. Fifty-eight pts underwent a single APBSC transplant, while 5 and 3 received a double and a triple procedure, respectively. All pts had already placed a PAC in the subclavian vein for previous treatments. All PBSC reinfusions were performed via the transcutanous placement of a Huber point needle into the PAC. Before each reinfusion, the presence of bidirectional fl ow through the PAC was confi rmed and for safety reason a peripheral venous catheter was also put in place. Results: Overall the 80 reinfusion procedures were not associated with serious adverse events except for a NCI grade 1-2 hypotension and vomiting episode in 1 patient. In the entire study population, the total duration of PAC use for transplant related procedure, was 1396 days with a median of 18 days . Median number of CD34 + cells/kg reinfused was 3 \u00d7 10 6 ( 1.4-11.9 ). All pts had a successful engraftment; indeed, an absolute neutrophil count > 1000/mm 3 was reached in a median of 11 days (10-51) and a platelet count > 20.000/mm 3 , in a median of 10.5 days (7-53) . We also evaluated infectious complications and short-term occurrence of thrombotic events. A positive blood culture from the PAC developed in 1/66 patient during the marrow aplasia in two consecutive transplants and resolved with medical therapy. PAC removal was necessary, after engraftment, only in 1 patient on a total of 1396 days of use, for mechanical complications. No thrombotic events occurred in the short-term. Conclusions: Reinfusion of APBSC via the PAC is safe and is not associated with infectious and short-term thrombotic complications. Most of all, it is effective and correlates with successful engraftment, which also suggests that it does not cause any signifi cant damage to the CD34 + cells infused.",

Blaise Institut Paoli Calmettes (Marseille, FR) GF or relapse is a common and life-threatening complication of SCT. Here, we report our experience of second transplantation of 22 patients treated at our cancer centre at Marseille from January 1992 at today. Patients' data were collected from a maintained database and by retrospective clinical chart review. Gender: M/F (15/7); median age at diagnosis was 35 years (17-42). Median age at the fi rst allo-SCT was 38 years (18-49); median age at second allo-SCT was 38 years (20-49). 9 patients (41%) had acute myeloid leukemia. The median interval between the two transplants were 10 months (range 0,5-131). The fi rst transplantation was administered after myeloablative conditioning for hematologic malignancies (n = 10), reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) (n = 12). The second conditioning consisted of Flu and ATG-based nonmyeloablative regimen in 86% (n = 19). 19 patients (86%) received a graft from a family donor, 3 patients had a MUD, and 2 patients received cord blood cells donors. 15 patients (68%) had the same donor for the two transplantation. 13 patients (59%) received the second allo-SCT because of disease progression and 7 patients (32%) because a graft failure. All 22 patients, but one, acquired quick and sustained engraftment after the second transplant. Treatment-related toxicity was minimal. Five patients developed acute GVHD (>grade II = 1). Five patients developed chronic GVHD (limited = 3, extensive = 2). In all, only 3 patients died from transplant related mortality (TRM), 11 patients (79%) because of relapse or disease progression. Actually 8 patients (36%) are still alive with a median follow up of 25 months IC95% (13.8 -52.7). Overall survival at 2 years and 5 years was 63% and 41% respectively. And the TRM was 9,4% at 2 and 5 years.",

Kim (2) (1)Soonchunhyang University Hospital (Seoul, KR); (2)Samsung Medical Center (Seoul, KR) ; (3) Background: Increasing number of autologous or allogeneic allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) performed in Korea in this decade resulted in substantial requirement for second HSCT as a result of the recurrence of primary disease or graft failure. Since Dec 2008, second HSCT has been approved by Korean government to be covered by national health insurance reimbursement system. The current study analyzed the outcome of second allogeneic HSCT because of no available data on the transplant outcomes following second allogeneic HSCT in Korea. Methods: Transplant data were collected retrospectively from 8 transplant centers in Korea. Inclusion criteria are as follows. 1) age equal or over 15 years old, 2) hematologic malignancies excluding aplastic anemia, PRCA, PNH or solid tumor, 3) patients who underwent second alloHSCT regardless of source of stem cell except cord blood transplantation (CBT). Results: Sixty four pts were included with following diagnoses: AML (n = 29), ALL (n = 5), CML (n = 3), lymphoma (n = 19), myeloma (n = 6), and others (n = 2). The median age was 37 (range . The fi rst transplantation had been performed with autologous 38 (59.4%) or allogeneic 26 (40.6%) donors. The donors for second HSCT were HLA-identical sibling 33 (47%), unrelated 31 (49%), or haploidentical donor 2 (3%). Conditioning regimen included TBI-based myeloablative 6 (9%), non TBI myeloablative 19 (30%), or reduced intensity regimen 38 (60%). With median 16 months of follow up (range, 3 to 93 months), 32 pts died of transplant related toxicity (n = 28; 70%), recurrence of primary disease (n = 10; 22.5%) or other (n = 4; 9.5%). After second HSCT, 56% were in complete remission, 38% in partial remission, and 6% were refractory. The 1-and 2-year overall survival rate was 46% and 35%, respectively. In univariate analysis, factor highly signifi cantly associated with better survival were fi rst HSCT (ASCT vs. allogenic HSCT) and conditioning regimen (non-TBI based regimen vs. TBI based regimen). Conclusion: Second allogenic HSCT is a reasonable option for selected patients in Korean patients with 35% of 2 year survival rate. S115 hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, persisting host APC activate donor T cells and thereby play a critical role for initiating acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Manipulation or depletion of APC may be a means for preventing this alloreactivity. However, many potential APC-modifying agents like monoclonal antibodies are species-specifi c and preclinical models are lacking. We therefore generated a model system using human skin xenografts transplanted between the scapulae of NOD/LtSz-scid IL2Rgamma-null (NSG) mice. First, we analyzed the impact of xeno-transplantation on the distribution of LC as well as dermal HLA-DR positive APC in the grafted skin. During wound healing, LC vanished from the epidermis after the second week and were undetectable until they repopulated the dermis 6-8 weeks after transplantation. In contrast, HLA-DR positive dermal cells were present at any time after transplantation. The re-establishment of human LC in the xenotransplants supports the hypothesis of a local LC-reconstituting population that is independent of precursors from the peripheral blood. To induce GVHD, CD8 T cells of a HLA-class I mismatched third-party donor were stimulated with DC generated from peripheral blood of the skin-donors in mixed lymphocyte DC cultures (MLDC) with. We injected the allo-reactive MLDC-T cells into the tail veins of mice 8 to 12 weeks after skin transplantation and detected an erythematous reaction in the xenograft approximately 1 week after T-cell transfer. We also found histological signs of acute skin GVHD as well as infi ltrating T cells and a loss of LC. This observation is consistent with studies showing that infi ltrating allo-reactive donor T cells deplete persisting host APC. In contrast, using skin from an area of previous gamma-irradiation lacking LC, we were not able to induce skin rash or histological signs of GHVD by injection of allo-reactive T cells. In summary, we introduce a model-system for acute skin GVHD using human xenotransplantats and adoptive T cell transfer in NSG mice. We also provide data supporting the hypothesis of a local LC-repopulating precursor population in human skin. This model might improve our understanding of the role of APC in human GVHD and help to determine how APC-modulating strategies could contribute to prophylaxis and treatment of GVHD.",

Liebig, M. von Bergwelt-Baildon University Hospital of Cologne (Cologne, DE) Statins are lipid-lowering drugs, which interfere with cholesterol synthesis by competitive inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway. It has recently been shown that statins, apart from their lipidlowering potential, have pleiotropic effects on the immune system and possess anti-infl ammatory and immunomodulatory activity. We performed a gene expression analysis comparing resting B cells with CD40-activated B cells, which are potent antigen-presenting cells (APC), and demonstrated that following CD40-activation expression of the enzymes in the mevalonate pathway was up-regulated. In accordance with these results simvastatin inhibited the proliferation and adhesion of resting B cells which were activated via CD40. In addition, the expression of MHC class II (HLA-DR) and the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 was reduced. This inhibition was dose-dependent and doses as low as 0.1 \u03bcM simvastatin induced a signifi cant reduction of B cell activation. This resulted in a decreased antigen-presenting capacity of simvastatin-treated B cells as was shown by a reduction in the proliferation of CD4 and CD8 T cell induced by allogeneic simvastatin-treated B cells. The concentration of simvastatin that was required for the inhibition of T cell proliferation was at least 10-times higher than that required for the inhibiton of antigen-presentation by B cells. This effect was mainly dependent on the inhibition of mevalonate production since addition of excess mevalonate almost completely restored B cell activation. Surprisingly, the hydrophilic statin pravastatin did not lead to inhibition of the antigen-presenting function of B cells. In addition to these in vitro results we also observed an inhibitory effect of simvastatin in human subjects in vivo. Our results concerning the effects of statins on human APCs in conjunction with the observation made by others that preemptive treatment with a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor protected mice from graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) without impairing the graft-versus-leukemia effect provide the rational for further testing of statins in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantion. The exquisite sensitivity of APCs to statin-mediated inhibition could result in synergistic effects with conventional immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine A which primarily target T cells.",

Thus, we established a xenograft-transplantation model using humanized NOD/SCID/IL2Rgc-null (NSG) mice to evaluate human GVH-and GVL-immunity of modifi ed donor T cells in vivo. In order to study the clinical relevance of human T cell traffi cking to tissues in this model we subcutaneously implanted human skin substitutes composed of collagen embedded primary allogeneic fi broblasts into NSG mice and detected murine vascularisation within 2 weeks. Following transfer of HLA-mismatched or haploidentical T cells, up to 23% of T cells migrated into substitutes explanted 21 days post injection. As this migration and homing involves both murine and human adhesion molecules we further examined the adhesion mechanisms underlying the egress of human T cells from the murine bloodstream. Using laminar fl ow chamber and real-time video recording experiments we fi rst demonstrated fi rm adhesion of human, polyclonally prestimulated T lymphocytes but not naive T cells to the murine endothelial cell line bEND.3 at shear stresses of up to 3.5 dynes/cm 2 when compared to human umbilical vein endothelial cells used as positive control. Adhesion and transmigration was signifi cantly enhanced upon preincubation of both human and murine endothelial cells (ECs) with TNF-a (5 ng/ml) to resemble an activated phenotype. Firm adhesion of activated T cells was suppressed following blocking of anti-integrin-a4 (CD49d) or anti-integrin-aL (CD11a) with antibody (Ab) or when ECs were preincubated with anti-VCAM-1 (CD106). In contrast, no inhibition was observed in the presence of anti-Endoglin (CD105) Ab included as specifi city control suggesting that CD49d and its ligand VCAM-1 as well as CD11a are required for extravasation of human T cells. In vitro studies using primary murine ECs and in vivo blocking experiments are in progress to verify our results and will be reported. As the same ligand-receptor pairs are described for human T-EC interaction these fi ndings indicate a closely related mechanism of T cell extravasation in human and murine endothelium at least in our model. In conclusion these results suggest that transferred activated human T cells migrate into allogeneic skin substitutes in NSG mice involving VCAM-1 and CD49d as well as CD11a for fi rm adhesion followed by transmigration.",

Koenecke, A. Ganser, R. F\u00f6rster, I. Prinz Hannover Medical School (Hannover, DE) Background: Recently IFN-g producing exFoxP3 cells, i.e. reverted from FoxP3 + to FoxP3-, have been discussed as particularly harmful effector T cells. Induced antigen-specifi c FoxP3 + T cells (iTregs) were discussed as a promising alternative to polyclonal natural FoxP3 + T cells for cell-based therapies. However, we have previously shown that iTregs, in contrast to nTregs, failed to prevent lethal GvHD in a C57BL/6 into BALB/c mouse model of acute GvHD. Here we evaluated the potential of induced and natural Treg cells to produce IFN-g and other cytokines. Methods: Using FoxP3-reporter mice (C56BL/6), we established an efficient protocol to induce and expand alloantigen-specific iTregs from FoxP3-CD4 + T cells with allogeneic cluster-disrupted dendritic cells (BALB/c). In a C57BL/6 into BALB/c mouse model of acute GvHD we monitored the intracellular cytokine expression of the Treg populations using a congenic marker. For measurement of serum cytokines at different days after BMT we used a cytokine bead array. Results: Both, nTregs and iTreg populations produced massive amounts of IFN-g in vivo at day 4 and day 8 after allogeneic BMT. Even though IFNg secretion was seen in nTregs, groups of mice receiving nTregs were protected from GvHD. However, we detected large amounts of other proinfl ammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNFa and MCP-1 only in the serum of control groups without Tregs and in particular in groups of mice that received iTregs. Interestingly, the production of the pro-infl ammatory cytokine IL-17 was exclusively observed in exFoxP3 cells, mainly derived from reverted iTregs. Conclusions: Our data suggest that IFN-g should not be regarded as an adverse pro-infl ammatory cytokine since it is readily produced by protective nTregs under the highly infl ammatory environment of acute GvHD. Rather, the capacity to produce IL-17 might highlight the dangerous plasticity of induced regulatory T cell subtypes in contrast to natural Tregs.",

Willemze, J.H.F. Falkenburg, M. Griffi oen Leiden University Medical Center (Leiden, NL) HLA-matched allogeneic stem cell transplantation (aSCT) is an effective treatment for hematological malignancies. However, T-cells recognizing minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHA) can mediate detrimental graft versus host disease (GvHD). We recently identifi ed 5 HLA II restricted MiHA which were not directly recognized on non-hematopoietic cells even after HLA class II upregulation by cytokine treatment. However, it was recently shown in mice (Wang, ASH 2009, abstract no. 689 ) that indirect presentation of host antigens by donor antigen presenting cells (APC) contributed to CD4 + T cell mediated GvHD. Here, we analyzed whether this is a general phenomenon by analyzing processing and inter-cellular transfer of six HLA II restricted antigens. As a model to investigate recognition by CD4 + T cells, we introduced genes of six different MiHA as well as their respective HLA class II alleles into the non-hematopoietic HeLa cell line. Antigen processing was analyzed after retroviral transfer of invariant chain (Ii) with or without HLA-DM. Inter-cellular transfer of antigens from MiHA positive cells to cells expressing the restriction HLA molecules was analyzed by co-incubation of HLA II + /MiHA-cells with HLA II-/MiHA + cells or their supernatants. Recognition of all HLA class II restricted MiHA was increased upon transduction of Ii. Additional transfer of HLA-DM, however, had divergent effects. Following HLA-DM transfer 3 of the MiHA were similarly recognized (DM-resistant), whereas recognition of the other 3 MiHA was completely abolished (DMsensitive). We observed inter-cellular transfer of DM-resistant, but not DM-sensitive, MiHA to MiHA-/HLA II + cells after co-incubation with MiHA + /HLA II-cells. Also in the absence of direct cell-cell contact the antigen could be transferred by cellderived particles as was shown by incubation with supernatant from MiHA + cells. This transfer was not mediated by free peptides as 30kDa fi ltration of the supernatant abolished recognition. In summary, we show that some antigens can be inter-cellularly transferred leading to T cell recognition of MiHA-/HLA II + cells. However, this phenomenon was restricted to a group of antigens that showed HLA-DM-resistant processing and presentation. These data suggest that late after aSCT, when patient-derived APCs are replaced by the donor, only HLA-DM-resistant MiHA may be indirectly presented by donor APC, and therefore not every MiHA mismatch may evoke late onset GvHD.",

Labalette (1) (1)Immunologie (Lille, FR); (2)UAM Allo-CST (Lille, FR) Background: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation provides donor-derived mature T cells which are involved in engraftment, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity, and thus play a major role in determining clinical outcome. In a prior clinical study, we showed that receiving a high percentage of CD4 + CCR7 + T cells is correlated with increased incidence and severity of acute GVHD without infl uencing other clinical events. As recipients and their allogeneic donors were 10/10 HLA-matched, these alloreactive CD4 + T cells recognized minor histocompatibility antigens (mHAs). The aim of the present study was to compare the in vitro response to allogeneic mHAs of the CD4 + CCR7 + CD45RA + na\u00efve T cells and the CD4 + CCR7 + CD45RAneg central memory T cells. Materials and methods: The alloreactive response to mHAs was investigated by a mixed lymphocyte dendritic cell reaction using fi ve HLA-identical healthy male and female sibling pairs to include at least a H-Y mismatch. Stimulators were mature dendritic cells (derived from monocytes of the male sibling) co-cultured with each one of the three highly purifi ed CD4 + T cell subsets (naive, central memory and effector memory) from the female sibling. Alloreactive response was assessed by 3H thymidine incorporation at day 5, and functionally at day 4, 6 and 10 by IFN-gamma ELISpot and measurement of Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines in co-culture supernatants. Results: Four out of fi ve sibling pairs developed an alloreactive response to mHAs. Maximal proliferation was supported by the CCR7 + CD45RA + naive CD4 + T cells with proliferation indices from 1.75 to 3.85 . This proliferation was accompanied by a functional differentiation: only na\u00efve CD4 + T cells were able to produce signifi cant amounts of IL-6, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma at day 6 and day 10 (120 to 174 IFN gamma spots at day 10). Conclusion: This study demonstrates the superior capacity of naive CD4 + T cells to mount a primary alloreactive response to minor histocompatibility antigens as compared to central memory T cells. Their proliferative response associated with a proinfl ammatory differentiation makes na\u00efve CD4 + T cells potential acute GVHD inducers. These in vitro results strengthen the idea that a partial depletion of na\u00efve CD4 + T cells from the graft might reduce the risk of acute GvHD.",

As syngeneic controls we used C57Bl/6 (H-2b) recipients. To prove specifi city of the functional assay we transplanted ovalbumine specifi c T cells into conditioned mice that expressed ovalbumine ubiquitously.

This CD107 surface mobilization assay allowed us to identify alloreactive T cells before the onset of aGvHD.

The preclinical data from our in vivo experiments encourage translation of this predictive test to patients undergoing allo-HCT.",

Yaniv (1) (1)Schneider Children's Medical Center (Petach Tikva, IL); (2)GSAR Biotechnology (Kfar Sava, IL) Graft vs. host disease (GVHD), which causes signifi cant morbidity and mortality following stem cell transplantation, can be ameliorated by administration of regulatory T cells (Treg) cells expressing CD25 (a subunit of the Interleukin-2 receptor) in conjunction with CD4 and FOXP3. We tested the effects of in-vitro incubation of splenocytes in medium containing a chimeric IL-2/caspase-3 (IL-2/cas) protein on the elaboration of GVH reactions in mice undergoing stem cell transplantion. IL-2/cas induces apoptosis of CD-25 positive cells that internalize the caspase subunit via cognate IL-2 receptors. Although IL-2/cas preferentially deletes CD25 + splenocytes, signifi cant fractions of both CD25low (putative effector cells) and CD25highFoxP3 + cells (putative Treg) remained viable after 48 hours of exposure to the chimeric protein in vitro. The effect of IL-2/cas on GVHD was tested in a parent to F1 transplant ((H2K[b] to H2K[b/d]) model. Recipients were infused with parental bone marrow + 2 \u00d7 10 7 viable H2K[b] splenocytes pre-incubated for 48 hours in either control medium or medium containing IL-2/cas. Lipopolysaccharide was administered on post-transplant day 7 to trigger hyper-acute GVHD. All recipients of control splenocytes died of GVHD within 3 days of LPS injection, whereas 60% of the recipients of IL-2/cas splenocytes survived for more than 4 weeks. A marked reduction of infl ammatory infi ltrates in skin, liver, and intestine were seen in mice infused with IL-2/cas splenocytes as compared with tissues harvested from premorbid mice in the control group. Analysis of the splenocytes harvested from surviving mice revealed inverted CD4/CD8 ratios, with preserved lymphocyte proliferative responses to Concanavalin A. Interestingly, lymph nodes harvested from mice who received IL-2/cas incubated splenocytes contained higher numbers of FoxP3 + cells as compared to control mice examined 24 hours post-LPS injection. Administration of IL-2/cas incubated splenocytes to mice with established GVHD had no effect on the course of their disease. Elimination of CD25 + cells by IL-2/cas early in the course of the GVH reaction ameliorated the course of GVHD and dramatically improved survival in this stringent GVHD model, but the effect of this incubation on putative Treg responses requires further evaluation. Future experiments will evaluate the effect of IL-2/cas on graft vs. tumor effects.",

Herr Johannes Gutenberg-University (Mainz, DE) Reducing the incidence of severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains the major challenge in patients who receive stem cell transplants from HLA-mismatch donors. Selective depletion of alloreactive donor T cells can prevent GVHD, but is still a complex technical procedure that requires the in vitro culture of T cells for several days. Here, we studied CD8 T cell subsets of 5 healthy donors, sorted by fl ow cytometry according to expression of the differentiation markers CD45RA, CD45RO, CCR7 and CD62L for the ability to respond to allo-HLA class I alleles in vitro. To detect pure alloreactive T cell responses and minimize the interference by other specifi cities, we used HLA-defi cient K562 cells transfected with single HLA-A, -B or -C alleles for weekly stimulations. We observed the strongest anti-HLA mismatch proliferation in sorted CCR7pos and CD62Lpos fractions, comprising naive (TN) and central memory CD8 T cells (TCM). In contrast, the CCR7neg and CD62Lneg counterpart fractions containing effector memory (TEM) and terminal effector CD8 T cells showed much lower allo-HLA induced in vitro expansion. The CD45RApos subset enriched for TN cells and devoid of TCM and TEM cells demonstrated less strong allo-proliferation compared to corresponding CD45RAneg cells. Low allo-proliferation was observed for CD45ROpos and CD45ROneg populations. Interestingly, the growth pattern of CD8 T cell subsets was consistent, regardless of HLA-A, -B, or -C mismatch alleles were used for stimulation. Cultures derived from all CD8 T cell subsets were analyzed for allo-HLA class I reactivity by IFN-g ELISPOT assay starting on day 11. The strongest anti-HLA mismatch reactivity was detected in the CCR7pos subset. Lower level of alloreactivity was observed in CD62Lpos, CD45ROneg, and CD45RApos fractions. All counterpart fractions showed even less strong anti-HLA responses. Again, these fi ndings were consistent for all HLA alleles tested. Our results thus demonstrate that distinct CD8 T cell subsets vary substantially in the ability to respond to HLA class I mismatch alleles. Although all subsets enriched for TN and TCM produced substantial alloreactivity, the CCR7pos fraction exceeded others in terms of proliferation and effector function. Thus, in vitro removal of CCR7pos CD8 T cells may be a straightforward culture-independent allodepletion procedure. Further experiments comparing anti-HLA mismatch and self-HLA-restricted anti-leukemia reactivity of T cell subsets are ongoing.",

Moreover, while the absence of aGvHD is associated with a higher risk of relapse of the underlying malignant disease, severe aGvHD usually induces the occurrence of life-threatening complications such as severe infections. The NOD2 gene polymorphisms (SNPs)(Arg702Trp, Gly908Arg and L1007fsinsC), which characterizes Crohn's disease, have shown to be associated with the risk to develop GI aGvHD and further transplant-related complications. Aims: To assess a contribution of Arg702Trp, Gly908Arg and L1007fsinsC NOD2 polymorphisms and to search for likely correlation in clinical GvHD occurrence in patients affected by haematological malignancies receiving allogeneic HSCT in Italian population. Materials and methods: One hundred and six HLA-matched donors/recipients pairs (R/D) and 824 healthy controls (HC) were genotyped for Arg702Trp, Gly908Arg and L1007fsinsC polymorphisms by using the TaqMan allelic discrimination method. Genotype frequencies were compared in respect to III-IV GvHD, gastrointestinal GvHD, and TRM. Results: The investigated SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both controls, donors and recipients. Signifi cant allele and genotype association with Gly908Arg and recipients group (P = 0.02, OR = 2.4, P = 0.008, OR = 2.6 ; CI = 1.2-5.3, respectively) was shown, with a subsequently signifi cant difference of allele frequency only in GI GvHD group (P = 0.03, OR = 4.74, ). After stratifying the R/D pairs on the basis of NOD2 genotypes (NOD2-= no major variants; NOD2 + = at last one variant), only a trend towards NOD2 + pairs with GI GvHD (33%), III-IV GvHD (30%), and TRM (33%), compared with group without GvHD (23%), was also demonstrated. Conclusion: The 908Arg (risk allele) variation has shown to be mainly associated with recipients who developed GI GvHD. In addition, in R + D/NOD2 + pairs, a trend towards in GI GvHD, III-IV GvHD and TRM, was also demonstrated.",

Hatakeyama (2) , H. Tsutsumi (2) , Y. Kokai (1) (1)Department of Biomedical Engineering (Sapporo, JP); (2) Department of Pediatrics (Sapporo, JP) Objectives: Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a major life-threatening complication and we have recently shown that CC chemokine-ligand motif 8 (CCL8) is a potential biomarker for early diagnosis of GVHD. In this study, we further examined whether CCL8 can serve as a biomarker for GVHD in mice. Moreover, we supposed to analyze how CCL8 protein expresses in vitro. Methods: Recipient mice (Balb/c) received allogeneic bone marrow (BM) transplantation (BMT) from the donor mice (C57BL/6) after lethal total body irradiation. To make severe GVHD model, allogeneic 2 \u00d7 10 7 BM cells plus spleen cells of C57BL/6 ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 \u00d7 10 7 were added. The control mice were transplanted 2 \u00d7 10 7 syngeneic BM cells. Plasma was obtained on days 5, 7, 14, 21, and 28 after BMT, and CCL8 and IFN-gamma levels were measured using enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Survival rate was monitored daily and GVHD clinical score was assessed weekly. GVHD histopathologic grading was performed on day 14 after BMT. To analyze the expression mechanism of CCL8, Balb/ c derived dendritic cells (DCs) and C57BL/6 derived spleen cells were used for mixed lymphocyte reactions. After 96 hours of culture, CCL8 protein in the culture supernatant could be detected by ELISA. Results: In vivo analysis revealed that the level of plasma IFNgamma peaked at day 7 and rapidly dropped despite prominent GVHD, whereas CCL8 remained high unless cyclosporine A was administered. Survival rate was found to be parallel to the plasma CCL8 level at day 5. When plasma CCL8 on day5 was more than 2000 ng/mL, the survival rate at day 28 was signifi cantly lower. Furthermore, plasma CCL8 levels at day 5 correlated with both clinical and pathological score at day 14 of GVHD. In vitro study revealed that the host derived DCs and donor derived CD4 + T cells are suffi cient to express CCL8. This expression was abrogated by an antibody for MHC class II. Neutralizing IL-2, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha decreased CCL8 levels in vitro. Conclusions: These fi ndings suggest that plasma CCL8 might prove diagnostically helpful in evaluating GVHD at least in mice. As a biomarker for GVHD, CCL8 is worth evaluating further with human samples. And further investigation about the role of CCL8 in the pathogenesis of GVHD is required.",

Based upon the previously described powerful effect of costimulation blockade by CTLA-4 Ig in vivo for tolerance induction in solid organ-transplantation we began to explore whether CTLA-4 Ig used in an ex-vivo approach is effective to tolerize T cells specifi cally against allo-antigens without global immunosuppression. When spleen-derived CD11c + dendritic cells (DCs) from C57BL/6 mice were co-cultured with allogeneic Balb/c-derived CD3 + T cells in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) we found that the addition of 100 \u03bcg/ml CTLA-4 Ig to the co-cultures inhibited the proliferative allogeneic T cell response, (assessed S119 by CFSE dilution) by 80% ( \u00b1 10%). Further experiments investigated whether CTLA-4 Ig acts by affecting preferentially the stimulator population (as previously suggested by Grohmann et al., Nat Immunol 2002) . By using several isoforms of CTLA-4 Ig (IgG1 and IgG3 isotypes) we found that a pre-exposure of DCs alone to CTLA-4 Ig induced the release of enhanced amounts of interferon-gamma but did not up-regulate the enzymatic activity of the tryptophan-metabolizing enzyme indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase, and did not down-regulate the subsequent allogeneic T cell proliferative response. Likewise, pre-exposing stimulated T cells alone with CTLA-4 Ig left the capability to subsequently proliferate unaffected. These fi ndings suggested that CTLA-4 Ig neither promoted suppressor activity in DCs nor affected the responsiveness of T cells, but directly affected the interaction of stimulator and responder cells in co-cultures. CTLA-4 Ig, however, when added to cocultures, yielded a T cell population with a CD4 + CD25high, putatively regulatory phenotype. Thus, CTLA-4 Ig, in addition to down-regulating the proliferative response, might induce regulatory activity in CD4 + T cells. This hypothesis is currently tested in an in-vivo approach (supported by the Austrian Science Foundation P#19865).",

For our study we recruited 21 healthy individuals (female and male, mean age 24,9 years). We analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells by fl ow cytometry at 8 time points over 3 weeks. Preliminary mouse experiments had determined these time points as critical for subsequent prospective clinical studies. We found that the surface marker expression on peripheral blood T cells in healthy individuals can be subdivided into 3 categories: 1. Constant low numbers of cytotoxic and T helper cells expressed CD25, CD69, chemokine receptor (CCR) 2, CCR10, CXCR1 (on T helper cells only), CXCR2, cutaneous lymphocyte antigen, leukotriene B4 receptor 1 and integrin alpha E. 2 . Constant high numbers of T cells expressed CD45RA, integrin alpha 4 and L-selectin. 3 . T cell subsets that changed dynamically the expression of CCR1, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, CCR8, CCR9, CXCR1 (on cytotoxic T cells only), CXCR3 and integrin beta 7. These data from healthy individuals established the basis for a recently initiated clinical prospective study. The measured receptor expression profi les were important to determine physiological ranges to compare them to allo-HCT patients. The data from the healthy probands encourage further investigations with patients undergoing allo-HCT to fi nd an effi cient and reliable method to predict aGvHD.",

Mousset (2) , W.-K. Hofmann (1), H. Martin (2) (1)Medical University (Mannheim, DE) ; (2) Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University (Frankfurt, DE) Steroid-refractory intestinal acute Graft versus Host Disease (aGvHD) is a mayor complication after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In steroid-refractory aGVHD survival rate is low. A promising strategy is the use of pentostatin, an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase. We report the long term results with a median follow up of six years of a single centre study on salvage therapy of aGvHD by pentostatin. 23 patients transplanted between 1999 and 2006 at Frankfurt medical school with steroid refractory severe intestinal aGvHD overall grade III or IV with a follow-up of at least 30 months were included. All patients except one received peripheral blood stem cells. The mean age was 45 (range: 25-61) years. The underlying diseases were ALL (3), AML (17), Multiple myeloma (1), Hodgkin\u00b4s disease (1) and CML (1). GvHD prophylaxis was ciclosporine based in combination with mycophenolate mofetil or with methotrexate. All patients suffered from severe intestinal aGvHD. 16 patients developed a concomitant skin, fi ve a liver involvement. The overall grade of GvHD was III in 8 patients and IV in 15 patients. The stage of gut GvHD was 2 (1x), 3 (14x) and 4 (8x). Pentostatin was applied as salvage therapy (1 mg/m 2 / x3 days, 1-4 cycles, q22) after a therapy of at least two days of prednisolone (\u2265 2 mg/kg/d). Therapy was well tolerated. No severe neutropenia or thrombocytopenia occurred. Except one case of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) renal function was not affected. 16 patients (82,6%) achieved a complete, three a partial remission of aGvHD. Clinical improvement occurred typically after 12-15 days. Four patients died before day 12 without improvement of GvHD symptoms. All patients with an at least 12 day survival responded. Ten patients are still alive (median follow up: 1853 days, range: 953-3049). All one-year survivors stayed alive. 13 patients died (3 \u00d7 relapse of leukemia, 10 \u00d7 therapy related). The long term overall survival rate is 43,5%. Of the ten long term survivors three experienced no chronic GvHD (cGvHD), three had limited and four extensive cGvHD. Five patients are under ongoing immunosuppressive therapy. In conclusion, pentostatin at a dose of 1 mg/m 2 /d for 3 days is a highly effective and well tolerated drug in severe steroid-refractory intestinal aGvHD with a high rate of long term survivors.",

Dickinson (1) (1)Newcastle University (Newcastle, UK); (2)Regensburg University Hospital (Regensburg, DE) Objective: Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a major complication of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). A number of infl ammatory cytokines/chemokines are implicated in GVHD. Several of these have been identifi ed in numerous single centre studies as potential biomarkers for acute and chronic GVHD without validation. We analysed the role of several infl ammatory biomarkers including B-cell activation factor (BAFF), IL-33, NALP6, NALP12, CXCL10 and CXCL11, in association with GVHD, in a two centre study. Method: Each biomarker was evaluated in serums collected pre-transplant and at various time-points post-transplant from patients with and without acute GVHD (aGVHD) and chronic GVHD (cGVHD). The levels of each biomarker were measured using ELISA. The expression of these biomarkers on GVHD target tissue was validated using the skin-explant assay by immuno-histo-chemistry. Results: Our results showed a significant decrease in soluble BAFF levels following conditioning (P < 0.01) indicating BAFF levels are influenced by the conditioning treatment. Although aGVHD patients had increased BAFF levels, we found BAFF was more strongly associated with cGVHD (P < 0.0005). Patients with pre-transplant elevated BAFF levels appeared more likely to develop GVHD and a strong association was observed between patients who developed aGVHD and those who developed cGVHD (87%). IL-33, a interleukin-1 family member was found to be increased following conditioning (P < 0.02) and during aGVHD (day 14-100, P < 0.03). IL-33 expression was strongly influenced by the type of conditioning regimen received. Mylobalative conditioning patients had elevated IL-33 levels. IL-33 was not associated with cGVHD. The chemokines CXCL10 and CXCL11 were elevated in grade II-III aGVHD patients compared to controls. However, they were significantly elevated in cGVHD patients 6 months and 12 months post-transplant, respectively (P < 0.001; P < 0.0001) (P < 0.02; P < 0.04). Analysis using the human in-vitro skin explant assay (a model for aGVHD) showed that levels BAFF, IL-33, NALP6, NALP12, CXCL10 and CXCL11 were significantly increased in patients with grade II-III Graft versus Host Reaction (GVHR) (P < 0.04, P < 0.004, P < 0.002, P < 0.049, P < 0.007 and P < 0.01, respectively). Conclusion: We show IL-33, NALP6 and NALP12 are associated with aGVHD while BAFF, CXCL10 and CXCL11 are strongly associated with the development of cGVHD. The study identifi es potential targets for novel therapies.",

            "text": "The NOD2/CARD15 gene encodes proteins which are critically involved in innate immunity and Crohn's disease. This proteins activate a nuclear factor NF-kB and are involved in intracellular pathogen recognition. TheNOD2/CARD15 espression is restricted to gut epithelial cells and cells of monocyte and macrophage lineage. In Crohn disease a variety of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NOD2/CARD15 gene (SNPs: 12, 13, 8) have been reported to increase the disease risk in European population. The prevalence of SNP13, SPN8 in Sardinian patients (pts) with Crohn disease has been found in 9,1% and 4,5% respectively, whilst in Sardinian controls the SNPs13 has been found in 0.1%. Considering the similitude between the pathophysiology of aGVHD with the infl ammatory bowel diseases, we hypothesized that genetic variant for NOD2/ CARD15 gene may have an impact on the gut GVHD. In this study we evaluated in 45 patients, receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from 36 related and 9 unrelated donors, the frequency of NOD2/CARD15 SNPs, in severe (\u2265 2) gut GVHD.The age of pt at transplant ranged from 1 to 35 years, the underlying diseases were: 41 Beta Thalassemia, 1 Kostman S, 1 LLA, 2 Histiocytosis. All pts received as source of HSCT only bone marrow. Prophilaxis of aGVHD in 36 pts receiving HSCT from unrelated donors. The gut decontamination included polymyxin in all the 45 pt. The cumulative severe gut aGVHD was (23/45) 51%. In 23 R and their D with aGVHD and in 9 aGVHD free the SNPs 8 and 13 of NOD2/CARD15 gene have been attributed, using PCR-RFLP technique. The NOD2/CARD 15 SNPs were subdivided in wild \u00a8Ctype, in SNP with 1 variant and SNPs with more than 1 variant in both D/R pair with and without gut aGVHD. Results: In the group with aGVHD both D and R resulted negative for NOD2/CARD15 variants whilst in the group without aGVHD 2 pairs of D/R were heterozygous for the SNP13 (9%). In one D but not in the R the SNP8 was found (4.5%). Conclusions: Our preliminary data seem to exclude in our population any involvement of NOD2/CARD15 gene variants in gastrointestinal aGVHD following HSCT. These data differ from data of other European populations and could indicate a lower mutation rate of NOD2/CARD15 gene in Sardinians. However, this different frequency of NOD2/RD15 gene variant must be taken into account when selecting the unrelated donor from BMT registry.",

Patriarca, S. Olendo, M. Cavallin, A. Sperotto, M.L. Battista, A. Michelutti, M. Medeot, D. Damiani, R. Fanin Hematological Division of Udine (Udine, IT) Background: Confl icting results are reported on the status of B-lymphopoiesis after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and particularly in patients with chronic Graft versus Host Disease (cGvHD). Several studies documented severe B-cell lymphocytopenia and hypogammaglobulinemia, whereas others data suggested a B-hyperactivity such as the production of pathological autoantibodies and the successful response to Rituximab in certain clinical manifestations of cGvHD. Objectives of the study: We evaluated the kinetics of B cell recovery and engraftment after allogeneic SCT in comparison with T, NK and myeloid cells. The fi nal objective was to identify if there was a correlation between B lymphocytes recovery and the development of cGvHD. Patients and methods: We studied prospectively 13 consecutive patients, median age 59 years (range 23-69). The hematopoietic chimerism was studied at day 90, 120 and 180 on whole PB, on immunomagnetically sorted CD3 + and CD19 + cells and on granulocyte fraction. Full donor chimerism (FDC) was defi ned as the presence of at least 95% donor cells. We evaluated B, T and NK cells in PB by immonophenotyping at day 30, 90, 120 and 180. Results: Thirteen patients developed cGvHD in median at 5 months after SCT, with at least 2 organs involved and a median score of 3 according the Organ Scoring System (Filipovich et al., BBMT, 2005) . CGvHD progressed from a pre-existent acute GvHD in 7 cases. No patient showed autoantibodies. We could not analyzed B cell chimerism at day 90 due to the low number of CD19 + , but at day 120 we found FDC in CD19 + cells of all patients, as well as in the others fractions. We observed a similar kinetics of CD3 + , CD4 + and CD8 + cells recovery in all patients, with the lowest cells concentrations at day 90 and a subsequent progressive increase at day 120 and 180. Patients with cGVHD showed a lower NK cells concentrations at day 90 in comparison with controls. All patients showed B cells concentrations no higher than 100/microliter from 90 to 180 days. However, the group with subsequent cGvHD showed lower B-cell concentrations at day 120 (P = 0.03) in comparison with controls. Conclusions: Severe B lymphocytopenia persisted through the fi rst 180 days after SCT. FDC could be observed in B cells of all patients at day 120 after SCT. Patients at risk of cGVHD had a signifi cative reduction of B cells concentrations at day 120. We are planning to extend the follow-up of the patients and to confi rm our results in a larger population.",

Conzelmann (1), M. Hess (1) , F. Neumann (2) , C. Falk (3) , U. Hegenbart (1), A.D. Ho (1) , P. Dreger (1) Steroid-resistant GVHD causes signifi cant morbidity and mortality. The pathomechanism of steroid-resistance is currently not understood. Nevertheless and despite the limited effi cacy of the approach, most salvage therapies target the T-cell arm of the disease by intensifying immunosuppression. Aaim and methods: In order to investigate the individual contribution of T-cells and endothelial cells in steroid-resistant GVHD, we compared kinetics of cytokeratin-18 fragments (CK18F) as quantitative markers of epithelial apoptosis, serum FAS ligand as T cell activation marker, and serum thrombomodulin (sCD141) and angiopoietin-2/VEGF ratio as markers of endothelial damage longitudinally in 21 patients with steroidresistant GVHD and 18 patients with steroid-sensitive GVHD. Results: Onset of GVHD was associated with a highly signifi cant increase of serum CK18F in both groups (P = 0.007). CK18F serum levels decreased following escalation of immunosuppression in patients with therapy-sensitive GVHD (P = 0.03), but not in patients with steroid-refractory disease. Late CK18F levels (d + 52 after escalation of immunosuppression) were highly predictive for survival (P < 0.001) in univariable cox regression analysis. Soluble FAS ligand levels were signifi cantly higher in patients with steroid-sensitive disease (P = 0.007), but decreased following immunosuppression in both groups (resistant P = 0.003, sensitive P = 0.046) indicating effi cient suppression of the T-cell response. However, a striking characteristic of steroid-resistant GVHD was progressive endothelial damage as shown by steadily increasing serum thrombomodulin (sCD141) levels coinciding with loss of CD141 expression on the surface of endothelial cells in intestinal GVHD sections. sCD141 was also predictive for survival in cox regression (P = 0.05) . Finally, the Angiopoietin-2/VEGF ratio in serum which was shown to indicate severe microangiopathic damage could also clearly distinguish between therapy-sensitive and refractory disease and was furthermore highly predictive for survival (P = 0.007). Conclusions: \"Steroid-resistance\" may refl ect a second, T-cell independent disease stage of progressive microangiopathy resulting in organ failure, which appears to be associated with defi ned serum marker signatures. The role of pre-existing or additional causes of endothelial damage contributing to the risk of steroid-refractoriness has to be further investigated.",

Bacigalupo (2) (1)Bolzano Central Hospital (Bolzano, IT); (2)San Martino's Hospital (Genoa, IT) Background and aim of the study: We have previously shown that chronic graft versus host disease (cGvHD) and transplant related mortality (TRM) can be predicted by three laboratory values on day + 100: platelets count (Plt), serum cholinesterase (CHE), gamma-glutamyltransferase (g-GT).We have further improved this scoring system by the addition of two new variables, in a larger number of patients. Patients and methods: The patient population consisted of 1088 consecutive patients with hematologic disorders allografted between 1990 and 2008, alive on day + 100 and free of cGvHD. The donor was an HLA identical sibling (n = 647) or an alternative donor (n = 361). The median follow-up was 1288 days (range 92-7237). The 3 previously described indicators (Plt, CHE, g-GT) remained signifi cant. Additional indicators were serum albumin and total iron binding capacity (TIBC). Median levels at day + 100 were used as cut off: Plt 100 \u00d7 10 9 /L, CHE 3500 IU/ml, g-GT 50 IU/L, TIBC 205 mg/dl, and albumin 3.9 gr/dl. Two prognostic groups were identifi ed: low risk (0-2 negative predictors), and high risk (3-5 negative predictors) . Results: The overall risk of developing moderate/severe cGVHD was 29% and the risk of TRM beyond day + 100 was 19%. The two risk groups identifi ed patients at different risk of cGvHD (24% vs. 35%,P = 0.0002) and of TRM (11% vs. 28%, P < 0.0001, see Table 1 ). Relapse related death was comparable in the 2 groups (20% vs. 23%, P = 0.2). The actuarial survival of the 2 groups at 10 years was 66% vs. 43% (P < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, including donor/recipient data, phase of disease, donor type, and year of transplant, the RR for patients with high day + 100 score was: RR 1.97 for overall mortality, 2.1 for cGvHD and 3.0 for TRM. In the previous, the RR for overall mortality was 1.5 , for chronic GvHD 1.4 and for TRM 1.69 . Death due to GvHD with/wo infections was 8% vs. 21% respectively in low/high risk patients (P < 0.001). Other predictors were year of transplant, donor age, disease phase, recipient gender and donor type. Conclusions: The use of 5 simple laboratory tests on day + 100 (Plt, CHE, g-GT, Albumin and TIBC) predicts cGvHD and mortality, with a greater accuracy as compared with our previous day + 100 score. Strategies to prevent cGvHD and delayed mortality may include immune-modulation with/wo intensifi ed infection prophylaxis in high risk patients.",

Cortelazzo Bolzano Central Hospital (Bolzano, IT) Histopathology has a critical role in diagnosis and management of Graft versus host disease (GvHD), a major complication after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The aim of the present retrospective study was to investigate the positive predictive value (PPV) of histopathology using a simple predictive score at the time of collecting biopsies for GvHD diagnosis. One hundred and fi fty-six consecutive bioptical samples were performed for GvHD diagnosis in 68 adult patients with hematological malignancies, allografted at our institution between 1999 and 2009. The biopsies were collected early at the onset of clinical manifestation suggestive of GvHD: 85 from skin, 67 from the gastrointestinal tract (GI) (stomach n = 43, colon n = 24), 4 liver biopsies and 1 from the lung (endotracheal). On the basis of a previous study (Cavattoni, ASH 2009, abstract online) , where sensitivity, specifi city, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the biopsies were calculated, 5 variables improving PPV were identifi ed:peripheral blood (PBSC) as source of stem cells, biopsy collected from upper GI tract, matched unrelated donor (MUD), reduced intensity conditioning (RIC), and biopsy collected from the lower GI tract. One to 3 points were arbitrarily assigned to the 5 variables which had a PPV \u2265 90%, according to the impact of their predictive value:PBSC with a PPV = 90%, 1 point, biopsy collected from upper GI tract with a PPV = 90%, 1 point, MUD with a PPV = 92%, 2 points, RIC with a PPV = 93%, 2 points, and biopsy collected from the lower GI tract with a PPV = 100%, 3 points. As previously reported, overall sensitivity and specificity of the histopathological test were 79% and 80% respectively. PPV was 86%, NPV was 71%. Applying the previously described score the patients were normally distributed and 3 subgroups were categorized:Group 1 (Score 0 point, 50 biopsies), Group 2 (Score 1-4, 90 biopsies) and Group 3 (Score > 4, 17 biopsies). PPV of the 3 identifi ed groups according to this score was 78%, 90% and 100% in groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively.The use of 5 simple clinical variables at the time of sampling (RIC, PBSC, MUD, biopsies collected from GI tract, i.e. stomach or colon) correlates with the positive predictive value of the biopsy. These preliminary data must be confi rmed by larger prospective case studies in order to optimize the role of histopathology in GvHD, and to reduce the number of false positive and false negative results.",

            "text": "Background: Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is one of the major problems after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). It has been reported that the fi brotic change in cGVHD is associated with the activation of transforming growth factor (TGF A) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) pathways, and this is inhibited by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including imatinib. Recent studies showed that imatinib was effective as salvage treatment for refractory cGVHD. It, however, remains unknown whether the administration of TKIs after SCT affects the incidence and severity of cGVHD. Patients and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data of transplantation recipients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PhALL) and compared between those with and without TKIs as prophylaxis against post-transplant relapse of Philadelphia chromosome positive leukemia. Results: We reviewed 96 patients, including 51 with PhALL and 45 with CML, and classifi ed them into a TKI group (n = 20) and a non-TKI group (n = 76) according to the administration of TKIs after SCT. The TKI group included signifi cantly more patients with PhALL and those with an alternative donor source. The 3-year cumulative incidence of cGVHD was 41.1% and 71.3% in the TKI and non-TKI groups, respectively (P = 0.0083). Cord blood (RR 0.129, P = 0.045) and the use of TKIs as a timedependent covariate (RR = 0.266, P = 0.013) were identifi ed as signifi cant independent predictive factors for a lower incidence of cGVHD. The overall severity of cGVHD was also signifi cantly lower in the TKI group (P = 0.029). Conclusion: Both the incidence and severity of cGVHD appeared to be reduced by a TKI. A large prospective trial is warranted to confi rm the prophylactic effect of TKIs on the incidence of cGVHD.",

Boelens (1) (1)UMCUtrecht (Utrecht, NL); (2)St Elisabeth Hospital (Tilburg, NL) ; (3)Tergooiziekenhuizen (Blaricum, NL) In lung transplantation, presence or early infection (<100d) with a common respiratory virus is associated with either acute or chronic rejection, presenting as Bronchiolitis Obliterans (BO). After hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) alloimmune lung syndromes (allo-LS), including Idiopathic Pneumonia Syndrome (IPS) and Bronchiolitis Obliterans (BO), also occur, but the role of respiratory viruses (RV) is unclear. In this prospective study we analysed the infl uence of common respiratory viruses early during HSCT on the development of allo-LS and survival. We included 110 paediatric patients with a median age of 5 years, who were transplanted for malignant (56) and nonmalignant (54) disease. Conditioning regimen was TBI based in 33, and chemotherapy based in 77. Family donors were used in 33 patients, unrelated donor grafts in 77. 56 transplantations were HLA matched, 54 had at least one HLA-locus mismatch. Stemcell source was cord blood in 33, and bone marrow or peripheral blood in 77. In 50% of patients RV infection occurred early after HSCT, at a median of day + 16. RV was proven by qPCR for respiratory viruses on nasopharyngeal aspirate. Rhinovirus was found most frequent, we also found parainfl uenzavirus-3, Infl uenza A virus, Coronavirus, Adenovirus or a combination of multiple viruses. Symptoms were mild, and all patients recovered spontaneously. After a period without symptoms of at least 2 weeks, new respiratory symptoms occurred in about 50% of the RV positive patients, all of them had allo-LS. In the whole cohort we found allo-LS in 27. 3% . Eighteen patients developed IPS (16.4%) and 12 BO (10.9%). Multivariable analysis showed that respiratory viral infection early after HSCT is an important predictor for the development of allo-LS (P < 0.0001). This was true for all respiratory viruses tested. Acute Graft versus Host Disease (aGVHD) in other organs, had a protective effect on the development of allo-LS (P = 0.004), most likely due to the higher and prolonged immunesuppression in this group of patients. Overall survival was 73%, in the allo-LS group survival was only 53%. In multivariable analyses allo-LS was the only predictor for higher mortality (P = 0.04). We hypothesize that early infection of the respiratory tract with a common cold virus make the lungs a target for alloimmunity, leading to life threatening lung disease.",

Chalandon (1) , D. Heim (2) , G. St\u00fcssi (3) , G. Nicoloso de Faveri (5) , J. Passweg (1) The relevance of HLA-DPB1 incompatibilities on clinical outcome after unrelated HSCT remains controversial, in part due to differences in patients studied and to variations in compatibility at the other HLA loci. In order to assess the impact of DPB1 matching we thus retrospectively typed consecutive unrelated HSCT donor/recipient pairs matched by high resolution typing at the HLA-A,B,Cw,DRB1/B3/B4/ B5, and DQB1 loci for DPB1 alleles. The study group comprised 249 patients transplanted in Switzerland between 1990-2008 with acute leukemias (45%), chronic leukemias (18%), myeloproliferative/dysplastic syndromes (17%), lymphomas/multiple myelomas (10%), aplastic anemias (3%), and other diseases (7%). T-cell depletion was performed on 23% patients. Of these 249 recipient/donor pairs, 30 (12%) were DPB1-compatible, 173 (69.5%) had 1 or 2 DPB1 mismatches, and 46 (18.5%) had a single and unidirectional disparity either in GVH or rejection direction only. Five-year overall survival estimates showed significant differences between donor/recipient pairs with one and two DPB1incompatibilities as compared to matched or uni-directional mismatched pairs (49% \u00b1 10% vs. 70% \u00b1 19%, P = 0.009). One or two HLA-DPB1 mismatches and uni-directional mismatches in GVHD but not in rejection direction were significantly associated with grade II-IV GVHD. When DPB1 mismatches were classified as permissive (P)/not permissive (NP) according to previously published algorithms (Crocchiolo et al., Blood 2009; 114: 1437) , neither overall survival nor aGVH incidence did correlate with the type of mismatches (Table) . Altogether these data clearly show a deleterious impact of HLA-DPB1 incompatibilities on aGVHD incidence. HLA-DPB1 typing may help in pretransplant risk assessments for GVHD and mortality. In patients with common HLA haplotypes, HLA-DPB1 matching may contribute to optimal donor selection once several 10/10 matched donors have been identifi ed.",

In one patient with HG-NHL a halt in progression for almost 4 months could be observed. Side effects (fever, chills and bone pain) were tolerable and appeared at antibody dose levels between 40 and 200 micro gram. Human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) were not detectable, allowing repeated treatment courses with FBTA05. Moreover, none of the responders evaluable for GvHD (survival > 100 days following DLI) revealed clinical signs of active GvHD although repeated applications of DLIs up to 1 \u00d7 10 8 T cells/kg body weight were performed. The cytokine profi le was characterized by transiently increased release of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10. Plasma concentrations of FBTA05 refl ected differences in treatment, but strictly correlated with the corresponding dosing schedules. The highest plasma concentrations of FBTA05 with 0.38 micro gram/mL were detectable after application of 2,000 micro gram FBTA05 accompanied by the rapid clearance of antibodies within few days. So far no signifi cant correlation with tumor burden or disease activity could be established. In summary, FBTA05 induced prompt anti-tumor responses in treatment-refractory patients. Moreover, the absence of GvHD after repeated courses of DLI indicates the potency of FBTA05 to redirect the graft-related allogeneic response towards lymphoma cells. Based on these encouraging results, a clinical phase I/II dose-escalation study of FBTA05 and DLI in patients with CD20-positive low and high grade B-cell lymphoma after allo-SCT is planned.",

Here, we investigated Treg cell numbers in patients at day 100 after HCT, at onset of cGVHD and during immunosuppressive therapies (IST). Patients and methods: Eighty-three consecutive patients (38 males, 45 females) including 27 without cGVHD, 38 with cGVHD and 18 with cGVHD given extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) were enrolled into our study a median of 156 (range, 69 to 838) days after HCT. Serial investigations of CD4 + CD25 high Foxp3 + T cells and other immune cell populations in the peripheral blood (PB) were performed by fl ow cytometric analysis and results were compared with clinical assessments of cGVHD activity according to the NIH consensus criteria. Results: Around day + 100 after HCT signifi cantly higher CD4 + CD25 high Foxp3 + T cells were seen in patients developing cGVHD thereafter compared to patients without cGVHD (mean 14.0 vs. 5.3 cells/mm 3 , P < 0.001). Furthermore, at onset cGVHD patients had signifi cantly higher CD4 + CD25 high Foxp3 + T cells compared to HCT patients without cGVHD (mean 15.0 vs. 6.5 cells/mm 3 , P = 0.014). In addition, CD4 + CD25 high Foxp3 + T cells differed signifi cantly between patients with mild, moderate and severe cGVHD with a mean of 13.4 (P = 0.02) vs. 18 .5 (P = 0.011) vs. 12.1 cells/mm 3 compared to patients without cGVHD. In serial analyses an increase of CD4 + CD25 high Foxp3 + T cells to normal levels was observed in patients without cGVHD until a mean of 270 days after HCT. Patients with cGVHD responding completely to IST remained high with CD4 + CD25 high Foxp3 + T cells with a mean of 16.9 cells/mm 3 compared to 26.5 cells/mm 3 and 8.8 cells/mm 3 in patients with partial resolution or no response to IST. Also, patients responding to ECP remained high with CD4 + CD25 high Foxp3 + T cells (mean 16.0 cells/mm 3 ) during and at the end of therapy. Conclusions: High Treg cells are predictive of cGVHD. Whereas patients with active cGVHD have signifi cantly elevated Treg cells, resolution of cGVHD is not accompanied by normal Treg numbers. Further studies with longer followup will be required to assess Treg reconstitution in cGVHD patients.",

Kuzmina, S. Eder, A. Boehm, L. Vormittag, P. Kalhs, V. Petkov, G. Stary, J. Nepp, H. Greinix Medical University of Vienna (Vienna, AT) Recently, the NIH Consensus Development Project on Criteria for Clinical Trials in chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) established new criteria for diagnosis and staging of cGVHD severity based on retrospective data and expert opinion. For both acute as well as cGVHD new defi nitions were proposed. However, their prognostic relevance with regard to patients' outcome is currently unclear. We performed a prospective study on all consecutive patients undergoing allogeneic hemato poietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) since 2005 to assess the prognostic impact of the new cGVHD staging criteria. Patients: One hundred seventy-eight patients (85 males, 93 females) with a median age of 40 (range, 20-65) years alive on day + 100 after HCT with myeloablative (n = 110) or reduced-intensity (n = 68) conditioning and a related (n = 37) or unrelated (n = 141) stem cell donor were enrolled into the study. Fifteen received bone marrow, 162 blood stem cells and 1 unrelated cord blood with a median of 6.6 (range, 1.33-14) \u00d7 10 6 CD34-positive cells per kg body weight. Starting on day + 100 after HCT all patients were assessed clinically every 3 months in the Outpatient Clinic for cGVHD activity according to the NIH consensus criteria (Filipovich AH et al., BBMT 2005; 11: 945-956) . Results: One hundred twenty-six (71%) patients experienced prior acute GVHD grades I to IV including 11 with recurrent, 15 with persistant, and 11 with late onset acute GVHD. Median time to onset of acute GVHD was 18 (range, 9-120) days after HCT. On day + 100 ten patients had acute GVHD whereas 63 (35%) had cGVHD including 45 with classic cGVHD and 18 with overlap syndrome, respectively. The overall incidence of cGVHD in our cohort was 69% with cGVHD occurring after a median of 151 (range, 82-510) days after HCT. Ninety-two patients (75%) had classic cGVHD and 31 (25%) overlap syndrome. After a median follow-up of 25 (range, 3-60) months 21 patients died transplant-related including 2 with acute, 6 with overlap syndrome, 7 with classic and 6 with no cGVHD. Probability of overall survival (OS) at 4 years was signifi cantly worse for patients without cGVHD with 39% (P = 0.003) compared to 68% and 67% for patients with overlap syndrome and classic cGVHD, respectively. Conclusions: No signifi cant difference in OS between the new categories of cGVHD were observed in our prospective study. Whether other outcome variables differ between these 2 cohorts has to await further analyses.",

GVHD pathophysiology is still poorly understood and its diagnosis depends on clinical manifestations and invasive biopsies. Specifi c biomarkers for GVHD would facilitate the early and accurate recognition of this invalidating disease as well as the monitoring of patient response to adopted anti-GVHD pharmacological treatment. With the aim to explore new reliable markers for predicting and monitoring GVHD course, we focused on pentraxin-3 (PTX-3), an acute-phase protein, that has been shown to play a crucial role in orchestrating infl ammatory immune responses.",

After HSCT, 25/46 patients developed skin GVHD (18 acute GVHD and 7 chronic GVHD), while 21/46 never experienced it. PTX-3 plasma levels were monitored by ELISA assays. Concerning GVHD patients, blood samples were collected at the day of GVHD onset/ fl are, before the beginning of GVHD-specifi c drug therapy. Moreover skin biopsies from GVHD patients and HD were collected and stained to evaluate PTX-3 presence by immunohistochemistry. Patients who did not develop GVHD after HSCT showed augmented PTX-3 plasma levels (mean = 3.3 ng/ml, range = 1. 1-8.6 ng/ml) if compared to HD (mean = 1.2 ng/ml, range = 0.3-2.5 ng/ml, P < 0.01). Interestingly, we observed a strong increase of PTX-3 plasma levels in patients with acute GVHD (mean = 42.2 ng/ml, range = 6.7-218.2 ng/ml, P < 0.01) or with fl air-ups of chronic GVHD (mean = 15.8 ng/ml, range = 9-44.3 ng/ml, P < 0.05). Histological analysis of PTX-3 in skin lesions of patients with active GVHD showed that, similarly to normal skin, PTX-3 was secreted at high levels around the perivascular lymphatics. On the other hands, PTX-3 was specifi cally produced in the derma of GVHD patients. These preliminary results show that PTX-3 plasma levels increase very rapidly in patients experiencing active GVHD, candidating PTX-3 as an easily measurable soluble factor useful to corroborate clinical GVHD monitoring. Moreover, the high expression of PTX-3 in GVHD skin lesions suggests a relevant role of this protein in the disease process. Further studies are needed to clarify if PTX-3 could represent a good diagnostic and/or prognostic factor and its role in GVHD pathophysiology.",

Iacopino (1) (1)AO Bianchi Melacrino Morelli (Reggio Calabria, IT); (2) DIMET (Reggio Calabria, IT) Rationale: Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is the major complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT). Modern approaches are needed to confi rm clinical diagnosis of aGVHD to treat patients (pts) correctly as soon as possible. Aim: To evaluate if it is possible to create and use easily a \"computational model\" based on an Artifi cial Intelligence framework to analyze biological data in order to formulate the diagnosis of aGVHD. Patients: Forty-one pts were enrolled in our study from March 2007 to September 2009. All pts underwent HSCT and 12 of them (34%) developed aGVHD (II-III grade) confi rmed by biopsy. Methods: We used peripheral blood (PB) samples from aGVHD (YES) pts taken at the time of diagnosis and PB samples from pts that didn't experienced aGVHD (NO). All together YES/ NO patient groups comprised a validation set. Total RNA was extracted from whole PB and used to perform a gene expression assay (GEP). GEP were carried out with TaqMan\u00ae Low Density Array Fluidic to test occurrence of aGVHD. The macroarray project included 47 candidate genes involved in immune network and infl ammation pathogenesis. Computational Intelligence Approach. An Evolving Connectionist System has been developed integrating different methods: Multiple Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, Evolving Spiking Neural Networks and Dynamic Evolving Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems. Results: From fi rst data resulted that not all gene transcripts measured were related to aGVHD classifi cation. Some genes resulted irrelevant and some redundant from the machine learning point of view in order to select gene diagnostic targets and use them for diagnosis of aGVHD. Only a subset of 19 genes carried signifi cant information with different weight. For example, Foxp3, SLP1, CCR4 transcripts weighed 100%, STAT6, BCL2A1, CXCL1, FAS, FOS, IRF1, IL1B, STAT6 weighed 90%, CCL5, CXCL10, FAS, IL1B and others weighed 80%. These data confi rmed what we observed during GVHD diagnosis and monitoring, so that the profi le variations can be associated with both the GVHD presence and the treatment response. Finally, the results told us that it is possible to identify aGVHD using a restricted number of gene transcripts with an accuracy > 92% (0,002% error rate). Conclusion: Computational Intelligence Approach provides a strong overall accuracy to confi rm aGVHD in HSCT pts. Our study outlines the importance and utility of non-invasive tool for aGVHD diagnosis based on GEP.",

Prockop (6) (1) Background: Severe acute graft vs. host disease (GVHD) unresponsive to steroid and other immunosuppressive therapy typically leads to poor outcomes and high mortality. Case reports of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) used for the rescue of pediatric patients with severe GVHD resistant to multiple second line agents has generated interest in the therapy. In this study we evaluate the risk/benefi t profi le of MSCs (Prochy-mal\u00ae) administered under an FDA Expanded Access Program (Protocol 275) as a rescue agent for treatment resistant GVHD in pediatric patients. Methods: Children with Grade B-D aGVHD failing steroids and other agents were eligible for enrollment. Patients were given 8 biweekly infusions of 2 \u00d7 10 6 cells/kg for 4 weeks, with an additional 4 infusions weekly after day 28 in patients with a partial response, defi ned as improvement in at least one organ without progression in others. Results: 59 patients (median age of 8 years, 61% male, 55% Caucasian, 83% recipient of an unrelated graft, and 41% cord blood) were treated. At baseline, the distribution of aGVHD grades B:C:D was 6 (10%): 20 (33%): 33 (57%). The median duration of aGVHD before enrollment was 29 days, and patients failed an average of 3.2 lines of treatment for GVHD. Organ involvement was 60% skin, 87% gastrointestinal, and 38% liver. At day 28, overall response (OR), defi ned as organ improvement of at least one stage without worsening in any other, was 64%; 17% of patients had stable disease or mixed response; and 19% experienced progression. By grade, 28 day OR was 67% for B, 75% for C, and 58% for D. Response by organ was recorded, with 47% of skin, 23% of GI, and 39% of liver GVHD completely responding (stage 0) within the fi rst 28 days of treatment. Overall survival through study duration (day 100) was 62%. Achieving an OR at day 28 resulted in a significantly higher probability of survival when compared to patients who progressed within the fi rst 28 days (76% vs. 9%, P < 0.05). Prochymal was generally well tolerated and there was no evidence of ectopic tissue formation. Conclusion: Treatment with Prochymal produced a 64% response rate in patients with otherwise refractory severe GVHD patients by day 28. Response to Prochymal correlated with improved overall survival at 100 days. MSC therapy appears to have an excellent risk/benefi t profi le and should be considered in pediatric patients with GVHD non-responsive to steroids.",

Sartor, J. Lau, D. Gottlieb, K. Bradstock Westmead Hospital (Sydney, AU) Dendritic cells (DC) are central to the development of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). Because DC migration is tightly regulated by the interaction between chemokine receptors on DC and their ligands, we investigated the relationship between the severity of acute GvHD and the expression of the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CCR7 on CD11c + myeloid and S126 CD11c-plasmacytoid from the peripheral blood of 32 patients post alloHCT. Methods: Peripheral blood was collected twice weekly up to day 100 post transplant from 22 patients who received transplants from matched siblings, 10 from unrelated donors. Nineteen transplants were performed with myeloablative conditioning, 13 with reduced intensity conditioning. The expression of each chemokine receptor on CD11c + and CD11c-DC was calculated using multiparameter fl ow cytometry. The percentage of CD11c + DC expressing a given receptor was added to the percentage of CD11c-DC expressing the same receptor to give a maximum score that could vary from 0 to 200%. Eleven of 32 patients developed moderate to severe acute GvHD (grade II-IV), the remaining 21 patients developed either no GvHD or only grade I GvHD. The percentage of DC expressing either CCR5 or CCR7 was correlated with the development of acute GvHD. CCR7 expression was detected in 13 of 32 patients post-HCT with a median of 2.3% of DC positive (range 0 to 39%). CCR7 expression on DC showed no association with the severity of acute GvHD (P = 1.0). In contrast, higher CCR5 expression was detected on DC in patients developing grade II-IV GvHD (median 98.0%, SEM 9.1%) than in those with grade 0-I GvHD (median 5.2%, SEM 5.1%) P < 0.0001. All eleven patients with grade II-IV GvHD expressed CCR5 at a level of > 35% of myeloid and plasmacytoid DC. Only two of 21 patients with grade 1 GvHD expressed CCR5 at the same level (66% and 94%). Most importantly, the expression of CCR5 preceded the development of moderate to severe GvHD in all patients by a median of 19 days (range 2 to 47 days, SEM 4.3 days). Using a receiver operator curve analysis, CCR5 expression above 35% demonstrated a sensitivity of 100% and a specifi city of 90.5% for predicting grade II-IV GvHD. Expression of CCR5 on circulating DC post allo-HCT predicts for the development of moderate to severe GvHD, and detection could allow earlier therapeutic intervention prior to the development of clinical GVHD.",

Wang (1) , M. Merad (2) , M. Collin (1) (1)Newcastle University (Newcastle upon Tyne, UK); (2)Mount Sinai School of Medicine (New York, US) Recipient antigen presenting cells (APC) may play a critical role in graft versus host responses, through their activation by conditioning and direct presentation of recipient MHC class I restricted minor antigens. Their persistence may infl uence GVHD tropism and yet also be critical for graft versus leukaemia responses to leukocyte-restricted antigens. We set out to determine the nature and turnover of APC in the skin, a frequent target of GVHD and accessible peripheral tissue. In addition to epidermal Langerhans cells, we fi nd a complex array of dermal APC including CD14 + dendritic cells (DC), CD1c + DC and perivascular macrophages. In parallel with recent murine studies, we fi nd a subset of CD1a + Langerin + DC unrelated to Langerhans cells. Gene expression profi ling indicates that blood monocytes, CD14 + DC and macrophages are related cells, which express M-CSF receptors and do not proliferate. In contrast, CD11c + blood DC and dermal CD1c + cells related and show fl t-3 dependent proliferation. After transplantation, APC turnover at strikingly variable rates. CD14 + DC and CD1c + DC are rapidly replaced by donor cells, regardless of conditioning intensity or the occurrence of GVHD. Langerhans cells, which may persist indefinitely in murine transplants, are replaced by donor cells within 100 days in almost all human transplants including non-myeloablative and T depleted transplants. The rate of their turnover is more rapid with full intensity transplantation and is augmented by GVHD. The most long-lived of all human APC are dermal macrophages. Recipient macrophages are found in many patients up to one year post-transplant and are not signifi cantly depleted by prior GVHD. In situ, these cells are located in the perivascular tissue. In vitro they elaborate pro-infl ammatory cytokines and stimulate activation and cytokine release by memory CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. In GVHD lesions, recipient and recruited donor macrophages appear to interact with donor T cells and participate in GVHD pathology. These studies highlight the varied roles of recipient APC in graft versus host responses. Migratory myeloid DC and even LC are present for only short intervals post-transplantation and can only exert transient effects on donor T cell activation. Recipient macrophages survive for much longer periods and may be critical in delayed acute GVHD, chronic GVHD and DLI responses, although their inability to migrate to LN and lower potency as APC are mitigating factors.",

Socie (1) (1)Hospital Saint Louis (Paris, FR); (2) Hospital Avicenne (Paris, FR) Background: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus criteria for the diagnosis of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) emphasized clinical manifestations of GVHD rather than the classical time of onset. Incidence and impact in term of relapse and no-relapse mortality (NRM) of this new classifi cation is not well known after RIC. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 177 consecutive patients (pts) in Saint Louis' Hospital undergoing an SCT for hematologic malignancy and surviving at least day + 100 after RIC between Oct 2001 and Dec 2008. The association of occurrence of chronic GVHD with the risk of relapse and non-relapse death was analyzed using time-dependent covariates in causespecifi c proportional hazards models. Results: Among 177 pts (M/F: 109/68), with a median age of 52 years old (6-68 years) 106 pts (60%) received HLAidentical sibling transplantation. Source of stem cells was mobilized peripheral blood stem cell for 164 pts (93%), bone marrow for 6 pts (3%) and 7 cord blood (4%). After a median follow-up of 28 months (range 5-92 months), a total of 121 pts (68%) developed chronic GVHD according to the Seattle criteria and when using NIH consensus criteria, 84 pts (47%) developed chronic GVHD, including 66 pts (55%) with classic chronic GVHD and 18 pts (15%) overlap syndrome. Patients reclassifi ed included: 5 pts with late onset acute GvHD, 27 pts had recurrent and 13 had persistent acute GVHD (numbers do not to previous sentence because some of these patients latter developed chronic GvHD). The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD at 36 months was 74% (95%CI; 65.9%-80.5%) when using Seattle criteria compared to 53.7% (95%CI; 45%-61.6%) with NIH chronic GVHD criteria.Two-year Cumulative incidences of relapse and NRM using both classifi cations are summarized in Table 1 . In Cox model with GvHD as a time dependent covariate, the NRM was signifi cantly higher in patients with late onset, persistent and recurrent acute GVHD compared to no GVHD (hazard ratio (HR) 6.4, 24.5 and 11; P = 0.014, P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, respectively), whereas the NRM was statistically increased in case of chronic GVHD using Seattle criteria (HR: 22.1; P < 0.001). Conclusion: The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD \"decrease\" about 20% when using NIH consensus criteria compared to Seattle criteria in our cohort of RIC. Most of the NRM occurred beyond 100 days after SCT was due to the increased risk of NRM in patients with late onset, recurrent or persistent acute GVHD.",

Patients and methods: To determine the clinical signifi cance of Tregs in peripheral stem cell grafts, we analyzed 33 myeloablative alloPBSCT and correlated the T regs in the donor graft with the aGvHD incidence and immunological recovery (evaluated on recovery of CMV-specifi c CD8 + T lymphocytes by tetramer analysis). We used fl uorochrome-conjugated tetrameric complexes of HLA-A101, HLA-A201, HLA-B702, HLA-B801, HLA B3501 to monitor recovery of CMV-specifi c CD8 + according to the patient's HLA). Patients were transplanted with unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cells from an HLA identical related donor (n = 28) or an HLA identical unrelated donor (n = 5). Median age was 32 years (range(r) 18-58); diagnoses were acute myeloid leukaemia (n = 30), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n = 3). The median Tregs dose administered was 5 \u00d7 10 6 /Kg (r: 1-20).The patients were divided into a high Tregs group (Tregs > 5 \u00d7 10 6 / Kg, n = 13) and a low Tregs group (Tregs < 5 \u00d7 10 6 /Kg, n = 20) according to the number of Tregs in the grafts. Results: Median CMV-specifi c CD8 + T lymphocytes were signifi cantly higher in patients with high than with low Tregs in the graft at 1 (2 cells/mmc vs. 0, P < .001), 2 (6 cells/mmc vs. 1, P < .001), 3 (15 cells/mmc vs. 3, P < .001) months, respectively. During the three months after transplantation, CMV infection/disease was observed in 2/13 (15%) patients with high Tregs and in 12/20 (60%) patients with low Tregs (P = .015). Moreover, the median recovery of Tregs after transplantation was signifi cantly higher in patients with high Tthan with low Tregs in the grafts at 2 (15 cells/mmc vs. 6, P < .001) and 3 months (23 cells/mmc vs. 8, P < .001). The incidence of aGvHD (grade II-IV) in high Tregs infused group was lower in the high Tregs group than the low Tregs group (1/13 or 7% vs. 11/20 or 55%, P = .009). Conclusions: We suggest that there is a good correlation between the number of Tregs in the graft and the incidence of GvHD after myeloablative allo-PBSCT. Tregs mediate protective effects toward the aGvHD and the maintenance of an optimal microenviroment for the reconstitution of functional immunity.Our results support further consideration of Tregs immunotherapy for clinical alloSCT.",

Aguilera, A. Nu\u00f1ez, \u00c1. Urbano Ispizua, I. Espigado Tocino Hospital Universitario Virgen del Roc\u00edo (Sevilla, ES) Background: Glutathione S-transferase T1 (GSTT1) is a detoxifying hepatic enzyme involved in drug metabolic phase II path-way. It mainly appears in hepatic, renal and blood cells. Twenty percent of Caucasian population and 60% of Asiatic population present a deletion in the gene encoding the enzyme GSTT1, resulting in the absence of the enzyme, the so called \"null genotype\". We previously published that a specifi c antibody-mediated alloimmune response is triggered when a null GSTT1 recipient receives a GSTT1 positive liver or kidney graft. The potential infl uence of GSTT1 genotype on immunobiologic and toxic reactions in the liver after allo-SCT has not been studied yet. Aims: Analyzing the association of GSTT1 polymorphic variants with the incidence of hepatic acute GVHD in 73 patients undergoing allo-SCT and its effects on survival. Methods and results: We retrospectively analyzed a total of 73 HLA-identical siblings Allo-TPH recipients. All patients received myeloablative -conditioning and all donor and recipient pairs were Caucasians. Median follow-up was 75 months . GSTT1 variants were analyzed by PCR method. The distribution of patients into groups was the following: Group 1: null GSTT1 donor (donor -)/positive GSTT1 recipient (recipient + ) (n = 9); Group 2: positive GSTT1 donor/null recipient (n = 4); Group 3: positive GSTT1 donor/positive recipient (n = 51); Group 4: null GSTT1 donor/null recipient (n = 9). Hepatic GVHD and toxicity were diagnosed based on accepted international clinical criteria and on ancillary tests, including liver biopsy, when appropriate. Results of the association of GSTT1 genotypes and hepatic alteration is shown in Table 1 . The effect of GSTT1 genotypes disparities on the survival is shown in the graph below (graph 1): Conclusions: 1. Genetic mismatch in GSTT1 between donors and recipients has a strong association with acute hepatic GVHD. This could help in the differential diagnosis of hepatic alterations after allo-SCT. 2 . Null GSTT1 recipients presented a greater incidence of hepatic toxicity after allo-SCT without reaching statistical signifi cance. 3 . Genetic mismatch between donors and recipients (donor -/ recipient + ) showed a tendency to a decreased survival.",

Dem\u00e9ocq CHU (Clermont-Ferrand, FR) The clinical grading of gastro-intestinal GVHD relies on the daily volume of diarrhea. This parameter is often very hard to measure accurately, especially in small children. Plasma citrulline, a nonprotein amino acid produced by enterocytes, has been shown as a marker of remnant enterocyte mass in patients with short bowel. Our objective was to evaluate the utility of citrulline as a marker of severity of acute intestinal GVHD in children.",

For all patients, a sample of plasma was collected every week between day-7 and day 28 of BMT; in case of acute GVHD involving or not the gastro-intestinal tract, weekly collections were carried on until resolution of acute GVHD or occurrence of chronic GVHD. Acute GVHD was staged by using the Gl\u00fccksberg criteria. Results: All children had normal values of plasma citrulline before the beginning of conditioning regimen (19 \u03bcmol/l \u00b1 4). Citrullinemia decreased at a minimum level on day 0. On day 28, all children who did not develop acute GVHD had returned to the initial value (16.7 \u03bcmol/l \u00b1 3). The drop of citrullinemia was deeper in children who received myeloablative conditioning regimen as compared with non-myeloablative (3.6 \u00b1 3 vs. 8.1 \u00b1 5 \u03bcmol/l respectively, P = 0.02). Nine children developed acute GVHD, with gastro-intestinal involvement in 5 of them. Acute GVHD without GI involvement did not impact on citrullinemia. There was a strong correlation between citrullinemia and the clinical stage of GIT involvement (mean values: grade 0: 16.3 \u03bcmol/l, grade 1: 10 \u03bcmol/l, grade 2: 6.5 \u03bcmol/l, grade 3: 4.7 \u03bcmol/l, grade 4: 0 \u03bcmol/l, P < 0.001). In patients who responded to GVHD therapy, the increase of citrullinemia occurred in the first days after beginning of treatment, before achievement of clinical improvement. Conclusion: Citrullinemia is a non-invasive suitable marker of severity of acute intestinal GVHD, which can be useful to assess early and accurately the response to the treatment of GVHD. Its diagnosis value deserves to be assessed in reference to the diagnosis gold-standard (histological examination).",

Lipton (4) Background: The current study is a hypothesis generating study in order to identify potential predictive surrogate associated with the risk of acute or chronic GVHD which were potentially linked to the Th1/Th2 cytokine activation or transforming growth factor (TGF) mediated pathway. In addition, transplant outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) were also evaluated for SNPs involving multiple candidate pathways. Methods: The current study was performed to identify genetic surrogates predicting the risk of acute/chronic GVHD, relapse free survival, non-relapse mortality and overall survival in 394 pairs transplanted at the Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada. In addition, the predictive markers for organ specifi c incidence of acute/chronic GVHD were also evaluated (i.e. for skin/liver/gut acute GVHD or skin, eye, oral, lung or liver chronic GVHD Results: The risk of chronic GVHD was signifi cantly associated with SNP of the genes involved in the pathway of NFKB, PDGF, TGF-beta, and some of cytokines (esp. type II, IL6 & IL4), while that of acute GVHD associates with the genotypes in the pathway of TNF and apoptosis. In addition, survival after allogeneic transplantation was associated with the genotypes in NOS (nitric oxide synthase, endothelial nitric oxide synthesis pathway), IL-2 and TGF pathway. Conclusion: Because of complex nature of GVHD pathogenesis, multiple candidate pathway SNPs has been explored targeting SNPs in the pathway of cytokines, NFKB, apoptosis, endothelium nitric oxide regulation, NOD2/CARD15, PDGF, PTGS1/2, TGF-beta and TLR. Different involvements were noted of TGF-beta, PDGF or NFKB with chronic GVHD versus TNF and apoptosis-associated SNPs with acute GVHD.",

Park (2) (1)Chung-Ang University Hospital (Seoul, KR); (2)Seoul National University (Seoul, KR) Introduction: Chronic graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) is one of the most troublesome complications after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The pathogenesis is not clearly understood, and studies to develop standardized diagnostic guidelines are in progress. We have previously reported differentially expressed genes and pathways in chronic GVHD S129 using one-dye microarray analysis and also selected diagnostic genes predicting chronic GVHD (Bone Marrow Transplant, 41:1047 . In this study, we analyzed microarray data obtained from both one-dye and two-dye microarray experiments, to explore microarray platform-independent results and to improve the prediction accuracy and reproducibility. Patients and methods: Twenty-four patients who received allogeneic HSCT were included in this study. Eleven patients had chronic GVHD and 13 patients had no evidence of chronic GVHD. The genes of each microarray dataset were ranked by Wilcoxon rank sum statistics between the patients with or without GVHD. The classifi er genes highly ranked in both datasets were used as features to diagnose chronic GVHD. The diagnosing performance of the feature genes were evaluated with support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifying algorithm. 10-fold cross validation was applied for the estimation of the prediction accuracy. The microarray results were validated in separate 14 patients (8 patients with chronic GVHD, 6 patients without chronic GVHD) not included in the microarray experiments using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results: The following six genes were highly ranked (top 2.5%) in both datasets: calcium binding and coiled-coil domain 1, transcriptional regulating factor 1, isovaleryl coenzyme A dehydrogenase, cadherin 15, type 1, M-cadherin (myotubule), lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus E and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9. The prediction accuracy of the genes was 90% in the one-dye data and 92% in the two-dye data with the KNN. The prediction accuracy of the SVM was 87% and 90% in one-dye and two-dye data, respectively. The validation study showed that the six-gene expression model had considerable prediction accuracy (SVM: 80%, KNN: 85%). Conclusion: We identifi ed six classifi er genes that could be used to diagnose chronic GVHD with favorable prediction accuracy and reproducibility.",

Greinix, W. Bauer, Z. Kuzmina, W. Rabitsch, R. Knobler, G. Stingl, G. Stary Medical University of Vienna (Vienna, AT) Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is a serious complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) that occurs in an acute, chronic-infl ammatory and chronic-sclerotic form. Currently, it is unclear whether the same or different pathomechanisms lead to these different clinical presentations. To address this issue, we analyzed interleukins, chemokines and other relevant molecules in skin biopsies of acute (n = 12) and chronic-infl ammatory (n = 9) GvHD by quantitative RT-PCR and evaluated, by immunohistochemistry, serial biopsies of non-lesional skin at different time points prior and after HCT (n = 14). Results obtained revealed striking differences between acute and chronic GvHD lesions. In acute GvHD skin biopsies we found increased levels of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 (P < 0.01), and IL-13 (P < 0.05) together with IL-22 (P < 0.001) compared with biopsies from chronic-infl ammatory GvHD patients. In addition we observed an upregulation of the Th2 chemokines CCL17 (P < 0.001) and CCL22 (P < 0.01) and a downregulation of the Th1 chemokines CXCL9 (P < 0.001) and CXCL10 (P < 0.001) in acute GvHD skin lesions as compared to the chronic infl ammatory GvHD. Around day + 20 after HCT expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), an inducer of Th2 differentiation of na\u00efve CD4 + T cells, in the epidermis was signifi cantly higher in patients later developing acute GvHD compared to ones without later acute GvHD (P < 0.01). Our data suggest that specifi c mechanisms are operative in acute and chronic forms of skin GvHD. Identifi cation of acute GvHD as Th2-mediated disease could provide the basis for the development of novel and more specifi c dignostic tools by the establishment of an unique marker profi le for acute skin GvHD, allowing differentiation from drug or viral rashes.",

Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is an underrecognized manifestation of chronic GvHD and is associated with a very poor outcome. Extracorporal photopheresis (ECP) has shown some activity in the treatment of chronic GvHD as well as in BOS. 11 patients (pts) diagnosed with BOS according to the National Institute of Health (NIH) Consensus Criteria for diagnosis of BOS after allogeneic stem cell transplantation were analyzed for improvement of pulmonary function, clinical symptoms and outcome. 2 patients received hematopoetic stem cells from an HLA-identical sibling, 4 patients from an unrelated HLA-identical donor, 3 patients from a mismatched sibling and 2 patients from an unrelated mismatched donor. Progressive chronic GvHD was seen in 2 pts, quiescent in 6 pts and de novo in 3 pts. All patients (median age of 39 years) were refractory to corticosteroids, including inhalative application forms. They received ECP for a minimum of 2 months. The median number of treatments was 35 (range 7-110). The manifestation of BOS was detected in median 281 days after transplantation. Additional treatment of BOS consisted of rapamycin in all pts. Further immunosuppressive agents were used in 3 pts. FEV1 and FEV1/FVC as parameters of pulmonary function were monitored continuously during treatment. Before the start of ECP FEV1/FVC was less than 50% in 5 pts and less than 60% in 6 pts. 2 patients showed a FEV1 of less than 35% predicted, 4 between 36% and 50% and 5 between 51% and 70%. Improvement of lung function was defi ned as 10% increase of FEV1. This was observed in 5 of 11 pts (45,5%). Response was better in patients with FEV1 more than 50% at diagnosis. Clinical symptoms such as dyspnea and dry cough improved in 8 of 11 pts (72,7%). Overall survival (OS) after a follow up between 216 and 1559 days was 63,6% and median OS was 1168 days. Cause of death was progressive BOS in 2 patients, relapse of leukemia in one and cardiac failure in one. ECP in combination with rapamycin proved a valuable therapeutic option for the treatment of steroid refractory BOS. Clinical symptoms and lung function could be improved in more than 70% and 45% of the patients respectively.",

            "text": "Introduction: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) represents a potential curative option for many hematological malignancies. Its ability to induce a graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect can lead to eradication of disease; however, graftversus-host disease (GvHD) invariably occurs when a GVT is present and its morbidity is responsible for both early and late deaths in complete remission. Chronic GvHD (cGvHD) has been shown to be associated with reduced risk of relapse due to the GVT effect. Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the role of cGvHD on alternative donor HSCT outcome. Methods: HSCTs performed from January 1999 to March 2009 were retrospectively analyzed from GITMO registry; patients were > 18 years old and affected by a hematological malignancy. Association between cGvHD and HSCT outcome was evaluated through Cox regression; cGvHD was analyzed as a time-dependent variable. Multivariate models for survival and relapse were obtained after including main patients' and transplants' characteristics in the analysis. Results: A total of 1536 HSCTs were obtained. Median age at HSCT was 43 (18-69), median follow-up was 393 days (0-3355). 1073 patients were evaluable for cGvHD since they survived more than 100 days after HSCT: of these, 203 and 121 developed a limited and extensive cGvHD respectively so far, and 749 developed no cGvHD. Median time from HSCT to cGvHD was 211 days (100-3004). 302 of 749 (40%) patients who did not develop any cGvHD died; deaths of patients with limited and extensive cGvHD were 27% and 39% respectively (P = 0.02 for limited vs. extensive, P = 0.01 for limited vs. no cGvHD, chi-square test). Multivariate analysis confi rmed the survival advantage of patients with limited cGvHD (HR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.33-0.71; P < 0.0001) while no signifi cant differences exist between patients without cGvHD and those with extensive form (P = 0.52). Other signifi cant variables were CMV status and disease phase at HSCT (see Table) . Multivariate model for relapse is shown in the Table above. Conclusion: This large analysis confi rms that occurrence of cGvHD is associated to reduced risk of relapse after HSCT for a hematological malignancy, compared to absence of cGvHD; limited cGvHD was associated to better survival while extensive form did not result in better survival probably due to severe infections or other fatal complications responsible of deaths in complete remission.",

Cannas, F. Nicolini, X. Thomas, V. Dubois, F. Braye, M. Michallet H\u00f4pital Edouard Herriot (Lyon, FR) Objective: We describe the successful treatment of a severe extensive cutaneous form of cGvHD with the transplantation of skin obtained from the same stem cell donor. A 34-year old woman received in May 2008 a myeloablative HSCT for AML in CR2, from HLA-identical sister. In August 2009 an extensive form of cGvHD was characterized by large multiple skin ulcerations with even some visible necrotic areas. Recent pneumocystosis and concomitant multi-resistant Pseudomonas A. cutaneous infection prevented the use of immunosuppressive drugs. A surgical approach was thus decided, consisting in skin transplantation from the same HSC donor. Methods: After informed consent, a graft of epidermal layer was obtained from patient's HLA-identical sister, with a 8-cm incision in the inguinal area. Epidermal cells were cultured in vitro and expanded in about 3 weeks to obtain large sheets of epidermal layer. Multiple appositions of this in vitro expanded skin were performed under general anaesthesia between September and November 2009; a concomitant immunomodulatory treatment with methotrexate 15 mg/week and extracorporeal photopheresis was administered, together with a continuous enteral nutrition, intensive antimicrobial therapy and pain management. Results: Lesions disappeared, since the wide skin surface obtained with in vitro expansion enabled to cover all injured sites. A process of cicatrisation is now visible between the patient's and donor's skin in the areas previously characterized by ulcerations. Patient's quality of life dramatically improved, together with nutritional status. Analysis performed on blood and bone marrow showed sustained full donor chimerism. Conclusion: At our knowledge this is the fi rst described case of successful skin transplantation in a patient with cGvHD, obtained from in vitro expansion of the same HSC donor's skin. This experience showed that this procedure was feasible and well-tolerated. The rationale of using skin from the same HSC donor relies on the lack of expected immunological aggression from the immune system responsible of GvHD to the transplanted skin, both coming from the same donor. So far, the hypothesis was confi rmed, in fact skin ulcerations disappeared and we did not need to add any immunosuppressive therapy. However, further follow-up is necessary to evaluate the evolution and long-term tolerability of this multidisciplinary treatment of severe extensive cutaneous cGvHD, still associated to high rate of mortality.",

Jansen-Hoogendijk, R.M. Egeler, A.C. Lankester, M.J.D. van Tol Leiden University Medical Centre (Leiden, NL) ATG, a polyclonal rabbit antiserum, is frequently used for in vivo T-cell depletion prior to HSCT to prevent graft rejection and acute Graft-versus-Host disease (aGvHD). In kidney transplant patients, human antibodies directed against ATG are reported to reduce the effi cacy of anti-rejection therapy by accelerating the ATG clearance. Pharmacokinetics of total (rabbit immunoglobulins) and active ATG (capable to bind to a T cell line) in adult and pediatric allogeneic HSCT recipients shows a high inter-patient variability (see Figure) . The concentration of ATG has been reported to affect the incidence and severity of aGVHD. Only one study has described the presence of anti-ATG antibodies in HSCT patients, without pointing to the infl uence on ATG levels or the clinical impact. In this study, concentrations of total and active ATG and anti-ATG antibodies were frequently measured in pre-and post-HSCT sera obtained from 109 pediatric patients. The children usually received a total ATG (Thymoglobulin) dose of 10 mg/kg divided over 4 days just prior to HSCT. In most patients the clearance of total ATG was slow and ATG was detectable until months post-SCT, whereas active ATG was cleared much faster. However, in 11 patients total ATG decreased very fast (>log 2 decline in 3 days, see Figure) . This rapid clearance was associated with a simultaneous appearance of IgG anti-ATG antibodies. Five patients with IgG anti-ATG antibodies in the fi rst 4 weeks after HSCT showed serious side-effects, i.e. serum-sickness, aGvHD symptoms or VOD, contrasting patients who mounted an antibody response later post-HSCT. The majority of patients with anti-ATG simultaneously produced IgG, IgM and IgA anti-ATG antibodies. In all cases, IgG anti-ATG was of low avidity. Donor origin of IgG1 anti-ATG was demonstrated, using IgG1 allotype-specifi c monoclonal antibodies in all but one patient.",

Koreth, K. Stevenson, H. Kim, S. McDonough, V. Ho, E. Alyea, C. Cutler, P. Armand, J. Antin, J. Ritz, R. Soiffer Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, US) Regulatory T cells (Treg) are low in active chronic graftversus-host-disease (cGVHD). Treg infusion has been proposed as a GVHD therapy. However, ex-vivo Treg expansion is cumbersome and limited by methodologic and regulatory constraints. Daily low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) has been demonstrated to expand Treg in cancer patients and early after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We are testing if low-dose IL-2 can expand Treg in-vivo in steroid-refractory cGVHD. We administered daily subcutaneous IL-2 (Novartis) for 8 weeks of a 12-week phase-I doseescalation study: (level A) 0.3 \u00d7 10 6 IU/m 2 , (B) 1 \u00d7 10 6 IU/m 2 , and (C) 3 \u00d7 10 6 IU/m 2 . 14 patients accrued: 7, 4, 3 at dose-levels A, B, C. Median age was 50.5 (27-65) years. Median time from HSCT and cGVHD onset was 995 (42-2766) and 802.5 (117-2624) days. Active cGVHD sites were skin (14), mouth (7), eyes (5) , liver (4), lung (3), esophagus (1). Patients received a median of 3 (1-3) concurrent agents: steroids (14), sirolimus (8), MMF (7), tacrolimus (6). Prior cGVHD therapies included rituximab (7), ECP (4), MMF (3), sirolimus (2), tacrolimus (2), alemtuzumab (2), cyclosporine (1), denileukin-diftitox (1), thalidomide (1). At dose-levels A and B there was no cGVHD progression and 2 infectious complications (Hemophilus B bacteremia with HUS; MRSA pneumonia). Dose-level B has been declared MTD, as dose-level C induced intolerable constitutional symptoms and 1 case of cGVHD progression. Of 11 evaluable patients, 6 had a partial response, 1 a mixed response, 3 stable disease and 1 progressive cGVHD. Responses were noted in skin and liver. At study-end, 5 of 6 responders continue on extended duration IL-2 (range, 1-16 months) given their clinical benefi t. The 6th, with resolving liver cGVHD, had IL-2 withheld for MRSA pneumonia. He died of progressive liver cGVHD off IL-2. 1 responder on extended duration IL-2 had a nonfatal myocardial infarction, unrelated to IL-2. Daily IL-2 induced a statistically significant 3-5 fold rise in peripheral CD4 + CD25 + CD127-Treg, but did not impact circulating NK, NK-T, CD8 or conventional CD4 + T-cells (Tcon). There was a significant increase in Treg:Tcon ratio, which fell towards baseline after IL-2 was discontinued (Table) . Daily low-dose IL-2 is feasible, safe, and has effi cacy in refractory cGVHD; with marked preferential Treg expansion in-vivo despite concurrent steroid and tacrolimus use. Further accrual at IL-2 dose-level B is underway.",

Yang (1) (1)Chonnam National University Medical School (Jeollanam-do, KR) ; KR) Backgroud: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MDR1 gene that are responsible for drug effux can cause toxicities and the other report suggested that calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) such as tacrolimus and cyclosporine bioavailability was related to ABCB1 genotypes. Since the major immunosuppressant used in hepatopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is the CNI, these might infl uence the graft versus host diseases and clinical outcome in HCT. Patients and methods: To assess the association between ABCB1 SNP and clinical implication, PCR-RFLP method was used to determine the genotype of the C1236T, G2677T/A and C3435T in 78 recipients of allgeneic HCT from a HLA identical sibling (n = 59, 75.6%) and unrelated donor (n = 19, 24.4%). Patients have either AML (n = 55, 70.5%), CML (n = 12, 15.4%) and lymphoma (n = 11, 14.1%). The genetic variants in ABCB1 on survival were analyzed by Log rank tests and multivariant analysis by Cox regression. Results: The overall survival the HCT patients was signifi cantly correlated to the C1236T for the CC or CT vs. TT, multivariate analysis showed that CC and CT were the independent factor for mortality (P = 0.038, HR: 2.51 (95% CI: 1.05-5.98 )). The 5-year survival of C1236T genotype in CC or CT was 35% and TT was 67.8%. Chronic Graft versus host disease (GVHD) of liver was associated with C3435T in CC (39.4%), CT(13.8%) and TT (66.7%) (P = 0.006), and in CC or CT vs. variants (P = 0.02) but, G2677T/A and C3435T SNPs did not correlated to survival. Conclusions: Our fi ndings suggest that ABCB1 SNPs affect the survival and chronic GVHD after allogeneic HCT and the correlation between ABCB1 genotype and the overall survival HCT patients might provide useful information for risk stratifi cation of HCT.",

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have been used as treatment with reported variable success rates. Most published reports rely on clinical improvement as an evaluation end point to document response. We report experience in children treated mainly with 3rd party MSC for severe gastrointestinal (GI) steroid refractory GVHD, who have been systematically followed pre and post MSC, inclusive of standard clinical grading as well as endoscopic and histological monitoring. In the LUMC pediatric stem cell transplant unit from 2005 to 2009, 20 children (11 boys; 9 girls) between 11 m-17 y 8 m (median age 6 y) were treated with MSCs for steroid refractory GVHD, according to an ethically committee approved protocol. Of these, 80% had GI involvement according to above criteria. These patients' details are summarized in Table I . They received haplo (n = 2) or 3rd party derived MSC, with all but 1 receiving 2 infusions, at variable times from GvHD onset. Seven children had either no response (n = 5) or partial resolution (n = 2) to MSCs, defined as persistent symptoms and no or minimal endoscopic/histological changes respectively. TRM due to infection and/or progressive GvHD was 85%. Of the remainder, 8/9 children had persistent diarrhea and increased frequency of stools up to and beyond 30 days of MSCs implying continued GvHD. However, direct visual endoscopy showed widespread mucosal improvement. However, notable villous atrophy (and in some cases patchy fi brosis) was seen, which was considered the cause of clinical malabsorption. In all cases, despite persistent clinical symptoms, histological biopsies at multiple sites of the gastrointestinal tract showed no evident acute GvHD. The procedure was performed safely by experienced pediatric gastroenterologists and subsequently introduced as evaluation post MSC in our unit. TRM in this cohort was 20% (mainly due to lethal infections). Such serial endoscopic features directly correlated to histological fi ndings have not been previously reported in children responding to MSC treatment. We demonstrate the lack of correlation with clinical grading namely volume and frequency of diarrhea. These fi ndings have implications not only for clinical management but also for the design of future clinical trials and evaluation of MSCs therapies in patients with gastrointestinal GvHD.",

            "text": "Acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGvHD) remains a potentially lethal complication after allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Clearly, new strategies are needed to tailor donor selection and conditioning regimen, according to the individual patient's risk-profi le. Recently, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in genes of the innate and adaptive immune-system were found to be predictive in this regard. Unfortunately, the results are either heterogeneous as in the case of NOD2 or preliminary as with the IL23R(1142A>G)-SNP. We therefore sought to determine the effect of these two SNPs and the BPI(A645G)-SNP on posttransplant-outcome in a cohort of 304 allo-SCT patients and their respective related or unrelated donors. Genotyping was done using real-time PCR assays on a Lightcycler 480. Patients carrying at least one variant allele of NOD2-SNP 8, 12 or 13 were referred to as NOD2-SNP. Similarly, patients carrying one G-allele at position 1142 of the IL23Rgene were denominated IL23R-SNP. Finally, one G-allele at position 645 of the BPI gene was suffi cient for classifi cation as BPI-SNP. The incidence of GvHD was analyzed using competing events statistics and in a multivariate ordinal regression model. No difference in cumulative incidence (CI) of aGvHD was found with respect to NOD2 patient-or donor-genotype and recipient BPI genotype. However, patients receiving a BPI-G graft had a significantly reduced CI of aGvHD (day 100: BPI-G 15.4%, 95% CI: 10.8-20.0% vs. BPI-A 26.1%, 95%-CI: 15.6-36.6%, P = 0.047). There was also a trend to less aGvHD in those patients transplanted from IL23R-SNP-donors (100 day CI of aGvHD \u00b02-4: SNP 21.4%, 95% CI: 7.1-35.8% vs. wildtype 39.9%, 95% CI: 34.0-45.7%; P = 0.063, Figure 1 ). Multivariate analysis identified IL23R-SNP in the donor (HR 0.40, P = 0.044), in vivo T-cell-depletion (HR 0.35, P = 0.001) and the use of a multiagent immunosuppressive GvHD prohylaxis (HR 0.53, P = 0.045) as independent factors predicting for less severe aGvHD. A trend towards less aGvHD was observed in patients receiving a BPI-G transplant (HR 0.59) and those with a matched related donor (HR 0.64). We conclude that at least in our cohort NOD2-SNPs might not be as important as recently suggested. Furthermore, we think that IL23R(1142A>G) and BPI(A645G)-SNP of the donor represent attractive targets for improving donor selection and should therefore be studied in larger prospective multi-center trials.",

Messina University of Padua (Padua, IT) Background: Both host and graft regulatory T cells (Treg) may provide protection from graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in the mouse system. Findings from a murine model of syngeneic GVHD suggest that host Treg preferentially survive a lethal dose of irradiation and confer protection from disease. In humans, various combinations of genotoxic agents are actually used for myeloablative conditioning. The sensitivity of human Treg to DNA damage induced apoptosis has so far not been investigated. Objective:To evaluate the resistance of Treg to apoptosis induced by genotoxic agents compared to effector T cells (Teff) in vitro. Materials and methods: PBMC of healthy donors were exposed to either ionizing irradiation or etoposide. After incubation, samples were labelled with annexin V FITC or anti-activated caspase 3 FITC combined with monoclonal antibody conjugates to CD4, CD25 and CD127 or to surface antigen CD4 and transcription factor FoxP3. Propidium iodide or fi xable infrared viability dye were included in the staining protocol as dead cell markers. The frequency of apoptotic cells among Treg and effector CD4 + T lymphocytes was determined by fl ow cytometric analysis at different time points (up to 72h). CD45RA staining was used to analyse the role of differentiation for resistance to apoptosis. Expression of anti-apoptotic proteins bcl-2 and Bcl-xL by Treg and Teff was compared. Results: Both activation of caspase 3 and exposure of phosphatidylserine following DNA damage in vitro was observed with signifi cantly higher frequency in Treg compared to effector CD4 lymphocytes. This effect was observed in both etoposide treated cultures and those exposed to ionizing irradiation. Similar results were obtained by identifying Treg as CD25highCD127-or as FoxP3 + events. The resistance to DNA damage by Treg could not be explained by their differentiation to a CD45RA negative memory phenotype. When measured as mean fl uorescence intensity, anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and bcl-xL were not more expressed by Treg compared to Teff. Conclusion: Our observations suggest a higher resistance to DNA damage of regulatory T cells compared to effector T cells in vitro. The higher resistance cannot be explained by differentiation to a memory phenotype or differential expression of anti-apopotic proteins bcl-2 and bcl-xL. The higher resistance to genotoxic agents of Treg could affect the relative size ratio of Treg to effector T cells following conditioning.",

Immunological parameters CD3 + , CD3 + HLA DR + , CD4 + , CD19 + , CD3 + CD56 + , CD4 + CD25 + , CD4 + CD62L + were studied in children before and on 30-40 days after MSCs infusion. Results: After infusion of MSCs reduction of GVHD grade was in 14 (93,4%) patients. Five patients were in complete remission of GVHD, 9 children were in partial remission, 1 child did not response. In all patients we observed the signifi cant reduction of CD3 + HLA DR + and increasing the level of CD4 + CD25 + , CD4 + CD62 + after treatment of MSCs (P < 0,05) . In group I level of CD3 + HLA DR + was signifi cantly lower and CD4 + CD62L + was signifi cantly higher than before MSCs treatment (P < 0,05) . In group II CD3 + HLA DR + and CD3 + CD56 + were reduced and the level of CD4 + CD25 + and CD4 + CD62L + were increased after MSCs infusion (P < 0,05) . Conclusion: We demonstrated that infusion of MSCs modulate immunity and reduce grade of GVHD severity in patients with steroid-resistant GVHD. MSCs derived from bone marrow of third-party HLA-mismatched donors have more evident immunomodulatory potential then MSCs from HLA-identical donors and may be usefully for treatment GVHD in children in case of the absence of HLA-identical donor for mesenchymal stem cells.",

            "text": "B-cell depletion as therapy for steroid refractory chronic GvHD is most effective for sclerosis of the skin S. van Dorp, L. te Boome, H. Lokhorst, E. Petersen, M. Minnema, L. Span, S. Ebeling, M. van Dijk, E. Meijer, J. Kuball UMC Utrecht (Utrecht, NL) Introduction: Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is the major long term complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation and shares similarities with auto-immune diseases, like systemic sclerosis (SSc). Two observations suggest that B cells contribute to cGVHD. In the fi rst place, autoantibodies can be detected in 15-90% of cGVHD patients. Secondly, several small-scale clinical studies have demonstrated that in vivo depletion of B cells with the CD20-specifi c Ab rituximab (Rtx) resulted in amelioration of cGVHD symptoms in steroidrefractory patients. Therefore we prospectively investigated the effi cacy of Rtx on different GVHD-related symptoms in patients with steroid-refractory extensive cGVHD. Methods: In an ongoing prospective phase I/II study 15 patients with steroid-refractory cGvHD were treated with Rtx (375 mg/m 2 per week for 4 consecutive weeks). Clinical responses were monitored monthly for 1 year according to the NIH criteria (EudraCT 2008-004125-42). Results: A total of 60 Rtx infusions were administered to 15 patients. Toxicity was limited to one infectious event and one allergic reaction. Clinical responses were so far analyzed in 12 patients. Median follow-up was 6.5 months (range 1-13). Eight patients showed a partial response (PR) (67%) of which 5 patients (42%) had an ongoing response up to 1 year of follow-up and 3 patients (25%) relapsed. Two relapsed patients were retreated with Rtx 8 months after cessation of the initial Rtx treatment and showed again a PR. In patients with deep sclerosis (n = 10), sclerotic features disappeared completely or partially in 8 patients (80%). In patients with involvement of eyes (n = 10), mucosa (n = 4) and gastro-intestinal tract (n = 4) response was reached in resp. 50%, 25% and 25% of patients. Consequently, prednisone dosage could be reduced in 7 patients (58%). In 4 patients (33%) prednisone treatment was stopped completely. Conclusion: Rtx treatment is a feasible and effective treatment in patients with steroid refractory cGVHD. In addition, patients with relapsing symptoms of cGVHD can again be treated successfully. Most pronounced responses were seen in sclerotic lesions of the skin. Eye, mucosal and gastro-intestinal tract involvement was less susceptible to treatment. The lack of improvement of eye and mucosal involvement may be explained by an irreversible destruction of lacrimal and salivary glands after long standing cGVHD. This argues for an upfront application of Rtx in patients with cGVHD.",

Liga, M. Karakantza, E. Triantafyllou, N. Zoumbos University Hospital Patras (Patras, GR) Despite standard CyA/MTX prophylaxis, severe acute GvHD occurs after ~35% of matched sibling HCT. MTX is associated with mucositis, delayed engraftment and pulmonary toxicity. Campath anti-CD52 antibody may reduce GvHD by targeting lymphocytes and dendritic cells. Studies with high doses (100 mg) of the humanized Campath1H (alemtuzumab) revealed increased incidence of relapse and severe viral infections. We report our single centre experience of low dose (20-10 mg) alemtuzumab as GvHD prophylaxis in 31 consecutive matched sibling (n = 15), related (1) or unrelated transplantations (15) performed during 1/2007-10/2009. Median pt age was 36 y (17-59). Diagnoses were AML(18), ALL(10), MDS-RAEB (2), T-NHL (1), PNH (1). 24 pts were transplanted in CR1 and 7 with advanced disease. Conditioning was BuCy = 12, TBI/VP16/ Cy = 6, Flu/BCNU/Melphalan (FB/M) or FB + Thiotepa = 11, HDARA-C + FB/M = 2. All pts received peripheral blood stem cells. The fi rst 11 pts received iv alemtuzumab 20 mg absolute (10 mg on d-2 and d-1), the next 5 pts total 15 mg and the last 15pts total 10mg alemtuzumab (5 mg on d-2 and d-1). Campath serum levels were measured and alemtuzumab kinetic up to d + 30 will be presented in the meeting. All pts engrafted promptly (WBC > 1000/\u03bcl on d + 14 (9-19), PLT>50000/\u03bcl on d + 12 (7-19)). 2 pts who discontinued Cya on d + 25 (incompliance) and d + 30 (refractory disease) experienced steroid/ATG resistant, fatal GvHD. From the remaining pts, none revealed gut or liver aGvHD, whereas 12 pts (38%) experienced steroidsensible skin GvHD St I-II at a median d + 17 (12-57). 20pts revealed CMV reactivation but no CMV disease occurred. Cya could be discontinued in all evaluable pts at median on d + 120 (25-210). After discontinuation of Cya, 1 HbsAg + patient experienced fatal acute type Gr IV liver GvHD on d + 150 after HCT from her HbsAg + sibling donor and 1 Gr III gut GvHD. 40% pts revealed mild skin chronic GvHD, 2 moderate skin cGvHD which resolved with steroids and 1 extensive skin and liver GvHD. After a median follow up of 370 days (24-902), 21/31 pts are alive (67.7%) and in CR and 10 died (relapse n = 6, TRM n = 4). From the 6 pts who died due to relapse, 4/6 were at advanced stage (> CR-1) at transplant, 5/6 underwent sibling HCT and 5/6 received the higher (20 mg) Campath dose. In conclusion, in vivo low dose Campath confers an effi cient GvHD prophylaxis. Campath 10mg seems to be the optimal schedule for effi cient GvHD prophylaxis without compromising relapse in sibling and matched unrelated HCT.",

Lee, Y.A. Kang, M.J. Jeon, M. Seol, K.H. Lee Asan Medical Center, Ulsan University (Seoul, KR) Objectives: Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) usually occurs with neutrophil engraftment following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), but it can also be observed before engraftment. The pre-engraftment GVHD (pre-GVHD), often called hyperacute GVHD, was associated with a higher non-relapse mortality (NRM) rate in previous studies. In this retrospective study, we investigated the outcomes of pre-GVHD regarding leukemia relapse as well as NRM in patients undergoing allogeneic HCT for acute leukemia in a single institute. Methods: This study included a total of 384 patients who received allogeneic HCT from matched siblings or unrelated volunteers between March 1995 and July 2009 for the treat-ment of acute leukemia. The median age of the patients, 198 males and 186 females, was 36 years (range, 15-63). The phenotype of acute leukemia was myeloid (AML) in 262 and lymphoid (ALL) in 122. The disease status at HCT was the fi rst complete remission (CR1) in 290 (75.5%). Hematopoietic cell donor was a matched sibling in 243 and an unrelated volunteer in 141. Pre-GVHD was defi ned as acute GVHD occurring before neutrophil engraftment following HCT. Results: Acute GVHD occurred in 100 (26.3%) of 380 patients excluding 4 non-evaluable patients; pre-GVHD in 22 (5.8%) and post-engraftment GVHD (post-GVHD) in 78 (20.5%). Pre-HCT characteristics were not signifi cantly different between pre-GVHD and post-GVHD. Severity of acute GVHD was higher in pre-GVHD than in post-GVHD; the proportion of grade I, grade II, and grade III-IV was 9.1%, 54.5%, and 36.4% in pre-GVHD while 48.1%, 23.4%, and 28.6% in post-GVHD (P = 0.002). During a median follow-up period of 48.4 months (range, 1.1-153.2) , 170 patients died and 134 relapsed. The 5-year probabilities of overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and NRM were 52.0%, 56.7%, and 19.4%, respectively. When we compared the outcomes following HCT in non-GVHD, pre-GVHD, and post-GVHD, 5-year OS was 53.2%, 37.8%, and 54.6%, respectively (P = 0.056); 5-year RFS was 53.6%, 46.4%, and 71.7% (P = 0.040); and 5-year NRM was 12.8%, 29.4%, and 33.3% (P = 0.001). Conclusion: Pre-GVHD comprised 22% of acute GVHD. NRM was higher both in pre-GVHD and post-GVHD compared to non-GVHD, but RFS was higher only in post-GVHD compared to non-GVHD or pre-GVHD. Pre-GVHD was associated with higher NRM without increased graft-versusleukemia effects.",

Lange (3) The present study aimed to fi nd out whether typing for nonclassical HLA alleles in addition to standard donor-recipient matching may facilitate the outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). One-hundred patients (F/M = 45/55; diagnosed mainly with hematological malignancies (n = 87), 10 with inborn errors and 3 with anemia; receiving myeloablative (n = 41) or reduced intensity conditioning (n = 59) regimen, transplanted with PBPC (n = 87) or BM (n = 13), and grafted from sibling (n = 45) or unrelated (n = 55) donors) were investigated. There were 39 unrelated donor-recipient pairs matched at 5 classical HLA loci A, B, C, DR, DQ (10/10; high resolution DNA typing), while 1, 4 and 11 pairs were mismatched for 3, 2 or 1 HLA specifi city, respectively. All patients and donors were typed for the presence of two HLA-E alleles (*0101, *0103) coding expressed HLA-E molecules and HLA-G ins/del polymorphism. The incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) (grade II-IV) was signifi cantly higher in patients transplanted from matched unrelated donors as compared to sibling transplant recipients (30/52 vs. 9/43, P < 0.005) while chronic GvHD was more frequently observed in patients with previous incidence of acute GvHD as compared to those who developed chronic disease de novo (20/34 vs. 12/49, P = 0.002). The incidence of acute GvHD (grade II-IV) was higher after HLA-E mismatched transplants (8/12 vs. 19/55, P = 0.040). The latter association was analysed in patients matched for 5 classical HLA loci (HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1) at the high resolution level.",

Cytokine polymorphisms can affect occurrence and severity of transplant related complications. We studied 189 D/R HSCT pairs including patients with malignant hematological diseases transplanted with an unrelated donor, using a myeloablative or non myeloablative-conditioning regimen. All donors and recipients were typed at allelic level for HLA-A, -B, Cw, -DRB1, -DQB1 and -DPB1. We studied polymorphisms of 13 SNPs from 6 different cytokines (IL10, TNFa, IL1, IL2, IL4 and TGFb) using Taqman-based genotyping assays. We used logistic regression to evaluate the association of cytokine polymorphisms with grades III-IV acute GVHD incidence and Cox regression to compare the hazards of relapse and mortality. We found a statistically signifi cant association between acute GVHD incidence and IL10 (-1082) polymorphism. Patients whose donors carried a GG genotype increase risk of severe acute GVHD compared with donors carrying AG or AA genotypes (P value 0.05). There was also a suggestion of association between mortality risk and IL1B (-511 polymorphism): reduced risk of mortality was observed in recipients carried GA at IL1B promoter position -511 than whose carried GG (P = 0.022) but this was not confi rmed when allele A is present with homozygous status (P = 0.58). In other hand, patients whose donors carried a GA polymorphism at position -511 of IL1B receptor have an increased risk of mortality but this was not confi rmed with AA genotype (P = 0.05 and P = 0.35 respectively). Similarly, we found an increased risk of mortality for patients whose donors had TC genotype for TGFB1 (position -509) not confi rmed with TT genotype ( = 0.03 and P = 0.35 respectively). We also confi rmed previously reported negative associations between acute GVHD and IL1B-511, IL1A-889, IL4-590, IL4R Q576R, IL10-819, TGFB1-509 and TNF-238. Our results confi rmed that IL10 gene polymorphism could be associated with acute GVHD. But as reported results remains variable, we need to increase our study to evaluate more precisely the impact of such cytokines.",

Taylor Rotherham General Hospital (Rotherham, UK) Introduction: Extracorporeal Photopheresis (ECP) has been successful in the treatment of steroid-refractory chronic Graftversus-host-disease (cGVHD). The role of B-lymphocytes in the pathology of cGVHD has received interest due to observations of allo-and auto-antibody formation, perturbed B cell homeostasis and increased circulating B cell activating factor (BAFF) levels. Serum BAFF levels have been correlated with cGVHD severity and activity. To expand investigations into the role of ECP therapy in infl uencing B cell behaviour in cGVHD we examined serum BAFF in patients undergoing ECP for steroid-refractory cGVHD. Methods: 14 patients with steroid-refractory cGVHD were treated by ECP for a minimum of 3 months. Treatment outcome was measured by change in skin score or organ-specifi c improvement and change in steroid dose over the treatment period. Serum/plasma was collected at ECP start, 4 weeks & 3 months. BAFF levels were tested by ELISA (R&D systems) and compared to healthy controls (n = 30). Results: Patients with chronic GVHD had signifi cantly higher levels of serum/plasma BAFF than healthy controls prior to ECP therapy (mean 3.12 vs. 0.58 ng/ml) (P \u2264 0.0001). The interval between HSCT and ECP start had a moderate effect on BAFF level (> 17 months mean BAFF = 2.0 ng/ml vs. mean BAFF = 4.25 ng/ml for patients < 17 months, P = 0.06). Steroid dose had a signifi cant affect on Pre-ECP BAFF level (less than or equal to 20 mg/day, mean BAFF = 5.08 ng/ml vs. mean BAFF = 1.57 ng/ml for patients receiving over 20 mg/day, P = 0.02). Pre-ECP BAFF level was not signifi cantly correlated with severity of skin disease (n = 10). ECP therapy did not generate a consistent affect on BAFF levels with no signifi cant difference in serum/ plasma BAFF levels following either 1 or 3 months of treatment. BAFF levels in 6/7 patients achieving a \u2265 50% steroid reduction experienced a rise in serum/plasma BAFF (P \u2265 0.05, ns) whilst patients with a maintained steroid dose displayed a slight fall in circulating BAFF (ns). Discussion: BAFF may be a driver of alloimmune and autoimmune pathology in cGVHD. The infl uence of ECP on B cell subset maturity in cGVHD has been reported. Our data does not support a direct application of serum/plasma BAFF measurement to assess cGVHD response to ECP. Pre-ECP factors may have had a confounding infl uence, masking any correlation between clinical response and BAFF levels. A longer period of ECP therapy with stable steroid doses may reveal more signifi cant associations.",

Rituximab has been shown to induce clinical response in a proportion of patients with refractory cGVHD. We report the results of a multicentric retrospective survey of patients treated with rituximab in Spain. Material and methods: We retrospectively analyzed 31 patients (median age 37 y, range 13-65). All had received an allogeneic stem cell transplant, 23 from HLA-identical sibling and 8 from alternative donors. A reduced intensity transplant was performed in 14 cases. Median time from transplantation to diagnosis of cGVHD was 7 months. All cases were refractory to several treatment lines, median 2 (range 1-5). Twenty three patients had cutaneous involvement (NIH grade 1:22%; grade 2:35% and grade 3:43%). Other sites of organ involvement frequently were mouth, eyes and liver. Ten patients had cytopenias of probable immune origin. Rituximab was given IV at a weekly dose of 375 mg/m\u00b2, with 94% of the patients receiving 4 doses. Results: Results could be evaluated in 30 patients (1 patient died suddenly after completing 4 doses). Treatment was well tolerated in all cases. The overall response rate was 80%, 10% with complete response (CR) and 70% with partial response (PR). Organ-specifi c responses (CR + PR/TOTAL) were skin 70% (14/20), mouth 80% (12/15), eyes 50% (5/10), liver 70% (7/10), joints 62% (5/8), caquexia 25% (1/4), thrombopenia 66% (4/6), gut 66% (4/6), polimyositis (1/3), vagina (0/1), pure red cell aplasia (1/1), esofagous (1/2), microangiopathic anemia (2/2), immune hemolytic anemia (1/1). Response was transitory in 16 of the 22 responsive patients with a median of 8 months. Seven patients developed bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) after treatment. Clinical relapse was only observed in two cases of Hodgkin\u00b4s lymphoma. Disease free survival was 68% at 5 years. There were 8 deaths due to toxic or infectious complications. Nine patients received additional cycles of rituximab with a low response rate. Conclusions: Rituximab treatment represents a therapeutic option for patients with refractory cGVHD. Overall response rate is high but transient in many cases. The best response rates were observed in cases with skin, oral or liver involvement and in patients with peripheral cytopenias. We have observed a high percentage of patients who had developed BO after treatment, although the role of rituximab is unknown.",

Akyol Ankara University (Ankara, TR) Background: Well-recognized videocapillaroscopic patterns have been described in systemic sclerosis (SS). However no studies have described the capillary abnormalities of sclerodermoid cGvHD (Scl GvHD) developed after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Objective: The aims of this study were to fi nd the characteristics of nail-fold capillary changes in Scl GvHD after allo-HSCT. Patients and methods: Eighteen patients affected by Scl GvHD and a control group of 15 lichenoid GvHD patients were evaluated during the period from September 2008 to June 2009. Duration and type of sclerodermoid GVHD, Raynaud's phenomenon (RP), dysphagia, joint contractures, ANA, serum anti-SCL70 and anticentromere (ACA) antibodies were investigated parameters. A nail-fold capillary examination using a standard dermatoscope (Dermlite Foto, 3 Gen, LLC, Dana Point, CA, USA) was performed on all fi ngers. Results: Twelve patients were male and 6 were female with a mean age of 37 \u00b1 11.6 years. Joint retractions and dysphagia developed in 27.8% and 38.9% of the patients, respectively. Three (16.7%) patients had RP. Autoimmune markers like serum anti-SCL-70 and ACA were negative in all. Capillaro scopy was abnormal in 15 patients with Scl GvHD. A regular disposition of the capillary loops along with avascular whitish linear areas at the level of last row, neovascularization with reticular pattern, capillary disorganization, hemorrhages, enlarged capillaries and avascular areas were the main features. No capillary abnormalities has been observed in patients with lichenoid GvHD. There was no statistically signifi cant correlation between ANA positivity, RP, joint retractions, dysphagia, extension of sclerodermoid GvHD, duration of sclerodermoid lesions and nailfold capillaroscopy analysis. Conclusions: This study shows the identifi cation of distinct nailfold capillaroscopy patterns in Scl GvHD patients but it does not confer special risk for any other specifi c clinical symptoms of the disease. Further studies are needed to clarify the diagnostic and prognostic value of capillaroscopy in Scl GvHD.",

Cuatrecasas, L. Rodr\u00edguez, J. Llach, M. Rovira, F. Fern\u00e1ndez-Avil\u00e9s, L. Rosi\u00f1ol, E. Carreras Hospital Cl\u00ednic (Barcelona, ES) Nausea, watery diarrhea, loos of appetite, bloody or mucoid stool, and abdominal pain are the primary manifestations of gastrointestinal (GI) GVHD; however, there is wide overlap of symptoms and signs with other GI diseases such as enteric infections and drug toxicity. GI endoscopic biopsy is the more useful tool to diagnose these patients and to initiate the specifi c treatment. However, persistence of GI symptoms despite initial treatment is frequent and a second endoscopic evaluation may be helpful to address therapy. We performed a retrospective study to determine the diagnostic value of serial GI endoscopic evaluation of alloSCT patients with persistent diarrhea despite treatment based in the fi rst endoscopic study. We identifi ed 29 patients (12 F/17 M) who had more than one sigmoidoscopy and biopsy (median 2; range 2-5). Simultaneous microbiologic analyses of stools, CMV monitoring by antigenemia and/or PCR, and CMV immunostainig on colonic biopsies were performed. Median time from 1st to 2nd endoscopy was 19 days (range 5-98). Abnormal GI mucosa (edema, erosions and/or ulcers) was observed in 23 and in 24 patients in 1st and 2nd endoscopies, respectively. Of 29 fi rst rectosigmoid biopsies evaluated histologically, 18 (62%) were classifi ed as GVHD, 2 (7%) as GVHD simultaneously with CMV, 4 (14%) as non-CMV infection, and 5 (17%) as normal or unspecifi c. Second GI biopsies were diagnostic of active GVHD in 6 (17%) cases, GVHD simultaneously with CMV infection in 4 (14%), regenerative changes post-GVHD in 8 (28%), CMV infection in 3 (10%), and normal or unspecifi c in 8 (28%). Positive predictive value (PPV) and sensibility of endoscopy for GVHD were 70% and 80%, respectively, with a specifi city of 22%. In 21 out of 29 (72%) patients the histologic fi ndings of 2nd endoscopic biopsy varied in comparison to 1st biopsy, leading to a therapy change in 20 (69%) of them (increase or decrease of immunosupressive treatment and/or treatment of coexistent infection). Most patients with negative CMV antigenemia and/or PCR had no signs of CMV infection in GI biopsies; however, there were 6 endoscopies out of 72 with CMV cytopatic changes and positive immunostaining on biopsies with negative results in blood (PPV of 47%, NPV of 89%, sensibility of 57%, and specifi city of 85%). In conclusion, our results showed a reliable diagnostic value for serial GI endoscopic evaluation that could impact on therapeutic decision in patients with persistent diarrhea after allo-SCT. S138 disease (cGvHD) of the lung remains a serious non infectious, late onset pulmonary complication, contributing to treatment related morbidity and mortality of the older patients. Since the clinical entity of pulmonary cGvHD in an older population after reduced toxicity/intensity conditioning has not yet been well characterized, we performed a retrospective analysis of patients, who were transplanted after FBM conditioning at the University Hospital Freiburg between 2003 and 2005 and were alive at least 100 days after HSCT. 92 patients were enrolled in this study (median age of 60 years (range 29-71)). All patients received conditioning with fl udarabin (4-5 \u00d7 30 mg/m\u00b2), BCNU (or carmustine, patients > 55 years: 2 \u00d7 150 mg/m\u00b2, < 55 years: 2 \u00d7 200 mg/m\u00b2) and melphalan (patients > 55 years 1 \u00d7 110 mg/m\u00b2, < 55 years: 1 \u00d7 140 mg/m\u00b2, fo). Peripheral stem cell grafts were used in most of the cases together with cyclosporin based GvHD prophylaxis. Seven patients (8.2%) developed a pulmonary cGvHD as defi ned by NIH criteria with a median time after HCT of 13.3 months (range 7-19 m). In those patients, pulmonary function tests prior to HCT and on day + 100 (prior to pulmonary GvHD) revealed a signifi cant reduction in mean% of predicted value in FEV1 (88 vs. 71%), and of absolute values in MEF50 (3.33 vs. 1.91 ) and MEF25 (0.96 vs. 0.42) as characteristic changes. The patients with pulmonary GvHD showed at the time of diagnosis in comparison to values before HSCT obstructive (% of predicted FEV1 71 vs. 50%), restrictive (mean% of predicted VCmax 78 vs. 64%) and diffusions capacity changes (% of predicted TLCOc SB 79 vs. 62%). In univariate analysis, following risk factors for developing pulmonary cGvHD were found: unrelated donor, chronic GvHD, smoking and lung disease (e.g. infections) after HCT. In conclusion, we found several risk factors and changes in pulmonary function test associated with developing pulmonary GvHD in HCT after reduced toxicity conditionig. These fi ndings might help to identify a risk population in older patients and therefore result in personalized measures for GvHD prophylaxis.",

The observation that Rituximab induces a signifi cant clinical response in a proportion of HCT patients with refractory cGVHD, prompted us to evaluate, in our CMV IgG positive HCT patients who developed skin chronic GVHD scleroderma-like, fi rst the effi cacy of Rituximab, second weather the potential effect of Rituximab would correlate with the anti-viral antibodies titer. Among 18 patients undergone HCT for hematological malignancies in our Institute, two of them (patients #2; #3) both positive for anti-UL94 and anti-NAG-2 antibodies and with clinical evidence of diffuse, SSc-like skin cGVHD following HCT, were treated with Rituximab 375 mg/msq weekly for 4 weeks and then monthly up to 4 months. Patient #2 complited the schedule, patient #3 discontinued the therapy, after the second monthly dose, due to infectious pneumonia. Patients' plasma was monitored for anti-UL94 and anti-NAG-2 antibodies titer, by direct and competitive ELISA assays, before starting Rituximab, after the weekly therapy, at the end of the schedule (patient #2) or after the last Rituximab infusion, in case of discontinuation (patient #3). In patient #2 we observed a dramatic reduction of the anti-NAG-2 antibodies titer immediately after completing the weekly administration of Rituximab, reaching a stable plateau after the monthly administration of the monocolonal therapy in parallel with an excellent clinical response. In the same patient anti-UL94 antibodies titer was already low after HCT and before Rituximab, and it kept stable low values during the entire administration schedule. This patient is still off immunosuppressive treatment. We observed also a reduction of both anti-CMV antibodies titer in patient #3 following Rituximab, however without reaching a plateau, mainly due to the early discontinuation of the treatment. This patient had also a mild clinical response and is still under immunosuppressive therapy.",

Peniket (1 T-replete reduced intensity conditioned (RIC) allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is associated with lower relapse rate but higher acute & chronic graft-versus-host disease (a/c GvHD) incidence than T-depleted HSCT. We retrospectively analysed the nature of GvHD, treatment required & transplant variables associated with GvHD development. 75 patients (pts) -43M 32F, median age 49 yrs (range 26-66) who underwent RIC sibling HSCT between 1998-2009 were analysed. Pts received fl udarabine (125 mg/m 2 )/melphalan (140 mg/ m 2 ) conditioning. Ciclosporin A (CsA) was used as GvHD prophylaxis, initial protocol did not use methotrexate (MTX) prophylaxis, subsequent pts were scheduled to receive four doses of MTX (5 mg/m 2 ): 8 pts (11%) received no MTX, 28 (37%) 1-3 doses & 37 (49%) the planned 4 doses. aGvHD occurred in 38/74 pts (51%), NIH consensus categories: classic acute 24 (32%), delayed 6 (8%), persistent 7 (9%), recurrent 1 (1.4%). Multivariate analysis showed age > 50 yrs predictive of aGvHD (P = 0.04). 69 pts survived > day 100 -cGvHD was analysed in this group; 49 pts (71%) developed cGvHD. NIH categories were classic chronic (CC) 34 pts (49%), overlap (OC) 15 pts (22%). Cumulative requirement for systemic immunosuppressive therapy (IST) was 39% at 6M & 58% at 12M, only 1 pt (1.5%) commenced IST beyond 12M ( Figure 1 ). Median time to IST was signifi cantly less for OC than for CC (4.5M & 9M respectively, hazard ratio (HR) for OC 5.4 , P = 0.0004), cumulative proportions requiring IST at 12M were 100% & 65% for OC & CC respectively. Univariate analysis showed reduced MTX prophylaxis as signifi cantly associated with increased IST requirement (HR for reduced MTX 2.6, P = 0.008). In multivariate analysis reduced MTX showed a trend to signifi cance for predicting IST requirement (P = 0.11). Mean CsA level at 21 days & 3M did not predict IST requirement. Cumulative proportions of pts still on IST from commencement are shown in Figure 2 . Median time to IST cessation was 40M, 26% of patients (95% CI 17-50%) remain on IST at 5 yrs. There was no signifi cant difference in time to IST cessation by NIH a/ c GvHD category, MTX or CsA level. Cumulative mortality from cGvHD in patients surviving > D100 was 5.4% at 2 yrs. Conclusions: cGvHD is common after T-replete sibling RIC HSCT; full prophylactic MTX, but not mean CsA level, is important in cGvHD prevention; IST for cGvHD is commonly required for several years; cGvHD is cause of signifi cant morbidity but modest mortality.",

Finet, M. Uzunov, S. N Guyen, J.P. Vernant, N. Dh\u00e9din Pitie Salpetriere (Paris, FR) Backgrounds: The diagnosis of gastrointestinal graftversus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation is usually assessed by clinical symptoms and histological analyses after digestive endoscopy. This approach is frequently not satisfactory because of its lack of specificity. A murin transplantation model has suggested that inflammatory activity associated with intestinal GVHD can be assessed by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). Therefore, we evaluated the utility of FDG-PET in the diagnosis of intestinal GVHD in transplanted patients. Methods: Between February 2008 and March 2009, patients with a suspected diagnosis of gastrointestinal GVHD after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) were enrolled in our study. They were examined by FDG-PET and digestive endoscopy (gastroduodenal fi broscopy, rectosigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy when feasible) with biopsy. Stool samples were screened for bacterial, viral, mycological and parasitic gastrointestinal infections. Patients were systematically screened for adenovirus and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections by specifi c PCR in the blood and immunofl uorescence stainings in digestive biopsies. Results: Eleven patients with clinical symptoms of GVHD in a median time of 35 days (4-392) after HSCT were tested. Two patients had a stage 2 digestive GVHD and 9 patients a stage 3-4. None of them was positive for viral, mycological or parasitic infections in the stool, 6 were colonized with an intestinal bacteria but all were negative for clostridium diffi cile toxin. One patient presented a CMV colitis based on the biopsy and blood samples. FDG-PET was performed in a median time of 6 days after the beginning of the symptoms . Seven patients presented a FDG uptake of the gut. All of the 11 patients had sigmoid biopsies, 6 had staged biopsies of all colon and 4 gastroduodenal biopsies. For 6 patients, histological and FDG-PET results were concordant (5 were both positive and 1 both negative). In 3 patients, the FDG-PET showed no uptake whereas the histological analysis was positive. For the 2 remaining patients, FDG uptake was localized in the ileum and therefore not accessible to biopsy. Conclusion: FDG-PET is a non invasive tool that can be useful in some patients with suspected intestinal GVHD. This approach may be interesting to guide biopsy when the diagnosis is diffi cult with the usual assessment, in particularly in the small intestine localization.",

Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) has been shown to be an effective treatment for patients with steroid resistant GVHD. We report our experience on ECP treatment for aGVHD both in adult and pediatric patients. Methods: Ninety-two patients, 49 children (median age 8 years) and 43 adults (median age 41 years) with steroid-refractory aGVHD, grade II (n = 46), III (n = 27) or IV (n = 19) were treated with ECP in two Italian hospitals. ECP was started after a median interval from aGVHD onset of 48 days in the adult patients and 27 days in the pediatric patients. The median duration of ECP was 153 days (15-985) in adult patients and 141 days (14-311) in pediatric patients for a median number of 20 (1-51) and 10 (3-45) cycles respectively. Results: Fifty-six patients (61%) survived and 36 died. Fourteen patients died of leukemia relapse, while 22 of GVHD with or without infections. As regards alive patients, 38 of them (68%) had a complete response (57% of the adults and 74% of the children) and eleven (20%) had a partial response (29% adults and 17% children). Complete responses were obtained in 71%, 75%, 44% of patients, respectively, with grade II, III, IV aGVHD. A complete response of aGVHD manifestations of skin, gut and liver was present respectively in 74%, 82%, 100% of pediatric patients and in 66%, 40%, 27% of adult patients. Conclusions: Our data confi rm the effi cacy of ECP in the treatment of resistant aGVHD, both in pediatric and adult patients. Moreover, skin, gut and liver all show good response to ECP.",

A mouse model of GVHD showed that G-CSF induce GVHD after bone marrow (BM) transplantation (Morris et al., Nature Med 15: 436, 2009 ). Total body irradiation (TBI) increased G-CSF receptors on host dendritic cells, stimulating acute GVHD. Their report prompted us to reassess the role of G-CSF prophylaxis in our HSCT patients. During 1994 patients. During -2002 patients were given G-CSF prophylaxis. Patients not given G-CSF (n = 205) who underwent HSCT from 1993 to 2003 were controls. We included all patients receiving BM (n = 286) or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts (n = 179) from HLA-identical siblings (n = 225) or HLA-A, -B, or DR\u00df1 genomically identical unrelated donors (MUDs; n = 240). The G-CSF group had more MUD transplants, fewer patients receiving reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC), more patients receiving antithymocyte globulin (P < 0.001), and AB0 mismatch was commoner (P = 0.03). Patients treated with G-CSF had acute GVHD (grades II-IV) of 29%, vs. 19% in the controls (P < 0.01). GVHD occurred in 33% of patients given PBSC, as compared to 19% of those given BM (P < 0.001). There was no signifi cant difference in incidence of GVHD between HLAidentical sibling transplants and MUD transplants, between those with myeloablative conditioning and those with RIC, or between those treated with TBI and chemotherapy and those treated with chemotherapy only. In patients conditioned with chemotherapy, 34% in the G-CSF group developed acute GVHD as compared to 21% in the controls (P = 0.035). In patients treated with TBI, those given G-CSF had an incidence of acute GVHD (grades II-IV) of 26% as opposed to 17% in the controls (P = 0.10). In PBSC recipients, 39% in the G-CSF group developed acute GVHD as compared to 24% in the controls (P = 0.025). In recipients of BM, the corresponding fi gures were 22% and 15%, respectively, in the two groups (P = 0.19 ). In the present study, a multivariate analysis showed that acute GVHD of grades II-IV was associated with PBSC grafting (hazards ratio (HR) = 2.29, P < 0.0001), female donors (HR = 1.74, P = 0.005), major AB0 mismatch (HR = 1.58, P = 0.03), and G-CSF (HR = 1.52, P = 0.03). Differences were adjusted. There were no differences between the two groups regarding nonrelapse mortality, relapse, and survival. Conclusion: G-CSF induces GVHD in mice, but differs compared to humans regarding the role of source of stem cell and conditioning regimen.",

Smolarczyk-Wodzynska, M. Lakomy, E. Brojer, B. Marianska Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine (Warsaw, PL) Introduction: Chemokines are major mediators in the infl ammation and immune responses, especially in alloreactivity. RANTES (Regulated upon Activation, Normal T cell Expressed and Secreted) is a member of CC-chemokine family, known as CCL5 (CC-chemokine ligand 5) and is a potent chemoattractant for memory T lymphocytes, monocytes and eosinophils. This study aimed to determine association between SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in the CCL5/RANTES promoter gene at positions -28C/T (rs1800825) and -403C/T (rs2107538) with the outcome of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) performed between August 2003 and April 2009 in our center. Materials and methods: The allelic variants of these 2 SNPs were determined in 64 patient/donor pairs by real-time polymerase chain reaction (TaqMan-MGB). Patients characteristics were: median age 36 (range 18-65), underlaying diseases-haematologic malignancies in 62 and aplastic anemia -in 2 cases. Donors were HLA-identical sibling-in 46 and unrelated-in 18 transplants, the median age-37 (range 14-65). The studied end points were GvHD, oral mucositis, haemorrhagic cystitis, toxicity and venooclusive disease (VOD) of the liver and survival. Results: The allelic distribution of CCL5/RANTES SNPs was similar to that reported in Caucasoid population. Acute-GvHD was recognized in 31/64 (48,4%) and chronic-in 34/64 (53%) of patients. Overall survival in analysed group was 56%. Our study revealed signifi cant correlation between the -403C/T SNP in patients and the occurrence and severity of aGvHD (TT and CT vs. CC genotypes -41,7% vs. 31,4% respectively, P = 0.025) and the differences in donors genotypes were indicative of the trend (P = 0.095). Besides we found a trend toward correlation between the -403C/T SNP in recipients and development of VOD 8% vs. 11 ,8%, P = 0.070) and haemorrhagic cystitis (30,8% vs. 17,6%, P = 0.071). The only statistically signifi cant correlation for -28C/T SNP was increased overall survival obtained by the Kaplan-Meier method for patients carrying CT genotype (100% vs. 51,7% for TT-homozygotes, P = 0.048). Besides we couldn't fi nd any correlation between CCL5 SNPs and the rest of analysed end points (P = ns). Conclusion: Our data revealed that SNPs in the CCL5/RANTES promoter gene at positions -28 and -403 are correlated with aGvHD, toxic complications and overall survival after alloHSCT and should be investigated prospectively and in the larger group of patients.",

Moreover due to the restriction of the available systems to patient weighing more than 40 kg (Therakos system) the feasability in especially small children is not widely shown. We report here our expirience in the treatment of acute and chronic GVHD in pediatric patients and specially in small children treated with ECP. Patients and methods: From 1996 to 2009 32 patients, 9 with a.GVHD and 23 with c.GVHD were treated with ECP. Patients weighing less than 40 kg were available for the offl ine system consisting of one leukapheresis on d1 and 2 reinfusions on d 1 + 2 separately (n = 15) or in very small children or critical ill children with a MINI ECP (n = 2)consisting of the preparation of MNC from 50 to 100 ml peripheral blood and consecutively the irradiation with UVA after adding 8-MOP, and fi nally the closed system (UVAR XTS, Therakos Corp., n = 15). Results: In a.GVHD 8/9 patients responded with improvement overal and 9/9 in skin, 3/3 in gut and 3/4 in liver involvment after 2 or 3 ECP cycles. In median 10 ECP cycles in weekly to 2 weekly interval were necessary before stopping the treatment. In c.GVHD 14 patients improved and 6 patients did not improve. Skin improved in 17/22, gut 2/3 and liver 4/4. In median 27 ECPs were necessary per patient. The interval was 1 month weekly, 2 months 2 weekly and than due to the repsonse 2 weekly or monthly. In chronic GVHD the overal survival was determinated by the response to the ECP treatment (100% overal survival in patients who responded to ECP treatment and 40% overal survival in patients who did not responded to ECP treatment. In chronic GVHD 8/9 with the offl ine system (1 apheresis and 2 reinfusions) responded and 10/15 with the closed system responded. There was no difference between the methods used for ECP. In total 712 procedures were perfomed (227 (acute GVHD 78) apheresis with 454 reinfusions with the offl ine method, 16 MINI ECP, and 489 closed ECP with the UVAR XTS) (Neither with the offl ine nor with the closed system any very severe adverse events were registered. Conclusion: We used different methods for ECP in pediatric patients and could demonstrate in acute GVHD an overal repsonse of 90%, in chronic GVHD of 74%. This was not depended on the method of ECP used. Therefoe we conclude, that ECP could be safely in pediatric patients with all available methods.",

This study examined the impact of the FCGR3A polymorphism in donors and recipients on the clinical outcomes in unrelated HLA-fully-matched myeloablative bone marrow transplantation (BMT) through the Japan Marrow Donor Program (JMDP). The FCGR3A-V158F genotype was retrospective analyzed in a total 99 recipients with myeloid malignancies and their unrelated donors. The presence of the 158V genotype in recipients showed a statistically better overall survival (OS; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.49; 95% confi dence interval [CI], 0.26-0.93; P = 0.03) and transplant-related mortality (TRM; HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.14-0.67; P = 0.003) without signifi cant infl uence on the relapse rate. The recipient 158V genotype was also associated with a signifi cantly reduced risk of chronic GVHD (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.20-0.99; P = 0.049) and a trend toward a reduced risk of II-IV acute GVHD (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.27-1.10; P = 0.09), leading to a signifi cantly reduced GVHD-related mortality (HR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.06-0.77; P = 0.02). The donor FCGR3A polymorphism did not have any impact on the transplant outcomes. These results therefore suggest an association between the recipient FCGR3A genotype and the clinical outcomes after BMT. These fi ndings could therefore be useful for selecting appropriate risk-specifi c precautions following transplantation.",

Vigouroux (1) , R. Tabrizi (1) , C. Melot (1) , J. Coiffard (1) , X. Lafarge (2) , G. Marit (1) , K. Bouabdallah (1) , A. Pigneux (1) , T. Leguay (1) , , A. Schmitt (1) , , N. Milpied (1) The combination of a calcineurin inhibitor and short course of methotrexate is a consensual prophylaxis of graft versus host disease (GvHD) after standard myeloablative conditioning regimens (CR). The best prophylaxis is less clearly defi ned after unrelated reduced-intensity allogeneic transplantation (RIC allo-SCT) following a CR with antithymocyte globulin (ATG). In these circumstances, a calcineurin inhibitor is always used but the role of methotrexate remains a matter of debate. To explore the effects of methotrexate in this setting, we conducted a retrospective monocentric analysis of unrelated RIC allo-SCT between 2005 and 2009. Sixty-three patients were selected based on a total dose of 5 mg/kg of ATG in the CR. The median age was 53 years. Diseases were AML (n = 28), ALL (n = 5), lymphoma (n = 13), myelodysplasia (n = 7), myeloma (n = 7), myeloproliferative syndrome (n = 2) and CLL (n = 1). Conditioning regimens were Fludarabine-Busulfan-ATG (n = 48) or Fludarabine-Treosulfan-ATG (n = 15). Two groups were individualized for the analysis. A group M + (n = 39) received methotrexate at 15 mg/m\u00b2 on Day 1, 10 mg/m\u00b2 on Days 3 and 6. A group M-(n = 24) did not. All patients received ciclosporine. There was no signifi cant difference between both groups regarding diseases (P = 0.6), status at transplant (P = 0.5) , female donor for male patient (P = 0.5) , HLA mismatches (P = 0.5) , source of stem cells (P = 0.9 ) or year of tranplant (P = 0.7). Patients in the M + group were older (57 vs. 49 years). Patients in the M-group received more often Treosulfan (14 vs. 1; P < 0.01). In the M-and M + groups, cumulative incidences (CI) of grade II-IV aGVHD were 52% and 32%, respectively (P = 0.07) while CI of grade III-IV aGvHD were 43% and 10%, respectively (P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis indicated that grade III-IV aGvHD was favoured only by the absence of methotrexate. In the M + and M-groups, with a median followup of 24 months the 2-year OS were 69% and 42%, respectively (P = 0.09); the 2-year DFS were 58% and 46% respectively (P = 0.2), the 2-year TRM were 21% and 45%, respectively (P = 0.09); and the 2-year incidence of relapse were 25% and 28%, respectively (P = 0.7). These data suggest that methotrexate protects from severe acute GvHD without increasing the risk of relapse after unrelated RIC transplantation with a trend for a better survival. This protective effect was observed despite the older age of patients receiving methotrexate.",

Cuore (Rome, IT) The immunosuppressive (IS) agent mycophenolic acid (MMF) is metabolized by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A9 (UGT1A9) and it has as target enzyme inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH1) which is the rate limiting step of de novo pathway for purine synthesis. Several studies on kidney transplantation demonstrated that pts carrying C-440T/T-331C UGT1A9 gene polymorphisms could have different MMF pharmacokinetic and patients with rs2278293 and rs 2278294 IMPDH1 gene polymorphisms could have a different incidence of graft rejection. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the C-440T/T-331C and rs2278293 and rs 2278294 polymorphisms prevalence in pts submitted to alloSCT submitted to GVHD prophylaxis with MMF and their role in GVHD and other complications after SCT. We studied 23 consecutive pts submitted to alloSCT between February 2006 and April 2009. Blood samples from pts and their donors were collected after signed informed consent. C-440T/T-331C and rs2278293 and rs 2278294 polymorphisms were evaluated by PCR amplifi cation of genomic DNA. Pts' characteristics were: M/F 13/11, median age 55 y (range 14-68). They were affected by AML (10), MM (4), ALL (3), CLL (3), NHL (2), HD (1) and IMF (1) . Disease status at transplant was: CR in 4 pts, PR in 12, SD in 2 and PD in 4 pts respectively. All pts were submitted to a RIC followed by CSA and MMF prophylaxis; MMF was administered at 15 mg/kg until day + 28 and + 36 after SCT in related and unrelated SCT respectively. Stem cells source was PB in 22 and CB in 2 pts. The incidence of aGVHD grade III-IV was 25% while the incidence of cGVHD 33%. The TRM was 16.6% The DFS was 70% with a median F-U of 18 months (0-46). We observed the following prevalence of the different genotypes: UGT1A9 -440CC 43 and 30%, CT 39 and 52%, TT 18% in pt and donors respectively, UGT1A9 -331 TT 43 and 30%, TC 39 and 52%, CC 18% in pts and donors respectively, IMPDH1 rs2278293 GG 39%, GA 43%, AA 18% in both pts and donors, and rs 2278294 GG 39 and 52%, GA 47 and 34%, AA 14 and 4% in pts and donor respectively. We did not fi nd any correlation between these polymorphisms and the incidence of GVHD, TRM and relapse incidence. In conclusion polymorphisms of gene related to MMF pharmacokinetic and activity are not correlated to immunological events after alloSCT. One of hypothesis could be the relatively small period of MMF administration in HSCT in comparison to longer period of IS therapy in solid organ transplantation. N. Kawashima (1) , H.

            "text": "Background: Human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) is frequently reactivated and detected in plasma of patients in the early phase of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). HHV-6 reactivation has been implicated to be associated with signifi cant morbidity, including encephalitis, bone marrow suppression or acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). However the clinical manifestation and management of HHV-6 reactivation in patients undergoing HSCT are not subject to a clear consensus. We investigated the incidence of HHV-6 reactivation in relation to mortality and morbidity in children. Patients and methods: Between April 2005 and October 2009, 62 consecutive pediatric recipients of allogeneic HSCT were weekly monitored for HHV-6 loads measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Hematological malignancies were diagnosed in 57 patients and non-malignant disorders in fi ve patients. Twenty patients received related bone marrow, 24 patients unrelated bone marrow, 15 patients unrelated cord blood, and three patients related peripheral blood stem cell. Serological HLA disparities were 0 (n = 44), 1 (n = 15), and 2 (n = 3). HHV-6 reactivation was treated in the presence of clinical symptoms. Results: HHV-6 reactivation was observed in 36 of 62 patients (58%) by day 100 after allogeneic HSCT. HHV-6 loads more than 500 copies/mcg DNA were associated with higher nonrelapse mortality (P = .070 using a generalized Wilcoxon test). Twenty-two patients developed aGVHD and the incidence of HHV-6 reactivation was 14 of 22 (64%) and 22 of 40 (55%) with or without aGVHD. The incidence of aGVHD was 3 out of 10 (30%) and 11 out of 26 (42%), with or without administration of gancyclovir or cidofovir, respectively. Administration of antiviral agents was related to the reduced incidence of aGVHD using a multivariate logistic regression analysis (P = .086). Conclusion: HHV-6 reactivation is common after HSCT in children and is associated with signifi cant morbidity such as aGVHD. Prompt administration of antiviral agents suppresses symptoms caused by the reactivation of HHV-6 and thereby may reduce the development of aGVHD. A. Lange (1) (",

The expressions of IL-17 FoxP3 and IFN-gamma were studied in stimulated PBMC (brefeldin A Inomycin and PMA) of alloHSCT pts (48 pts, median age: 45 yrs range; 1.0-64 yrs, with 46 hematological malignancies and 2 SCID, 23 MUD and 25 SIB transplants). The cells were labeled with CD4 IL-17A IFNg and FoxP3 MoAbs and analyzed in the CD4 + lymph. subpopulation. 21 developed aGvHD among them 8 pts had aGvHD (4 skin and 4 gut) at a later stage after hematological reconstitution and 5 pts suffered from aGvHD. We found: 1. Percentage of IL-17 producing lymph. was higher in pts at hematological reconstitution as compared to healthy controls (0.76 \u00b1 0.13 vs. 0.19% \u00b1 0.06, P = 0.03) 2. aGvHD cases with an onset of the disease at the time of hematological reconstitution had lower proportions of IL-17A + producing CD4 + lymph. then those without aGvHD at the similar time post HSCT (0.29 \u00b1 0.09 vs. 0.76% \u00b1 0.13, P = 0.02). Pts they manifested aGvHD at later time post transplant had an increase in proportions of IL-17 producing cells 3 to 7 days prior the overt maniferstation which signifi cantly declined at the onset of symptoms (1.07 + 0.37 vs. 0.34% + 0.14, P = 0.01) 3. Gut aGvHD similarly to skin aGvHD characterized with a decrease of IL-17 producing CD4 + cells at the time of aGvHD manifestation. However, lower values of IL-17 producing CD4 + cells were seen in gut aGvHD earlier than in the skin variant of the disease 4. A high degree of correlation was found between the percentages of IL-17A + and IFNg + in CD4 + lymph. in blood at the time of hematological recovery (r = 0.586, P = 0.002) 5. Percentages of IFNg-producing CD4 + cells correlated with proportions of FoxP3 + cells in CD4 + lymph. population (r = 0.427, P = 0.03). Conclusion: HSCT patients had higher proportions of IL-17 producing cells under stimulation as compared to donors. Proportions of these cells further increase prior to the overt manifestation of aGvHD and decrease when the disease is full blown. Proportions of FoxP3 + CD4 + in lymph. increase at the manifestation of aGvHD likely to counter-balance alloreactivity as suggested by a positive correlation with percentages of IFNg producing cells in lymphocytes under the culture conditions.",

However, it is unclear whether early oral intake is of benefi t in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). To elucidate the impact of early oral nutrition on clinical outcome, we performed a retrospective cohort study in a single institution. Methods: 241 patients recieiving allogeneic HSCT between September 2004 and September 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. 13 patients were excluded due to early death (< 35 days). The remaining 228 patients were analyzed for nutritional history just after day 0 of HSCT. Results: 87 patients (38%) were able to eat everyday after day 0 of HSCT; whereas 63 (28%) patiants were not able to eat anything for 1 to 6 days; 78 (34%) patients for more than 7 days (7-62 days). There were no signifi cant differences in baseline clinical characteristics. Patients with no oral intake more than 7 days (\u2265 7 days group), as compared with 0 days (0 days group), was associated with an increased risk of grade II-IV or grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (54% vs. 23%, P = 0.001; 18% vs. 5%, P = 0.02, respectively).

Afanasyev St-Petersburg Pavlov State Medical Unive (St. Petersburg, RU) Introduction: Allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is currently one of the most effective methods 100 of treatment for various malignant hematological disorders. Recently, the ABO system antigens incompatibility between donor and recipient is given much emphasis as an important risk factor able to infl uence allo-HSCT recipients post-transplant course. Materials and methods: 240 allo-HSCT recipients were included in this study, 69 patients were transplanted from matched related donors, 171 patients from matched unrelated donors. 146 of donor-recipient pairs were ABO mismatched, 54(37%) of the pairs had major, 67(45,9%) minor and 25(17,1%) bidirectional mismatch. 94(39,2%) pairs were ABO-compatible. In 148 cases as stem cell source were used peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC), in 92 cases was used bone marrow (BM). Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis regimen was identical in all patients groups. Results: We observed no signifi cant differences in engraftment (Leu > 1,0*10 9 /l, Neu > 0,5*10 9 /l, Plt > 50*10 9 /l) in ABO-compatible and ABO-incompatible patient groups (P = 0.6), there was also no difference in engraftment between patient groups with different forms of ABO-incompatibility (P = 0,38). In 2 patients with major ABO-incopatibility was observed pure red cell aplasia. Incidence (P < 0,01) and severity of acute GVHD were signifi cantly higher in ABO-incompatible allo-HSCT recipients (P = 0,005). No significant difference in acute GVHD incidence (P = 0,38) and severity (P = 0,6) was noted between patient groups with different forms of ABO-incompatibility. The risk of acute GVHD development differed in ABO-incompatible HSCT recipients from matched unrelated (81,3%) and related (44%) donors (P = 0,002). Conclusions: ABO-incompatibility is an important risk factor for acute GVHD development, but doesn't infl uence the engraftment.",

Baumgarten, J. Finke University Hospital Freiburg (Freiburg, DE) Tolerance induction remains to be critical for longterm survivors after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are involved in the regulation of graft versus host disease (GvHD) and graft versus leukemia effect (GvL). Although calcineurin inhibitors are frequently being used for the prevention of GvHD, tolerance induction might be hampered in HCT patients due to deteriorated Treg function. Data from animal models of HCT suggest that inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) results not only in suppressed T cell alloreactivity but also in sustained Treg function. Therefore we initiated a phase I/II monocenter trial using everolimus and mycophenolate-sodium (MMF-Na) as GvHD prophylaxis in patients undergoing allogeneic HCT with peripheral stem cell (PBSC) grafts after reduced toxicity conditioning. No additional T cell depleting agents were used for GvHD prophylaxis. So far 13 patients were included (median age: 49,6 years, range: 26-64). The diagnoses were: AML (n = 4), sAML (n = 6), MDS (n = 1), CML (n = 1), T-PLL (n = 1). 8/11 AML/MDS patients were at high risk (not in CR1) for relapse. Grafts were obtained from unrelated (n = 7) and related (n = 6) HLA-matched donors. With no graft failures, engraftment kinetics for myeloid cells were normal, and reconstitution of the T cell compartment reached median cell counts of > 200 CD4 + cells/\u03bcl at day + 30. No grade IV/V toxicities (according to CTC criteria) were observed due to the study medication. After a median follow-up of 11 months four patients have died. The causes were refractory acute GvHD in a patient with CML, severe pulmonary toxicity/ BOOP, HHV6 associated encephalitis, and one late relapse. Out of 12 patients reaching CR, only two patients relapsed after 8 and 19 months. CMV reactivation could be seen in 3/9 patients at risk. The early recovery of T cell immunity correlated in 9/12 patients with a brief period of acute GvHD grade II-IV. Chronic GvHD could be observed in 8/9 patients, mostly mild to moderate forms. No severe bacterial or fungal infections were observed even in cases with prolonged everolimus treatment. In conclusion, GvHD prophylaxis with everolimus and MMF-Na is feasible but results in an increased frequency of mild to moderate chronic GvHD. Since this sustained mild alloreactivity might reduce the risk of relapse this regimen could be suited for patients undergoing HCT with advanced or uncontrolled malignant disease.",

Kucher, Y. Zalyalov, I. Kazancev, S. Andreev, O. Goloschapov, B. Ganapiev, B. Afanasyev St. Petersburg Medical State University (St. Petersburg, RU) Introduction: Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is a major complication developing in 30-60% of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCST) recipients in spite of the use different prophylactic regimens. Preliminary clinical data showed the infl uence of omega-3 fatty acids on cytokine profi le and infl ammatory reactions. We tried to reduce incidence and severity of aGVHD giving allo-HSCT recipients additional nutrition support (NS) with omega-3 fatty acids. Purpose: The main objective of this study was to evaluate the infl uence of omega-3 fatty acids NS on incidence and severity of aGVHD in allo-HSCT recipients after antithymocyte globulin (ATG) -containing conditioning regimens. Materials and methods: We analyzed data from 62 patients receiving allo-HSCT for acute myeloid leukemia (n = 14), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 39), chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 4), Hodgkin disease (n = 4), Kostman syndrome (n = 1). Median age was 25,4 (17-47) years. We divided the patients into three groups. All three groups received basic GVHD prophylaxis with CsA and Mtx. Control group of patients (n = 24) received only basic GVHD prophylaxis. In second group of patients (n = 28) we added to basic prophylaxis a course of ATG (ATGAM 20 mg/kg b.w. for three consecutive days). The third group of patients n = 10 (n = 2 allogeneic related HSCT and n = 8 allogeneic unrelated HSCT) for GvHD prophylaxis received ATG-containing prophylactic regimen with additional NS, starting from D + 1 after HSCT -low-bacterial enteral nutrition and parenteral nutrition with addition of omega-3 fatty acids -Omegaven, Fresenius Kabi 1,5 ml/kg/day iv or Lipo Plus, BBraun 1,5 g/kg/day iv. Results: We observed different occurrence of aGVHD in evaluated patients groups. The occurrence of grade III-IV aGVHD was 20,9% in the fi rst group (only basic prophylaxis), 14,3% in the second group (addition of ATG) and 10,0% in the third group (addition of omega-3 fatty acids). Conclusions: These preliminary results demonstrate lower occurrence of grade III-IV aGVHD in patients receiving NS with omega-3 fatty acids after employment of ATG-containing regimens. This effect requires further investigation.",

Afanasyev Pavlov State Medical University (St. Petersburg, RU) Background: Graft vs. host disease (GVHD) still remains one the major obstacles to successful allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HSCT). GVHD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. GVHD has an important impact on survival and the recipient's quality of life. The ability to prevent GVHD is the cornerstone of success. Immunosupression with pharmacological agents such as cyclosporine (CsA) or tacrolimus (Tx) is use for GVHD prophylaxis, because they share a common intracellular target. The toxicity profi les of CsA and Tx are very similar. However, we found that Tx was superior for the prophilaxis of acute GVHD, but more toxic. While hypertension and myelosupression is more commonly seen with CsA, neurological, nephrology and gastrointestinal side effect are more often associated with administration of Tx. Patients (pts) and methods: From 2000 till 12.2008 171 pts underwent 173 allo-HSCT. Pts and donor characteristics, type of allo-HSCT and preparing regimen are shown at Table 1 .",

Despite the fact Tx to be superior for the prophylaxis of acute GVHD, it was found to be more toxic. The incidence of hypertension was signifi cantly higher in CsA group (38% vs. 24%), but neurological complications (headache, tremor, paresthesia) were signifi cantly higher in Tx group (44% vs. 30%).

Donor lymphocytes can produce graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect, but it is often directed against normal tissues as graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), which increases post-transplant morbidity and mortality. The relationship between GvL and GvHD infl uences survival. S145 Methods: We analyzed data of 88 patients who received allogeneic PBSC (peripheral blood stem cells) graft, mostly from HLA-identical sibling donor. Cyclosporine A with methotrexate or sirolimus and tacrolimus were used for GvHD prophylaxis. Patients included acute myeloblastic and lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 31), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML, n = 31), lymphomas (n = 12), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL, n = 3), multiple myeloma (MM, n = 2) and other diagnoses (n = 9). The conditioning regimen before HSCT was myeloablative (52%) and reduced-intensity (48%). Acute GvHD was graded according to the Przepiorka\u00b4s criteria. Kaplan-Meier overall survival (OS) curves were calculated with regard to grade 0-I and II-III acute GvHD, separately for 4 groups according to diagnosis: 1) acute leukemia, 2) CML, 3) lymphomas, CLL and MM and 4) aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and kidney carcinoma. Results: Average time of patients' observation was 1249 days; the OS time for the whole group was 65%. There were no differences in OS between myeloablative (67%) vs. reduced-intensity conditioning (63%). 43% patients developed acute GvHD, which was categorized as grades I (18%), II (19%) and III (6% of patients). No case of grade IV acute GvHD was recorded. Probability of survival, regardless of diagnosis, without GvHD (grade 0) and with acute GvHD grades I, II and III were 65%, 59%, 76% and 60%, respectively. In acute leukemias, grades II-III were associated with better survival compared to grades 0-I of acute GvHD. Conversely, in the group with lymphomas, CLL and MM, grades II-III acute GvHD were associated with worse survival. The log-rank Mantel-Haenszel test in the common survival model for the groups 1), 2) and 3) rejected the homogeneity hypothesis (P < 0.05). Conclusions: GvHD may decrease the risk of relapse and mild GvHD is associated with improved OS in all types of acute leukemias after allogeneic HSCT. Patients with acute leukemia may benefi t from grade II of acute GvHD. Acknowledgements: This work was supported by grants IGA MZ CR NR9671-4 and MSM 021622430.",

Langner, P. Staber, W. Linkesch, D. Strunk Medical University of Graz (Graz, AT) Objectives: Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens are increasingly used to lower toxicity in patients not eligible for myeloablative stem cell transplantation (SCT). High rates of morbidity and mortality from acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) still remain a dilemma. Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), in addition to its dominant action as a T cell depleting agent, has been implicated to benefi cially infl uence GVHD by depleting host antigen presenting cells. We analyzed the effect of additional low dose rabbit ATG on the incidence of GVHD and documented infections. Methods: Forty-seven patients with a hematological malignancy ( 23 AML, 2 ALL, 4 CML, 6 CLL, 3 NHL, 9 MM), not eligible for myeloablative SCT either by age (median 52 years, range 21-72) or co-morbidities, received a fl udarabine-based RIC-SCT, whereas in the study group (n = 21) rabbit ATG (5 mg/kg daily for 4 days) was added to standard GVHD prophylaxis consisting of cyclosporine A and mycofenolate mofetil. Six patients had PD, 23 were in PR and 18 in CR. Results: After a median follow up of 38 months 25 of 47 (54%) patients were alive. Acute GVHD grade III-IV (24 vs. 27%, P = ns) was comparable in both groups. Overall (58 vs. 14%, P = 0.007) and extensive chronic GVHD (37 vs. 7%, P = 0.03) occurred more often in the control group. GVHD related deaths were documented in two ATG treated patients vs. three controls (18 vs. 27%, P = ns). Whereas CMV-DNA detected by PCR was present in eight patients in the study group vs. nine in controls, CMV disease was observed in one out of 21 patients after RIC-SCT with ATG and in two out of 26 transplant recipients not treated with ATG, respectively. The three year overall survival, total documented infections and relapse mortality did not differ signifi cantly. Conclusion: RIC including low dose rabbit ATG resulted in a considerably low incidence of chronic GVHD but had no major impact on acute GVHD or infection rates.",

            "text": "Graft versus host disease (GVHD) remains as one of the main causes of mortality and morbidity associated with the use of unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation (UBMT). Factors known to infl uence the GVHD incidence include the degree of HLA matching, donor sex and pregnancies and the use of an effective prophylactic regimen. We conducted a study in order to compare the effi cacy of Tacrlimus/Methotrexate (FK/MTX) and Cyclosporine/Methotrexate (CsA/MTX) in 31 patients given UBMT. The study population consisted of patients (pts) who had received a UBMT with a full myeloablative regimen and rescued with bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). FK was administered through continous i.v. infusion from the day -1 maintaining blood level between 5 and 15 ng/ ml. and converted to oral intake when it could be tolerated. CsA was administered from day -2, in twice short i.v. infusions maintaining blood levels between 200 and 500 ng/ml. Oral way was implemented as in the FK arm. MTX dose for both group was 10 mg/m\u00b2 on days 1, 3, 6 and 11. CsA/MTX was used in the fi rst 13 pts: acute leukemia (AL): 6, chronic myeloid leukemia 4 (CML), others: 3pts. and FK/MTX in the following 18 pts: AL: 14, CML: 1, others: 3 pts. Group risk were stratifi ed considering as good risk a 10/10 or 9/10 HLA match and male donor and high risk 8/10 or 7/10 and a female donor for acute GVHD. For chronic GVHD, good risk were pts. without previous aGVHD receiving BM cells. High risk were pts. with previous aGVHD having PBSC. For the entire population mean age was 19 years (1 -38). Results: The probability of aGVHD in the FK group was 50% and 66% in the CsA group at 100 days (P = 0.38). Thirteen patients (23%) in the FK group and 10 (30%) in the CsA group developed cGVHD (P = 0,38). There were no signifi cative differences comparing the high or low group risk for both aGVHD or cGVHD. TRM was 45% for CsA group and 30% for FK group (P = 0.45) and OS was 0.83 and 0.77 years for the FK and CsA respectively (P = 0.86). In conclusion our analysis showed a slight advantage but a non signifi cant difference for the FK/MTX group regarding aGVHD, cGVHD, TRM and OS. However our study was retrospective including a myriad of different diseases. Further studies comparing the same disease population who will receive UBMT may be warranted. A. Nazha, R. Cook, D.

Stadtmauer University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, US) Introduction: High dose melphalan and autologus stem cell transplant (ASCT) remains an effective treatment for patients with either newly diagnosed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM). Collection of suffi cient numbers of stem cells for more than one transplant is optimal. G-CSF with cyclophosphamide (CY/G-CSF) has been a widely used as effective regimen for stem cell mobilization in MM. Recently, Plerixafor with G-CSF has shown in randomized trials to be superior to G-CSF alone. We set out to assess the optimal method for stem cell mobilization at our institution. Materials and methods: We performed a single institution retrospective analysis of 365 patients with MM who underwent stem cell mobilization and harvest at the University of Pennsylvania from January 2002 to December 2007. 76 patients were excluded from this analysis due to incomplete data on stem cell mobilization regimen, or underwent allogeneic transplants. 289 patients were included in the fi nal analysis; 16 received plerixafor/G-CSF, 198 received CY/G-CSF, and 75 received G-CSF alone. Results: The median number of collected stem cells was 7.95 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + /kg in plerixafor/G-CSF group, 7.7 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + /kg in Cy/G-CSF group and 4.5 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + /kg in G-CSF alone group. The median number of apheresis days was 2 days, 2 days and 4 days respectively. The percentage of the patients who collected \u2265 6 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + /kg in < 3 apheresis was 63%, 62% and 19% respectively. The number of the patients who collected \u2265 6 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + /kg and weight > 70 kg was 77% in the plerixafor/G-CSF group, 77% in Cy/G-CSF group and 47% in G-CSF alone group. For patients < 70 kg collection > 6 \u00d7 10 6 was 100%, 50% and 67% respectively. The median number of collected stem cells in the patients who received Len/Dex initial therapy and mobilized with plerixafor/G-CSF or CY/G-CSF was high at 8.5 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + /kg. Conclusion: This analysis suggests that plerixafor/G-CSF and CY/G-CSF mobilization result in similar and adequate stem cell numbers for ASCT in MM patients. Both approaches are superior to G-CSF alone. Body weight may play a role in the selection of the mobilization regimen. Plerixafor and CY with G-CSF are effective regimens for stem cell mobilization in MM regardless of prior expose to lenalidomide.",

There were 79 Males and 51 Females with a median age of 56.8 years (34-72) . At diagnosis there were 71 IgG (49k, 22L), 26 IgA (15K,11L), 2 IgD (1K, 1L), 27 light chain (18K, 9L), 2 plasma cell leukemia and 2 nonsecretory. There were 11 patients in stage I (10A and 1B), 12 IIA, 96 III (75A and 21B) and 11 not classifi ed. At diagnosis, 24 patients had del (13), and 65 had high levels of Beta2 microglobulin. The median interval between diagnosis and ASCT was 7.8 months (3.5-131) . Before transplantation, all patients received G-CSF 5 microg/ kg/day, PBSC were mobilized in steady state in 135 cases, 62 after G-CSF + cyclo. As conditioning, all pts received Melphalan alone. Sixty six patients received a single ASCT and 64 patients received 2 ASCT in a double ASCT program. After transplantation, there were 2 graft failure, 40% of patients received red blood cell transfusions, and 64% received platelet transfusions. The median number of days with neutrophils < 0.5G/L was 6 (0-33) and with platelets < 20G/L was 17 (2-104). The median length of hospitalization for auto transplantation was 18 days (14-54). To assess the impact of the infused CD34 + cells number, we have analyzed 2 groups: group 1 (n = 86) for ASCT with a number of CD34 + \u2264 3 \u00d7 10 6 /kg and group 2 (n = 107) for ASCT with a number of CD34 + > 3 \u00d7 10 6 /kg. For cost analysis, data were collected regarding the mobilisation and harvest of PBSC, and the graft period until hospital discharge. Results: We found a high signifi cant impact of the high number of infused CD34 + (group 2) on platelets recovery ( Conclusion: High level of infused CD34 + appeared to be very optimal for hematological recovery after ATSC in MM, without any signifi cant impact on O.S. and PFS. Our study showed that a high number of CD34 + cells number had an important economical impact including a total cost saving of 1500 euros (P = 0.03).",

Pts previously received either VAD or VD as induction treatment followed by Melphalan 200 mg/m 2 . Pts must have an HLA identical donor either from siblings or unrelated 10/10 HLA donors, and at least one of the following poor prognostic factors (PPF): beta2 microglobulin > 3 mg/L, Del 13, t(4;14) and Del 17p. The conditioning regimen combined Fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 /d (d-5, d-1), Busilvex IV 3.2 mg/kg/d (d-4, d-3) and ATG 2,5 mg/kg/d (d-2, d-1). By day 90 post-allograft, pts not in CR received 4 cycles of Velcade 1.3 mg/kg, and after Velcade, if the CR was not achieved, increasing doses of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) were administered. This analysis included 11 pts, 9 males and 2 females of median age 46 years [40-60], there were 8 IgG stageA (7kappa & 1Lambda) and 3 IgA (1 kappa stage B & 2 lambda stage A). There were 3 pts with 1 PPF, 5 pts with 2 PPF and 3 pts with 3 PPF. Results: Seven pts received 4 cycles of VAD (4 pts VAD + DCEP), 1 patient received 4 cycles of Velcade + dex. and 3 pts received other combinations (1PAD, 2VAD then Velcade). After induction, 7 pts were in PR and 4 in stable disease. Pts received auto-HSCT after a median time of 6.6 months [4.5-8.7 ] from diagnosis. All pts were in PR after auto-HSCT and before allo-PBSCT. The median number of infused CD34 + cells was 6.5 \u00d7 10 6 /kg [2.6-13.7 ] from 4 identical siblings and 7 matched unrelated donors. Sex matching was: F..M: 4, F..F:1, M..F: 1 and M..M: 5. At D90, 3 pts were in CR and 8 pts received Velcade after absence of CR (2 VGPR and 6 PR). After Velcade, the 2 VGPR evolved to CR and pts in PR became 1 CR, 1 VGPR and 4 remained in PR). One patient in VGPR and 3 in PR received DLI after Velcade, responses were: 1 VGPR and 3 pts progressed. There were 6 acute GVHD (5 grade II and 1 grade III) and 6 chronic GVHD (5 limited and 1 extensive), all GVHD were resolved at the last follow-up. After a median follow-up of 30 months, all pts are alive, 3 pts are in CR, 3 in VGPR, 4 in PR and one in relapse without any active chronic GVHD even after DLI administration. Conclusion: According to these very promising results, we should reconsider the allo-HSCT as a fi rst line treatment for MM especially for pts with PPF using either RIC or standard conditioning depending on age.",

More recently, non-myeloablative (NMA) and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) for allogeneic HSCT was introduced. A prerequisite for this approach is a signifi cant graft-versus-myeloma effect, which has not clearly been demonstrated. Between 1997 and 2005, 177 patients were reported to the CIBMTR following NMA (n = 120) or RIC (n = 57) and an allogeneic HSCT from an HLA-identical sibling donor. Median age was 50 years (range 24-69). Planned tandem autologous transplant followed by allogeneic HSCT was given to 105 of these patients. Most patients were given peripheral blood stem cells (98%). Outcomes, with a median follow-up of 55 months (range 3-98) and 25 months (range 3-76) respectively for allogeneic HSCT and autologous transplant followed by allogeneic HSCT, see Table. The following variables were signifi cant in univariate outcomes analyses and were therefore used in the multivariate modelling: age, sex, performance status, IgG vs. non IgG myeloma, disease status and chemosensitivity, prior lines of chemotherapy, donor-recipient sex match, NMA vs. RIC, year of transplant and GVHD as the time dependent covariate. The only factor on multivariate analysis that increased the risk of TRM was acute GVHD (RR 2.38, P = 0.018). Only chronic GVHD decreased the probability of relapse on multivariate (RR 0.43, P = 0.012), but this effect was not seen in patients with IgG myeloma (n = 97, RR 0.7, P = 0.3) in comparison to all other types of myeloma (n = 80, RR 0.11, P = 0.004). Improved PFS was associated with autologous + allogeneic HSCT (RR 3.6, P = 0.001) and absence of acute GVHD (P = 0.001), but not chronic GVHD (RR 0.9, P = 0.7).",

            "text": "Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) with myeloablative conditioning is potentially curative therapy for multiple myeloma (MM) but is associated with excessively high rates of nonrelapse mortality (NRM). Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allows reduction of NRM but relapse rate is increased. The role and timing of allogeneic SCT during the disease course are controversial. There is only limited data on the long-term outcome of RIC in the relapsing/ refractory setting. We retrospective analyzed SCT outcomes in 50 patients (pts) given RIC for relapsing/ refractory MM between the years 2000-2004 from related (n = 27) or unrelated (n = 23) donors. The median age was 53 years (32-64). This was a relatively heavily pretreated group, a median of 3 years from diagnosis (0. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Fortyseven pts failed one (n = 31) or two (n = 16) prior autologous SCT. Thirty pts were in PR (n = 26) or CR (n = 4) at the time of SCT and 20 pts had stable or progressive disease. RIC consisted of fl udarabine and melphalan (100-140 mg/m 2 ). Disease response was assessed at day + 100; 23 pts achieved CR; 17 PR, 7 died and 3 have already progressed by day + 100. With median follow-up of 6.4 years (5-7.9 years), 16 pts are alive and 34 have died; 13 had NRM (cumulative incidence 26%) and 21 died of relapse. The median survival is 2.3 years and the estimated 7-year overall and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 34% (95 C.I. 21-47%) and 26% (95 C.I. 14-38%), respectively. The PFS curve showed an apparent plateau after 3 years, with no later relapses, suggesting potential cure. In multivariate analysis, adverse prognostic factors for survival included SCT not in remission, long duration of disease and SCT from a female donor to a male recipient. Related and unrelated donor SCT had similar outcome. The 7 year PFS in 19 pts with none of these adverse factors was 47%. Chronic GVHD and achievement of CR after SCT were associated with improved outcome. In conclusion, allogeneic SCT can result in long-term PFS in a subset of MM pts failing prior therapy and should be considered early after failure and preferably after achieving a response with salvage therapy. The treatment goal is to achieve CR as this is associated with better outcome. Relapsing disease is still the major cause of treatment failure. Additional strategies, such as maintenance therapy with novel agents or judicious use of donor lymphocyte infusions merit further investigation for converting PR to CR and reducing relapse risk.",

Thalidomide was continued till progression. Thirty-six pts have been enrolled. Median age is 55 years (29-66). Median time from dx is 7.5 mo. (4.2-145) . Disease stage: Salmon-Durie 1/II/III 1/6/28 and ISS I/II/III 16/11/7. Induction treatment included thal/dex (14), velcade based (19) and revlimid based regimens (9). Median B2M at enrollment is 1.7 mg/L (1.05-1090). Disease status at enrollment; CR (9), VGPR (10), PR (14), SD (1). Four pts had ch 13 del. Results: Thirty-three pts have undergone transplant. Four pts were unable to start maintenance therapy due to grade II neuro toxicities and thrombocytopenia. Twenty-four pts started maintenance vel/dex within 4-8 weeks of PSCT. Eleven pts have completed 6 months of vel/dex. Two pts stopped vel/dex because of low WBC (1) or PN (1). With a median F/U of 5.2 mo. (1.2-17.3) nine of 27 evaluable pts (33%) have achieved CR post PSCT and six out of 11 evaluable pts (55%) have achieved CR after vel/dex. Two out of 11 pts (18%) have upgraded their response with vel/dex. Four pts have completed 6 month of thal/dex and are beyond 1 year post PSCT. Two out of 4 pts remain in CR at one year post PSCT. One pt is in PR and 1 pt has progressed. Two pts could not complete thal/dex phase of therapy because of relapse (1) and grade III GI toxicity (1). Three pts have relapsed of whom 2 died of relapsed myeloma (leptomeningeal disease 1 pt). One pt experienced MI while receiving velcade (grade IV). Grade III toxicities have occurred in 7 pts; low platelet (1), asthenia (1), mood alteration (1), ileus (1), skin rash (1). Ten pts had PN grade I at enrollment. Only 3 pts have developed PN on the study and all are grade I-II. Conclusion: Prolonged sequential velcade/thalidomide/dexamethasone maintenance therapy post single autologous PSCT is well tolerated with no severe peripheral neuropathy. Fifty-fi ve percent of pts have achieved CR and 18% have upgraded their response after six months of velcade/dexamethasone therapy suggesting this is an active and well tolerated maintenance strategy post PSCT.",

Bokemeyer, N. Kr\u00f6ger University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (Hamburg, DE) Background: Due to the persistence of marrow-residing myeloma stem cells, most patients with multiple myeloma (MM) will eventually relapse and succumb to their disease even after intensive therapy. Therefore, treatment strategies incorporating new therapeutic targets which are expressed by end-stage myeloma cells and their dormant progenitors are needed. Methods: We screened myeloma cell lines for the presence of immunoreceptors and verifi ed expression of potential targets on cell lines and patient samples. Protein function was evaluated using gene knockdown and usefulness as target for antibody therapies was investigated using in vitro cytotoxicity assays. Results: Of all immunoreceptors analyzed, SLAM family member CD229 showed the strongest expression and was also expressed on myeloma precursors and on primary plasma cells from myeloma patients while it was absent from most healthy human tissues. Analyses of CD229 expression facilitated fl ow cytometric detection of myeloma cells within bone marrow. CD229 seemed to promote survival of myeloma cells while CD229 silencing increased their susceptibility towards chemotherapy. Importantly, targeting CD229 with a monoclonal antibody resulted in lysis of the tumor cells through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity as well as complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Conclusions: Taken together, these results indicate that CD229 might represent an attractive diagnostic and therapeutic target for the treatment of MM.",

Jackson, K. Kirkland, J. Lee, R. Pearce, D. Marks, A. Pagliuca on behalf of the BSBMT Introduction: High dose chemotherapy supported with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in multiple myeloma (MM) is standard fi rst line consolidative therapy. We performed a national outcome analysis in years 1999 and 2005 in order to assess the potential impact of improvements in supportive care and induction therapy. Patients and methods: Patients with MM who underwent a single ASCT in 1999 and 2005 were identifi ed from the BSBMT (n = 211 and n = 453) and EBMT (n = 1311 and n = 1978) database as eligible for this analysis. All patient and disease-related variables were collected using available MED A data. Results: In the BSBMT cohort, a trend to more CRs post-ASCT were reported in 1999 compared with 2005 (53% vs. 46%, P = 0.14) though an improved conversion to CR post-ASCT (34% vs. 24%, P = 0.013), especially PR_CR (47% vs. 34%, P = 0.016) was noted. With a median follow-up of 8.7 years (range 0.7, 9.9 Conclusion: An improvement in supportive care resulting in reduced NRM is evident between the decades, both in the UK and EU. The main cause of treatment failure was disease progression, more signifi cantly in 2005 than 1999. The similarity of OS between the years refl ects the introduction of novel agents in salvage therapy. The reduced PFS in 2005 is as yet unexplained and warrants further investigation.",

Rezvani Imperial College NHS Trust (London, UK) Myeloma is incurable with median survival of 3-4 yrs. All patients relapse after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), S149 with a median event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of 2.5-4 and 4-5 yrs respectively. Allogeneic SCT can be curative due to graft-v-myeloma effect but applicability is limited by high transplant related mortality. Identifi cation of independent biological predictors of outcome is required to tailor therapy. Natural killer cells provide defence against tumors and kill allogeneic and autologous myeloma cells in vitro. We investigated the impact of KIR genotype on EFS and OS after ASCT. On univariate analysis of 190 patients post-ASCT factors associated with shorter EFS were haplotype Bx (P = 0.036), \u2265 3 activating KIRs (P = 0.046) and presence of activating KIR genes 2DS1 and 3DS1 (P = 0.045 and 0.01). Disease status at ASCT was the most predictive factor for EFS. In good risk patients (CR/PR at ASCT) KIR3DS1 + status was associated with signifi cantly shorter EFS, 464d vs. 731d (P = 0.003) and OS 807d vs. 967 (P = 0.023) but not in poor risk (refractory or relapsed) patients (P = 0.36). Median EFS for KIR3DS1 + good risk patients was not signifi cantly different to those with poor risk disease (P = 0.061). Patients were stratifi ed by KIR3DS1 and disease status into 3 groups; A: Good Risk KIR3DS1 -ve; B: Good Risk KIRDS1 + ve; and C: Poor risk (KIR3DS1 + or -ve), RR of relapse or death was 1.0, 1.9 (P = 0.002) and 3.0 (P = 0.0001) respectively. Adjusting for cytogenetics, serum albumin and beta 2m, this association remained highly significant for poor EFS, RR of 1.0, 2.7 (P = 0.021) and 5.3 (P < 0.0001) respectively. The association between KIR3DS1 and EFS was most signifi cant in patients without HLA-Bw4, the ligand for the corresponding inhibitory KIR3DL1. KIR3DS1 + 3DL1 + Bw4-ve patients had signifi cantly shorter median EFS of 400d vs. 615 (P = 0.048). Again this was most striking in good risk patients: 3DS1 + DL1 + Bw4-patients had signifi cantly shorter EFS survival of 372d cf. 3DS1 + 3DL1 + Bw4 + patients (509d) and KIR3DS1-ve patients (793d) (P = 0.004). Our data suggest KIR3DS1, a gene linked to increased risk of progression to invasive cervical carcinoma, independently predicts for poor EFS and OS post ASCT. Of those patients defi ned as good risk, 30% are KIR3DS1 + ve and their EFS is not signifi cantly different from those with refractory/relapsed disease, this is augmented by absence of HLA-Bw4. The mechanisms for our fi ndings are unclear and functional studies are underway.",

Frattini, S. Ledro, C. Perbellini, D. de Sabata, G. Quaresmini, F. Benedetti Bone Marrow Transplant Unit (Verona, IT) Introduction: The standard therapy in pts with Myeloma aged <65 years was, in the last years, VAD or VAD-like regimens followed by high dose Cyclophosphamide (Cy) and Alkeran (L-PAM) with support of peripheral stem cells (PBSC). Thalidomide (Thali) has showed considerable activity, but Its effi cacy as maintenance therapy is still under investigation. Patients and methods: We considered a conventional CT (3 cycles of VAD or VAD-like regimen), high dose Cy (7 g/m 2 i.v.) and PBSC harvest, followed by single (55 pts) or tandem (71 pts, when disease still present) high dose L-PAM (200 mg/ m 2 i.v.) with rescue of PBSC (CD34 + >4 \u00d7 10 6 /Kg). All pts were in stage II/III, according to Durie and Salmon. From October 1999 Thali (100 mg/die) was given to all pts regardless the response and discontinued at the time of relapse or progression or because of toxicities. No anti-thrombotic prophylaxis was administered. Between October 1990 and February 2008, 135 consecutive pts were treated, 129 valuable, median age 55 (33-66), male/female 68/61, M component IgG/IgA/IgD/monoclonal light chain and non-secretory MM were 74/30/6/15 and 3, respectively. All pts completed induction and high dose CT. One toxic death occurred. Thali (100 mg/day) was started within 3 months from transplant in 79 pts; in 35 cases Thali could not be administered because of refusal (4), progression disease (9), allergic reactions (3) or neurological toxicities (6); 16/35 pts were enrolled before 1999, when Thali was not available yet. Results: At transplant, 26/129 (20%) were in very good partial remission or better (VGPR + CR according to EBMT criteria), further 43 pts (33%) reached the CR after the fi rst transplant, for a total of 69/129 CR (53%). We compared the number of responses (VGPR + CR), the treatment-free interval (TFI) and overall survival (OS) between the Thali group of pts (70 pts) and No-Thali group of pts (35 pts). The VGPR + CR rate was 69% (48/70) in the Thali-group versus 45% (16/35) in the remaining pts. With Thali we obtained further 6 CR + VGPR. Comparing the 2 groups, the TFI was 47 and 22 months (P = 0,002), the OS was 70 and 57 months, respectively (P = ns). No thrombotic events occurred. Conclusions: Low dose Thali following single or tandem autotransplant appears to be a safe and feasible treatment not only as maintenance, but also as consolidation therapy, improving the rate of response (VGPR + CR), delaying the need of subsequent therapy, without improving the OS, with an acceptable toxicity.",

One attempt to improve outcome is to use more effective induction regimens in order to improve overall response rates. Patients and methods: We analyzed the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib combined with doxorubicine and dexamethasone (PAD) as fi rst line treatment followed by ASCT in 39 newly diagnosed myeloma patients (M/F: 20/19; median age: 59, range 37-74; IgG, IgA, Light chain, others: 24/6/4/5; kappa/lambda: 24/15). Results: After 4 cycles of PAD the overall response rate was 74.4% (CR/near CR 35.9%). All but 2 patients underwent successful stem cell mobilisation with a mean of 8.8 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg. In 33 evaluable patients, the overall response rate 3 months after ASCT was 81.8% (CR/nCR 69.7%). ASCT after induction therapy with PAD was able to improve the overall response rate from 74% to 82% and the nCR rate from 28% to 58%. After a median followup of 28 months, the OS and PFS for the entire group was 88% and 69%, respectively. Median OS has not been reached and the median PFS is 32 months. Cytogenetic poor prognosis parameters did not signifi cantly infl uence survival endpoints. Achievement of CR/nCR was associated with a longer PFS. Conclusion: We conclude that PAD followed by ASCT is an effective fi rst line treatment in newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma.",

Mobilization: Hi-dose cyclophosphamide in 8 and IVE (ifosphamide + etoposide + epirubicin) in 12 pts + GCSF. Stem cell collection yield was effective in all pts (m = 17.6 (1.9 -44.7) \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg). Disease stage at AHSCT: CR n = 6, VGPR n = 2, PR n = 12. Results: Renal function measured before AHCT signifi cantly improved due to MM treatment compared to that at dgn, P = 0.008. CKD stage before AHCT equaled 1-4 (m = 2). Conditioning -melphalan (75-200 mg/m 2 ) was well tolerated. The median of transplanted cells were: NC 2.5 (1-7.6 ) \u00d7 10 8 /kg; CD34 + 7.9 (0.8-21.7) \u00d7 10 6 /kg. All patients engrafted.

No renal complications were observed. On the contrary creatinine clearance after transplantation showed trend towards further improvement compared to that before AHCT, P = 0.07. The probability of OS,PFS for studied group of pts. were 84% and 63%, respectively. Median observation time 2,5 years (0,1-12,5). Conclusions: Our observation demonstrates that AHCT is an effective and well tolerated option for MM patients with mild or moderate renal insuffi ciency. Treatment before transplantation and also high-dose chemotherapy followed by AHCT may even improve renal function. No relationship between CKD and stem cell collection yield, engraftment or severity of post-transplant complications was observed in this group of patients.",

Ematologia (Cosenza, IT) High-dose melphalan (HDM) followed by autologous hematopoitic progenitor cell (HPC) support is widely used as intensifi cation treatment in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) responsive to the initial chemotherapy. However, there is growing evidence that only the subset of patients who achieve complete remission (CR) actually benefi t from this approach. In our bone marrow unit, in the last 12 years, 152 patients with Durie-Salmon stage II-III MM, were intended to undergo two sequential cycles of myeloablative chemotherapy with autologous hemopoietic stem cells (HPC) transplantation after response to primary chemotherapy. Treatment program based on 3 cycles VAD followed by Cyclophosphamide 3-4 gr/mq for HPC collection. The preparative regimen was high-dose melphalan (HDM) 200 mg/mq for the fi rst and second transplant with a three-four months interval. 63 patients uderwant a single HDM and 89 a tandem HDM. The median follow up is 34 months (range 1-136). The overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival was 51 and 38 months, respectively. PFS and OS at 8 years was 32% and 45%, respectively. On an intent-to-treat basis, the OS and PFS was signifi cantly higher in patients that underwant a tandem transplant (P = 0.0014 and P = 0.0001, respectively) and with a better response (compete remission/near complete remission) after the fi rst transplant (P = 0.002, P = 0.02, respectively). The Cox analysis confi rmed a signifi cant association among the best response and clinical results. Our retrospective analysis show that that CR/nCR achievement is crucial for longlasting response and prolonged survival after HDM and transplant. The use of the second HDM in the patients in CR/nCR remains of doubtful utility.",

Lee, X. Zhang, C. Diong, Y. Lee, G. Kam, A. Ang, R. Yiu, Y. Linn, M. Koh, Y.T. Goh, W. Hwang Singapore General Hospital (Singapore, SG) Introduction: Multiple myeloma (MM) is clinically heterogeneous and risk stratifi cation is vital for prognostication. We evaluate the pre-transplant characteristics and the eventual post-transplant response on the survival outcomes of patients (pts) who underwent high dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation (HDT/ASCT) at our centre. We sought to identify important prognostic factors that may predict clinical outcomes in the era of novel therapies. Methods: Seventy-four newly diagnosed MM pts were enrolled to our HDT/ASCT programme from 2000 to 2008. Patient and disease characteristics including age, cytogenetics, international staging system (ISS), induction therapy, bortezomib exposure and the eventual post-transplant response were evaluated. Pts received VAD chemotherapy and thalidomide/ dexamethasone (TD) as induction before and after June 2004 respectively. Bortezomib was available for treatment of relapsed MM and induction treatment of high-risk MM from Oct 2004. After induction, all pts received cyclophosphamide 4 g/m 2 as mobilization followed by peripheral blood stem-cell (PBSC) collection prompted by G-CSF. HDT/ASCT entailed conditioning with melphalan 200 mg/m 2 within 1.5 years of diagnosis. Response was defi ned according to IMWG criteria. Results: The median age of all pts was 53 years. 30%, 53% and 17% of patients presented with ISS stages I, II and III respectively. Metaphase cytogenetics detected abnormalities in 51% of pts (hypodiploidy [13%], hyperdiploidy [25%], pseudodiploidy [6%] and near tetradiploidy [3%]). Interphase FISH results were available for 32 pts, of which 25% showed highrisk disease. 60% of pts received VAD induction, while 23% and 17% received TD and bortezomib-based induction respectively. Overall, 45% of pts have been exposed to bortezomib. The ISS and metaphase cytogenetics were discerning of the overall survival (OS) and progression free survival where the medians were 8.7 and 3.5 years respectively. Attainment of at least a very good partial response (\u2265 VGPR) was associated with a trend for longer OS and PFS. On Cox regression multivariate analysis, the presence of a non-hyperdiploid karyotype emerged as the single most adverse prognostic indicator after HDT/ASCT (median OS 2.8 years, P = 0.001). Conclusion: Our study suggests that while HDT/ASCT and achievement of \u2265 VGPR may prolong the OS of transplant eligible pts, it is still unable to overcome adverse cytogenetics detected on conventional metaphase karyotyping.",

Sucak Gazi University Medical School (Ankara, TR) Objectives: Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) improves complete response (CR) rates, prolongs overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). There are several prognostic factors used in estimating the clinical course. Free light chain (FLC) level and FLC ratio have been showed as new prognostic markers in newly diagnosed MM patients. However the signifi cance of FLC is unknown yet at pre ASCT setting in MM patients. We hypothesized that pre ASCT FLC levels and FLC ratios may be helpful in predicting transplantation outcome. Methods: We evaluated 51 ASCT in 47 MM patients [31 male and 16 female, median age 54 (28-68) years]. Serum levels of kappa and lambda FLC were measured by the Freelite Binding system at pre-ASCT. Subgroup analysis was performed after excluding patients (n = 13) who were in CR both pre-ASCT and at day + 90 post-ASCT were excluded, the remaining patients were divided into two groups according to disease status at day + 90. Group I (n = 18) had improved disease compared to pre-transplantation status and group II (n = 20) consisted of patients without any improvement or with progression at day + 90. Patients were followed after ASCT at a median 14.9 (3.0-48.2) months. Results: OS and PFS were calculated as%76.3 and%30.4, respectively. High levels of FLC before ASCT was found to be associated with shorter PFS (%17.4 vs. %83.3, P < 0.05) in patients with CR, however without any relation to OS (P > 0. 05) in all patients. PFS was better in patients in group I than group II (%54.3 vs. %8.7, P < 0.05). Among patients with normal pre-ASCT FLC ratio, signifi cantly higher number of patients were in group I at day + 90 (P < 0.05). Conclusion: FLC level and FLC ratio measured prior to ASCT might help to predict PFS and the disease status at day + 90 in MM patients providing a more rapid determination of response to ASCT. In the light of these data treatment modalities such as post transplantation maintenance with new generation antimyeloma agents and/or a tandem autologous or allogeneic transplantation might be considered earlier in patients who seem to in the less favourable subgroup with respect to pretransplantation light chain status.

Maly Teaching Hospital (Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9, CZ) Thalidomide-containing regimens are currently being used as standard initial therapy for patients (pts) with multiple myeloma. Recent clinical trials have indicated that Thalidomide -based combinations are associated with improvement of response and survival in newly diagnosed pts. The subsequent successful autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is depended on suffi cient harvest of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). The aim of this report is to compare the PBSC harvest after two different induction regimens: Thalidomide -based regimen -cyclophosphamide, thalidomide and dexamethasone (CTD) versus Adriamycine -based regimens (VAD or AD). Patients and methods: We retrospectively analysed data of 42 pts with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma eligible for ASCT. 21 pts (median age 59, range 33-68 years) were treated with CTD and 21 pts (median age 58, range 48-65) with VAD or AD. Cyclophosphamide 2,5 g/m 2 plus G-CSF was used as mobilisation regimen in both groups. We evaluated total number of CD 34 + cells/kg, number of apheresis days, number of pts who achieved target number of 5 \u00d7 10 6 CD 34 + cells/kg. Results: We analysed 23 mobilisation cycles in CTD group (2 pts were mobilized twice because of insuffi cient fi rst harvest), 21 cycles in VAD group. Average number of apheresis days was 3,82 (median 2-5) versus 2,1 days (1-5 days). Total number of CD 34 + cells/kg in CTD group was 5,74 \u00d7 10 6 CD 34 + cells/kg (0,99-15,9) vs. 9,24 \u00d7 106 CD 34 + cell/kg in VAD group (0, [26] [27] [28] [29] 12) , average number of CD 34 + cells per one apheresis was 1,5 (0,08-9,55) vs . 4,21 (0,04-17,87 ) CD 34 + cells/kg. In CTD group there were more aheresis days needed to reach target number of CD 34 + cells/kg -82% pts needed 3 and more apheresis in contrast to second group -only 28% pts needed 3 and more apheresis days. Target number of CD 34 + cells/kg (5 \u00d7 10 6 ) was achieved in 61% of pts in CTD group and 90,4% of pts in VAD group. 6 pts in CTD group achieved less than 2 \u00d7 10 6 CD 34 + cells/kg vs. only 1 pt in VAD group. 3 pts from CTD group were satisfactory mobilized after subsequent mobilisation regimen with plerixafor. Conclusion: These results suggest that adding Thalidomide could infl uence the results of PBSC harvest before ASCT, but we analysed only small group of patiens, so that these observations should be tested in appropriately designed trial with larger patient cohort.",

Bianchi-Melacrino-Morelli (Reggio Calabria, IT) There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that early lymphocyte reconstitution following autologous (ASCT) is a good independent prognostic indicator of clinical outcomes for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) and Multiple Myeloma (MM). In particular, Porrata et al. (Biol Blood Marrow Transpl 2008) , confi rmed in a prospective cohort study the role of day 15 absolute lymphocyte count (ALC-15) on survival and identifi ed NK cells as the key ALC-15 lymphocyte subset affecting survival after ASCT. Several strategies to enhance early immune reconstitution have been developed in preclinical models but few have made it into clinical trials. In this study, we prospectively evaluated the hypothesis that ALC-15 and absolute NK cell count at day 15 (NK-15) is directly dependent upon the dose of infused CD34 + in the peripheral blood autograft. The study primary end-points were to achieve ALC-15 > 500 cell/\u03bcl and NK-15 > 80 cell/\u03bcl in NHL or MM patients (pts) underwent PBPC autografting with the intent to receive > 6 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + /Kg. The target CD34 + dose was achieved in 13 of 23 NHL and in 12 of 26 MM pts. For data analysis, the pts were divided into four groups, two for each disease, according to the target dose of CD34 + cells (median number of cells infused was: 7. 4 and 5.4 in LNH; 7.2 and 5 in MM). Five of 12 (42%) MM pts reinfused with > 6 \u00d7 10 6 / CD34 + cells/Kg achieved the end-point for ALC-15, while 5 pts (42%) obtained the end-point for NK-15. Of 14 MM receiving lower than the target dose of CD34 + cells, 6 (43%) and 6 pts (43%) achieved the fi rst and second end-point, respectively. Of 13 LNH pts infused with CD34 + cells > 6 \u00d7 10 6 /Kg, 5 (38%) obtained the end-point for ALC-15 and 5 (38%) achieved the NK-15 end-point. Signifi cantly, only one patient achieved the fi rst and only one the second end-point among the pts who received an amount of CD34 + cells less than the target. In conclusion, we found that dose of CD34 + cells had no impact on early immunological recovery in MM. However, it is important to note that our MM pts received in any case more than 4 \u00d7 10 6 /CD34 + cells/Kg. On the contrary, our data suggest that immunological recovery in early post-transplant is directly dependent upon the dose of infused CD34 + cells in NHL pts.",

Fenk, V. Liese, I. Bruns, M. Kondakci, S. Balleisen, C. Saure, T. Schroeder, R. Haas, G. Kobbe Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf (Dusseldorf, DE) There is some controversy about the number of transplants to be utilized during fi rst line therapy of MM. For patients who relapse after the 1st HD-T a 2nd transplant may be a valuable treatment option. There is no data whether HD-M still is the best conditioning regimen for the salvage situation. We therefore retrospectively compared toxicity and effi cacy of 3 different conditioning regimens in patients with relapsed or refractory MM. From 1997 to 2007 we treated fi fty-fi ve patients with relapsed or refractory MM with a salvage HD-T followed by aPBPCT. All patients had previously received HD-M and aPBPCT as 1st line therapy. In addition 69% of patients had received thalidomide and 27% bortezomib. Time from diagnosis to second HD-T was 45 months, median number of prior treatment lines was 2 (range 1-6) and age was 56 years (median, range 42-69). Forty-three percent of patients were refractory to their last treatment before second HD-T, whereas 57% relapsed with previous remission duration of 21 months (range 0-71). A re-induction treatment was attempted before 2nd HD-T and included chemotherapy, bortezomib and IMID-based regimens in 56%, 40% and 22%. Conditioning regimens for salvage HD-T were classical HD-M (Mel200, 27%), HD-BuMel (Bu12Mel140, 38%) and bortezomib-HD-M (Bortezomib 1,3 mg/m 2 with Mel200, 35%). Toxicity of the 3 conditioning regimens was acceptable. TRM was 5% with all deaths occuring with standard Mel200. Responses were: CR 9%, vgPR 9%, PR, 57%, MR + SD 11%, PD 4%, not assessable 5%. No signifi cant differences were noted in terms of response, EFS or OS according to the type of conditioning regimen used. Univariate analysis revealed a long remission duration after the 1st HD-T, platelet count > 140 \u00d7 10E9/l and CR/PR after 2nd HD-T as favourable prognostic factors for EFS and OS, as well as age > 60years for OS. In multivariate analysis remission duration shorter than 12 months after 1st HD-T was the only adverse prognostic factor for EFS (0.002) and OS (0.004). Subgroup analysis identifi ed 3 patient groups with different long term prognosis based on the remission duration after the 1st HD-T (Table 1) . Salvage HD-T is an effective treatment for patients who had remission duration > 1 year after 1st HD-T. BuMel and BorMel are alternative conditioning regimens yielding similar results like HD-Mel in a retrospective single centre analysis. Prospective studies are needed to identify the best regimen for salvage HD-T in relapsed and refractory MM.",

Legiec, A. Dmoszynska Medical University of Lublin (Lublin, PL) Introduction: The autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a standard therapy for patients (pts) with multiple myeloma (MM). The most frequent mobilization regimen in these pts is cyclophosphamide with G-CSF (CY). In 10-20% pts with initial mobilization failure different remobilization schemes are applied: etoposide + G-CSF (ETO), cytarabine + G-CSF (Ara-C) or plerixafor + G-CSF. Patients and methods: In our Department CY (4 g/m 2 ) is a standard regimen for fi rst-line mobilization in MM pts. ETO (1.6 g/m 2 ) and Ara-C (2.4 g/m 2 ) are applied in remobilization and in fi rst-line of mobilization in heavily pretreated pts (> than 2 line of chemotherapy). Pts with refractory, active disease are collected after EDAP regimen. The dose of G-CSF is 5-10 mcg/kg. Results: We analyzed clinical and laboratory data of 80 pts (48 female and 32 male; mean age 54 years) with MM who underwent 108 haematopoietic stem cell mobilization during last 5 years. Before mobilization pts received median number 2.4 of lines chemotherapy (range: 1-5), 17.5% of them radiotherapy, 58.3% thalidomide and 21.2% bortezomibe therapy. There were 80 (74%) fi rst mobilization (CY 50, ETO 24, EDAP 6) and 28 (26%) remobilization (ETO 24, Ara-C 4) in pts who not achieved 2 \u00d7 10 6 /kg CD34 + cells after CY regimen and in pts with relapse after transplantation. The median CD34 + yield in the whole group was 9.2 \u00d7 10 6 /kg (range: 0.6-30.0) in a median of 1.4 (range: 1-4) aphereses. There was no difference in median CD34 + yield after CY, ETO, Ara-C and EDAP (8.1; 10.2; 9.9 and 10.5 \u00d7 10 6 /kg, respectively). The failure rate after CY was 4% (2 pts), after ETO in fi rst-line 0%, in remobilization 4% (1 pt), after Ara-C 25% (1 pt) and after EDAP 0%. Finally, only 2/80 pts (2.5%) not achieved suffi cient number of stem cells from all collections. Haematologic toxicity after CY, ETO and EDAP regimens was moderate; the most toxic scheme was Ara-C. We did not show the signifi cant infl uence of previous radiotherapy, number of chemotherapy lines, previous treatment with thalidomide and bortezomibe, and remission status on CD34 + cell collection yield. The analysis of post-transplantation engraftment showed no difference in leucocyte recovery and delayed platelet reconstitution after ETO mobilization compared to CY mobilization (P < 0.05), but the ETO group received more lines of previous chemotherapy. Our data showed that qualifi cation to an appropriate mobilization regimen in MM pts might reduce failure rate to 2.5%.",

Dmoszynska Medical University of Lublin (Lublin, PL) Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) treated with conventional chemotherapy have a median survival of approximately 3 years. High dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is now considered as the standard therapy for almost all patients with multiple myeloma. From November 1997 to October 2006, 122 patients with MM (58 females, 64 males, median age 51.0 (range 30-66) years were transplanted in our Department. 47 patients were in CR or in nCR, 66 patients were in PR, 9 was in SD. Among them there were 95 patients with IgG myeloma, 16 with IgA myeloma, 1 with IgG/IgA, 1 with IgM myeloma, 5 with non secretory type, 2 with solitary tumor and 2 with light-chain myeloma. According to Durie-Salmon 62 patients were in stage III of the disease, 46 in stage II and 4 in stage I. 48 patients were transplanted after one line chemotherapy, whereas 69 patients were transplanted after 2 or more lines, 1 patient after surgery and rtg-therapy and 4 patients without prior therapy. In mobilization procedure the patients received a single infusion of cyclophosphamide (4-6 g/m 2 ) or etoposide 1.6 g/m 2 followed by daily administration of G-CSF until the peripheral stem cells harvest. Median of apheresis were 2.0 (1-5) . A median of 7.09 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg were collected (1.8-111 .0 \u00d7 10 6 ). Conditioning regimen consisted of high dose melphalan 60-210 mg/m 2 . A median of 3.04 \u00d7 106 CD34 + cells/kg was transplanted to patient. Fatal complications occurred in 4 patients (treatment related mortality TRM = 3.2%). In all patients regeneration of hematopoiesis was observed. The median time to recovery of ANC > 0,5 G/l was 13 (10-38) days and PLT > 50 G/l was 25 (12-45) days. Median time of hospitalization was 22 (14-50) days. Patients were evaluated on day 100 after ASCT. 74 .9% of them obtained CR and nCR, 14.3% were in PR, 5.4% of them had SD and 5.4% had progressed. Median of OS was 45 months. OS at 3-year was 84%, at 7-year was 59%. Median of PFS was 25 months. PFS at 3-year was 68%, at 7-year was 43%. At present 52 (42%) patients are still alive. High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation is valuable, well tolerated method of treatment for patients with MM who can obtain long-lasting survival. A. Enrico, J. Milone Hospital Italiano de La Plata (La Plata, AR) Objective: To analize retrospectively the evolution of patients (pts) with MM who underwent ABMT, comparing the results of those who received pretransplant treatment with VAD vs. thalidomide -dexamethasone (THAL -Dexa). Materials and methods: Between January 1991 and August 2009, 180 pts were admitted in our center with MM diagnose. In the 146 evaluated pts, 83 underwent AMBT whereas 63 received treatment without transplant. High doses of melphalan (200 mg/m 2 ) were used as conditioning scheme. The median age of the pts with ABMT was 53 years old (r: 27-68). The fi rst 47 pts transplanted received VAD as induction and the following 15 THAL -Dexa. The features of the pts were similar in both groups median age 51,8 years (r: 27-66) in the VAD group vs. 52. 9 (r: 31-68) in the THAL -Dexa group; male:female 1,2:1 vs. 1.4:1. Stage III A/B 78% vs. 71%. Results: After the induction treatment the (GR) global response (CR + VGPR + PR) was 59.9% with VAD vs. 53% with THAL -dexa; CR 12.7% vs. 13.3%. After ABMT the GR and CR was 83% and 38.3% with VAD vs. 80% and 46.6% with THAL -Dexa respectively. The overall survival (OS) after 5 years is better in transplant group vs. no transplant group 54% vs. 42% (P = 0,05). The transplanted pts who underwent induction with VAD present and OS of 5 years similar to those received THAL -Dexa (53% vs. 50%, P = 0,65). Conclusions: The pts who received high doses melphalan + ABMT showed a greater survival in comparison who didn't received. In our experience THAL -Dexa in induction has not modifi ed the response rates or the evolution post ABMT in comparation with VAD.",

This procedure offers good rates of responses and relapse free survival. Objective: Evaluate the results obtained in our center in terms of transplant related mortality (TRM), relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in a group of patients diagnosed of multiple myeloma in which ASCT was performed. Material and methods: Since the start of our transplant activity nine years ago, ASCT was performed in 23 patients diagnosed of MM,14 men (60,9%) and 9 women (39,1%), with a median of age of 56 years (rank 41-65).The fi rst line therapy consisted of alternating VBCMP/VBAD chemotherapy in 56.52% of the patients, and the rest of patients with VAD and Bortezomib. The conditioning regimen was BUMEL in 7 patient (30,4%) and the remainder with MEL200 (69,6%). The source of stem cells was always of peripheral blood, employing only granulocyte stimulating factor. After the hematopoietic recovery, a therapy of maintenance with interferon and/or prednisone was initiated.",

            "text": "Results: TRM was about 8% (in 2 of the 23 patients). The causes were septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome. We didn't detect statistically signifi cant differences of the TRM due to conditioning regimen (P = 0.52). In 60% of the patients the engraftment was in day + 10 of the procedure. Mucositis was the main adverse event in 31% of the cases. The median of survival was 35 months (rank 13-58). The median of RFS was of 49 months (rank 29-69). At the end of this study 52,2% of the patients continue alive, with a RFS of the 43.06%. When the patients are stratifi ed by time of the transplant (before or after the appearance of new agents), we found statistically signifi cant differences in the OS (18% vs. 83%; P = 0,04) although this differences couldn't be demonstrated in terms of RFS(P = 0,1). Stimated data related to 1yr and 3yr of the procedure show us, OS 81% and 42%; RFS 75% and 43%, respectively. Conclusion: ASCT in the course of myeloma has demonstrating a RFS and OS advantage, as we can see in this study.Our results suggest that in the context of ASCT, the use of the new agents,as Bortezomib, in MM is more complementary than exclusive one of another. They would be able to be considered during the induction and/or ASCT to improve the effi cacy of this procedure because tend to improve natural history of MM. A. Humpe (1) , S. Hengstenberg (1) , J.

Gramatzki (1) (1)Division of Stem Cell and Immunotherapy (Kiel, DE); (2) Institute of Medical Informatics and Statistics (Kiel, DE) Objectives: A decisive parameter for durable engraftment after autologous transplantation of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) is the number of CD34 + cells transfused. Based on measurement of CD34 + cells in the freshly harvested graft a minimally recommended threshold dose for autologous transplantation of HPC of 2 \u00d7 10E + 06 and an optimal dose of \u2265 5 \u00d7 10E + 06 CD34 + cells/kg of body weight were defi ned. This does not consider cell losses during cryopreservation (cryo). We analyzed CD34 + cell doses measured at different time points of HPC processing and engraftment kinetics. Methods: Data were analyzed from autologous patients being transplanted at our centre between January 2004 and December 2007. The CD34 + cell dose was determined according to ISHAGE guidelines at time of harvest (MI), after cryo by analysis of a satellite tube (MII) and by multiplication of the value deduced by MI with the measured viability of CD34 + cells after cryo (MIII). Results: A total of 224 autologous transplantations were performed in the time period and complete data were available for 203 transplantations. Graft failures were not observed. Doses of CD34 + cells derived at MII were signifi cantly lower by a median of 16. 8% when compared to MI or 13.7% at MIII, respectively. According to MI, patients were transplanted with a median number of 6.5 (1.2 -29.4 ) \u00d7 10E + 06 viable CD34 + cells/kg with only 4 patients missing the threshold and 60 the optimal dose. Based on MII data, the median number of transfused viable CD34 + cells was 5.5 (0.65 -26.6 ) \u00d7 10E + 06/kg with an additional 10 patients missing the threshold and an additional 31 patients missing the optimal dose. There were to little cases missing the threshold in MI or MIII for further analysis. Based on MII dosages, engraftment kinetics were signifi cantly better either for patients transplanted with a cell dose above the threshold compared with those missing this value or for patients being transplanted with the optimal dose compared with those missing this number (leukocytes > 1/nl: day + 11 versus + 10). Comparable data were obtained regarding platelet engraftment. Conclusion: Measurement of CD34 + cell numbers after cryo gave signifi cantly lower results compared to those samples evaluated immediately after cell harvest. Apart from other infl uencing factors cell dose measured after cryo may have an effect on engraftment kinetics and should be considered as additional routine quality control before release of HPC products.",

UCB units were selected for transplantation based on total nucleated cell (TNC) content and HLA match between donor and recipient. Results: To date, 16 patients have been transplanted. The male-to-female ratio was 7:1. The median age was 2,5 years (range 4 months -20 years). 10(62,5%) patients had malignant hematological disorders, 6(37,5%) -non-malignant diseases. 2(12,5%) patients have received HLA-identical related UCBT. 1(6,25%) patient has received two UCB units from the related and unrelated donor (8 of 10 alleles matched in both units). 13(81,25%) patients have received unrelated UCBT. 2(12, 5%) patients were fully compatible (10/10), 11(68,75%) cases had one or two mismatches. 2 patients have undergone haploidentical HSC transplantation with co-transplantation of UCB unit. 6(37,5%) patients have received one UCB unit, 3(18,75%)-2 UCB units from one donor, 4(25%)-2 units from different donors, and 3(18,75%)-3 samples (2 UCB units from one donor and the third unit from another donor). The median number of TNC and CD34 + cells infused was 6,0 \u00d7 10 7 /kg (range 0,2-21,5) and 7,7 \u00d7 10 5 /kg (range 0,5-40), accordingly. 9(56,25%) patients showed engraftment. The median time to neutrophil engraftment was 24 days (range 15-36). Partial engraftment was noted in 2(12,5%) cases, 5(31,25%) patients showed no sign of engraftment. Acute GVHD grade I-II was observed in 7(43,75%) patients, there were no cases of severe GVHD. Chronic GVHD was noted in 1(6,25%) patient. The transplantrelated mortality at 100 days was 28,5%. The overall survival was 56,2%, with a median time of observation of 116 days. Conclusions: UCBT has shown encouraging results. The increasing number of banked UCB units will allow using UCB more widely as alternative source of HCS for transplantation. Y. Zalyalov, B. Afanasyev Pavlov State Medical University (St. Petersburg, RU) Objectives: High-dose therapy (HDT) with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) is intended use for treatment of patients with hematology and oncology malignances. In present peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) is the main source of hematopoietic stem sells (HSC) using for transplantation. The outcome of the stem sell transplantation depends on several factors: obtaining an adequate CD34 + sell dose after the leukapheresis procedure, appropriate cryopreservation and thawing methods. The aim of this study is to compare CD34 + sell number in fresh and thawed samples of PBSC from patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Material and methods: A total 70 samples of PBSC were characterized by measuring CD34 + cells number, viability (7-AAD + ) before and after cryopreservation procedure: 17 samples from patients with HL, 18 samples from patients with MM. For CD34 + cells, 7-AAD + cells enumeration FACSCalibur fl ow cytometer with CellQuest Pro Software (Becton Dikinson,USA) was used with triple staining protocol, according to ISHAGE (International Society of Hematotherapy and Graft Engineering) guidelines. Results: Average number of CD34 + in fresh and thawed sample is summarized in Table. In fresh PBSC samples from patients with MM the CD34 + number was not differ from patients with HL (P = 0,19). However, in thawed PBSC samples the number of CD34 + cells was reliably higher in patients with MM than in patients with HL (P = 0,05). According to this study cryopreservation of PBSC resulted more loss of CD34 + cells in patients with HL than with MM: 31,7% and 21% respectively. Difference in CD34 + loss is statistically correlated: P = 0,03. S155 Conclusions: PBSC harvested from patients with MM shows more stability during the freeze/thaw procedure.",

One of the aims of the NHS Cord Blood Bank (NHS-CBB) when established in 1997 was to maximize the banking of cord blood units (CBUs) from ethnic minority (EM) donors. We present the results of 12 years of banking experience and the clinical outcomes of the units issued for single transplants, with particular reference to those issued to ethnic minority patients. As of December 31 2008, 235 CBU out of > 10 000 stored CBUs had been issued for transplantation to 230 patients worldwide. Twenty one percent (n = 2208) of the banked units have a total nucleated cell (TNC) content of 40-60 \u00d7 10 7 TNC, 24% (n = 2510) contain 60-80 \u00d7 10 7 TNC and 54% (n = 5680) contain > 80 \u00d7 10 7 TNCs. Regarding the ethnicity, approximately 30% of the banked units are from EM and 10% from mixed ethnic (ME) background. A survival analysis was performed on 139 CBUs issued for single CBT: 104 patients with malignant disease (MD) and 35 with nonmalignant disease with available follow-up. Issued units contained a median of 4.3 \u00d7 10 7 /kg TNC, 20% were from EM donors and 10% from ME background where rare HLA types are expressed. HLAmatching (HLA-A and -B antigenic, -DRB1 allelic typing) was 6/6 in 23%, 5/6 in 46% and 4/6 in 37% of patient-CBU pairs. Ethnicity was matched in 65% of pairs. Median follow up was 35 months. Median time to neutrophil engraftment was 24 days and the cumulative incidence (CI) of neutrophil engraftment was 80%. CI of transplantrelated mortality was 32% at 2 years. Probability of disease-free survival was 48% at 1 year and 41% at 2 years in MD. Probability of overall survival (OS) for the 139 single CBTs was 53% at 2 years (71% for non malignant disease (NMD) and 39% for MD). Probability of OS was 81% in patients with no HLA mismatch CBT, 73% in patients with 1 HLA-mismatched CBT and 33% in patients with \u22652 HLA mismatches (p unadjusted 0.05). Over 40% of the CBUs in the NHS-CBB are from EM donors and 17% of CBU used in the 139 single CBTs reported here were from EM or ME background. The clinical outcomes obtained in patients transplanted with our units are comparable to published data. S. Takahashi (1) , N. Tsukada (1) , S. Kato (1) , T. Kawakita (1) , T. Yagyu (1) , F.

            "text": "The prognosis of advanced myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is poor. We analyzed the disease specifi c outcomes of adult patients with advanced MDS treated with cord blood transplantation (CBT) after myeloablative conditioning and identifi ed pretransplant factors related to the transplant outcomes. Between August 1998 and June 2009, 33 adult patients with advanced MDS were treated with unrelated CBT in our institute. The diagnosis MDS was made for all patients according to the WHO classifi cation. The diagnosis at transplantation included refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB1/2) (n = 7) and MDSrelated secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) (n = 26). All patients received four fractionated 12 Gy TBI and chemotherapy as myeloablative conditioning. All patients received standard cyclosporine and methotrexate as a graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. The median age was 42 years (range, 19-52 years), the median weight was 55 kg (range, 41-75 kg), the median number of cryopreserved nucleated cells was 2.51 \u00d7 10 7 /kg (range, 1.71-4. 60 \u00d7 10 7 /kg), and the median number of cryopreserved CD34 positive cells was 0.91x10 5 /kg (range, 0.27-2.14x105/kg). 30 patients had myeloid reconstitution and the median time to more than 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L absolute neutrophil count was 22 days (range, 18-35 days). The cumulative incidence (CI) of neutrophil recovery at day 50 was 90. 9% . In multivariate analysis, neutrophil recovery was signifi cantly faster among sAML patients (P = 0.04). A self-sustained platelet count more than 50 \u00d7 10 9 /L was achieved in 29 patients at a median time of 51 days (range, 30-179 days). CI of platelet recovery at day 200 was 87. 9% . In multivariate analysis, platelet recovery was signifi cantly faster among CMV seronegative patients (P < 0.001). CI of grade II-IV acute GVHD and extensive type chronic GVHD was 67.4% and 34.3%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, degree of HLA mismatch had a significant impact on CI of grade II-IV acute GVHD (P = 0.021). The 5-year CI of transplant related-mortality (TRM) and relapse was 13.9% and 15.9%, respectively. No factor was associated with the incidence of TRM and relapse. The probability of event-free survival (EFS) at 5 years was 70.2%. No factor was associated with EFS. These results suggest that adult advanced MDS patients without suitable related or unrelated bone marrow donors should be considered as candidates for CBT. D. Heldal, L. Brinch, Y. Fl\u00f8isand, I. Dybedal, T. Gedde-Dahl, P.A. Holme, G.E. Tj\u00f8nnfjord, S.A Evensen Oslo University Hospital (Oslo, NO) Objectives/Methods: Between 1994 and 1999, 60 consecutive adult pts with haematological malignancies with a family donor were randomised to myeloablative allogeneic transplantation with blood stem cells (BSC) or bone marrow (BM). Engraftment parameters, incidence of acute and chronic graftversus-host disease (cGvHD), transplant related mortality, 5 yrs leukaemia free survival (LFS), relapse rate and overall survival (OS) have been described in previous publications [1, 2] . With a landmark of \u2265 5 years, 40 pts were evaluable, 21 in the BSC group and 19 in the BM group. We recorded the incidence of late relapse, LFS, OS, prevalence of cGvHD, persistent immunosuppressive treatment, secondary malignancies and the ability to work at a median of 13 yrs of observation. Survivors as of 11/2009 were interviewed, 18 in the BSC group, 17 in the BM group. Results: After 5 yrs, there were 2/21 relapses in the BSC group and 3/19 in the BM group. The total number of relapses was 3/30 and 12/30 respectively (P < 0.001). However, there was no statistical difference between the groups with regard to LFS and OS after randomisation. At \u2265 5 yrs, 12/21 in the BSC group and 9/19 in the BM group had developed cGvHD. At last follow up, there were 4/10 in the BSC group and 6/9 in the BM group who experienced complete resolution of cGvHD symptoms, none of the pts with persistent cGvHD received immunosuppressive treatment.",

Bouzas (4) Umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) has extended the availability of allogeneic transplantation to patients without HLA-identical donors, mainly for countries high frequency of rare haplotypes such as Brazil. We evaluated 173 patients who received a single fi rst UCBT in Brazil between with 1993 and 2009 for hematological malignancies from 13 transplant centers. Median age was 8 years (range 1-60) and 58% were male. Sixty-nine patients (40%) had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 57 (33%) acute myelogenous leukemia, 23 (13%) myelodysplastic syndrome, 18 (10%) chronic myelogenous leukemia and 6 (4%) chronic lymphoid diseases. Most patients (55%) were transplanted in advanced phases of their diseases. Based on antigen-level HLA-A and -B and allele-level HLA-DRB1 typing, 64 patients (52%) received a cord blood unit with 2 mismatches, 54 (44%) with one mismatch and 5 (4%) matched units. Most patients (94%) received a myeloablative regimen. Median follow-up time of survivors was 30 months. The cumulative incidence (CI) of neutrophil engraftment at day 60 was 61%, after a median time of 22 days (range 12-55 days) and the CI of platelet engraftment at day 60 was 42%, after a median time of 41 days (range 16-125 days). Experience of centers (more than 30 UCBT performed) was the only factor associated with improved engraftment rate (P = 0.05). CI of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at 100 days was 19% and of chronic GVHD only 5% at 3 years. CI of non-relapse related mortality (NRM) was 41%, being higher in patients older than the median age (51% vs. 32% for younger patients, P = 0.05), and receiving a CD34 + cell dose lower than 1 \u00d7 10 5 /kg (54% vs. 25% P = 0.002). At 3 years, the CI of relapse or progression was 20%, and the estimated progression-free survival (PFS) was 36%, being decreased in patients with advanced disease status (28% vs. 46% for patients in remission, P = 0.001), and receiving a CD34 + cell dose lower than 1 \u00d7 10 5 /kg (21% vs. 42%, P = 0.04). At 3 years, overall survival was 41%. In conclusion, UCBT in Brazil seems to be associated with lower engraftment rates as compared to the published experience from other countries. Nevertheless, use of HLA-mismatched UCBT is a valuable alternative for patients with hematologic malignancies in Brazil who lack an HLA-matched related or unrelated donor. UCB units with a higher CD34 + cell count and transplants performed for patients in remission may improve outcomes.",

Hauzenberger Centre for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation (Stockholm, SE) Objective: We studied the role of panel-reactive anti-HLA antibodies on outcome in patients undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with cord-blood. Methods: Serum samples from 42 patients undergoing HSCT with cord-blood as stem cell source were collected during conditioning, prior to HSCT. Screening for panel reactive antibodies using fl ow cytometry was performed according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Flow-PRA, One Lambda, USA). Results: 9/42 (21%) patients undergoing HSCT had panelreactive antibodies (PRA) against HLA class I and/or II prior to HSCT. 5/42 (12%) had PRA against HLA class I, solely, whereas 2/42 (5%) had PRA against HLA class II. 2/42 (5%) patients had PRA against HLA class I and II. 6/42 (14%) patients had PRA > 20% against HLA class I and/or II. When comparing the incidence of rejection, defi ned as 100% recipient in chimerism post-HSCT, no statistical signifi cant differences between the group with PRA prior to HSCT and the group without PRA prior to HSCT could be observed. However, when comparing time to of engraftment, the group with PRA prior to HSCT had signifi cant delayed engraftment as compared to the group without PRA (P < 0,05). Furthermore, a trend to delayed engraftment of platelets could be observed in the group with PRA prior to HSCT as compared to the group without PRA. Conclusion: We conclude that the presence of PRA prior to HSCT doesn't infl uence the rate of rejection in HSCT with cordblood, however time to engraftment was signifi cantly delayed in this group. One way of overcoming this problem might be to increase the cell dose in patients with preformed HLA antibodies receiving HSCT with cord-blood. Background: Cryopreservation of human umbilical cord blood (UCB) for use in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is expanding rapidly. Most freezing protocols utilize dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), however, the risk of infusional toxicity and critical reductions in viable stem and progenitor cells remain a concern. Cell yields in UCB units are limited by the collected volume and damage caused during storage. Ice recrystallization (IR) is an important source of cryopreservation injury that occurs as a result of ice reshaping during thawing. Naturallyoccurring carbohydrates have wide-ranging intrinsic ability to inhibit IR related to structural properties such as hydration index. We investigated the impact of carbohydrate IR inhibition (IRI) on total mononuclear cell (MNC) and CD34 + progenitor cell viability, levels of apoptosis and in vitro hematopoietic progenitor function in cryopreserved UCB. Methods: UCB was collected following informed consent. MNCs were isolated by Ficoll-gradient centrifugation and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. Samples were cryopreserved in storage media containing specifi c carbohydrates (200 mM) and compared to 5% DMSO. Samples were analyzed under conditions of high IR (\"slow\" thaw) and low IR (\"fast\" thaw). Cells were analyzed by fl ow cytometry for viability (exclusion of 7-AAD) and apoptosis (Annexin-V-positive). Hematopoietic progenitor function was examined in colony-forming unit (CFU) assays. IRI of carbohydrate solutions was determined using the \"splat\" cooling assay.",

The correlations were less apparent under conditions of low IR. Carbohydrates with greater IRI modulate the induction of early apoptosis during thawing, especially in CD34 + cells (r2 = 0.96, P = 0.0001) as compared to total mononuclear cells (P = 0.006), and preserve CFU capacity in vitro (r2 = 0.92, P \u2264 0.0001). Conclusion: Our results suggest that inhibition of IR increases the yield of non-apoptotic and functional hematopoietic progenitors following cryopreservation of human UCB. Developing novel synthetic carbohydrates with enhanced IRI properties is a promising strategy to improve cryopreservation of UCB and facilitate more rapid hematopoietic engraftment following transplantation.

Blaise Institut Paoli Calmettes (Marseille, FR) Poor graft function without rejection may occur after stem cell transplantation (SCT). CD34 ( + ) stem cell boost (SCB) can restore marrow function but may induce or exacerbate GvHD. We therefore investigated the feasibility and effi cacy of CD34 ( + )-selected SCB in some patients with poor graft function. We present the results for 13 patients transplanted at our cancer centre at Marseille, who received a boost of unmanipulated blood cells from the original donor, without further conditioning, 10/3 (M/F), median age 44 years (range 20-69), transplanted initially for Chronic Myeloide Leukaemia (n.3), NHL (n.3), Myelodisplastic Syndrome (n.2), Medullary Aplasia (n.2), and only one patient with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia, Multiple Myeloma and Myelofi brosis. Nine patients had received HLAmatched sibling donor grafts and four patients a matched unrelated grafts, all patients but one received a peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC); The transplant conditioning was myeloablative in 6 patients, and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) in 7 patients. The median interval between transplants and the boost were 5.4 months (range 3.9-9.2). After a median follow up of 25 months post-transplant, none had achieved platelet counts > 50/nL, 9 patients (69%) had a platelets transfusion dependence and 8 patients (62%) was dependent of red blood cells transfusions at (SCB), even though donor chimerism was > 95% in all patients. The patients received a median of 3,94 \u00d7 10(6)/kg CD34 ( + ) cells and 18,57 \u00d7 10(3)/kg CD3 ( + ) T lymphocytes. After SCB 11 patients (85%) had a leukocyte recuperation (>2,5 G/L), 7 patients (54%) and 6 patients (46%) had a platelets and red blood cells transfusion independence respectively. After a median follow-up of 13 months (range10-23), fi ve patients remained alive. No patient had developed acute or chronic GvHD after the boost; four patients died of infections, one patient died of disease progression, one patient of hemorrhagic syndrome, and only one patient died because an resistant preexisting digestive GvHD. At one year and two years, post (SCB) of CD 34( + ), the OS was 80% IC95 (39-95) and 60% IC95 (16-86) respectively. These preliminary results point to the possibility of safely improving graft function using CD34( + ) positively selected stem cells without necessarily increasing the incidence of GvHD in patients with poor graft function post-SCT. Experience with more patients and longer follow-up should clarify the optimal role for this procedure.",

Athanassiades, Z. Poulopoulou, M. Garofalaki, E. Bika, M. Papageorgiou, S. Vasileiou, M.E. Karatza, J. Apostolidis, N. Harhalakis, E. Nikiforakis Evangelismos Hospital (Athens, GR) Unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) is usually performed across major HLA disparities and at a limited cell dose, which necessitates infusion of two partially matched UCB units especially in adult patients. Unit selection for UCBT is currently based on antigen level typing for HLA class I, while the impact of allele match remains unknown. We retrospectively examined HLA compatibility at the allele level in a group of patients who underwent double UCBT at our center. From 08/2006 to 10/2009, 22 patients lacking an adequately matched volunteer donor received dual unit UCBT for high-risk acute leukemia (AML: 16, ALL: 6), at a median age of 37 years (range, 16-60). The conditioning regimen was myeloablative in 17 and reduced-intensity in 5 patients. The median weight of patients was 74 (range, 48-105) kg. Total nucleated cell (NC) and CD34 + cell doses infused per patient were 2.6-6.5 \u00d7 10 7 /kg (median, 4.3 \u00d7 10 7 /kg) and 0.6-3.1x10 5 /kg (median, 1.5 \u00d7 10 5 / kg), respectively. Original HLA match of the 44 UCB units was 5/6 (n = 8) or 4/6 (n = 36). Compatibility was demoted by fi nal match in 57% of units (5/6 in 2, 4/6 in 21 and \u2264 3/6 in 21 units. Additional high-resolution typing at HLA-C and -DQB1 demonstrated 8/10 match in 2, 7/10 in 6, 6/10 in 12, and \u2264 5/10 in 24 units. Engraftment was achieved in all but one patients, with a median time to absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 500/uL of 20 (range, 6-48) days. Time to engraftment did not correlate with total NC or CD34 + cell dose and with the original or fi nal HLA match of the engrafting unit either. Notably, the predominant unit could not be predicted by cell dose but was significantly associated with a higher fi nal HLA match (P = 0.008 and 0.0008 for the degree of matching at 6 and 10 alleles, respectively by Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Final HLA match was not observed to affect the incidence of acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease, transplant-related mortality, relapse rate, and disease-free survival. Nevertheless, there was a trend of superior overall survival with \u2265 6/10 allele match of the engrafting unit compared to < 6/10 match (P = 0.076 by log-rank test).",

Richardson, K. Hill, C. Hurlock, P. Casey, J. Newman, KH. Orchard Southampton University Hospitals (Southampton, UK) Mobilisation of peripheral blood haematopoietic progenitor cells (PBPCs) has become a standard procedure in patients prior to an autologous stem cell transplant. In September 2008 a biosimilar GCSF (Ratiograstim) was granted an EU licence for use in mobilisation of PBPCs. Although licensed for PBPC mobilisation little clinical data has been available regarding the effectiveness of the biosimilar in this context. Ratiograstim was incorporated into clinical use for PBPC mobilisation in the Wessex Blood and Marrow Transplantation Programme from November 2008 replacing the previous form of GCSF. An audit of harvests over the periods Jan-Sept 2008 (standard GCSF) and Jan-Sept 2009 (Ratiograstim) was performed comparing the effi ciency of mobilisation in the two groups of patients. Data were collected regarding the maximum CD34 predictor in peripheral blood, total CD34 per kg body weight collected, time from priming to maximal predictor level and number of harvest procedures required per patient. Methods: Data were retrospectively collected for 29 patients who underwent PBPC harvest at SUHT from Jan-Sept 2009 using the biosimilar GCSF. The 34 patients who underwent the procedure Jan-Sept 2008 were used as the comparator group mobilised with standard GCSF. Doses of GCSF were essentially the same throughout. Results: The mean age of the 34 patients from 2008 was 53.6 years (SD 12.8). 24 patients had myeloma, the others lymphoproliferative diseases (LPDs). The mean age of the 29 patients from 2009 was 53.2 years (SD 12.9). 16 of these patients had myeloma and the others LPDs. All patients with myeloma were primed with cyclophosphamide and GCSF. The LPD patients received various GCSF containing regimens, including R-ICE, R-IVE, cyclophosphamide and cytarabine. Results were analysed using the paired t-test.",

Methods: 209 patients between 2004 and 2008 were studied. Since more than one mobilization courses and/or apheresis procedures were performed in poor mobilizers, two methods of analysis were applied. Method A: All mobilization courses were analyzed with the following endpoints: maximum absolute number of circulating CD34 + cells and number of CD34 + cells collected for each mobilization procedure. Method B: Each patient was considered only once with the following endpoint: mean number of CD34 + cells collected per apheresis.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Factors that affect successful mobilization and collection of PBSC include the mobilizing regimen (superior outcome with ifosfamide-containing regimens), the number of previous chemotherapies (inferior collection with 4 or more), age, baseline PLT count, disease status pre-mobilization (superior collection in refractory patients) and underlying disease (best outcome n HL patients). Graft failure was rare (BM: 4%, PBSC: 2%, P = 0.306) with a signifi cantly faster time to engraftment using PBSC than BM (14 vs. 20 days; P < 0.001). The incidence of acute GvHD was signifi cantly higher in recipients of PBSC (64%) than BM (51%; P = 0.022), however there was no increase in grade III/IV (P = 0.420) disease in PBSC recipients. No other factor was signifi cantly associated with aGvHD. Chronic GvHD at 6 years was similar (BM: 61%, PBSC: 55%, NS) with no difference in the incidence of extensive disease. The incidence of neither disease relapse nor NRM was signifi cantly different between groups (relapse at 5 years: BM 44%, PBSC 36%; P = 0.112, and NRM at 5 years: BM 22%, PBSC 24%; P = 0.751). These fi ndings persisted in mva, where only CML was associated with an increased relapse risk (P = 0.001) and CMV seropositive patients with a higher NRM (P = 0.01). In conclusion, we have shown that the only signifi cant difference in clinical outcome between PBSC and BM is a higher incidence in the occurrence (but not grade) of acute GvHD. We suggest that either stem cell source can be used with a similar outcome in adult and paediatric recipients of T-cell depleted allografts for standard risk leukaemia.",

            "text": "In view of gene therapy of TH, the G-CSF-associated splenic rupture or thrombosis raise safety concerns in TH, because of splenomegaly and hypercoagulability. HU pretreatment (prt) could reduce risks by decreasing splenic size (ss) in nonsplenectomized (nSPL) and high numbers of circulating cells in SPL patients (pts) before G-CSF (G). In a mobilization (mbz) study, we assess the safety/effi cacy of G \u00b1 HU ptr in 24 adult pts with b-TH. Twenty three pts have been enrolled, 12 SPL and 11 nSPL (9/12 and 5/11 with 1 month-HU prt). Two HU-nSPL pts withdrew during the study. No severe adverse events were observed. In nSPL pts, HU reduced the ss before G, however the max vol during mbz didn't differ between pretreated or not pts. HU negatively affected the CD34 + yield when the 'wash-out' period (W-OP) before G was 8 days (CD34 + : 1,86 \u00d7 10 6 /kg/ 2 aph, n = 2), but it markedly improved when this period increased to 18 days (CD34 + : 6,5 \u00d7 10 6 /kg/ 2 aph, n = 1). NSPL pts w/o HU-prtm mobilized successfully (CD34 + : 6,67 \u00d7 10 6 /kg/2aph, n = 6). SPL pts yielded unexpectedly very low CD34 + cells (0.83 \u00d7 10 6 /kg/2aph, n = 2). WBCs were highly elevated during G (from mean 15.25 to 81 \u00d7 10 9 /l) despite the reduced and adjusted to the level of WBCs G-doses (mean dose: 3.4 mcg/ kg/d). Hyperleukocytosis necessitated early (d3,4) therapeutic leukapheresis in all but one pt, who started G with lower WBCs (12.8 \u00d7 10 9 /l) and aphereses were initiated later (d5) resulting in effective mbz (4,5 \u00d7 10 6 /kg/2aph). HU negatively affected the yield when the W-OP before G was < 12 days (mean CD34 + 0.62 \u00d7 10 6 /kg/2aph, n = 5). However, when this period increased to \u2265 12 days, to allow bm recovery from HU myelosuppresion, mbz was highly successful (CD34 + 6.63 \u00d7 10 6 / kg/2aph, P = 0.0007, n = 4). Those pts could tolerate 2-fold higher G-doses (mean: 6.75 mcg/kg/d, P = 0.02) w/o producing hyperleukocytosis. HU decreased the high PLTs (from 507 to 372 \u00d7 10 9 /l, P = 0,0002) and WBCs (from 17.24 to 9.94 \u00d7 10 9 /l, P = 0,1) before G, potentially reducing the thrombosis risk and partially preventing hyperleukocytosis during mbz [maxWBCs (\u00d7 10 9 /l) SPL-HU: 52,99 vs. SPL-noHU: 76.43, P = 0.1]. Overall, mbz of SPL TH pts is challenging but not inherently ineffi cient. The poor yields are rather the sequelae of mandatory G-dose modifi cations to avoid hyperleukocytosis. HU as prt effectively overcomes this limitation and adds to the safety of the procedure. However, it requires a rather prolonged treatment with a critical W-OP for a suffi cient CD34 + cell yield. A.

We evaluated different biological variables in order to minimize the risk in patients (pts) and healthy donors. Materials and methods: We have retrospectively evaluated 155 LA procedures performed in 81 pts affected by haematological or solid malignancies, mobilized with a combination of G-CSF and chemotherapy and in 17 healthy donors mobilized by G-CSF alone. LA were performed by means of a COBE-SPEC-TRA technology when number of CD34 + before LA were \u2265 5 \u03bcL; patients and donors who showed \u2265 20 \u03bcL CD34 + were defi ned as good mobilizers (GM). Target of collection was \u2265 2 \u00d7 10 6 /Kg CD34 + . Results: All subjects underwent at least one LA procedure and reached the target. The median of LA collections was 1 (range 1-4). In the entire population the median number of CD34 + at the time of fi rst LA was 36\u03bcL (5-617) with a median percentage of 0.26% (0.01-8.39). The median of CD34 + collected was 2.98 \u00d7 10 6 /kg (0.18-47.6). 18/82 (22%) GM experienced at least one adverse event (EA) during the LA procedure compared to 2/16 (13%) of subjects with < 20 \u03bcL CD34 + (no-GM).",

We do not fi nd any correlation between blood volume processed and CD34 + / kg collected, while we observed that the ratio between number of CD34 + /Kg cells collected and total blood volume processed in GM strongly correlated with the number of CD34 + /Kg cells S162 collected (R2 = 0.86). In particular, those subjects who reached the target of \u2265 2 \u00d7 10 6 /Kg CD34 + cells by one single LA, showed a minimum ratio of 180. Conclusions: In our retrospective experience we did not observe any difference in the collection time and blood volume for GM and no-GM to reach the target. The ratio > 180 suggests that the target of CD34 + cells can be reached by one single LA, with shorter procedures, minimizing the subject's risks.

Results: In patients (a) with a good effect of mobilization (precollection CD 34 + cells in blood higher than 20 /ul) we prepared almost the same median dose of CD 34 + cells from the Standard and \"Mix\" collections, 3,8 and 4 \u00d7 10 6 /kg. In LVL the median yield of CD 34 + cells was 8 \u00d7 10 6 /kg. In patients (b) who were mobilized weekly (precollection CD 34 + cells in blood lower than 20/ul), LVL enabled to prepare 1,5 \u00d7 10 6 of CD 34 + / kg from one collection, while the median yield of CD 34 + cells from Standard and \"Mix\" collections was 0,9 and 1,2 \u00d7 10 6 /kg. Three mild adverse reactions in patients were observed -hypotension (1) and hypokalcemia (2) which were corrected in the course of procedure. Conclusion: We observed the similar effi ciency in Standard and Mix collections in well mobilized and weakly mobilized patiens. LVL enabled to get higher yield of CD 34 + cells than the Standard and MIX collections in well mobilized patients as well as in weakly mobilized patients. We can recommend LVL in all patients who can tolerate it due to a greater chance of collecting high yields of progenitor cells. In the weakly mobilized patients LVL offers a greater chance of collecting at least a minimum amount of CD 34 + cells needed for transplantation. \"Mix\" collections may be used as an alternative technique in circumstances in which standard or LVL can not be recommended, e.g. in patients who do not tolerate citrate or the high extent of procedure (cardiac arrhytmia, unstable vital signs etc.).",

Mentkevich Institute of Ped. Oncology/Hematology (Moscow, RU) Haploidentical SCT is the therapeutic modality for patients lacking HLA-identical donor. RIC ensures good tolerability and safety, early stable full donor chimerism with potential GvT effect. Since 2001 we performed 44 haplo-transplantations from relatives in 38 pts with poor-prognostic malignancies: 9-AML, 4-ALL, 4-CML, 5-JMML, 1-MDS, 3-NHL, 7-NBIV, 4-EWS and 1melanoma. RIC regimen included Fludarabine 180 mg/m\u00b2, and ATG 40 mg/kg in combination with Busulfan 8 mg/kg (n = 31) or Treosulfan 30000 mg/m\u00b2 (n = 7). The PBSC with a median number of 6.3 (2-12.5) \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg were infused after incubation in vitro with vincristine and methylprednisolone. Tdepletion was not performed. GvHD prophylaxis consisted of short methotrexate and cyclosporine A or tacrolimus. Three pts with leukemia progression at the time of SCT didn't recover and died. Four pts with JMML/MDS rejected and relapsed in fi rst 2 mos after SCT. Thirty three pts (82,5%) recovered with full donor chimerism. Incidence of acute GVHD was gr. I-II 22 pts (64%), gr III-6 pts (18%), gr. IV-0%. Acute GvHD was successfully treated with steroids and ATG. Incidence of chronic GVHD was 52% (mainly extensive). Five pts were retransplanted (4-JMML/MDS, 1-CML). Two of them engrafted and one of them is alive and disease free at 3 years. Nine pts are alive and well with a median follow-up 41 (8. 1-88.5 ) mos, 20 pts died from relapse, 2 pts died from acute GVHD, 7 pts from chronic GVHD and infections. Relapse rate at 1 yr was 75% and 33% for solid tumor and leukemia/lymphoma pts. DFS and EFS were 54% and 22% with a median f-up of 45 and 25 mo for hematological malignancies vs. 20% and 8% at 10 and 8 mo in pts with solid tumors, respectively. Haploidentical transplantation following reduced-intensive conditioning is feasible and safe if an appropriate GvHD prophylaxis is given. This strategy is applicable to very high risk and potentially incurable patients if no conventional donor is available. Heavier conditioning regimen does require for kids suffering from JMML/MDS.",

Pivkova, S. Genadieva Stavrik, Z. Stojanoski, S. Krstevska Balkanov, L. Cevreska, O. Karanfi lski, S. Trajkova, B. Georgievski University Hematology Hospital (Skopje, MK) Mobilized PBSC have largely replaced conventional, unprimed BM as source during the autologous transplant setting, because of a faster hematopoietic reconstitution, less transfusion requirements, less infective complications and earlier hospital discharge. Choosing the optimal mobilizing regimen is the goal for achieving the suffi cient amount of PBSC for autologous transplant. G-CSF is the standard agent commonly administered undergoing PBPC mobilization and collection in a dose of 10 micro/gr in a 4 days regimen. The additional chemotherapy to G-SCF is still associated with higher rate of hemorrhagic cystitis, prolonged neutropenia, infective complications, secondary malignancies and other toxicities. Therefore in this study we evaluated the effi cacy, complication rates and cost-effectiveness of chemotherapy + G-CSF versus single agent C-CSF as mobilizing regimens. We analyzed 125 patients with haematological malignancies (49 AML in fi rst remission, 26 HD, 30 MM, 16 NHL, 4ALL) who underwent mobilization of PBSC in our centre and the attempt to reach 2 \u00d7 10(6)/kgCD34 cells. In 6% of patients adequate cell dose was not reachable and overall failure rate of mobilization of 17,5%. Furthermore 15.6% failed to harvest the optimal 4 \u00d7 10(6)/kgCD34 + cells with > 1 aphaeresis attempt. The analysis of factors contributing in this effect in the univariante analysis were: > 2 lines of previous chemotherapy and neutropenic events (P = 0,002 and P = 0,005), those also remained signifi cant in the multivariate analysis (RR:4,4 and 6,2). No differences have been noticed between the diagnostic groups of patients. The mortality rate was 2% (intracranial bleeding and sepsis). The statistical analysis preformed for analyzed patients transplanted with single G-CSF as mobilizing regimen, compared with the chemotherapy + G-CSF group showed P < 0,0001 for febrile days, microbiological positive isolates, days of hospital stay, transfusion requirements. The median cost of PBSC collection in the Chemotherapy + G-CSF group was E 8550 (E220-10110) compared with the G-CSF group alone E3110 (E2200-4120) that showed P < 0,0001. Taking these results in consideration for the potential candidates for ASCT, transplant centers should consider the use of less myelosupressive agents or dose reduction strategies for the mobilization and autologous stem cell procurement.",

Raj Apollo Speciality Hospital (Chennai, IN) The use of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) for stem cell transplantation has greatly increased in adults. This trend is now refl ected in paediatrics, where healthy children are donating PBSC or donor lymphocytes via apheresis for their siblings. There have been concerns over the safety of PBSC collection in paediatric donors. We have reviewed 52 PBSC (40 allogeneic and 12 autologous) collections in paediatric donors (aged 18 months to 18 years) at our institution over a period of 13 years from 1996 to 2009. The donors had received a median of 5 days of growth factor (10 \u03bcg / kg body weight). All donors had a femoral apheresis catheter placed on the morning of the procedure under intravenous sedation. Anxiolytic agents like midazolam or lorazepam were used during the process if required. The extracorporeal line was primed with irradiated leucoreduced packed red cells when donors weighed less than 40 kg (32 procedures were primed). The anticoagulants used were a combination of heparin in bolus and continuous infusion of acid citrate dextrose at a reduced rate to avoid citrate toxicity. All donors were given calcium intravenously in between and at the end of collection. 53 PBSC collections were done with smallest donor weighing 11 kg and a median of 2.10 times of donor blood volume was processed per procedure. The mean mononuclear cell yield for per kg of recipient weight was 5.4 \u00d7 10 8 in allogeneic donors and 3.3 \u00d7 10 8 in autologous donors. 8 donors underwent two days of collection and 1 donor for 3 days. Minor side effects like generalized myalgia due to growth factor administration, pain at the femoral catheter site, anxiety, restlessness, perioral tingling due to hypocalcemia and mild hypotension were seen in a majority of the donors. 2 donors had fever after insertion of the femoral catheter requiring intravenous antibiotics. 1 child had atrial fi brillation requiring adenosine. This event occurred in one of our earliest collections and modifi cation of the anticoagulant protocol during harvest has virtually eliminated this potential problem in subsequent procedures.",

Olsson, M. Remberger, O. Ringd\u00e9n Karolinska University Hospital (Stockholm, SE) In hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), using unrelated donors, stem cells are often harvest at remote hospitals, and may be handled ex vivo for several days before they are infused into the recipient. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate whether the duration of the ex vivo transportation of hematopoietic stem cells impairs the clinical outcome following transplantation. We retrospectively analyzed 90 consecutive patients who received unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cells at our centre between 2003 and 2008. Both children and adults were included (median age 45, range 0.5-67), whereas retransplantations were excluded. The indications for allogeneic HSCT were: AML (32%), ALL (16%), myelodysplastic syndrome (16%), CML (10%), lymphoma (12%), solid tumors (7%), metabolic disorders (3%), aplastic anemia (2%), and multiple myeloma (2%). In all recipients, the total ex vivo time of the stem cell transplant (median 28 h, range 5-53 h) was calculated and subdivided into the transportation time from the donor hospital to our centre (median 20 h, range 3-38 h), as well as the time from arrival at our hospital until the start of the stem cell infusion (median 10 h, 0.5-26 h). In univariate analysis, none of the ex vivo times were signifi cant predictors of graft failure, relapse, non-relapse mortality or overall survival. In conclusion, the clinical outcome following HSCT seems to be independent of the time the stem cell transplant is kept ex vivo for transportation purposes.",

The experience of our center is limited due to the many hindrances and disadvantages out which we will only mention those related to the late addressability of patients. Objectives: We aimed at analysing the quantity and quality of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) graft in relation to the particularities of patients, disease, therapy and to the procedure of mobilization/harvest of cells as well as the estimation of the impact of the graft on the outcome of HSCT. Material and methods: The retrospective observational study was conducted on 221 HSC grafts used for 89 procedures of autologous HSCT. Peripheral HSC harvest has been performed in all patients. 53,94% of the patients were in different stages of advanced disease,in partial remission or progressive disease. Results: Age was an important factor in CD34 + cells collection: the quantity obtained was 5,35 \u00b1 2,56 \u00d7 10 6 /kg for the age < 8 years, 4,15 \u00b1 5,40 \u00d7 10 6 /kg for the age \u2264 55 years and 1,95 \u00b1 0,40 \u00d7 10 6 /kg for the age > 55 years. (P < 0.001). The underlying disease infl uenced the CD34 + cells collection; best molizers have been leukemia patients (7,33 \u00b1 12 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg) whereas worst mobilizers, patients with solid tumors (2,5 \u00b1 2, 66 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg). (P < 0.01) The best CD34 + cells collection (5,23 \u00b1 5,87 \u00d7 10 6 /kg) has been achieved after DHAP regim and the worst with cyclophosphamide (1,92 \u00b1 5,17 \u00d7 10 6 /kg). (P = 0.05) The quantity of > 20CD34 + cells/\u03bcl in peripheral blood has been decisive. (P = 0. 012) The quantity of CD34 + cells administered in the transplantation procedure correlated with the timelines for granulocytes and thrombocytes engraftment (r = -0.706, P < 0.001; r = -0.244, P = 0.03) without impacting the mortality associated to transplantation (6,74%). (P = 0.4370 Actuarial overall survival (OS) is 49,8% at 9 years. TRM was higher in Bu-Cy conditioning group (44,4%) than Flu-Cy-ATG conditioning group (25%; p = 0,0) and OS is 63% at 9 years in Flu-Cy-ATG group. Conclusion: Flu-Cy-ATG conditioning regimen appears better than BU-Cy. A best outcome can be reached by precoce diagnosis and by reduction of interval from diagnosis to allograft.",

Jahani Hematology-Oncology and SCT Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences (Tehran, IR) Introduction: Acquired Severe Aplastic Anemia (SAA) is a rare disease and the outcome of these patients has improved con-siderably over the last decades. In young patients bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is the elective treatment who has an HLA-identical sibling donor. We retrospectively analyzed patients who received allogeneic BMT or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) and compared the differences in hematologic recovery, acute and chronic GVHD, relapse and disease free survival and overall survival in two groups. Methods: Between March 1991 and October 2009, 163 patients with multi-transfused SAA received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling donor (158 patients) or HLA full matched other related donor (5 patients). Three patients received both bone marrow and peripheral blood therefore exclude from study. Median age in BMT group was 17 years (range 1 to 32) and in PBSCT was 23 years (range 2 to 50). All patients received the conditioning regimen containing cyclophosphamide and ATG and graftversus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis include cyclosporine and methotrexate at the standard doses.",

There was no difference in the incidence of acute GVHD between patients receiving BMT and those receiving PBSCT (P = 1). The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD for those who survived more than 90 days was 10.2% in the BMT group, compared to 27% in the PBSCT group (P = 0.022). Eleven (22.4%) of BMT recipients and 7 (6.3%) of PBSCT recipients suffered a relapse (P = 0.005). Disease-free survival at 1 year was 74% in the BMT group and 85% in the PBSCT group (P = 0.318) and Overall survival at 1 year was 82% in the BMT group and 88% in the PBSCT group (P = 0.1). Nine patients in BMT group and 17 patients in PBSCT group were dead. Discussion: This study results showed that engraftment is rapid in multi-transfused patients who undergoing PBSCT than BMT with signifi cant differences. However there was no difference seen in overall survival and disease free survival in two groups but chronic GVHD which affect long term outcome and quality of life especially in young patients is signifi cantly higher in PBSCT group.

There was a marked trend towards better failure-free survival (FFS) in more severe disease (33 \u00b1 13%, 43 \u00b1 11% and 65 \u00b1 12% in MAA, SAA and VSAA respectively). The elevated number of activated CD8 + T-cells and the presence of PNH clones were more frequent in VSAA. The proportion of patients with significant telomere shortening was lower in VSAA (29%) than in SAA (50%) and MAA (58%). Disease duration before start of IST is longer for MAA as compared with SAA and VSAA (P = 0.0001). These biological and treatment related characteristics give the possible explanation for better quality of response and FFS in VSAA.",

Aim of the study: We evaluated the outcome of androgen therapy in 46 patients with Aplastic Anemia (AA) who had received a previous course of ATG and were persistently cytopenic. Patients and methods: 46 patients AA were selected as having received treatment with testosterone ondecanoato p.o. 40 mg/day 5-7 days/week, because of persistent cytopenia, in 1-3 cell lines. Median age was 45 years (19-69); there were 16 males and 30 females. The median Hb levels at start of testosterone, were (8.6 gr/dl 6.

The median interval between ATG treatment and testosterone 173 days (0-4269). The median duration of androgen therapy was 568 days (275181). Outcome: Of the 46 patients treated, 18 (41%) showed no response; of these 12 were allografted; 26 patients (59%) showed increments in blood counts and were considered responders: of these 14 were partial response and 12 were complete responses (platelet count over 100 \u00d7 10 9 /L). Responses were more frequent in femelaes (63%) as compared to amles (44%) (P = 0.1). The actuarial 5 year failure survival is XX%; it was 92% for responders 0% for non responders. Treatment with testosterone and low doses of cyclosporine, was well tolerated and could be gradually tapered with time, down to a conventional 40 mg of testosterone twice weekly.",

In these patients, a second course of ATG may lead to serious side-effects during ATG infusion and problems like graft rejection and acute GvHD. Replacement of ATG by Alemtuzumab in such patients could be warranted. Backgound: Although allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) from matched related donor (MRD) is a standard therapy for severe acquired aplastic anemia (AA), alternative donor (AD) alloSCT is increasing and the survival of alloSCT from AD improves nowadays. Aims: We planned this study to review the recent result of alloSCT survival and to compare AD with MRD in adult acquired AA. Methods: A retrospective study comparing MRD and AD for alloSCT in patients with adult acquired AA was conducted by Korean Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation. To adjust the different clinical characteristics between donor types, we calculated propensity scores for choosing donor type. Casecontrol study comparing MRD and AD was prepared by propensity score matching. Results: Initially a total of 234 patients' data was collected from 15 Korean institutions. One PRCA and 8 PNH patients were included in primary data but these patients were removed from this analysis. Finally 225 adult patients who had AA and had received alloHSCT were analyzed. Univariate analysis revealed that no prior IST (P = 0.005), age at alloHSCT\u226431Y (P = 0.001), time from Dx to alloHSCT \u2264 6M (P = 0.008), RD (P = 0.002), MRD (P < 0.001), HLA full match (P = 0.019), successful engraftment (P < 0.001), no SOS (P = 0.035), no aGvHD (P = 0.005) and platelet engraftment days > 21D (P = 0.025) were signifi cant favorable factors. Multivariate analysis showed that age at alloHSCT \u2264 31Y (P < 0.001), MRD (P = 0.003), successful engraftment (P < 0.001), no aGvHD (P < 0.001) were the independent factors for longer survival. Age at diagnosis \u2264 28Y (P = 0.090), ABO compatible (P = 0.070), no SOS (P = 0.069) were marginally signifi cant favorable factors. Total 50 (each 25 patients from MRD and AD patients) were selected by propensity score matching. Median survivals of MRD and AD were 175.4 months and not reached, respectively (P = 0.514). Time to ANC engraftment (P = 0.336) and time to platelet engraftment (P = 0.705) were not different between MRD and AD. There were not statistically signifi cant difference between MRD and AD in cumulative incidence of aGcHD, cGvHD and TRM. Summary: In conclusion, our study showed that donor type was a signifi cant factor for survival in multivariate analysis. However, the differences between MRD and AD were not signifi cant in propensity score matching analysis. This might imply that AD could be considered earlier when there is no MRD in patients with AA.",

Takakura, S. Kato Tokai University Hospital (Isehara, JP) Objective: Aplastic anemia is a rare disease in children that is most commonly acquired /idiopathic and less often a hereditary disorder. The inherited bone marrow failure syndrome (BMFS) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by cytopenias usually in association with one or more physical malformations. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative treatment for patients (pts) with BMFS, however, very few results are available to make any recommendations for the pts except for classical inherited BMFS. We report the outcome of 16 unclassifi able BMFS pts with physical malformations, who were given allogeneic HSCT. Conclusion: Our study indicates that signifi cant advances have been made in the use of HSCT to treat unclassifi able inherited BMFS, but the results are less favorable in MDS patients because of transplant related complication or disease relapse. It is necessary to establish the ideal HSCT conditioning regimens for these disorders.",

Horse ALG 15 mg/kg was given for 5 days and cyclosporine (5 mg/kg) were given daily for up to 12 months or longer. Patients not responding at 180 days, were either offered a second course with rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG) in combination with CsA (n = 4), or androgens (n = 3). Results: After a median survival of 47 months (range, 4 to 128 months), nineteen patients responded and were alive (79%). The median date of the best response achieved was 15 months (range, 6 to 53 months). Twelve patients (50%) showed a complete response with normalisation of peripheral blood cell counts. Five others were considered partial responders without transfusion support (20%). Two patients were alive with trans fusion support after relapse (n = 1) or evolution to myelodysplastic syndromes (n = 1). All the four patients who received a second course of rATG + CsA were responders and only two patients responded to androgens. Evolution to paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria was rare (n = 2) but sensitive to cyclosporine. Actuarial survival was 78% at 5 years.

Afanasyev Raisa Gorbacheva Memorial Institute of Ch (St. Petersburg, RU) Acquired aplastic anemia (AA) is a serious hematologic disorder characterized by peripheral blood pancytopenia and hypocellular bone marrow. Standard treatment strategies for severe AA are immunosuppressive therapy (IST) including antithymocyte globulin (ATG) with cyclosporine A (CsA) and bone marrow transplantation. The decision of initial treatment depends largely on an availability of a HLA-identical sibling donor and patient age. We report our results in patients with severe aplastic anemia who have received bone marrow transplantation or immunosuppressive therapy as the fi rst line therapy. Materials and methods: A total of 43 patients (median age 21, range 3 to 49) were included in our study. The allogeneic matched related bone marrow transplantation has been performed to 12 patients who had the HLA-identical sibling donor (related BMT -group). If the number of previous blood transfusions was less than 20 we used conditioning treatment ATG (3 infusions of ATGAM at 30 mg/kg per day) plus cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg per day for 4 days). If the number of previous blood transfusions was more than 20 we used fl udarabine (30 mg/m2 per day for 6 days), cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg per day for 2 days) and ATG (ATGAM 20 mg/kg per day for 4 days). GvHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and methotrexate. Thirty one patients without related donor received IST consisting of antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine (IST -group). ATGAM was administered at a dose of 20 mg/kg per day for 5 days and CsA was given orally at a dose of 5 mg/kg per day. The allogeneic unrelated donor transplants were performed in four patients who did not have response after IST (unrelated BMT -group). The hematologic response was estimated in 6 months. The follow-up period was 5 years.",

Autoantibody titers were evaluated and peripheral T-and B lymphocyte subsets immunophenotyped using multicolor fl ow cytometry, including assessment of TCR Vbeta-repertoire. Findings: Clinical remissions (SLEDAI \u2264 3) could initially be achieved in all patients associated with disappearance of anti-dsDNA antibodies, recurrence of thymic na\u00efve CD31 + cD4 + T cells of FoxP3 + Tregs with a polyclonal TCR Vbeta-repertoire, and normalization of B-cell disturbances such as expansion of circulating plasma blasts. While stable long-term clinical remissions could be maintained in patients for up to 11 years after ASCT, three patients suffered a relapse of SLE: p#3 ( + 18 mo), p#4 ( + 80 mo) and p#7 ( + 36 mo). These patients showed recurrence of anti-dsDNA antibodies and ANA, in part with different specifi cities compared to baseline analysis. Flow cytometric analyses revealed an expansion of memory B cells and circulating plasma blasts and increased coexpression of Siglec-1 on monocytes preceding the fl are, and a predominance of CD45RO + memory T cells with a restricted CD4 + TCR-Vbeta-repertoire (distinct from pretransplant) and signifi cantly expansion of FoxP3 + Tregs with reduced coexpression of CD25. Conclusion: SLE-patients who are at high risk to develop lupusfl ares after immunoablation and ASCT may be identifi ed by plasma blast expansion, increasing expression-levels of Siglec-1 on monocytes as a surrogate marker for interferon-signature and expansion of CD25-FoxP3 + Tregs. The development of antinuclear antibodies with new specifi cities and a different oligoclonal TCR Vbeta-repertoire compared to pre-transplant may illustrate a de novo development of SLE rather than disease reactivation in these patients.

Peripheral AHSC were obtained by leukapheresis after mobilization with cyclophosphamide and G-CSF. BEAM + ATG conditioning was used according to EBMT guidelines. Serial samples of peripheral blood were collected before and at 1, 6, 12 and 24 months after AHSCT.

At 1 year follow-up (r. 5-39 months) 6 pts improved, one patient showed stabilization and only one patient experienced a deterioration of 0,5 point of EDSS. Base-line GEP was similar in all pts. Immediately after transplant, in all pts there were profound modifi cations of many genes and at 6-24 months after AHSCT a subset of them remained modifi ed. Particularly, CD52 was up-expressed before transplant and stayed markedly down-regulated until 12 and 24 months except in 2 pts, one of them worsening after HSCT. Conclusions: AHSCT improves clinical outcome in pts affected by severe MS. Our data demonstrates how AHSCT modulates the immune system particularly in responding pts. CD52 may have a central role in pathogenesis of severe MS. Further studies are needed in a larger controlled cohort of patients to better explain these mechanisms.",

Nademi (1), M. Slatter (1), A. Gennery (1), T. Flood (1), S. Hambleton (2) , J. Clark (1), M. Friswell (3) , H. Foster (1), A. Cant (1) Introduction: Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) following immunosuppressive conditioning and T cell depletion of the graft is \"a valuable option for individual\" children with severe autoimmune/rheumatic disease recalcitrant to currently used treatments, although recent evidence of only transient benefi t suggest this is not a curative procedure. Potentially curative allogeneic HSCT is \"generally not recommended\" and unacceptable for the paediatric rheumatology community, even for selected patients at the very severe end of the disease spectrum, as graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and transplant related mortality (TRM) are considered too high a risk [1] . Results: Our data on autologous T cell depleted HSCT in 6 children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) have been recently published [2] : 4 are long-term survivors, 3 in complete drugfree remission, 1 relapsed, and 2 died. We compare these with the results of allogeneic HSCT in 8 children with well defi ned, severe and treatment-resistant autoimmune and autoinfl ammatory diseases: systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE (1), immunodysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, Xlinked (IPEX) syndrome (3), autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) (3), complex periodic fever syndrome due to both mevalonic kinase (MVK) and TNF-receptor (TRAPS) gene mutations (1). Half received HSC from an HLA-matched sibling and half from an unrelated donor; 5/8 received modifi ed myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning. One child died; 7 achieved remission from their underlying disease: 5 are cured with 2-6 yr follow-up, 1 with slipping donor chimerism requires further treatment and 1 is still <1 yr post-HSCT. Acute GVHD was frequent but resolved with therapy. Conclusion: The benefi t-risk ratio for allogeneic HSCT using contemporary protocols in specialized centres may have surpassed T-cell-depleted autologous HSCT for severe autoimmune/rheumatic disease (1), M. Slatter (1) , D. Barge (1) , S. Hodges (1), S. Bunn (1) , J. Thomas (2) , H. Harvey (1) , S. Hambleton (3), T. Flood (1), A. Cant (1) , M. Abinun (1), A. Gennery (1) Introduction: Stem cell therapy for autoimmune diseases is rapidly developing with promising clinical results. However, it is increasingly recognized that these patients have an added propensity to develop secondary autoimmune disorders, distinct from the underlying autoimmune disease, given their genetic predisposition to autoimmunity. Methods: As part of a monocentric phase I/II clinical trial, seven patients received immunoablation with CYC and rabbit-ATG and CD34-ASCT for refractory SLE. Patients were evaluated at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-transplant and yearly thereafter, including clinical examinations, laboratory and serologic analyses and immunophenotyping of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets.",

One patient died due to early ( + 3mo) infectious complications. From the other 6 patients, three developed secondary autoimmune disorders while in stable clinical remission of SLE: Graves' disease (p#1, + 20mo), autoimmune thyreoiditis (p#2 + 23mo) and acquired factor VIII hemophilia (FVIII AH, p#7, + 9mo) with autoantibodies directed against TSH-receptor, thyroid-peroxidase and factor VIII, respectively. Flow cytometric analyses revealed a signifi cant expansion of peripheral blood CD27 + + cD20-plasma blasts during development of the secondary autoimmune diseases in case of the FVIII AH. FVIII AH was refractory to treatment with rituximab and immunoadsorption, cyclophosphamide and intravenous immunoglobulin according to the modifi ed Bonn-Malm\u00f6 protocol, but disappeared completely during SLE-reactivation with waves of newly generated plasmablasts and high titers of anti-dsDNA antibodies + 36mo after ASCT. Conclusion: We propose that the development of these primarily antibody-mediated autoimmune disorders after immunoablation and ASCT in SLE may be promoted on a genetic background through occupation of empty plasma cell niches by differentiated autoantigen-specifi c plasma cells during the phase of lymphodepletion early after immunoablation. The spontaneous disappearance of the FVIII-inhibitor during the lupus-fl are may illustrate a direct competition for plasma cell survival niches in the bone marrow with recurring \"lupus-specifi c\" plasma cells outcompeting the FVIII-inhibitor.",

(Candiolo, IT) ; (2) The fi rst studies of non-myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells transplantation (NMAHCT) in very advanced solid tumors offered evidences of the existence of a graft versus solidtumor effect. Despite these data the low overall response rate and the toxicity reported convinced the oncological community that NMAHCT should be offered only in haematological malignancies. To address these issues, we compared the rate of posttransplant events between patients affected by haematological (Hpts.) or solid malignancies (STpts.) transplanted in a state of refractory/progressive disease. We analysed data on 89 patients (64 Hpts, 25 STpts). Disease status at transplant was: responsive disease (29 pts), refractory but not progressing (22) (1), G. Papiani (2) , R. Salvioni (3) , M. Marangolo (2) , G. Rosti (4) Conclusions: The IU prognostic model for tandem HDCT did categorize our patients treated with a single HDCT cycle or low-dose intensity regimens in a very similar manner, but with inferior overall results. Tandem HDCT regimen only must be considered a major option for refractory GCTs and relapsed tumors in third-line or later therapy.",

We report mature results of adjuvant high-dose dense chemotherapy (HDDC) with epirubicin and paclitaxel and evaluate predictive features in order to identify patients who might benefi t from HDDC. Patients and methods. In a phase II feasibility study, we investigated a HDDC regimen consisting of a mobilizing course with epirubicin and paclitaxel plus fi lgrastim, followed by three high-dose courses with epirubicin (150 mg/m\u00b2), preceded by dexrazoxane and paclitaxel (400 mg/m\u00b2) with peripheral blood progenitor cell support every [16] [17] [18] [19] To fi nd factors infl uencing the effi cacy and toxicity of the high dose chemotherapy (HDC) and autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in patients with relapsed or cisplatin-resistant advanced germ cell tumors. Patients and methods: We performed 65 procedures of HDC + ASCT in 51 relapsed or refractory germ cell cancer patients. Our patient population was heavily pretreated with the median of 3 lines of previous systemic therapy and 9 cycles of cisplatin -based chemotherapy. The treatment consisted of one (in 37 patients) or two sequential (14 pts) cycles of highdose carboplatin (1500 mg/m\u00b2), etoposide (1800 mg/m\u00b2) and alkilating agent (cyclofosfamide 6,4 g/m\u00b2 during 55 procedures, ifosfamide 16 g/m\u00b2 in fi ve patients, or none in four pts) during the four consecutive days. An autologous haemopoietic stem cell infusion was performed at day 6 with the median of 2 \u00d7 10 2 / kg CD34 + cells given. Results: The most frequent kinds of non-hematological toxicity were: nausea and vomiting, alimentary tract mucositis and renal or hepatic toxicity. In eight of 65 procedures (12,3%) treatment toxicity was a direct cause of patient's death. The treatment toxicity increased with Beyer prognostic score, number of chemotherapy cycles administered in previous treatment and ECOG performance status. Responses and survivals: complete durable remission was achieved in 16 (31,37%) patients, partial -in 20 (39,215%), stable disease in two (4%). 12-months overall survival rate (OS) was equal to 58,5% , and 24-month OS -50,6%. 12-and 24-month progression free survivals (PSF) were 58% and 54,5%. The only independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) were beta-HCG level above 1000 mIu/ml and elevated AFP level before transplantation, IGCCCG prognostic group at diagnosis. Beyer prognostic score was an independent prognostic factor for PFS. Conclusion: High-dose chemotherapy can be curative for some relapsed GCT patients, however it can not be recommended for all patients. Especially those, with upfront poor prognosis (according to Beyer prognostic score), high beta-HCG levels or poor ECOG performance status do not benefi t from this kind of treatment. 3, 5, 15, 30) and the study was designed to test three cell dose levels: 1 \u00d7 10 8 , 5 \u00d7 10 8 , 2.5 \u00d7 10 9 . End points were: safety, kinetic of TALL-104 cells on ascites (if present) and peripheral blood (PB), levels of cytokines (TGF-b, GM-CSF, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IFN-g, TNF-a and -b, HGF, sIL-2R, sICAM-1) on ascites and serum, and immunological monitoring.",

Six patients had a confi rmed stable disease with a median duration of response of 5 months (3-7). Conclusion: These results show that the i.p. infusion of TALL-104 is safe. Moreover, the increased autologous cell-mediated cytotoxicity and the levels of soluble cytokines after i.p. infs indicate that TALL-104 cells may elicit potential antitumor activity and deserve further evaluation in patients with a less severe stage of disease.",

Following surgery CTL therapy was reintroduced and patient remained in stable disease with a follow up of further two years. CTL infusions have been well tolerated with no acute adverse events and no evidence of clinically signifi cant autoimmunity. Immunological monitoring demonstrated that CTL infusions could induce an increase in specifi c anti-tumor response measured in the peripheral blood. In our patient with RCC multiple antitumor CTL infusions proved safe and capable of inducing immunological response and a potential clinical benefi t. Because our immunotherapy approach involves the use of autologous whole tumor cells, it requires neither the defi nition of specifi c tumor antigens nor the presence of defi ned HLA specifi cities. For these reasons this strategy could be potentially applicable for the treatment of patients with a wide variety of solid tumors.",

Therefore, we analysed if MSC and SAHA may synergise in inhibiting T cell proliferation in vitro. In our hands, SAHA did not add to the inhibitory effect of MSC on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation. By contrast in some settings, SAHA reduced the inhibitory effect of MSC on PBMC. Subsequently, we asked if this observation may be used to improve tumorimmunological approaches as tumor stromal cells (TStrC) share several properties with MSC. Unlike in GvHD, however, inhibition of effector cell functions may be deleterious rather than benefi cial and hamper immune therapeutic approaches. Consequently, we analysed the effect of SAHA on neuroblastoma cell lines as well as primary neuroblastoma stroma cells isolated from ten pediatric patients. Neuroblastoma cell lines showed a signifi cantly reduced proliferation when treated with concentrations of SAHA exceeding 5 \u03bcM. Similar results were obtained for MSC and TStrC. TStrC displayed the same morphology as MSC isolated from bone marrow. Moreover, TStrC inhibited proliferation of Interleukin-2 and OKT3 stimulated PBMC and reduced cytotoxicity of NK cells. In these assays, the production of proinfl ammatory cytokines like Interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha were markedly reduced. When TStrC were preincubated with SAHA, the inhibitory effect on PBMC proliferation and cytotoxicity was reduced. These effects were also detectable at concentrations below 5 \u03bcM. These fi ndings suggest that SAHA may compromise the TStrC function and improve the function of tumor-infi ltrating lymphocytes. Future analyses include animal models to evaluate these effects in vivo.",

Caselli AOU Meyer (Florence, IT) Introduction: Consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy is currently used as part of the treatment program of several childhood cancer types in the attempt to reverse the poor prognosis in high-risk patients. PBSC collection requires a coordinated effort between mobilization and harvesting. The timing of the CD34 + cells count peak in the peripheral blood depends on several issues, including G-CSF stimulation and bone-marrow reactivity. In particular, patients with unaffected marrow may have a more rapid mobilization. We reviewed our experience in the timing of PBSC mobilization and collection in children with solid tumor, and focused the analysis on a comparison between patients with brain tumor versus others solid cancer types. Patients: 28 patients with solid tumor underwent PBSC mobilization; their age ranged between 1.8 months and 19 years (median, 6.9 years); the diagnosis was of brain tumor in 14 (medulloblastoma n = 7, astrocytoma n = 3, glyoma n = 2, ependimoblastoma or rhabdoid tumor, n = 1), while 14 had a non-CNS solid tumor (Neuroblastoma n = 6; Ewing Sarcoma n = 5; non-Hodgkin lymphoma n = 1; retinoblastoma n = 1; Wilms Tumor n = 1). Mobilization was induced by G-CSF 5 microgr/kg q12 hrs s.c.; PBSC harvest was usually started in the presence of a CD34 + cell count of 20/microL or more). Results: Mobilization was achieved in all patients. The time from start of G-CSF to harvesting ranged between 3 and 9 days (median, 6 days). The peak CD34 count on the day of harvest ranged between 12 and 1,840/microL. Patients with brain tumor had a mean time to harvest of 5.86 days (SD, 1.03 ; CI 2.14 to 0.43 Encouraging results of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in MDS-patients have been reported up to the age of 70 years. However, whether elderly patients with MDS should undergo HSCT is a matter of debate. We used a multistate approach to compare the outcome in elderly advanced MDS patients (aged 55-69 years) with RAEB or RAEB-t who received only best supportive care and were reported to the D\u00fcsseldorf registry (n = 137), to those who received HSCT and were reported to the EBMT(n = 246). We used left-truncation and modelling of transition probabilities to obtain estimates of survival after diagnosis; moreover scenario analyses were performed to quantify sensitivity for untestable assumptions and to estimate survival for various strategies depending on the time between diagnosis and transplant.",

Zander University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppend (Hamburg, DE) Introduction: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation after a dosereduced conditioning has become a reasonable treatment option for elderly patients with MDS/sAML. For patients with high number of blasts prior transplantation, the risk of relapse is considerably. To reduce the risk of relapse after dose-reduced allograft we performed a study using an anthracycline based induction chemotherapy (amsacrine, cytosine-arabinoside, fl udarabine) followed immediately by a reduced intensity conditioning therapy consisting of busulfan (8 mg/kg). Patients and methods: Between November 2005 and November 2008, 49 patients with MDS (n = 24), CMML (n = 8) and sAML (n = 17) and a median age of 61 years (r: 26-73) and a median number of 13% blasts were included. Stem cell source were unrelated (n = 43) or related donor (n = 6). Results: No graft failure was observed and the median time to leukocyte engraftment (> 1.0 \u00d7 10 9 /l) was only 10 days (r: 7-32). The incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease grade II to IV was 39% and of grade III / IV was 14%. Chronic GvHD was noted in 57% of the patients, which was limited in 35% and extensive in 32% of the patients. After a median follow-up of 15 months (r: 3-35) the two-years estimated disease-free and overall survival was 49% (95% CI 33-65%) and 54% (95% CI 39-69%), respectively. The 1 year cumulative incidence of treatment-related mortality was 29% (95% CI 15-43%). The 2 year cumulative incidence of relapse was 18% (95% CI 6-30%). Patients with fully matched related or unrelated donor had a better survival than patients transplanted from mismatched donor (69% vs. 37%; P = 0.06).",

Shimoni, A. Rand, N. Shem-Tov, I. Hardan, Y. Volchek, H. Maayaan, R. Yerushalmi, A. Nagler Chaim Sheba Medical Center (Tel-Hashomer, IL) Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (SCT) is a potentially curative therapy for patients (pts) with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). SCT in MDS pts who are often elderly and heavily transfused may be associated with a high incidence of nonrelapse mortality (NRM). Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) may reduced NRM, but may be associated with excess relapse rate, such that the optimal conditioning regimen is unknown. Similarly, the need for induction chemotherapy prior to SCT is controversial. We retrospectively analyzed SCT outcome of 66 pts with MDS, all with 5%-20% marrow blasts at SCT, and none had prior induction chemotherapy. In conclusion, RTC is associated with the optimal results in untreated MDS pts. Classical myeloablative conditioning may be associated with excessive NRM in these pts, while RIC may result in excessive relapse rate. Induction chemotherapy may be needed prior to RIC, but can probably be avoided when using more intensive regimens. Treosulfan-based conditioning was associated with favorable toxicity profi le and improved anti-MDS activity.",

Umbilical cord blood, an alternative stem cell source, has been used increasingly for the treatment of patients with various hematological diseases, but its use in patients with MF is extremely limited. Here we summarize registry data in 10 patients with de novo MF who received fi rst cord blood transplantation (CBT) through the Japan Cord Blood Bank Network. The median age was 57 years (range, 43-79), and median body weight was 54 kg (range, 34-63). The median time from diagnosis to transplantation was 6 months (range, 2-22).

Eight patients (80%) received regimens including fl udarabine with or without reduced total body irradiation (\u2264 8 Gy). As a prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), seven patients (70%) received a tacrolimus with or without short-term methotrexate. All patients received a single cord blood unit including total nuclear cells of 2.6 \u00d7 10 7 /kg of patient's body weight (range, 1.7-3.6 \u00d7 10 7 /kg) with 0 to 2 HLA mismatches. Eight patients (80%) were successfully engrafted with an absolute neutrophil count \u2265 500/\u03bcl by a median of day23 (range, 17-26). Five patients (50%) achieved reticulocyte engraftment (\u2265 1%), and three patients (30%) achieved platelet engraftment (\u2265 50,000/\u03bcl). In eight evaluable patients, fi ve patients (63%) developed acute GVHD; 2 patients had grade I, 2 had grade II, and 1 had grade IV. Four patients were alive at the last follow-up, with a median survival follow-up of 12 months (range, . They included three patients in whom sustained engraftment of three lineages was achieved. The most frequent causes of death in six patients were bacterial or fungal infections, and no patient died of progressive disease. The probability of overall survival at 2 years for 10 patients was 36 \u00b1 16% (Kaplan-Meier).",

The costs of P use starting on the fi fth night in those patients with poor CD34 counts was more than offset by the fewer apheresis days needed. Based on this data we have now changed our algorithm for those who appear to be poor mobilizers. We now check CD34 counts on day 4 of G CSF therapy. Those with a peripheral CD34 count < 8, receive Plerixafor that evening and are collected the following day. Despite the high upfront cost of Plerixafor this is more then offset by the fewer days of apheresis and growth factors. Such an approach allows patients to proceed more effi ciently to transplant without the need for chemomobilization in patients who have no clinical reason to receive chemotherapy.

The Network is centrally managed through an executive committee of elected clinical representatives with a BMT Network Manager and a central and shared basis of 3 Quality Managers with a common document control system linked to all laboratories. The goals of the Laboratory Network Group were set to work collectively as a group to publish data, develop optimum SOPs and produce high quality validation reports, and meet other required criteria to meet national and international regulatory standards. The group meet every three months for meetings and participate an on-going education programme. This prepares the 9 laboratories to meet the demanding standards for accreditation for HPC processing and storage from a combined networking group, and not individually as a single facility. The Network has implemented Q-Pulse for quality management software to aid in meeting the standards applicable to BMT collection, processing and infusion. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been developed and are generated as either generic documents to be released to all relevant facilities or, if consensus is not attained, as site-specifi c documents for release to individual facilities. Laboratories are also using the non-conformance and corrective/preventative action modules of Q-Pulse shared across all labs. The group are about to initiate a common audit programme for labs to be used across the network.",

Methods: The study material consisted of 22 frozen autologous PBSC transplant units (approx. 100 ml containing 10% dimethyl sulphoxide) from 11 patients and 2 units from an allogeneic PBSC donor which were no longer needed for patients' treatment. As a consequence thereof, 12 pairs (2 identical units from each person) could be used throughout the study. After thawing both units of a pair, one unit was transferred into the \"A\" bag. This bag was sealed in a corresponding overwrap bag which provides additional safety regarding a potential cross contamination during cryogenic storage. The other unit remained in the original \"B\" bag. After re-freezing both units at approx. -1\u00b0C/min, all units were stored again for 8 to 59 days (on an average for 37 days) under cryogenic conditions using liquid nitrogen. Because of the insulation provided by the additional overwrap bag in the case of the \"A\" bag, the thawing time in the shaking water bath was extended from 3 min to 5 min to allow for a complete thaw. Results: We found an excellent correlation between the 2 bag types based on the following parameters: cell concentration, percentages of mononuclear cells, lymphocytes, monocytes, membrane integrity, hematocrit, concentration of total hemoglobin, concentration of \"free\" hemoglobin, and hemolysis rate. With regard to clonogenicity as measured in terms of the total, BFU-E, and CFU-GM number of colony forming units in a semi-solid cell culture assay, there were no signifi cant differences for all 3 parameters depending on the bag type ( student's paired t-test).",

It is also important to be certain that these procedures can be carried out within the existing infrastructure of hospitals with requisite expertise. There is a lack dedicated HSCT units equipped with special air-handling facilities and high-effi ciency particulate air (HEPA) fi lter rooms. It is important to ascertain the safety of performing allogenic HSCT in single rooms without HEPA fi lters. Aim of study: To evaluate the short and long term outcomes of allogenic HSCT performed in non-HEPA fi ltered single rooms. , Systemic antibiotics were used in 88% and antifungal in 52% cases. The 30-day mortality was 3 (4.7%), and 100-day mortality was 5 (7.8%). After day 100, there were seventeen fatalities (26.5%) due to chronic GVHD-5, relapse-2, graft rejection-2, infections like disseminated tuberculosis-1 and aspergillosis-3, Veno-occlusive disease (VOD)-2 and platelet refractoriness leading to intracranial bleed-2. Conclusion: Our experience suggests that availability of dedicated BMT unit with special air handling equipment should not be considered a critical and essential precondition for providing allogeneic HSCT who would otherwise succumb to potentially curable hematological diseases.",

We studied 74 patients who underwent allogeneic transplantation for AML in a single centre from 2004-2008. The median age was 47.1 years (range: 20.8-70.1) .Overall survival was 48% at 2 years (median follow-up:1.96 years). 37 patients had myeloablative conditioning and 37 had reduced intensity. 46 patients had T cell depletion. MRD analysis by MFC (sensitivity 0.04%) in the bone marrow was performed pre-transplant and on day 28 and 100 post-transplant. By conventional criteria, 47 patients were in CR1, 15 in CR2, 4 in CR > 2 and 8 patients were not in CR pre-transplant. We examined the impact of MRD by MFC in patients who were in CR. Survival at 2 years in MRD negative (MRD-) patients pre-transplant was 70% compared to 29% in MRD positive (MRD + ) patients (P = 0.003). The MRD analysis at day 28 was not predictive of outcome. In patients alive and without relapse at day 100, MRD analysis was predictive of outcome (2 year: MRD-70% vs. 27% MRD + ; P = 0.045). In patients who were MRD-at both time-points, survival at 2 years was 81% compared to 42% in those who were MRD + at one or both time-point (P = 0.040). The incidence of disease relapse was 32% at 2 years and non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 8% at day 100 and 22% at 1 year. The pre-transplant stage was predictive of relapse (2 years: those in CR 28% (no difference for CR1 or > CR1) compared to those not in CR 63%, P = 0.004) but being MRD + was not; neither pretransplant (P = 0.47) nor at day 100 (P = 0.29). Conversely, the NRM was signifi cantly higher in those who were MRD + pretransplant, but not at day 100. There was a trend to a higher incidence of acute GvHD in the pre-transplant MRD + patients (50%) compared to MRD-patients (33%, P = 0.074). In multivariate analysis at day 100 there was a RR of NRM of 2.12 (P = 0.014; 95% CI 1.1-3.8 ) to MRD + patients. Pre-transplant MRD appears to be predictive of worse outcome. Interestingly this seems largely due to an increase in NRM rather than disease relapse which may refl ect differences in the duration and/or intensity of GVHD prophylaxis. A better understanding of these factors may allow tailored treatment strategies based on MRD status.",

Urbano-Ispizua Hospital Virgen del Roc\u00edo (Seville, ES) Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease with several clinical and biological prognostic features. Detection of residual leukemic cells after chemotherapy (minimal residual disease; MRD) is related to risk of relapse. The role of stem cell transplant (SCT) in patients with MRDpositive (MRD + ) is still unclear. Objective: Analyse the impact of MRD status in AML pts in complete remission (CR) who underwent SCT. Patients and methods: 83 AML pts in CR received SCT (auto-SCT = 30, alloSCT = 53) in 2001-09 period. Baseline characteristics of pts shown in table 1. Quantitation of MRD was performed by fl ow cytometric detection of abnormal phenotypes after induction and consolidation. MRD after consolidation therapy was used for analysis. 0.01% level was defi ned to identify MRD + pts. Statistical analyses were performed by SPSS v. 16 for survival and R package software for relapse risk. Results: 55 pts are alive (66%). Relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were 70% vs. 44% (P = 0.022 ) and 75% vs. 52% (P = 0.029) in MRD-and MRD + pts respectively. Globally (auto and alloSCT), MRD + was associated to shorter RFS (P = 0.053, HR:2.1; CI:0.9-4.7), OS (P = 0.045, HR:2.4; CI: 1.02-5.74 ) and higher relapse risk (P = 0.04, HR:2.2) in multivariate analysis. Pts who achieved MRD-had better prognosis with relapse rate of 22% after alloSCT (5/23 pts) and 36% after autoSCT (4/11 pts). Of MRD + pts who received autoSCT (n = 19), 13/19 pts relapsed (68.5%). In the allogeneic setting (30 pts MRD + and 20 pts MRD-), only 12/30 MRD + pts (40%) experienced relapse. MRD + in alloSCT was associated to shorter OS in univariate (P = 0.05) and multivariate analysis (P = 0.021, HR: 5.82 ; CI: 1.3-26.3 ) and a trend to lower RFS (P = 0.064).",

Candoni, E. Toffoletti, R. Gallina, E. Simeone, S. Volpetti, M. Chiozzotto, R. Fanin University Hospital (Udine, IT) WT1 is well-known to be a panleukemic marker that is expressed in 90% of acute myeloid leukemias (AML). Quantifi cation of WT gene expression in bone marrow (BM) samples may be useful as a marker of minimal residual disease (MRD). We evaluated the validity of this AML-MRD marker after Reduce Intensity Conditioning (RIC) allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT). The quantitative assessment of WT1 expression by Real-Time Quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) was measured in 25 AML patients (pts) at diagnosis, at the time of RIC-SCT and after transplant at precise time points. All cases showed high WT1 levels at diagnosis with a mean of 4895 (SD 4462) and a median of 3679 (range 454-16853) copies WT1/104 ABL. At transplant 18/25 pts (72%) were in Complete cytologic Remission (CcR) and 7/25 (28%) had refractory AML. At the pre-SCT evaluation, bone marrow (BM) samples from pts transplanted in CcR showed signifi cantly lower WT1 expression levels compared to the samples from pts with refractory AML (P = 0.002). Median follow up after RIC-SCT was 18 months (range 2-54). On 18 pts transplanted in CcR, those (17/18) who maintained CcR after RIC-SCT displayed WT1 copy numbers persistently low during all the follow-up period. In patients who received RIC-SCT with active disease obtaining a sustained CcR after transplant (3/25), WT1 levels decreased to normal range in the fi rst two months after RIC-SCT and remained low through the entire study period. All pts who relapsed after RIC-SCT (4/25) had a high WT1 copy number before the cytologic relapse. In 50% of these cases, an increase in WT1 expression was documented before molecular chimerism decreasing. With this experience, taking into account the limited number of pts, we confi rmed a concordance between WT1 expression levels (measured by RQ-PCR at precise and sequential time points) and status of AML before and after RIC-SCT and we found a concordance between WT1 expression levels and hematopoietic chimerism status. Our data suggest that, in the RIC-SCT setting, the sequential and quantitative analysis of WT1 may be useful as a leukemia marker for monitoring MRD and as a predictor of overt cytologic relapse.",

Eighteen children had an MRD level \u2265 1 \u00d7 10-4 in bone marrow and were, therefore, eligible for an allo-immune intervention, consisting of early cyclosporine A tapering (4-5 weeks postSCT) followed by consecutive, incremental donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI; n = 1-4). The intervention was well tolerated and associated with GvHD \u2265 grade II in only 23% of patients who all responded to steroids. Relapse-free survival (RFS) in the intervention group was 22%. However, in contrast with the usual early recurrence of leukemia, relapses were delayed up to 3 years after SCT. In addition, relapses presented at unusual extramedullary sites suggesting that the immune intervention may have altered the pattern of leukemia recurrence. RFS in the conventionally treated MRD negative group (n = 30) was similar to that reported in previous studies (RFS: 69%). In 8 out of 11 evaluable patients, relapse was preceded by MRD recurrence (median 9 weeks, range 0-30). We conclude that in children with high-risk ALL, immunotherapy based regimens postSCT are feasible and may need to be further intensifi ed to achieve total eradication of residual leukemic cells.",

Ciceri San Raffaele (Milan, IT) Introduction: Various approaches have been used in AML and MDS patients (pts), to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and predict the risk of relapse, but still the majority of AML cases do not have a useful and sensitive MRD marker. Over-expression of Wilms' tumor gene 1 (WT1) in leukemic blasts has been reported in > 80% of AML and > 40% of MDS. Normal hematopoietic stem cells express WT1, but a malignant WT1 expression can be distinguished based on quantitative detection methods such as RQ-PCR; the sensitivity of this assay permit to detect leukemic cells in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) with frequencies as low as 10-3 and 10-5, respectively. We are currently monitoring WT1 in SP and BM after allogeneic HSCT to drive post transplant proper immunotherapy. Aim: To evaluate if WT1 expression levels can be a useful marker of MRD after allogeneic HSCT. Materials and methods: 26 AML and 6 MDS pts received an allogeneic HSCT in our Institute between 12/2007 and 11/2009. RQ-PCR quantifi cation of WT1 was performed in samples of PB and BM at diagnosis, monthly after HSCT, using TaqMan technology on RNA from mononucleated cells. The housekeeping gene ABL was used as the control gene for these quantifi cations with WT1 level being normalised to 104 copies of ABL per sample. Results: WT1 at diagnosis: median 6960.02 cp (77.98-31203.57 ). At HSCT 22 pts (68%) were in CR and 10 (31%) had active disease, with a median WT1 of 82.74 (0.67-5064.91) and 829.94 (44.14-10649.56 ), respectively. Myeloablative conditioning regimen: Treosulfan 42 g/sqm, Fludarabine 150 mg/ sqm, ATG 30 mg/kg (HSCT from alternative donors). After HSCT 31 pts were in CR, 9 with active disease before HSCT, with median WT1 = 37.21 (11.46-772.92 ). Three pts with low levels of WT1 after HSCT showed a logarimtic increase of WT1 expression only in BM \u2264 1 month before hematological relapse; concomitant analysis showed an haematologic and cytogenetic CR with 100% donor chimerism (STR). Only 1 pt relapsed with a signifi cant, non logarithmic, increase of WT1 levels. Conclusions: These data show that WT1 could be a useful nonspecifi c leukemia marker for monitoring of MRD in AML and MDS pts after allogeneic HSCT. WT1 logaritmic increase in PB and BM can detect molecular relapse, driving post transplant immunotherapy (immunosuppression withdrawal, donor lymphocyte infusion, etc.) to induce an anti-leukemia effect at an early stage of disease.",

Messina, C. Tresoldi, A. Crotta, M. Tassara, S. Malato, J. Peccatori, C. Corti, F. Ciceri, M. Bernardi San Raffaele (Milan, IT) Introduction: ASCT is a curative option alternative to allogeneic transplantation for pts with AML; unfortunately, the relapse rate after ASCT is high and can be due to contamination with leukemic blasts of autologous PBSC collected by leukapheresis, although these procedures are usually performed when pts are in proved complete remission (CR). Thus, identifi cation and quantifi cation of a reliable minimal residual disease marker in collected PBSC could be relevant in determining the relapse risk after ASCT. High levels of the WT1 gene transcript in bone marrow and peripheral blood of AML pts after treatment completion predict disease relapse. We retrospectively evaluated the WT1 transcript levels in autologous PBSC of our AML pts who received an ASCT to establish the power of this parameter to predict the risk of AML relapse. Aim: To correlate the quantitative levels of WT1 in autologous PBSC with the relapse incidence in AML patients who received an ASCT in CR, at our Institute. Patients and methods: 10 pts, all in morphological and genetic CR at the time of PBSC collection and before ASCT. PBSC collection by leukapheresis (COBE Spectra cell separator): median CD34 + \u00d7 10 6 /kg: 9.32 (3.79-32). RQ-PCR quantifi cation of WT1 was performed in samples of each leukapheresis, using TaqMan technology on RNA from mononucleated cells. The housekeeping gene ABL was used as the control gene for these quantifi cations with WT1 level being normalised to 104 copies of ABL per sample. Conditioning regimen: treosulfan 10 gr/sqm \u00d7 3, fl udarabine 30 mg/sqm \u00d7 5 cytarabine 2 gr/sqm \u00d7 5. Transplant, median CD34 + \u00d7 10 6 /kg: 5.1 (3.3-8.5) . Results: At last follow-up 4 pts have relapsed after ASCT. Median WT1 copies in leukapheresis of pts who relapsed or did not relapse were 486.65 (89.96-839.63 ) and 26.66 (4.79-82.49 ), respectively. Overall median relapse free survival (RFS) from ASCT was 451 (76-1197) days; median RFS of pts with WT1 copies > 90 (n = 3) or \u2264 90 (n = 7) was 351 (93-368) and 669 (76-1197) days (log-rank P = 0.003), respectively. Conclusions: These results suggest the possibility to determine a quantitative cut-off level of WT1 transcripts in autologous PBSC, with higher levels being predictive of contamination with leukemic blasts and indicating an increased relapse risk after ASCT. These data, if confi rmed by our ongoing studies, will permit us to discriminate pts who can benefi t from ASCT from pts who should be addressed to different therapeutic strategies.",

MRD measured by RQ-PCR amplifi cation of IgH and IgK-Kde gene rearrangements was performed at specifi c time-points before BMT. MRD groups were defi ned as per Bader P. et. al., JCO 2009 : group 1 (undetectable MRD load), group 2 (MRD load less than the quantitative range (< 10-4 leukemic cells), group 3 (MRD load between \u2265 10-4 leukaemia cells and less than 10-3 leukaemia cells), group 4 (MRD load \u2265 10-3 leukaemia cells). Duration of sustained MRD pre-BMT was grouped into > 90 and \u2264 90 days. There were 17 BMTs and 15 were evaluable (2 had no MRD markers). The median age at BMT was 9.3 (range, 1.3 -13.6) years and the median time to BMT was 298 (range, 88 -1327) days with 7 patients in CR1, 6 in CR2 and 2 in CR3. Median duration of sustained MRD level pre-BMT was 88 (range, 7 -760) days. There were 7 patients in MRD group 2, 6 in MRD group 3, 2 in MRD group 4 and none in MRD group 1. At a median follow-up of 2.4 (range, 0.3-5.6 ) years, the overall survival (OS) was 86.7% for the entire cohort. OS and relapse-free survival (RFS) for MRD group 2 was 100% and 80%, respectively. For combined MRD groups 3 and 4, OS and RFS were 75% and 57%, respectively. In the patients who relapsed, the duration of sustained MRD level pre-BMT was shorter (Figure 1) . Logistic regression analysis further showed that duration of MRD \u2264 90 days (regardless of MRD group), predicted relapse, except in patients who developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) ( Table 1) . We verifi ed the fi ndings of recently published data that MRD level pre-BMT predicted outcome. Further, we observed that sustained MRD level with duration > 90 days pre-BMT, and more importantly, the presence of GVHD predicted a lower relapse risk even in patients with high MRD levels pre-BMT.",

            "text": "Background: Recently, monitoring of the minimal residual disease (MRD) load with quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) for the nucleophosmin (NPM1) mutations of the subtype A in pts with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was developed for the posttransplant setting. Also, we perform regular chimerism analyses using our established sensitive qPCR techniques. Due to the rapid kinetics of AML relapse, short intervals for post-transplant monitoring are desirable, which requires analysis from peripheral blood (PB). We compared qPCR results for the NPM1Amut and chimerism in bone marrow (BM) and PB in the post-transplant period. Patients: 21 pts with NPM1A mutated AML (10 males, 11 females, 21-70 yrs) were included after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). 12 pts had a concomitant FLT3-ITD. NPM1Amut levels were quantifi ed with a dilution curve from the OCI/AML1 cell line and normalized for DNA content with HCK. Chimerism was assessed by qPCR for short insertions/ deletions polymorphisms or Y-specifi c sequences for sexmismatched SCT. Analyses were performed in parallel from unseparated PB and BM within different periods post-transplant (days + 13 to 1337). Results: 8 pts (38%) were negative for the NPM1Amut in PB and BM. 13 pts (62%) tested positive for the NPM1Amut in BM, in 10 cases combined with positive results in PB. In 5/10 with positive PCR results in both materials, the mutation level was higher in BM than in PB (1-3 log scales). Thus, results were discordant in 3 cases (14%), as the PB was negative for the NPM1Amut while BM was weakly positive. Cases with at least 0.2% NPM1Amut level in the BM were always positive in PB. Chimerism analysis was possible in 18 pts. 8/18 (44%) had complete (\u2265 99.9%) donor chimerism (DC) in BM and PB. In 4/18 (22%), mixed chimerism (MC) was detected in both materials (55.6%-99.7% DC). 1/18 (6%) had loss of chimerism in PB and low donor chimerism (39.7%) in BM. Thus, BM and PB were concordant in 13/18 (78%). In 3/18 (17%), PB showed DC while the BM showed MC; in one case, it was the other way around. Conclusion: qPCR monitoring for the NPM1mut and chimerism from unseparated PB contributes to post-transplant surveillance in AML. We suggest investigation of PB after SCT in short time intervals (e.g. every other week) within the fi rst 2 years. In case of negative results in the PB, BM analysis might be performed in longer intervals (e.g. every 3 months), but should be done immediately in case of positive PCR results in PB.",

Mattsson Karolinska Institutet (Stockholm, SE) A retrospective analysis was performed in 118 patients with hematological malignancies who received donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT). The overall incidences of acute GVHD grades I-II and grades III-IV acute GVHD were 33% and 8.5%, respectively. Probability of chronic GVHD was 33%. Pancytopenia developed in three patients. Patients with acute leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome showed a three-year survival of 42% if DLI treatment was given due to molecular relapse, compared to 16% in haematological relapse (P < 0.006). In multivariate analysis, response to DLI correlated with non-hematological relapse (Odds ratio (OR) 11.1, P = 0.0001), chronic GVHD (OR 4.3, P = 0.01), and late relapse (OR 4.1, P = 0.016). The development of acute or chronic GVHD did not signifi cantly infl uence the response of DLI in patients with molecular/cytogenetic relapse. However, the development of chronic GVHD was signifi cantly correlated to a better response in patients with hematological relapse since only 4 of 29 patients without chronic GVHD responded compared to 7 of 12 with chronic GVHD (P = 0.007). The development of chronic GVHD increased signifi cantly if DLI was given > 12 months after ASCT (46% vs. 27%, P = 0.04). In contrast, time between ASCT and start of DLI treatment did not signifi cantly infl uence the risk of developing acute GVHD. To conclude, monitoring of leukemia-lineage specifi c chimerism is of utmost importance for DLI response after ASCT.",

Fritsch (1) Introduction: Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and NK-cells (CTL/ NK) induce apoptosis in malignant cells mainly employing the granzyme B (GrB) pathway. This mechanism constitutes the effector stage of the graft versus leukemia reaction (GvL). We recently reported resistance against GrB induced apoptosis in leukemia cells. One candidate to mediate GrB resistance is the endogenously expressed protease inhibitor 9 (PI-9). Aim of this study was to determine the PI-9 expression in leukemic cells and the infl uence of expression levels on the activity of GrB directly. Methods and results: We assessed the proteolytic activity of GrB with the colorimetric substrate Ac-IEPD-pNA in PI-9 negative and positive cells and consequently the activation of caspase 3, which is the main downstream target of GrB. We identifi ed PI-9 negative, intermediate and high expressing cell lines. The lymphoblastic cell line Jurkat and the myeloblastic cell line U937 did not express PI-9, while PI-9 expression was high in lymphoblastic Daudi cells, a cell line from a patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML-R) and a U937 subline (U937PI-9 + ). Myeloblastic K562 cells and two EBV lymphoblastic cell lines (LCL) expressed PI-9 low to intermediatly. When cells were treated with cell permeable GrB, the intracytoplasmatic GrB activity was inversely correlated to the PI-9 expression level of the respective cells. To verify the infl uence on apoptosis we measured caspase 3 activation following GrB treatment. Caspase 3 activation was also inversely correlated to the level of PI-9 expression. Discussion: In conclusion, we show that PI-9 is a potent inhibitor of GrB. The level of resistance to GrB in leukemia cells is positively correlated to the level of PI-9 expression. This mechanism may be important for immune evasion of leukemia cells in vivo and could mediate resistance to GvL.",

Leiblein, V. Vucinic, W. P\u00f6nisch, H.K. Al-Ali, N. Basara, D. Niederwieser, T. Lange University of Leipzig (Leipzig, DE) Objectives: SCT after reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) is routinely used as a curative approach for older and medically impaired patients (pts) with hematological malignancies. Graft rejection (GR) occurs in approximately 5% to 8% of pts and raises many clinical questions. In order to address these points, the outcome of pts with GR after haematopoetic stem cell transplantation (SCT) with 2 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) in combination with or without fl udarabine followed by CsA and MMF was analyzed retrospectively. Patients and methods: A total of 380 pts underwent allogeneic SCT using a low-dose TBI based preparative regimen at the University of Leipzig between 1998 and 2007. Of these pts, 30 (7.9%) were identifi ed as having either primary (n = 25) or secondary GR (n = 5), defi ned as T-cell chimerism < 10% donor cells. Pts received a transplant from related (n = 3) or unrelated (n = 27) donors as treatment for AML (n = 11), for Ph + cML (n = 5), for MDS/MPS (n = 5), for multiple myeloma or NHL (n = 5), for ALL (n = 2), for PNH (n = 1) and for solid tumor (n = 1). Results: From the 30 pts with GR, 5 (17%) developed no and 17 (56%) self limiting neutropenia < 1000 WBC/\u03bcl with a median duration of 25 (range: 7-69) days. 5 further patients (17%) recovered after a 2nd allogeneic HCT only and 3 pts (10%) died in neutropenia. Thrombocytopenia < 50,000/\u03bcl was observed in 23 pts (77%), of which 13 (43%) had spontaneous platelet recovery after a median of 31 (range: 10-69) days. 7 pts (23%) recovered after the 2nd HCT and 3 pts (10%) died before platelet recovery. The majority of the patients (n = 17; 57%) underwent 2nd HCT after a median of 71 (range 40-1143) days after the 1st SCT using the same (n = 1) or another unrelated (n = 16) donor. 13 pts (76%) showed engraftment, 2 (11%) died of TRM and 5 of relapse (30%) after a median of 171 (range 92-1835) days. The 1-, 2-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) for this group was 71%, 64%, and 43%, respectively. The 1-, 2-, and 5-year OS for pts without a 2nd transplant (n = 13; 43%) was 45%, 18%, and 18% after a median obsrvation time of 149 (range 40-844) days, respectively. Conclusion: Patients with GR showed hematological recoveries ranging from no to spontaneous recovery in this minimal S192 intensive conditioning regimen. The second transplant was successful in the vast majority of patients, with TRM in the range of the fi rst transplant: The OS of pts with a second transplant was better than those without. Therefore a 2nd SCT should be urgently considered after GR.",

Nikolousis (1), F. Clark (1) , C. Brookes (1) , S. Nagra (1), S. Jeffries (2) , M. Cook (1), P. Mahendra (1) Reduced intensity allografts are used to deliver a GvL effect in older patients with haematological malignancies and a concomitant reduction in the incidence of GvHD. The presence of mixed T cell chimerism posttransplant is indicative of bidirectional haematology outcome and could be predictive for disease relapse. The main curative mechanism is a potent GvL effect and the use of chimerism is the way to determine the percentage of graft cells present. We have therefore analysed the T cell chimeric status of 133 patients with a median age of 50 years undergoing a reduced intensity Alemtuzumab conditioning regimen for lymphoid (64) and myeloid (69) malignancies and correlated this to the transplant outcomes(overall survival, disease free survival, acute and chronic GvHD). The median follow up was 23 months (range 5-108 months). 77 had a sibling transplant and 56 had an unrelated transplant. 82 patients were in CR at the time of transplant and 51 had PR. Patients with mixed T chimerism at 90 days were almost 80% less likely to have acute GVHD than patients with full donor T cell chimerism (P = 0.0004). There were no other statistically signifi cant differences between T cell full donor and mixed chimerism patients observed and T cell chimeric status at 90 days was not infl uential of OS, DFS, relapse free survival or incidence of chronic GVHD in the multivariate setting. Mixed T cell chimerism however, was still associated with a reduction in the incidence of acute GVHD when also accounting for other signifi cant factors, conditioning regimen and disease type. Multivariate analysis of T cell chimerism at day + 180 and outcome found a signifi cant association with chronic GVHD. Patients with mixed chimeric status at 180 days were less likely to have chronic GVHD when also adjusting for CR status at transplant. Despite the inclusion of other prognostic factors chimeric status did not infl uence either OS or DFS or relapse free survival times. Analysis of chimeric status split by disease type lymphoid and myeloid produced identical results. Our study showed that T cell chimerism on day + 90 and + 180 was not predictive of disease relapse and overall survival indicating that probably disease specifi c factors and pretransplant chemosensitivity could play a more important role in disease relapse. Future studies which could potentially look into T cell chimerism beyond this time points and higher number of patients might be needed to correlate these results with our study.",

Anguita, A. Gomez-Pineda, J.L. D\u00edez-Mart\u00edn, I. Bu\u00f1o Hopital General Universitario Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n (Madrid, ES) Introduction: Chimerism quantifi cation is useful for the follow up of patients after allogenic stem cell transplantation (Allo-SCT) mostly if performed in purifi ed leukocyte lineages. Regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg; CD4 + /CD25 + ) have shown to promote donor-recipient tolerance after SCT. Objective: To analyze the dynamics of chimerism in Treg, compared to that of peripheral blood (PB) and CD3 + T lymphocytes. Patients and Methods: The study included 53 Allo-SCT (18 non-myeloablative and 35 myeloablative, including 14 from MUD). Stem cell source was PB in 44, umbilical cord blood in 5, bone marrow in 4. Chimerism analysis was performed every 2 weeks in PB, Tcells and Treg until complete chimerism (CC) was achieved, and in PB at specifi c time points ( + 30, + 60, + 90, + 180, + 365 and every 6 months) thereafter. Follow up was censored at the moment of rejection, relapse, DLI or 2nd Allo-SCT. Isolation of CD3 + Tcells and CD4 + /CD25 + Treg was performed by inmunomagnetic means (Miltenyi Biotec) from mononuclear cells obtained by gradient centrifugation of 1 \u00d7 10 7 PB cells for each procedure. Chimerism was quantifi ed by STR-PCR revealed by capillary electrophoresis (AmpFlSTR SG Plus, Applied Biosystems). Considering that > 95% purity is obtained by immunomagnetic selection of these cell subsets, as determined by fl ow cytometry, samples with \u2265 5% of recipient cells were defi ned as in mixed chimerism (MC). Results: Figure 1 shows the dynamics of CC achievement within the fi rst year post-SCT in blood, CD3 + Tcells and CD4 + / CD25 + Treg in 49 patients (4 patients censored due to early relapse or rejection). Time to CC in Tregs was longer (mean of 42 d) in Tregs than in Tcells (38 d) or PB (35 d). Therefore, not only patients with CC in PB and mixed chimerism in leukocyte lineages, but also patients with complete chimerism in PB and Tcells while the Treg subset maintained mixed chimerism (n = 5) were observed. 3 patients maintained MC in PB, Tcells and Tregs beyond day + 100 without evidence of graft rejection or disease relapse. Conclusion: Chimerism dynamics in Tregs correlates with that of Tcells, although time to CC is longer in Tregs. Some patients show MC in Tregs once both PB and Tcells have achieved CC. The analysis of a larger patient cohort would allow to get insight into the possible association between such observations and the development of complications after SCT.",

            "text": "Soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) is an immunosuppressive molecule involved in maternal acceptance of the foetus during pregnancy S193 and intrauterine growth. In this setting, sHLA-G abrogates maternal NK cell activity against foetal tissue establishing immunotolerance at the maternal-foetal interface. In heart transplantation, high sHLA-G levels have been correlated to low incidence of severe rejection and good prognosis. In haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation, sHLA-G is advocated in the prevention of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). As cord blood (CB) is associated to lower incidence of GvHD than other HSC sources, it could be reasonable that this is due (at least in part) to high pregnancy-related sHLA-G levels in CB, which is obtained at time of birth of the infant donor. All HLA-G isoforms are encoded by a HLA class Ib gene. As the insertion of 14 bp in the 3'UTR of the HLA-G gene has been associated to low sHLA-G levels, we investigated the correlation between sHLA-G concentration and HLA-G genotype in CB. For this purpose we retrospectively considered 29 CB units of the Pavia CB Bank cryopreserved from 2003 to 2005. sHLA-G concentration was determined on thawed aliquots of CB plasma (stored in the same conditions of the cords) by sHLA-G ELISA kit (Exbio, Praha, Czech Republic) and 14bp HLA-G genotyping was performed by PCR. 11 samples showed the + 14bp/ + 14bp, 9 the -14bp/ + 14bp and 9 the -14bp/-14bp genotype, respectively. sHLA-G concentration was 46.6, 36.9 and 33.7 ng/mL on average in the + 14bp/ + 14bp, -14bp/ + 14bp and -14bp/-14bp genotype groups, respectively (see the graphic). No statistically signifi cant variability was observed in CB sHLA-G concentration according to the foetal 14bp HLA-G genotype. However, the detection of appreciable levels of sHLA-G supports the hypothesis of a particular microenvironment stimulating sHLA-G secretion in CB. Despite the time (ranging from 4 to 6 years) and conditions of storage (-190\u00b0C, in liquid nitrogen), detectable levels of sHLA-G can be demonstrated in CB also after long-term storage. If confi rmed this fi nding will suggest an inversion to the actual trend of storing CB units after removal of plasma for volume reduction, in order to preserve their benefi cial sHLA-G content. Further investigations are needed to increase sample size and identify the mechanisms of sHLA-G expression in CB.",

            "text": "Monocytes (Mo), macrophages (Mph) and dendritic cells (DC) are commonly regarded as discrete cell types with Mo, Mph being components of the innate immune system, and DC acting at the interface with the adaptive immune system. All three have been suggested to be essentially involved in modulating immune responses. The expression and activity of the tryptophan metabolizing enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) has been proposed as a critical mechanism in down-regulating T cell responses and the induction of tolerance. IDO has been described to be active in Mo, Mph and DC with interferongamma (IFN-g) constituting a potent inducer of IDO. Since we aim to create a stable in vitro culture system to generate allospecifi c tolerant T cells, we investigated potential differences in IDO protein expression and enzymatic activity. Using human blood cells, Mo were identifi ed as CD14 + cells and were differentiated into Mph and DC by culture with M-CSF and with IL-4/GM-CSF, respectively. The stimulation of Mo, Mph and DC with IFN-g \u00b1 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in cell surface expression of MHC class I and II, and of co-stimulatory molecules CD80/86 in either cell population with minor differences. IFN-g was critical for inducing IDO expression in either cell type, but IDO enzymatic activity was profoundly different. Upon a 48-hour stimulation period DC completely (> 95%) depleted the cell culture medium of tryptophan, while Mo and Mph showed only about 50% tryptophan consumption. Furthermore, DC displayed sustained enzymatic IDO activity after removal of LPS and IFN-g, whereas Mo and Mph lost the ability to metabolize tryptophan in re-cultures. This data clearly show that IFN-g can induce potent and sustained IDO activity in DC and, thus, underscore the recently questioned difference in cell biology of DC and Mph (Hume DA, 2008). Furthermore, they identify DC as promising candidates to fully exploit the potential of the tolerogenic potential of an accelerated tryptophan metabolism to specifi cally eliminate and regulate allo-reactive T cells (supported by Austrian Science Foundation P#20865). F. Colnaghi, E. Elli, M. Parma, A. Colombo, P. Pioltelli, E. Terruzzi, G. Cazzaniga, A. Biondi, E.M. Pogliani Ospedale S. Gerardo (Monza, IT) Introduction: Analysis of Short Tandem Repeats (STR) polymorphism is actually the widely employed assay for evaluation and quantifi cation of Chimerism Status (CS) after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). STRs polymorphism analysis is based on a panel of STR markers largely variable in the population, and it has been mutuated from forensic medicine. Actually, in the transplant setting, many panels of STR markers have been derived from forensic practice. Aim of the study: In our laboratory we analysed CS on patients submitted to allogeneic HSCT. We employed a STR panel derived from a commercial kit for forensic use (PowerPlex 16 System, Promega, USA). Our panel includes 15 highly polymorphic STR loci (Penta D, Penta E, TH01, D3S1358, D18S51, TPOX, D21S11, D13S317, D8S1179, D16S539, D5S818, D7S820, Vwa, CSF1PO, FGA) and Amelogenin locus. Aim of our study was to verify the effi cacy of this panel in CS evaluation in our population. Methods: We studied STR polymorphism with PCR amplifi cation and semi-quantitative detection of number of repeats of each STR marker. For the CS monitoring we used the \"informative markers\" between donor and recipient individuals. We analyzed 100 consecutive donor-recipient (D/R) couples in allogeneic HSCT performed in our centre. 95% of patient population was Italians from all the regions, 5% was from other countries. Results: The panel employed permitted to have al least one informative markers for each D/R couple. Particularly 41% had 2 informative markers, 24% had 3 informative markers, 18% had 4 or more informative markers and only 16% had 1 informative marker. Amelogenin, Penta D, Penta E and TH01 are the more variable STRs in our population and at least one of them is informative in 78% of our population. These four markers summed to D3S1358, D18S51, TPOX, D21S11, D13S317, D8S1179 constitute a panel informative in 99% of our population. Instead the less informative markers are D16S539, D5S818, D7S820, Vwa, FGA and CSF1PO which are present in 45% only of our population and are always associated to other more frequent markers. Conclusion: This panel is useful in CS analysis of the Italian population. We retain that also a smaller panel constituted from 9 STR markers and amelogenin locus could be suffi cient to individuate at least one informative marker in our population for CS analysis in transplant setting.",

Resnick Hadassah Medical Center (Israel, IL) Introduction: Over ten years ago we introduced a fl udarabine based conditioning for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for thalassemia major. We published our early experience for thalassemic patients who received grafts after fl udarabine-based conditioning(1). Aim: In this paper we update previous data on 20 patients and report new data on 25 additional patients. Methods: Forty fi ve patients (aged 2.4 to 24 years, median 7.2 years) underwent 48 allogeneic HSCT for treatment of thalassemia major. In this work we analyzed the data on fi rst transplantations only. Our experience with second transplantations was published previously (2). The conditioning protocols used were (total doses) Fludarabine (Flu) 180 mg/m 2 + Busulfan (Bu) 16 mg/kg + Antithymocyte Globulin (ATG) Fresenius 40 mg/kg or Thymoglobulin 10 mg/kg in 29 patients. Eleven patients were conditioned with the same protocol augmented with Thiotepa (10 mg/kg); fi ve other patients received TBI (2 patients), Cyclophosfamide (2) or Melphalan (1). Thirty six transplantations were performed from a matched sibling donor, 4 from matched family donors and 5 from matched unrelated donors. Follow up till July 1, 2009 was 4 to 152 months. Results: In the group of patients who got Flu based protocols disease free survival (DFS) was 80% (36/45) and overall survival (OS) was 93% (42/45). Fifteen (33%) patients suffered from acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD), 8 (17%) of them with grade 3-4. Twelve patients (26%) developed chronic GvHD, half of them extensive. Of the 3 mortalities, one died following a matched sibling donor transplantation while two from MUD/MFD group (1/36 vs. 2/9, P = 0.036). Two of them were transplanted with Flu-Bu-ATG and one with Flu-Bu-TT-ATG. Causes of death were aGvHD grade \u2265 2 (n = 3) in combination with sepsis (n = 2). Estimated OS using Kaplan-Meier curve was 91% in Flu-Bu-TT-ATG group vs. 96% in Flu-Bu-ATG group (Figure 1) . Four patients who experienced graft failure were conditioned with Flu-Bu-ATG (14% of the total group) and three additional patients received Flu-Bu-TT-ATG (27%, NS). Conclusion: We conclude that combination of fl udarabine with busulfex and ATG is safe, demonstrates acceptable rejection rates and is well tolerated by thalassemic patients.",

Yesilipek Akdeniz University School of Medicine (Antalya, TR) Introduction: The only curative treatment modality for thalassemia major (TM) patients remains allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We retrospectively evaluated the transplantation outcomes and chimerism kinetics of the patients transplanted with TM. Methods: One hundred-three TM patients transplanted in our institution between 1998-2009 with a mimimum 6 months follow-up for alive patients were included in the study. Patients who have chimerism evaluation performed within the fi rst 60 days after transplantation were also analysed in respect to chimerism kinetics. Conclusion: TM patients having more than 25% of RHC within 2 months after transplantation have higher risk for GR. In patients with MC but with less than this amount of RHC at the end of fi rst month, chimerism should be monitored at least monthly until stable chimerism is achieved and in patients with high risk for GR, early intervention should be considered.",

Marktel Scientifi c Institute H S Raffaele (Milan, IT) Rejection is an unsolved problem following HSCT in high risk (class 3) thalassemia patients (pts). Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) could be given in attempt to counteract anti donor immunity. However, it could also delay immune reconstitution, exposing pts to life-threatening infections. We analyzed immune reconstitution up to 120 days post HSCT in 56 beta-thalassemia pts undergoing HLA-identical sibling HSCT between 2005 and Jan 2009. Median age at HSCT was 8 yrs (range 2-17). 29 pts were classifi ed as low risk (class 1-2) and underwent myeloablative conditioning with weightadjusted iv Bu + Cy200 mg/Kg. 27 pts class 3 high risk pts were treated with weight-adjusted iv Bu and reduced dose Cy160 mg/Kg preceded by pre-conditioning (Sodani, Blood 2004). Because of high incidence of rejection in the fi rst 9 pts (class-3noATG), we intensifi ed immunosuppression in the following 18 pts with ATG Thymoglobuline (7.5-10 mg/Kg) (class 3ATG). GvHD prophylaxis consisted of CyA and short Mtx. Metylprednisolone (MPD) 0.5 mg/kg till + 30 was associated to class 1-2 and class3no ATG. We compared immune reconstitution in the 3 groups (class 1-2, class3noATG, class3ATG). Immune reconstitution of lymphocytes subpopulation at + 30 was best for class 3ATG (Figure 1 ): CD3 + class 1-2 vs. 3noATG P = 0.032, class 1-2 vs. 3ATG P \u2264 0.001; CD3 + CD4 + class 1-2 vs. 3noATG P = 0.004, class 1-2 vs. 3ATG P = 0.003; CD3 + CD8 + class 1-2 vs. 3noATG P \u2264 0.001. No difference was observed for CD19 + . Median time to discontinuation of iv Ig supplementation was 81 days for class 1-2, 40 days for class3noATG, and 22 days for class3ATG. Frequency of bacterial infections after + 60 was higher in class 1-2 compared to class3ATG (P = 0.027) (31% class 1-2, 12,5% class3noATG, 0% class 3ATG), while no difference was observed in the incidence of viral and fungal infections. GvHD occurred in 28% of class 1-2 pts, 12.5% class3noATG and 12.5% in class3ATG with no signifi cant statistical difference in the 3 classes (P = 0.403). None of the pts in class 1-2 rejected the graft, while the cumulative incidence of secondary graft failure was 19.6% in class 3ATG and 44.4% in class3noATG (P = 0.09). In our analysis, high risk pts treated with ATG show a reduced incidence of rejection compared to high risk pts treated without ATG and a satisfying immune reconstitution. Class 1-2 pts have a reduced incidence of rejection but a higher infectious risk, probably due to higher doses of Cy in the conditioning regimen and the use of MPD in the GvHD prophylaxis.",

We prospectively investigated BKV in pts receiving HSCT from HLA-matched related donors, risk factors for HC development and treatment effi cacy with CDV. 117 pts with thalassemia (n = 107) or sickle cell anemia (n = 10) with median age of 9 years (range, 1.7-17) were enrolled in this study. All pts received BUCY and/or Thymoglobulin-ATG (in 26 pts) containing regimens. Quantitative BKV-PCR on blood and urine samples were performed before conditioning and weekly thereafter in 64 pts. Risk factors for HC were evaluated on univariate and multivariate analysis using cumulative incidence curves and competing risk regression analysis. Ten pts received CDV 1.5 mg/kg 3 days/wk and 9 pts 5 mg/kg/wk. 52 of 64 (81%) pts had 2 or more positive samples for BK viruria and 18 of 64 (28%) pts for BK viremia. Viral load varied from < 556 to > 55 \u00d7 10 6 copies. Thirty (26%) pts had HC at a median of 38 days (range, 13-114), 24 of them had grade 2, 2 grade 3 and 4 grade 4 HC. All pts with HC had BK viruria. Four pts developed hydronephrosis with ureteral stenosis necessitating ureteral stent placement. The cumulative incidence of grade 2 or 3-4 HC was 21% and 5% respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that use of ATG (HR = 10.5; P = 0.001), peak BK viruria > 100000 copies (HR = 6.2; P = 0.004), and GVHD (HR = 5.3; P = 0.007) predicted HC. The cumulative incidence of HC in pts who had 3 risk factors was 88%, compared with 64%, 30% and 0% who had either 2, 1 or none risk factor (P = 0.0001). Both dosing schedules of CDV were well tolerated with no cases of dose-limiting nephrotoxicity. The median duration of HC was 17 days (range, 9-53). The median duration of therapy was 27 days (range, 21-180) with a median of 9 doses given (range, 6-22). All pts had a complete clinical response (CCR) but only 6 (32%) had microbiological response at 2 wks after therapy. None of these patients cleared BK viruria when a CCR was achieved. Ten pts with grade 2-3 HC occurred before prospective trial of CDV had spontaneous resolution. The median duration of HC in these pts was similar to those treated with CDV. In conclusion, high load BK viruria, use of ATG and GVHD are associated with HC. CDV may have some activity against BKV-related HC, although spontaneous resolution of HC could also occur which rises question regarding the adequacy of CDV therapy for BK virus-related HC.",

Yesilipek Akdeniz University School of Medicine (Antalya, TR) Aim: The assessment of feasibility of pre-emptive donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) in patients with unstable mixed chimerism (MC) in thalassemia major (TM) patients. Methods: The indications for DLI were either having more than 25% residual host cells (RHC) (MC level 3) in the early phase after transplantation or increasing proportions of RHC in serial monitoring with decrease in hemoglobin (Hb) levels. Nineteen patients following 21 transplantations had received DLI out of 109 transplantations performed in 103 patients. Results: Seven patients received with the indication of having MC level 3 in the early phase and assigned as early-DLI group. Four patients although had MC level 3 in the early period received DLI because of increasing proportions of RHC in serial monitoring at post-transplant 4-6 months and assigned as late-DLI group. In the early DLI group, 3 out of 7 patients preserved functional grafts whereas other 4 lost. In the late DLI group, only 1 patient preserved the graft and the difference between these two in respect to preserving functional graft was not found statistically signifi cant. Ten received DLI because of gradual decrease in percentage of donor cells in parallel to Hb levels. Eight out of 10 patients have been followed as transfusion independent. The increase in Hb levels was statistically signifi cant (t = -4,699, P = 0.002) whereas increase in percentage of donor cells was not found statistically signifi cant. Discussion: In the early-DLI group, 3 out of 7 patients rescued their grafts, although the probability of graft rejection is around 90%. On the other hand, in the late-DLI group, only 1 patient rescued his graft. Although statistical signifi cance could not be determined between early and late-DLI group, this was thought to be related with differences in the chimerism kinetics of the patients within two groups. If pre-emptive DLI is considered, it seems more benefi cial if it is applied earlier for this indication. In patients with gradual decrease in percentage of donor cells in late period, Hb level should be determinative for DLI indication but it is diffi cult to defi ne a critical Hb level less than which DLI should be proposed depending on our data. However it seems reasonable to delay if Hb levels are more than 9 gr/dL even percentage of donor cells decrease more if they have not been recently transplanted.",

            "text": "Background: Hematopoietic cell transplantation from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched siblings cures at least 85% of sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. But most SCD patients lack an HLA-matched sibling. The combination of in-vitro fertiliization (IVF) and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) can provide HLA-matched sibling donors for patients with various diseases. There are no medical reports of a succesful HCT for a patient with SCD from a sibling donor born via the combination of IVF and PGD. Report: The parents of an 8-year-old male with SCD requested the opportunity of conceiving a matched donor for their affected child via IVF and PGD.Three embryos who were unaffected by SCD were implanted. Two of the three embryos were HLAmatched to the affected child. Only one embryo survived. At birth, we confi rmed that the newborn sibling was HLAmatched to the patient and unaffected by SCD. The total nucleated cell count in the umbilical cord blood unit collected at birth was only 13 million/kg. Thus, we had to submit the newborn sibling to a bone marrow harvest procedure at the age of 11 months, to complement the cord blood cell count. The combined umbilical cord blood and bone marrow transplant was performed after myeloablative conditioning with the standard regimen combining busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and anti-thymocyte globulin. The patient tolerated conditioning relatively well. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and low-dose methotrexate. He engrafted rapidly and was discharged home after three weeks. A mixed-donor chimerism test done on Day + 30 was 98% donor. Subsequent tests have shown no Hgb S. Complications have included Stage 1 GVHD of the skin and marked, unexplained elevation of the liver enzymes with mild non-specifi c changes in a liver biopsy. The patient is now on Day + 156 and is cured from sickle cell disease. Conclusions: We provide the fi rst medical report of succesful HCT for SCD with a sibling donor born via the combination of IVF and PGD. This technology, readily available in many nations with a high human development index, and frequently reported as a means of achieving succesful transplantation for less common diseases, is grossly underutilized in SCD. We are pursuing the possible reasons for this healthcare gap. Sickle Cell Disease patients without matched siblings in countries such as the United States of America should have easier access to this potential source of the ideal HCT donor.",

Sarhan King Hussein Cancer Center (Amman, JO) Purpose: To evaluate the outcome of children with alpha-Thalassemia major who underwent Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) from matched sibling donors at KHCC. Patients and methods: Thirty three children less than 18 years of age with Thalassemia major were transplanted from HLA identical related donors between September, 2003 and December, 2008. Seventeen were females and 16 males. The median age was 8 years (1-15 years). Patients were classifi ed into 3 groups according to iron load status, Class I (n = 7) and Class II (n = 18) patients received myeloablative conditioning regimen with oral Busulphan (4 mg/kg/day for 4 days), Cyclophosphamide (50 mg/ kg/day for 4 days) and horse Anti-Thymocyte Globulin-ATG-(30 mg/kg/day for 5 days). Patients with class III (n = 8) received non-myeloablative conditioning regimen with Busulphan (2 mg/ kg twice daily for two days), Fludarabine (35 mg/m 2 /day for 5 days), horse ATG (30 mg/kg/day for 5 days), and total lymphoid irradiation (500 cGy on Day zero). As Graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis; patients with myeloablative conditioning received Cyclosporine and short course of Methotrexate, while Cyclosporine and Mycophenolate Mofetil (Cellcept) were used for patients who received nonablative conditioning.",

Bolat Akdeniz University (Antalya, TR) Objective: Allogeneic hematopoetic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only radical cure of beta thalassemia. However, iron overload remains a cause of morbidity and mortality in exthalassemic patients. Method and patients: We present seven patients as a preliminary report who underwent HSCT and received oral chelating therapy (deferasirox) because of poor compliance to phlebotomy and desferrioxamine. Chelating therapy was started 6 to12 months after HSCT. All patients received deferasirox (Exjade, Novartis) with the dosage of 30 mg/kg/day orally. Serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinin levels were checked weekly during the fi rst month and then two times in a month. Serum ALT, AST levels and also complete blood counts were also checked periodically. Ferritin levels were measured once a month. Chimerism was evaluated by FISH in patients with sex mismatched HSCT whereas by STRs in others. Median follow up duration was 10 months (range 7-16 months). The patients' parents provided informed consent at the beginning of the therapy. Results: Three of seven patients were classifi ed as Class II and four were Class III before HSCT. Two of them had Grade II and fi ve of them had Grade III-IV hemosiderosis and median hepatic fi brosis score was II (Ishak system) at time of HSCT. In all patients, deferasirox therapy achieved reduction in serum ferritin levels. No negative effect was seen in AST, ALT, Hb and donor chimerism of the patients while serum ferritin levels signifi cantly reduced (P = 0.022). Although serum creatinin signifi cantly increased (P = 0.008) it was in normal limits in all patients. Conclusion: We believe that use of medication to remove iron should only be considered in circumstances in which venous access is prohibitive or anemic patient. In these patients deferasirox may provide safety iron removal in post-transplant period. However, it is necessary to monitor serum creatinin levels of the patients closely. Further studies with more patients and longer follow up are required to defi ne its clinical effi cacy and safety. another developed acute transverse myelitis which resolved after treatment with steroids, immunoglobulins, rituximab, CY, and discontinuation of CSA. Two siblings developed secondary graft failure due to phenytoin hypersensitivity syndrome after MUD-SCT. The boy recovered spontaneously, the girl required a 2nd SCT from another MUD. She was the only Pt who developed severe chronic skin GvHD, refractory to prednisone, mycophenolate, and rapamicin, with complete resolution after 4 infusions of mesenchymal stem cells. Results: Sickle cell free survival was 100%. All including 5 heavily pretransfused Pts engrafted. The 2 RIC Pts received donor lymphocyte infusions for mixed chimerism (44-80% donor). All others had stable chimerism of 90-99%. All Pts had full donor erythropoiesis, and a 100% Lansky score after SCT. No case of new stroke after SCT occurred, abnormal TCD normalized in 4/5 Pts, 1 Pt is too early for evaluation. The lung function in the Pt with severe restrictive lung disease before SCT normalized. 5/6 Pts had stable pulmonary function after SCT, 1 Pt had normal spirometry but decreased carbon monoxide diffusing capacity. 3 girls developed hypogonadism. Conclusion: SCT can reverse cerebral vasculopathy, prevent stroke and reverse sickle cell lung disease. Transplantassociated complications were serious but mostly reversible.",

HLA-matched sibling marrow was administered after conditioning with thiotepa 10 mg/kg, busulfan 14 mg/kg and cyclophosphamide 200 mg/kg, followed by GvHD/rejection prophylaxis with prednisone, methotrexate, and cyclosporin. Management standards for therapy administration, central venous access, severe pancytopenia, immunosuppression, and hospital infection control have been implemented following on site training assisted by web-based data management and real-time videoconferencing. Since August 2008, a total of 15 BMTs have been performed in 15 low-risk patients (no hepatomegaly, median age 3.3, range 0.9 to 6.2). Liver biopsies were not routinely performed. Nine BMTs were done at an established center (NIBD), and 6 at newly developed services (4 at PIMS and 2 at SIH). Results: At a median follow up of 242 days (range 90-463), actuarial thalassemia-free survival is 80% and overall survival 100%. Three patients had graft failure followed by autologous reconstitution. One patient developed grade 3 and one grade 2 acute GvHD, 5 had subclinical CMV activation and one developed pulmonary tuberculosis. Other manageable complications included hypertension in 4 patients and hemorrhagic cystitis in 3. No case of veno-occlusive disease of the liver or chronic GvHD has been observed so far. Costs: The cost of each BMT was in the range of 12,000\u20ac, including full family support for a minimum of 8 months. Setting up a two-bedded BMT unit (at PIMS) including civil works and basic equipment required approximately 30,000\u20ac. Conclusions: Early experience with a new international model aimed at enhancing global access to bone marrow transplantation suggests that it can be performed safely and effectively with limited resources.

Despite the critical role of Tregs in auto/allo-immune phenomena after HSCT, their kinetics of immune reconstitution are unkown. We present data in 50 adult recipients of autologous HSCT (34 myeloma = melphalan-200; 16 lymphoma = BEAM) in whom prospective peripheral blood samples for analysis of immune reconstitution of Tregs were collected (median age 57, 28-74; 34 men, 16 women). Tregs defi ned by expression of CD3 + /CD4 + /CD25high/CD127dim, and expressed as a percentage of CD4 + T cells recovered surprisingly soon after autologous HSCT, with a 3-fold expansion as early as 2 weeks after transplant (6,55% vs. 2,12%; P < 0,001). Tregs remain high at day + 90 when lymphocyte recovery starts taking place. Tregs early expansion after HSCT correlates with pre-HSCT Tregs levels (r = 0,78; P = 0,034), and mirrors the kinetics of expansion of FoxP3 mRNA expression at these same timepoints (10,32 vs. 3,0; P = 0,003), in keeping with a true regulatory phenotype, in particular in a clean autologous model, where CD25high and FoxP3 upregulation or CD127 downregulation cannot be caused by alloreactive phenomena. From the perspective of the underlyin mechanism, Tregs expansion early after autologous HSCT in our patients takes place in the absence of thymic output, as meassured by sjTRECs, which remain low up to 6 months after autologous, in keeping with the advanced age of our subjects. Moreover, Tregs expression of CD31, an additional marker of recent thymic output, did not change between timepoints. This is the fi rst study that focuses on early kinetics of immune reconstitution of Tregs after HSCT. Our data show that Tregs recovery occurrs earlier than initially anticipated in only two weeks after the procedure, and that it probably occurs by a peripheral thymic-independent mechanism. This early Tregs expansion in vivo in humans may be a candidate mechanism to explain the immunomodulatory effects of of autologous HSCT in autoimmune disorders, and may identify a novel therapeutic point to modulate such phenomena.

            "text": "Human-keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for its safety and effi cacy in preventing mucosal damage from irradiation and after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT). It has been suggested that, besides having preventive effects on oral mucositis, it may also have immunomodulating effects through the protection of thymic epithelial cells. Indeed, in experimental mouse models, KGF has a role in post natal thymic recovery in chemotherapy, radiotherapy and allogeneic or autologous HSCT. Taking advantage of the KGF treatment of our Multiple Myeloma patient, we have investigated its potential on immune reconstitution after autologous HSCT in Human. Thirty myeloma patients from a single institution were treated homogeneously with the induction combination bortezomib (Velcade\u00ae) plus dexamethasone, followed by high dose melphalan (140-200 mg/m 2 ) and an autologous transplantation with peripheral blood stem cells. Patients were randomized for KGF treatment in 2 groups, 14 having received three doses of palifermin (Kepivance\u00ae) (60 \u03bcg/kg once daily i.v.) pre-and post-conditioning regimen (total six doses). Blood samples were drawn at diagnosis, before HSCT, and at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months post HSCT. To assess thymic function, we analysed signal joint (sj) TREC in peripheral blood lymphocytes using quantitative RT-PCR. Na\u00efve, Central and Effector Memory, and Regulatory T lymphocyte subpopulations percentage and absolute were monitored by multicolour fl ow cytometry. SjTREC decreased sharply after transplantation and returned to baseline after 1 year without differences between the two groups of patients. Regulatory T lymphocytes (phenotypically assessed as CD4 + cD25 + cD127-/low) were not modifi ed by KGF treatment either. Notably, the CD3 + cell population was signifi cantly higher during the fi rst 3 months post HSCT in KGF treated patients. This was related to a higher CD8 + cell counts, specifi cally in the CD8 Effector Memory cells (CD8 + cD45RA-CCR7-cells) at 1 and 3 month post HSCT. No correlation was found with documented infectious complications, relapse or survival. These data suggest that, in Human, the main effect of KGF on immunity, in that autologous HSCT setting, is not on thymic function but rather on the peripheral expansion of CD8 + effector memory cells.

Conditioning regimens were the same with a Total Body Irradiation in 50.9% in UCBT and 43% in UBMT. Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) S200 prevention included cyclosporine A and antithymocyte globulin in all patients; steroid was added in UCBT. Immune reconstitution was studied by assaying absolute number of natural killer (NK), B and T cells by fl ow cytometry at 1, 2, 3, 6 months, 1 and 2 years. Several immunological endpoints were chosen: time to achieve a CD3 + cell count > 500, 1000, and 1500/mm\u00b3, CD4 + >200 and 500/mm\u00b3, CD8 + >250/ mm\u00b3, CD19 + >200/mm\u00b3, NK>100 and 250/mm\u00b3. These endpoints were analysed through the use of cumulative incidence curves for estimating incidence over time in the context of competing risks and through Fine and Gray models to assess prognostic factors. The median time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment was respectively 28 and 50 days for UCBT whereas it was 19 and 30 days for UBMT (P < 0.001). The cumulative probability of acute grade 2 or greater GvHD was 19.6% for UCBT and 35% for UBMT (P = 0.009). The overall survival at 5 year was similar: 57.5% for UCBT and 62.1% for UBMT (P = 0.25). The Transplantation Related Mortality was 19.6% for UCBT and 16.7% for UBMT (P = 0.56). Comparing UCBT and UBMT in a multivariate model, we found that CD8 + T cell recovery was delayed after UCBT with a median time to reach CD8 + T cells > 250/mm\u00b3 of 7.7 months whereas it was 2.7 months in UBMT (P < 0.001). B cell recovery was better in UCBT with a median time to reach CD19 + cells > 200/mm\u00b3 of 3.2 months in UCBT and 6.4 months in UBMT (P = 0.03). CD4 + lymphocyte and NK cell recovery was similar in UCBT and UBMT. Other factors affecting lymphocyte subset recovery in the multivariate analysis were the age for CD4 + T cell with a better reconstitution in younger patients (P = 0.002), and a positive cytomegalovirus serology which favoured CD8 + T cell reconstitution (P = 0.001). This study suggests that naive CD8 + T cells from UCBT have a worst reconstitution than mature CD8 + T cells from UBMT, but B cell recovery is better in UCBT. Immune reconstitution in other subset of lymphocyte is similar in UCBT and UBMT. Moreover outcome in UCBT is comparable with UBMT, and GvHD is less frequent in UCBT. A. Jakitsch, M. Stais, A.

            "text": "The T-cell repertoire can be assessed by the characterization of rearranged TCR-beta chains (CDR3-Spectratyping). To facilitate the interpretation of the results, comprising the number of TCR families and the grade of polymorphism between each family, a Web-accessible statistical tool (SpA: Spectratype Analysis, Duke University, Durham, USA) was used. It provides a combined graphical reproduction and expresses the degree of diversity by the calculation of the Kullback-Leibler coeffi cient (KL). In the thymus T-cells undergo somatic recombination of the TCR genes and form thymus excision circles (TRECs) which can be quantifi ed of by RQ-PCR on genomic DNA preparations. The amount of detected TRECs is used as indicator of thymus activity. We have investigated 52 paediatric patients (pts), who were monitored during the fi rst year after transplantation. 19 pts received reduced intensity conditioning regimen (Flu-TT-MEL) followed by transplantation of CD3/CD19 depleted grafts and 33 pts received a standard myeloablative conditioning and bone marrow (BM) transplantation. For longitudinal investigations peripheral blood samples are collected at day 30, 60, 90, 200, 300 and 365. During the observation period of 4/19 pts ( = 22%) who received a CD3/CD19 allograft were positive for TRECs, and of 19/57 pts ( = 33%) who received BM showed TRECs (P = 0.112). Within both groups (CD3/CD19 and BM) TRECs could be clearly detected starting from day + 200. Vbeta-spectratyping data showed that the KL values of the BM group were closer to normal values compared to the CD3/CD19 group at day 30. However, this difference disappears already at day 60 and during further course both groups are not distinguishable. Conclusion: TCR repertoire reconstitution follows individual courses and is affected by several factors, e.g. the primary disease, infections, relapse, and graft versus host disease (GvHD). Surprisingly, the time to achieve complex TCR repertoires seems to be similar between recipients of BM and CD3/ CD19 depleted peripheral stem cell grafts. D. Schneidawind (1), A. Schmitt (2) , D.

Material and methods: CD8 + T cells from peripheral blood (PB) of 25 healthy volunteers and 7 patients suffering from HC after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) were coincubated with BKV derived peptides for eight days in a mixed lymphocyte peptide culture (MLPC). Subsequently T cells were screened by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays and fl uorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. Results: We found that CD8 + T cells from 5 of 7 (71%) patients with HC presensitized with the BKV peptide VP1 p108 (LLMWEAVTV) specifi cally recognized T2 cells pulsed with VP1 p108. In contrast only 7 of 25 (28%) healthy volunteers had CD8 + T cells reactive with VP1 p108-pulsed T2 cells after presensitization. The presence of VP1 p108-specifi c T cells in the PB of patients with HC could be confi rmed by staining as HLA-A2/VP1 p108 peptide tetramer + CD8 + T cells. Conclusion: In summary BKV peptide VP1 p108 seems to play an important role as an immunodominant peptide in the pathogenesis of HC in patients after allogeneic SCT and might be a promising target for immunotherapies or even strategies to prevent the development of BKV-associated HC. As BKV shares more than 70% homology with multi-focal leukencephalopathy inducing JC virus on the DNA level, such approaches open also new avenues.",

            "text": "HLA-C-dependent KIR ligand mismatch improves event-free survival (EFS) in AML patients especially after haploidentical HSCT. Recently we could show that in 109 CML patients receiving grafts from matched unrelated donors (MUD), clinical outcome was signifi cantly infl uenced by specifi c C1/C2 donor recipient constellations (Fischer et al. J Immunol, 2007) . Based on our previous observation that KIR genes are sequentially expressed during NK cell differentiation, we hypothesized that the presence of C1 but not C2 ligands in the patient enabled early reconstitution of high numbers of immunocompetent NK cells. To investigate whether this holds true for other patient cohorts, we analyzed the infl uence of KIR ligand constellations in a second cohort. 89 patients with MDS, (n = 22), AML/CML (n = 34), ALL/NHL (n = 33) received unmanipulated PBPC after myeloablative (n = 66) or non-myeloablative conditioning regimens (n = 23) in the Department of Hematology, University of D\u00fcsseldorf. All recipients received grafts from MUD (10/10 match) except 16 with an HLA-C KIR ligand mismatch. HLA class I types were determined by direct sequencing and patients classifi ed according to the KIR ligand groups C1C1, C1C2 or C2C2. Superior OS rates were found for C1C1 recipients in AML/CML (C1C1 recipients all alive, P > 0,05). This fi ts to our original hypothesis that the early NK cell reconstitution is dominated by the presence of C1-but absence of C2-specifi c NK cells. Within the subgroup of patients with C1C2 or C2C2 phenotypes 6 patients had an C1/C2 mismatch, which was associated with signifi cantly increased OS (P > 0.02, all patients alive, median follow-up of 575d, range 133-899d) compared to matched HLA-C phenotypes (median survival of 254d). In recipients with C1C1 phenotype the risk for TRM following HLA-C matched transplantation was reduced as refl ected by an odds ratio of 0.13. In turn, patients receiving KIR ligand mismatched grafts had a lower incidence of relapse. These effects were not observed in patients with MDS or ALL/NHL, although there was a trend for a favorable outcome in ALL/NHL patients receiving a KIR ligand mismatched graft (P > 0.07; mean OS intention to treat 3.5y vs.14y). These fi ndings support our observations that transplant outcome in unrelated matched HSCT is substantially infl uenced by the distribution of HLA-C encoded KIR ligands (superior clinical outcome in C1/C1 recipients) and confi rms the clinical relevance of NK cell-mediated effects.

Meyer Johannes Gutenberg University (Mainz, DE) The anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab is frequently used for in vivo T cell depletion (TCD) in the context of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We recently demonstrated long-term persistence of CD52-negative T-cell subsets in patients after HSCT following alemtuzumab-mediated TCD. We therefore investigated the functional consequences of this CD52-loss on T cells from our patients. CD52 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein.",

            "text": "By staining for CD55 and CD59, we found that CD52-negative T cells also had lost expression of these GPI-anchored molecules. We proved that the loss of CD52 resulted from a reduced density of GPI-anchors on the membrane using a fl uorescent aerolysin (FLAER). Subsequently, CD4 and CD8 T cells were sorted from the peripheral blood of our patients according to their CD52-status by fl ow-cytometry. When we cultured the sorted cells separately, CD52-expression remained unaltered for more than 16 weeks. This observation was in contrast to earlier results with T cells of healthy donors treated with alemtuzumab in vitro, where CD52-negative populations were only transiently detected. The growth-kinetics of the patients' sorted T cells did not differ between the CD52-positive and CD52-negative populations when cultured with IL-2 and OKT-3 alone. On the contrary, when we expanded T cells in the presence of overlapping peptides from cytomegalovirus (CMV), only the proliferation of CD52-positive T cells increased. The reduced CMV-specifi c T cell activity of the CD52-negative T-cell subpopulations was confi rmed by IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay with in vitro expanded T cells as well as by IFN-gamma secretion-assay on primary T cells ex vivo. We further analyzed IFN-gamma secretion of T cells following allogeneic stimulation with dendritic cells of non-HLA matched third-party donors and again detected lower levels of IFN-gamma production by CD52-negative compared to CD52-positive T cells. In summary, we demonstrated that the permanent loss of CD52 in reconstituting T cells after alemtzumab-based TCD is associated with a loss of GPI-anchors. Our data suggest that this loss correlates with altered T-cell effector-functions in response to antigen-specifi c stimulation. A further comparison of functional changes in CD52-negative T-cell subsets is necessary to understand the impact of alemtuzumab-mediated TCD on immune-reconstitution. This might also lead to an increased insight in the role of GPI-anchors for T cell function.",

(Reggio Calabria, IT) Background: Recent studies demonstrated the signifi cant correlation between early immune recovery (IR) and overall survival (OS) of patients (pts) who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). There are instead controversial data regarding the infl uence of graft composition on clinical outcome (CO) after allo-HSCT. Aim of the study: To evaluate the impact of graft composition on early IR and CO in terms of OS, transplant-related mortality (TRM) and disease-related mortality (DRM), acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD) after allo-HSCT. Materials and methods: We studied 99 pts underwent allogeneic BM (23) or PBSC (76) transplant. Pts were 51 females and 48 males with a median age of 46 years (r. 11-67). The donors were matched sibling donors (n = 83) or alternative donors (family mismached or unrelated donors) (n = 16). Conditioning regimens were myeloablative in 48 pts or at reduced intensity in 51 pts. AGVHD grade II-IV was present on 44 pts. Median follow-up of pts was 58 months (r. 24-98). Graft composition was evaluated in terms of CD34 + , CD3 + , CD4 + , CD8 + , CD19 + , CD56 + cells. Early CD4 + cell count (median 20 days after transplant, r. 12-34) was evaluated in peripheral blood samples. Results: Multivariate Cox analysis showed that early CD4 + cell count is the main predictive factor of OS (P = 0.012, HR 2.686, CI 1.241-5.813 ). OS also depends on aGVHD (P = 0.025, HR 0.303, CI 0.107-0.860) and donor type (P = 0.025, HR 0.303, CI 0.183-0.907). Roc curve of CD4 + cell count indicated that the cut-off value was 100/microl. At 2 years follow-up, pts achieving this CD4 + cell count had signifi cantly lower cumulative TRM compared to pts who did not have this count (14.5% \u00b1 5% vs. 39.4% \u00b1 8%, P = 0.0026). At 5 years follow-up, OS was 77.5% \u00b1 6.5% and 37.8% \u00b1 7.5% (P = 0.000) in pts with CD4 + cell count more or less than 100/microl, respectively. The graft composition was comparable in pts with early CD4 + cell count more or less cut-off value and didn't infl uence significantly the OS, DRM, TRM and aGVHD. Conclusion: The main predictive factor for CO of pts who underwent allo-HSCT is early CD4 + T cell count after transplant. Early immune reconstitution is independent of graft composition obtained from actual collect methods. In the future, the use of new mobilizing drugs could modify the graft in order to achieve a product that can improve early IR and consequently OS of pts after allo-HSCT. S. Theurich (1), A.

            "text": "CD4 + CD25highFoxP3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a central role in immunologic homeostasis and are able to induce tolerance after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloPBSCT). Polyclonal rabbit-anti-human antithymocyte globulins (ATG) are widely used to prevent and treat Graftversus-Host-Disease (GvHD) by a mechanism of action which has been thought to be mainly mediated by T cell depletion. Recent in vitro data have suggested that ATGs might increase the ratio or number of regulatory T cells as a new mechanism of action. So far, it is not known whether such effects exist in humans in vivo. Here, we present the data of a prospective pilot study in which we analyzed the infl uence of ATGs on the reconstitution of peripheral CD4 + /CD25high/FoxP3 + Tregs in ten patients after alloPBSCT. Ten patients were divided into two groups depending on the requirements of the respective alloPBSCT protocol: those who received ATG during conditioning (n = 6) and those without ATG (n = 4). ATG treated patients received a total dose of either ATG-Fresenius 30 mg/kgBW (n = 3) or ATG-Genzyme 6 mg/kgBW (n = 3) respectively. ATG was given day -3 to -1. All patients received peripheral hematopoietic stem cells (PBSC) from HLA matched donors and the transplanted stem cell grafts contained comparable median numbers of CD3 + T cells and CD34 + PBSC in both groups. All patients recieved prophylactic immunosuppression consisting of mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine. Antiviral prophylaxis was with acyclovir. Blood samples were taken before conditioning and after alloPBSCT at distinct time points (day + 30, + 60, + 90 and + 150) and immune cells were analyzed by fl ow cytometry (CD3,CD4, CD25,FOXP3). In vitro suppressive activity of Tregs from day + 150 samples was measured with CD4 + CD25 + selected Tregs and CD4 + CD25-selected CSFE labelled autologous responder T cells. In summary, we found a signifi cant -more than 3-fold -increase of relative Treg numbers in ATG treated patients compared to the control. We could also show that day + 150 Tregs were functionally active in an in vitro assay with autologous CSFE labelled responder cells. Taken together, our results rise fi rst evidence that rATG treatment leads to increased, functional active CD4 + /CD25high/ FoxP3 + Tregs in humans after allogeneic stem cell transplantation which supports the thesis that ATG exhibit their immunomodulatory activity by additional mechanisms beyond simple T cell depletion.

We aimed to characterise this fi nding further and identify transplant variables associated with paraprotein development. We examined a series of 104 consecutive allogeneic HSCT performed at our institution who had a minimum of 6 months post-transplant follow-up. Patients with myeloma (5 patients) or pre-existing paraproteinaemia (2 patients) were excluded. Data were unavailable for 5 patients thus 92 transplants were analysed: HLAidentical sibling donor 61%, matched unrelated donor (MUD) 39%, reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) 77%, myeloablative conditioning 23%. Alemtuzumab was contained in 42% of conditioning (5 sibling, 34 MUD). With a median follow-up of 4.75 years the cumulative incidence of paraproteinaemia was 32% (95% CI 18-44%) at 2 years; the median time to paraprotein appearance was 5 months. No patient developed paraproteinaemia beyond 22 months post-transplant ( Figure 1 ). In 10 of 29 patients the paraprotein(s) disappeared. Median time to disappearance was 8 months and the cumulative proportion of patients with persistent paraproteinaemia reached a plateau of 88% (95% CI; 83-98%) at 32 months. Paraproteins were frequently multiple with a median number of paraproteins per patient of 2 (range 1-6). Forty-one of 49 (83%) assessable paraproteins were of immunoglobulin G class and were divided equally in light chain restriction (kappa 24 of 49, 49%). Most paraproteins were too small to quantify, the mean concentration of 13 quantifi able paraproteins was 2.85 g/L. Of paraproteins quantifi able at any time point 5 increased and 9 decreased in concentration from initial detection. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only patient age (odds ratio (OR) 1.04 per year of increasing age, P = 0.04) and alemtuzumab use (OR no alemtuzumab = 0.23, P = 0.003) were signifi cantly associated with subsequent paraprotein development ( Figure 2) . No patient subsequently developed myeloma or a lymphoproliferative disorder. Survival of the paraprotein group was signifi cantly worse than the paraprotein-free group (hazard ration 0.38 for paraprotein-free, 95% CI 0. 16-0.92) , which is likely to be a refl ection of poorer survival outcomes for T-depleted MUD in comparison with T-replete sibling transplants. We conclude that post-transplant paraproteinaemia is a frequent, probably benign, fi nding and is infl uenced by alemtuzumab effects on B and T cell reconstitution.",

We previously reported that GvHD correlates with higher numbers of effector CD4 T cells and NK cells early after allogeneic transplantation using a regimen comprising fl udarabine, busulphan and alemtuzumab. Here, we assessed immune cell subset recovery in the same cohort of 25 patients in the context of early myeloid malignant disease relapse. Despite the close relationship between the GvL and GvHD immune responses, rapid recovery of lymphocyte subsets was not associated with protection from disease relapse. Analysis of immune recovery in the context of disease relapse showed no signifi cant differences within the lymphocyte subsets early (day 30) in patients that relapsed and those that did not. Indeed by day 60, twice as many lymphocytes were present in peripheral blood of patients in the relapse group at a median of 770 per microliter compared to 410 per microliter for patients that did not relapse (P = 0.04). This was particularly striking for the CD8 T cell population (P = 0.02) and was evident in all subsets (na\u00efve, memory and effector). These results indicate GvL may be weak or ineffective in this treatment setting for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukaemia. Consistent with low GvL activity, we previously reported that mixed T cell chimerism has no detrimental effect on relapse in this treatment setting and instead correlates with better outcome because of reduced GvHD incidence. We now report that patients with signifi cantly higher lymphocyte numbers prior to transplantation subsequently maintained the mixed T cell chimeric state (median of 900 per microliter compared to 250 per microliter for patients that progressed rapidly to full donor T cell chimerism; P = 0.04). This pre-transplant profi le, together with absence of the early post-transplant signature indicative of GvHD predisposition, could potentially be used to identify patients suitable for early withdrawal of immunosuppression and prophylactic donor leukocyte infusion to boost GvL activity.

There was two observation time points, fi rst at the beginning of hematological recovery and second 4 weeks later. All T cell subsets were defi ned with the use of two sets of monoclonal; antibodies which had CCR7 or CD27 MoAb, the other two antibodies used always in concert with CD27 and CCR7 MoAb were those against CD4 and CD45RA.

Varda-Bloom, R. Somech, Y. Volchek, R. Yerushalmi, N. Shem-Tov, A. Shimoni, A. Nagler Chaim Sheba Medical Center (Tel Hashomer, IL) Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) is the treatment of choice for advanced chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) (>CP1) and Ph + acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). However, post transplant relapse rates are still high. Nilotinib is a second generation TKI that is active in advanced CML. Administration of Nilotinib post alloSCT is an attractive approach for prevention of relapse. Fast and effi cient immune reconstitution is mandatory for the anti leukemic effect. Furthermore, TKIs may mediate an anti GVHD effect. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the post alloSCT immune recovery and function in pts with advanced CML and Ph + ALL that received Nilotinib post-alloSCT and to clinically assess its effect on GVHD and GVL. Twelve pts were recruited so far to the study. Seven with advanced CML (BC-5, AP-2) and 5 with Ph + ALL, median age 39 years (range, 21-57), males-7 and females-5. Immunological reconstitution was assessed pre-and post Nilotinib administration (200mgx2/d) and includes: FACS analysis of T and Natural Killer (NK) cells subsets, T cells mitogenic response, T cells receptor repertoire, T cells receptor excision circles (TREC) and NK cells cytotoxicity against K562. Results are presented as post vs. pre Nilotinib average values ( \u00b1 SE) in 6 pts with \u2264 180d follow up. Results: FACS: Lymphocytes numbers including CD3 (1726.7 \u00b1 248.2; 707.25 \u00b1 205.5) , CD4 (1312 \u00b1 219.1; 581.5 \u00b1 182.2), CD8 (554. 2 \u00b1 113; 306.5 \u00b1 76.2) , CD20 (246.8 \u00b1 74.1; 15 \u00b1 7.9), and CD56 (99. 1 \u00b1 20.3; 83.2 \u00b1 26.6 ) increased post Nilotinib administration. T cells mitogenic response increased in 4/6 of the pts (unchanged-1, decrease-1). Increased presentation of normally expressed Vb was observed in all patients (57% \u00b1 6.2 to 67% \u00b1 7.8 of the tested receptors pre and post Nilotinib, respectively) in conjunction with reduced presentation of under expressed Vb (29% \u00b1 8.5 to 15.8% \u00b1 4.4 of the tested receptors, respectively). Average of TRECs was 46.6 \u00b1 31.8 copies per 0.5ug DNA preand 158.3 \u00b1 67.3 copies per 0.5ug DNA post Nilotinib administration. Finally, increased NK cytotoxic activity against K562 was observed following Nilotinib administration in all but one evaluated pts; 27.5 \u00b1 8% vs. 10.9 \u00b1 6.8%, respectively. Conclusions: Nilotinib administration post alloSCT resulted in increased lymphocyte subsets, T cell mitogenic response, thymic output and repertoire and NK cell cytotoxic activity. In parallel, all pts but one achieved a sustained CMolR indicating a potent GVL effect. GVHD was reduced only in pts that received Nilotinib pre but not post alloSCT (Shimoni A. Leukemia 2009; 23:190) .",

Patients and methods: Medical records of 158 patients receiving autologous-HSCT between January 2003 and August 2009 were reviewed (82 NHL, 29 LH, 40 MM, 7 LAM). The study was performed using Cox regression model and survival curves of Kaplan-Meier. Results: With a median follow up of 134 weeks (range: 41-266 weeks) patients with ALC > 500/\u03bcl, n = 94 (59.5%) had a higher PFS and OS compared with those with ALC below the limit, n = 64 (40.5%): PFS 67 months (CI95%: 60. 5-72.5) ",

IFN-G and beta 7-integrin gene expressions were also significantly decreased after ATG in CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells and the difference lasted for one month post-SCT. There was no impact of ATG on IL-10 expression in CD4 + T-cells but higher IL-10 expression after ATG was seen in CD8 + T-cells early post-SCT (Day + 0 and Day + 14). An increase of IL-18 expression was seen both in CD4 + (Day + 0 only) and CD8 + T-cells (Day + 0 and Day + 14) after ATG. Conclusion: In contrast to other studies, we could not fi nd an increase of Foxp3 after the use of ATG. Foxp3 RNA levels were decreased considerably after ATG for a long time period after SCT. However, we have analyzed RNA expression which may not be positively correlated to protein levels which others have analyzed. ATG had a strong negative effect on IFN-G expression while IL-10 levels were increased which may indicate that ATG has a more positive effect on Th2 responses as compared to Th1 responses.",

Jo\u00e3o (Porto, PT) Autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) improves survival in suitable patients with Multiple Myeloma (MM). However, after ASCT there are widely documented impairments in immunological reconstitution such as the delay in recovery of polyclonal immunoglobulin. This abnormality when persistent might be associated with disease relapse or progression. We retrospectively analyzed a series of 65 consecutive patients with MM who underwent ASCT in our centre, from 2000 to 2009, regarding recovery of IgM levels ad day 100( \u00b1 10) post-ASCT. Progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed from the day of the transplant to disease progression or death (using the International Myeloma Working Group). PFS was analysed using Kaplan-Meier curves and univariate and multivariate analysis were done using proportional Cox regression. The median age of patients was 56 years (range-37 to 67), 31 were females. None of those had MM type IgM. Median follow-up was 12 months (range-1 to 42 months). Twenty-three (34.8%) patients recovered normal IgM levels by day + 100 and 42 (63.6%) did not, 1 patient data missing. PFS was signifi cantly higher in the group who recovered normal IgM at day 100( \u00b1 10) post-ASCT compared to patients who did not, with median PFS in the group who recovered normal IgM levels of 29 months versus 13 months in the group who did not recover (P = 0.021) ( Figure 1 ). Multivariate analysis, using a model including IgM polyclonal recovery, age, B2-mycroglobulin, and lactic dehydrogenase at diagnosis, number of prior chemotherapy schema and MM type, suggests that recovery of polyclonal immunoglobulin is an independent prognostic factor for PFS. It is debatable whether approaches with intravenous polyclonal immunoglobulin administration will translate into improvement of PFS in those patients. (1), A. Rinaldi (1), D. Montagna (2) , L.

Upon recognition of CD1d/lipid complexes, iNKT cells are immediately activated and produce cytokines that contribute to protect against infection and cancer. We investigated the reconstitution of the circulating iNKT cell compartment in 21 pediatric patients undergoing T-cell depleted haplo-identical HSCT (Haplo-HSCT) for hematological malignancies (6 acute myeloid leukemia, 9 acute lymphatic leukemia, 6 myelodisplastic syndrome). Patients' follow-up ranged between 13 and 25 months. In 13 patients in stable remission, CD4 + iNKT cells appear fi rst, followed by the CD4-ones. Both iNKT cell subsets emerge displaying an immature (CD161-) phenotype and undergo independent phenotypic and effector maturation programs, characterized by markedly faster acquisition of the NK-maturation marker CD161 and the ability to produce IFN-g in the CD4-one. In 8 patients relapsing after haplo-HSCT (median: 5.5 ; range 3-18 months), we documented a profound depletion of iNKT cells, during all observation time. In order to correlate iNKT reconstitution with relapse, we compared the temporal curves describing the kinetic of iNKT reconstitution in each patient. The statistical analysis indicated a strong difference (P = 0.001) between the kinetic of iNKT reconstitution observed in relapsing patients and that of patients in remission ( Figure) . No correlation was found between iNKT cell reconstitution and infections, or graft-versus-host disease. Analysis performed in the bone marrow confi rmed lack of iNKT cells in one patient who experienced leukemia relapse, and their emergence in a patient in remission. These fi ndings defi ne new aspects of human iNKT cell development and suggest a contribution of these cells to leukemia control, possibly via early IFN-g provision. Future strategies of adoptive infusion of donor-derived iNKT cells can be considered in patients with hematological malignancy receiving Haplo-HSCT showing an inability to reconstitute the iNKT cell compartment.",

Antiviral prophylaxis could be a viable alternative to vaccination in these patients. The safety, tolerability and protective effi cacy of a 12-week course of oseltamivir prophylaxis was studied in 477 solid organ transplant (SOT) and HSCT recipients. Here, we present safety and tolerability data from the subset of HSCT patients. Methods: SOT and HSCT recipients \u2265 1 year who were infl uenza negative by rapid test and without signs or symptoms of infl uenza at baseline were enrolled during periods of local infl uenza activity. Participants were randomised to oseltamivir (75 mg for adults and adolescents \u2265 13 years or weight-based unit doses for children 1-12 years) or matching placebo once daily for 12 consecutive weeks as capsule or suspension. Safety was assessed by physical and laboratory tests and adverse event (AE) reporting. Results: Eighty-seven (19%) of the 477 subjects enrolled were HSCT recipients (43 on placebo and 44 on oseltamivir). Most were male (74%) and unvaccinated against infl uenza (70%); mean age was 37.5 years. The median time since transplantation was 367 days in the oseltamivir arm and 424 days in the placebo arm. Serious AEs were more common in the placebo arm than in the oseltamivir arm (12% vs. 2%, respectively), while AEs were reported with a similar overall frequency (63% vs. 59%, respectively). The most common on-treatment AEs were infections (30% vs. 27%, respectively, including one case of infl uenza in a placebo recipient), gastrointestinal disorders (23% in both groups) and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (19% vs. 11%, respectively). The incidence of withdrawal due to AEs was higher in the placebo arm than in the oseltamivir arm (9% vs. 2%, respectively). Graft-versushost disease developed in four patients in each group. Three patients (two on oseltamivir on one on placebo) had grade 3/4 shifts in laboratory parameters from baseline. One patient in the placebo arm died while off treatment due to recurrent acute myeloid leukaemia. Limited patient numbers prevented meaningful evaluation of effi cacy.",

Vicente Hospital Morales Meseguer (Murcia, ES) Introduction: In April 2009, an outbreak of H1N1 infl uenza A virus infection was detected in Mexico and on June 11, the World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert level to the highest level. Immunocompromised patients have been described as one of the main groups at risk of this infectious disease especially on the most severe forms. Objective: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcome of patients who develop H1N1 virus infection. Patients and methods: Prospective observational study on patients followed on our Department from October to December 2009. Respiratory swab from all patient referring respiratory symptoms was obtained and Real Time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing for H1N1 infl uenza A was performed. Patients were closely monitored for clinical and radiological features. Results: 44 patients were confi rmed positive for the H1N1 Infl uenza A virus infection. Median age was 43 years and 57% were male. 20 patients (45%) had undergone an allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT) and 5 patients (11%) an autoSCT. The median incubation period of the virus was 1 day (range, 1/2-5). The most common symptoms were cough (86%) and fever (84%) followed by runny nose (68%) and sore throat (31%). Head and body ache were less common (9 and 15% respectively), only 1 patient presented diarrhea. Dyspnea was reported by 3 patients (7%) but only 1 (2%) needed mechanical ventilation (MV). Most patients (93%) had an X-ray performed at onset of symptoms buy only on 3 patients signifi cant changes were present. CT scan was performed on 9 patients, 1 non SCT, 1 auto and 7 alloSCT patients. On 5 (56%) of this patients viral neumonia was identifi ed even without presenting lower respiratory tract symptoms, all except 1 were alloSCT patients and only the non SCT patient had respiratory failure and needed MV. All patients except 1 received Oseltamivir therapy. 38 at standard dose of 75 mg bid for 5 days and 5, those who presented neumonia on CT scan at 150 mg bid. 96% of patients received antimicrobial concomitant therapy. All patients completed therapy and are alive with complete remission of fl u symptoms. Conclusion: The Infl uenza A in Oncohematology patients can cause a severe and fatal syndrome but in most patients behaves as a mild illness. The early use of oseltamivir may determine the mildness and good outcome of the infection in our series. The use of CT scan may be considered on alloSCT patients to rule out neumonia.",

After quality data extraction and normalization we used three different statistical approaches for each individual group and time point: (i) in-and exclusive analysis to fi nd peptides recognized in individuals in one group but never present in any individual in the control group (D-R-), (ii) PAM (Prediction Analysis for Microarray) to fi nd epitopes differentially recognized between groups and (iii) a 3D-visualization of the breadth and profi le of CMV epitope recognition. Results: 330 peptides, defi ned by PAM, were differentially detected in the 4 serological groups. Epitope recognition was clustered on individual proteins. The most strongly recognized peptides, differentiating D-R-vs. D + R + at 6 months were from pp28, UL102, and UL48. In contrast, at month 24, these epitopes were no longer differentially recognized, while epitopes from gB, TRS1, IE1, gO and IE2, pp65 and pp150 among others instead separated the groups. Conclusions: High-content peptide microarrays allow epitope profi ling of entire viral proteomes with minimal amounts of serum and describe common and private CMV specifi c humoral recognition patterns. This is helpful to describe the immune focus of anti-CMV specifi c B-cell responses. The humoral immune response against CMV is clearly dependent on pretransplant defi ned serological groups. Comparisons over time visualize the evolution of CMV epitope focus which, most likely, refl ects the B-cell reactivity pattern of the transplanted donor immune system.",

            "text": "Infl uenza is a common issue that transplant units deal with yearly and routine vaccination is recommended. This year a potentially more virulent strain H1N1, not covered by the standard vaccine has been cause for concern. We now report our experience to date with H1N1. The majority of patients who have undergone allogeneic transplantation at Banner Blood and Marrow Transplant Program have active follow up with our center rather than the referring physician. Those who develop fl u like symptoms would typically present to our clinic for evaluation and treatment. We now report 9 patients age range 17-62 years (median 49) who developed H1N1 following transplant prior to vaccination. Eight developed disease following allogeneic (5 MUD, 3 Sibling donors) and 1 following autologous transplantation. Time to presentation ranged from 41 (autologous) to 2700 days post transplant with a median of 710 days post transplant. All but two of the allogeneic patients presented beyond 600 days post transplant. Two allogeneic patients and the autologous patient were not on immunosuppressants. Five patients were on steroids, 4 on a calcineurin inhibitor and 2 on additional therapy for GVHD. Patients presented with rhinorrhea, cough, fever and aches. All received Tamifl u at 75 bid for at least fi ve days. In 4 the symptoms were mild and they received treatment as outpatients. Five required hospital admission, however 3 were in hospital for less than 4 days. Two patients had longer hospital stays and required mechanical ventilation. Both were admitted following what appeared to be the initial resolution of symptoms, approximately 2 weeks from the initial diagnosis. One had confi rmed reinfection resistant to Tamifl u and died from progressive pulmonary failure. The other had no etiology for their pulmonary failure and is currently improving with aggressive supportive care. Patients who undergo allogeneic transplantation are at high risk for infection with H1N1. Most appear to have a benign clinical disease but in our small series, 25% had an aggressive course after what appears to be a reinfection. All patients with URTI symptoms should be offered therapy while awaiting the results of testing. Those who are positive require aggressive supportive care and monitoring but it appears that the majority will survive the infection. With the late reinfections seen, patients should be cautioned to notify the transplant center if they develop additional fl ulike symptoms. P. Ljungman, J. Mattsson, J. Winiarski, E. Sparrelid, O. Ringd\u00e9n Karolinska University Hospital (Stockholm, SE) Background and aim: Norovirus infections have become a major practical clinical problem during the last few years causing outbreaks in hospitals infecting both patients and staff. These infections have also been associated with prolonged virus excretion in renal transplant recipients and a risk of mortality in the elderly. Little is known about the clinical impact of norovirus infections on patients who are severely immunosuppressed such as HSCT recipients although a report at the 2009 EBMT meeting suggested prolonged excretion and long-term clinical symptoms in a small series of HSCT patients. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of norovirus infections in patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Methods: The laboratory records from the Clinical Microbiological Laboratory at Karolinska University Hospital were examined in order to identify HSCT patients with proven norovirus infections diagnosed from 2006 to 2009. The diagnostic methodology was based on PCR. After identifi cation of cases, the patient charts were reviewed to assess outcome, possible norovirus associated clinical complications, and delay of other therapy. The duration of virus excretion was defi ned as the time from the fi rst to the last positive sample. Results: 29 patients were identifi ed; 27 had undergone allogeneic and 2 autologous HSCT. The median age was 34.8 ys (0.9-63). 16 of the detected viruses were typed to genogroup 2, 3 to genogroup 1, and 10 were not typed. The median duration of viral detection in the entire cohort was 4 days (1-216 days). Four patients have currently ongoing infections. 13/29 (45%) patients were PCR positive more than one week, 11 (38%) for more than two weeks, and 6 (21%) for more than four weeks. The majority of patients had minor and quickly resolved gastrointestinal symptoms while two patients had repeated epsiodes with gastrointestinal symtoms. Three patients died while norovirus positive. One patient had repeated hospitalizations due to diarrhoea and other infections, one patient died early after HSCT due to multiple complications including dehydration and electrolyte disturbances, while one patient died from a bacterial infection. One patient had a delay in a planned allogeneic HSCT. Conclusions: Norovirus infections are important problems in the clinical management of HSCT patients with many patients having prolonged virus excretion although usually not resulting in severe clinical consequences.

            "text": "Methods: BKV load was measured retrospectively using a real-time PCR assay in whole blood specimens from 61 consecutive allogeneic HSCT recipients (38 men, 23 women, median age: 45 years) collected at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-transplantation. Results: Fifteen patients (25%) developed BKV viremia at a median of 2 months after transplantation. The occurrence of BKV infection was associated with acute leukaemia as underlying disease (P = .03) and total body irradiation (P = .06), but not with donor HLA C7 allele. Post-HSCT BKV infection was associated with the occurrence of acute graft-versus-host disease (P = .003 ) and hematuria (P < .001), but not with renal impairment. The maximum BKV load was higher in patients with HC than in those without HC (median, 1685 vs. 160 copies/mL; P = .05). The development of HC was statistically associated with a concomitant BKV load > 500 copies/mL (P = .04 ) and with BKV detection in at least two consecutive blood specimens (P = .04). Lymphocyte recovery in patients with HC was delayed compared to those without HC. Ten patients experienced both BKV and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections after transplantation. In all cases, CMV infection appeared either before (n = 5) or concomitantly (n = 5) with BKV infection. The frequency of BKV detection was statistically higher in CMV-positive than in CMV-negative samples (22% vs. 5%; P < .001). No adenovirus infection was evidenced in patients with hematuria. Conclusion: BKV viremia is highly associated with late-onset HC in HSCT recipients. Prolonged BKV viremia and BKV load over 500 copies/mL of whole blood were identifi ed as predictive markers for the development of HC. The analysis of BKV load kinetics and lymphocyte recovery after transplantation suggests the potential role of cellular immunity in the pathogenesis of HC. Our results underline a possible role of CMV in the process of BKV infection. The monitoring of BKV viremia appears useful to identify HSCT recipients at risk for developing late-onset HC. L.

Current diagnostic strategy is however tailored mainly for neutropenic patients. Aim of the study was to asses the effi cacy of galactomannan (GM)-based diagnostic strategy in SCT recipients after granulocyte recovery and treated because of GVHD. Material and methods: 81 pts (median age 34; range 15-67) undergoing alloSCT because of hematologic diseases (AML/ MDS 41, CML/MPD 14, NHL/HD 13, ALL 9, SAA 4) were prospectively analyzed. Pts were transplanted with PB (55) or BM (26) stem cells from related (59) or unrelated donor (22). After hematologic recovery all pts were monitored with onceweekly serum GM test up to 100 days or longer in case of GVHD. High resolution chest computed tomography (HRCT) and bronchoscopy with lavage (BAL) were performed in case of positive serum GM test ( \u2265 0.5 in two consecutive samples), persistent fever or pulmonary infi ltrates. GM test was additionally performed in BAL with a result \u2265 0.5 regarded as positive. The diagnosis of IA was made according to EORTC/MSG criteria. Results: Documented IA was diagnosed in 16 (19.8%) patients (2 proven, 14 probable) and possible in 13 (16%). Median time to diagnosis of documented IA was 76d (r; 23-515). All but one cases of IA were diagnosed in patients with GVHD grade 2-4: 15/37 (40.5%) vs. 1/44 (2.3%), P = 0.00005, OR = 29. GM serum test was positive in all 16 pts and correlated with GM in BAL detected in 15 pts (r = 0.8, P < 0.001). HRCT revealed typical changes in 10 pts; endobronchial biopsy confi rmed IA (A. fumigatus) in 2 pts. The cumulative risk of development IA was 0.25 \u00b1 0.05 at 1 yr. All patients with documented IA were treated with voriconazole. In 12 weeks follow-up 8 (50%) patients died because of IA. Probability of 1 yr survival after IA was 0.36 \u00b1 0.12, while among non-IA patients 0.69 \u00b1 0.06 (P = 0.001). Overall risk of death due to IA was 0.124 \u00b1 0.042 at 1 yr.

HLA differences, T-cell depletion of the graft, use of antithymocyte globulin and total body irradiation are major risk factors for the development of this rapidly progressive disease. Based on molecular monitoring of the viral load in peripheral blood samples preemptive or prompt treatment including antiviral agents, reduction or cessation of immunosuppression, administration of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies and adoptive immunotherapy are important treatment strategies for patients (pts) at risk. For the treatment of patients with PTLD we developed a rapid overnight procedure for the isolation of EBV specifi c T-cells by stimulation of donor peripheral blood cells with a pool of EBV derived peptides, interferon gamma based cytokine capture technology and immunomagnetic separation. 6 pts with histologically proven PTLD received one single transfusion of a small number of EBV specifi c T-cells. In 5 pts (1 pt with SAA, 3 pts with AML and 1 pt with high grade NHL) a haploidentical transplantation including transfer of CD6 depleted stems cells on day + 6 and in 1 pt a matched unrelated stem cell transplantation had been performed previously. Clinical symptoms at time of T cell transfer included fever and lymphadenopathy in all 6 pts plus tonsillitis in 1 pt. 3 pts suffered already from multi organ failure (MOF) including hepatitis, pneumonitis and consecutive respiratory, renal, liver, cardiac and hemodynamic failure. In 2 pts leucaemic spread of lymphoma cells was observed. Immunosuppression was stopped in all pts. All pts had at least one course of treatment with cidofovir and rituximab before and had -despite of this treatment -clinical signs of progressive PTLD. No evaluable response was seen in 3 pts who suffered from late stage PTLD with MOF. In 3 pts with PTLD without MOF we observed a complete and stable remission of PTLD. 2 pts have remained free of EBV disease for more than two years now and show a stable reconstitution of a protective and functional EBV specifi c T-cell memory. No graftversus-host-disease was seen. Transfer of directly isolated EBV specifi c T-cells is a rapid, safe and valuable treatment option for patients with PTLD without MOF after hematopoetic stem cell transplantation.",

Wake, S. Taniguchi Toranomon Hospital (Tokyo, JP) Background: HHV6 reactivation has been increasingly recognized particularly in cord blood transplantation (CBT). HHV6 has been associated with limbic encephalitis (HHV6-LE), which causes anterograde amnesia and epilepsy. The CNS disorder confi ned to the hippocampal regions; the presence of abnormal MRI signals involving the hippocampus, and detection of HHV6 DNA in CSF. However, the incidence and risk factors for HHV6-LE in adult patients receiving CBT with reduced-intensity conditioning have not been established so far. Methods: In this study we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 362 CBT recipients with reduced-intensity conditioning between January 2002 and December 2007 at Toranomon Hospital in Japan to determine the incidence of HHV6-LE among these patients. HHV6-LE was defi ned as: the presence of neurological symptoms; positive PCR results for HHV6 in CSF; and the absence of other identifi ed etiologies of encephalitis. All the patients who manifested suspicious symptoms of HHV6-LE were treated with foscarnet. Results: HHV6-LE was diagnosed in 25/362 for a cumulative incidence of 7.3%. The median age was 49 years (range 20-68). Median symptom onset was on day + 19 (range 12-50). Initial symptoms included confusion in 19, retrograde amnesia in 11, and seizures in 5. Median HHV6 DNA levels in the CSF was 20000 (range, 200-500000) copies/ml. Median HHV6 DNA levels in peripheral blood was 1000 (range 0-300000) copies/ ml. Remarkably, 4 patients were negative for HHV6 in peripheral blood even within 2 days prior to the onset of CNS symptoms. MRI showed abnormal high signal intensity on fl air and T2 weighted images in the hippocampus and mesial temporal lobes in 70% of the patients. All were treated with foscarnet at 50-150 mg/kg of body weight, and clinical symptoms improved in 19 evaluable patients. The virus was cleared in the CSF successfully in 14 patients evaluated. Eighteen died with the median survival of 35 days (range, 5-978) from diagnosis of HHV6-LE. HHV6-LE was not a direct cause of death in any of them. None of the factors analyzed failed to reach statistical signifi cance regarding the impact on the onset of HHV6-LE. Conclusions: High incidence of HHV6-LE as well as reactivation of the virus was observed in CB recipients. HHV6 DNA monitoring in peripheral blood may not be always suffi cient to predict the development of HHV6-LE. Although clinical manifestations were severe in some cases, foscarnet therapy was effective in all evaluable cases.",

We compared outcomes in patients developing grade II-IV acute or extensive chronic GvHD in a study comparing oral voriconazole (VOR) to oral itraconazole suspension (ITR) for primary prophylaxis after alloHCT (the IMPROVIT study). Methods: We identifi ed study patients who developed Grade II or higher acute GvHD or chronic extensive GvHD at any time during the fi rst 180 days after transplant. We compared baseline patient characteristics, time to fi rst report of GvHD, and time to discontinuation of study drug in patients receiving VOR vs. ITR as primary prophylaxis. Distributions by treatment of categorical variables were compared using Fisher's Exact test, distributions of time to event (GvHD or duration on study drug) were compared using Kaplan-Meier estimates. We compared success of prophylaxis at days 100 and 180 using a composite endpoint that incorporated ability to tolerate study drug for at least 86 days, absence of proven or probable invasive fungal infections and survival to day 180. Results: 126/489 (25.8%) patients developed grade II-IV acute GvHD and/or chronic extensive GvHD during the study: 62 received VOR, 64 received ITR. Other than a higher proportion with acute lymphocytic leukemia in the VOR arm (24.2% vs. 9.4%; P = 0.032), there were no signifi cant differences in baseline characteristics between the 2 study arms. Mean time to fi rst report of GvHD was 49.6 for VOR vs. 37.6 days for ITR (P = 0.067). Success of prophylaxis was 61.3% vs. 43 .8% (P = 0.053) at day 100, and 50.0% vs. 29 .7% (P = 0.029) at day 180 after alloHCT for VOR and ITR respectively. Mean duration on study drug was 106.6 vs. 84.4 days (log rank P = 0.009) and proportion completing at least 86 days of study drug was 59.7% vs. 42.2% (P = 0.053) for VOR and ITR, respectively. Incidence of proven or probable IFI was low (1.6%) for both study treatments (1 probable pulmonary aspergillosis in each arm); neither IFI was considered treatment-emergent. Survival at day 180 was 80.6% vs. 76 .6% (VOR vs. ITR, P = NS). Conclusion: In patients with grade II-IV acute or chronic extensive GvHD following alloHCT, both VOR and ITR were effective in preventing IFI, but VOR was tolerated for a signifi cantly longer mean duration.",

The kinetics of CMV-immune-reconstitution are not fully understood, i.e. the time point of immune-reconstitution and the immunodominance of certain epitopes remain unclear. Monitoring the immune reconstitution for CMV using tetramers with epitopes from different immunogeneic viral proteins may help to understand the process more clearly. Here, we present data on 69 patients screened with at least 2 tetramers containing epitopes from either immediate early-1 (IE-1; B*0801 tetramer) or pp50 (A*0101 tetramer) or pp65 (A*0201, A*2402, B*0702 and B*3501 tetramers), respectively. Forty-six patients were screened with 2 tetramers (n = 46; 67%), 22 (32%) had 3 matching tetramers, while 1 patient could be screened with 4. The combination of IE-1-and pp50-tetramers was used in 23 patients (33%), pp65 and pp50 in 18 (26%) and pp65 and IE-1 in 11 patients (16%). The combination of all 3 tetramers was achieved in 17 patients (25%). Applying screening with these tetramer combinations, we found differences in patient responses within this group: in 10 patients CMV-CTL responded to the pp65-peptide, in another 10 mainly to pp50, while in 8 the IE-1-tetramer seemed to be dominant. 23 (33%) patients had at least one CMV-reactivation. In 9 patients a clear switch of immune-dominance could be shown by tetramer screening. Interestingly, while CMV-reactivation correlated with proliferation of the CMV-CTL recognizing the dominant epitope, the switch of immune-dominance did not correlate with episodes of CMV-reactivations, but followed different time lines. Seven of the 9 patients experienced CMVreactivations, and reactivation and switch occurred at different time points in 6, suggesting that rather engraftment of the donor immune system infl uenced immune dominance switching. In 2 patients switch of immune-dominance was associated with the onset of graft versus host disease (GvHD).",

Methods: This prospective, observational, multicenter study involved 30 HSCT Centers from Italy, started in January 2008 and is ongoing. Each Center reported data on consecutive patients who underwent HSCT and data were collected until 1 year from transplant. The data collection is ongoing and preliminary data are now reported. Results: To date, the baseline characteristics are available for 691 patients. Of them, 71 patients (10.3%) had experienced a proven/probable IFD before HSCT. They were 53 (74.6%) invasive aspergillosis (IA), 12 invasive candidosis (IC) and 6 IFDs by other fungi. Out of 515 patients evaluable at 100 days from HSCT, 53 (10.3%) developed a proven/probable IFD (IA, 46 cases; IC 5 cases; other IFDs, 2 cases). Out of 348 patients evaluable for the follow-up from 100 to 180 days from HSCT, 15 (4.3%) developed an IFD. Finally, 5 IFDs (2.6%) were documented among 190 patients evaluable for the follow-up from 180 to 365 days. Overall, according to these preliminary data, the incidence of IFDs at 1 year from HSCT seems higher than 15%. According to the data until now available at least 15% of patients with an IA diagnosed before HSCT experienced an infection recurrence within 100 days after transplant. Out of 58 cases of proven/probable IA documented after HSCT serum detection of Aspergillus galactomannan antigen contributed to the diagnosis in 45 cases (77.6%). At a preliminary analysis, the 3 months mortality rate for HSCT recipients with an IFD was lower than 30%. Conclusion: This is a prospective study on the \"real life\" epidemiology of IFDs in allogeneic HSCT population. The available data show that IA remains the most commonly identifi ed IFD and rates of survival appear to have improved, compared with historical literature data.",

Serum IL-7 and soluble IL-7R concentrations were measured by ELISA. Results: CD8 + T-cells show decreased IL-7 responsiveness both in PTLD + and PTLD-individuals defi ned by STAT5 phosphorylation. In contrast, CD4 + T-cells from PTLD patients, but not from (EBV + ), PTLD-individuals show a markedly reduced capacity to respond to IL-7.

Methods: In this phase II, multicenter, non-randomized study, we evaluated the safety and tolerability of liposomal amphotericin B as antifungal primary prophylaxis for Pts undergoing allo-SCT from alternative donors. The Pts received AmBisome\u00ae 3 mg/kg three times a week from day before transplantation to day + 22 (total 8 doses), and 7 mg/kg weekly from the day 29 to the 8th week (total 4 doses); in case of graft versus host disease (GvHD) requiring immunosuppressive therapy additional 7 mg/kg weekly doses were administered until week 16. The effi cacy and the incidence of proven or probable IFI during treatment were secondary endpoints. Results: From August 2007 to December 2008, a total of 34 Pts (mean age 44.9 years, range 20-67; 18 males) were enrolled in the study. 13 Pts (38.2%) were affected by acute myeloid leukemia, 9 Pts (26.5%) by acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 12 Pts (35.2%) by other hematological malignancies; 13 Pts (38.2%) were in complete remission, 8 Pts (23.5%) in progressive disease; 20 Pts underwent matched unrelated donor (MUD) and 14 haploidentical allo-SCT; 23 Pts (67.6%) received a myeloablative conditioning regimen. All Pts received the 3 mg/kg regimen, while 23/34 Pts continued with 7 mg/kg, with a mean of 7 (range 1-8) and 3 (range 1-4) administration respectively; 1 patient received 7 additional doses for the occurrence of GvHD. No nephrotoxicity was observed in 22 Pts (64.7%) receiving 3 mg/kg and in 13 (54.2%) receiving 7 mg/kg; in the 7 mg/kg group, 6 Pts (25%) experienced grade 2 nephrotoxicity, while no grade 3 or 4 toxicity was reported. Hypokalemia was predominantly observed as grade 1 toxicity: 19 Pts (55.9%) in the 3 mg/kg group and 11 Pts (45.8%) in the 7 mg/kg group; 3 Pts (12.5%) in the 7 mg/kg group experienced grade 4 hypokalemia. IFI were reported in 5/34 (14.7%) Pts: 1 proven, 1 probable, 3 possible according to the EORTC criteria 2002. The overall survival rate in the entire population was 50%. Conclusions: A 3 mg/kg regimen three times a week followed by 7 mg/kg weekly administration of AmBisome\u00ae is a tolerable and safe antifungal primary prophylaxis in high-risk Pts undergoing allo-SCT from alternative donors. Hypokalemia following the 7 mg/kg dose should be adequately prevented to further reduce concomitant toxicities.",

Twentynine patients had multiple myeloma, sixty-three a lymphoproliferative disease (HD, NHL, CLL). Twenty-seven patients received ASCT for a resistant disease, whereas 65 for a newly diagnosed disease. The median number of prior chemotherapy cycles was 2 (range: 1-4). Thirty-six patients received anti-CD-20 antibody as a part of the frontline therapy before ASCT. The conditioning regimen was BEAM for 47/92 patients, high-dose Melphalan for 28/92 patients and BAVC or Busulphan/Endoxan for the remaining 17 patients. Sixty-six patients received peripheral blood stem cells rescue after high dose therapy, whereas 26 got bone marrow stem cells. CMV reactivations were monitored twice weekly with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in all patients, starting after the engraftment. Twenty-fi ve out of 92 patients (27%) presented a CMV reactivation. The vast majority of patients (17/25, 68%) reactivated CMV after 30 or more days from transplant. Moreover, 15/25 patients (60%) presenting a CMV reactivation had received prior Rituximab. Ten out of 25 patients (40%) presented symptoms such as fever, vomiting, arthralgia or profound asthenia at reactivation. Moreover, CMV reactivation was associated with moderate to severe neutropenia in 8/25 patients. All patients reactivating CMV were treated with intravenous (iv) ganciclovir given 7.5 mg/kg once daily. They received antiviral therapy for a median of 20 days (range: 6-40). All patients achieved a negativization of CMV-specifi c PCR after a median of 12 days of therapy (range: 9-34). Discontinuation of antiviral therapy required at least two consecutively negative PCRs performed at least 3 days apart each other. None of the patient developed a CMV disease. Moreover, no late CMV reactivations were observed during the longterm follow-up period. In conclusion, our experience clearly demonstrates that a signifi cant proportion of patients submitted to ASCT develop a CMV reactivation after transplant, frequently symptomatic, requiring antiviral therapy. We underline the necessity of a stringent monitoring of CMV reactivation after ASCT, specially for patients receiving therapy with anti-B lymphocytes monoclonal antibodies before transplant.",

Ohta, K. Ishiwata, N. Nakano, M. Tsuji, Y. Asano-Mori, N. Uchida, K. Masuoka, A. Wake, A. Yoneyama, S. Makino, S. Taniguchi Toranomon Hospital (Tokyo, JP) Background: Given that unrelated cord blood transplantation (uCBT) is associated with a relatively low number and functionally immature donor T cells, and frequent donor-recipient HLA disparity, it has been speculated that the risk of EBV-associated posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (EBV-PTLD) after uCBT may be increased. Objective and method: To investigate the incidence and clinical features of EBV-PTLD after uCBT, we retrospectively analyzed 341 patients underwent uCBT from January 2002 to December 2008 at Toranomon Hospital. Diagnosis of EBV-PTLD was made only when both biopsy-proven specimen and EBVviremia were present. Result: Five cases of EBV-PTLD were identifi ed, with cumulative incidence of 1.8% at 2 years. The median-age was 52 years (range: 50-66). Three patients underwent transplantation for leukemia and 2 for aplastic anemia. EBV-PTLDs were diagnosed at 120 to 803 days (median, 280 days) after uCBT, with 4 of 5 patients having chronic graft-versus-host disease, and 3 of 5 patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment. Three developed lymphadenopathy, while other symptoms at onset were nonspecifi c, such as fever in 3, liver dysfunction in 2, and diarrhea in 3. Immunosuppressant was decreased in those who were under the therapy, and rituximab was administered to all patients. All had responded to the treatment and, so far, no patient died due to EBV-PTLD. Conclusion: The incidence of EBV-PTLD after uCBT appears similar to that observed after transplantation using other sources. These fi ndings suggested that uCBT may not be a risk of developing EBV-PTLD. The initial manifestations may not be directly suggestive of EBV-PTLD, and it should be taken into consideration whenever patients have nonspecifi c symptoms without other reasons.",

Fenk, I. Bruns, R. Haas, G. Kobbe University Hospital Dusseldorf (Dusseldorf, DE) After the fi rst identifi cation of a new Infl uenza A strain (H1N1) over 450.000 infections resulting in up to 10.000 deaths around the world have been reported. Recipients of autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantations (SCT) are at substantial risk for infections based on a compromised immune system. However, there is little knowledge about the clinical course of H1N1 infections in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. We report here on the clinical courses of 7 HSCT recipients with H1N1 infections observed at our department. Four patients presented with fatigue and fever and H1N1 virus was detected by PCR. With regard to transplant and disease status two patients had received an auto-SCT after high dose chemotherapy for Hogdkin's Disease (HD) respectively multiple myeloma (MM) 141 and 954 days ago. While the HD patient was in CR at the time of H1N1 infection, the MM patient received dexamethasone/velcade for progressive disease. The 2 other patients had received allo-SCT after myeloablative conditioning. One patient with AML was in CR (d + 255) still requiring tacrolimus for chronic GvHD. The other patient suffered from relapse of CMML (d + 767) receiving 5-aza and DLI. Receiving oseltamivir (75 mg 2 \u00d7 /d for 10 d) all patients got PCR-negative and free of symptoms within 1 week. Three other patients presented with fever, dry cough and dyspnea. Two of them had received allo-SCT after myeloablative conditioning for CML and were in CR (d + 956/ + 1456). One patient still required tacrolimus for chronic GVHD. The other had a normal immune status. H1N1 virus was detected by PCR and chest X-ray showed atypical pneumonia in both patients. They were admitted to hospital and received oseltamivir (75 mg 2x/d for 10 d) leading to disappearance of symptoms and virus elimination. The third patient with progressive light chain MM (d + 904 after auto-SCT), renal failure and humoral defi ency suffered from a H1N1-associated pneumonia with bacterial and viral superinfections. Despite oseltamvir therapy she still requires mechanical ventilation for 37 days being still PCR-positive for H1N1. Clinical courses of H1N1 infections in HCST recipients seem to range individually and cannot predicted on the basis of disease and immune status. Since symptoms of a H1N1 infection are unspecifi c and often found in HSCT recipients, but can result in fatal clinical courses, we suggest early testing for H1N1 virus in this group of patients especially in this pandemic situation.

Our generic stimulation cocktail contained 23 EBV peptides derived from 11 EBV antigens and covering 14 HLA class I and II allotypes. Six patients with PTLD received one transfusion of EBV-specifi c T cells. Progressive disease was seen in three patients who suffered from late-stage disease with multiorgan dysfunction at the time of T cell transfer. However, in three patients who received T cells at an earlier stage of disease, we observed complete and stable remission of PTLD. Two patients have remained free from EBV-associated disease for more than two years. In these patients, CD8 + T cells specifi c for EBV immediate-early and early antigens rapidly expanded after T-cell transfer, peaked at over 20% of peripheral blood lymphocytes, and were maintained at 8% or more for six months. Later, EBV-specifi c T cells remained present at lower levels throughout the observation period. For the fi rst months, the overall T cell repertoire was oligoclonal. Later, the repertoire became more polyclonal, coincident with the emergence of naive T cells, an inversion of the CD4 + /CD8 + ratio, and a contraction of numbers of EBV-specifi c T cells down to levels typical for healthy carriers. Thus, the infusion of small numbers of directly isolated EBV-specifi c T cells was followed by a rapid, intense and sustained reconstitution of a protective EBV-specifi c T cell memory.",

Up until now, the infl uence of distinct Aspergillus fumigatus molecules on the human innate immune system is largely unexplored. Methods: We have characterized the interaction between the A. fumigatus antigens Aspf1 and Crf1 and human monocytederived immature dendritic cells (iDC), respectively. Antigens were recombinantly expressed in the Pichia pastoris system and subsequently used for stimulation experiments, which allowed quantifying gene expression (by qRT-PCR) and secretion of cytokines and chemokines (by ELISA assays) in iDC, to localize microscopically Aspf1 and to determine its capacity to induce apoptosis in iDCs. Furthermore, by mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR), we have analyzed whether iDCs loaded with Aspf1 are able to induce T-cell proliferation. Results: Compared to Crf1, Aspf1 showed a high ability to specifi cally stimulate iDCs as demonstrated by an increased expression of genes encoding for pro-infl ammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-12p35, TNFa) and chemokines (CXCL10, CCL20, IL-8). By using germlings of a deletion mutant for Aspf1 (dAspf1) in confrontation assays with iDCs, increased protein secretion compared to stimulation with wild type morphologies was detectable. Apoptosis of iDCs was markedly induced after cocultivation with Aspf1. MLR revealed that iDCs were not able to present Aspf1 to autologous T-cells. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that recombinant A. fumigatus antigens are able to effi ciently stimulate iDCs in vitro; these observations might potentially lead to the development of a new therapeutic and/or prophylactic option to prevent and treat this devastating infection in high risk patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

Van Den Neste UCL, Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc (Brussels, BE) Clostridium diffi cile (C. diffi cile) is a leading cause of nosocomial diarrhea. We performed a study to know whether surveillance cultures and early therapy could avoid toxicities associated with C. diffi cile in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). We also collected data on the prevalence and relapse of C. diffi cile in these patients. Since 1988, biweekly surveillance stool cultures for C. diffi cile were performed in the patients admitted to the hematology wards. 377 patients have had an allo-HSCT. Data from stool cultures for C. diffi cile and detection of toxin A and/or B, were obtained in 368. The treatment policy was to prescribe metronidazole (500 mg tid for 10 days) as soon as a positive culture result was transmitted. In 152 patients (40%) one or more episodes with a positive culture for C. diffi cile were recorded (before allo-HSCT: 40 patients, at allo-HSCT: 72, before and at allo-HSCT: 22, after allo-HSCT: 20). In 59, a positive culture was associated with toxin A or B (tox + ). In 94 patients (25%), C. diffi cile (tox + , n = 41; tox-, n = 53) was cultured during hospitalization for allo-HSCT. Relapse of C. diffi cile occurred in 22 of the positive patients (35%). The cumulative incidence of relapse of C. diffi cile did not differ between tox + and tox-. A positive culture for C. diffi cile (either tox + or tox-) did not affect the toxic mortality in allo-HSCT. C. diffi cile infection (either tox + or tox-) was not associated with any increase in graft-versus-host disease. Acute gut GvHD grade \u2265 2 occurred in 22 patients. In 5 of them C. diffi cile was cultured during hospitalization (NS). Conclusions: 1. The prevalence of C. diffi cile infections in allo-HSCT recipients is high. 2. Despite therapy with metronidazole, a third of the patients who have had C. diffi cile relapsed. 3 . There is no relationship between acute GvHD of the gut and C. diffi cile infection. 4 . In allo-HSCT, surveillance cultures and early therapy could avoid non-relapse complications caused by C. diffi cile infections.",

Takahashi In this study, we investigated to fi nd graft-and patient-related factors affecting to CMV reactivation after HLA-mismatched CBT and the impact of CMV reactivation to clinical outcome of CBT in adults. Patients and methods: We studied the clinical outcomes of 152 consecutive adult patients who received CBT between 1998 and 2009. All patients received myeloablative regimens including 12 Gy of TBI, CsA plus short term MTX for GVHD prophylaxis and almost the same supportive care. In graft-versus-host direction, 7 were antigen-matched, 53 were 1 antigenand 92 were 2 antigens-mismatched in HLA-A, -B and -DR loci by low-resolution method. After engraftment, all patients were monitored using a CMV antigenemia assay with C10/C11 monoclonal antibodies twice a week during hospitalization. Twentyeight (18%) were suffered from 10 times or more positive results defended as the higher-frequent positivity (H) and 124 (82%) were categorized as lower-frequent positivity or negative (L). If antigenemia assay was positive, 5 mg/kg ganciclovir was started as preemptive therapy. We evaluated clinical factors correlated with CMV antigenemia positivity by the Chi-square test and the impact of positive antigenemia on clinical results using the Pepe and Mori's test. OS rate was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed by the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis has performed using the Competing risk regression and the Cox regression. Results: OS and DFS rates were 73% and 69% at 3 years, respectively. One patient (14%) in HLA-matched, 7 (13%) in 1 antigen-mismatched and 20 (22%) in 2 antigens-mismatched patients showed H (ns). CMV antibody positivity (P = 0.032) and use of steroid after transplant (P < 0.001) signifi cantly affected to H. Patients with H stayed in hospital signifi cantly longer (median: 161.5 days) than L (105 days) in multivariate analysis (P = 0.037). The incidence of chronic GVHD in patients with H (65% at 1 year) tended to be higher than L (22%, P = 0.083). OS rate in patients with H was lower (61% at 3 years) than with L (74%), but the difference was not signifi cant. Conclusion: HLA disparities in CBT were not affected to CMV antigenemia results. Longer stay in hospital was needed in high-frequent CMV reactivated patients after CBT.",

Known risk factors include unrelated or mismatched donors, Tcell depletion and immunosuppressive treatment. The monitoring of EBV DNA load by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is mandatory to reveal early EBV reactivation and start a pre-emptive treatment with anti-CD-20 monoclonal antibody rituximab. Until now no consensus was established on the suitable blood compartment for the quantifi cation of EBV DNAemia between whole blood (WB) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). With this aim, we retrospectively analyzed 146 consecutive pts who underwent allogeneic HSCT at the transplantation centre of Florence and Udine from January 2007 to August 2009. 49 pts received an HSCT from identical sibling, 97 from an unrelated donor. Diagnosis were: AML 64, ALL 19, lymphoproliferative diseases 32, CMS 11, MDS 6, MM 10, other 3; median age was 43 yrs (range 17-67); 81 were male and 65 female; 91 pts received conventional conditioning and 55 reduced intensity one. 31 pts received a TBI based conditioning; 85 pts received ATG as T-depletion. Stem cell source was peripheral blood in 99 pts, bone marrow in 37 and cord blood in 10 pts (at least 4/6 mismatched). All pts were weekly monitored from the engraftment for EBV DNAemia by real time PCR on PBMC in 76 pts (group 1) and on WB in 70 pts (group 2). EBV reactivation was defi ned as EBV DNA load > 1.000 copies/105/ PBMC or > 1000 copies/ml/WB and pts received rituximab as preemptive treatment till negativity of EBV DNAemia and resolution of clinical manifestations. 33/146 (23%) patients experienced EBV reactivation, with EBV DNA copies > 1000 (range 1000- 1.432 .127 viral copies), 9 pts developed PTLD (6%). The incidence of EBV reactivation was different between the two groups of monitoring: 12% in group 1 vs. 34.3% in group 2 (p 0.001). Moreover PTLD incidence resulted higher in group1 (7.9% vs. 4 .3%). All pts received a median number of 2 cycles of Rituximab: 4 cycles in group 1 vs. one in group 2. In conclusion in our experience real time PCR monitoring allowed early detection of EBV reactivation that resulted signifi cant different on the basis of the blood samples analyzed, suggesting that it could not be applied the same DNAemia cut-off for defi ning EBV reactivation and starting pre-emptive therapy.",

The neurological evaluation showed weakness on the inferior limbs with impairment in the erect posing, moderate distal sensory disturbance and absence of deep tendon refl exes. The cereberospinal fl uid was negative also for neurotropic agents including EBV by PCR. Serum antibodies against anti-GD1b ganglioside IgG (1:2300) and anti-sulfatide IgG (1:3500) were positive. The fi ndings of nerve conduction studies were consistent with a sensorimotor demyelinating polineuropathy mainly to the inferior limbs, and the nuclear magnetic resonance of the encephalon was negative. The patient was treated with high dose intravenous immunoglobulines and then with fi ve plasma-exchange procedures and Rituximab with improvement of both clinical and neurological fi ndings and negativity of EBV on PCR assay and of anti-Gd1b ganglioside and anti-sulfatide serum antibodies. After 7 months of follow-up patient is ambulatory on monthly maintenance with rituximab, with full chimerism and no evidence of EBV or chronic GvHD. Conclusions: in our experience plasma-exchange and rituximab were effi cacy in extinguish both B-cells deregulated proliferation and EBV reactivation that could act a trigger for GBS development.",

Although the diagnostics modalities including CT scan and laboratory adjunct markers, and the therapeutic strategies with newer mold-active agents have been developed, the real impact of these developments on a prognosis of IA in allogeneic HSCT recipients is still unclear. Patients and methods: To reveal the alterations in the clinical characteristics and outcome of IA over time, we retrospectively analyzed the records of 221 adult patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT for the fi rst time from February, 2000 to March, 2008 at University of Tokyo Hospital. Results: Thirty-fi ve patients had proven (n = 9) or probable (n = 26) IA according to the EORTC 2002 criteria at a median of 178 days (range 21-1526 days) after HSCT, with a cumulative incidence of 17.3%. The development of IA was associated with neutropenia at an early period after HSCT in 4 patients, and the immunosuppressive therapy for graft-versus-host disease in 26. Thirty-three patients (94.3%) had pulmonary disease including 2 with dissemination and 1 with tracheobronchitis, and the remaining one each showed sinusitis and gastrointestinal involvement, respectively. Among 29 patients who underwent chest CT scan, the diameter of nodules or infi ltrates was within 1.5 cm in 17 patients, between 1.5 to 3 cm in 6 and larger than 3 cm in 6, which had no tendency to become smaller across the years. Thirty patients showed positive galactomannan (GM) antigenemia defi ned as two consecutive results with O.D.I above 0.6, which occurred at a median of 14 days prior to diagnosis in 17 and served as the initial trigger for further examinations instead of clinical symptoms or CT fi ndings in 11. IA was the principal cause of death in 7 patients. A trend for the declined IA-related mortality was observed after the approval of micafungin in December 2002 (9.4% vs. 38.5%, P = 0.073).",

Ammer, K. Landfried, A. Hautmann, B. Holler, D. Wolff, G. Hildebrandt, J. Hahn, R. Andreesen, E. Holler Internal Medicine I (Regensburg, DE) Objective: Fungal infections such as aspergillosis and severe graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) affecting the lung, especially bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), are the most serious long term complications following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Furthermore, patients suffering from BO frequently present with fungal superinfections. Recently, IFN-gamma has been suggested as an additive treatment in haematological patients with infections resistant to conventional antimycotic treatment. In addition, our group has reported heterozygous NOD2/CARD15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) indicating a diminished antimicrobial defense as risk factors of BO. As IFN-gamma has been shown to strongly induce NOD2/ CARD15 expression, we speculated that immunomodulation by IFN-gamma might improve antimicrobial defense in patients suffering from BO. Methods: In a pilot series, 5 patients received a total of 7 courses of subcutaneous injections of IFN-gamma 3 times a week for an average of 182 weeks. Indications were resistant invasive aspergillosis (4 pulmonary, 1 with concomitant BO, 1 sinuses), atypical mycobacterial infection in a patient with BO and therapy resistant and ventilator dependent BO with bacterial superinfection in another patient. Results: Pulmonary aspergillosis and infections improved clinically and by CT scan in all patients. CT signs of BO improved in 2 of 3 patients with BO and were stable in the 3rd patient. Impressively, the ventilator dependent patient could be wheaned with marked improvement of hypercapnia and another BO patient became oxygen-independent, whereas obstruction did not change in pulmonary function tests. There were no negative effects on extrapulmonary symptoms of acute or chronic GvHD. Hematological side effects were tolerable although moderate anemia might be induced. Conclusion: Our preliminary results suggest that IFN-gamma can be savely used to treat fungal infections resistant to antimycotic treatment in recipients of allogeneic SCT. In addition, IFNgamma might result in benefi cial immunomodulation restoring homeostasis in epithelial GvHD as it is also suggested by recent experimental data on allogeneic SCT in IFN-gamma knockout mice. Further data and a prospective trial addressing this treatment option are needed.",

Santoro Istituto Clinico Humanitas (Rozzano, IT) Background: Empirical antifungal therapy based on the persistence of fever after 5-7 days of broad spectrum antibiotic treatment is considered the standard treatment in neutropenic patients. This approach can result in overtreatment, increasing toxicity and cost. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the feasibility of pre-emptive strategy. Materials and methods: We reviewed records of 386 patients who underwent autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for hematological malignancies from January 2002 to December 2008. Patients who met usual criteria to start empirical antifungal therapy such as fever (> 38\u00b0C) at least for 5 consecutive days or relapsing after introduction of antibiotic treatment were included. Conditioning regimen and patients characteristics are reported in Table 1 . All patients received a yeast prophylaxis with fl uconazole 100 mg from the beginning of conditioning regimen to the neutrophil recovery. A diagnostic work up was performed, consisting of chest X-ray, thoracic high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), galactomannan enzyme immunoassay (GM-EIA), urine Legionella antigenemia and clinical oriented investigations. Patients with HRCT positivity underwent to bronchoalveolar lavage or lung biopsy (Figure 1 ). Primary endpoints were the impact of pre-emptive strategy on antifungal drugs administration and invasive fungal infections (IFI) related mortality. Results: Twenty one neutropenic febrile episodes were analyzed in this study. A pre-emptive antifungal treatment was given in 5 episodes driven by HRCT positivity. Two episodes met EORTC criteria for IFI possible, the remaining three were classifi ed as pneumonia without microbiologic identifi cation (2) and with positive blood cultures (1). Despite a positive HRCT, three febrile episodes were not given any antifungal therapy since there was a microbiologic identifi cation from blood cultures (2) and a non IFI suggestive imaging (1) . No antifungal therapy was started in the remaining 13 episodes, in which diagnostic work-up revealed bacteriemia (4), local catheter S220 infection (3), neutropenic typhlitis (2) or fever of unknown origin (FUO) (5). Finally we reported a 76% reduction in the use of antifungal drugs with an IFI-related mortality of 0%. Conclusion: The pre-emptive approach is safe and it reduces notably the rate of empirical antifungal use in febrile neutropenic patients after autologous HSCT without increasing IFI-related mortality.",

In early studies the dose-limiting toxicities of foscarnet were found to be nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity, but later studies showed these adverse events were less frequent and did not resulted in the problems for clinical use. Most studies in the literature only involved patients who had received foscarnet as an initial treatment. Therefore, we conducted a survey in Japan of the use of foscarnet against CMV infection after related HSCT and compared its effi cacy and toxicity in patients with and without prior ganciclovir treatment. Foscarnet was used in 320 patients ( The initial dose of foscarnet ranged from 7 mg/kg to 216 mg/kg (median: 88 mg/kg, Figure 1 ). The dose was signifi cantly higher in the patients who had received prior treatment with ganciclovir (range: 10-216 mg/kg, median: 91 mg/kg) than those who had not (range: 7-180 mg/kg, median: 72 mg/kg) (P < 0.0001). The response rate in symptom was 52% for the CMV disease patients. Antigenemia disappeared in 77% of the preemptive treatment and improved in 13% of the patients. No outbreak of CMV disease was recognized. The total effectiveness of therapeutic and preemptive use was signifi cantly higher for patients without prior ganciclovir (91% vs. 76%, P = 0.001). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher were recognized in 24%, including electrolyte abnormalities in 11%, neutropenia in 8%, and thrombocytopenia in 8%. Renal damage was only observed in 3% of patients. Foscarnet was concluded to be a safe and effective anti-CMV agent and to be a suitable alternative to ganciclovir. Further prospective evaluations of foscarnet are warranted.",

Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 123 consecutive children who received HSCT between January 2004 and December 2008. Sixty one patients were treated by caspofungin at least 3 days, from the beginning of conditioning regimen until the 60th day post-transplant (dose: 50 mg/m\u00b2). Three groups of caspofungin treatment have been identifi ed: group 1 received empiric therapy, group 2 received secondary prophylaxis and group 3 was treated for fungal infection occurring during HSCT process. In group 3 caspofungin was given in combination with voriconazole (3) or liposomal amphotericin B (2). Success of the treatment was evaluated according to following criteria: non-occurrence of fungal infection for group 1, absence of fungal infection recurrence for group 2 and fungal infection resolution in group 3. Results: Among the 61 patients treated by Caspofungin, 36 had HSCT for malignancies and 25 for other diseases. Median age at HSCT was 9,2 years. Donors were of unrelated origin for 38 patients, familial HLA identical siblings for 20 and familial haploidentical for 3. Forty two patients were in the group 1 (empiric), 14 in group 2 (secondary prophylaxis for aspergillosis (n = 4) or for disseminated candidiasis (n = 9), missing data for 1) and 5 in group 3 (as curative treatment for aspergillosis (n = 4) or candidiasis (n = 1)).

Polymerase chain reaction-(PCR-) based assays able to detect DNA from Aspergillus and Candida species have been reported to precede clinical diagnosis of IFI, enabling pre-emptive or early treatment. We performed a prospective study to evaluate a PCR-based pre-emptive approach. Methods: Ninety-nine patients undergoing reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) HSCT were followed once a week with fungal PCR during the fi rst 100 days post-transplantation. Patients who tested positive were randomized to treatment with liposomal amphotericin B or to no treatment. After day 100, PCR tests were performed only on clinical suspicion of IFI. Results: Forty-one patients had at least one positive PCR test (Aspergillus, n = 18; Candida, n = 29; both, n = 6). A single positive PCR test was not associated with IFI irrespective of whether or not there had been administration of pre-emptive liposomal amphotericin B. After day 100, PCR tests for Aspergillus did not contribute to diagnosis of proven or probable invasive aspergillosis (IA). The cumulative incidence rates of proven or probable IFI, IA, and invasive candidiasis during the fi rst year after transplantation were 12%, 9%, and 2%, respectively. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of grades II CIV (P = 0.0014), CMV-seronegative recipient with CMV-seropositive donor (P \u2264 0.001), and conditioning with alemtuzumab (P = 0.014) were signifi cant risk factors for developing IA in a multivariate model. Conclusions: PCR of peripheral blood is a poor predictor of invasive fungal infection after allogeneic HSCT.",

Gurman Ankara University (Ankara, TR) The incidence of hepatotoxic morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (Allo-HCT) in patients positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg + ) may increase, but it has been not well studied. We aimed to analyze the reactivation rate and impact of reactivation on early transplant-related complications in a retrospective single reference center. We detected 23 HBsAg + patients (3.8%) who underwent allo-HCT (n = 680) in the past decade. Median age was 33 years and M/F: 22/1. In 20 patients pretransplant liver function tests were within normal range and HBV-DNA were negative. The conditioning were based on myeloablative (n = 20) or fl udarabine based-reduced intensity regimen (n = 3). Lamivudin prophylaxis was initiated 100 mg p.o per day in 14 patients with the initiation of conditioning regimen and was continued until 6 to 12 months till the cessation of immunosuppression. Six patients had HBsAg + donor, 5 were seropositive (antiHBs with antiHBc IgG, 3 antiHBs alone and 6 were HBV naive. The data of HBV serology was not available in 3 donors. HBV reactivation was observed in 7 patients after a median 4.5 months (range, 0.87-23.5) follow-up. Interestingly all the patients with HBV reactivation received myeloablative conditioning. At the time of reactivation there was an increase of serum ALT (2.5 x UNL-54 UNL) and serum HBV-DNA. We observed reactivation only in a single under lamivudine prophylaxis (7.6% vs. 60%. P = 0.012) while another patient experienced a reactivation 2 months after cessation of prophylaxis. Two patients with HBV reactivation had HBsAg positive donors. Lamivudin treatment was initiated in 5 patients after reactivation. Lamivudin resistance was observed only in two patients, who were switched to second line antiviral treatment. One of those patients was lost due to fulminant hepatic failure. The incidences of acute or chronic liver graft versus host disease were not affected by the HBV reactivation. The HBV reactivation is one of the most undesired complications of chemo/immunosuppressive treatment in HBsAg positive Allo-HCT recipients. The prophylaxis with lamivudine could signifi cantly decrease the frequency of HBV reactivation. But the development of the lamivudine resistance is another problem reported in patients requiring long-term treatment. In conclusion, our study has shown that HBsAg + recipients did not have a strong exclusion for allo-HCT under effective lamivudine prophylaxis.",

Seventy-nine pts received an allo-SCT and twenty-fi ve pts received an autologous SCT (auto-SCT). In the fi rst group, the reactivation rate was 60.7%, while in the second group it was of 17.4% (P = 0.0002). The median time of EBV reactivation was 115 days (range 53-870) in auto-SCT group and 59 days (range 3-840) in allo-SCT group. Hence allo-SCT pts showed a faster EBV reactivation (P = 0.031); graft from an unrelated donor was associated with an higher rate of EBV reactivation and with a earlier reactivation.

Perno (1) There was no correlation between demographic variables and detection of KIV and WUV. Phylogenetic analysis of the small t-antigen gene of KIV and WUV isolates showed that the novel polyomaviruses identifi ed in feces clustered with those identifi ed in the respiratory tract suggesting an oral-fecal transmission of these viruses. Conclusions: The novel polyomaviruses KI and WU may reactivate in SCT setting and the oral-fecal contamination is suggested. Further studies on a larger sample size are needed to defi ne their pathogenic role on the clinical outcome of immunocompromised hosts.",

Different clinical manifestations have been described including fever, skin rash; it has been also demonstrated that HHV-7 can induce reactivation of other beta--herpesviruses (CMV and HHV-6). We want to measure prevalence of the Background: Epstein-Bar virus (EBV) associated post-transplant lympho-proliferative disorder (PTLD) is a serious complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Recent attention has focused on early diagnosis and pre-emptive treatment with rituximab, an anti CD20 monoclonal antibody. At present there is no standardized guideline for the management of post-HSCT EBV reactivation. Methods: In an attempt to establish uniform practice guidelines, we adopted an algorithm based on existing literature for monitoring and pre-emptive treatment for EBV infection in patients considered to be at high risk for the development of EBV PTLD like recipients of haplo-identical or cord blood transplantation, and those who received anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) or other T-cell depleting therapies. Patients were monitored weekly by quantitative EBV-PCR starting at Day 20 after transplantation. Patients with rising EBV copies of greater than 1000/ml in whole blood (two consecutive samples) were pre-emptively treated with rituximab 375 mg/m\u00b2 once a week until viral clearance or up to a maximum of 4 doses. Safety and effi cacy were monitored prospectively. Results: Between 2007-09, 20 out of 59 high-risk patients (34%), developed EBV reactivation with a median time of occurrence being 63.7 days post-HSCT (range: 26-347 days). Median number of EBV copies/ml in blood at the time of diagnosis was 2300 (range: 1000-5000). Eight patients received rituximab secondary to rising titer for a median number of 2 weekly doses (range: 1-4) and all of them showed viral clearance. Two patients required repeat dosing of rituximab secondary to recurrence. CD19 count was undetectable (median 1%; range 0-1%) in all patients for 3-6 months after receiving rituximab and then improved in all surviving patients (6 out of 8).",

CMV infection in healthy person is usually asymptomatic, however, the virus has the ability to become latent in the host. Primary infection or reactivation of latent CMV in an immunocompromised patient such as HSCT transplant recipients, can lead to morbidity and mortality. Twenty-fi ve percent of the donors were also infected with HCMV. The relative prevalence of UL55 genotypes was gB2> gB3> gB1> gB4 in plasma, gB2> gB1> gB3> gB4 in buffy coat and gB2> gB3> gB1> gB4 in urine.

A.A. Banan, M. Ramzi A.A. Banan, M. Ramzi Myelosuppression has been observed in association with specifi c underlying diseases like aplastic anemia or myelodysplasia in HSCT patients. Conclusions: We conclude that the likelihood of being HCMV positivity is higher in females and increase with age. There are strong differences in the probabilities of being CMV positive with Nested-PCR result between patients transplanted with different diagnosis. We have determined that death due to Mylosuppression in CMV-infected marrow transplant recipients is associated with particular CMV genotypes.",

Pinto Ospedale Ferrarotto (Catania, IT) The place of palifermin after autologous HSC transplantation remains an unsettled issue and confl icting results have been reported. In our Institution Palifermin has been employed in a cohort of 40 patients treated with autologous HSC transplantation and receiving a conditioning regimens based on chemotherapy. Results have been compared to those obtained in a set of 150 patients not receiving palifermin. The control group were patients transplanted in the 2 years period antecedent and subsequent in respect to the time in which palifermin was administered. The two groups treated with palifermin or not treated were not signifi cantly different for age, sex, diagnosis, stage of disease at transplant, number of previous chemotherapy, number of Neutrophils at admission, conditioning type used, prophylactic use of G-CSF, number of infused CD34 + cells. Treatment with palifermin was well tolerated. 29 pts/40 (72%) had skin rashes and oedema involving face and extremities but not requiring interruption of treatment. In palifermin treated cohort we observed a signifi cant reduction of NPT need (11% versus 88%, P = 0.0001) and of morphine use (2,9% versus 25,8%; P = 0.01), length of hospital stay was signifi cantly reduced (discharge at day + 12.0 versus day + 16.0; P = 0.0001). Patients treated with palifermin had a reduced frequency of FUO (22% versus 40%, P = 0.05) and a trend for a reduction in severe infections (gram-negative bacteremia or pulmonary infections: 2,5% versus 11,3%; P = 0.09). In patients treated by palifermin as a whole group, we were unable to observed a reduction in mucositis score (maximum score DMS for mucositis: 32% versus 35%; P = 0.75). However, a reduction of mucositis maximum grade was observed when stratum of patients receiving conditioning other than HD-PAM were analysed (P = 0.01). Neutrophils engraftment was not different in the two groups, median day for N > 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L was 11.5 versus 12.5 (P = 0.07).",

In the last years new drugs were developed with a broad spectum of activity against yeasts and moulds. Objectives: In our Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, due to local epidemiology, in the last years we performed antifungal prophylaxis with voriconazole (V.) for patients (pts) undergoing allo-HSCT. We retrospectively analized the incidence of breakthrough fungal infections in the neutropenic period post allo-HSCT in this cohort of pts. (16 pts), 2 pts stopped the drug (intolerance/reversible toxicity); no one pts in the group of V. as secondary prophylaxis. In the cohort of cord blood HSCT with V. as primary prophylaxis (9 pts), 3 pts stopped the drug (CT scan suggestive for fungal infection). In the cohort of HLA-identical sibling donor no one pts stopped V. Conclusions: Voriconazole is effective and safe as primary or secondary antifungal prophylaxis in high-risk hematological patients undergoing allo-HSCT in the neutropenic period, with a low incidence of breakthrough fungal infections. A prospective study with serum drug monitoring of voriconazole will be run for optimizing the drug serum concentration.",

Raepple, A. Finck, J. Finke, H. Bertz University of Freiburg Medical Center (Freiburg, DE) Sepsis in neutropenic patients is a serious complication and a major cause of treatment related mortality (TRM) in hematological patients (pts). Especially pts undergoing stem cell transplantation (SCT) or high dose chemotherapy are prone to develop bacterial or fungal blood stream infections in the induction or peri-transplant (cytopenia until hematological reconstitution, immunosuppression) setting. Early detection and identifi cation of the underlying pathogen play a crucial role in successful treatment. Gold standard diagnostic procedures are blood cultures taken before empirical application or escalation of broad-spectrum antibiotics followed by customized therapy according to the identifi ed species and antibiogram. Usually this requires at least 48-72 hours. PCR based systems detect and identify the presence of the most common microorganisms associated with sepsis within 6 hours. We report our experience of Septifast\u00ae system commercially available by Roche on pts undergoing induction therapy and/or SCT for hematological malignancies in our center. In conclusion PCR-based systems like Septifast\u00ae are additional instruments in improving rapid and reliable diagnosis of blood stream infections in this high risk patient population. If this system allows earlier administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy, while also reducing inappropriate overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics is subject of further analysis. A. Khoder, M.

One group (n = 34) received prophylaxis (ganciclovir 300 mg/24 h, 3 days/week/100 days) and the other group (n = 7), pre-emptive therapy guide by positive antigenemia (ganciclovir 5 mg/kg/12h/14 days). All pts underwent CMV viral load quantifi cation by RT-PCR and antigenemia during 6 months: once a week in the fi rst 100 days and every two weeks thereafter. Antigenemia was carried out by inmunofl uorescence in leukocytes with the monoclonal antibody pp65. For RT-PCR the viral DNA was isolated in plasma and was used as a template for amplifi cation. Results: 41 peripheral blood allo-STC, medium age 40 years (15-58), were analyzed. No differences were seen between both groups in terms of risk factors for CMV infection. Total viral replication quantifi ed by antigenemia was 29.2%. Viral replication quantifi ed by RT-PCR was 65.8%. 2 pts developed an end-organ CMV disease. We compared viral load quantifi ed by RT-PCR in pts with a positive antigenemia against those with negative antigenemia, observing differences on weeks 0, 2, 3 and 6 (P < 0.05), and if the criteria was the median RT-PCR in both groups (P = 0.013), before and after day 100 (P = 0.012 and P = 0.008). We compared the viral load quantifi ed by RT-PCR in prophylaxis vs. pre-emptive therapy groups, observing differences in the median of RT-PCR and median RT-PCR before day 100. We also saw differences before day 100 and after day 100 in pts in prophylaxis group (P < 0.02) ( Table 1) . Conclusions: 1) RT-PCR is more sensitive than antigenemia pp-65; 2) CMV positivity and viral load is inferior in the prophylaxis group, but these pts are on viral replication before and after day 100 and received more treatment.",

Espigado Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio (Seville, ES) Introduction: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) end-organ disease is a serious and frequent complication after allo-stem cell transplantation (Allo-SCT). Pre-emptive therapy guided by viral replication is a recent prevention therapy, consisting in treatment if viral replication is detected. The best technique for detection of infection is not defi ned. The PCR real-time seems to be more sensitive but contradictory information exists on its clinical utility. Objectives: To systematically quantify CMV replication by realtime PCR in allo-SCT recipients to determine its effi cacy and safety in CMV disease prevention. Patients, material and methods: Prospective study in consecutive Allo-STC recipients. All patients (pts) underwent CMV viral load quantifi cation by RT-PCR during 6 months: once a week in the fi rst 100 days and every two weeks thereafter. Pts received pre-emptive therapy with ganciclovir (5 mg/kg/12h/14 days, or at least 7 days after a negative quantifi cation) if the viral load increased above 1000 cop/ml in asymptomatic pts or with any positive viral load if clinical suspicion existed. For RT-PCR the viral DNA was isolated in plasma and was used as a template for the amplifi cation and quantifi ed.",

Sakamaki Komagome Hospital (Tokyo, JP) Background: The recent reports have suggested the promising predictive value of procalcitonin (PCT) in the diagnosis of bacterial infections following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). To validate this hypothesis, we undertook a prospective monitoring of PCT during febrile episodes in 67 consecutive allogeneic HSCT recipients in a single institution. Material and methods: We have prospectively monitored serum PCT and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels on the occasion of febrile episode (> 38\u00b0C) within 100 days after transplantation. In all patients, cultures from sterile sites and measurement of white blood cells (WBC) count were done in parallel. Febrile episodes were classifi ed according to the fi nal diagnosis in: fever of unknown origin, microbiologically or clinically documented infection and non-infectious fever.",

The etiology of fever was eventually classifi ed as follows; bacterial sepsis (n = 9), clinically documented bacterial infection (n = 29), non-infectious fever (n = 20), neutropenic fever of unknown origin (n = 3). In view of 38 patients with apparent bacterial infection, only 9 patients (23.7%) showed high level serum PCT (> 0.5 ng/ml). Thus, sensitivity and specifi city of serum PCT elevation in case of bacterial infection following allogeneic HSCT was 15.8% and 89.7%, respectively. Morbidity prevalence rate was 56.7%. Positive and negative predict value was 66.7% and 44.8%, respectively. Likelihood ratio of a positive test was 1.53 (P = 0.39 ). Multivariate analysis disclosed that patients with infection tended to carry higher counts of WBC (P = 0.012) and longer febrile duration (P = 0.009). Overall survival was signifi cantly shorter when serum PCT level was above 2.0 ng/ml (P = 0.007) or CRP above 4.0 mg/dl (P = 0.04). Conclusions: Our results with small cohorts could not support the clinical utility of monitoring serum PCT in bacterial infection. Thus, serum PCT may not be a suitable diagnostic marker especially at early duration after allogeneic HSCT. A. Papalexandri, T. Touloumenidou, I. Zorbas, M. Gounari, P. Zerva, C. Apostolou, S.

Anagnostopoulos G.Papanikolaou Hospital (Thessaloniki, GR) The precise role of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) in the establishment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in biological specimens other than plasma has not been defi ned conclusively. Several technical aspects remain unresolved, in particular the use of cut-offs for positivity. We retrospectively evaluated the clinical signifi cance of posi-S232 tive RQ-PCR tests for CMV DNA in biological fl uids other than plasma from 73 patients after allo-HCT, with a special emphasis on samples with a low viral load (< 500 copies/ml). The viral load in plasma and urine was monitored once weekly by RQ-PCR, while other bodily fl uid samples were tested only in symptomatic patients. We evaluated 92 CMV positive samples documented in urine (n = 67), gastric fl uid (GF) (n = 13) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), (n = 12). RQ-PCR examination of paired plasma samples revealed concordant CMV viremia in only 23/92 cases (25% in urine, 31% in GF, 17% in BAL). Overall, forty-six of 92 (50%) samples were obtained from cases with clinically symptomatic disease: (i) cystitis, n = 23/67 (34%) cases; (ii) gastritis, n = 13/13 (100%) cases; (iii) pneumonia, n = 10/12 (83%) cases, of which, however, only two were attributed solely to CMV. Viral load was a signifi cant risk factor for CMV disease (P = 0,018). To further refi ne the interpretation of RQ-PCR results and ensure linearity, a cut-off of 500 CMV copies/ml was applied. With this cut-off, samples were assigned to a low-or high-positive group (A or B, respectively )}(P = 0,013). We conclude that the molecular determination of CMV viral load in biological fl uids other than blood by RQ-PCR offers diagnostic information of clinical relevance for the detection and prevention of CMV cystitis and, also, CMV gastritis after allo-HCT.",

Raj Guy's Hospital (London, UK) Background: The data for posaconazole (POS) as primary prophylaxis for invasive fungal infection (IFI) is limited. There are two published studies; Ullmann et al. reported that POS was as effective as fl uconazole in preventing IFI in patients with graft versus host disease (GVHD) following allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT). In neutropenic patients following chemotherapy for AML/MDS, Cornely et al. found POS to be superior to fl uconazole/itraconazole in preventing IFI. Based on these large, randomised studies, POS has been adopted by our centre as primary antifungal prophylaxis. We describe our experience with POS which is predominantly in haematopoietic SCT (HSCT) recipients. Methods: Retrospective analysis of adult patients who received POS prophylaxis between January 2007 and December 2009. Evidence of breakthrough IFI was recorded as per EORTC/ MSG defi nitions. Liver function tests (LFTs) prior to initiating, during and after treatment with POS were reviewed. Events that could contribute to LFT derangement were identifi ed from the medical notes. Results: 59 patients received POS prophylaxis (n = 52 primary, n = 7 secondary). Of these, 52 were undergoing HSCT (n = 32 reduced intensity conditioning allograft, n = 10 full intensity allograft, n = 4 autograft including total-body-irradiation or T-cell depletion, n = 2 umbilical cord transplant, n = 4 haploidentical transplant) and 7 were undergoing intensive chemotherapy for the treatment of leukaemia. 6 patients developed an IFI, classifi ed as per EORTC/MSG defi nitions proven (n = 1), probable (n = 2), possible (n = 3).

Conclusions: Primary prophylaxis was effective with 10% breakthrough. This occurred particularly in patients with gut GVHD. Therefore we suggest that an alternative be used.

Posttransplant immune suppression, viral infections and acute graft-versus-host disease, are known risk factors for fungal infections. Thus, antifungal prophylaxis early after transplantation is indicated. Data for antimykotic prophylaxis in stem cell transplanted pediatric patients is scarce. Posaconazole is an extended spectrum oral azole which is widely used in adults. It is not metabolized to a signifi cant extent through the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, an increase of the level of immunosuppressive drugs cannot be proven.

To confi rm this hypothesis, we retrospectively reviewed 23 patients with a history of IFI who had undergone allo-HSCT from 1993 to 2008 in the centers of Nagoya Blood and Marrow Transplantation Group. Patients' median age was 45 years (18-63 years). Twenty-two patients had hematological malignancies. Used graft sources were peripheral blood stem cells (n = 8), bone marrow (n = 13) and cord blood (n = 2). Sixteen patients received fl udarabinebased reduced-intensity conditioning. Three patients were diagnosed as proven, 8 as probable and 12 as possible IFI before allo-HSCT. Invaded organs were liver (n = 10) and lung (n = 11). The median onset days of the fungal diseases were 58 days (7-280 days) before allo-HSCT. Four patients received allo-HSCT with fl uconazole or amphotericin B syrup, 5 patients with intravenous amphotericin-B, and 14 patients received one of following new antifungal agents: voriconazole, micafungin and liposomal amphotericin B. On the day of allo-HSCT, IFI was controlled (defi ned as afebrile and negative of C-reactive protein ) in 16 patients, and uncontrolled in 7 patients. After a median follow-up of 238 days (4-738 days) from the day of allo-HSCT, 9 out of 23 patients were alive with an overall survival (OS) rate of 54% at 1 year after transplantation. Relapse rate at 1 year was 21% and non-relapse mortality rate at 1 year was 26%. Two deaths were related to fungal infection prior to allo-HSCT; one patient with lung Aspergillosis died of pulmonary bleeding and the other with Candida abscess in liver died of hepatic sinusoidal obstruction. Both of them died within 30 days after allo-HSCT.

De Boeck, A. Uyttebroeck, M. Renard University Hospital Leuven (Leuven, BE) Introduction: The routine use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a matter of debate, especially in pediatric HSCT, where data are scarce. Until recently, all pediatric patients undergoing allogenic HSCT in our center, received IVIG (400 mg/kg/w from engraftment until d + 180; 400 mg/kg/month from d + 180 until d + 365). Adjustments were performed to obtain IgG through levels above 6 g/L. Aim: To evaluate the potential benefi t of IVIG in pediatric allogeneic HSCT in terms of transplant-related mortality (TRM), incidence of bacteremia, invasive fungal infection (IFI) and CMV infection during the fi rst year post-HSCT. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study including all allogeneic pediatric HSCTs between January 2001 and December 2007 and compared the results with historic data using PubMed search strategies. For bacteremias and IFI, the incidence of infectious episodes (infection rate (IR)) was calculated as the number of events divided by the patient days at risk and expressed as episodes/100 patient days at risk. Patient days at risk were defi ned as the days between the day of transplant and day 365 or the date of death, relapse or graft failure. 95% confi dence intervals (95% CI) were calculated by using the Poisson distribution function. Overall survival and cumulative incidence of TRM and relapse were described according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Comparison of the survival curves was made using the Logrank test (MedCalc and JavaStat software). Infection rate (IR) was specifi ed for the pre-engraftment period (days 0-30), the mid-recovery phase (days 31-100) and the late recovery phase (days 101-365). Veno-occlusive disease (VOD)-related mortality was also analysed. Results: 51 HSCTs were performed in 48 patients. Previously published studies were reviewed and data were compared.",

We present data on infections seen in our unrelated cord transplant recipients over a 30 month period from April 2007 to October 2009. A total of 10 transplants have been performed at our unit using NMDP cords. The units were a 5/6 match in 7 cases and 4/6 in 3 cases. All units had a total nucleated cell count of over 3 \u00d7 10 7 /kg and were thawed at the bedside just prior to infusion. The underlying diagnoses were Fanconi anaemia, relapsed leukaemia and Hurler syndrome. All patients had antithymocyte globulin as part of conditioning. Klebsiella was the most common gram negative bacteria isolated in the fi rst 48 hours after infusion. This responded to administration of broad spectrum antibiotics. 2 children had Burkholderia cepacia and 2 had Acinetobacter boumanii following prolonged use of broad spectrum antibiotics. One child had vancomycin resistant enterococcus -VRE, which is a rare isolate at our institution. One child had multiple bacterial infections due to a blind loop in the intestine following graft versus host disease of the gut. This included several cultures of Klebsiella, E. coli and a terminal event due to pan resistant Pseudomonas. One child with Hurler syndrome had a mild respiratory illness 5 months post transplantation and succumbed rapidly in 48 hours before any diagnosis could be established. CMV reactivation occurred only in children who needed additional immunosuppression for graft versus host disease and usually settled with pre-emptive therapy. High viral loads of 28,000 copies were only seen in the unrelated transplant setting but responded to ganciclovir.",

Schmitt University of Rostock (Rostock, DE) Background: Reactivation of resolved hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a well known complication in allogeneic haematopoetic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) recipients, which is usually treated with lamivudine. In light of the possibility that the prolonged use of lamivudine may foster the emergence of mutant lamivudine-resistant HBV strains, we decided to use the newer anti-HBV agent tenofovir in two patients (pts) with chronic Graft versus host disease (cGVHD) and hepatitis B virus reactivation. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Viread) is a nucleotide analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor with a potent antiviral activity, a favorable safety profi le and a higher barrier to the development of resistance. To our knowledge it is the fi rst report on the use of tenofovir in this clinical setting. Case report: Both female pts had a resolved HBV infection (hepatitis B core antibody-positive, hepatitis B surface antigen-negative, hepatitis b surface antibody-positive) before they received alloHSCT in 2005 for acute/chronic myeloid leukemia. Chronic GVHD occurred 4 and 8 months after HSCT, respectively. First pt: at time of diagnoses of HBV-reactivation the pt received immunosuppressive therapy with everolimus and prednisolon (10 mg) due to severe sclerodermoid cGVHD. The liver enzymes were slightly elevated at time of clinical fl are of hepatitis reactivation in this pt. Second pt: the immunosuppression for severe cGVHD of the lung consisted of rapamycin, mycophenolate sodium and prednisolon (30mg). At time of diagnosis she complained only about fatique and had no signs of liver dysfunction. Both pts received an oral administration of 245 mg Viread daily and responded with reduction of HBV-DNA replication. The viral load dropped from 4.5 \u00d7 10(9) to 1.4 \u00d7 10(4) copies/ml in pt 1 and from 5.2 \u00d7 10(8) to 3.2 \u00d7 10(3) copies/ml in pt 2 within seven months. The antiviral therapy was well tolerated without any side effects.",

Walewski MSC Memorial Cancer Center (Warsaw, PL) Between January 2005 and December 2008, 202 patients (non-Hodgkin lymphoma -169, multiple myeloma -33) underwent high dose chemotherapy (HDT, BEAM -139, CBV -9, Mel200 -33, others -21) followed by autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (auto-HCT) at our institution. We performed retrospective analysis of infectious complications after auto-HCT. All patients (pts) were isolated in HEPA-fi ltered single room, received oral antibacterial and antifungal (including anti-PJP) prophylaxis, and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) support after auto-HCT. All apheresis products were monitored for bacteriologic sterility. Median duration of neutropenia was 9 days. The overall incidence of fever requiring antimicrobial treatment was 75,5%. The origin of fever was unknown in two third of cases. Primary bacteremia occurred in 25,7%, pneumonia -in 2,5%, skin infections -in 1,5%, conjunctivitis -in 1% of pts. The catheter-related infection was observed in 3% of pts. In 22% (45 pts) cases bacterial contamination for apheresis products was found. Sepsis was developed in 12 of these pts. Four pts had invasive fungal infections, and one patient required anti-CMV treatment. Septic shock occurred in 3% of pts (6 pts) but there were no fatalities. Serum procalcitonin were measured in 20 patients with fever, two of them had increased procalcitonin level. Infectious mucositis was developed in 67% of pts. Median time to incidence of fever after auto-HCT was 4 days (range 0 to 15 days). The most frequently isolated pathogens were coagulase-negative Staphylococci (62%). Initial, usually empiric, antibiotic therapy consisted of broad-spectrum beta-lactam agents combined with amikacin. This therapy was successful in 39% of patients who had fever of unknown origin and in 48% of patients with documented infections. Median duration of antimicrobial treatment was 9 days. In conclusion, infections were not causing mortality or clinically signifi cant morbidity in patients after HDT followed by auto-HCT under prophylactic measures as used in these patients. The most frequent type of infection was neutropenic fever of unknown origin. More than half of infection episodes were caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococci. Empiric broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics combined with amikacin were not suffi ciently effi cacious in eradicating all pathogens and ultimate therapy guided by microbiology sensitivity testing was successfull.",

This single centre study assessed incidence and predictive factors of EBV reactivation and LPD in 33 consecutive patients undergoing reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT). The median age was 50 (range, 18-66) years. 58% (n = 19) of the patients had a myeloid malignancy, 36% (n = 12) had a lymphoid malignancy and 6% (n = 2) had sAA. 91% (n = 30) of the patients received 2 CB units and 9% (n = 3) received a single CB. The patients received a median of 4.0 \u00d7 10 7 /Kg (range, 2.2-5.8 ) total nucleated cells and a median of 0.9 \u00d7 10 5 /Kg (range, 0.2-3.7) CD34 + cells. Donors and recipients were mismatched with one mismatch in 43% of cases and 2 mismatches in 57%. A RIC including fl udarabine (200 mg/m\u00b2 total dose), cyclophosphamide (50 mg/Kg) and low dose TBI (2 Gy.) was used in 29 cases (88%), while 8 patients (24%) who were not heavily pretreated before UCBT received ATG. In the fi rst 6 months, patients were screened weekly for EBV reactivation by DNA-PCR. EBV reactivation was defi ned as viremia of 1000 EBV-DNA copies/105 cells. Patients with EBV reactivation were pre-emptively treated with rituximab. The median follow-up for surviving patients was 468 (range, 92-1277) days. Engraftment occurred at a median of 12 (range, 8-60) days and 15% of patients developed grade 2-4 acute GVHD. EBV reactivation was observed in 5 patients (15%) at a median of 132 (range, 85-438) days after UCBT. Among the 5 patients experiencing EBV reactivation, 2 patients received ATG as part of their RIC. Four patients were treated with a median of 3 (range, 1-8) rituximab infusions. Two patients responded to Rituximab, but 2 patients developed LPD. One of these 2 patients died before receiving any other anti-EBV therapy. In the other patient, LPD could be controlled after additional chemotherapy and 2 infusions of EBV specifi c CTLs. Of note, there was no signifi cant difference in overall survival between patients with or without EBV reactivation (P = 0.33).",

The purpose of the present analysis was to provide evidence if the poor prognosis of early relapse after autoSCT can be overcome by salvage alloSCT. Patients and methods: Patients who had received an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) for relapse after a previous autoSCT for CLL were identifi ed from the EBMT database. Survival time data were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method for OS and RFS while cumulative incidence estimates were calculated in a competing risk framework for REL2 and NRM. Multivariate estimates of hazard ratio's were computed using standard COX modelling. Results: 111 patients were identifi ed fulfi lling the inclusion criteria. The median age was 54 (33-66) years, 91 patients (82%) were males, remission status at alloSCT was CR/PR in 48/103 patients (47%) and less than PR in the remainder. Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) was used in 96/108 patients (87%), and the graft was obtained from a matched sibling donor in 40/108 cases (36%). The median interval from autoSCT to REL1 was 2.8 (0.2-8.9 ) years. NRM, REL2, RFS, and OS 3 years after alloSCT of all 111 patients was 26%, 41%, 33%, and 44%, respectively. Patients were classifi ed according to interval from autoSCT to REL1 (TIME) into 3 equally sized categories (TIME0 < 2 years, TIME1 2-3.7 years, Time2 > 3.7 years) with 37 patients each. Patients from category TIME0 had higher 3y-NRM compared to TIME1 and TIME2 (38% vs. 23% vs. 15%, P = 0.058). However, REL2, RFS and OS were not statistically different over all 3 TIME categories (TIME0, TIME1, TIME2; 3y-REL2 30%, 49%, 44%, trendtest: P = 0.6; 3y-RFS 32%, 29%, 41%, trendtest: P = 0.36; 3y-OS 41%, 45%, 48%, trendtest P = 0.20). Even after multivariate adjustment for age, sex, donor, conditioning and remission status at alloSCT, a signifi cant impact of TIME on RFS and OS did not emerge. However, the systematic decrease of NRM was perfectly counterbalanced by a systematic increase of death-after-relapse. Conclusions: Although limited by small patient numbers, this analysis does not support the hypothesis that a short remission duration (< 2 years) after autoSCT adversely impacts on survival after a subsequent salvage alloSCT in CLL, suggesting that the prognostic disadvantage of a short time to relapse after autoSCT might be overcome by alloSCT (fi rst EBMT CLL transplant consensus criterion).",

In multivariate analysis the EBMT scores lacked association with TRM, but scores > 3 predicted for inferior OS. Patients with no comorbidities (HCT-CI score 0) had better TRM as well as OS when compared with patients with comorbidities (HCT-CI score > 0) in multivariate analysis (relative risk (RR) for TRM 4.29, 95% CI: 1.8-10.5 , P = 0.001; RR for OS 1.58, 95% CI: 1.04-2.4 , P = 0.03). There was no difference in survival or TRM between patients with HCT-CI score 1-2 and those with HCT-CI score > 2. Pre-conditioning CRP levels > 9 ml/L predicted for both inferior TRM (RR 4.22, 95% CI: 1.6-11.2, P = 0.004) and OS (RR 2.33, 95% CI: 1.4-4.0 , P = 0.002). The prognostic value of high CRP levels was independent of the HCT-CI and its individual components and vice versa. Specifi cally, there was no association between elevated CRP levels and infection, either as a comorbidity or as a cause of death. Figures show probabilities of TRM (A,B) and overall survival (C,D) for patients stratifi ed by HCT-CI (0 versus > 0; A,C) and pre-conditioning CRP levels (0-9 mg/L versus > 9 mg/L; B,D). These data are important for deciding how to treat patients with CML in fi rst chronic phase who have a suitably matched donor and fail imatinib. Previous cytogenetic response to imatinib, Sokal score and recurrent neutropenia on imatinib are factors which can accurately predict response to second generation TKIs. Therefore, patients with a predicted poor response to these agents, having a low level of CRP, no comorbidities and low EBMT scores may be expected to benefi t from HCT as second line therapy.",

Therefore, we decided to retrospectively analyze a group of 836 CML patients who relapsed following RIC (N = 109) or standard conditioning (N = 727) SCT and were treated with DLI. The median age of patients was 39 years (range 18-66), at transplantation 84% were in chronic phase, 11% in accelerated phase and 5% in blast crisis. They received cells from HLA-matched related (64%), matched unrelated (30%) or mismatched (6%) donor. SCTs have been performed between 1994 and 2007. Acute GvHD grade II-IV occurred in 20% and chronic GvHD in 45% of patients. 88% of patients with known data achieved complete remission after alloSCT, but all of them relapsed after median of 11.5 months (range 0-132). They were treated with DLI given after a median time of 2.2 months (range 0-84) following SCT. The comparative analysis of groups based on conditioning regimen revealed that the RIC group contained signifi cantly more females (49 vs. 39%), older patients (> 50) (49 vs. 10%) and received less frequently T cell depletion (47 vs. 56%). They were transplanted more frequently with PBSC (74 vs. 29%) and received cells from HLA-identical sibling donors (74 vs. 58%). RIC SCT group was characterized by signifi cantly more patients in advanced phase at SCT (22 vs. 15%), have been performed more recently (mean year 2001 vs. 1999 ), were associated with lower occurrence of grade II-IV aGvHD (12 vs. 22%) and shorter time from transplantation to relapse (mean 9 vs. 19 months). Signifi cantly lower rate of complete remissions after SCT was observed in RIC group (71 vs. 91% of patients with known data). The actuarial probability of survival at fi ve years from DLI was 64% in RIC and 69% in standard SCT group and survival analysis did not show signifi cant differences (P = 0.215). The groups did not differ in frequency of grade II-IV aGvHD after DLI (18% for RIC vs. 11% for standard, P = 0.266 chi-sq test) while there was a trend towards extensive chronic GvHD in RIC group (60 vs. 38,%, P = 0.059 chi-sq test). The data show that CML relapse after RIC SCT can be as efficiently treated with DLIs as in case of relapse after standard conditioning SCT.",

Scholten, A. van Biezen, A. Nagler, J. Apperley, M. Michallet, A. Grigg, R. Silver, D. Niederwieser, T. De Witte, E. Olavarria on behalf of the CML subcommittee of the CLWP of the EBMT Stem cell transplantation (SCT) will continue to be a treatment option for patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia, despite the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). However, many patients will have received prior therapy with TKIs, including Nilotinib or Dasatinib at the time of allogeneic SCT. While the use of Imatinib prior to SCT seems to have no adverse impact on the outcome of allogeneic SCT little is known on the impact of prior use of second generation TKIs. Therefore we conducted a retrospective registry study and identifi ed 56 patients with CML who received an allotransplant after having been treated with Nilotinib and/or Dasatinib. Best responses to second generation TKIs were major molecular response in 11%, complete cytogenetic response in 7%, partial cytogenetic response in 18%, complete haematologic remission in 25% and no response in 34%, respectively. At SCT, 37% of the patients were in accelerated or in blast phase, 36% in CP2 or higher and 27% in fi rst chronic phase. Graft failure occurred in two patients. The median follow-up for surviving patients is 19 months. At 24 months the estimated non-relapse mortality was 33% and the relapse incidence 15%. As expected, probability of survival is best in patients transplanted in CP1 with more than 85% at 2 years. In univariate analysis there was a non signifi cant trend in favor for pretreatment with Nilotinib as compared to the other groups. However, in multivariate analysis only stage of the disease was a predictor for survival. With respect to overall survival no signifi cant differences could be identifi ed for the following variables: patient age, donor type, stem cell source, intensity of the conditioning, time diagnosis to transplant, in or ex vivo T-cell depletion, response to treatment with second generation TKIs. Patients transplanted in blast crisis had a signifi cant higher risk of non relapse mortality. In summary, despite the shortcomings of a retrospective study the numbers reported are comparable to earlier studies on the impact of Imatinib on the outcome of SCT and it should be emphasised that the timing of allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains crucial to avoid unacceptable high treatment related mortality.",

This multicenter retrospective analysis assessed the long term outcome of 153 CLL patients who received allo-SCT between 1987 and 2005, and were reported to the SFGM-TC registry.

Patients received either a standard myeloablative conditioning regimen (39%; Cy-TBI in 90% of cases) or a so-called reduced-intensity conditioning (61%). A matched-related donor was used in 90% of cases and PBSCs were used as source of stem cells in 56%. At time of allo-SCT, only 18% of patients were in CR, 24% in fi rst PR and the rest of the series in more advanced phases, including 30% of patients in progressive disease. With a median follow-up of 60 (range, 1.6-208) months, 96% of patients engrafted (ANC > 500/\u03bcL) at a median of 18 (range, 1-41) days after allo-SCT. 71 47% of patients experienced grade 2-4 acute GVHD, including 18% of grade 3-4 acute GVHD. 33% of evaluable patients experienced extensive chronic GVHD. At time of last follow-up, the median probability of OS from diagnosis was 124 (range, 109-139) months, and the median probability of OS after allo-SCT was 40 (range, 14-67) months.

Best strategies to administer DLI are not known. We analyzed 155 pts relapsing after allogeneic HSCT for CML with disease detectable only by molecular methods who received DLI. Transplants had been done in fi rst chronic phase (n = 125) or for more advanced disease (n = 29) from identical siblings (n = 84) and unrelated donors (n = 71) between 1986 and 2003. They received DLI either early with molecular (n = 85) disease or upon progression to, cytogenetic (n = 37) hematologic in chronic phase (n = 25) or more advanced phase (n = 8) disease. The median time interval from transplant to molecular relapse was 239 (30-4274) days. The initial DLI dose was \u2264 106 CD3/kg in 44, > 106-107/kg in 58, and > 107 in 25. The number of DLI doses given was 1 in 83, 2 in 25 and \u2265 3 in 47 pts. Concurrent imatinib was given in 11 pts. The median interval from relapse to DLI was 210 (1-1673) days. 43 pts developed acute GvHD after DLI and 34 had chronic GvHD. 28 pts did not respond to DLI, response was unknown or unevaluable in 21 and cytogenetic or better responses were seen in 103 pts. Time interval from DLI to best response was 245 (30-1673) days. 9 pts died of DLI related complications. At last follow-up 31 pts had died, of the surviving pts (124) 93 had achieved response (missing information in 15 and no response in 16). Of those who responded, 86 had complete molecular response and 3 of the responders had a subsequent relapse. Median follow-up after DLI was 46 (3-135) mths.

We retrospectively analyzed the transplantation outcome in patients (pts) with CMML from the EBMT database and investigated the infl uence of WHO classification, conditioning regimen, and other factors on the outcome. In this analysis 283 adult pts (F = 92, M = 191 , median age 50 years) were included. Among 105 pts with known WHO classification, 45 had CMML-D and 60 CMML-P. The conditioning was conventional in 152 (54%) and reduced-intensity in 87 (31%). Donor was HLA-identical sibling (160), matched unrelated (85) or other (38). Disease status at SCT was CR in 50 (18%), no CR in 185 (65%) and unknown in 44 (16%). Stem cell source was bone marrow in 108 (38%) and PBSC in 175 pts (62%).

Among 156 deaths, 50 were disease-related (32%), 95 transplant-related (61%) and 11 other cause-related (7%). Non-relapse mortality was 37% and was lower in PBSC recipients (P = 0.023) and in pts transplanted after 2002 (P = 0.015). Totally, GVHD was the cause of death in 11% of the pts.

Using a highly sensitive quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method we tested 90 patients with myelofi brosis who underwent ASCT for the presence of MPL W515L/K mutations. Two patients with primary myelofi brosis were found to harbor MPLW515L while no patient was positive for MPLW515K mutation. Both patients were JAK2V617F negative and cleared the mutation rapidly after ASCT and remained negative for a median follow up of 19 months. The results of molecular monitoring correlated well with other remission parameters such as normalization of peripheral blood counts and morphology and complete donor chimerism. We conclude that MPLW515L can be cleared after ASCT and hence may be used a minimal residual disease marker in a proportion of JAK2V617F-negative myelofi brosis patients.",

According to the International Prognosis Scoring System for WM, high-risk patients present an OS at 5 years of only 36%. These results could justify innovative approaches and more aggressive treatment modalities such as autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). We examined the long-term outcome of ASCT performed in WM from 1991 to 2007 by studying the records of 46 patients reported in the SFGM-TC database and in Hamburg registry (12 patients). For diagnostic confi rmation were applied the second international WM workshop criteria. All confi rmed cases were then extensively analyzed directly with the collaboration of the physicians. Response was defi ned with Kimby et al. ' s criteria with few modifi cations: Patients with disappearance of the monoclonal protein, confi rmed by immunofi xation, and the complete regression of any adenopathy/organomegaly or signs of WM, even if bone marrow evaluation was not available were considered to have a complete remission (CR). Those with persistent detectable monoclonal IgM < 5 g/L or with missing immunofi xation data, but who met all the other CR criteria, were considered to have a very good partial response (VGPR). Median age at transplant was 54 years (34-68) with 37% of patients who received 3 or more previous lines, including purine analogs in 30% and Rituximab in 20%. At transplant 20% of patients had refractory disease. Sixty three percent of patients received a conditioning regimen including TBI. ASCT yielded an overall response rate of 85% with 9% of CR and 30% of VGPR. The median progression free survival (PFS) and OS were 53 and 109 months respectively. With a median follow-up of 110 months , 5-year OS and PFS rates were respectively, 66% (95% CI: 52-80) and 44% (95% CI: 29-59), reaching 88.5% (95% CI: 79-98) and 65% (CI: 51-79) in patients in CR or VGPR .In multivariate analysis the variables associated with better survival and PFS were the number of previous lines of treatment (P = 0.02 and P = 0.032 respectively) and achievement of CR and VGPR. (P = 0.019 and 0.004 respectively). Two patients presented at 3 and 42 months post transplantation a therapy related acute myeloid leukemia. ASCT therefore leads to long PFS in this high risk population and should be evaluated earlier in patients with poor prognostic factors.",

Two unrelated recipient/donor pairs had a single HLA-C allele and one DQB1-Ag mismatch. Percentages of donor chimerism were assessed by FISH for X and Y chromosomes and/or by polymerase chain reaction-based amplifi cation of variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) sequences after sorting. Results: Hematological toxicities after SCT were moderate.

Patients who were in CR/PR at SCT had a faster B-cell donor chimerism than those in stable disease/progress [94% (range: 6-100%) versus 9% (range: 9-100%) one year post-SCT respectively]. Overall survival (OS) of the whole group was 67% at 8 years, with 5 of 9 related recipients and 18 of the 23 unrelated recipients being alive. The 8years event-free survival, the incidence of Non relapse Related Mortality (NRM) and the progression/relapse were 41%, 25% and 45%, respectively. The factors signifi cantly associated with increased risk of relapse/progress were intermediate/advanced disease vs. CR/PR1 (P = 0.006). The most common causes of NRM were GvHD (n = 5; 16%) followed by sepsis (n = 3, 9%). Conclusion: Results confi rm high OS after low-dose TBI based regimens even in advanced CLL.

Patients: In this study we analyze 48 CML patients, with a median age of 33 years (range 21-60), who relapsed after transplant, at a median interval of 650 days (range 60-5830), and received Imatinib, at a median interval of 127 days (range 10-1478) from relapse. Results. Group A comprised 4 patients who recovered autologous hematopoiesis after transplant, treatment with Imatinib was ineffective. Group B comprised 10 patients refractory to Imatinib: 8 had hematologic relapse (2 BC, 2 AP, 1 CP) and 2 had a citogenetic relapse after full donor engraftment. Group C comprised 31 Imatinib responders: 4 had hematologic relapse (4 CP), 12 citogenetic relapse and 15 had molecular relapse. Group D: comprised 4 responders to a combination of Imatinib and DLI (2 hematological relapse, 2.molecular relapse). Responders: We had a total of 35 complete cytogenetic responses, of these, 31 patients (78%) had a complete molecular response (CMolR). Of the 31 CMolR, 17 (55%) discontinued Imatinib, after a median of 500 days (range 90-1272) and have been bcr/abl negative ever since, with median follow up 1825 days (range 730-2190) from discontinuation. Ten patients of 31 (32%) discontinued Imatinib for a median of 120 days, and became positive again: all have been restarted on Imatinib and 9 continue to be on therapy with MMolR.

Kr\u00f6ger University Cancer Center (Hamburg, DE) Introduction: Up to 30% of patients (pts) with myelofi brosis (MF) will relapse within the fi rst three years after allo-SCT. Therapeutic options for those include donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) and/or a 2nd allo-SCT, but studies on this issue are rare. Patients and methods: We report our experience with DLIs and 2nd allo-SCT being performed as salvage approach in 10 pts (5 males, 5 females) with relapsed MF (32-63 yrs). Initial transplantations were performed in all pts with reduced conditioning (RIC) (busulfan, cum. 10 mg/kg p.o. or equivalent i.v.; + fl udarabine, cum. 180 mg/m\u00b2). Maximal response after initial allo-SCT was complete (CR, n = 3) or partial remission (PR, n = 6), and stable disease (SD, n = 1). Results: Clinical relapse occurred at a median of 5 months (2-50) following initial allo-SCT. Subsequently, all pts received DLIs at 1-4 time points (median, 2.5 \u00d7 10 7 /kg bw; range, 0.5 \u00d7 10 5 -1.3 \u00d7 10 8 /kg). Thereafter, 2 pts (20%) developed grade III acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) and required adequate immunosuppression. The best responses after DLIs according to IWG-MRT criteria included: CR (n = 3), SD (n = 5), and clinical improvement (CI, n = 1). One pt showed progressive disease (PD). All pts with CR maintain CR 7 + , 18 + and 19 + months. 2nd allo-SCT was performed in 7 pts without CR following DLIs. The median interval between both SCTs was 17 months (13-77). RIC regimen being used in this setting consisted of fl udarabine (cum. 150 mg/m\u00b2) with treosulfan (cum. 36 mg/m\u00b2). All pts received PBSC (median, 7 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg bw; 4-11) from alternative HLA-matched (n = 3) or -mismatched (n = 4) unrelated donors. All pts successfully achieved leukocyte engraftment (median, day + 18; 10-20). Severe aGvHD (II-III) was observed in 2 of 7 (29%) pts. There were no TRM cases. Of all 10 pts, 8 were alive at the median follow up of 34 months (range, 16-78) from initial SCT. Of those, according to IWG-MRT criteria, 6 achieved CR, together with JAK2V617F-negativity (3 pts after DLIs and 3 pts after 2nd allo-SCT, including the pt with PD after the 1st allo-SCT). 2 patients attained PR following the 2nd SCT. Two of 10 pts who were in CR 15 and 11 months after the 2st allo-SCT, respectively, died due to PD 18 and 21 months after the 2nd SCT. Conclusions: DLIs and 2nd allo-SCT, based on a combination of fl udarabine and treosulfan, seem to represent effective and well tolerated salvage approaches for patients with myelofi brosis, who relapsed after initial allo-SCT.

Rezvani Imperial College London (London, UK) Imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib are remarkably effective as single-agent treatments for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP). They are also increasingly being used as therapies in the allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) setting, both as post allo-SCT maintenance treatment for Ph + leukemias as well as for their putative immunomodulatory effects. However little is known on their potential impact on the immune system and to date no human in vivo data are available.",

We analyzed the immunological T-cell response to infl uenza virus both quantitatively and qualitatively using fl ow cytometry for intracellular TNF-a, IFN-and IL2 and the cytotoxicity marker CD107a. Preliminary results on 28 patients and 11 healthy controls have been analyzed thus far. Signifi cantly fewer patients on TKIs mounted an anti-pneumococcal IgM response (IgM serum titer > 100 U/ml) compared to healthy controls (9/28 versus 8/11, P = 0.033 These preliminary results suggest that in patients with CML on TKIs the IgM B cell response to vaccination with Pneumovax is signifi cantly impaired compared to healthy controls.

We report the results of a retrospective multicenter study on 25 pts with CLL > 45 years (yrs) who underwent an allo-HSCT from an HLA identical sibling (22 pts) or an unrelated donor (3 pts) between 2001 and 2009; median age was 57 yrs (range 45-70) and the median number of pre-transplant chemotherapy lines was 3 (range 1-6); 6 pts (24%) had received a previous auto-HSCT. All pts showed biological high-risk features. At transplant, 2 pts were in CR, 15 were in partial remission and 8 had stable or progressive disease. Ten pts received a RIC allo-HSCT following fl udarabine/cyclophosphamide/ thyotepa, while 15 pts were conditioned with a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen (NMA) with TBI (200) plus fl udarabine. The cumulative incidence (CI) of acute and chronic GVHD was 40% and 60%, respectively. Transplant-related mortality (TRM) by CI was 13%. At 5 yrs, the CI of relapse/progression was 47%. The 5-year actuarial probability of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) was 55% and 43%, respectively; the most important factor infl uencing both OS and DFS was the hematopoietic cell transplantation-specifi c comorbidity index (P < 0.0001). With a median follow-up of 40 months , 14 patients (56%) showed a molecular eradication of their disease. By logistical regression model analysis, the only factor affecting the disappearance of minimal residual disease (MRD) was the presence of chronic GVHD (P = 0.04); neither the type of conditioning regimen, nor the pre-transplant chemotherapy, nor the occurrence of acute GVHD had a signifi cant impact; the disease phase pre-transplant showed a trend in affecting MRD (P = 0.08). In conclusion, over a prolonged follow-up period, we confi rm that allo-HSCT is feasible in CLL patients (including the elderly) and that it is associated with a relatively low TRM, regardless of age. The use of NMA conditioning regimens is a good alternative option to RIC to obtain the eradication of MRD infl uenced only by the graft-versus leukemia effect in this high-risk population of patients.",

Toxicity before 100 days included grade 3/4 GvH (n = 11) including a death post-Flu/TBI SCT, and 6 patients had NCI grade 3/4 infections. Toxicity after 100 days included extensive cGvH in 15 patients including 2 patients post DLI and 1 death, NCI grade 3/4 infections in 6 patients including 2 deaths, and 5 deaths from relapse. Seven patients had DLI, 5 for mixed chimerism and 2 for relapse. The 2 year overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) was 72% and 68%.

Jahani Hematology-Oncology & Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center (Tehran, IR) Introduction: Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT) with High-dose chemotherapy is the responsible therapy for most patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) that is not controlled by conventional chemotherapy. SCT can develop the long-term Disease Free Survival (DPFS) of patients. Patients and methods: 148 Hodgkin lymphoma Patients, (85 male and 63 female) with a median age of 24.5 years (Range: 12-58 years), have received SCT from January 2003 through December 2009 in this centre. Second complete remission was the most common status of patients before transplantation. The conditioning regimen was cytarabine, etoposide, lomustine and melphalan, followed by infusion of autologous SCT and analyzed the results. Results: The median time to Absolute Neutrophil Count \u2265 0.5 * 10 9 /L was + 14 and the median time to platelet count \u2265 20 * 10 9 /L was + 23. The median follow up time was 13 month. At present, 140 (94.6%) out of 148 are still living. Transplant Related Mortality was 2%. The most common cause of death was relapse (6 patients). Two years disease-free survival was 82% and two years overall survival was 91.4%. Conclusion: Regarding to our experience and other experiences autologous SCT is the treatment of choice for second remission and good partial remission.",

Sureda (2) We have recently reported encouraging results after unrelated cord blood transplantation (UCBT) for patients with lymphoid malignancies. Progression free survival (PFS) was improved in patients with chemosensitive disease, who have received higher cell doses, and low-dose TBI in the preparative regimen. However, whether outcomes after UCBT are comparable to matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplants for lymphoma and CLL remains to be defi ned. We studied 359 adult patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL, n = 168), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL, n = 108) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL, n = 83) who received an UCBT (n = 75) or a MUD transplant (n = 284) after a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen between January 2000 and December 2006. In the MUD group, only patients receiving peripheral blood stem cells and with a 6/6 HLA match (almost 50% of cases having a 8/8 match) were included. In the UCBT group, 31 patients (41%) received a double UCBT and at least one cord blood unit had 2 mismatches with the patient in 75% of cases. In the UCBT group, patients were slightly younger, and aggressive lymphomas, HL and chemoresistant diseases were more frequent. Median follow-up time of surviving patients was 28 months. The cumulative incidence (CI) of engraftment at day 60 was 85% in the UCBT group and 98% in the MUD group (P < 0.001). At 100 days, CI of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was not statistically different between UCBT and MUD recipients (32% vs. 31%, P = not signifi cant -NS). At 2 years, CI of chronic GVHD was higher after MUD as compared to UCBT (48% vs. 37%, respectively, P = 0.05). Non-adjusted 2 years CI of NRM was 28% after UCBT and 31% after MUD, (P = NS). There was also no difference in 2-year CI of relapse or progression after UCBT or MUD (38% vs. 35%, P = NS). Two-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 38% after UCBT and 41% after MUD (P = NS) and overall survival was 47% and 44%, respectively (P = NS). In a multivariate analysis, after statistical adjustments for the differences between the 2 groups, NRM, relapse or progression, PFS and OS were not statistically different between UCBT and MUD.",

Nineteen patients (median age 54 years, range 18-70) with resistant/relapsed non-Hodgkin (13) or Hodgkin (6) lymphoma were consecutively enrolled in the study. The new conditioning regimen (BeEAM) consisted of increasing doses of Bendamustine coupled with fi xed doses of Etoposide (200 mg/m\u00b2/day on days -5 to -2), Cytarabine (400 mg/m\u00b2 on days -5 to -2) and Melphalan (140 mg/m\u00b2 on day -1) (BeEAM regimen). Three cohorts of 3 patients each were treated starting with Bendamustine 160 mg/m\u00b2/daily given on days -7 and -6. The dose of Bendamustine was then escalated according to the Fibonacci's increment rule until the onset of severe adverse events and/or the attainment of the expected MTD, but not higher than 200 mg/m\u00b2. Patients were carefully monitored for adverse events. The administration of Bendamustine was safe in all the 3 cohorts of patients, with only 1 patient presenting a grade III oral mucositis. We then fi xed the dose of Bendamustine 200 mg/m\u00b2 as safe and effective for the Phase II study. A median number of 7.1 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + /kg cells (range 2.4-15.5) collected from peripheral blood were reinfused to patients. All patients engrafted, with a median time to ANC>0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /l of 10 days. Median times to achieve a platelet count > 20 \u00d7 10 9 /l and > 50 \u00d7 109/l were 13 and 15 days respectively. Ten out of 19 patients presented a fever of unknown origin (52%). The median number of days with fever was 2 (range: 0-7), with a median number of 9 days of intravenous antibiotics (range: 3-22). All patients received G-CSF after transplant for a median time of 8 days (range: 8-13). Fourteen out of 19 patients are evaluable for the response to treatment. All evaluable patients are alive and in complete remission, after a median follow-up of 5 months from transplant. It is of note that 2/19 patients achieved the fi rst complete remission after receiving the high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell rescue.",

We retrospectively evaluated the role of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) alone or after chemotherapy (CT) or after Rituximab as salvage treatment in a cohort of consecutive Hodgkin's (HL) and non-Hodgkin's (NHL) lymphoma patients allografted with reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) including thiotepa, fl udarabine and cyclophosphamide. Progression free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from relapse to event were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier, and relapse incidence (RI) by Cumulative Incidence method with competing risks. Cox multivariate analysis' covariates were disease (HL vs. indolent vs. aggressive NHL), age (< 55 y.o. vs. \u2265 55), Sorror comorbidity score (\u2264 1 vs. > 1), DLI (DLI vs. no DLI) and Rituximab treatment (Rituximab vs. no Rituximab). Of 146 patients receiving allo-SCT, 57 (39%) relapsed, 48 of them (84%) received a salvage treatment. Median age was 50 years (range 19-65), 12 patients (25%) had HL, 13 (27%) indolent and 23 (48%) aggressive NHL. Median previous CT lines were 3 (range 2-7), 50% of patients failed a previous autoSCT and 50% had > 1 comorbidity score. Donors were siblings (67%) or matched unrelated (33%). After immunosoppression withdrawal and in the absence of aGVHD, DLI at escalating doses were administered every 45 days. Twenty-four (50%) B-cell lymphoma patients received DLIs (median 2, range 1-5), of whom 10 (21%) after Rituximab \u00b1 CT. One-and 2-years OS, PFS, and RI were 61 and 39%, 50 and 30%, and 45 and 65%, respectively. In univariate analysis DLI treatment improved PFS (P = 0.005) and OS (P = 0.06) and reduced RI ( In conclusion, DLI treatment may improve survival and reduce RI as compared to CT alone, and Rituximab alone improves OS. Rituximab treatment and DLI improves both PFS and OS and should be the treatment of choice.",

However, little is known about the patterns and outcome of MCL recurrence after autoSCT. To address these issues, we have conducted a retrospective study of 118 consecutive patients who underwent autoSCT for MCL from 08/1992 to 08/2008 at three large referral centres. Patients: 95 patients (80%) were autografted as part of fi rst-line therapy, and 23 (20%) as part of salvage treatment. Median age at transplant was 57 years (range 30 to 74). 76 patients (64%) received rituximab (R) prior autoSCT and 42 patients (36%) did not. Induction therapy included CHOP-like therapy only in 39 patients (33%) and ara-C intensifi cation in 79 patients (67%). 74 patients (63%) received a TBI-based high-dose regimen. Results: 49 relapses occurred with a cumulative incidence of 45% after 5 years. Only 3 patients relapsed later than 5 years (90, 91 and 171 months) post autoSCT. Cox regression analysis of relapse incidence identifi ed no RTX treatment before autoSCT (P = 0.005 HR 2.68) and salvage autoSCT (P < 0.001 HR 5.38 ) as predictive for relapse, whereas ara-C intensifi cation, TBI, age and year of transplant had no infl uence. More-over, the interaction term R*salvage autoSCT remained in the fi nal model, implying that the benefi cial effect of prior R was evident only in the subset receiving upfront autoSCT (P = 0.028 HR 0.15). Median OS from relapse was 22 months. Treatment of relapse comprised a medium of 3 further lines of chemotherapy which contained R in 34 patients (69%). 19 patients (38%) underwent alloSCT for consolidation; 10 of them are still in ongoing complete remission. Notably, there were 4 long-term survivors who lived longer than 5 years after relapse without alloSCT. Cox regression analysis of OS after relapse revealed response duration < 1 year after autoSCT (P < 0.001 HR 15.32) as an adverse predictor for OS whereas R-containing salvage therapy with alloSCT consolidation tended to result in better OS compared to chemotherapy only (P = 0.079 HR 0.33).",

            "text": "Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDC), formerly known as blastic NK cell lymphoma, is a rare hematopoietic malignancy preferentially involving skin, bone marrow and lymph nodes. The overall prognosis of BPDC is dismal. Most patients show an initial response to acute leukemia-like chemotherapy, but relapses with subsequent drug resistance occur in virtually all patients resulting in a median overall survival of only 9-13 months. However, anecdotal long-term remissions have been reported in young patients who received early myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). As the median age at diagnosis is above 60 years, most patients at risk will not be eligible for myeloablative alloSCT. Here we present our experience with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) alloSCT from unrelated donors in elderly patients with BPDC. Seven consecutive patients with BPDC have been treated at our institution between 2004 and 2008. All patients responded to acute leukemia-like induction therapy. Three patients were ineligible for alloSCT due to comorbidity and experienced rapid relapse. Four patients proceeded to RIC alloSCT as part of fi rst-line (n = 1) or salvage treatment (n = 3). Median age was 66 (55-69) years. Two patients had active disease at the time of alloSCT. Conditioning was based on submyeloablative doses of busulfan or treosulfan with fl udarabine and ATG, followed by transplantation of unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cell grafts obtained from matched or mismatched unrelated donors. Three patients live progression-free 46, 9 and 8 months post alloSCT, one patient relapsed 7 months after SCT and died soon thereafter. We conclude that RIC SCT from unrelated donors is feasible in elderly patients with BPDC and might provide curative potential in this otherwise incurable disease. Prospective analyses of RIC alloSCT in BPDC are warranted.",

However little information is available on results with unrelated donors and on potential factors infl uencing outcome. We performed a retrospective analysis of allogeneic transplants for Hodgkin's disease within the German Cooperative Transplantation Study Group. 18 centres have provided data on patient and donor characteristics, transplant procedure and outcome. Survival data were analysed by Kaplan-Meier and tested for differences by log rank test. Multivariate analyses were done by Cox proportional hazard model. 88 patients with a median age of 30 years (range 14-58) were included. 71 (80%) patients had failed a previous autologous transplantation 582 days (median) before allotransplantation. Disease status at transplantation was CR in 18%, PR in 46% and stable or progressive disease in 36%. Donors were matched related in 40% and unrelated in 60%, a mismatch was present in 21 patients.

In contrast to the relatively high incidences of GvHD and non-relapse mortality, the relapse rates were low and OS and PFS are promising. Rituximab has no role in the prevention of GvHD in this setting. We do not believe that minimal conditioning and in vivo T-Cell depletion will cure patients with high-risk aggressive lymphoma.",

We only compared patients who relapsed after an autologous SCT (autoSCT) and were alive at least 12 months after autoSCT. To correct the recruitment bias, the propensity score (PS) methodology was used to determine the probability of receiving alloSCT in the group of patients who relapsed after autoSCT, according to a set of baseline characteristics. Parameters used for this PS score were age, primary chemorefractory disease and stage III-IV at fi rst relapse. 31 patients received an allo-SCT between 2000 and 2007. Median age at alloSCT was 26 years. Median number of previous lines of chemotherapy was 3.6 and 28 patients were previously autografted. 13 were considered refractory to primary treatment and 11 to secondary treatment. At alloSCT 20 patients were in CR, 9 in PR and 2 in progressive disease. 26 patients received a reduced intensity conditioning regimen. Most of the patients (n = 24) received peripheral stem cells and donors were HLA-identical siblings in 15 cases. Median follow-up after autoSCT and alloSCT was 62 and 51 months respectively. All patients engrafted. Grade II-IV acute GVHD occurred in 10 patients and chronic GVHD in 13. 3 months after alloSCT, 19 patients were in remission, 5 presented stable disease and 7 were progressive. 11 patients relapsed despite alloSCT and 11 patients died. The estimated 3-year overall and event free survival were respectively 69% (95% CI [48;82]) and 41% (95% CI [23;58]) and 3-year non relapse mortality was 21% (95% CI [13;29]). Causes of death after alloSCT were progression in 6 and toxicity in 5 patients. From the 31 alloSCT recipients, 15 matched pairs were successfully constituted according to the PS. Based on these matched pairs, the estimated hazard ratio of death was 0.24 (95% CI [0.07;0.80]) for allografted patients compared with non allografted. AlloSCT in poor-prognosis Hodgkin lymphoma gives promising survival outcomes and provides survival benefi t in comparison with non allograft treatment as suggested by PS method. Patients and methods. To describe the results of intensive therapy and stem cell transplantation (SCT) in patients with LG, a retrospective survey was conducted among transplant centers belonging to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT). As LG is not reported as an independent histological entity to the EBMT DataBase, a questionnaire was sent to the centers, thus identifying 8 patients (7 ASCT, 1 allo-SCT), who were transplanted from 1998 to 2008. In addition, we were able to collect the follow-up data of a patient with LG, who was subject of a case report (Lemieux et al., Hematology 2002, Vol. 7 (6) , pp. 355-358) . The patient cohort fi nally consisted of 4 males and 5 females with a median age of 36 (range 14-52) years. Two patients had localized disease (stage I-1 patient; stage II-1 patient) and 7 patients had stage IV disease, 4 patients presented with B symptoms. The lungs were the most frequently involved extranodal site (7 patients, 3 with liver involvement). EBV serology was positive in 5 of the 7 cases in which the information was known. Results. Eight patients had received at least 2 lines of therapy before SCT including Rituximab in 5 patients, the median time interval between diagnosis and SCT being 10 (range 6 -52) months. All patients had active disease at the time of SCT: 7 patients were in partial remission (PR) and 2 had stable disease (SD). Seven of the 8 autologous recipients were conditioned with the BEAM regimen (including Zevalin in one case), and the remainder was conditioned with fl udarabine/busulfan/ cyclophosphamide. A reduced intensity-conditioning regimen (fl udarabine plus an alkylating agent) was used prior to allo-SCT. One ASCT patient (13%) died of non-relapse mortality (S. salivarius shock, no evidence of LG at the autopsy) and 1 ASCT patient committed suicide being disease-free 19 months after SCT. The remaining 7 patients (6 ASCT, 1 allo-SCT) are alive and disease-free with a median follow up of 27 (range 8-57) months after SCT. Conclusions. Hematopoietic SCT is an excellent therapy for patients with relapsed LG. The optimal time for ASCT as well as the optimal transplant modalities need further study. High-dose chemotherapy (HDT) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (HDT/ASCT) has represented a rescue option from poor prognosis of peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL). However, the effectiveness of ASCT on distinct PTCL subtypes, the optimal transplant timing during the clinical courses and the available prognostic factors in order to predict the better outcomes are still unclear. Patients and methods: We investigated the clinical outcomes of HDT/ASCT as frontline intensifi cation in 33 patients with newly diagnosed PTCL from fi ve Korean institutions between Oct. 2003 and Feb. 2009 . Eligibility criteria is followings as: 1) age under 65 years, 2) histologically proven PTCL except ALK( + ) anaplastic large cell and primary cutaneous/subcutaneous panniculitis, 3) patients who achieved complete (CR) or partial response (PR) after primary chemotherapy, 4) ECOG performance status \u2264 2 5) no severe concomitant disease. Patients underwent ASCT with a uniform conditioning regimen (busulfex, cyclophosphamide and etoposide). Results: The median age was 47 years (17-65). The histological subtypes were 48.5% PTCL-unspecifi ed (n = 16), 24.2% anaplastic large cell (n = 8), 6.1% angioimmunoblastic T cell (n = 2), 18.2% extranodal NK/T cell (n = 6), and 3.0% hepatosplenic gamma-delta T cell (n = 1). Twenty-one patients (63.6%) presented in advanced stages (III/IV) and 12 (36.4%) had B symptoms. At diagnosis, 14 patients (42.4%) were classifi ed as high-intermediate/high risk by the age-adjusted IPI S251 (aaIPI) and 6 (18.2%) were classifi ed as high-risk (more than 2 factors) by the prognostic index for PTCL (PIT). Disease status at transplant consisted of 25 patients (75.8%) with CR and 8 patients (24.2%) with PR. 6 of 8 PR patients improved the response to CR after transplant. There was no signifi cant difference in response rates between patients treated with CHOP alone or CHOP-like chemotherapy and those treated with another non-anthracycline-based chemotherapeutic regimen. At a median follow-up of 27.5 months, 24 patients (72.7%) are alive and 7 patients (21.2%) relapsed. The 3-year probability of progression-free survival (PFS) was 80.9 \u00b1 7.0%. One patient (3.0%) died due to transplant-related mortality (any death within 60 days). The high PIT and high-risk aaIPI were poor prognostic factors in PFS. Conclusion: Our data suggest that frontline HDT/ASCT in patients with PTCL could be performed safely with high response rates and showed a substantial impact on improving outcome for PFS.",

The age limit was 60 years. Methods: After this fi rst study we continued to enroll in the same protocol all the pts with MCL referred to our Institution: 26 consecutive pts (4 females/22 males), median age 60 years (range 38-72), have completed the therapy. All pts had advanced disease and are suitable for evaluation.

At the transplant, the stem cells were PCR negative in all the pts. Two bacterial infections, a sepsis and a pneumonia, were the only complications observed. At present, 20/26 are alive (OS at 5 y = 90%), 17/26 are in continuous CR (PFS 5 y > 71%), with a median follow-up of 43 months (range 7-74). Two pts died because of progression and four because of secondary neoplasia (3 MDS, 1 solid tumor). One patient, relapsed 14 months after treatment was rescued with allogeneic bone marrow transplant, one is in partial remission and one has relapsed.

The remission rate, survival and the progression free survival are comparable to those obtained in a younger cohort of patients with the same diagnosis. The study included 205 patients, 136 (66%) male, receiving allogeneic HSCT for non Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 106, including 30 with CLL), Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 29) or myeloma (n = 70). Median age was 48 (9-68) years. Of these 111 had failed prior autologous HSCT, median interval from diagnosis to transplants was 24 months. Stem cell source was bone marrow in 17 and peripheral blood in 188. Donors were identical siblings in 144, twins in 10, unrelated or mismatched related donors in 51. EBMT risk score (incorporating age, disease stage, time interval between diagnosis and transplantation, donor type, and donor recipient gender combination) was 2-3 in 59, 4-5 in 123 and 6-7 in 23. Results: Survival at 5 years was 61 \u00b1 12% for Non Hodkgins' lymphoma, 53 \u00b1 26% for Hodgkin lymphoma and 47 \u00b1 15% for multiple myeloma (P = ns) ( Figure 1 ). Cumulative incidence of treatment related mortality at 5 years was 11 (10-12)% without differences among disease groups. Relapse incidence at 5 years was 50 (48-51)%, 31 (22-43)% for NHL, 58 (40-83)% for Hodgkin lymphoma, and 64 (52-78)% for myeloma. Conclusion: A considerable proportion of patients with lymphoid neoplasia becomes long term survivors after allogeneic HSCT. Weather the higher relapse incidence of Hodgkin lymphoma and myeloma as compared to Non Hodgkins' lymphoma is due to patient selection or differences in graft versus lymphoma effects remains to be elucidated.",

We retrospectively evaluated the outcome of 103 (female: 39, male: 64) pts, who underwent 1st ASCT for HL from September 1990 to November 2008 and relapsed or progressed. Sixty-four pts had been transplanted for refractory disease. The median time to relapse/progression was 5 (0.7-132) months post ASCT, and < 12 months in 77/103 pts. The median age at relapse was 29 (13-67) years. The stage at relapse was advanced (III or IV) in 58, and B-symptoms were present in 26 pts. In 41 pts, progression of disease to additional sites was noted. Salvage treatment was chemotherapy \u00b1 irradiation (R/T) in 75 pts, R/T only in 6, 2nd SCT in 14 (ASCT in 3, and alloSCT with a reduced-intensity regimen in 11), while 2 refused any therapy. Six pts had a positive PET-scan without clinical suggestion of active disease, and did not receive any treatment (watch-and-wait approach). Sixty of the 95 treated pts achieved a complete (38 pts, 40%) or partial (22 pts, 24%) remission. The interval of < 12 months from 1st ASCT to relapse, advanced stage and presence of B-symptoms at relapse, as well as the disease refractoriness before 1st ASCT emerged as signifi cant adverse factors for response rate (P < 0,05 by t-test). The median survival for all pts was 29.5 months. Multivariate analysis revealed late relapse (> 12 months), absence of B-symptoms at relapse and disease sensitivity before 1st ASCT as signifi cant factors for prolonged survival (P < 0.05). The type of treatment had no impact on survival rates. Three of the 14 re-transplanted pts (2 allo-and 1 autografted) are alive (with 2 in CR for 7 and 5 years, respectively). Eight re-transplanted pts succumbed to progressive disease and 3 to treatment related toxicity. Interestingly, all 6 patients managed with the watch-and-wait approach are alive without disease progression for a median of 12 (1.5-45) months. Our results confi rm that selected pts with relapsed or progressed HL following ASCT could be rescued with recent treatment modalities. Currently, given the conventional and alternative treatment options, management of relapsed disease post 1st ASCT remains a challenge and prospective studies with large series of pts are needed to establish the appropriate approach.",

Sureda on behalf of the GITMO and LWP of the EBMT Patients with HL relapsing or progressing after fi rst ASCT may be offered several therapeutic options. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess if RIT, performed along the fi rst year after relapse, is associated to an improved survival compared to conventional chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (CHEMO-RT). In order to ensure the comparability of the groups regarding salvage therapy options and follow-up, statistical analysis was restricted to ASCT performed in the period of 2000-2005. Overall survival (OS) from relapse or progression after ASCT was the main endpoint of the study. Cox multivariate regression analysis was performed to adjust for all prognostic factors, and RIT was included in the Cox model as a time-dependent covariate. A total of 195 patients were treated with CHEMO-RT and 49 received a RIT. There were no statistical differences in sex, histological HL subtype, time from ASCT to relapse, stage of HL, presence of B symptoms, bulky disease, extranodal involvement at ASCT, or performance status at relapse between groups. Patients treated with RIT were signifi cantly younger than those treated with CHEMO-RT (P = .02). Donors were HLA-matched related in 26 patients (53%), unrelated in 13 (27%), and other alternative donors were used in 10 (20%). Fludarabine-based conditioning regimen was used in most patients (76%). Disease status at the time of RIT was as follows: 9 patients (18%) were in complete remission, 28 (57%) had sensitive disease and 12 (25%) had refractory HL. Seven patients died after RIT of non-relapse causes, giving estimated non-relapse mortality (NRM) of 10% at 2 years. Disease relapse or progression occurred in 29 patients following RIT (median time 8 months, range 1-19), giving cumulative incidence of relapse of 61% at 2 years. Median follow-up after relapse for surviving patients was 38 months (range 6-90). Overall survival from relapse after ASCT for RIT and CHEMO-RT patients was 48% and 32%, respectively, at 4 years. Median survival time after relapse was 45 and 19 months for RIT and CHEMO-RT groups, respectively. In multivariate analysis, RIT was associated to a trend to an improved survival as compared to CHEMO-RT (P = .08). This study suggests that allogeneic RIT may be useful in the management of patients with HL relapsing after ASCT.",

RICT is considered as the last therapeutic option and is usually offered to HL patients failing ASCT and in this contest GvLy responses might be insuffi cient. Aims: We pionered that offering RICT as an earlier option after intensive cytoreduction (ASCT) may allow GvLy reaction to be better exploited (Carella et al. JCO 2000; 18:3918) . Patients and methods: thirtyfi ve refractory (n = 26)/relapsed (n = 9) HL patients (21M/14F) underwent RICT preceeded by autografting (ASCT). Patients progressing after ASCT were excluded from the analysis. Median n\u00b0 of chemotherapy lines before tandem ASCT-RICT was 2.5 (range 2-4) . Median age at diagnosis was 27 (range 15-47). Twenty patients (80%) had disease before tandem (CR = 7; PR = 14; SD = 4; PRO = 10). Highdose therapy consisted of Melphalan 200mg/mq (n = 9) and BEAM (n = 26).

Ten patients (28%) developed aGVHD (grade II-IV) and 13 cGVHD (2 limited and 11 extensive). Non relapse mortality (NRM) was 8%. Early response to tandem was as follow: CR = 22; PR = 2; SD = 1; PRO = 10. At the last follow up 22 patients (63%) were alive, 18 (82%) in RC and 4 (18%) with disease. Thirteen patients expired (37%), 7 of disease progression, 1 of aGVHD, 1 of cGVHD and 2 of infection and 2 myocardial infarction.With a median follow-up of 48 months (6-127 months), median OS and PFS were 60.5 months and 11.5 months respectively. The three years OS and PFS was 76.5 and 41.6% respectively. Conclusions: With the limits of a retrospective study, these encouraging results suggest that GvLy may have a role on residual disease after ASCT determinig a disease chonicization. A prospective study based on genetic randomization (ASCT vs. ASCT followed by RICT) would help to answer this important issue.",

Casper (10) Objectives: Response to salvage therapy in relapsed aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) depends on primary chemosensitivity and the duration of 1st remission. While late relapse can be cured with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell support, pts with early relapse or refractory disease may need additional therapy with allogeneic transplantation. Further, a treosulfan-containing high-dose regimen may be an alternative to the widely used BEAM protocol. Methods: Pts with aggressive NHL at 1st relapse or with refractory disease received two cycles (R)-DHAP followed by (R)-TEC (high-dose treosulfan, etoposide, and carboplatinum, + rituximab for pts with B-cell NHL). Subsequently, pts with late relapse at study entry (duration of 1st CR less than 1 year) who achieved CR after (R)-DHAP or (R)-TEC received no further treatment (A) ; pts with late relapse who achieved only PR after R-TEC received a 2nd high-dose treatment with (R)-TEC (B); and pts with early relapse or refractory disease who achieved at least PR after (R)-TEC were scheduled for high-dose fl udarabin and treosulfan followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation (C). Results: Of 61 pts (median age 53 yrs), 87% had B-, 13% T-cell lymphoma. 36% had refractory disease, 32% early and 32% late relapse. So far, 32 pts received (R)-TEC high dose therapy. Of these, 4 had double high-dose (R)-TEC, and 10 allogeneic transplantation. Grade 3 or 4 toxicity with (R)-TEC was infection in 39%, mucositis in 61%, and diarrhea in 39%. Best response in 53 evaluable pts was CR in 30%, near CR in 8%, PR in 17%, NC (no change) in 13%, and PD in 32%. 36 pts (65%) either progressed at any time or had NC after high dose therapy. Mean follow up time is 13.8 (range 0.5-56.8) months. Median event free and overall survival (OS) was 6.6 and 12 months for all pts. With respect to individual risk, OS in pts with refractory disease, early or late relapse was 9.3, 13.1, and 16.7 months, resp. Among 10 pts who received allogeneic transplantation, OS is 10 months with 4 pts alive to date, 3 of which between 30 and almost 60 months. 28 pts (52%) are alive, 5 pts are still under treatment.",

Few prospective studies addressed its prognostic value in the setting of high dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) so far. We evaluated the predictive role of PET/CT before ASCT (PET/ CT2) and after ASCT (PET/CT3) in lymphoma patients in terms of overall survival (OS) and progression-free-survival (PFS). OS and PFS have been evaluated using Kaplan-Meier estimates; OS and PFS curves have been assessed using Log-rank test.We enrolled 17 patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma (9 in relapse, 8 refractory disease at early PET/CT in induction), 43 patients with non Hodgkin Lymphoma (15 in relapse, 15 in PR after fi rst line treatment, 13 at high-risk while in CR). All patients presented a positive PET/CT (PET/CT1) before starting treatment. 60 patients underwent both PET/CT2 and PET/CT3. After ASCT 5 patients never achieved a CR and all died because of progressive disease; 51 patients after ASCT were in CR (including 24 patients in CR before ASCT); 4 were in PR and they obtained CR after radiotherapy. No patients died of treatment-related-mortality. Of note 4 patients presented a PET/CT positivity after ASCT with a decreasing uptake at subsequent controls and without a clear correlation with any lesion detectable by CT: none of them relapsed. Median follow up is 27 months ( Figure 1 ). All relapses have been documented in PET/CT3 positive group within 16 months from ASCT (median 6 months). In PET/CT3 negative group 3 patients died, one of TRM after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, one of secondary leukaemia after radioimmunotherapy and the last because of progressive disease. 7 PET/CT3 positive patients died: 6 because of progressive disease and one of TRM after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In this cohort, the role of PET/CT2 in predicting relapse after ASCT is less clear compared to previous published studies, while the role of PET/CT3 seems to be more reliable, especially for early relapses.

We retrospectively evaluated long-term outcome and prognostic factors affecting survival of 63 pts, median age 35 (15-64) years, with PTCL treated with autoHCT following BEAM (44 pts), CBV (8 pts), Cy/TBI (5 pts) and other regimen (6 pts). According to WHO 2001 classifi cation histologic subtypes included PTCL not otherwise specifi ed (n = 25), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (n = 9), ALKnegative anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) (n = 9), ALKpositive ALCL (n = 12) and ALK-undetermined ALCL (n = 8).",

All pts with ALK-positive ALCL were transplanted due to inadequate response to fi rst line therapy or relapse. The patients were treated with the median 2 (range 1-3) chemotherapy (chtx) lines before autoHCT. The disease status at transplant was CR1 (36 pts), CR2 (8 pts), PR1 (12 pts), PR2 (4 pts) and less then PR (3 pts). IPI at auto-HCT was 0 in 53 pts, 1 in 6 pts, 2 in 1 pts, and not determined in 3 pts. With a median follow-up of 29 (2-163) months OS and PFS was 74% (95% CI 61-85) and 64% (95% CI 49-79) at 5 yrs respectively estimated with the K-M method. The cumulative incidence of relapse and NRM was 34% (95% CI 22-52%) and 3% (95% CI 0,8-12%) respectively. In univariate analysis, prognostic factors associated with decreased OS were the disease status at transplant (less then CR vs. CR, P 0.029), IPI at transplant (1-2 vs. 0, P 0.013) and the number of prior chtx lines (> 2 vs. 1-2 lines, P 0.0018). PFS was adversely affected by IPI at transplant (1-2 vs. 0, P 0.013) and the disease status at transplant (less then CR vs. CR, P 0.09). In multivariate analysis, IPI at autoHCT (RR 3.8, 95% CI 1.1-13.2, P 0.03 ) and the number of prior chtx lines (HR 4.1, 95%CI 1.2-13.9 , P 0.02) remained statistically signifi cant for OS and IPI at autoHCT (HR 4.4, , P 0.01) for PFS. We conclude that the signifi cant proportion of patients with chemosensitive PTCL treated with autoHCT can achieve long lasting PFS.

Methods: Computed tomography and PET scan were performed just prior to ASCT and at 3 months post transplant. Findings were correlated with failure free survival (FFS). PET scan was considered negative, when no uptake was present, positive, when any lesion was FDG avid with SUV \u2265 4 and minimal residual uptake positive (MRUp), when any lesion showed abnormal uptake with SUV < 4. Results: Among 44 patients included in the study, 55% were treated for primary refractory disease, 36% at fi rst relapse and 10% beyond fi rst relapse. All patients received salvage chemotherapy and 73% had chemosensitive disease prior to ASCT. A PET scan was available prior to ASCT in 34 patients, post ASCT in 39 and at both time points in 31. Median follow-up was 14 months (4-64). Eight patients had a negative pre-ASCT scan and one of them relapsed, whereas 13 relapses were observed among 26 patients with a positive or MRUp pre-ASCT PET scan, resulting in a 1-year FFS of 100% and 49% respectively. However this difference was not statistically signifi cant. The fi gure of 49% reached a plateau at 8 months posttransplant. Pre-ASCT PET scan was positive or MRUp in 17/25 chemosensitive patients vs. 9/9 chemoresistant ones. On the contrary, post-ASCT PET scan had a strong predictive value for outcome. One-year FFS was 96% for post ASCT PET negative or MRUp cases vs. 8% for positive ones (P < 0.0001). Among the 31 patients who had a PET scan available at both time points, there were no relapses recorded for those who were pre-ASCT PET scan either positive or MRUp and became post-ASCT PET scan negative (0/12 patients). On the contrary, 12/13 patients with a pre-ASCT PET scan positive or MRUp, who remained or became post-ASCT PET scan positive, relapsed. There was one relapse among 8 patients who were pre-ASCT PET scan negative and remained negative after ASCT. There were no cases who converted from negative to positive.",

Gurman Ankara University School of Medicine (Ankara, TR) Autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) provide rapid and sustained hematopoietic recovery after the administration of high-dose chemotherapy in patients with lymphoma. Therefore, standard mobilization regimen for PBSC is the combination of chemotherapy and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Mostly preferred chemotherapy regimen for mobilization is cyclophosphamide and/or etoposide (CyVP16) followed by G-CSF. In refractory and/or relapse lymphoma patients DHAP (Dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin) is usually used for the salvage regimens.",

Yoon (5) , Y.H. Min (4) , S.H. Yang (6) , C.S. Kim (1) , S. Park (5) For a 10 year period of 1999-2008, a total of 44 patients underwent HDC (high dose chemotherapy) followed by ABSCT (autologous blood stem cell transplantation) for the treatment of PTCL (peripheral T cell lymphoma) in 6 institutions in South Korea. The patients consisted of 28 men and 16 women aged 14-63 (median 36.5) , diagnosed as PTCL-u (n = 28), ALK negative ATCL (n = 8), AITL (n = 4), SCPTCL (n = 1) and HSTCL (n = 1), and initially presented in stage III or greater in the majority (n = 37). Remission induction was attempted with CHOP (n = 24), CHOEP (n = 5, E = etoposide), IMEP (n = 5, I = ifosphamide, M = methotrexate, P = cisplatin) and others (n = 10) resulting in PR in 12 (28%) and CR1 in 32 (72%) among whom 16 (50%) relapsed. Re-induction was attempted for recurrent disease with IMEP (n = 4), ICE (n = 3, C = carboplatin), and others (n = 9) resulting in CR2 in 9 (56%). ABSCT was given aimed at consolidation of CR1 in 16 (group 1) as well as salvage for persistent disease in 12 (group 2) or disease in relapse in 16 (group 3) . Conditioning for ABSCT consisted in BEAM (n = 15), BuCyE (n = 9), CBV (n = 7), NEAM (n = 7, N = mitoxantrone), and others (n = 6). There was no signifi cant difference in age, sex, stage on initial diagnosis, and HDC regimen among 3 groups. Engraftment was documented in 43 patients (98%) at a median day of 11 (range 6-80). Although there was no meaningful difference among median days of engraftment, it took longer than 4 weeks for engraftment in 1 (8%) of group 2, and 3 (19%) of group 3 (P < 0.05). Ten of group 1 (63%) are alive disease free at a median FU (follow-up) of 21.5 months ranging 1-120, as are 5 of group 2 (42%) at a median FU of 5.5 months ranging 2-56, and 7 of group 3 (43%) at a median FU of 6.5 months ranging 1-128 (P < 0.01). Taken together, 22 (50%) are alive disease free at a median FU of 16 months. Causes of death included relapse/progression in 15 (34%, n = 4 in group 1, 5 in group 2, 6 in group 3, P > 0.3) and TRM in 7 (16%, n = 2 in group 1, 2 in group 2, 3 in group 3, P > 0.3). Although it appeared to be better to perform HDC and ABSCT as a consolidation therapy for remission of PTCL rather than a salvage treatment for recurrence, identifi cation of particular factors in CR1 favoring ABSCT was diffi cult on this limited retrospective analysis.",

Kim, D.H. Lee, S.W. Kim, J.R. Huh, J.S. Lee, C.W. Suh Asan Medical Center (Seoul, KR) Introduction: Although the role of high dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in the treatment of aggressive lymphoma has been established, optimal second line treatment, including high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell support, is not well established in patients with peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL). The purpose of this retrospective study was to compare the outcome of salvage chemotherapy only with that of HDCT and ASCT in patients with relapsed disease after having reaching a complete response (CR). Methods: We retrospectively investigated the outcome of salvage treatments for patients with relapsed PTCL who had reached a CR. Results: Between January 1999 and February 2009, 39 patients (15 peripheral T cell lymphoma;  14 extranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma; 5 anaplastic large cell lymphoma; and 6 angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma) were identifi ed to be eligible for this analysis in our institution. Among them, 25 were treated with only salvage chemotherapy and 14 were treated with HDCT/ASCT. The salvage chemotherapy regimens were ESHAP given in 52% and DHAP given in 12%. Also the conditioning chemotherapy regimens for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) were ESHAP given in 50% and DHAP given in 14. 2% . The median number of chemotherapy regimen was 3. The overall response rate of salvage chemotherapy was 64% with a CR rate of 48% but that of ASCT/ HDCT was 92% with a CR rate of 50% relatively (P = 0.023). With median follow-up time of 20.7 months, there were no statistical differences between the two groups in terms of relapse-free survival (relapse-free survival: ASCT/HDCT = 8.7 months, Salvage chemotherapy = 8.4 months, P = 0.794) and overall survival (P = 0.390). Conclusion: There were no signifi cant differences between the two groups in terms of survival outcome. Therefore, considering the dismal outcome in relapsed PTCL patients even after treated with HDCT/ASCT, incorporation of novel therapeutics into a treatment regimen should be considered.",

Sessa, L. Mettivier, L. Bene, G. Nunziata, S. Rocco, V. Mettivier A.Cardarelli Hospital (Naples, IT) The Autologous transplantation is an effective therapy in the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Over the last decade the advent of monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD20 conjugated or not) has triggered the possibility of changing the transplantation procedure, or conducting an in purging vivo or intensifying the conditioning with radio-conjugated. From May 2005, at our division, have been auto transplanted 24 patients with CD20 + NHL (17 have done a purging in vivo (BEAM-R) and 9 have intensifi ed the conditioning with the addition of radio-conjugated at day -14 to transplantation (Z-BEAM). The aim of our study is to assess whether there are differences in terms of DFS, OS and EFS between these 2 groups of patients. The characteristics of patients in the 2 groups were: 12 M and 5 F median age of 57 years (range 17-65) in the BEAM-R and 6 M and 3 F median age of 50 years (range 40-69) in Z-BEAM. In the BEAM-R group 10 patients had high grade lymphomas, 4 mantle cells and 3 follicular, the status at transplant has been: CR: 8; PR: 7 and NR: 2. In Z-BEAM group, 4 patients had high grade lymphomas, 4 follicular, and 1 mantle cells, the status disease at the transplant were: CR in 4 patients; PR: 4 and NR: 1. The median of CD34 cells infused was 4 \u00d7 10 6 / Kg in both groups. The Haematological recovery assessed with N > 1000/mm\u00b3 and PLT > 20,000/mm\u00b3 were 11 and 12 days respectively in groups BEAM-R and Z-BEAM. The TRM assessed in the 2 groups has been 2/17 (11%) in the BEAM-R and 2/9 (22%) of Z-BEAM group, this high incidence is due to patients highly treated or in active disease. With a median follow-up of 50 months after autotransplant, 9/15 (60%) were in CR in BEAM-R group whereas in Z-BEAM group the median PFS were of 12 months. The EFS median are 26 and 8 months respectively for the BEAM-R and Z-BEAM group. This difference is not statistically signifi cant (p: 0.07, Cox F-test) . In conclusion, even if the number of the patients is small, the difference in terms of DFS, OS and EFS doesn't seem signifi cant among the two regimes of conditioning. Is necessary a randomized study to confi rm these preliminary data.",

Masszi (1) (1) St. Istvan and St. Laszlo Hospital (Budapest, HU) ; (2) Objectives: Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HTSTCL) is a rare aggressive type of extranodal lymphomas characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, bone marrow involvement, and peripheral blood cytopenias. Non-hepatosplenic gamma/delta (g/d) T-cell lymphomas display marked heterogeneity in clinical and histologic features. Therapeutic strategies effi cacious for aggressive B-cell lymphomas usually fail in the caseses of HTSTCL and other g/d T-cell lymphomas. The prognosis of these diseases are very poor. Methods: 8 patients with HTSTCL and other g/d T-cell lymphomas were studied. Clinical histories and possibilities of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) were reviewed. Results: Our study consisted of 2 men and 6 women with a median age of 39 years (ranging from 29 to 62 years). Histologies consisted of 6 HTSTCL (g/d + 5, a/b + 1), 1 cutaneous g/d Tcell lymphoma and 1 mucosal g/d T-cell lymphoma. All patients presented with splenomegaly and cytopenia. 6/8 patients had initial bone marrow involvement by lymphoma cells. Treatment plan was to performe autologous-and/or allogeneic-HSCT. Despite a broad spectrum of chemotherapeutic approaches including anthracycline based combination chemotherapy (CHOP or CHOP-like), salvage therapy (DHAP, IVE), interferon-a, cladribine, pentostatin and alemtuzumab therapy, only 2 patients responded. 7/8 patients died within 2-24 months, before completing induction or salvage treatment because of disease progression. Finally, only 1 patient with HTSTCL a/ b + phenotype reached the transplant. This 30y old male was received an autograft with BEAM conditioning because of resistant disease, and achieved partial remission. 16 months later, he underwent an allogeneic HSCT with in vitro T-cell depleted graft from an 1 Cw antigen mismatched unrelated donor. Conditioning consisted of Flu-Bu-ATG, GVHD prophylaxis contained tacrolimus + MMF. The patient achieved very-good partial remission. 3 months following the transplant the patient has the best response ever without any sign of GVHD. Conclusion: Promising results of allogeneic HSCT for HTSTCL patient have recently been reported. Allogeneic HSCT in a short period of remission after chemotherapy or even autologous transplant may be a choice of treatment. Allogeneic HSCT may offer some advantage by providing GVT effect. Allogeneic HSCT, is expected to become potentially a curative treatment option, and GVT effect might play a critical role for sustained remission.",

In the fi rst reports there is a new element: the inclusion of Zevalin in conditioning regimen given prior to autologous peripheral stem cell therapy (APSCT). Methods: The authors discuss their experiences of 21 follicular lymphoma patients with relapsed or refractory disease treated by Zevalin + BEAM radio-immune-chemotherapy with APSCT. Results: Six years ago (in September 2003) , the fi fth Haemopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre of Hungary began its activity. This centre registered as the No648 sub-centre of the European Blood and Marrow Transplantation Committee. Up to November 2009. 214 autologous stem cell transplantations were performed including 94 patients (pts.) with multiple myeloma, 72 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 39 with Hodgkin's disease, one pt. with CLL, one pt. with leiomyosarcoma, seven pts. with autoimmune diseases. This centre performed the most use of conditioning protocol Zevalin, bischloroethylnitrosourea, etoposide, cytosine arabinoside, and melphalan (Z-BEAM) in pts. with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in Hungary. Since February 2006 to November 2009, 21 pts. were involved: 10 women, and 11 men, mean age 49,5 \u00b1 11,1 years, 48,4 \u00b1 9,7 months from diagnosis. In cases of 4 pts. the histology was follicular lymphoma grade 3, grade 2, in cases of 6 pts., and grade 1 in cases of 11 pts. All the 21pts. engrafted the neutrophil granulocytes in a mean 10,9 \u00b1 9,4, and the platelet engrafted 13,9 \u00b1 10,2 days after the APSCT. 71 ,4% of the pts. are in a complete remission 18,6 \u00b1 14,9 months after the transplantation. Ten pts. participate in a maintenance Mabthera therapy. One patient from the 21 has an R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicine, vincristine, prednisolon) and one patient an R-DHAP therapy (rituximab, dexamethasone, high dose cytosine arabinoside, platidium) in the post transplantations relapse. Three pts. died after the APSCT one, two and 13 months. Conclusions: According to our and others experiences Z-BEAM conditioning is a safe and effective radio-immune-chemotherapy before autologous stem cell transplantation.",

Mettivier A.Cardarelli Hospital (Naples, IT) In the last years the follicular lymphoma has benefi ted of transplantation procedures. The problem is the management of the relapse of the disease in post-transplant, were as patients highly treated. From January 2005 we have auto-transplanted, in our Division, 10 follicular lymphomas. 6/10 patients have relapsed by a median PFS of 18 months (range 9-36).All patients received strict follow-up with CT and PET and were treated early. The 6 patients relapsed were treated with 4 weekly doses of rituximab 375 mg/mq for 1 month and then re-evaluated, if CR have started maintenance with rituximab 375 mg/mq every 2 months for 2 years. 5/6 patients (83%) revalued after 4 weekly doses have documented the CR and began rituximab maintenance. With a median follow-up of 24 months all patients are in CR and were not documented complications related to treatment. In conclusion, for patients with follicular lymphoma, a strict follow-up may to consent a rapid treatment in relapsed patients after the autologous transplantation and the only immunotherapy may be suffi cient to obtain a new CR consolidated by maintenance cycles every 2 months. We need a larger cohort and a follow-up longer to confi rm these data. G. Mihaylov, P. Ganeva, N. Vasileva, E. Bekrieva, L. Garcheva, I. Tonev, M. Guenova Specialised Hospital for treatment of Hematological Diseases (Sofi a, BG) Background and objectives: We examined the characteristics and outcome of 75 patients with hematological malignancies (2 of them with solid tumors) treated with high-dose therapy (HDT) and autologous transplantation (ASCT) at our BMT Unit between October 2004 and October 2009. Design and methods: Analysis was performed examining patients' characteristics, prior chemotherapy regimens, pretransplant disease status, HDT regimen, source of stem cells, time for hematopoietic recovery, complications of transplantation, response rates, overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS). Seventy fi ve (75) patients were analysed, male/female ratio was 43/32, with median age 38.10 years (21-64). Patients undergoing ASCT were with HD (29), NHL (16 , MM (20) , AML/ ALL ( 7), solid tumors (2). All of the patients received peripheral blood stem cell graft. Patients were treated with salvage chemotherapy (ICE, DHAP, VIHA) and ASCT with conditioning type BEAM (30 patients), LACE (13) and CBV (2) for lymphoproliferative diseases, Melphalan (20) for myeloma patients and BuCy (7) for patients with acute leukemias. For patients with solid tumors we used Mega ICE as conditioning regimen. Results: Median time to WBC recovery (\u2265 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /l) was 10 days (7-18), platelets recovered in median of 10.90 days (7-21) . The disease status after the HDT with ASCT was as reported from other BMT groups in Europe. Transplant related mortality (TRM ) was 4% ( 3 patients) -because of infections complications, sepsis or multiorgan faulire. Conclusions: HDT and ASCT is an effective therapy for treatment of some relapsed and refractory HD patients, relapsed NHL and standart treatment for MM till 65 years old patient. The toxicity of HDT with ASCT can be considered as acceptable. Disease status and prior treatment before HDT was the most powerful predictive parameter for OS and RFS. Our results confi rmed that HDT with ASCT is associated with a durable RFS in a remarkable proportion of HD/NHL patients, had very good results in MM patients and that the procedure has a very low early toxicity.",

Between Jan. 2005 and Dec. 2009, 40 children (21 boys; 19 girls) aged between 3 m and 17 yrs 8 m (median 11 yrs) received MSC infusions using a common protocol at variable time points following the onset of steroid refractory grade 3/4 acute GvHD after allogeneic HSCT. Indications for transplant were AML n = 8, ALL n = 10, MDS n = 5, JMML n = 5, immune disorders n = 5, others n = 7. MSC donors were 3rd party (n = 33), haploidentical (n = 4) or both (n = 6). Eighteen children had either no (NR, n = 10) or partial resolution (PR, n = 8) to MSC, i.e. worsening/ persistent symptoms and if available no/ minimal histological changes, respectively. TRM due to infection and/or progressive GvHD was 83% in this group (see Figure) . Complete resolution (CR) of GvHD was evident in the rest and of these 20/22 children are alive, with a median follow up of 2 yrs 2 m (range 3 m to 4 yrs). Two children died from infection shortly after MSC infusions. In 28 children transplanted for malignant disease 9 died (7 due to TRM, 2 due to relapse). In the CR group no relapse has been documented (median follow up 1.6 yrs; range 2 m -2 yrs 9 m). Chronic (c)GvHD developed in 27% of evaluable children (limited 5; extensive 5), reducing performance rating to \u2264 80%. Children without cGvHD have ratings \u2265 90%. Overall survival was 60%. Recent initiation of MSC at the time of steroid failure rather than after weeks of immune suppression may have reduced fatal infections and improved response and outcome. Although infections were evident at the time of immune suppression and mortality was high in NR/PR, response to MSC allows for reduction and eventual discontinuation of pharmacological immune suppression. Long term survival in responders is associated with eventual immune recovery, no late infections and persistent remission status. Children responding to MSC treatment for severe steroid refractory GvHD have an excellent long term survival. Further studies are required in children to determine the optimal timing of MSC to improve response rates, allowing cessation of other immune suppression and, hopefully, reducing occurrence of fatal infections and cGvHD.",

Chybicka (1) (1)Wroclaw Medical University (Wroclaw, PL); (2)Department of Pediatric Oncology (Lund, SE) The aim of our study was to analyze the impact of infused CD34 + and CD3 + cell doses on survival and incidence of severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in 187 children and adolescents (median age 9.6 years, range 0.6-20.2), who underwent unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (URD HSCT). HLA typing was performed at the high resolution level: there were 159 matched-and 28 mismatched (BFM) donorrecipient pairs, respectively. All patients were given serotherapy with ATG or Campath as GVHD prophylaxis. With a median follow-up of 3.2 years (PB group) and 5.4 years (BM group) there was a statistically signifi cant advantage in disease-free survival (DFS) of pts given PBSC vs. BM (0.55 vs. 0.4, P < 0.05) . The most striking statistically signifi cant differences in OS and DFS were observed when comparing groups receiving higher and lower doses of both CD34 + and CD3 + cells in the graft. Patients receiving > 10 \u00d7 10(6) CD34 + cells/kg had OS (DFS) probability of 0.64 (0.60) vs. 0.44 (0.44 ) when given lower cell doses. Similarly patients given > 4 \u00d7 10(8) CD3 + cells/kg had OS (and DFS) probability of 0.61 (0.60) vs. 0.45 (0.43 ) when infused lower cell doses. These results were confi rmed in a multivariate Cox analysis showing that infused CD34 + cell dose lower than 10 \u00d7 10(6)/kg was a signifi cant, independent risk factor for mortality (RR 1.8, P = 0.009) . In terms of DFS, multivariate analysis revealed two independent risk factors for poor outcome: 1. infused CD3 + cell dose lower than 4 \u00d7 10(8)/kg (RR 1.8, , P = 0.01) and 2. the use of donors mismatched at 2 HLA antigens or 3 HLA allele/antigens (RR 2.4, P = 0.017 ). There was a signifi cantly higher incidence of severe aGVHD in the mismatched group (0.37) vs. matched group (0.20, P = 0.04), which, however, did not adversely affect OS or DFS. Multivariate analysis showed that: 1. the use of mismatched donors (mostly high-risk pts) acc. to BFM criteria was signifi cant, independent risk factor for incidence of severe aGVHD (RR 2.2, P = 0.033) . Furthermore multivariate analysis disclosed no significant risk factors for development of extensive cGVHD. The report demonstrates for the fi rst time in a large pediatric cohort that higher doses of transplanted CD34 + and CD3 + cells lead to improved survival without increased risk of severe GVHD. There is no need to limit the number of infused CD34 + and/or CD3 + cells in the graft from URD, at least in pediatric pts.",

Soerensen, R. Esser, S. Huennecke, A. Jarisch, U. Koehl, T. Klingebiel, D. Schwabe, P. Bader Clinic of JWG-University (Frankfurt, DE) Whereas Neuroblastoma in infants often show spontaneous regression without treatment, in older children with advanced disease outcome is still poor despite intensive treatment including autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT). In patients with relapsed tumor, the disease is usually fatal. In vitro data suggest that Natural Killer (NK) cells are able to kill NB cells. Since NK infl uence engraftment, graft versus host disease and immune reconstitution, we analyzed haploidentical SCT followed by adoptive therapy with ex vivo IL-2 stimulated NK-Cells in children with relapsed neuroblastoma. We here present the data of 4 intenisvely pretreated patients (aged 3y, 6y, 8y, 18y) with relapsed neuroblastoma who received in vitro Interleukin 2 (IL-2) stimulated donor NK-cells on day + 40 and day + 100 after haploidentical SCT. After conditioning with fl udarabine 150mg/m\u00b2, thiotepa 10 mg/kgBW, melfalan 140 mg/m\u00b2 and OKT3 ( day -8 to + 10) a median of 11.9 \u00d7 10 6 (range 9.7- 16.83 ) CD34 + cells, 39.7 \u00d7 10 3 (24.9-96.8 ) CD3 + cells, and 13.2 \u00d7 10 6 (7.15-61.7) CD56 + cells per kgBW were administered at day 0. All patients engrafted until day + 16 with complete donor chimerism. Donor NK Cells were purifi ed and further activated in culture using 1000U/mL IL-2 for 2 weeks. At day + 40 a median number of 18.26 \u00d7 10 6 CD56 + cells/kgBW) and of 17.04 \u00d7 10 6 CD56 + cells /kg BW at day + 100 was transfused. NK-Cell infusion was well tolerated, only fever on the day of administration was seen. Laboratory analyses revealed elevated serum levels of IFN-y, IL-6 and MC-P as well as a decrease of CD14 + cells for a short time period after NK-Cell-infusion. Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) (skin, maximum grade II) was observed in 3/4 patients; 2 of these patients developed GvHD before NK cell infusion. Ten and 23 months after transplantation, 2 of the 4 patients are alive with no sign of active disease; 1 patient relapsed on day + 130 and died of progressive disease, 1 patient died due to Epstein-Barr-Virus associated B-Cell-lymphoma 7 months after transplantation. We conclude that adoptive immunotherapy after haploidentical SCT with ex vivo stimulated NK-cells is feasible with acceptable toxicity and might be a promising therapeutic approach for patients with relapsed or refractory NB.",

Klingebiel (1) , P. Bader (1) (1)Goethe University (Frankfurt, DE) ; (2) In pediatric AML impending relapse can be detected by posttransplant monitoring of chimerism. However, the gold-standard method (conventional STR-PCR, quantifi able limit 1E-2) did not highlight all patients with impending relapse in the study by Bader et al. in 2004.(1) Increasing the sensitivity of the method might allow more frequent and earlier detection of signifi cant amounts of autologous cells. Real-time sequence polymorphism PCR (SP-qPCR) monitors chimerism with high sensitivity (quantifi able limit 1E-4 to 1E-3) and reproducibility, principally allowing for more frequent and earlier detection of ongoing relapse. (2) To study this, a retrospective analysis of real-time PCR based chimerism was conducted including 66 children with AML after allogeneic SCT. Here we present a re-evaluation of the cohort mentioned above (1) comparing the existing data with real-time PCR (qPCR) based chimerism. Chimerism by qPCR allowed the defi nition of two risk groups: High risk (HR) group: Autologous cells in peripheral blood > 0.5% in two consecutive samples, low risk (LR) group: all others. Outcome: HR group: 19 patients. CR: 6 (32%, 3 patients received immunotherapy), relapse: 10 (53%), TRM: 1 (5%), rejection: 2 (10%). LR group: 47 patients. CR: 31 (66%), relapse: 3 (6%), TRM: 13 (28%), rejection: 0 (0%). HR patients bared signifi cantly higher risk of relapse. Substantial mixed chimerism (MC) was detected earlier by qPCR (median/mean 7/11d, range 4-49d) compared to conventional PCR in 11/16 patients (69%). Relapsed patients without signifi cant MC (\"false negatives\") were found less frequently in qPCR (3/47, 6%) compared to conventional PCR (8/62, 13%). Signifi cant MC (qPCR) was found in 15% (3/19 ) of patients who remained in CR without intervention. LR patients showed signifi cantly higher 3-year EFS and RFS estimates compared to HR patients (52% and 73% versus 28% and 33%, P = 0.013 and P < 0.0001). Real-time PCR based chimerism in pediatric AML was reliable and allowed to detect substantial MC earlier (4-49d) in 69% of cases compared to conventional PCR. However, signifi cant MC was detected in some patients (3/19 ) who never relapsed. (1) Bader et al., BMT 33 (8): 815-21, 2004; (2) Willasch et al., Lab. Hematol. 13 (3) ",

In this study, we reviewed the clinical course of SAA patients who received unrelated, G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT), either fully matched or mismatched, to observe the effi cacy of our treatment regimen in this signifi cant subset of SAA patients treated with HSCT. Methods: A total of 9 patients received unrelated PBSCT from January, 2006 to October, 2009 (median age 11 years old, range 1-18, 8 male 1 female). Five patients underwent a conditioning regimen consisting of Cy 50 mg/kg/day (D -9, -8, -7, -6) , Flu 30 mg/m 2 /day (D -5, -4, -3, -2) , and ATG 2.5 mg/kg/day (D -3, -2, -1), while 4 patients received a modifi ed regimen in which the Cy dose was reduced to 25 mg/kg/day (D -5, -4, -3, -2) , with the rest of the regimen remaining unchanged. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and mini-dose methotrexate. Six patients (67%) showed either 1 or 2 mismatches on molecular typing for HLA-A, B, C and DR loci. All 4 patients (44%) diagnosed with very severe aplastic anemia (VSAA) entered the conditioning regimen febrile, 3 with overt sources of infection. Medians of infused cell numbers were as follows: MNC 15.1 \u00d7 10 8 /kg (5.9-18.2) , CD34 + 6.5 \u00d7 10 6 /kg (4.1-14.7) , . Results: Median time to engraftment of 1,000/mm3 neutrophils and 50,000/mm 3 platelets was 11 days (10-20) and 20 days (15-35) respectively. All showed complete donor chimerism at D + 30. The 4 VSAA patients showed defervescence and resolution of infectious signs by the time of neutrophil engraftment. Two patients (22%) experienced grade II acute GvHD. Another 2 (22%) were diagnosed with chronic GvHD (1 mild, 1 severe) that has since resolved. Five patients were treated preemptively for CMV DNAemia without major complications. With a median follow-up duration of 325 days (range 86-1,392), all 9 patients are surviving event-free. Conclusion: A reduced dose conditioning regimen consisting of fl udarabine, cyclophosphamide and ATG allowed for rapid engraftment with complete donor chimerism, without major toxicities in our cohort of 9 SAA patients treated with unrelated PBSCT despite signifi cant HLA disparities and comorbid infectious complications.",

In order to clarify these issues, a study cohort of 58 patients (13 BMT and 45 PBSCT) who received transplantation from January, 2006 to August, 2008 was analyzed for the incidence of chronic GVHD according to pertinent risk factors, including stem cell source. Chronic GVHD was then classifi ed according to the NIH Consensus Criteria (NCC) and patient response to immunosuppression was followed to determine if NCC global assessment has prognostic implications in the pediatric transplantation group. Results: Twenty-seven of 58 patients (46.6%) were diagnosed with chronic GVHD, 3 of 13 patients in the BMT group (23.1%) and 24 of 45 patients in the PBSCT group (58.8%) (P = 0.053). On univariate analysis, HLA-C mismatch (P = 0.002), patient age (P = 0.008), preceding acute GVHD (P = 0.008), and malignant disease (P = 0.014) proved to be signifi cant determinants of chronic GVHD incidence. Other factors such as stem cell source, conditioning regimen, infused CD34 + and CD3 + cell dose, proved not to have a signifi cant impact. Multivariate analysis revealed HLA-C mismatch as the most important factor regarding chronic GVHD (P = 0.008), followed by patient age (P = 0.012) and preceding acute GVHD (P = 0.026). At initial presentation, 11 patients were classifi ed as having mild (41%), 9 with moderate (33%), and 7 with severe chronic GVHD (26%) according to NCC. The oral cavity was the most common organ of diagnosis, followed by the lung. Death resulting from GVHD-related complications occurred in only 1 out of 27 patients (3.7%). Overall, 25 of 27 patients (92.6%) had chronic GVHD either resolved or controlled at the end of the follow-up period, resulting in no correlation between global GVHD severity at onset and fi nal response to immunosuppression. Conclusion: In our cohort, donor-recipient HLA-C mismatch was the most important factor with regards to chronic GVHD incidence. The NCC, although providing objective criteria for diagnosing and classifying chronic GVHD, may have limited prognostic ability when applied to children with GVHD.",

We recently reported these variants have no infl uence on outcome in children transplanted for acute leukemias. Here we present a retrospective analysis on the impact of NOD2CARD15 polymorphisms in children who received their transplant for nonmalignant diseases with regard to TRM, GVHD and survival. Patients: Between February 1997 and March 2008 74 children (median age = 6.1) could be included who underwent allogeneic SCT for nonmalignant diseases in one of the participating centers. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Goethe University Frankfurt. NOD2CARD15 mutations were assessed using RT-PCR on a BioRad IQ5 System. Diagnosis of aGvHD was based on clinical signs or histo-pathological fi ndings and was graded in line with the Seattle criteria. Results: Of the 74 transplant pairs polymorphisms were identifi ed in 24 cases (32.4%). In 7 pairs polymorphisms were found on the recipient's side, in 11 pairs on the donor's side and in 6 cases both donors and recipients revealed a gene variant. 2 recipients showed coincidence of two polymorphisms. In contrast to the group of patients with malignant diseases we found a signifi cantly higher incidence of aGvHD II-III in patients with nonmalignant disorders carrying the mutations. The cumulative incidence (CI) was 0.079 in patient/donor pairs with wild type genes compared to 0.33 in pairs with any sort of mutations (P = 0.014). The results for cGvHD are likewise: 0.081 in wild type pairs and 0.26 in pairs with NOD2CARD15 variants (P = 0.039). The cumulative incidence of TRM was 0.04 in wildtype patient/recipient pairs and 0.38 in pairs showing any mutation in the NOD2CARD15 genes (P = 0.022). Moreover, probability for two years survival (pOS) was significantly reduced if either recipient or donor carries a mutation (P = 0.02) from 0.96 in wild type pairs to 0.62 in pairs with mutations, a fi nding that could be confi rmed in multivariate analysis.",

Lawitschka (1) (1) St. Anna Children's Hospital (Vienna, AT) ; (2)Children's Cancer Research Institute (Vienna, AT) Current knowledge of factors predicting chronic Graft-versushost disease (cGVHD)-specifi c survival (GSS) in pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is based on studies focusing primarily on adults. We reviewed 84 children with cGVHD who received HSCT (59 bone marrow, 25 peripheral blood stem cells) after myeloablative (n = 49) or reduced intensity (n = 35) conditioning for malignant (n = 54) and non malignant (n = 30) diseases between 1982 and 2006 in our center. Donor was an HLA-identical sibling in 36 cases and an alternative donor in 48. A second HSCT was performed in 14, a third HSCT in 3 and donor lymphocyte infusions in 7 patients. Prior acute GVHD (no, grade I-II, grade III-IV), onset type (progressive, quiescent, de novo), classifi cation (limited vs. extensive), thrombocytopenia (< 150 G/l), kind and extent of skin involvement (sclerodermoid vs. other, > 50% vs. < 50% BSA) were analyzed as potential prognostic factors. 84 (40%) of 209 children surviving more than 100 days post HSCT developed cGVHD. Median follow-up was 8,7 years (1, (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) 6) ; causes of death in 24/84 patients were: 3 relapses, 1 secondary malignancy, 1 unknown and 19 cGVHD-related causes. 5 -year overall survival was 76% (10-year 71%, 15-year 68%). 5-year, 10-year and 15-year cumulative incidence of cGVHDrelated deaths was 20%, 22% and 25%, respectively. Non-GvHD-related deaths were rare with a 5-year, 10-year and 15-year cumulative incidence of 3%, 7% and 7%, respectively. Interestingly extent of acute GVHD, onset type, thrombocytopenia and extent of skin involvement did not adversely infl uence outcome. The only variable predictive of poor GSS was skin manifestations other than sclerodermoid with a 5 year cumulative incidence of GVHD-specifi c mortality (GSM) for sclerodermoid vs. other or no skin GVHD of 0% vs. 29% (P = 0,004). Extensive cGVHD (5 year cumulative incidence of GSM 25% vs. 10% for limited) showed a trend (P = 0,060). Our fi ndings suggest that adult cGVHD prognostic factors might not be interchangeably used in children and that further analyses are needed, especially considering the new National Institute of Health scoring system.",

Kawano (2) This prospective study was performed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of intravenous busulfan (Busulfex\u00ae) as a part of S265 a conditioning regimen (0.8 -1.2 mg/kg/dose for total 16 doses) before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in Japanese pediatric patients. Evaluation of the AUC targeting rate and relationship between the AUC and adverse events were the primary endpoints. Twenty-fi ve (14 males and 11 females: the median age 6 years; range, 5m-17y) of the 26 registered patients received i.v. busulfan after consent was obtained. The patients had acute leukemia (n = 14), CML (2), MDS (5) , solid tumors (2), and metabolic disorders (2) . Allogeneic (7 related and 16 unrelated) and autologous grafts (1 bone marrow and 1 peripheral blood) were infused into 23 and 2 patients, respectively. Five different dose schedules were used according to body weight (BW); < 9 kg (1.0 mg/kg), 9 to < 16 (1.2 mg/kg), 16 to 23 (1.1 mg/kg), > 23 to 34 (0.95 mg/kg), and > 34 kg of BW (0.8 mg/kg), as in a previous European study. Each dose was given over 2 hours and sample blood was drawn at 9 or 11 separate points for analysis by gas chromatography mass-spectrometry. The target AUC after the fi rst dose was set from 900 to 1,500 micro-mol.min/L based on other studies. We found that the AUC varied from 796 to 1,905 micro-mol. min/L, and 19 of the 25 patients (76%) remained within the target range. The AUC was below and above the target range in 2 and 4 patients, respectively. Three allo-grafts failed to engraft. One patient died in the very early stage of HSCT and two were diagnosed as engraftment failure. These latter patients were JMML (3y, M) and AML (17y, F), and they received grafts of one-locus-mismatched BM from an unrelated donor and mismatched unrelated cord blood. There were no other unknown adverse events. The relationship between the AUC and adverse events is shown below: The AUC targeting rate was 76%. Since there appeared to be no relationship between the AUC and either graft failure or VOD, busulfan dosing based on BW without adjustment by the AUC appears to be feasible in pediatric patients.",

Heilmann Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital (Copenhagen, DK) Background: Allogeneic hematoipoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is indicated in early relapsed or very high risk childhood ALL. Post transplant relapse and early treatment related mortality (TRM) are the major factors infl uencing overall survival. In recent years pre-transplant chemotherapy, transplant eligibility, donor selection, conditioning regimens, graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis and quality of supportive therapy has improved. In a retrospective study we analysed the infl uence of these factors on the improved survival observed over two eight-years time periods from January 1993 to December 2008. Results: Eighty-nine consecutive transplants performed in Danish children between 1/1-1993 and 31/12-2008 were analyzed. The median age at transplantation was 9.28 years (range 1,1-17,6); 67% were boys. Thirty-fi ve children were transplanted in the fi rst eight-years time period, 54 in the later. Transplant in fi rst complete remission (CR1) was more frequent in the later time period (57% vs. 26%). Survival improved signifi cantly over the two time periods (OS 45% and 75% respectively, P = 0.010). The presence of severe acute GvHD (grade [3] [4] was signifi cantly lower in the late period (17% vs. 4%). TRM decreased from 18% to 8% (P = 0.067) and relapse risk was reduced form 50% to 22% (P = 0.051). Improved survival fi gures were seen among children who received VP16 and total body irradiation as conditioning. The probability of survival after matched sibling transplant without MTX-prophylaxis was above 90%. Pre-transplant remission status (CR1 vs. later CR) and donor selection by high resolution tissue typing did not infl uence on survival in these data. Conclusion: Better leukaemia control as well as improved supportive treatment contributed equally to the signifi cantly improved survival after SCT for childhood ALL.",

However, simultaneously signifi cant differences between countries of this region were found correlating with national income per capita. The purpose of the current study was to assess needs of centres performing pediatric HSCT in Eastern Europe, nowadays. To accomplish this aim the specifi c questionnaire has been sent in March 2009 to 46 centres in 14 Eastern European countries. The questionnaire contained list of 12 needs, which could be rated from 1 point for least important need to 15 points for most important one. Fifteen centres from 10 countries responded, including 4 centres from \"lower\" and 11 centres from \"middle\" income countries according to the World Bank (www.worldbank.org). The study revealed that as the most important needs centres both from \"lower\" and \"middle\" income countries consider 1) clinical training for junior physicians in experienced centres outside the country, 2) close cooperation with experienced, JACIE accredited paediatric transplant centres, 3) support in preparation for accreditation procedures, and 4) clinical training for nurses in experienced centres outside the country, whilst as the least important 1) clinical training for senior physicians in experienced centres outside the country, 2) access to medical journals focusing on HSCT, 3) technical training in diagnosis, and 4) basic science training. The only important difference was the signifi canly higher rating position of the \"access to standards obligatory in paediatric HSCT\" in the \"lower\" income countries (5th position), than that one in the \"middle\" income countries (10th postion). The results of the study could be helpful in the future when planning the support for the paediatric centres in Eastern Europe within the EBMT Pediatric Diseases WP and the EBMT Outreach Program.",

We report a retrospective study of 17 paediatric patients with ALL treated in 5 centres in the UK receiving 2 or more SCT. The median age at diagnosis of ALL was 7y (1 patient <1y, 12 1-10y and 4 > 10y) and mean white cell count 122 \u00d7 10 9 /L (range 2.7-352) . Karyotypic abnormalities were present in 13/17 patients: 9 Philadelphia chromosome (Ph + ); and 4 other abnormalities (complex karyotype, t(1;19), t(4;11) and hypodiploidy). The patients were initially treated with 1 of the following schedules -ALL97/99 (7/17), UKALL12 (1/17), ALL2003 (6/17), ESPhALL (2/17) and Interfant (1/17). Patients received their fi rst SCT (SCT1) between 1996-2007 with 11/17 transplanted in fi rst complete remission (CR1), 5/17 CR2 and 1/17 with refractory disease (Ph + ). The median age at SCT1 was 7 y (range 0.8-18 y). 13/17 received TBI-containing conditioning regimes. Unrelated donors were selected for 10/17 patients with 13/15 receiving bone marrow (BM) and 2/15 peripheral blood (PB) derived stem cells. The median time from SCT1 to relapse was 14m (range 3-57 m). Following relapse, patients proceeded to second SCT (SCT2) once CR2 (11/17) or CR3 (5/17) was obtained, with 1 patient transplanted with detectable disease (6% blasts in BM). For SCT2 4/17 received TBI-containing conditioning. 2 patients received TBI for both SCT1 and SCT2 (180cGy \u00d7 8 fractions for SCT1 and then 2Gy \u00d7 1 for SCT2). Selected stem cell sources were PB (5/17), BM (9/17) and cord blood (3/17). The same donor was used for SCT1 and SCT2 in 6/17 patients. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred in 11/17 (6/11 grade I-II and 5/11 III-IV). 3/17 patients received DLI post SCT2. Median follow-up from SCT2 is 24 m (range 3-57 m). 11/17 patient have relapsed at a median of 15m from SCT2 (range 1-41 m). 8/17 have died at a median of 24 m from SCT2 (range 3-46 m) with cause of death relapsed disease (4/7), infection (3/7) or GVHD (1/7). Of relapsed patients, 3/11 have received a third SCT -all have died. Kaplan-Meier estimated overall survival and disease-free survival at 24 m following SCT2 is 72.8% and 37.6% respectively. 6/17 patients are alive and in CR following SCT2. Whilst follow-up is short these data support this approach in a select group of high risk patients. We aim to characterise this group more fully expanding the data set to include other UK treatment centres. S. Bakhtiar, J. Moskovits, E. Ponstingl, A. Jarisch, J. Soerensen, T. Klingebiel, P. Bader Goethe University Frankfurt (Frankfurt/Main, DE) Primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and Langerhans cell histicytosis (LCH) are rare diseases in children. Patients frequently presented with persistent fever, hepatosplenomegaly and pancytopenia. Some children may achieve remission after courses of chemotherapy. For high risk patients only curative treatment option is allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). These patients have often signifi cant multiorganic manifestations pre transplantation and have gone through diverse courses of chemotherapy regimens. As a consequence these patients are prone to develop organ toxicity and have an increased risk to suffer from graft versus host disease (GvHD). This results in an increased risk of transplant-related mortality (TRM) after conventional intensity conditioning regimens especially in patients with unrelated donors. Recently published data support the thesis of a better outcome in children with HLH and LCH after SCT utilizing reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens. We present fi ve children suffering from HLH (n = 3) and LCH (n = 2), who underwent bone marrow transplantation from a matched sibling donor (MSD, n = 2) or CD 3/19 depleted SCT from a matched unrelated donor (MUD, n = 3). RIC regimen included Fludarabin (5 \u00d7 30 mg/m\u00b2), Thiotepa (2 \u00d7 5 mg/kg) and Melphalan (2 \u00d7 70 mg/m\u00b2). Rapid engraftment and a quickly stabilized hematopoeisis were observed. All patients showed a primary and sustained engraftment. Median time to achieve more than 1000/\u03bcl leukocytes was 14 days (range: 10-29), and 18 days (range: 12-72) to reach more than >20.000/\u03bcl thrombocytes. There was a fast regeneration of T-lymphocytes as well. Median time to develop 100/\u03bcl T-cells was 89 days (range: 18 to + 164). All patients survived and showed complete remission after a follow up of 7 to 20 months (median: 14 months). 1/5 patients developed GvHD grade I. Conclusion: This reduced intensity regimen allowed rapid and complete engraftment with very low toxicity in patients with HLH and LCH. This is also true for patients who received a CD3/19 depleted peripheral stem cell graft to avoid GvHD.",

Lang University Children`s Hospital (Tubingen, DE) We investigated a cohort of 11 pediatric patients with myelodysplatic syndrome transplanted with T-cell depleted grafts from haploidentical donors. 2 patients had refractory cytopenia, 5 patients had refractory cytopenia with excess blasts in transformation (REAB-T). 4 patients had relapsed MDS (RAEB-T) after a previous transplantation from a matched unrelated donor and received a 2nd allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) from a haploidentical donor. Median age was 7.7 years (1.7-18) . 6 patients received Busilvex/Cyclophosphamid/Melphalaned, 5 patients underwent a reduced intensity conditioning with Melphalane/Thiotepa and Fludarabine or Clofarabine. All patients received peripheral stem cells. In 7 patients Graft manipulation was carried out by direct depletion using antiCD3/ antiCD19 coated magnetic microbeads. 4 patients received CD34 positive selected stem cells. Median CD34 + progenitor cell content of the grafts was 13.6 \u00d7 10 6 /kg BW (4.6 -41 \u00d7 10 6 ), the median T-cell content of the grafts was 63.9 \u00d7 10 3 /kg BW (1.8-162.4 \u00d7 10 3 ) . Primary engraftment occured in 10 of 11 patients. 1 patient failed to engraft but could be rescued with a second stem cell donation from the same donor. 2 patients rejected the graft after primary engraftment. Both patients could be successfully retransplanted from a second parental donor. Thus, Final engraftment could be obtained in all patients. Median time to reach > 500 neutrophiles/microliter was 11 days (9-15). Independence from platelet substitution was reached after a median time of 10 days (7-18). No severe (>\u00b02) acute graft versus host disease (GvHD) was observed, 36% (4 out of 11) developed acute GvHD \u00b01-2 and 64% of the patients (7 out of 11) developed no acute GvHD at all. 2 out of 11 patients relapsed (19%), median time to relapse was 106 days. There was no transplant related mortality (TRM) within the fi rst 100 days after SCT. Over all TRM was 2 out of 11 patients (20%). Event free survival (EFS) was 64%. Conclusions: Fast recoveries of neutrophiles and platelets were achieved without occurrence of severe acute GvHD. TRM was low although more than 1/3 of the patients underwent intensive pretreatment according to previous allogeneic SCT. Low relapse rate let to a favourable event free survival. Thus, haploidentical SCT with T-cell depleted grafts is a save and effective treatment for MDS if no matched donor is available.",

Although a benefi cial impact of alloreactive NK cells has been reported increasing antitumor effect of NK cells may be helpful to improve clinical results. We developed a haploidentical \"parent/child\" in vitro model to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of donor derived IL2/IL15 stimulated NK cells against NB cells. Materials and methods: Six pairs of \"parent/child\" adult healthy donors were evaluated. NK cells were isolated from \"parent's\" donors using MACS separators Miltenyi Biotec (France). Enriched NK cells (CD56 + CD3-) were stimulated or not overnight by IL-2 (100 UI/ml), IL-15 (50 ng/ml) or IL-2 + IL-15 and used as effector cells. PBMCs of \"child's\" donors irradiated at 30 Grays (PBMC*) and contaminated with bis(acetoxymethyl) 2,2':6',2\"-terpyridine-6,6\"-dicarboxylate, (BATDA) labelled IMR-32 NB cell line were used as target cells. Different effector/target ratios were evaluated (10/1, 20/1, 50/1, 100/1). After incubation (2 hours at 37\u00b0C) of labelled IMR-32 cells with NK cells the TDA released from lysed cells into the supernatant is chelated with Eu3 +. The natural killer cell activity is then quantifi ed by measuring the intense fl uorescence of the EuTDA chelates formed: BATDA europium assay (Perkin Elmer, USA). NK cytotoxicity against IMR-32 cell line was also indirectly measured by quantitative RT-PCR for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA. HLA C (C1 and C2) and HLA B allotypes (Bw4) were determined for each \"parent/child\" couple using high resolution PCR sequence based typing. Results: Cytotoxic activity of NK cells measured by a timeresolved fl uorometric assay was correlated with decrease of TH transcripts number measured by RT-PCR (spearman test: ratio 100/1 p: 0.00015, ratio 50/1 p: 0.00012). Cytotoxicity of NK cells against IMR-32 was signifi cantly enhanced by pre-incubation with IL-2 or IL-15 (fi gure). IL-15 stimulated NK cells show particularly strong cytotoxicity. There was a trend of increased cytotoxicity in 3 cases with KIR mismatch (these results need confi rmation). Conclusion: The presented results provide a framework for constructing an in vitro model for evaluation of anti-neuroblastoma effect of NK cells. In clinical practice we use both techniques to evaluated/compared cytotoxicity against recipient PBMC* contaminated with IMR-32 of parental donor NK cells before transplant, at day + 30 and + 60 after transplant.",

Giordan, M. Pillon, M. Gazzola, R. Destro, S. Cesaro, M. Carli, G. Basso, C. Messina University of Padua (Padua, IT) Background: Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is currently used to treat acute and chronic graft-versus disease notresponsive to conventional therapy. ECP is believed to have an immunomodulatory effect and may do so by modulating DC function and induction of regulatory T cells (Treg). A signifi cant delay in the time to onset of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) has recently been reported for adult patients receiving preventive ECP, performed prior to myeloablative conditioning regimen. The use of preventive ECP in pediatrics has so far not been addressed. Objective: To evaluate the effi cacy and safety of preventive of ECP performed before a myeloablative conditioning regimen in pediatrics. Methods: Eleven pediatric patients receiving an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant were treated with conventional myeloablative conditioning (n = 8) or in addition with prophylactic ECP performed on two successive days before starting myeloablation (n = 3) and followed up until d100. The control group (n = 8) included fi ve transplants from matched unrelated donors and three from sibling donors, while the treatment group (n = 3) included two transplants from matched unrelated donors and one from sibling donor. Regulatory T cell frequency was estimated by FACS analysis before conditioning and, for ECP treated patients, before performing ECP, too. Results: Preventive ECP signifi cantly reduced the incidence of acute GVHD grade II-IV. While all patients in the control group developed acute GVHD grade II-IV, only two out of three treated patients experienced acute GvHD grade II-IV (P = 0.04338). No adverse effects were observed following preventive ECP. The relative size of Treg was increased after the second day of ECP in one sample with low size before treatment, while in two samples with higher basic frequency, Treg did not further increase. Conclusion: Extracorporeal photopheresis incorporated in the myeloablative conditioning regimen was not associated with major adverse effects. A statistically signifi cant reduction of the incidence of acute GVHD was observed. Albeit defi nitive conclusions cannot be drawn owing to the low size of the cohort, the preliminary results encourage to investigate the usefulness of preventive ECP as a remedy to reduce the incidence and/or severity of acute GvHD.",

            "text": "A pilot study of levetiracetam (Keppra\u00ae) for seizure prophylaxis in children receiving IV busulfan for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation S. Soni, M. Skeens, V. Pai, R. Bajwa, T. Gross, A. Termuhlen Nationwide Children's Hospital (Columbus, US) Background: For Busulfan (BU) administration, targeting a narrow therapeutic range is essential to balance toxicities and outcomes. Targeted AUC of 900-1500 microM/L, based on fi rst dose pharmacokinetics (PK) is utilized to assure dosimetry of intravenous (iv) BU. Phenytoin is also used for BU induced seizure prophylaxis in children. Phenytoin is a CYP3A, CYP1A2 and glutathione-S-transferase inducer and increases the clearance of BU. Hence,continued exposure to Phenytoin may actually lead to less BU exposure than targeted. Hence, anti-seizure prophylaxis with a drug that is not a hepatic enzyme inducer is needed for better BU dose assurance. We provide results of a pilot study of iv Levetiracetam use for seizure prophylaxis in pediatric patients. Objectives: 1. To monitor the feasibility, toxicity and effi cacy of Levetiracetam; and 2. To compare effi cacy, toxicity and outcomes with patients that had received Phenytoin. Methods: All patients received BU at an initial dose of 0.8 mg/ kg to 1mg/kg, subsequently adjusted to an AUC of 900-1500 microM/L based on fi rst dose PK. iv Levetiracetam was given at 10 mg/kg/dose (maximum: 500 mg/dose) infused over 15 minutes every 12 hours. First dose was administered 6 to 12 hours prior to start of BU and continued for 24 hours after the completion of BU. Data was retrospectively analyzed for seizure events and toxicity. In the control population, iv Fosphenytoin was administered as a loading dose (15 mg PE/kg), 12-24 hours before BU followed by age appropriate maintenance dose. Both the groups were retrospectively compared for toxicity, seizures, initial busulfan dose adjustments and outcomes. Results: 27 pediatric patients undergoing HSCT have received iv Levetiracetam. All patients have tolerated it well with no reports of adverse events or toxicity. The case control group that received iv Fosphenytoin (n = 20), was matched for age and type of HSCT. Two breakthrough seizures occurred in the Fosphenytoin group vs. none in the Levetiracetam group. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of adjustments required for BU levels; toxicity (similar incidence of mucositis and SOS) and overall outcomes. Conclusion: This is the fi rst report of administration of iv Levetiracetam as a single agent for seizure prophylaxis during HSCT. iv Levetiracetam is safe and effi cacious in preventing seizures. Further prospective trials of Levetiracetam with close monitoring of its effect on BU dose assurance are required.",

Gassas (2) (1)Rambam Medical Centre (Haifa, IL); (2) Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, CA) Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT) from HLA matched identical family donor is the treatment of choice for children with Severe Aplastic Anemia (SAA). In 70% of patients HLA-matched related donor is not available. For SAA patients who failed to respond to immunotherapy the only curative option is BMT from mached unrelated donor (MUD). Historically MUD BMT was associated with high mortality rates and high incidence of GVHD. We illustrate our 10 years pediatric experience of BMT for SAA patients in Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto) in period from 1998-2008. We retrospectively analyzed results of 59 pediatric patients with SAA (median age 10 years) who underwent BMT from related and unrelated donors. 38 children received related donor allograft and 18 had an unrelated donor or unrelated cord. In this study most patients had bone marrow graft. For prophylaxis GVHD, combination of Cyclosporin with Methotrexate or with Methylprednisolone were used. Conditioning regimen for the related donors included cyclophosphamide and antithymocyte globulin (ATG). For the unrelated, either a single dose total body irradiation (TBI) 200cGy or fl udarabine was added. 5-years Overall survival (OS) for whole group was 84%, but it was different in related and unrelated donor and showed 90% and 71% respectively. Incidence of Acute Graft Versus Disease (AGVHD) was 29% and grade 3-4 AGVHD -7%. OS for all patients with AGVHD was 82%, for patients with severe AGVHD -75% versus 90% without AGVHD. Incidence of Chronic Graft Versus Disease (CGVHD) was 14% and severe CGVHD -4%. Probability of survival among all patients with CGVHD was 80% and only 50% for children with severe GVHD. It was no statistically signifi cant difference between incidence of GVHD and conditioning regimen. In group of patients with grade 1-2 AGVHD it was no difference between related or unrelated donor, 54% and 46% respectively in comparison with grade 3-4 AGVHD -75% was after unrelated donor and 25% after related donor. 87% of children with CGVHD had previously symptoms of AGVHD. 75% of patients with CGVHD had full donor chimerism. The median duration of immunosuppression among patients with CGVHD was 434 days. Incidence of infection complications was high in patients with GVHD: 76% of patients with AGVHD and 87% with CGVHD developed different viral, bacterial or both infections. Incidence of fungal infection among patients with AGVHD and CGVHD was 35% and 62% respectively versus 26% in group without GVHD.",

From February 2008 to 2009, 10 patients received bu based preparative regimens. GST genotyping was done by multiplex polymerase chain reaction for GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTA1. Bu drug levels were taken (as per drug insert) to measure area under the curve (AUC) levels and analysed using high performance liquid chromatography. Eight patients (5 boys, 3 girls), median age 6 (range, 1-21) years were recruited, 1 patient was ineligible and another declined. Indications for BMT included acute myeloid leukaemia (N = 4), haemophagohistiolymphocytosis (N = 1), CD40 ligand defi ciency (N = 1) and transfusion-dependent thalassaemia major (N = 2). All patients received unrelated donor BMT (5 bone marrow, 1 peripheral blood stem cells, 2 cord blood). Preparative regimens included bu-cyclophosphamide (CPM) (N = 1), bu-CPM-fl udarabine (N = 2) and bu-fl udarabine-melphalan (N = 5). All patients received oral phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis. Myeloid engraftment occurred in all at median of 20 (range, 13-46) days. While all patients had hyperbilirubinemia, only 2 patients had moderately severe hepatic sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS) with complications. All had oral mucositis; none had seizures. One patient had secondary graft failure, successfully re-transplanted with same donor. All patients are alive and well at a median of 218 days (range, 85-441) days from BMT. Six of 8 patients had bu levels above the target range (900-1500 uM.min). Of the 8 patients, 6 had GSTM1 null and 3 had GSTT1 null mutations. Of those with mutations, 2 patients had double GSTM1 and GSTT1 null mutations. These 2 patients had toxic bu levels and SOS. Using standard weight-based bu dosing regimen designed to improve bu levels targeting without need for therapeutic drug monitoring and dose-adjustment for paediatric Asian patients, only \u00bc of our patients achieved target levels. This is in contrast to the experience in Europe where > 90% of patients achieves target levels. The observation that clinically signifi cant hepatic toxicity occurred only in patients who carry double GST null mutations is interesting and should be evaluated in a larger series.",

Borovkova, V. Vavilov, L. Zubarovskaya , B. Afanasyev SPb State I. Pavlov Medical University (St. Petersburg, RU) Background: Allogenic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) is effective approach of treatment for some inherited diseases but effi cacy of the usage of different conditioning regimen is controversial. Full intensity myeloablative conditioning is associated with a lot of early and late treatment related toxicity (TRT) that limits its usage especially in patients with advanced stage of disease. This conditioning regimen is connected with high level of treatment related mortality (TRM). Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens signifi cantly decreases development of different complications and reduces TRM. But this conditioning regimen is associated with increased frequency of graft failure or allograft rejection in inherited diseases. The aim of this study: To estimate effi cacy of RIC in patients (pts) with some inherited diseases. Patients: From May, 2006 to October, 2009 alloHSCT were performed in 6 pts with following diseases: 1pt -Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome, 1 pt -Krabbe disease, 1 pt -metachromatic leucodystrophy, 1 pt -x-linked adrenoleucodystrophy, 1 pt -malignant osteopetrosis, 1 pt -Diamond-Blackfan anemia; 3 boys, 3 girls, median age -4,8 year (from 1 to 14 y.o.). Conditioning regimen includes Fludarabine 150 mg/m 2 + Melphalan 140 mg/m 2 + ATGAM 60 mg/kg (\u00abPfi zer\u00bb) in 5 pts, 1 pt with Diamond -Blackfan anemia was transplanted by conditioning regimen Fludarabin 150 mg/m 2 + Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2 . Acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) prophylaxis was by CsA from D-1 and short course of MTX. Source of HSCT: 5 -PBSC, 1-BMT. Median CD34 + -6,8*10 6 /kg. Results: 2-years overall survival is 75%. Five pts are alive without any signs of disease with follow-up 2-43 months. One pt with metachromatic leucodystrophy died on D + 37 from CNS complication after alloHSCT. One pt with Diamond -Blackfan anemia was non-engrafted and received 2nd alloHSCT with MAC from the same donors. During RIC alloHSCT none patients developed severe toxicity (III-IV stage according WHO classifi cation). Four pts was engrafted on D + 14 (range D + 12-D + 19) with achievement of full donor chimerism on D + 30. Complications: Skin aGvHD II stage -in 3 pts, 1 pt had gut GvHD IV stage, which was successfully treated by steroids and monoclonal antibody therapy. Conclusion: RIC is effective in children with non-malignant inherited diseases, has low toxicity and is the promising alternative to myeloablative conditioning regimens.",

Vervat, A.G.S. van Halteren, R.M. Egeler, M.J.D. van Tol, L.M. Ball Leiden University Medical Center (Leiden, NL) Normal hematopoiesis relies on the functional integrity of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) within the bone marrow (BM), which may be dysregulated by malignant cell infi ltration. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a characterized by hematomorphological dysplasia, cytopenia, cytogenetic abnormalities and leukemic transformation. In children there is an overlap with the myeloproliferative syndromes, many of which are unique to the pediatric age group. The most common is Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia (JMML), a rare form of leukemia which only affects young infants. Marrow stromal defects have been reported in MDS and stromal/hematopoietic stem cell interactions may infl uence initiation and/or progression of MDS. We undertook phenotypical and functional analysis of BM derived ex vivo expanded MSC from children with JMML referred for HSCT, in order to determine if MSC differed from those from normal healthy pediatric donors. BM (10cc) was obtained according to an ethical committee approved protocol. Post-Ficoll separated MNCs were plated in plastic non-coated culture fl asks in Dulbecco modifi ed Eagle medium with Glutamax (DMEM; GiboBRL) supplemented with pen/strep (GibcoBRL) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany). Cultures were harvested at 80% confl uency, trypsinized (GibcoBRL) and maintained for up to 6 passages at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. The adherent cells were analyzed by fl ow cytometric analysis (positive: CD73, CD90, CD105; negative: CD3, CD31, CD34, CD45, CD86 HLA-DR). Expanded MSC were induced according to published methodology (1) into adipose and osteogenic lineages. Results of 4 children with JMML were compared to those of normal healthy pediatric controls. JMML patient details and results are summarized in Table I . Two patients with JMML showed aberrant mesodermal differentiation into adipose or osteogenic tissue. Interestingly, both patients showed no PTNP11, RAS or NF1 gene mutations. One harbored mutations in the region of 11q isodisomy (CBL gene). Both patients with abnormal MSC developed acute VOD and severe toxicity following conditioning which may be related to underlying abnormalities of stromal cells. Whether these abnormalities persist post HSCT requires investigation. To date no other reports of abnormal MSC function has been described in patients with JMML and further research is warranted to determine the signifi cance of these fi ndings in children undergoing HSCT. (1) In 't Anker PS et al. Haematologica 2003; 88: 845-852. representative material was available for review. Inclusion criteria were: younger than 13 yrs at donation. From 145 available samples, 39% were either clotted, marrow blood or insuffi cient for iron evaluation and considered not representative and therefore not included in the subsequent analysis. Review of the original reports was undertaken by a trained pediatric hemato morphologist in order to screen material for further detailed review. Aspirates were routinely stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin as well as for iron deposits, Together with blood smears and routine hematological values these were correlated with donor clinical details. Representative material was available from 88 donors, aged between 0.6 and 12 years (mean 6.8 yrs). Fifty donor aspirates revealed reduced iron stores defi ned as either absent (n = 17) reduced sideroblasts (n = 33). Six children had frank iron deficient anemia, whereas most children had low or iron stores with minimal peripheral blood hypochromia without frank anemia. Infants and pre pubertal children were more likely to have lower iron stores than children aged between 6-8 yrs.",

Other abnormalities included 6% white cell abnormalities, mainly undiagnosed hypereosinophilia, lymphocytosis and one case of leucopenia. Two donors had abnormal megakaryopoiesis, but with normal peripheral platelet counts.

Ahn Seoul National University College of Med (Seoul, KR) Growth factor administration to donors prior to bone marrow (BM) harvest results in enrichment of the graft for myeloid precursors and leads to early engraftment. A total of 41 patients received allogeneic transplantation from HLA-identical siblings, using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)stimulated BM. All donors received G-CSF 10 mcg/kg per day subcutaneously for 2 days prior to the harvest. The diseases of the patients were; aplastic anemia (n = 6), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 13), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 18), chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 2), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 1), and idiopathic myelofi brosis (n = 1). Conditioning regimens varied according to the disease status. The GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and prednisolone was given in all patients. In 18 transplants, the body weight of the donors was lower than the patients with median difference of 8.58 kg (range 1.1-29.8 kg) . The median number of the total nucleated cells infused was 8.4 \u00d7 10 8 /kg (range 3.93-23.5 \u00d7 10 8 /kg), and the median number of CD34 + cells infused was 3.74 \u00d7 10 6 / kg (range 0.33-31.9 \u00d7 10 6 /kg). The median number of days required for ANC to exceed 500/uL and 1,000/uL was 10 days (range 8-25 days) and 10 days (range 9-26 days), respectively. Spontaneous platelet recovery to more than 20,000/uL required a median 14 days (range 6-58 days). The overall survival and event free survival were 69.3% and 65.1%, respectively. Thirteen events occurred after transplantation resulting in; 9 relapses and 4 non-relapse-mortalities (Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia; 1, adenovirus pneumonia; 1, chronic GVHD; 2). Reversible acute GVHD occurred in 6 patients (Grade I; 4, II; 1, III; 1) and all transplantation-related toxicities were also reversible. Our results suggest that the use of cytokine-stimulated BM leads to a successful engraftment even in cases matched for leaner donors and allows reversible toxicities, and tolerable acute GVHD, hence providing a compatible alternative to conservative allo-BM and PBSC.",

Severe combined immunodefi ciency associated with this rare disease has been recently proven to be curable by allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). We present a 5-month-old infant with CHH who suffered from 2-months-long history of liver disease and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (gastroenteritis, encephalitis, retinitis). Genetic analysis of the RMRP gene showed in our patient and her brother with the same phenotype, a homozygous mutation (g. 252 T > G) that has not been reported before. Typical phenotype, severe combined immunodefi ciency and life threatening infections qualifi ed our patient for a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen SCT from HLA-identical unrelated donor to minimize the risk of severe toxic side effects. The conditioning regimen included fl udarabine (160 mg/m\u00b2), thiotepa (10 mg/kg), melphalan (140 mg/m\u00b2). Cyclosporine A, mycophenolate-mofetil and ATG were given for graft-versushost-disease (GvHD) prophylaxis. Hematological engraftment occurred on day + 9. Transplant-related toxicity consisted of orointestinal mucositis grade III, skin toxicity grade II and sepsis in aplasia. Prior to SCT CMV viraemia has been proven in the host (CMV PCR 10\u00b3/ml serum). Despite intensive antiviral treatment with gancyclovir (no resistance found), during immunosuppression CMV load increased in serum until maximum 105/ml. Since day + 10 CMV retinitis has progressed and additional uveitis and vitritis led to total bilateral amaurosis until day + 42 (evoked visual potentials not present). The donor serological status was anti-CMV IgG positive and as early as on day + 16 donor-derived CMV-specifi c CD8 lymphocytes were detected and increased rapidly in peripheral blood of the host. One-hundred-twenty days after transplantation the patient is alive, with 100% donor chimerism, no GvHD signs, spasticity after CMV encephalitis and bilateral amaurosis. The child still receives valgancyclovir and since day + 42 CMV has not been detected in peripheral blood any more.",

Kelemen Borsod University Hospital (Miskolc, HU) The safety and effi cacy of clofarabine-based condition regimen were evaluated in children with advanced acute lymphoblastic (ALL) and myeloblastic leukaemia (AML). Clofarabine, a next-generation deoxyadenosine analogue, was developed on the basis of experience with cladribine and fl udarabine in order to achieve higher effi cacy and avoid extramedullary toxicity. During the past decade this is the only drug granted approval for treatment of pediatric acute leukemia. In our institution over an 8 month period 6 children (2 AML and 4 ALL) with advanced acut leukaemia were transplanted with the use of clofarabinebased condition regimen. The median age was 7.05 years (4,5-11.5) . The condititon regimen consisted of clofarabine 50 mg/m\u00b2/d 4 days long, Busilvex 16 mg/tbwkg, Cyclophosphamid 120 mg/tbw kg and for unrelated HSCT Anti-Thymocyta Globulin 60 mg/tbwkg. GVHD profi laxis consisted of cyclosporin and methotrexate. This was a fi rst HSCT for 5 pts and a 2nd for one patient. Donors were HLA-matched siblings (N = 3) or HLA matched (N = 1) or mismatched unrelated donors (N = 2). All 6 pts engrafted. Toxicity of the myeloablative chemotherapy included elevation of hepatic transaminases in 5 of 6 patients with a normalization of all patients. No venoocclusiv disease was detected. With a follow-up of 4-11 mo (median 6.5 mo), 4 of 6 patients are alive, disease-free. 1 patient died of engraftment syndrome at day + 40 and 1 patient died of grade 4 gut GVHD caused multi organ failure at day + 100. Four patients developed acut GVHD. No chronic GVHD was detected. Clofarabine was well tolerated as part of a conditioning regimen for allogeneic transplantation. We detected no relapse of original disease. Immunosuppressive effects appeared to be similar to those of fl udarabine, Additional studies are warranted to evaluate whether clofarabine can contribute to reduce the risk of relapse in patients with advanced disease.",

Torres University Hospital Reina Sofi a (Cordoba, ES) Introduction: Invasive fungal infection (IFI) incur signifi cant morbidity and mortality among children undergone Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation (Allo-SCT) due to neutropenic phase and posterior immunosuppression. We have analyzed in this prospective study our experience in pediatric patients who received voriconazole as primary antifungal prophylaxis undergone Allo-SCT. Methods and patients: A total of 50 children and adolescents < 18 years were enrolled in this study from Oct-2004 to May-2009, median age was 9 years (range: 1-17). All patients received voriconazole at a dose of 5 mg/kg/12 hours (n = 23) or 7 mg/kg/12 hours (n = 28) until a highest dose of 200 mg/12 hours, from day -1 to day + 75 or later in patients with acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD). Patients were followed up for six months from Allo-SCT. IFI (proven or probable) was diagnosed according to EORTC/MSG criteria. Results: Only one (2%) patient developed IFI (Proven Aspergillosis) while prophylaxis with voriconazole and died due to it. In this series 32 (64%) patients completed successfully the treatment without adverse effects, no empirical or preemptive antifungal therapy neither IFI, in 29 of these 32 patients voriconazole was stopped on day + 75, in the rest 3 children, due to aGVHD, it was maintained until a mean day + 145. A total of 9 (18%) receptors needed an empirical (n = 7) or preemptive (n = 2) antifungal therapy, voriconazole was stopped and replaced with amphotericin B in patients under 14 years (n = 6) or caspofungine in patients between 14 and 17 years (n = 3) during neutropenia period. In 10 (20%) children was detected adverse effect due to voriconazole prophylaxis and needed a defi nitive withdrawal. The most frequently adverse effects due to this azole was persistent hepatic damage with cytolysis enzymes elevation > 2.5 basal levels in 7 (14%) children. Skin rash (n = 1), pancreatitis (n = 1) and tremor (n = 1) were the others secondary effects observed. All adverse effects were solved once stopped voriconazole. Conclusion: With an overall IFI incidence of 2%, our results suggest that primary antifungal prophylaxis in children undergone Allo-SCT with voriconazole is effective at reducing the incidence of IFI in this type of high risk pediatric patients. Voriconazole is well tolerated despite a high percentage of adverse effects easily solved by drug stopped without life-threatening complications.",

Urban Medical University of Graz (Graz, AT) Background: Treatment of choice for children with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a matched sibling donor (MSD) BMT; children without MSD receive combined immunosuppressive therapy (IST) and are eligible for alternative donor SCT as second line therapy in case of insuffi cient response to IST. Patients and methods: Between 1978 and 2009, 28 patients (m: f = 13:15 ; median age 11.0 years) were diagnosed with SAA. Causes were hepatitis (6), virus-infections (ParvoB19: 4; EBV: 2), febrile infections (4), drugs (3), pregnancy (1) ; no cause was identifi ed in 6 patients, one patient presented with constitutional disease. Primary stem cell transplantation from MSD was performed in 10 patients (\"SCT-group\"). Stem cell sources were bone marrow (BM: 9) and CD34 + selected peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC: 1). All patients received non-radiotherapy-based conditioning with cyclophosphamide; ATG was added in 4 patients. Graft-versus-host (GvH) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine A (6), methotrexate (2) or a combination of both (2). The remaining 18 patients received IST consisting of ATG, methylprednisolon and cyclosporine A (\"IST group\"). Results: In the SCT-group, 9/10 patients survive for a median of 12.7 years (4.8-31.5 years) ; one patient with perinatal asphyxia died 3.5 years after SCT of cardiac failure; 1 patient developed limited chronic GVHD. In the IST-group, 8/18 (44%) patients achieved complete remission (CR) after a median of 1.45 years (0.6-10.6 years) and survive for a median of 10.3 years (0.6-22.2 yrs) . Three patients in partial remission are still on IST; one patient died from hepatic failure 19 years after diagnosis. The 6 remaining patients not in CR were transplanted from alternative donors. (MUD: 4; mother: 1; UCB: 1) after different conditioning regimens; stem cell sources were CD34 + selected PSCS (5) and cord blood (1). Two patients rejected their grafts and required more than one SCT (2: n = 1; 3: n = 1). 5/6 patients survive for a median of 8 years after SCT (0.3-11.2 years) whereas one patient with chronic GvHD died of sepsis on day + 312. Conclusions: Over a period of more than 30 years, 25/28 (89,2%) patients diagnosed with SAA survive after IST and/or SCT. Primary MSD-SCT remains the best treatment option. Following IST, only 8/18 patients (44%) achieved complete remission with a long treatment duration and signifi cant morbidity; 6/18 (33%) required alternative-donor stem-cell transplantation as second-line therapy, 5 of whom survive.",

Urban Medical University of Graz (Graz, AT) Background: Stem cell grafts intended for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are usually collected and transfused \"fresh\". Data regarding the use of cryopreserved allografts are scarce and limited to adults. Patients and methods: We report on 4 pediatric patients aged 2.6, 1.75, 15.9 and 11.3 years, respectively (m:f = 1:3) suffering from relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia FAB M5, Mucopolysaccharidosis I Hurler, severe aplastic anemia and metastatic osteosarcoma, respectively, in whom conditioning had to be unexpectedly postponed at short notice for medical reasons (infections n = 3; non-remission n = 1). Stem cell donors (unrelated n = 3, HLA match: 10/12, 11/12, 12/12; haploidentical related n = 1) gave their consent to short time stem cell cryopreservation and graft manipulation. Stem cell grafts were manipulated (CD3/19 depletion: n = 4; additional CD34 + S273 selection: n = 2) and cryopreserved for 6, 13, 11 and 102 days, respectively. After conditioning with busulfan/ treosulfan-based (n = 2) or fl udarabine-based (n = 2) regimens patients received 10.55, 20.3, 12.9 and 15.37 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg together with 3.27 \u00d7 10 8 , 1.2, 0.55 and 1.0 \u00d7 10 5 CD3 + cells/kg, respectively, without relevant transfusion-related side-effects. Results: All patients showed sustained hematopoietic engraftment. One patient developed acute and chronic intestinal GVHD and died on day + 140 of Aspergillus pneumonia in remission of leukemia. The other three patients had an uneventful posttransplant course with a current follow-up of 138, 59 and 21 days without GVHD or other complications. Conclusions: Short-term cryopreservation of unrelated PBSC allografts in pediatric patients is possible for compelling medical or logistic reasons. The advantages of the use of cryopreserved grafts must be individually outweighed against the concerns raised but not defi nitely answered by the available data. In view of the increasing use of manipulated grafts short-term cryopreservation might be an option to ensure optimum graft and recipient conditions.",

Urban Medical University of Graz (Graz, AT) Background: In the absence of an HLA-identical donor haploidentical family donors are a useful alternative offering the advantage of being readily available for donation of stem cells and donor lymphocytes. Patients and methods: Since 1997 17 patients (m:f = 5:12; median age: 12.4 years; range: 3 months-24 years) underwent haploidentical stem cell transplantation (1 patient was retransplanted). In all patients there was an urgent indication for stem cell transplantation in the absence of a suitable unrelated donor. Diagnoses were hematological diseases in 8 patients (refractory AML: 2; HR-ALL: 2; SCID: 1; SAA: 1; ALPS: 1; relapsed Hodgkin's disease: 1); advanced/relapsed solid tumors in 8 patients (neuroblastoma:n = 3; osteosarcoma:n = 2; Ewing's sarcoma:n = 2; Wilms-tumor:n = 1) and Krabbe's disease:1. All patients were intensely pretreated, including highdose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell-support (n = 6). 15 patients received fl udarabine-based conditioning regimens, 1 patient received Bu/Cy, the SCID-patient was transplanted without conditioning. Stem cell donors were mother (n = 8), father (n = 8), brother (n = 1), sister (n = 1). In 6 donor-recipient-pairs a KIR.mismatch in GvHD-direction was identifi ed. Stem-cell sources were bone-marrow (n = 2) and peripheral blood stem cells (n = 16). Bone marrow was used unmanipulated; peripheral blood stem cells were CD34 + selected (n = 4), CD3/19 depleted (n = 1) or both (n = 11). Median number of CD34 + cells was 11.9 \u00d7 10 6 /kg (range 2.46-139 \u00d7 10 6 /kg). Results: All patients had complete 3-lineage engraftment; the patient suffering from Mb Krabbe rejected on day + 33 and was retransplanted from the other parent. Seven patients with malignant disease received donor lymphocyte infusions as adoptive immune therapy (n: 4-108). Twelve patients survive a median of 26 months (9-78 months; CR: 7, SD: 1; PR: 2, PD: 2). Five patients died of PD:1, GvHD:1, sepsis:1 and MOF: 3. Conclusions: Haploidentical stem cell transplantation with modern stem cell manipulation techniques and immunosuppressive therapy is a feasible alternative for patients without available HLA-identical donor and with urgent need of a stem cell transplant. The graft-versus-tumor/leukemia potential of this technique is currently under investigation.",

Serban (1) (1)University of Medicine and Pharmacy (Timisoara, RO); (2)Emergency Children's Hospital \" L. Turcanu\" (Timisoara, RO) Introduction: Refractory or multiple relapsed malignant lymphoproliferations continue to be a challenge for therapy and remain in many cases subject to palliative treatment. Objectives: Taking into account the particular status at transplantation of the patients with malignant lymphoproliferations, with multiple relapses or refractory disease, we aimed to evaluate the outcome of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in this category of patients. Patients and methods: This prospective study was performed on 77 patients, 43 with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), 20 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and 14 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) transplanted in our department between 2001 and 2009. The outcome was assessed by estimation of 5 years projected overall survival (pOS) and disease-free survival (pDFS). From the HL group, 72.7% were either in complete remission (CR) 3, 4 or 5 or in partial remission (PR) at the time of transplantation. For the NHL group, 25% of the patients were \u2265 CR2 and 15% in PR. From the group of patients with ALL, 42.8% were in > CR2 at the time of transplantation. Results: A subgroup of patients (63.5%) had consolidation or maintenance therapy after autologous transplantation: 44% had only chemo, 17% chemo-and radiotherapy, 2,5% had only radiotherapy. Despite the rather unfavorable pre-transplant condition of the patients, pOS was 79% in patients with HL and pDFS was 65%. For the group of patients with NHL, survival analysis revealed a pOS of 59% and a pDFS of 54%. Patients with ALL presented a pOS of 70% but a lower pDFS of only 47%. Conclusion: Our data reveals the fact that the indication for HSCT could be extended, being a life-saving procedure for malignant lymphoproliferations even in cases presenting refractory disease or multiple relapses. Consolidation or maintenance therapy may have an infl uence on the outcome.",

Kowalczyk Medical University of Lublin (Lublin, PL) Aim of the study: We evaluated the clinical results of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) performed in children with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) in one institution. Material and methods: Between 2000 and 2009 twenty three children suffering from SAA was referred to our center for transplantation. There were 15 boys and median age of the group was 9 years (range 8 months to 15 years). 14 patients were transplanted from match related donors (MRD) and alloHSCT was primary treatment of those patients, 7 children had match unrelated donors (MUD) and the procedure was introduced as a salvage therapy after failure of immunosuppressive therapy (IST). One patient was transplanted from haploidentical donor and one patient received sibling graft after IST. Results: 20/23 patients engrafted, 3/20 did not show engraftment (2 unrelated donor and one sibling donor after IST) and one boy was rescued by the second graft from the same unrelated donor. 3/20 patients (2 MUD and 1 MUD) after primary engraftment rejected their graft 2,3 and 22 months after alloHSCT and 2 of them were successfully re-transplanted from the same donor. Three patients died from transplant related complication: two girls died from multi-organ failure caused by infections (one before engraftment and one after re-trans-plantation) one girl died from lymphoproliferative disease which occurred after re-transplantation and IST failure. 20/23 children are alive and with sustained engraftment median 4 years after transplantation (range 0,5-9 years). All 14 children after transplantation performed as primary treatment are alive and well. 9/20 surviving patients have mixed chimerism and 1 boy has autologous recovery. Conclusion: Our results confi rms, that allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the best therapy for children with severe aplastic anemia. In our experience mixed chimerism does not impair the outcome of patients with SAA after transplantation.",

Basirpanah, A. Hoseini, O. Bakhti, A. Ghavamzadeh Hematology-Oncology and SCT Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences (Tehran, IR) Background: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative treatment for life-threatening malignant and nonmalignant diseases. However, only 30% of patients in need of a transplant will have such donors. For other patients, donors can be found in the extended family of the patient or in registries of unrelated donors or cord blood banks. Methods: To extend the use of allogeneic HSCT to patients without an HLA-matched sibling donor, we investigated HSCT from other related donors. During 2008 and 2009, an early search for a related donor in the extended family was performed for 108 patients who didn't have HLA matched sibling donors who referred to HSCT center. High resolution typing for class I and II alleles was completed for recipient/donor pairs. Twenty one children received a conditioning regimen based on the use of cyclophosphamide in combination with busulfan. The remaining 7 patients were transplanted with a fl udarabine based regimen. All patients were prepared for transplantation with antithymocyte globulin. The most common graft-versushost disease (GVHD) prophylaxis regimens used cyclosporine with methotrexate. Results: The search for an HLA-matched donor in the extended family was successful in 28 of 108 of the pediatric patients (26%) lacking a sibling donor. Twenty eight patients (age range: 1-15 years) with thalassemia major (n = 7), acute leukemia (n = 4), primary immunodefi ciency (n = 6), hereditary or acquired bone marrow failure (n = 8) and metabolic disorders (n = 3) were enrolled. Hematopoietic cells were collected from the bone marrow (n = 18) or peripheral blood (n = 10). The donors were either parents (n = 19), grandfather or grandmother (n = 4), and uncle or aunt (n = 5) of these patients. All the 28 patients engrafted with neutrophils (> 500/microL) at a median of 14.5 days and achieved complete donor chimerism (> 95%) 15 days after transplantation. Acute GVHD was present in 9 of 28 patients who engrafted (32%). TRM occurred in 1 patients (3.5%). Conclusion: While some countries may have very limited numbers of donor registries and cord blood banks, others will have many choices. On the other hand there is opportunity of fi nding other relative donors in some countries because of the marriage between relatives. Therefore, any transplant unit especially in countries that marriage between relatives is not forbidden has to evaluate for each single patient, all the possible alternatives to choose the best donor.",

Ghavamzadeh Hematology-Oncology and SCT Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences (Tehran, IR) Background: Although hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in children Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) has several side effects, this method is still being applied as a modality treatment within this age group. We retrospectively evaluated the results of myeloablative HSCT in pediatric CML after standardized pretreatment in the Hematology-Oncology and SCT Research Center, Tehran. Patients and methods: Fifteen consecutive pediatric patients (6 girls, 9 boys) with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph + ) CML received HLA-matched related marrow grafts between July 1991 and October 2009. Median age at HSCT was 12.5 years (range, 7-16 years). The graft source was bone marrow in 5 patients and peripheral blood stem cells in 10 patients. Conditioning regimen was: busulfan 4 mg/ m 2 /day for 4 days, and cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day for 2 days. Total body irradiation was not used. Cyclosporine and methotrexate were given for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Their response condition to the treatment was examined carefully. Results: All patients engrafted, (median, 18 days for an absolute neutrophil count > 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /l; median, 22 days for platelet count \u2265 20 \u00d7 10 9 /l). At median follow-up of 13 months (range: 3-136), 9 patients (60%) are well with complete donor chimerism and stable continuous molecular-genetic remission. One patient developed decrease in his chimerism. Series of chimerism studies over 1 year confi rmed that he has stable mixed chimerism. Other 5 patients developed relapse. Acute GVHD of grade II or more developed in 6 (67%) patients and chronic GVHD developed in 5 (33%) patients. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) at 1 year was 76% and 60% respectively. The median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery, intensity of acute and chronic GVHD and OS and DFS did not differ statistically between the peripheral blood and bone marrow transplantation groups. Conclusion: Findings indicated that the results of the treatment through HSCT in children suffering from CML are similar to those obtained for adults. But it leads to more DFS years in this age group. The results of the treatment did not differ across the two groups of patients divided by stem cell source. This might be due to the small number of patients in each group.",

Method (Procedure): The fi rst HDCT was administered with CTE regimen (carboplatin 500 mg/m 2 /day, day -8, -7, -6; thiotepa 300 mg/m 2 /day, day -5, -4, -3; etoposide 250 mg/m 2 / day, day -5, -4, -3). The second HDCT was administered with CM (cyclophosphamide 1,500 mg/m 2 /day, day -8, -7, -6, -5; mephalan 60 mg/m 2 /day, day -4, -3, -2). Results: 16 patients, OS rate ( \u00b1 standard error) at 3 years was 16% and EFS rate ( \u00b1 standard error) at 3 years was 25%. Among 13 patients who received single or tandem transplantations, 2 year OS rate after 1st HDCT in patients with HDCT and ASCT was 39% and 2 year EFS rate was 31%. Of the 13 transplantation patients, 7 patients received tandem transplantations and 6 patients received single transplantation. The number of each patient with pre-HDCT tumor status in CR, PR, SD, and PD were 2, 8, 2 and 1 respectively. The patients with SD or PD status before 1st HDCT all died with median survival period of 4 months (4~11). OS and EFS at 2 years after 1st HDCT were 50% and 25% in CR or PR at fi rst HDCT (P<0.001 and P = 0.26, respectively). In 8 patients received transplantation with PR status before 1st HDCT, 4 patients received tandem transplantation had 75% at 2 year survival, while the other 4 patients received single transplantation had no survival until 13 months. Total 8 patients who received tandem transplantation; 4 patients did in PR status before 1st HDCT, 3 patients in PD and one patient in SD status before 1st HDCT. 2 year overall survival rate of 4 patients received tandem transplantation in PR status is 75%, while 4 patients in PD or SD before 1st HDCT had no survival until 12 months. One patient died due to veno-occlusive disease during 13 episode of 1st HDCT but no TRM following second HDCT in all seven patients who underwent tandem transplantation. Conclusion: Tandem transplantation was relatively tolerable in the pediatric patients with relapsed brain tumor in children and helpful to the patients with PR status just before HDCT.",

Sanchez Zubieta (1) , E. Calderon (2) (1). Conditioning regimen included non-myoloablative as well as myeloablative regimens. Results: Mean age at time of transplantation was 5 years (range from 2 to 13). Infused CD34 cells/Kg ranged from 0.1 to 0.666. Engraftment was achieved in 10 patients, 3 patients had graft failure. Mean Neutrophil engraftment was achieved at day + 36, mean platelet recovery was at day + 41. Acute graft versus host disease was diagnosed in 5 engrafted patients, involving skin (stage 1 to 4), all were primary treated with methyl-prednisolone and resolved without further complications. At the mean time 9 patients are alive; 1 of them with secondary graft loss (ALL) and two with primary graft failure (LLA and MA). Four patients died, 2 of them from transplant related toxicity at days + 10 and + 27 (AML and FA), the third one died with loss of previous engraftment and active ALL, the last one with primary graft failure and active JMML. Conclusion: Mexico has a well organized public cord blood bank (accredited by Netcord and FACT certifi cation). Due to ethnical issues, especially that Mexicans are a race that has not been changing in the last 5 centuries; it is easy to fi nd a full or partial matched UCB unit in our bank. Although our serie is small, we found that UCBT is now affordable and promissory in developing countries for pediatric patients who do not have other suitable donor.",

Yesilipek Akdeniz University Faculty Of Medicine (Antalya, TR) Aim: To document haematopoetic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) activity and trends of a single pediatric transplantation center in a developing country. Patients and design: A retrospective analysis of data reported about haematopoetic stem cell transplantations performed in our center over 10 year period (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) . Main outcome measures were types of HSCT performed, transplant-related mortality(TRM), stem cell sources, indications for HSCT, causes of death after HSCT and survival after HSCT. Results: Over the period 1998-2008 with a minimum one year folow-up, 205 allogeneic procedures (87%) and 30 autologous (13%) HSCT procedures, totally 235 HSCT procedures were performed. Stem cells obtained from unrelated donors were used in about 20% of allogeneic transplants (42/205). Umbilical cord blood as a source of haemopoietic stem cells was used in 11% (n = 21) of all transplants. The most common indications for allogeneic HSCT were hemoglobinopathy (46%) and acute leukaemias (20%), meanwhile for autologous HSCT the most common indication was neuroblastoma (53%). TRM at 1 year after transplant was 37% for unrelated donor transplants, 14% for relative transplants and 30% for autologous transplants. The most common causes of deaths 1 year after HSCTs were infections (35%) and relapse or progression of underlying disease (23%). In the study period, overall survival of the whole group was 67% for fi ve years (95% CI: 60-74). The causes of deaths are shown in Table 1 . Comment: Haemopoietic stem cell transplantation has an important role in treating children with a range of malignant and non-malignant diseases. TRM for allogeneic transplants was compatible with literature, however in autologous group, it is higher than the literature reported for developed countries, because of the majority of advanced stage neuroblastoma patients. Detailed evaluation of patient selection should be done in this group.",

Bader (1) Several lines of evidence suggest that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) generated through plastic adherence (PA-MSCs) support the growth of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). However, so far there is no evidence about the potential of MSCs derived from positively selected CD271 + bone marrow mononuclear cells (CD271-MSCs) on the engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells in vivo. In the present study, we co-transplanted both types of GFP-transfected MSCs with CD133 + mobilized peripheral blood HSCs at the ratios 1:1 and 8:1 into knock-out NOD/SCID mice for gamma-chain of IL-2R. Fourteen weeks after co-transplantation the engraftment of CD133 + cells and organ distribution of MSCs was analyzed by fl ow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR. Cotransplantation of CD271-MSCs with CD133 + hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in NOD/SCID mice at a ratio of 8:1 promoted a signifi cantly greater lymphoid engraftment than PA-MSCs. They induced a 9-fold increase in the number of T-cells, a 2.5-fold increase in the number of NK-cells, and a 4-fold increase in the number of B-cells, indicating a major qualitative difference between these two MSC populations. Quantitative PCR analysis for the human albumin gene demonstrated that cotransplantation of CD271-MSCs or PA-MSCs with HSCs at a ratio of 1:1 induced their migration mainly to the brain. In contrast, when cotransplanted with HSCs at a ratio of 8:1, CD271-MSCs or PA-MSCs migrated mainly to the lungs and, to a much lesser extent, to the liver, brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. Distribution of MSCs was also analyzed by immunohistochemistry. These results, therefore, suggest that not only can MSCs infl uence HSC engraftment but also HSCs may affect the migration and homing pattern of MSCs in vivo depending on the cell number of MSCs cotransplanted intravenously. Taken together, our data suggest that CD271-MSCs signifi cantly improve the engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells and their lymphohematopoietic multilineage differentiation.",

Takeuchi (1) , M. Otsu (1) , E. Takeuchi (2) , M. Higashihara (2) , M. Abe (3) Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is useful for treatment of life-threatening, non-malignant disease. The procedures, however, inevitably involve substantial risks including, 1) conditioning toxicity, 2) graft rejection, 3) graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). To develop a safe and effective strategy, we have designed non-myeloablative regimen consisting of anti-CD40Ligand monoclonal antibody (aCD40LmAb)-based minimum conditioning with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT). X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (X-CGD) is a primary immunodefi ciency characterized by functional defects in phagocytes: affected cells are unable to kill microorganisms due to defective NADPH oxidase. Although allo-HSCT is considered a promising therapy for X-CGD, curative long-term reconstitution of granulocytes has not been established. Thus, we attempted our regimen as a promising treatment option for X-CGD mouse model. Methods: X-CGD F1 (H-2 b + d ) mice were received 20 \u00d7 10 6 of BCF1 (H-2 b + k ) bone marrow cells. 3 Gy TBI on day -1 and aCD40LmAb (2 mg) on day 0 to BMT was given. The degree of donor chimerism and functional reconstitution of granulocytes with production of specifi c reactive oxygen species (sROS) using APF fl uorescence staining in peripheral blood was followed by fl owcytometric analysis. Therapeutic effect was investigated using enhanced cutaneous infl ammatory reactions to subcutaneous injection of Aspergillus Fumigatus (AF) hyphae. Results: This strategy allowed induction of long-term (> 6 months), multi-lineage mixed chimerism (donor B cell; 62.9 \u00b1 19.1% at 24 wks) in 18 of 20 X-CGD mice. No clinical signs of GVHD were shown. Granulocytes with production of sROS were reconstituted in chimeric X-CGD mice (APF positive granulocytes ; 65.3 \u00b1 20.7% at 24 wks). Subcutaneous accumulation of granulocytes, appearing granulomatous formation to AF hyphae was apparent in non-chimeric X-CGD mice, while it was improved in chimeric X-CGD mice. Conclusion: aCD40LmAb-based minimum conditioning with allo-BMT is a promising treatment option for X-CGD without GVHD. This strategy may be applicable for other intractable disorders.",

K\u00f6gler (1) (1)University of Dusseldorf Medical School (Dusseldorf, DE); (2)German Cancer Research Center (Heidelberg, DE) Because of their high proliferation and differentiation potential, unrestricted somatic stem cells (USSC) from cord blood are promising candidates for future clinical appliance. Accordingly, these cells must be generated and cultivated in compliance with the strict requirements of GMP guidelines to ensure their maximum reliability and safety. In order to meet GMP conformity, fresh CB were processed by the automated cell processing system SEPAX (Biosafe) to isolate the mononucleated cell fraction (MNC). Following USSC generation, clinical-scale expansion was achieved by usage of multi-layer culture fl asks (CellSTACK, Costar/Corning) and products evaluated for infectious disease markers, pyrogen-and endotoxin-levels, immunophenotype, potency, genetic stability and sterility. To date, 19 USSC lines have been generated successfully under GMP conditions, reaching a mean cell count of 8.70 \u00b1 1.86*10 8 within 5 passages. Furthermore, GMP-grade USSC were tested for hematopoiesissupporting capacities in vitro and in vivo as well as for an eventual tumorgenicity. For in vitro co-culture, freshly isolated CD34 +cells from cord blood were seeded on 4 different, mytomycin C-treated USSC-lines as feeder layer, resulting in a 23.29 \u00b1 8.32fold mean expansion of total cells, a 3.11 \u00b1 1.29-fold expansion of CD34 + -cells and a 1.91 \u00b1 0.77-fold expansion of colony-forming units by day 14. In vivo, hematopoietic support was tested in cooperation with the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ, Heidelberg) by co-injection of USSC and CD34 + -cells versus CD34 + -cells alone in NOD-SCID mice. After 4 and 8 weeks, bone marrow, blood and spleen were tested by fl ow cytometry for human cells and showed a signifi cantly higher amount of human cells in mice supplemented with USSC versus CD34 +cells alone after 4 weeks (30.9% vs. 5 .9%, P = 0.004), but due to wider scatter no signifi cant difference after 8 weeks (24.2% vs. 1.3%, P = 0.112) . Finally, USSC were tested in NMRI nu/nu mice for tumorgenicity by subcutaneous injection of 0.5-1*10 7 cells. Aside from spontaneous development of murine tumors in 4 out of 30 mice, immunohistochemical staining against human nuclei showed no involvement of human cells. Taken together, these results prove that USSC can be easily produced in amounts and under conditions required for clinical application while showing no potential risk for the recipient.",

Treg recovery following allogeneic stem cell transplantation differs between conditioning regimen and is S277 not fully understood. Here we report on results of Treg recovery following a 2 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) conditioning regimen in a canine hematopoietic stem cell transplantation model. Methods: Recipients received a single dose of 2 Gy TBI at day 0 followed by infusion of Dog-leukocyte antigen (DLA) identical littermate bone marrow. Pre-and postgrafting immunosuppression consisted of different regimen: CSA/MMF (group 1, n = 3), CSA/RAD001 (group 2, n = 9) and CSA/MMF intra bone marrow transplantation (IBM-BMT, group 3, n = 6), respectively. Amounts of Treg within the peripheral mononuclear cells fraction (PBMC) was determined using fl ow cytometry and CD4/ CD25/Foxp3 staining at different timepoints (d0, d14, d28, d56, d91). In parallel, chimerism of PBMC and granulocytes were determined by PCR-analyses of polymorphic nucleotide repeats. Results: At day 0 Treg accounted for median 1% of all lymphocytes in group 1, for median 1.19% (range 0.51-3.67%) in group 2 and for 0.85% (range 0.61-1.44%) in group 3. At days 28 and 56 Treg accounted for median 0.36%, 0.81%, 1.19% as well as 0.51%, 0.87% 1.69% (groups 1,2,3, respectively). IBM-BMT dogs had at day 28 signifi cant higher Treg values in comparison to dogs receiving CSA/MMF (P = 0.01, t-test) and CSA/RAD001 (P = 0.03, t-test). This difference remained signifi cant at d + 56 in comparison to group 2 (P < 0.01), respectively. Day 56 engraftment in the PBMC compartment was 24.4%, 39.9% and 8.5% for groups 1-3, respectively. IBM-BMT dogs had signifi cantly lower donor PBMC and granulocyte chimerisms compared to groups 1 and 2 (P < 0.01, both). Conclusion: Recovery of Treg seems to be faster after intra bone marrow transplantation in combination CSA/MMF immunosuppression compared to intravenous BMT. Whether these higher Treg counts are responsible for the lower donor engraftment in the IBM-BMT group have to be investigated in further studies.",

Knueppel, D. Killian, S. Lange, A. Sekora, M. Freund, C. Junghanss University of Rostock (Rostock, DE) Background: The common injection sites for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation are the veins. Recent data suggest that intra-bone marrow transplantation (IBM-BMT) is feasible and allows faster engraftment compared to intravenous transplantation. This transplantation strategy has not applied in a canine transplantation model, yet. Here, we report on results from a cohort of DLA-identical siblings that received IBM-BMT following nonmyeloablative conditioning. Data is compared to historical controls that received i.v. BMT. Methods: Recipients received a single dose of 2 Gy total body irradiation at day 0 following IBM-BMT. Bone marrow of identical littermate was aspirated and peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) including hematopoietic stem cells were enriched by density gradient centrifugation. The grafts were then suspended in donors` serum for a fi nal volume of 5 ml. Transplantation was performed by IBM-application in the left humerus and femur over an application period of 3-4 minutes. Pre-and postgrafting immunosuppression consisted of a CSA/MMF regimen. Hematotoxicity was determined daily during early posttransplantation period and weekly later on. Analyses of chimerism was performed via polymorphic nucleotide repeat PCR-testing. Results: All IBM-BMT transplanted animals engrafted. Highest donor chimerisms in the PBMC and granulocytes compartments were median 21.4% (range 15.5-96%) and 39% (range 29-64.7%), respectively. Five of six animals had rejected their graft by day 91. One chimeric dog died at day 57 due to infection. Hema-totoxicity was signifi cantly more intense compared to historic controls with platelets < 50 GPT/l for median duration of 8 days and with leukocytes < 1.0 Gpt/l for median duration of 4 days. Conclusion: Intra bone marrow transplantation of enriched BMcells is feasible in the canine nonmyelobalative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation model. However, long term engraftment could so far not be achieved and hematotoxicity was signifi cant. Whether intra bone marrow transplantation of higher cell dosages improves results has to be investigated.",

            "text": "Availability of stem cell niches for bone marrow transplantation K. Forgacova, L. Sefc, J. Michalova, F. Savvulidi, E. Necas Charles University in Prague (Prague, CZ) Objectives: Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is a therapeutic procedure utilizing signifi cant regenerative potential of the hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). BMT is usually performed 0-2 days after pretransplantation conditioning. Our aim was to determine \"transplantation window\", i.e. for how long after conditioning are transplanted HSC able to engraft the microenvironmental niches of the recipient made available by conditioning. We also studied a possibility to \"close\" niches prematurely by a massive transplant. Methods: C57Bl/6 Ly5.2 and congenic Ly5.1 mice were used. Conditioning by total body irradiation (TBI) was from 60Co source and doses were 6 Gy (submyeloablative) or 9 Gy (ablative). With a delay of 1 up to 180 days the mice received a large congeneic transplant of 7 \u00d7 10 6 bone marrow (BM) cells. In the experiment aimed at a premature closure of the transplantation window, recipients exposed to 9 Gy were subsequently transplanted with syngeneic BM cells in a dose of about 40 \u00d7 10 6 cells for 5 consecutive days. On the 15th day after TBI they were transplanted with congeneic BM cells of about 20 \u00d7 10 6 cells given in a single dose. Resulting chimerism of the donor derived blood cells was evaluated from 1 to 6 months after the congeneic transplantation by using fl ow cytometry. Results: Both ablative and submyeloablative conditioning resulted in a high degree of congeneic donor chimerism. It was possible to transplant recipient mice with a delay exceeding 20 days after TBI. Thereafter the transplantation windows closed rather abruptly. There was a difference between submyeloablative and ablative conditioning regimens regarding engraftment of the short-term and the long-term repopulating cells. The massive repeated syngeneic transplant, delivered during fi rst fi ve days after ablative TBI, closed the transplantation windows effectively by day 15. Conclusion: Results correspond to a mechanistic view of haematopoietic niches that need to be \"opened\" before transplantation by a damage delivered to the BM. Transplantation window depends on the intensity of conditioning and remains \"opened\" for approximately three weeks. This would allow for fractionated, repeated or delayed BMT modalities.

Ballester, N. Grenier, J.F. Mayol, F. H\u00e9rodin IRBA-CRSSA (La Tronche, FR) The goal of this study was to set up a model of transient gene therapy in highly irradiated non human primate to determine whether a transient sonic hedgehog (Shh) expression in the stem cell niche could enhance hematopoietic recovery. We chose a gene therapy strategy to combine effi cient stimulation and reduction of side effects. Hedgehog signaling role in adult hematopoiesis is still debated. Hhh proteins binding to Ptch induces transduction through Smo. Antibodies to Hhh have been demonstrated to inhibit the cytokine-induced proliferation of human hematopoietic repopulating cells (Bhardwaj et al., 2001) . In addition transgenic mice (Ptch1 \u00b1 ) exhibiting an increased Shh activity have been shown to recover more rapidly than controls following myelosuppression and prolonged stimulation with Shh deplete the stem cell pool due to cell cycle acceleration. However recent mice studies shows that loss of Hhh signaling through conditional deletion of Smoothened (Smo) has no apparent effect on adult hematopoiesis (Hofmann et al., 2009 , Gao et al., 2009 . This suggests that hedgehog signaling could be dispensable for adult hematopoieisis. As Shh has also been demonstrated to favor neovascularization in other tissues (skin, myocardiac muscle), it may act on the microenvironment/vascular niche following irradiation, which would favor hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells activity. In the present study autologous or xenogeneic porcine adipocyte derived stem cells were used as vector cells and transduced using a piRES-2-Shh-eGFP plasmid and Nucleofector technology (Amaxa). In this model Shh protein was detected in vitro in the transduced cells during 1 to 5 days and was secreted during 1 to 3 days in accordance with our short term secretion strategy. About 0.5 \u00d7 10 6 autologous Shh-ASC were intrafemorally injected to each monkey (8.4 kg and 9 kg weight) the day after irradiation (whole body, frontal) at a dose inducing a severe and prolonged neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (8Gy 60Co gamma). In both monkeys, blood cell counts did not signifi cantly differ from irradiated control animals (n = 4). In addition the second animal was given a 5 \u00d7 10 6 xenogeneic graft on day 43 which was well tolerated. Further studies are required to validate the therapeutic tools and work is going on to improve the autologous graft size. Moreover, combining transient Shh overexpression at the niche level and systemic cytokine treatment may be required as suggested by in vitro studies.",

Lubatschowski (3) , I. Nolte (2) , A. Sekora (1) , M. Freund (1) V. (Hannover, DE) Background: High mobility group Box 1 (HMGB1) protein serves intracellular as DNA binding protein and has cytokine function if released. Recent studies suggest that it stimulates immune reactions and might therefore serve as adjuvant in vaccination as well as immunological cell therapy approaches. Here, we investigated the in vitro effects of HMGB1 on autologous and allogeneic immune responses in the canine model. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of dogs were used as responder cells in mixed leukocyte reactions (MLR). Stimulator cells were autologous and allogeneic PBMCs, hematopoietic stem cells (CD34 + ) and dendritic cells (DCs). Bi-as well as monodirectional MLRs were performed. HMGB1 was added at concentrations of 5, 10 and 25 ng/ml. Proliferation was determined by thymidin incooperation after 72h. Intracellular cytokine productions (TNFa, IFNg) of T-cells in response to HMGB1 (5, 10, 25, 50 ng/ml) \u00b1 leucocyte activation cocktail (LAC) were determined by fl ow cytometry. Results: As expected allogeneic compared to autologous stimulation was in general more potent to induce proliferation. Addition of HMGB1 did not signifi cantly enhance proliferation in MLR if PBMCs, CD34 + or DCs were used as stimulators. HMGB1 increased the proportion of TNFa producing T-cells in the MLR from 0.23% (control) to 0.33% (10 ng/ml) and 0.31% (25 ng/ml), respectively. The proportion of IFNg producing T-cells was not altered by HMGB1 addition if measured without LAC. After LAC, it seemed that proportion of IFNg producing T-cells increased with increasing HMGB1 doses (2.9% (control) vs. 4 .1% (50 ng/ml HMGB1)). Conclusion: HMGB1-protein at concentrations up to 25 ng/ml does not increase allogeneic immune responses, but seems to increase the proportion of TNFa and IFNg producing T-cells. If HMGB1 shall be used as adjuvants in vaccination experiments application of higher doses might be neccessary.",

Junghanss (1) Background: Dendritic cells (DCs) as antigen-presenting cells hold a key position between innate and adaptive immune system. With a high stimulatory potential, they are important vaccination tools in research. Here, we aimed at the investigation of the migration of DCs applicated at different sites in the canine model which has been a signifi cant preclinical transplantation model for decades. Methods: Canine bone marrow CD34 + stem cells were differentiated into DCs (media supplements: GM-CSF, FLT-3, TNFa, harvest day 14). The DCs were labeled with Technetium-99m (20 -253 MBq/injection) and reinjected (1 \u00d7 10 4 -1 \u00d7 10 6 DCs/injection). There were 3 different ways of application: subcutaneously into the groin (n = 4, GROUP 1), intravenously into the vena cephalica (n = 2, GROUP 2) and intraosseously into the bone marrow of the humerus (n = 2, GROUP 3). The migration of the Tc-99m-labeled DCs was detected by scintigraphy after 0h, 6h and 24 h. Results: The cell amount of 1 \u00d7 10 4 DCs/injection did not allow a suffi cient signal detection. An intense signal throughout all application forms and time points was detected with DC cell numbers \u2265 1 \u00d7 10 5 per injection. In GROUP 1 (sc): DCs migrated into the thyroid lobes and salivary glands as well as the lymphatic tissue of the intestinal tract; the spleen was an invariant destination; a strong DC signal remained at the injection site. In GROUP 2 (iv): DCs migrated into the liver, spleen as well as the lymphatic tissue of the intestinal tract. In GROUP 3 (bm): DCs stayed at the injection site (BM), and migrated to the lymphatic tissue of the intestinal tract, the spleen and the liver. In all groups DC migration to distant sites was observed as early as after 6 h. Conclusion: Technetium-99m labeling allows the observation of DC migration in the canine transplantation model with good sensitivity. For more sensitive migration investigation strategies such as nanoparticle marking are warranted. In dogs, DC migration varies depending on the injection site and might therefore infl uences specifi c immune responses. M. Giesen (1) , V. Lang (1) , E. Deak (1) , F. Ciuculescu (1) , E.

However, the repertoire of adhesion mechanisms operative in MSCs remains largely elusive. We asked which adhesion receptors are functional in human MSCs. Human MSCs were isolated from normal healthy donors and characterized using differentiation assays, fl ow cytometry, RT-PCR and in parallel plate fl ow chambers under shear stress, either preloaded with endothelial cells or recombinant ligands. Of the main selectin-type rolling receptors, MSCs did not detectybly express P-selectin glycoprotein ligand (PSGL)-1 or L-selectin, whereas CD44 which encodes an E-selectin ligand was highly expressed. Beta1 integrins expressed by MSCs comprised Very Late Antigens (VLA)-4 and -5, whereas beta 2 integrins LFA-1 and Mac1 were hardly found expressed. Chemokine receptors of both, the CCR family (CCR1, 5, 6, 7) and the CXCR family (CXCR1, 3, 4) were detected intracellularly and, in part, on the cell surface. In shear fl ow assays, MSCs showed comparable frequencies of arresting cells on activated endothelial cells as human CD34 + cells or blood lymphocytes at shear stresses between 0.1 and 2 dynes/cm\u00b2. Function-blocking antibody experiments and experiments on coated recombinant single ligands showed that E-and, but also P-selectin and VLA-4 can mediate interactions with MSCs. Resistance of MSCs to higher shear stresses of 5-15 dynes/cm\u00b2 was effi ciently induced by chemokines co-coated with the beta 1 integrin ligand Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule (VCAM)-1, but not with beta2 integrin ligands. Chemokines acting on MSCs were CCL 15/MIP5 (normally activating monocytes), CXCL8 (granulocytes), CXCL13/BLR (B-lymphocytes), CCL19/MIP-3beta, CCL20/MIP-3alpha T-lymphocytes) or the more ubiquitously acting CXCL12/SDF-1. Surprisingly, MSCs from different donors showed heterogeneous responses to these chemokines. MSC fi rm adhesion was blocked after pretreatment with pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of G alpha i and Rac inhibitor NSC23766, confi rming involvement of chemokine initiated G protein coupled receptor signalling in this response. In conclusion, MSCs show a unique profi le of adhesion receptor usage when binding endothelial ligands. In part, MSCs adhere with similar mechanisms and dynamics as hematopoietic cells, but display a pleiotropic chemokine receptor usage. These data provide a new basis for MSC graft engineering.",

Birner-Gruenberger, D. Strunk Medical University of Graz (Graz, AT) Endothelial colony-forming progenitor cells (ECFCs) are prototypic vessel wall-derived and circulating somatic progenitor cells which are considered to maintain the vascular integrity. Hypoxia in ischemic tissue seems to be a key factor driving the revascularization machinery. We therefore hypothesize that hypoxic conditions should amplify proliferation and function of ECFCs. Adult human ECFCs were isolated and propagated directly from whole venous blood using a novel recovery strategy. During cell culture, pooled human platelet lysate (pHPL) entirely replaced fetal bovine serum (FBS). We designated the oxygen level present in vivo in the venous environment at the site of ECFC harvest to be termed EUOXIA (41,5 \u00b1 3,4 mmHg) throughout this study because the term NORMOXIA has been used variably in the literature describing a wide spectrum of oxygen levels. Oxygen levels above EUOXIA are defi ned as HYPER-OXIA (air oxygen = 139.8 \u00b1 2.9 mmHg) and below EUOXIA as HYPOXIA (27.4 \u00b1 7.3 mmHg). Progenitor cell phenotype, hierarchy, long-term proliferation, wound repair as well as migratory and vasculogenic functions were monitored under EUOXIA as compared to hypoxic conditions or air oxygen levels commonly used in standard laboratory practice. Molecular regulation of cellular responses to different oxygen levels was assessed by fl ow cytometry and proteomic profi ling.",

However, the lack of a precise defi nition of the cells preparation and the heterogeneity of the obtained product render validation criteria of the fi nal product of the expansion. During the culturing procedures genetic changes can arise which can lead to long term consequences of complications of MSC transplantation. Aims: to estimate genetic stability (karyotype and aneuploid cell frequency) of MSC from healthy donors during ex vivo expansion. Methods: MSC (n = 70) were prepared by seeding bone marrow MNC in 75 cm\u00b2 fl asks in low glucose DMEM with 20% FCS. The adherent were passed every 7 days by trypsinization and replanting at the density of 0.5 \u00d7 10 6 cells/75 cm\u00b2 fl ask until the end of the culture. The immunophenotype of cells from early passages was: CD90 +, CD105 +, CD73 + and CD45-, CD31-, CD34-, CD133-, and remained stable up to late passages. Chromosomal preparations of MSC were prepared according to a standard protocol. The karyotype was analyzed by G-banding technique; 15-30 metaphase cells for each culture were analyzed. To analyze the level aneuploidy, fl uorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with chromosome enumeration probes (CEP) studies was performed. For each hybridized probe at least 1000 interphase nucleus were analyzed. Results: In all cases the karyotype of MSC during expansion were normal -46, XY or 46, XX and remain stabile. Disomy rate for 6 and 8 chromosomes in the MSC cultures was 98%, tetrasomy rate was 0,9% and did not change during cultivation. Monosomy rate for sex chrom osomes (X and Y) in the MSC cultures was higher then the rate of trisomy (P = 0,05). The rate of aneyploidy in MSC cultures did not change during cultivation. FISH-analysis of MSC revealed 3 samples with abnormal clones (1 with trisomy 8, and 2 with monosomy X). These clones arose on early passages and remained in cultures during expansion. Conclusions: During the culturing procedures chromosome abnormalities can arise which can lead to long term consequences of cell therapy. Further research is required concerning different passaging techniques and culture conditions to better understand their effects on MSC chromosomal stability.",

Kalmanti University of Crete (Heraklion, GR) Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) of bone marrow (BM) origin are part of the supportive microenviroment -the niche-of hemopoietic stem cells (HSC). The exact mechanism implicated in the interaction between HSC and the niche and the regulation of HSC self-renewal/differentiation, quiescence/proliferation are not fully clarifi ed. The aim of the study was the in vitro evaluation of the ex vivo expansion of cord blood (CB) or bone marrow CD34 + HSC in the presence of MSC used as a feeder layer, with the addition or not of different growth factor (GF) combinations. CD34 + HSC were obtained from either full term CB (n = 11) or BM (n = 5) of children with autoimmune idiopathic neutropenia and solid tumors. MSC isolated from the BM of the same pediatric patients (n = 16) were co-cultured with either BM-HSC or CB-HSC under different conditions with the addition or not of two GF combinations (GFmix1: SCF 10 ng/ml, IL-3 5 ng/ml, G-CSF 100 ng/ml, GM-CSF 1 ng/ml, and GFmix2: SCF 20 ng/ ml, TPO 25 ng/ml, IL-6 20 ng/ml, Flt-3 ligand 50 ng/ml). After 10 days of liquid culture, cells were immunophenotypically characterized, the CFU-GM and BFU-E development was assessed and total cell as well as CD34 + expansion were evaluated. The presence of both MSC and GF combinations resulted in the higher expansion of the total cell number and the CD34 + population. CD34 + cells and CD34 + CD33-as well as CD34 + 38-subpopulations, considered more primitive, expanded more effi ciently in the presence of MSC only. Higher total cell number and CD34 + cell expansion were observed in the CB-CD34 population compared to the BM-CD34 +, in the presence of both MSC and GF or GF only, independently of the GF combination applied. The co-culture of MSC and CB-CD34 resulted in the expansion of cells with greater clonogenic capacity as expressed by the ability CFU-GM and BFU-E colony development. No other signifi cant difference was observed in the various parameters examined. An effective stem cell harvest in the clinical setting of HSC transplantation, in many cases results unsuccessful and exvivo expansion of the HSC populations seems compulsory. Although growth factors effi ciently expand the number of total cells obtained, the presence of MSC may offer a promising, alternative ex-vivo expansion procedure for CB HSC, preserving a population with stem cell characteristics.",

Strunk Medical University of Graz (Graz, AT) Human multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are currently being tested in clinical trials for immunomodulatory and regenerative therapies. We and others have recently established MSC propagation with pooled human platelet lysate (pHPL) substituting fetal bovine serum (FBS). As serious doubts regarding the use of MSCs cultured with FBS and their possible genomic instability have arisen, we investigated safety aspects of short-and long-term cultures with FBS in comparison to pHPL. Unmanipulated bone marrow aspirates were seeded in alpha-MEM with pHPL. Clinical-scale expanded MSCs were harvested directly after primary culture (short-term). Representative cultures were continued for long-term expansions where each directly compared pHPL and FBS stimulation for a maximum of 46 to 51 population doublings until MSC proliferation ceased. Comparative genome hybridization (array-CGH) was carried out with short-as well as long-term expanded MSCs using a whole genome microarray platform and CGH analysis software. pHPL is highly effi cient in stimulating MSC expansion resulting in 780 \u00b1 150 million MSCs after one passage. Flow cytometry revealed more than 95% viability, more than 95% CD73/90/105 reactivity and less than 2% hematopoietic contamination. We could show adipo-/osteo-/chondrogenic differentiation potential, endotoxin levels below 0.025 EU/mL and negative bacterial/fungal/mycoplasma testing. In all shortterm MSC products, array-CGH revealed balanced genomic profi les. We detected several small copy number variations previously found in healthy individuals not associated with phenotype changes. In contrast, after long-term culture with FBS as well as pHPL, MSCs showed de novo copy number amplifi cations not reported in the database of genomic variants. Despite a high proliferation rate in the short-term pHPLdriven cultures, MSCs showed genomic stability according to array-CGH results. These data support our earlier fi ndings that MSCs expanded under humanized conditions did not form tumors in vivo in animal experiments. It is not clear whether in vitro genomic variations in long-term propagated MSCs under humanized as well as xenogeneic culture conditions may be associated with the risk of malignant transformation rather than representing replicative senescence. Therefore safety concerns have to be vigilantly addressed parallel to the clinical use of MSCs.",

Atkinson Mater Medical Research Institute (South Brisbane, AU) Haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is a curative treatment for a number of immunodefi ciencies and haematological malignancies. However, adequate supply of HSC from some donor tissues can limit its application. This may be overcome by expanding HSC prior to transfusion which has motivated numerous attempts at expansion processes in this area. We propose that it may be possible to expand HSC using co-culture techniques combined with advances in our understanding of the in vivo bone marrow niche. This study aimed to compare undifferentiated mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) to osteocytes differentiated from MSC as support monolayers to establish an artifi cial environment for the controlled expansion of HSC. Using basal medium, supplemented with fetal calf serum, murine HSC demonstrated a proliferative capacity on both these stromal monolayers, with no additional haematopoietic growth factors required. Compared to undifferentiated MSC co-culture, the osteocyte monolayer displayed a signifi cantly superior capacity for expanding both total nucleated haematopoietic cells as well as more primitive HSC, as defi ned by cell surface phenotyping. However, in both cases, a majority of the expanded cells were found to be committed to mature haematopoietic lineages. The quality and functional capacity of the cultured HSC was then tested in a murine competitive reconstitution assay. Upon transplantation, the cultured haematopoietic cells were capable of engrafting and repopulating lethally irradiated mice in both primary and secondary recipients at 16 weeks post-transplant. HSC co-cultured on MSC showed comparable reconstitution ability to that of freshly isolated HSC, whereas those co-cultured on osteocytes displayed a greater heterogeneity of outcomes. The reason for this is not clear, but we are currently determining if osteocytes injected into mice at the same time as expanded HSC interfere with HSC homing to bone marrow. These results demonstrate that stromal monolayers can be used to maintain functional HSC without the need for additional growth factors. This co-culture assay also presents a tool to determine further niche components that may be used to enhance ex vivo expansion of HSC. As such, the culture conditions for HSC expansion are now being further optimised and implemented into a scalable bioreactor device for controlled regulation of the HSC microenvironment.",

Echart (1) , G. Eissner (2) , E. Holler (3) Background: Defi brotide (DF) is a polydisperse mixture of 90% single-stranded polydeoxyribonucleotides with anti-thrombotic and anti-ischemic functions. DF has been recently showed to be effective in preventing hepatic VOD post SCT. We have previously reported that DF protects endothelial cells (HMEC) from Fludarabine (F-Ara)-induced programmed cell death. In this study we have investigated whether the anti-apoptotic activity of DF occurs at the transcriptional level. Methods: Microarray analyses of a human microvascular endothelial cell line (CDC.EU/HMEC-1) were carried out on Affymetrix chips and analyzed with Rank products. Cells had been stimulated in biological triplicates with F-Ara (10 \u03bcg/mL) and/or DF (100 \u03bcg/mL) for 6h and 24h, respectively, prior to RNA isolation. Functional verifi cation of the gene array results was done with ELISA, RT-PCR, cytometric bead arrays, and intracellular fl ow cytometry. Results: DF did not induce or reduce transcriptional activity of control HMEC after 6h or 24h to a signifi cant extent. However, when cells were co-triggered with F-Ara, DF inhibited a number of F-Ara-induced genes, especially those associated with a pro-apoptotic phenotype, as well as with migration and infl ammatory activation. In particular, among 732 differentially expressed genes (comparison DF + F-ara negative to F-Ara as baseline) showing a false discovery rate below 5%, Caspase 3 (apoptosis), IL-8 and Heparanase (migration and metastasis), and ICAM-1 (infl ammation) could be found. Cytometric bead arrays and fl ow cytometry linked the DF-mediated protection against F-Ara-induced cell death to the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Conclusion: DF protects endothelial cells against chemotherapy-induced cell death and activation at the transcriptional level by interfering with the extrinsic caspase cascade and by downregulating adhesion molecules and chemokines. DF also inhibits heparanase gene transcription and protein expression.",

Extensive propagation to yield enough MSCs for therapy may result in replicative senescence and thus hamper long term functionality in vivo. Highly variable proliferation rates of MSCs in the course of long-term expansions under varying culture conditions may already indicate different propensity for cellular senescence. We hypothesized that senescence-associated regulated genes differ in MSCs propagated under different culture conditions. Human bone marrow-derived MSCs were cultured either by a highly effi cient two-step protocol or by serial passaging in three different growth conditions. Culture media were either supplemented with fetal bovine serum in varying concentrations or pooled human platelet lysate. All MSC preparations revealed signifi cant gene expression changes upon long-term culture. Especially genes involved in cell differentiation, apoptosis and cell death were upregulated, whereas genes involved in mitosis and proliferation were down-regulated. Furthermore, overlapping senescence-associated gene expression changes were found in all MSC preparations. Long-term cell growth induced similar gene expression changes in MSCs independent of isolation and expansion conditions. A panel of genes will be presented that might offer a practicable approach to assess MSC quality with regard to the state of replicative senescence in advance of therapeutic application.",

Conley (1), R. Suzuki (2) (1)Community Hospital (Oklahoma City, US); (2)Spine Smith (Austin, US) Background and objectives: The MarrowXpress Platform (MXP) is intended for the preparation of stem cell concentrates from bone marrow aspirate at the point of care or in a laboratory setting. The system consists of a microprocessor-controlled, software-operated device with an optical sensor. The device is utilized with a dedicated disposable set consisting of multiple, sterile bags and a microprocessor-controlled valve to direct fl uid movement. The fl uid path within the disposable is sterile, non-pyrogenic and functionally closed. The system delivers an operator-selected volume of stem cell concentrate into the product bag in 40 minutes of total processing time. The goal of this study was to evaluate the ThermoGenesis MXP system concentration process of human bone marrow under intended use conditions. Methods: Bone marrow aspirate was collected in an operating room from patients using heparin and ACD-A as anticoagulants. Bone marrow aspirate (50 mL to 120 mL) was concentrated into a buffy coat fraction by the MXP process to a fi nal volume of 10 to 20 ml according to the target volume selected by the operator. Complete blood counts were measured using Sysmex XE-2100 cell counter for pre-MXP processed and post-MXP processed (cell product) samples. CD34 + cells and cell viability were measured by fl ow cytometry using StemKit (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). The cell recovery was calculated by dividing the total cell numbers in the fi nal product by the total cell numbers in pre-MXP processed bone marrow aspirate. Results: A total of twenty-fi ve bone marrow aspirates were processed and evaluated from September 1 to October 15, 2009. The cell counts for pre-MXP and post-MXP samples, cell enrichment factor and cell recovery are reported in the Table. The percent RBC depletion was 91.0 \u00b1 3.7% with a total packed RBC volume of 2.1 \u00b1 0.4mL remaining in the cell product. The percent cell viability was unchanged by the processing (91 \u00b1 3% vs. 93 \u00b1 5%). Conclusion: The MXP system was demonstrated to provide a reproducible method to volume reduce human bone marrow volume for the preparation of stem cell concentrates that are suitable for clinical use at the point of care. The stem cells and platelets were concentrated on average 5.9x and 4.3x , respectively above baseline by MXP processing.",

Gunel-Ozcan, E. Kilic, F. Aerts-Kaya, M. Cetin, D. Uckan Hacettepe University (Ankara, TR) Mesenchymal stem cells, or multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), isolated from various adult tissue sources have the capacities to self-renew and to differentiate into multiple lineages. Both of these processes are tightly regulated by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Emerging evidence indicates that the class of single-stranded noncoding RNAs known as microR-NAs also play a critical role in this process. Studies with various types of embryonic as well as adult stem cells indicate an intricate network of microRNAs regulating key transcription factors and other genes, which in turn determine cell fate. MicroRNAs are also found to be regulated by extracellular signaling pathways that are important for differentiation into specifi c tissues, suggesting that they play a role in specifying tissue identity. Objectives: Adipogenesis is the developmental process by which a multipotent mesenchymal stem cell differentiates into a mature adipocyte. This process involves a highly regulated and coordinated cascade of transcription factors that together lead to the establishment of the differentiated state. In our lab, it has been recently observed that mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) expanded from the bone marrows of infantile malignant osteopetrosis patients cannot differentiate to adipocytes (Uckan D et al., Cytotherapy, 2009) . In this study, we aimed to investigate the global miRNA profi le of bone marrow derived adult mesenchymal stem cells of infantile malignant osteopetrosis patients during their differantiation to adipocytes. Methods: Bone marrow derived MSCs were immunophenotyped. For adipogenic differantiation cells were transferred to induction media. Adipocytes were identifi ed by Oil red O staining. Quantitation of differantiation was calculated by Oil Red O extraction. miRNA was isolated from the cells by SABiosciences kit and cDNA fi rst strand synthesis was performed. Expression profi le of miRNAs was detected by using 'human whole genome qPCR miRNA array', which covers 376 of most abundant and well characterized miRNAs (SABiosciences). Results and conclusion: Our preliminary data from an osteopetrosis patient and a healthy bone marrow donor in the second day of adipogenic differantiation showed that fi fteen miRNAs were more than four fold differentially expressed in the patient's cells; two of them were upregulated and thirteen downregulated.",

Strunk (1) Clinical trials for therapeutic angiogenesis use blood-or marrowderived transplants containing endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), myelomonocytic cells and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to support vascular regeneration. Safety concerns have emerged since all three cell types can also contribute to athero-sclerosis. We therefore asked whether monocytes, EPCs or MSCs do in fact accumulate lipid droplets (LDs) and form foam cells in vitro as a surrogate marker for potential pro-atherogenic side effects of therapeutic angiogenesis. LD accumulation was quantifi ed by fl ow cytometry, confocal laser scanning microscopy and cholesterol measurement in each of the cell types following exposure to low density lipoprotein in vitro. The impact of an initial three-day pro-angiogenic culture on subsequent foam cell formation was studied to mimic a relevant setting already used in clinical trials. The phosphorylation state of intracellular signalling molecules in response to pro-angiogenic stimulation was determined to delineate the operative mechanisms and to establish a basis for interventional strategies. Foam cells developed from monocytes but not from EPCs or MSCs after pro-angiogenic induction. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 phosphorylation related to foam cell development and stress-induced stimuli was enhanced in monocytes after pro-angiogenic stimulation. MAPK p38 inhibition almost abrogated intracellular LD accumulation in vitro. These data raise serious concerns that cellular therapy with hematopoietic cell preparations containing monocytes may be counterproductive or even aggravate atherogenesis in patients with cardiovascular diseases. We therefore support the argumentation that the role of transplanted cells in the various aspects of vascular homeostasis, regeneration and therapeutic angiogenesis must be re-examined prior to further clinical trials.",

K\u00f6gler University of Dusseldorf Medical School (Dusseldorf, DE) Unrestricted somatic stem cells (USSC) are a defi ned CD34-, CD45-neonatal stem cell population derived from human umbilical cord blood (CB) with high expansion potential and the ability to differentiate into osteoblasts, neural and hepatic cells. USSC share many features with mesenchymal stroma cells (MSC), but are distinguishable by strong expression of DLK1 and, accordingly, by restricted adipogentic differentiation potential. DLK1 is referred to as a fetal tissue marker and is expressed in multiple embryonic tissues, but is undetectable in most adult tissues. Notably, DLK1 seems to be a specifi c marker for hepatoblastomas and is strongly expressed in hepato blasts of the embryonic and fetal liver. Arjang Ruhparwar and colleagues have analyzed the impact of transplanted USSC on liver regeneration by using a mature ovine model with acute liver ischemia: USSC were injected into the portal vein resulting in an engraftment into the liver-parenchyma as functional hepatocyte-like cells without fusion (A. Ruhparwar, in preparation) . With respect to in vitro differentiation, a three-stage culture protocol resembling embryonic developmental processes of hepatic endoderm was used. Hepatic pre-induction was achieved by ActivinA and FGF4, resulting in enhanced expression of SOX17 and FOXA2. Additional induction with RA, HGF, BMP2 and EGF resulted in simultaneous expression of FOXA2, GATA4, HEX and PROX1. For the subsequent hepatic differentiation HGF, FGF4 and OSM were used sequentially for up to 28 days. Differentiated USSC expressed the hepatic markers HSA, GYS2, G6PC, ARG1 and CYP3A4 as well as hepatic transcription factors such as HNF1a and HNF4a on day 28. Functional studies concerning albumin secretion, urea formation, and cytochrome-p450-3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme activity confi rmed the hepatocyte-like phenotype. In order to analyze the metabolic shift, cells were incubated with [1-13C] glucose. The fate of the molecule's label was traced by isotopomer analysis using 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), allowing detection of gluconeogenesis as well as glycogenesis metabolits. These results clearly show that USSC represent a stem cell source with a high hepatic differentiation capacity in vitro eligible for cell based therapies in future.

Bianchi-Melacrino-Morelli (Reggio Calabria, IT) The bone marrow contains hematopoietic cells that can generate the progenitors of blood cells including hematopoietic cells called mesenchymal cells, capable of regenerating tissues of mesenchymal type. This type of cells has a potential self-renewal and osteoblastic or chondrocityc or adipocytic or fi broblasts differentiation. For this reason, in our institution we treated patients with severe bone diseases that had failed conventional treatments. For all cases, we obtained the authorization to process by the local Ethics Committee. We treated 14 patients (8 males and 6 females) with median age 38 years (r. . The orthopedic defects were loss of bone, non union, bone cysts and bone lysis tumor in 6, 5, 2 and 1 case, respectively. The entire procedure takes place within a few hours and provides the collection of autologous platelets, the harvest of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMNC), its processing, orthopedic surgery to stabilize the bone lesion and, fi nally, the fi xture of BMNC on the lesion. The main characteristics of BMNC are shown below: median volume and median number of BMNC infused was 20 ml (r. 8-40) and 0.73 \u00d7 10 9 (r. 0.32-1,3), respectively. Briefl y, the procedure for laboratory manipulation of bone marrow consists of a centrifugation at 2000 rpmx for 10 minutes. The buffy coat formed is collected and mixed gently with autologous platelets, fragments of autologous bone and calcium chloride to the clot formation. Finally, the preparation is injected into the lesion during orthopedic surgery. No patient experienced postoperative infectious complications. Three patients were lost at orthopedic follow-up, three patients showed no improvement, whereas in 7 patients was documented complete functional recovery of the affected limb. One patient with micromolecular multiple myeloma and lytic lesion in the femoral bone was transplanted with autologous transplantation and then allogeneic transplantation from family HLA compatible donor. At 6 months, with a full donor chimerism she was started to surgical stabilization of pathologic fracture using BMNC. She showed a complete recovery in few months but, after two years, because of the progression of the disease, was observed a severe functional limitation of the limb. In conclusion, these preliminary data, despite the small number of cases, show that it is a safe procedure and effective given the severity of the diseases treated and the failure of conventional therapies.",

In our institution fresh BM stem cells have been injected within the lesion of 10 children affected by relapsed bone cysts. In two cases, with a suffi cient FU, the lesion resolved, while in 8 the lesions are resolving, but the FU is too short. Promising is the perspective use of decidual teeth pulp expanded mesenchimal stem cells of the affetcted children. Infact dental pulp has a high clonogenic potential in culture (251 fold the initial cell count). Moreover, on week 3-4 of culture, shows elevated expression of immature mesenchimal markers such as CD29, CD90, CD73, CD44. Moreover the expression of CD73 confi rms a high replicative potential capability as com-pared with BM cells, also tested in RT PCR. It is also possible to show how these cells differentiate into osteogenic precursors as demostrated by the positivity for Alizarine, opening the option to use these cells for therapeutic purposes. Telomerase activity up to the 21st week remains low. Therefore we studied three techniques of cryopreservation of the decidual teeth and demonstrated that only the directly cryopreserved pulp, as compared with cryopreserving the entire tooth or cryopreserving the predigested pulp, has a comparable dubling capability as the fresh pulp. This technique allows to minimally manipulate the dental pulp stem cells from the decidual teeth of children affected by bone cysts or cleft palate, so that they can be used for therapeutic purposes realizing an autologous regenerative procedure.",

Bellido-Casado, D. Valcarcel, A. Sureda, J. Briones, J. Delgado, M. Granell, S. Brunet, P. Casan, J. Sierra Hospital De La Santa Creu I Sant Pau (Barcelona, ES) The pre-transplant pulmonary function test (PFT) utility in predicting the development of post transplant respiratory complications (RespC) and mortality is not well established. We thus performed a retrospective study evaluating the predictive value of PFT in the setting of reduced intensity conditioning AlloHSCT recipients only (Allo-RIC). We retrospectively reviewed RespC in 195 consecutive patients who underwent allo-RIC, mainly based on fl udarabine 150 mg/m\u00b2 in combination with busulfan (Bu) 8-10 mg/kg or melphalan 7-140 mg/m\u00b2, at our center between 1999 and 2006. Patients were assessed for pulmonary function within 30 days before transplant by PFT, recording the following parameters; forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the fi rst second (FEV1), the FEV1/FVC ratio. Lung volumes included vital capacity, total lung capacity, residual volume, and the residual volume/total lung capacity ratio. Diffusion capacity was determined by using a carbon monoxide. Pulmonary dysfunction and severity were defi ned according to the recommendations (Chien JW., BMT 2005, 35, 429-435) . The median follow-up for survivors was 6 years (0.5 to 10 years). Results: 130 (66%) patients were found to have PFT abnormalities before transplant. Fifty-four (28%) patients had a reduction on the diffusion capacity, 41 (21%) had an obstructive pattern while 28 (14%) patients showed a restrictive pattern. Seven (3%) patients showed a mixed pattern. They were severe in 24 (12%) patients, moderate in 65 (33%) and mild in 38 patients (19%). Ninety-eight (50%) patients developed RespC (78 and 44 patients developed infectious and non-infectious RespC, respectively). The 6-years cumulative incidence of RespC was 45% (95% confi dence interval (CI): 38-53). Multivariate analysis (MVA) showed that RespC were signifi cantly higher in patients with abnormal pre-transplant PFT (hazard ratio (HR) 2.1, 95% CI: 1.3-3. 2) (P = 0.002), unrelated donor (HR 2.3, 95% CI: 1.3-3.9 ) (P = 0.003) and female-donor to malerecipients (HR 2.6, 95% CI: 1.6-4. 2) (P < 0.001). As well MVA showed abnormal pre-transplant PFT as a risk factor for 6-years NRM (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1-3) (P = 0.05). Six-years overall survival was 43% vs. 23%, for patients with normal and abnormal PFT respectively, (P = 0.001).",

Appelbaum (2) Objectives: Haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a potentially curative treatment for patients with haematologic malignancies. The therapeutic success of conventional myeloablative HCT regimens is limited by their associated rates of toxicity and nonrelapse mortality (NRM). Reduced intensity regimens have been used increasingly in patients considered at high risk for NRM. We present the results of the fi rst phase I/II trial conducted in the United States, which combined treosulfan and fl udarabine for patients with acute myeloid (AML) or lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) undergoing allogeneic HCT. Methods: Sixty-two patients with median age of 46 years (range 5-60), with AML in fi rst remission (n = 26), AML in second remission (n = 9), AML in refractory relapse (n = 9), ALL in second remission (n = 5) or MDS (n = 13) were enrolled. Ten patients were younger than 18 years at the time of HCT. The majority of patients were considered at high risk for nonrelapse mortality (NRM). Patients received treosulfan 12 g/m 2 /day (fi rst 5 patients) or 14 g/m 2 /day (n = 57) on days -6 to -4, and fl udarabine (30 mg/kg/day) on days -6 to -2, followed by matched sibling (n = 30) or unrelated donor (n = 32), bone marrow (n = 7) or peripheral blood stem cell (n = 52) transplantation. Graft-versushost disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was with tacrolimus (n = 56) or cyclosporine (n = 3) and methotrexate; 3 patients received cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil. Results: Neutrophil engraftment was seen in all patients at a median of 18 days (range 11-26). Complete donor T-cell and myeloid cell chimerism (i.e., more than 95% CD3 and CD33 cells of donor origin) was achieved by day 100 in 85% and 97% of patients, respectively. Acute GVHD of grades II-IV and chronic GVHD occurred in 55% and 50%, respectively. Severe toxicity was noted in 2 patients (3%) and consisted of mucositis and acute renal failure, both of which resolved. The estimated NRM at 100 days and 2 years were 5% and 8%. The 2-year overall and relapse-free survival were 65% and 58%. The 2-year estimates of relapse were 15% for patients with MDS, 34% for AML in fi rst remission, 50% for AML or ALL beyond fi rst remission and 63% for AML in refractory relapse. Conclusion: We conclude that a regimen of treosulfan and fl udarabine is well tolerated, resulting in low rates of toxicity and NRM and adequate disease control in patients with acute leukaemia and MDS.",

Chakraverty, A. Fielding, P. Kottaridis, M. Roughton, E. Morris, A. Goldstone, D. Linch, P. Ell University College London (London, UK) The prognostic role of PET scanning pre-and post-reduced intensity allogeneic SCT for lymphoma is unknown. We prospectively investigated: 1) whether the pre-transplant PET status was predictive of outcome in patients undergoing reduced intensity allogeneic SCT for lymphoma, and 2) whether posttransplant PET imaging would lead to earlier detection of relapse when compared to standard CT scans, thereby potentially allowing earlier use of DLI. Eighty patients with lymphoma have a median follow-up of 45 months. Paired CT and PET scans which were performed pre-transplant, then at 3, 6, 9, 15, 24 and 36 months post SCT. Patients were eligible to receive DLI \u00b1 chemotherapy if there was evidence of relapse, assessed either clinically, by CT or by PET. All patients were conditioned with an alemtuzumab based conditioning regimen. Pretransplant, 38 patients were PET negative and 42 were PET positive. There were no signifi cant differences in patient characteristics between the PET negative and PET positive groups (Table) . There were no signifi cant differences in non-relapse mortality between the two groups. Following transplant, 7 had progressive disease and 21 relapsed during follow-up -15/28 were PET positive pre-transplant. There was no difference in the relapse rate, overall survival, PFS and current PFS between the 2 groups (Figure) . Thirty-four episodes of progression/relapse were observed in 28 different patients. In 17 of these, the diagnosis was made using PET alone, i.e. PET + /CT-, There were 13 episodes where both modalities were positive, and 4 where both were initially negative. Nineteen patients had residual abnormalities on CT post-transplant, with a normal simultaneous PET. None of these patients received anti-lymphomatous therapy and only 4 of 19 patients with PET negative residual masses observed on CT post-transplant subsequently relapsed within these masses. These fi ndings suggest that in contrast to autologous SCT, allogeneic transplantation may result in good outcomes for patients with lymphoma, regardless of pretransplant PET status. Post-transplant surveillance by PET may facilitate earlier administration of DLI in some patients with recurrent lymphoma, and withholding of potentially harmful DLI in those with PET negative masses on CT scans.",

Buzyn (14) (1)Hopital Pitie Salpetriere (Paris, FR); (2) The use of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) associates with higher risk of chronic graft versus host disease (GvHD) but may favor a greater graft versus leukemia (GvL) effect. Objective: We proposed to evaluate the role of various parameters including the source of stem cells (SC) on the outcome in the context of HSCT from unrelated donors (UD), because the balance between GvH and GvL may differ from the context of sibling donors and thus the use of PBSC may be deleterious. Methods: We analyzed retrospectively 103 patients from the french registry who received a graft from an UD after a reduced intensity conditioning regimen (RIC). 69% D/R pairs were 10/10 HLA match at the allelic level. Mismatches concerned 5, 6, 15, 2 and 7 D/R pairs for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1 and -DQB1, respectively. The median age was 46 years (18-67). Diagnosis were: AL (n = 35), MM (n = 18), CLL (n = 5), NHL (n = 11), HD (n = 9), CML (n = 12), MDS (n = 9), and MPS (n = 4). 39% of patients were in an advanced phase of the disease at time of HSCT. RIC was Fluda/TBI 2Gys (n = 26), Bu/Fluda/ATG (n = 24), Fluda/Melph (n = 16) and other for 37 patients. Anti-thymocytes globulins (ATG) were part of the RIC for 77% of patients. The source of SC was PBSC for 65 patients and bone marrow (BM) for 38 patients. The median follow up of the cohort is 61,3 months (1,2-113,7). Results: 95% of patients engrafted. Five patients did not engraft (4 in the BM group and 1 in the PBSC group). Acute GvHD grade 2-4 and grade 3/4 occurred in 47% and 19% of patients, respectively. The risk of developing chronic GvHD was 49% at 2 years. Overall survival (OS) was 36% at 5 years. The median DFS was 55 months among the 36 patients alive. We performed univariate and multivariate analysis of factors susceptible to impact on GvHD and survival. The multivariate analysis included the impact of HLA mismatch, disease status, diagnosis, source of SC, patient's and donor's ages. The multivariate analysis performed on the global population shows a trend towards an improved OS with the use of BM instead of PBSC. When focusing the multivariate analysis on the 71 patients transplanted with a 10/10 match UD, the most potent factor infl uencing the outcome is the use of BM which is associated with an improved OS (P = 0.03) and DFS (P = 0.02). Conclusion: These results suggest that the use of BM as the source of SC should be reconsidered in the context of matched UD after RIC transplantation.",

Allen, P. del Cerro, L. Schroeder, A. Artz University of Chicago (Chicago, US) The fl udarabine melphalan-alemtuzumab combination is a well tolerated reduced intensity conditioning regimen for HCT. Unfortunately recurrence rates are high, particularly for those with active disease entering HCT. Clofarabine (Clo), a second generation nucleoside analog with excellent activity in acute leukemia, might enhance disease control. We are conducting a phase II study of clofarabine-melphalan and alemtuzumab (CMA) in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies and have accrued 45 patients, median age 54 (21-73). 19 had siblings and 25 had unrelated donors. 25 had acute leukemia/ MDS, 16 NHL, 2 CLL, 2 MPD. ASBMT risk score was high in 16, intermediate in 15 and low in 14. The phase II dose was initially set at Clo 40 mg/m 2 /day \u00d7 5 days and melphalan 140 mg/m 2 and twenty four pts received this dose. Because of occasional renal toxicity the dose of clofarabine was subsequently reduced to 30 mg/m 2 . We compared the outcomes of patients receiving CMA with that of a historical control group of 172 pts receiving FMA and identical supportive care. Pt and disease characteristics of the FMA group were similar to the FMA group, but median follow up was longer. At day 100, full donor chimerism in peripheral blood T-lymphocytes was observed more frequently after CMA than after FMA (72% vs. 41%, P = 0.02) suggesting more potent immunosuppression by CMA. With a median follow up of 12 months, progression free survival after CMA was equivalent to that after FMA at approximately 60%. Outcomes for myeloid malignancies and for lymphoma are illustrated below. Conclusions: CMA is overall well tolerated, is more immunosuppressive than FMA and can induce durable remissions after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Long term outcomes are at least equivalent to those of FMA. The study continues accrual. Supported by an unrestricted grant from Genzyme Inc.",

Moreau (1) Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) reactivation is a recognized complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Since EBV-related lymphoprolipherative disease (LPD) is associated with high mortality, pre-emptive anti EBV treatment with rituximab is now regularly used in this setting. The aim of this single centre study was to assess incidence, kinetics and predictive factors of EBV reactivation and LPD in 175 consecutive patients undergoing reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allo-SCT between January 2005 and June 2009. In this series, the median age was 56 (range, 18-71) years. 49% of the patients had a myeloid malignancy, while 49% had a lymphoid malignancy, and 2% had sAA. 83% were considered as having high risk disease. PBSC were used in 94% of cases. Donors were matched related siblings in 48% of cases, matched-unrelated in 46% and mismatched-unrelated donors in 6%. 106 patients (61%) received a fl udarabine-busulfan-ATG RIC regimen, while 21% received fl udarabine and low dose TBI. The remaining 32 patients received different chemotherapybased RIC regimens. Patients were screened weekly for EBV reactivation by DNA-PCR until recovery of the circulating CD4 + cells count (usually > 0.3 \u00d7 10 9 ). EBV reactivation was defi ned as viremia of 1000 EBV-DNA copies/105 cells. Patients with EBV reactivation were pre-emptively treated with rituximab.",

Tilanus (2) , N. van Geloven (3) , L. F. Verdonck (4) , C. Huisman (5) Background: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the innate immunity receptor NOD2/CARD15 have been demonstrated to modulate the outcome of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The effect of the NOD2/CARD15 polymorphism seems to be associated with donor source as well as type of conditioning regimen. Methods: We reviewed NOD2/CARD15 mutations in all donor/ recipient pairs of 192 consecutive patients who received a nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) at our institution between 2002 and 2006. All patients were treated with fl udarabine 30 mg/m\u00b2/day for 3 days followed by 200 cGy TBI (n = 154) or TBI alone (n = 38) and received grafts from HLA-matched related (n = 132) or unrelated (n = 61) donors. Results: Mutated NOD2/CARD15 alleles were observed in 36 of 192 (19%) patients and in 35 of 192 (18%) donors. These SNPs, however, did not have a signifi cant impact on clinical outcome (P > 0.05, Kaplan Meier and Fine & Gray's test). Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred in 24 of 61 (39%) patients with and in 65 of 131 (50%) patients without NOD2/ CARD15 SNPs. The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 51% versus 64% in patients with variant versus wild type NOD2/CARD15 alleles. Relapse was seen in 23 of 61 (38%) patients with the NOD2/CARD15 variants and in 48 of 131 (37%) wild type patients. The incidence of transplant-related mortality was 21% in both groups. Finally, overall survival was 43% (26/61) in patients with and 39% (51/131) in patients without NOD2/CARD15 SNPs. Conclusion: These data indicate that mutations in the NOD2/ CARD15 gene do not infl uence the clinical outcome of nonmyeloablative allogeneic SCT directly. Since NOD2/CARD15 variants are not recognized as a single signifi cant prognostic factor, screening for NOD2/CARD15 when selecting a donor does not seem to have additional value in patients undergoing non-myeloablative SCT.",

Blaise Institut Paoli Calmettes (Marseille, FR) Background: Busulfan-based reduced-intensity regimen (RIC) was widely used in the Allogeneic setting, showing good safety profi le and effi cacy. The intravenous formulation, Busilvex, is considered a forward step compared to oral form because of reproducible biodisponibility and pharmacokinetic. In this study, we evaluated the toxic profi le and clinical effi cacy of a busilvexbased RIC. Patients and methods: Since 2005, 78 patients received a uniform RIC consisting of busilvex 3.2 mg/kg/day for 2 days, Fludarabine 40 mg/m\u00b2/days for 5 days, and thymoglobulin 2.5 mg/kg/day for 2 days. Cyclosporine was used as post-graft immunesuppression. The median age was 58 years (24-70), and 41% of patients suffered from acute myeloid leukemia. 81% were in complete or partial remission before RIC. Donor was a HLA identical sibling for 64% of patients. All donors were mobilized with G-CSP and then harvested. 43% of patients received previous high dose chemotherapy. Results: The median follow-up was 16 months (2-51). No patients developed venocclusive disease (VOD). The cumulative incidence (CI) for grade II-IV acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) was 31%, and for extensive chronic GVHD was 25%. Overall 9 pts died from TRM for a 2 year CI of 16% (8-28). In addition, 18 pts relapsed or progressed for a 2 year CI of relapse progression of 30% (17-48). Overall the 2-y overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) probabilities were respectively 71% (56-82) and 58% (42-72).",

Ahmed (1) , M. Davies (2) , D. Marks (3) , S. Denovan (1), A. Fielding (1), R. Chakraverty (1) , S. Mackinnon (1), P.D. Kottaridis (1) (1)Royal Free Hospital (London, UK); (2)University College London Hospitals NHS Trust (London, UK); (3)University of Bristol (Bristol, UK) Introduction: Loss of fertility, is a major side-effect and cause for concern in patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation. Fully myeloablative regimes are more likely to render females nonfertile. Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) transplants causes less toxicity and may cause a lower incidence of subfertility, as we have previously reported. We have identifi ed 5 female patients who had preserved fertility prior to transplantation who maintained this post transplant. Methods: We retrospectively collected data on female patients who were being followed up in the late effects clinic and had i) maintained menstruation, ii) normal LH, FSH and oestradiol levels, iii) radiological evidence of ovarian follicles and/or iv) went on to conceive. Patient characteristics: Our data base includes 46 patients of reproductive age who underwent a RIC for haematological malignancies. Forty one out of 46 were infertile prior to the transplant and remained so and after the transplant. Of the 5 patients who had preserved fertility, the median age was 27 years (range 19-35). Diagnoses were Hodgkin Lymphoma (2), MDS (2) , and severe aplastic anaemia (1). One of the HL patients had previously received 4 lines of therapy including an autograft; the other had received previous ABVD and ESHAP. Of the MDS patients, one received ALG and ATG for hypoplastic MDS, and the other received chemotherapy including FLAG-Ida. The patients received either a sibling allograft (n = 1) or matched unrelated donor transplant (n = 4) with reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) which consisted of fl u/mel/CAMPATH (2 pts), fl u/tresulfan/CAMPATH (1 pt), fl u/mel (1), fl u/cyclo/CAM-PATH (1 pt). Of these 5 patients, 2 patients went on to become pregnant. Of the remaining 3 patients, all 3 had post transplant menstruation and relative preservation of ovarian function as evidenced by LH, FSH and oestradiol. Two of these patients had an ultrasound showing presence of ovarian follicles. Conclusions: We report on 5 female patients who underwent RIC transplants for various haematological disorders who had physiological features of maintained fertility prior to and after the transplant. Interestingly, our RIC Flu/Mel/ \u00b1 Campath regime seems to preserve fertility in all 3 females who were fertile prior the transplant and preserved their fertility after the procedure. This is an important consideration in counselling female patients for whom loss of fertility is a major concern.",

Toffoletti, F. Patriarca, A. Sperotto, R. Gallina, A. Chiarvesio, A. Michelutti, M. Cavallin, M.L. Battista, F. Zaja, R. Fanin Hematological Division of Udine (Udine, IT) Objectives: This study investigated the kinetics of whole peripheral blood (PB) and CD3 + T-cells chimerism in patients receiving reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). The T-cell chimerism has been correlated with risk of grade II-IV acute graft-versus host disease (GvHD) and relapse. Materials and methods: Forty-nine patients with a median age of 57 years (range 17-69) affected by lymphoma (27), multiple myeloma (11), acute myeloid leukaemia (9), idiopathic myelofibrosis (1) or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (1) (27), 2 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) plus fl udarabine (3), melphalan plus fl udarabine (7), total lymphoid irradiation (1), others (10). In 31 cases anti-thymocyte globulin was used as part of GVHD prophylaxis. Hematopoietic chimerism has been serially assessed at 30, 60, 90 and 180 days after SCT in whole PB and sorted CD3 + T-cells. The analysis have been performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based amplifi cation of short tandem repeats (STR) sequences using the Ampfl STR identifl er kit (Applied Biosystems). Results: All patients reached engraftment at day + 30 and at day 180 all fractions were 100% donor. The mean percentage of recipient cells in CD3 + T-cells was always lower at 30, 60 and 90 days in patients with aGvHD in comparison with patients without aGvHD. Patients who subsequently relapsed had a signifi cant lower incidence of CD3 + FDC at day 30 (55% vs. 87%, P = 0.07), at day 60 (50% vs. 88%, P = 0.03) and at day 90 (66% vs. 100%, P = 0.01) in comparison with patients with sustained remission. Conclusions: We conclude that mixed chimerism at days 30, 60 and 90 was associated with an increased risk of relapse and we shown that the development of acute GvHD was correlated with the kinetics of T-cell chimerism. These fi ndings can help the management of immunotherapy after RIC allogeneic stem cell transplantation.",

We have investigated a transplant conditioning schedule containing 3 days Busulphan in combination with Fludarabine and Alemtuzumab, in patients with advanced disease. We elected to use intravenous Busulphan (Busilvex\u00ae) in view of its excellent pharmacokinetic profi le. Methods: 45 patients with haematological malignancy underwent allogeneic transplantation using a Busilvex-based schedule: 14 received 2 days Busilvex (FB2C) and 31 received 3 days (FB3C). The 31 patients who received FB3C were judged to have high-risk disease. The median age for patients receiving FB2C was 50.5 years (range, 21-58) and FB3C 54 years (range, 23-64), with a median follow-up (survivors) of 21.5 months (range 4.4-68.6 ). Matched sibling/related donors were used for 26 (FB2C-10, FB3C-16) and unrelated donors for 19 patients (FB2C-4, FB3C-15). All patients received in vivo T-cell depletion with Alemtuzumab. Results: The non-relapse mortality at day 100 and 6 months was 0% and 0% respectively for all patients. Of the patients treated with FB2C, 9 of 14 (64.3%) remain alive, all in CR. Of these 3 have relapsed and have responded to further treatment including a second allograft in 2 cases. 5 FB2C patients have died: 2 relapse, 1 graft versus host disease (GvHD) and 2 from multiorgan failure. 22 of 31 (71%) patients who received FB3C are currently alive. Of the 22 survivors evaluable for response, 20 are in CR and 2 are currently being treated for relapse. 9 patients who received FB3C have died, 6 from relapse; 4 of these had disease present at the time of transplant. Both FB2C and FB3C schedules were well tolerated with no unexpected toxicities. Two of 33 patients (FB2C-1, BF3C-1) experienced grade 3-4 acute GvHD. Conclusion: A 3 day schedule of intravenous Busulphan in combination with Fludarabine and Alemtuzumab can be delivered with excellent tolerability, even to heavily pre-treated and older patients and shows promising results in the treatment of high risk haematological malignancy.",

This pilot study tested the combination of Fludarabine (120 mg/m\u00b2), Busulfan (4 mg/Kg total dose administered orally over a single day) and Thymoglobuline (5 mg/Kg) as a RIC regimen prior to allo-SCT in a single centre series of 46 patients. The cohort included 27 males and 19 females with a median age at time of allo-SCT of 57y (range, 12-64). Diagnoses included 21 cases of AML, 12 NHL, 6 Hodgkin diseases, 3 ALL, 2 myeloproliferative syndromes, 1 MDS and 1 CLL. PBSCs were used as stem cell source in 42 patients, 4 patients received classical bone marrow. A matched-related donor was used in 18 cases and an unrelated donor in 28 cases. With a median follow-up of 30.4 (range, 23.7-50.8 ) months, the median peripheral blood chimerism of donor origin at day 30 after allo-SCT was 99%. 20 patients experienced grade 2-4 acute GVHD, including 13 cases of grade 3-4 acute GVHD. 9 patients experienced chronic GVHD. At time of last followup, 26 patients were still alive. Relapse or disease progression occurred in 13 patients at a median of 3.5 (range, 0.6-18) months after allo-SCT. Disease progression accounted for 7 deaths, while transplant-related causes were observed in 13 cases, for a TRM rate of 28.3%. The KM estimates of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) at 3 years after allo-SCT were 46.9% and 56.5% respectively. OS was lower in the AML subgroup as compared to the remaining 25 patients with other diagnoses (42.9% vs. 68%, P = 0.09). So low dose Busulfan combined with fl udarabine and ATG is a feasible RIC regimen that can allow engraftment after allo-SCT in heavily pre-treated patients with an acceptable toxicity profi le. However, in the setting of AML, disease control may be a matter of concern, especially in the early period after allo-SCT, suggesting that this type of RIC should be reserved for patients with lymphoid or indolent malignancies.",

Arcese (1) (1)Tor Vergata University (Rome, IT); (2)Regina Elena Hospital (Rome, IT) Background: Primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) are an heterogeneous group of non Hodgkin's lymphomas, CTCL in advanced stage have a poor prognosis with conventional therapy. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) provides a potentially curative approach in such patients. A reduced intensity conditioning (RIC), reducing transplant-related toxicities, makes allogeneic HSCT feasible in unfi t patients. Materials and methods: We are reporting 7 patients (2 F; 5 M) (median age 52 years, range 44-64) affected by CTCL. Diagnosis were: panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (n = 1) large T-cell lymphoma (n = 1), NK T-cell lymphoma (n = 1), Mycosis fungoides (n = 1), Sezary syndrome (n = 3). At the time of transplant 5 patients had a relapsed/refractory disease, 1 patient was in partial remission and 1 in complete remission. All patients but 1 were pretreated, having received at least 4 lines of prior therapies and 2 had undergone a previous autologous transplant. Six patients underwent allogeneic transplant from HLA identical sibling and 1 from a mismatched sibling. The RIC regimen consisted of thiotepa (10 mg/kg), fl udarabine (60 mg/m 2 ), and cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg). Cyclosporine and methotrexate were used as GVHD prophylaxis in HLA identical HSCT, thymoglobulin (6 mg/kg) was added in mismatched transplant. Sources of stem cells were bone marrow in 5 patients and peripheral blood in 3. Results: All patients engrafted, a complete chimerism was detected at day 30 in 6 patients and at day 90 after transplant in 1 patient. No early toxicities or infectious complications other than CMV reactivation occurred. A grade I-II acute GVHD occurred in 4 patients; 2 patients developed chronic GVHD: 1 limited and 1 extended with generalized scleroderma. One patient is too early, while 6 patients evaluable for response achieved a complete remission. One patient with Sezary syndrome relapsing at 9 months entered disease remission after donor lymphocyte infusions and she is still in remission at 4 years from transplant. One patient with NK T-cell lymphoma relapsed at 8 months from transplant. To date, with a median follow-up of 28 months (range 2-59), all patients are alive, 5 in complete remission. Conclusions: The employed RIC regimen combined with standard GVHD prophylaxis is highly tolerable with low transplant related toxicity and suggests a potential curative effect for patients with CTCL also if transplanted in advanced stage of the disease.",

However, PBSC, usually chosen to overcome graft rejection, could promote chronic P937 Reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation with fl udarabine and melphalan for children with haematological malignancies K.

Horibe (2) (1)Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital (Nagoya, JP); (2) Reduced intensity preconditioning before allogeneic stem cell transplantation are recently undergone for children with hematological malignancies to reduce either early or late posttransplant complications. We retrospectively investigated the effi cacy and tolerability of reduced intensity stem cell transplantation (RIST) with the most fundamental preconditioning for RIST of fl udarabine (FLU) and melphalan (MEL) in 26 children with hematological malignancies from 13 institutions in Japan. Patients and methods: Median patient's age at transplant was 8 years old (0-16), and diagnosis of them were ALL (n = 6), AML (n = 11), CML (n = 3), MDS (n = 5), NK leukemia (n = 1). In patients with acute leukemia, the disease status at transplant were CR1 (n = 8), CR2 (n = 3), CR3 (n = 3), and relapse (n = 4). The stem cell source was bone marrow (n = 22), peripheral blood (n = 3) and cord blood (n = 1). The donor include sibling (n = 6), parents (n = 7), and unrelated donor (n = 13). The serological disparity of HLA were 0 (n = 17), 1 (n = 6), and 2 (n = 6). Preconditioning was done with FLU of median 125 mg/m 2 (120-150), combined with MEL of median 180 mg/m 2 (80-210). The reason for choosing RIST were intent to reduce late effects (n = 16), concurrent morbidity (n = 4), or others (n = 6). Results: Engraftment was obtained in 24 patients with median 19 days (11-35). Grade II-IV acute GVHD and extensive chronic GVHD were observed in 8 and 9 patients, respectively. Relapse and transplant related mortality was observed in 6 patients (27.2%) and 5 patients (28.1%), respectively. Eighteen patients are alive for median 873 days (76-2449) after transplantation and overall and event free survival was 57.9% and 39.9%, respectively. In acute leukemia, the event free survival of patients transplanted at CR1 was signifi cantly better than those transplanted at advanced disease status (68.6% vs. 17.5%, P = 0.031). Interestingly, no patients transplanted from HLA one or two antigens mismatched donor relapsed, and all patients transplanted from HLA one antigen mismatched donor are alive with signifi cant superiority than those transplanted from two antigens mismatched donor (100% vs. 25%, P = 0.032). Conclusion: RIST with FLU + MEL was feasible for children with hematological malignancies in terms of toxicity and anti-leukemic effect. It is mandatory to prove the effi cacy of this regimen with large number of patients.",

Ringd\u00e9n Karolinska Institutet (Stockholm, SE) A therapeutic option for graft failure (GF) may be a second allohaematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We evaluated the results in 20 recent patients treated with a second HSCT after GF at our centre. Ten of the patients were children less than 18 years old. Indications for HSCT were a non-malignant disease in ten patients, leukaemia in seven, MDS/MPS in two and renal cell carcinoma in one patient. In most of the transplantations, fl udarabin-based reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) was given. Bone marrow was given to 11 patients, PBSC in seven and cord blood to two patients. For the second transplantation (n = 20), a new donor was identifi ed and used in nine cases while the initial donor was used in 11 transplants. Eight patients (40%) suffered from a second GF after the second HSCT. Five of these patients were treated with a third HSCT. The probability of survival was 65% one year and 60% three years after the second HSCT. No difference in survival was found between patients transplanted with a new donor (56%) compared to those using the original donor (64%). The 3-year survival was 70% for children compared to 50% for adults (P = ns) . However, patients with a non-malignant disorder showed a 3-year survival of 90% compared to 20% in patients with a malignant disease (P = 0.005). There was a trend for better survival in patients with > 6 months between the two transplants, 80% vs. 40% (P = 0.08). We concluded that retransplantation using RIC is a valid option for graft failure, especially in patients with non-malignant disorders.",

Eder, W. Rabitsch, P. Kalhs, Z. Kuzmina, A. Schulenburg, C. Zielinski, H. Greinix Medical University Vienna (Vienna, AT) Patients with refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) have a dismal prognosis. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) with myeloablative conditioning is associated with high transplant-related mortality (TRM) in this indication. Therefore, reduced-intensity conditioning protocols have been used to decrease TRM. Here, we investigated a BEAM-conditioning protocol with a reduced alemtuzumab dose to reduce infectious complications during immunodefi ciency after HCT. Patients and methods: Eleven patients with a median age of 37 (range, 24 to 44) years with refractory HL were referred for HCT after a median of 4 (range, 4-6) previous chemotherapy regimens including autologous HCT in 7. Conditioning consisted of chemotherapy according to the BEAM regimen, alemtuzumab was given in a dose of 10 mg/day on days -5 to -1. Graftversus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine A alone. All patients received peripheral blood stem cells with a median of 6 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + /kg body weight from an HLA-identical related (n = 7) or unrelated (n = 4) donor. Results: Ten patients achieved complete hematologic engraftment with absolute neutrophil counts above 0.5 G/l a median of 15 (range, 12 to 22) days after HCT whereas one rejected the graft. Two patients experienced acute GvHD grade II, four chronic GvHD (one limited and three extensive), and 1 patient died of multi-organ-failure (9%). Graded according to Cordonnier et al. 8 patients had 34 infectious episodes during the fi rst year after HCT including 4 bacterial, 6 viral, 4 fungal and 20 nonmicrobiologically defi ned infections. Of note, only one grade 3 infection was observed and thus, most infectious episodes were mild. Data on immune reconstitution will be presented. Best response after HCT was complete remission (CR) in 6/10 evaluable patients (60%), and partial remission (PR) in 3 (30%). Eight patients achieved complete donor chimerism in myeloid and lymphoid cell lineages including 4 patients after donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI). Cumulative incidence of relapse at 5 years was 39% and probability of 5-years-overall survival was 50%. After a median of 37 (range, 13 to 62) months of follow-up 6/11 patients (55%) are alive including 5 in continuous CR. Conclusions: Allogeneic HCT with conditioning according to the modifi ed BEAM-alemtuzumab protocol is an effi cient and welltolerated therapeutic option for patients with refractory HL and was not associated with serious infectious complications.",

Conclusions: Transplantation of CD3/CD19 depleted haploidentical stem cells with a reduced intensity regimen resulted in a fast recovery of neutrophiles and platelets. Engraftment rates similar to that of patients with myeloablative standard conditioning and positive selected stem cells could be achieved, possibly due to a graft facilitating effect of cotransfused NK cells. The regimen helped to minimize TRM, despite intensive pretreatment, and is suited for 2nd or 3rd transplantation. Patients in any CR had a favorable outcome, whereas patients with active disease showed high relapse rates. Especially in these patients, further therapeutic elements have to be evaluated.",

This study investigates safety and effi cacy of FLAMSA sequential conditioning regimen in high risk (HR) AML pts. We analyzed 74 pts, median age 55 years, 52 were de novo AML, 22 secondary AML. All had allogeneic HSCT after FLAMSA [fl udarabine (30 mg/m 2 /d), aracytine (2 g/m 2 /d), amsacrine (100 mg/m 2 /d) from day -12 to -9 followed by cyclophosphamide (40 mg/kg/d if related donor, 60 mg/kg/d if unrelated) on days -4,-3, ATG 2.5 mg/kg/d on days -4, -3, and -2 and either TBI 4 Gy on day -5 (n = 45) either busilvex 3.2 mg/kg/d on days -4,-5(n = 29)]. At HSCT 6 pts were in PIF, 14 in fi rst early relapse, 11 in late relapse, 30 refractory, 13 had more than 2 treated relapses. None presented complete response (CR). Twenty seven pts had HLA identical siblings SCT, 47 unrelated donors. Source was PBSC (62), BM (4), CB (8). Median time from diagnosis to HSCT was 10.7 months (2.9-313.2) . Sixty eight pts engrafted after a median time of 16 days. There were 29 acute GvHD (9 grade I, 20 grade II-IV) and 14 chronic GvHD (11 limited). The multivariate analysis showed that, secondary AML, sex matching (Mismatch with Female receiver), CMV positive receiver, minor ABO incompatibility and mismatched unrelated donor, had signifi cant impact on different outcomes (Table) . Thirty fi ve pts relapsed, 3 had progressive disease. The S296 cumulative incidence (CI) of relapse at 3, 6, 12, 24 months was 27%, 41.9%, 45.9%, 47.3% respectively. Nineteen pts without relapse died, 16 pts from transplant procedure. The CI of TRM at 6, 9, 24 months were 9.5%, 20.3%, 25.7% respectively. At last follow-up, 51 pts died, 23 patients are alive. After a median follow-up of 4.6 months, the probability of OS and PFS at 2 years was 21.9% and 23% in very HR AML pts without CR at transplant. This short follow up can be explained by the early high death incidence which can be due to patients with HR factors. Although CI of relapse and PFS present a plateau 12 months after HSCT. Results need to be confi rmed prospectively, but anti-leukemic activity seems effective, it would be interesting to use cytogenetic and molecular markers in order to precise which AML pts could benefi t of such a procedure.

Shiku (4) Purpose: To overcome the clinical insuffi ciency of anti-leukemia WT1 peptide vaccination, we have been investigating the feasibility of a novel immunotherapy with engineered T cells using WT1-specifi c TCR gene transfer. Methods: We have developed the GMP-grade bicistronic retroviral vector carrying full-length of WT1-specifi c TCR-alpha/beta genes obtained from HLA-A*2402-restricted WT1 235-243specifi c CTL clone (conventional vector). Additionally we have recently developed a novel TCR vector with built-in silencers for the constant regions of endogenous TCR-alpha/beta genes to reduce the mispairing between transduced and endogenous TCR-alpha/beta chains (si-TCR vector). Using either conventional or si-TCR vector, we transduced GaLV-pseudotyped bicistronic retroviral vector WT1 235-243-specifi c TCR-alpha/ beta gene in retronectin system. At fi rst, we examined whether the vectors could display the intended TCR with target-specificity on cell surface using Jurkat/MA cells, which lacks endogenous TCR and genetically modifi ed to express CD8 alpha and NFAT-luciferase construct to detect the transduced TCR mediated signaling (kindly gifted from Prof. Erik Hooijberg, Netherlands). The expression level of luciferase by WT1-specifi c TCR transduced Jurkat/MA was detected after coculture with WT1 235-243 peptide loaded C1R-A24 cells. Next we evaluated the target-specifi c and leukemia-specifi c responses of TCR genetransferred CD8 + T cells and CD4 + T cells by fl ow cytometer, cytokine production assay, and standard 57Cr releasing assay. Results: Transfection effi cacy was around 20% to 30%. TCRtransduced Jurkat/MA successfully produced luciferase in response to WT1 235-243 in a dose dependent manner. TCR transduced CD8 + cells successfully lysed the only peptide loaded C1R-A24 cells, and leukemia cells positive both for HLA-A*2402 and WT1, but not HLA-A*2402 positive normal cells. TCR transduced CD4 + cells successfully produced type 1 cytokines in response to the peptide-loaded C1R-A24 cells, and HLA-A*2402 positive primary leukemia cells in the HLA-class II restricted fashion. The novel vector, si-TCR vector markedly increased the surface expression of introduced WT1specifi c TCR on CD8 + T cells in accordance with the successful reduction of endogenous TCR. Conclusion: We have demonstrated the feasibility of WT1targeting gene-immunotherapy using WT1-specifi c TCR gene transferred T cells against leukemia. We are about to conduct the clinical trial against human hematological malignancy.",

Biondi (1) Despite advances in graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD) treatment, it is estimated that overall survival at 2 years for haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients, who experience steroid-resistant GvHD, is 10%. Among recent therapeutic approaches for GvHD treatment, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) hold a key position. These are multipotent progenitor cells with immunomodulatory properties, capable to escape immune rejection allowing their use in an HLA-mismatched setting. We describe a multi-centre experience of 10 pediatric patients (pts) diagnosed with acute or chronic GvHD treated for compassionate use with GMP-grade unrelated HLA-disparate donors' bone marrow-derived MSCs, expanded in Platelet-Lysate (PL)-containing medium. Between May 2008 and June 2009, 10 pts (aged 4 to 15 years) transplanted for malignant (N = 8) or non-malignant (N = 2) diseases, received iv MSCs for acute or chronic grade I to IV GvHD, which was resistant to multiple lines of immunosuppression. Twenty MSC infusions were given to 10 pts (3 pts had a single infusion, 7 had multiple infusions). The median dose was 1.2 \u00d7 10 6 /kg (range 0.7-3.7 \u00d7 10 6 /kg). No acute side-effects were observed, and no late side-effects were reported at a median follow-up of 8 months (range 4-18 months).",

Nine pts are alive in complete remission with a median follow up of 10 months after HCT (range 6 to 24 months). One patient died on day + 126 from HCT because of sepsis. Another patient is alive, but with progressive severe GvHD. Two pts developed chronic limited GvHD. Six pts are alive in the absence of GvHD and immunosuppression. To corroborate clinical observations, TNFa and IFNg plasma levels of 4 pts were monitored by ELISA before and after MSC treatment. Interestingly, TNFa and IFNg levels, which were elevated before MSC infusion, transiently decreased in nonresponder pts, while signifi cantly and persistently decreased in responder ones. The present study underlines the safety of PL-expanded MSC use in children. MSC effi cacy seems to be greater in acute than in chronic GvHD, even after failure of multiple lines of immunosuppression.",

Although several methods for the cloning of in vivo induced CTLs have been reported, an effi cient protocol to prime and expand low-frequency and na\u00efve CD8 positive T cells in vitro remains a challenge. Methods: In order to achieve a high avidity specifi c T cells for adoptive cell transfer we compare induction and expansion possibilities of four different cytokine cocktails including IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-12, IL-15. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from several healthy volunteers (negative for hepatitis B and C, with no evidence of liver disease in the past). Cells were cultivated in the presence of several viral and tumour HLA A2 binding peptides of known immunogenicity. They were supplemented with IL-2 from day 3 of the culture and restimulated weekly with irradiated, peptide pulsed autologous PBMCs. The functional tests included IFN-gamma secretion assay, tetramer staining, cytotoxicity test and immunophenotyping. Results: In most of our experiments with both viral and tumour associated antigens, we were able to generate and expand the antigen specifi c CD8 positive T cells. Furthermore, na\u00efve and memory subsets were isolated from PBMCs and cultivated separately according to the protocol. After four weeks cultivation, viral and tumour antigen specifi c responses were observed only in T cell cultures with na\u00efve precursors. Moreover, by using a cytokine cocktail including IL-6 and IL-12 we successfully adapted the method to the GMP conditions. PBMCs obtained by leukapheresis from a healthy stem cell donor, a sibling sister of our AML patient, were cultivated according to the protocol for a few weeks. As a result we obtained culture with 17% IFN-gamma positive cells in response to stimulation with three different WT-1 antigens. Generated cells were successfully applied to our patient as a part of conditioning regiment by relapse of AML. Conclusions: We established a simple and effective approach for the in vitro induction and expansion of CTLs of desired antigen specifi city for an adoptive therapy in both viral and malignant diseases.",

Effective drugrelated therapies are not available to date. Reconstitution of antiviral immunity by transferring donor-derived virus-specifi c T cells, was shown to be a promising treatment option. However, the presence of ADV-specifi c T cells in healthy donors is a prerequisite for such therapies. Since the frequency of AdVspecifi c T cells is very low in blood of healthy ADV-seropositive individuals, highly sensitive detection methods are necessary. In this study we investigated the sensitivity of ADV peptide-MHC multimers and the IFNg capture assay to detect ADV-specifi c T cells in freshly isolated PBMCs, developed a method for rapid ex vivo expansion of ADV-specifi c T cells and investigated the effect of ADV-specifi c T cells in the clearance of ADV infection after aHSCT. Methods: Depending on the HLA-type, freshly isolated PBMCs were either directly stained with multimers or stimulated for 16h with an ADV hexon protein to detect IFNg-producing ADVspecifi c T cells. For ex vivo expansion of ADV-specifi c T cells, PBMCs (5 mio/ml) were stimulated with hexon protein. On day 3 and 9 cultured cells were stimulated with IL-15. On day 6 cells were restimulated with hexon protein-pulsed autologous PBMCs On day 12, expansion of ADV-specifi c T cells was analysed by multimers or IFNg. Results: 55% out of 20 healthy donors have been tested positive for ADV-specifi c T cells by analyzing freshly isolated PBMCs. In contrast, 90% have been tested positive after ex vivo expansion. In accordance with these results, only one donor (20%) out of 5 of freshly isolated PBMCs and 4 donors (80%) of ex-vivo expanded T cells have been tested positive by the IFNg capture assay. These results clearly indicate that ex-vivo expansion of PBMCs is necessary to ensure the presence of ADV-specifi c T cells in healthy donors. In addition, the absolute cell number of ADV-specifi c T cells was increased 2 to 3 log after ex-vivo expansion compared to freshly isolated PBMCs. Expanded T cells showed functional and cytotoxic activity. Strikingly, clearance of ADV infection was associated with increased numbers of multimer-positive T cells in a patient after aHSCT. In conclusion, this study defi nes rapid and optimal conditions for detection and ex vivo expansion of ADV-specifi c T cells with high potential for clinical application.",

Greupink, B. Esendam, S. Bak, T. De Witte, L. Strobbe, B. van Rees, M. Schaap, R. Raymakers UMC St Radboud (Nijmegen, NL) In an ongoing trial we vaccinate multiple myeloma (MM) patients using mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) electroporated with in vitro-transcribed mRNA encoding for Mage-3, Survivin and B cell maturation protein (BCMA). Preclinical studies showed that RNA electroporation leads to high protein expression and long-lasting peptide presentation in the context of MHC class I, without loss of migratory capacity. To date, six patients with a (near) complete resmission after high-dose Melphalan (HDM) have been vaccinated. Mature DCs were generated from apheresis products, loaded with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) as an adjuvant and control antigen, and electroporated with clinical grade tumor antigen mRNA. Patients were vaccinated 3 times, both intraveneously (8-20 \u00d7 10 6 per dosis) and intradermally (4-10 \u00d7 10 6 per dosis), at 2 week intervals. Vaccinated patients were monitored for a) T cell and antibody responses against KLH in peripheral blood, b) presence of vaccine-specifi c T cells in DTH biopsies and bone marrow aspirates using tetramers and ELISPOT, c) Th1/2 cytokine profi les and cytolytic activity of vaccine-induced T cells. Disease activity was monitored by measuring M-component/free light chain and by using a highly sensitive IgH-PCR assay. All patients developed strong anti-KLH T cell responses, but antibodies to KLH could not be detected. Two weeks after the last vaccination DTH-testing was performed and skin biopsies were taken. In 2 patients, vaccine-specifi c T cells could be detected in the DTHinfi ltrating lymphocytes. In one patient, we found CD8 + and CD4 + T cells reactive against Mage-3 electroporated DCs as well as CD3 + T cells reactive against DCs electroporated with BCMA and Survivin using both ELISPOT and CBA analysis. In the other patient, we detected low numbers of Mage-3 and BCMA-reactive CD8 + T cells using ELISPOT. Vaccination was well tolerated with limited toxicity such as mild fever, redness and swelling at the injection sites. These fi ndings illustrate that TAA mRNA-electroporated mature DCs are capable to induce TAA-specifi c CD8 + T cell responses in MM patients after highdose chemotherapy. Currently, the specifi city of the vaccinespecifi c T cell responses are being investigated as well as the effect of vaccination on MRD. The trial will be continued until 12 patients are included.",

However, these MiHA-specifi c CD8 + T cell responses do not result in complete eradication of tumor cells in all patients. Furthermore, CD8 + memory T cells persisting after DLI do not always effi ciently expand with recurrence of the disease. Adjuvant immunotherapy using dendritic cells (DC) loaded with hematopoietic-restricted MiHA may boost anti-tumor CD8 + T cell immunity without inducing graft-versushost disease. Here, we explored the use of mRNA-electroporated DC to stimulate MiHA-specifi c CD8 + T cell responses. We demonstrate that electroporation of mature DC with P2X5 mRNA encoding for hematopoietic-restricted MiHA LRH-1 results in high expression of both mRNA and protein, and has no negative effect on the mature phenotype and migratory capacity of the DC. Furthermore, these DC can effi ciently stimulate LRH-1-specifi c CD8 + effector T cells to proliferate and produce IFN-\u00e3. In addition, LRH-1-specifi c CD8 + memory T cells that are present in patient-derived PBMC at long periods post-DLI can be effectively activated by stimulation with P2X5 mRNA-electroporated DC to proliferate and degranulate upon target cell recognition. These results indicate that adjuvant immunotherapy using DC electroporated with mRNA encoding hematopoietic-restricted MiHA mismatched between patients and donors may enhance the GVT response induced by SCT and DLI.",

However, three major hurdles hinder the effectiveness of this strategy: i) ineffi cient gene transfer and unstable transgene expression, ii) exhaustion of gene-modifi ed cells, and iii) mispairing of endogenous and exogenous TCR chains. To solve these issues, we used a bi-directional lentiviral vector (LV) expressing a codon-optimized, cysteine-modifi ed TCR for the Wilms tumor antigen 1 (WT1) to genetically modifi ed human central memory T lymphocytes (TCM). Transduced cells showed high (~16%) and stable (70 days in culture) levels of WT1-pentamer binding and specifi cally responded against WT1 + primary AML leukemic blasts. To further enhance the safety profi le and potency of modifi ed TCM, we developed a platform to genome edit TCM based on Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFN). In order to ensure stable and consistent transgene expression, we demonstrated the targeted insertion of the transgene into a predefi ned genomic locus (CCR5) by homologous recombination in up to 6% of treated TCM, with concurrent inactivation of 18% of the targeted CCR5 gene by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). These fi ndings prompted us to develop ZFN specifi c for the endogenous TCR beta chain gene to prevent TCR mispairing. We obtained functional inactivation of this gene by NHEJ in 7% TCM. Targeted lymphocytes failed in expressing the CD3/TCR complex on cell surface, and could be sorted as CD3neg. CD3neg proved stable in culture, maintained a TCM phenotype and were resistant to further TCR-mediated triggering. For a complete editing of T cell specifi city, the WT1-specifi c TCR was transferred with high effi ciency (> 20%) by LV on CD3neg cells. WT1-TCR rescued CD3 surface expression and was expressed in edited lymphocytes at higher levels to that observed upon conventional TCR gene transfer. Accordingly, TCR-edited cells proved superior to cells undergoing conventional TCR gene transfer in promoting killing of relevant targets, and in recognizing low (10 nM) peptide concentrations. Overall, these data show the feasibility of rapid and effi cient editing of TCM to generate safe and functional tumor-specifi c T cells and may open new perspectives to cancer adoptive immunotherapy.

Kr\u00f6ger (1) (1)University Cancer Center (Hamburg, DE); (2)Pavlov State Medical University (St. Petersburg, RU) Introduction: Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) represent an immunoadoptive approach to induce \"graft versus leukemia effect\" (GvL) aiming to eradicate the leukemic cells. However, CD3 + DLIs are associated with a high graft versus host disease (GvHD) rate that might be fatal. As some studies proposed a central role of CD8 + cells in the development of GvHD, the use of separated CD4 + donor cells seems to be an option to reduce the incidence of this event. Here we reported on clinical use of selected CD4 + cells by the CliniMACS\u00ae device aiming to evaluate its effi cacy and safety after allo-SCT. Patients and methods: 24 patients (pts) (16 male; 8 female) with hematological malignancies (multiple myeloma, n = 11; myelofibrosis, n = 6; CML: blast phase, n = 2; chronic phase, n = 1; MDS, n = 3; CLL, n = 1) were enrolled at median of 14 months (range, 2-76) from allo-SCT. The median age was 49 years (range, 21-65). 19/24 (79%) pts received dose-reduced, whereas 5/24 (21%) myeloablative conditioning. 11 pts received grafts from related, 13 from unrelated donors (matched, n = 8; mismatched, n = 5). The reasons to perform CD4 + selected DLI were relapse (n = 10), minimal residual disease (n = 8), prophylaxis due to high relapse risk (n = 4), and severe herpetic stomatitis (n = 2). 24 leukapheresis products were enriched for CD4 + cells using magnetic cell sorting (MACS) with an automated device (Clini-MACS\u00ae).",

Navarrete NHS Blood and Transplant (London, UK) Objectives: Originally derived from Bone Marrow (BM), mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) may be derived from alternative sources with umbilical cord (UC) providing an abundant and non-invasive source. MSC possess interesting immunological properties, they can suppress T cell activation, modulate the function of several leucocyte subsets and do not induce strong allogeneic responses. MSC are currently being used in clinical trials as a novel anti-infl ammatory agent. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain the suppressive potential of MSCs, and we are dissecting the cellular interactions required for suppression of allo-specifi c T cell proliferation. Methods: MSC generated from UC were maintained in DMEM, 10% FCS. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were purifi ed from buffy coats by Ficoll centrifugation. Monocytes, CD4 + T cells and monocyte or B cell depleted PBMC were purifi ed using magnetic microbeads. PBMC, monocyte or B cell depleted PBMC were stimulated using T cell activation beads \u00b1 MSC. Monocytes purifi ed from MLR or PBMC \u00b1 MSC co-culture using percoll centrifugation and bead separation were cultured with HLA-mismatched CFSE labeled CD4 + T cells at a ratio of 1:10. Results: UC-MSC share the surface phenotype as well as the immunosuppressive abilities of MSC from BM and cord blood. We found that suppression of mitogen induced T cell proliferation by MSC from all 3 sources required monocytes. Removal of monocytes but not B cells from adult PBMC preparations reduced the immunosuppressive effects of MSC on T cell proliferation. Conversely, addition of purifi ed monocytes to UC-MSC and CD4 + T cell co-cultures restored the suppressive effects of UC-MSC. There was rapid modulation of a number of cell surface molecules on monocytes when PBMC, MLR or purifi ed monocytes were cultured with UC-MSC. Monocytes purifi ed from UC-MSC co-culture had signifi cantly reduced accessory cell and allo-stimulatory function when tested in subsequent T cell proliferation assays, an effect mediated in part by UC-MSC prostaglandin production. Finally, UC-MSC and MLR co-culture induced prostaglandin-E2 independent IL-10 production by monocytes. Summary: Monocytes were found to be essential for the immunosuppressive function of MSC on alloantigen induced T cell proliferation. UC-MSC rapidly altered the phenotype, induced IL-10 production and reduced allo-stimulatory function of the monocyte population following co-culture, an effect mediated in part by prostaglandin-E2.",

Bader (1) (1)Goethe University (Frankfurt, DE) ; (2) University Ulm (Ulm, DE) Haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has become an important treatment modality for high-risk leukemia patients. Nevertheless, the success of HSCT is mainly affected by relapse. Pre-emptive immunotherapy may prevent impending relapse in some cases. Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells with reduced propensity for GvHD may offer an alternative approach to conventional donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI). In this study, we investigated the feasibility of enhancing CIK cell mediated cytotoxicity against leukemias without infl uencing the alloreactive potential of CIK cells. CIK cells are non-MHC restricted effector cells consisting of T, NKT and NK cells. CIK cells can easily be generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in vitro. Expanding CIK cells showed an increase of NKT cells and a decrease of regulatory T cells (Treg). The number of NKT cells expressing CD8 + cytotoxic phenotype, activating NK receptors and effector molecules increased during cell culture. Cytotoxicity of CIK cells was assessed by europium release assay. At an effector to target ratio of 50:1 CIK cells showed potent antileukemic activity against standard target K562 (51.73 \u00b1 17.69%), T-ALL cell lines Jurkat (57.50 \u00b1 10.61%), H9 (44.29 \u00b1 25.58%), ) and subtype M4 AML cell line THP-1 (60.17 \u00b1 31.18%). Furthermore, we could show that CIK cell mediated cytolytic activity is NKG2D receptor and granzyme/perforin dependent and that extrinsic death signals are transferred via TRAIL. These fi ndings and the fact that CIK cells can easily be expanded even according to GMP terms may spark clinical interest in these cells.",

That means, that proportions and composition of DC generated ex vivo are predictive for the pts' response to SCT or DLI, what could be explained by an improved DC-generability and T-cell-priming in vivo.

Compared to 'MNC' 'DC' were better mediators of anti-leukaemic-T-cell-activity, although not in every case effective. We could defi ne cut-off proportions of mature DC/DCleu,/proliferating/CD4 + /CD8 + and non-naive T-cells after 'MNC'-or 'DC'-stimulation, that were predictive for an antileukemic activity of stimulated T-cells as well as a response to immunotherapy. Interestingly especially ratios > 1 of CD4:CD8 or CD45RO:CD45RA T-cells were predictive for antileukemic function after DC-stimulation. In summary the composition and quality of DC and T-cells after a MLC-stimulating-phase is predictive for a successful ex-vivo and in-vivo anti-leukemic response, especially with respect to proportions of mature and leukemia-derived DC or proliferating/CD4 + /CD45RO + T-cells. Successful cytotoxicity and the development of a T-cell-memory after 'DC'-stimulation could be predictive for the clinical course of the disease and may pave the way to develop and refi ne DC-vaccination or adoptive immunotherapy strategies, especially for patients at relapse after SCT.",

Zoudiari, D. Kokkinou, N. Zoumbos, A. Spyridonidis University Hospital Patras (Patras, GR) Introduction: HLA-G is a nonclassic MHC class I with unique features that functions as an immunomodulatory molecule. HLA-G was found to be expressed in extravillous trophoblasts during pregnancy and protects fetal tissues from the maternal immune system. HLA-G has been shown to regulate the rejection process after solid organ transplantation but its role in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is unknown. Objectives: The aim of this study was to detect and characterize naturally occurring HLA-G + cells and to investigate their possible immunoregulatory properties. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from 22 volunteer donors and were analyzed by FACS for the presence of HLAG + (MEM-G/9 MoAb) cells, both in whole PBMC and in specifi c cell compartments. Moreover, we isolated HLA-G + cells by FACS sorting (Vantage, BD) and analyzed their tolerogenic properties by using them as third party cells in mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC) and in PHA stimulated lymphocyte cultures. The lymphoproliferative response in the cultures was measured using the CFSE cell proliferation assay. The immunmodulatory effect of HLA-G was calculated in comparison to lymphocyte proliferation in control cultures without addition of HLA-G + cells. Results: The mean percentage of HLA-G + cells in whole PBMC was 4.4% with a Specifi c Fluorescent Index (SFI) of 1.2. The mean percentage of HLA-G + cells was signifi cantly higher in CD14 + (23.2%) than in CD3 + cells (1.4%), P = 0.0002. Inversely, we isolated by FACS sorting HLA-G + cells from PBMC and found that 93% of them were CD14 + . CD14 + /HLAG + cells showed signifi cant lower expression of HLA-DR (SFI 81.3) as compared to CD14 + /HLAG-cells (SFI 186), P < 0.001. CD3 + / HLAG-cells were found to express membrane HLA-G upon their ex vivo exposure to azacytidine (HLA-G induced T-cells). When FACS sorted CD14 + /HLAG + cells were added as third party cells in MLC or in PHA-stimulated lymphocyte cultures we observed a dose dependent suppression of lymphoproliferation. Concentrations > 1/1 of responder/HLA-G + cells showed signifi cant suppression of the allo-response by > 42% over the control, P = 0.0012. Conclusions: Our results indicate the existence and the capacity to isolate HLA-G + cells with immunosuppressive function from PB of healthy individuals. Naturally occurring HLAG + monocytic cells (and maybe also HLA-G + induced T-cells) suggest a promising strategy for adoptive cell immunosuppressive therapy after HCT.",

Fehse (1) (1) Adoptive immunotherapy (adIT) with suicide gene-modifi ed allogeneic T lymphocytes has been shown to be a potent strategy to facilitate immune reconstitution and to treat leukaemia relapses or infectious complications after allogeneic HSCT. Despite several imperfections, including slow and incomplete killing as well as unspecifi c toxicity of high ganciclovir (GCV) doses, the Herpex simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSVtk) gene together with its prodrug GCV has been the suicide gene-of-choice in most clinical gene therapy studies so far. In order to address these shortcomings, we developed a codon-optimised HSVtk [coHSVtk] and modifi ed this by introducing the A168H mutation (initially described by Karlsson and colleagues) to generate the novel suicide gene TK.007. Performance of coHSVtk and TK.007 as compared to the frequently used splice-corrected wild-type scHSVtk was assessed in different preclinical adIT models. Gene transfer was accomplished using retroviral MP71 vectors encoding fusion constructs of the different suicide genes with one of the selection marker tCD34 or OuaSelect. Using these tools we observed (i) better expression characteristics and (ii) strongly improved killing kinetics for TK.007 as compared to both other HSVtk's in haematopoietic cell lines and primary T cells in vitro. We next tested TK.007 in vivo in a murine graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD) model. We found that infusion of TK.007-transduced allogeneic T cells induces severe, lethal GvHD which could readily be abrogated by GCV treatment. In a further experimental setting we intended a direct comparison of TK.007 vs. the commonly used scHSVtk in vivo.",

Dickinson Newcastle University (Newcastle, UK) A novel cellular therapy for Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) is the co transplantation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). This investigation intended to further elucidate the immunosuppressive properties of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), particularly in the context of GvHD. Three of the key mechanisms of MSC immunosuppression (indoleamine-2,3, deoxygenase (IDO), inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) and HLA-G) were studied in the context of a primary mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). FACS analysis and blocking experiments were used. In order to investigate whether the mechanisms described could be demonstrated to act in a synchronised manner levels of activity for each mechanism for days 0, 1 and 3 were measured and given a score. The score was expressed as the percentage of the maximum mean activity for each mechanism and grouped into four categories; very low or zero expression (0-30%); low (30-50%); high (50-70%) and maximal(70-100%)expression. Furthermore MSCs signifi cantly reduced the Graft versus Host Reaction (GvHR) in the in vitro human skin explant model. The Graft versus Host alloreactivity (GvHR) seen in this model is analogous to graft versus host disease (GvHD) in a clinical transplant setting. Briefl y, MSCs and responder cells were taken from a MLR then co cultured with a skin biopsy from the stimulator for 3 days. Various conditions were tested. MSCs showed immunomodulatory effects even when trytophan levels were restored (P = 0.018). Blockade of iNOS also altered the inhibitory effects of MSCs in this context. HLA-G was strongly expressed on the MSC cell surface (n = 4) and it was shown using ELISA and FACS that HLA-G is shed from the MSC cell surface and taken up and expressed by responder cells via a process known as trogocytosis during an MLR (P = 0.053). Results demonstrated that when overall expression was analysed IDO and iNOS showed a reciprocal activity during the lag phase of the alloresponse. There was no obvious link to HLA-G activity. Priming MSCs with IFNg and TNFa altered the kinetics of IDO and iNOS expression by prolonging the activity of IDO and iNOS during the lag phase of an allo-reaction but had no effect upon HLA-G. This may explain the augmentary effects of these cytokines on MSC function. MSC immunomodulatory activity is multi-phasic -perhaps indicative of an important homeostatic in vivo role which can be manipulated using cytokines. This may have relevance in their future use in transplantation.",

Cignetti (1) (1)Molecular Biotechnology Center (Turin, IT); (2)IRCC (Candiolo, IT) High-avidity T cells specifi c for self-peptide/self-MHC ligands are eliminated in the thymus by negative selection. An attractive strategy to circumvent tolerance to self-protein is the generation of peptide-specifi c, allo-restricted cytotoxic T cells (CTL). We have isolated an allo-restricted CTL clone with high avidity against a modifi ed, HLA-A2 restricted survivin epitope. Survivin is the prototype of \"universal\" tumor associated antigens, because it is expressed at high levels in nearly all tumor types and at low levels in normal tissues. A survivin specifi c CTL clone was generated by priming CD8 + cells from an HLA-A2 negative donor with peptide-pulsed T2 cells. Primed CD8 + cells were restimulated with peptide-pulsed PHA-blasts from 2 different donors who were mismatched only for the HLA-A2 allele. One day after each restimulation, CD137 expression was evaluated on bulk cultured CTL and after the fourth cycle a signifi cant CD137 upregulation was observed (8%). The CD137 + fraction was purifi ed by magnetic beads and cloned by limiting dilution. 135 clones were screened by IFN-g elispot using peptide-loaded T2 cells pulsed with the modifi ed survivin peptide or with an irrelevant peptide. 109 clones were not reactive, 25 clones were reactive against both the relevant and irrelevant peptide and one clone (4C12) was highly reactive only against the survivin peptide. The activity of clone 4C12 was tested against T2 cells pulsed with escalating doses of the modifi ed (LMLGEFLKL) and of the na\u00efve (ELTGEFLKL) survivin peptide. The functional avidity against the modifi ed peptide was higher than against the na\u00efve peptide, and 4C12 activity against T2 cells pulsed with the na\u00efve peptide was similar to that against HLA-A2 + leukemic cells expressing endogenous survivin (THP-1). We have also tested clone 4C12 against HLA-A2 + normal fi broblasts and EBV-transformed Bcells and found that its functional activity is strictly correlated with the amount of survivin transcript expressed by each cell type. We are currently extending this observation to a broader panel of normal and malignant HLA-A2 cells, including stem cells. To evaluate the degree of non-specifi c alloreactivity, we will test the activity of clone 4C12 against a set of HLA-A2 negative normal and malignant cells. If clone 4C12 will confi rm its high degree of specifi city and activity against tumor cells overexpressing survivin, it will be suitable for T-cell receptor gene transfer.",

Since Aug 2006 we started on a clinical trial with infusion of CIK cells for 3 groups of patients: (1) adjuvant infusion post autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), (2) untreated AML and (3) relapse post allogeneic HSCT. Method: CIK cell was cultured from frozen or fresh leukapheresis cells under GMP condition. At D26-28 cells were washed and frozen in aliquots. Results: Expansion was a median of 7.7(0.7-171.1) fold for CD3 + subset and 28.3(1.7-350.9 ) fold for CD3 + CD56 + subset, which comprised 26.6% (3.8-76.9% ) in the fi nal product. CIK could be cultured even from untreated AML patients with 20-87% circulating blasts and post allo-HSCT patients where donor cells are unavailable. At E:T ratio of 40:1, cytotoxicity was a median of 29% vs. auto AML targets (n = 10) and 37% vs. a common allogeneic AML target(n = 43). CIK products post-thaw showed comparable cytotoxicity as pre-freeze sample. A total of 85 infusions were given to 28 patients. For group 1 (n = 11), RFS was 32% at 34 months. For group 3 (n = 14), 2 patients with Hodgkin's disease that progressed on mild oral chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) had shrinkage of lymph node after CIK infusion. 8 acute leukemia patients received donor CIK at cytopenia post salvage chemotherapy. 1 patient with refractory relapse of T-ALL had a 5th salvage followed by CIK and achieved BM remission for 10 mo despite progression of extramedullary (EM) leukemia. Another with relapsed pre-B ALL post cord HSCT achieved remission after salvage and underwent leukapheresis for CIK culture. BM remission lasted 5 mo while leptomeningeal relapse occurred at 1 mo post infusion. Both cases suggest a GVL effect known to be active for BM but not EM leukemia. CIK was ineffective in 4 patients (AML = 3, HD = 1) with untreated relapse post allo-HSCT and 2 non-HSCT patients (group 2) with untreated AML. Fever was the only acute side effect and was self-limiting. Acute GVHD of skin (n = 2) and liver (n = 2) occurred in 4 of the 14 patients and all responded to short course corticosteroids. CIK was tolerated up to a dose of 200 \u00d7 10 6 CD3/kg and the dose did not correlate with GVHD. Conclusion: The effi cacy of autologous CIK as adjuvant therapy to prevent AML relapse needs a larger sample size to assess. CIK has superiority over DLI in some patients post allo-HSCT, but effi cacy is limited to BM and not EM leukemia.",

With increased duration of culture with cytokine, expression of activation markers and lytic activity of NK-cells increased signifi cantly. Cryopreservation of activated NK-cells had dramatic effect on their lytic activity, which could be restored partially by overnight incubation with cytokine. No major differences were observed between IL-2 or IL-15 stimulated cells. Discussion: The CD3-CD56 + cliniMACS procedure results in a product of higher purity, viability and absence of activated monocytes with only slightly lower yield compared to CD3-CD19-CliniMACS. The activated phenotype and lytic capacity of IL-2 or IL-15 stimulated cultures is comparable. Cytokine induced activation of cryopreserved CD3-CD56 + cliniMACS NK-cells is feasible.",

Provasi, Z. Magnani, B. Camisa, A. Bondanza, C. Bonini San Raffaele Scientifi c Institute (Milan, IT) Adoptive cellular therapy, potentiated by gene transfer technologies, holds great promise for the treatment of cancer. However, current gene transfer protocols result in terminally differentiated, often exhausted, cells mediating only transient anti-tumour responses. Our lab previously showed that activation of donor lymphocytes with cell-size beads conjugated with antibodies to CD3 and CD28 and culture with low doses g-chain cytokines generates genetically modifi ed T cells with a functional central memory (TCM) phenotype. In contrast to effector and effector memory (TEM) cells, TCM are the ideal source of long-term anti-tumor immunity, having a longer lifespan and stem/progenitor cell features, such as self-renewal and the ability to differentiate into a progeny of effectors. In the present work we therefore asked whether gene-modifi ed TCM cells represented a homogenous population or whether initial targeting of Na\u00efve cells could further improve the potency of transduced cells. Thus we activated with our protocol and effi ciently transduced FACS-sorted Na\u00efve, TCM and TEM CD8 + cells by retro and lentiviral vectors. We observed that CD8 + T cells from FACS-sorted Na\u00efve cells have a greater expansion potential than cells from FACS-sorted TCM and TEM. IL7-Ra was the most informative marker in defi ning cell function, origin and potential as its expression was maintained only by cultured Na\u00efve T Cells and not by TCM and TEM-sorted lymphocytes. In FACSsorted cultured Na\u00efve cells we observed a predominant population of CD45RA + CD62L + CCR7 + lymphocytes. Although this phenotype traditionally defi nes Na\u00efve T cells, CFSE dilution revealed that these cells are post-mitotic and re-acquire the phenotype upon cell division. These cells display features common to early differentiated cells, such as expression of CD27 + CD28 + CD127 + Bcl2 + , and markers proper of memory lymphocytes, such as CD122 + CXCR3 + CCR5 \u00b1 , and produce low levels of IFNg and Granzyme A. Further phenotypic analysis showed that cultured Na\u00efve express higher levels of c-Kit, CXCR4 and IL18R, while they express lower levels of activation markers such as HLA-DR, CD40L and CD69 compared to TCM and TEM. Althogether our protocol, when applied to sorted Na\u00efve cells, allows the generation of lymphocytes that, based on their phenotypic and functional features, are a promising target for gene and adoptive cellular therapy. We are currently investigating in vivo alloreactivity and anti-leukaemic function in humanized mice.",

Grifols (7) (1)Banc de Sang i Teixit (L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, ES); (2)Hospital Vall d'Hebron (Barcelona, ES) ; (3) Aim: To analyze variables that might infl uence the hematopoietic recovery after autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation (auto-PBPCT). Patients and methods: A total of 398 patients, 252 men and 146 women, median age 54 years (range 4-76), with multiple myeloma (42%), non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin lymphoma (40.5%), acute leukemia/myelodisplastic syndrome (13.3%), solid tumors (2%) and other (2.3%) underwent auto-PBPCT between January 2003 and August 2009. Patients were mobilized with G-CSF (92%) or with chemotherapy and G-CSF (8%). Factors potentially infl uencing the engraftment kinetics were examined using a Cox regression model. To compare continues variables the Mann-Whitney test was used. Results are expressed in median and range. Cellularity was measured before cryopreservation and colony forming cells after thawing. Results: Total nuclear cells (NC) infused was 10 \u00d7 10 8 NC/Kg (1.4-74) , mononuclear cells 7.5 \u00d7 10 8 /Kg (0.8-32), CD34 + 3 \u00d7 10 6 /Kg (1.1-56) , granulo-monocye colony forming cells (GM) 2.2 \u00d7 10 5 /Kg (0.0-14) and erythroid burst-forming and mix units (BFU-E-Mix) 8 \u00d7 10 5 /Kg (0.0-57). Cloning effi ciency (CE) per CD34 + seeded cell was 32% (0-97). Time to neutrophil recovery more than 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L and platelet count more than 20 \u00d7 10 9 /L was 11 (6-50) and 13 days (0-190), respectively. The most powerful predictors of neutrophil engraftment were the total GM/Kg infused (P = 0.003) and G-CSF administration post-infusion (P = 0.002) and of platelet engraftment, the total BFU-E-Mix/Kg infused (P = 0.01) and the infusion of more than 3 \u00d7 10 6 /Kg CD34 + cells/Kg (P = 0.02). In addition, bone marrow involvement at the time of mobilization and the diagnosis of acute leukemia had a negative impact for neutrophil (P = 0.01) and platelet recovery (P = 0.004), respectively. Additionally, when CE was inferior to 10% (n = 31), median days to neutrophil and platelet recovery was 16 and 19 days, and when CE was equal or superior to 10% (n = 365) 11 and 13, respectively, (P < 0.005). Variables not infl uencing hematological recovery in the multivariate analysis were age, sex, stage of disease, mobilization regimen, number of cycles of chemotherapy and type of conditioning regime. Conclusions: Our data suggest that total GM and BFU-E-Mix infused, in addition to CD34 + cells, may be helpful in predicting the engraftment potential after auto-PBPCT and that cloning effi ciency may be a good in vitro test for quality assessment of hematopoietic progenitor cells from cryopreserved apheresis.",

Adoptive immunotherapies with virusspecifi c cytotoxic effector T cells have been successfully used to treat or prevent viral reactivations, this approach, however, is not feasible in the high risk constellation of a CMV-positive HSCT patient and a CMV-negative stem cell donor. We have engineered human effector T cells directed to a viral protein that is expressed on the surface of lytically infected cells. A CMV glycoprotein gB specifi c chimeric immunoreceptor (cIR) was constructed and expressed in primary human T cells using lentiviral vectors or by electroporation of in vitro transcribed RNA. Such cIR-engineered T cells produced IFN-g and TNF in response to CMV infected fi broblasts, showed antigen specifi c degranulation and lysed gB expressing target cells. Redirected CMV-specifi c T cells may open a new perspective for an HLA independent adoptive immunotherapy of CMV infections in high-risk transplant recipients.",

Goulmy (1) (1)Leiden University Medical Center (Leiden, NL); DE) Minor histocompatibility antigens (mHags) are the molecular targets of the graft-versus-tumor (GvT) effect and of graft versus-host disease (GvHD) after human leukocyte antigen (HLA)matched allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). MHags are HLA-restricted polymorphic peptides expressed on normal and leukemia cells. The ubiquitously expressed mHags, e.g. H-Y, are the prime in situ targets of GvHD. Some mHags, e.g. mHag HA-1, are only expressed by human normal and malignant hematopoeitic cells and by solid tumors. Therefore, vaccination with peptides derived from hematopoiesis-restricted mHags like HA-1 may boost the GvT effect with low risk of GvHD. However, the optimal approach of mHag peptide vaccination after allogeneic SCT is still unclear. Peptides exactly refl ecting immunogeneic T-cell epitopes in HLA class I molecules (\"short peptides\", SP) can induce tolerance in some animal models potentially due to systemic antigen spreading. Peptides can spread in unbound form or directly bound to HLA molecules of circulating peripheral blood cells. Extension of the peptide length (\"long peptides\", LP) may optimize immune responses by focusing and prolonging antigen presentation on dendritic cells (DCs). Here, we compared the in vitro characteristics and T-cell stimulatory capacities of a 30-mer HA-1 LP with the SP. Activated DCs presented both the HA-1 LP and SP and expanded cytotoxic HA-1 specifi c T-cell lines. As hypothesized, HA-1 LP presentation -in contrast to SP presentation -was largely restricted to activated DCs and almost absent on other hematopoeitic cells. However, activated DCs presented the HA-1 LP 2-3 log levels less effi ciently than the SP. Finally, the decays of HA-1 LP and SP presentation on DCs were comparable. We conclude that HA-1 LP and SP show different in vitro characteristics that may translate into different effects on HA-1 specifi c immune responses in vivo. Therefore, only comparative clinical studies after allogeneic SCT may reveal the optimal HA-1 vaccine.",

Heijhuurs, V. Marcu-Malina, D. van Baarle, J. Kuball UMC Utrecht (Utrecht, NL) Introduction: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is substantially hampered by GvHD, infections like CMV and relapse of disease. Gamma delta T cells (gdT cells) seem to be important in virus control but also in malignancy control by MHC independent recognition of antigens up regulated on stressed cells, however they do not mediate GvHD. In particular CMV infections are associated with an increased expansion of gdT cells, expressing the Vd1 chain. Therefore, we investigated frequency and function of gdT cells after allo-SCT in order to assess their therapeutic potential. Methods: PBMCs at time points within 3 months after allo-SCT of 17 patients were sampled. CMV viral load was monitored by real-time PCR. Phenotype and frequency of gdT cells and alpha beta T cells (abT cells) were analyzed by fl ow cytometry. Two patients with CMV reactivation were selected and gdT cells were isolated and expanded from time points before, during and after CMV reactivation. Two patients without CMV reactivation were used as controls. Frequency and clonality of Vd1 + , Vd2 + and Vd3 + gdT cells were measured with spectratyping. The reactivity against CMV AD169 infected fi broblasts, uninfected fi broblasts and primary AML blasts of Vd2-and Vd2 + gdT cells was tested using an IFN-g ELISPOT. Results: We observed an increased polyclonal expansion of specifi cally Vd1 + gdT-cells after allo-SCT in patients during CMV reactivation and contraction after resolution as assessed by fl ow cytometry and spectratyping. Furthermore Vd1 + but not Vd2 + T-cells from these patients reacted against CMV AD169 infected fi broblasts, but not against uninfected fi broblasts. This suggests that Vd1 + gdT-cells have the potential to dampen CMV infection after allo-SCT. Moreover, following pp65-reactive abT cells in HLA-A2 + patients indicated that Vd1 + gdT cells precede an abT-cell response. Finally, selectively Vd2 + gdT cells had the potential to recognize primary leukemic blasts, but only in the presence of pamidronate, a phosphoantigen stimulating agent. Conclusion: GdT cells are present in patients after allo-SCT, have the potential to eradicate CMV infected fi broblasts and maybe the potential to spread an immune response to abT cells. Furthermore Vd2 + gdT cells have the potential to recognize primary AML blasts. This strongly supports the idea to explore gdT cells as cell population for immune interventions after allo-SCT and the application of pamidronate post allo-SCT in patients suffering from AML.",

Kwon, P. Balsalobre, D. Serrano, J. Gayoso, I. Bu\u00f1o, A. Perez Corral, J. Anguita, J.L. Diez-Martin Gregorio Mara\u00f1on G. U. Hospital (Madrid, ES) Umbilical cord blood transplantation (CBT) with the co-infusion of CD34 + cells from a non-HLA-identical donor (dual SCT) has shown to reduce the period of posttransplant neutropenia and related early morbidity and mortality of single CBT. We describe the main clinical results of this strategy in our institution, and compared them with those of single CBT. Methods: Fourteen patients (pts) underwent dual SCT from March-04 to June-09, and 8 pts received a single CBT between September-06 and December-07. All patients had high-risk hematologic malignancies (Table 1) . Results: There were no signifi cant differences between age, sex, HLA disparities, median of transplanted cells, and pre-SCT status between both groups. However, a higher proportion of patients in the single CBT group received more than 1 line of therapy before SCT. Engraftment was reached sooner in the dual SCT group (P = 0.03, Table 2 ). One dual SCT pt showed primary graft failure and received successfully a second dual SCT, and another showed CB failure but engraftment of the third party donor. One pt of the single CBT group showed graft failure rescued by a haploindentical donor. No GvHD \u2265 grade III were present in any group. Relevant infectious complications were more frecuent in the single CB group, including mortality associated in 3 cases. OS and DFS for the dual group were 66% and 50% respectively (Figures)with a median follow-up of 39 months (5-60). The cumulative relapse incidence was 50%, and all the relapses occured within the fi rst year posttransplantation (one of the relapsed pts underwent successfully an unrelated SCT). OS for the single CBT group was 12%, with a median time to death of 7 months (1-23 months). Remarkably, NRM was 7% for the dual group and 75% for the single CB group. Conclusions: In our experience, CBT with co-infusion of CD34 + cells from a third party donor showed to be a safe strategy for patients with no available donor. Remarkably, NRM mortality rate was very low in this group, especially compared to the single CB group. More cases and a longer follow-up are needed to assess the causes of these differences, including worse pre-SCT status of the single cord group and/or shorter period of neutropenia in the dual group.",

Topp (1) (1)Universtity Hospital (Wurzburg, DE); (2)Arzt f\u00fcr Neurologie und Psychatrie (Wurzburg, DE) Background: Paraproteinemic neuropathies (PN) represent a heterogenous group of peripheral nerve disorders. Current treatment options include immune-modulating approaches with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), plasmapheresis, immunosuppression, e.g. with corticosteroids or cyclophosphamide. A subset of patients remains refractory to these treatment modalities. We describe four patients with progessive PN despite various treatment attempts who underwent an intensifi ed immunosuppressive regimen with high-dose melphalan (HD-Mel) therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Methods: As induction therapy one cycle of cyclophosphamid (1-3 g/m 2 \u00b1 etoposid 200 mg/m 2 ) was given and stem cells were collected after several days of GCSF stimulation. High-dose melphalan (HD-Mel) (between 150 mg and 200 mg abs.) was administered on day 1 and 2 with consecutive ASCT on day 4. One patient received a second course of HD-Mel and ASCT. Responses were assessed including clinical and electrophysiological examination. Results: All patients suffered from severe disabling neuropathies associated with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined signifi cance (MGUS) and failed to respond to various immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive treatments. Remarkably, pretreatment in two of the four patients even included immunoselective B-cell depleting therapy with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (Rituximab). All patients with a follow-up of up to 46 months showed sustained clinical and electrophysiological recovery after ASCT. 3 patients with previous tetraparesis and wheel-chair dependency and 1 patient with severely limiting distal prevailing hypesthesia are now able to work again, in part in their former jobs. All patients had uncomplicated peri-transplant periods. Conclusion: We conclude that high-dose therapy with melphalan and ASCT, under strict patient selection and monitoring, may be an experimental treatment option in very severe forms of treatment-refractory progressive PN. A prospective multicenter trial is warranted to substantiate these observations. J. Mattsson (1) , J. Gertow (1) , M. Okas (1) , S. Berglund (1) , L. Henningsohn (2) , O. Gustavsson (2) , M. Uhlin (1) (1)Centre for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (Stockholm, SE); (2)Dept of Urology (Stockholm, SE) Therapies for localized prostate cancer include curative surgery and radiotherapy while treatment for metastatic disease is palliative and based on depriving the tumor cells of their androgen stimulation that reduces tumor growth rate. Therefore, we started to investigate the potential of allogeneic SCT as a treatment for non-curable prostate cancer. Two patients underwent allogeneic SCT with PBSC from HLAidentical sisters after a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen as treatment for metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma. Frequencies of prostate-specifi c T cells in the peripheral blood of the patients, sibling donors and a group of control individuals were determined by fl ow cytometry using tetrameric and pentameric HLA A2 complexes containing peptides derived from the prostate specifi c antigen (PSA). Cytotoxic activity of PSApeptide-specifi c T-cells against peptide-pulsed target cells was analyzed ex vivo by 51Cr-release assays. Stable clinical and laboratory remission lasting for more than 4 years was observed after SCT for the fi rst transplanted patient. The patient is now 6.5 years after SCT but now slowly increasing in PSA indiacting tumor progression. The PSA level is today 12 ng/mL. The second patient has decreased in PSA from 257 ng/mL before SCT to 70 ng/mL and without clinical signs of progression one year after SCT. Both patients are doing clinically excellent and have a good quality of life. In the second patient a dramatic increase was detected in PSA levels during development of GVHD. After treatment of GVHD the PSA levels decreased continuously. We believe that the sudden increase of PSA was due to an antitumor attack of prostatespecifi c T cells indicating a graft-versus-tumor effect. Using HLA containing pentamers with PSA-derived peptides we could detect prostate-specifi c CD8 + T cells in both patients in high frequencies over several months. Furthermore, higher frequencies of PSA-specifi c T-cells were revealed in the peripheral blood of the patients and female controls as compared with male healthy controls. Our data suggest that allogeneic SCT led to the generation of a T cell mediated prostate-specifi c immunity in both patients. The in vitro and ex vivo immunological monitoring performed indicate an adjuvant anti-tumor effect of PSA-specifi c T cells. This report presents a novel treatment approach involving allogeneic SCT in prostate cancer patients who do not respond to chemotherapy and/or cannot undergo prostectomy.",

Garnier Registre France Greffe de Moelle, Agence de la Biom\u00e9decine (Paris, FR) Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can cure patients with malignant and non malignant haematological diseases. Only about 30% of them have a suitable family donor. Therefore, a full HLA-matched unrelated donor (UD) should be found out through national and international registries for those patients who lack a suitable donor. Various levels of HLA polymorphism could argue for further diffi culty for those recipients to fi nd a compatible donor. A comparative retrospective study of HLA characteristics of the patients who did and did not fi nd a full-HLA matched donor or CBU was performed. Method: Between 2000 and 2007, 772 recipients, were \"not transplanted because of the absence of an HLA-compatible donor worldwide\" (status double-checked with transplantation centres). An extensive analysis of their HLA phenotypes was performed, by comparing them to 3,123 patients transplanted with full-HLA matched UD over the same time frame. Estimated haplotype frequencies for HLA-A -B -C -DRB1 -DQB1 from both the French UD (Low Res.) Registry, and the 4 various ethnic backgrounds haplotype frequencies (High Res., (data available at http://bioinformatics.nmdp.org website) were used. A \"qualitative\" analysis consisted of checking that each HLA recipient phenotype was found among all possible pairwise combination of 2 haplotypes of the different sets of haplotypes. Various \"quantitative\" analyses calculated the likelihood associated to each recipient phenotype for a given set of HLA genes, in a given population, at low versus high resolution typing. Results: 1-HLA-C was shown to be the major contributor for HLA rareness in non transplanted patients. The most signifi cant difference found between transplanted and non transplanted patients correlates with the introduction of HLA-C in the likelihood model (median: 8.6e-6 vs. 1.1e-6 P < 0.0001). 2-Ethnic background/ancestry based analysis, also provide a framework for assessment of patient's chance to fi nd a donor. Frequent HLA phenotypes of transplanted patients are consistently found among these different backgrounds (P < 0.001). Discussion: The HLA rareness of non-transplanted patients can be categorised in several groups: Type of allele resolution, extended loci typing such as HLA-C and non causasians haplotypes are the main sources of rareness. The use of haplotype frequencies to identify rare HLA phenotypes, underlines the interest of haplotype-based computations for a prospective analysis as implemented by Haplologic and Optimatch.",

We aimed to study the immediate and long-term side effects (SE) in pediatric donors. Participants donated BM between 1968 and 2002 in the pediatric transplant unit in Leiden. Inclusion criteria were: younger than 13 yrs at donation, minimum follow up of 5 yrs and at least 12 yrs at study entry. Self reporting questionnaires were used. Surviving recipients acted as controls (n = 43). Of 204 eligible donors, 145 were invited of whom 54% (n = 79) responded ( Figure I) . Additionally, 196 case fi les were used to record immediate post donation SE. At donation 13 children had previous medical conditions (congenital heart disease n = 3; prematurity n = 6; hypothyroidism n = 1; neurological n = 2; hepatomegaly n = 1). These were not considered contraindications to donation. An average 18 mls BM/kg/donor weight was harvested (range 6-47 ml) with signifi cant hemaglobin loss (mean 1,58 mmols/ L; SD = 0.46; P = 0.000). Forty-fi ve percent of the children were exposed to donor blood transfusion. From self reports, 91% considered themselves healthy. Twenty one reported one or more health issues since donation (cardiovascular n = 3; respiratory n = 14; auto immune n = 2; epilepsy n = 2; anemia n = 2; psychological n = 2; fatigue n = 5; persistent back pain n = 2). The mean total score of the General Health Questionnaire did not differ signifi cantly from the healthy adult Dutch population. With the Short Form 36 Health Survey, all donors showed signifi cantly higher raw scores in the subdomains than the healthy Dutch population (Figure 2 ). Body Mass Index (BMI) was classifi ed by age and sex. In donors where the BMI was available pre-donation the underweight index has doubled. Only 3% of donors were morbidly obese in contrast to the general Dutch population. Participants < 18 with a living recipient scored high on the health related quality of life \"physical health\" domain (P = 0.025). There was no correlation between donor and recipient scores. Our results show that young children both in the immediate and long term physically tolerate BM donation. In parallel to this study psychosocial evaluation is ongoing. In contrast to adults, nearly half receive blood products following donation, directly related to the amount of marrow harvested. Presently no specifi c guidelines in relation to donation in young children have been established. Our results are important in the development of such recommendations.",

We studied the schooling and employment of adults who had donated BM as a child. Inclusion criteria: less than 13 yrs at donation, minimum follow up of 5 yrs and at least 12 yrs at study entry. All were admitted from 1968 to 2002 in our pediatric department. Self reported Course of Life questionnaires were used. Surviving recipients acted as controls (n = 44). Of 204 potential donors, 145 available donors were invited, of whom 54% responded. Donor and recipient gender was 44% M: 56% F. Donors mean age was 23 yrs (range 12-47) and recipients mean 22 yrs (range 10-38). Age at donation/BMT was the same for donors as recipients (mean 6.9 yrs range 0.6-12 and 0.6-15.8 resp.). Results of donor and recipient education were compared to Dutch population norms (Statistics Netherlands). Data was available in 77 donors who were/had attended secondary school. These were: 1st stage secondary (higher academic); 2nd stage secondary (academic) and vocational training. Over 50% of donors were/had attended higher level secondary education (n = 52), which exceeds the Dutch norm. Of 44 recipients 38% achieved this level, more consistent with the Dutch norm. Most donors (95%) were employed full time with 30% (n = 19/59) involved in medicine, teaching, child care or science, compared to 17% of recipients. More donors (17%) were involved in physically demanding work, compared to only 2% of the recipients. Educational achievement was high in our donor group. The results may be biased by the number of non-responders, and not refl ect the group as a whole. However the differences from Dutch norms are so great that we can at least conclude children acting as donors were not disadvantaged in the Dutch system. Many child donors later follow a \"caring\" profession compared to recipient siblings. This may refl ect their involvement in the donation process. Recipients are less likely to be involved in physical work, which may be health related. These results need to be confi rmed in prospective studies but are encouraging as to the long term social effects of childhood BM donation.",

A few years ago, we split responsibilities for donor search and patient care, as it preserves donor independence. The search is thus carried out by a transplant coordinator center (TCC) at the cell therapy facility, and starts with construction of a family tree: unless obvious exclusion criterions exist, siblings contact the TCC in order to organize blood drawn for HLA typing. Disposables and instructions are sent to the laboratory of their choice and samples are then shipped to the same histocompatibility laboratory that performs HLA typing for our transplantation program. Conclusion of the family study is communicated to the patient as a basic information (you have or not a sibling donor). The whole process is monitored by the TCC using a database accessible by the transplant team. Between 2006 and 2008, 552 family trees were received, and 511 family studies were initiated. 1 460 siblings did contact the TCC, and 79% were considered suitable for HLA typing. 12% of siblings were not typed because of the patient disease evolution, 7% because of a medical contraindication to donation and 2% declined donation. An HLA-identical sibling was identifi ed for 216 of the 552 patients (39%). 112 of the 216 identifi ed siblings underwent consecutive stem cell collection, and 104 were not collected, mainly for reasons associated with the patient (85%): unfavourable evolution of the disease (37%), loss of HSCT indication (28%), patient's refusal of HSCT (13%), or contraindication for HSCT (7%); only 16/216 HLA-identical siblings were not collected because of reasons associated with the donor, either contraindication (13) or late refusal of donation (3). Ultimately, from the 552 patient's families explored, 20% (112) continued to HSCT from a sibling. The median time necessary to identify a donor was 40 days, and identifi cation occurred 120 days (median) before stem cell collection. We conclude that the process that leads to the identifi cation of an HLA-compatible sibling can be conducted within a delay that is compatible with the organization of an HSCT, provided that the process is initiated early enough. Anticipation is especially important for those patients for whom no HLA-compatible sibling will be identifi ed, as a second search may then be initiated in order to identify an unrelated donor or cord blood unit(s).",

Michelis, J. Apostolidis, N. Harhalakis, C. Papasteriades, E. Nikiforakis Evangelismos Hospital (Athens, GR) The main determinants of the outcome of unrelated donor stem cell transplantation (URD-SCT) are disease phase and HLA compatibility. Donor selection is currently based on the degree of matching at the HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1 loci. Few studies have addressed the role of HLA-DPB1 implicating allelic or alloreactive T cell epitope (TCE) mismatch in acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), relapse, or survival. We retrospectively analyzed the infl uence of DPB1 mismatch on the outcome of URD-SCT performed in our center. From 01/1994 to 04/2009, 108 patients underwent URD-SCT for hematologic malignancies. In 74 cases, HLA-DPB1 alleles were retrospectively typed in donor and recipient. The median age of patients was 35 years (range, 15-62). The disease phase at transplant was early in 23, intermediate in 16, and advanced in 35 patients. Forty-six patients received myeloablative and 28 reduced-intensity conditioning. The graft source was mainly peripheral blood (n = 65). In vivo T-cell depletion (ATG or CAM-PATH-1H) was undertaken in only 16 cases. Donor selection was based on allele compatibility at HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1, without considering -DPB1. The outcomes were analyzed in relation to transplant-related mortality (TRM), acute and chronic GvHD, relapse, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Risk factors included in the multivariate analysis were age and CMV-status of donor and recipient, disease phase, type of conditioning regimen, degree of compatibility at HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1 and/or -DQB1 (i.e. out of 8 or 10 alleles), as well as mismatch at DPB1. Donors were matched at 10/10 and 8/8 alleles in 27 and 34 cases, respectively. DPB1 compatibility was noted only in 7 transplants. In 58 cases, DPB1 mismatch in the GvH direction was found. OS was associated with disease phase and compatibility (HR: 2.37 and 0.47, P = 0.047 and 0.06, respectively). Allelic DPB1 mismatch in the GvH direction emerged as an independent factor for relapse (HR: 0.23, P = 0.006) and DFS (HR: 0.31, P = 0.01). A favorable effect was also observed with non-permissive TCE mismatch on relapse and DFS (HR: 0.28 and 0.47, P = 0.02 and 0.049, respectively). The incidence of acute or chronic GvHD, TRM, and OS were not affected by DPB1 mismatch. HLA-DPB1 incompatibility is common in URD-SCT and seems to enhance the graft-versus-tumor (GvT) effect. DPB1 mismatch in the GvH direction may be relevant in donor selection for patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies.",

Ematologia con Trapianto (Reggio Calabria, IT) Apheresis is a special collection procedure in which peripheral hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) are separated from the other parts of the blood and returned to the patient/donor. Collection of HPC by apheresis machines takes approximately three-four hours and it' s generally regarded as a safe procedure. However, data about adverse events in HPC harvesting are scarce. The data of HPC collections in a period of 14 years in healthy donors (HDs), mobilized using G-CSF, were reviewed . A total of 211 HDs (92 female, 119 male, median age 43.8 years, range 15-70) underwent 422 HPC harvests. We used the Fresenius, Bad Homburg, Germany, AS 204 and COM.TEC cell separators for continuous fl ow centrifugation. HDs-related side effects was observed in the 23.7% of procedures. The most frequents side effects were mild (17.1%), especially paresthesias due to anticoagulant-citrate toxicity (15.2%). Paresthesias were treated by oral or intravenous calcium supplementation. Problems with venous access have been rare (1.2%), resulting in blood fl ow alarms and blockades in the return line and 10 procedures had to be discontinued for this reason. 14 HDs experienced gastrointestinal troubles (vomiting/nausea). Mild bleeding at the site of venipuncture was observed in 2 HDs. Severe side-effects were described in 15 procedures (3.3%). Severe hypotension with faintness has been reported in 8 donors; a state of clinical hypocalcemia was observed in 6 HDs; 1 apheresis had to be discontinued because the HD presented chest pain and mild dyspnea and the computerised tomography showed a pulmonary microembolism. Following the development of side effects, 22 HDs required hospitalization (10.4%).",

The two groups were well balanced for age, body weight and sex. G-CSF application was performed on an out-patient basis and leukapheresis was started in all donors on day 5. The side effects of G-CSF were signifi cantly higher in the group with one daily injection (mild to moderate bone pain, P = 0.004; mild fatigue, P = 0.000; mild splenomegaly, P = 0.015).

There was no statistically signifi cant difference in the apheresis yield of CD34 + HPC ( \u00d7 10 6 ) collected on day 5 (464 vs. 434, P = 0.6) and per liters of blood processed. Our data suggest that both Lenograstim administration schedules are similarly effective for the mobilization and collection of CD34 + HPC in normal donors, at least when daily leukapheresis begins on day 5 of Lenograstim mobilization.",

Martino, A. Dattola, C. Garreffa, G. Console, G. Irrera, G. Messina, R. Fedele, P. Iacopino U.O. Ematologia con Trapianto (Reggio Calabria, IT) We conduct a prospective study to identify clinically signifi cant factors that could infl uence the effectiveness of CD34 + cell mobilization and collection in healthy donors after administration of lenograstim. A total of 35 consecutive fi rst-time normal donors received lenograstim before leukapheresis for collection of HPC-A for allogeneic transplantation. Donors received G-CSF subcutaneously at a median (range) dose of 10 (8-13) \u03bcg/kg. HPC collections were started on day 5, i.e., after four days of lenograstim in every donor. Five different determinations of CD34 + cells were done in each donor: First, baseline CD34 + cell count (before G-CSF administration); second, third and fourth, enumeration of CD34 + cells in peripheral blood on day 3, 4 and on the morning of collection (after G-CSF); fi nally the number of CD34 + cells in the apheresis bag (CD34 + cells collected). The total number of CD34 + cells/\u03bcL in peripheral blood on the fi rst day of apheresis (after G-CSF administration) was used to evaluate the effectiveness of mobilization. This variable was examined separately by linear regression analysis against independent variables (sex, age, weight, dose of G-CSF, white cell count, hemoglobin, platelet S309 count, and CD34 + cell count). In a second step, logistic regression analysis was done to determine the variables infl uencing the number of CD34 + cells collected/kg of donor body weight (< 5 vs. > 5 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg). The independent variables analyzed in this step were the same as those in the previous one with the addition of the volume of blood processed (normal vs. Large Volume Leukapheresis). As concerns mobilization of CD34 + cells, the median number of CD34 + cells in peripheral blood on the day of the apheresis was 74 \u03bcL (range, 9-240). By univariate analysis, no variables correlated with the number of CD34 + cells in the peripheral blood the day of apheresis. The median number of CD34 + cells collected in the whole series was 5.6 \u00d7 10 6 /kg (range, 0.8-14) and a CD34 + cell count > 5 \u00d7 10 6 /kg was obtained in 23 cases. The donor's weight (P = 0.025), volemia (P = 0.023) and number of CD34 + on day 4 (P = 0.016) were the only variable that signifi cantly correlated with the number of CD34 + cells/ kg collected (>5 \u00d7 10 6 /kg). Multivariate analysis didn't not show any correlations. Our study confi rms that some donors are poor responders to G-CSF, but we didn't fi nd signifi cant predictive clinical factors for the apheresis yield of CD34 + cells.",

Mirabile (1) Material and methods: The criteria for MUD selection are: a 8/8 HLA loci matching tested at low resolution for class I and at high resolution (HR) for class II HLA; one difference of C Ag is accepted in case of both class I and II identity defi ned at HR. Criteria for CB selection are based on cell dose (TNC>2.5 \u00d7 10 7 / kg and CD34 + >1 \u00d7 10 5 /kg) and on a compatibility \u2265 4/6 HLA loci. From April 2006, the haplodentical option was also simultaneously considered for all candidates, so all closer family members have been tested for HLA. Here, we report the results of a transplant policy based on the intention to treat (ITT) for patients registered in the RTN database. Results: From April 2006 to September 2009, 236 patients have been candidate to receive an allogeneic HSCT for hematological disease. Eighty-fi ve out of 236 (36%) underwent HSCT from HLA identical sibling, while a search process for an alternative donor was activated for 140 patients. Of these140 patients, 40 were not transplanted: 23 died in most cases because of early disease progression, 5 withdrew the consent and in 5 cases, despite an alternative donor could be identifi ed within 3 months, the search process was temporary discontinued due to clinical causes . A suitable alternative donor was not found in only 7 (5%) cases. To date, 100/140 (71%) evaluable patients lacking an HLA identical sibling have been transplanted (n = 85: 27 MUD; 34 CBU; 24 HRD) or are willing to proceed towards the transplant (n = 15). In summary, for all 236 candidates to an allogeneic transplant the eligibility was confi rmed for 225 (95%), a suitable donor was identifi ed for 218 (92%) of all patients and an allogeneic transplant could be performed for 185/225 (82%) of those eligible. Conclusions: From this ITT analysis, we can conclude that, by adopting the RTN policy of widespread donor search and multiple transplant options, the allogeneic transplant can be offered as potential therapeutic procedure to a large majority of patients.",

Niederwieser, N. Basara University of Leipzig (Leipzig, DE) Introduction: The standard procedure for obtaining peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) is mobilization with G-CSF given s.c. BID for 4-5 days. Pegfi lgrastim is a covalently bound conjugate of G-CSF and mono-methoxypolyethylene glycol, making it a larger molecule of approximately 39 kDa with a longer half-life due to decreased plasma clearance. In the current study we investigated the administration of a single-dose Pegfi lgrastim for mobilization of CD34 + cells for stem cell transplantation from healthy donors. Material and methods: From July 2006 to August 2009, 28 related healthy donors (50% male) were treated with a single dose of 12 mg Pegfi lgrastim for the mobilization of PBSC. The harvests were performed as large-volume, continuous-fl ow collections using a Cobe Spectra blood cell separator on day 4 and if necessary on day 5 after pegfi lgrastim. In case of inadequate CD34 + counts (less than 4 \u00d7 10 6 /kg recipient body weight on day 5), stimulation was continued with fi lgrastim. In addition, the serum level of fi lgrastim was determined twice daily in 15 of the 28 donors. Results: Suffi cient PBSC were harvested from all 28 donors. In 22 (79%) of them, a single apheresis was required to reach the target of 4 \u00d7 10 6 /kg recipient body weight and two of the donors required additional treatment with fi lgrastim. The maximal concentration of circulating CD34 + cells was achieved on day + 4 with a median of 67,5 (range 24.6-136.6) CD34 + /\u03bcl followed by a decrease on day + 5 to 52,1 (range 24.6-136.6) CD34 + /\u03bcl. The median yield was 5,9 (range 3-14.5) \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + /kg recipient body weight and 3.25 (range 1.4-6.2 ) \u00d7 10 8 CD3 + /kg recipient body weight. Serum pegfi lgrastim levels peaked on day 2 after administration with a median of 226 (range 35 to 1123) ng/ml preceding the increase of CD34 + cells in the peripheral blood. The main adverse events were WHO grade 1 including headaches, bone pain and transient elevations of alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase. Conclusion: PBSC mobilization with a single dose of pegfi lgrastim is feasible in healthy donors and represents an interesting alternative to G-CSF. The graft composition was comparable to that resulting from a conventional regimen using short term G-CSF stimulation. Further studies will include a long term follow up of healthy donors treated with pegfi lgrastim. S310 3/106 (3%) had a heart murmur on examination; on echocardiography 2 were normal and 1 was confi rmed as having moderate mixed aortic valve disease with a bicuspid aortic valve. 5/106 (5%) had an elevated blood pressure; 3 requiring initiation of therapy. 4/106 (4%) were found to have microscopic haematuria; 3 had a positive urine culture and 1 with a negative urine culture had no abnormality on urological review. 37/106 (35%) had abnormal blood results: -9/106 (9%) showed mild elevations in gamma-glutamyl transferase; improved with alcohol abstention -9/106 (9%) pre-menopausal women were iron defi cient; 4 were mildly anaemic -4/106 (4%) showed isolated elevated bilirubin levels consistent with Gilbert's syndrome -3/106 (3%) showed a raised haematocrit secondary to lifestyle factors -3/106 (3%) were diagnosed with a new malignancy; 2 myelodysplasia, 1 monoclonal gammopathy -2/106 (2%) were hypothyroid; 1 requiring therapy -7/106 (8%) showed either a raised APTR (no evidence of lupus anticoagulant/clotting factor defi ciency), a raised prostate specifi c antigen (normal prostatic biopsy), a raised ferritin (haemochromatosis carrier on testing), low B12, alpha-1antitrypsin defi ciency, absolute Immunoglobulin A defi ciency or both raised triglycerides and a fatty liver 42/106 (40%) had a chest x-ray performed; all were normal 56/106 (53%) had an electrocardiograph performed of which 7 were abnormal (5 left ventricular hypertrophy, 1 each of either left or right bundle branch block). Conclusions: A variety of asymptomatic medical conditions were diagnosed during assessment for stem cell donation. 17/106 (16%) had further investigation after the initial assessment and 11/106 (10%) required treatment and/or on-going follow-up for their newly identifi ed condition. Apart from the recognised benefi ts of being a sibling stem cell donor, in a small but signifi cant number of donors, a major medical condition may be diagnosed and treated with a subsequent potential improvement in the donor's lifespan.",

Yesilipek Akdeniz University School of Medicine (Antalya, TR) Introduction: The use of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) as a source of stem cells has greatly increased and the studies adressing normal pediatric donor collection effi cacy is very limited. The main objective of this paper is to document our own experience as a single center experience and to yield predictive factors for PBSC collection in pediatric donors. Methods: Datas of all allogeneic PBSC pediatric donor apheresis performed to be used in transplantation for children in our institution were retrospectively collected.The factors affecting CD34 + cell collection being more than 2 \u00d7 10 6 kg recipient body weight were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: A total of 151 apheresis performed in 101 pediatric (49 males, 52 females) donors were included in this study. The mean values for ages and weights were 10 years (range: 2-18 years) and 35,4 kg (range 11-84 kg) respectively. Sixty -three donors in pediatric age group (62%) underwent only one apheresis. 63% of the pediatric donor apheresis were done via a dual lumen catheter and 54% of the apheresis were done as large volume leukapheresis. Eighty-fi ve out of 151 pediatric donor apheresis provided CD 34 + cell count more than 2 \u00d7 10 6 /kg recipient body weight. The median number of CD34 + cells \u00d7 10 6 / kg recipient body weight in the fi rst apheresis was 3.99 (range: 0.03-33) whereas it was 1.95 (range:0.3-17.25 ) in the second one (P < 0.05). On univariate analysis, we found that the factors affecting to reach this amount of target cell were: donor weight (P = 0.041), donor to recipient weight ratio(P < 0.001), fi rst day of apheresis (P = 0.015), baseline WBC count (P = 0.012), peripheral blood CD 34 + cell count (P < 0.001) and decrease in hemoglobin level of the donor after procedure (P = 0.008) in that donors with a more decrease in hemoglobin levels were those who yielded higher numbers of CD34 + cells. In multivariate analysis, donor to recipient weight ratio (P = 0.01), fi rst day of apheresis (P = 0.04), and decrease in hemoglobin level of the donor after procedure (P = 0.01) were found to be signifi cant predictors of yield. Conclusion: In this small preliminary study, we found that the variables that infl uenced the yield were the donor to recipient weight ratio, the fi rst day of apheresis and decrease in hemoglobin levels of donors. Further validation of these fi ndings in larger series will help to optimize stem cell yields.",

Szydlo Imperial College / Hammersmith Hospital (London, UK) In July 2003 a comprehensive database was initiated to register and follow the progress of unrelated donor (UD) searches in a large transplant centre based in London. From 01/01/2004 to 31/12/2008, searches were commenced for 193 patients (125 M/ 68 F). The underlying diseases were CML (n = 99, 51%) Acute Leukaemia (n = 39, 20%) and other (n = 56, 29%). 139 patients (72%) were Caucasian, 15(8%) African/Caribbean, 24(12%) Asian and 15(8%) other. A total of 149 donors were identifi ed, 107 fully matched at high resolution HLA-A, B, Cw and DR (8/8), 31 with 7/8 matches and 11 at 6/8. The median time taken to fi nd a donor was 3.4m (range 1-55) , with a median number of 7 donor samples tested (tissue-typed) (range 1-20). Of the 149 patients with a donor identifi ed, 61 received an SCT from an UD, 72 are alive and on treatment (median time from donor identifi cation 25m (range 1-68)), and 16 have died. 44 patients had no UD identifi ed -of these, 17 patients received a non-UD SCT, 10 searches are on hold, 5 unsuccessful searches have closed, 3 searches are still ongoing, and 9 patients have died. Donors were identifi ed for 120 (86%) Caucasian patients but only 29 (54%) non-Caucasian patients (P = 0.0001). There was no statistical difference in the degree of matching (P = 0.70), the number of searches carried out (P = 0.97), nor the duration of the search period (P = 0.38) between donors found for Caucasian and non-Caucasian patients. Donors were identifi ed from registries in the UK n = 66 (44%), Germany n = 25 (17%), USA n = 45 (30%) and from 9 other countries n = 13 (9%). The value of Bone Marrow Donors Worldwide (BMDW) is thus highlighted, as is the discrepancy in donor availability between Caucasian and non-Caucasian patients.",

Shyr (1) , K.L. Yang (2) (1)Tzu-Chi General Hospital (Hualien, TW); TW) Occasionally, unrelated hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) donors may be asked to provide subsequent donations of stem cells or lymphocytes. In this study, we evaluated the frequency of and reasons for a second donation and whether donors prefer peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection or bone marrow (BM) harvest. In addition, we compared the yields of and side effects associated with twice BM harvests. Donor characteristics, reasons for the second donation, type of second donation, and yield of BM stem cell product were abstracted from medical records. The psychosocial and physical experiences of donors who underwent two different HSC collection procedures (BM and PBSC) and their preference for one procedure over the other were collected via a self-reported questionnaire. Among donors who underwent two BM harvests, we compared the yields of and the side effects associated with the fi rst and second harvest. Among the 1738 donors analyzed, 72 had made more than one donation. The procedures included lymphocyte donations in 55 donors, BM harvest in 9 donors, and PBSC collection in 8 donors. A total of 13 donors under-went both BM and PBSC donations and 4 donors underwent two BM harvests. The median recovery time associated with PBSC (1 day) was signifi cantly shorter than that associated with BM harvest (7 days) (P = 0.0083). Although most of the donors who underwent both procedures felt that BM harvest was more physically demanding, caused more pre-procedural anxiety, was more time consuming, and was more inconvenient than PBSC collection, 63.6% of them preferred BM donation. There was no signifi cant difference in yield of stem cells between the fi rst and second BM harvests (P = 0.25 ). In addition, there were no signifi cant differences in the incidence of side effects or recovery time between the fi rst and second BM donation. Approximately 30% (5/15) of the donors had diffi culty before agreeing to donate HSC a second time. Among the 17 donors, 10 encountered disagreement from their relatives or friends. Although the case number in our study is relatively small, more donors' preference for BM harvest over PBSC collection is different from that reported in previous studies despite similar side effects. Discomfort of PBSC apheresis procedure can explain this result partially. Further understand of the donors` preference and donation side effects might help the registry improving their work.",

Beck University of Jena (Jena, DE) Background: High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation is an established procedure in the treatment of oncological diseases in childhood. Because of the extracorporeal blood volume the collection of the peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) with apheresis procedures is diffi cult in small children. Patients and Methods: We analyzed the apheresis results from 36 children whose weight less than 20 kg (range 7-20 kg) and had an average blood volume of 1244 ml (range 591-2000 ml). The collection of the PBSC was performed with the Cobe Spectra PBSC System. The extracorporeal blood volume in the system is about 285 ml, and so priming the system with an erythrocyte/plasma concentrate was necessary in most cases to prevent hypotensive dysregulations. Results: Overall we performed 47 stem cell mobilizations with 89 apheresis (average 1,89). In the middle we started the collection after 8,2 days of cytokine (G-CSF) stimulation. On the fi rst day of collection the mean blood stem cell (CD34) count was 43,7/\u03bcl. The average yield of collected CD34 was 8,9 \u00d7 10 6 / kg bodyweight. In 27 of 36 patients (75%) we reached a CD34 yield about 2 \u00d7 10 6 /kg with the fi rst mobilization. When second and third mobilization was performed all patients reached the expected stem cell count. The apheresis procedure was well tolerated and no critical side effects occurred. Conclusion: Also for small children with low blood volume we fi nd good overall results for the collection of stem cell in childhood malignancies. The priming of the extracorporeal system prevents hypotensive dysregulations. When the fi rst collection was insuffi cient the second and third stem cell mobilization/collection can be more effective. Mobilization and collection of PBSC from small children are save, well tolerated and best performed in children specialized apheresis centres.",

Rosner, F. St\u00f6lzel, K. Zimmer, M. Bornh\u00e4user, G. Ehninger University Hospital Dresden (Dresden, DE) Background: Engraftment and outcome after allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation are closely related to the dosage of CD 34 + cells in the graft. Until now, \"poor mobilizers\" among allogeneic donors remain diffi cult to identify 'a priori' and alternative salvage mobilizing agents would be highly desirable. Methods: We report on 4 allogeneic female donors (age 25-70 a) who did not respond suffi ciently to our standard mobilization protocol (G-CSF, lenograstim 7.5-10 \u03bcg/kg 5 days). Plerixafor was administered within a compassionate use programme during a 2nd course of stem cell mobilization on day 4 (10 p.m.) at a dosage of 240 \u03bcg/kg in 2 donors. In the other 2 donors plerixafor was administrated during the 1st course of stem cell mobilization at 10 p.m. on day 5 because of a very low stem cell yield after the 1st apheresis. Written informed consent was obtained from all participating individuals. 2 grafts underwent T-cell depletion because of HLA-mismatch. Recipients (3 males, 1 female) suffered from acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n = 2), high-grade non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Results: Apheresis yields with G-CSF alone and after administration of G-CSF and plerixafor are shown in table 1. The amount of CD 34 + cells collected could be enhanced by 167% to 300% by the addition of plerixafor. All donors reported only mild or no side effects after receiving plerixafor. All 4 recipients had been transplanted with these grafts and showed timely and sustained trilineage engraftment. Conclusion: Our preliminary data suggest that the administration of G-CSF and plerixafor may be a successful and well-tolerated regimen for PBSC mobilization in allogeneic donors who do not achieve a given CD34 + PBSC target with G-CSF alone. The stem and progenitor cells obtained by this strategy seem to have a high engraftment potential. This novel approach could possibly avoid graft failure in the recipients and the need for bone marrow collection in poor mobilizing allogeneic donors and should therefore be further evaluated in future studies.",

Georgievski (2) (1)University Hematology Clinic (Skopje, MK); (2)Clinical Center (Skopje, MK) Mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) have become an increasingly used alternative to bone marrow for allogeneic transplantation. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) -primed peripheral stem cells harvesting may result in a graft with increased mononuclear cells collected, increased progenitor cell dose and potential for more rapid engraftment resulting in improved survival. Filgrastrim is not only known to mobilize CD34 + progenitor cells but acts as a pleiotropic immune modulator. So, systematic donor follow-up in healthy donors is needed. The aim of this study is to evaluate safety and feasibility of G-CSF primed hematopoietic peripheral stem cells in familiar HLA-identical donors. The follow-up focused on laboratory testing including reports of adverse event. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is administrated in 49 healthy donors to reach suffi cient mobilization in the period 2000-2009. The donors were characterized as follows: 43 years median; female 60% of the donors. G-CSF was administrated in the dose 10 \u03bcg/kg of donor weight in fi ve day and PBSC collections started on the fi fth day using COBE Spectra cell separator. The aim was to collect mononuclear cells 2 \u00d7 10 8 /kg of recipient weight. Three donors were mobilized twice (for second transplant). Aphaeresis needed to reach target number of CD34 + cells were: 1 apherese in 50%, more than two apherese need in only 1 patient. The most frequent adverse event that was noted by patients was bone pain associated with increasing number of white blood cells. Better mobilization and higher PBSC yield correlated signifi cantly with younger age. Four years after G-CSF -primed peripheral stem cells harvesting, a young female 48 years old was diagnosed with acute myeloblastic leukemia. Four years ago when she was 44 years old, she donated for her HLA identical sister with acute myeloblastic leukemia. G-CSF is safe and very effective for PBSC mobilization in our healthy donors. This method allows certain collections of suffi cient numbers of progenitors in virtually all donors. We demonstrated that fi lgrastim mobilization for peripheral blood stem collection is effective and result with successful engraftment in all the recipients. Daily injection of 10 \u03bcg/kg of G-CSF and fi rst aphaeresis preformed at day 5 seems to be the best strategy to obtain the CD34 + cell count required for an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell graft.",

            "text": "Objective: Krabbe disease or globoid-cell leukodystrophy is a rare neurodegenerative disorder caused by hereditary deficiency of the lysozymal enzyme galactocerebrosidase (GALC). Central and peripheral demyelinisation usually develop in early infancy -however some adults with late-onset disease are described. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) is able to restore normal leukocyte GALC levels and probably establish donor derived GALC competent microglia and astroglia in the central nervous system. We here report on an adult patient with late-onset Krabbe disease who received unrelated alloSCT for severe and progressive neurological impairment. Patient and methods: A 37 year old female was diagnosed with Krabbe disease in February 2009 after a 17 year history of progressive lower limb paraplegia. Her GALC level was 0 to < 0.5% of lower normal. MRI of the brain showed an obvious increase in signal intensity of the pyramidal tract and the pericentral region. Since 2007 she was permanently confi ned to a wheel chair. On admission she had no motor and little sensory function of the lower limbs, no bladder control, progressive paresis (force 2/5) of the right arm, severe headache, vertigo, diplopia, mild dysarthria, neuropathic pain and an ECOG performance status of 4. No HLA identical donor could be found. After fully informed consent the patient therefore received peripheral blood stem cells of a 9/10 matched, unrelated donor following reduced intensity conditioning with iv Busulfan 6.4 mg/kg, Fludarabin 150 mg/m 2 and Thymoglobulin\u00ae 7.5 mg/kg body weight. Immunosuppression consisted of Cyclosporin A and short course Methotrexate. Results: Except for fever of unknown origin day (d) + 14 and CMV reactivation d + 20 the patient had an uneventful course. Take and full donor chimerism was documented d + 16 and d + 19, respectively. Pain was relieved d + 2, a substantial gain in right hand function occurred d + 8. Sitting on the edge of the bed and use of the right arm was possible d + 17. A fi rst step was documented d + 27 and at discharge d + 42 the patient was continuously improving and able to walk 30 m with a walking frame. Conclusion: To our knowledge this is the fi rst adult patient with Krabbe disease grafted from an unrelated donor, and the second adult patient receiving alloSCT for this condition. An impressive gain in neurological function was seen within days after transplant despite the presence of longstanding structural changes of the nervous system. complex and heterogeneous effects that originally thought. Therefore, changes in molecular pathways induced by mobilization and homing are not yet clear. The gene expression profi le (GEP) of healthy donors was evaluated to better explain the effects of G-CSF. Moreover, in order to assess the duration of these effects, sequential studies were also performed. Method: Peripheral blood (PB) samples were harvested before and after G-CSF administration: at baseline, at + 5 days and at + 30 days post G-CSF. We used a TaqMan\u00ae Low Density Array based on comparative dd CT method to perform relative quantifi cation of mRNA. Expression of each gene was normalized to the reference gene 18S mRNA, 1 unit was assumed as the normal reference value. About the project of macroarray card, we selected 47 candidate genes involved in immune network and infl ammation pathogenesis. Results: After G-CSF administration, we observed an increased expression of genes which specifi cally acts on endothelial cells: VEGFA, eNOs, MMP9. The transcriptome of Th1, Th2, TH17 response was characterized by no signifi cant modulation. Similar behavior is showed by a cluster of genes coding for chemokines/cyclines, infl ammation mediators. Only IL-10 was signifi cantly up-regulated. Genes involved in apoptosis regulation (CASP1, CASP6, BCL2A1) were unchanged, except for transcription factors (EGR-1,2) that were serially increased until + 30 days. All others genes returned to baseline values at + 30 days. The oncogenes JUN and FOS did not change.",

Zielinska, G. Helbig, A. Wieczorkiewicz, M. Markiewicz, S. Krzemien, U. Mazurek Silesian Medical University (Katowice, PL) Introduction: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) still remains one of the major complication following allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). Recent data indicates that transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) may play a role in the development of GVH reaction. Patients and methods: The study included 40 adult patients who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for myeloid leukemias between 2003-2005. A median follow-up was 28 months . In all cases, the expression of TGF-beta1 mRNA by real-time quantitive polymerase chain reaction (RT-QPCR) using ABI PRISMTM 7700 (Taqman) and TGF-beta1 serum concentration by commercial ELISA were measured fourfold in the peritransplant period (on days: -10, 0, + 30 and + 100). Results: Acute GVHD (aGVHD) experienced 20 patients, in 4 patients the symptoms were classifi ed as severe (grades III-IV). Chronic GVHD (cGVHD) occurred in 11 patients (in 4 in diffuse form). In all patients a prompt and signifi cant decrease in TGF-beta1 mRNA expression and its serum concentration was demonstrated after conditioning regimen (P < 0.005 and P < 0.00006, respectively). In patients who developed symptoms of acute GVHD, TGF-beta1 mRNA expression and its serum concentration remained low until day + 30 after transplant if compared to the transplant day (P < 0.03 and P < 0.006, respectively). TGF-beta1 mRNA expression and its serum concentration signifi cantly increased on day + 100 if compared to the transplant day (P < 0.0009 and P < 0.02, respectively) in patients who developed chronic GVHD. Conclusions: We demonstrate the kinetics of TGF-beta1 changes both on molecular and protein level in patients who underwent alloHSCT for acute myeloid leukemias. These results show that TGF-beta1 is likely to be an additional regulator of donor engraftment, probably its low levels contributing to the development of acute GVHD, which may suggest that TGF-beta1 exerts benefi cial effects in the early post transplant period. In contrast, chronic GVHD symptoms seem to correlate signifi cantly with high TGF-beta1 levels, suggesting that TGF-beta1 is likely to increase the risk of cGVHD by causing fi brosis of target organs, which remains in coherence with TGF-beta1 profi brotic activity.",

Kuzmich, V. Zmatchinski, N. Novoselova Research Institute of Haematology, United Institute of Informatics Problems (Minsk, BY) From 1994 to 2006 years in Belarus haematology and transplant centre 132 patients have been treated by method high dose chemotherapy (HDC) with autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT). All patients have been divided into 2 groups. The fi rst group (control; n = 90) did not receive any haemopoietic growth factors, and the second group(n = 42) -combination of recombinant human erythropoietin (rH-EPO) (10000 UI per dose three times a week) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-\u0421SF) (300 mkg per day). Criteria of haemopoesis restoration after autologous SCT were following: Hb > 90 g/l, leukocytes > 1,0 \u00d7 10 9 /l, neutrofi les > 0,5 \u00d7 10 9 /l. For comparison of effi ciency of haematologic recovery in investigated groups used day of achievement specifi ed above indicators of peripheral blood after autologous SCT. Time of Hb restoration in group of patients received rH-EPO + G-CSF was 8, 0 + 4, 6 vs. 11, 2 + 6, 8 in control group (P = 0,006). Time of leukocytes restoration in group of patients received rH-EPO + G-CSF was 9,3 + 1,3 vs. 12,2 + 3,1 in control group( P = 0,0001). Time of neutrofi les restoration in group received rH-EPO + G-CSF was 9,3 + 1,4 vs. 13,0 + 3,8 in control group (P = 0,0001). For an estimation of age infl uence on haemopoesis restoration after autologous SCT patients have been divided into 3 subgroups by age sign: till 30 years, from 31 till 40 years, senior than 40 years. Time of restoration of Hb in the senior age group (> 40 years), received rH-EPO + G-CSF was shorter (6,3 + 5,1 vs. 11,6 + 5,6; P = 0,03) than in control group. Terms of leukocytes and neutrofi les restoration were shorter in all age groups (P < 0,05). Thus, effi ciency of rH-EPO application after HDC and autologous SCT was most expressed at patients senior than 40 years.",

Mohty (1), F. Lefrere (2) , D. Caillot (3) , N. Azar (4) , J.M. Miclea (5) , F. Broussais (6) , J. P. Marolleau (7), M. Attal (8) , N. Milpied (9) , C. Gisselbrecht (5) , P. Moreau (1) Classical haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) mobilization approaches (G-CSF \u00b1 chemotherapy) result in mobilization failures in a signifi cant number of cases. Plerixafor, a CXCR4 antagonist, has gained recently EMEA approval in combination with G-CSF to enhance mobilisation of HSCs in patients with lymphoma and multiple myeloma whose cells mobilise poorly, adding to the HSC mobilizing regimens currently available. However, the role of Plerixafor in mobilization failures in the most heavily pre-treated patients, which were excluded from registration trials, is still under investigation. We present here the fi rst analysis of the French Plerixafor compassionate use program (called \"ATU\") which included 39 consecutive patients with mobilization failure prior to receiving Plerixafor. Patients characteristics were as follow: median age 58 (range, 4-77) y.; 22 men (56%); 22 myeloma (56%), 14 lymphomas (36%) and 3 other diagnoses (8%); median weight 73 (range, 47-100) Kg. Prior to Plerixafor administration, patients received a median of 2 lines of chemotherapy (range, 1-6) and a median number of 7 (range, 4-18) therapy cycles. 3 patients (8%) also received radiation therapy. OF NOTE, per program, patients needed to have failed at least TWO mobilization procedures before being eligible to receive Plerixafor + G-SCF. The median delay between the last mobilization attempt and Plerixafor administration was 44 (range, 16-664) days. During the last mobilization attempt prior to salvage with Plerixafor, the median number of circulating CD34 + cells achieved was 4 (range, 0-21) cells/\u03bcL. During mobilization with Plerixafor, patients received a median of 2 (range, 1-4) injections. No Plerixafor-related severe or serious adverse events were observed. After the fi rst injection of Plerixafor, the median number of circulating CD34 + cells achieved, was 21 (range, 0-126) cells/\u03bcL, and the median number of collected CD34 + stem cells after the fi rst aphaeresis session was 2.12 (range, 0.3-10) \u00d7 10 6 /Kg. The median total number of collected CD34 + cells after salvage Our results demonstrated that addition of CD271-MSCs to the double-way MLR on day 0 induced a signifi cant inhibition of alloreactivity on day 6. This effect was associated with the increased levels of PGE2 and was reversed by addition of indomethacin as a specifi c PGE2-inhibitor. However, attempts to block this inhibitory effect of CD271-MSCs with an NO synthase inhibitor (L-NAME) had no effect. In addition, in the presence of CD271-MSCs the levels of infl ammatory cytokines secreted as a result of allogeneic reaction was signifi cantly decreased. Furthermore, CD271-MSCs at the ratio 1:1 were able to signifi cantly suppress mitogenic response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells.",

Arsenio, G. Teixeira, N. Miranda, E. Fernandez, F. Costa, J. Cabral Instituto Portugues Oncologia (Lisbon, PT) Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHLH) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder affecting mainly young children, being rapidly fatal if untreated. It is caused by genetic defects that impair T cell-mediated and natural cytotoxicity with a highly stimulated but ineffective immune response. The use of immunossupressive agents has resulted in improvements in survival during the fi rst months after diagnosis, however allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is considered the defi nitive therapy. FLHL patients have high levels of circulating infl ammatory and hematopoietic-inhibitory cytokines as a result of T lymphocyte and histiocyte activation that may result in a hypercytokinemia syndrome with considerable mortality in conventional intensity transplant conditioning. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have inherent immunomodulatory properties inhibiting activation of T lymphocytes and histiocytes and great capacity for secretion of anti-infl ammatory soluble mediators. MSC could therefore be advantageously used as an adjunct cell therapy to HSCT in FLHL. Two patients with FLHL were submitted to allogeneic HSCT supplemented with double infusions of third party MSC after conditioning with busulphan and cyclophosphamide. Both had previously received the HLH-04 protocol with a partial remission. Patient characteristics are summarized in the Table. 50 ml of MSC donor's bone marrow were obtained under sterile conditions. Ficoll separated mononuclear cells were plated in tissue culture fl asks in DMEM-low glucose supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (nanofi ltered, gamma-irradiated, Hyclone) and incubated at 37C with 5% CO2. At 80% confl uence cells were harvested using Accutase (Sigma) and replated at 3-6\u00b3 cells/cm\u00b2 until the target dose of 1-26/kg recipient body weight was obtained (Passage 2-3). Quality control testing included bacterial culture, mycoplasma PCR testing, MSC immunophenotype, morphology and multilineage differentiation ability. All procedures were performed under GMP conditions in a nationally accredited laboratory. Approval of the local ethics committee was obtained.",

Weyl Ben Arush (1) (1)Rambam Health Care Campus (Haifa, IL); (2)Sourasky Medical Center (Tel Aviv, IL); (3)Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center (Jerusalem, IL) Background: Common hemoglobinopathy (HP) includes betathalassemia major (TM) and sickle-cell disease (SCD). TM is caused by any of approximately 150 point mutations within the beta-globin gene. The most prevalent Arabic mutation in our region is IVS1-110. Clinical severity in TM depends on underlying mutations of the B-globin gene and degree of iron overload. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is the only potentially curative treatment for severe HP. Objective: To investigate the impact of genotype on the results of SCT and the development of complications in TM and SCD. Subjects and Methods: The study population consisted of 29 (14 male, 15 female) patients of Arabic origin from northern Israel and the West Bank who underwent SCT for severe HP (25 TM, 4 SCD), mean age 8.4 years (10 months-23 years), and followed in Haifa, Israel, from 2000 to 2008. Median follow up was 5 years (1.1-8.9 years). Distribution of patients according to the Pesaro risk classifi cation included 3 in class I, 11 in class II, and 15 in class III. Patients were divided into two groups according to their genotype. Group A (11): TM with the most prevalent Mediterranean mutation: IVS1-110/IVS1-110; Group B (18) with the other B-globin mutations: nonsense (NS) 39/39(2), NS 37/39 (2), IVS1-110/NS 37 (1), NS 37/37 (2), IVS1--6/IVS1-6 (1); IVS2-1/IVS2-1(1), IVS1-110/NS 39(2), IVS1-1/IVS1-1 (2), frameshift 8/frameshift 8 (1), and 4 SCD. Statistical analysis was performed by Pearson's Chi-Square Test. P<0.05 was assumed to denote statistical signifi cance. Results: Patients in Group A were more likely to be distributed in class I-II -72.7% than patients in group B -27.3% (P = 0.039) (Table 1), despite their similar mean ferritin levels (2945 ngr/ml).

Byrne on behalf of the BSBMT Since 2000 the use of GSCF-mobilised Peripheral Blood Stem Cells (PBSC) for unrelated donor (UD) transplantation has increased dramatically. While a number of studies in T-replete transplants have reported signifi cantly different clinical outcomes following PBSC compared to BM, there are few data in T-cell depleted transplants. We present long-term follow-up data on 320 recipients of a myeloablative conditioned, HLA-matched UD allograft using pre-transplant serotherapy(Alemtuzumab = 306, ATG = 14). Transplants were January 2000 -August 2007: CML in 1CP (n = 102) and acute leukaemia in CR1/2 (AML in 105, ALL in 144). 190 patients received BM and 130 PBSC. The median age of recipients was 28.9 years (10 months -58 years). The groups were similar except for a signifi cantly higher CD34 cell count in the PBSC group (median:5.8 vs. 2.9  respectively, P < 0.001) and more CML patients in the BM group (36% vs. 25% in PBSC, P = 0.051). The median follow-up was 48 months (BM: 59, PBSC: 38). The overall survival at 8 years was 55%. This was not signifi cantly different dependant on the use of BM or PBSC in univariate or multivariable (mva) (P = 0.84) analysis. CML (HR = 0.5, P = 0.003) and patient CMV seropositivity (HR1.4,  P = 0.035)  were signifi cantly associated with outcome in mva.",

One year TRM was 20% for the entire group and did not signifi cantly differ between the 3 groups. Despite the obvious limitations of this small series, results seem to indicate that in this population, donor type does not highly infl uence outcome. This is quite encouraging as most of the pts lack a compatible sibling donor. This may invite to consider privileging a rapid identifi cation of an alternative donor rather than a given donor type when a match sibling is not available. Thus concomitant search for both graft type should be undertaken in order to perform allo SCT in a larger number of pts otherwise not treated because of early progression as illustrated in the underrepresentation of alternative transplant as compared with familial transplant in this retrospective study (28 familial vs. 22 alternative).",

            "text": "Background: Poor graft function (PGF) occurs in 5-27% of patients (pts) after allogeneic hamatopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Graft function may be poor as result of slow or incomplete recovery of blood counts (primary PGF) or decreasing blood counts after successful engraftment (secondary PGF). Several factors may determine PGF: disease status, conditioning regimen, HSC source, HLA compatibility, T cell content, immunosuppression, GvHD, viral infections, drugs. GCSF and Rhu-EPO are readily available and effective but with no effects on platelet. Second transplantation from the same donor, with or without conditioning therapy, can boost the haematopoietic recovery in these pts. Unfortunately, both a second peripheral CD34 + mononuclear cells (MNC) mobilization and a marrow harvest in the operating room may be contraindicated early after the fi rst donation as not safe for donors. Intrabone SCT can overcome the risk of graft failure even with a low number of CD34 + MNC and we have performed in two adult pts with PGF a bone-to-bone boost (BBB) with a small marrow harvest from respective donors, who were unfi t for a second conventional donation. Aim: To evaluate the feasibility of the BBB technique in 2 pts with PGF. Methods and results: pts were 2 males (57, 53 y) with a diagnosis of AML and CMML, respectively. Prolonged pancytopenia and hypoplastic marrow were documented in both cases, with diagnosis of primary PGF and secondary PGF, respectively, donor chimerism ranging from 80-100% (STR and HLA), without evidence of leukemia. The 2 donors were related, haploidentical. For the BBB procedure small quantities of bone marrow (< 200 ml) were collected from the posterior iliac crest of the donors, at the bedside, during deep sedation and analgesya. After 30 minutes, necessary for graft treatment according to Institution procedure, the unmanipulated marrow harvested was infused into the posterior iliac crest of the pts at day 30 and 72 days after SCT, respectively. MNC infused doses were 0.9 and 0.4 \u00d7 10 8 /Kg, respectively. No side effects were recorded both for patients and donors. Conclusion: in this 2 cases the BBB technique proved feasible and safe for both donors and patients. This practice can give the chance of HSC boost to patients with PGF without the need of a GCSF mobilization for donors and with a minimal invasive operation. Further studies are necessary to assess the effi cacy of this procedure.",

Only one mobilized successfully (2.3 \u00d7 10 6 cells CD34/kg) and underwent transplantation, another patient relapsed at the hematologic recovery and the remaining 4 received a second consolidation chemotherapy. Conclusions: Poor mobilization is frequent in AML or MDS patients. The duration of pancytopenia following previous chemotherapies was the only factor infl uencing successful mobilization. Rescue mobilization with cytarabine plus G-CSF was not effective.

Tan  KK Women's and Children's Hospital (Singapore, SG)    Haematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) have cured many patients with malignant and nonmalignant conditions since the 70's. In a population with diverse racial groups and with some ethnic groups not well represented in the international marrow registries, unrelated cord blood transplant gives these children another chance of cure. Method: We reported 19 cases of unrelated cord blood transplant (CBT) over a period of 6 yrs from Oct 2003 to September 2009 in a Children's Hospital. During the same period we performed 4 cases of matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplant, 27 MSD transplant and 2 related CBT. Of the unrelated CBT, the majority were 1/2 HLA Ag mismatched , 12 cases for malignant disorders (5 for ALL, 4 for AML, 3 for CML in accelerated/blastic crisis) and 7 cases for nonmalignant disorders (6 for primary immunodefi ciency disorders (PID) and 1 for Thalassemia major). The racial groups were mainly Chinese except for 2 Malay, 1 Middle Eastern and 1 Australian descent. The median age was 6 yrs (range 0.25 to 17 yrs). Most year post transplant, one with Thalassemia Major had autologous reconstitution and one pt with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) died from pneumonia1.5  yrs later. There was no TRM. In the same period for the MUD/MSD HSCT, TRM was 3.2% (1/31 pts). The median neutrophil engraftment was 24 day (range D + 18 to D + 61) and median platelets engraftment was 30 days (range D + 18 to D + 50). 11 patients had GVHD. Majority had mild to moderate GVHD. OS was 73% (14/19 pts). The medium follow up was 906 days (range 77 to 2170 days). 5/19 pts died (4 from relapse of leukemia). Summary: Today cord blood forms an important source of stem cells in unrelated HSCT for SE Asian descents .In the year 2007 out of a total 28 unrelated HSCT for adult/children in Singapore, cord blood formed 45% the source of stem cells (APBMT 2009). Cord blood formed 80% (19/23) source of stem cells for unrelated HSCT in this study. With expansion of local Public Cord Bank and International Cord Blood Banks, we expect 50 to 60% of our children will be able to fi nd a suitable cord unit in future. Background: Haploidentical stem cell transplantation is a treatment option for patients (pts) who don't have an HLA-identical sibling donor, HLA-matched unrelated donor or insuffi cient amount of cord blood cells. A high rate of TRM limits use of this method of treatment. Design and Methods: 22 eligible patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies (ALL 9pts; AML 10pts; CML ac. phase 1pts; HL resistant 1pts, Neuroblastoma resistant 1pts were included in this study. Patient sex M:F 13pts: 9pts (1,4:1). Patient age, median 12,6 years (4-32). We used HSC from three loci mismatched related donors.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (HSCT) is the treatment of choice for patients with FA, it leads to normal complete hematopoietic recovery and prevention of acute leukemia. Materials and methods: From June 1998 to November 2008 (125 months period) 37 patients with FA underwent 38 allogeneic HSCT (from HLA-identical sibling donors: 32 and pheno identical: 4, mismatch cord unrelated donor: 1); median age 11 years (5 to 24); sex ratio (M/F) 1; median interval from diagnosis to transplant 24,9 months (5 to 60); 12 patients (44,3%) had received more than 20 transfusions before allograft. Two conditioning regimens was used: BU-Cy protocol with busulfan 6 mg/Kg and cyclophosphamide 40 mg/Kg for 9 patients (23,7%) and Flu-Cy-ATG protocol with fl udarabin 150 mg/m 2 , Cy 20 mg/",

            "text": "Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria is characterized by intravascular hemolysis (IVH) due to uncontrolled spontaneous complement alternative pathway (CAP) activation due to the lack of CD55 and CD59 on affected RBCs. By modifying the standard Ham acid hemolysis test, we have developed an in vitro model to investigate both the terminal and the early C activation, which lead to hemolysis and C3 fragment (C3frag) opsonization of RBCs, respectively. Both hemolysis and RBC C3frag opsonization were serially measured by double color fl ow cytometry(Ferreira and  Pangburn, Blood 2007; Risitano et al., Blood 2009). TT30 is a fusion protein which links the CAP inhibitory domain of Factor H (fH) with the iC3b/C3d recognition domain of C receptor 2; the resulting molecule is able to supplement fH activity and control CAP activity specifi cally at sites of C3 activation. We have studied RBCs obtained from 8 PNH patients, 5 untreated and 3 on eculizumab (Ec). Washed RBCs were incubated with ABO-compatible sera from healthy volunteers. Sera obtained < 1 h after infusion of Ec were used in surrogate experiments for testing Ec in vitro. The Ham test was modifi ed using a pH of 7.0-7.3 to allow slower hemolysis and C3frag RBC opsonization. Using these conditions, survival of PNH RBCs at 24 h was 15-30% in untreated patients; survival of PNH RBCs from patients on Ec was lower, likely due to the higher propensity of C3frag + PNH RBCs to lyse even in absence of serum acidifi cation. Peak serum concentration of Ec (> 200 ug/mL) resulted in a signifi cantly higher PNH RBC survival (45-70%); residual C-mediated hemolysis was confi rmed by the presence of C3frag + RBC membrane fragments. Notably, the majority (50-80%) of surviving PNH RBCs became C3frag + after 24h incubation. TT30 at 1 uM (65 ug/ml) or higher concentrations led to 100% survival of PNH RBCs from untreated patients, which was sustained up to 72 h. In addition, consistent with the mechanism of TT30 activity, no C3frag + PNH RBCs or membrane fragments appeared. In conclusion, our model demonstrates that Ec substantially reduces in vitro lysis of PNH RBCs, but is associated with substantial C3frag deposition on surviving PNH RBCs. In contrast TT30, blocking the CAP and its amplifi cation loop, led to complete inhibition of hemolysis without C3frag deposition on PNH RBCs. These fi ndings suggest that TT30 may inhibit both the MAC-mediated IVH and the C3frag-mediated extravascular hemolysis, providing a strong rationale to test this agent in future clinical trials.",

Disease severity was 'very severe' in 10, 'severe' in 20 and 'non-severe' in 7 patients. SCT was performed using MSD in 15 patients (40%) and UD in 22(60%), of whom all but one were matched for 8/8 or 10/10 alleles. UD transplants received IST prior to SCT. There were 5 cases of graft failure. Cumulative incidence of graft failure at 1 year was 15% \u00b1 4% (14% for MSD and 15% for UD SCT). For patients transplanted > 12 months from diagnosis, graft failure was 25% compared with 10% for patients transplanted within 12 months(P = 0.19). Acute GVHD occurred in 13.5% patients, grade I-II in all cases. Extensive chronic GVHD occurred in only one patient. Data for CMV infections was available in 21 patients, and in 20 patients for EBV. CMV reactivation occurred in 2/21 (9.5%) patients, with one case of CMV disease. EBV infection occurred in 2/20 patients (10%): one responded to Rituximab and one patient died from progressive EBV PTLD. There were no cases of adenovirus infection. 3-yr OS was 89% (93% for MSD and 85% for UD SCT, P = 0.66). For all patients, OS was 95% when time from diagnosis to SCT was < 12 months and 80% for > 12 months(P = 0.27). For patients > 40 yrs, there was no signifi cant difference in OS compared with patients <40 yrs (93% vs. 82%). We conclude that Alemtuzumab with Fludarabine and CY(FCC) for MSD and UD SCT for acquired AA is associated with excellent survival, a low incidence of GVHD and viral infections.Background: Total body irradiation (TBI) is often employed in matched unrelated donor (MUD) allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) in severe aplastic anaemia (SAA). However, even at low doses, TBI causes serious short-and long-term toxicities. In matched related donors (MRD), outcome in SAA patients over 40 years with high-dose cyclophosphamide (CY) and ATG is often poor due to graft rejection and GVHD. Methods: Over a 10-year period(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009), twenty SAA patients underwent allo-SCT with a FLU-CY-ATG regimen from a MRD (n = 7, all age > 40) or a MUD (n = 13, any age). Median age was 34 years (range 1-59). Seven pts (33%) were > 50 years old. Bone marrow was used as stem cell source in all but four patients. The regimen employed most consistently(Bacigalupo et al., 2005; 36: 947 Bone Marrow Transpl) included (n = 13) FLU (30 mg/m sq \u00d7 4 days) intravenously (IV), CY (300 mg/m sq IV \u00d7 4 days), and thymoglobulin (THY,3.75   mg/kg IV \u00d7 3-4 days).

Stiakaki, M. Tsirigotaki,  L. Sifaki, N. Katzilakis, M. Kalmanti   Pediatric Hematology/Oncology University of Crete (Heraklion, GR)Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) compromise a promising source for cellular therapy due to their easy ex vivo expansion. A unique property of these cells is their immunomodulatory and anti-infl ammatory function. Based on the successful administration of MSC in children with therapy-resistant acute GVHD, it is important to defi ne the properties of MSC from patients with autoimmune disease (AD) and their possible involvement in the disease pathogenesis with the fi nal goal being their use as therapeutic agents. Although the characteristics and the role of MSC have been studied in adults with AD, there are no reports in childhood AD. The aim of this study was the investigation of the phenotypical and functional characteristics of bone marrow (BM)derived MSC from children with AD. Patients and methods BM mononuclear cells (MNC) from 6 children with AD, and a control group (CTL) of 8 children with solid tumours without BM involvement, were cultured under conditions that favor MSC growth for fi ve passages (P1-P5). Cell doubling time (DT), surface antigen expression, CFU-F colony development and differentiation ability towards adipo-, osteo-and chondrocytes were evaluated. Results AD-MSC and CTL-MSC exhibited similar fi broblastlike morphology. Immunophenotypic analysis showed that both groups express MSC-related markers but not haemopoietic markers. Their proliferation capacity as expressed by DT was similar. Specifi cally, CTL-MSC in the MNC fraction (D0) required 18 \u00b1 1days to reach confl uency and AD-MSC 17.16 \u00b1 0.87 days (P = 0.558). The DT in all passages was no statistically signifi cant(2.50 \u00b1 0.42 vs. 2.33 \u00b1 0.26, P = 1.00 P2)  between the groups. AD-MSC developed less medium (P = 0.026 P1, P = 0.040 P2) and large (P = 0.032 P3) sized colonies in the fi rst 3 passages, indicative of impaired clonogenic potential. CFU-F numbers decreased with the passage progression in both groups. Finally, both CTL-MSC and AD-MSC had tri-lineage differentiation potential. Conclusion BM-derived MSC from children with AD exhibit the same phenotypic, proliferative and differentiation potential, compared with the control group. In view of these results, MSC are likely to be a valuable therapeutic option for severe AD refractory to standard treatment. However, further characterization of the properties of MSC and assessment of their immunomodulatory properties are required in order to offer such a therapeutic approach to pediatric autoimmune diseases.",

To hypothesize NK cell therapy for CRC, there is a need to show NK cell infi ltration in the MICA/B + tumor microenvironment (TM). Utilizing a tissue microarray (TMA), we investigated MICA/B expression and NK cell clinico-pathological role in 1414 CRC. More than 90% of CRC over-expressed MICA/ B molecules. CD16 and CD56 antigens staining showed that only 11.8% of CRC punches were infi ltrated by < 4 CD16 + cells while 61.8% of CRC punches were infi ltrated by < 4 CD56 + cells(P = 2.2 \u00d7 10-13). Similarly, 1070 out of 1259 evaluable CRC contained \u2264 4 CD57 + cells while 189 CRC had > 4 CD57 + cells suggesting the myeloid origin of the CD16 + infi ltrate. Data validation was obtained by analyzing CD16 + cells from 14 freshly removed CRC. The percentage of CD16 + cells identifi ed was higher than that observed for CD56 + cells (1.83 \u00b1 0.31 vs. 0.14 \u00b1 0.07%) of the CRC (n = 5, P = 0.005). NKG2D and NKp46 markers were expressed in comparably (P = 0.45) low percentages of cells (\u2264 0.1%) and were accompanied by CD33, CD68 and CD32 markers suggesting that the presence of NK cells in the CRC was negligible. The impact of NK cell infi ltration in the CRC TM of CRC patients (pts) overall survival (OS) was evaluated. We found no signifi cant OS differences between CRC with score1 (\u2264 4 cells/punch) and score2 (> 4 cells/punch) for CD56 + infi ltration(P = 0.264) and CD57 + cell infi ltration (P = 0.583) respectively. To identify mechanisms by which NK cells failed to infi ltrate MICA/B over-expressing CRC cells, we assessed the effect of the HCT116, CRC cells, ML2, ML cells, and Caki-1, RCC cells on NK cells upon conjugation. Malignant cells induced NK cell apoptosis, CD16 down-regulation and NK cell elimination. Malignant cell dependent elimination was restricted to CD16 + CD56 + NK cell subset without affecting CD16-CD56 + NK and CD16 + NK-T cells while the ligation of CD16 antigen with a mAb prevented NK cells from ML2 induced NK cell elimination, suggesting that CD16 antigen was directly involved. Since NK cells do not easily infi ltrate the CRC TM and are rapidly eliminated by malignant cells, the usage of NK cell immunotherapy in CRC is questionable. Novel strategies overcoming the indicated problems could lead to a feasible NK cell immunotherapy of CRC and will improve the GVL effect of NK cell in ML pts.",

In February 2002, the patient was started on imatinib 400 mg/d. Due to primary resistance with progress to accelerated phase, the patient was offered HCT after RIC [200cGy TBI + fl udarabine 30 mg/m 2 /day on 3 days] followed by immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine] from a matched related donor in October 2002.Despite extensive chronic graft versus host disease of the skin, the patient suffered a hematological relapse in April 2004. Imatinib was restarted. A complete molecular response (CMR) by RT-PCR of 13 months duration could be achieved. Imatinib was discontinued because of intolerance. The patient lost CMR with low BCR-ABL transcripts detectable in the marrow. July 2007, the patient suffered a cerebral chloroma and was treated with radiotherapy and dasatinib 40 mg bid. A second CMR could be induced. Due to pleural and pericardial effusions, dasatinib had to be discontinued in February 2009. Four months later CMR was lost with low levels of BCR-ABL transcripts in the marrow. October 2009, the patient developed back pain with numbness in both legs. MRI showed hyperintensities consistent with leptomeningeal disease at the level of the cauda equina. Cerbrospinal fl uid (CSF) revealed Ph + blasts verifi ed by FISH. Simultaneously, marrow examination showed a cytogenetic relapse and 58% BCR-ABL/ABL transcripts by RT-PCR with no ABL kinase domain mutations. Results: Nilotinib 400mg bid was started. Three days later, a dramatic clinical improvement occurred. After four weeks on nilotinib, a CMR could be documented. Both CSF and MRI showed a complete remission of CNS disease. Nilotininb was very well tolerated. Conclusions: After HCT, minimal residual disease by RT-PCR can herald extramedullary relapse of CML after HCT. For the fi rst time, we show that nilotinib can be a very effective treatment of CNS relapse of Ph + cML after HCT.",

Patients and methods: We reviewed the medical fi les of all children less than 18 year of age, who received HSCT at King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC) from establishing the HSCT program in January, 2003 till September, 2009 . Results: A total of 241 children were transplanted, at an average of 35 cases per year. One-hundred-twenty eight patients (53%) were males and 113 females (47%). Thirty-two patients (13%) were less than 2 year of age, while 163 patients (68%) were between 2-12 year, and 46 patients (19%) between 12-18 year of age. Thirty seven patients (15%) received autologus transplantation; mainly for Lymphomas (49%) and Neuroblastoma (42%). While 204 patients (85%) received allogeneic transplantation, that included 174 patients (72.2%) from matched related donors, 17 patients (7.1%) from cord blood (4 related and 13 unrelated), 12 patients (5%) from haploidentical donors, and one patient (0.4%) from unrelated donor. Myelo-ablative conditioning was given used in 213 patients (88%) and non-myeloablative in 28 patients (12%). The indication of transplantation was malignant diseases in 138 patients (57%),and non-malignant disorders in 103 patients (43%). The main malignant disease was Acute Myeloid Leukemia (26%) followed by Acute Lymphoid Leukemia (25%) and Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (8%). While the main non-malignant diseases was Thalassemia major (38%),followed by congenital and acquired bone marrow failure diseases (30%) and primary immune-defi ciency syndromes (20%). The overall survival for all patients at 3 and 5 years was 72. 8% . The event-free survival at 3 and 5 years was 64.3% and 63.2% respectively. The 100 days transplant-related mortality for all patients (including unrelated transplantation) was 7.1% (17 patients), 10 patients (4.1%) with malignant disease and 7 patients (2.9%) with non-malignant diseases. We have good supportive care that includes pediatric intensive care unit, psycho-social service and play therapy. More and detailed results will be presented in the conference. Conclusion: HSCT for children can be performed safely with an excellent outcome in developing countries. We have a low transplant-related mortality despite most of the cases received allogeneic HSCT. Team work, multidisciplinary action, tailoring management plan according to patient clinical status, and use of available resources effectively can lead to excellent results.",

Conventional treatments for high risk and recurrent medulloblastoma (MBL), supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (ATRT) have a very poor prognosis in children. The administration of high dose chemotherapy (HDCT) with autologous hematopoietic stem cell rescue (AHSCT) in the high risk patients has improved survival rates. Patients and methods: We present 21 patients (males: 10, females: 11) who received HDCT and AHSCT in Hungary between April 1, 2005 and Jun 30, 2009 . The median age at transplantation was 5,99 years (range 1,03-16,68 years). High risk (HR) patients were defi ned as follows: partial removal or anaplastic MBL, PNET or ATRT in patients older than 3 years and all patients younger than 3 years. All relapsed patients were also referred to HR group. Patient's stem cells were mobilized with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor at a dose of 10 microgram/kg subcutaneously twice daily. One child was transplanted with BM graft. Mobilization was done in the early phase of the conventional chemotherapy. The conditioning regiment in nineteen patients consisted of busulfan 4 mg/kg/day, intravenously (iv.) over 4 days in 6-hourly divided doses, thiotepa 250 mg/m 2 /day iv. over 2 days and etoposid 750 mg/m 2 a single dose iv. Two patients got busulfan (dose above) + melphalan at a dose of 140 mg/m 2 /day by iv. on day - 1. Results : The engraftment was achieved median on day + 9 (range 7-21). The median follow up time is 1,3 years (range 0,37-4,65). The estimated 3 years overall survival (OS) was: 69,4% \u00b1 11,7% the relapse free survival (RFS) was 58,6% \u00b1 13% in this HR patients group. These result were in the newly diagnosed HR MBL group 78,8% \u00b1 13,4% / 60% \u00b1 16,9% respectively. Two of the three lost MBL patients were transplanted in a relapsed disease. All death occurred due to relapse, there was no treatment related mortality (TRM) during this period of time. Conclusions: The survival of patients with HR brain tumors highly improved with HDCT plus AHSCT in the risk adapted Hungarian Medulloblastoma protocol (MBL 2004) . The improvement was primary due to the better survival of the newly diagnosed HR MBL patients. The good results were achieved without TRM.",

Ball Leiden University Medical Centre (Leiden, NL) Bone marrow examination in healthy children is exceptionally rare. Children acting as healthy sibling donors undergo multiple bone marrow (BM) aspirates in order to donate suffi cient volume of stem cells for their sibling. They provide an ideal basis for examining the morphology of BM in normal healthy children. As these donors are screened before donation including routine hematology and biochemistry, and found 'fi t', it is assumed that their BM is normal. We undertook a retrospective analysis of BM aspirated at the time of donation and submitted for routine hemato morphological examination in pediatric donors, in order to screen for abnormalities .. Included aspirates were obtained from pediatric donors underwent BM harvesting between 1981 and 2004 and whom A Graft versus lymphoma effect have been suggested in patients with mature lymphoid malignancies supporting the role of RIC allogeneic transplant in these malignancies in order to decrease the high Non relapse Mortality (NRM) previously reported after myeloablative conditioning. In 1999 our centre opened the fi rst phase II prospective Trial on RIC allogeneic transplant in haematological malignancies; since then, 75 patients with lymphoproliferative diseases have received an allogeneic transplant with RIC. From them, 12,2% had a DBLCL, 21,6% an indolent lymphoma, 5,6% a MCL, 10.8% a PTCL, 29,7% a CLL and 20.3% a Hodgkin Lymphoma. Median age at transplant was 50 years (range 20-67); 49 (66%) were male patients. Median number of therapy lines before the transplant was 3.2 (1-9) 40% had a previous autologous transplant. At transplant had sensitive disease 79% (38% were on CR and 41% on PR) and (21%) were transplanted with refractory disease. Donor was matched related in 57 (77%) and Unrelated in 17 (23%). In most of them, 62 (84%), conditioning regimen consisted of fl udarabine 30 mg/m 2 intravenously (IV) 5 days and melphalan 140 mg/m 2 IV. Median number of CD34 + infused cells was ). GVH prophylaxis consisted on CSA + MTX in most of patients. Results: all the patients engrafted and median of days to reach more than 500 \u00d7 10 9 granulocytes and more than 20000 \u00d7 10 9 platelets were + 17 (range 10-29) and + 11 (range 0-25) respectively. With a median follow up of 27 months (range: 1-127 months), 41 patients (55,4%) are alive, 36 disease free and 33 (44,6%) have died, 19 (25,7%) due to NRM and 13 (17,6%) due to progressive disease. NRM at 100 days, one year and 3 years are 5,5%, 13% and 17% respectively. OS and PFS at 3 years are 58% and 56% respectively for the whole group, 62% and 60% for related and 43% and 30% for unrelated donor. Considering different histologies. OS at 3 years is 82% for MCL, 52% for BDLCL, 80% for indolent lymphoma, 75% for PTCL, 80% for CLL, and 64% for HL. On univariate analysis the presence of cGVHD is associated with a better OS (90% for cGVHD and 23% for aGVHD) Chronic GVHD infl uences in OS and in PFS in the multivariant analysis (P < 0.01). Comments: These single center positive results confi rm the possible role of RIC allo transplant in sensitive lymphoid malignancies. Full fi nal analysis will be updated at the moment od presentation.",

Ozawa, S. Nishiwaki, D. Koyama, K. Onodera, T. Goto, A. Seto, K. Watanabe, N. Imahashi, S. Tsukamoto, K. Miyamura Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital (Nagoya, JP) Purpose: To evaluate the effi cacy of reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) for Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph ( + ) ALL) in the imatinib era, we compared the outcome and risk factors between TBI-containing conditioning and fl udarabine + melphalan-containing reducedintensity conditioning, and also evaluated several variables such as ages, minimal residual diseases (MRD) and HLA disparities. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 17 adult Ph ( + ) ALL patients who received imatinib mesylate containing induction therapy, followed by allo-SCT from April 2002 to November 2009 in our institution. Results: The median age of the patients was 40 years. Ten patients received TBI (12Gy)-containing conditioning and 7 patients received fl udarabine + melphalan-containing reduced-intensity conditioning (FM). At SCT 11 patients had no MRD and 6 patients had MRD. At median follow-up of 24.1 months, 12 patients were alive, and 3 patients were relapsed, and 4 died of transplantation-related mortality. The actuarial 2-year overall survival (OS) rate, progression-free survival (PFS) rate were 66.9% and 60.8%, respectively. PFS was signifi cantly superior among patients without MRD than patients with MRD at SCT (79.5% vs. 33.3%; P = 0.021). Multivariate analysis To assess the impact of the donor search period on the outcome of patients (pts) with high risk (HR) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we prospectively analyzed 80 pts -median age 34 years , median body weight 60 Kg (10-120) -who underwent a search of an unrelated donor through the BMDWW Registry and cord blood (CB) banks, between April 1995 and September 2009. At the start of the search 34 pts were in I complete remission (CR), 28 in > II CR and 18 in relapse. The probability of fi nding a donor, CB or unrelated volunteer donor (UD) by cumulative incidence (CI) was 52% at 4 months (95% CI: 51-52.3), 66% at 8 months (95% CI: 65. 3-66.4 ), 67% at 12 months (95% CI: 66.7-67.9 ), respectively; after this time, no increase in the CI of fi nding a donor was registered. The median time from the start of the search to fi nding a donor was 1.8 months (range: 0.5-6) for a CB and 3 months (range: 1.4-12) for a UD, the difference being statistically signifi cant (P = 0.02). Out of 54 pts with a donor, 36 (66%) underwent a transplant, while the remaining 18 (33%) could not undergo a transplant because of lost eligibility mainly due to a relapse occurring during the search, observed at a median of 4 months after the start of the search. The overall survival (OS) probability at 10 years was 21% for the whole population. In univariate analysis, to address the search at the time of relapse (P = 0.008), a body weight less than the median (P = 0.03) and the absence of relapse during the search (P < .0001), analyzed as covariate time dependent, showed a positive effect on survival. In multivariate analysis, relapse during the search remains the most important factor affecting OS (P < .0001 ). In conclusion, relapse during the search represents the major cause of failure of the search of an UD for pts with HR AML, in terms of OS, compromising the eligibility to transplant. Since an increase in the research time beyond 4 months, the CI of fi nding a donor increases slightly compared to the increased risk of relapse, the time of the research should not exceed this time point. Addressing the search, at the same time, in CB banks and UD registries increases the chance to carry out a transplant in helpful time. Over 4 months, the indication for an alternative transplant should be given.",

Kurtzberg (10) Alpha mannosidosis is a rare lysosomal storage disease with variable developmental delay and skeletal dysplasia. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is considered stand-ard therapy for severe variations of the disease. The fi rst successful HSCT for mannosidosis was described in 1998. Here we present a retrospective analysis of 13 patients with alpha-mannosidosis that were diagnosed at a median of 2.9 (1.6 to 23) years and underwent HSCT at a median of 3.8 (2 to 23.2) years. Three patients received bone marrow, three cord blood, four CD34 selected peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC), and one a cord-haploidentical PBSC cotransplantation. In two patients, stem cell source was not documented. Transplant course: Twelve of these patients are alive (92%) after a median follow up of 6.9 (1.1 to 10.5) years. Three patients (23%) developed respiratory insuffi ciency that required mechanical ventilation, one patient (8%) died from multi organ failure after HSCT. Of the surviving patients, two (17%) developed severe acute GvHD (\u2265 grade II) and four (33%) chronic GvHD (two limited, one extensive, one not documented). Two patients (17%) required re-transplantation because of graft failure. All twelve showed stable engraftment at last follow up. Disease-specifi c follow-up: Developmental data before HSCT were available in nine patients. The extent of these patients' developmental delay varied over a wide range. Post-HSCT neurologic follow up was available for six patients and all of them showed developmental improvement after HSCT. Before HSCT, six of eleven patients (55%) required hearing aids, after HSCT fi ve of twelve patients (42%). In three patients hearing aids could be discontinued, while two required new hearing aids after HSCT. Conclusion: Children seemed to tolerate conditioning and HSCT without unusual or unexpected complications. The fi nal survival rate with engraftment was 92% making HSCT a feasible therapeutic option which may promote mental development. However, the natural history of alpha-mannosidosis without transplantation is so far not well characterized, and it is diffi cult to predict before HSCT how severely affected a patient would become without HSCT. Therefore, quantifi cation of the developmental benefi t of HSCT for patients with mannosidosis remains diffi cult and careful evaluation of neurodevelopmental outcome of transplanted and non-transplanted patients is an important task for the future.",

B\u00e9k\u00e1ssy (1) (1)Lund University Hospital (Lund, SE); (2)University of Gothenburg (Gothenburg, SE) Two pre-symptomatic siblings with mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS-VI) were accidentally diagnosed when hyper granulated neutrophils were seen in the PB smear of the 11 months old boy. His sister was screened 3 months later at birth with the same disease. Homozygous p.C192R ARBS mutation was identifi ed, considered usually \"mild\" but still leading to considerable organ damages and \"a point of no return\". Decision was taken to transplant both sibilings with unrelated cord blood (UCBT) after myeloablative preparation. The boy experienced multiple viral reactivations post transplant, leading to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and eventually loss of the graft. While the 2nd transplantation was performed with PBSC from his haploidentical father, he was kept on mechanical ventilation due to persistent HSV-1 infection with respiratory tract involvement. His sister received the same conditioning prior to UCBT but had an autologous recovery and became subsequently retransplanted with the cryopreserved cells from her father. The haplo-graft was T-cell depleted with the use of immunomagnetic selection of CD34 + cells (CliniMACS). The children received reduced intensity conditioning before the second graft. The post-transplant follow up was not complicated; both children achieved fast and sustained hematological recovery, eventually with 100% donor chimerism with no aGvHD. Both children are passing developmental milestone on time, being well 16,5 and 6 months after the transplant with no cGvHD nor symptoms of the disease. See tables for details. Arylsulfatase activity in leukocytes is normal and urinary elimination of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) is decreasing. MPS VI is a progressive disorder with signifi cant morbidity and early mortality. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is a lifelong therapy administered intravenously and has been shown to improve physical capabilities; however, it is costly and burdensome to the family and society. In our hands haplodentical stem cell transplantation was safe and rescued the children after unsuccessful UCBT. We observe biochemical correction of enzyme activity in the blood as well as decreasing secretion of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) in urine. Long term follow up is necessary in order to judge the haplo procedures' impact on the course of the disease.",

Schwerdtfeger (1) (1)Deutsche Klinik fuer Diagnostik (Wiesbaden, DE); (2)Diakoniekrankenhaus (Mannheim, DE) Human multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are increasingly used for clinical applications mainly in regenerative medicine and immune modulation. Immunomodulatory properties of MSC are exploited in treatment of steroid refractory GvHD following allogeneic SCT. In addition, autoinfl ammatory diseases such as systemic sclerosis, Crohn's disease and multiple sclerosis have shown responses to MSC in animal models and clinical pilot trials. Application of MSC in regenerative medicine has been largely focused on the osteogenic differentiation potential of MSC, e.g. in osteogenesis imperfecta. However, in a growing number of reports MSC mediate their effects in tissue regeneration by secretion of signalling molecules and other proteins. This feature may also be used in the treatment of patients with neurometabolic diseases, e.g. metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD). We show that MSCs produce arylsulfatase A (ASA), which is the defi cient enzyme in MLD patients. Moreover, MSCs release signifi cant amounts of ASA into the media. In a coculture system of healthy MSC and fi broblasts from MLD patients separated by a semipermeable membrane, ASA defi cient cells take up substantial amounts of the enzyme. This uptake was blocked by mannose and mannose-6-phosphate indicating that receptor mediated processes involving the mannose-6-phosphate receptor are important. However, in order to exert their role of enzyme replacement in the brain, MSC need to home to the CNS. This has not been shown in humans so far, but could have great impact also on strategies in multiple sclerosis and other autoinfl ammatory or degenerative diseases of the CNS. Therefore, we analysed the case of a DNA ligase IV-defi cient boy, who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from a matched unrelated donor and obtained MSCs from his haploidentical father for treatment of steroid refractory hepatic and intestinal GvHD \u00b0IV four weeks apart. Two weeks after the second application he succumbed to GvHD and generalized aspergillosis. An autopsy was performed and tissue samples were analysed by immunohistochemistry. Parental MSCs were located in infl amed organs, mainly liver and gut as well as the CNS in areas close to infi ltrates of aspergillosis. Our results demonstrate that MSC may cross the blood-brain barrier in an infl ammatory environment and home to the CNS.",

We employed either in group 1: 2 (12 mg) to 3 (18 mg) Pegfi lgrastim injections on a single day (J0) or in group 2: Filgrastim -twice a day until the end of leukaphersis (LK) at 5 microg/ kg.

Patients were tested at J3 and before each LK for WBC and CD34 + cells. LK were performed on Spectra (Caridian) and there goals were 4 to 8 106 CD34/Kg depending on simple or tandem autograft request. Results are expressed in median.Results: Mobilization with Pegfi lgrastim: problem to organize the injections: none. Adverse effects: bone pain requiring more potent analgesic: 3/18. 18.64 / 20.8. Conclusion : Pegfi lgrastim is easy to use and facililtate the life of patients. Adverse effects are comparable to those usually described with fi lgrastim. The rising of WBC is moderate, even after 18 mg of Pegfi lgrastim. In term of CD34 + cells and functionality, the results are comparable to the fi lgrastim mobilized group.

The role of rhG-CSF in inducing cancer in previously healthy individuals is still uncertain. Nagler et al. (Exp Hematol. 2004 Jan;32 (1):122-30) have shown that lymphocytes in rhG-CSF mobilized stem cell donors show epigenetic and genetic alterations which are comparable to those observed in patients suffering from malignomas. We therefore investigated in a prospective study the occurrence of changes in DNA methylation in lymphocytes of healthy unrelated donors after rhG-CSF administration. Material and methods: In the present study, 20 stem cell donors (14 male/6 female, median age: 40 yrs, range 22-54) were included (active group). Twenty, gender and age-matched routine blood component donors (from our pool) served as untreated controls. Sampling was done before rhG-CSF (Filgrastim, Neupogen\u00ae) administration, at the time of donation and on days + 1, 7, 30, 100, 180 and 360 in both groups. After Ficoll gradient isolation, the mononuclear cell fraction was analyzed by fl ow cytometry after intracellular staining with an anti-methylcytidine antibody. Analysis of DNA-methyltransferase (DNMT) activity in nuclear extracts was performed using a modifi ed radionuclide assay. Results: At no time point, signifi cant differences in overall DNMT activity and DNA methylation could be detected between the groups. The proportion of methylated lymphocytes varied between 95% and 99% in the active group and between 93% and 98% in the control group. Moreover, fl ow cytometric analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations revealed no differences in the extent of DNA-methylation between CD3 + T-cells and CD19 + B-cells. Conclusion: In our prospective study no evidence was found for the induction of DNMT activity or enhanced DNA-methylation after rhG-CSF administration in healthy stem cell donors. A. Meliad\u00f2, O.

To test our hypothesis (Ivanovic 2000 , ECN 15: 6, 2004 ) that an appropriately low dose of IL-3 could enhance ex-vivo production of committed progenitors (CP) without impairing the stem cells, the expansion of CD34 + cells, selected from previously cryopreserved and thawed cord blood units by Isolex (Duchez et al., J Hematother Stem Cell Res 12: 587, 2003) S317 or Miltenyi, (Ivanovic et al., Stem Cells. 22: 716, 2004) ) was performed in two-step cultures (diluted 1:4 after 6 days) in presence of SCF, FLT3 ligand, MGDF (100 ng/ml each) and G-CSF (10 ng/ml) \u00b1 IL-3 (0.5 ng) (VueLife culture bags) in Macopharma HP01 serum-free medium (Ivanovic et al., Transfusion 46: 126, 2006) . The activity of stem cells has been evaluated on the basis of detection of human cells in NOD/Scid mice bone marrow (primary recipients) 6-8 weeks after transplantation (i.v.). The maintenance of very primitive stem cells was studied by a serial engraftment: the secondary recipients were engrafted by an intramedullary injection of primary recipient bone marrow cells. Six weeks later, injected femurs were analyzed (human CD45, CD33, CD19 as well as the number of clonogenic progenitors (CFC) of human-origin, as in primary recipients). The low IL-3 dose used was 50% effi cient (5 of 10 samples responded by doubling-tripling the expansion of total cells and CP with respect to cultures without IL-3). The activity of primitive stem cells -SRC (SCID Repopulating Cells) at the end of culture, was maintained at Day-0 level as judged either by the phenotypical markers (corresponding to relatively less primitive subpopulation of SRC), or by human CFC content in primary recipient bone marrow (SRCCFC, representing relatively more primitive subpopulation of stem cells). IL-3 did not impair the engraftment of secondary recipients (considered to be the measure of very primitive stem cells). Thus, IL-3 applied at low dose in our clinical-scale serum-free cultures of CD34 + cord blood cells could enhance the expansion of CP without impairing stem cell activity.",

Dearden (1), E. Matutes (3) , M. Ethell (1) There are few data on the cost-effectiveness of pegfi lgrastim in this setting. Methods: To investigate this issue we compared healthcare resource utilisation for 53 consecutive patients receiving a single 6mg dose of pegfi lgrastim on day + 1 post transplant, to an historical control group (n = 53) who received daily fi lgrastim or no fi lgrastim (clinical decision). Resource utilisation was assessed by collating costs of the following interventions during admission: in-patient bed stay, critical care admission and usage of blood products, anti-infectives and parenteral nutrition. Results: The median age was 57 years (range 19-72). 76 patients had myeloma (72%), 19 Lymphoma (18%), 11 other haematological malignancies. Conditioning was with melphalan (78), BEAM (17), or other protocols (11). 20 patients were receiving a second PBSCT. Median CD34 + dose was 2.25 \u00d7 10 6 / kg (0.94-7.18). Day 100 TRM was 1%. There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to any of these factors. Filgrastim was administered to 32 patients in the control group (60%) and median number of doses was 2 (range 0-7). There was a signifi cantly reduced time to engraftment in the pegfi lgrastim group versus the control group (median: 10 days (range: 8-28) versus 13 days (6-26); P < 0.001)). Likewise median in-patient stay was signifi cantly reduced (17 days (11-34) versus 19 days ; P < 0.001). No adverse effects attributable to pegfi lgrastim were observed. Reductions in time to engraftment and in-patient bed stay translated into the following cost savings: 13% on IV antibiotics, 40% on IV antifun-gals, 75% on parenteral nutrition, 23% and 30% on platelet and blood transfusions respectively, totalling 24,000\u20ac*. These savings more than offset the drug acquisition costs of pegfi lgrastim over baseline fi lgrastim (16,600\u20ac) . In addition, approximately 150,000\u20ac were saved by the reduction in haematology and critical care bed usage. Conclusion: In our institution the use of pegfi lgrastim post autologous PBSCT was cost effective and associated with clinical advantages compared to previous practice.*2008 conversion.",

Carvalhais Instituto Portugues de Oncologia Porto (Porto, PT) The immune system is a fi nely tuned tool that allows for the protection of the human body from both foreign and internal threats. One of the major mechanisms for this fi ne tuning is the balance between an infl ammatory (type 1 or Th1) or a humoral (type 2 or Th2) response. Allogeneic PBPC transplantation has evolved to a true form of immunotherapy, relying on the immune system of the host to eliminate residual cancer cells and to prevent disease relapse. In this work, we aimed evaluate the infl uence of IFN-g and IL-4 secreting T lymphocytes (Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes, respectively), present in the graft, in the outcome of allotransplanted patients. We analyzed the PBPC grafts collected to 25 healthy adult donors, and the transplant outcome of the corresponding patients, in IPO Porto. All patients presented a malignant haematological disease, with a median age of 48 years (18-59), and were transplanted with a median CD34 + cell dose of 5.09 \u00d7 10 6 /kg. After the transplant, patients were followed for an average of 297 days (139-481) and evaluated for neutrophil and platelet recovery, lymphocyte recovery, degree of aGVHD and cGVHD, disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The group showed a median of 14 and 10 days to neutrophil and platelet recovery, respectively, while the median lymphocyte recovery was of 16 days. Of the 25 patients, 16 developed no aGVHD, 1 had grade I, 6 had grade II and 2 had grade III disease. In this group, 14 patients had no cGVHD, 3 developed limited and 8 extensive disease. Survival analysis showed that 7 patients experienced disease relapse with 4 eventually dying. An infused Th1 cell dose greater than 0,30 \u00d7 10 8 /kg was associated with a quicker platelet engraftment (12 vs. 5 days) (P < 0.05). Neither the Th1 nor the Th2 subpopulations correlated with the degree of aGVHD. Nevertheless, patients infused with a higher dose of Th2 cells developed more extensive cGVHD (P < 0.05). The patient's survival wasn't affected by any of the populations studied. Due to relative small size of the population studied, careful data interpretation is needed. Despite not affecting the survival, the dose of Th1 and Th2 cells infused affected the patient's engraftment and severity of cGVHD developed, showing that a type 1 response is associated with better engraftment and less severe cGVHD, which is consistent with published works. We can conclude that the Th1/Th2 balance of the PBPC graft does affect the outcome of an allogeneic transplant.",

Bojarska-Junak, J. Kowalczyk Medical University of Lublin (Lublin, PL) Aim of the study: In the study we aimed to compare the levels of IL-2, IL-4,IL-10 and TNF-alpha in bone marrow and in S318 supernatant of mesenchymal stem cells cultures (CFU-F) from pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients and their donors. Material and methods: 15 consecutive donors and 12 recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplantation in our institution were included into the study. Samples of bone marrow were obtained from the recipients at the time of pre-transplant evaluation before conditioning regimen. Samples from the donors were obtained at the time of transplantation. Cytokines levels were measured using high sensitivity human immunoassay (R&D and Bender) in bone marrow plasma and in supernatant form CFU-F cultures. CFU-F cultures were performed according to research protocol and reagents provided by manufacturer (StemCell Technologies). Three cultures were performed using 0,5 \u00d7 10 6 , 1 \u00d7 10 6 and 2 \u00d7 10 6 mononuclear cells isolated from each bone marrow sample. Results: Level of IL-10 was signifi cantly higher in supernatant of CFU-F then in bone marrow plasma derived from healthy donors, irrespective of the concentration of cells in the culture (P < 0,05) . In treated patients increase of IL-10 concentration in CFU-F as compare to bone marrow plasma was not significantly different. Il-2 concentrations were signifi cantly increased in CFU-F supernatant as compared to bone marrow plasma in both: patients and donors, however signifi cant negative correlation was found between number of CFU-F in the culture and Il-2 concentration (r = -0,84). Levels of IL-4 and TNF-alpha were not signifi cantly different in CFU-F and bone marrow plasma in our study. Conclusion: Results of our study confi rm, that the immunomodulatory effect of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells may be dependent on IL-10. Further study are planned to explain the difference between MSCs from patients and healthy donors regarding IL-10 secretion. Supported by grant of MNISW of Poland N407 117 35.",

Linkesch (2) The failure to harvest a CD34 + cell target dose of 2 \u00d7 10 6 /kg for autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) remains a signifi cant problem for many transplant centres. Recently, Plerixafor + G-CSF has shown to be safe and more effective than placebo + G-CSF in mobilizing hematopoietic stem cells. On a named-patient basis, Plerixafor has been used in patients failing to mobilize stem cells by conventional means. We present our initial experience with Plerixafor in 33 mobilization attempts in 30 patients with either myeloma (n = 8), lymphoma (n = 19) or germ cell cancer (n = 3) pretreated with a median of 8 (range, 3-27) chemotherapy cycles who failed at least one previous mobilization attempt. In four patients bone marrow harvest had been performed prior to a renewed mobilization attempt resulting in a CD34 + cell dose of 0.16-0.89 \u00d7 10 6 /kg. In the compassionate use program patients received four days of G-CSF at 10 \u03bcg/kg followed by Plerixafor at 240 \u03bcg/kg subcutaneously, 10-11 hours prior to fi rst apheresis. G-CSF and Plerixafor were repeated daily until a defi ned cell dose of at least > 2 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg was obtained. Between days 4 and 5 of cytokine stimulation the CD34 + cells in peripheral blood increased a median of 5 fold (range, 1-12), reaching 24 (range, 5-61) CD34 + cells/\u03bcl after Plerixafor administration.Twenty-one of 30 patients (70%) achieved the target cell dose of > 2 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg (median 4.15, range 2.03-8.07 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg) after one (n = 20) or two (n = 1) courses of Plerixafor stimulation. In 6 patients (20%) an insuffi cient cell dose of 0.42 to 1.46 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg were collected and 3 patients (10%) failed to mobilize CD34 + cells. Patients failing Plerixafor re-mobilization had a median of 10 (range, 5-18) cycles of pretreatment with NHL (n = 7) and MM (n = 2). Common side effects to G-CSF + Plerixafor stimulation included abdominal discomfort (n = 3), diarrhoea (n = 5), and paresthesia (n = 1). Thirteen patients underwent HCT and received a median of 3.19 \u00d7 10 6 (range, 1.46-5.6 ) CD34 + cell dose/kg without side effects. All patients achieved sustained neutrophil and platelet engraftment a median of 12 (range, 9-16) and 15 (range, 9-38) days after stem cell infusion. In our experience, Plerixafor appears highly effective for the mobilisation of hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation in patients failing to mobilize by conventional means, with generally acceptable toxicity and a high rate of success.",

            "text": "Rescue from failed growth factor and/or chemotherapy haematopoietic stem cell mobilization with G-CSF and Plerixafor in patients with non-haematologic diseases N. Worel (1), K. H\u00fcbel (2) , H. Agis (1), W. Rabitsch (1), G. Russ (3) , N. Frickhofen (4) , P. Kalhs (1), H. Greinix (1) (1) Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) can be a curative procedure for a variety of haematological and oncological malignancies. Successful HCT is dependent on transplantation of suffi cient CD34 + cells to ensure prompt and durable engraftment. However, a number of patients fail to mobilize the threshold of > 2 \u00d7 10 6 /kg CD34 + cells. Recently, Plerixafor + G-CSF (G) has shown to be safe and more effective than placebo + G in mobilizing CD34 + cells in patients with MM and lymphoma. In addition, Plerixafor has been used in a named-patient basis for PBSC mobilization from patients failing to mobilize by conventional means. The aim of this report is to evaluate the effect of Plerixafor + G among patients with non-hematologic diseases. Patients with previous CD34 mobilization failure were included in this analysis. Mobilization consisted of 4 days of G at 10 \u03bcg/kg/d followed by Plerixafor at 240 \u03bcg/kg on day 4, 10-11 hrs prior to fi rst apheresis. G and Plerixafor were repeated daily until a defi ned cell dose of at least 2 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg was obtained. Nine patients with a median age of 50 years diagnosed with germ cell (7) and ovarian cancer (1) and Ewing sarcoma (1), were enrolled. Pretreatment consisted of a median of 5 (range, 5-20) chemotherapy cycles. In 2 patients previous stem cell collection resulted in 0.9 \u00d7 10 6 /kg CD34 + cells prior to a renewed mobilization attempt. Between day 4 and 5 (10-11 hrs after Plerixafor), the CD34 + cells in the peripheral blood increased a median of 5 fold (range, 1-24), reaching 33 (range, 12-52) CD34 + cells/\u03bcl. Eight of 9 (89%) patients achieved the target cell dose of 2 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg together with previous harvested cells (median 3.19 , range 1.8-25.33 \u00d7 10 6 /kg CD34 + cells) after 1(2), 2(6) or 4(1) days of collection, 1 patient failed to collect an insuffi cient cell dose (0.89 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg). Common side effects to G + Plerixafor stimulation included abdominal discomfort (1) and diarrhoea (2) . Three patients underwent HCT receiving a median of 3.36 (range, 2.6-54.14) \u00d7 10 6 /kg CD34 + cells. All patients achieved sustained neutrophil and platelet engraftment between days 10-12 and on day 10 after HCT, respectively. These data demonstrate that Plerixafor + G is effective in patients with non-hematologic diseases after mobilization failure. In patients eligible for HCT who have failed prior mobilization attempts, Plerixafor can provide an opportunity to still pursue a potentially curative procedure.Peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization and subsequent autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is the most effective strategy in many patients with Multiple Myeloma (MM), Hodgkin's Disease (HD) or non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). However, a signifi cant proportion of patients are not able to mobilize an adequate number of cells after conventional stem cell mobilization strategies [i.e. chemotherapy and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or G-CSF alone], and can not proceed to ASCT. In the present work, we report 8 heavily pre-treated or treatment refractory MM or lymphoma patients (4 males and 4 females, median age 57 years) who were failing PBSC mobilization, after disease-specifi c chemotherapy (DHAP, = 2; Cyclophosphamide, = 4; R-ICE, = 2) and G-CSF but PBSCs were successfully harvested after addition of Plerixafor. Study patients showed a peak concentration of PB CD34 + cells lower than 10 cells/ \u03bcL during the recovery phase after chemotherapy and G-CSF and/or were predicted to have inadequate PBSC collection to proceed to the planned stem cell transplantation program. The timing for Plerixafor administration was not planned in advance. The rapid biological activity of Plerixafor (i.e. peak time of CD34 + cell mobilization occurring 10-12 hours after injection) allowed its administration when PBSC mobilization was felt to be inadequate, considering WBCs and CD34 + cell kinetics. Plerixafor (0.24 mg/Kg), was administered subcutaneously for up to 3 consecutive days (median injections = 2), while continuing G-CSF, 10-11 hours before the planned leukapheresis. Plerixafor was safe and no signifi cant adverse events were recorded. We observed a remarkable fold-increase (median value = 4) in the number of circulating CD34 + cells following Plerixafor as compared to baseline CD34 + cell concentration. In all patients more than 2 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/Kg were collected. Four/8 patients collected the target cell dose: 4 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/Kg for single ASCT in NHL and 6 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/Kg for tandem ASCT in MM with a median of 2 apheresis. Four patients have already undergone ASCT with Plerixaformobilized PBSCs showing a rapid and durable hematological recovery. Our results demonstrate that the addition of Plerixafor to G-CSF, after tumor-specifi c chemotherapy, is safe and allows the rescue of heavily pre-treated or poor-prognosis NHL and MM patients who need to perform ASCT as consolidation therapy but are failing stem cell mobilization.",

Plerixafor, a novel CXCR4 antagonist could be recently used with G-CSF in heavily pretreated or not mobilizing patients as a new stem cell mobilizing agent inhibiting binding of stromal-derived factor-1a to its receptor CXCR4 present on CD34 + cells. Thanks to Genzyme Company Named Patient Program we have had an opportunity to use plerixafor in 7 Czech transplant centers (see above). Our aim was to assess the safety and mobilizing potential of plerixafor in 35 patients of median age of 63 years (7-72) with myeloma (n = 17), NHL (n = 15), Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 1), and pediatric solid tumors (n = 2). Plerixafor was used together with G-CSF for the fi rst mobilization in 10 heavily pretreated patients, as a second mobilization attempt in 22 previously poor mobilizers, and in 3 patients as a boost at the end of usual mobilizing regimen (chemotherapy + G-CSF) because of poor mobilization (in 1 patient was plerixafor used twice). Mobilization using plerixafor was successful in 25 patients (71%) and median number of collected CD34 + cells was 4,9 \u00d7 10 6 /kg (1,3-37,6). All patients who have been already transplanted, recover hemopoiesis quickly and completely. The adverst events were slight and were observed in 10 patients (28%), mainly as musculoskeletal pains (14% of patients) and diarrhea or nauzea (14% of patients). The concentration of CD34 + cells in blood before apheresis correlated closely and signifi cantly with the leukapheresis yield (r = 0,89). Based on our experience, we can conclude that plerixafor is very valuable tool for obtaining PBSC in heavily pretreated or previously poorly mobilizing patients. More then two thirds of poor mobilizers could be, in our hands, successfuly mobilized using plerixafor and having a safe autologous transplant we can offer them high-dose chemotherapy which could be potentialy curative.

            "text": "Plerixafor is a new CXCR4 receptor inhibitor, which is used for stem cell mobilization in myeloma and lymphoma patients. Since April 2009, we performed 18 mobilizations in 16 patients using plerixafor in combination with G-CSF. 10 patients suffered from multiple myeloma, 3 from Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 3 of Hodgkin's lymphoma. Median age was 59 years (range, 19-71) and 9 of patients were males. They have been treated with median of 10 courses of chemotherapy (range, 4-27) and radiotherapy (5 patients). 5 of patients already underwent autologous stem cell transplantation. The majority of them failed at least one mobilization attempt, while in three patients we added plerixafor to the fi rst-line chemotherapy-based mobilization. This approach was based on their predicted poor mobilizer S321 status confi rmed by low peripheral blood CD34 + cell count. At the time of mobilization, only 3 patients were in complete remission while the majority had active disease. The majority of patients were treated according to protocol consisting of daily s.c. injections of G-CSF (10 ug/kg) and plerixafor (240 ug/kg) on day 4, 5 and 6. Plerixafor was administered about 11.5 hours before planned leukapheresis. The mobilization regimen resulted in satisfactory peripheral blood CD34 + cell number (median 22 cells/ul; range, 11-62) . However due to high leukocytosis (median 43.3G/L; range, 11.4-72.5 ) their proportion was low (median 0.075%, range 0.030-0.215). We managed to collect the minimum required No. of > 2.0 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg b.w. in 12/16 patients (75%). The median CD34 + cell number was 2.6 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg b.w. (range,0-4.5 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg b.w.) collected in median of 3 leukaphereses (0-3). It was associated with high total nucleated cell (NC) count (median 9.35 \u00d7 10 8 NC/kg b.w.; range 0-24.05). This resulted in high volumes of frozen stem cell product (median 1280 mL; range 0-2050). The median No. of BFU-E was 3.84\u00d7 10 4 (range, 1.03-16.09) and No. of CFU-GM + GEMM was 3.12x104/kg b.w. (range, 2.08-13.76 ). The contamination of stem cell product with plasma cells in MM patients was not remarkable in majority of patients (0.28 \u00d7 10 6 CD138 + cells/kg; range, 0-.67). 10 of patients have already been transplanted and median time to neutrophil (> 0.5 G/L) engraftment was 13 days (11-14) and platelet engraftment (> 20 G/L) 14 days (10-15). In conclusion, stem cell mobilization with plerixafor is effi cient and may fi nd application even in poorly mobilizing patients. O. Jaksic (1), , I. Maricic (1) , I. Bojanic (2) , D. Nemet (2) , V.

            "text": "Autologous stem cell transplantation is an important treatment option for a number of hematological malignancies as well as some other malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Main source of hematopoietic stem cells is peripheral blood (PBSC). Our standard approach to mobilize adequate number of PBSC includes chemotherapy + G-CSF and large volume leukapheresis (LVL) to further improve PBSC yield. This approach is quite effective, however in a number of cases mobilization failure still occurs. In this report we have evaluated effi cacy of plerixafor + G-CSF followed by LVL in a group of patients that previously failed to mobilize by our standard approach including LVL. There were 11 patients (4M, 7F), median age 59yr (range 26-63 yr) with multiple myeloma (n = 2), NHL (n = 7) Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 1) and testicular cancer (n = 1). They were pretreated with median 2 lines of chemotherapy (range 2-5). Standard protocol for mobilization was the one proposed by manufacturer and included G-CSF (10 \u03bcg/kg SC) for 4 days, followed by plerixafor administration (240 \u03bcg/kg) in the evening on day 4 (11 hours before apheresis) and G-CSF (10 \u03bcg/kg SC) administered on day 5, one hour before apheresis. Plerixafor administration, G-CSF administration and apheresis continued until the patient collected suffi cient number of CD34 + cells. Total of 9 (82%) patients were successfully mobilized with plerixafor achieving minimum of \u22652 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg while 6 (55%) patients achieved \u22655 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg with median number of 2 apheresis (range 1-4). Total of 22 apheresis procedures were performed with mean of 4.96 blood volumes (BV) processed (range 4.3-6.0). Mean CD34 + yield per apheresis procedure was 2.65 \u00d7 10 6 /kg (range 0.15-13.44 ). Mean CD34 + yield per apheresis per BV was 0.52 \u00d7 10 6 /kg. Subsequently 7 patients were successfully transplanted and there was 1 tandem transplant. Median number of CD34 + cells infused ( \u00d7 10 6 /kg) was 5.64 (range 4.74-6.96) . Median time to leukocyte recovery (WBC > 1) was 10 days and median time to platelet recovery (> 20) was 14 days.In conclusion, plerixafor with G-CSF is effective mobilization regimen that increases peripheral blood CD34 + count (median 2.9 \u00d7 following plerixafor) resulting in collection of adequate cell dose with LVL in patients who previously failed to do so with standard protocols with LVL (9/11). Mobilization with plerixafor is safe and subsequent transplantation and engraftment is consistent with our prior results.",

Py\u00f6r\u00e4l\u00e4, E. Mahlam\u00e4ki, T. Nousiainen Kuopio University Hospital (Kuopio, FI) A signifi cant proportion of patients with lymphoid malignancies are hard-to-mobilize with currently used mobilization regimens including granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) with or without chemotherapy (CT). Plerixafor combined with G-CSF has been shown to be more effective in blood stem cell mobilization than G-CSF alone and has been used also in patients who have failed a previous mobilization attempt. Limited data is available on the addition of plerixafor to CT + G-CSF mobilization in hard-to-mobilize patients.We have used add-on plerixafor in fi ve patients with lymphoid malignancies after CT + G-CSF mobilization. There were three males and two females with a median age of 64 years (55-68). Four patients had non-Hodgkin lymphoma and one patient multiple myeloma. Two patients had failed a previous mobilization course (CT + G-CSF). The mobilization regimen was high-dose cytarabine plus G-CSF in three patients and cyclophosphamide plus G-CSF in two patients. B-CD34 + counts were low (< 1-3 \u00d7 10 6 /l) 11-15 days after start with mobilization in all but one patients who had decreasing B-CD34 + counts (7 \u00d7 10 6 /l). The patients received 1-3 injections of plerixafor (median 2). B-CD34 + counts rose in four patients to 9, 39, 39, and 40 \u00d7 10 6 / l, respectively; one patient did not respond. In four out of fi ve patients the collections were successful after addition of plerixafor. The number of collections was one in two patients (2.1 and 3.1 \u00d7 10 6 /kg CD34 + cells, respectively), two in one patient (4.0 \u00d7 10 6 /kg CD34 + cells) and four in one patient (2.2 \u00d7 10 6 /kg CD34 + cells). Two patients have received BEAM with stem cell graft support with successful engraftment. Addition of plerixafor to a mobilization regimen consisting of chemotherapy plus G-CSF in poor mobilizers is effi cient and frequently leads to successful collection to facilitate high-dose therapy with blood stem cell support.",

            "text": "Objectives: To demonstrate the bioequivalence of Hospira fi lgrastim (HF) and Amgen fi lgrastim (AF) with respect to the mobilisation of CD34 + peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs). Methods: Healthy, male or female subjects aged 18-50 years were enrolled in a randomised, double-blind phase I study. Subjects were fi rst randomised to 5mcg/kg or 10mcg/kg fi lgrastim dose groups, before further randomisation to order of agent administration. Subcutaneous injections of HF or AF were administered under double-blind conditions on fi ve consecutive days (days [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] , with crossover to the alternative agent after a washout period of \u2265 13 days. Blood samples were taken at day 1 (pre dose), day 3 (6 h post dose), day 5 (6 h post dose), day 7 (48 h post dose) and day 10 (120 h post dose). Mean CD34 + cell counts were evaluated by fl ow cytometry. Bioequivalence was assessed using a mixed effects analysis of variance model. Bioequivalence was concluded if the 90% confi dence intervals (CI) for the ratio of 'test' (HF) to 'reference' (AF) mean CD34 + cell counts at day 5 were within the conventional bioequivalence limits of 0.80- 1.25 . Results: Twenty-four subjects were randomised to the 5mcg/kg group and 26 to the 10 mcg/kg group. At both doses, CD34 + cell counts were similar with HF and AF across all time points. Regardless of agent or dose, mean CD34 + cell count at day 1 was 2.2-2.8 cells/microl, increasing to a maximum count at day 5. In the 5 mcg/kg group, mean CD34 + cell count at day 5 (n = 24) was 47.2 cells/microl (95% CI: 36.1, 61.7) with HF and 46.0 cells/microl (95% CI: 33.6, 63.0) with AF. In the 10 mcg/kg group, mean CD34 + cell count at day 5 (n = 23) was 81.9 cells/microl (95% CI: 64.5, 104.0) with HF and 77.5 cells/microl (95% CI: 59.4, 101.3) with AF ( Figure  1 ). At both doses, 90% CIs for the ratios of test to reference mean CD34 + cell counts at day 5 were within the predefi ned range required to demonstrate bioequivalence. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) was slightly lower with HF than with AF at both doses (5 mcg/kg, 79 vs. 83%; 10 mcg/kg, 77 vs. 92%). The most frequently reported AEs were back pain (38-62%) and headache (44-58%), which could be treated with standard analgesics. Conclusions: Hospira fi lgrastim and Amgen fi lgrastim are similar in their ability to stimulate mobilisation of CD34 + PBPCs. The bioequivalence of these agents should enable Hospira fi lgrastim to be used without the need to adapt PBPC harvesting protocols.",

F. Duarte (1) , , A. D'Addio (3) , J. Gayoso (4) , B.E. Shaw (5) , N.H. Russell (6) , R. Lemoli (3) , N. Worel (7) ( Plerixafor has been recently approved in Europe to enhance mobilisation of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) in combination with GCSF in patients with lymphoma and multiple myeloma who mobilise poorly. Following approval, clinical algorithms tailored to local institutions are being developed to appropriately manage these patients. One of such possible algorithms is a preemptive model of plerixafor use, which takes advantage of the easy applicability of the drug in the evening before planned apheresis and relies on PB CD34 cell counts on day 4 of GCSF as a trigger. We have identifi ed 38 patients (20 myeloma, 18 lymphoma; 23 men; age 56, 33-67) with suboptimal PB CD34 cell levels on day 4 prior to plerixafor treatment (CD34/uL < 5, n = 17; 5-10, n = 15; 10-20, n = 6) and compared them with 175 controls from the same period of time (57 myeloma, 118 lymphoma; 92 men; age 59, 22-70) with day 4 CD34 level monitoring who did not receive plerixafor treatment (CD34/uL < 5, n = 71; 5-10, n = 39; 10-20, n = 65). Plerixafor administration on day 4 increased the PB CD34 level 5.9-fold ( \u00b1 3.9), even for the subgroup with <5 CD34/uL (6.4-fold \u00b1 3.7), and overall, enhanced PBSC mobilisation, in keeping with results from registration trials. In particular, patients with <10 CD34 + cells/uL on day 4, who are more likely to mobilize poorly, collected higher numbers of PBSC with plerixafor compared to GCSF alone in the fi rst apheresis (2.3 vs. 0.7 CD34 \u00d7 10 6 /kg; P < 0.001) and overall (3.4 vs. 2.1 CD34 \u00d7 10 6 /kg; P < 0.001). Even in patients with baseline PB CD34 levels <5/uL, plerixafor provides a CD34 + yield of 1.5 \u00b1 0.9 \u00d7 10 6 /kg in the fi rst apheresis, and 2.8 \u00b1 1.3 \u00d7 10 6 /kg overall, successfully achieving \u2265 2 \u00d7 10 6 /kg CD34 cells/kg in 76% of these pacients. Twenty six patients (68%) have undergone autologous HSCT so far, with a median CD34 + cell dose of 2.9 (1.5-5.6 ) \u00d7 10 6 /kg. All patients engrafted neutrophils > 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L at median day + 12 (9-30) and platelets > 20 \u00d7 10 9 /L at median day + 14 (9-38), with no cases of secondary graft failure. These results set the ground for a preemptive model of plerixafor use based on day four PB CD34 + cell count monitoring. This strategy may allow centers to identify patients, even those with very low PB CD34 counts, for whom the benefi t derived from the enhanced mobilization capacity of plerixafor can be maximized, improving the success of fi rst-line mobilisations and avoiding treatment delays and costs derived from secondary attempts.",

Yehson (1) , B. George (2) , M. Hertzberg (2) , D. Gottlieb (2) (1)Sydney Cellular Therapies Laboratory, Westmead (Sydney, AU); (2)Blood and Marrow Transplant Unit, Westmead Hospital (Sydney, AU) Aim: This pilot study was aimed at assessing the feasibility of mobilization using outpatient fractionated ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide (ICE) as salvage therapy along with a sin-gle dose of pegfi lgrastim in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Methods: Between 2005 and 2008, 10 patients (5 Hodgkin's and 5 diffuse large cell lymphoma) underwent salvage therapy with ICE and 9 with evidence of responsive disease received pegfi lgrastim (6 mg SC) on Day 4 following the 3rd cycle of ICE towards stem cell mobilization. Stem cells were harvested once the peripheral blood CD34 dose was > 20/ul. Results: Six patients (66.6%) successfully mobilised at a median of 31 days (range: 22-36) from administration of pegfi lgrastim while 3 had failure of mobilization. The median peripheral blood CD34 on the day of harvest was 31.5/ul (range: 22-38) while a median dose of 3.1 \u00d7 10 6 CD34/kg (range: 2.6 to 4.1) was harvested. Four of the six patients required 2 harvests to obtain an adequate cell dose. Compared with a retrospective cohort of patients mobilised with ICE chemotherapy and G-CSF (5-10 ug/kg/day), mobilization results were clearly inferior ( Table 1) . Of the 3 patients with mobilization failure, 2 were mobilised with AMD3100 and 1 with Cyclophosphamide/ G-CSF. All patients underwent autologous stem cell transplant with median neutrophil engraftment of 15 days (range: 11-21) and platelet engraftment of 19 days (range: 13-35). At a median follow up of 12 months (range: 6-37), eight patients (80%) are alive. Conclusion: Stem cell mobilization using ICE chemotherapy and pegfi lgrastim has inferior mobilization characteristics compared with ICE chemotherapy and daily fi lgrastim. In patients who had successful mobilization, neutrophil and platelet engraftment following autologous SCT was prompt and not delayed.",

Only 1 patient failed to achieve a suffi cient cell dose for transplant: she subsequently underwent delayed re-mobilisation using G-CSF with plerixafor 240 micrograms/kg/day, resulting in a CD34 + dose of 2.12*10 6 /kg. One patient suffered immediate plerixafor-related toxicity (nausea). One patient died of sepsis at 75 days post-plerixafor, without undergoing transplant: the sepsis did not appear to be plerixafor-related. 2 patients were not transplanted due to concerns over fi tness (n = 1) or disease progression (n = 1; subsequently responded to bortezomib): both remain alive. The remaining 9 patients have undergone transplant. One patient died of sepsis at Day + 33, though neutrophil engraftment was achieved; the remaining 8 transplanted patients are alive without disease progression at a median of 11 months from plerixafor administration. Two patients recovered endogenous renal function post-transplant; a third achieved CR from myeloma and underwent successful renal transplant.

Halle (3) (1)CHU (Clermont-Ferrand, FR) ; (2) Centre Hospitalier (Jolimont, BE); (3)INSERM CIC 501, FR) Controlled rate freezing and storage of HPC in liquid nitrogen are considered standard procedures in the setting of autologous transplantation. Uncontrolled rate freezing and storage of hematopo\u00efetic stem cells in a -80\u00b0C freezer are less complex and expensive, but not used as routine technic mostly due to their unknown long-term viability. We therefore examined if the engraftment of stem cells frozen at -80\u00b0C in 3.5-5% DMSO was affected by their storage duration. Six hundred seventy two autologous transplants from two european transplant units between 1995 and 2008 were performed in 573 patients, aged from 1 to 82 years (median 52.6 years), from our 2 transplant units. Diagnosis were myeloma (n = 231), lymphoma (n = 222), solid tumor (n = 155), acute leukemia (n = 43), chronic leukemia (n = 15) and \"uncommon\" disorders (n = 6). The median storage time was 56 days with 570 autografts cryopreserved less than 6 months, 41 between 6 to 12 months and 61 more than 12 months. Age and sex had no impact on hematological recovery to 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /l neutrophils and to 20 \u00d7 10 9 /l platelets, while diagno-sis, number of CD34 + cells infused, and use of growth factors, correlated with early blood cells recovery. Otherwise, diagnosis impacted on neutrophil recovery (P = 0.002), number of CD34 + cells infused correlated both with neutrophil and platelet recovery (P < 0.0001 and 0.001, respectively) . Moreover, growth factors use was associated both with neutrophil (P = 0.03) and platelet recovery (P = 0.0001). Median time to reach 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /l neutrophils was 11 [0-299] versus 10 [0-18] versus 11 [0-46] days for storage time of less than 6 months, between 6 to12 months and more than 12 months respectively (P = 0.08, . Similarly, storage time had no impact on platelet recovery (P = 0.12) : with median times of 12 [0-318] versus 11 [0-47] versus 12 days respectively. These data suggest that uncontrolled rate freezing and longterm storage of stem cells at -80\u00b0C even beyond several years does not alter their engraftment potential. This supports the use of this inexpensive and easy technique, especially in the context of limited fi nancial and technological resources. W. Zhang (1), R. Danby (2) , S. Naid (1) , A.

High purity was offset by lower Treg recovery: CD25Pos1 17.7%; CD25Pos2 7%; CD25Pos3 4.5% respectively. The CD25Pos2 population was thus identifi ed as optimal for subsequent expansion (Exp). Two rounds of expansion (Exp-1 and Exp-2) were performed using anti-CD3/CD28 beads. Exp-1 gave an 11-fold and Exp-2 a 21-fold expansion in cell number. The highest levels of Treg purity were found in the Exp-1 (81.4%) vs. Exp-2 (67.5%). The cell number required to suppress MLRs by 50% were lower in Exp-1 (2 \u00d7 10*3) compared to Exp-2 (3.3 \u00d7 10*4) (P < 0.01), indicating a loss of suppressive function in Exp-2. We assessed Fas and Fas-L expression of expanded cells. Fas-L was negative in freshly isolated T-cells. During CD3/CD28 expansion of CD25Pos cells, FasL was mainly expressed intracellularly on CD4 + and CD8 + cells, extracellular expression of FasL detected only on a small percentage of T-cells. However, Fas levels were found to be positively correlated to FOXP3 levels. To assess the functional signifi cance of the graded expression of Fas according to FOXP3 levels, we next measured the sensitivity of the CD25 + cells after Exp-1 to Fas-mediated apoptosis induced by the anti-Fas mAb CH11. CH11 caused a dose-dependent reduction in CD4 + Fas + FOXP3 + cells (P < 0.01) and especially CD4 + Fas + FOXP3Hi cells (P < 0.001) whilst concomitantly enriching those with no FOXP3. We also tested if activation-induced apoptosis can be prevented by the Fas-blocking antibody ZB4. We found a signifi cant dosedependent increase in viable CD4 + FOXP3High cells after 24 hours (P < 0.01), while the CD4 + FOXP3-percentage remained unchanged; there was also signifi cant (P < 0.05) protection of the CD4 + FOXP3 + cells by the higher doses of ZB4. Staining for FLICA (a marker of caspase 8 activation) was greatest in cells expressing high levels of FOXP3. FLICA staining was reduced in experimental groups by ZB4 at 0.5 or 1.0 mcg/ml suggesting dose-dependent protection from Fas/Caspase 8-mediated apoptosis. These studies indicate that reducing apoptosis via Fas-FasL pathways may enhance the ex vivo expansion of Tregs.Depletion of T and B cells of stem cells is mandatory for allogeneic stem cell transplantation from HLA non identical donors. We summarize our results using the CliniMACS device for depletion of apheresis products intended for transplantation from haplo-identical donors. Procedure was slightly modifi ed from the original protocol. Cells were washed and stained with antibody reagent in centrifuge tubes instead of bags. Separations were performed using the LS tubing set and CliniMACS program 2.1 with up to three devices run in parallel. Cells were analyzed and stored overnight for separation on day of transplantation or cryopreserved. 252 separations were performed. Apheresis products with 4,50 \u00b1 2.12 \u00d7 10 10 MNC were used with a mean of 358 \u00b1 50 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells. T-cell load was 27.7 \u00b1 10.7 percent and B-cells were 4.6 \u00b1 2.8 percent in the apheresis product. After depletion, a mean of 0.0082 \u00b1 0.011 percent of CD3 + cells could be detected and B-cells, as determined as CD20 + cells were reduced to 0.0028 \u00b1 0.004 percent. By this T-cells were depleted by log 4.08 \u00b1 0.44 and B-cells by log 4.41 \u00b1 0.89. Recovery of mononuclear cells was 44.9 \u00b1 10.5 percent and recovery of CD34 + cells was 67.64 \u00b1 16.58 percent. Recovery of CD56 + NK-cells was 68,61 \u00b1 45,68 percent. Viability of cells was 96.8 \u00b1 4.0 percent after separation. Flow cytometry: Viable T-cells were defi ned by their cell scatter characteristics of lymphocytes, the absence of CD14 and CD33, negativity for propidium iodide staining and positivity for CD3 and CD4 or CD8, respectively. Furthermore, a sample of depleted cells was spiked with about 3 percent of cells from the positive fraction and the gate for CD3 + cells was set using the dot plot of this sample. A minimum of 1 \u00d7 10 6 events was acquired for analysis and the gate for detection of CD3 + cells was set fi rst on the CD3 + population in the CD3 + CD19 + positive cell sample. Detection of residual B-cells could not be performed using standard CD19 antibody, possibly due to the strong internalization of CD19 after the incubation of cells with CD19-reagent. Therefore, CD20 was used for detection instead. Profound depletion of T-cells could be achieved with the Clini-MACS system at a acceptable recovery of stem cells. However, the number of cells per run is limited and the procedure takes more time than CD34 enrichment. Detection of residual T and B cells by fl ow cytometry is diffi cult and needs special attention.",

            "text": "Galectin-1 contributes to the immunomodulatory properties of human multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells F. Gieseke, J. B\u00f6hringer, R. Handgretinger, I. M\u00fcller University Children's Hospital (Tubingen, DE) Human multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are of clinical interest in allogeneic stem cell transplantation for several reasons including support for haematopoietic stem cells and immunomodulatory effects in graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). In vitro studies have shown that MSC suppress lymphocyte proliferation and effector functions of T cells and NK cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of these immunomodulatory properties are not completely understood, even though several molecules and mechanisms have been identifi ed. We performed a cDNA array analysis of MSC and found a very high expression of galectin-1 mRNA in MSC. As galectin-1 was described to be a potent inhibitor of T cells and to ameliorate GvHD in a mouse model, it is possibly contributing to the immunomodulatory functions of MSC in this setting. At the protein level we found galectin-1 effi ciently translated and expressed intracellularly and on the cell surface of MSC. Furthermore, galectin-1 is released into the supernatant by MSC in high amounts as shown by ELISA. In addition to galectin-1, other members of the galectin family have similar immunodulatory functions. Thus we analysed the expression of different galectins in MSC by RT-PCR and detected expression of galectin-3 and -8 mRNA as well as weak expression of galectin-2, -4, -9 and -12 mRNA. In order to demonstrate function relevant and involvement of galectin-1 in the antiproliferative effect on peripheral blood S326 mononuclear cells (PBMC) exerted by MSC in vitro, we established a galectin-1 knockdown in MSC using a retroviral transfection system. Therefore we constructed a retroviral vector containing an H1-RNA-promotor followed by a small hairpin targeting galectin-1 or control sequences, respectively. Retroviral transfection did not alter immunophenotype or plasticity of MSC. A stable and effi cient knockdown of galectin-1 in MSC was achieved as confi rmed by immunoblot and ELISA. In functional assays, MSC with a galectin-1 knockdown (MSC-G1-knockdown) showed signifi cantly reduced antiproliferative potential compared to MSC infected with control RNAi sequences. In addition, MSC-G1-knockdown were less effi cient in suppressing interferon-gamma production by activated PBMC. Taken together, these data indicate that galectin-1 contributes to the immunomodulatory properties of MSC and furthermore other members of the galectin family with redundant functions may further contribute to this inhibitory pathway. A. Tormin (1) , O. Li (1) , J. Brune (1) , S. Scheding (2) (1)University of Lund (Lund, SE); (2)University Hospital Lund (Lund, SE) MSC progenitor/stem cells (MSC-PC/SC) are important constituents of the hematopoietic stem cell niche, thus playing an essential role in supporting, maintaining and controlling hematopoiesis. The enrichment of primary MSC progenitors, i.e. CFU-F, has been recently reported using surface markers such as CD271, CD146, GD2, SSEA4, etc. Based on the expression of CD271 and CD146 on primary MSC, we have now identifi ed two bone marrow (BM) subpopulations (CD271 + /CD146 + /CD45-and CD271 + /CD146-/low/ CD45-) that were highly enriched for primary MSC-PC/SC. Both populations coexpressed typical MSC markers (CD90, CD105, PDGFR-alpha, STRO-1), but not GD2, SSEA4, and endothelial markers. Both populations contained all assayable CFU-F at comparable frequencies, they both gave rise to typical cultured MSC (surface markers, differentiation capacity), and their gene expression profi le was similar (single cell multiplex PCR for Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, CEBPA, LPIN1, ALPL). Interestingly, confocal microscopy analysis of normal human BM sections showed that reticular CD271/CD146 double positive cells were mainly located adjacent to larger vessels and sinusoids but were also found in the marrow space. In contrast, CD271 single positive cells were primarily found in the endosteal space. These cells were furthermore negative for CD45 in contrast to CD45 coexpressing CD271 + /low cells in the marrow space. Thus, expression of CD146 in CD271 + / CD45-cells correlated with localization (primarily endosteal versus primarily perivascular). Moreover, CD146 expression of CD271 + /CD146-/low/CD45-cells cultured in normoxia was lower up to the 1st passage when compared with cultures initiated with sorted CD271 + /CD146 + /CD45-cells. Thereafter however, CD146 expression was comparable. Furthermore, when established MSC (CD146 + ) were cultured in hypoxia, CD146 expression was clearly downregulated over time, and CD146 was re-expressed again when cells were re-transferred to normoxia. No hypoxia-related changes were observed for other surface markers, such as CD90 and CD271. In summary, CD271 + /CD146 + /CD45-and CD271 + /CD146-/ low/CD45-bone marrow cells are putative primary MSC stem/progenitor populations. Differences in CD146 expression correlated to localization and are caused by differences in oxygen levels. We therefore conclude that CD146 expression allows to distinguish the vary rare primary endosteal niche MSC (CD271 + /CD146-/low/CD45-) from vascular niche MSC (CD271 + /CD146 + /CD45-).",

Commonly, bone marrow-derived MSC (BM-MSC) are used for clinical MSC cell therapies. However, BM-derived MSC have a restricted proliferative capacity and cultured BM-MSC are heterogeneous and are thus diffi cult to standardize. Human embryonic stem cell-derived mesenchymal stroma cells (hES-MSC) have recently been developed and might represent an alternative and unlimited source of MSC. We therefore aimed to characterize human ES-cell-derived MSC, i.e. the hES-MSC line hES- MP002.5 (Cellartis) and compare its properties with normal human bone marrow (BM) derived MSC. We found that hES-MP002.5 cells have lower yet reasonable CFU-F capacity when compared with BM-MSC (6 + 3 vs. 25 + 1 CFU-F per 100 cells). hES-MP cells showed similar surface immunophenotypic properties compared with BM-MSC (fl ow cytometry): Both cell types were positive for CD105, CD73, CD166, HLA Class I, CD44, CD146 and CD90, and cells were negative for surface markers such as CD45, CD34, CD14, CD31, CD19, and HLA-DR. hES-MP, like BM-MSC, could be differentiated into adipocytes, osteoblasts and chondrocytes upon induction in vitro. In order to test whether MSC were capable of homing to the bone marrow after intravenous injection, hES-MP and BM-MSC were infected with GFP expressing lentivirus, and sorted GFP-positive cells were injected intravenously into NOD-SCID mice. GFP-positive cells could not be detected in the bone marrow 24 hours after injection, neither when hES-MP cell were injected, nor -and as expected -when cultured BM-MSC were used. Intra-femoral transplantation experiments of hES-MP into NOD-SCID mice to test for stroma reconstituting capacity as well as LTC-IC experiments to test for in-vitro stroma support are ongoing. Furthermore, characterization of the immunemodulatory properties of hES-MP will be performed. In summary, our experiments conducted thus far demonstrated that MSC derived from hESC have similar biological properties and functions compared with conventional BM-MSC. ES-cell derived MSC might be an attractive and reliable alternative and unlimited source for obtaining MSC for clinical use.",
